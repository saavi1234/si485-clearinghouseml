At this time, the Court does not quash the subpoenas or stay enforcement of them. The Court, however, holds that other witnesses must be called first before the Court decides if the Mayor or councilmembers' testimony is necessary. For example, City Administrative Officer Matthew Szabo and Deputy Mayor of Homelessness and Community Health Dr. Etsemaye Agonafer, who the City argues are the most knowledgeable about the Citys compliance, must testify before any potential testimony from the Mayor or councilmembers would be required. If, after hearing testimony from the other witnesses, the Court determines that the Mayor and/or councilmembers are still needed, the Court will accommodate their schedules through evening or weekend sessions. For the foregoing reasons, the Court holds the Citys Application in abeyance pending the outcome of other testimony at the evidentiary hearing.(see document for further details) (mba) (Entered: 05/25/2025)"

Carter: The Court has received information indicating the lack of sufficient sanitary facilities to meet the basic needs of the homeless community generally referred to as Skid Row. The Court, moreover, has personally observed these conditions. In this community, there are very few sanitation facilities available, and it appears that no new toilets or sanitation stations have been installed in this area since the advent of the COVID-19 health crisis. If left unchecked, it is likely that the coronavirus will both devastate the vulnerable homeless population and exacerbate the existing public health crisis more generally.Therefore, the Court hereby ORDERS a status report by Defendants City of Los Angeles and County of Los Angeles to address the timeline for the installation of fifty additional toilets and fifty additional sanitation stations in the Skid Row area. The Special Master has reported that a private-sector entity has reserved these needed toilets and sanitation stations, along with a commitment for their installation. All of the toilets and sanitation stations can be installed by Wednesday, April 8, 2020. Fifty of the toilets and twenty-five of the sanitation stations can be installed by Friday, April 3, 2020. However, the parties are invited to acquire and installfrom whatever source they deem appropriatethe needed units within the timeline outlined above.Defendants City of Los Angeles and County of Los Angeles shall file the ordered status report, whether separately or jointly, by 4:00 p.m. on April 1, 2020. The Special Master has been ordered to communicate with the parties regarding these issues. (kd) (Entered: 04/01/2020)"

          "description": "MINUTE ORDER IN CHAMBERS by Judge David O. Carter. Since its previous Order in this case 48 issued April 1, 2020, the Court has continued to observe the conditions of the homeless community generally referred to as Skid Row. The Court attempted to use four of the handwashing stations that were in place prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, and found no water in all four of the tested stations. The Court also attempted to use two of the newly delivered handwashing stations; one was fully functional, and one had soap but no water. Although this sample size is small, the Courts observations raise a strong inference that there are inadequate sanitation facilities available in Skid Row. The Court, accompanied by Los Angeles Police Department officers, also encountered an employee from Andy Gump, Inc., who advised that he was working on instructions from his employer to remove fifty of the companys existing handwashing stations from Skid Row. Although Defendant City of Los Angeles represents, in its April 1 Status Report (Dkt. 50), that the City is deploying sixty new handwashing stations to Skid Row, if fifty of the existing handwashing stations are removed, Skid Row will see a net gain of only ten handwashing stations. This minimal increase supports the inference that the sanitation facilities in Skid Row continue to be inadequate to meet the exigencies of the COVID-19 health crisis. The Court therefore ORDERS a hearing in this matter for Tuesday, April 7, 2020, at 2:00 p.m. In order to comply with the Central District of Californias Continuity of Operations Plan and other public health guidance, the hearing shall be held at the Alexandria Ballrooms, 501 S.

At the April 7, 2020 hearing, Plaintiffs and Intervenors requested, and the Court ORDERED, a status report, which Defendants shall file either jointly or separately by 7:00 p.m. on Monday, April 13, 2020. See document for detailed information. The Court indicated at the previous hearing that it was going to start settlement discussions immediately. The initial discussion concerned recreational vehicles and focused on Skid Row and the surrounding area, up to and including the 10 Freeway. The Court requests that the parties discuss designated areas for recreational vehicles and present possible options to the Court, beginning with Skid Row and the surrounding area. If the parties wish to present a more comprehensive plan covering more of Los Angeles City and County, they are welcome to do so. While the Court will begin settlement discussions with a focus on Skid Row and the surrounding area, the Court intends to quickly broaden the scope of these discussions to encompass more of the City and County. As such, the parties should also be prepared to indicate to the Court when their respective principals will be available for an in-depth settlement discussion. A hearing to discuss these matters shall be held on Tuesday, April 14, 2020 at 10:00 a.m. In order to comply with the Central District of Californias Continuity of Operations Plan and other public health guidance, the hearing shall be held at the Alexandria Ballrooms, 501 S.

Carter: The Project Roomkey program -- a joint undertaking by the City of Los Angeles, the County of Los Angeles, and the State of California -- seeks to secure hotel and motel rooms in the local community to provide safe isolation for the vulnerable homeless population during this unprecedented pandemic. As part of this program, over 250 hotel and motel owners have been contacted by City and County officials, and currently the County of Los Angeles has entered into contracts for over 2500 beds. The implementation of the Room Key Program will require cooperation of state and local government at all levels. The Court, recognizes the powers vested in the executive branch of government at all levels, including officials of the cities in which these hotels and motels are located. Concerns have been expressed by the cities of Lawndale and Bell Gardens regarding how this program is to be implemented. These concerns include, but are not necessarily limited to, the perceived lack of notice and an opportunity to be heard by the cities in which the hotels are located.The County of Los Angeles has requested an emergency status conference. Given the time-sensitive nature of the program and the concerns raised, the Court, to facilitate the discussion of these issues, respectfully invites the attendance of the following individuals at the previously scheduled status conference on Thursday April 23, 2020: City of Bell Gardens: Mayor Alejandra Cortez; City of Lawndale: Mayor Robert Pullen-Miles; Chairperson of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, Kathryn Barger; and Not more than one (1) representative from each party in this action. In order to comply with the Central District of Californias Continuity of Operations Plan and other public health guidance, the status conference shall be held at the Alexandria Ballrooms, 501 S. Spring St., Los Angeles, CA 90013. To ensure social distancing and compliance with public health guidelines, the above participants are urged to limit the number persons appearing on their behalf.

Carter: In the Court's July 8, 2020 Minute Order (the Order) (Dkt. 143), the Court scheduled a Status Conference for 10:00 a.m. on July 16, 2020 (the Status Conference). See Order at 1. However, on Tuesday, July 14, 2020, Los Angeles County public health officials... reported the highest single-day count of COVID-19 cases and related hospitalizations since the pandemic hit. Colleen Shalby, L.A. County Sets Record for COVID-19 Cases, Hospitalizations as Conditions Worsen, L.A. Times (July 14, 2020), https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-14/threat-level-in-los-angeles-increasing-mayor-warns. There have never been more infections or reported daily positive cases in Los Angeles than there are currently. Id. As the Coronavirus pandemic continues to worsen, the Court cannot in good conscience conduct an in-person hearing on the scale of the planned Status Conference, which numerous public officials, staff members, and community activists planned to attend. The Court recognizes that many prospective attendees have been hard at work preparing presentations for the Status Conference, and the Court regrets that they will not be able to share their knowledge with the Court on July 16, 2020 as planned. The Court, however, must prioritize everyone's health and well-being in these precarious times. As such, the Court will look forward to hearing from all of the individuals expected to attend the Status Conference as soon as it can be safely rescheduled in accordance with prevailing public health conditions. The Court hereby POSTPONES the Status Conference, and will reschedule the Status Conference as soon as public health conditions improve to an extent that the Status Conference can be safely held. The City and County of Los Angeles shall still submit the status report described in the Order by 12:00 noon on Wednesday, July 15, 2020. See Order at 2-3. Finally, the parties shall ensure that all individuals listed in the Order and Notices of Errata (Dkts. 144, 146) are notified of the postponement of the Status Conference.

In the Ninth Circuit, however, there is no presumption that the issuance of a preliminary injunction requires an evidentiary hearing; instead, the decision to hold a hearing is left to the sound discretion of the district court. In practical terms, the Court has already held 12 evidentiary hearings, and this preliminary injunction is rooted in the extensive factual record developed through these hearings. After numerous hearings and careful review of the motion and opposition, the Court finds it appropriatein accordance with the emergency conditions of homelessness in Los Angelesto grant preliminary injunctive relief without an additional hearing. To do so is consistent with Ninth Circuit precedent, the text and spirit of Rule 65, and the urgent need for relief this case presents. PLEASE SEE ORDER FOR COMPLETE DETAILS.

The district court's April 20, 2021 preliminary injunction is stayed until June 15, 2021. Appeal Nos. 21-55395, 21-55404 and 21-55408 are consolidated.

The Court concludes that Mr. Moon has not met the standards for either intervention as of right or permissive intervention under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24. The Court thus DENIES Mr. Moon's requests to intervene. Accordingly, all other motions filed by Mr. Moon, including the Motion for Reconsideration, are DENIED as moot. Additionally, for reasons set forth below, the Court ORDERS pre-filing review of any filing action Mr. Moon attempts to take in this action. Accordingly, for any future filings in this action, Adrian D. Moon shall first obtain leave of the Court and: a. shall not exceed three pages, b. shall attach the proposed filing, c. shall explain why the proposed filing is not frivolous, d. shall explain why the proposed filing is not an attack on any previous order entered in this case, and e. shall certify, by affidavit and under the penalty of perjury, that the proposed filing raises a new issue that has not already been rejected by the Court. Failure to comply with any of the above requirements will result in the striking of that filing without further notice. Mr. Moon is forewarned that if he abuses these restricted filing privileges, the Court will take further injunctive action. See minute order for details. (lom) (Entered: 09/30/2022)"

    "summary": "<p>This case is a follow-up to <a href=\"../../../../case/15286/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Mitchell v. City of Los Angeles</em></a>, in which advocates for unhoused people successfully pushed the City of Los Angeles to limit its removal of property in encampments in the Skid Row area of the city. LA Alliance for Human Rights, a community group that primarily represents the interests of business owners, homeowners, and property renters, unsuccessfully attempted to intervene in Mitchell and brought this case after that settlement was reached. LA Alliance filed this action against both the City of Los Angeles and the County of Los Angeles in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on March 10, 2020. LA Alliance and several individuals represented by private counsel alleged federal violations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and constitutional violations of due process, equal protection, and takings. The plaintiffs also brought state law claims alleging violations of mandatory duty, nuisance statutes, the state constitutional takings provision, the California Disabled Persons Act, as well as negligence and waste of public funds and resources. For federal claims and state constitutional claims, the plaintiffs sought injunctive and equitable relief in addition to damages and attorneys&rsquo; fees. For all other state claims, they sought equitable and injunctive relief.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs&rsquo; alleged that the City and County had failed to keep public areas clean and safe by not adequately addressing the homelessness crisis. They claimed that the rights of property owners and renters were impaired by the &ldquo;constant threat of disease and the experience of human waste, trash, and encampments outside their property.&rdquo; Their disability claims were based on the impassibility of sidewalks and the impairment to people who use wheelchairs. The case was assigned to District Judge David O. Carter and Magistrate Judge Karen E. Scott. On March 11, 2020, the parties were directed to participate in an alternative dispute resolution program.</p>\r\n<p>On March 18, 2020, Judge Carter granted an application to intervene from Los Angeles Community Action Network (LA CAN, also sometimes referred to as Cangress) and Los Angeles Catholic Worker (LACW), the organizations that settled with the city in Mitchell v. City of Los Angeles. The intervenors argued that the relief sought by LA Alliance, which largely represented downtown business and property owners and renters, could undermine the settlement agreement reached in Mitchell. In granting the application to intervene, Judge Carter reasoned that the intervenors had a distinct interest as the only parties to represent the interests of unhoused persons. The court also granted an application to intervene from Orange County Catholic Worker (OCCW) on March 17, 2020 because OOCW was party to a consent decree with Orange County regarding the enforcement of anti-camping violations that could have been impacted by the LA Alliance case. The plaintiffs did not oppose either application for intervenor status.</p>\r\n<p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the court ordered sua sponte the installation of fifty additional toilets and sanitation stations in the Skid Row area on April 1, 2020. Three days later, after personally observing conditions in the area and testing the functionality of sanitation stations, Judge Carter determined that the sanitation facilities were inadequate to meet the exigencies of the health crisis posed by the pandemic. After a hearing on the issue, Judge Carter ordered the defendants to submit status reports with plans for maintaining and servicing sanitation facilities.</p>\r\n<p>On April 14, 2020, the Venice Stakeholders Association, a neighborhood association opposed to homeless encampments, sought to intervene on the grounds that the remedy sought by the plaintiffs would directly impact the quality of life of renters and homeowners in Venice. The court denied the request to intervene without comment.</p>\r\n<p>On April 24, 2020, Judge Carter appointed Michele Martinez to serve as Special Master alongside the Honorable James L. Smith, who had previously been appointed Special Master.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The parties were actively engaged in settlement conversations but failed to enter into an initial agreement due to a long-standing dispute between the City and County over responsibility for costs related to unhoused persons. As a result, Judge Carter issued a preliminary injunction sua sponte on May 22, 2020, in accordance with the Ninth Circuit&rsquo;s decision in <a href=\"https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&amp;serNum=2047897919&amp;pubNum=0000506&amp;originatingDoc=I43442cf09e5d11eab2c3c7d85ec85a54&amp;refType=RP&amp;originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem&amp;ppcid=c4221fd6ae244fb9a2115edbcd272c1c&amp;contextData=(sc.Keycite)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Martin v. City of Boise</a>, 920 F.3d 584, which concluded that the Eighth Amendment &ldquo;bars a city from prosecuting people criminally for sleeping outside on public property when those people have no home or other shelter to go to.&rdquo; Judge Carter reasoned that it was likely that if citing a homeless person for sleeping outside is cruel and unusual punishment, then it was &ldquo;likely also cruel and unusual to act with such indifference that an individual experiencing homelessness is forced to take shelter in an inherently hazardous location.&rdquo; As such, Judge Carter ordered that unhoused people living near overpasses, underpasses, and ramps be offered alternative housing options with adequate sanitation, security and COVID-testing. The parties subsequently requested a mediator, which the court granted, appointing Judge Birotte to mediate. On June 18, 2020, the City agreed to provide 6,700 beds for unhoused people within 18 months, after which the court vacated the preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>The Latino Coalition of Los Angeles and Pastor Josue Tiguila submitted an additional request to intervene on July 17, 2020. The argued that the Latinx population was underreported in homelessness data and that Latinx interests were not being adequately represented in the case. The court denied this request, indicating that it was not practical to have an intervenor for a specific ethnic group.</p>\r\n<p>After extensive negotiations failed to produce a resolution of all claims in the case, the City filed a motion to dismiss for lack of standing and failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted, and the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. The district court granted the motion for preliminary injunction on April 20, 2021 and denied the motion to dismiss on May 11, 2021. The court ordered, among other relief: the escrow of $1 billion to address the homelessness crisis, offers of shelter or housing to all unhoused individuals in Skid Row within 180 days, and numerous audits and reports. Judge Carter detailed the County and City&rsquo;s &ldquo;historical constitutional violations&rdquo; stemming from structural racism. 2021 WL 1546235. The defendants and intervenor LA CAN appealed and requested a stay, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they were alleging harms to third parties. Judge Carter denied the stay, finding that there was a plethora of people experiencing homelessness amongst the plaintiffs. 2021 WL 4713179.</p>\r\n<p>The Ninth Circuit vacated the injunction on September 23, 2021 on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing. Writing for a panel of three judges, Judge Jacqueline H. Nguyen found that the district court abused its discretion in relying on evidence outside the record to find facts supporting standing and relying on claims that the plaintiffs had not asserted. The court awarded costs to the appellants. 14 F.4th 947. The Ninth Circuit remanded to the district court, and settlement negotiations continued.</p>\r\n<p>On December 3, 2021, the defendants filed motions to dismiss for lack of standing and failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted. In response, the court ordered a mandatory settlement conference. The plaintiffs reached an agreement to settle claims against the City on April 1, 2022. The parties agreed to a five-year settlement agreement to increase housing opportunities. The City committed to creating sufficient housing to accommodate 60% of unsheltered persons experiencing homelessness within the City. After conducting public hearings, the court approved the proposed settlement on June 14, 2022 and retained jurisdiction to monitor and enforce the terms of the agreement</p>\r\n<p>Intervenors LACW, LA CAN, and OCCW opposed the settlement and filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit on July 13, 2022. On July 15, 2022, LA Alliance filed a second amended and supplemental complaint.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 16, 2022, the plaintiffs and the City announced that they had reached a preliminary agreement and requested a stay in litigation while the parties finalized the terms. The City tentatively agreed to pay $236 million to fund increased services, outreach, and interim housing for the most vulnerable people experiencing homelessness. The intervenors LACW, LA CAN, and OCCW filed a statement of non-opposition to the settlement between the plaintiff and the City on October 27, 2022. On April 20, 2023, however, the court denied the settlement, finding it to be inadequate. The district court further denied the City&rsquo;s motions, in a minute order on May 2, 2023, to certify the April 20 order for interlocutory appeal and to stay the case pending that interlocutory appeal.</p>\r\n<p>As a result, the City filed another motion to dismiss on May 3, 2023. On May 5, 2023, the court issued an order setting the scheduling conference for May 9, 2023. On June 29, 2023, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the defendant City&rsquo;s motion to dismiss. The property-owner plaintiff&rsquo;s claims for violation of mandatory duty under &sect; 170000 were dismissed with prejudice, but the defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss all other claims was denied.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 28, 2023, the parties attended a status conference, and the court later continued the hearing on September 18. The parties represented to Judge Birotte and Special Master Martinez that they had &ldquo;reached an agreement in principle,&rdquo; were to &ldquo;negotiate the few remaining terms,&rdquo; and would represent the proposed settlement to the court by September 25, 2023. &nbsp;The parties jointly submitted their settlement agreement to the court on September 25, 2023. On September 28, 2023, the parties submitted a joint submission of a second addendum to the settlement agreement and stipulation for voluntary dismissal with prejudice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Under the terms of the settlement, the City was, by 2026, to: (1) fund 3,000 new mental health and substance use disorder beds by 2026; and (2) make available 450 new subsidies for Adult Residential Facilities (&ldquo;ARFs&rdquo;) and Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly (&ldquo;RCFEs&rdquo;) to serve individuals with mental illness who are at risk of becoming homeless. Judge Jay C. Gandhi (ret). was appointed as monitor of the City&rsquo;s compliance with the settlement, and the City had quarterly reporting obligations to the plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>The court held a hearing on September 28, 2023, and the following day, Judge Carter granted the order to dismiss with prejudice plaintiffs&rsquo; cause of action against the City in the second amended and supplemental complaint. The court ordered that it would retain jurisdiction until June 30, 2027 for the purpose of overseeing and enforcing the settlement agreement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 1, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted the motion to voluntarily dismiss the appeal to it. On December 14, 2023, the court held a dispute resolution hearing regarding the City milestones. In its first status report submitted to the court on January 16, 2024, the City reported that it met the or exceeded its obligations under the settlement agreement by developing over 900 mental health and substance use disorder beds and providing over 100 new subsidies for ARFs and RCFEs. On February 7, 2024, however, plaintiffs filed a motion for order of non-compliance and sanctions, arguing that the City willfully violated the settlement agreement and failed to meet its obligations. The plaintiffs argued that the City obstructed efforts to establish encampment milestones and created fewer beds than it promised to. Specifically, the plaintiffs argued that the City had a milestone of creating 3,700 new beds in the previous fiscal year, but that it only created 1,748 new beds. The plaintiffs asked the court to impose sanctions on the City for being in non-compliance with the settlement agreement for a 447-day period, including paying $100,000 for each week of non-compliance to plaintiffs, which would equal about $6,400,000.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 29, 2024, Special Master Michele Martinez issued an Independent Monitor Report for Year One of the settlement agreement. Martinez&rsquo;s report concluded that although the City created new beds for homeless individuals, it did not meet its targets and it faced challenges related to funding, transparency, and equitable distribution of housing solutions throughout the City. On April 8, 2024, the court held a status conference regarding the defendant&rsquo;s progress in complying with their settlement agreement obligations. Judge Carter confirmed the firm Alvarez and Marsal as auditors to evaluate the City&rsquo;s compliance with the settlement agreement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 15 and July 15, 2024, the defendant&rsquo;s quarterly status report, stating that it had again met or exceeded all its obligations under the settlement agreement during this reporting period.</p>\r\n<p>On September 4, 2024, the plaintiffs filed a motion for enforcement of settlement compliance.

    "summary_short": "The plaintiffs in this case alleged that the City and County had failed to keep public areas clean and safe by not adequately addressing the homelessness crisis. District Court Judge Carter took an active role in the case, ordering sua sponte in response to the COVID-19 pandemic the installation of additional sanitation measures in the Skid Row area. Following judicial involvement, the City eventually agreed to provide additional beds for unhoused people. After extensive but failed negotiations, the district court granted a preliminary injunction in April 2021, but the Ninth Circuit vacated that injunction on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing. In April 2022, the plaintiffs reached a settlement agreement with the City that would increase housing opportunities for unhoused people - that agreement is pending on appeal before the Ninth Circuit. Additionally, the plaintiffs reached a tentative agreement with the County, but the district court rejected the agreement on the grounds that it was inadequate. As of November 22, 2024, this case is ongoing.",

This Motion is set for hearing on January 24, 2022, at 8:30 a.m., \n7 before the Honorable David O. Carter in the United States District Court, Central \n8 District of California, Western Division, located at 411 West Fourth Street, \n9 Courtroom 9D, Santa Ana, California 92701-4516.  \n10 The Motion is well-taken.  Under Rule 12(b)(1), dismissal for lack of subject \n11 matter jurisdiction should be granted because Plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged \n12 Article III standing to assert their claims against the County.  Plaintiffs have not \n13 alleged cognizable injuries that are “fairly traceable” to the alleged conduct of the \n14 County.  Plaintiffs’ claims are also not redressable because the broad and \n15 unmanageable injunction that they seek cannot be issued by this Court, as doing so \n16 would violate the separation of powers.  The Court’s Article III power does not \n17 permit intrusive intervention into legislative prerogatives about how to spend limited \n18 resources to serve the public.  Plaintiffs raise generalized grievances, not an injury \n19 sufficient to confer standing. \n20 In addition, under Rule 12(b)(6), Plaintiffs have not stated any of their federal \n21 or state law claims against the County.  Plaintiffs assert federal claims against the \n22 County under 42 U.S.C. section 1983 and allege violations of the Fourteenth \n23 Amendment to the United States Constitution.  But these claims fail because \n24 Plaintiffs have not alleged that (1) the County discriminated against Plaintiffs with \n25 deliberate indifference, (2) the County infringed on any constitutionally cognizable \n26 right of Plaintiffs without adequate process, (3) the County affirmatively placed any \n27 Plaintiff in imminent risk of bodily harm, or had a special relationship with them, or \n28 (4) the County could be liable, even if any of the above had been alleged, because \n  \n542564.3   Case No. 2:20-cv-02291 DOC-KES\nDEFENDANT COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES’ NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 370   Filed 12/03/21   Page 3 of 4   Page ID #:9543\n \n1 the harm was caused by an official County policy, practice or custom under Monell. \n2 Plaintiffs have added the County to their disability discrimination claims \n3 under the California Disabled Persons Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and \n4 Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, all stemming from sidewalk blockages by \n5 homeless encampments that allegedly impeded Plaintiffs Van Scoy’s and Suarez’s \n6 free passage by wheelchair.  But the FAC alleges no new facts showing that any of \n7 the challenged sidewalk obstruction occurred on County property.  And Plaintiffs do \n8 not—and cannot—allege that the obstructed City sidewalks constitute a County \n9 “program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,” as required to state a \n10 Section 504 claim.  The federal disability claims also fail for the independent reason \n11 that Plaintiffs Van Scoy and Suarez have not alleged that they were prevented from \n12 using sidewalks “by reason of their disabilities.”   \n13 Plaintiffs’ state law claims fail as well.  Plaintiffs cannot invoke state statutes \n14 that grant the County discretion over how to spend funds and provide services to \n15 combat homelessness, and they have failed to plead the essential elements of their \n16 claims in any event.  The negligence claim fails because Plaintiffs do not allege any \n17 breach of a statutory duty by the County.  The nuisance claim fails because \n18 Plaintiffs do not allege any nuisance that was created by the County.  Indeed, \n19 Plaintiffs admit the County has made significant efforts to abate the issues where it \n20 has authority to do so.  Further, the common law claims fail for an additional \n21 reason—the County and its policy-making officials are immune from suit under the \n22 California Government Code. \n23 This Motion is made following the conference of counsel pursuant to L.R. 7-3 \n24 that took place on November 23, 2021.  (Declaration of Mira Hashmall ¶ 37 & Ex. \n25 36.)

Acuity will be determined according to accepted industry \nstandards, including through the use of an assessment tool, such as the Vulnerability Index - Service \nPrioritization Decision Assistance Tool (VI-SPDAT, or other similar assessment tool such as the CES \nSurvey Packet or Next Step Tool), by qualified outreach or clinical staff.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 408-1   Filed 04/01/22   Page 2 of 5   Page ID\n#:11627\nLA ALLIANCE v. CITY OF LA, ET AL \nCase No. 20-CV-02291 DOC (KES) SETTLEMENT PROPOSAL TERM SHEET  \n \n  City agrees to pursue an approach of equitably distributing housing and shelter \nfacilities for PEH within the City. \n \nCity may provide incentives and/or benefits for Council Districts that create more \nhousing or shelter opportunities than needed to accommodate 60% of City Shelter \nAppropriate unsheltered PEH in their districts. \n \n3.  Street Engagement  \nCity will offer shelter or housing to persons experiencing homelessness in \nalignment with its Street Engagement Strategy and consistent with public regulation \nordinances and constitutional precedents.  No enforcement action shall be taken \nagainst any individual unless that individual has first been offered an opportunity for \nshelter or to relocate consistent with applicable statutes.  City reserves the right, in its \nsole discretion, to revise or amend its Street Engagement Strategy, LAMC 41.18, or any \nsimilar ordinance, regulation, or protocol consistent with applicable constitutional \nprecedents.   \n \nCouncil District-wide Engagement \nOnce there are sufficient opportunities to accommodate 60% of City Shelter \nAppropriate unsheltered PEH in a Council District, the City may provide notice that it \nintends to implement public regulation ordinances within that entire District as to \nindividuals who decline an offer of shelter or decline to move to an alternative location. If \na party files a written objection with the Court within five days of the notice, the Court \nshall schedule a status conference to take place within two days, or as soon as is \npracticable, to resolve the objection.  If no objection is filed, or if the Court resolves the \nobjection in favor of the City, City may apply public regulation ordinances within that \nDistrict consistent with this Agreement.  Even after the City creates adequate and \nappropriate housing and shelter opportunities for 60% of City Shelter Appropriate PEH \nin a Council District, no enforcement action shall be taken against any individual \nsuspected of violating a public regulation ordinance unless that individual has first been \noffered adequate and appropriate shelter or housing or to relocate consistent with \napplicable statutes, except for time/manner/place regulations (such as LAMC 41.18 or \nsimilar ordinances) which may be enforced at any time.   \n  \nCity-wide Engagement \nOnce the City has sufficient opportunities to accommodate 60% of City Shelter \nAppropriate unsheltered PEH in the City, the City may provide notice that it intends to \nimplement public regulation ordinances throughout the City as to individuals who \ndecline an offer of shelter or decline to move to an alternative location.

If no objection is filed, or if the Court resolves the objection in \nfavor of City, City may implement public regulation ordinances within City, consistent \nwith this Agreement.  Even after the City creates adequate and appropriate housing and \nshelter opportunities for 60% of the number of City Shelter Appropriate PEH within the \nCity, no enforcement action shall be taken against any individual suspected of violating \na public regulation ordinance unless that individual has first been offered adequate and \nappropriate shelter or housing or to relocate consistent with applicable statutes, except \nfor time/manner/place regulations (such as LAMC 41.18 or similar ordinances) which \nmay be enforced at any time. \n \n4.  Milestones \nThe City will develop deadlines and targets for the City’s creation of shelter \nand/or housing, and encampment reduction, and will provide those deadlines and \ntargets to Plaintiffs. The parties will work to resolve any concerns about those deadlines \nand targets, and will consult with the Court for resolution, if necessary. The City will \nmake its best efforts to comply with established deadlines and targets.   \n \n5.  Jurisdiction \nThe Court will retain jurisdiction to monitor the parties’ compliance with and \nenforce the terms of this Agreement. \n \n6.  Dispute Resolution Process \n  The parties agree to design a dispute resolution process that will allow a person \nexperiencing homelessness to submit a complaint to the Court or special master \nconcerning an offer of shelter or notice provided under this Agreement. \n \n7.  Status Updates \n  The City will provide regular status updates to the Court (at least quarterly) \nregarding its progress with this Agreement.  In addition, the parties agree to engage a \nmutually agreed-upon third party to provide data collection and analysis and regular \npublic reports on the City’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement.  \n \n8.  Funding \n  Funding of housing and shelter opportunities created by City shall be at City’s \nsole discretion.

Nearly two years after this case was filed, and after hundreds of \n3  millions of dollars have poured into Los Angeles through federal and state \n4  pandemic relief, the devastation on the streets and the impact on both the housed \n5  and unhoused communities have only gotten worse.  LA Alliance for Human \n6  Rights—of which both housed and unhoused are members—and Plaintiffs named \n7  herein filed this lawsuit to change the trajectory of the homelessness for the \n8  benefit of both communities. \n9  2.  The mortality rate of homeless individuals who die on the streets has \n10  leapt to five per day.  That’s equivalent to a 9/11 event every two years, or a \n1 \n1\nP  47 11  Sandy Hook school shooting once a week.

Plaintiffs filed this case to provide the City of Los Angeles (the \n2  “City”) and County of Los Angeles (the “County”) an opportunity to make a \n3  different choice—to work together under the auspices of this Court to overcome \n4  the finger-pointing and paralysis that have plagued this issue for decades.  For a \n5  year, City and County politicians paraded to Court, professing a desire to end this \n6  crisis, and work with plaintiffs and the Court to reach a global resolution.  The \n7  City and County have had every opportunity to reach a global resolution and take \n8  urgent action on the burgeoning human crisis of homelessness.  Instead, the City \n9  and County continue their antics of blame-shifting and in-fighting over \n10  comprehensive solutions.  \n1 \n1\nP  47 11  4.

And \n18  the number of those suffering has climbed with the increased prevalence of \n19  illegal narcotics, which are being used to self-medicate or are the cause of the \n20  mental decline in the first place.  Available drug treatment beds are likewise \n21  woefully unobtainable while the drug addiction crisis rages, and our communities \n22  are ravaged.  The County’s silos of care make it nearly impossible for anyone \n23  with a comorbidity (that is, suffering from more than one ailment—for example \n24  mental illness and drug addiction, which often go hand-in-hand) to obtain help.  \n25  Los Angeles is one of only two counties in the state that does not have an \n26  integrated administration to address individuals suffering with both mental health \n27  and substance use disorders.

Meanwhile the City, who has the primary land-use obligation to its \n5  constituents, struggles—and fails—to balance the needs of the housed and \n6  unhoused.  The near-exclusive focus on building permanent supportive housing \n7  through Proposition HHH (“HHH”) in the last five years has led to lethal under-\n8  funding of emergency and interim shelter solutions which has in turn left \n9  thousands to decline and die on the streets without support from County services.  \n10  Those individuals in turn, without services or shelter, languish and decline, \n1 \n1\nP  47 11  ultimately requiring increased long-term services as a result of unnecessary years \nL 6-\nertus, Landes & Umhofer, L1990SBD.,S705  OUTH UNDY R UITE A,CA90025 LOS NGELES  310-826-4700;F310-82ONE  ACSIMILE  1111123456      stashphdeead nriCetti diost6 yuno. ba paljen e9rdca, t6tCT it3noho3g rut o hbncueetoygd sh hstios  nht rh arawnoivsdhre sl a ip btot rieafgoe lavtlnh tip isefoai uosnrnttn,ri d eaeoeessfd  t ha. m a orcapecisenoudsrl dttwr ioenaafgs m a atno  ss  aeiaggr vrnreei coceeefm snf.etu5 n ct ut1o rr,uee1r a0tcc 0ofhi oloeipfdne  gtrbh,ae ewttsiwoeitn eh,e  nan  \np H\nS EP\nL\nTE 17  beds were already in the works through the Mayor’s “A Bridge Housing” \n18  program, 834 of these beds are permanent supportive housing projects which had \n19  been long-planned, and an undefined number (likely over one thousand) are \n20  “rapid rehousing” vouchers which don’t add to the bed inventory (but do help \n21  prevent homelessness).

Shelter remains unattainable for \n4  most, services are inaccessible for most, and streets are unbearable for all. \n5  7.  Homeless encampments are entrenched throughout the City and \n6  County.  With increased population density, unlimited property accumulation has \n7  fostered a proliferation of flea-infested rats and other vermin, which are largely \n8  responsible for the recent outbreaks of medieval diseases.

The 1980s and 1990s, with the crack epidemic and simultaneous \n2  cuts to the welfare system, brought in true and enduring homelessness, with \n3  encampments springing up on sidewalks and criminals preying on the \n4  vulnerable.53  Then-mayor Tom Bradley opened an urban campground along the \n5  L.A. River, but it was soon closed due to terrible living conditions.  At various \n6  times groups have placed portable toilets in key encampment locations, only to \n7  have the city remove them when they became magnets for prostitution and drug \n8  use.  In the early 1990s, as a settlement of litigation between the City and County, \n9  Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (“LAHSA”), a joint-powers authority, \n10  was created to oversee the City and County’s homeless response.  The aim was \n1 \n1\nP  47 11  more accountability, but ultimately it has resulted in an accountability deficit.  \nL 6-\nertus, Landes & Umhofer, L1990SBD.,S705  OUTH UNDY R UITE A,CA90025 LOS NGELES  310-826-4700;F310-82ONE  ACSIMILE  1111123456      5Lrwe6oac.sye1  nA1itn,ln 3 ytsgh3 ebea.n ltee sersient TiMg vahuemual anate tridnece ediabpfeseiad chol i atrtCo  vio soipto dhprreoea i rhrnp tia ribpcorieuuvta lbisasslir iitmolctyi nnar saigrg pk,(h p“estLdalser -.beeAoynpf. -tiMsn wiigng.aC, ny toh.a.” reg ) S el,ly e isbticeinugtcgitito o ioionunnn s 4lp  y14hu 1.iab1s.fl81ttioe8(crdr  y ra)fi  nugohdlhfal  t sstsw e ocotf i on \np H\nS EP\nL\nTE 17  consideration and vote by City Council in every single area designated as such \n18  and only, for non-sensitive areas, after proof of serious injury, crime, or fires.54  \n19  56.11 prohibits, among other things, storage of “excess personal property” \n20  meaning property which cumulatively exceeds 60 gallons in a public area.55  \n21   \n53 See Kempkens, supra note 50, https://www.laweekly.com/l-a-s-\n22  homelessness-crisis-how-did-we-get-here/. \n54 LOS ANGELES MUN.

City of \n24  Los Angeles, discussed infra.  Its express stated purpose was to “balance the \nneeds of the residents and public at large to access clean and sanitary public areas \n25  with the needs of the individuals, who have no other alternatives for the storage \nof personal property, to retain access to a limited of personal property in public \n26  areas.”  Unsurprisingly, unhappy activists have challenged the new amendment, \nfirst as applied to those living in Skid Row (Mitchell v. City of Los Angeles, 16-\n27  CV-01750 SJO JPR) and now city-wide (Garcia v. City of Los Angeles, 2:19-CV-\n06182 DSF PLA).  The Garcia court issued an injunction against its enforcement, \n28  recently upheld by the Ninth Circuit.  Garcia v.

The language in Martin does not provide clear \n20  guidance for cities struggling with sizable homeless populations—in some \n21  passages, Martin suggests that there must be enough beds for everyone before \n22  anyone is cited for sleeping on a sidewalk, while other aspects of Martin indicate \n23  that individuals “who do have access to adequate temporary shelter” but “choose \n24  not to use it” may be prosecuted without reference to the community.  Id. at n.8.   \n25  38.  Regardless of how Martin is interpreted, its clear effect is to tie \n26  enforcement of public regulation ordinances to the provision of shelter.

But instead the City’s and County’s \n2  approach to the Martin decision has been a lack of both shelters and regulation.   \n3  39.   While homelessness has now exploded beyond the boundaries of Skid \n4  Row—resulting in public outcry at encampments, crime, and squalor in \n5  neighborhoods which previously could ignore the devastation—the most heavily \n6  impacted area is still without a doubt the area of Containment.  City and County \n7  policies continue to concentrate persons experiencing homelessness in Skid Row, \n8  creating horribly dangerous conditions for unhoused individuals and others living \n9  in the area.  Affordable housing and services are still heavily concentrated in Skid \n10  Row, while development of these housing or services in other areas can take years, \n1 \n1\nP  47 11  even for by-right projects.

This the only such area zoned for this specific purpose in \n22  the entire City and County (and in fact the nation).

The City and the County have done \n18  little to produce housing in the very low- or low-income categories.  For \n19  example, in the last reporting period by the County (all unincorporated areas), \n20  from 2014 to 2019 it produced a paltry 891 units of very low and low income \n21  housing in an unincorporated area of over 1 million residents.  In fact, in the \n22  entire unincorporated county only 6,157 housing units in total were produced.  \n23  Los Angeles is now ranked as the most unaffordable city in the country, with \n24  over 60% of tenants paying more than 30% of their household income for rent \n25  and over 30% of tenants severely rent-burdened, paying more than 50% of their \n26  income for rent.  Both City and County have failed to meet their housing \n27  requirements for very low, low, and moderate-income permits.

In an ongoing effort to make City sidewalks more \n21  accessible, city workers in Skid Row ironically move encampments to create \n22  cutouts for disabled access, and then immediately permit encampments to return \n23  fully blocking the very sidewalk they just purportedly made more accessible.  \n24  The freeway overpasses near the Los Angeles Civic Center are now so packed \n25  that it is difficult for an able-bodied individual to walk past without stepping in \n26  the street, and impossible for those who need the assistance of wheelchairs and \n27  walkers.  \n28 \n \n38 \n  AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 361   Filed 11/01/21   Page 39 of 113   Page ID\n#:9286\n \n1  61.  The sidewalk problem directly affects businesses that are accessed \n2  by sidewalks.  This prevents disabled customers from reaching businesses, but \n3  also deters able-bodied customers who seek to access their businesses or abandon \n4  some businesses in favor of more accessible ones.  Businesses are collectively \n5  spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on increased sanitation and security \n6  measures while struggling to maintain employees and tenants.  Both business \n7  owners and residents of the area are thus subject to substantial and unreasonable \n8  interference with their enjoyment of their property.  Indeed, the streets and \n9  sidewalks of Skid Row have been rendered unusable because of human waste, \n10  garbage, and encampments that the City has allowed to persist. \n1 \n1\nP  47 11  F.

The environmental impact of fires arising out of homelessness is \n4  also of great concern.  Fires originating in homeless encampments are not just a \n5  potential threat—they have actually destroyed thousands of acres of brush and \n6  wildlife.  The sweeping footprints of the City and County of Los Angeles \n7  encompass vast amounts of undeveloped land, full of dry brush and other readily \n8  combustible material.  Such areas are an attractive location for many homeless \n9  persons wishing to reside “off the grid” and the combination of propane-fueled \n10  cooking fires and bootlegged electricity in untended conditions is a recipe for, \n1 \n1\nP  47 11  and indeed has already resulted in, massively destructive fires. \nL 6-\nertus, Landes & Umhofer, L1990SBD.,S705  OUTH UNDY R UITE A,CA90025 LOS NGELES  310-826-4700;F310-82ONE  ACSIMILE  1111123456      Galraensc.d te  2nb0tulP6 syy7ir neo.o aevprsesesr erAw tsthny.i tro  heVDt ehlao oemlwfrut in celcltasoio soanwunnvan desl tqrL ysBu oioaousfrn s eAits nh,fn eeehg esuhestn oleoedmsfs r  aeeohrdlfaeefsssi   cAsoeenfxf  efspnsepeescarw ticcee redrni esu csienstda diu sea rrt a rhcneeont snva,s aiatslrnsuuadecn  touciofne n tpoi.lrv1 o0ep7r e  Ttrhthyea  t \np H\nS EP\nL\nTE 17  renaissance is now in jeopardy due to the homelessness crisis.

Yet the homelessness crisis persists and threatens all of these: general \n3  public welfare and health threatened by disease, rats, and toxic waste permeating \n4  public areas.  Law and public order are being threatened by the increased crime \n5  both on and by homeless individuals, driven by rampant drug addiction and its \n6  concomitant gang and property-related crimes.  Unchecked waste and disease \n7  affect the sheltered and unsheltered alike living in or near these areas.   \n8  71.  The County, as the provider of last resort, has the additional \n9  obligation to “relieve and support all incompetent, poor, indigent persons, and \n10  those incapacitated by age, disease, or accident . . . when such persons are not \n1 \n1\nP  47 11  supported and relieved by their relatives or friends, by their own means, or by \nL 6-\nertus, Landes & Umhofer, L1990SBD.,S705  OUTH UNDY R UITE A,CA90025 LOS NGELES  310-826-4700;F310-82ONE  ACSIMILE  1111123456      s§cwatia1aedr7tle efa0,a n 0hard0eon  .sdsa p e nTairdtsvha siehlics sape topsaupr nrt ipoocno eteah sslteeols r   oa otshnfft eia imat tsplel ae n otooiernfpe  pgltdher ySi eov  eapfacn tettedhio o eipdnn lis sest1t taio7rttefue0s  t0tsiihn0oee d nni .ssse”t .et”a o dt C e  C“t abhpla.yerl o.rW  pevWorieodfelv,efl .ia f fd.&no i&dnr  I g ptnIo rnsa otspp.tt rpe.Co crCmootiopdoodrentie ea,   tteh e \np H\nS EP\nL\nTE 17  §10000.

The result is readily observable: squalor, \n20  lawlessness, disease, and death. \n21  I.  Crucial Funds that Could Alleviate this Man-Made Disaster are \n22  Tragically Misspent and Misdirected \n23  72.  The challenges presented by the homelessness crisis persist despite \n24  massive expenditures of taxpayer dollars.  For the 2020-2021 fiscal year, the City \n25  of Los Angeles has approved nearly $1 billion to be used towards homelessness \n26  relief, which at first glance represents almost 10% of the City’s $11 billion \n27  budget and a nearly 500% increase from the $176 million budgeted to address \n28 \n \n43 \n  AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 361   Filed 11/01/21   Page 44 of 113   Page ID\n#:9291\n \n1  homelessness in 2019-2020.108  However, with $281 million dedicated from \n2  federal Covid-19 relief, $362 million from Proposition HHH funds, and $150 \n3  million dedicated from unused funds the year before, the increase isn’t nearly as \n4  stark as it seems at first glance, as “only” $162 million comes from the general \n5  fund.  Still, with nearly $1 billion dedicated in a single year, Los Angeles could \n6  realistically provide a bed for every unsheltered person on the streets, \n7  immediately alleviating the suffering and human tragedy unfolding today.  But \n8  rather than dedicate the funds to saving lives, the City is dedicating $362 million \n9  to only 89 permanent supportive housing projects, $200 million for “affordable \n10  housing, homeless prevention, eviction defense, and other homeless services,” \n1 \n1\nP  47 11  and the rest to a spattering of other increased services.

In Los Angeles County there are only 22.7 beds per 100,000 \n8  individuals.”141  In response, the Department of Mental Health (DMH) conducted \n9  an investigation and identified “significant gaps in inpatient treatment beds, \n10  residential beds, shelter beds, and respite homes across all ages” including an \n1 \n1\nP  47 11  “estimate of 3,000 additional subacute beds needed,” “significant gaps in \nL 6-\nertus, Landes & Umhofer, L1990SBD.,S705  OUTH UNDY R UITE A,CA90025 LOS NGELES  310-826-4700;F310-82ONE  ACSIMILE  1111123456      acfiunosopprs-  itoaasotclti licea nuan gygrt e repbiasneer,go d”t  psod“ l fnieasoo cowr c rlpehdosaeecstnari sles  ,tenc”hcth es“uiy nlre deoalri  rigeSenniU pbl’easlDea tii v nfe(iospnnuratg  btcc isioaentnrnapestna, e cptrrieseve ysauncutsthol ectrii aasdnrhtigresii ,poci ne…r bd spepewedero)isc tp,irh”ael  elsw“l iynbda oeeifttioni nnertg ingta ho dlp ouitessrgrceehiha o wtadmrisgte heon dft   \np H\nS EP\nL\nTE 17  to the street and perpetuating homelessness.”142  In short, courts are reticent to \n18  declare a person conserved because there’s nowhere for them to go, and the \n19  system designed to address these issues is massively overburdened.

If a person is brought in while in crisis but \n3  there are no beds for them, often they are released back on the street.  This \n4  dynamic repeats itself throughout Los Angeles.  The report goes on to document \n5  “limited access to urgent care for MH (mental health), SUD and services to \n6  people with co-occurring disorders at all levels of care,” “MH and SUD treatment \n7  is not integrated” (the so-called “silos of care”), and “to access care you have to \n8  ‘win the lottery,’ have a chronic level of need that requires hospitalization, or \n9  become incarcerated.

Mr. Gaulding suffers from \n22  both mental and physical health issues, including bipolar disorder, severe \n23  depression, and hypertension.  The time he spent without regular shelter \n24  exacerbated those issues: he rarely was able to sleep more than a few hours at a \n25  time, he was exposed to the heat in summer and the cold and rain in winter.  He \n26  took illegal drugs to self-medicate, both for his mental health issues and to cope \n27  with the stress of living on the streets; the narcotics further intensified his chronic \n28  illnesses.

But the only available housing was on Skid Row, which is rife with \n8  conditions which threaten his sobriety and safety.

To \n4  avoid dangerous areas and altercations in Skid Row, Mr. Harpt used a set path \n5  well out of his way to get to and from work.  A couple years ago, he was robbed \n6  outside of his house in broad daylight—the offender pulled a knife and stole his \n7  bicycle.  This incident and the violent altercations he observed on the streets of \n8  Skid Row caused Mr. Harpt to fear for his own safety.

Before becoming homeless, Mr. \n5  Jarrell served in the Air Force, including 8 years in Iraq, before getting injured in \n6  combat.  As a result of his service, he now suffers from post-traumatic stress \n7  disorder (“PTSD”), which adversely effects his ability to survive on the streets \n8  and acquire services.  Living on the streets with his issues is incredibly difficult.  \n9  The area is violent, he hears gun shots often and it triggers his PTSD. He has \n10  physical injuries as a result of his service which are exacerbated by living on the \n1 \n1\nP  47 11  street.  \nL 6-\nertus, Landes & Umhofer, L1990SBD.,S705  OUTH UNDY R UITE A,CA90025 LOS NGELES  310-826-4700;F310-82ONE  ACSIMILE  1111123456      hrfweoeaco swed ia avs setC1a  t1eomo6iultpd.hn s eth yrhMe  ehw cr or.oo euJrucskaleirdenirr vgef eail lnods drkc  ua eshpmedoor ehuvn isi tmchionei  sgsSt o. ka a  risIndrnidig  vR fnsaao elca wrth v,c a iotacvhfneeettse  rs hratt hecothaetp,ler ptea hedn.  deb dB ae bhtunheitecs  of Maiifudt srhse,.ein  gsJ tw aeiftrnihyrreeos wrlt al hw alhe sri a tfeshel io yebuefeg,tc  hataontu  ds e \np H\nS EP\nL\nTE 17  subsequently stolen.  The other promised services also remain elusive.  The \n18  process for obtaining services he needs like SSI, general relief, and mental health \n19  treatment is arduous and he is frequently told to wait, come back later, or that he \n20  must contact someone different.  These complications to getting services are \n21  incredibly frustrating and due to his PTSD causes him to withdraw, preventing \n22  him from completing the application process and frustrating his prior efforts.  He \n23  is eligible for SSI and a veteran affairs (“VA”) pension, but due to his identity \n24  theft issues he hasn’t been able to work through the barriers to receiving it.  He \n25  often feels hopeless and like it is not even worth trying.  For months at a time, he \n26  accepts that he will never leave Skid Row and find a better life for him and his \n27  second wife, with whom he shares a tent. \n28 \n \n81 \n  AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 361   Filed 11/01/21   Page 82 of 113   Page ID\n#:9329\n \n1  117.  Mr. Jarrell’s search for help has been further complicated by how \n2  functional he is and how well he has adapted to being homeless.  In his \n3  experience, services are reserved for those suffering from severe addiction or \n4  mental or physical health issues.  He finds he is not “homeless enough” or “sick \n5  enough” and gets put in the back of the line for help.  Because he can manage his \n6  often-debilitating PTSD and does not have a severe drug addiction or physical \n7  health issue, he has a much harder time getting help.  Mr. Jarrell is frustrated that \n8  the City’s and County’s focus is on those in the direst circumstances, leaving \n9  him, and many others like him, who are most likely to escape homelessness, \n10  without help or services.   \n1 \n1\nP  47 11  118.

For Mr. Jarrell, this experience demonstrates two things.  First, that many \n20  homeless people on Skid Row are unable to attain the services they need due to \n21  their own limitations and the complicated system that the City and County have \n22  designed.  Second the workers running these systems are often barriers rather \n23  than facilitators of the care that individuals living on Skid Row needs.  \n24  119.  Mr. Jarrell was living on Skid Row during the Covid-19 crisis.  It \n25  was months before anyone from the city informed Mr. Jarrell and others about \n26  the pandemic or how to protect themselves.  As a result, Covid-19 moved quickly \n27  through the homeless population while little to no aid was offered.  He saw many \n28  people sick, coughing, and even dying.  As a population, they felt ignored, and it \n \n82 \n  AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 361   Filed 11/01/21   Page 83 of 113   Page ID\n#:9330\n \n1  was clear that the rate of sickness and death far exceeded what was being \n2  reported.  This experience exemplified how little the City and County care about \n3  a population that is already struggling just to survive.    \n4  120.  These examples paint a picture of what life on Skid Row is like.  \n5  Services are regularly denied or terminated for unreasonable or unrelated issues.  \n6  The workers responsible for this irrational behavior are not held accountable, \n7  sweeping the issues under the rug to avoid blame and responsibility.  Individuals, \n8  like Mr. Jarrell, were directed to Skid Row with promises of assistance and \n9  services, but instead they are turned away and abandoned; left to get worse \n10  instead of better.   \n1 \n1\nP  47 11  121.

From 2010 to \n7  2012, he lived on the streets of Glendora, California.  In the winter of 2011 and \n8  2012, he stayed at a Glendora Winter Shelter and then decided to seek help at the \n9  Union Rescue Mission (“URM”) located on 545 San Pedro St., Los Angeles, CA \n10  90013.

There \n2  has also been a huge increase in the amount of human feces on the street which \n3  carries with it the significant risk of disease, not to mention the odors. \n4  127.  There is absolutely no room to walk on the sidewalk, so if he leaves \n5  URM, Mr. Malow is forced to walk in the street.  Even in places where he could \n6  physically walk between the encampment and the wall, he still must walk on the \n7  streets or risk violent confrontation from people who accuse him of invading their \n8  “space.”  When he leaves URM, he must plan his route carefully even if traveling \n9  by public transportation.  Due to an increase in crime, including narcotics sales \n10  and violent activity, he must use a car service to get back from the metro or bus \n1 \n1\nP  47 11  station after visiting his mother in Anaheim.

LEANDRO SUAREZ is recently retired chief petty officer \n23  (“CPO”) in the United States Navy and served for over 24 years.  He resides with \n24  his sister, Deisy Suarez, at 5th and Broadway four days of the week.  While \n25  stationed off the coast of Southern California, he was involved in an accident \n26  involving a Navy jet which resulted in the amputation of his right leg and his left \n27  big toe.  It took him nearly two years to be healthy enough to use a prosthetic leg.  \n28  He also suffers from lower back problems and problems with his toes, knees, and \n \n87 \n  AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 361   Filed 11/01/21   Page 88 of 113   Page ID\n#:9335\n \n1  feet.  Currently, he can only walk for five to eight minutes at a time with the \n2  assistance of two crutches.  Because of his limited mobility with the prosthetic, \n3  CPO Suarez relies on an electric wheelchair for most daily activities, e.g. walking \n4  the dog, grocery shopping, running errands, or going “long” distances.   \n5  134.  Navigating the streets of Downtown Los Angeles is nearly \n6  impossible for CPO Suarez, and he is often confined on his block at 5th and \n7  Broadway.  The swelling number of persons living on the streets with their \n8  possessions severely limit Mr. Suarez’s ability to travel by wheelchair throughout \n9  DTLA.   \n10  135.  Streets that contain businesses with outdoor patios, chairs, or other \n1 \n1\nP  47 11  decorative materials pose a particularly difficult problem for CPO Suarez.

And the constant backtracking limits CPO \n18  Suarez’s ability to travel within the city because his wheelchair is not made for \n19  long distances.   \n20  136.  When CPO Suarez asks homeless persons to move themselves or \n21  their belongings, they often become aggressive with him, demanding that he \n22  prove he “owns the sidewalk,” or that he give them cigarettes or other \n23  paraphernalia as a “tax.”  More often than not, people simply refuse to move, \n24  again, forcing Mr. Suarez to find a curb, cross to the other side of the street, and \n25  hope that there will be enough public walkway for his wheelchair to fit through \n26  so that he can complete a simple errand, task, or outing.    \n27  137.  The buildup of goods and persons on the streets prevents CPO \n28  Suarez from freely traveling throughout the city.  He is limited in the distance \n \n88 \n  AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 361   Filed 11/01/21   Page 89 of 113   Page ID\n#:9336\n \n1  and the places he can travel because his electric wheelchair has a limited battery \n2  life.  When streets are blocked with property and people, CPO Suarez is forced to \n3  find a different, unobstructed, route to his destination.  And sometimes, because \n4  CPO Suarez’s wheelchair has limited battery life, he is prevented from even \n5  reaching his destination.  In fact, at times the idea of traveling outside is so \n6  daunting that Mr. Suarez is forced to remain indoors. \n7  138.  CPO Suarez’s difficulties are exacerbated when construction \n8  projects limit the sidewalk further.  A construction project between 4th and 5th \n9  Street has made it is nearly impossible for CPO Suarez to travel down Broadway \n10  because while a makeshift walkway exists, the walkway is often blocked by \n1 \n1\nP  47 11  homeless persons or their property.

HARRY TASHDJIAN owns an upholstery supply business in the \n19  industrial area of DTLA, and the property surrounding the business location.  Mr. \n20  Tashdjian’s building typically houses millions of dollars’ worth of inventory.  \n21  When he purchased the building in 2013, tents were not allowed on the streets \n22  during the day.  Because his business operates during traditional business hours, \n23  he believed that the location would not hinder business, which generally has \n24  between 70 and 100 will-call orders per day through which customers order \n25  product and then come into the business shop to pick it up.  \n26  141.  In mid-2016, Mr. Tashdjian saw an immediate increase in tents on \n27  the streets and sidewalks outside of his business.  Today, tents occupy the \n28  sidewalks at all hours, and it is difficult for him and his customers to access his \n \n89 \n  AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 361   Filed 11/01/21   Page 90 of 113   Page ID\n#:9337\n \n1  business due to the piles of property and people loitering on the sidewalk and in \n2  the street.  Customers constantly tell him how difficult it is to get into the \n3  building or the adjacent parking lot without hitting people.  Mr. Tashdjian has \n4  been repeatedly told that customers prefer to do business with competitors to \n5  avoid the hassle and inconvenience of trying to access his store.   \n6  142.  Vendors from all over the world—Italy, Germany, United Kingdom, \n7  China, etc.—visit Mr. Tashdjian’s shop and express shock and dismay that such \n8  horrendous conditions exist in Los Angeles.  His business is now at a much \n9  greater risk for vandalism, violence, and fire damage.

The conditions surrounding his property have cost Mr. Tashdjian a \n18  great deal of money.  Because of the immediate fire danger posed by the tents \n19  outside his building, he has been forced to upgrade his fire monitoring system \n20  which cost approximately $40,000.  He has also had to spend approximately \n21  $37,000 on a new security surveillance system to protect the building.  The \n22  LAPD frequently seeks footage caught on this security system during \n23  investigations.  Theft is also a major concern—pallets are constantly stolen from \n24  their building and car batteries are frequently stolen from inside people’s cars.    \n25  144.  There has also been a significant uptick in the population of rats \n26  surrounding his building, and as a result, rat feces coat all three fences \n27  surrounding his property.  To address the increase in fecal matter on his property, \n28  as well as the proliferation in cockroaches, he has hired a pest control company \n \n90 \n  AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 361   Filed 11/01/21   Page 91 of 113   Page ID\n#:9338\n \n1  and had the health department visit the property multiple times.  The gate \n2  surrounding his property has been repeatedly damaged, costing him thousands of \n3  dollars in repairs.   \n4  145.  Over the last few years, as the City and County have permitted the \n5  homelessness crisis to grow, the risk to his property from fire damage and \n6  vandalism has increased exponentially—the business constantly replaces gates \n7  and other property, cleans the facilities, and sometimes pays security to safeguard \n8  its property.  They have had to spend over $100,000 in upgrades to their system \n9  and increased monitoring and pest control just as a result of the increased \n10  homeless persons and property in the area.

GARY WHITTER has been homeless on and off in the Los \n18  Angeles area for the last 13 years.  He struggles with alcoholism, depression, \n19  bipolar disorder, chronic back pain, and hypertension.  While he was living on \n20  the streets, he would sleep wrapped up in a blanket, usually on hard cement or a \n21  blanket.  He could not get more than an hour or two of sleep at a time because of \n22  fear of attacks, noise, people asking him to move, physical pain, or exposure to \n23  the elements.  Sleep deprivation caused his mental state to spiral, exacerbating his \n24  depression, bipolar, and hypertension conditions.  The hard sleeping conditions \n25  and constantly carrying all his belongings everywhere he went lead to severe \n26  back pain. \n27  148.  The stress of the stigma of being homeless was also significant, \n28  adding to his depression and hypertension.

It was impossible to keep his hygiene \n2  up and as a result he was constantly sick.  Due to his unpredictable living and \n3  sleeping conditions, he lacked regular medical and dental care.  He frequently \n4  encountered persons attempting to scam him or victimize him in some way.  All \n5  of this caused his mental and physical state to further decline. \n6  149.  In the middle of March 2019, he entered into a program at the Union \n7  Rescue Mission, and has now been there for almost a year.  He is able to get a \n8  full night’s sleep which has significantly increased his mental stability and \n9  reduced his hypertension.  Sleeping on a bed, and not having to carry his worldly \n10  possessions on his back has helped his back pain tremendously and he can move \n1 \n1\nP  47 11  uninhibited which has itself improved his mental stability and hypertension.

Even when there is room to walk on the sidewalk, he often must \n21  walk in the street anyway or risk harassment for walking in a person’s \n22  “backyard” (the area in front of the tent).  Other than walking to Rite-Aid to pick \n23  up his prescriptions or to the Department of Public Social Services office to get \n24  his General Relief check, he stays inside because he is too afraid to leave the \n25  building.  At night he can hear gunshots and sirens all night long, and on the roof, \n26  it isn’t uncommon to witness people getting attacked on the street, including \n27  women getting beaten or raped.   \n28 \n \n92 \n  AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 361   Filed 11/01/21   Page 93 of 113   Page ID\n#:9340\n \n1  151.

Defendant County of Los Angeles is liable under California \n20  Government Code section 815.6 and common law negligence theory for violation \n21  of a statutorily mandated duty to provide medical care for the indigent.  \n22  California Welfare and Institutions Code section 17000 provides: “Every county \n23  and every city and county shall relieve and support all incompetent, poor, \n24  indigent persons, and those incapacitated by age, disease, or accident, lawfully \n25  resident therein, when such persons are not supported and relieved by their \n26  relatives or friends, by their own means, or by state hospitals or other state or \n27  private institutions.”   \n28 \n \n97 \n  AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 361   Filed 11/01/21   Page 98 of 113   Page ID\n#:9345\n \n1  169.  Section 10000 clarifies and defines the purpose of these obligations \n2  as follows: \n3   \nThe purpose of this division is to provide for protection, \n4  care, and assistance to the people of the state in need \nthereof, and to promote the welfare and happiness of all of \n5  the people of the state by providing appropriate aid and \nservices  to  all  of  its  needy  and  distressed.    It  is  the \n6  legislative  intent  that  aid  shall  be  administered  and \nservices  provided  promptly  and  humanely,  with  due \n7  regard for the preservation of family life, and without \ndiscrimination  on  account  of  ancestry,  marital  status, \n8  political affiliation, or any characteristic listed or defined \nin Section 11135 of the Government Code.  That aid shall \n9  be so administered and services so provided, to the extent \nnot  in  conflict  with  federal  law,  as  to encourage  self-\n10  respect, self-reliance, and the desire to be a good citizen, \n1  useful to society. \n1\nP  47 11   \nL 6-\nertus, Landes & Umhofer, L1990SBD.,S705  OUTH UNDY R UITE A,CA90025 LOS NGELES  310-826-4700;F310-82ONE  ACSIMILE  1111123456      copafr orSevu ibpdee1e r 7pmv0rio.se vodiriCSdcseea,a cdl4l .t c8 itWoao Crn ieesan l ltfd1.o. i7 A g&t0hep0 neIp0 nt.ps  sa.4ot n..to  hdC.r    p1“o1r2ad0ot2e0 ma3 0§ ,p0l  e11t tlv20aye40k la50e nwn 0(d .1ht  oh9icg9uhem6 td)ha.o en eTres lmh yni.aso” ntm   dlTeeaaaateidnl f stteh ocaa otuth un“enmnrte ievecd.se i Bsmcsoaaualr srytd   \np H\nS EP\nL\nTE 17  suffering or endanger life and health.”  Id. at 1240.  The California Supreme \n18  Court has held that “subsistence medical services” must be provided.

Counties have an \n22  obligation to provide “medically necessary care, not just emergency care.”  \n23  County of Alameda v. State Bd. of Control, 14 Cal. App. 4th 1096, 1108 (1993) \n24  (citation omitted).  That includes care “sufficient to avoid substantial pain and \n25  infection.”  Hunt, 21 Cal. 4th at 1014 (citing Cooke v. Superior Court, 213 Cal. \n26  App. 3d 401, 413-15 (1989)).  Importantly, a county’s obligation to provide \n27  medically necessary care must be fulfilled “without regard to its fiscal plight.”  \n28  Fuchino v. Edwards-Buckley, 196 Cal. App. 4th 1128, 1134 (2011) (citation \n \n98 \n  AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 361   Filed 11/01/21   Page 99 of 113   Page ID\n#:9346\n \n1  omitted).  “Medically necessary” for adults is defined in California Welfare & \n2  Institutions Code section 14059.5(a): “[A] service is ‘medically necessary’ or a \n3  ‘medical necessity’ when it is reasonable and necessary to protect life, to prevent \n4  significant illness or significant disability, or to alleviate severe pain.”  Cal. Welf. \n5  & Inst. Code § 14059.5(a). \n6  171.  Given the above-described facts and circumstances, and significant \n7  studies, statistics, and reports including those set forth supra, and other such \n8  evidence as may be provided, it cannot be doubted that a person’s status as an \n9  unsheltered homeless individual both causes and exacerbates physical and mental \n10  health problems, ultimately causing much higher rates of infection, disease, \n1 \n1\nP  47 11  decay, pain, and death.

Basic shelter is “medically necessary” insofar as it is “reasonable \n20  and necessary to protect life, to prevent significant illness or significant \n21  disability, or to alleviate severe pain” and the City and County’s failure to \n22  provide the same to its homeless population constitutes a breach of its duty under \n23  California Welfare & Institution Code Sections 17000 and 10000.

Sidewalks are subject to the access requirements of Title II of the \n2  ADA and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  42 U.S.C. § 12101(1); Willits, 925 F. \n3  Supp. 2d at 1093 (“Any public sidewalk over which the City of Los Angeles has \n4  responsibility to inspect and notify property owners of repair needs is a ‘program, \n5  service, or activity’ within the meaning of Title II of the Americans with \n6  Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.”).  \n7  Accordingly, sidewalk width requirements ensure that sidewalks are accessible \n8  for use by wheelchair-bound individuals.   \n9  201.  The minimum width for an ADA-compliant sidewalk is 36 inches. \n10  36 C.F.R. § 1191, app. D, § 403.5.1 (2014) (“the clear width of walking surfaces \n1 \n1\nP  47 11  shall be 36 inches (915 mm) minimum”).

Throughout Los Angeles, the City and County are failing to uphold \n19  their obligations to maintain clear and accessible sidewalks and public rights-of-\n20  way for its disabled residents and visitors, resulting in regular violations of the \n21  Americans with Disabilities Act.  These ADA violations are obvious and known \n22  to the City and County both through its own inspections and various reports of \n23  blocked sidewalks due to encampments through its own reporting mechanisms, \n24  such as 311.  Defendants and its agents and employees have failed and continue \n25  to fail to provide reasonable accommodations for disabled persons using public \n26  sidewalks.  \n27  203.  Defendants are obligated to operate the “service, program, or \n28  activity” “so that . . ., when viewed in its entirety, it is readily accessible to and \n \n106 \n  AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 361   Filed 11/01/21   Page 107 of 113   Page ID\n#:9354\n \n1  useable by individuals with disabilities.  28 C.F.R. § 35.150(a) (2012).  Yet when \n2  “viewed in its entirety” public rights-of-way are not provided by Defendants to \n3  be “readily accessible to and useable” by individuals bound to wheelchairs. \n4  204.  The discrimination and denial of access to the City’s rights-of-way \n5  for persons with disabilities is the direct result of Defendants’ policies and \n6  practices of deliberately permitting encampments to proliferate, particularly in \n7  certain areas such as Skid Row or on Venice Blvd under the 405 freeway, and the \n8  failure to adopt or implement any adequate procedure for regularly inspecting \n9  and maintaining the pedestrian rights-of-way clear of obstructions. \n10  205.

Defendants, by enforcing the law in some areas and declining to \n23  enforce the law in others, and by abdicating their duties under the law, have \n24  arbitrarily determined where homeless encampments may or may not be located \n25  and what communities should be affected, without following their own respective \n26  procedures and in violation of both state and federal law.

This \n5  policy of allowing encampments in some areas and not others without review, \n6  public comment, vote, or other appropriate process is in direct violation of the \n7  Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments’ prohibitions against deprivation without due \n8  process and unequal protection of the law.

In their \n5  Stipulated Order, the parties informed the Court that they had reached a Settlement subject to \n6  the Court’s approval of the terms; and dismissal with prejudice as to Defendant City of Los \n7  Angeles. The parties have requested that the Court retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the \n8  Settlement Agreement for a period of five years. \n9  The parties have been aggressively litigating this case for over two years. In the process, \n10  they have generated a voluminous record comprised of several pre-trial hearings, orders, and a \n11  preliminary injunction. In the first year of litigation, the parties participated in multiple \n12  mediation sessions, including on June 12, 2020 (Dkt. 133); June 25, 2020 (Dkt. 141); September \n13  10, 2020 (Dkt. 170); September 24, 2020 (Dkt. 179); and October 8, 2020 (Dkt. 184). These \n14  sessions resulted in a partial Memorandum of Understanding between the City and County of \n15  Los Angeles, with the City committing to create 6,700 beds in 18 months to prioritize sheltering \n16  unhoused people living by highways (Dkts. 136, 138). Just this year, the parties went to \n17  mediation sessions on February 15 (Dkt. 388), February 16 (Dkt. 394), February 22 (Dkt. 395), \n18  March 1 (Dkt. 397), and March 29, 2022 (Dkt. 401).  \n19  The agreement before the Court was not achieved in haste—it was the result of long and \n20  deliberate good-faith negotiations. In fact, the City and Plaintiffs have worked diligently to \n21  expand the barebones framework articulated in their Preliminary Settlement Agreement (Dkt. \n22  408) to a more fleshed-out plan to partially combat homelessness in Los Angeles.  \n23  The Settlement Agreement creates a structure and enforcement mechanism for the City to \n24  create a substantial number of new beds for people experiencing homelessness. While this \n25  Agreement is not a solution to homelessness, it is a concrete step toward improving the lives of \n26  our neighbors who are currently suffering on the streets. \n27  Procedurally, the Settlement Agreement does not affect the rights or obligations of non-\n28  settling parties or non-parties. As the City confirmed in its Reply, “nothing in the Court’s order \n \n-2- \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 445   Filed 06/14/22   Page 3 of 3   Page ID #:14300\n \n1  affects any rights of the County or the Intervenors,” and it does not prejudice the rights of other \n2  non-parties with respect to future challenges to City ordinances or suits on related issues. See \n3  City Reply (Dkt. 438) at 5. In particular, the Section titled, “County Obligations” imposes no \n4  responsibilities on the County of Los Angeles because they are not party to this Agreement—as \n5  the City notes, “[t]hese agreements are nothing more than Plaintiffs and the City’s expressions \n6  of (a) their beliefs concerning the County, and (b) their intent to cooperate regarding their \n7  opined County’s obligations.” Id. at 7. In addition, the Settlement Agreement does not affect the \n8  parties’ obligations under state or federal law, including state or federal disability law.  \n9  Having reviewed the Settlement Agreement and the parties’ briefing, the Court finds that \n10  the Settlement Agreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. Accordingly, the Court now \n11  approves the Settlement Agreement executed by the parties and attached as Exhibit 1, which is \n12  now incorporated in full into the Court’s Order as though fully set forth herein. The Court shall \n13  retain jurisdiction for a period of five years to enforce the terms of the Settlement Agreement. \n14  Per the parties’ agreement, the Court appoints Special Master Michele Martinez as the Monitor \n15  of the Settlement Agreement to assist the Court in overseeing and enforcing this Agreement.  \n16  Plaintiffs’ claims against the City only, as alleged in the First Amended and \n17  Supplemental Complaint, are hereby dismissed with prejudice as to the City only, subject to the \n18  Court’s retention of jurisdiction as set forth in Exhibit 1. This Action shall proceed against the \n19  County and no claims alleged by Plaintiff Gary Whitter are dismissed by this Order. Except as \n20  expressly provided otherwise in the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiffs and the City shall bear \n21  their own fees and costs in this Action. \n22  The Clerk shall serve this minute order on the parties. \n23 \nDATED: June 14, 2022   \n24 \n25   \n26  DAVID O.

People are perishing in the streets at a rate of three per day while the \n3  City and County of Los Angeles have tried but failed to stem this tide of human \n4  tragedy.1  The numbers alone are staggering.  There are 58,936 homeless \n5  individuals in Los Angeles County (“County”) and 36,300 in the City of Los \n6  Angeles’ (“City”)—an increase of 12 percent and 16 percent from just the prior \n7  year’s count, respectively.2  The City’s homeless population has nearly doubled \n8  in the last three years.  Some 75 percent of these are unsheltered persons who \n9  lack regular access to basic hygiene care such as toilets, running water to wash \n10  hands, showers, sinks, kitchen, laundry which has led to filthy (and unhealthy) \nP  1  11  conditions.

The environmental impact from power-washing human \n5  waste and used needles into our oceans is unassessed and untold.  The City and \n6  County combined spend over a billion dollars annually providing police, \n7  emergency, and support services to those living on the streets.

Homeless advocates have put pressure on the City and County for \n2  years to permit public camping, allow the accumulation of piles of personal \n3  property on the streets, and generally make it more comfortable for people to live \n4  on the streets.  But street-living is by no means more “comfortable,” because of \n5  significant health issues and inherent danger involved in being unsheltered.  \n6  Enforcement of homeless-related crimes has been reduced, or in some cases \n7  eliminated, in the name of compassion.  But allowing people to die on the streets \n8  isn’t compassionate; it’s cruel.  \n9  5.

The City of LA’s Bureau of Sanitation regularly power-washes \n4  streets, sidewalks, and other public spaces that have been occupied by \n5  unsheltered individuals; but those clean-ups cost millions of dollars and are \n6  ineffective in proactively addressing the crisis.10  In 2018, it cost over $35 million \n7  to conduct almost 15,000 clean-ups of homeless encampments, yet the ultimate \n8  benefits both to the encampment residents and to surrounding community are \n9  minimal at best.

Eight years after the Ninth Circuit upheld the Lavan injunction, the \n4  City entered into a settlement in the case of Mitchell v. City of Los Angeles.  \n5  Under the terms of that settlement, the City bound its own hands in agreeing to \n6  significantly limit the enforcement of L.A.M.C. Section 56.11, permitting the \n7  accumulation of personal property beyond the code section’s limits, and \n8  relegating enforcement to only certain bulky items such as couches, mattresses, \n9  refrigerators, and wooden pallets within a designated area known as “Skid Row \n10  and surrounding areas.”  The Mitchell agreement has led to a sharp decline in \nP  1  11  health and safety for housed and unhoused alike not just in Skid Row but \nL 71\nSpertus, Landes & Umhofer, L1990SBD.,S705  OUTH UNDY R UITE A,CA90025 LOS NGELES  310-826-4700;F310-826-4TELEPHONE  ACSIMILE  1111123456      tvR(mh9aeertlsohiaidu ndC gseci hnifrtoo.ty iur2a  ot0sl r td0Ndao7tieenw)i  ag(onn“hftAcbfoieow c friaenahnd.lo dse o T rtsadohul  e fAecf vdaoeagrvnsdors eecefe ransomtttme adestn ee svc til .rgap eCnwreoii .ftom”yic)r oo; as tnfCee tLtsi ttl olyeaes gnmo Aadfel  n Ganfgultlae teahwlngeodssrr.e,ai  ez 4lLeme9 esv8e a.v n gFSituo. u3celpada oetn i1rfno i0ono5t ro 2 bCf,e  1oa a 0u 5rt5,  \n17  18 Cal.

In a city and state facing \n8  water shortages, just on the other side of a devastating eight-year drought, such \n9  water usage, particularly without any kind of review taking place, is shameful \n10  and ultimately threatening to the water systems of the City and County. \nP  1  11  54.

Property Values and Businesses are Affected \n21  55.  Another casualty of the homelessness crisis is the value of property \n22  and businesses.

Businesses throughout Los Angeles, such as \n7  Desuar Spa on 5th Street, owned by Deisy Suarez, and Exclusive Motors on \n8  Venice Boulevard, owned by George Frem, both described infra, have customers \n9  declining to utilize their services due to nearby encampments.  \n10  56.

Yet the “incompetent, poor, [and] indigent persons” are not being \n7  relieved and supported, nor is “protection, care, and assistance” being given to \n8  those who desperately need it.

In focusing almost exclusively on PSH, a \n4  solution which is laudable but alone takes too long, is too expensive, and \n5  provides less than 20 percent of the beds actually needed, the City has wasted its \n6  best opportunity to address this crisis and failed to accomplish its stated goal as \n7  promised to the voters in 2016. \n8  62.  While most of the HHH money has been committed (though many \n9  have not even broken ground yet), there have been several opportunities to pivot \n10  strategies and claw-back some of the funding.

Another significant source of waste is found in the City’s \n18  encampment clean-up strategy.  In July 2019 the City Council approved an \n19  increase of $6.45 million on top of $26.5 million already in the budget for both \n20  noticed and “rapid response” clean-ups consisting of Sanitation workers and \n21  LAPD Officers responding to particular areas of homeless encampments, having \n22   \n82 HHH is funded using General Obligation (G.O.) bonds, which are \n23  limited by the California Constitution to fund “the acquisition or improvement of \nreal property.”  Cal. Const. art. 13A § 1(b)(2).  The phrase “acquisition or \n24  improvement of real property” is not defined by legal authority.  There are many \noptions presented herein which could easily fall within this category, including \n25  tiny home structures, 3D printed homes, or modification of existing structures \nsuch as the abandoned L.A.

While the City and County have made efforts to address this crisis, \n2  they are at best scattered and neither has developed comprehensive plans to solve \n3  it.  The new County mapping tool shows a total of 4,506 interim housing units \n4  coming online in the next two years (which includes beds within the City of Los \n5  Angeles and other locations), and 9,960 supportive housing units in the \n6  “pipeline” (the majority of which are funded through HHH and will not be ready \n7  for another several years).99 That is less than 15,000 new beds becoming \n8  available when there are more than 44,000 people in the County without a safe \n9  place to sleep on a nightly basis, and many of those beds that are planned won’t \n10  be available for years.   \nP  1  11  74.

The time he spent without regular shelter \n3  exacerbated those issues: he rarely was able to sleep more than a few hours at a \n4  time, he was exposed to the heat in summer and the cold and rain in winter. He \n5  took illegal drugs to self-medicate, both for his mental health issues and to cope \n6  with the stress of living on the streets; the narcotics further intensified his chronic \n7  illnesses. It wasn’t until he finally entered the Union Rescue Mission \n8  approximately two years ago that he began to heal: he was able to sleep without \n9  fear of attack or exposure to the elements and began to take his medication \n10  regularly.

He received his keys and moved in three weeks ago.   \n18  In the last two years while living in Skid Row, he was physically attacked, \n19  witnessed multiple stabbings, and saw multiple dead bodies.

MARK SHINBANE is the President and part-owner of Ore-\n18  Cal Corporation which is a family-owned business in the Skid Row area.

It is a second-generation family-owned-business and they have \n22  owned property in the general area since 1961.  Ore-Cal has been located on 634 \n23  Crocker Street since 1971.  Four years ago, Crocker Street and other streets in \n24  that vicinity—such as 6th Street, 7th Street and Towne Avenue—were free of \n25  encampments.  Mr. Shinbane recalls small homeless encampments west of San \n26  Pedro Street on San Julian Street and Wall Street in the past, but personal \n27  possessions were generally kept contained, crime was generally addressed, and \n28  the sidewalks were usable. \n \n46 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 1   Filed 03/10/20   Page 49 of 92   Page ID #:49\n \n1  In 2016, immediately after the injunction issued in Mitchell v. City of Los \n2  Angeles, Crocker Street, the neighborhood surrounding Ore-Cal became a haven \n3  for homeless individuals.  The streets rapidly filled with tents and encampments, \n4  inundating the area, which coincided with an increase in violence and an inability \n5  to traverse the sidewalks.  Individuals loiter at all times of the day, and the \n6  growing encampments block sidewalks, doorways, driveways, and streets. Mr. \n7  Shinbane regularly observes open drug use and people walking in a perpetual \n8  drug-induced state, and bodies lying on the sidewalks or doorways near his \n9  business.  There has been an increase of used needles on the streets, sidewalks, \n10  and inside drains located on the business’ property. \nP  1  11  Mr. Shinbane’s conversations with LAPD Officers and Detectives in the \nL 71\nSpertus, Landes & Umhofer, L1990SBD.,S705  OUTH UNDY R UITE A,CA90025 LOS NGELES  310-826-4700;F310-826-4TELEPHONE  ACSIMILE  1111123456      htirarnirogaedmnhaisvt e ipionldoeudusrtitsasca lia(tsdiat.oee s  n  Iotvl hfldiea crOgtti ivagrmeela -rsenCs ng aaatn rrmldy.e   e  pfoTmrenherbtqepoerue retetsh rnh aeatatirlorsye  r p bsasreu)so espapnapneu ldaryltn tygie n,ida ngnc oc agnrrr ae  mtbrahcrseroeemeat aiikbcnte-es invr ntseioso.d  ,l h  Heabonnyimcds eh  eet olhmwemesipftsetlh sloi e nbyasdoerseie tvh sni  daonuwda l as  \n17  common occurrence.  \n18  Ore-Cal and its employees are subject to an increased risk of fire because \n19  of the encampment fires that surround the property.  This danger is made worse \n20  by the huge quantities of trash and debris that litter their street and surrounding \n21  neighborhood.  The conditions on the street are worsening and there has been a \n22  significant increase in rats and vermin as well as urine and feces in their gutters \n23  and on their property.  These conditions have made it extremely difficult for Mr. \n24  Shinbane to hire new workers, and his company has lost many well qualified \n25  candidates due to the unpleasant neighborhood and environment—at least 10 \n26  candidates for administrative or managerial roles declined an offer because of \n27  concern for their safety or the conditions in the area.

He was forced to replace roll up doors and add \n7  sections of fence due to individuals constantly urinating on them, a cost of \n8  $25,000.   \n9  Ore-Cal has also had to significantly increase its exterior maintenance by \n10  washing and sanitizing the perimeter of their facility daily.

Trash left out by those on the streets ensures that the rodents are \n8  well fed each day and continue to maintain a home on the streets, which in turn \n9  creates health risks for those living on the street and working and living in the \n10  area, including Los Angeles Cold Storage employees.  \nP  1  11  Some Los Angeles Cold Storage customers require that the company be \nL 71\nSpertus, Landes & Umhofer, L1990SBD.,S705  OUTH UNDY R UITE A,CA90025 LOS NGELES  310-826-4700;F310-826-4TELEPHONE  ACSIMILE  1111123456      aacmtreunaarddstii hinstf teaiaacdnnia nidatt ian tohthdinuio s,cm n eth harpitnegri  fohhwig-eilagrdeash vtmbeeeys .lot     tcupWhetoersh stiBisdiflieriebci  tlcaLieost oihnloes sn RvtA.aee n lntT,atg lwhieyle li Cep tlhsoao  csCBneksoRs ool Cardftn  ,iSs u taithmmoneri mit(ara“g itcBneiuoe RhsnntCo,to  la”rmdni)ss,ed  kaar  sa nog c eflAc xofuApbamiea lcliu ntsl gaatht fiBeeotmRny  C oto f  \n17  audits, which would result in the loss of valuable customers.   \n18  The company continues to incur significant additional security costs to \n19  protect their property and avoid graffiti, and has installed extra cameras and \n20  lighting to protect its buildings, as well as employing a security guard to escort \n21  employees to company vehicles and monitor the safety of the building throughout \n22  the night.  Annual security costs for Los Angeles Cold Storage have skyrocketed \n23  by nearly 100 percent to a current level of $150,000. \n24  Los Angeles Cold Storage employees are often endangered on their \n25  commute to work.  Because the sidewalks are often completely blocked with \n26  individuals, personal belongings, and tents, employees have been forced to walk \n27  in the middle of the street to access the parking lot.

These panhandlers create even greater danger for those \n2  forced to walk in the street, because when they approach cars for money the cars \n3  swerve to avoid them.  The number of individuals in the street causes a great \n4  danger to vehicles passing through, and for vehicles entering and leaving their \n5  facility.   \n6  The high concentration of desperate people has led to an increase in \n7  violence in the area.  Now, his employees must be escorted to and from their cars \n8  in order to avoid harassment.

In particular, the City’s response to a series of \n4  federal lawsuits has coincided with this crisis, which affects the homeless and \n5  housed alike, and he joins this lawsuit to bring about a substantial change in the \n6  deteriorating conditions of DTLA.   \n7  h.   LISA RICH owns several buildings in Skid Row, which she \n8  rents out to various businesses.  Her family has been running the properties for \n9  over 40 years and has brought significant numbers of jobs to the area.  Over the \n10  past several years, the number of homeless persons on the sidewalk in front of the \nP  1  11  buildings has dramatically increased, as has the amount of personal possessions. \nL 71\nSpertus, Landes & Umhofer, L1990SBD.,S705  OUTH UNDY R UITE A,CA90025 LOS NGELES  310-826-4700;F310-826-4TELEPHONE  ACSIMILE  1111123456      Fwbtehfurifeetie hlqbcd uuttu heitplnhed mteoil fnyh  rg,po estrmfe.ou n pesTtleeseer ,sa ntcysnar  dneihm ntabscsi ena hlpmaaohlvn pyaegms cicintceoigavnmlsitlt spyby l al,pa orairecnne khedv da etuhv naneitnne hsddgyi  d grtoeeeinewnq nautahineclekts sictsr eo a dfbnno uddrrse i ditpnniaatoe ytnrsrsesos d..an  u  tsA c aftt rit ootiimnmmse  ea,ds cbu,c reteih nsteosg i itnnhgge   \n17   Ms. Rich attempted twice to contact LAPD for assistance in moving the \n18  property, but received no help.  When she asked why the LAPD had not moved \n19  homeless persons or their property, she was informed that there was nothing \n20  LAPD could do.  After learning the City would not help, Ms. Rich attempted to \n21  install fencing around some of her higher risk properties to keep tents from being \n22  propped directly against the buildings.  However, for one of the buildings, the \n23  City warned her that the fencing was unlawful and would lead to fines.  Before \n24  she could remove the fencing at issue, an unknown person or entity removed the \n25  chain link, and tents returned, gathering around the bare fence poles. \n26  In late 2017, a campfire at a homeless encampment burned out of control \n27  and set one of Ms. Rich’s buildings on fire.  The blaze significantly damaged the \n28  building’s offices and electrical system, requiring more than $80,000 worth of \n \n52 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 1   Filed 03/10/20   Page 55 of 92   Page ID #:55\n \n1  repairs.  The fire and repair process disrupted her tenant’s business for significant \n2  time.  At her next policy renewal period, her fire insurer refused to renew the \n3  policy covering all of her buildings, claiming her buildings could no longer be \n4  insured because of the risks posed by the adjacent homeless encampments.  Ms. \n5  Rich then approached 24 other insurers—of those, 23 insurers outright refused to \n6  insure her buildings at any rate.  Eventually, one insurer offered to cover her \n7  buildings at a premium more than four times her original rate.  As a result of \n8  these developments, she is actively considering selling her family’s business and \n9  abandoning the Skid Row area. \n10  i.

The increase in homeless persons and their property on the streets \n19  hinders Ms. Suarez’s ability to freely travel the public sidewalks and regularly \n20  puts her and her children’s lives in danger.  She finds it difficult to travel 3rd \n21  Street and Main Street, between 7th and 8th Street along Maple Street, along the \n22  east side of Los Angeles Street between Winston and 5th Street, between 5th and \n23  6th Street on Los Angeles Street, and along Main Street between 6th and 7th \n24  Street.   \n25  Some of these routes are blocked by street vendors who become extremely \n26  aggressive, and whose belongings and “shops” take up the entire sidewalk.  On \n27  other streets, tents and personal belongings fill the sidewalk, making it difficult or \n28  impossible for a person with a stroller or someone in a wheelchair to pass.

As a mother of young children, Ms. Suarez feels \n6  extremely vulnerable walking on the streets.   \n7  Ms. Suarez’s business has also been negatively impacted by the homeless \n8  crisis in Downtown Los Angeles.

JOSEPH BURK owns an historic building utilized for a company \n22  he created called Location 606, Inc.  His property is primarily rented for film, \n23  television, commercial and music video production.  Until 2017, he rented part of \n24  the property to tenants, but since then, due to the conditions in the area, he can no \n25  longer get a tenant to occupy the property, and he now lives there with his wife.  \n26  He pays property taxes, but cannot use the public sidewalks around his own \n27  property.  Mr. Burk’s residence has become unlivable due to surrounding \n28  conditions, and his business has been destroyed.

He has lost hundreds \n3  of thousands of dollars because production companies cannot use Mr. Burk’s \n4  property since they need accessible driveways and sidewalks for heavy \n5  equipment, lighting and sound items, and costume trucks, and the exits and \n6  entrances to his property are often fully blocked by shelters and possessions.  On \n7  at least one occasion when his property was to be used for filming, the crew was \n8  unable able to bring their equipment inside his building and demanded its money \n9  back.  His property has been on the market for years without an acceptable offer, \n10  and he has experienced a significant decline in his own quality of life as a result \nP  1  11  of the increased filth, violence, and drug use in the surrounding areas.  \nL 71\nSpertus, Landes & Umhofer, L1990SBD.,S705  OUTH UNDY R UITE A,CA90025 LOS NGELES  310-826-4700;F310-826-4TELEPHONE  ACSIMILE  1111123456      commu7n8i.c aa. tiOOCuopnrvcocsteoo crfbkm rtoeehimrrne   1yg pp1e acrs,so ot2temd 0rtudhm1car6teeyi ereo cI mny ic aeacalaio nlrsm: sh n,“o poAMoa ltfnorsti.e.n e Br gs Td euchrrro iekpvn  hrihsneoiasdgmsee  pnrreeiatln cesygetso is yvhu oceirsou dp nrp r tdprohoilpetapi ecoferoenrtly t olyd ofn ifwor oe6rir ctn htfgli ya lm ndin g:  \n17  around your property is out of control and I wouldn’t feel safe \n18  bringing any film crew into that area.”   \n19  b.

His security cameras often catch violent encounters, like a \n26  shooting that occurred in the end of January across the street from his building. \n27  81.

He has difficulty receiving mail or packages.  The mail \n4  carrier will not deliver his mail if his mailbox is blocked and will not get out of \n5  his truck to deliver mail or packages to his front door because he has said it is not \n6  safe.

HARRY TASHDJIAN owns an upholstery supplier in the \n19  industrial area of DTLA, and the property surrounding the business location.  Mr. \n20  Tashdjian’s building typically houses millions of dollars’ worth of inventory. \n21  When he purchased the building in 2013, tents were not allowed on the streets \n22  during the day.  Because his business operates during traditional business hours, \n23  he believed that the location would not hinder business, which generally has \n24  between 70 and 100 will-call orders per day through which customers order \n25  product then come into the business shop to pick it up.  \n26  87.  In mid-2016, Mr. Tashdjian saw an immediate increase in tents on \n27  the streets and sidewalks outside of his business.  Today, tents occupy the \n28  sidewalks at all hours, and it is difficult for him and his customers to access his \n \n58 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 1   Filed 03/10/20   Page 61 of 92   Page ID #:61\n \n1  business due to the piles of property and people loitering on the sidewalk and in \n2  the street.  Customers constantly tell him how difficult it is to get into the \n3  building or the adjacent parking lot without hitting people.  Mr. Tashdjian has \n4  been repeatedly told that customers prefer to do business with competitors to \n5  avoid the hassle and inconvenience of trying to access his store.   \n6  88.  Vendors from all over the world—Italy, Germany, United Kingdom, \n7  China, etc.—visit Mr. Tashdjian’s shop and express shock and dismay that such \n8  horrendous conditions exist in Los Angeles.  His business is now at a much \n9  greater risk for vandalism, violence, and fire damage.

The conditions surrounding his property have cost Mr. Tashdjian a \n18  great deal of money.  Because of the immediate fire danger posed by the tents \n19  outside his building, he has been forced to upgrade his fire monitoring system \n20  which cost approximately $40,000.  He has also had to spend approximately \n21  $37,000 on a new security surveillance system to protect the building.  The \n22  LAPD frequently seeks footage caught on this security system during \n23  investigations.  Theft is also a major concern—pallets are constantly stolen from \n24  their building and car batteries are frequently stolen from inside people’s cars.    \n25  90.

KARYN PINSKY works in DTLA and lives there with her husband \n18  and their three-year-old son.  She and her husband moved to DTLA in 2010 \n19  because they were drawn to the architecture, history, and walkability of the area.  \n20  Homeless people have always been present near their home, but in far fewer \n21  numbers.  In 2010, the only tents west of Skid Row were on Broadway, and they \n22  were erected every night and removed shortly after sunrise.  From 2010 to 2016, \n23  Ms. Pinsky and her husband, and later her son, were able to enjoy many \n24  wonderful features of DTLA—they regularly walked their dog along Main Street, \n25  and they felt comfortable walking to the many wonderful establishments and \n26  restaurants that were nearby.   \n27  94.  All this has changed dramatically over the past several years as the \n28  homelessness crisis has deepened.  When walking outside, Ms. Pinsky is fearful \n \n60 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 1   Filed 03/10/20   Page 63 of 92   Page ID #:63\n \n1  that either she or her son will be the subject of some random act of violence.  \n2  This fear stems from dangerous encounters either she or her husband have had \n3  with individuals on the streets.  Once, while sitting outside at a café on Spring \n4  Street, a homeless woman screamed and became violent towards her because she \n5  thought Ms. Pinsky was “judging” her—only when her husband and others \n6  intervened was the situation defused.  On another occasion, her husband saw the \n7  aftermath of a violent encounter between a neighbor and a homeless, mentally ill \n8  individual—the individual hit their neighbor in the face with a 2x4 that had a nail \n9  in it.   Earlier this year, a homeless man seated outside a café on 6th Street near \n10  Broadway, a block from their house, randomly pushed a stranger into the street in \nP  1  11  front of an oncoming bus.  The man was struck by the bus and ultimately died.  \nL 71\nSpertus, Landes & Umhofer, L1990SBD.,S705  OUTH UNDY R UITE A,CA90025 LOS NGELES  310-826-4700;F310-826-4TELEPHONE  ACSIMILE  1111123456      Asnbooenmc olaoetuhnoseg9nere5e  orn . w fef eiihgteosShl  spebg xsroaoauirnfx aoeeil mn dsa  lsaiaets cyedacp iutefiolfnst essgtrh   otewehnn rift ot iwhfrule oogh meohesrr eca  wnw af piaiarnesles.d   ao eot  stwhacac acvkpreeea d ciwn kicneinrd etd haeoesvwe emd.n  i  sNdai dgollniwetit fl,oie caf  aast tnha tne lr iyneg sihigunth l ttth,  beshy  e  \n17  last several years, and as a result, Ms. Pinsky is terrified of being assaulted while \n18  running errands or just walking to or from a restaurant.  The conditions \n19  immediately surrounding their home have gotten so dangerous that neither she \n20  nor her husband will leave the house late at night, even to let their elderly dog \n21  out.  A woman in their building was attacked twice near the building while \n22  walking her dog at night.  Since then, she and her husband decided to put a diaper \n23  on their dog to avoid going out.   \n24  96.  Each time she takes her son outside, she’s afraid that he will contract \n25  one of the many diseases that are plaguing the area—typhus, tuberculosis, \n26  typhoid, hepatitis, or the plague.  To avoid disease and violence, she’s stopped \n27  allowing her son to play at the park in Pershing Square, and she’s stopped taking \n28  him to Story Time at the Central Library.

Ms. Pinsky has been greatly \n5  affected and has a very real interest in remediating this issue insofar as her \n6  quality of life and basic enjoyment of her property has been severely diminished.  \n7  At the same time, she also has compassion and empathy for those on the streets \n8  who are subject to the assaults (particularly women), the elements, the drug \n9  pushers, the gang members, the rats, filth, and disease.  For Ms. Pinsky, this is no \n10  way for a society to treat its most helpless members. \nP  1  11  97.

When he first arrived at URM in 2012, police officers would come by in \n19  the morning, and wake-up the people sleeping on the streets.  They were required \n20  to pack up their belongings and stow them, so the sidewalks were not blocked.  \n21  This also allowed illegal activity such as narcotics and weapons sales to be more \n22  easily discovered and therefore addressed.  At that time, there were no tents in \n23  front of URM.  \n24  98.  For a little over two years, Mr. Malow has been an Ambassador at \n25  URM.  The Ambassador program allows a small group of men to live at URM \n26  indefinitely.  Since living at URM, he has worked at Home Depot and in URM’s \n27  janitorial department, known as the EVS team.  He knows that diseases such as \n28  typhus have made a resurgence on Skid Row, and this makes him extremely \n \n62 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 1   Filed 03/10/20   Page 65 of 92   Page ID #:65\n \n1  concerned that his work with the EVS team puts him at greater risk of contracting \n2  a disease.   \n3  99.  In the last several years Mr. Malow has seen a big increase in the \n4  volume of tents and belongings on the streets.  This has greatly affected his daily \n5  life.  He has observed a dramatic increase in the rodent problem on Skid Row and \n6  has seen rats running in and out of tents when he sweeps the sidewalks and \n7  gutters outside of URM.  A major cause of this rodent problem is the volume of \n8  trash disposed of on the streets—because individuals living on the streets throw \n9  food and trash in the streets, rats have more than enough food to flourish.  There \n10  has also been a huge increase in the amount of human feces on the street which \nP  1  11  carries with it the significant risk of disease, not to mention the odors. \nL 71\nSpertus, Landes & Umhofer, L1990SBD.,S705  OUTH UNDY R UITE A,CA90025 LOS NGELES  310-826-4700;F310-826-4TELEPHONE  ACSIMILE  1111123456      Ups“tshrRpyeaMesctisce,  1a.Mo”l0rl 0 y rWr.. i  wMshkaTea lvnhkloi e ohbwrleeee   tinliwsest  a efacoveborensncs ofet hUrlduoe Rtnt eoetMlna ywtc, i anoahmlonek   pr fmiormnoou metmshnt e  tppt  oaesla ntowrndpe a lehtelthik .swe    o Erwhonvou aet lthanlec,e   icc hnsuaei rsdp eseeltf awihulclilae mlmlysk   wuoe, vsfsh toei enwn riv efai a fhlh dkteeri   onalcevngoae  uttvlhhliednees  ig r  \n17  by public transportation.  Due to an increase in crime, including narcotics sales \n18  and violent activity, he must use a car service to get back from the metro or bus \n19  station after visiting his mother in Anaheim.  He always has the car drop him off \n20  directly in front of URM to avoid dangerous encounters on the street.  \n21  101.  Mr. Malow does not leave URM between the hours of 4 p.m. and 6 \n22  a.m., because he is concerned for his safety on the streets.  When he does leave, \n23  he is incessantly approached and offered illegal drugs for sale.  He regularly sees \n24  people just outside his home using illegal narcotics in the form of pills or \n25  smoking or injecting themselves. He sees people lying motionless in gutters, \n26  often without clothes or shoes, and is constantly looking to see if that person is \n27  dead or merely unconscious from drugs or alcohol.

The excessive build-up of tents and debris over the last few years is \n4  directly responsible for this significant increase in crime because it allows \n5  criminals to operate in relative anonymity.  This increase in debris, tents, and \n6  personal items on the streets also makes it impossible for health and safety \n7  workers to identify public health risks, causing disease and unsafe conditions to \n8  spread right outside his home.  As a formerly homeless individual, Malow knows \n9  first-hand the difficulties that come from living on the street and is deeply \n10  troubled by both the City’s actions and inaction in the face of the homelessness \nP  1  11  crisis. \nL 71\nSpertus, Landes & Umhofer, L1990SBD.,S705  OUTH UNDY R UITE A,CA90025 LOS NGELES  310-826-4700;F310-826-4TELEPHONE  ACSIMILE  1111123456      hdhanaeesc dl a ibivdseee e1pdsn0a.  f r3 hotS. or oo mtfmwC eietoHlste  ioAsAmsrRm  eot hLrbar faEletiseevSs reay  Vd2de 0oaAi1nrrsN 0 p.s , hr  SohHeCgelet rOe mahrmYsao sv.a   aetb  ldevs eoatnor li  iolLviuveosisnn  pgago t B iaUnte tnatshic oiehnn  U R tRiRemesMsecc u oufevoe Me rM rt ihtsihrsseesioei ol nayn,se  twaa tnrhhsder  eree  \n17  104.  Due to various illnesses, Mr. Van Scoy is confined to a wheelchair.  \n18  He depends on Access Services (“Access”), Los Angeles County’s Paratransit \n19  program, when traveling further distances within the city. Sometimes Access is \n20  available to him, but sometimes it is not—it is a limited program and he is \n21  regularly in danger of losing qualification for its services.  Because of the \n22  homelessness crisis, it is presently impossible for Mr. Van Scoy to navigate the \n23  sidewalks surrounding the URM, and so he must choose every day to stay inside \n24  or risk traversing busy streets in a wheelchair and risking accident and injury—\n25  indeed, the risk is even greater for him on the streets because the massive \n26  amounts of trash and property (and sometimes unconscious bodies) in the gutters \n27  require him edge closer to the center of the streets.  When he asks people to move \n28  their belongings on the sidewalk to make a path for his 32-inch wheelchair, he is \n \n64 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 1   Filed 03/10/20   Page 67 of 92   Page ID #:67\n \n1  met with threats and aggression, so he doesn’t even ask anymore.  He has missed \n2  important doctors’ appointments and meetings because it is so difficult for him to \n3  move along public sidewalks. \n4  105.  Every time Mr. Van Scoy leaves URM, people approach him to buy \n5  or sell drugs.  As a recovering addict, it feels like walking into a firestorm.  So \n6  many of the tents and enclosures are used by gang members to sell drugs and \n7  weapons that people who come to Skid Row looking for services frequently find \n8  themselves targets for drug pushers.  \n9  106.

GEORGE FREM owns a luxury auto-shop in Mar Vista California, \n19  which primarily services high-end vehicles.  In 2015, a few homeless individuals \n20  set up tents under the 405 freeway adjacent to his business.  Since then, the \n21  population of the encampment has continually increased, and he currently \n22  estimates that more than 80 people live there.  The residents have brought a \n23  variety of goods with them including tents, mattresses, wardrobes, and \n24  more.  The encampment effectively fully covers the sidewalk on one side of the \n25  road.  Mr. Frem now sees drug use, prostitution, violence, and public indecency \n26  on a regular basis.  In the summer, the scent of urine and feces permeates the air, \n27  causing Mr. Frem and his patrons to question whether the area is safe to occupy.   \n28 \n \n65 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 1   Filed 03/10/20   Page 68 of 92   Page ID #:68\n \n1  109.  The City conducts weekly sanitary cleanups of the camp.  When \n2  they do so, the City tells the homeless persons that any property left within a \n3  designated zone will be considered abandoned and disposed of accordingly.  This \n4  causes the unsheltered persons to move themselves and all of their belongings to \n5  the area immediately outside of the cleanup area and directly in front of Mr. \n6  Frem’s business.  Additionally, every Friday LAHSA representatives set up a \n7  mobile shower station directly in front of Mr. Frem’s business, resulting in lines \n8  of people on the sidewalk for hours as they wait for the showers to be \n9  available.  When this occurs, customers frequently question whether their \n10  vehicles are safe in the lot and whether they will be stored inside overnight.  \nP  1  11  110.

This has decreased the number of service orders the shop has every \n22  year since the encampment arose.  Before the encampment was in place, Mr. \n23  Frem’s shop consistently performed over 1000 repairs per year.  But, because of \n24  the City’s policies effectively maintaining and promoting the camp, the numbers \n25  have declined year on year, and now, the shop can only draw around 600 repair \n26  jobs per year.  The City’s homelessness policies have caused serious economic \n27  damage to Mr. Frem’s business and have effectively destroyed the value of his \n28  enterprise.  \n \n66 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 1   Filed 03/10/20   Page 69 of 92   Page ID #:69\n \n1  112.  LEANDRO SUAREZ is chief petty officer (“CPO”) in the United \n2  States Navy and has served for over 22 years.  He resides with his sister, Deisy \n3  Suarez, at Fifth Street and Broadway four days of the week.  While stationed off \n4  the coast of Southern California, he was involved in an accident that resulted in \n5  the amputation of his right leg and his left big toe.  It took him nearly two years \n6  to be healthy enough to use a prosthetic leg.  He also suffers from lower back \n7  problems and problems with his toes, knees, and feet.  Currently, he can only \n8  walk for five to eight minutes at a time with the assistance of two crutches.  \n9  Because of his limited mobility with the prosthetic, CPO Suarez relies on an \n10  electric wheelchair for most daily activities, e.g. walking the dog, grocery \nP  1  11  shopping, or going “long” distances.   \nL 71\nSpertus, Landes & Umhofer, L1990SBD.,S705  OUTH UNDY R UITE A,CA90025 LOS NGELES  310-826-4700;F310-826-4TELEPHONE  ACSIMILE  1111123456      iBpDmorTospLsaoedAss1wss.1i iba 3o yl.ne .s  f  TosNerhv aeCev sPriewgOlaye tSl illnuiinmgag rite thn zeMu,  msartn.rb edSee urht asoer  foei sfzp  ’eDosrf osateowbnnin lscit toolyiwnv tfioninn  gtLer aodovs no e Antlh  nbhegyi sse wt lbreehlsoee itcesskl  cnw aheitaat hFirrl i ytfthth her ioaru ngdh out \n17  114.  Streets that contain businesses with outdoor patios, chairs, or other \n18  decorative materials pose a particularly difficult problem for CPO Suarez.  While \n19  the law requires businesses to ensure a certain portion of the sidewalk remain \n20  clear, homeless persons openly camp in front of these establishments, effectively \n21  blocking the entire sidewalk.  CPO Suarez cannot get around these persons, and \n22  because he is in a wheelchair, he must go back to the corner so he can use the \n23  ramp to access the street and cross to the other side.  This is a laborious, time-\n24  consuming, and dangerous process.  And the constant backtracking limits CPO \n25  Suarez’s ability to travel within the city because his wheelchair is not made for \n26  long distances.   \n27  115.  When CPO Suarez asks homeless persons to move themselves or \n28  their belongings, they often become aggressive with him, demanding that he \n \n67 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 1   Filed 03/10/20   Page 70 of 92   Page ID #:70\n \n1  prove he “owns the sidewalk,” or that he give them cigarettes or other \n2  paraphernalia as a “tax.”  More often than not, people simply refuse to move, \n3  again, forcing Mr. Suarez to find a curb, cross to the other side of the street, and \n4  hope that there will be enough public walkway for his wheelchair to fit through \n5  so that he can complete a simple errand, task, or outing.    \n6  116.  The buildup of goods and persons on the streets prevents CPO \n7  Suarez from freely traveling throughout the city.  He is limited in the distance \n8  and the places he can travel because his electric wheelchair has a limited battery \n9  life.  When streets are blocked with property and people, CPO Suarez is forced to \n10  find a different, unobstructed, route to his destination.  And sometimes, because \nP  1  11  CPO Suarez’s wheelchair has limited battery life, he is prevented from even \nL 71\nSpertus, Landes & Umhofer, L1990SBD.,S705  OUTH UNDY R UITE A,CA90025 LOS NGELES  310-826-4700;F310-826-4TELEPHONE  ACSIMILE  1111123456      rdlmieamaaudcinthe tti i1ihnnt1eg gi7  s sht.  ihnidsaee tadMw Mrelarsy.lrt  k.iSi n mSfuauuaptirarooterhsnezsez.’i rs  b.iI  sldn e Ai f ffof afocricccort eun,M dlsat ttritr e.otu siS cm rauteireamoesrn e aet zihxpn erat oo icin jedtedrrecaboatvao  botereeslfd  .tdt w rwoaewvheeennln  iB4n ctgrhoo  noaasudnttwdrsu ia5dcytteh i boi sSen ct spraoeru eostje eh catss  \n17  while a makeshift walkway exists, the walkway is often blocked by homeless \n18  persons or their property.

The stress of the stigma of being homeless was also significant, \n8  adding to his depression and hypertension.  As hard as he tried, he understood \n9  that he always looked and smelled terrible.

Further, the ADA ensures that \n20  transportation facilities are constructed to a set of standards that ensures \n21  accessibility for the disabled.  Sidewalks are the most common element of \n22  transportation infrastructure, yet if they are not accessible, they pose great \n23  challenges and dangers to anyone in a wheelchair or who has other mobility \n24  restrictions.  \n25  173.  Sidewalks are subject to the access requirements of Title II of the \n26  ADA and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  42 U.S.C. § 12101(1); Willits, 925 F. \n27  Supp. 2d at 1093 (“Any public sidewalk over which the City of Los Angeles has \n28  responsibility to inspect and notify property owners of repair needs is a ‘program, \n \n83 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 1   Filed 03/10/20   Page 86 of 92   Page ID #:86\n \n1  service, or activity’ within the meaning of Title II of the Americans with \n2  Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.”).  \n3  Accordingly, sidewalk width requirements ensure that sidewalks are accessible \n4  for use by wheelchair-bound individuals.   \n5  174.  The minimum width for an ADA-compliant sidewalk is 36 inches. \n6  36 C.F.R. § 1191, app. D, § 403.5.1 (2014) (“the clear width of walking surfaces \n7  shall be 36 inches (915 mm) minimum”).  Where obstructions such as telephone \n8  poles, traffic signal cabinets, or other utilities exist, the sidewalk must be \n9  constructed to allow the minimum width requirement of 36 inches between the \n10  edge of the obstruction and the edge of the sidewalk.

These ADA violations are obvious and known \n18  to the City and County both through its own inspections and various reports of \n19  blocked sidewalks due to encampments through its own reporting mechanisms, \n20  such as 311.  Defendants and its agents and employees have failed and continue \n21  to fail to provide reasonable accommodations for disabled persons using public \n22  sidewalks.  \n23  176.  Defendants are obligated to operate the “service, program, or \n24  activity” “so that . . ., when viewed in its entirety, it is readily accessible to and \n25  useable by individuals with disabilities.  28 C.F.R. § 35.150(a) (2012).  Yet when \n26  “viewed in its entirety” public rights-of-way are not provided by Defendants to \n27  be “readily accessible to and useable” by individuals bound to wheelchairs. \n28 \n \n84 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 1   Filed 03/10/20   Page 87 of 92   Page ID #:87\n \n1  177.  The discrimination and denial of access to the City’s rights-of-way \n2  for persons with disabilities is the direct result of Defendants’ policies and \n3  practices of deliberately permitting encampments to proliferate, particularly in \n4  certain areas such as Skid Row or on Venice Blvd under the 405 freeway, and the \n5  failure to adopt or implement any adequate procedure for regularly inspecting \n6  and maintaining the pedestrian rights-of-way clear of obstructions. \n7  178.  As a direct and proximate result of the aforementioned acts, \n8  including but not limited to Defendants’ deliberate indifference to the violation of \n9  Mr. Van Scoy and Mr. Suarez’s federally protected rights, both have suffered \n10  pain, humiliation, hardship, anxiety, indignity, and severe mental and emotional \nP  1  11  anguish.

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provides in relevant \n25  part: “[N]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability. . . shall, solely by \n26  reason of his or her disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied \n27  the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity \n28  receiving Federal financial assistance. . .” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (2016). \n \n85 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 1   Filed 03/10/20   Page 88 of 92   Page ID #:88\n \n1  182.

Defendants, by enforcing the law in some areas and declining to \n22  enforce the law in others, and by abdicating their duties under the law, have \n23  arbitrarily determined where homeless encampments may or may not be located \n24  and what communities should be affected, without following their own respective \n25  procedures and in violation of both state and federal law. This has placed a \n26  disproportionate burden on some persons, communities, and businesses over \n27  others. \n28 \n \n86 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 1   Filed 03/10/20   Page 89 of 92   Page ID #:89\n \n1  186.  Upon information and belief, City and County officials have within \n2  the last year affirmatively notified and/or instructed homeless individuals that \n3  some areas (for example, Skid Row, certain areas in Venice, or under the 405 \n4  freeway) were locations where camps would be allowed to exist and persist.  This \n5  policy of allowing encampments in some areas and not others without review, \n6  public comment, vote, or other appropriate process is in direct violation of the \n7  Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments’ prohibitions against deprivation without due \n8  process and unequal protection of the law.

In their \n5  Stipulated Order, the parties informed the Court that they had reached a Settlement subject to \n6  the Court’s approval of the terms; and dismissal with prejudice as to Defendant City of Los \n7  Angeles. The parties have requested that the Court retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the \n8  Settlement Agreement for a period of five years. \n9  The parties have been aggressively litigating this case for over two years. In the process, \n10  they have generated a voluminous record comprised of several pre-trial hearings, orders, and a \n11  preliminary injunction. In the first year of litigation, the parties participated in multiple \n12  mediation sessions, including on June 12, 2020 (Dkt. 133); June 25, 2020 (Dkt. 141); September \n13  10, 2020 (Dkt. 170); September 24, 2020 (Dkt. 179); and October 8, 2020 (Dkt. 184). These \n14  sessions resulted in a partial Memorandum of Understanding between the City and County of \n15  Los Angeles, with the City committing to create 6,700 beds in 18 months to prioritize sheltering \n16  unhoused people living by highways (Dkts. 136, 138). Just this year, the parties went to \n17  mediation sessions on February 15 (Dkt. 388), February 16 (Dkt. 394), February 22 (Dkt. 395), \n18  March 1 (Dkt. 397), and March 29, 2022 (Dkt. 401).  \n19  The agreement before the Court was not achieved in haste—it was the result of long and \n20  deliberate good-faith negotiations. In fact, the City and Plaintiffs have worked diligently to \n21  expand the barebones framework articulated in their Preliminary Settlement Agreement (Dkt. \n22  408) to a more fleshed-out plan to partially combat homelessness in Los Angeles.  \n23  The Settlement Agreement creates a structure and enforcement mechanism for the City to \n24  create a substantial number of new beds for people experiencing homelessness. While this \n25  Agreement is not a solution to homelessness, it is a concrete step toward improving the lives of \n26  our neighbors who are currently suffering on the streets. \n27  Procedurally, the Settlement Agreement does not affect the rights or obligations of non-\n28  settling parties or non-parties. As the City confirmed in its Reply, “nothing in the Court’s order \n \n-2- \n\nCasCea 2s:e2 02-:c2v0--0c2v2-09212-D91O-CD-OKCE-SK E  DS o  cDuomceunmt e4n4t5 4  5 F1i-l1e d   F06ile/1d4 0/272/1  3 P/2a2g e   P3a ogfe 3 4    oPfa 4g e   PIDa g#e:1 I4D300\n#:14486\n \n1  affects any rights of the County or the Intervenors,” and it does not prejudice the rights of other \n2  non-parties with respect to future challenges to City ordinances or suits on related issues. See \n3  City Reply (Dkt. 438) at 5. In particular, the Section titled, “County Obligations” imposes no \n4  responsibilities on the County of Los Angeles because they are not party to this Agreement—as \n5  the City notes, “[t]hese agreements are nothing more than Plaintiffs and the City’s expressions \n6  of (a) their beliefs concerning the County, and (b) their intent to cooperate regarding their \n7  opined County’s obligations.” Id. at 7. In addition, the Settlement Agreement does not affect the \n8  parties’ obligations under state or federal law, including state or federal disability law.  \n9  Having reviewed the Settlement Agreement and the parties’ briefing, the Court finds that \n10  the Settlement Agreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. Accordingly, the Court now \n11  approves the Settlement Agreement executed by the parties and attached as Exhibit 1, which is \n12  now incorporated in full into the Court’s Order as though fully set forth herein. The Court shall \n13  retain jurisdiction for a period of five years to enforce the terms of the Settlement Agreement. \n14  Per the parties’ agreement, the Court appoints Special Master Michele Martinez as the Monitor \n15  of the Settlement Agreement to assist the Court in overseeing and enforcing this Agreement.  \n16  Plaintiffs’ claims against the City only, as alleged in the First Amended and \n17  Supplemental Complaint, are hereby dismissed with prejudice as to the City only, subject to the \n18  Court’s retention of jurisdiction as set forth in Exhibit 1. This Action shall proceed against the \n19  County and no claims alleged by Plaintiff Gary Whitter are dismissed by this Order. Except as \n20  expressly provided otherwise in the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiffs and the City shall bear \n21  their own fees and costs in this Action. \n22  The Clerk shall serve this minute order on the parties. \n23 \nDATED: June 14, 2022   \n24 \n25   \n26  DAVID O.

Background \nIn response to the Court’s Order re: Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. 108), at \n6:58 p.m. on May 19, 2020, the Court was advised that a tentative agreement had been \n“signed off on by all parties and intervenors” and would be submitted to the Court \nmomentarily. However, approximately thirty minutes later, the parties informed the Court \nthat they were in fact unable to reach an agreement, and that the parties would be filing \nseparate reports with the Court.1 \n \n  In its Status Report (Dkt. 115) (“County Report”), filed jointly with Intervenors on \nMay 20, 2020, the County of Los Angeles represents as follows: \n \nFollowing the issuance of the Court’s injunction on May 15, 2020, \nthe parties spent the last several days trying to reach an agreement \nregarding a joint filing. Regrettably, at approximately 7:30 p.m. the \n \n1 The Report (Dkt. 114) filed by the City of Los Angeles and Status Report (Dkt. 115) filed by the \nCounty of Los Angeles are attached to this Order as Exhibits A and B, respectively.  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 123   Filed 05/22/20   Page 2 of 13   Page ID #:1942\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \n \nCIVIL MINUTES – GENERAL \n \nCase No. LA CV 20-02291-DOC-KES  Date: May 22, 2020 \n                                              \n     Page 2  \n \nday the filing was due, the City declined to participate in a joint \nfiling, stating that it could not agree out of a concern over the \npayment for “services” at City-owned interim shelters and similar \nsites. The County offered to develop a package of mainstream \nservices for persons experiencing homelessness and residing in \nshelters within the City. These services would include health and \nbehavioral health outreach, disability benefit advocacy services, and \nconnections to social services benefits. The City rejected the \nCounty’s offer. \n \nThe City would not agree to a shared funding arrangement as \nproposed by the County for operational costs (such as food, laundry, \nsecurity, etc.) associated with the City’s pilot programs. The City \nmade a similar request for all City shelters proposed under the City’s \nplan to address homelessness near freeways and for individuals \ncurrently occupying COVID-19 emergency beds in the City. These \ndemands are inconsistent with past practice. In general, with the \nexception of Measure H funding administered by the County, the \nCity funds operational costs for interim shelter sites in the City. The \nCity is a major recipient of state and federal funds for homeless \nservices, unlike other cities in the County (with the partial exception \nof Long Beach).  \n \nIn an effort to move the parties forward, the County suggested a joint \nfunding strategy with the City for certain pilot programs, leaving the \nissue of broader operational costs for another time (perhaps with the \nintervention of a mediator). The City rejected that offer too. The City \nhas requested that the County dedicate additional Measure H or \nother County funds to the City. However, Measure H funds are \ndisproportionately spent in the City. In addition, Measure H funds \nare already appropriated to support the City as well as other \njurisdictions in the region addressing homelessness. Despite these \ndevelopments, the County will continue to pursue partnerships with \nthe City. \n \nCounty Report at 10-11. \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 123   Filed 05/22/20   Page 3 of 13   Page ID #:1943\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \n \nCIVIL MINUTES – GENERAL \n \nCase No. LA CV 20-02291-DOC-KES  Date: May 22, 2020 \n                                              \n     Page 3  \n \nFor its part, the City of Los Angeles, in its Report (Dkt. 114) (“City Report”), filed \nMay 19, 2020, states:  \n \nThe City stands ready to provide the capital costs (subject to \napproval of the City Council) needed to implement a mix of shelter \nand housing solutions to serve a diverse homeless population, in \npartnership with the County of Los Angeles (County) and the Los \nAngeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) to ensure those \nsolutions include the services necessary to keep people off the \nstreets. \n \n. . .  \n \nIn all, the City commits to creating 6,100 new shelter opportunities \nin the next 10 months.2 The City’s plan is contingent upon each \nshelter location receiving the appropriate levels of necessary \nCounty-funded support and operating services. Under the voter \napproved tax initiative Measure H, the County funds operating \nservices for homeless facilities called for in the County Homeless \nStrategy. Operating services include specially trained staff dedicated \nto manage these facilities; case managers who work with clients in \nthe facilities to access housing and other benefits; security services; \nand program enrollments/exits. These operating services are in \naddition to the “mainstream” systems of care (mental health, \nhealthcare, substance abuse, etc.) provided by the County, which are \nalso necessary—but not sufficient—to successfully operate the \nshelter opportunities the City is committed to creating. \n \nCity Report at 2-3.  \n \n  These submissions to the Court, combined with the last-minute collapse of the \nsigned tentative agreement, lead the Court to conclude that there are relatively few \nunresolved issues, and that the remaining issues are tied to the longstanding conflict \nbetween the City and County as to which entity is financially responsible for which \n \n2 On this record, the Court understands that this total of 6,100 shelter opportunities includes the \napproximately 2,200 hotel and motel rooms contracted under Project Roomkey and the approximately \n1,000 shelter beds in recreational centers, and thus represents an increase of approximately 2,900 shelter \nopportunities. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 123   Filed 05/22/20   Page 4 of 13   Page ID #:1944\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \n \nCIVIL MINUTES – GENERAL \n \nCase No. LA CV 20-02291-DOC-KES  Date: May 22, 2020 \n                                              \n     Page 4  \n \nhomeless services. The Court reminds the City and County that these funds are not the \nproperty of the City and County, but have been allocated by the local taxpayers, the State \nof California, and the federal government as funds to provide shelter and services to \npersons experiencing homelessness. Moreover, the disagreement between the City and \nCounty over the relatively minor costs of this pilot program does not bode well for the \nfuture as the program is scaled up across the City and County. It is regrettable that this \nongoing endeavor to develop humane and sustainable responses to the challenges of \nhomelessness is beleaguered by a legacy of bureaucratic entanglement and gridlock. \n \n  The Court commends the efforts that have been undertaken to shelter vulnerable \nresidents of the City and County of Los Angeles during the COVID-19 pandemic. Efforts \nto comply with the Court’s preliminary injunction should broaden—not replace—these \nemergency public health efforts, and the two should run alongside each other, rather than \nsequentially. The City of Los Angeles and County of Los Angeles have the capacity and \nresources to comply with the injunction while maintaining their unprecedented efforts to \nprotect vulnerable residents from COVID-19. \n \nAs the record has developed in this case, the Court has become increasingly \nconcerned that a particular subset of persons experiencing homelessness—those who live \nnear overpasses, underpasses, and ramps on all freeways and City and County streets—\nare exposed to severely heightened public health risks as a result of where they live. \nIndeed, all parties in this action agree that it is unreasonably dangerous for humans to live \nin areas that may, for example, be contaminated with lead or other carcinogenic \nsubstances, which have deleterious health impacts and can shorten a homeless person’s \nlife expectancy by decades.3 These locations also increase the danger that a homeless \nperson will be struck by a vehicle or injured in the event of an earthquake or crash.4 \nCamps in these locations can also burden the general public—for example, by posing \npotential hazards to passing motorists, or by making sidewalks and other rights-of-way \ninaccessible to individuals with disabilities. However, as with many issues involving \n \n3 See California Department of Transportation, Hazardous Waste Assessment of Parcel for Air Space \nLease for Homelessness Solutions Located at 16th Street and Maple Ave., Los Angeles (April 10, 2020) \n[hereinafter Assessment] at 3 (“However, based on the location of the parcel being directly under the \nheavily travelled I-10 Freeway and past use of leaded gasoline, there is a high probability that the \nunpaved soil areas on the parcel and around the perimeter of the parcel at the columns and fence will \ncontain hazardous waste concentrations of lead.”). The Assessment is available at Docket No. 103-1. See \nalso Tr. of Apr. 13, 2020 Proceedings (Dkt. 94) at 75-76 (discussing danger of fumes to “people sleeping \nunder freeways”). \n4 See Tr. of Apr. 13, 2020 Proceedings at 75-76 (noting further danger of “the freeway collapsing in \nearthquakes”). \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 123   Filed 05/22/20   Page 5 of 13   Page ID #:1945\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \n \nCIVIL MINUTES – GENERAL \n \nCase No. LA CV 20-02291-DOC-KES  Date: May 22, 2020 \n                                              \n     Page 5  \n \nindividuals experiencing homelessness, no party appears to be addressing this problem \nwith any urgency.  \n \nThe Court finds that these combined risks constitute an emergency and that a \nresponse cannot wait until this case is resolved by settlement or trial, and hereby \nORDERS that this subset of individuals experiencing homelessness be offered housing \nand subsequently humanely relocated away from overpasses, underpasses, and ramps on \nall freeways and City and County streets (collectively, “overpasses, underpasses, and \nramps”). This preliminary relief is appropriate to remedy the emergency health hazards \nfacing these individuals experiencing homelessness. The Court’s preliminary injunction \nshall be implemented on an ongoing basis independent of the parties’ continuing \nsettlement negotiations. In addition to improving the health and living conditions of \nindividuals experiencing homelessness, the Court anticipates that this preliminary \ninjunction will make the greater Los Angeles area healthier, safer, and more accessible \nfor the general public. \n \nII.  Legal Basis for Preliminary Relief \nA.  Legal Standard \nA district court may order injunctive relief on its own motion and is not restricted \nto ordering the relief requested by a party. Armstrong v. Brown, 768 F.3d 975, 980 (9th \nCir. 2014) (citing Clement v. Cal. Dep’t of Corr., 364 F.3d 1148, 1150 (9th Cir. 2004)). \nA preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary remedy,” requiring courts to balance \ncompeting claims on a case-by-case basis, with “particular regard for the public \nconsequences” of issuing an injunction. Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. \n7, 24 (2008). \n \nFor a court to issue a preliminary injunction, it must find that (1) there is a \nlikelihood of success on the merits; (2) absent preliminary relief, irreparable harm is \nlikely; (3) the balance of equities tips in favor of preliminary relief; and (4) an injunction \nis in the public interest. See Am. Trucking Ass’n, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, 559 F.3d \n1046, 1052 (9th Cir. 2009) (citing Winter, 555 U.S. at 20). The Court has the authority to \nissue a mandatory injunction when the facts and law “clearly favor” issuance. Garcia v. \nGoogle, Inc., 786 F.3d 733, 740 (9th Cir. 2015). \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 123   Filed 05/22/20   Page 6 of 13   Page ID #:1946\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \n \nCIVIL MINUTES – GENERAL \n \nCase No. LA CV 20-02291-DOC-KES  Date: May 22, 2020 \n                                              \n     Page 6  \n \nB.

The California Welfare and Institutions Code provides as \nfollows: \n \nEvery county and every city and county shall relieve and support all \nincompetent, poor, indigent persons, and those incapacitated by age, \ndisease, or accident, lawfully resident therein, when such persons are \nnot supported and relieved by their relatives or friends, by their own \nmeans, or by state hospitals or other state or private institutions. \n \nCal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 17000 (West 2020). This provision is intended “to provide for \nprotection, care, and assistance to the people of the state in need thereof, and to promote \nthe welfare and happiness of all of the people of the state by providing appropriate aid \nand services to all of its needy and distressed.” Id. § 10000. Such aid and services shall be \n“provided promptly and humanely, with due regard for the preservation of family life,” \nand on a non-discriminatory basis. Id. \n \n  The Court finds that, at this stage of the litigation, it is sufficiently clear that the \nCity of Los Angeles and County of Los Angeles have failed to meet these obligations \nunder California law. The City and County of Los Angeles argue that these provisions of \nthe Welfare and Institutions Code cannot serve as the basis of this injunction because \n“there is no mandatory duty in Section 17000 requiring the County to provide shelter to \nindividuals experiencing homelessness.” Resp. of County of Los Angeles (Dkt. 120) at \n11; see also Resp. of City of Los Angeles (Dkt. 121) at 14 (“§ 17000 imposes no \nobligations on the City”). However, the California Supreme Court has “authoritatively \ninterpreted” these provisions and held that “Section 17000 . . . mandates that medical \ncare be provided to indigents and section 10000 requires that such care be provided \npromptly and humanely. . . . There is no discretion concerning whether to provide such \ncare.” Tailfeather v. Bd. of Supervisors, 48 Cal. App. 4th 1223, 1245 (1996) (emphasis \nadded) (summarizing extensive preceding analysis of California case law). To the extent \nthe County and City argue that providing lifesaving housing to individuals experiencing \nhomelessness who live in areas near overpasses, underpasses, and ramps does not qualify \nas “medical care,” their insistence that a hazardous waste assessment be performed before \nusing one such location as a shelter—and the subsequent finding that the location could \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 123   Filed 05/22/20   Page 7 of 13   Page ID #:1947\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \n \nCIVIL MINUTES – GENERAL \n \nCase No. LA CV 20-02291-DOC-KES  Date: May 22, 2020 \n                                              \n     Page 7  \n \nnot be used as shelter due to a high probability of containing “hazardous waste \nconcentrations of lead”—contradicts that proposition. See generally Assessment. \n \n  Constitutional grounds. The Court also finds that the hazardous conditions of \nhomeless camps near overpasses, underpasses, and ramps likely offend the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Fourteenth Amendment provides, in relevant \npart, that no state5 “shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due \nprocess of law.” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. The vision of “liberty” enshrined in the \nDue Process Clause has been interpreted expansively to include rights “not mentioned \nexplicitly in the Constitution.” Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 486 & n.1 \n(Goldberg, J., concurring) (numerous citations omitted). Moreover, it has long been \nestablished that the Due Process Clause guarantees not only procedural protections, but \nalso substantive rights, thereby “barring certain government actions regardless of the \nfairness of the procedures used to implement them.” Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, \n331 (1986).  \n \n  Substantive due process accordingly “forbids the government from depriving a \nperson of life, liberty, or property in such a way that ‘shocks the conscience’ or \n‘interferes with rights implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.’” Nunez v. City of Los \nAngeles, 147 F.3d 867, 870 (9th Cir. 1988) (quoting United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. \n739, 746 (1987)). Although the government is generally “not liable for its omissions,” \nMartinez v. City of Clovis, 943 F.3d 1260, 1270-71 (9th Cir. 2019), a government is \nrequired to act when it has “affirmatively place[d]” its citizens “in danger by acting with \ndeliberate indifference to a known or obvious danger,” Patel v. Kent Sch. Dist., 648 F.3d \n965, 971-72 (9th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted). Here, the City and County of Los \nAngeles have acted with deliberate indifference to individuals experiencing \nhomelessness, whom they allow to reside near overpasses, underpasses, and ramps \ndespite the inherent dangers—such as pollutants and contaminants—of which the City \nand County of Los Angeles have actual knowledge. See, e.g., Assessment at 3 \n(“However, based on the location of the parcel being directly under the heavily travelled \nI-10 Freeway and past use of leaded gasoline, there is a high probability that the unpaved \nsoil areas on the parcel and around the perimeter of the parcel at the columns and fence \nwill contain hazardous waste concentrations of lead.”).  \n \nIndeed, because these locations offer shelter from the elements, by failing to \nprovide adequate shelter or alternative housing options, the City and County of Los \n \n5 Local governments, such as cities and counties, are “state actors” for purposes of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. E.g., Bd. of Trs. V. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 369 (2001). \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 123   Filed 05/22/20   Page 8 of 13   Page ID #:1948\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \n \nCIVIL MINUTES – GENERAL \n \nCase No. LA CV 20-02291-DOC-KES  Date: May 22, 2020 \n                                              \n     Page 8  \n \nAngeles have essentially forced individuals experiencing homelessness to camp in these \ndangerously polluted locations. It is clear to the Court that the Due Process Clause does \nnot allow this kind of governmental conduct. While the Court is not aware of any \nprevious case finding this modest substantive due process right, the Court is confident \nthat this limited right is “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” See Nunez, 147 F.3d \nat 870. As the Supreme Court has held, rights arise not only from “ancient sources,” but \nalso “from a better informed understanding of how constitutional imperatives define a \nliberty that remains urgent in our own era.” Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2602 \n(2015). The severe health hazards attendant on living near overpasses, underpasses, and \nramps—to say nothing of the public health risks illuminated by the ongoing COVID-19 \npandemic—present just such an urgent crisis and better inform the constitutional \nunderstanding of ordered liberty. \n \n  The Ninth Circuit’s recent decision in Martin v. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584, \nfurther illuminates the constitutional values at stake in this litigation. In its analysis of the \nEighth Amendment, the Ninth Circuit held that “the Cruel and Unusual Punishments \nClause not only limits the types of punishment that may be imposed and prohibits the \nimposition of punishment grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime, but also \n‘imposes substantive limits on what can be made criminal and punished as such.’” Martin \nv. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584, 613 (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. \n651, 667 (1977)). The Ninth Circuit concluded that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments \nClause “bars a city from prosecuting people criminally for sleeping outside on public \nproperty when those people have no home or other shelter to go to.” Id. at 603.  \n \n  But if citing an individual experiencing homelessness for sleeping outside rises to \nthe level of cruel and unusual punishment, then—a fortiori—it is likely also cruel and \nunusual to act with such indifference that an individual experiencing homelessness is \nforced to take shelter in an inherently hazardous location. That is, when there is such a \ndearth of available shelter that the best option for an individual experiencing \nhomelessness is to camp in a dangerous location, this functionally constitutes a \npunishment for the crime of being homeless. Much like a formal criminal citation, the \nCourt finds that it is cruel and unusual, in violation of the Eighth Amendment, to leave \nindividuals experiencing homelessness no better option than to camp in hazardous areas \nwhen they have no other available shelter to enter.  \n \n  Given these serious issues of state and federal law, the Court finds that the \nlikelihood of success on the merits clearly favors issuing a preliminary injunction.   \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 123   Filed 05/22/20   Page 9 of 13   Page ID #:1949\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \n \nCIVIL MINUTES – GENERAL \n \nCase No. LA CV 20-02291-DOC-KES  Date: May 22, 2020 \n                                              \n     Page 9  \n \n2.  The Likelihood of Irreparable Harm Justifies Preliminary Relief \nGiven the health hazards described above, the Court has no difficulty finding a \ngrave risk of irreparable harm. When homeless individuals are exposed to such dangers \nas toxic fumes, “hazardous waste concentrations of lead,” car crashes, and the potential \ncollapse of an overpass in an earthquake, their health is threatened in a way that monetary \ndamages cannot adequately compensate. Additionally, homeless persons living near \noverpasses, underpasses, and ramps need not suffer these harms at all—or, at least, need \nnot suffer them any further—and this outcome could be achieved with a preliminary \ninjunction. \n \nBecause of the public health risks inherent in living near overpasses, underpasses, \nand ramps, the Court finds that the homeless individuals that live in such locations clearly \nface a likelihood of irreparable harm, justifying a preliminary injunction. \n \n3.  The Balance of Equities Tips in Favor of Preliminary Relief \nAs already discussed, the homeless individuals who live near overpasses, \nunderpasses, and ramps face severe health hazards. By comparison, the City of Los \nAngeles and County of Los Angeles would only need to invest relatively modest \nfinancial and administrative resources to provide safe and healthy shelters to these \nindividuals. As such, the Court finds that the balance of the equities clearly weighs in \nfavor of an injunction. \n \n4.  A Preliminary Injunction Is in the Public Interest \nFinally, a humane relocation away from overpasses, underpasses, and ramps in \nsupport of public health will promote the public interest. A district court should look at \nthe injunction’s impact on non-parties in determining what is in the “public interest.” \nLeague of Wilderness Defs./Blue Mountains Biodiversity Project v. Connaughton, 752 \nF.3d 755, 766 (9th Cir. 2014) (quoting Sammartano v. First Judicial Dist. Court, 303 \nF.3d 959, 974 (9th Cir. 2002)). The Court finds that this preliminary injunction will \nsubstantially benefit public health at large. Providing housing for individuals \nexperiencing homelessness—and ensuring that appropriate CDC guidance is followed at \nthe locations that will shelter those individuals—will not only help stop the spread of \nCOVID-19 amongst the population impacted by this injunction, but will also reduce the \nlikelihood that disease will spread throughout the greater Los Angeles community. \nFurthermore, the public has a right to have local ordinances enforced when City and \nCounty actors can legally do so. This injunction will allow the enforcement of anti-\n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 123   Filed 05/22/20   Page 10 of 13   Page ID\n #:1950\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \n \nCIVIL MINUTES – GENERAL \n \nCase No. LA CV 20-02291-DOC-KES  Date: May 22, 2020 \n                                              \n     Page 10  \n \ncamping ordinances at an appropriate time and in compliance with Martin v. Boise. Such \nenforcement is also in the public interest. \n \nTherefore, the Court finds that this factor clearly favors an order of preliminary \nrelief. \n \nIII.  Provisions of Preliminary Injunction \nTo protect the individuals experiencing homelessness camping near overpasses, \nunderpasses, and ramps—and the general public—the Court hereby ORDERS that \nindividuals experiencing homelessness camped within 500 feet of an overpass, underpass, \nor ramp must be offered housing as described below and subsequently humanely \nrelocated at least 500 feet away from such areas by no later than September 1, 2020.6 As \npart of this humane relocation effort, and to promote the underlying public health and \nsafety goals, the City of Los Angeles and County of Los Angeles must provide shelter—\nor alternative housing options, such as government encampments following the existing \nVeterans Affairs model, safe parking sites, or hotel and motel rooms contracted following \nthe Project Roomkey model—to individuals experiencing homelessness. In addition to \nthe foregoing examples, the Court is open to receiving any other suggestions from the \nparties for reasonable alternative housing options. \n \nAs shelters are established and homeless camps are relocated away from \noverpasses, underpasses, and ramps, the following criteria, at a minimum, must be \nsatisfied to ensure the process remains humane and serves the best interests of the \naffected individuals experiencing homelessness and the general public: \n \n(1) All shelters and alternative housing options must be configured with adequate \nphysical space to allow the sheltered individuals to maintain the minimum \nrecommended social distance of six feet to mitigate the transmission of \nSARS-CoV-2. \n \n6 The requirement of 500 feet is taken from the City of Los Angeles Department of City Planning, \nwhich reports that “[a]ir pollution studies indicate a strong link between chronic exposure to vehicle \nexhaust and particulate matter from roads and freeways and elevated risk of adverse health impacts . . . . \nAreas located within 500 feet of a freeway are known to experience the greatest concentrations of fine \nand ultrafine particulate matter (PM), a pollutant implicated in asthma and other health conditions.” City \nof Los Angeles Department of City Planning, Freeway Adjacent Advisory Notice, Zoning Information \nFile No. 2427, at 1 (2018). This Advisory Notice is available at the following URL: \nhttp://zimas.lacity.org/documents/zoneinfo/ZI2427.pdf. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 123   Filed 05/22/20   Page 11 of 13   Page ID\n #:1951\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \n \nCIVIL MINUTES – GENERAL \n \nCase No. LA CV 20-02291-DOC-KES  Date: May 22, 2020 \n                                              \n     Page 11  \n \n(2) All shelters and alternative housing options must have adequate hygiene \nfacilities, such as handwashing stations and showers. \n(3) All shelters and alternative housing options must have qualified staff who, \nupon intake, can test each homeless individual for communicable diseases and \nother health conditions. The Court may consider revising this aspect of the \npreliminary injunction in the future, depending on the state of the COVID-19 \npandemic.  \n(4) If any individual experiencing homelessness tests positive for COVID-19, that \nindividual must be sheltered in a facility in which they can be individually \nisolated until they recover. \n(5) All shelters and alternative housing options must be staffed by security as \nnecessary to ensure the safety of the homeless persons sheltered therein. \n(6) Before beginning the process of clearing overpasses, underpasses, and ramps, \nall homeless individuals living in the vicinity must be given advance notice of \nat least ten days; such notice shall include information about available shelters \nand alternative housing options in that council district or supervisorial district. \n(7) At a minimum, in the interim period between notice and relocation, social \nworkers, mental health workers, and LAHSA authorities shall reach out to \nnoticed individuals experiencing homelessness to provide services and \nfacilitate the transition to shelter. The Court also encourages such outreach to \noccur as early as possible, even before notice is given. \n(8) The City and County of Los Angeles may not relocate individuals experiencing \nhomelessness in a given council district or supervisorial district until after such \nnotice is given, and after the City of Los Angeles and/or County of Los \nAngeles provide adequate alternative shelter for all individuals experiencing \nhomelessness in that council district or supervisorial district. After these \nconditions are met, the City of Los Angeles and County of Los Angeles will be \nallowed to enforce anti-camping laws in that council district or supervisorial \ndistrict within 500 feet of overpasses, underpasses, and ramps located. This \nprocess helps to ensure that these individuals are being moved to safer \nlocations. To be clear, while an individual experiencing homelessness cannot \nbe ordered to enter a shelter facility, they must be given that option, and if they \ndecline, can then be ordered to relocate at least 500 feet away from an \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 123   Filed 05/22/20   Page 12 of 13   Page ID\n #:1952\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \n \nCIVIL MINUTES – GENERAL \n \nCase No. LA CV 20-02291-DOC-KES  Date: May 22, 2020 \n                                              \n     Page 12  \n \noverpass, underpass, or ramp. If, during the humane relocation process, a social \nworker, mental health worker, law enforcement officer, or other qualified \npersonnel encounters an individual exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, such \nindividual should be referred to an individual testing and quarantine process, \nsuch as, but not limited to, Project Roomkey. If all of the above requirements \nare met, then relocation in these limited areas would be fully compliant with \nMartin v. City of Boise.7  \nAs they begin efforts to comply with this preliminary injunction, the City of Los \nAngeles and County of Los Angeles are responsible for disentangling which entity has \nauthority over the subject locations and the relevant funding mechanisms. \n \nThe Court is hopeful that this initial, limited action will assist the parties moving \nforward, as they work to overcome years of bureaucratic inertia and develop humane \nsolutions in the best interests of both individuals experiencing homelessness and the \ngeneral public. Indeed, the parties’ efforts to provide emergency shelter and services \nsince the onset of the COVID-19 crisis present a stark contrast to the characteristic \ninaction that has persisted for years with respect to homelessness in the greater Los \nAngeles area. The Court is concerned, however, that as the COVID-19 pandemic \nsubsides, the present momentum will be lost to longstanding disputes over funding and \njurisdictional authority. The most recent filings by the City and County of Los Angeles, \nquoted at length above, already demonstrate a resurgence of the quarreling and deadlock \nsurrounding the issues of homelessness. \n \nNotwithstanding the failure of the parties to reach an agreement on the terms and \nconditions of a settlement, the Court, based on input from both City and County elected \nofficials, as well as Plaintiffs and Intervenors, finds these decision-makers are fully aware \nof the crises created by homelessness in our communities and are dedicated to \nformulating solutions that will not only improve the living conditions of our homeless \npopulation, but also enhance the opportunities for the general public to enjoy the benefits \n \n7 The Court hereby takes judicial notice of the Interim Guidance on People Experiencing Unsheltered \nHomelessness issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) in response to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The CDC recommends, inter alia: “If individual housing options are not available, \nallow people who are living unsheltered or in encampments to remain where they are. Clearing \nencampments can cause people to disperse throughout the community and break connections with service \nproviders. This increases the potential for disease spread.” The Court’s preliminary injunction complies \nwith the CDC’s Interim Guidance, because providing shelter is a prerequisite to relocating individuals. \nThe CDC’s Interim Guidance is available at the following URL: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/community/homeless-shelters/unsheltered-homelessness.html. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 123   Filed 05/22/20   Page 13 of 13   Page ID\n #:1953\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \n \nCIVIL MINUTES – GENERAL \n \nCase No. LA CV 20-02291-DOC-KES  Date: May 22, 2020 \n                                              \n     Page 13  \n \nthat will result from an enlightened approach in addressing these issues. All parties have \nthe same goal in mind; their differences lie in the route to be followed in achieving that \ngoal. The Court is confident a global solution to the homelessness crisis will be found \nwhile the parties take the initial step of remedying the emergency health hazards targeted \nby this injunction. \n \nTo facilitate the Court’s monitoring of compliance with the terms of this \npreliminary injunction, the Court will require periodic status reports from the parties as to \ntheir progress. The first such report shall be filed with the Court no later than 12:00 noon \non Friday, June 12, 2020. At minimum, this report shall detail a plan for establishing \nshelter and clearing overpasses, underpasses, and ramps in each council district or \nsupervisorial district no later than September 1, 2020. The Court reserves the authority to \nadvance the deadline of September 1, 2020 in the event that the interim status reports do \nnot demonstrate satisfactory progress towards compliance with the preliminary \ninjunction. Furthermore, the Court shall conduct additional hearings to monitor \ncompliance as the Court finds necessary. \n \n \nThe Clerk shall serve this minute order on the parties.  \n \n \nMINUTES FORM 11    Initials of Deputy Clerk: kd \nCIVIL-GEN \n ",

Carter, in Courtroom 9D of the Ronald Reagan Federal Building \n4  and United States Courthouse, located at 411 West Fourth Street, Santa Ana, California, \n5  Defendant CITY OF LOS ANGELES (“the City”) will, and hereby does, move the Court \n6  to dismiss the Amended and Supplemental Complaint (the “FASC”) filed by Plaintiffs \n7  LA ALLIANCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, an unincorporated association, JOSEPH \n8  BURK, GEORGE FREM, WENZIAL JARRELL, CHARLES MALOW, KARYN \n9  PINSKY, LEANDRO SUAREZ, HARRY TASHDJIAN, CHARLES VAN SCOY, and, \n10  GARY WHITTER, individuals (collectively “Plaintiffs”) pursuant to Federal Rules of \n11  Civil Procedure (“FRCP”) 8, 12(b)(1), and 12(b)(6).1  The FASC is inadequately pleaded, \n12  fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, and asserts claims over which the \n13  Court lacks jurisdiction. \n14  Pursuant to Local Rule 7-3, on November 23, 2021, counsel for the City met and \n15  conferred with counsel for Plaintiffs via teleconference to discuss informal resolution of \n16  this motion.

In addition, the FASC: (1) violates principles of separation of powers and \n22  federalism; (2) fails to allege a cognizable violation of the Americans with Disabilities \n23  Act (“ADA”); (3) fails to allege a discriminatory purpose, a discriminatory policy or \n24  legislation, or rebut the presumption that facially non-discriminatory practices have a \n25  rational basis; (4) invokes the state-created-danger doctrine, which is inapplicable; (5) \n26 \n                                           \n27  1 Counsel for Plaintiffs and the City stipulated to the hearing date and time, and briefing \nschedule, for the City’s Motion.

For these reasons, dismissal is warranted under FRCP 8 \n6  and 12(b)(6). \n7  This motion is based on this Notice of Motion, the accompanying Memorandum of \n8  Points and Authorities, the pleadings and other papers on file in this action, and such \n9  further argument and evidence as may be offered at the time of the hearing on this \n10  Motion. \n11   \n12  DATED:  December 3, 2021  By: /s/                                                                 _ \nArlene N.

The Alliance includes non-profits, service providers, small \n4  business owners, residents, and community members who are saddened by the \n5  suffering on our streets and fed up with excuses about the status quo. \n6    Homelessness in Los Angeles is a tragic and deteriorating crisis. There are \n7  thousands of people living on our streets in medieval conditions. The City, \n8  County, and State are expending record amounts to address homelessness, but \n9  progress is incremental at best. City leaders face the challenges of out-of-date \n10  state laws, legal settlements and decisions that limit their options (including the \nP  1  11  Mitchell settlement), and neighborhoods that are skeptical about how this crisis is \nL 71\nSpertus, Landes & Umhofer, L1990SBD.,S705  OUTH UNDY R UITE A,CA90025 LOS NGELES  310-826-4700;F310-826-4TELEPHONE  ACSIMILE  1111123456       omilmiuvurpes saut— cnatPsciahntln aegwdil ntti ehttthhirefee ifudr sf r  wungsuteeeupinlgrlpce-hyob bo reaofti  nnratsdhgn  e.idi n mT Csshitaidategynesi  denai  nanowt dbiaio sntChnt ae o atcxuonlpen yaest dyd ocd—iratrgineoaansunrsoesi tz t  aahabtnit esisdo  tec anexrkc icaseoudi.ns svT oeiommhsc ewaim ctChiaenieldtglnyyi a  f satfooeenrl a dymbs .irC abi nnoleygu  inntgy  \n17  manner.

The Parties requested dismissal of this action due to \n13  settlement because they believed their agreement was critical to effectuating Plaintiffs’ \n14  settlement with the City of Los Angeles and would bring valuable additional resources \n15  to people experiencing homelessness (“PEH”).   \n16  At its core, the Settlement Agreement between the County and Plaintiffs was \n17  intended to build on the success of the City and County’s collaboration under the \n18  “freeway deal”—as memorialized in the June 2020 Memorandum of Understanding \n19  [Dkt. 136, 185].1  Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the County committed \n20  to funding a suite of wraparound services at the thousands of interim and permanent \n21  supportive housing units financed by the City pursuant to its settlement with Plaintiffs \n22  through the end of the 2026–2027 fiscal year, connecting clients with available local, \n23  State, and federal benefits to which they are entitled (including linkage to mental \n24  health and substance use disorder (“SUD”) treatment services.  [See Dkt. 421 (City \n25 \n26  1 The freeway deal is an agreement between the City and County, whereby the \nCity agreed to provide 6,700 housing or shelter beds for vulnerable PEH, including \n27  those residing under freeway overpasses, and the County agreed to assist the City with \nfunding services for the new beds in the amount of $293 million and provide a package \n28  of mainstream services to PEH residing in facilities established by the City pursuant to \nthis MOU.   \nSECOND ADDENDUM TO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND STIPULATION FOR \nDISMISSAL\n\nCCaassee  22::2200--ccvv--0022229911--DDOOCC--KKEESS      DDooccuummeenntt  664467      FFiilleedd  0099//2289//2233      PPaaggee  44  ooff  4406      PPaaggee  IIDD\n##::1199458288\n1  settlement).]  Experts agree that it is only the combination of housing/shelter and \n2  supportive services that will bring meaningful relief to PEH by helping them transition \n3  out of homelessness and receive access to benefits to maintain housing.   \n4  The Settlement Agreement contained a number of other benefits for PEH, \n5  including but not limited to: \n6  • The County agreed to make reasonable best efforts to ensure County\n7  outreach teams have access to County Homeless Initiative-funded high\n8  service need interim housing beds for PEH in the City.\n9  • The County agreed to dramatically expand the number of Multi-\n10  Disciplinary Teams (“MDTs”) and Homeless Outreach & Mobile\n11  Engagement (“HOME”) teams that do field engagement (including on\n12  Skid Row) to connect the most vulnerable PEH—unsheltered and living\n13  with complex health or behavioral conditions, and/or a serious mental\n14  illness—and connect them to necessary services and housing.  The\n15  agreement guarantees a 50 to 80 percent increase from current numbers.\n16  • The County agreed to work with the City in making available to each\n17  other appropriate City- and/or County-owned land, to create new interim\n18  or permanent supportive housing units.\n19  As a sign of its commitment, the County moved forward with implementing the \n20  key terms of the Settlement Agreement even after the Court denied dismissal which is \n21  why the bed funding agreement within the Settlement Agreement is retroactive to \n22  2022. \n23  Attached hereto as Exhibit B is the Parties’ Proposed Second Addendum to \n24  their Settlement Agreement.2  This Second Addendum further supplements the \n25 \n26  2 The Parties’ submitted their First Addendum to the Settlement Agreement on \nApril 18, 2023, along with a renewed request for an order dismissing Plaintiffs’ claims \n27  against the County with prejudice under Rule 41(a)(2) [Dkt. 533].  Attached hereto as \nExhibit C is the Parties’ fully-executed First Addendum to their Settlement \n28  Agreement.  The Second Addendum further augments the material terms of the \nAgreement and First Addendum. \n2\nJOINT SUBMISSION OF SECOND ADDENDUM TO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\n\nCCaassee  22::2200--ccvv--0022229911--DDOOCC--KKEESS      DDooccuummeenntt  664467      FFiilleedd  0099//2289//2233      PPaaggee  55  ooff  4406      PPaaggee  IIDD\n##::1199458299\n1  Settlement Agreement in three key ways: \n2  3,000 New Mental Health/Substance Use Disorder Beds: The Parties recognize \n3  the co-occurrence of homelessness, mental illness, and/or substance use disorder \n4  (SUD) and, by extension, the importance of connecting eligible PEH with mental \n5  health and SUD treatment and sustainable housing attached to needed treatment to help \n6  lift them out of homelessness.  Under the Second Addendum, the County is funding \n7  3,000 new mental health/SUD beds for high acuity PEH and PEH with serious mental \n8  illness and/or SUD—a 900 percent increase from the original Settlement \n9  Agreement.3  These 3,000 beds are an array of beds along the continuum of care in \n10  order to best support the different levels of needs of the County’s PEH population, \n11  from treatment beds to housing beds with treatment services.  The beds pair mental \n12  health and/or SUD services with eligible individuals and PEH in need of ongoing \n13  medical care.  The individuals consist of current Department of Mental Health \n14  (DMH)/Department of Public Health, Substance Abuse Prevention and Control \n15  (SAPC) clients who need these types of care for their recovery journey and individuals \n16  whom the departments are trying to enroll in DMH/SAPC services for their \n17  health.  Even if a client does not meet the licensed beds criteria, the continuum still \n18  provides options for mental health and/or SUD treatment and sustainable housing.  By \n19  offering a spectrum of treatment options and housing settings, the County is best able \n20  to meet the varied needs of PEH and more precisely address their individualized needs \n21  in order to maximize their likelihood of long-term recovery. \n22  450 New “Board and Care” Subsidies: The County intends to make available \n23  450 new enhanced-rate subsidies for enriched residential care at licensed Adult \n24  Residential Facilities (“ARFs”) and Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly \n25  (“RCFEs”).  These facilities are a vital housing resource for the County’s indigent \n26  population and are often utilized by individuals who are homeless or at risk of \n27 \n28  3 The 3,000 new mental health/SUD beds under the Second Addendum is the \ntotal number of new beds under the Settlement Agreement between the Parties.   \n3\nJOINT SUBMISSION OF SECOND ADDENDUM TO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\n\nCCaassee  22::2200--ccvv--0022229911--DDOOCC--KKEESS      DDooccuummeenntt  664467      FFiilleedd  0099//2289//2233      PPaaggee  66  ooff  4406      PPaaggee  IIDD\n##::1199459300\n1 homeleasnsndne eecsdaas rn esd u pervmiasiinohtnoa uitsnToi h nEegn .r iched \n2 ResidCeanr(te\"i EaRlpC r\"o)g irasad immn isbtyte hrDeee dp arotfMm eenntta l \n3 Heaalntsdhe  rtvdoee sc omipnrsetsisst uuactshhi  oosnpsoi Irt nasltsfoi rtM uetnetsa l \n4 Dise(a\"sIeMD i\"n)c,l tuhdoiwsnheago r  heo meolraert si sos fbk e comhionmge less \n5 duteto h nee efodra  h iglheevorefc l a rOev.et rh efe wly aesattr hsefa,sc ei lhiatviee s \n6 beefanc ianneg x iistacelrn idtsutielos o  rwe imburrastteehmosaeu tntpt a ce \n7 mainteannoadpn ecreca otsiwtnhsgih, ca hfos r ctehdce l oosfum raenfa yc ilaintdi es \n8 threatthheeon uessdit nagbo ifml ainotyfty  h Ceou ntmyo'svstu  lnerreasbildee nts. \n9 Thseu bsuindditeehFrsei   rAsddted nuamr vea lauatep dp rox$i4mm0ai tlelalinydo  n \nIOw ihlelal dpad na  ddit4i5co0ln iaeln tttosh  pedr aoigwlrhyai mcc,uh r rseenrtvleys  \n11a pprox7i3m8a tienldyIi dnvo iidsnuotga,h Fl eis Ar.ds dte nwdiuhlmel kl epeA pR Fs \n12a nRdC FiEnos p eraantedin ocno uardadgieAt RiFoasnn aRdlC  FtEoosp  en, thus \n13p resetrhhvioisun sgoi pnpgno irfottrycu  lientst hweehx tosr unape ppeordro tvb iyd ed \n14l icernesseiddc eanfartceii alalin t2di4 ec/sa7a r ned  sup.e.r vision \n15  AppointmoeHfno tnJ .aC. v G andAhsMi o niottfoh Prea  rtSieetst'l ement:\n16T hS�e coAnddd enaduugmm tehnaetc sc ounptraobviilsiittoyhne esx  iusntdienrg  \n17S etttl_A egrmeee mbeyan dtd JiundgJg aCey.

David O. Carter \n28\nand Magistrate Judge Karen E. Scott \n  \n503239.1   Case No. 2:20-cv-02291 DOC-KES\nDEFENDANT LOS ANGELES COUNTY’S NOTICE OF MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 256   Filed 03/29/21   Page 2 of 3   Page ID #:4456\n \n1 TO THE COURT, ALL PARTIES AND THEIR COUNSEL OF RECORD:  \n2 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE THAT, pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) \n3 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Defendant Los Angeles County (the \n4 “County”) hereby moves to dismiss all claims asserted by Plaintiffs in the \n5 Complaint against the County for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure \n6 to state a claim.  This Motion is set for hearing on May 10, 2021 before the \n7 Honorable David O. Carter in the United States District Court, Central District of \n8 California, Western Division, located at 411 West Fourth Street, Courtroom 9D, \n9 Santa Ana, CA, 92701-4516.  \n10 The Motion is well-taken.  Under Rule 12(b)(1), dismissal for lack of subject \n11 matter jurisdiction should be granted because Plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged \n12 Article III standing and “prudential” standing to assert their claims against the \n13 County.  Plaintiffs have not alleged injuries that are “fairly traceable” to the alleged \n14 conduct of the County.  Plaintiffs’ claims are also not redressible because the broad \n15 and unmanageable injunction that they seek cannot be issued by this Court.  Further, \n16 as a prudential matter, this Court cannot exercise jurisdiction because Plaintiffs are \n17 asserting generalized grievances against the County on behalf of third parties not \n18 before the Court and seek remedies that cannot be awarded by this Court. \n19 In addition, under Rule 12(b)(6), Plaintiffs have not stated any of their federal \n20 or state law claims against the County.  Plaintiffs’ federal claims against the County \n21 are all asserted under 42 U.S.C. section 1983 and allege violations of the Fourteenth \n22 Amendment to the United States Constitution.  But these claims fail because \n23 Plaintiffs have not alleged that (1) the County infringed fundamental rights or \n24 engaged in arbitrary action that shocks the conscience, (2) the County discriminated \n25 against suspect classes with deliberate indifference, (3) the County’s officials \n26 affirmatively placed any Plaintiff in imminent risk of bodily harm, or (4) that the \n27 County could be liable, even if any of the above had been alleged, because the harm \n28 was caused by an official County policy, practice or custom under Monell. \n  \n503239.1   Case No. 2:20-cv-02291 DOC-KES\nDEFENDANT LOS ANGELES COUNTY’S NOTICE OF MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 256   Filed 03/29/21   Page 3 of 3   Page ID #:4457\n \n1 Plaintiffs’ state law claims fail as well because Plaintiffs invoke state statutes \n2 that grant the County discretion over how to spend funds and provide services to \n3 combat homelessness.  Further, the common law claims fail for an additional reason \n4 as the County and its policy-making officials are immune from suit under the \n5 California Government Code. \n6 This Motion is made following the conference of counsel pursuant to L.R. 7-3 \n7 that took place on Monday, March 22, 2021.  (Declaration of Mira Hashmall  \n8 ¶ 20 & Ex. 19.)  This Motion is based on this Notice, the accompanying \n9 Memorandum of Law, the Declaration of Mira Hashmall and exhibits attached \n10 thereto, the Request for Judicial Notice, the pleadings and records on file in this \n11 action, and any further evidence or argument received by the Court in connection \n12 with the Motion. \n13  \n14 DATED:  March 29, 2021  MILLER BARONDESS, LLP \n \n15\n \n16  \n  By:  /s/ Louis R.

INTRODUCTION \n \nIn the ebb of afternoon sunlight, young Americans looked at their former \ncompatriots as adversaries as they advanced towards them. Young teenagers \ncarried battle flags to rally upon in the chaos that would soon ensue. There is \nnothing free about freedom. It is borne from immense pain, suffering, and \nsacrifice. Our country has struggled since the Emancipation Proclamation to right \nthe evil of slavery. One hundred and fifty-eight years ago, at the site of the \nbloodiest battle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln made a short and profound \nspeech, exemplifying an unshakable moral commitment to end the abomination of \nslavery despite the terrible sacrifice of life.  \n \nNow we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation \nor any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are \nmet on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a \nportion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave \ntheir lives that that nation might live. . . . \n \nIt is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished \nwork which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It \nis rather for us to be dedicated to the great task remaining before us—\nthat from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause \nfor which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here \nhighly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this \nnation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that \ngovernment, of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not \nperish from the earth. \n \nThe Civil War brought a formal end to the institution of slavery, but a \ncentury and a half after the Gettysburg Address, the “unfinished work” of which \nPresident Lincoln spoke remains woefully unfinished.  \nHere in Los Angeles, how did racism become embedded in the policies and \nstructures of our new city? What if there was a conscious effort, a deliberate intent, \na cowardice of inaction? Through redlining, containment, eminent domain, \nexclusionary zoning, and gentrification—designed to segregate and disenfranchise \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 4 of 110   Page ID\n#:7240\n \ncommunities of color—the City and County of Los Angeles created a legacy of \nentrenched structural racism. As shown most clearly in the present crisis of \nhomelessness, the effects of structural racism continue to threaten the lives of \npeople of color in Los Angeles.  \nToday, people of color, and Black people in particular, are vastly \noverrepresented in Los Angeles’s homeless population. While Black people \ncomprise only eight percent of Los Angeles’s population, they make up 42% of its \nhomeless population.1 As of January 2020, the Los Angeles Homeless Services \nAuthority reported that 21,509 Black people were without permanent housing in \nLos Angeles (LAHSA).2 The current inaction on the part of the City and County of \nLos Angeles has allowed the harms of their racist legacy to continue unabated, \nleaving Black people—and especially Black women—effectively abandoned on \nthe streets. Such governmental inertia has affected not only Black Angelenos, not \nonly homeless Angelenos, but all Angelenos—of every race, gender identity, and \nsocial class. Virtually every citizen of Los Angeles has borne the impacts of the \nCity and County’s continued failure to meaningfully confront the crisis of \nhomelessness. The time has come to redress these wrongs and finish another \nmeasure of our nation’s unfinished work. \n \nA. RACE \n \n“I want to be very clear,” said Heidi Marston, Director of the Los Angeles \nHomeless Services Authority, “homelessness is a byproduct of racism. We \ncontinue to see that Black people are overrepresented in our homeless population, \nand that Black African Americans are four times more likely to become homeless \nthan their white counterparts.”3 A LAHSA report published in December of 2018 \nconfirmed the Director’s opinion, stating: “The impact of institutional and \nstructural racism in education, criminal justice, housing, employment health care, \n \n1 Jugal K.

As mentioned previously, \nBlack Angelenos are vastly overrepresented in the homeless population.5 From \n2016 to 2017, the city saw a 22% increase in the number of unhoused Black \nAngelenos.6 Yet, in the same period, the number of white Angelenos experiencing \nhomelessness decreased by 7%.7 Further, racism in Los Angeles is far from simply \nblack and white—Latinos make up at least 35% of the homeless population, a \nfigure that likely undercounts the number of Latinos homeless.8 The effects of \ndecades-long structural and institutional racism resulting in unhoused populations \nhas reached an apex that must be addressed. \n \ni.  Historical Context \n \n According to the LAHSA, “Black people have been historically and \nsystematically precluded from housing opportunities, including through redlining, \nexclusionary zoning, and other forms of discrimination codified by federal, state, \nand local law. While laws have changed, the effects of these previous policies are \nstill pervasive.”9  \n \nEarly Twentieth Century \n \n  In the first half of the twentieth century, migrant workers were drawn to Los \nAngeles for seasonal industries and cheap lodging available in Los Angeles’ \n \n4 L.A.

Known today as “redlining,” the safety \nmaps categorized neighborhoods as “best,” “still desirable,” “declining,” or \n“hazardous.” Neighborhoods were categorized based on “favorable” and \n“detrimental” factors, such as the “threat of infiltration of foreign-born, negro, or \nlower grade population.” Black and immigrant neighborhoods were repeatedly \nrated “hazardous” and outlined in red—creating a “state-sponsored system of \nsegregation.”28 The rating system was widely used by HOLC, as well as private \nlending institutions, who denied residents in “redlined” neighborhoods access to \nloans or capital investment. The Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), \nestablished in 1934, accelerated segregation by refusing to insure mortgages in and \nnear Black neighborhoods. 29 The FHA even subsidized builders to construct entire \nsubdivisions for white communities, so long as the homes were not sold to Black \npeople. 30 \nPeople living in redlined neighborhoods were restricted from these federally \nbacked avenues of credit for decades.31 This cycle of disinvestment blocked \ncommunities of color from the accumulation of intergenerational wealth that \nflowed in white neighborhoods due to government supported financial security in \nhome ownership in areas with steady growth in property value. 32   \nFederal housing policies by the HOLC and the FHA have created a lasting \nwealth gap. By the time the Fair Housing Act outlawed racial discrimination in \nhousing in 1968, suburban homes had grown substantially in value.33 Whereas \nwhite families enjoyed this growth in equity as financial security, Black families \nwere blocked from this growth from the beginning.34  \nWhile a Black person today earns on average 60% of what their white \ncounterpart earns, Black American wealth is only about five percent of white \nAmerican wealth.35  Decades of depressed property values stemming from \n \n28 RICHARD ROTHSTEIN, THE COLOR OF LAW: A FORGOTTEN HISTORY OF HOW OUR GOVERNMENT SEGREGATED \nAMERICA 64 (2017); Terry Gross, A ‘Forgotten History’ of How the U.S. Government Segregated America, NPR, \n(May 3, 2017), https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-\nsegregated-america. \n29 ROTHSTEIN, supra note 28, at 64.  \n30 Id. at 64–65.  \n31 Terry Gross, A ‘Forgotten History’ of How the U.S. Government Segregated America, NPR, (May 3, 2017), \nhttps://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america. \n32 Id. \n33 Id. \n34 Id. \n35 Id. \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 9 of 110   Page ID\n#:7245\n \nHOLC’s “hazardous” labeling paved the way for present-day gentrification: it \nallowed white homeowners with growing equity to purchase devalued property in \nformerly redlined neighborhoods.36  \nThe effects of these housing policies have consequences beyond a wealth \ngap. White Americans developed financial stability, and thus safety nets, that \nBlack Americans were excluded from.

In 1976, the \nhomeless population became spatially concentrated in the fifty-square-block \n“containment zone” of Skid Row.  \nDevelopers and businesses urged the City to adopt a “silver book” plan in \n1972.75 The plan sought to raze Skid Row and wholly transform the existing \nneighborhood by 1990.76 Skid Row stakeholders raised concerns that razing Skid \nRow would disperse the homeless population and negatively affect downtown \nbusiness.77 The City, won over by this sentiment, instead adopted the alternative \n“Blue Book Plan,” which sought to “contain” homeless people to maintain the \npristineness of the business district. 78 The plan adopted a fifty-block “physical \ncontainment” zone designed to contain and perpetuate poverty.

The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) set up \nphysical buffers to reduce movement past the Skid Row border and enforce \ncontainment.82 Flood lights demarcated the border, disincentivizing homeless from \nstraying outside the containment area.83  \nThe City and advocates’ containment policy entrenched poverty and fostered \nthe three most unsafe neighborhoods in the nation today.84 According to Forbes, \n“[t]he most dangerous neighborhood in America is in Los Angeles,” two square \nblocks in the northern half of Skid Row.85 The second most dangerous \nneighborhood within American borders is intertwined with the southern edge of \nSkid Row.86 Finally, the nation’s third most dangerous neighborhood is the \nsouthern half of Skid Row.87  \n “Skid Row is on the bottom of the totem pole of life here in America and is \ncommonly known as the homeless capital of America.

By demarcating \nSkid Row as a concentration for rehabilitation services, the City created a \ncentralized place where police could make sweeping arrests for minor drug \noffenses or crimes based on poverty (e.g. resting or sleeping on the sidewalk). The \nensuing cycle of incarceration and homelessness—disproportionately targeting \nBlack communities—has continued for decades.  \nIn 2007, Los Angeles Police Department Chief William J. Bratton enacted \nthe “broken windows” policing policy.91 Under Chief Bratton’s “Safer Cities \nInitiative,” a task force of 50 officers entered Skid Row issuing citations and \nmaking arrests for infractions such as jaywalking, prostitution and littering. 92 The \nprogram ended shortly after a Los Angeles Police Department officer fatally shot a \nhomeless person of color on Skid Row in 2015. “On skid row, the windows \nalready were broken,” Los Angeles City Attorney Feuer said, “we have a much \ndeeper and more profound situation to deal with.”93 \nCity officials contend that they denounce “criminalizing” homelessness.94 \nBut data tells a different story.

Los Angeles is facing rising housing insecurity, demanding a critical \nevaluation of how affordable housing serves—or rather, fails to serve—our \ncommunities when compared to public housing. \n \n30 Years of “Affordability” \n \nThe affordable housing public-private partnership model began in 1959, \nwhen the federal government offered below market interest rates to private \ndevelopers to incentivize development of rental housing for individuals who could \nnot afford housing at market rates but earned too much to qualify for public \nhousing.132 The partnership was at first limited to nonprofit developers, but for-\nprofit builders lobbied for inclusion and drafted new programs with one percent \neffective interest rates, profit structures riddled with loopholes, and exit strategies. \n133   \nThe exit strategies and profit structures are exemplified in one of the first \napartments created under the affordable housing model—Concord Apartments in \nPasadena, California. 134 Three years after purchasing the apartments, the owner of \nthe building prepaid the subsidized mortgage, doubled tenants’ rents, and moved to \nauction the building at a substantial profit. 135 Over 150 elderly tenants of the \nConcord Apartments filed suit against the owner to contest the increased rent and \nhalt the sale, and eventually, the city of Pasadena purchased the land, ultimately \nsafeguarding housing security and long-term affordability for the residents and \nstymieing the efforts of the for-profit developer.136  \nA 1973 report sponsored by the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment cited sweeping critiques of incentive schemes: “Private enterprise \nwas ‘getting rich’ at the expense of low- and moderate-income families… The \nsubsidies offered were not sufficient and did not aid the families who most needed \nthem.”137 Despite these critiques, the Nixon administration issued a moratorium on \npublic housing construction, entrenching the nation’s reliance on private \n \n132 Id. \n133 Id. \n134 Id. \n135 Id. \n136 Id. \n137 Id. \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 23 of 110   Page ID\n#:7259\n \ndevelopers to provide affordable housing opportunities.138 The following year, the \nNixon administration distributed block grants for states to administer their own \nincentive programs—thereby reducing federal authority and increasing reliance on \nprivate developers.139  \nThe Tax Reform Act of 1986 developed a tax credit system that is still in use \ntoday to incentivize private developers to build affordable housing. 140 The Low-\nIncome Housing Tax Credit (“LIHTC”) provides tax credits to developers to \nsubsidize the acquisition, construction, and rehabilitation of affordable rental \nhousing for low- and moderate-income tenants, so long as the developer agrees to \nincome-targeted rents on a percentage of the apartments for 30 years. 141 “This is \none of the most urgent problems with Affordable Housing: It expires[.]” writes \nTracy Jeanne Rosenthal of the New Republic. 142 Indeed, affordability \nrequirements have begun to expire on units created at the program’s inception in \n1987—creating housing insecurity for hundreds of thousands of families across the \nUnited States who cannot afford to pay market-rate rents.  \nDespite understanding the loopholes built into the affordable housing model \nfrom as early as 1988, national housing policy in 2021 remains reliant on the same \nprivate-public structure.  \nNearly 9,000 units in Los Angeles bound by affordable housing covenants \nhouse up to 20,000 Angelenos in L.A. County and will expire within the next eight \nyears. 143 Los Angeles City Councilmember Gil Cedillo noted that number of soon-\nto-expire covenants “wipes out whatever gains we make” in housing efforts.144 \nIndeed, landlords across Los Angeles who hold property in areas with high or \nrising rents are not incentivized to maintain stabilized rents, meaning that upon \nexpiration of the housing covenants, landlords will evict the tenants the program \nwas meant to house.  \n \n \n138 Id. \n139 Id. \n140 Id. \n141 Id. \n142 Id. \n143 Id. \n144 Anna Scott, Thousands of Angelenos Will Have Fewer Affordable Housing Options As ‘Covenants’ Will Expire, \nKCRW (Apr. 12, 2021), https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/greater-la/affordable-housing-manhattan-beach-\nrestitution-oc/rent-covenants-expiring-la.  \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 24 of 110   Page ID\n#:7260\n \nAccessible Housing \n \nHousing created under the affordable housing model is scarcely affordable \nfor the average low-income renter. Thresholds of “affordable” rent are determined \nby a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) calculation of \nArea Median Income (“AMI”)—meaning that rents are determined by the wealth \nof an entire county, rather than neighborhoods where housing is located. 145 In Los \nAngeles, a person making up to $63,100 a year, 80% of the AMI, will qualify as \n“low income.”146 Landlords in affordable housing complexes are thus more \namenable to renting to tenants who fall within the higher tiers of “low income” \neligibility so that the rents sustain the mortgage payments and loans, leaving those \nearning far less with little opportunity to obtain affordable housing.  \nDespite the fact that one quarter of the nation’s tenant households—nearly \n11 million tenants—qualify as “extremely low income,” the overwhelming \nmajority of affordable housing programs target higher income thresholds.147 This \nbias entrenches structural racism within affordable housing because it excludes \n“extremely low income” tenants, who are disproportionately people of color.148 \nThe affordable housing model therefore perpetuates patterns of gentrification by \npricing affordable housing in poorer neighborhoods at the higher threshold of \neligibility standards, incentivizing an influx of higher-earning individuals and \npushing out community residents who cannot meet the higher bracket affordable \nrent. Just as Angelenos of color were pushed out of their communities in the \ntwentieth century due to redlining, exclusionary zoning, and eminent domain, the \nsame structural eviction occurs today as the County and City prioritize affordable \nhousing with 30-year covenants that target higher earning individuals over \nsustainable public housing initiatives for the most vulnerable in “extremely low \nincome” brackets.  \nA Los Angeles resident who lives in an affordable housing unit set to expire \nsoon called attention to a newly constructed Affordable Housing building in her \ncommunity: “Affordable for who?

But \naccess to Section 8 vouchers is scarce—the vouchers only serve one quarter of \nqualifying individuals. In fact, waitlists for Section 8 or the few remaining public \nhousing units span more than ten years. 152  Tamara Meek, interviewed by the Los \nAngeles Times in 2017, first applied for a Section 8 housing voucher in 2004 when \nLos Angeles housing officials opened the waiting list to obtain the federal \nsubsidy.153 In the 13 years she waited for a housing voucher, she made temporary \narrangements, such as sleeping on blankets in the back of a friend’s kitchen. 154 \nDuring that time, Meek did not receive any subsidy, only a place on the waiting list \nalongside 300,000 applicants. 155 Federal input has not kept pace with rising \npoverty levels, and as a result, Section 8 vouchers mostly became available when \nsomeone relinquished theirs, most often because of their death. 156 In 2017, Los \nAngeles reopened the Section 8 housing list for the first time in 13 years—with an \nexpected 600,000 individuals to apply. 157 Securing a place on the waiting list is not \njust based on income, but luck.

Indeed, twenty five percent of all renter-households in \nthe U.S., accounting for 10.8 million households, fall under the “extremely low \nincome” threshold. 168 7.6 million of those households devote more than half of \ntheir incomes on rent and utilities. 169 By incentivizing developers to invest in \naffordable housing directed to individuals with higher incomes, there is a severe \nshortage of housing for the lowest-income renters. 170 People of color are \ndisproportionately affected by the shortage. The American Community Survey \n(“ACS”) reported that nationally, 20% of Black households, 18% of American \nIndian or Alaska Native households, 14% of Latino households, and 10% of Asian \nhouseholds are extremely low-income renters. 171  By comparison, six percent of \nwhite non-Latino households are extremely low-income renters. 172  \nThe economic and public health crisis caused by COVID-19 has made a \ndesperate situation worse for low-income renters. In 2019, 54% of Black renters \ncontributed more than half of their income to housing and utilities. That number \nhas grown as COVID-19 economic and employment recovery remains slowest for \ncommunities of color, in particular women of color.173 According to the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics unemployment data, the unemployment rate for Black women \naged 20 and over is one-fourth higher than the national average of all Americans in \nthat same age group, and for Latinas, the rate is nearly 50% higher than the \nnational average. 174 Yet the housing policies of Los Angeles County and City \nexacerbate these structural inequalities by investing in affordable housing designed \nfor a limited period of 30 years and targeting the higher tiers of eligible residents—\nleaving those in the lowest tier of eligibility with scarce options.175       \nIn some instances, housing discrimination in Los Angeles County is directed \nexplicitly at Black people.

A state-mandated plan called the “Housing Element,” due by \nOctober, is one way that Los Angeles leaders can achieve immediate and \nsustainable change.178 In 1969, the California legislature mandated that all cities \nand counties assess the state of housing availability and adopt a housing plan every \n7–8 years to meet the housing needs of every economic sector of the \ncommunity.179 The plan, known as the “housing-element law,” serves as a \nblueprint for how the city or county will develop land use and housing.180 \nAccording to the California Department of Housing and Community Development, \n“California’s housing-element law acknowledges that, in order for the private \nmarket to adequately address the housing needs and demand of Californians, local \ngovernments must adopt plans and regulatory systems that provide opportunities \nfor (and do not unduly constrain), housing development.”181 The goals of the \nhousing element are to ensure each jurisdiction is adjusting its policies to meet the \nrising housing needs of the community—in particular, by ensuring housing \nconstruction, reducing homelessness, and protecting tenants from displacement. \n \n176 Letter from Thomas E.

Each locality must include “[a]n analysis of available federal, state, and \nlocal data and knowledge to identify integration and segregation patterns and \ntrends, racially or ethnically concentrated areas of poverty, disparities in access to \nopportunity, and disproportionate housing needs within the jurisdiction, including \ndisplacement risk.”183 The analysis must contemplate plans to foster and maintain \ncompliance with civil rights and fair housing laws and envision ways to replace \nsegregated residential patterns with integrated and balance patterns.184 Once issues \nare identified, an assessment of contributing factors is required, alongside the \njurisdiction’s housing priorities and goals.185 Cities and counties must identify \nmetrics and milestones to determine what fair housing results will be achieved.186 \nJurisdictions can implement plans by incentivizing new affordable housing and \ncommunity revitalization, as well as initiatives to preserve existing affordable \nhousing and protecting existing residents from displacement.187 \nCities and counties must also create an inventory of land “suitable and \navailable for residential development” throughout the community, including \n“vacant sites and sites having realistic and demonstrated potential for \nredevelopment during the planning period to meet the locality’s housing need for a \ndesignated income level.”188 Sites range from permanent housing units to interim \nshelters, such as rental units, factory-built housing, affordable accessory dwelling \nunits (ADUs), mobile homes, and emergency shelters.189 In particular, the law \nrequires an analysis of governmental and nongovernmental constraints on \nmaintenance, improvement, or development of housing, and the local efforts to \nremove such constraints.190 Currently, 75% of the city’s residential property is \n \n182 CAL.

First, the City \nplanned to create “a City where housing production and preservation result in an \nadequate supply of ownership and rental housing that is safe, healthy and \naffordable to people of all income levels, races, ages, and suitable for their various \nneeds.”193 Second, the City aimed to provide “a City in which housing helps to \ncreate safe, livable and sustainable neighborhoods.”194 Third, the City set out to \nbuild “a City where there are housing opportunities for all without discrimination” \nand fourth, “a City committed to ending and preventing homelessness.”195 But in \nspite of these goals, Black Angelenos face barriers to homeownership and renting \naffordable housing units; disease runs rampant in garbage-ridden streets; and \nhomelessness rates and homelessness deaths are at an all-time high. In short, \nnonfulfillment of the Housing Element goals has exacerbated the housing shortage \ncrisis.  \nIn February 2021, the Los Angeles Times Editorial Board (“Times Editorial \nBoard”) said that Los Angeles leaders are “clinging to development patterns born \nout of racist housing policies from the last century that perpetuate segregation and \ninequality today.”196 The Times Editorial Board noted that the longstanding \nresistance against density and development has impeded leaders’ ability to create \nsufficient housing to meet the needs of its citizens.197 Indeed, cities across \nCalifornia, such as Sacramento and Berkeley, are revising zoning laws in response \nto the housing crisis to permit apartments on land previously zoned only for single \nfamily residences.198  Los Angeles City Council President Nury Martinez has \n \n191 Times Editorial Board, Editorial: L.A.

But if new affordable housing is only concentrated in low-income \ncommunities where current zoning permits more dense structures, the City and \nCounty will not meet their responsibility to affirmatively promote fair housing. \nThe Times Editorial Board challenged city officials to act to deconstruct structural \nracism in housing policy: “For the first time, Housing Element plans have to \nanalyze housing inequality and try to reduce segregation and lack of opportunities \nin Black, Latino and lower-income communities.

They could adopt tenant protections and discourage \nredevelopment of rent-stabilized apartments. They could incentivize \ndevelopers to include more affordable units in their new buildings.

PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON HOMELESSNESS \n \nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom has recognized the housing crisis that \nhas left hundreds of thousands of Californians on the streets. In his State of the \nState address to the California Legislature on February 19, 2020, Governor \nNewsom acknowledged that homelessness was a problem that had been growing \nfor decades and was neglected or consciously set aside by past administrations. His \nwords were a call to emergency action and an effort to provide the necessary \nresources to stop the loss of life and correct the inhumane conditions existing in the \ndeprivation of humanity in homeless communities in California, thereby ensuring \nan acceptable quality of life for all. In Governor Newsom’s words: \n \nLet’s call it what it is, a disgrace, that the richest state in the richest nation—\nsucceeding across so many sectors—is failing to properly house, heal, and \nhumanely treat so many of its own people. Every day, the California Dream \nis dimmed by the wrenching reality of families, children and seniors living \nunfed on a concrete bed. Military veterans who wore the uniform of our \ncountry in a foreign land, abandoned here at home. LGBTQ youth fleeing \nabuse and rejection from their families and communities. Faces of despair. \nFailed by our country’s leaders and our nation’s institutions. As \nCalifornians, we pride ourselves on our unwavering sense of compassion \nand justice for humankind—but there’s nothing compassionate about \nallowing fellow Californians to live on the streets, huddled in cars or \nmakeshift encampments. And there’s nothing just about sidewalks and street \ncorners that aren’t safe and clean for everybody. The problem has persisted \nfor decades—caused by massive failures in our mental health system and \ndisinvestment in our social safety net—exacerbated by widening income \ninequality and California’s housing shortage. The hard truth is we ignored \nthe problem. We turned away when it wasn’t our sister, our brother, our \nneighbor, our friend. And when it was a loved one, help wasn’t there. Most \nof us experienced homelessness as a pang of guilt, not a call to action. . . . It \nbecame normalized. Concentrated in skid rows and tent cities in big urban \ncenters. Now it’s no longer isolated. In fact, some of the most troubling \nincreases have occurred in rural areas, in small towns, and remote parts of \nour state. No place is immune. No person untouched. And too often no one \n32 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 34 of 110   Page ID\n#:7270\n \nwants to take responsibility. I’ve even heard local officials proclaim in \npublic: it’s not my problem. Servants of the public too busy pointing fingers \nto step up and help? That’s shameful. The State of California can no longer \ntreat homelessness and housing insecurity as someone else’s problem, buried \nbelow other priorities which are easier to win or better suited for \nsoundbites.206 \n \n  Governor Newsom has turned his words into actions. In January 2019, the \nState of California sued the city of Huntington Beach for failing to comply with \nstate housing laws in place to ensure the availability of affordable housing.207 Later \nthat year, $650 million in state funds were released directly to cities to address \nhomelessness across the state.208 Included in the state’s 2020–21 budget was a 28-\npage overview of the Governor’s homelessness plan.209 At the beginning of the \npandemic, in March 2020, an additional $150 million was directed to cities to \nprotect Californians experiencing homelessness from COVID-19210 and exempted \nthe construction industry from his statewide stay-at-home order in recognition of \nthe urgent need for housing projects to continue.211 As an interim emergency \nresponse to the homelessness crisis, Governor Newsom also ordered the \ndeployment of travel trailers to provide temporary housing for families \nexperiencing homelessness.212   \n \n206 Gov.

In 2020, LAHSA reported a 12.7% increase in the rate of \npeople experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles County and a 16.1% increase in \nthe homelessness rate in the City of Los Angeles compared to 2019.221 The \nCOVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated L.A.’s homelessness crisis. A recent \nreport by the Economic Roundtable projects that the homelessness rate among \nworking age adults in L.A. will increase by 86% by 2023 due to pandemic-related \njob losses.222  \nThroughout his nearly eight years as Mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti \nhas publicly acknowledged the crisis created by the rising rates of homelessness in \nhis city.  \nIn his 2017 State of the City address, Mayor Garcetti said: \n \nIn the last year, we campaigned for historic investments … and we won. \nNow, armed with the people of Los Angeles behind us, and new resources to \npropel us, it’s time to deliver historic change. . . . I remember a time when \nhomelessness was mostly concentrated in Skid Row. Today, there are people \nwithout shelter in just about every neighborhood. I am outraged when there \nare Angelenos who can’t escape the cold rain. Horrified when someone who \nhas worn our country’s uniform is begging for change on the corner. I \nrecently talked with a friend who told me her children have grown up seeing \nthe tents in our communities — they think it’s just a normal part of Los \nAngeles. . . . We can’t accept that. We won’t. . . . But the problem persists. \nThat’s why we wrote Measure HHH. That’s why we fought hard to pass \nMeasure H … so we could generate $355 million dollars a year to expand \nmental health, substance abuse, and employment services across the \nCounty—getting people off the streets, on track, and into homes of their \nvery own.

This is tough work. And \nlike you, I’m frustrated with any encampment on any sidewalk in our city. \nToo many of us still see tents in our neighborhoods … or a man sleeping on \nour corner who still hasn’t gotten the help he needs.

So, yes: Some days I’m frustrated. But I’m passionate about this. \nThere’s no issue I work on more deeply than homelessness … and I can tell \nyou this: we will get there. We will get there. . . .

Los Angeles City and County have never taken the most powerful step: \ndeclaring this an emergency.227  \n \nC. EMERGENCY POWERS FOR AN EMERGENCY SITUATION \n \nLos Angeles City Charter Sec. 231 and Los Angeles Administrative Code \nSec. 8.22 \n \nempower the Mayor of the City of Los Angeles to proclaim the existence or \nthreatened existence of a local emergency when an occurrence which by \nreason of its magnitude is or is likely to become beyond the control of the \nnormal services, personnel, equipment, and facilities of the regularly \nconstituted branches and departments of the City government.228  \n \nTo this day, Mayor Garcetti has not employed the emergency powers given \nto him by the City Charter despite overwhelming evidence that the magnitude of \nthe homelessness crisis is “beyond the control of the normal services” of the City \ngovernment. An emergency declaration under the City Charter would give the \nMayor the power to “promulgate, issue and enforce rules, regulations, orders and \ndirectives which the [Mayor] considers necessary for the protection of life and \nproperty.”229 These rules would be effective immediately upon their issuance, \nallowing Mayor Garcetti to bypass the bureaucracy and eliminate the inefficiencies \n \n226 Eric Garcetti, Mayor of L.A., State of the City (Apr. 19, 2020), https://www.lamayor.org/SOTC2020. \n227 A “FEMA-level response” is not an emergency declaration.

California State Government Code \n8698–8698.2 gives counties and cities broad powers to declare a shelter crisis and \nprovide emergency shelter and housing to the homeless during the duration of the \nstate of emergency.231 In 2015, Mayor Garcetti and Los Angeles City Council \nmembers introduced a motion to declare a state of emergency on homelessness “as \nit relates to a shelter crisis,” but the motion was never acted upon.232 The motion \ncalled L.A.’s homelessness crisis “unprecedented and growing” and said that the \nCity was “facing a state of emergency,” requiring “immediate action” and \n“immediate relief”—“extraordinary steps must be taken to make it build and locate \na broad range of housing options; including temporary housing options, emergency \nshelters, and safe and legal parking areas for individuals who may live in their \nvehicles.” 233 It further declared that “the City of Los Angeles should take full \nadvantage of its emergency authority to provide and incentivize shelter to those \nwhose lives and health are at risk by living on the streets.” 234  \nCommenting on the lack of movement eight weeks after the 2015 motion \nwas first introduced, the Los Angeles Times Editorial Board wrote, “this whole \nprocess has been more of a turgid civics debate than an urgent response to a \ndesperate situation.”235 Despite the City’s acknowledgment that it had “willing \npartners at every level” and that the emergency “require[d] strong and immediate \naction by the city of Los Angeles,” 236 the Times continued, “the supposed state of \nemergency proclaimed almost two months ago is looking increasingly look like a \n \n230 Other locales— including Portland, Oregon; Seattle and King County, Washington; and Hawaii—have declared \nstates of emergency related to rising homelessness. Commenting on the decision to declare a state of emergency in \nhis county, King County, Washington Executive Dow Constantine said, “[t]he persistent and growing phenomenon \nof homelessness—here and nationwide—is a human-made crisis, just as devastating to thousands as a flood or fire.” \nJ.B.

Six years after the words \nwere written, the Times Editorial Board’s proclamation that the shelter crisis \ndeclaration was a “farce and a waste of time” continue to ring true. It is clear that \nMayor Garcetti can draw on his power to declare a local emergency under the Los \nAngeles City Charter in order to make progress towards solving the homelessness \ncrisis.  \nIn a September 2019 editorial in the Los Angeles Daily News, Los Angeles \nCity Councilmember Joe Buscaino called on the California governor to declare a \nstate of emergency on homelessness, writing: “In our response to the homelessness \ncrisis, the city, the county, and the state are obeying every speed limit and stopping \nat every red light…. We need to give our dedicated civil servants the ability to \nrespond to this emergency Code 3, just like cops and firefighters, and bypass the \nnormal rules that add precious days, weeks, and months to contracting and \nconstruction timelines.” 239 While the City has tried to shift responsibility onto the \nstate for declaring an emergency, the real power remains with the Mayor and the \nCity Council.  \nThe global community has recognized the shameful plight of the richest state \nin one of the richest countries in the world while it languishes in indecision.

Recent \ninvestigations into City-funded housing projects for the homeless demonstrate that \na lack of government oversight has allowed the proliferation of corruption. In at \nleast two separate instances with two different developers, reports indicate that \ndevelopers of taxpayer-funded affordable housing projects have purchased \nproperties before turning around and reselling those properties to themselves at \nhigher prices in order to artificially inflate their project budgets and, in turn, the \namount of public money that they receive. In the case of a partly renovated motel \nin L.A.’s Westlake neighborhood, developers were able to increase the project’s \nbudget by $8 million through this process of reselling.255 According to reporting by \nKCRW, “most of the more than $30 million pumped into the renovation of this \nrundown motel has gone to its former owners, who, right before the sale, were sued \nby public interest attorneys for illegally evicting tenants.”256 In another case near \nKoreatown, a similar reselling process was used by a different developer to \nartificially inflate the budget by $6 million.257  \n These cases, of which there are almost certainly more to be discovered, \nindicate that the city has turned a blind eye to corruption as money is being \nsiphoned off from funds that taxpayers voted to allocate to the homeless \npopulation.  \nThe improper relationship between City Hall and real estate developers is \nneither isolated nor new. The FBI has been investigating possible corruption in \nCity Hall since 2017, a probe that has led to the prosecution of real estate \nconsultants, political fundraisers, and even, most notably, former Councilmember \nJose Huizar, whose council district included Skid Row.258 In June 2020, Huizar \nwas arrested by federal agents for using his position to cover up illegal activities \n \n255 Anna Scott, How a City-Funded Homeless Housing Project Became a Sink Hole for Public Money, KCRW (Dec. \n10, 2020), https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/greater-la/hhh-motel-george-gascon/30-million-motel-homeless-\nshelter-prop-hhh-taxpayer-oversight-la.  \n256 Id.  \n257 Id. \n258 David Zahniser, Emily Alpert Reyes, & Joel Rubin, L.A.

If in fact we expect to make a difference over the next five years, it \nwill require that which is conspicuously absent in this environment—and that is \nleadership . . . collective leadership.”261 Recognizing the purely symbolic nature of \nthe collaboration between City Hall and the Board of Supervisors, Councilmember \nRidley-Thomas continued, “we are overdue in terms of getting our act together.”262 \nCouncilmember Ridley-Thomas’ words echo an article on homelessness in the Los \nAngeles Times more than 30 years ago.

My \ncalculations, next year it might be every two weeks or less.”266 Over a year later, \njust seven projects containing 489 total units, had been completed.267 By then, the \nCity was four years into a ten-year project, but progress lagged far behind \nprojections. \n“Where has this money gone?” asked Anna Scott of National Public Radio \nmember station KCRW.268 The initial public campaign for Proposition HHH \nplanned for 10,000 housing units to be completed in 10 years, promising \nsignificant relief to the City’s unhoused population. However, progress continues \nto lag behind promises. At the current rate, it will take nearly 30 years to build \nenough housing for over 66,000 people currently experiencing homelessness—an \nestimate that doesn’t even account for the fact that the homelessness rate is \ngrowing exponentially every year.269 Moreover, while the average cost of a custom \nhome in L.A. starts at $350,000, more than 28% of Proposition HHH units in \nconstruction exceed $600,000 per unit.270  \nRon Miller, Executive Secretary of the Los Angeles/Orange Counties \nBuilding and Construction Trades Council, was a major proponent of Proposition \nHHH, but recently questioned in a letter to Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer \nwhy action has not been taken to quell the “abuses that seem to be occurring under \nHHH.”271 Miller referenced reports “alleging everything from fake not-for-profits \n \n264 Doug Smith, It Took Three Years of Blown Deadlines, But L.A.

In an article for the Los Angeles Daily News on \nMarch 14, 2021, Galperin wrote: \n \nWhat’s the problem with HHH? The projects are too expensive and too slow \nto make a meaningful difference for people living on our streets. As of this \nmonth, 489 bond-funded units are ready for occupancy and most others \nwon’t be finished until 2023, 2024 or later. While Los Angeles someday will \nsee thousands of new units, it will be nowhere near enough to keep pace \nwith the crisis in our neighborhoods.274 \n \nExamining the causes of the excessive delays and skyrocketing costs that \nhave plagued HHH projects to date, Galperin went on: \n \nSpools of red tape and excessive development costs contributed to this mess. \nAs Los Angeles Controller, the HHH ballot language mandates my office to \naudit the program’s finances yearly, and the City Charter allows us to \nexamine its performance. We found in 2019 and 2020 that the high cost of \nbuilding permanent supportive housing had slowed HHH to a crawl. Having \nto cobble together money from multiple funding sources and a serpentine \npermitting process made it so that developers couldn’t get their projects \napproved quickly.

If the City worked harder to bring costs down, it \ncould use more money to fund additional housing units and extend HHH’s \nreach.275 \n \nFurther, even though Governor Newsom specifically exempted construction \nwork from his statewide stay-at-home orders, Mayor Garcetti ordered “all \nbenchmarks and deadlines pertaining to current HHH projects [to be] indefinitely \nsuspended” as of April 2020.276 Without these deadlines, Los Angeles residents \nhave no way to hold the City accountable for its promises to create sustainable \nsolutions to homelessness. And this complete lack of accountability has \nconsequences—in the four years since Proposition HHH was passed, 5,814 \nhomeless people have died on the streets of Los Angeles.277 Homeless deaths have \nincreased to at least five deaths per day, and while the homeless have perished on \nour streets, only 489 housing units have been produced in the four years of HHH \nfunding.  \nProposition HHH provided funds to be used in three types of housing: 1) \nsupportive housing for homeless individuals where health and other services would \nbe provided, 2) temporary shelters and facilities, and 3) affordable housing.278 \nNevertheless, the City “unilaterally decided to spend the vast majority of the \nfunding on supportive housing,” allocating only five percent of the total \nProposition HHH budget to interim shelter and facilities projects.279 The deadly \ndecision to prioritize long-term housing at the expense of committing funds to \ninterim shelters has caused few to be housed while tens of thousands of people are \nleft in the street. This allocation of resources has significantly benefited a relative \nfew and sentenced the vast majority of our homeless population to living under \ncircumstances that are clearly unacceptable in a civilized society. This decision \nalso caused the quality of life for all residents of the City and County to deteriorate \nat an alarming rate. \nCity Controller Galperin recently called for a “pandemic pivot” in his recent \nLos Angeles Daily News Article: \n \n275 Id. \n276 Dkt. 265 at 23. \n277 Id. \n278 Dkt. 239 at 21. \n279 Id. \n46 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 48 of 110   Page ID\n#:7284\n \n \nMoney set aside for questionable or excessively expensive projects should \nbe reallocated to less costly and time-consuming plans. Until recently, there \nhad been little openness to such ideas at City Hall, but two of L.A.’s newest \nCouncilmembers have embraced my office’s recommendations. They want \nthe City to scrutinize troubled projects to see if a greater share of HHH funds \ncan be used to build housing faster and cheaper. Building more interim \nhousing to address immediate needs, and expanding the use of cheaper, \nfaster permanent housing solutions to achieve long-term goals — like motel \nconversions and prefabricated and modular units — can and should be done \nthrough HHH. It’s time for the City to do a pandemic pivot. The residents of \nLos Angeles, unhoused and housed, deserve a more flexible approach to \nhomeless housing — one that gets people off the streets today and creates an \neven greater number of supportive units in the days to come.280 \n \nIn a further effort to exacerbate this crisis, the City also announced in March \n2021 that it would ramp down Project Roomkey, Governor Newsom’s program to \nconverted unused hotel rooms into temporary shelters for unhoused people during \nthe COVID-19 pandemic.281 Just a month earlier, in February 2021, the Los \nAngeles Business Council, representing 500 L.A. businesses and civic leaders, had \nurged the City to expand Project Roomkey to include 15,000 hotel rooms.282 \n“Opportunities like this don’t come along often.

Beyond the conditions on our streets, the clearest sign of the \nfailure of this approach is the L.A. County Jail, which has the dubious distinction \nof doubling as the nation’s largest mental health institution.”341 \nOn January 22, 2019, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors adopted \na motion to address the shortage of mental health hospital beds in the County. In \nthe motion, the Board cited research by mental health experts that concluded that \nthe “minimum number of beds required to appropriately meet the need is 50 public \nmental health beds per 100,000 individuals. In Los Angeles County, there are only \n22.7 beds per 100,000 individuals; and California has only 17.05 beds per 100,000 \nindividuals.”342 The motion directed the Department of Mental Health to conduct \nassessments and draft a plan to increase the number of mental health beds, with a \nreport due back to the Board in 120 days.  \nOn October 29, 2019, the Department of Mental Health returned a report \nhighlighting the persistent shortcomings of the County’s mental health services. \nThe 138-page report details the multitude of ways in which the County has failed \nto meet the mental health needs of its constituents.

From 2016 \nto 2018, an outbreak of hepatitis A that cost the city more than $12 million, \nsickened nearly 600 San Diego residents and killed at least 20.376 As part of its \nefforts to contain the outbreak, the city and county governments put up temporary \nshelters for the homeless.377 Advocates such as Bob McElroy, who headed one of \nthe organizations operating the new shelters, directly linked the outbreak with \nhomelessness, saying “[t]he reality is, if you’ve got a place for people to be safe \nand have access to health care, you’re just not going to have the kinds of sanitation \nissues you have with tent cities lining the streets.”378 Los Angeles City and County \nmust take immediate action to avoid a similar outbreak in our streets.  \nDr. Susan Partovi, a medical director for the non-profit Homeless Health \nCare Los Angeles, stated that the risk of disease is not because of the homeless \nindividuals themselves, but because of the conditions they are forced to live in.379 \nShe pointed to a 2018 outbreak of typhus, which enters the bloodstream through \nfleas, ticks, or lice, as one key example of conditions fostering deadly \ndisease.380  The risks are exacerbated by the short supply of bathrooms and \ndrinking water.381  \n \n374 Id.  \n375 Chris Woodyard, As Homeless Are Suffering, Risk of Hepatitis, Typhus and Other Diseases Is Growing, USA \nTODAY (Jun. 18, 2019), https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/06/18/homeless-homelessness-disease-\noutbreaks-hepatitis-public-health/1437242001/. \n376 San Diego Hepatis A Outbreak Ends After 2 Years, ASSOCIATED PRESS (Oct. 30, 2018), \nhttps://apnews.com/article/cc40b8c476ef469ebdc2228772176b03.  \n377 Id. \n378 Id. \n379 Skid Row Doctor Says Health Risk Fear Over Homeless Isn't What it Seems, NBC L.A.

In October of 2018, the Los Angeles County Department of \nPublic Health declared an outbreak of typhus, citing Skid Row as a high-risk area \nfor the disease. 382 Shortly after, a Los Angeles Police Department employee \nassigned to Skid Row became infected by Typhoid fever, and two other employees \nshowed symptoms.383 Elizabeth Greenwood, a Los Angeles deputy city attorney, \nthen contracted typhus from a flea bite in her City Hall East office.384 At a City \nCouncil meeting in February 2019, Councilmember Joe Buscaino said, “[r]ats are \nemblematic of how we lost control over the homeless trash and encampment issue. \nIf we can’t protect the greatest symbol of our own democracy—our own City Hall, \nif we can’t protect our own staff from a medieval disease, then we should pack up \nand go home.”385  \nThe severity of the health hazards facing homeless communities underscores \nthe need for prompt action by the County and City. “[W]e have 23,000 people who \nare living on our sidewalks and outside every day,” stated Shayla Myers, attorney \nfor the Legal Aid Foundation, “that constitutes a true and devastating public health \nemergency.”386 \n \nv.  Patient Dumping \n \nOver the past two decades, Los Angeles hospitals have paid substantial civil \npenalties for “patient dumping” mentally disabled homeless individuals in Skid \nRow.387 Videos of mentally ill patients in hospital gowns dropped at Skid Row \nincited outrage. 388 For instance, in 2009, College Hospital paid $1.6 million to \nsettle a case in which 150 psychiatric hospital patients were released to Skid Row \n \n382 LA Public Health (@lapublichealth), TWITTER (Oct. 4, 2018, 10:01 AM), \nhttps://twitter.com/lapublichealth/status/1047894399730872321. \n383 Chris Woodyard, As Homeless Are Suffering, Risk of Hepatitis, Typhus and Other Diseases Is Growing, USA \nTODAY (Jun. 18, 2019), https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/06/18/homeless-homelessness-disease-\noutbreaks-hepatitis-public-health/1437242001/. \n384 Samuel Braslow, How the Homeless Ended Up Being Blamed for Typhus, L.A.

In \n2019, California Governor Jerry Brown signed SB 1152.392 The legislation requires \nhospitals to make sleeping arrangements for homeless patients with the goal of \nproviding a handoff between the hospital and a homeless shelter.393  Despite their \nclear recognition that patients were being dumped by the curbside, Los Angeles  \nhistorically turned a blind eye to the plight of the city's most vulnerable until the \nState passed SB 1152.  \n \nF. GENDER \n \nWhile many of the health and safety impacts of the homelessness crisis in \nLos Angeles cut across various identities, impacting all Angelenos, it is important \nto highlight the unique impact that homelessness has on women. The current \nservice provision model is failing to meet the specific needs of women, particularly \nunaccompanied women (meaning women who are not unhoused as part of a family \nunit), who comprise a fast-growing subgroup of the City’s homeless population. \nAccording to LAHSA’s 2020 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count, 65% of \nwomen experiencing homelessness are unaccompanied, and 80% of all \nunaccompanied women are unsheltered. While federal, state, and local agencies \nhave diligently worked to address the needs of other subgroups—including \nveterans, families, and youth—unaccompanied women are rarely identified as a \n \n389 Jon Regardie, The Ugly History of Downtown Patient ’Dumping’, DT News (July 9, 2018), \nhttp://www.ladowntownnews.com/news/the-ugly-history-of-downtown-patient-dumping/article_05fa6cea-8165-\n11e8-96aa-dbaced2025ed.html. \n390 Justin Klockzo, Hospitals Are Dumping Mentally Ill Patients in Los Angeles’ Skid Row, VICE (June 21, 2016), \nhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/yvezpv/hospitals-are-dumping-mentally-ill-patients-in-los-angeles-skid-row. \n391 Id. \n392 Matt Tinoco, LA County Hospitals Were Told To Stop 'Dumping' Homeless Patients, But Their Options Are \nLimited, LAIST (Sept. 6, 2019), https://laist.com/2019/09/06/los-angeles-homeless-hospital-dumping-law-1152.php. \n393 Id. \n62 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 64 of 110   Page ID\n#:7300\n \nsubpopulation, resulting in a dearth of research on their needs and experiences. \nBecky Dennison, Executive Director of Venice Community Housing, has said, \n“there’s not been any approach [by officials] that identifies, let alone prioritizes, \ngender,” and Anne Miskey, CEO of the Downtown Women’s Center, has said that \nmost shelters are designed for men.  \n \ni.  Rising Rates of Homelessness Among Women \n \nAccording to LAHSA’s Great Los Angeles Homeless Count, the number of \nwomen experiencing homelessness in the City increased 25% between 2019 and \n2020. Further, the number of unhoused women has more than doubled since 2013, \noutpacing the increase among men in the same time period. These numbers are \nlikely to be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has hit women-\ndominated industries like retail and hospitality particularly hard. According to the \nBureau of Labor Statistics, the pandemic had caused 865,000 women to drop out of \nthe labor force as of September 2020—a rate four times higher than the \ncorresponding rate for men. With these increases, it is clear that the growing trend \nin the number of women living in the streets is unlikely to reverse any time soon, \nunderscoring the pressing need for women-oriented solutions now. In 2020, the \npercentage of women aged 62 and up living in Skid Row increased by 20%.394  \nAmong homeless women, women of color are significantly overrepresented, \ndemonstrating the intersection of gender and structural racism. While Black \nwomen make up only nine percent of the total female population in LA, they are \nmore than 30% of all unhoused women. As the Downtown Women’s Action \nCoalition reported in its 2020 Women’s Needs Assessment, “structural racism [is] \nthe main driver” of Black women’s overrepresentation in Skid Row.395 Looking at \ndeath rates, Black women are similarly overrepresented, comprising 30% of all \nunhoused women who died on the streets of L.A. in 2019. Latinas make up 31% of \nthe homeless female population, and white women make up just 22% of the \n \n394 DOWNTOWN WOMEN’S ACTION COAL. 2020 WOMEN’S NEEDS ASSESSMENT: A MESSAGE OF LOVE BY THE \nWOMEN OF SKID ROW 4 (2020), https://cangress.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/08/1596804237326_WOMEN%E2%80%99S-NEEDS-ASSESSMENT-final-layout-.pdf \n[hereinafter DWAC NEEDS ASSESSMENT]. \n395 Id. \n \n63 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 65 of 110   Page ID\n#:7301\n \nhomeless female population.396 Other marginalized identities are likewise \noverrepresented in the homeless community—while LGBT people make up only \nabout five percent of the U.S. population overall, they make up 12% of Skid Row’s \nhomeless population.397 The DWAC 2020 Women’s Needs Assessment \nhighlighted that “[t]here are no services for trans women in Skid Row.”398 \n \nii.  Intersection of Gender-Based Violence and Homelessness \n \nDomestic violence (DV), intimate partner violence (IPV), and sexual assault \nare all significant drivers of homelessness, as well as frequent consequences of \nliving as an unhoused, unaccompanied woman on the streets of Los Angeles. \nAmong women over the age of 25 experiencing homeless, the USC Price Center \nfound that over half had experienced domestic or intimate partner violence, with \nrates higher among the unsheltered population compared to the sheltered \npopulation.399 The Downtown Women’s Center has also found that, in the past \ntwelve months, more than 36% of homeless women experienced DV/IPV, and 27% \nexperienced sexual assault.400  \nIn a focus group on domestic violence and housing conducted by the \nDowntown Women’s Center, one woman who currently resides in a domestic \nviolence shelter felt that if she “wasn’t beat up enough or [her] story wasn’t good \nenough,” she wouldn’t be let into the shelter.401 Other interviewees echoed that \nsentiment, saying “[i]f you don’t have the bruises or bloody face, they’re not going \nto believe you. If you don’t have those, you’re on your own.”402 Women living in \nshelters further detailed the stress of providers threatening to call the Department \nof Children and Family Services and have the women’s children taken away, as a \nmeans of forcing the women into compliance with shelter rules.403 While shelter \n \n396 USC PRICE CTR.

With demand for \nshelter outpacing supply, and with shelters being often inhospitable places for \nwomen even when they are available, it is no surprise that the number of \nunaccompanied women living in the streets continues to grow.  \nBut life on the street as a woman is uniquely dangerous. A 2016 survey by \nthe Downtown Women’s Action Coalition found that nearly half of women living \nin Skid Row had been attacked in the previous 12 months.404 A member of the \nCoalition reported “so many stories of the knife coming through the tent and \nripping it open” and “women at the bus stop circled by men like sharks.”405 Of the \nwomen living in Skid Row, more than 60% are over the age of 50, a particularly \nvulnerable group considering that unhoused women have a lifespan that is, on \naverage, nearly 35 years less than their housed counterparts.406 Further, homeless \nindividuals generally have a physiological age that is 10–20 years older than their \nactual age as a result of premature aging due to prolonged stress.407  \nThe stories of unhoused unaccompanied women highlight the dire need for \nincreased funding and tailored solutions to meet their needs. Discussing her life on \nthe street with the Los Angeles Times, one woman reported the changes she tried \nto make to her physical appearance after being subjected to multiple violent attacks \nthat left her with broken ribs and black eyes: “At the time, I had blonde hair down \nto the middle of my back. I cut my hair really short and started wearing clothes that \nlooked like guys’ clothes. I had to look like I’m a guy for my own safety.”408 \nAnother woman echoed the first: “I have to watch over me, and it’s hard. I have to \nwatch my back in everything.”409 In a February 1, 2021 letter to Mayor Eric \nGarcetti, the Downtown Women’s Action Coalition wrote: “Our community has \nbeen abandoned and left to die.”410 \n \n404 Gale Holland, Attacked, Abused and Often Forgotten: Women Now Make Up 1 in 3 Homeless People in L.A. \nCounty, L.A.

DISCUSSION \n \nThis Court cannot idly bear witness to preventable deaths. This ever-\nworsening public health and safety emergency demands immediate, life-saving \naction. The City and County of Los Angeles have shown themselves to be unable \nor unwilling to devise effective solutions to L.A.’s homelessness crisis. For the \nreasons discussed below, the Court must now do so.411  \nA district court may order injunctive relief on its own motion and is not \nrestricted to ordering the relief requested by a party. Armstrong v. Brown, 768 F.3d \n975, 980 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing Clement v. Cal. Dep’t of Corr., 364 F.3d 1148, \n1150 (9th Cir. 2004)). A preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary remedy,” \nrequiring courts to balance competing claims on a case-by-case basis, with \n“particular regard for the public consequences” of issuing an injunction. Winter v. \nNat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).  \nFor a court to issue a preliminary injunction, it must find that (1) there is a \nlikelihood of success on the merits; (2) absent preliminary relief, irreparable harm \nis likely; (3) the balance of equities tips in favor of preliminary relief; and (4) an \ninjunction is in the public interest. See Am. Trucking Ass’n, Inc. v. City of Los \nAngeles, 559 F.3d 1046, 1052 (9th Cir. 2009) (citing Winter, 555 U.S. at 20). \nAlternatively, an injunction can also be justified if there are “serious questions \ngoing to the merits” and the balance of hardships “tips sharply” in favor of \ninjunction relief, “assuming the other two elements of the Winter test are met.” See \nAll. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1132 (9th Cir. 2011). A \n“serious question” exists when there is “a fair chance of success on the merits.” See \nSierra On-Line, Inc. v. Phx. Software, Inc., 739 F.2d 1415, 1421 (9th Cir. 1984). \nThe Ninth Circuit follows a “sliding scale” approach to the four preliminary \ninjunction elements, such that “a stronger showing of one element may offset a \nweaker showing of another,” as long as “irreparable harm is likely.” See Doe v. \nKelly, 878 F.3d 710, 719 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Cottrell, 632 F.3d at 1131).  \n \n \n411 The Court notes that Defendants have filed numerous objections to factual assertions in Plaintiffs’ Motion. See \nDkt. 271. As the present order does not rely on any of the information to which Defendants object, the Court need \nnot rule on the objections. \n66 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 68 of 110   Page ID\n#:7304\n \nA. THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON THE MERITS SUPPORTS \nPRELIMINARY RELIEF \n  \nThe threshold inquiry is whether plaintiffs have established a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits. Garcia v. Google, Inc., 786 F.3d 733, 740 (9th Cir. 2015). \nWhere plaintiffs seek a mandatory injunction, the plaintiffs must “establish that the \nlaw and facts clearly favor [their] position, not simply that [they] are likely to \nsucceed.” Id. Relief is treated as a mandatory injunction when it “orders a \nresponsible party to ‘take action.’” Id. (quoting Marlyn Nutraceuticals, Inc. v. \nMucos Pharma GmbH & Co., 571 F.3d 873, 879 (9th Cir.2009)). \n \ni.  Constitutional grounds  \n \nBrown v. Board of Education \n \nThroughout history, the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of our \ngovernment have taken it upon themselves to remedy racial discrimination. These \naffirmative actions and equitable remedies arose from a recognition of the racism-\nentrenched in this country’s history and its enduring legacy through the present \nday.  \nIn the seminal case of Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, \n402 U.S. 1 (1971), the Supreme Court held that if the racially disparate impacts of \na previous Equal Protection Clause violation persisted, the violating party had a \nresponsibility of eradicating those impacts. Dealing with the desegregation of \nschools, the Court in Swann held that schools have not only the responsibility to \ndesegregate, but also the responsibility to integrate. Swann, 402 U.S. at 15. The \nSwann decision came after Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Shawnee Cty., \nKan., 347 U.S. 483 (1954) (“Brown I”), supplemented sub nom. Brown v. Board of \nEducation of Topeka, Kan., 349 U.S. 294 (1955) (“Brown II”), in which the \nSupreme Court addressed the impacts of the “separate but equal” laws. The Court \ndiscussed how “separate but equal” treatment culminated in “a feeling of \ninferiority as to [the Black students’] status in the community that may affect their \nhearts and minds in a way unlikely to ever be undone,” and found that racial \nsegregation in public schools is unconstitutional, even if segregated schools are \notherwise equal in quality. Brown, 347 U.S. at 494–95.  \n67 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 69 of 110   Page ID\n#:7305\n \nThe Brown Court ordered schools to desegregate “with all deliberate speed.” \nBrown II, 349 U.S. at 301. In many school districts, however, a racial imbalance in \nstudent populations continued to exist despite desegregation. Beginning with \nSwann, the Court’s line of post-Brown cases held that schools were responsible for \nremedying racial imbalance, even when such imbalance resulted from the selection \nof students based on geographic proximity to the school rather than racial \nsegregation. See Swann, 402 U.S. 1. The Court found that this was necessary to \nensure that schools would be properly integrated and that all students would \nreceive equal educational opportunities, regardless of their race. Id. \nSwann and its progeny further established that “the scope of a district court’s \nequitable powers to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are \ninherent in equitable remedies.” Swann, 402 U.S. at 15. Indeed, as early as \nBrown II, the Supreme Court ruled that district courts have the power to order \nstructural changes in school systems to integrate schools, such as “ordering the \nimmediate admission of plaintiffs to schools previously attended only by white \nchildren.” 349 U.S. at 300–01; see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 31 (affirming a district \ncourt’s injunction requiring school board to implement plan to desegregate school \ndistrict); MillikenBradley, 433 U.S. 267, 269 (1977) (upholding the equitable \npowers of a district court, as part of a desegregation decree, to “order \ncompensatory or remedial educational programs for schoolchildren who have been \nsubjected to past acts of de jure segregation”). The Court further found that “a \nState does not discharge its constitutional obligations until it eradicates policies \nand practices traceable to its prior de jure dual system that continue to foster \nsegregation. ” United States v. Fordice, 505 U.S. 717, 727–28 (1992). Similarly, \nthe Supreme Court has recognized the equitable power of federal courts to order \nstructural changes to remedy violations of unconstitutional due process. See, e.g., \nHutto, 437 U.S. at 683 (approving a district court’s orders to change various prison \npractices and policies to remedy constitutional violations). \nThe above cases arose out of a recognition of a history entrenched in racial \ndiscrimination, the persistent present-day impacts of such discrimination, and a \npressing need to remediate such impacts. In front of this Court today is a history \nsimilar to, and deeply intertwined with, the circumstances that gave rise to the \nabove cases. The Court today addresses decades of racial discrimination that have \n68 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 70 of 110   Page ID\n#:7306\n \nculminated in a Los Angeles homelessness crisis with a significant loss of life and \ndeprivation of humanity—peaking at 1,383 deaths just last year.412 \n “I want to be very clear that homelessness is a byproduct of racism,” stated \nLAHSA’s Heidi Marston.413 Racial discrimination and homelessness are \ninterconnected issues going back decades into the history of Los Angeles. \nBeginning with the City of Los Angeles’s decision to raze houses, resulting in an \nincreased number homeless low-income people of color in the 1910s, continuing \nthrough state enforcement of racially restrictive covenants throughout Los Angeles \nin the 1930s, and postwar policies related to redlining, racial covenants, and public \nbank lending—over a century of racist policies have disproportionately impacted \nL.A.’s unhoused Black population.414 “We continue to see that Black people are \noverrepresented in our homeless population, and that Black African Americans are \nfour times more likely to become homeless than their white counterparts.”415 \nThe City and County’s actions have been, and remain, critical drivers of \nracial discrimination. In 1976, the homeless population became spatially \nconcentrated in the fifty-square-block “containment zone” of Skid Row. The \ncontainment zone became a place where the homeless, discharged patients with \nmental disabilities, and parolees came—or in some instances, were bussed and \ndropped—to find services. General Dogon, a Skid Row community organizer, \ndescribes the containment as a “warehouse zone”: “a warehouse is where you store \nshit. So the idea was to push all of Los Angeles’s unfavorable citizens into one \narea.”416 “Main Street is the dividing line between the haves and have-nots,” says \nGeneral Dogon, where “you’ve got homeless people sleeping on one side of the \nstreet, and the loft buildings on the other side of the street.”417  \n \n412 Ethan Ward, They Were Homeless, Now They’re Dead, CROSSTOWN (Feb. 10, 2021), \nhttps://xtown.la/2021/02/10/homeless-deaths-los-\nangeles/#:~:text=1%20deaths%20were%20no%20outliers,Department%20of%20Medical%20Examiner%2DCorone\nr. \n413 Gina Pollack, Garcetti: LA Has Made Progress On Homelessness Issue, Despite Increasing Numbers, LAIST \n(June 12, 2020, 7:57), https://laist.com/latest/post/20200612/garcetti-gives-updates-on-coronavirus-and-protests-in-\nlosangeles.   \n414 LUSKIN REPORT, supra note 10, at 7–20. \n415 Id. \n416 The Containment Plan, 99% INVISIBLE (JAN. 10, 2017), https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-containment-\nplan/. \n417 The Containment Plan, 99% INVISIBLE (JAN. 10, 2017), https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-containment-\nplan/. \n \n69 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 71 of 110   Page ID\n#:7307\n \nPolice kept the homeless isolated, deepening and entrenching poverty within \nthe 50-block area. The Los Angeles Police Department set up physical buffers to \nreduce movement past the Skid Row border and enforce containment.418 Flood \nlights demarcated the border, disincentivizing the homeless from straying outside \nthe containment area.419  \nSeparately, in 2007, Los Angeles Police Department Chief William J. \nBratton enacted a “broken windows” policing policy.420 Under Chief Bratton’s \n“Safer Cities Initiative”, a task force of 50 officers entered Skid Row, issuing \ncitations and making arrests for infractions such as jaywalking, prostitution, and \nlittering. 421 The program ended shortly after a Los Angeles Police Department \nofficer fatally shot a homeless person of color on Skid Row in 2015. “On Skid \nRow, the windows already were broken,” Los Angeles City Attorney Feuer said, \n“we have a much deeper and more profound situation to deal with.”422 \nIn recent years, the City has attempted to address its homelessness crisis, but \nhas been woefully inadequate in doing so.

LAHSA \nreported, based on the 2017 Homeless Count, that the prevalence of Black people \namong the homeless population was highest in South Los Angeles and Metro Los \nAngeles, including Skid Row, where 68% and 49% of the homeless population \nidentified as Black, respectively.427  \nSuch disparities have long been recognized as severe constitutional \nviolations—violations so corrosive to human life and dignity as to justify the \nsweeping exercise of a federal district court’s equitable powers. Based on the \nCourt’s findings of these historical constitutional violations, a persisting legacy of \nracially disparate impacts—including a rising number of deaths, and the City and \nCounty’s knowing failure to adequately address the issue despite numerous \nopportunities and resources to do so, this Court is pressed to grant an affirmative \ninjunction ordering the City and County to actively remedy its homelessness crisis. \n \nState-Created Danger Doctrine \n \nWhile “the Fourteenth Amendment…generally does not confer any \naffirmative right to governmental aid,” DeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty. Dep't of Soc. \nServs., 489 U.S. 189, 202 (1989); Patel v. Kent Sch. Dist., 648 F.3d 965, 971 (9th \nCir. 2011), the Supreme Court in DeShaney created an exception that imposes a \nduty to act when the government has created the dangerous conditions. DeShaney, \n489 U.S. at 198–202. Interpreting the state-created danger exception, the Ninth \nCircuit has held that a state has a duty to act “when the state affirmatively places \n \n425 See supra notes 254–260. \n426 LAHSA REPORT, supra note 4, at 20. \n427 Id. at 15. \n71 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 73 of 110   Page ID\n#:7309\n \nthe plaintiff in danger by acting with ‘deliberate indifference’ to a ‘known or \nobvious danger.’” L.W. v. Grubbs, 92 F.3d 894, 900 (9th Cir.1996); Wood v. \nOstrander, 879 F.2d 583, 588 (9th Cir. 1989) (holding that deliberate indifference \nin the exercise of government power is within the Fourteenth Amendment’s \n“purpose of redressing abuses of power by state officials”). \nThe first requirement under the state-created danger exception is an \naffirmative act by the state that creates or perpetuates dangerous circumstances. \nHere, there are no shortage of affirmative steps that the City and County have \ntaken that have created or worsened the discriminatory homelessness regime that \nplagues Los Angeles today. Throughout most of the 20th century, the City and \nCounty of Los Angeles aggressively pursued an agenda of redlining and enforcing \nracially restrictive covenants that constrained the housing market for Black \nresidents. When it came to the Black homeless community, the City of Los \nAngeles created the Municipal Service Bureau for Homeless Men in Skid Row, \nwhich allowed its partner philanthropic organizations to distribute aid selectively \nalong racial lines. In a 2018 report, LAHSA concluded that “racial bias [continues \nto] affect every aspect of a Black person’s life, and it is impossible to untangle the \npervasive effects of institutional racism from other system failures that together \ncause a person to experience homelessness.”428 LAHSA itself has drawn a direct \nlink between the discriminatory policies the state pursued in the past and the \npresent disparate impact of that intentional discrimination against Black \nAngelenos. While this Court acknowledges that “disparate impact…is generally \ninsufficient by itself to form the basis of a constitutional violation,” this history of \nstructural racism, spanning over a century, demonstrates that L.A.’s homelessness \ncrisis, and in particular the impact of this crisis on the Black community, is a state-\ncreated disaster. Dkt. 269 at 34.  \nThe relevant inquiry here is whether “state action creates or exposes an \nindividual to a danger which he or she would not have otherwise faced.” Kennedy \nv. City of Ridgefield, 439 F.3d 1055, 1061 (9th Cir. 2006). In effect, this amounts \nto a “but for” test—we ask, but for a certain action by the state, would the plaintiff \nstill be exposed to the same danger? While Defendants contend that “there is no \ncausal connection” between the City and County’s actions and the position that the \nhomeless community finds itself in, the Court finds that there is little question that \n \n428 LAHSA Report, supra note 4, at 20 (emphasis added). \n72 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 74 of 110   Page ID\n#:7310\n \nbut for discriminatory policies, like redlining, that prevented Black residents from \npurchasing property and building intergenerational wealth, the Black community \nwould be in a significantly different position today. Dkt. 269 at 8. Even apart from \nracially discriminatory policies, state actions—such as creating the containment \nzone that deteriorated into Skid Row as we know it today—have led to the \nentrenchment of poverty and contributed to the present homelessness crisis. \nEven if this Court ignored the entire history of conscious decisions by the \ngovernment that led to the creation of Skid Row and the rampant depravity before \nus today, there is still incontrovertible evidence that the danger of living on the \nstreets—which led to 1,383 deaths last year alone—is state-made. The strongest \nevidence for a state-made danger is the deliberate, political choice to pursue the \ndevelopment of long-term supportive housing at the expense of interim shelters to \nget people off the streets in the near-term. As Plaintiffs pointed out in their brief, \nProposition HHH—the $1.2 billion ballot initiative to create 10,000 housing units \nfor the homeless—provided funding that could be used either for long-term \nsupportive housing or for temporary shelters. Dkt 239 at 21. Nevertheless, the City \nand County “unilaterally” decided to focus on housing at the expense of shelter, \neven knowing that massive development delays were likely while people died in \nthe streets. Over the four years since HHH’s passage, a mere 489 housing units \nhave been built, while over 5,000 people lost their lives in the streets due to a lack \nof shelter. The vast majority of those deaths were preventable. Defendants argue \nthat “Plaintiffs have not established that any City official affirmatively placed \nPlaintiffs in danger they would otherwise not have been in,” but pursuing housing \nat the expense of shelter, suspending HHH deadlines (and thereby evading \naccountability), and ramping down Project Roomkey despite the availability of \nfederal funds to support it were all political choices that created this crisis. Without \nthese choices, the death rate among L.A.’s homeless population would not be \ngrowing exponentially.  \nThe second requirement under the state-created danger exception is the \nexistence of a “known or obvious danger.” “Deliberate indifference cases are by \ntheir nature highly fact-specific.” Patel, 648 F.3d at 975. And the facts could not \nbe clearer here. In 2020, 1,383 homeless people died on the streets of Los Angeles, \nand an estimated five more die each day. Homeless women in particular have \nshared horrific stories of attacks and assaults that have forced them to alter their \nappearances and conceal their femininity in order to survive. The average lifespan \n73 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 75 of 110   Page ID\n#:7311\n \nof a homeless person in L.A. County is 51 years, compared to 73 years among the \ngeneral population.429  \nThere is no question that homelessness presents a grave danger to human \nlife, and there is no question that this danger is known to the decisionmakers with \nthe power to end this senseless loss of life. In a 2019 interview, Mayor Garcetti \nreferred to homelessness as “the humanitarian crisis of our lives,”430 a \ncharacterization echoed by Hilda Solis, chair of the County Board of Supervisors, \nin 2020.431 Heidi Marston, Executive Director of LAHSA, has called homelessness \n“an emergency on our streets . . . [requiring] an emergency response.”432 City \nCouncilmember Mike Bonin said at the Los Angeles Business Council’s February \n2021 Mayoral Housing, Transportation, and Jobs Summit that “there’s almost \nnobody in the city of Los Angeles, housed or unhoused, who would give what’s \nhappening in Los Angeles [anything] other than a failing grade,” and fellow \nCouncilmember Kevin de León called the situation “dysfunctional” and “highly \ndisjointed.”433 Neither the City nor the County of Los Angeles can deny their \nawareness of the unspeakable dangers homeless individuals face within their \njurisdiction, or the gross inadequacy of current efforts to address that reality. \nThe final requirement under the state-created danger doctrine is that the state \nact with deliberate indifference to the danger. Deliberate indifference is “a \nstringent standard of fault, requiring proof that a municipal actor disregarded a \nknown or obvious consequence of his action.” Bryan Cnty. v. Brown, 520 U.S. \n397, 410, (1997).

Momox-Caselis v. Donohue, 987 F.3d 835, 845 (9th Cir. \n2021).  \n \nThe first element, an objectively substantial risk of harm, is well-established and \ndiscussed above. The second and third elements, the state’s subjective awareness \nof facts demonstrating danger and an inference that those facts would likely cause \nthe danger, is likewise established above. The only question remaining is whether \nthe government has “disregarded” the consequences of the long-standing policies \nthat have perpetuated structural racism and the ways in which present corruption \nand a lack of coordination have led to an exponentially growing death rate. At the \nLos Angeles Business Council’s Mayoral Summit, City Councilmember Mark \nRidley-Thomas said “we have to be smarter, we have to work harder, and we have \nto run a lot faster. . .”434 The inadequacy of governmental action in response to the \nlife threatening conditions in the homeless communities is not new—in a 1985 Los \nAngeles Times article, the Times wrote: “It is time for leadership from both the \nmayor’s office and the county Board of Supervisors to pull all the players together \nin one room and lock the door until they have assigned tasks to start finding land \nand money for shelters, with deadlines for doing so. . . ,” underscoring the decades \nlong inaction by the City and County in the face of tens of thousands of deaths.435 \n  The Court therefore finds a strong likelihood that the City and County of Los \nAngeles are liable under the state-created danger doctrine, and that the law and \nfacts clearly favor such a finding. \n \nSpecial Relationship Exception \n \nA second theory creating an affirmative duty under DeShaney—the special \nrelationship exception—is also applicable. In addition to the exception for state-\ncreated danger discussed above, the Supreme Court in DeShaney created a second \nexception that imposed an affirmative duty to act when a state “takes a person into \n \n434 Los Angeles Business Council, LABC's 19th Annual Mayoral Housing, Transportation and Jobs Summit, \nYOUTUBE (Feb. 19, 2021), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsO8j0hz588. \n435 Help the Homeless, L.A.

The state’s \nconstitutional duty arises “from the limitation which [the State] has imposed on his \nfreedom.” The inquiry turns on whether Los Angeles’s lengthy history of \ndiscriminatory policies, aimed at containing homeless people in Skid Row, \nrestrains the personal liberty of L.A.’s homeless population to such an extent as to \ntrigger the state’s affirmative duty to act under the Fourteenth Amendment. The \nCourt finds this strongly likely to be the case. With the inception of the \ncontainment policy, enforced by the use of floodlights, physical barriers, and \npolicing, the City effectively created such “restraints of personal liberty” as to \nestablish a special relationship between the homeless population and the state, \nimposing an affirmative duty on the state to act to protect the rights of the \nhomeless. The City is therefore likely to be liable for failing to meet the affirmative \nduty created by its restraint of the local homeless population.  \nThe Court therefore finds a strong likelihood that Plaintiffs can succeed on a \nclaim under the state-created danger doctrine, and that the law and facts clearly \nfavor Plaintiffs’ claims. \n \nEqual Protection – Severe Inaction Theory \n \nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution proscribes state action that discriminates against a suspect \nclass.436 The Supreme Court has instructed lower courts to examine state action on \na case-by-case basis, “sifting facts and weighing circumstances [so that] the \nnonobvious involvement of the State…[can] be attributed its true significance.” \nBurton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715, 722 (1961). As a guiding \nprinciple in cases scrutinizing state action, it is important to remember that the \nstate action doctrine does not center around mere causation—instead, it is a way of \nrecognizing and assigning responsibility for discriminatory conduct. “A state is \nresponsible for the equal protection of its citizens, and allowing structural injustice \n \n436 U.S. Const. amend. XIV. \n \n76 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 78 of 110   Page ID\n#:7314\n \nto continue is action for which the state is responsible.”437 Finally, contrasting the \nEqual Protection Clause with the other two clauses in the Fourteenth Amendment, \nconstitutional law scholars have argued that “the Equal Protection Clause…is more \ndifficult to classify as imposing solely a negative prohibition upon the state \ngovernments.”438 \nThere are several provisions of the Constitution that create affirmative \nduties. For example, the Fourth Amendment creates an affirmative duty on the part \nof the government to obtain a warrant before a search or arrest, and the Fifth \nAmendment places an affirmative duty on police with regard to the privilege \nagainst self-incrimination.439 Indeed, Marbury v. Madison, one of the most seminal \ncases in American constitutional history, turns on how government inaction can \nviolate an underlying affirmative duty to act.440 In the context of the Fourteenth \nAmendment Equal Protection Clause, even a textualist reading supports the \nimposition of an affirmative duty to act. Where the Amendment reads, “nor shall \nany state…deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the \nlaws” the double negative implication of “not deny” can be literally interpreted to \nmean “to provide,” rendering state inaction constitutionally impermissible.441 \nFurther, there is also an intratextual argument wherein the phrasing of the Equal \nProtection Clause (“[N]or shall any state…deny to any person within its \njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”) is contrasted with the phrasing of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment Privileges and Immunities Clause (“No state shall \nmake or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of \ncitizens of the United States….”).442 Indeed, shortly after the adoption of the \nFourteenth Amendment, in 1870, Senator John Poole said in a congressional \nhearing, “[T]o say that [the state] shall not deny to any person the equal protection \nof the law it seems to me opens up a different branch of the subject. It shall not \ndeny by acts of omissions….”443 Constitutional law scholars have long opined that \n \n437 David M.

Board of Education mandated an “affirmative duty \n[on the state] to dismantle its prior dual education system.” United States v. \nFordice, 505 U.S. 717, 727–28 (1992) (emphasis added). The Court went on to say \nthat “a State does not discharge its constitutional obligations until it eradicates \npolicies and practices traceable to its prior de jure dual system that continue to \nfoster segregation.” Id. (emphasis added). In Brown, the analysis centered around \nthe value of attending integrated schools. Here, Black people, and Black women in \nparticular, are dying at exponentially higher rates than their white counterparts, and \nthese disparate death rates can be directly traced to a history of structural racism \nand discrimination. As outlined above, and as evidenced both by statements from \nCity Council members and the 1985 Los Angeles Times article detailing the lack \nof coordination between the County and the City, the Defendants have allowed \nthemselves to become paralyzed, failing to muster the moral courage and political \nwill to serve their homeless population. When state inaction has become so \negregious, and the state so nonfunctional, as to create a death rate for Black people \nso disproportionate to their racial composition in the general population, the Court \ncan only reach one conclusion—state inaction has become state action that is \nstrongly likely in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  \nThe Court acknowledges that this conclusion advances equal protection \njurisprudence, but it is wholly consistent with and flows naturally from analogous \nfederal statutes, rulemakings, and executive actions. In 2015, the Obama \nadministration promulgated a rule that required those city, state, and local entities \nwho received federal funds for housing initiatives to “affirmatively further” the \npurposes of the Fair Housing Act.445 The rule instructed these jurisdictions to \n“assess their concentrations…of disadvantaged populations and identify goals to \n \n444 See Howard, supra note 437. \n445 ROTHSTEIN, supra note 28, at 200. \n \n78 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 80 of 110   Page ID\n#:7316\n \nremedy segregated conditions.”446 If the state can be burdened by an affirmative \nduty to protect a statutorily created right, why should it not be burdened by an \naffirmative duty to protect a right provided for in the Constitution—the “supreme \nLaw of the Land”?447 The Supreme Court has commented that the Equal Protection \nClause is an “essential part of the concept of a government of laws and not men,” \nnoting that it “is at the heart of Lincoln's vision of ‘government of the people, by \nthe people, [and] for the people.’” Harper v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 383 \nU.S. 663, 667–68 (1966). Espousing the importance of the Fourteenth Amendment, \nthe Court said “the words of the amendment . . . contain a necessary implication of \na positive immunity, or right, . . . the right to exemption from unfriendly legislation \n. . .  exemption from legal discriminations, implying inferiority in civil society, \nlessening the security of their enjoyment of the rights which others enjoy, and \ndiscriminations which are steps towards reducing them to the condition of a subject \nrace.” In re Slaughter-House Cases, 1873, 16 Wall. 36, 67—72, 21 L.Ed. 394; see \nalso State of Virginia v. Rives, 1879, 100 U.S. 313, 318, 25 L.Ed. 667; Ex parte \nVirginia, 1879, 100 U.S. 339, 344—345, 25 L.Ed. 676. If the right to equal \nprotection is so essential to American society and constitutional thought, then the \nlaw simply cannot permit the state to idly stand by and watch as its Black residents \ndie at a disproportionate rate—especially when the state’s political history of \ndiscrimination has led directly to the present crisis. \n \nSubstantive Due Process  \n \nThe Court also finds that current City and County policies compound and \nperpetuate structural racism, threatening the integrity of Black families in Los \nAngeles and forcing a disproportionate number of Black families to go unhoused. \nSuch structures of discrimination likely offend the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment.  \nThe Fourteenth Amendment provides, in relevant part, that no state “shall . . \n. deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” U.S. \nConst. amend. XIV, § 1. The Due Process Clause guarantees not only procedural \nprotections, but also substantive rights, thereby “barring certain government \nactions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.” \n \n446 Id. \n447 U.S. Const. art.

Substantive due process \naccordingly “forbids the government from depriving a person of life, liberty, or \nproperty in such a way that ‘shocks the conscience’ or ‘interferes with rights \nimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty.’” Nunez v. City of Los Angeles, 147 F.3d \n867, 870 (9th Cir. 1988) (quoting United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 746 \n(1987)). The “shocks the conscience” standard is not subject to a rigid list of \nestablished elements. See County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 850 (1998 \n(“Rules of due process are not . . . subject to mechanical application in unfamiliar \nterritory.”) On the contrary, “an investigation into substantive due process involves \nan appraisal of the totality of the circumstances rather than a formalistic \nexamination of fixed elements.” Squadrito, 152 F.3d 564, 570 (7th Cir. 1998).  \nAs to whether substantive due process applies to the particular \ncircumstances alleged, the “threshold question is whether the behavior of the \ngovernmental officer is so egregious, so outrageous, that it may fairly be said to \nshock the contemporary conscience.” Lewis, 523 U.S. at 847 n. 8. The “touchstone \nof due process is protection of the individual against arbitrary action of \ngovernment,” Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 558 (1974), and the “exercise of \npower without any reasonable justification in the service of a legitimate \ngovernmental objective,” Lewis, 523, U.S. at 846. The due process guarantee bars \ngovernmental conduct that violates the “decencies of civilized conduct,” Rochin v. \nCalifornia, 342 U.S. 165, 173 (1952) interferes with rights “‘implicit in the \nconcept of ordered liberty[,]’” id. at 169, 72 S.Ct. 205 (quoting Palko v.

Accordingly, substantive due process protects \nagainst government power arbitrarily and oppressively exercised. Daniels, 474 \nU.S. at 331.  \nFinally, although the government is generally “not liable for its omissions,” \nMartinez v. City of Clovis, 943 F.3d 1260, 1270–71 (9th Cir. 2019), a government \nis required to act when it has “affirmatively place[d]” its citizens “in danger by \nacting with deliberate indifference to a known or obvious danger,” Patel v. Kent \nSch. Dist., 648 F.3d 965, 971–72 (9th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted).    \nHere, the question is whether the conduct attributed to the City and County \nviolates unhoused families’ substantive due process right to family integrity. It has \nlong been settled that the liberty interest identified in the Fifth Amendment \n80 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 82 of 110   Page ID\n#:7318\n \nprovides a right to family integrity or to familial association. See U.S. Const. \namend. V (stating no person shall “be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without \ndue process of law.”); Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U.S. 246, 255, (1978) (stating “the \nrelationship between parent and child is constitutionally protected.”). Indeed, \n“[t]he liberty interest at issue in this case—the interest of parents in the care, \ncustody, and control of their children—is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental \nliberty interests recognized by” the Court. Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65, \n(2000); see also Rosenbaum v. Washoe County, 663 F.3d 1071, 1079 (9th Cir. \n2011) (“The substantive due process right to family integrity or to familial \nassociation is well established.”).  \nIn Ms. L. v. U.S. Immigr. & Customs Enf’t, 302 F. Supp. 3d 1149 (S.D. \n2018), a California district court issued a class-wide injunction requiring the \ngovernment to reunite minor children with their parents. There, the court found \nthat the government had violated the parent-class-members’ right to family \nintegrity under the Due Process Clause by separating parents from their children at \nthe U.S.-Mexico border for no legitimate governmental objective.448 The district \ncourt cited to Quilloin, where the Supreme Court held that “[w]e have little doubt \nthat the Due Process Clause would be offended if a State were to attempt to force \nthe breakup of a natural family, over the objections of the parents and their \nchildren, without some showing of unfitness . . . .” 434 U.S. at 255, 98 S.Ct. 549. \nIn a similar case, Jacinto-Castanon de Nolasco v. U.S. Immigr. & Customs \nEn’t, 319 F. Supp. 3d 491, 500–01 (D.D.C. 2018), a district court granted a \npreliminary injunction against the government, preventing it from separating \nfamilies. There, the district court held that “substantial governmental burdens on \nfamily integrity are subject to strict scrutiny review, and they survive only if the \nburden is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.” Id.

United States, 707 F.2d 582, 602 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983). The district court further explained that the government must \nmake at least some showing of parental unfitness to establish a compelling \ngovernmental interest in violating the plaintiff’s right to family integrity. Jacinto-\nCastanon de Nolasco, 319 F. Supp. 3d at 501. \nThe facts in our case are comparable to the separations of parent and child in \nMs. L, 302 F. Supp. 3d 1149 (S.D. Cal. 2018), Quilloin, 434 U.S. 246 (1978), and \nJacinto-Castanon de Nolasco, 319 F. Supp. 3d 491 (D.D.C. 2018). In those cases, \ndistrict courts found that the government violated the parents’ substantive due \nprocess right when the government, as here, separated families for no legitimate \ngovernmental reason. The government can proffer no reason for its policies that \nhave led to the separation of children from their parents.  \nHere, the City and County’s discriminatory conduct has threatened the \nfamily integrity of the Black unhoused.449 A disproportionate number of Black \nunhoused families directly stems from decades of systemic racism intended to \nsegregate and disenfranchise the Black community. Indeed, as noted by the Los \nAngeles Homeless Services Authority, “Black people have been historically and \nsystematically precluded from housing opportunities, including through redlining, \nexclusionary zoning, and other forms of discrimination codified by federal, state, \nand local law.”450 Despite acknowledgements of structural racism, the City and \nCounty perpetuate the devastating negative impact of such policies by \ncompounding their effects. \nThe data squarely supports a finding that the city’s current policies continue \nto drive homelessness in Black communities. As previously indicated, despite \ncomprising only eight percent of the Los Angeles general population, Black \nAngelenos made up 42% of the homeless population.451 “Homelessness is a \nbyproduct of racism,” said Heidi Marston, Director of LAHSA, “we continue to \nsee that Black people are overrepresented in our homeless population, and that \nBlack African Americans are four times more likely to become homeless than their \n \n \n450 LAHSA REPORT, supra note 4, at 7. \n451 Id. at 9. \n \n82 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 84 of 110   Page ID\n#:7320\n \nwhite counterparts.”452 Applied to the family context, this reality presents even \ngraver consequences: the inability to safely protect one’s child. Data from \nLAHSA’s 2020 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count shows that 5,988 Black \npersons are experiencing homelessness as part of family units.453 This figure is \nmore than five times the 952 white persons experiencing homelessness as part of \nfamily units.454 \nAs mentioned above, City and County policies enacted against Black \ncommunities—in particular, redlining, eminent domain, and exclusionary zoning—\nremoved and deprived Black families from their land, creating surges of housing \ninsecurity over the past century.455 However, while the number of unhoused Black \nindividuals rises, the number of white unhoused individuals has decreased—\ndemonstrating that current policies are compounding the explicitly racialized \npolicies of the twentieth century.456 In fact, the city’s own data revealed this: \nbetween 2016 and 2017, the number of unhoused Black Angelenos increased by \n22%, while the number of unhoused white Angelenos decreased by seven percent \nin the same time frame. 457 Yet the city remains deliberately indifferent to the rising \nnumber of Black Angelenos in danger.  \nThe reality of the COVID-19 pandemic presents even graver consequences \nfor unhoused Black families: the inability to protect one’s child from infectious \ndisease. Councilwoman Nury Martinez and Councilmember Mark Ridley-Thomas \nreported that “[m]ore than 269,000 K-12 students [are] currently experiencing, or \non the brink of homelessness across California, enough to fill Dodger Stadium five \ntimes over.

Id. at 60. In fact, \nCOVID-19 mortality rates are higher for Black and Latino/a populations compared \nto mortality rates for white populations in California, escalating the need for \nequal—if not increased—access to services. See id. at 61.461  \nMost recently, the city’s indefinite suspension of “all benchmarks and \ndeadlines pertaining to current HHH projects” as of April 2020 further entrenched \nthe marginalization of communities of color by abandoning once again the City’s \nmost vulnerable at the peak of a global crisis. Only 489 of the 10,000 promised \nhousing units have been produced in the four years of HHH funding, leaving on the \nstreets 1,255 unhoused Black individuals who are part of family units.462 Such \npolicies have become a vehicle for the continued subordination of communities of \ncolor. As Black families face housing insecurity at disproportionate rates, the risk \nof family separation increases. \nIn many instances, homeless children are separated from their parents and \nplaced in foster care systems, where separation increases the mental trauma \nsuffered by parent and child. Traumatic family separation affects the development \nof both cerebral activity and other organ systems.463 This results in anxiety, post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, and has been shown to lead to higher rates of poverty and \nfood insecurity.464 Unhoused Black families are thus punished not only by a lack of \n \n459 Id. \n460 LAHSA REPORT, supra note 4, at 9. \n461 “African Americans and Latinx account for 66 percent of COVID cases among people experiencing \nhomelessness and 72 percent of the deaths as a result of COVID.” Dkt 241-1 at 11. \n462 See HC2020 Family Households, L.A.

Salerno, 481 U.S. \n739, 746 (1987). \nLos Angeles’s homelessness crisis has created a cyclical pattern in which \nBlack families are disproportionately uprooted from their community and \nseparated upon experiencing homelessness, driving Black children into the Los \nAngeles foster care system. The cycle must end. The Due Process Clause does not \npermit such governmental misconduct causing Black families to disproportionately \nface homelessness and family separation.  \nIt is clear to the Court that the Due Process Clause does not allow this kind \nof governmental misconduct. The Court is confident that this limited right to \nfamily integrity amongst unhoused Black families is “implicit in the concept of \nordered liberty.” See Nunez, 147 F.3d at 870. As the Supreme Court has held, \nrights arise not only from “ancient sources,” but also “from a better informed \n \n465 Id. \n466 Id. \n \n85 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 87 of 110   Page ID\n#:7323\n \nunderstanding of how constitutional imperatives define a liberty that remains \nurgent in our own era.” Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2602 (2015). The \nsevere disparity between treatment of Black unhoused families compared to white \nunhoused families—to say nothing of the public health risks illuminated by the \nongoing COVID-19 pandemic—present just such an urgent crisis and better inform \nthe constitutional understanding of ordered liberty. \nThis practice of disrupting unhoused Black families’ constitutional right to \nfamily integrity by compounding structural racism in present day policies is \nsufficient to find Plaintiffs have a likelihood of success on their due process claim. \nA practice of this sort implemented in this manner is likely to be “so egregious, so \noutrageous, that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience,” \nLewis, 523 U.S. at 847 n.8, interferes with rights “‘implicit in the concept of \nordered liberty[,]’” Rochin v. Cal., 342 U.S. 165, 169 (1952) (quoting Palko v. \nState of Conn., 302 U.S. 319, 325 (1937)), and is so “‘brutal’ and ‘offensive’ that it \n[does] not comport with traditional ideas of fair play and decency.” Breithaupt v. \nAbram, 352 U.S. 432, 435 (1957). \n \nii.  State law grounds \n \nThe California Welfare and Institutions Code provides as follows: \n \nEvery county and every city and county shall relieve and \nsupport all incompetent, poor, indigent persons, and those \nincapacitated by age, disease, or accident, lawfully resident \ntherein, when such persons are not supported and relieved by \ntheir relatives or friends, by their own means, or by state \nhospitals or other state or private institutions. \n \nCal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 17000 (West 2020). This provision is intended “to \nprovide for protection, care, and assistance to the people of the state in need \nthereof, and to promote the welfare and happiness of all of the people of the state \nby providing appropriate aid and services to all of its needy and distressed.” Id. \n§ 10000. Such aid and services shall be “provided promptly and humanely, with \ndue regard for the preservation of family life,” and on a non-discriminatory basis. \nId. Courts have interpreted § 17000 as imposing requirements to both provide \n86 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 88 of 110   Page ID\n#:7324\n \n“general assistance” and “subsistence medical care to the indigent.” Hunt v. Super. \nCt., 21 Cal 4th 984, 1011–13 (1999); Dkt. 265 at 26.  \n  The court in Scates v. Rydingsword interpreted § 17000 to mean that \nmunicipalities had discretion in determining which services to provide to homeless \nindividuals. Scates v. Rydingsword, 229 Cal. App. 3d 1085, 1099 (1991). \nDefendants similarly argue that, in this case, “the County has discretion to \ndetermine how to discharge its obligations.” Dkt. 270 at 22. The court in \nTailfeather v. Bd. of Supervisors, however, held that medical care must, at a \nminimum, be “at a level which does not lead to unnecessary suffering or endanger \nlife and health.” Tailfeather v. Bd. of Supervisors, 48 Cal. App. 4th 1223, 1240 \n(1996). Given the epidemic levels of homelessness in the City and County of Los \nAngeles, it is clear that the City and County have failed to meet this duty. As \nLAHSA Executive Director Heidi Marston has stated, “housing is healthcare.” \nDkt. 265 at 27. The empirical evidence bears out the truth of this soundbite; there \nis a clear link between living on the street and experiencing adverse health \noutcomes. L.A.’s homeless population is dying in record numbers. Rare diseases \nrun rampant in Skid Row, risking overflow into the rest of Los Angeles. Older \nindividuals, especially older women, who are more at risk and in need of health \nservices, are overrepresented on the streets of LA. The County has clearly failed to \nmeet its minimum obligations under § 17000 to provide life-preserving, medically \nnecessary services to the homeless. \n  Even outside of its inaction and inertia on the housing and shelter front, the \nCounty has also failed to meet its minimal duties to provide direct medical care \nthat is “reasonable and necessary to protect life, to prevent significant illness or \nsignificant disability, or to alleviate severe pain.” Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § \n14059.5(a). By the County’s own admission, the current 22.7 mental health beds \navailable per 100,000 individuals across the County comes nowhere close to the 50 \npublic mental health beds per 100,000 individuals that leading mental health \nexperts say is necessary to minimally meet the needs of the population. Dkt. 265 at \n9. The 138-page report that the Department of Mental Health returned in January \n2019 extensively documented the numerous gaps between community needs and \navailable services, specifically highlighting the severity of the access problem \nwhen it came to mental health and detoxification beds. In December 2020, a year \nafter the report was published, the Department of Mental Health produced a \nfollow-on analysis that showed that while a pilot program sought to procure 500 \n87 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 89 of 110   Page ID\n#:7325\n \nbeds across a two-year program, only 156 new beds were created in the first \nyear.468 The County, even as it recognizes the severity of the problems with its \ncurrent service provision model, appears to be unwilling or unable to fulfill both \nthe goals it sets for itself and the statutory minimums of § 17000. \nThe Court further finds the City of Los Angeles is likewise likely liable for \nviolations of § 17000. For the last thirty-five years, there have been calls for the \nCity and County of Los Angeles to work together to address the crisis of \nhomelessness.469 Twenty-five years ago, the California Supreme Court in Tobe \nfound that these provisions of the Welfare and Institutions Code do not apply to \ncities within counties. See Tobe v. City of Santa Ana, 9 Cal. 4th 1069, 1104 n.18 \n(1995). However, in the intervening decades, the institutional and financial \nlandscape in this area has changed drastically in ways that neither the California \nLegislature nor the California Supreme Court could have reasonably foreseen, and \nthe joint ventures long called for have taken robust form. As numerous programs \nand funding arrangements demonstrate, the formal jurisdictional divide between \ncities and counties under § 17000 has been substantially blurred, especially in the \ncontext of relieving homelessness. Consider the following examples: \nIn 2021, the City of Los Angeles contributed over $327 million to the Los \nAngeles Housing Services Authority (“LAHSA”).470 This past year, Governor \nNewsom and California’s legislature pioneered Project Roomkey, which made \n$150 million in emergency COVID-19 aid for the homeless available directly to \nlocal governments such as the City of Los Angeles.471 Project Roomkey allowed \nstate and local governments to receive up to 75% cost-share reimbursement from \n \n468 JONATHAN E.

Further, it is clear that the \nCity, on many occasions, has decided to use vast swaths of those funds to provide \nservices to the homeless. Simply put, under the aegis of local, state, and federal \ninitiatives, the City and County together have become jointly responsible for \nfulfilling the mandate of § 17000, at least as it pertains to confronting the crisis of \nhomelessness. Therefore, the Court finds that the most reasonable interpretation of \n§ 17000—the interpretation most in step with modern partnerships and funding \narrangements between the City and County—is that it applies not only to counties \nalone, but to cities and counties when they undertake a joint venture directed to the \ngoals of § 17000, such as a coordinated effort to alleviate homelessness in their \njurisdictions. Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the \nmerits of a claim under Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 17000 both against the City and \nthe County. \n \niii.  Americans With Disabilities Act \n \nPlaintiffs are also likely to succeed on the merits of a claim under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The ADA requires that individuals with \ndisabilities be afforded “the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, \n \n479 Putting New Resources to Work, ERIC GARCETTI, https://www.lamayor.org/HEAP (last visited Apr. 20, 2021). \n480 Tracy Jan, How Biden Stimulus Bill Will Target Homelessness, WASH. POST (Apr. 8, 2021), \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/04/08/homeless-hud-marcia-fudge/.  \n481 Id.  \n482 American Rescue Plan Act HOME Supplemental Allocations, \nhttps://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/CPD/documents/HOME-ARP.pdf.  \n90 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 92 of 110   Page ID\n#:7328\n \nfacilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public \naccommodation…” 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). Public entities are required to “maintain \nin operable working condition those features of facilities and equipment that are \nrequired to be readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities by the \nAct or this part.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.133(a) (2011). Put differently, the ADA imposes \nan affirmative burden on public entities, such as the City and County of Los \nAngeles, to “make ‘reasonable modifications’ to its ‘policies, practices, or \nprocedures’ when necessary to avoid such discrimination.” Fry v. Napoleon \nComm. Schs., 137 S. Ct. 743, 749 (2017) (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7) \n(2016)). \nBecause of the City and County’s persistent inaction and inertia in creating \nshelter for the homeless, thousands of homeless individuals have erected tents that \nobstruct city sidewalks. To satisfy the ADA, public sidewalks must have at least 36 \ninches of passable sidewalk, and the City and County are responsible for ensuring \nthat this requirement is met. 36 C.F.R. § 1191, app. D. § 403.5.1 (2014); Willits v. \nCity of Los Angeles, 925 F. Supp. 2d 1089, 1093 (C.D. Cal. 2013). Hundreds of \ncity sidewalks, not only in Skid Row but across the City and County of Los \nAngeles, fail to meet the minimum requirements of the ADA due to the creation of \nhomeless encampments. Again, it must be emphasized that these encampments—\nand the resulting ADA violations—are the outcome of decades of active policy \nchoices and deliberate indifference on the part of the City and County. The Court \nthus finds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on an ADA claim under this \ntheory.483 \n \n483 Plaintiffs also present a second theory of liability under the ADA, which is that the City has violated the \nADA by placing homeless individuals in “dangerous conditions where they are very likely to be harmed.” Dkt. 265 \nat 34. Plaintiffs argue that the containment policy “deliberately placed substance abusers in an area replete with the \nillegal trafficking of dangerous and addictive drugs.” Dkt. 265 at 35. To establish an ADA violation, a plaintiff must \nshow that “1) she is a qualified individual with a disability; 2) she was excluded from participation in or otherwise \ndiscriminated against with regard to a public entity’s services, programs, or activities, and 3) such exclusion or \ndiscrimination was by reason of her disability.” Lovell v. Chandler, 303 F.3d 1039, 1052 (9th Cir. 2002). Mental \nillness and addiction constitute disabilities within the bounds of the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12102; Crumbaker v. \nMcLean County, Ky., 37 F. App’x 784, 785 (6th Cir. 2002) (“A person addicted to illegal drugs is considered \ndisabled within the meaning of the ADA if the drug addiction ‘substantially limits one or more of the major life \nactivities’ of that person.’”). While the Court is sympathetic to Plaintiffs’ argument that the City has created \ndangerous conditions in Skid Row for those suffering from mental illness or addiction, these actions do not \nconstitute exclusion or discrimination with regard to public services as required to find an ADA violation. Thus, the \nCourt finds that Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on an ADA claim under this theory.  \n \n91 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 93 of 110   Page ID\n#:7329\n \nAccordingly, the Court finds a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits of the \nstate law grounds, and holds that the facts and law clearly warrant a preliminary \ninjunction. \n \nB. IRREPARABLE INJURY  \n \nTurning to the next factor, Plaintiffs must show they are “‘likely to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief.’” Hernandez v. Sessions, 872 \nF.3d 976, 994 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 20). “It is well \nestablished that the deprivation of constitutional rights unquestionably constitutes \nirreparable injury.” Id. (quoting Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. \n2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nNo harm could be more grave or irreparable than the loss of life. In 2020, \n1,383 homeless people died on the streets of Los Angeles, and an estimated five \nmore die each day. Furthermore, as explained above, Plaintiffs have demonstrated \nthe likelihood of a deprivation of their constitutional rights, and thus they have \nsatisfied this factor. \n \nC. BALANCE OF EQUITIES \n \nTurning to the third factor, “[t]o obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff \nmust also demonstrate that ‘the balance of equities tips in his favor.’” Hernandez, \n872 F.3d at 995 (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 20). As with irreparable injury, when \na plaintiff establishes “a likelihood that Defendants’ policy violates the U.S. \nConstitution, Plaintiffs have also established that both the public interest and the \nbalance of the equities favor a preliminary injunction.” Arizona Dream Act \nCoalition v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1069 (9th Cir. 2014).  \nAgain, as explained above, Plaintiffs have demonstrated the likelihood of a \ndeprivation of their constitutional rights, and thus they have satisfied this factor. \n \nD. PUBLIC INTEREST \n \nThe fourth and final factor for consideration is the public interest. See \nHernandez, 872 F.3d at 996 (quoting Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky, 586 F.3d 1109, \n1139 (9th Cir. 2009)) (“When, as here, ‘the impact of an injunction reaches beyond \n92 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 94 of 110   Page ID\n#:7330\n \nthe parties, carrying with it a potential for public consequences, the public interest \nwill be relevant to whether the district court grants the preliminary injunction.’”) \nTo obtain the requested relief, “Plaintiffs must demonstrate that the public interest \nfavors granting the injunction ‘in light of [its] likely consequences,’ i.e., \n‘consequences [that are not] too remote, insubstantial, or speculative and [are] \nsupported by evidence.’” Id. (quoting Stormans, 586 F.3d at 1139). “‘Generally, \npublic interest concerns are implicated when a constitutional right has been \nviolated, because all citizens have a stake in upholding the Constitution.’” Id. \n(quoting Preminger v. Principi, 422 F.3d 815, 826 (9th Cir. 2005)). \nAs discussed above, Plaintiffs have demonstrated the likelihood of a \nviolation of their constitutional rights, and thus have satisfied this factor.  \nFurthermore, the current state of the homelessness crisis in Los Angeles \nbegs intervention. The City argues that granting this preliminary injunction would \nnot be in the public’s interest because it would “usurp the discretionary policy \nmaking decisions of the City’s elected officials and impose mandatory duties.” \nDkt. 269 at 32. The Intervenors similarly state in their opposition that “Plaintiffs \nfail to put forth any argument, let alone evidence to meet its burden of showing \nthat such a dramatic encroachment into the provenance of the City and the County \nis warranted, let alone why such a broad injunction is in the public interest.” Dkt. \n275 at 12. The Court, however, seeks to ensure accountability, and promote action \nwhere there has been historic inaction, by issuing a practical flexibility in its \nremedy. The City’s inaction has had a deep, disparate, and deadly impact on the \ncitizens of Los Angeles. And no public interest is more paramount than protecting \nthe lives of our citizens.  \nNor does the Court find reason to withhold a preliminary injunction in light \nof Mayor Garcetti’s newly announced spending plan.484  For one thing, the \nplurality of this budget will be drawn from funds allocated under Proposition \nHHH, which are already designated for homelessness relief. And as the Los \nAngeles Times notes, the City’s efforts to combat homelessness have repeatedly \nfallen short of their stated goals.485 For example, despite receiving state and federal \nfunding for Project Roomkey, the City and County never managed to contract for \n \n484 See Benjamin Oreskes & David Zahniser, L.A. Plans Nearly $1 Billion in Spending to Address Homelessness \nUnder Garcetti Plan, L.A. TIMES (Apr. 19, 2021), https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2021-04-\n19/los-angeles-will-increase-budget-for-addressing-homelessness. \n485 Id. \n93 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 95 of 110   Page ID\n#:7331\n \neven a third of the promised 15,000 hotel and motel rooms. After reaching a peak \nof 4177 operational rooms in August 2020, the program has steadily withered: as \nof April 12, 2021, only 2079 rooms were operational, 1693 of which were \noccupied—just over ten percent of the capacity originally promised. In spite of \nabundant funding drawn from local, state, and federal budgets, the City and County \nfell far short of their stated goal. This embarrassing performance does not inspire \nconfidence, to say the least, in the City’s new budget. From mishandling Project \nRoomkey to sinking $1.2 billion into the ever-delinquent Proposition HHH, Los \nAngeles has documented a long history of plans or budgets that have fallen short, \nyear after year, as the homelessness crisis worsens.  \nThe Court, therefore, finds no reason to believe that the City’s new budget \nwill be in any way adequate to meet the crisis of homelessness or overcome \ndecades of intentional racism and deliberate indifference. For years—too many \nyears—the homelessness epidemic in Los Angeles has only continued to worsen \nunder the auspices of admirable intentions and impressive budgets. In the Court’s \nview, this latest budget is no different. \nFinally, as explained in our discussion of Brown and its progeny, \nconstitutional violations as grave as those in front of the Court today give rise to “a \ndistrict court’s equitable powers to remedy past wrongs.” See Swann, 402 U.S. at \n15. \n \nE. HEARING \n \nFinally, the Court acknowledges that it may appear unusual to issue a \npreliminary injunction without a hearing on the motion. In the Ninth Circuit, \nhowever, “there is no presumption that the issuance of a preliminary injunction \nrequires an evidentiary hearing”; instead, the decision to hold a hearing is left to \nthe sound discretion of the district court. Softketeers, Inc. v. Regal W. Corp., 788 F. \nApp’x 468, 469 (9th Cir. 2019) (citing Int’l Molders’ & Allied Workers’ Loc. \nUnion v. Nelson, 799 F.2d 547, 555 (9th Cir. 1986)); see also Nelson, 799 F.2d at \n555 (noting that the text of Rule 65(a) does not impose “a purely technical rule” \nrequiring an evidentiary hearing on a preliminary injunction). “[I]f the facts are \nsimple and little time would be taken, a court may be required to hold an \nevidentiary hearing on a motion for injunction.” State of Or., 913 F.2d 576, 582 \n(9th Cir. 1990) cert. denied sub nom. Makah Indian Tribe v. United States, 501 U.S. \n94 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 96 of 110   Page ID\n#:7332\n \n1250, (1991). However, the Ninth Circuit has emphasized the lack of presumption \nin favor of evidentiary hearings “especially if the facts are complicated.” Id.  \nThe Court finds that no hearing is necessary at this juncture. While \nDefendants contend that “the evidentiary record is insufficient to support the \ndrastic equitable relief [Plaintiffs] request,” for over a year now, the Court has \nrepeatedly held hearings in this case, allowing the parties, intervenors, and \ncommunity representatives to voice their concerns, present evidence, and argue. \nDkt. 269 at 13. In practical terms, the Court has already held 12 evidentiary \nhearings, and this preliminary injunction is rooted in the extensive factual record \ndeveloped through these hearings. After numerous hearings and careful review of \nthe motion and opposition, the Court finds it appropriate—in accordance with the \nemergency conditions of homelessness in Los Angeles—to grant preliminary \ninjunctive relief without an additional hearing. To do so is consistent with Ninth \nCircuit precedent, the text and spirit of Rule 65, and the urgent need for relief this \ncase presents. \n \nIII.  AVAILABILITY OF EQUITABLE REMEDIES \n \nA. FACTUAL BASIS FOR IMMEDIATE RELIEF \n \nLos Angeles is indisputably facing a homelessness crisis that merits \nimmediate, emergency action. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has called the \nhomelessness crisis “the humanitarian crisis of our lives”486 and has “called for a \nFEMA-level response to our homelessness crisis,” drawing a comparison to the \naftermath of the 1906 Great San Francisco Earthquake, which displaced more than \n200,000 Californians.487 He acknowledged the urgency of the situation, demanding \nthat we “must respond like it’s an earthquake – and do more, faster.”488 LAHSA \n \n486 LA Mayor Eric Garcetti Calls Homelessness The 'Humanitarian Crisis Of Our Lives', NPR (Sept. 21, 2019), \nhttps://www.npr.org/2019/09/21/763073646/l-a-mayor-eric-garcetti-calls-homelessness-the-humanitarian-crisis-of-\nour-lives. \n487 Eric Garcetti, Mayor of L.A., State of the City (Apr. 19, 2020), https://www.lamayor.org/SOTC2020; Rising to \nthe Challenge: Helping Homeless Angelenos, ERIC GARCETTI (June 11, 2019), https://www.lamayor.org/rising-\nchallenge-helping-homeless-angelenos.  \n488 Mayor Eric Garcetti (@MayorOfLA), FACEBOOK (June 12, 2019), \nhttps://www.facebook.com/MayorOfLA/posts/10157299485724806?comment_id=10157306801444806&reply_co\nmment_id=10157308404509806.  \n \n95 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 97 of 110   Page ID\n#:7333\n \nExecutive Director, Heidi Marston, has similarly recognized that “[w]e have an \nemergency on our streets and we need an emergency response.”489  \nAnd as mentioned above, L.A. government officials have acknowledged that \nracism has impacted homelessness. “I want to be very clear that homelessness is a \nbyproduct of racism,” stated LAHSA’s Heidi Marston.490 “We continue to see that \nBlack people are overrepresented in our homeless population, and that Black \nAfrican Americans are four times more likely to become homeless than their white \ncounterparts.”491 As of January 2020, LAHSA reported that 21,509 Black people \nwere without permanent housing in LA—a number that has likely increased as a \nresult of the pandemic given COVID-19’s significant impact on communities of \ncolor.492 \nDespite frequent acknowledgments of the emergency nature of homelessness \nin L.A.—an emergency borne unequally across racial lines—City and County \nefforts to address the problem have been wholly inadequate. Indeed, in the year \nsince this litigation began, there has been a 32% increase in the number of \nhomeless deaths compared to the previous year.493 713 homeless people died \nbetween March and July 2020 alone – more than double the number of units of \nhousing built under Proposition HHH in the 4 years since it was passed.494 Because \nthe City and County have repeatedly failed to do so, the Court now finds it \nnecessary, in the proper exercise of its equitable powers, to craft an immediate \nresponse to this unconscionable humanitarian crisis. \n  \nB.

III, § 2.  \nWhile Defendants argue that “Article III precludes the Court from dictating \nhow the City exercises its discretionary decision-making or spending to address \nissues arising out of homelessness,” Dkt. 269 at 10, after a court identifies a right \nand a corresponding violation, “the scope of a district court’s equitable powers to \nremedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable \nremedies.” Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U.S. 1, 15 (1971). “In \nfashioning and effectuating the decrees, the courts will be guided by equitable \nprinciples.” Brown v. Bd. of Educ. of Topeka, Kans., 349 U.S. 294, 300 \n(1955). “Traditionally, equity has been characterized by a practical flexibility in \nshaping its remedies and by a facility for adjusting and reconciling public and \nprivate needs.” Id. As such, district courts have broad discretion to create \ncomprehensive relief that addresses “each element contributing to the violation” at \nissue. Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 687 & n.9 (1978). The Court’s equitable \npowers allow it to tailor relief to different circumstances, regardless of any \nprocedural complexity. Lemon v. Kurtzman, 411 U.S. 192, 200 (1973) (“In shaping \nequity decrees, the trial court is vested with broad discretionary power; appellate \nreview is correspondingly narrow.”). \nA court may employ equitable powers as a means of enforcement to compel \ndefendants to take certain steps to ensure compliance with constitutional mandates. \nSee Brown II, 349 U.S. at 301 (instructing the district courts “to take such \nproceedings and enter such orders and decrees consistent with this opinion as are \nnecessary and proper to admit to public schools on a racially nondiscriminatory \nbasis with all deliberate speed the parties to these cases”); see also United States v. \nFordice, 505 U.S. 717, 727–28 (1992) (noting that Brown v. Board of Education \nand its progeny mandate an “affirmative duty to dismantle its prior dual education \nsystem,” and that “a State does not discharge its constitutional obligations until it \neradicates policies and practices traceable to its prior de jure dual system that \ncontinue to foster segregation”). A district court is not bound by a plaintiff’s prayer \nfor relief and has broad discretion to determine a flexible remedy that balances the \ncompeting interests at stake. See Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 538 (2011); \nLemon, 411 U.S. at 200–01 (plurality op.). \n97 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 99 of 110   Page ID\n#:7335\n \nThe equitable powers of federal courts encompass injunctions that affect the \nrights of parties not before the court. See Steele v. Bulova Watch Co., 344 U.S. \n280, 289 (1952) (noting that a district court, “in exercising its equity powers,” may \nenjoin conduct “outside its territorial jurisdiction”) (citations omitted). In Califano \nv. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979), the Supreme Court, addressing the validity \nof nationwide class relief, analyzed the principle of “complete relief,” stating that \nnationwide classes are not “inconsistent with principles of equity jurisprudence, \nsince the scope of injunctive relief is dictated by the extent of the violation \nestablished, not by the geographical extent of the plaintiff class.” 442 U.S. at 702. \n“Nationwide relief here is necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs for \nthe ‘violation established.’” District of Columbia v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric. 444 F. \nSupp. 3d 1, 49 (D.D.C. 2020) (citing Califano, 442 U.S. at 702); see also \nEasyriders Freedom F.I.G.H.T. v. Hannigan, 92 F.3d 1486, 1501–02 (9th Cir. \n1996) (“[A]n injunction is not necessarily made overbroad by extending benefit or \nprotection to persons other than prevailing parties in the lawsuit—even if it is not a \nclass action—if such breadth is necessary to give prevailing parties the relief to \nwhich they are entitled.”). \nAs discussed below, courts often use these broad equitable powers to \nremedy constitutional and statutory violations by local governments. Notably, the \nNinth Circuit has specifically upheld equitable relief in the context of equal \nprotection and due process violations, in addition to statutory violations of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act and California Welfare and Institutions § 17000. \n \ni.  Constitutional Violations Provide Grounds for Equitable Relief  \n \nCourts have imposed structural equitable relief in order to remedy \nconstitutional violations. See Sierra Club v. Trump, 963 F.3d 874, 888 (9th Cir. \n2020) (“Certain provisions of the Constitution give rise to equitable causes of \naction. Such causes of action are most plainly available with respect to provisions \nconferring individual rights, such as the Establishment Clause or the Free Exercise \nClause.”); see also Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk Cnty. Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 399 (1992) \n(Stevens, J. dissenting) (“When a district court determines, after a contested trial, \nthat a state institution is guilty of a serious and persistent violation of the Federal \nConstitution, it typically fashions a remedy that is more intrusive than a simple \norder directing the defendants to cease and desist from their illegal conduct. A \n98 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 100 of 110   Page ID\n#:7336\n \ndistrict court has a duty to command a remedy that is effective, and it enjoys the \nbroad equitable authority necessary to fulfill this obligation” (citations omitted).). \nCertainly, “the nature and scope of the remedy are to be determined by the \nviolation.” Gilmore v. California, 220 F.3d 987, 1005 (9th Cir. 2000). “But where \n[] a constitutional violation has been found, the remedy does not ‘exceed’ the \nviolation if the remedy is tailored to cure the ‘condition that offends the \nConstitution.’” Id. (citation omitted). \nThe Supreme Court has established the clear authority of courts to issue \nmandatory injunctions that remedy constitutional violations, including equal \nprotection violations, caused by state and local governmental agencies. In Brown, \nthe Supreme Court ruled that courts had the power to order structural changes in \nschool systems to desegregate schools, such as “ordering the immediate admission \nof plaintiffs to schools previously attended only by white children.” Brown II, 349 \nU.S. at 300–01; see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 31 (affirming a district court’s \ninjunction requiring school board to implement plan to desegregate school district); \nMilliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 269 (1977) (upholding the equitable powers of a \ndistrict court, as part of a desegregation decree, to “order compensatory or \nremedial educational programs for schoolchildren who have been subjected to past \nacts of de jure segregation.”). Similarly, the Supreme Court has recognized the \nequitable power of federal courts to order structural changes to remedy violations \nof unconstitutional due process. See, e.g., Hutto, 437 U.S. at 683 (approving a \ndistrict court’s orders to change various prison practices and policies to remedy \nconstitutional violations).  \nIn Roman v. Wolf, the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part the district court’s \nissuance of a preliminary injunction that imposed a moratorium on an immigration \nand customs enforcement (“ICE”) facility’s receipt of new detainees, requiring \nspecific sanitation measures, and ordering a reduction in the facility’s population in \nlight of the Covid-19 pandemic. 977 F.3d 935, 942 (9th Cir. 2020). The Ninth \nCircuit reasoned that “the district court had broad equitable authority to grant \nprovisional relief to remedy a likely constitutional violation.” Id. at 939. The \ncircuit court continued that “[c]ourts have long recognized the existence of an \nimplied cause of action through which plaintiffs may seek equitable relief to \nremedy a constitutional violation,” and “the district court’s power to grant \ninjunctive relief included the authority to order a reduction in population, if \nnecessary to remedy a constitutional violation.” Id. at 941–42. That is, district  \n99 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 101 of 110   Page ID\n#:7337\n \ncourts have the flexibility to order measures that they determine necessary to \n“bring the conditions to a constitutionally adequate level.” Id. at 945–46. Further, \nin “time-sensitive circumstances, the district court’s authority to issue relief \nencompassed the authority to grant provisional relief ‘to bring an ongoing violation \nto an immediate halt.’” Id. at 942 (citing Hutto, 437 U.S. at 687 n.9). The Ninth \nCircuit recognized that the district court made detailed factual findings to support \nthe preliminary injunction and noted in approval that the district court left \nparticular details to the government’s discretion, such as how to achieve the \nrequisite population reduction and which detainees to release, deport, or transfer. \nId. at 939. \n \nii.  Statutory Violations Provide Grounds for the Court to Issue \nEquitable Relief  \n \n  The power of district courts to compel government action also encompasses \nthe redress of statutory violations. See Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 870 (9th \nCir. 2001), abrogated on other grounds by Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499 \n(2005) (stating that “[s]ystem-wide [injunctive] relief is required if the injury is the \nresult of violations of a statute . . . that are attributable to policies or practices \npervading the whole system (even though injuring a relatively small number of \nplaintiffs), or if the unlawful policies or practices affect such a broad range of \nplaintiffs that an overhaul of the system is the only feasible manner in which to \naddress the class’s injury.”). \n  For example, in Rodde v. Bonta, 357 F.3d 988, 999 (9th Cir. 2004), patients \nasserted an ADA claim against defendants including Los Angeles County, and \nsought a preliminary injunction seeking to bar the County from closing a \nrehabilitation center without providing plaintiffs with necessary medical and \nrehabilitative services elsewhere. The district court granted an injunction that \nbarred the County from closing said rehabilitation center or reducing medical \nservices until the County could guarantee that plaintiffs would receive comparable \nservices from other healthcare providers in Los Angeles County. Id. at 993. In its \ndeliberation, the district court considered the County’s concerns of financial \nhardship, but was not persuaded of the County’s claim that closing the center \nwould save the County $58.6 million annually. Id. at 994. In affirming the district \ncourt, the Ninth Circuit held that “The district court did not abuse its discretion in \n100 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 102 of 110   Page ID\n#:7338\n \nconcluding that plaintiffs would suffer greater hardship absent preliminary relief \nthan the County would suffer because of the injunction.” Id. at 998–99. The Ninth \nCircuit noted that “the injunction does not mandate that the County keep [the \nrehabilitation center] open at any cost; rather, it requires the County to somehow, \nsomewhere, continue to offer the services currently provided . . .” Id. at 999.  The \ncircuit court emphasized that when “[f]aced with [] a conflict between financial \nconcerns and preventable human suffering, [the Ninth Circuit has] little difficulty \nconcluding that the balance of hardships tips decidedly in plaintiffs' favor.” Id. \n(citing Lopez v. Heckler, 713 F.2d 1432, 1437 (9th Cir. 1983)). \n  In addition to remedying violations of federal statutes, district courts may \nalso issue equitable relief to remedy to violations of state statutes. In Harris v. \nBoard of Supervisors, a group of patients also sued the County to prevent its \nreduction of medical care at a hospital and closure of the same rehabilitation center \nin Roddle. 366 F.3d 754, 757 (9th Cir. 2004). The patients there brought their \nclaims based on the California Welfare and Institutions Code §§ 10000, 17000 and \n17001. Id. at 764. The district court issued a preliminary injunction, and the Ninth \nCircuit affirmed. Id. “A lack of funds is no defense to a county’s obligation to \nprovide statutorily required benefits.” Id. (citing Cooke v. Superior Court, 213 Cal. \nApp. 3d 401, 413–14 (1989)).  \n \niii.  The Plata Case Guides This Court’s Exercise of its Broad \nEquitable Authority  \n \nThe Supreme Court’s decision in Brown v. Plata upheld district courts’ \nauthority to use their equitable powers when necessary to address constitutional \nviolations even where those powers shape local government’s authority and \nimpacts their budget. 563 U.S. 493 (2011).  \n \nThe Supreme Court in Brown v. Plata Recognized That Courts May Act Even If \nTheir Orders Have a Budgetary Impact on Local Government \n \nIn Plata, two consolidated class actions resulted in an order requiring \nCalifornia to drastically reduce its prison population. See id. In the first case, a \ndistrict court found that Eighth Amendment rights had been violated when \nprisoners with serious mental disorders alleged inadequate mental health care due \n101 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 103 of 110   Page ID\n#:7339\n \nto prison overcrowding. Id. at 506–07. In the second case, the State stipulated to a \nremedial injunction when prisoners with serious medical conditions brought \nsimilar claims. Id. at 507–08. When the State failed to comply with that injunction, \nthe district court appointed a receiver to oversee remedial efforts. Id. Upon request \nfrom both groups of plaintiffs, a three-judge panel convened under the Prisoner \nLitigation Reform Act (“PLRA”), and the cases were consolidated. The panel \nentered a remedial order mandating a reduction of the State’s prison population to \n137.5% of design capacity within two years, when the prisons held “nearly double” \ntheir capacity at the time of trail. Id. at 501. Governor Brown appealed.  \nThe Supreme Court affirmed the panel’s ruling, holding that the PLRA \nauthorizes “the relief afforded in this case and that the court-mandated population \nlimit is necessary to remedy the violation of prisoners' constitutional rights.” Id. at \n502. The Court emphasized that “the law and the Constitution demand recognition \nof certain [] rights. . . . If government fails to fulfill [its] obligation, the courts have \na responsibility to remedy the resulting [] violation.” Id. at 510-11. In response to \nthe State’s concerns that the district court’s order limited the State’s authority to \nrun its prisons, the Court noted that “[w]hile the order does in some respects shape \nor control the State’s authority in the realm of prison administration, it does so in a \nmanner that leaves much to the State’s discretion . . . The order’s limited scope is \nnecessary to remedy a constitutional violation.” Id. at 553. Accordingly, if a \ndistrict court finds an ongoing Constitutional violation, it is obligated to impose a \nremedy, while budgetary and capacity concerns can be adequately addressed by the \ncourt by giving the party sufficient discretion in how to remedy the violation. \n \nThe District Court Decisions Underlying the Plata Opinion Are Analogous to the \nCircumstances of This Case and Provide Support for Broad Judicial Relief \n  \nThe second case later consolidated in Brown v. Plata was originally filed in \nthe Northern District in 2001. Plata v. Schwarzenegger (“Schwarzenegger I”), No. \nC01-1351 TEH, 2005 WL 2932253 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 3, 2005). There, plaintiffs \nclaimed that the State of California was providing constitutionally inadequate \nmedical care at its state prisons. Id. at *1. Defendants agreed multiple times to take \ncertain steps to address issues, first in a consent decree and then a stipulated order. \nId. at *1–2. But, like the instant defendants, the State failed to take the necessary \n102 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 104 of 110   Page ID\n#:7340\n \naction, “enact[ing] only very limited and piece-meal measures, with no prospect \nfor system-wide reform or restructuring.” Id. at *26. \nFollowing an evidentiary hearing, the court found that the defendants had \n“fail[ed] to provide constitutionally adequate medical care” which “caused the \nplaintiffs extreme harm.” Id. at *3. The court then issued an order, establishing a \nReceivership to take control of the medical delivery system of the prison system \nfrom the defendants. Id. at *2. \nThe Schwarzenegger I court recognized that the case “present[ed] a textbook \nexample of how majoritarian political institutions sometimes fail to muster the will \nto protect a disenfranchised, stigmatized, and unpopular subgroup of the \npopulation.” Id. at 32. The court emphasized: \n \n“This failure of political will, combined with a massive escalation in the rate \nof incarceration over the past few decades, has led to a serious and chronic \nabnegation of State responsibility for the basic medical needs of prisoners. \nThis is a case where “the failure of the political bodies is so egregious and \nthe demands for protection of constitutional rights [is] so importunate that \nthere is no practical alternative to federal court intervention.”  \n \nId. (citation omitted). The Schwarzenegger I court reiterated the Ninth Circuit \nprinciple that, “where federal constitutional rights have been traduced, principles \nof restraint, including comity, separation of powers and pragmatic caution \ndissolve.” Id. at 24 (quoting Stone v. City and County of San Francisco, 968 F.2d \n850, 861 (9th Cir.1992). \n  The court expanded the equitable remedy from Schwarzenegger I in a \nsubsequent case, directing the State of California “to transfer $250 million to the \nReceiver in furtherance of the Receiver’s work to remedy the undisputed and \nongoing constitutional inadequacies in the delivery of medical care in California's \nprisons.” Plata v. Schwarzenegger (“Schwarzenegger II”), No. C01-1351 TEH, \n2008 WL 4847080, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 7, 2008). As discussed below, the \nSchwarzenegger II court found that the defendant’s arguments of budgetary \nconcerns could not “outweigh the human suffering and preventable and possibly \npreventable deaths that will occur” if the defendants were granted a stay. Id. at *5. \n \n103 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 105 of 110   Page ID\n#:7341\n \niv.  Courts’ Equitable Authority in the Face of Government \nBudgetary Concerns \n \nThere are financial considerations inherent to any equitable relief requiring \naction from a governmental entity; however, federal courts have an obligation to \nenforce the Constitution and the laws of its United States. In Watson v. City of \nMemphis, the Supreme Court observed that despite the city’s argument that \nordered desegregation may require unbudgeted funding, the “vindication of \nconceded constitutional rights cannot be made dependent upon any theory that it is \nless expensive to deny than to afford them.” 373 U.S. 526, 537 (1963). \nThe Ninth Circuit has also addressed the weight of budgetary concerns in the \ncontext of equitable relief. In Lopez, the Ninth Circuit affirmed a district court \norder requiring the restoration of disability benefits to a substantial number of \nsocial security recipients. Lopez, 713 F.2d at 1432. The circuit court concluded that \n“physical and emotional suffering shown by plaintiffs . . . is far more compelling \nthan the possibility of some administrative inconvenience or monetary loss to the \ngovernment. . .” Lopez, 713 F.2d at 1437; see also Rodde, 357 F.3d at 999 (when \n“[f]aced with[ ] a conflict between financial concerns and preventable human \nsuffering, we have little difficulty concluding that the balance of hardships tips \ndecidedly in plaintiffs’ favor”) (citing Lopez); Harris, 366 F.3d at 764–65 (“[a] \nlack of funds is no defense to a county’s obligation to provide statutorily required \nbenefits”) (citing Cooke, 213 Cal. App. 3d at 413–14).  \nThe court may also weigh certain circumstances against alleged financial \nconsequences. In Schwarzenegger II, the court found that government arguments \nregarding financial hardship due to the court’s injunction were “less compelling” \nwhen funding had already been allocated to the issue targeted by the court’s order. \nSchwarzenegger II, 2008 WL 4847080, at *5. In Rodde, the Ninth Circuit affirmed \na preliminary injunction barring a county from closing a hospital. Rodde, 357 F.3d \n988. The circuit court considered how much the alleged $58.6 million annual cost \nof relief was offset by the savings caused by the relief, which would avoid costs \ncaused by displaced patients seeking treatment elsewhere. Rodde 357 F.3d at 999 \n(9th Cir. 2004). The Ninth Circuit concluded that, “while it is unclear just how \nmuch financial hardship the district court's injunction creates for the County, it is \napparent that the cost is lower than the County contends.” Id. \n \n104 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 106 of 110   Page ID\n#:7342\n \nIV.  CONCLUSION: A WAY FORWARD \n \nThe devotion that Abraham Lincoln called for has not been met here. \nFor decades in Los Angeles, the desperation of its citizens has been met with \na yawn. Each day, newspaper headlines bring forth different cities and \ncommunities calling for action. Meanwhile, politicians measure success by how \nmuch money they have raised to combat homelessness. Service providers with \nclipboards endlessly approach homeless individuals with services and promises to \nreturn, yet are unable to provide sufficient shelter or housing. Bureaucrats create \nstatistics trumpeting their efficiency and success to the public. But none of this has \nled to accountability or solutions. As Councilmember Mark Ridley-Thomas \nremarked, “the issue of homelessness is of insufficient importance to the decision \nmakers of this region. Therefore, we have this languishing set of circumstances \nwhere we chase our tails day in and day out claiming that we’re doing things.”495  \nThere can be no defense to the indefensible. For all the declarations of \nsuccess that we are fed, citizens themselves see the heartbreaking misery of the \nhomeless and the degradation of their City and County. Los Angeles has lost its \nparks, beaches, schools, sidewalks, and highway systems due to the inaction of \nCity and County officials who have left our homeless citizens with no other place \nto turn. All of the rhetoric, promises, plans, and budgeting cannot obscure the \nshameful reality of this crisis—that year after year, there are more homeless \nAngelenos, and year after year, more homeless Angelenos die on the streets. \nLike Abraham Lincoln’s call to action in his Gettysburg address, it is for us \n“to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus \nfar nobly advanced.” Let us pick up that flag, and have the courage of those who \nfought so long ago, to act so that we can become a better nation and people. \n \nV.  PROVISIONS OF THE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \nIn an attempt to balance the interim nature of a preliminary injunction with \nthe emergency conditions created by the homelessness crisis, the Court hereby \nORDERS the following: \n \n \n495 Los Angeles Business Council, LABC's 19th Annual Mayoral Housing, Transportation and Jobs Summit, \nYOUTUBE (Feb. 19, 2021), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsO8j0hz588. \n105 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 107 of 110   Page ID\n#:7343\n \n1.  Accountability \n \na.  Pursuant to the Mayor’s announcement496 of a “justice budget”497 on \nMonday, April 19, 2021, the Court ORDERS that $1 billion, as \nrepresented by Mayor Garcetti, will be placed in escrow forthwith, \nwith funding streams accounted for and reported to the Court within 7 \ndays.  \nb.  Within 90 days, conduct an audit of all funds received from local, \nstate, and federal entities intended to aid the City and/or County of \nLos Angeles in solving or alleviating the problem of homelessness, \nincluding, but not limited to, Proposition HHH funds, MHSA funds, \nMeasure H funds, and emergency relief from the state and federal \ngovernment, including the American Rescue Plan and the Cares Act. \nc.  Within 90 days, conduct investigations and prepare a report on all \ndevelopers that are currently receiving funds from Proposition HHH; \npropose revised procedures for evaluating future applicants for \nProposition HHH funds that would limit the possibility of funds being \nmisused or wasted. \nd.  Within 30 days, the County shall conduct an audit of any funds \ncommitted to mental health (MH) and substance use disorder (SUD) \ntreatment. \n \nAll above audits and background investigations must be completed by \nindependent auditors and investigators, respectively. Parties are ORDERED to \nmeet with Special Monitor/Master Michele Martinez within 10 days to receive her \ninput regarding independent auditors and investigators. \n \n2.  Action \n \na.

Within 30 days, City Controller Ron Galperin shall oversee the \ncreation of a report on all land potentially available within each \ndistrict for housing and sheltering the homeless of each district. \nThe homeless have been left no other place to turn to but our \nbeaches, parks, libraries, and sidewalks, and it is pivotal that \nthey no longer rely on spaces that enhance quality of life for all \ncitizens.  \nii.  The Court ORDERS the cessation of sales, transfers by lease or \ncovenant, of the over 14,000 City properties pending the report \nby the Controller Ron Galperin to the Court, and all similarly \nsituated properties held by the County pending the report by the \nCounty counsel. \niii.  Within 30 days, the Los Angeles City Council Homelessness \nand Poverty Committee shall report back to the Court with \nspecific actions to address 1) structural barriers (including but \nnot limited to redlining, highway construction, eminent domain, \nand health exposure) that cause a disproportionate number of \npeople of color to experience homelessness or housing \ninsecurity; 2) solutions to the problem of extremely low income \nindividuals being foreclosed from the affordable housing \nmarket in favor of higher-income individuals; and 3) the \npossibility of rezoning to accommodate more R3 (multi-family) \nzoning. The Committee is ordered to invite local non-\ngovernmental stakeholders (such as the NAACP, the \nDowntown Women’s Action Coalition, and any additional \ngroups that the Committee deems would be beneficial in this \nprocess) to participate in the production of the report.  \niv.  Mayor Garcetti, the Los Angeles City Council, and Hilda Solis, \nChair of the County Board of Supervisors, shall submit a report \nto the Court by April 27, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. to explain why an \nemergency declaration has not been issued. \nv.

Within 30 days, with regard to MH and SUD beds, the County \nshall report to the Court on the progress towards establishing \nthe 1,508 new sub-acute beds to accommodate the needs of the \nnon-jail population and an additional 1,418 new sub-acute beds \nto accommodate those with substance abuse disorders being \ndiverted from jails. \n \nb.  Actions Specific to Skid Row \n \ni.  Within no more than 90 days (i.e., on or before July 19, 2021), \nthe City and County must offer and if accepted provide shelter \nor housing immediately to all unaccompanied women and \nchildren living in Skid Row; within 120 days (i.e., on or before \nAugust 18, 2021) to all families living in Skid Row; and within \n180 days (i.e., on or before October 18, 2021) to the general \npopulation living in Skid Row. Skid Row, originally defined as \nthe area between 3rd and 7th and Main to Alameda, will be \nextended to the surrounding area, defined as 2nd to 8th and \nSpring to Alameda. The City and County shall consult with the \nSkid Row Advisory Council to identify the number of \nunaccompanied women who are willing to move to shelters.  \nii.  The County shall, no later than within 90 days (i.e., on or \nbefore July 19, 2021), offer and if accepted provide to all \nindividuals within Skid Row who are in need of special \nplacement through the Department of Mental Health or \nDepartment of Public Health appropriate emergency, interim, or \npermanent housing and treatment services. The County shall \nwork with providers to build meaningful relationships with \nhomeless individuals to ensure that these individuals are fully \ninformed of their options for services, housing, and shelter. \nWithin ten days (i.e., on or before April 30, 2021), the County \nshall provide to the Court a list of providers who are already \n108 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 277   Filed 04/20/21   Page 110 of 110   Page ID\n#:7346\n \nestablished in the area and who will be working in tandem with \nthe County on these efforts.   \niii.  The County shall provide, or fund third parties to provide, \nsupport services to all homeless residents who accept the offer \nof housing. County and City shall evenly split the cost of \nproviding operational services. \niv.  The City and County shall prepare a plan that ensures the \nuplifting and enhancement of Skid Row without involuntarily \ndisplacing current residents to other parts of the City or County. \nMoving forward, the City and County are encouraged to \ndevelop a hyper-local approach with community-based \norganizations throughout each district, including the Skid Row \nAdvisory Council. \n \nc.  Other Actions \n \ni.  After adequate shelter is offered, the Court will let stand any \nconstitutional ordinance consistent with the holdings of Boise \nand Mitchell. \nii.  The Court shall appoint a Special Monitor/Master, Michele \nMartinez, at the City and County’s expense to assist with the \nimplementation of this order and to resolve disputes among the \nparties or other interested parties.

Edison Co. v. \n3 Lynch, 307 F.3d 794, 802 (9th Cir.2002).  Proposed Intervenors have a legally \n4 protectable interest in the settlement in Mitchell v. City of Los Angeles, which \n5 Plaintiffs explicitly and implicitly challenge in this lawsuit.  Plaintiffs allege in the \n6 seventh cause of action that the settlement in Mitchell was a project under CEQA, for \n7 which an environmental review was required.  See Comp., ¶ 165.  The eleventh cause \n8 of action challenges the settlement on due process and equal protection grounds, \n9 namely that the settlement distinguished between Skid Row and the rest of the City \n10 without a rational reason for doing so.  In addition to those causes of action that \n11 explicitly mention the Mitchell settlement, other causes of action, including the first, \n12 third through fourth, and seventh causes of action for negligence, nuisance, and \n13 violations of substantive due process, relate to conditions in Skid Row that Plaintiffs \n14 allege throughout the complaint were caused by the Mitchell injunction and \n15 settlement.   See e.g., Comp., ¶¶ 30, 37, 48; Comp., Pg. 47. 1\n16 To satisfy the second prong of the test for intervention as a matter of right, \n17 Proposed Intervenors must show that “the disposition of this case will, as a practical \n18 matter, affect” the interest at stake.

Again, as with all of the factors, the proposed intervenors “need \n20 not demonstrate that their interest would be impaired in a legal sense, only that their \n21\n22\n1 Proposed Intervenors also have legally protected interests stemming from \n23 advocacy to pass and subsequently to protect the integrity of Measure HHH, see \nWashington State Building & Construction Trades v. Spellman, 684 F.2d 627 (9th \n24\nCir. 982), as well as on behalf of their members, who have a protectable interest to \n25 be free from increased enforcement and the violation of their constitutional rights.  \nAlthough less concrete than the right to protect their settlement, Courts have \n26\nrecognized these as sufficient interests to support intervention, particularly where, \n27\nas here, there is no other representation of unsheltered homeless people in Los \n28 Angeles, who are most likely to be impacted by any proposed remedies in this \ncase.  \n4 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nORDER GRANTING EX PARTE APPLICATION TO INTERVENE \n\n\n\nII. LA CAN AND LACW SHOULD BE ALLOWED PERMISSIVE\n1\nINTERVENTION\n2\nIn the alternative, this court finds that the Proposed Intervenors have also met \n3\nthe requirements of Rule 24(b), which allows permissive intervention when “an \n4\napplicant’s claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in \n5\ncommon.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1)(B).  Permissive intervention is in the “broad \n6\ndiscretion of the trial court.” GOJO Indus., Inc. v. Barough, (“GOJO”), No. \n7\nSACV171382DOCJDEX, 2018 WL 5880829, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 2, 2018). \n8\nLACAN and LACW represent important interests in this case that are otherwise not \n9\nrepresented and as such, should be allowed to permissively intervene.   \n10\n  As noted above, none of the parties currently in the case, include any \n11\nindividual who is currently unsheltered in Los Angeles.  On the other hand, LA CAN \n12\nand LACW have members and clients who live on the streets. Moreover, organizers \n13\nand staff of LA CAN and LACW monitor what is happening on the streets, not just in \n14\nSkid Row, but throughout Los Angeles. For example, the complaint alleges that the \n15\nencampment under the overpass at Venice and the 405 is blocking the sidewalk.  LA \n16\nCAN has organizers and members that regularly visit that encampment and are \n17\nfamiliar with the conditions there.  The sweeps and property seizures at the overpass \n18\nat Venice and the 405 divert LA CAN’s resources; yet this lawsuit is alleging the \n19\nneed for increased sweeps and enforcement. Complaint at 177.   \n20\nSimilarly, LA CAN, as mentioned above, has unhoused members that reside \n21\non Skid Row and would be impacted by increased sweeps and enforcement. Not only \n22\nare their interests affected, their participation will aid the court in determining the \n23\nfactual context of the litigation and in proving or disproving the parties’ statements \n24\nabout accessibility and state-created danger.  It will also aid the court to hear from \n25\nun-sheltered individuals, as the only unhoused individual who is a Plaintiff  became \n26\nsheltered prior to the lawsuit beginning. \n27\n28\nThe Court finds that LA CAN and LACW have meet the standard for \n6\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n ORDER GRANTING EX PARTE APPLICATION TO INTERVENE \n\n1 intervention as of right, as this litigation has significant potential to impact the \n2 settlement reached in the Mitchell case.  It is so ORDERED. \n3\n18\nDated: March  , 2020 \n4\n5   The Honorable David O. Carter \n  United States District Judge\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n7 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n ORDER GRANTING EX PARTE APPLICATION TO INTERVENE ",

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \n7 Procedure 41(a)(2), Plaintiffs hereby request an order dismissing this action against \n8 the County with regard to all claims in their entirety, with prejudice, and request this \n9 Court retain jurisdiction for purposes of enforcing their agreement until the end of \n10 fiscal year 2026/2027 (i.e., June 30, 2027). A copy of the settlement agreement is \n1 \nP  471 11 attached hereto as Exhibit 1.  \nL 6-\nertus, Landes & Umhofer, L1990SBD.,S705  OUTH UNDY R UITE LA.CA90025 OS NGELES   310-826-4700;F310-82ONE  ACSIMILE  1111123456 dCddiiiosssummmniiitsssyRsss   ahuatlhan liees sa i  4rscn e1tcori(lo vaalnoe)im(d nw2 gsa)ie  ntaprh g eaoaarnvumisnatw iisatltsea  c trbaho l[ euepD  rlCatak sioot n.our t3dfni f2etrfyr0i  gt.]bo ,h y  Sats  e feuceienlo ikFdun eeargrtd    v..oR  o.Rr uld.u .lea enCr  nt 4iiaovs1r t.y(r iaPec d)qe.(i  u14soim)1fr( (eAidadsi)s) s((fam1iol)) r.ib   s(P ysaBla  ace“lio cpbnualetaurififtson feosrt rei ttfd hofte eh mr e i afy  \np H\nS EP\nL\nTE 17 opposing party serves either an answer” or “a stipulation of dismissal signed by all \n18 parties who have appeared”).1  A request for voluntary dismissal should be denied \n19 only when the defendant will suffer “plain legal prejudice.”  Waller v. Financial \n20 Corp. of Am., 828 F.2d 579, 583 (9th Cir. 1987).  The County will suffer no legal \n21 prejudice because the County consents to Plaintiffs’ request for dismissal, which is \n22 submitted by Plaintiffs as a condition of the settlement reached between the County \n23 and Plaintiffs.  \n24 Rule 41(a)(2) provides that the trial court may impose terms and conditions on \n25 an order of voluntary dismissal.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2).  The purpose of this rule is \n26  \n27  \n1 The parties are also unable to obtain consent to a stipulated dismissal from \n28 Gary Whitter, who has been incommunicable for months, as explained in Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel’s July 11, 2022 Ex Parte Application to Withdraw as Counsel.

See Cross v. Westchester Dev. Corp. V \n22 Chiulli, 887 F.2d 431, 432 (2nd Cir. 1989); McCall-Bey v. Franzen, 777 F.2d 1178, \n33 1183-84 (7th Cir. 1985).  Because the County will not be prejudiced in any way by \n44 the requested order, there is no need to impose any conditions to the order granting \n55 dismissal.  Moreover, the parties’ settlement agreement provides for the allocation of \n66 costs and attorneys' fees. \n77 CONCLUSION \n88 For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs and the County respectfully request that \n99 the Court enter an order dismissing Plaintiffs’ claims against the County with \n1100 prejudice and retaining jurisdiction for purposes of enforcing their agreement until \n1 \nP  471 1111 the end of fiscal year 2026/2027 (i.e., June 30, 2027). \nL 6-\nertus, Landes & Umhofer, L1990SBD.,S705  OUTH UNDY R UITE LA.CA90025 OS NGELES   310-826-4700;F310-82ONE  ACSIMILE  11111111112345623456  D  ated:  Octob er 17,  2022    R/SEsPle/i sEzEpaRlebizTceattUfbhuSe lAt,lh y.L   AMsAu.

COUNTY OF LA \n \nBefore: Jacqueline H. Nguyen, John B. Owens, and \nMichelle T. Friedland, Circuit Judges. \n \nOpinion by Judge Nguyen \n \n \nSUMMARY* \n \n \nCivil Rights \n \n  The  panel  vacated  the  district  court’s  preliminary \ninjunction order and remanded for further proceedings in an \naction brought by LA Alliance for Human Rights and eight \nindividual Plaintiffs against the County and City of Los \nAngeles  for  harms  stemming  from  the  proliferation  of \nencampments in the Skid Row area. \n \n  LA Alliance is a coalition of Los Angeles residents \nwhose  members  include  business  and  property  owners, \nlandlords, housed residents of the Skid Row area, formerly \nhomeless residents of a Skid Row-area mission, and a real \nestate professional with an interest in the downtown area.  \nPlaintiffs’ complaint generally alleged that County and City \npolicies and inaction have created a dangerous environment \nin the Skid Row area and that the situation is deteriorating.   \n \n  After  extensive  negotiations  failed  to  produce  a \nsettlement,  Plaintiffs  filed  a  Motion  for  Preliminary \nInjunction seeking a court order requiring the County and \nCity to offer shelter to all unhoused individuals in Skid Row, \n \n* This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.  It \nhas been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 352   Filed 09/23/21   Page 5 of 29   Page ID #:9032\n  LA ALLIANCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS V. COUNTY OF LA  5 \n \nclear all Skid Row encampments, prohibit camping there, \nand more.  The Motion was grounded in the legal theories \nalleged in the complaint, including: a claim that the County \nviolated its mandatory duty to provide medically necessary \ncare under California Welfare and Institutions Code section \n17000 by failing to provide shelter to unhoused individuals; \na claim that the County and City have facilitated public \nnuisance violations by failing to clear encampments; several \nclaims that the City violated state and federal disability \naccess laws by failing to clear sidewalks of encampments; \nand claims that the County and City violated Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional rights by providing disparate services to those \nliving and working within the Skid Row area and by enacting \npolicies regarding Skid Row that have resulted in a state-\ncreated danger to Skid Row-area residents and businesses. \n \n  The  district  court  issued  a  sweeping  preliminary \ninjunction against the County and City of Los Angeles and \nordered, among other relief:  the escrow of $1 billion to \naddress the homelessness crisis, offers of shelter or housing \nto all unhoused individuals in Skid Row within 180 days, \nand numerous audits and reports.  The district court’s order \nwas premised on its finding that structural racism—in the \nform  of  discriminatory  lending,  real  estate  covenants, \nredlining,  freeway  construction,  eminent  domain, \nexclusionary  zoning,  and  unequal  access  to  shelter  and \naffordable  housing—was  the  driving  force  behind  Los \nAngeles’s  homelessness  crisis  and  its  disproportionate \nimpact on the Black community.   The district court found \nthat Plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of success on the \nmerits of six claims: violations of due process rights under \nthe state-created danger and special relationship doctrines; \nviolation of equal protection on the basis of race; violation \nof the substantive due process rights of Black families to \nfamily  integrity;  violation  of  California  Welfare  and \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 352   Filed 09/23/21   Page 6 of 29   Page ID #:9033\n6  LA ALLIANCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS V. COUNTY OF LA \n \nInstitutions  Code  section  17000;  and  violation  of  the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”).   \n \n  The panel held that, as the claims were articulated by the \ndistrict court, Plaintiffs lacked standing on all but their ADA \nclaim.  The panel stated that none of Plaintiffs’ claims were \nbased on racial discrimination and the district court’s order \nwas  largely  based  on  unpled  claims  and  theories.    The \ndistrict court therefore abused its discretion because it only \nhad equitable power to grant relief on the merits of the case \nor controversy before it and did not have the authority to \nissue  an  injunction  based  on  claims  not  pled  in  the \ncomplaint.  Moreover, because plaintiffs did not bring most \nof the claims upon which relief was granted, they failed to \nput forth evidence to establish standing.  To fill the gap, the \ndistrict court impermissibly resorted to independent research \nand extra-record evidence.  The panel noted that the district \ncourt had cited material not subject to judicial notice and \nrelied on facts contained in various publications that were \nsubject to reasonable dispute.  To the extent the district court \npremised the injunctive relief on improperly noticed facts \nnecessary to confer standing, the district court abused its \ndiscretion. \n \n  Turning to the six claims upon which relief was granted, \nthe panel noted that Plaintiffs brought no race-based claims, \nand they did not allege or present any evidence that any \nindividual Plaintiff or LA Alliance member was Black—\nmuch less Black and unhoused, a parent, or at risk of losing \ntheir children.  Nor had plaintiffs alleged or argued that there \nwas a special relationship between the City and unhoused \nresidents of Skid Row or that they experienced restraints of \npersonal liberty sufficient to create an affirmative duty for \nthe City to protect their rights.   The panel concluded that \nPlaintiffs had not made a clear showing that any individual \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 352   Filed 09/23/21   Page 7 of 29   Page ID #:9034\n  LA ALLIANCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS V. COUNTY OF LA  7 \n \nPlaintiff had standing for the race-based claims, including \nthe substantive due process, equal protection, and state-\ncreated danger claims.  With respect to the section 17000 \nclaim, plaintiffs lacked standing because they failed to allege \nthat  an  individual  Plaintiff  was  deprived  of  medically \nnecessary care or general assistance.   \n \n  The panel held that the two individual Plaintiffs who \nrequire wheelchairs for daily activities and cannot traverse \nsidewalks  within  Skid  Row  because  of  homeless \nencampments had standing to bring ADA claims against the \nCity.  Their claim failed, however, because they had not \nshown a likelihood of success at this stage; Plaintiffs did not \noffer sufficient evidence that they were denied the benefits \nof the City’s sidewalks or were otherwise discriminated \nagainst  by  the  City  and  that  such  denial  of  benefits  or \ndiscrimination was by reason of their disabilities.  Moreover, \nthe district court abused its discretion by relying on extra-\nrecord evidence to find success on the merits and by ordering \noverly broad relief. \n \n  The panel rejected the argument that LA Alliance had \nassociational standing to seek relief under all the claims \nupon which the injunction was based.  The panel held that, \nlike  the  individual  Plaintiffs,  no  other  member  of  LA \nAlliance had alleged injuries sufficient for standing to bring \nthe substantive due process, state-created danger, special \nrelationship, equal protection, or section 17000 claims upon \nwhich relief was granted. \n   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 352   Filed 09/23/21   Page 8 of 29   Page ID #:9035\n8  LA ALLIANCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS V.

COUNTY OF LA \n \nOPINION \nNGUYEN, Circuit Judge: \nNearly one in four unhoused people in this country live \nin Los Angeles County, and the crisis is worsening.  In 2020, \nover 66,000 individuals were unhoused in the County, a 13% \nincrease over the previous year.  Perhaps nowhere is the \nemergency more apparent than on Los Angeles’s Skid Row, \nwhich encompasses more than 50 blocks of downtown.  Skid \nRow has become symbolic of the City’s homelessness crisis \ndue to its history as an area with a high concentration of \nunhoused  individuals,  its  extreme  density  of  tent \nencampments on public sidewalks, and its frequent incidents \nof violence and disease.  In Skid Row and elsewhere in the \nCounty, the conditions of street living, lack of sufficient \nservices, and lack of pathways to permanent housing have \nhad  a  devastating  impact  on  the  health  and  safety  of \nunhoused Angelenos and the communities in which they \nlive.  These conditions, and local governments’ approach to \nthe issue, have repeatedly been the subject of litigation. \nPlaintiff  LA  Alliance  for  Human  Rights  and  eight \nindividual  plaintiffs  sued  the  County  and  City  of  Los \nAngeles  for  harms  stemming  from  the  proliferation  of \nencampments in the Skid Row area.  They allege that County \nand City policies and inaction have created a dangerous \nenvironment  in  Skid  Row,  to  the  detriment  of  local \nbusinesses  and  residents.    The  litigation  was  stayed  for \nnearly  a  year  while  the  district  court  devoted  an \nextraordinary amount of time and effort to understanding the \nparties’  positions  and  encouraging  settlement.    After \nextensive negotiations failed to produce a settlement, the \ndistrict  court  issued  a  sweeping  preliminary  injunction \nagainst the County and City of Los Angeles and ordered, \namong other relief: the escrow of $1 billion to address the \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 352   Filed 09/23/21   Page 11 of 29   Page ID\n#:9038\n  LA ALLIANCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS V. COUNTY OF LA  11 \n \nhomelessness  crisis,  offers  of  shelter  or  housing  to  all \nunhoused individuals in Skid Row within 180 days, and \nnumerous audits and reports. \nThe district court’s order is premised on its finding that \nstructural racism—in the form of discriminatory lending, \nreal  estate  covenants,  redlining,  freeway  construction, \neminent domain, exclusionary zoning, and unequal access to \nshelter and affordable housing—is the driving force behind \nLos Angeles’s homelessness crisis and its disproportionate \nimpact on the Black community.  Faulting the County and \nCity  for  being  “unable  or  unwilling  to  devise  effective \nsolutions to L.A.’s homelessness crisis,” the district court \ndetermined  it  was  compelled  to  act  because  the  “ever-\nworsening  public  health  and  safety  emergency  demands \nimmediate, life-saving action.” \nThe  parties  take  no  issue  with  the  district  court’s \nconclusion that structural racism has played a significant role \nin the current homelessness crisis in the Los Angeles area.  \nBut  none  of  Plaintiffs’  claims  is  based  on  racial \ndiscrimination, and the district court’s order is largely based \non  unpled  claims  and  theories.    On  appeal,  Plaintiffs \nembrace the entirety of the district court’s order, but because \nthey did not bring most of the claims upon which relief was \ngranted,  they  failed  to  put  forth  evidence  to  establish \nstanding.  To fill the gap, the district court impermissibly \nresorted to independent research and extra-record evidence.  \nFor these reasons, we vacate the preliminary injunction and \nremand for further proceedings. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 352   Filed 09/23/21   Page 12 of 29   Page ID\n#:9039\n12  LA ALLIANCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS V. COUNTY OF LA \n \nI \nA \nLA Alliance is a coalition of Los Angeles residents.  \nMembers include business and property owners, landlords, \nhoused residents of the Skid Row area, formerly homeless \nresidents of a Skid Row-area mission, and a real estate \nprofessional with an interest in the downtown area.  Six of \nthe  nine  individuals  alleged  to  be  representative  of  LA \nAlliance’s membership own property or have business or \norganizational  interests  in  and  around  homeless \nencampments.  Five of the eight LA Alliance members who \nare individual Plaintiffs, including two who use wheelchairs, \nlive in or near Skid Row. \nIn  2019,  LA  Alliance  unsuccessfully  attempted  to \nintervene in and object to the settlement of Mitchell v. City \nof Los Angeles, No. 2:16-cv-01750 (C.D. Cal. filed Mar. 14, \n2016).  The Mitchell settlement, which applies for three \nyears to certain blocks in the Skid Row area, limits the City’s \nability to clear or destroy the property of unhoused people \nand requires notice of any cleanups.  However, it allows the \nCity  to  move  property  without  notice  to  permit  access \nrequired by the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”).1 \nDenied intervenor status in Mitchell, LA Alliance and \neight of its individual members filed this suit against the \nCounty and City on March 10, 2020.  On March 17 and 18, \n \n1 LA Alliance contends that the Mitchell settlement “has led to a \nsharp decline in health and safety.”  LA Alliance also takes issue with \nour  holding  in  Martin  v.  City  of  Boise  that  municipalities  cannot \n“prosecut[e] people criminally for sleeping outside on public property \nwhen those people have no home or other shelter to go to.”  920 F.3d \n584, 603 (9th Cir. 2019). \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 352   Filed 09/23/21   Page 13 of 29   Page ID\n#:9040\n  LA ALLIANCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS V. COUNTY OF LA  13 \n \n2020,  the  district  court  granted  some  of  the  Mitchell \nplaintiffs’ applications to intervene as of right to protect their \ninterest in the Mitchell settlement.  One of those intervenors, \nCangress, dba Los Angeles Community Action Network \n(“Cangress”), is also a party to this appeal. \nB \nThe Complaint asserts fourteen causes of action under \nstate and federal law.  In general, the Complaint alleges that \nCounty  and  City  policies  and  inaction  have  created  a \ndangerous environment in the Skid Row area and that the \nsituation is only deteriorating.  Specifically, Plaintiffs allege \nthat  the  County  and  City’s  failures  to  curb  rising \nhomelessness, combined with various settlements and court \norders protecting the rights of homeless individuals, have \nresulted in violent crime, the deterioration of public order, \nunsanitary  conditions,  needless  death,  the  usurpation  of \npublic sidewalks, and damage to the natural environment.  \nPlaintiffs also allege that this crisis has negatively affected \nproperty  values  in  downtown  and  Skid  Row,  harming \nPlaintiffs’ ability to sell, rent, and operate their properties.  \nVarious Plaintiffs also allege that they cannot safely traverse \nSkid Row sidewalks, have experienced property damage due \nto the proliferation of encampments, and are exposed to \nviolence and human suffering daily. \nC \nFor  over  a  year,  the  district  court  and  the  parties, \nincluding Intervenor Cangress, engaged in almost a dozen \nsettlement and status conferences.  At various times the \ndistrict court heard from non-party community members \n(housed  and  unhoused),  clergy,  City  Council  members, \nCounty Commissioners, the Mayor of Los Angeles, and \nrepresentatives from state and federal agencies.  The district \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 352   Filed 09/23/21   Page 14 of 29   Page ID\n#:9041\n14  LA ALLIANCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS V. COUNTY OF LA \n \ncourt  devoted  an  extraordinary  amount  of  effort  toward \nunderstanding  and  encouraging the parties to implement \nsolutions  that  would  improve  the  lives  of  unhoused \nAngelenos. \nWith no settlement forthcoming, on January 31, 2021, \nthe district court issued an “order to appear and show cause.”  \nThe order sought inventories of County and City properties, \nfinancial disclosures, and briefing on the “outer limit of the \nCourt’s  structural  equitable  remedy  power”  and  “all \nequitable remedies available to the Court that would require \nthe City . . . to take action to provide relief to the homeless \ncommunity.” \nPlaintiffs responded by filing a Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction seeking a court order that required the County and \nCity to offer shelter to all unhoused individuals in Skid Row, \nclear all Skid Row encampments, prohibit camping there, \nand more.  The Motion was grounded in the legal theories \nalleged in the Complaint and based on eight of Plaintiffs’ \nfourteen claims, including: a claim that the County violated \nits  mandatory  duty  to  provide  medically  necessary  care \nunder  California  Welfare  and  Institutions  Code  section \n17000 by failing to provide shelter to unhoused individuals; \na claim that the County and City have facilitated public \nnuisance violations by failing to clear encampments; several \nclaims that the City violated state and federal disability \naccess laws by failing to clear sidewalks of encampments; \nand claims that the County and City violated Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional rights by providing disparate services to those \nliving and working within the Skid Row area and by enacting \npolicies regarding Skid Row that have resulted in a state-\ncreated danger to Skid Row-area residents and businesses. \nAlthough  none  of  these  claims  alleged  racial \ndiscrimination, Plaintiffs’ Motion included a short section \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 352   Filed 09/23/21   Page 15 of 29   Page ID\n#:9042\n  LA ALLIANCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS V. COUNTY OF LA  15 \n \nhighlighting statements made at status conferences and a \nreport acknowledging the impact systemic racism has had on \nhomelessness.  During status conferences, the district court \nhad  engaged  in  numerous  colloquies  regarding  the \ndisproportionate  number  of  unhoused  Black  and  Latino \nAngelenos and had expressed interest in the relationship \nbetween systemic racism and homelessness. \nD \nShortly after the County and City filed their oppositions \nto  Plaintiffs’  Motion,  the  district  court  issued  an  order \ngranting a preliminary injunction (“Order”).  The Order \ndetailed, over sixty-three single-spaced pages, the County \nand City’s “historical constitutional violations” stemming \nfrom  structural  racism.    Beginning  with  Los  Angeles’s \napproach to poor residents living in unpermitted wooden \nstructures during the first half of the twentieth century, the \ndistrict court described the impact of the “racially segmented \neconomy” during the Great Depression, the rise of “state-\nenforced racially-restrictive [real estate] covenants,” and the \nsegregated homelessness-services systems of the 1920s and \n1930s.  Drawing from academic and media sources, the \ndistrict court explained this country’s history of redlining, \nwhich created a “cycle of disinvestment” and “a lasting \n[racial] wealth gap.”  The district court explored the impact \nand  history  of  “Los  Angeles’s  ‘urban  renewal’”  efforts, \nincluding  the  use  of  eminent  domain  and  highway \nconstruction to “displac[e] Black families on a large scale.” \nThe  district  court  then  found  that  the  City’s  1976 \nadoption  of  a  Containment  Policy  was  aimed  at \n“‘contain[ing]’ homeless people” within a 55-block zone “to \nmaintain the pristineness of the business district.”  The court \nfound  that  this  policy  “demarcate[d]  Skid  Row  as  a \nconcentration  for  rehabilitation  services,”  facilitating  an \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 352   Filed 09/23/21   Page 16 of 29   Page ID\n#:9043\n16  LA ALLIANCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS V. COUNTY OF LA \n \n“ensuing  cycle  of  incarceration  and  homelessness—\ndisproportionately targeting Black communities.” \nThe district court recounted shortcomings of affordable \nhousing efforts in and around Los Angeles, and the disparate \nimpact of COVID-19 on Black renters.  It criticized the \nCity’s leaders for failing to effectively use their emergency \npowers  and  blasted  corruption  and  misappropriation  of \ntaxpayer-allocated funds, missed deadlines, and the lack of \na plan to solve the crisis.  The district court compellingly \ndescribed the ill effects of the growing crisis: fires; rising \ndeaths of unhoused Angelenos; unhoused Angelenos living \nnear pollution-heavy roadways; unaddressed mental health \ndisorders, particularly among unhoused Angelenos of color; \nand  the  spread  of  uncommon  diseases  due  to  lack  of \nsanitation.  Finally, the district court highlighted the “unique \nimpact  that  homelessness  has  on  women,”  noting  that \n“women of color” are significantly overrepresented in the \nhomeless population and in the population of those who die \non the streets. \nBased  on  these  extensive  findings,  the  district  court \nfound a likelihood of success on the merits of six claims \nagainst both the County and City: \n1)  Violation of due process rights under the \nstate-created danger doctrine, based on \nactions that created danger to the “Black \ncommunity”  by  “creat[ing]  or \nworsen[ing]  the  discriminatory \nhomelessness  regime  that  plagues  Los \nAngeles today,” as well as actions that \ncreated  a  danger  to  those  living  in \nencampments, most notably a high rate of \npreventable deaths. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 352   Filed 09/23/21   Page 17 of 29   Page ID\n#:9044\n  LA ALLIANCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS V. COUNTY OF LA  17 \n \n2)  Violation of due process rights under the \nspecial relationship doctrine based on the \nCounty  and  City’s  “lengthy  history  of \ndiscriminatory  policies,  . . .  [which] \nrestrain[] the personal liberty of L.A.’s \nhomeless population to such an extent as \nto trigger the state’s affirmative duty to \nact.” \n3)  Violation of equal protection on the basis \nof  race.    The  court  found  that  the \ndisproportionate  death  rates  of  Black \npeople  compared  to  “their  white \ncounterparts . . . can be directly traced to \na  history  of  structural  racism  and \ndiscrimination.” \n4)  Violation of the substantive due process \nright of Black families to family integrity, \ncaused by “decades of systemic racism” \nand “City and County policies enacted \nagainst Black communities.” \n5)  Violation  of  California  Welfare  and \nInstitutions Code section 17000, which \nimposes a mandatory duty of care on the \nCounty.    The  court  expanded  section \n17000’s application to the City. \n6)  Violation of the ADA by both the County \nand City. \nOf these six claims, Plaintiffs had not asserted or moved \nfor injunctive relief on the first four and had asserted the fifth \nagainst only the County and the sixth against only the City.  \nThe district court’s explanation for why these claims had a \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 352   Filed 09/23/21   Page 18 of 29   Page ID\n#:9045\n18  LA ALLIANCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS V. COUNTY OF LA \n \nlikelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  also  relied  on  legal \ntheories that Plaintiffs did not plead or argue, including the \nrace-based discrimination theories underpinning the state-\ncreated  danger,  equal  protection,  and  substantive  due \nprocess claims.  In addition, the district court relied almost \nexclusively on extra-record evidence, and expressly did not \nrely on Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction evidence. \nThe district court ordered extensive relief.2  The Order \nrequires numerous independent audits, investigations, and \nreports related to the County and City’s funds, properties, \nand contractual relationships with developers; the cessation \nof land and property transfers County- and City-wide; offers \nof shelter to all unhoused individuals on Skid Row within \n180 days; the creation of a “plan that ensures the uplifting \nand  enhancement  of  Skid  Row  without  involuntarily \ndisplacing current residents;” and the escrow of $1 billion to \naddress homelessness. \nE \nOn April 28 and 29, 2021, the County and City filed \nemergency motions with this court to stay the preliminary \ninjunction pending appeal.  A motions panel granted an \n \n2 The Order tracks some of the relief requested by Plaintiffs but \ndiffers in key respects.  For example, Plaintiffs did not request that any \nfunds be escrowed but sought to have all homeless individuals within \nSkid Row offered shelter in 90 days.  The difference between Plaintiffs’ \nrequest and the ordered relief is not in itself problematic.  See Kirola v. \nCity & County of San Francisco, 860 F.3d 1164, 1176 (9th Cir. 2017) \n(“The district court is not bound by [movant’s] proposal, and may enter \nany injunction it deems appropriate, so long as the injunction is ‘no more \nburdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief \nto the plaintiffs.’” (quoting United States v.

Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 102 (1998).  We \nmust assure ourselves that Plaintiffs have standing and that \njurisdiction otherwise exists before we review the merits of \nthe district court’s preliminary injunction decision, whether \nor  not  the  issue  was  raised  below.    Associated  Gen. \nContractors of Cal., Inc. v. Coal. for Econ. Equity, 950 F.2d \n1401, 1405 (9th Cir. 1991). \nTo have standing, Plaintiffs must have “(1) suffered an \ninjury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged \nconduct  of  the  defendant,  and  (3)  that  is  likely  to  be \nredressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. \nRobins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016).  At the preliminary \ninjunction stage, the plaintiffs “must make a clear showing \nof each element of standing,” Yazzie v.

COUNTY OF LA  21 \n \nIII \nThe district court found that Plaintiffs have shown a \nlikelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  of  six  claims.    We \nconclude that, as the claims were articulated by the district \ncourt, Plaintiffs lack standing on all but one claim.  Plaintiffs \ncannot  prevail  on  that  claim,  however,  without  further \ndevelopment of the factual record and tailoring of the relief \nto Plaintiffs’ injuries. \nA \nAs we discussed, the district court granted relief based \non claims that Plaintiffs did not allege, supported by novel \nlegal  theories  that  Plaintiffs  did  not  argue,  or  against \nDefendants against whom the claim was not pled.  In doing \nso, the district court abused its discretion because it only had \nequitable power to grant relief on “the merits of the case or \ncontroversy before it,” and “does not have the authority to \nissue  an  injunction”  “based  on  claims  not  pled  in  the \ncomplaint.”  Pac. Radiation Oncology, LLC v. Queen’s Med. \nCtr., 810 F.3d 631, 633 (9th Cir. 2015). \nThe mismatch between the six claims underlying the \nOrder  and  Plaintiffs’  own  claims  explains  a  second \noverarching problem: the district court’s almost exclusive \nreliance on extra-record evidence.  Although our review of \nthe district court’s factual findings is deferential, the district \ncourt abuses its discretion if its conclusions are “without \nsupport in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the \nrecord.”  Disney Enters., Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc., 869 F.3d \n848,  856  (9th  Cir.  2017)  (quoting  Pimentel  v.  Dreyfus, \n670 F.3d 1096, 1105 (9th Cir. 2012) (per curiam)).  Plaintiffs \nsubmitted some preliminary injunction evidence, but the \nCounty objected to most of it and the district court expressly \ndid not rely on any of the objected-to evidence.  Instead, the \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 352   Filed 09/23/21   Page 22 of 29   Page ID\n#:9049\n22  LA ALLIANCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS V. COUNTY OF LA \n \ndistrict court relied on its own independent research and \ncited material not subject to judicial notice.  Lee v. City of \nLos Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 688 (9th Cir. 2001) (courts may \nnot “[take] judicial notice of the truth of disputed factual \nmatters”); accord Fed. R. Evid. 201.  The district court relied \non hundreds of facts contained in various publications for \ntheir  truth,4  and  a  significant  number  of  facts  directly \nunderlying the injunctive relief are subject to reasonable \ndispute.  For instance, experts extensively debate the history, \npurpose, and effect of the Containment Policy, which the \ndistrict  court  found  resulted  in  the  “incarceration  and \nhomelessness”  of  Black  Angelenos.    To  the  extent  the \ndistrict court premised the injunctive relief on improperly \nnoticed facts necessary to confer standing, the district court \nabused its discretion.  Cf. Lee, 250 F.3d at 690 (holding that \nthe district court erred in granting a motion to dismiss “by \nrelying on extrinsic evidence and by taking judicial notice of \ndisputed matters of fact to support its ruling”). \nB \nWe now turn to Plaintiffs’ standing to bring the six \nclaims upon which relief was granted.5  To begin with, \nbecause Plaintiffs brought no race-based claims, they did not \nallege or present any evidence that any individual Plaintiff \nor LA Alliance member is Black—much less Black and \n \n4 Only 22 of the 411 footnotes supporting the district court’s factual \nfindings included a citation to the record. \n5 We do not address whether Plaintiffs have standing to bring any \nclaims that they asserted but the district court did not address. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 352   Filed 09/23/21   Page 23 of 29   Page ID\n#:9050\n  LA ALLIANCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS V. COUNTY OF LA  23 \n \nunhoused, a parent,6 or at risk of losing their children.  Thus, \nPlaintiffs have not made a clear showing that any individual \nPlaintiff has standing for the race-based claims, including \nthe substantive due process, equal protection, and state-\ncreated danger claims. \nPlaintiffs also have not clearly shown that any individual \nPlaintiff has standing to bring the state-created danger claim \nthat the district court fashioned.  The district court grounded \nits state-created danger claim in a risk of premature death of \nthose living in encampments.  Only Plaintiff Whitter may \nhave suffered a relevant injury-in-fact because he has been \nchronically unhoused and is merely temporarily sheltered at \na Skid Row mission.  However, neither Plaintiffs nor the \ndistrict court have explained how the relief ordered would \nhelp Whitter.  For example, the Order requires that the \nCounty and City offer “shelter or housing” to unhoused \nindividuals in Skid Row within 180 days, but Whitter is \nalready in a shelter and nothing in the record suggests he will \nlose his shelter in time to receive an offer.  See Lujan v. Defs. \nof Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992) (observing it must be \nlikely,  not  merely  speculative,  that  the  injury  will  be \nredressed by a favorable decision).  Thus, Plaintiffs have not \nmade  the  required  “clear  showing”  that  any  individual \nPlaintiff has standing to bring the district court’s version of \nthe state-created danger claim.  Yazzie, 977 F.3d at 966. \n \n6 Plaintiffs submitted declarations from parents who are business \nowners and one housed individual who lives in an unspecified area of \ndowntown, but none state the declarant’s race or recount any risk of \nseparation from their children or loss of housing.  Plaintiffs did not bring \nany race- or family-based claims, so they had no reason to discuss these \nidentifiers. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 352   Filed 09/23/21   Page 24 of 29   Page ID\n#:9051\n24  LA ALLIANCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS V. COUNTY OF LA \n \nSimilarly, Plaintiffs did not allege or argue that there is a \nspecial relationship between the City and unhoused residents \nof Skid Row, or that any individual Plaintiff experiences \n“restraints  of  personal  liberty”  sufficient  to  create  an \naffirmative duty for the City to act to protect their rights.  \nPlaintiffs  have  therefore  not  clearly  shown  that  they \nthemselves were injured by any failure to protect anyone \nwith whom the City does have a special relationship.  Such \nallegations would be required for Plaintiffs to have standing \nunder DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social \nServices, 489 U.S. 189, 198–202 (1989). \nWith respect to the section 17000 claim, Plaintiffs have \nnot shown that any individual Plaintiff has standing to bring \nthis  claim  because  Plaintiffs  nowhere  allege  that  an \nindividual Plaintiff was deprived of medically necessary \ncare or general assistance, even under Plaintiffs’ and the \ndistrict court’s theory that shelter may be required care under \nthe statute.  Plaintiffs have therefore not asserted that they \nthemselves  were  injured  by  any  failure  to  comply  with \nsection 17000’s requirement to provide for support when an \nindigent  person  is  “not  supported  and  relieved  by  their \nrelatives or friends, by their own means, or by state hospitals \nor other state or private institutions.”  As a result, Plaintiffs \nlack standing for this claim—and because they asserted this \nclaim only against the County, the district court did not have \nauthority to grant relief against the City, anyway.  See Pac. \nRadiation, 810 F.3d at 633. \nBy contrast, two individual Plaintiffs have standing to \nbring  the  ADA  claim  against  the  City.7    The  record \n \n7 The district court did not have authority to grant relief against the \nCounty under the ADA claim, because Plaintiffs only asserted the claim \nagainst the City.  Pac. Radiation, 810 F.3d at 633. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 352   Filed 09/23/21   Page 25 of 29   Page ID\n#:9052\n  LA ALLIANCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS V. COUNTY OF LA  25 \n \ndemonstrates that Charles Van Scoy and Leandro Suarez \nrequire wheelchairs for their daily activities, see 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12102(1)(A) (defining disability to include “a physical . . . \nimpairment that substantially limits one or more major life \nactivities”), and cannot traverse sidewalks within Skid Row \nbecause of homeless encampments.  This injury is traceable \nto the City, because Skid Row area sidewalks are a service, \nprogram, or activity of the City within the meaning of Title \nII of the ADA.  See 42 U.S.C. § 12132; Barden v. City of \nSacramento, 292 F.3d 1073, 1077 (9th Cir. 2002).  To the \nextent the City is liable for the obstructions, clearing the \nsidewalks is also likely to redress Van Scoy and Suarez’s \ninjuries. \nC \nPlaintiffs  argue  that  LA  Alliance  has  associational \nstanding to seek relief under all the claims upon which the \ninjunction is based.  Associational standing exists if “[the \norganization’s] members would otherwise have standing to \nsue in their own right, the interests at stake are germane to \nthe organization’s purpose, and neither the claim asserted \nnor  the  relief  requested  requires  the  participation  of \nindividual members in the lawsuit.”  Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at \n181.  Because only a single plaintiff with standing is needed \nto  assert  a  claim,  we  need  only  consider  whether  LA \nAlliance has standing to assert the claims for which the \nindividual  Plaintiffs  lack  standing.    See  Nat’l  Ass’n  of \nOptometrists  &  Opticians  LensCrafters,  Inc.  v.  Brown, \n567 F.3d 521, 523 (9th Cir. 2009). \nLike the individual Plaintiffs, no other member of LA \nAlliance has alleged injuries sufficient for standing to bring \nthe substantive due process, state-created danger, special \nrelationship, equal protection, or section 17000 claims upon \nwhich relief was granted.  See Summers v. Earth Island Inst., \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 352   Filed 09/23/21   Page 26 of 29   Page ID\n#:9053\n26  LA ALLIANCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS V. COUNTY OF LA \n \n555 U.S. 488, 499 (2009) (explaining that to establish a \nmember’s injury for associational standing, an organization \nmust submit “individual affidavits” from “members who \nhave suffered the requisite harm”).  Plaintiffs allege that LA \nAlliance  consists  of  “a  broad  coalition  of  Los  Angeles \nstakeholders . . . working towards solutions to address the \n[homelessness]  crisis.”    There  is  no  evidence  that  LA \nAlliance’s  non-Plaintiff  members—including  those \ndescribed in supplemental affidavits filed with Plaintiff’s \nMotion—are Black,8 risk disruption of their family integrity, \nhave a special relationship with the City, are confined to \nSkid  Row,  or  were  deprived  of  the  type  of  assistance \nrequired  by  section  17000.    Plaintiffs’  supplemental \ndeclarations included some from unhoused members, but \nnone state that these members were members at the time of \nfiling.9  At oral argument, Plaintiffs’ counsel acknowledged \nthis gap in the supplemented record.  Because LA Alliance \nhas  not  shown  that  its  members  would  otherwise  have \nstanding to sue in their own right, it lacks associational \n \n8 On appeal, Plaintiffs assert that LA Alliance has Black members, \nbut none of the listed members identify themselves as Black (or anything \nelse). \n9 The fact that LA Alliance may have broadened its membership \nafter filing this action to include currently unhoused individuals—even \nones who were unhoused at the time of the Complaint—does not factor \ninto the standing calculus.  See Morongo Band of Mission Indians v. Cal. \nState Bd. of Equalization, 858 F.2d 1376, 1381 (9th Cir. 1988) (“[W]e \nmust examine the . . . original complaint to determine whether . . . the \ndistrict court had jurisdiction.  If [not], then the court’s various orders, \nincluding that granting leave to amend the complaint, were nullities.”).  \nDeclarations can remedy “defective allegations” of jurisdiction but “[do] \nnot provide a remedy for defective jurisdiction itself.”  Id. at 1380 n.3 \n(quoting Field v. Volkswagenwerk AG, 626 F.2d 293, 306 (3d Cir. \n1980)). \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 352   Filed 09/23/21   Page 27 of 29   Page ID\n#:9054\n  LA ALLIANCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS V. COUNTY OF LA  27 \n \nstanding for these five claims, and we need not reach the \nother elements of the associational standing test. \nD \nFinally, we consider the merits of Plaintiffs’ ADA claim \nagainst  the  City.  Although  this  claim  survives  our \njurisdictional analysis, it suffers from other flaws.  The ADA \nclaim fails on the first Winter factor, because Plaintiffs have \nnot shown a likelihood of success at this stage.  555 U.S. at \n20.  And the district court abused its discretion by relying on \nextra-record evidence to find success on the merits and by \nordering overly broad relief. \nPlaintiffs  failed  to  “establish  that  the  law  and  facts \nclearly favor [their] position.” Garcia, 786 F.3d at 740.  \nPlaintiffs had to show that Van Scoy and Suarez were denied \nthe  benefits  of  the  City’s  sidewalks  or  were  otherwise \ndiscriminated against by the City and that such denial of \nbenefits or discrimination was by reason of their disabilities.  \nWeinreich v. L.A. Cnty. Metro. Transp. Auth., 114 F.3d 976, \n978 (9th Cir. 1997); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12132.  Public \nsidewalk and architectural obstruction ADA claims are fact-\nintensive claims with specific requirements and evidentiary \nburdens.    See,  e.g.,  Kirola  v.  City  &  County  of  San \nFrancisco, 860 F.3d 1164, 1183 (9th Cir. 2017) (discussing \nevidentiary  burden  of  demonstrating  sidewalk \n“inaccessibility  at  a  programmatic  level”);  Chapman  v. \nPier 1  Imports  (U.S.)  Inc.,  779  F.3d  1001,  1008,  1010 \n(9th Cir.  2015)  (observing  that  movable  or  temporary \nobstructions are typically not architectural barriers, although \nfrequent  barriers  “must  be  viewed  systemically”).    But \nPlaintiffs’  allegations  centered  on  the  fact  that  blocked \nsidewalks “[p]ut [e]veryone at [r]isk,” and they did not offer \nsufficient evidence to make the required showing for Van \nScoy and Suarez to succeed on this claim at this stage.  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 352   Filed 09/23/21   Page 28 of 29   Page ID\n#:9055\n28  LA ALLIANCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS V. COUNTY OF LA \n \nPlaintiffs  also  failed  to  suggest  a  specific,  reasonable \naccommodation.  Instead, they seek the wholesale clearing \nof 50-plus blocks followed by criminal enforcement of anti-\ncamping and related ordinances.  This may be significantly \nbroader remedy than required for Van Scoy and Suarez to \nsafely navigate sidewalks to complete daily activities.  See \nPac. Radiation, 810 F.3d at 636 (holding that the plaintiff \nmust “establish a relationship between the injury claimed in \nthe  party’s  motion  and  the  conduct  asserted  in  the \ncomplaint” (quoting Devose v. Herrington, 42 F.3d 470, 471 \n(8th Cir. 1994) (per curiam))). \nAdopting Plaintiffs’ approach, the district court found a \nlikelihood of success on the merits of the ADA claim due to \nthe “[h]undreds of city sidewalks, not only in Skid Row but \nacross the City and County of Los Angeles, [that] fail to meet \nthe minimum requirements of the ADA due to the creation \nof homeless encampments.”  But the Order failed to explain \nhow the record supports Van Scoy and Suarez’s claim in \nparticular, or how the relief ordered (e.g., offering every \nperson in Skid Row shelter within 180 days) is tailored to \ntheir injuries (e.g., encountering blocked sidewalks while \nrunning errands).  The district court failed to analyze Van \nScoy and Suarez’s injuries or the requirements of their ADA \nclaim and abused its discretion by finding a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits.  The ADA claim is therefore unable \nto support the sweeping relief ordered in the preliminary \ninjunction.  Disney Enters., Inc., 869 F.3d at 856. \nIV \nThe district court undoubtedly has broad equitable power \nto  remedy  legal  violations  that  have  contributed  to  the \ncomplex problem of homelessness in Los Angeles.

Summary of Relief Sought  \n3  Proposed Intervenor-Plaintiff Venice Stakeholders Association (“VSA”) files \n4  this ex parte application to intervene. Plaintiff filed this action on March 10, 2020. \n5  VSA previously applied, ex parte, for leave to participate in this action as an amicus \n6  party (Doc. 45). That application was denied. (Doc. 57). VSA now seeks to \n7  intervene as a plaintiff.  \n8  This current action, brought by the Los Angeles Alliance for Human Rights \n9  (“LA Alliance”) an unincorporated association made up primarily of business \n10  owners in Downtown Los Angeles, seeks to have this court issue orders to compel \n11  the City and County of Los Angeles to take actions regarding homelessness that \n12  could greatly impact property owners, property renters and the homeless in all areas \n Jeff Lewis Lawp Valley Drive, Suite 200  Hills Estates, CA 90274 111345    otPafln aLginoibtsil feAf sin nsgteeetrlteleess  ttC hinois ut chnaitsys e,l i,n tpiogrtae jtvuiaositnl   datohftwaetrn w ttoriilwal lnb o eLr  nodesoc A ensnosgta eprilrleeysv .i amVilSp. aATihr heeda cs io fam  tdhpierl aeeicxnti tsa otninnd g fi le \n9 Deeolling  16  in this action and this Court’s future orders potentially impact all areas within Los \n0R\n6\n17  Angeles County including the Venice district of Los Angeles. The prayer for relief \n18  in the complaint includes a prayer for injunctive relief. If this Court issues (or \n19  withholds) injunctive relief pursuant to a trial or settlement, that relief will \n20  necessarily affect the provision of services to the homeless in Venice and that, in \n21  turn, will impact the quality of life of Venice residents, both property owners and \n22  renters. VSA is comprised of property owners and renters who live within Venice \n23  and are directly impacted by the homeless and the City and County’s efforts to \n24  address the needs of the homeless. VSA seeks to intervene for purposes of helping \n25  the Court fashion injunctive and declaratory relief. VSA disclaims all interest in any \n26  awards of damages.  \n27   \n28   \n- 4 - \nEX PARTE APPLICATION \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 66   Filed 04/14/20   Page 5 of 10   Page ID #:886\n \n1  II.  Background \n2  A.  Proposed Intervenor \n3  VSA, founded in 2009, is a nonprofit organization dedicated to civic \n4  improvement. The VSA supports slow growth, the limits of the Venice Local \n5  Coastal Specific Plan, neighborhood safety, better traffic circulation, increased \n6  parking for residents, neighborhood beautification projects, historic preservation, \n7  habitat restoration and protection of coastal waters. Representing residents in the \n8  Venice district of the City of Los Angeles, California, the VSA has grappled with \n9  the horrendous impact of the increase of the homeless population in Venice from \n10  approximately 400 persons in 2014 to 1,100 persons now, as documented by the \n11  Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority’s annual homeless count. \n12  The VSA provides research, education, advocacy and litigation support for \n Jeff Lewis Lawp Valley Drive, Suite 200  Hills Estates, CA 90274 111345    Vltihteeign Laictoieso  BnA eanaggcaehiln ersset s Ctihdoeeu nCnttsiyt ty oM o eefn tLrsouoprseo A ltihntaagnte  tlTheresai, rnt hsvpeoo iCcrteaaslti ifaoornern  Ahiaeu aCtrhdoo.ar VsittyaS lAo Cv ioesrm  ptmhreeis seesnrieotlcnyt i aoinnn d o f \n9 Deeolling  16  a 154-bed homeless shelter complex in violation of the California Environmental \n0R\n6\n17  Quality Act, VSA v. City of Los Angeles, Case No. 19STCP00044 and VSA v. Los \n18  Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Case No. 19STCP00629.1 \n19   \n20  III.  Proposed Intervenor is Entitled to Intervene as a Matter of Right \n21  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 24(a) provides that a party “who claims an \n22  interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is \n23  so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede \n24  the movant's ability to protect its interest” must be allowed to intervene in a case  \n25   \n26 \n \n27  1 Those cases are presently under discretionary writ review by the California Court \nof Appeal, Second District, Venice Stakeholders Association v. Superior Court of \n28 \nLos Angeles County, Case Number B304424. \n- 5 - \nEX PARTE APPLICATION \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 66   Filed 04/14/20   Page 6 of 10   Page ID #:887\n \n1  “unless existing parties adequately represent that interest.” (Fed. R. of Civ. Proc. \n2  24(a)(2)). \n3  To be granted intervention as a matter of right, the Proposed Intervenor must \n4  demonstrate that 1) it has a “significant protectable interest” relating to the matter \n5  that is the subject of the action; 2) a decision in the action may, as a practical \n6  matter, impair or impede the Proposed Intervenor’s ability to protect its interest; 3) \n7  the request to intervene is timely; and 4) the existing parties may not adequately \n8  represent proposed Intervenors’ interest. (Donnelly v. Glickman, 159 F.3d 405, 409 \n9  (9th Cir. 1998)). “Though the applicant bears the burden of establishing these \n10  elements, we have repeatedly instructed that ‘the requirements for intervention are \n11  [to be] broadly interpreted in favor of intervention.’” (Smith v. Los Angeles Unified \n12  School District, 830 F.3d 843, 853 (9th Cir. 2016)). VSA satisfies each of these \n Jeff Lewis Lawp Valley Drive, Suite 200  Hills Estates, CA 90274 111345    prongsAR. u. le 2V4(SaA) d hoaess  an oSti grenqiufiicrae ntht aPt rtohtee pctraobtelcet aIbnltee rinestet riens tT aht isst aLkieti igna tthioen  \n9 Deeolling  16  litigation be a specific legal or equitable interest.  \n0R\n6\nThe ‘interest’ test is not a clear-cut or bright-line rule, because no \n17 \nspecific legal or equitable interest need be established. Instead, the \n18  ‘interest’ test directs courts to make a practical, threshold inquiry, and \nis primarily a practical guide to disposing of lawsuits by involving as \n19 \nmany apparently concerned persons as is compatible with efficiency \n20  and due process.  \n21  (In re Estate of Ferdinand E. Marcos Human Rights Litigation, 536 F.3d 980, 984–\n22  85 (9th Cir. 2008)(quoting S. Cal. Edison Co. v. Lynch, 307 F.3d 794, 802 (9th \n23  Cir.2002)). \n24  As set forth in the accompanying declaration of VSA’s president, Mark \n25  Ryavec, VSA has a legally protectible interest in the outcome of this case. VSA \n26  provides research, education, advocacy and litigation support for Venice Beach \n27  residents to ensure that their voices are heard. (Ryavec Decl. ¶ 12). VSA, founded \n28  in 2009, is a nonprofit organization dedicated to civic improvement. The VSA \n- 6 - \nEX PARTE APPLICATION \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 66   Filed 04/14/20   Page 7 of 10   Page ID #:888\n \n1  supports slow growth, the limits of the Venice Local Coastal Specific Plan, \n2  neighborhood safety, better traffic circulation, increased parking for residents, \n3  neighborhood beautification projects, historic preservation, habitat restoration and \n4  protection of coastal waters. (Ryavec Decl. ¶ 10). \n5  B.  A Decision in this Action May Impair VSA’s Ability to Protect it \n6  Property and Other Interests in the Venice Area \n7  To satisfy the second prong of the test for intervention as a matter of right, \n8  VSA must show that “the disposition of this case will, as a practical matter, affect” \n9  the interest at stake. (California ex Rel. Lockyer v. U.S., 450 F.3d 436, 442 (9th Cir. \n10  2006)). Again, as with all of the factors VSA “need not demonstrate that their \n11  interest would be impaired in a legal sense, only that their interest ‘would be \n12  substantially affected in a practical sense.” (Sw. Ctf. for Biological Diversity v. \n Jeff Lewis Lawp Valley Drive, Suite 200  Hills Estates, CA 90274 111345    BCimeorpmga,mc 2t i6ttht8ee eF q N.u3oadlt ie8tsy1) 0)o., f H8 l2ief2ree  (,o9 tfth hteh C ere irrme.)ne (tdeqyrus os aotinundgg h hFto ebmdy.e  toRhw.e  Cneeixvris.s  tPwin.h g2o 4P c,l oaAmindptvirifisfsose rw yV ilSl Ad iarencdt ly \n9 Deeolling  16  live in Venice. (See Ryavec Decl., ¶¶ 14-20).  \n0R\n6\n17  C.  The Request is Timely \n18  VSA’s request is timely. A motion made “at an early stage of the \n19  proceedings” will generally satisfy the timeliness requirement. (See Citizens for \n20  Balanced Use v. Mont. Wilderness Ass’n, 647 F.3d 893, 897 (9th Cir. 2011)). This \n21  case was filed in March and this application was filed the following month, April. \n22  A prior request for modest participation as an amicus party was denied. \n23  D.  Existing Parties May Not Represent VSA’s Interests \n24  Finally, the parties in this case simply cannot adequately represent VSA’s \n25  interests. Whether another party’s representation of Applicants’ interests is \n26  adequate depends on: “(1) whether the interest of a present party is such that it will \n27  undoubtedly make all of a proposed intervenor’s arguments; (2) whether the present \n28  party is capable and willing to make such arguments; and (3) whether a proposed \n- 7 - \nEX PARTE APPLICATION \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 66   Filed 04/14/20   Page 8 of 10   Page ID #:889\n \n1  intervenor would offer any necessary elements to the proceeding that other parties \n2  would neglect.” (Arakaki v. Cayetano, 324 F.3d 1078, 1086 (9th Cir. 2003)). The \n3  burden to show that a party’s interests may not be adequately represented is minor: \n4  “The requirement of the Rule is satisfied if the applicant shows that representation \n5  of his interest ‘may be’ inadequate; and the burden of making that showing should \n6  be treated as minimal.” (Trbovich v. United Mine Workers of America, S. 528, 538 \n7  (1972)). \n8  i.  Differences between the Alliance and VSA as to Potential \n9  Settlement  \n10  Due to the long history of disruption of the Venice community by this large, \n11  unruly and occasionally dangerous population, prior to the filing of this lawsuit, \n12  VSA had discussions about joining the Alliance. In those discussions, VSA asked \n Jeff Lewis Lawp Valley Drive, Suite 200  Hills Estates, CA 90274 111345    fssoecrtht olaeonml ase.g nTrte heoemf  Atehnlelti  aAthnlaclitea ’ansnc cyeo  nsuuenwist e nfla odcte iblcieltii npeesla dtch teaodt   gmwiviitgeh hittnh  ab2te 0 ad0se sfvueerealton opcfee da tn opy uV rreSsusAiad naetnn tdco e tash  uosr,  \n9 Deeolling  16  while VSA supports many of the Alliance’s causes of action, VSA could not join \n0R\n6\n17  the suit as a co-plaintiff.  \n18  ii. Differences Between the Alliance and VSA as to LAMC 41.18  \n19  Los Angeles Municipal Code section 41.18 prohibits lying, sitting and \n20  sleeping on public rights-of-way. VSA supports amendments to Section 41.18 \n21  proposed by City Councilman Mitchell O'Farrell and the Venice Neighborhood \n22  Council that would be more restrictive regarding minimum distances of the \n23  homeless camping from residences, parks, and schools than is the current city \n24  practice. The Alliance’s lead counsel has advised the VSA that the Alliance does \n25  not support the O’Farrell/VNC amendments. VSA has concerns that any settlement \n26  of this lawsuit may impact the interpretation or enforcement of Section 41.18 in a \n27  manner that does not adequately address the burden that the current city \n28  interpretation of pertinent lawsuits places on Venice residents. \n- 8 - \nEX PARTE APPLICATION \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 66   Filed 04/14/20   Page 9 of 10   Page ID #:890\n \n1  E.  VSA’s Concerns Regarding How Homeless are Housed During \n2  Pandemic \n3   VSA urges the Court to order the city and county of Los Angeles to focus all \n4  temporary housing for the homeless on structures, buildings and single-occupancy \n5  tents, installed off-street, that allow for ample and enforceable self-quarantine. The \n6  City of Los Angeles is currently re-purposing city recreation centers for use as \n7  temporary shelters for the homeless. While the concept of converting recreation \n8  centers to shelters appears appropriate in this crisis, it is contraindicated by the \n9  nature of the population itself. (See Ryavec Decl., ¶¶ 14-20.) \n10   \n11  IV.  VSA Should be Allowed Permissive Intervention \n12  Even if VSA is not entitled to intervene as a matter of right, it should be \n Jeff Lewis Lawp Valley Drive, Suite 200  Hills Estates, CA 90274 111345    aaallclltooiowwnes  dhp aetvorme i naist eqsriuvveees ntiieno tunen rovdfee nlra ttwiho eno  Crw fohauecrntt ’ i“sna  acnuo atmhpomprlioitcyna .np”t u(’rFss ecudlaa.n iRmt t.  ooC rRi vdu.el Pefe .2 n24s4(eb( ab)n,) (dw1 )thh(iBceh )m) .2a in \n9 Deeolling  16  Permissive intervention is in the “broad discretion of the trial court.” VSA \n0R\n6\n17  represents interests in this case that are not otherwise represented insofar as they \n18  represent a different geographic region, Venice, and the renters and homeowners in \n19  Venice have different needs than the business owners in downtown Los Angeles.  \n20  One of the factors to be considered by the court is “whether [the] \n21  part[y] seeking intervention will significantly contribute to full development of the \n22  underlying factual issues.” (GOJO, 2018 WL 5880829, at *9 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 2, \n23  2018). VSA is actively engaged with the community and local officials pertaining \n24  to homeless issues and balancing property rights against the rights of the homeless.  \n25 \n \n26  2 On March 17, 2020, this Court granted intervention to Orange County \nCatholic Worker, the lead plaintiff in Orange County Catholic Worker, et al. v. \n27 \nCounty of Orange, 18-CV-00155-DOC-JDE (“OCCW”). On March 18, 2020, this \nCourt granted intervention by LA CAN and LACW.

Conclusion \n5  Based on the foregoing, VSA respectfully requests that the Court grant the \n6  application. VSA’s president, Mark Ryavec, is available to personally or \n7  telephonically attend any proceedings at the invitation of the Court. \n8   \n9   \nDATED:  April 14, 2020  JEFF LEWIS LAW \n10 \n \n \n11 \n \n12  By:  s/ Jeffrey Lewis\nJeff Lewis Law 9 Deep Valley Drive, Suite 200  olling Hills Estates, CA 90274 11113456        PJS AAeletSafatfioSnrnreO tnCyiCfe .fLy I RVsAe owfETotisNIrstO  aIPCnNr oE p SoTseAdK InEtHerOveLnDorE-RS \n0R\n6\n \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n- 10 - \nEX PARTE APPLICATION ",

INTRODUCTION  \n3\nThis current action, brought by the Los Angeles Alliance for Human Rights \n4\n(“LA Alliance”) an unincorporated association made up primarily of business owners \n5\nin Downtown Los Angeles, seeks to have this court issue orders to compel the City \n6\nand County of Los Angeles to take actions regarding homelessness that could greatly \n7\nimpact the rights of homeless people throughout the City and County, and in \n8\nparticular, the rights of people who currently have no other option but to live outside.  \n9\nAnd yet, there are currently no homeless people who are unsheltered in the case.  \n10\nEven worse, Plaintiffs’ lawsuit seeks both implicitly and explicitly to \n11\ncollaterally attack the settlement in another case, Mitchell v. City of Los Angeles, 16-\n12\nCV-01760-SJO (JPR), which was a lawsuit brought by four homeless individuals and \n13\nProposed Intervenors, Los Angeles Catholic Worker (“LACW”) and Cangress, dba \n14\nLos Angeles Community Action Network (“LA CAN”), (collectively, “Proposed \n15\nIntervenors”) against the City of Los Angeles (“City”) in 2016 to protect the \n16\nconstitutional rights of unhoused people in Skid Row.  That case ended in a \n17\nsettlement that the parties signed in June 2019, which aims to protect unhoused \n18\nresidents of Skid Row from continuing violations of their civil rights, including by 1) \n19\ncreating protocols to ensure that unhoused people’s belongings are not seized and \n20\nthrown away as part of daily street cleanings in Skid Row; 2) establishing minimum \n21\nstandards for notice and storage of belongings so people can retrieve those \n22\nbelongings if they are taken to storage following an arrest or as part of a cleanup; and \n23\n3) establishing additional standards to ensure the City can address issues related to \n24\nADA access, access to buildings, and other issues related to the public rights of way, \n25\nwithout violating unhoused people’s rights (an issue that is all the more critical to LA \n26\nCAN and LA Catholic worker, since many of their members and clients, as well as \n27\nthe individual plaintiffs in Mitchell have significant disabilities).   \n28\n  1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nProposed Intervenor’s Memorandum of Points and Authorities  \nISO Motion to Intervene \n\n \n1 The Plaintiffs in this case previously attempted to intervene in Mitchell v. City \n2 of Los Angeles to invalidate the settlement.  They bring this separate lawsuit to do \n3 what they could not do in Mitchell—use the Court to compel the City and County to \n4 take actions that could contravene unhoused residents’ constitutional rights.  \n5 Proposed Intervenors have a right to intervene in this litigation to protect both their \n6 interests in the Mitchell settlement and to ensure that the interests of their members \n7 and are not threatened as well.   \nII.  BACKGROUND  \n8\na.  Proposed Intervenors  \n9\nProposed Intervenor LA CAN is a grassroots, non-profit organization that has \n10\noperated in Skid Row and throughout Los Angeles for approximately two decades.  \n11\nThe primary purpose of the organization is to organize and empower community \n12\nresidents to work collectively to address systemic poverty and oppression in the \n13\ncommunity.  For example, in 2016, LA CAN was a supporter of Measure HHH and \n14\nsince then, has spent considerable resources working to ensure accountability in the \n15\nspending of Measure HHH funds, including threatening litigation in 2016 to prevent \n16\nthe expenditure of funds on projects that were not authorized by the proposition.   \n17\nSince its founding in 1999, LA CAN has been the only member-driven \n18\norganization in Skid Row whose goal is to protect the rights and prevent the further \n19\ndisenfranchisement of homeless and poor people in Los Angeles.  More than 800 \n20\nlow-income residents of Skid Row are involved with LA CAN.  Many of its members \n21\nare houseless and unsheltered each night on the streets of Los Angeles.  LA CAN \n22\nmoves to intervene in this lawsuit on its own behalf and on behalf of its members \n23\nwho are unsheltered in Skid Row and throughout Los Angeles.   \n24\nProposed Intervenor Los Angeles Catholic Worker, (“LACW”), founded in \n25\n1970, is an unincorporated lay Catholic community of women and men that operate a \n26\nfree soup kitchen, hospitality house for the homeless, hospice care for the dying and \n27\nby-monthly newspaper.  Nicknamed the “Hippie Kitchen,” the facility is located on \n28\n  2 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nProposed Intervenor’s Memorandum of Points and Authorities  \nISO Motion to Intervene \n\n \n1 the Northeast corner of 6th Street and Gladys Avenue in Skid Row.  LACW provides \n2 full meals to the community three times a week.  In furtherance of its mission, the \n3 Hippie Kitchen associates to provide other services, including access to dental care, \n4 over-the-counter medications, podiatry services, toiletries and other personal items.  \n5 In furtherance of its mission, for the past several years, the Hippie Kitchen has \n6 purchased shopping carts to provide them to unsheltered homeless persons to store \n7 and move their personal belongings.   \n8 Both LA CAN and LACW were plaintiffs in Mitchell v. City of Los Angeles,  \n9 along with four homeless individuals who lived on the streets in Skid Row, were \n10 arrested for incredibly minor quality of life offenses or subjected to street cleanings, \n11 and had all of their belongings seized and destroyed or otherwise stored in a location \n12 that was completely inaccessible to them.  The individual plaintiffs in the action, Carl \n13 Mitchell, Judy Coleman, and Salvador Roque, 1 assigned their rights to enforce the \n14 settlement to LA CAN and LACW.  Therefore, Proposed Intervenors bring this \n15 motion to intervene on behalf of themselves, the members of LA CAN, and the \n16 individual plaintiffs in Mitchell.   \n17 b. Factual And Procedural Background  \n18 As this Court well knows, and as the Plaintiffs spell out in their complaint, the \n19 issue of the rights of homeless individuals in Southern California has been the subject \n20 considerable litigation for decades, and most relevant here, for the past 10 years.   \n21 In 2011, the City of Los Angeles was sued by eight unhoused individuals \n22 related to the destruction of their belongings in Skid Row.  Lavan v. City of Los \n23 Angeles, 2:11-cv-02874-PSG-AJW (filed April 5, 2011).  The resulting Preliminary \n24 Injunction issued by Judge Gutierrez, enjoined the City of Los Angeles from seizing \n25 and destroying individuals’ belongings. See Lavan v. City of Los Angeles, 797 \n26 F.Supp.2d 1005 (C.D. Cal. 2011).  The City appealed the injunction to the Ninth \n27\n \n28 1 Michael Escobedo, the fourth individual plaintiff, passed away during the \npendency of the litigation.  \n \n  3 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nProposed Intervenor’s Memorandum of Points and Authorities  \nISO Motion to Intervene \n\n \n1 Circuit, which upheld the injunction.  Lavan v. City of Los Angeles, 693 F.3d 1022, \n2 1033 (9th Cir. 2012).   \n3 Shortly after the Ninth Circuit upheld the injunction, Proposed Intervenors LA \n4 CAN and LA Catholic Worker, along with four unsheltered residents on Skid Row, \n5 sued the Central City East Association and the Downtown Industrial District \n6 Business Improvement District,2 as well as the City of Los Angeles, alleging that the \n7 City and Business Improvement District were colluding to deprive unhoused \n8 residents of their constitutional rights.  See Los Angeles Catholic Worker et al. v. Los \n9 Angeles Downtown Industrial District, et al, CV14-7344 PSG (AJWx).  Specifically, \n10 Plaintiffs alleged that Defendant City of Los Angeles (“City”) provided law \n11 enforcement support and coordination to LADID to assist them in seizing and \n12 destroying property, despite the Court’s preliminary injunction in Lavan to stop these \n13 illegal practices. See Proposed Intervenor’s Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”), ¶1, \n14 Exh. A.   \n15 After three years of litigation, the parties entered into a settlement agreement, \n16 which among other things, prevented the City of Los Angeles from continuing to \n17 collude with the Central City East Association to violate unhoused people’s rights.  \n18 The Los Angeles Police Department was required to issue a special order expressly \n19 instructing LAPD officers not to collude with BID employees to take and destroy \n20 individuals’ belongings, in violation of the injunction issued in Lavan.  Id.  The \n21 settlement remains in effect and the U.S. District Court retains jurisdiction to enforce \n22 the agreement.  Id.   \n23 In 2016, four more homeless individuals and the Proposed Intervenors filed \n24 Mitchell v. City of Los Angeles, which yet again challenged the City’s practice of \n25 seizing and either destroying homeless people’s belongings, or storing seized \n26 belongings in a way that was completely inaccessible to Plaintiffs.  After the Court \n27 granted yet another preliminary injunction against the City of Los Angeles, the \n28  \n \n  4 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nProposed Intervenor’s Memorandum of Points and Authorities  \nISO Motion to Intervene \n\n \n1 parties entered into significant negotiations and finally reached a tentative settlement.  \n2 The approval of the settlement was incredibly contentious, resulting in what was \n3 certainly a significant debate amongst the City Council members during a three hour \n4 closed session and ultimately, an instruction to the City Attorney to settle the case.   \n5 Before the settlement was finalized, the Plaintiffs in this lawsuit, then \n6 operating under the name DTLA Alliance for Human Rights,3 indicated their \n7 intention to intervene in the litigation before the lawsuit was dismissed.  The group \n8 inexplicably failed to do so, and the settlement was finally approved.  Thereafter, the \n9 Court retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement, and the Court dismissed the \n10 case.  (See RJN, ¶2, Exhibit B).  Thereafter, the group filed a motion to intervene, \n11 which was denied as untimely.  LA Alliance filed a notice of appeal, but dropped the \n12 appeal before filing any briefs.  Instead, on the day the group dismissed its appeal, \n13 they filed this instant lawsuit, making the same allegations as those outlined in \n14 Plaintiffs’ Motion to Intervene and as discussed below, seeking in part to invalidate \n15 the settlement agreement in Mitchell.  \nIII.  PROPOSED INTERVENORS ARE ENTITLED TO INTERVENE \n16\nAS A MATTER OF RIGHT \n17\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 24(a) provides that a party “who claims an \n18\ninterest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is \n19\nso situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the \n20\nmovant's ability to protect its interest” must be allowed to intervene in a case “unless \n21\nexisting parties adequately represent that interest.” Fed. R. of Civ. Proc. 24(a)(2). \n22\nTo be granted intervention as a matter of right, Proposed Intervenors must \n23\ndemonstrate that 1) they have a “significant protectable interest” relating to the \n24\nmatter that is the subject of the action; 2) a decision in the action may, as a practical \n25\nmatter, impair or impede Proposed Intervenors’ ability to protect its interest; 3) the \n26\nrequest to intervene is timely; and 4) the existing parties may not adequately \n27\n28  \n3 See https://www.la-alliance.org/press.  \n  5 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nProposed Intervenor’s Memorandum of Points and Authorities  \nISO Motion to Intervene \n\n \n1 represent proposed Intervenors’ interest.  Donnelly v. Glickman, 159 F.3d 405, 409 \n2 (9th Cir. 1998).  “Though the applicant bears the burden of establishing these \n3 elements, we have repeatedly instructed that ‘the requirements for intervention are [to \n4 be] broadly interpreted in favor of intervention.’”  Smith v. Los Angeles Unified \n5 School District, 830 F.3d 843, 853 (9th Cir. 2016). Proposed Intervenors easily \n6 satisfy each of these prongs. \n7 a.  Proposed Intervenors have a Significant Protectable Interest in \n8 This Litigation   \n9 Proposed Intervenors have a significant protectable interest in this litigation.  \n10 Rule 24(a) does not require that the protectable interest at stake in the litigation be a \n11 specific legal or equitable interest.  “The ‘interest’ test is not a clear-cut or bright-line \n12 rule, because no specific legal or equitable interest need be established. Instead, the \n13 ‘interest’ test directs courts to make a practical, threshold inquiry, and is primarily a \n14 practical guide to disposing of lawsuits by involving as many apparently concerned \n15 persons as is compatible with efficiency and due process.  In re Estate of Ferdinand \n16 E. Marcos Human Rights Litigation, 536 F.3d 980, 984–85 (9th Cir. 2008)( quoting S. \n17 Cal. Edison Co. v. Lynch, 307 F.3d 794, 802 (9th Cir.2002).   \n18   Proposed Intervenors have a legally protectable interest in the settlement in \n19 Mitchell v. City of Los Angeles, which Plaintiffs explicitly and implicitly challenge in \n20 this lawsuit.  Plaintiffs allege in the seventh cause of action that the settlement in \n21 Mitchell was a project under CEQA, for which an environmental review was \n22 required.  See Comp. ¶ 165.  The eleventh cause of action challenges the settlement \n23 on due process and equal protection grounds, namely that the settlement \n24 distinguished between Skid Row and the rest of the City without a rational reason for \n25 doing so.  In addition to those causes of action that explicitly mention the Mitchell \n26 settlement, other causes of action, including the first, third through fourth, and \n27 seventh causes of action for negligence, nuisance, and violations of substantive due \n28 process, relate to conditions in Skid Row that Plaintiffs allege throughout the \n  6 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nProposed Intervenor’s Memorandum of Points and Authorities  \nISO Motion to Intervene \n\n \n1 complaint were caused by the Mitchell injunction and settlement.   See e.g., Comp. ¶¶ \n2 30, 37, 48; Comp. Pg. 47. 4 \n3 b. A Decision in this Action May Impair Intervenors’ Ability to \n4 Protect their Interests  \n5 To satisfy the second prong of the test for intervention as a matter of right, \n6 Plaintiffs must show that “the disposition of this case will, as a practical matter, \n7 affect” the interest at stake.  California ex rel Lockyer v. U.S., 450 F.3d 436, 442 (9th \n8 Cir. 2006).  Again, as with all of the factors, the proposed intervenors “need not \n9 demonstrate that their interest would be impaired in a legal sense, only that their \n10 interest ‘would be substantially affected in a practical sense.”  Sw. Ctf. for Biological \n11 Diversity v. Berg, 268 F.3d 810, 822 (9th Cir.) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 24, Advisory \n12 Committee Notes).   \n13 Here, the remedy sought by the Plaintiffs could have the effect of undermining or \n14 even invalidating Proposed Intervenors’ settlement with the City of Los Angeles.  \n15 Indeed, Plaintiffs are seeking to do so here, just Plaintiffs explicitly sought to do \n16 when they moved to intervene in the Mitchell, and they intended to object to and \n17 ultimately aimed to invalidate the settlement.  This is a more than sufficient showing \n18 for intervention.  See e.g., Idaho Farm Bureau Fed. v. Babbit, 58 F.3d 1392, 1398 \n19 (1995) (decision in another case that could result in a legal decision undermining the \n20 result of another case is sufficient showing of impairment to support intervention). In \n21\n \n22\n4 Proposed Intervenors also have legally protected interests stemming from \nadvocacy to pass and subsequently to protect the integrity of Measure HHH, see\n23  \nWashington State Building & Construction Trades v. Spellman, 684 F.2d 627 (9th \n24\nCir. 982), as well as on behalf of their members, who have a protectable interest to \n25 be free from increased enforcement and the violation of their constitutional rights.  \nAlthough less concrete than the right to protect their settlement, Courts have \n26\nrecognized these as sufficient interests to support intervention, particularly where, \n27 as here, there is no other representation of unsheltered homeless people in Los \nAngeles, who are most likely to be impacted by any proposed remedies in this \n28\ncase.  \n \n  7 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nProposed Intervenor’s Memorandum of Points and Authorities  \nISO Motion to Intervene \n\n \n1 addition, however, the settlement could also result in orders related to the \n2 expenditures of Measure HHH funds and changes in the allocation of resources, as \n3 well as the increased criminalization and enforcement of laws against LA CAN’s \n4 members. All of these potential outcomes, contemplated by the sweeping complaint \n5 filed by Plaintiffs, could impact Proposed Intervenors’ rights.  See Sagebrush \n6 Rebellion, Inc. v. Watt, 713 F.2d 525, 526-27 (1983) (finding a right to intervene \n7 when an adverse decision in the suit would impair the intervenor’s interest in the \n8 preservation of birds and their habitats); Washington State Building & Construction \n9 Trades v. Spellman, 684 F.2d 627 (9th Cir. 982) (public interest group entitled as a \n10 matter of right to intervene in an action challenging the legality of a measure which it \n11 had supported).  There is more than enough potential to impair LA CAN and \n12 LACW’s rights, that they should be allowed to intervene in this case.   \n13 c.  The Request is Timely \n14   There should be no dispute that Proposed Intervenors’ motion is timely. A \n15 motion made “at an early stage of the proceedings” will generally satisfy the \n16 timeliness requirement. See Citizens for Balanced Use v. Mont.Wilderness Ass’n, 647 \n17 F.3d 893, 897 (9th Cir. 2011).   In fact, Proposed Intervenors could hardly have \n18 moved faster to intervene.  This case was filed on March 10, 2020, only eight days \n19 before Proposed Intervenors move to intervene, before even Defendants have \n20 appeared in this case.  Proposed Intervenors moved ex parte, in order to intervene \n21 before the first hearing in this case, which has been set for just three days after this \n22 Court accepted the transfer of the case, in order to address emergency issues related \n23 to the Coronavirus.  Proposed Intervenors’ motion is therefore timely.  See Idaho \n24 Farm Bureau Fed. v. Babbitt, 58 F.3d 1392, 1397 (9th Cir. 1995) (intervention timely \n25 when applicant moved to intervene prior to hearing on a preliminary injunction \n26 motion, before any hearings or rulings on substantive matters).   \n27 // \n28 // \n  8 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nProposed Intervenor’s Memorandum of Points and Authorities  \nISO Motion to Intervene \n\n \n1 d. Existing Parties May Not Represent Proposed Intervenors’ \n2 Interests \n3 Finally, the parties in this case simply cannot adequately represent the \n4 Proposed Intervenors’ interests.  Whether  another  party’s representation of \n5 Applicants’ interests is adequate depends on: “(1) whether the interest of a present \n6 party is such that it will undoubtedly make all of a proposed intervenor’s arguments; \n7 (2) whether the present party is capable and willing to make such arguments; and (3) \n8 whether a proposed intervenor would offer any necessary elements to the proceeding \n9 that other parties would neglect.” Arakaki v. Cayetano, 324 F.3d 1078, 1086 (9th Cir. \n10 2003).   The burden to show that a party’s interests may not be adequately \n11 represented is minor:  “The requirement of the Rule is satisfied if the applicant shows \n12 that representation of his interest ‘may be’ inadequate; and the burden of making that \n13 showing should be treated as minimal.  Trbovich v. United Mine Workers of America, \n14 404 U.S. 528, 538 (1972).   \n15 When the government is a party, the standard to demonstrate that the proposed \n16 intervenor’s interest are not adequately represented has sometimes been held to be \n17 higher. See e.g., Arakaki, 324 F.3d at 1086.  However, where as here, the government \n18 is antagonistic to the proposed intervenors or proposed intervenors have a discrete \n19 and particularized interest, the higher standard does not apply. See Coal. of \n20 Arizona/New Mexico Counties for Stable Economic Growth v. Dept. of Interior, 100 \n21 F.3d 837, 844–45 (10th Cir. 1996) (“An applicant may fulfill this burden by showing \n22 collusion between the representative and an opposing party, that the representative \n23 has an interest adverse to the applicant, or that the representative failed in fulfilling \n24 his duty to represent the applicant's interest.”); see also Idaho Farm Bureau Fed., 58 \n25 F.3d at 1398 (9th Cir. 1995) (government agency unlikely to make strong arguments \n26 in support of its actions because it took those actions largely to fulfill a settlement \n27 agreement).   \n28    In this case, none of the parties can adequately represent Proposed Intervenors’ \n  9 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nProposed Intervenor’s Memorandum of Points and Authorities  \nISO Motion to Intervene \n\n \n1 interests. First, with regards to the City, LA CAN and LACW have been directly \n2 adverse to the City in two lawsuits directly related to the issues in this case.5  In the \n3 first lawsuit, LA Catholic Worker v. LADID, Plaintiffs accused the City of colluding \n4 with the Central City East Association and the Los Angeles Downtown Industrial \n5 District, which is the business improvement district in Skid Row.  Although CCEA is \n6 not technically a plaintiff in this case, LA Alliance is intimately intertwined with \n7 CCEA.6  See Coalition of Arizona/New Mexico Cnties for Stable Economic Growth \n8 100 F.3d at 844–45.  With regards to the actions to undermine the Mitchell \n9 settlement, even though the parties reached a stipulated settlement, the settlement \n10 came only after a hotly contested Preliminary Injunction, in which the City sought to \n11 overturn the injunction.  And as Plaintiffs note in their complaint, the City of Los \n12 Angeles continues to strenuously fight to prevent the protections secured in the \n13 Mitchell settlement from being implemented City-wide.  See Garcia v. City of Los \n14 Angeles, 2:19-cv-06182-DSF-PLA.  Therefore, “there is reason to doubt that the \n15\n16  \n5 To say nothing of the numerous other cases in which the City has been \n17\nadverse to houseless residents who have brought suit to protect their civil rights, \n18 but which the Proposed Intervenors were not plaintiffs, including most notably, \nJones v. City of Los Angeles, 444 F.3d 1118 (9th Cir. 2006), vacated, 505 F.3d \n19\n1006 (9th Cir. 2007) and Lavan, 693 F.3d 1022, 1033 (9th Cir. 2012).  See also \n20 Garcia v. City of Los Angeles, 2:19-cv-06182-DSF-PLA.\n \n21 6 Four of CCEA/LADID’s eleven board members appear in the pleadings in \nthis case.  See http://www.centralcityeast.org/about (last accessed on March 18, \n22\n2020), including Mark Shinbane, the chair of CCEA, Compl. p. 46; Larry Rausch, \nthe past chair of CCEA and current member of the board, Comp., p. 48; Bob \n23\nSmiland, who serves on the CCEA and LADID Board, and Andrew Bales, who is \n24\nalso on the CCEA board and runs the Union Rescue Mission, which employs or \n25 houses a number of the individuals involved in the litigation, see e.g., Charles \nMalow, who lives at the Union Rescue Mission, Comp. ¶ 97. In addition the group \n26\nis chaired by Don Steir, the “longtime general counsel of the Central City East \n27 Association.”  See LA Alliance, “Frequently Asked Questions,” available at  \nhttps://www.la-alliance.org/faqs; see also LA Alliance Go Fund Me Fundraising \n28\nAccount, https://www.gofundme.com/f/la-alliance-for-human-rights.  \n \n  10 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nProposed Intervenor’s Memorandum of Points and Authorities  \nISO Motion to Intervene \n\n \n1 [City] would fully protect the interests” of the Proposed Intervenors, and instead \n2 would seek to undermine the Mitchell settlement.  County of Fresno v. Andrus, 622 \n3 F.2d 436, 439 (9th Cir.1980); see also Citizens for Balanced Use, 647 F.3d 893, 900 \n4 (9th Cir. 2011); Idaho Farm Bureau Fed., 58 F.3d at 1398.   \n5   Nor can Proposed Intervenors rely on any of the parties in the case to make the \n6 same arguments Proposed Intervenors will make.  Although much of the arguments \n7 and remedies ostensibly sought by Plaintiffs could or in some instances, must rely on \n8 Martin v. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584 (9th Cir. 2019).  But all of the parties have \n9 demonstrated hostility towards or a desire to overturn it.  See RJN, ¶ 4, Brief Amicus \n10 Curiae of City of Los Angeles; RJN, ¶ 5, Brief for Amici Curiae California State \n11 Association of Counties and 33 California Counties and Cities; RJN, ¶ 6, Brief of \n12 Amicus Curiae International Downtown Association, California Downtown \n13 Association, Central City East Association of Los Angeles, Hollywood Property, \n14 Owners’ Alliance, Historic Business Improvement District, Property Owners \n15 Association, and Downtown Property Owner/  Association in Support of Petitioner.  \n16 This alone is sufficient to demonstrate the parties will not adequately protect \n17 Proposed Intervenors.    \n18 Finally, “[t]he ‘most important factor’ in assessing the adequacy of \n19 representation is ‘how the interest compares with the interests of existing parties.’” \n20 Citizens for Balanced Use, 647 F.3d at 898 (quoting Arakaki, 324 F.3d at 1086).  In \n21 this case, the LA Alliance brings a sweeping lawsuit to address homelessness in Los \n22 Angeles, including purporting to seek an affirmative right to shelter for individuals \n23 who are currently have no other option but to sleep on the sidewalks in Los Angeles.  \n24 Yet not a single identified member of its organization or individual plaintiff is \n25 currently unsheltered.  In contrast, the LA CAN seeks to intervene on behalf of its \n26 members, many of whom are homeless, and both LACW and LA CAN seek to \n27 protect the interests of individual plaintiffs in Mitchell who assigned their rights to \n28 enforce the settlement to LACW and LA CAN, and therefore, the Proposed \n  11 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nProposed Intervenor’s Memorandum of Points and Authorities  \nISO Motion to Intervene \n\n \n1 Intervenors seek to protect their interests as well.7  The interests of unhoused \n2 residents are distinct from the business owners in Skid Row, many of whom \n3 represent an organization that has been sued for violating unhoused people’s rights, \n4 and the interests of the City and County of Los Angeles, both of which have been \n5 sued for the same reason.  \n6   Plaintiffs easily show they have a protectable interest that could be affected by \n7 the resolution in this case, that they were timely in seeking to intervene, and that none \n8 of the parties can protect their interests.   As such, Proposed Intervenors are entitled \n9 to intervene as a matter of right.  \nIV.  LA CAN AND LACW SHOULD BE ALLOWED PERMISSIVE \n10\nINTERVENTION  \n11\nEven if Proposed Intervenors were not entitled to intervene as a matter of right, \n12\nthey should be allowed to intervene under the Court’s authority pursuant to Rule \n13\n24(b), which allows permissive intervention when “an applicant’s claim or defense \n14\nand the main action have a question of law or fact in common.” Fed. R. Civ. P. \n15\n24(b)(1)(B).8  Permissive intervention is in the “broad discretion of the trial court.” \n16\n \n17\nOn March 17, 2020, this Court granted intervention to Orange County \n7 \n18\nCatholic Worker, the lead plaintiff in Orange County Catholic Worker, et al. v. \nCounty of Orange, 18-CV-00155-DOC-JDE (“OCCW”). Intervenor sought to \n19\nintervene based on Plaintiffs’ representations regarding the effect of this litigation \n20\non the consent decree issued by this Court.  OCCW represents the interests \n21 unhoused residents in Orange County and seek to protect their consent decree in a \nrelated action.  While this perspective is critically important to this litigation and \n22\nOCCW complements the perspectives and interests of LACW and LA CAN, their  \n23 interests are distinct from those of Proposed Intervenors, who operate in and whose \nmembers live in Skid Row and throughout Los Angeles.   \n24\n8The other factors for permissive intervention are 1) the intervention is \n25\ntimely, which Proposed Intervenors easily demonstrate, see supra Section 3(c), and \n26 2) the standing to assert the interests claimed. GOJO, 2018 WL 5880829,  at *3. \nWhile the applicant must show that the court has jurisdiction, Venegas v. Skaggs, \n27\n867 F.2d 527, 529 (9th Cir. 1989), aff'd sub nom. Venegas v. Mitchell, 495 U.S. 82 \n28 (1990), there is no need to independently prove standing.  The court has the \n \n  12 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nProposed Intervenor’s Memorandum of Points and Authorities  \nISO Motion to Intervene \n\n \n1 GOJO Indus., Inc. v. Barough, (“GOJO”), No. SACV171382DOCJDEX, 2018 WL \n2 5880829, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 2, 2018). LACAN and LACW represent important \n3 interests in this case that are otherwise not represented and as such, should be \n4 allowed to permissively intervene.   \n5 The Plaintiffs’ argument raises many common questions of fact with the \n6 Mitchell case, as discussed above.  They allege that requiring due process for \n7 property in Skid Row causes “health and safety risks”.  Compl. ¶¶ 29-30.  They also \n8 discuss at length how the Mitchell settlement purportedly caused those risks. \n9 One of the factors to be considered by the court is whether “whether [the] \n10 part[y] seeking intervention will significantly contribute to full development of the \n11 underlying factual issues.”  GOJO, 2018 WL 5880829, at *9 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 2, \n12 2018).  As noted above, none of the parties currently in the case, include any \n13 individual who is currently unsheltered in Los Angeles.  On the other hand, LA CAN \n14 and LACW have members and clients who live on the streets.  These perspectives are \n15 critical to a case that seeks as broad of remedies as Plaintiffs purport to seek, it is \n16 unimaginable how the case could go forward without the participation of an \n17 organization that includes unsheltered homeless individuals amongst its members.  \n18 Moreover, organizers and staff of LA CAN and LACW monitor what is happening \n19 on the streets, not just in Skid Row, but throughout Los Angeles. For example, the \n20 complaint alleges that the encampment under the overpass at Venice and the 405 is \n21\n \n22\ndiscretion to permit LACAN and LACW to intervene at this point in the lawsuit \nregardless of whether they have standing. Bond v. Utreras, 585 F.3d 1061, 1070 \n23\n(7th Cir. 2009); Providence Baptist Church v. Hillandale Comm. Ltd., 425 F.3d \n24\n309, 315 (6th Cir.2005).  Notwithstanding that it is unnecessary, Plaintiffs LACAN \n25 and LACW both would have independent grounds for jurisdiction because \nLACAN is a membership organization with unhoused members and LACW diverts \n26\nits resources when its unhoused guests and neighbors are treated unlawfully or \n27 criminalized by the City.  LACW expends resources it could be using to feed the \nhomeless to monitor the situation regarding property seizure.  Thus, both proposed \n28\nintervenors have standing.\n \n  13 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nProposed Intervenor’s Memorandum of Points and Authorities  \nISO Motion to Intervene \n\n \n1 blocking the sidewalk.  LA CAN has organizers and members that regularly visit that \n2 encampment and are familiar with the conditions there.  The sweeps and property \n3 seizures at the overpass at Venice and the 405 divert LA CAN’s resources; yet this \n4 lawsuit is alleging the need for increased sweeps and enforcement. Complaint at 177.   \n5 Similarly, LA CAN, as mentioned above, has unhoused members that reside \n6 on Skid Row and would be impacted by increased sweeps and enforcement. Not only \n7 are their interests affected, their participation will aid the court in determining the \n8 factual context of the litigation and in proving or disproving the parties’ statements \n9 about accessibility and state-created danger.  It will also aid the court to hear from \n10 un-sheltered individuals, as the only unhoused individual represented by Plaintiffs \n11 was sheltered prior to the lawsuit beginning. \n12 At this stage of the litigation, the court has the discretion to allow LA CAN \n13 and LACW to intervene in the lawsuit as permissive intervenors. \n14  \nDated: March 18, 2020       Respectfully submitted,  \n15\n            Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles  \n16  \n              /s/ Shayla Myers          \n17\n            Attorneys for Proposed Intervenors \n \n18\n \n19\nSchonbrun Seplow Harris & Hoffman LLP  \n20\n \n21               /s/Catherine Sweetser    \n22             Attorneys for Proposed Intervenors \n23  \nLaw Office of Carol A.

INTRODUCTION\nThis  action  involves  a  lawsuit  brought  primarily  by  business  owners  in\n3\ndowntown Los Angeles, who seek to have this Court issue orders to compel the City\n4\nand County of Los Angeles to take action against unhoused persons that, in many\n5\ninstances, contravenes existing judicial decisions involving the City of Los Angeles. \n6\nThe case was initially assigned to the Honorable Steven Wilson in the Central\n7\nDistrict - Western Division.  On March 11, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Related\n8\nCase. [Doc. 10], asserting that this matter is related to Orange County Catholic\n9\nWorker, et al. v. County of Orange, Case No. 18-CV-00155-DOC-JDE (\"OCCW\"). \n10\nThe Orange County Catholic Worker, the organizational plaintiff in the related\n11\ncase, now moves to intervene in this action.  Intervention is mandatory as the cases\n12\ninvolve related issues and an adverse determination in LA Alliance could directly and\n13\nadversely impact the unhoused individuals are represented by the Catholic Worker. \n14\nI. A  DETERMINATION  IN  LA  ALLIANCE  WILL  POTENTIALLY\nAFFECT THE CONSENT DECREE IN OCCW\n15\n \nThere are two reasons to grant intervention to OCCW in this action.  The first\n16\nreason to grant intervention is, as Plaintiffs argued in their Notice of Related Case,\n17\nthe  two  actions  involve  the  \"[d]etermination  of  the  [s]ame  or  [s]ubstantially\n18 [i]dentical [q]uestions of []aw.\"  Notice of Related Case at p. 2.\n19\nIn Orange County Catholic Worker et al v. County of Orange, et al, Case\n20 No.  18-CV-00155-DOC-JDE,  Judge  Carter  has  made  specific\ndeterminations of law surrounding the issue of sufficiency of shelter\n21 needed for those experiencing homelessness, including as required\nunder the Ninth Circuit opinion issued in Martin v. City of Boise, 920\n22 F.3d 584 (9th Cir. 2019), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 674 (2019). This case\ninvolves substantially the same issue, and plaintiffs anticipate similar or\n23 identical legal issues will be submitted to the Court for determination. \n24 Id. \nThe second reason to grant intervention was also advanced in the Notice of\n25\nRelated Case.  As Plaintiff LA Alliance states, the County of Los Angeles is named\n26\nas a defendant in this action.  LA Alliance recognizes that any action involving the\n27\nCounty may impact all 88 incorporated municipalities within the County, one of\n28\n3\n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 16   Filed 03/17/20   Page 4 of 7   Page ID #:134\n1 which is already a party to the consent decree in OCCW over which this Court already\n2 has continuing jurisdiction by agreement of the parties in OCCW. \nAdditionally, the County of Los Angeles is a defendant in this\n3\ncase, and any legal issues decided herein, or any agreement entered into,\nwould  necessarily  affect  all  88  cities  within  Los  Angeles  County\n4\nbecause i) the County has a continuing obligation to provide support\nservices  to  indigent  persons  including  and  in  particular  those\n5\nexperiencing homelessness, and ii) plaintiffs argue for the County's\nobligation to provide shelter beds in a more comprehensive manner\n6\naffecting all 88 cities within its jurisdiction. On September 23, 2019,\nplaintiffs in Orange County Catholic Worker filed a motion to file a\n7\nsupplemental complaint against the city of Bellflower [Docket No. 339];\nthat same day, plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement and settlement\n8\nagreement with the City of Bellflower [Docket No. 341]. On October 7,\n2019  the  Court  granted  plaintiffs'  motion  to  file  the  supplemental\n9\ncomplaint [Docket No. 351] and signed the settlement order [Docket No.\n355]. The city of Bellflower is within the County of Los Angeles;\n10\ntherefore, any substantive order or agreement occurring in this case\nwould necessarily affect the city of Bellflower and potentially the\n11\nsettlement  reached  in  the  Orange  County  Catholic  Worker  case.\nMoreover, upon information and belief, several other cities with the\n12\nCounty of Los Angeles are considering a similar path as Bellflower and\nvoluntarily entering into a pre-filing or concurrent-filing settlement with\n13\nplaintiffs in Orange County Catholic Worker, and this case would affect\nthose cities and settlements similarly. Finally, the parties in this case\n14\nanticipate a potential amended complaint or crossclaim against other\ncities within Los Angeles County which could include Bellflower and\n15\nother cities in current negotiations.  \n16\nId. at pp. 2-3. \n17\nTo illustrate why LA Alliance believes these two actions are necessarily\n18\nrelated,  their counsel raises the issue of potentially “inconsistent rulings on crucial\n19\nissues, such as the sufficiency of number of beds needed to resume enforcement of\n20\ncertain quality of life laws under Martin v. City of Boise[.]”   Both Jones v. City of\n21 Los Angeles, 444 F.3d 1118 (9th Cir. 2006) (vacatur issued following settlement), and\n22 then Martin v City of Boise,  902 F.3d 1031  (9th Cir. 2019), were central to the\n23 OCCW litigation on the issue of what constitutes an appropriate “indoor” shelter bed\n24 that would override the Eighth Amendment claim of unhoused persons. \n25 II. THE CATHOLIC WORKER IS ENTITLED TO INTERVENTION AS\nA MATTER OF RIGHT \n26\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 24(a) provides that a a party “who claims an\n27\ninterest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is\n28\n4\n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 16   Filed 03/17/20   Page 5 of 7   Page ID #:135\n1 so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the\n2 movant's ability to protect its interest” must be allowed to intervene in a case “unless\nexisting parties adequately represent that interest.”  Fed. R. of Civ. Proc. 24(a)(2). \n3\nTo be granted intervention as a matter of right, OCCW must demonstrate that\n4\n1) it has a “significant protectable interest” relating to the matter that is the subject\n5\nof the action; 2), a decision in the action may, as a practical matter, impair or impede\n6\nOCCW’s ability to protect its interest; 3) the request to intervene is timely; and 4) the\n7\nexisting  parties  may  not  adequately  represent  OCCW’s  interest.    Donnelly  v.\n8\nGlickman, 159 F.3d 405, 409 (9th Cir. 1998).  OCCW’s application satisfies each of\n9\nthese prongs of the test for intervention as of right. \n10\nRule 24(a) does not require a specific legal or equitable interest. Instead, “the\n11\n‘interest’ test is primarily a practical guide to disposing of lawsuits by involving as\n12\nmany  apparently  concerned  persons  as  is  compatible  with  efficiency  and  due\n13\nprocess.” Cty. of Fresno v. Andrus, 622 F.2d 436, 438 (9th Cir. 1980) (internal\n14\ncitation omitted).  An interest is sufficient if resolution of a plaintiff’s claims\n15\n“actually will affect the applicant.” United States v. City of Los Angeles, 288 F.3d\n16 391, 398-99 (9th Cir. 2002). While “no specific legal or equitable interest need be\n17 established, ... [n]evertheless, the movant must demonstrate a significantly protectable\n18 interest.” Greene v. U.S., 996 F.2d 973, 976 (9th Cir. 1993) (citations omitted).   \n19 As noted by LA Alliance, at the heart of their case is the question of what\n20 meets the requirements of Martin, to have adequate appropriate shelter.  This question\nis central to the consent decree in OCCW with the County and municipal defendants\n21\nin the OCCW action. The consent decrees provide that no enforcement of anti-\n22\ncamping and similar quality of life violations may occur unless and until there is\n23\nappropriate alternative indoor facilities available equal to, or greater than, 60% of the\n24\nunhoused population in the defendant entity as determined by the most recent Point-\n25\nin-time count.  This is a “significant protectable interest” on behalf of OCCW,\n26\nsatisfying the first element of the intervention by right test.  \n27\nTo satisfy the third element of the test for intervention as of right, “[a]pplicants\n28\n5\n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 16   Filed 03/17/20   Page 6 of 7   Page ID #:136\n1 need not demonstrate that their interests would be impaired in a legal sense, only that\n2 their interests “would be substantially affected in a practical sense.” Sw. Ctr. for\nBiological Diversity, 268 F.3d   , at 822 (9th Cir.    ) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 24\n3\nadvisory committee’s note).  As Plaintiffs’ Notice of Related Case underscores, a\n4\ndecision by the Court in this action could directly “impair or impede” intervenor\n5\nOCCW’s “ability to protect its interest” because a different and potentially less\n6\nfavorable resolution for unhoused persons in this action would undermine the consent\n7\ndecree in OCCW and would likely cause the defendants in that action to seek to\n8\nreopen those agreements.  On this basis, the second element of the test is met.  \n9\nThe request to intervene is timely.  It is made only two days after this Court\n10\nagreed to the transfer of this matter as a related case and before the defendants in LA\n11\nAlliance have appeared.  Timeliness is measured by three factors: “(1) the stage of the\n12\nproceeding at which an applicant seeks to intervene; (2) the prejudice to other parties;\n13\nand (3) the reason for and length of the delay,” if any. United States v. Alisal Water\n14\nCorp., 370 F.3d 915, 921 (9th Cir. 2004) (internal citation omitted).  A motion made\n15\n“at an early stage of the proceedings” will usually meet the timeliness element.  See\n16 Citizens for Balanced Use v. Mont. Wilderness Ass’n, 647 F.3d 893, 897 (9th Cir.\n17 2011) (motion to intervene timely “less than three months after complaint was filed\n18 and less than two weeks after the answer was filed”).\n19 Finally, intervention is necessary because there is no party that will represent\n20 the interests of OCCW and the unhoused persons it represents.  “[T]he burden of\nmaking that showing should be treated as minimal.”  Trbovich v. United Mine\n21\nWorkers  of  Am.,  404  U.S.  528,  538  n.10  (1972).  Whether  another  party’s\n22\nrepresentation of Applicants’ interests is adequate depends on: “(1) whether the\n23\ninterest of a present party is such that it will undoubtedly make all of a proposed\n24\nintervenor’s arguments; (2) whether the present party is capable and willing to make\n25\nsuch arguments; and (3) whether a proposed intervenor would offer any necessary\n26\nelements to the proceeding that other parties would neglect.” Arakaki v. Cayetano,\n27\n324 F.3d 1078, 1086 (9th Cir. 2003).  “The ‘most important factor’ in assessing the\n28\n6\n\nCase 2:20-cv-02291-DOC-KES   Document 16   Filed 03/17/20   Page 7 of 7   Page ID #:137\n1 adequacy of representation is ‘how the interest compares with the interests of existing\n2 parties.’”  Citizens for Balanced Use v. Mont. Wilderness Ass'n, 647 F.3d 893, 898\n(quoting Arakaki, 324 F.3d at 1086).\n3\nNo existing party will adequately represent the interests of OCCW in this\n4\ninstance.  No party to this action will vigorously defend the constitutional and\n5\nstatutory rights of unhoused persons.1  The plaintiffs in LA Alliance bring this action\n6\nafter a failed attempt to intervene in Mitchell v. City of Los Angeles, Case No.\n7\n2:16-cv-01750-SJO-JPR and overturn key elements in the permanent injunction\n8\napproved by the Honorable S. James Otero and agreed to by the parties to protect the\n9\nproperty interests of unhoused persons.  The defendant City opposed the interests of\n10\nunhoused persons in multiple actions against the City, including the Jones case,\n11\nraising the constitutional rights of unhoused persons left with no alternative but to\n12\nreside on the sidewalks because of the lack of available housing, including shelter. \n13\nIII. CONCLUSION\n14\nBecause the instant action threatens to impact the consent decree in OCCW,\n15\nintervention should be granted.  At minimum, intervention should be granted for the\n16 March 19, 2020 conference as the matters likely to be discussed are at the core of the\n17 consent decree in OCCW.  \n18\nDated: March 17, 2020\n19\nRespectfully submitted,\n20\nELDER LAW & DISABILITY RIGHTS CENTER\n21 LAW OFFICE OF CAROL A.

To establish an ADA violation, a plaintiff must show \nthat “1) she is a qualified individual with a disability; 2) she was excluded from participation in or otherwise \ndiscriminated against with regard to a public entity’s services, programs, or activities, and 3) such exclusion or \ndiscrimination was by reason of her disability.” Lovell v. Chandler, 303 F.3d 1039, 1052 (9th Cir. 2002). Mental illness \nand addiction constitute disabilities within the bounds of the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12102; Crumbaker v. McLean County, \nKy., 37 F. App’x 784, 785 (6th Cir. 2002) (“A person addicted to illegal drugs is considered disabled within the \nmeaning of the ADA if the drug addiction ‘substantially limits one or more of the major life activities’ of that person.’ \n”). While the Court is sympathetic to Plaintiffs’ argument that the City has created dangerous conditions in Skid Row \nfor those suffering from mental illness or addiction, these actions do not constitute exclusion or discrimination with \nregard to public services as required to find an ADA violation. Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiffs are unlikely to \nsucceed on an ADA claim under this theory. \n \n484  See Benjamin Oreskes & David Zahniser, L.A.
