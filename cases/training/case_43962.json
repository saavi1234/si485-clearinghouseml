    "summary": "<p>This action was brought in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on February 16, 1972, to try to stop the construction of the Century Freeway, also known as I-105, in Los Angeles. Private homeowners who were set to be displaced by the construction and several advocacy organizations, including the Sierra Club, the Environmental Defense Fund, and the NAACP, sued various state and federal agencies and officials and alleged violations of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the California Environmental Quality Act of 1970, the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968, and the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970. They sought injunctive relief to halt construction of the freeway until the defendants complied with state and federal environmental, civil rights, and housing laws to provide replacement housing for displaced residents without discrimination based on race or socioeconomic status and to include public participation in hearings regarding the project. The case was assigned to Judge Harry Pregerson.</p>\r\n<p>On July 7, 1972, the district court issued a preliminary injunction which prohibited further work on the freeway until federal and state officials complied with environmental and relocation assistance statutes. 352 F. Supp. 1324. The Ninth Circuit upheld the preliminary injunction on September 27, 1974. 506 F.2d 696. The United States Supreme Court denied certiorari on January 27, 1975.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After years of negotiations and the completion of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), the parties entered into a consent decree which established the Century Freeway Housing Program to replace 4,200 homes that would be lost during construction. The decree also set local hiring, job training, and contracting goals which were to be overseen by the Century Freeway Affirmative Action Committee and the Office of the Advocate for Corridor Residents. The district court approved the consent decree in October 1979, which dissolved the preliminary injunction and permitted further work on the freeway as proposed in the EIS. Under the consent decree, the court retained jurisdiction until it entered a judgment of dismissal upon the parties&rsquo; compliance with the decree&rsquo;s terms.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed for attorneys fees and costs, which the district court granted in the amounts of $2,204,534.99 and $24,778.12 on March 31, 1980. 501 F. Supp. 403. The consent decree was amended and approved by the district court on September 22, 1981.</p>\r\n<p>In 1995, the consent decree was further amended to privatize the housing replacement program and establish the new Century Housing Corporation, which was the first conversion of a state agency to an independent nonprofit corporation in California. The replenishment program produced 5,700 affordable homes over 14 years and managed programs related to education, job training and employment, child development, senior wellness, and homeless veterans services.</p>\r\n<p>In July 1996, the plaintiffs filed for injunctive relief to prevent the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) from issuing permits that would allow an advertiser to place billboards along I-105 on the grounds that the consent decree required the highway to be a &ldquo;landscaped freeway.&rdquo; Caltrans did not oppose the motion, which Judge Pregerson granted on October 2, 1996. 965 F.Supp. 1337. The advertiser appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which reversed on July 9, 1997 on the grounds that the consent decree could not override valid state law regulating outdoor advertising. 118 F.3d 1386.</p>\r\n<p>On April 10, 1997, District Court Judge Dean D. Pregerson granted Century Housing&rsquo;s motion to modify the consent decree to, among other things, expand the geographic area within which Century Housing could produce affordable housing. The court denied the plantiffs&rsquo; cross-motion for modifications, including the establishment of an ombudsperson, on the grounds that the proposed changes would preserve constraints formerly binding state administration of the program, which was no longer appropriate under private administration. 960 F.Supp. 1448. Century Housing argued that it had effectively met all requirements of the consent decree at this point, but it wanted to continue to operate as an affordable housing provider beyond the scope of its original consent decree.</p>\r\n<p>On March 29, 2000, the parties stipulated that the court&rsquo;s jurisdiction should be extended to October 13, 2003. The court never officially extended its jurisdiction, but Century Housing continued to file quarterly status reports with Judge Pregerson until his death in November 2017, although official docket activity paused after February 2007. In 2010, Century Housing was certified by the U.S. Treasury as a Community Development Financial Institution and expanded its operations to Kern and San Diego Counties. In 2015, it reached a milestone of $1 billion in financing and the development of more than 25,000 homes.</p>\r\n<p>On May 3, 2018, the Century Housing Corporation filed a motion to dismiss the case because it had complied with the consent decree and the case was long dormant. District Court Judge Virginia A. Phillips granted the motion on May 8, 2018. This case is now closed.</p>",

In addition, the design that \nreceived approval on September 10, 1969, was subsequently revised; the revisions received design approval on \nDecember 23, 1970. \n \n7  See Exhibit SS to Conrado affidavit, filed with the Court on April 7, 1972. \n \n \n  20 \n \n\n \n8  In Environmental Law Fund v. Volpe, supra, Judge Peckham wrote, \n \n“Thus, even if a project were initiated prior to January 1, 1970, if the planning phase of the project did not take place \nuntil after January 1, 1970, a NEPA statement is required. No balancing of factors can be permitted in such a case; \nthe state highway department must file a statement in compliance with Section 102(2)(C). However, if all the \nplanning for a project took place prior to January 1, 1970-that is, if design approval preceded the passage of NEPA-a \nSection 102(2)(C) statement is required only if ‘practicable.”’ 340 F.Supp. at 1333. [Emphases in original; footnotes \nomitted.] \nJudge Craven, the author of the opinion in Arlington Coalition on Transportation v. Volpe, supra, went further, \nholding Section 102(2)(C) applicable to a highway, the planning of which had been completed before January 1, \n1970. After concluding that NEPA was “applicable to a project until it has reached the state of completion where the \ncosts of abandoning or altering the proposed route would clearly outweigh the benefits therefrom,” he added, \n“Manifestly the date of design approval alone does not accurately measure whether Arlington I-66 has reached the \ncrucial stage, and determining the applicability of Section 102(C) by this standard alone would be arbitrary and \ncapricious agency action and an abuse of administrative discretion. Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. § \n706(2)(A).” 458 F.2d at 1332 [Emphasis added.] \n \n9  In August 1971 the FHWA promulgated permanent regulations to replace the Interim Guidelines. Policy and \n  Procedure Memorandum 90-1 (Aug. 24, 1971) [hereinafter PPM 90-1]; see especially ¶ 5. The key element in the \nnew formula is still the date or dates on which the highway in question received design approval from the FHWA. If \nthe highway received design approval before January 1, 1970, compliance with NEPA is unnecessary; if it received \ndesign approval after February 1, 1971, compliance is necessary. If design approval was received during the thirteen \nmonth interval between January 1, 1970, and February 1, 1971, compliance with NEPA is required “if, in the \njudgment  of  the  FHWA  division  engineer,  implementation  of  [NEPA]  to  the  fullest  extent  possible  requires \npreparation and processing of an environmental statement.” PPM 90-1, ¶ 5b. [Emphasis added.] \nThe precise thrust of ¶ 5 of PPM 90-1, insofar as it pertains to highways that received design approval between \nJanuary 1, 1970, and February 1, 1971, is not clear. The phrase, “to the fullest extent possible,” seems to establish a \nvery strict standard for determining whether a Section 102(2)(C) statement is necessary. Other language in the \nparagraph, however, seems to undermine this tough standard. Before the FHWA division engineer can make the \nrequired determination, the state highway authorities must prepare, “in consultation with” the FHWA, a written \nreassessment of the highway in question. All that PPM 90-1 says about this reassessment is that it “should consider \nif the highway plans were developed in such a manner as to minimize adverse environmental consequences.” PPM \n90-1, ¶ 5c. Once the FHWA division engineer has received this reassessment, he makes the determination called for \nby ¶ 5b. In doing so, he must take into account a variety of environmental and nonenvironmental considerations. He \n“should consider, in addition to the written reassessment prepared by the [state authorities], the status of the \ndesign; right-of-way acquisition including demolition of improvements within the right-of-way; number of families \nalready rehoused and those yet to be rehoused; construction scheduling; benefits to accrue from the proposed \nhighway improvement; significant impacts; and measures to minimize any adverse impacts of the highway.” PPM \n90-1, ¶ 5b. \nParagraph 5 of PPM 90-1 is, in short, ambiguous. If the test that it establishes for determining the applicability of \nSection 102(2)(C) is the phrase, “to the fullest extent possible,” then the regulation is commensurate with the \nCourt’s interpretation of NEPA’s demands. On the other hand, if the test is as flexible as the subsequent sentences \nin the paragraph suggest, the regulation would appear to suffer from the same shortcomings as did paragraph 4 of \nthe FHWA’s Interim Guidelines. \n  21 \n \n\n \n \n10  See, e. g., Interstate (Century) 105 Freeway: Design Team Concepts at 33, the summary of a study conducted for the \n  California Division of Highways by Gruen Associates; it is dated December 1970. See also the testimony at the \nhearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction of Richard McMullin, a registered civil engineer with the Division \nof Highways and the head of the Division’s Environmental Investigation Unit for District 7 (Tr. at 261-280). \n \n11  Mr. McMullin testified that in his opinion automobile emission was responsible for approximately 50% of the air \n  pollution throughout the country, but was the source of between 60% and 70% of the air pollution in the Los \nAngeles basin. He also testified that it was the contention of the Los Angeles County Air Pollution Control District \nthat automobile emission caused 90% of the air pollution in Southern California (Tr. at 279). \n \n12  Mr. McMullin so testified (Tr. at 263-266). Air Quality Criteria for Carbon Monoxide, a study published by the United \n  States Department of Health, Education and Welfare during March 1970, indicates that the emission of carbon \nmonoxide  does  decrease  at  higher  speeds.  Plaintiffs  apparently  contend  that  the  emission  of  certain other \npollutants increases at higher speeds (Tr. at 277-278). \n \n13  Plaintiffs cite the following two articles: Bush, Urban Atmospheric Pollution, Civil Engineering-ASCF, May 1965, at 66; \n  Schneiderman, Cohn, and Paulson, Air Pollution and Urban Freeways: Making a Record on Hazards to Health and \nProperty, 20 Cath.U.L.Rev. 5 (1970). \n \n14  See the testimony of Mr. McMullin (Tr. at 265-267). \n \n \n15  See, e. g., Interstate (Century) 105 Freeway: Design Team Concepts, supra, at 32-33. \n \n \n16  Section 21102 of CEQA provides, \n \n“No state agency, board, or commission shall request funds, nor shall any state agency, board, or \ncommission which authorizes expenditures of funds *** authorize funds for expenditure for any \nproject, other than a project involving only planning, which could have a significant effect on the \nenvironment unless such request or authorization is accompanied by a detailed statement \nsetting forth the matters specified in Section 21100.” \nRelying on this provision, the state defendants argue that CEQA is only applicable to a project before funds are \nauthorized for it. The California Highway Commission approved the initial financing of the Century Freeway with \nfunds from the State Highway Fund on October 23, 1967. Therefore, the state defendants argue, it was too late to \napply CEQA to the Century Freeway when the statute entered into effect. \nThe Court does not believe that the legislature intended to foreclose the application of CEQA to every project that \n  22 \n \n\n \nreceived some funding prior to September 18, 1970. Section 21102 does not establish an exclusive deadline \napplicable even to projects the planning or financing of which began before CEQA’s enactment. \n \n17  See Exhibits MM and OO to Conrado affidavit, filed April 7, 1972. \n \n \n18  See Exhibit PP to Conrado affidavit, filed April 7, 1972. \n \n \n19  PPM 20-8, ¶ 4c, provides, \n \n“‘Social, economic, and environmental effects’ means the direct and indirect benefits or losses to the community \nand to highway users. It includes all such effects that are relevant and applicable to the particular location or design \nunder consideration such as: \n“(1) Fast, safe and efficient transportation. \n“(2) National defense. \n“(3) Economic activity. \n“(4) Employment. \n“(5) Recreation and parks. \n“(6) Fire protection. \n“(7) Aesthetics. \n“(8) Public utilities. \n“(9) Public health and safety. \n“(10) Residential and neighborhood character and location. \n“(11) Religious institutions and practices. \n“(12) Conduct and financing of Government (including effect on local tax base and social service costs). \n“(13) Conservation (including erosion, sedimentation, wildlife and general ecology of the area). \n“(14) Natural and historic landmarks. \n“(15) Noise, and air and water pollution. \n“(16) Property values. \n“(17) Multiple use of space. \n“(18) Replacement housing. \n“(19) Education (including disruption of school district operations). \n  23 \n \n\n \n“(20) Displacement of families and businesses. \n“(21) Engineering, right-of-way and construction costs of the project and related facilities. \n“(22) Maintenance and operating costs of the project and related facilities. \n“(23) Operation and use of existing highway facilities and other transportation facilities during construction and \nafter completion. \n“This list of effects is not meant to be exclusive, nor does it mean that each effect considered must be given equal \nweight in making a determination upon a particular highway location or design.” \n \n20  The two corridor hearings for the western segment of the freeway were held on June 5, 1963, and August 13, 1965. \n  The two hearings for the eastern segment were held on March 30, 1967, and April 16, 1968. \n \n21  See Conrado affidavit, filed April 7, 1972. The affidavit does not indicate whether or not a highway design public \n  hearing was held for that segment. It is not clear whether no hearing was held because a separate highway design \nhearing was not required at that time or whether a hearing was held but the affiant neglected to mention it in his \naffidavit. \n \n22  The seven design hearings were held on June 24, July 8, September 17, and October 15, 1969, and January 28, April \n  22, and May 13, 1970. \n \n23  PPM 20-8 was published in the Federal Register on January 17, 1969. 34 Fed.Reg. 728. The seven public hearings \n  referred to in the text were conducted between June 1969 and May 1970. See n. 22, supra. \n \n24  The required public hearings on the highway in question in Arlington Coalition had been held during 1958-five years \n  before the first corridor hearing on the Century Freeway and ten years before the amendment to Section 128(a). \nNevertheless, the Court of Appeals ordered the defendants to hold new public hearings. Judge Craven wrote, “We \nthink that the requirements added to Section 128(a) apply to a highway ongoing at the effective date of the \namendment if the costs of altering or abandoning the proposed location would not certainly outweigh whatever \nbenefits might be derived therefrom.” Judge Craven then stated, “As we have concluded *** above [i. e., in regard \nto NEPA], Arlington I-66 has not yet reached the critical stage of completion.” 458 F.2d at 1337. The Century \nFreeway has not reached that stage either. \n \n25  See the testimony of Robert Acorn, Assistant District Right-of-Way Agent with the Division of Highways (Tr. at \n  136-144), and the testimony of Frank M. Lentz, Senior District Right-of-Way Agent with the Division of Highways and \nthe supervisor of the Division’s relocation assistance program (Tr. at 230). \n \n26  See Exhibit A to McElroy affidavit, filed with the Court on April 7, 1972. After the enactment of the Relocation Act \n  and the promulgation of IM 80-1-71, the Division of Highways apparently gave the FHWA certain similar assurances. \n  24 \n \n\n \nSee Exhibit B to McElroy affidavit, supra. The record is not clear, however, as to whether these assurances reiterated \nall or part of the earlier assurances or whether they expanded upon the earlier assurances in any way. \n \n27  See state defendants’ Exhibit BBB, filed with the Court on April 7, 1972. \n \n \n28  The Highway Act and the Relocation Act do not require that the relocation supplements equal the difference \n  between what the displaced person receives for his old home and what he pays for his replacement home; they \nrequire only that the payment equal the difference  between what he receives for his old home  and what \ncomparable decent, safe, and sanitary replacement housing ought to cost.Section 506(a) of the Highway Act speaks \nof “the average price required for a comparable dwelling,” and Section 203(a)(1)(A) of the Relocation Act speaks of \n“the reasonable cost of a comparable replacement dwelling.” This detail may be responsible for some of the \ncomplaints of the plaintiffs’ witnesses. \n \n29  Two revisions of the brochure have been filed with the Court. The revision of November 18, 1968, forms a part of \n  Exhibit 4 to the McElroy affidavit that was filed with the Court on May 11, 1972; the revision of October 1, 1971, was \nfiled with the Court as state defendants’ Exhibit III on April 7, 1972. See also the testimony of the following three \nright-of-way agents with the Division of Highways: Dennis Weik (Tr. at 44-45); Madeline Brown (Tr. at 80-81, 85-86, \n88); Harold Binder (Tr. at 103-104). Compare the testimony of Prudence Wright, the owner of a rest home in \nInglewood that the Division of Highways intends to acquire (Tr. at 27-29). \n \n30  See the Lentz affidavit, filed with the Court on April 7, 1972, at ¶ 10. \n \n \n31  See the testimony of Mr. Acorn (Tr. at 211); cf. the Lentz affidavit, filed on April 7, 1972, at ¶ 11. \n \n \n32  Paragraph 15 of IM 80-1-71 contains almost identical requirements. \n \n \n33  See the Baker affidavit, filed with the Court on April 7, 1972, at ¶ 2. \n \n \n34  The relevant dates for each housing study are as follows, beginning with the study for the westernmost of the five \n  segments and progressing eastward: (1) The study for the segment between Sepulveda Boulevard and Vermont \nAvenue is state defendants’ Exhibit EEE, filed with the Court on April 7, 1972; it is dated September 1969 and was \napproved by the FHWA on October 7, 1969 (see Exhibit U to Conrado affidavit, supra). The FHWA requested an \nupdated study of this segment by letter dated March 1, 1971. The updated study is Exhibit HHH; it is dated June 21, \n1971, and was approved by the FHWA on August 27, 1971 (see Exhibit VV to Conrado affidavit). (2) The study for the \nsegment between Vermont Avenue and the Harbor Freeway is Exhibit CCC; it is dated April 9, 1969, and was \napproved by the FHWA on June 4, 1969 (see Exhibit N to Conrado affidavit). (3) The study for the segment between \nthe Harbor Freeway and Mona Boulevard is Exhibit FFF; it is dated October 1969 and was approved by the FHWA on \nDecember 12, 1969 (see Exhibit X to Conrado affidavit). (4) The study for the segment between Mona Boulevard and \nOrange Avenue is Exhibit GGG; it is dated December 1969, and was approved by the FHWA on January 16, 1970 (see \n  25 \n \n\n \nExhibit BB to Conrado affidavit). (5) The study for the segment between the Los Angeles River and Studebaker Road \nis Exhibit DDD; it is dated August 6, 1969, and was approved by the FHWA on August 25, 1969 (see Exhibit R to \nConrado affidavit). \n \n35  The study for the segment between Vermont Avenue and the Harbor Freeway (Exhibit CCC) is apparently the only \n  exception. \n \n36  Data on the number of rooms in the available apartments does appear in the study on the segment between Mona \n  Boulevard and Orange Avenue (Exhibit GGG) and the updated study on the segment between Sepulveda Boulevard \nand Vermont Avenue (Exhibit HHH). \n \n37  See Exhibit FFF at p. 14. The state defendants calculated that 79% of the displaced people in that segment of the \n  corridor probably wished to relocate in the same general vicinity. One hundred six apartment units renting for less \nthan $60 per month were to be destroyed for the Century Freeway. Therefore 83 replacement units were needed, \nor 28 units per year for three years. The figures that appear at p. 14, however, are 53 replacement units needed \n(Col. II) or 18 units per year for three years (Col. III). \n \n38  See Exhibit HHH at p. 12. \n \n \n39  See Exhibit FFF at p. 8. The apparent inadequacies of the available housing supply in the vicinity of this segment of \n  the freeway corridor may be the result of the rough measuring techniques used by the Division of Highways to \ngauge the demand for replacement housing. In all its studies the Division divided the displaced people into three \ncategories: those who definitely wanted to relocate in the vicinity of their old homes; those who definitely did not \nwant to relocate in the same area; and those who were not sure. The Division then added the percentage of those \nwho definitely wanted to stay and the percentage of those who were not sure in order to gauge the percentage of \nthe displaced people who desired replacement housing in the relevant area. In this particular segment of the \nfreeway corridor, however, the percentage of those who definitely wanted to stay was extremely low-only 17%-and \nthe percentage of those who were not sure was extremely high-62%. As a result, the total percentage used to gauge \nthe demand for replacement housing-79%-may well have been unrealistically high. \n \n40  See the testimony of Mr. Acorn (Tr. at 114-125); see also the Gilbar affidavit and the Ralph declaration, filed with the \n  Court on April 7, 1972. \nAs of the beginning of May 1972 nine of the twenty-nine homes that the Division of Highways had moved to \nWatts-Willowbrook and then renovated remained vacant. See the testimony of Mr. Acorn (Tr. at 119). The parties \ndisagree as to the significance of this fact. Plaintiffs contend that the houses remain vacant because they are small \nand are located on undesirable lots. See, e. g., the testimony of Ward Davis, a homeowner in Watts (Tr. at 346). \nDefendants contend that the vacancies reflect the fact that displaced persons have found suitable replacement \nhousing in the private housing market. See the testimony of Mr. Acorn (Tr. at 191-192). \n \n  26 \n \n\n \n41  See the testimony of Mr. Acorn (Tr. at 127-128). \n \n \n1  The Ralph Act, Sections 135.3-135.7 of the California Streets and Highways Code, empowers the Department of \n  Public Works, of which the Division of Highways is an agency, to provide relocation assistance to persons who reside \nin  low-income  areas  and  who  are  displaced  by  the construction  of  highways. The  Act  also  empowers  the \nDepartment to acquire land and housing, to refurbish existing housing, and to construct new housing, so that \nadequate decent, safe, and sanitary replacement housing will be available to such displacees. \nSection 135.3 declares, in part, that the Act’s objectives \n“can best be achieved by enabling low-income persons in economically depressed areas affected \nby  state  highway  construction  to  participate  in  the  development  and  execution  of  the \nreplacement housing program. Accordingly, when the initial replacement housing program is \nundertaken for the assistance of persons displaced by the construction of State Highway Route \n105 in Los Angeles County [i. e., the Century Freeway], such program shall be conducted in a \nmanner conducive to maximum community participation, thereby assisting in alleviation of \nexcessive unemployment by utilizing local labor and contributing to the development of training \nprograms for unskilled labor.” \nIn order to achieve these ends, Section 135.3 exempts “this initial replacement housing program” for the Century \nFreeway from “conventional contracting procedures, including competitive bidding.” \n \n2  The applicability of Section 128(a) and PPM 20-8 to the reconsideration of a federal-aid highway pursuant to NEPA \n  finds support in the directive in Section 102 of NEPA that “to the fullest extent possible *** public laws of the United \nStates shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with the policies” set forth in Section 101 of NEPA.

Lopez is an independent consultant in \n  affordable housing finance and development. He has previously served as President and Chief Executive Officer of \nthe California Community Reinvestment Corporation, as Director of Community Lending for Citibank, and as Chief of \nHousing for the Association of Bay Area Governments. \n \n3  Now retired, Joseph Montoya was formerly the Chief Counsel of Caltrans. In the late 1960’s, Montoya served as a \n  consultant to the Caltrans engineers designing the Century Freeway. He then served as the lead attorney for the \nState Defendants in the original Keith v. Volpe, 501 F.Supp. 403 (C.D.Cal.1980) action, and as the chief State \nnegotiator on the Consent Decree. \n \n4  Lopez and Montoya recommended that CHC’s housing development efforts be expanded to include the “tertiary \n  zone.” The Consent Decree envisioned primary, secondary, and tertiary development zones for affordable housing, \nextending six, twelve, and eighteen miles respectively from the Freeway. Consent Decree, Exh. B Part III.B. at 11. \nPrior to the Lopez/Montoya Report, CHC and its predecessor CFHP had limited their development efforts to the \nprimary and secondary zones. \nCHC’s Board of Directors recommended that the area served by the Housing Program be defined as the “greater Los \nAngeles metropolitan area, including, but not limited to, Los Angeles and Orange counties.” Id. at 3. This area would \ngo beyond the primary, secondary, and tertiary zones of the Consent Decree. \n \n5  Plaintiffs’ Counsel stated that “modifications to a consent decree are normally appropriate only after an evidentiary \n  hearing has been held, at which hearing appropriate evidence can be marshaled by both sides.” (Pls.’ Mem. P. & A. \nSupp. Mot. Amend Consent Decree at 8.) Given the court’s familiarity with the present case, however, a full \n  27 \n \n\n \nevidentiary hearing was unnecessary. See United States v. Oregon, 913 F.2d 576, 582 (9th Cir.1990), cert. denied, \n501 U.S. 1250, 111 S.Ct. 2889, 115 L.Ed.2d 1054 (1991) (adopting the “growing rule.. that the trial court may limit its \nproceeding to whatever is necessary to aid it in reaching an informed, just and reasoned decision.”) \n \n6  Plaintiffs’ Counsel urges this court to abandon Rufo and its progeny, arguing that the present case is not an \n  “institutional reform” case and the proposed modifications are therefore controlled by the more demanding Swift \nstandard. It is by no means a settled issue, however, whether the Swift standard survived Rufo and still applies in \nnoninstitutional reform cases. In United States v. Western Electric Company, 46 F.3d 1198 (D.C.Cir.1995), the D.C. \nCircuit noted that two courts of appeals “have treated Rufo as a decision limited to institutional reform litigation.” \nId. at 1203 (citing Lorain NAACP v. Lorain Bd. of Educ., 979 F.2d 1141, 1148 (6th Cir.1992) (en banc), cert. denied, 509 \nU.S. 905, 113 S.Ct. 2998, 125 L.Ed.2d 691 (1993); W.L. Gore and Assoc’s, Inc. v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 977 F.2d 558, 562 \n(Fed.Cir.1992)). By contrast, in Western Electric Company the D.C. Circuit joined two other courts of appeals and \nconcluded that “Rufo gave the ‘coup de grace’ to Swift and the Supreme Court’s summary of what might render a \nmodification ‘equitable’ relates to all types of injunctive relief.” Western Elec. Co., 46 F.3d at 1203 (citing In re \nHendrix, 986 F.2d 195, 198 (7th Cir.1993); see also Patterson v. Newspaper and Mail Deliverers’ Union of New York, \n13 F.3d 33, 37–38 (2d Cir.1993), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 809, 115 S.Ct. 58, 130 L.Ed.2d 16 (1994)). After Western \nElectric Company the Third Circuit concluded that Rufo could apply outside of the institutional reform context: \n“[T]he standard for modifying an injunction cannot depend on whether the case is characterized as an institutional \nreform  case,  a  commercial  dispute,  or  private  or  public  litigation.”  Building  and  Const.  Trades  Council  of \nPhiladelphia, AFL–CIO v. N.L.R.B., 64 F.3d 880, 888 (3d Cir.1995). Similarly, the First Circuit “[does] not read Rufo as \nbeing confined in principle to [institutional reform] cases.” AlexisLichine & Cie v. Sacha A. Lichine Estate Selections, \nLtd., 45 F.3d 582, 586 (1st Cir.1995). Accordingly, even if the present dispute were not an institutional reform case, \nthe weight of circuit authority favors application of Rufo outside of the institutional reform context. \n \n7  This is necessarily an inexact inquiry because the court finds no language in the Consent Decree which prevents CHC \n  from moving away from deep gap funding. In fact, the Consent Decree requires that the “Defendants shall provide \nfunds for, and/or financing of, all costs associated with the development and implementation of the housing \nprogram.” Consent Decree, Exh. B at 18 Part B.1 (emphasis added). This language would presumably include primary \nloans in addition to the now-disputed deep gap funding. Plaintiffs’ Counsel counters that the income bands \nnecessarily restrict CHC to deep gap funding. (R.T. at 174); see also Consent Decree, Exh. B at Part D.1 (requiring \nFederal and State Defendants to fund the gap between the cost of creation of housing and conventional financing). \n \n8  The distributions required in the consent decree are as follows: \n \nA. At least 25% of all units at 80%–120% of adjusted county median income (Moderate Income) \nB. At least 25% of all units at 50%–80% of adjusted county median income (Low Income) \nC. At least 25% of all units at 25%–50% of adjusted county median income (Very Low Income) \nD. At least 5% of all units at 0%–25% of adjusted county median income (Very Very Low Income) \nE. The remaining 20% of a project’s units can be market rate, distributed among the four income bands above, or \nconcentrated within one or more of the income bands. \nConsent Decree, Exhibit B at 20–21. \nCHC could satisfy both the IRS and Consent Decree requirements by limiting subsection A residents to no more than \n  28 \n \n\n \n80% of median income. The Consent Decree, however, anticipates that this segment of the residents could be up to \n120% of median income.   See subsection A above. \n \n9  The IRS regulations fail to provide one important structural protection: requirements for the very very low income \n  resident, who earns 0–25 % of median county income. The Consent Decree currently requires that the Housing \nProgram devote 5% of its units to such residents, yet the IRS safe haven does not include the very very poor. See \nRev. Proc. 96–32 § 3.01. \nIn modifying the Consent Decree to make the income bands goals instead of strict requirements, it is not this court’s \nintent to abandon the very real needs of very very low income residents. The court fully anticipates that CHC will \nstrive to continue to meet and, if possible, exceed the five percent goal for very very low income residents. \n \n \n  29 \n ",

All Citations \n \n965 F.Supp. 1337, 1996 WL 879558 \n \n \nFootnotes \n \n1  The principal defendants were the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Highway Administration, and \n \n  49 \n \n\nCaltrans. \n \n2  During 1973 and 1974, changes in the Federal Aid Highway Act made federal monies available for mass transit \n  projects. Accordingly, the I–105 plan was altered to recommend that a “busway” be built in the freeway median. In \nJuly 1974, the busway plan was approved. \n \n3  The Amended Decree also provided for various mitigating measures to redress the economic and social impacts of \n  the freeway. Mitigation measures included a massive low-income affordable housing program and job-training \nprograms for affected persons. The Amended Decree also reserved to this court the power to modify the decree’s \nterms on motion of any party. Keith v. Volpe, 784 F.2d 1457 (9th Cir.1986). \n \n4  It is important to note that at oral argument, the court asked the parties if there were any billboards along the I–105 \n  right-of-way. Although non-party Kudler submitted that there may be illegally constructed billboards on private \nproperty near the freeway, Caltrans has assured the court that it has not permitted the placement of any billboards \nalong I–105. \n \n5  COAA regulation § 2502(f) states: \n \n“Continuous planting” means state right-of-way contiguous to the traveled way which is planted with ornamental \nvegetation in accordance with standard landscaping practices. Physical breaks in the planting of less than 200 feet \nfor such items as highway overcrossings or undercrossings, streams, canals, stairways, culverts, and water \nsystems, shall not end a continuous planting. \nCOAA regulation § 2511 states: \nTo be classified as a landscaped freeway, a continuous planting segment measured parallel from the freeway \ncenterline shall be at least 1,000 feet in length. For the purposes of these regulations, the 1,000–foot length shall \nbe calculated by either of the following: \n(a) 1,000 linear feet of continuous planting on one side of the freeway, or \n(b) 1,000 linear feet of landscaped area which is the combination of continuous plantings on both sides of the \nfreeway. These plantings can either overlap or have a common point of beginning and ending, as measured \nalong the freeway centerline. \nIf a continuous planting segment as described above is followed by a gap of 200 feet or less and adjoins \ncontinuous planting which is at least 500 feet in length, the designation “landscaped freeway” will apply to the \ntotal length of the continuous planting segment, the “gap” and the continuous planting. \n \n6  The California state claim based on the California Environmental Quality Act, was premised on the “same nucleus of \n  operative fact” as the federal claims, United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 728, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 1140, 16 \nL.Ed.2d 218 (1966), and this court exercised its discretion to assert supplemental jurisdiction over that state claim. \nSee 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). \n  50 \n \n\n \n7  Plaintiffs’ current motion presents the facts necessary to meet the Amended Decree’s standard for the issuance of a \n  preliminary injunction. First, as the parties seeking to enforce the decree are the original plaintiffs, they have \nstanding to request an injunction to enforce the decree. Second, this is a last resort effort on the part of plaintiffs to \nprevent Caltrans from issuing billboard permits to Kudler. Indeed, plaintiffs awaited the resolution of Kudler’s state \ncourt action, in which the state court issued a writ of mandate, before coming to federal court for injunctive relief. \nThird, if this court adopts the parties’ interpretation of the Amended Decree, no remedy other than an injunction to \nenjoin Caltrans from issuing the permits would assure compliance with the decree. Finally, the terms at issue here \nconstitute “significant terms” in the consent decree because “landscaped freeway” as well as the section of the Final \nEIS, entitled “AESTHETICS AND AMENITIES” were key assurances of compliance with NEPA’s aesthetic concerns. The \nfacts here meet the stipulated requirements for injunctive relief. \n \n8  These billboards will logically have to be quite large. After all, they must be visible to motorists and tall enough to \n  rise above the elevated sections of the freeway. \n \n9  COAA regulation § 2507 states: \n \nThe Director hereby delegates to the Chief Landscape Architect the responsibility to make all classifications \ndealing with landscaped freeways. If such delegation is hereafter changed, all references to “Chief Landscape \nArchitect” shall mean whomever is delegated the responsibility of classifying freeways as landscaped freeways. \n \n \n \n  51 \n ",

We draw from these dispositions for the facts and prior proceedings. \n  6 \n \n\n \n \n3  The proposed outdoor advertising displays were to be placed (1) 40 feet east of West Alameda Street on the north \n  side of I–105; (2) 600 feet east of West Alameda Street on the north side of I–105; (3) 53 feet east of Watts Avenue \non the north side of I–105; (4) 3 feet east of Willowbrook Avenue on the south side of I–105; (5) 120 feet east of \nGorman Avenue on the south side of I–105; (6) 15 feet west of Long Beach Boulevard on the south side of I–105; (7) \n30 feet east of Long Beach Boulevard on the south side of I–105; (8) 471 feet east of Westec Way on the south side \nof I–105; (9) 971 feet east of Westec Way on the south side of I–105; (10) 530 feet west of Westec Way on the south \nside of I–105; (11) 29 feet west of Westec Way on the south side of I–105; (12) 987 feet west of Inglewood Avenue \non the south side of I–105; and (13) 900 feet of State Street on the north side of I–105. \n \n4  This action has been before Judge Pregerson since its initial filing in 1972. Following his elevation to the Ninth Circuit \n  Court of Appeals in 1979, Judge Pregerson has continued to preside over this litigation as a Circuit Judge sitting by \ndesignation on the District Court for the Central District of California. \n \n5  Earl Wright, Rose Hall, Pablo Zapeta and Minnie Hadley were added by the district court’s July 24, 1985 order. \n \n \n6  However, it now appears that Esther Keith died over three years ago, on May 30, 1994. Several weeks after oral \n  argument, Kudler’s counsel (not Keith’s) filed a motion to notice which we granted, accompanied by a certified \ndeath certificate. \n \n7  Because Kudler was haled into this action by the district court over his objections, this case is distinguishable from \n  Marino v. Ortiz, 484 U.S. 301, 108 S.Ct. 586, 98 L.Ed.2d 629 (1988) (holding that petitioners did not have standing to \nappeal from the consent decree because they were not parties to the litigation giving rise to the decree). \n \n8  Kudler offers three declarations from attorneys—Ray A. Barnhart, Robert M. Garrick and Kenneth L. Nelson—who \n  claim that a prohibition on billboards was never the intent of the parties. However, none of these attorneys was \ninvolved directly with the negotiation of the “landscaped freeway” provision. Barnhart began working for the \nFederal Highway Administration two years after the provision was agreed to. Garrick took part in only two of the \ndecree’s negotiation sessions: replacement housing and noise abatement. Finally, Nelson did not participate in any \nof the negotiation sessions. \n \n9  A consent decree binds only the consenting parties. See, e.g., United States v. Ward Baking Co., 376 U.S. 327, 84 \n  S.Ct. 763, 11 L.Ed.2d 743 (1964); Hughes v. United States, 342 U.S. 353, 72 S.Ct. 306, 96 L.Ed. 394 (1952). \n \n10  Further state court proceedings following the Los Angeles Superior Court’s mandate in favor of Kudler have been \n  stayed pending our decision in this case. \n \n11  Because we reverse the district court’s grant of preliminary injunction, we do not reach Kudler’s arguments that: (1) \n  7 \n \n\n \n  the district court’s injunction of a state court order violates the Anti–Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2283; and (2) the \nConsent Decree cannot deprive a non-party of his vested rights in the permits. \n \n \n  8 \n ",
