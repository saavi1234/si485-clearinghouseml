Represented by the Oregon Law Center, the plaintiffs challenged the City&rsquo;s enforcement of Grants Pass&rsquo;s anti-sleeping ordinance, anti-camping ordinance, park exclusion ordinance, and criminal trespass laws stemming from violations of these ordinances as unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S Constitution. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief prohibiting the City from enforcing the ordinances and criminal trespass laws until the class members had the opportunity to obtain shelter. The plaintiffs also sought declaratory relief as well as costs and attorneys&rsquo; fees. The plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel had contacted the City on September 10, 2018, to demand relief, but the parties were unable to resolve the dispute outside of court.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Mark D. Clarke. Both parties consented to jurisdiction by a magistrate judge for the entirety of the case. On January 2, 2019, the City amended its ordinance, removing &ldquo;sleeping&rdquo; from the definition of camping in an attempt to comply with a previous case, Martin v. Boise, which held that an ordinance punishing people for sleeping outside was unconstitutional when there was nowhere else for them to go. In amending its ordinance, the City meant to clarify that the act of &ldquo;sleeping&rdquo; no longer automatically constituted illegal &ldquo;camping,&rdquo; permitting those without shelter to sleep or rest in the City&rsquo;s parks. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 28, 2019, to add information about two additional plaintiffs. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on March 8, 2019, adding an additional individual to the plaintiff&rsquo;s attorneys.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 13, 2019, the plaintiffs moved to certify the class. After a hearing, Magistrate Judge Clarke granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for class certification on August 7, 2019. 2019 WL 3717800. The court defined the class as: \"All involuntarily homeless individuals living in Grants Pass, Oregon, including homeless individuals who sometimes sleep outside city limits to avoid harassment and punishment by Defendant as addressed in this lawsuit.\"</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs then filed their third amended complaint on November 13, 2019 to add an additional challenge to park exclusions under the Due Process Clause. On January 17, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment and requested an oral argument. The defendant responded with a joint motion for summary judgment on February 28, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>On July 22, 2020, Magistrate Judge Clarke denied the defendant&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment, and he granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for summary judgment. Magistrate Judge Clarke granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for summary judgment on the procedural due process claim because the park exclusions would go into effect immediately and were not stayed for appeal, leaving a person excluded from a park subject to arrest for reentry as soon as they received the exclusion notice. The court concluded that the deficient appeal procedures were unconstitutional and violated the procedural protections of due process. However, the court denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for summary judgment on their equal protection claim because the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the ordinances were selectively enforced and motivated by a discriminatory purpose. Likewise, summary judgment was denied on the plaintiffs&rsquo; substantive due process claim because they failed to convince the court that they had a liberty interest to sleep or camp in a public place and had not shown that the city engaged in &ldquo;conscience shocking behavior.&rdquo; 2020 WL 4209227.</p>\r\n<p>The court also found that the ordinances violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment because they punished people for sleeping or resting outside with a blanket when they had no other place to go due to the City&rsquo;s lack of adequate shelter. The ordinances also violated the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment because the plaintiffs were being punished for trying to live, and likely could not afford to pay the fines, resulting in additional fees and punishments that made it even more difficult for them to find housing. 2020 WL 4209227.</p>\r\n<p>On August 26, 2020, Judge Clarke issued an injunction enjoining the enforcement of three city ordinances against the plaintiff class. The City could not enforce the park exclusion ordinance, which allowed police officers to issue an order barring a person from all City park properties if the individual had been issued two or more citations violating regulations relating to city parks, or one citation violating state laws while on city park property. Unless it gave at least a 24-hour warning, the City also could not enforce the camping ordinances, which prohibited setting up or remaining on public property. Finally, the City could not enforce the criminal trespassing ordinance in city parks during nighttime hours.</p>\r\n<p>That same day, the city of Grants Pass appealed the district court&rsquo;s grant of partial summary judgment and its permanent injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35752). The Ninth Circuit&rsquo;s decision on September 28, 2022, affirmed that the city&rsquo;s &ldquo;anti-camping&rdquo; ordinance prohibiting individuals from using bedding supplies violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause. The case was remanded with direction to the district court to narrow its injunction to only enjoin enforcement of ordinances against unhoused individuals who take necessary measures to keep themselves warm and safe when there is no shelter available. Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit vacated the grant of summary judgment on the procedural due process claim and remanded with instructions to dismiss the claim as moot because the City amended the ordinance so it was no longer unconstitutional. 50 F.4th 787.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the meantime, the plaintiffs filed a motion for costs and attorneys&rsquo; fees on September 9, 2020. The parties thereafter, by October 5, 2020, reached an agreement for the plaintiffs to receive $300,000 with interest for their costs and attorneys&rsquo; fees. 2020 WL 6060925. Three days later, on October 8, the City appealed to the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35881).</p>\r\n<p>The City filed a petition for en banc review with the Ninth Circuit on November 14, 2022.</p>\r\n<p>On July 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit amended the opinion it issued on September 28, 2022. It amended the order to deny the petition for rehearing en banc, reasoning that Grants Pass provided exceptionally limited protection and was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. The court further stated that future petitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc would not be entertained in this case.</p>\r\n<p>In response to the Ninth Circuit&rsquo;s denial for a rehearing en banc, the City filed a petition for writ of certiorari on August 22, 2023, requesting the Supreme Court to rule on whether laws regulating camping on public property constituted cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. 2023 WL 5530379.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 16, 2024, the Supreme Court granted certiorari. On June 28, 2024, the Supreme Court issued its decision, ruling 6-3 to reverse and remand. 2024 WL 3208072. &nbsp;The majority&rsquo;s decision, written by Justice Gorsuch and joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas, Alito, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, reasoned that the Eighth Amendment focuses on the &ldquo;method or kind of punishment&rdquo; that may be imposed after conviction, and not on whether the government may criminalize particular behavior, and therefore could not support the relief sought. The Court further held that the punishments imposed by Grants Pass under the challenged statute were not cruel and unusual. The majority opinion further rejected the argument that laws against camping criminalized the &ldquo;status&rdquo; of homelessness, reasoning that the challenged law applied to anyone who undertook the act of camping, rejecting plaintiffs&rsquo; argument &ldquo;camping, for people without other housing options, was &ldquo;involuntary&rdquo; and thus could not be criminalized. The Court therefore reversed and remanded for further proceedings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In a concurrence, Justice Thomas noted his opinion that the 1962 case rendering &ldquo;status crimes&rdquo; unconstitutional was wrongly decided, and rejected the Court of Appeals&rsquo; conclusion that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments clause governed civil penalties because they could later become criminal offenses. The dissenting opinion, authored by Justice Sotomayor and joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson, urged that the Eighth Amendment prohibits criminalizing the status of homelessness by making it a crime to sleep outside when a person has no other place to sleep. The dissent further noted that the Court had not decided whether the ordinance violated the Eighth Amendment&rsquo;s Excessive Fines Clause, Due Process, or state law. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 23, 2024, this matter was remanded to the district court for the limited purpose of approving a settlement agreement between the two parties. The parties informed the court that the matter was settled, and the case was dismissed without prejudice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The City of Grants Pass is trying to run homeless people out of town.  On any given day \nor night, hundreds of individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon are forced to live outside due to the lack \nof emergency shelter and affordable housing in their community.  The most recent “point in \n \n1 – CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 1    Filed 10/15/18    Page 2 of 15\ntime” count in Josephine County found 654 individuals on the street and another 1011 \nindividuals precariously housed for a total of 1754 people who are homeless or at immediate risk \nof homelessness.  These numbers have risen since that count in 2017.  This year, Grants Pass \nSchool District #7 reported 513 homeless youth enrolled in the District, the tenth most in the \nstate.  Grants Pass has a severe affordable housing shortage and no emergency shelter for \nhomeless people.  The people living outside in Grants Pass have nowhere else to go.  Like all \npeople, they require a place to rest, sleep, stay warm, and stay alive.  \n2.  Over a period of years, the City of Grants Pass has taken coordinated steps to drive \nhomeless people out of town.  The City has refused to allow warming stations in the winter \n(which are very cold), and cooling stations in the summer (which are very hot and increasingly \nsmoky).  The City has removed park benches from its parks.   The City has paid one-way bus \nfare for homeless people to leave town.  The City has driven people to Jackson County.  One city \ncouncilor stated in a city council meeting, “the point is to make it uncomfortable enough for \nthem [homeless people] in our city so they will want to move on down the road.”  At the same \ntime, city council has voted against affordable housing in the City and has failed to take steps to \ncreate a low-barrier emergency shelter for the hundreds of homeless people who live in the City.   \n3.  Grants Pass has a web of ordinances, customs, policies and practices that, in combination, \ncriminalize the existence of homeless people in Grants Pass.  When people are found sleeping \noutside they are awakened by police, moved along, often ticketed, ordered to appear in court, \ncriminally fined and prosecuted for “illegal sleeping,” “illegal camping” and criminal trespass.  \nWhen people are sitting or resting in public spaces with a blanket or tarp for warmth, they are \nticketed, fined and arrested for “illegal camping.”  Grants Pass’ customs, policies and practices, \nas applied to involuntarily homeless individuals, violate the constitutional rights to be free from \n \n2 – CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 1    Filed 10/15/18    Page 3 of 15\ncruel and unusual punishment, to due process of law, and to equal protection of the laws, secured \nby the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Plaintiffs seek prospective injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief pursuant to 42 USC § 1983.  Debra Blake brings this action for herself and on \nbehalf of all similarly situated persons pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure.  Plaintiffs ask this court to enjoin defendants from taking law enforcement action \nagainst plaintiffs for sleeping or simply existing in Grants Pass unless and until the City provides \na lawful place for people to rest, sleep and find shelter.   \nI. JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4.  Jurisdiction exists for the claim pursuant to 28 USC §§ 1331 (federal question) and 1343 \n(civil rights) in that plaintiffs’ claims arise under 42 USC § 1983. Venue is proper in the District \nof Oregon pursuant to 28 USC § 1391(b)(2) because the City of Grants Pass is in this district and \nthe events giving rise to plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this district.  \nII. PARTIES \n5.   Plaintiff Debra Blake is and was at all relevant times an involuntarily homeless resident \nof Grants Pass, Oregon.   \n6.  Defendant City of Grants Pass is a municipal corporation duly organized and existing \nunder the laws of the State of Oregon.  The acts of defendant complained of were undertaken in \nthe execution of customs, policies, and practices implemented or consented to by authorized \npolicymakers of the City of Grants Pass.  The acts complained of were intentionally committed, \nare ongoing, and will continue to be systematically committed unless restrained by this Court. \nIII. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.    Grants Pass’ Affordable Housing Crisis and Lack of Emergency Shelter \n7.  Grants Pass is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis.  There is not nearly enough \n \n3 – CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 1    Filed 10/15/18    Page 4 of 15\naffordable housing to house all of the low-income residents of Grants Pass.  In 2017, the Point-\nin-Time Count of homeless people in Josephine County found 654 individuals on the street and \nanother 1011 individuals precariously housed for a total of 1754 people who are homeless or at \nimmediate risk of homelessness.  The majority of these people reside in Grants Pass, the \ncounty’s largest city, and these numbers have increased since last year. The Grants Pass School \nDistrict #7 currently has 531 homeless students enrolled.   \n8.  Unlike other comparably sized cities in Oregon, Grants Pass has no low-barrier \nemergency shelter for homeless individuals.  There is no place in Grants Pass where people can \nsimply show up and receive shelter during the day or night.   \n9.   The only shelters for adults in Grants Pass are run by the Gospel Rescue Mission.  These \nshelters are nearly always full, they only allow people to stay for a limited duration, and they \nhave many rules that exclude large numbers of people.  There are no shelters at all for couples or \nfor men with children.   \n10.  Stays at the Gospel Mission are limited to 30 days. The rules of the Mission run for \nseveral pages and include the following: \n  “If you have serious or chronic medical or mental issues that prevent you from \nparticipating in daily Mission life, you may not be able to stay at the Mission.” \n  “Medications must be turned in at the front desk.” \n  “You are to remain nicotine free during your stay at the Mission.”   \n  “There is no socializing between members of the opposite sex except at approved \nMission events.  Treat one another as a brother and/or sister.  All intimate relationships other \nthan legal/biblical marriage, regardless of gender, either on or off Mission property are strictly \nforbidden.”   \n \n4 – CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 1    Filed 10/15/18    Page 5 of 15\n  “Taking a sick day will result in losing pass privileges for 72 hours and confinement to \nstaying indoors during this time to insure a thorough recovery from illness.”   \n  “Every Sunday, you are required to attend a church approved by the Mission staff.  The \nindividual church is your choice, however it must hold to traditional Christian teachings such as \nthe Apostles Creed.”    \n11.  Residents are not allowed to look for work during their 30 days at the Mission.   \n12.  Even if these shelters were lower-barrier, there would not be nearly enough beds to \nshelter all of the homeless people in Grants Pass.  In total, there are 30 beds in a dorm for single \nmen, four bunk rooms for single women and twelve rooms for mothers with up to four children.   \n13.  The County in which Grants Pass is located, Josephine, has in recent months taken steps \nin a different direction than the City of Grants Pass.  Josephine County’s Board of \nCommissioners declared a countywide affordable housing crisis in November of 2017.  The \nCounty took steps to legalize more nonconventional housing units and camping in some \ncircumstances.  The Mayor of Grants Pass, Darin Fowler, publically expressed opposition to \nthese measures.   \n14.    Grants Pass has no Public Housing and the wait list for a Section 8 voucher is long.  If a \nperson is lucky enough to get a voucher in Josephine County there is only a 22% utilization rate.  \nIn short, it is hard to get a housing voucher and if a person gets one, there are very few places to \nuse it.   \nB.  Plaintiff Debra Blake \n15.  Plaintiff Debra Blake is involuntarily homeless and has been so for the past seven years.  \nShe has lived in Grants Pass for 14 years.  About seven years ago, she lost her job and her \nhousing and has been forced to live outside.   \n \n5 – CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 1    Filed 10/15/18    Page 6 of 15\n16.  Ms. Blake cannot afford housing and there is no available bed for her at an emergency \nshelter anywhere in Grants Pass.  \n17.  Ms. Blake, over the past seven years has been repeatedly told by Grants Pass police that \nshe must “move along” and that there is nowhere in Grants Pass that she can legally sit or rest. \nShe has been repeatedly awakened by Grants Pass police while sleeping and told that she needs \nto get up and move.  She has been told by Grants Pass police that she should leave town.   \n18.  Because she has no choice but to live outside and has no place else to go, Ms. Blake has \nfaced ticketing, fines and criminal prosecution.   \n19.  On July 1, 2014, at 6:20 a.m., Ms. Blake was cited for violating GPMC 5.61.020 for \nsleeping in an alley at 620 SE J Street in Grants Pass and was fined $35.  Ms. Blake is unable to \npay this fine, which because of late fees is now $109.   \n20.  On September 24, 2014 at 3:26 a.m., Ms. Blake was cited for violating GPMC 5.61.030 \nfor “prohibited camping” while sleeping at 311SE G Street in Grants Pass and was fined $295.  \nMs. Blake is unable to pay this fine, which because of late fees is now $503.   \n21.  On October 4, 2014, Ms. Blake was cited for violating GPMC 5.61.030 for “prohibited \ncamping” while sleeping at 431 NE D Street in Grants Pass and was fined $295.  Ms. Blake is \nunable to pay this fine, which because of late fees is now $503.   \n22.  On October 28, 2015, Ms. Blake was sleeping at 1555 NE A Street in Grants Pass and \nwas arrested and charged with Criminal Trespass in the First Degree, under ORS 164.255, a \nClass A Misdemeanor.  Ms. Blake was convicted, fined $200 and placed on bench probation for \n24 months.  Ms. Blake is unable to pay this fine which because of late fees is now $416.   \n23.  On May 1, 2016, Ms. Blake was sleeping on private property located at 201 NE 8th Street \nin Grants Pass and was arrested and charged with Criminal Trespass in the Second Degree under \n \n6 – CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 1    Filed 10/15/18    Page 7 of 15\nORS 164.245, a Class C Misdemeanor.  She was convicted, fined $200 and placed on bench \nprobation for six months.  Ms. Blake is unable to pay this fine which because of late fees is now \n$416.   \n24.  On July 17, 2018, Ms. Blake was sleeping in Riverside Park in Grants Pass at 7:33 a.m.  \nShe was approached by a Grants Pass police officer and issued a citation for violating GPMC \n6.46.090 “Camping in Park” a violation that has a presumptive fine of $295.  On July 24, 2018, \nMs. Blake was again in Riverside Park.  She was arrested, taken into custody, cited for Criminal \nTrespass II, incarcerated and spent the night in jail before being released the next morning.  Her \nrelease agreement contains the provision that Ms. Blake is to “have no contact with All Grants \nPass Parks.”  The Criminal Trespass II citation has yet to be charged.  She was found guilty of \nthe “Camping in Park” offense and her fine for this offense is now $410.    \n25.  Ms. Blake now owes the City of Grants Pass more than $4000 in fines for crimes and \nviolations related directly to her involuntary homelessness and the fact that there is no affordable \nhousing or emergency shelter in Grants Pass where Ms. Blake can stay.   \n26.  Ms. Blake continues to live without shelter in Grants Pass. At any time, she could be \narrested, ticketed and prosecuted for sleeping outside or for covering herself with a blanket to \nstay warm.  She has no place else to go.   \nC.  Grants Pass’ Efforts to Run Homeless People Out of Town \n27.  On a daily and nightly basis hundreds of homeless people living in Grants Pass are in the \nidentical situation as Ms. Blake.  They are awakened by officers of the Grants Pass Public Safety \nDepartment.  They are moved along.  They are told that they cannot sleep outside.  They are \nfrequently ticketed, fined, prosecuted and jailed for existing outside in Grants Pass.  \n28.  The City of Grants Pass has taken other affirmative and intentional steps to remove \n \n7 – CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 1    Filed 10/15/18    Page 8 of 15\nhomeless people from its borders.  The City has removed park benches from its parks so that \npeople have no place in public to rest.  The City has built fences around bus stop benches.  City \npolice have offered to pay one-way bus fare to get homeless people out of town.   \n29.  The City has made it impossible for any organization to operate a warming or cooling \ncenter for homeless people anywhere within the City.  \n30.  The Grants Pass City Council has voted against affordable housing projects being \nallowed in the City, sometimes citing non-existent problems, like lack of parking, to explain their \nvotes against affordable housing.   \n31.  Elected officials have publically stated their desire to drive homeless people from the \nCity and to make it difficult for homeless people to live in Grants Pass.   \n32.  Counsel for plaintiffs reviewed dozens of anti-camping and anti-sleeping citations \nproduced to them by Defendants pursuant to a public records request.  These tickets were issued \nbetween January of 2015 and May of 2017.  Of the 208 tickets received and reviewed, almost all \nof them were issued to people who were homeless at the time of issuance.  These tickets show \nthat these ordianances are selectively enforced against homeless individuals.  Also, the tickets \nwere usually issued based on officer initiated patrols, not based upon complaints from the public.  \nOf the 83 camping tickets issued pursuant to GPMC 5.61.030, 67 were officer initiated.  Of the \n125 sleeping tickets issued pursuant to GPMC 5.61.020, 93 of them were officer initiated.   \nD.  Relevant Ordinances   \n33.   City of Grants Pass Municipal Code 5.61.010-030 “Prohibited Camping” provides, in \npart: \n5.61.010 Definitions. Unless the context requires otherwise the \nfollowing definitions apply to Chapter 5.61.  \nA. “To Camp” means to set up or to remain in or at a campsite.  \n \n8 – CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 1    Filed 10/15/18    Page 9 of 15\nB. “Campsite” means any place where bedding, sleeping bag, or other \nmaterial used for bedding purposes, or any stove or fire is placed, \nestablished, or maintained for the purpose of maintaining a temporary \nplace to live, whether or not such place incorporates the use of any tent, \nlean-to, shack, or any other structure, or any vehicle or part thereof.  \n5.61.020 Sleeping on Sidewalks, Streets, Alleys, or Within Doorways \nProhibited  \nA. No person may sleep on public sidewalks, streets, or alleyways at any \ntime as a matter of individual and public safety.  \nB. No person may sleep in any pedestrian or vehicular entrance to public \nor private property abutting a public sidewalk.  \nC. In addition to any other remedy provided by law, any person found in \nviolation of this section may be immediately removed from the premises.  \n5.61.030 Camping Prohibited  \nNo person may occupy a campsite in or upon any sidewalk, street, alley, \nlane, public right of way, park, bench, or any other publicly-owned \nproperty or under any bridge or viaduct,  \n \n34.  The City of Grants Pass Municipal Code 6.46.090, “Camping in Parks” provides,    \n6.46.090 Camping in Parks \nA. It is unlawful for any person to camp within the boundaries of a City  \nPark.  For the purposes of this section, camping shall mean sleeping or  \nerecting sleeping quarters or living quarters. \n \nIV. Class Allegations \n35.  Debra Blake brings this action on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated under \nRule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  She seeks to represent a class that consists of: \nall involuntarily homeless people living in Grants Pass, Oregon.   \n36.  The Class is so numerous that joinder of its members is impracticable.  The latest point-\nin-time count for Josephine County indicates that the class numbers, at a minimum, in the \nhundreds.  In addition to the hundreds of homeless adults, there are 531 homeless youth enrolled \nin school in Grants Pass.   \n37.  The relief sought is common to all members of the proposed class, and common \nquestions of law and fact exist as to all members of the class.  Plaintiffs seek prospective relief \n \n9 – CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 1    Filed 10/15/18    Page 10 of 15\nfrom enforcement of Grants Pass’ anti-camping ordinances, Grants Pass’ anti-sleeping ordinance \nand Criminal Trespass laws when they are enforced against members of the class solely because \nthey have no place else to go.   \n38.  There is a well-defined community of interest in the questions of law and fact affecting \nthe class as a whole.  The questions of law and fact common to the class predominate over any \nquestions affecting solely individual members of the action, and include: \na.  Are emergency shelter beds available to all homeless individuals in Grants Pass? \nb.  Are there other places where involuntarily homeless people can go in Grants \nPass?  \nc.  Are resting, sleeping and sheltering oneself unavoidable basic human needs? \nd.  Does the City of Grants Pass’s enforcement of the anti-sleeping ordinance, the \nanti-camping ordinances and criminal trespass laws violate plaintiffs’ rights to \nequal protection and due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution?   \ne.  Does the City of Grants Pass’s enforcement of the anti-sleeping ordinance, the \nanti-camping ordinances and criminal trespass laws violate plaintiffs’ right to be \nfree from cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution? and \nf.  Is prospective relief appropriate to stop the City of Grants Pass from violating \nplaintiffs’ rights?  \n39.  Debra Blake’s claims are typical to the class.  Ms. Blake and the proposed class are \nhomeless individuals who have been and are subject to the enforcement of the City’s anti-\ncamping ordinances, anti-sleeping ordinance and criminal trespass laws as well as the City’s \n \n10 – CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 1    Filed 10/15/18    Page 11 of 15\nother policies and practices aimed at making homeless people in Grants Pass uncomfortable and \ndriving them out of town. \n40.  Ms. Blake will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. Plaintiffs have \nretained counsel competent and experienced in class action litigation. \n41.  A class action is the appropriate and superior method for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy. Prosecuting separate actions would create the risk of \ninconsistent or varying adjudications, establishing incompatible standards of conduct for the City \nof Grants Pass. Allowing this lawsuit to proceed as a class action will permit the class of \nsimilarly situated persons to prosecute their common claims in a single forum simultaneously \nand efficiently, and without the unnecessary duplication of effort and expense that numerous \nindividual actions would entail. \n42.  To the extent that any member of the class could afford individual litigation, it would be \nunduly burdensome to the judicial system. Concentrating this litigation in one forum will \npromote judicial economy, consistency, and parity among the claims of individual members of \nthe class. \n43.  Plaintiffs know of no difficulty which would be encountered in the management of this \nlitigation that would preclude its maintenance as a class action. \nV. Plaintiffs Attempted to Resolve this Matter Prior to Litigation \n44.  Plaintiffs’ counsel contacted the City of Grants Pass on September 10, 2018 to demand \nrelief as outlined in this complaint.   \n45.  Despite these efforts, the parties have not been able to resolve their dispute. \n \n \n \n11 – CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 1    Filed 10/15/18    Page 12 of 15\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \nEighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Cruel and Unusual Punishment) \nand 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n46.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations above as if fully set forth herein. \n47.  Unsheltered homeless people in Grants Pass are involuntarily homeless in public.  They \nhave no place else to go.    \n48.  Resting, sleeping and seeking shelter is not voluntary conduct.  They are basic and \nharmless human needs.  Performing these acts in public is integral to the status of being \nhomeless in Grants Pass.   \n49.  By punishing the acts of resting, sleeping or seeking shelter in public, without providing \nany legal place for most homeless place to conduct such activities, Grants Pass effectively \npunishes the status of homelessness.   \n50.  As applied to the homeless individuals, the City’s enforcement of the anti-sleeping \nordinance, the anti-camping ordinances and criminal trespass laws violates the 8th Amendment \nproscription of cruel and unusual punishment by harming plaintiffs with sanctions for engaging \nin innocent, involuntary, life-sustaining activity, thus effectively criminalizing their homeless \nstatus.   \n51.  In the absence of prospective injunctive relief, plaintiffs and prospective class members \nwill be subject to the real threat of being ticketed, arrested, fined and jailed in violation of their \nright against cruel and unusual punishment.   \n52.  Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive and declaratory relief, as set forth below. \n53.  Plaintiffs are entitled to their reasonable costs and attorney fees on this claim pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1988. \n \n12 – CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 1    Filed 10/15/18    Page 13 of 15\nSECOND  CLAIM FOR RELIEF:  \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Equal Protection) \nand 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n54.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations above as if fully set forth herein.  \n55.  Defendants selectively enforce the anti-sleeping ordinance, the anti-camping ordinances \nand criminal trespass laws against individuals like Ms. Blake pursuant to a discriminatory \npurpose to rid the City of Grants Pass of homeless individuals. \n56.  Ms. Blake and the class she seeks to represent have been told by Grants Pass police that \nthere is no place where homeless people are allowed to be in Grants Pass.  The fundamental right \nof the plaintiffs to move about freely and engage in harmless life-sustaining activities such as \nresting,  sleeping and attempting to stay warm was and is infringed on by Defendant’s conduct \nand enforcement of the camping ordinances, the sleeping ordinance and criminal trespass laws.   \n57.  Homelessness is an arbitrary classification that Defendant uses to accomplish the \nforbidden aim of ridding the City of Grants Pass of homeless persons through selective \napplication of the above laws. \n58.  Non-homeless people are not ticketed, fined, prosecuted and jailed for resting or sleeping \nin public.  \n59.  Defendant’s selective enforcement of these laws violates the Equal Protection clause of \nthe 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. \n60.  Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive and declaratory relief, as set forth below. \n61.  Plaintiffs are entitled to their reasonable costs and attorney fees on this claim pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1988. \n \n \n13 – CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 1    Filed 10/15/18    Page 14 of 15\nTHIRD  CLAIM FOR RELIEF:  \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Substantive Due Process) \nand 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n62.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations above as if fully set forth herein.  \n63.  The fundamental right of the individual plaintiffs to move about freely and engage in \nharmless life-sustaining activities such as resting,  sleeping and attempting to stay warm was and \nis infringed on by Defendant’s conduct and enforcement of the camping ordinances, the sleeping \nordinance and criminal trespass laws.   \n64.  Defendant’s conduct violates the Due Process clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution. \n65.  Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive and declaratory relief, as set forth below. \n66.  Plaintiffs are entitled to their reasonable costs and attorney fees on this claim pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1988. \nFOURTH  CLAIM FOR RELIEF:  \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Procedural Due Process/Notice) \nand 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n67.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations above as if fully set forth herein.  \n68.  The City of Grants Pass’ two anti-camping ordinances do not provide constitutionally \nsufficient notice such that a reasonable homeless person in Grants Pass would understand what \nconduct is prohibited.   \n69.  Plaintiffs have not been given meaningful notice prior to being deprived of the liberty \ninterests in moving freely through Grants Pass, resting, sleeping and seeking shelter from the \nelements.   \n \n14 – CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 1    Filed 10/15/18    Page 15 of 15\n70.  Plaintiffs are entitled to their reasonable costs and attorney fees on this claim pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1988. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs ask the Court for the following relief: \n1.  To certify the class as defined above at ¶ 42; \n2.  To declare Grants Pass’ campaign to drive homeless people out of the City \nunconstitutional and enjoin such practices, policies and customs;   \n3.  To issue a declaration that, as applied to plaintiffs, enforcement of GPMC 5.61.020 (the \nanti-sleeping ordinance), GPMC 5.61.030 (the anti-camping ordinance), GPMC 6.46.090 (the \nparks anti-camping ordinance) and criminal trespass laws is an unconstitutional infringement on \nplaintiffs' Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. \n4.  To issue an injunction prohibiting Grants Pass from enforcement of GPMC 5.61.020 (the \nanti-sleeping ordinance), GPMC 5.61.030 (the anti-camping ordinance), GPMC 6.46.090 (the \nparks anti-camping ordinance) and criminal trespass laws against homeless individuals in Grants \nPass who are engaged in the life sustaining activities of resting, sleeping or seeking shelter from \nthe elements, unless and until Grants Pass provides a place where plaintiffs can lawfully engage \nin necessary life-sustaining activities.   \n5.  To award Plaintiffs their costs and attorney fees, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988 \n6.  To award Plaintiffs such other relief as may be just and equitable.   \n  Respectfully submitted, this 15th day of October, 2018.   \n            /s/ Edward Johnson       \n            Walter Fonseca, OSB #136349 \n            Eric Dahlin, OSB #945439 \n            Edward Johnson, OSB #965737 \n            (541) 476-2154     \n \n15 – CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT ",

R. Civ. P. 23.  For the reasons below, Plaintiffs' motion is GRANTED.1 \n1 The parties have consented to Magistrate Judge jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 636(c)(l). \n1 \n\nBACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs are three allegedly homeless individuals in the City of Grants Pass. As alleged, \nplaintiff Debra Blake has been homeless in Grants Pass for about eight to ten years. Blake Supp. \nDecl. ~ 3 (#26). Although she currently lives in temporary transitional housing, she is beyond her \nninety-day stay and faces the imminent possibility of returning to the streets. Blake Supp. Deel. \n~~ 2-3 (#43). Plaintiff John Logan alleges he has been intermittently homeless for the past ten \nyears. Logan Supp. Deel. ~~ 4-6 (#28). Currently, he works as an in-home care provider, and his \nclients let him sleep on a mattress in their storage room approximately four or five nights a week. \nLogan Supp. Deel.~~ 3-6 (#44). He has no legal right to stay at his clients' homes, and he spends \nthe remaining nights sleeping in his car at a rest stop north of town. Id. Plaintiff Gloria Johnson \nallegedly lives full-time in her van. Johnson Supp. Deel. ~ 5 (#27). \nPlaintiffs allege that each of their situations fall under the definition of homelessness \nadopted by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"). 24 \nC.F.R § 582.5 (2012). HUD's definition encompasses a variety of living situations, including \nyouth homelessness, id. § 582.5(3); individuals fleeing domestic violence, id. § 582.5(4); \nindividuals \"living in a supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide \ntemporary living arrangements,\" id. § 582.5(1)(ii); and individuals whose primary nighttime \nresidence \"is a public or private place not designed for or ordinarily used as a regular sleeping \naccommodation for human beings, including a car, park, abandoned building, bus or train station, \nor camping ground, id. § 582.5(1)(i). Plaintiffs allege that their situations are just three \nrepresentations of modem homelessness in the United States. While their exact circumstances \nand stories may vary, they all share the need to conduct the life sustaining activities ofresting, \nsleeping, and seeking shelter from the elements while living in Grants Pass without a permanent \nhome. \n2 \n\nPlaintiffs allege that Defendant, through a combination of ordinances, customs, and \npolicies, has unconstitutionally punished them for conducting these life-sustaining activities and \ncriminalized their existence in Grants Pass. Plf. Mot. for Class Cert. at 8 (#25). They seek \nprospective declaratory and injunctive relief from enforcement of the following ordinances in the \nCity of Grants Pass Municipal Code: \n5.61.010 Definitions \nA. \"To Camp\" means to set up or to remain in or at a campsite. \nB.  \"Campsite\" means any place where bedding, sleeping bag,  or other \nmaterial  used  for  bedding  purposes,  or  any  stove  or  fire  is  placed, \nestablished, or maintained for the purpose of maintaining a temporary place \nto live, whether or not such place incorporates the use of any tent, lean-to, \nshack, or any other structure, or any vehicle or part thereof. \n5.61.020 Sleeping on Sidewalks, Streets, Alleys, or Within Doorways \nProhibited \nA. No person may sleep on public sidewalks, streets, or alleyways at any \ntime as a matter of individual and public safety. \nB. No person may sleep in any pedestrian or vehicular entrance to public or \nprivate property abutting a public sidewalk. \nC. In addition to any other remedy provided by law, any person found in \nviolation of this section may be immediately removed from the premises. \n5.61.030 Camping Prohibited \nNo person may occupy a campsite in or upon any sidewalk, street, alley, \nlane, public right of way, park, bench, or any other publicly-owned property \nor under any bridge or viaduct .... \n6.46.090 Camping in Parks \nA. It is unlawful for any person to camp, as defined in GPMC Title 5, within \nthe boundaries of the City parks. \nB. Overnight parking of vehicles shall be unlawful. For the purposes of this \nsection, anyone who parks or leaves a vehicle parked for two consecutive \nhours or who remains within one of the parks as herein defined for purposes \nof camping as defined in this section for two consecutive hours, without \npermission from  the  City Council, between the hours  of midnight and \n6:00am shall be considered in violation of this Chapter. \n3 \n\nPlaintiffs seek relief not only for themselves, but also on behalf of all involuntarily \nhomeless persons in Grants Pass. To support their allegation that the class is numerous, Plaintiffs \ncite to a point in time count (\"PIT Count\") of the number of sheltered and unsheltered homeless \npersons in Josephine County. Plf. Mot. for Class Cert. at 16 (#25). The PIT Count is an annual \ncount of homeless individuals on one night in January. Plf. Reply Br. at 19 (#41). HUD requires \nlocal homelessness assistance and prevention networks to conduct a PIT Count each year as a \ncondition of federal funding. Id. In January 2019, a PIT Count conducted by the United \nCommunity Action Network (\"UCAN\") counted 602 currently homeless individuals in Grants \n,r \nPass. Wessels Supp. Deel.  6 (#42). Another 1,045 individuals were \"precariously housed,\" \nmeaning that they were sleeping at the home of somebody else, i.e. \"couch surfing.\" Wessels \n,r \nSupp. Deel.  6 (#42). \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nPlaintiffs seeking class certification must affirmatively demonstrate that the proposed \nclass meets the four threshold requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and at least one of the \nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b). Amchem Prods., Inc. v.  Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 613-14 \n(1997).  To satisfy Rule 23(a), the plaintiffs must show that (1) the class is so numerous that \njoinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the \nclass; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses \nof the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \nthe class. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). To certify a class under Rule 23(b)(2), as Plaintiffs seek here, the \nplaintiffs must also show that the defendant \"acted or refused to act on grounds that apply \ngenerally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is \nappropriate respecting the class as a whole.\" \n4 \n\nPlaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating that each element of Rule 23 is satisfied. \nHanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497,508 (9th Cir. 1992).  While the primary focus is not \non the merits of the plaintiffs' claims, the Court must conduct a \"rigorous\" analysis and conclude \nthat each of the four requirements of Rule 23(a) has been affirmatively shown with facts before \ncertification can occur.  Falcon, 457 U.S. 147 (1982); Comcast v. Behrend, 133 S.Ct. 1426 \n(2013); Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 349-351 (2011) (\"Rule 23 does not set \nforth a mere pleading standard ... [the party seeking certification must instead] prove that there \nare in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law or fact, etc.\").  However, the \nCourt need only consider the complaint and \"material sufficient to form a reasonable judgment \non each [Rule 23(a)] requirement ....\"  Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F.2d 891, 901 (9th Cir. 1975). \nHolding plaintiffs to the evidentiary standards that will apply at trial risks terminating important \nclass actions before a putative class may gather crucial admissible evidence. Safi v. Corona Reg'/ \nMed. Ctr., 889 F.3d 623, 633 (9th Cir. 2018). \nDISCUSSION \nPlaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, allege that Defendant has \nimplemented a web of ordinances, customs, policies, and practices that, in combination, \ncriminalize the existence of homeless people. Plaintiffs seek prospective declaratory and \ninjunctive relief from \"enforcement of GPMC 5.61.020 (the anti-sleeping ordinance), GPMC \n5.61.030 (the anti-camping ordinance), GPMC 6.46.090 (the parks anti-camping ordinance), and \ncriminal trespass laws, as well as move-along orders issued by police against homeless \nindividuals in Grants Pass who are engaged in the life sustaining activities of resting, sleeping, or \nseeking shelter from the elements, unless and until the City provides a place where plaintiffs can \nlawfully engage in necessary life-sustaining activities.\" Plf.'s Motion for Class Cert. at 12 (#25). \nPlaintiffs propose the following class definition for certification: \nAll  involuntarily  homeless  individuals  living  in  Grants  Pass, \nOregon,  including  homeless  individuals  who  sometimes  sleep \n5 \n\noutside  city  limits  to  avoid  harassment  and  punishment  by \nDefendant as addressed in this lawsuit. \nFor the following reasons, Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification (#25) is granted, and \nthe proposed class definition is adopted. \nA.  Plaintiffs meet the standards for certification under Rule 23(a). \ni.  N umerosity \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)(l) requires a showing that the class is so numerous \nthat joinder of all members is impracticable. Not all class members need be identified, and a \nspecific threshold number of class members is not required. See Gen. Tel. Co. v. EEOC, 446 U.S. \n318,329 (1980); see also Freedman v. Louisiana-Pacific Corp., 922 F. Supp. 377,398 (D. Or. \n1996). Rather, courts must examine the \"specific facts of each case\" to determine whether the \nnumerosity requirement has been satisfied. Gen. Tel. Co., 446 U.S. at 329. Where plaintiffs seek \nonly injunctive and declaratory relief, the numerosity requirement is relaxed. Saravia v. Sessions, \n280 F. Supp. 3d 1168, 1203 (N.D. Cal. 2017). Under the relaxed requirement, \"plaintiffs may \nrely on reasonable inferences arising from plaintiffs' other evidence that the number of unknown \nand future members is sufficient to make joinder impracticable.\" Id. Similarly, \"a court may \ndraw reasonable inferences from the facts before it.\" Lynch v. Rank, 604 F. Supp. 30, 36 (N.D. \nCal. 1984). \nPlaintiffs ask the Court to certify a class of all involuntarily homeless people living in \nGrants Pass. This Court finds the proposed class numerous. The PIT Count data presented by \nPlaintiffs indicates that the proposed class contains at least 600 individuals. Moreover, the Ninth \nCircuit recently recognized that a single PIT Count \"will undercount the homeless population.\" \nMartin v. Boise, 920, F.3d 584,602 (9th Cir. 2019) (internal quotations omitted). The 2019 PIT \nCount, therefore, may be a conservative estimate of the number of homeless individuals in \nGrants Pass. Thus, under the relaxed numerosity requirement, Plaintiffs have presented sufficient \n6 \n\nfacts to allow this Court to reasonably infer that joinder of all members of the proposed class is \n· impracticable. \nii.  Commonality \nCommonality requires that \"there are questions oflaw or fact common to the class.\" Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). Common questions \"must be of such a nature that it is capable of class-wide \n··  resolution-which means that the determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is \ncentral to the validity of each of the claims in one stroke.\" Wal-Mart, 564 U.S at 350. The mere \nexistence of common questions alone will not meet the commonality requirement. See id. at 349. \nInstead, \"[w]hat matters to class certification ... is ... the capacity of a classwide proceeding to \ngenerate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.\" Id. (emphasis in original). \nUnder the commonality analysis, \"[p] laintiffs need not show that every question in the case, or \neven a preponderance of questions, is capable of classwide resolution. So long as there is 'even a \nsingle common question,' a would-be class can satisfy the commonality requirement.\" Wang v. \nChinese Daily News, Inc., 737 F.3d 538, 544 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at \n359). Moreover, the requirement of commonality will be satisfied where \"the lawsuit challenges \na system-wide practice or policy that affects all of the putative members.\" Dominguez v. \nSchwarzenegger, 270 F.R.D. 477,485 (N.D. Cal. 2010). \nPlaintiffs' claims share the following central questions: (1) whether Defendant's custom, \npattern, and practice of enforcing anti-camping ordinances, anti-sleeping ordinances, and \ncriminal \"trespass laws, along with imposing associated fines and fees, against involuntarily \nhomeless individuals violates the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution; (2) whether \nDefendant's selective enforcement of anti-camping ordinances, anti-sleeping ordinances, and \ncriminal trespass law~ violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the \nU.S. Constitution; (3) whether Defendant's conduct and enforcement of the anti-camping \n7 \n\nordinances, anti-sleeping ordinance, and criminal trespass laws violate Plaintiffs' fundamental \nright to move about freely and engage in harmless life-sustaining activities such as resting, \nsleeping, and attempting to stay warm, in violation of the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution; and (4) whether Defendant's two anti-camping ordinances \nprovide constitutionally sufficient notice prior to depriving Plaintiffs of their liberty interests in \nresting, sleeping, and seeking shelter from the elements, such that a reasonable homeless person \nin Grants Pass would understand what conduct is prohibited. \nThese common questions challenge a city-wide practice of enforcing anti-sleeping \nordinances, anti-camping ordinances, and criminal trespass laws that affect all the putative class \nmembers. Between January of2015 and May of 2017, the Grants Pass Police Department \nallegedly issued 208 anti-sleeping and anti-camping citations, primarily to homeless individuals. \nSecond Am. Compl. 149 (#23). Nothing in the record indicates that Defendant intends to alter, \ncease, or depart from its practice of enforcement. Therefore, because this lawsuit challenges a \nsystem-wide practice of enforcement that affects all putative class members, and a classwide \nproceeding can generate common answers to the aforementioned common questions to achieve a \nclasswide resolution, Plaintiffs have met the commonality requirement. \niii.  Typicality \nTypicality requires that Plaintiffs establish that the \"claims or defenses of the \nrepresentative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). \n\"The purpose of the typicality requirement is to assure that the interest of the named \nrepresentative aligns with the interests of the class.\" Wolin v. Jaguar Land Rover N. Am., LLC, \n617 F.3d 1168, 1175 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Hanan v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 \n(9th Cir. 1992)). \"The test of typicality is whether other members have the same or similar \n8 \n\ninjury, whether the action is based on conduct which is not unique to the named plaintiffs, and \nwhether other class members have been injured by the same course of conduct.\" Id. \nUnder HUD's definition, an individual \"who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate \nnighttime residence\" is homeless. 24 C.F.R § 582.5 (1). HUD further defines homelessness to \ninclude the following: (1) individuals with a primary nighttime residence that is \"a public or \nprivate place not designed for or ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation for human \nbeings, including a car, park, ... or camping ground,\" and (2) individuals who are living in \"a \nsupervised publicly or privately operated shelter designated to provide temporary living \narrangements,\" including \"congregate shelters, transitional housing, and hotels and motels paid \nfor by charitable organizations or by federal, state, or local government programs for low-income \nindividuals.\" 24 C.F.R § 582.5 (1) (i-ii) (2012). \nThe named Plaintiffs all fall under this definition of homelessness. Ms. Blake is living in \na supervised transitional housing treatment program. Blake Supp. Deel. ~~ 2-4 (#26). She is \nbeyond the ninety days that she was allotted to stay in this transitional housing, and she has been \ntold by staff \"to start looking for another place to live.\" Blake Supp. Deel.~ 3 (#43). She has no \nother place to live. Blake Supp. Deel. ~ 4 (#43).  Ms. Johnson lives in her van. Johnson Supp. \nDeel.~ 5 (#27). Mr. Logan sleeps in his truck two to three nights a week. Logan Supp. Deel.~~ \n4-6 (#44). The other nights, Mr. Logan's clients let him stay in their storeroom, a place where he \nhas no legal right to stay that is designed for storage rather than sleep. Logan Supp. Deel.~~ 4-6 \n(#44). Mr. Logan's clients may refuse him shelter whenever they do not want him to stay the \nnight. Logan Supp. Deel.~~ 4-6 (#44).  Therefore, Plaintiffs are homeless under the definition \nprovided by HUD. \n9 \n\nAs to the \"involuntary\" qualifier of the proposed class, the Ninth Circuit has defined \ninvoluntary homelessness as follows: a person is involuntarily homeless when \"there is a greater \nnumber of homeless individuals in [a jurisdiction] than beds available [in shelters].\" Martin v. \nCity ofB  oise, 920 F.3d 584,617 (2019). There are more homeless individuals than shelter beds \nin the City of Grants Pass. Wessels Supp. Decl. ~ 12 (#29); Wessels Supp. Deel.~~ 5-6 (#42). \nCurrently, the only shelters for adult homeless individuals are run by the Gospel Rescue Mission. \nSecond Am. Compl. ~ 12 (#23). These shelters have a total of thirty beds in a dorm for single \nmen, four bunk rooms for single women, and twelve rooms for mothers with up to four children. \nSecond Am. Compl. ~ 15 (#23). The PIT Count conducted by UCAN counted 602 currently \nhomeless individuals in Grants Pass. Therefore, there are more homeless individuals than shelter \nbeds in the City of Grants Pass, and Plaintiffs are involuntarily homeless based upon the \ndefinition provided by Martin. \nPlaintiffs are not the only involuntary homeless individuals in the City of Grants Pass. \nSecond Am. Compl. ~ 9 (#23). Plaintiffs' risk for the alleged future harm is thus based on \nconduct that is not unique to the named Plaintiffs. All involuntary homeless people, including \nPlaintiffs, who engage in the conduct prohibited by the challenged ordinances, are at risk from \nthe alleged future harm of criminalization, move-along orders, warnings, and fines. Blake Supp. \nDeel.~~ 2-16 (#26); Johnson Supp. Deel.~~ 2-14 (#27); Logan Supp. Deel.~~ 2-11 (#28). This \nrisk of future harm to the putative class is evidenced by the aforementioned 208 citations \nallegedly given out by the Grants Pass Police Department to homeless individuals. Second Am. \nCompl. ~ 49 (#23). Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiffs' claims are typical of the claims of \nthe class. \n10 \n\niv.  Adequacy of representation \nRule 23(a)(4) requires proposed class representatives to adequately protect the interests \nof the class. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). This requirement is satisfied if (1) the named \nrepresentatives appear able to prosecute the action vigorously through qualified counsel, and (2) \nthe representatives do not have antagonistic or conflicting interests with the unnamed members \nof the class. See Lerwill v. lnflight Motion Pictures, Inc., 582 F.2d 507,512 (9th Cir. 1978). \nImplicit in this standard is the requirement that a proposed named plaintiff must herself be a \nmember of the class she seeks to represent. Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393,403 (1975) (\"named \nplaintiff in a class action must show that the threat of injury in a case such as this is real and \nimmediate, not conjectural or hypothetical\") (internal quotations omitted). The burden is on the \ndefendant to show that representation will be inadequate. See G.A. Enterprises, Inc. v. Leisure \nLiving Communities, Inc., 511 F.2d 24, 26 n.3 (1st Cir. 1975) (standards for assessing adequacy \nof representation under Rule 23(a)(4) and Rule 23.1 are \"essentially the same\"). \nDefendant does not dispute that Plaintiffs and the proposed class are adequately \nrepresented by counsel, nor does it contend that the Plaintiffs have antagonistic or conflicting \ninterests with unnamed members of this putative class. Instead, Defendant challenges the \nstanding of each named plaintiff, claiming that Ms. Blake, Ms. Johnson, and Mr. Logan are not \n\"involuntarily\" homeless and thus have presented only a hypothetical threat of injury. Based on \nthe facts alleged by Plaintiffs, this Court finds Defendant's attack unsupported and contrary to \nHUD's definition of homelessness. \nDefendant challenges the standing of Ms. Blake, Ms. Johnson, and Mr. Logan by \ncontending that \"none of the named plaintiffs have any real or immediate risk of being exposed\" \nto move-along orders or citations under the anti-sleeping, anti-camping, and parks anti-camping \nordinances. Def. Resp. to Plf. Mot. for Class Cert. at 27 (#37). The crux of Defendant's \nchallenge to Plaintiff's standing rests on a series of accusatory hypothetical questions by which \n11 \n\nDefendant suggests that Plaintiffs have either voluntarily forgone the comforts of a private home \nor elected to sleep in areas where they knew citations were possible. Not only are these personal \nattacks on Plaintiffs' situations insensitive, they reveal that Defendant may misunderstand the \nnature of modem homelessness. \nAs discussed above, each of Plaintiffs' alleged situations falls under the definition of \nhomelessness set forth by HUD. Ms. Blake is beyond her allotted stay in a transitional housing \n,r,r \nprogram and may soon be on the street again. Blake Supp. Deel.  2-4 (#43). Ms. Johnson and \nMr. Logan have no permanent residence and regularly sleep in their vehicles.  Johnson Supp. \nDeel. 'if 5 (#27); Logan Supp. Deel. ,r,r 4-6 (#44).  Sleeping in a vehicle is considered \"camping\" \nunder the ordinances at issue in this case. GPMC 5.61.010; GPMC 6.46.090. Given their \nsituations, all three named plaintiffs face a real and imminent risk of being cited for sleeping or \nresting in streets, alleyways, parks, or other public areas of Grants Pass. Thus, Plaintiffs have \nstanding to represent this class. Moreover, because Defendant does not otherwise allege that \nPlaintiffs have conflicting interests with the proposed class, this Court finds that Plaintiffs and \ntheir counsel are adequate representatives for the putative class. \nB.  Plaintiffs meet the standard for certification under Rule 23(b) (2). \nIn addition to the prerequisites of Rule 23(a), Plaintiffs must also satisfy one section of \nRule 23(b )(2) to obtain class certification. Where the relief requested is solely declaratory and \ninjunctive, class certification is proper under Rule 23(b) (2) \"when a single injunction or \ndeclaratory judgement would provide final relief to each member of the class.\" Wal-Mart, 564 \nU.S. at 360. Furthermore, in situations in which the defendant is alleged to have acted on \ngrounds applicable to all class members, this Court has held that Rule 23(b )(2) certification is \nappropriate. See, e.g., Lane v. Kitzhaber, 283 F.R.D. 587, 600-02 (D. Or. 2012). \nPlaintiffs' requested injunctive and declaratory relief would provide final relief to each \nmember of the class. Each member of the proposed class is at risk of having the challenged \n12 \n\nordinances enforced against him or her. Thus, Defendant's alleged conduct-punishing homeless \nindividuals for engaging in activities necessary to sustain life-applies equally to all class \nmembers. Furthermore, this Court is satisfied that a judgement in this case for either party will \nresolve the matter for all members of the class. Therefore, Plaintiffs meet the standard for \ncertification under Rule 23(b) (2). \nORDER \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification (#25) is GRANTED. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n13 ",

Detroit Timber & Lumber  Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337. \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \nSyllabus  \nCITY  OF  GRANTS  PASS,  OREGON v. JOHNSON ET AL.,  \nON  BEHALF  OF  THEMSELVES  AND  ALL  OTHERS  \nSIMILARLY  SITUATED  \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \nTHE NINTH CIRCUIT  \nNo. 23–175.  Argued April 22, 2024—Decided June 28, 2024  \nGrants Pass, Oregon, is home to roughly 38,000 people, about 600 of \nwhom are estimated to experience homelessness on a given day. Like \nmany local governments across the Nation, Grants Pass has public-\ncamping laws that restrict encampments on public property.  The \nGrants Pass Municipal Code prohibits activities such  as camping on \npublic  property  or  parking  overnight  in  the  city’s   parks.    See  \n§§5.61.030, 6.46.090(A)–(B).  Initial violations can trigger  a fine, while \nmultiple violations can result in imprisonment. In a prior decision, \nMartin  v.  Boise, the Ninth Circuit held that the Eighth Amendment’s \nCruel and Unusual Punishments Clause bars cities from enforcing \npublic-camping ordinances like these against homeless individuals  \nwhenever the number of homeless individuals in a jurisdiction exceeds \nthe number of “practically available” shelter beds.  920 F. 3d 584, 617.   \nAfter Martin, suits against Western cities like Grants Pass prolifer-\nated. \n     Plaintiffs (respondents here) filed a putative class action on behalf \nof homeless people living in Grants Pass, claiming that the city’s ordi-\nnances against public camping violated the Eighth Amendment.  The \ndistrict court  certified the class and entered a  Martin  injunction pro-\nhibiting Grants Pass from enforcing its laws against homeless individ-\nuals in the city.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a–183a.  Applying  Martin’s  \nreasoning, the district court  found everyone without shelter in Grants \nPass was “involuntarily homeless” because the city’s total homeless  \npopulation outnumbered its “practically available” shelter beds. App.  \n \n\n2  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nSyllabus  \nto Pet. for Cert. 179a, 216a.  The beds at Grants Pass’s charity-run \nshelter did not qualify as “available” in part because that shelter has  \nrules requiring residents to abstain from smoking and to attend reli-\ngious services.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 179a–180a.  A divided panel of \nthe Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s  Martin  injunction in rel-\nevant part.  72 F. 4th 868, 874–896.  Grants Pass filed a petition for  \ncertiorari.  Many States, cities, and counties from across the Ninth Cir-\ncuit urged the Court to grant review to assess Martin. \nHeld:  The enforcement of  generally applicable laws regulating camping \non public property does not constitute “cruel and unusual punishment” \nprohibited by the Eighth Amendment.  Pp. 15–35.  \n   (a) The  Eighth  Amendment’s  Cruel  and  Unusual  Punishments \nClause “has always  been  considered, and properly so, to be directed at \nthe method or kind of punishment” a government may “impos[e] for \nthe violation of criminal statutes.”  Powell v. Texas, 392 U. S. 514, 531– \n532 (plurality opinion).  It was adopted to ensure that the new Nation \nwould never resort to certain “formerly tolerated” punishments consid-\nered “cruel” because they were calculated to “ ‘superad[d]’ ”  “ ‘terror, \n     \npain, or disgrace,’ ” and considered “unusual” because, by the time of \n \nthe Amendment’s adoption, they had “long fallen out of use.”  Bucklew  \nv. Precythe, 587 U. S 119, 130.  All that would seem to make the Eighth \nAmendment a poor foundation on which to rest the kind of decree the \nplaintiffs seek in this case and the Ninth Circuit has endorsed since \nMartin.  The  Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause  focuses on the \nquestion what “method or kind of punishment” a government may im-\npose after  a criminal conviction, not on the question whether a govern-\nment may criminalize particular behavior in the first place.  Powell, \n392 U. S., at 531–532.   \n   The Court cannot say that the punishments Grants Pass imposes \nhere qualify as cruel and unusual.  The city imposes only limited fines \nfor first-time offenders, an order temporarily barring an individual \nfrom camping in a public park for repeat offenders, and a maximum \nsentence of 30 days in jail for those who later violate an order.  See  \nOre. Rev. Stat. §§164.245, 161.615(3).  Such punishments do not qual-\nify as cruel because they are not designed to “superad[d]” “terror, pain, \nor disgrace.”   Bucklew, 587 U. S., at 130 (internal quotation marks  \nomitted).  Nor are they unusual, because similarly limited fines and \njail terms have been and remain among “the usual mode[s]” for pun-\nishing criminal offenses throughout the country.  Pervear v. Common-\nwealth, 5 Wall. 475, 480. Indeed, cities and States across the country \nhave long employed similar punishments for similar offenses.  Pp. 15–\n17.  \n   (b) Plaintiffs do not meaningfully dispute that, on its face, the Cruel \nand Unusual Punishments Clause does not speak to questions like \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  3 \n \nSyllabus  \nwhat a State may criminalize or how it may go about securing a con-\nviction. Like the Ninth Circuit in Martin, plaintiffs point to Robinson  \nv. California, 370 U. S. 660, as a notable exception. In  Robinson, the \nCourt held that under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, \nCalifornia could not enforce a law providing  that “‘[n]o person shall . . . \nbe addicted to the use of narcotics.’”  Id., at 660, n 1.  While California  \ncould not make “the ‘status’  of narcotic addiction a criminal offense,”  \nid., at 666, the Court emphasized that it did not mean to cast doubt on \nthe States’ “broad power” to prohibit behavior even by those, like the\ndefendant, who suffer from addiction.  Id., at 664, 667–668.  The prob-\nlem, as the Court saw it, was that California’s law made the status of  \nbeing an addict a crime.  Id.,  at 666–667  The Court read the Cruel and \nUnusual Punishments Clause (in a way  unprecedented in 1962) to im-\npose a limit on what a State may criminalize.  In dissent, Justice White  \nlamented that the majority had embraced an “application of ‘cruel and \nunusual punishment’ so  novel that” it could not possibly be “ascribe[d] \nto the Framers of the Constitution.”  370 U. S., at 689. The Court has  \nnot applied Robinson in that way since.  \n   Whatever its  persuasive force as an interpretation of the Eighth \nAmendment, Robinson cannot sustain the Ninth Circuit’s  Martin pro-\nject.  Robinson expressly recognized the “broad power” States enjoy \nover the substance of  their criminal laws, stressing that they may \ncriminalize knowing or intentional drug use even by those suffering \nfrom addiction.  370 U. S., at 664, 666.  The Court held that California’s  \nstatute offended the Eighth Amendment only because it criminalized \naddiction as a status.  Ibid.  \n   Grants Pass’s  public-camping ordinances do not criminalize status.  \nThe public-camping laws prohibit actions undertaken by any person, \nregardless of status.  It makes no difference whether the  charged de-\nfendant is currently a person  experiencing homelessness, a backpacker \non vacation, or a student who abandons his dorm room to camp out in \nprotest on the lawn of a municipal building.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 159.   \nBecause the public-camping laws in this case do not criminalize status,  \nRobinson is not implicated.  Pp. 17–21. \n   (c) Plaintiffs insist the Court should extend Robinson to prohibit the\nenforcement of laws that proscribe certain  acts that are in some sense \n“involuntary,” because some homeless individuals cannot help but do \nwhat the law forbids.  See Brief for Respondents 24–25, 29, 32.  The  \nNinth Circuit pursued this line of thinking below and in  Martin, but \nthis Court already rejected it in Powell v. Texas, 392 U. S. 514.  In  \nPowell, the Court confronted a defendant who had been convicted un-\nder a Texas statute making it a crime to “ ‘get drunk or  be found in a \nstate of intoxication in any  public place.’ ”  Id., at 517 (plurality opin-\nion). Like the plaintiffs here, Powell argued that his  drunkenness was \n \n\n4  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nSyllabus  \nan “‘involuntary’” byproduct of his status  as an alcoholic.  Id., at 533.   \nThe Court did not agree that Texas’s law effectively criminalized Pow-\nell’s status as an alcoholic.  Writing for a  plurality, Justice Marshall  \nobserved that Robinson’s “very small” intrusion “into the substantive \ncriminal law” prevents States only from enforcing laws that criminal-\nize “a mere status.”  Id., at 532–533. It does  nothing to curtail a State’s  \nauthority to secure a conviction when “the accused has committed  \nsome act . . . society has an interest in preventing.”   Id., at 533.  That  \nremains true, Justice Marshall continued, even if the defendant’s con-\nduct might, “in some sense” be described as “ ‘involuntary’ or ‘occa-\nsioned by’” a particular status.  Ibid. \n   This case is no different.  Just as  in  Powell, plaintiffs  here seek to \nextend Robinson’s rule beyond laws addressing “mere status” to laws  \naddressing actions that, even if undertaken with the requisite mens  \nrea, might “in some sense” qualify as “ ‘involuntary.’ ”  And as in Pow-\nell, the Court can find nothing in the Eighth Amendment permitting  \nthat course.  Instead, a variety of other legal doctrines and constitu-\ntional provisions work to protect those in the criminal justice system \nfrom a conviction.  Pp. 21–24. \n   (d) Powell  not only declined to extend Robinson to “involuntary” acts  \nbut also stressed the dangers of doing so.  Extending  Robinson to cover \ninvoluntary  acts  would,  Justice  Marshall  observed,    effectively  \n“impe[l]” this Court “into defining” something akin to a new “insanity  \ntest in constitutional terms.”  Powell, 392 U. S., at 536.  That is because  \nan individual like the defendant in Powell does not dispute that he has \ncommitted an otherwise criminal act with the requisite mens rea, yet\nhe seeks to be excused from “moral accountability” because of his “‘con-\ndition. ’”  Id., at 535–536.  Instead, Justice Marshall reasoned, such  \nmatters should be left for resolution through the democratic process, \nand not by “freez[ing]” any  particular, judicially preferred approach \n“into a rigid constitutional mold.”  Id., at 537.  The Court echoed that \nlast point in Kahler v.  Kansas, 589 U. S. 271, in which the Court \nstressed that questions about whether an  individual who committed a \nproscribed act with the requisite mental state should be “reliev[ed of] \nresponsibility,”  id., at 283, due to a lack of “moral culpability,” id., at \n286, are generally best resolved by the people and their elected repre-\nsentatives.  \n   Though doubtless well intended, the Ninth Circuit’s  Martin experi-\nment defied these lessons.  Answers to questions such as what consti-\ntutes “involuntarily” homelessness or when a shelter is “practically \navailable” cannot be found in the Cruel and Unusual Punishments \nClause.  Nor do federal judges enjoy any special competence to provide \nthem.  Cities  across the West report that the Ninth Circuit’s involun-\n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  5 \n \nSyllabus  \ntariness test has created intolerable uncertainty for them.  By extend-\ning Robinson beyond the narrow class of pure status crimes, the Ninth \nCircuit has created a right that has  proven “impossible” for judges to\ndelineate except “by fiat.”  Powell, 392 U. S., at 534.  As Justice Mar-\nshall anticipated in Powell, the Ninth Circuit’s rules have produced \nconfusion and they have interfered with “essential considerations of \nfederalism,” by taking from the people and their elected leaders diffi-\ncult questions traditionally “thought to be the[ir] province.”  Id., at  \n535–536.  Pp. 24–34. \n   (e) Homelessness is complex.  Its causes are many.  So may be the \npublic policy responses required to address it.  The question this case \npresents is whether the Eighth Amendment grants federal judges pri-\nmary responsibility for assessing those causes and devising those re-\nsponses.  A handful of federal judges  cannot begin to “match” the col-\nlective wisdom the American people possess in deciding “how best to \nhandle” a pressing social question like homelessness.   Robinson, 370  \nU. S., at 689 (White, J., dissenting).  The Constitution’s Eighth Amend-\nment serves many important functions, but it does not  authorize fed-\neral judges to  wrest those rights and responsibilities from the Ameri-\ncan people and in their place dictate this Nation’s homelessness policy.  \nPp. 34–35. \n72 F. 4th 868, reversed and remanded. \nGORSUCH, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,  \nC.

The causes are varied and complex, the appro-\npriate public policy responses perhaps no less so.  Like  \nmany local governments, the city of Grants Pass, Oregon, \nhas pursued a multifaceted approach.  Recently, it adopted \nvarious policies aimed at “protecting the rights, dignity[,] \nand private property of the homeless.”  App. 152.  It ap-\npointed  a  “homeless  community  liaison”  officer  charged \nwith ensuring the homeless receive information about “as-\nsistance programs and other resources” available to them \nthrough the city and its local shelter. Id., at 152–153; Brief \nfor Grants Pass Gospel Rescue Mission as Amicus Curiae  \n2–3.  And it adopted certain restrictions against encamp-\nments on public property.  App. 155–156.  The Ninth Cir-\ncuit, however, held that the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and \nUnusual Punishments Clause barred that last measure.  \nWith support from States and cities across the country, \nGrants Pass urged this Court to review the Ninth Circuit’s \ndecision.  We take up that task now.  \n \n\n2  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nOpinion of the Court \nI \nA \n  Some suggest that homelessness may be the “defining \npublic  health  and  safety  crisis  in  the  western  United\nStates” today.  72 F. 4th 868, 934 (CA9 2023) (Smith, J., \ndissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  According to \nthe federal government, homelessness in this country has \nreached its highest levels since the government began re-\nporting data on the subject in 2007.  Dept. of Housing and \nUrban Development, Office of Community Planning & De-\nvelopment, T. de Sousa et al., The 2023 Annual Homeless \nAssessment Report (AHAR) to Congress 2–3 (2023).  Cali-\nfornia alone is home to around half of those in this Nation \nliving without shelter on a given night. Id., at 30.  And each  \nof the five States with the highest rates of unsheltered \nhomelessness in the country—California, Oregon, Hawaii, \nArizona, and Nevada—lies in the American West.  Id., at \n17. \n  Those experiencing homelessness may be as diverse as \nthe Nation itself—they are young and old and belong to all \nraces and creeds.  People become homeless for a variety of \nreasons, too, many beyond their control.  Some have been  \naffected by economic conditions, rising housing costs, or \nnatural disasters.  Id., at 37; see Brief for United States as  \nAmicus Curiae 2–3.  Some have been forced from their \nhomes to escape domestic violence and other forms of ex-\nploitation.  Ibid.  And still others struggle with drug addic-\ntion and mental illness.  By one estimate, perhaps 78 per-\ncent of the unsheltered suffer from mental-health issues, \nwhile 75 percent struggle with substance abuse.  See J.  \nRountree, N. Hess, & A. Lyke, Health Conditions Among \nUnsheltered Adults in the U. S., Calif. Policy Lab, Policy \nBrief 5 (2019).\n  Those  living  without  shelter  often  live  together.

As the number of \nhomeless individuals has grown, the number of homeless \nencampments across the country has increased as well, “in\nnumbers not seen in almost a century.”   Ibid.  The unshel-\ntered may coalesce in these encampments for a range of rea-\nsons.  Some value the “freedom” encampment living pro-\nvides  compared  with  submitting  to  the  rules  shelters  \nimpose.

Khadduri, Understanding Encampments of People Ex-\nperiencing  Homelessness  and  Community  Responses  5  \n(2019).  Others report that encampments offer a “sense of\ncommunity.”  Id., at 7.   And still others may seek them out \nfor “dependable access to illegal drugs.”  Ibid.  In brief, the  \nreasons why someone will go without shelter on a given \nnight vary widely by the person and by the day.  See ibid. \n  As  the  number  and  size  of  these  encampments  have \ngrown, so have the challenges they can pose for the home-\nless and others.  We are told, for example, that the “expo-\nnential increase in . . . encampments in recent years has re-\nsulted in an increase in crimes both against the homeless \nand by the homeless.”  Brief for California State Sheriffs’ \nAssociations et al. as  Amici Curiae 21 (California Sheriffs \nBrief ).  California’s Governor reports that encampment in-\n \nhabitants  face  heightened  risks  of  “sexual  assault”  and \n“subjugation to sex work.”  Brief for California Governor G. \nNewsom as Amicus Curiae 11 (California Governor Brief ).  \n \nAnd by one estimate, more than 40 percent of the shootings \nin Seattle in early 2022 were linked to homeless encamp-\nments.  Brief for Washington State Association of Sheriffs \nand Police Chiefs as Amicus Curiae on Pet. for Cert. 10  \n(Washington Sheriffs Brief ). \n \n  Other challenges have arisen as well.  Some city officials\nindicate that encampments facilitate the distribution of  \n \n\n4  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nOpinion of the Court \ndrugs like heroin and fentanyl, which have claimed the \nlives of so many Americans in recent years.  Brief for Office \nof the San Diego County District Attorney as Amicus Curiae  \n17–19.  Without running water or proper sanitation facili-\nties, too, diseases can sometimes spread in encampments \nand beyond them.  Various States say that they have seen \ntyphus, shigella, trench fever, and other diseases reemerge \non their city streets.  California Governor Brief 12; Brief for  \nIdaho et al. as Amici Curiae 7 (States Brief ).\n \n  Nor do problems like these affect everyone equally.  Of-\nten, encampments are found in a city’s “poorest and most \nvulnerable neighborhoods.”  Brief for City and County of \nSan Francisco et al. as Amici Curiae on Pet. for Cert. 5 (San \nFrancisco Cert. Brief ); see also 2020 HUD Report 9.  With  \n \nencampments dotting neighborhood sidewalks, adults and \nchildren in these communities are sometimes forced to nav-\nigate around used needles, human waste, and other haz-\nards to make their way to school, the grocery store, or work.  \nSan Francisco Cert. Brief 5; States Brief 8; California Gov-\nernor Brief 11–12.  Those with physical disabilities report \nthis can pose a special challenge for them, as they may lack \nthe mobility to maneuver safely around the encampments.  \nSan Francisco Cert. Brief 5; see also Brief for Tiana Tozer \net al. as Amici Curiae 1–6 (Tozer Brief ).\n \n  Communities of all sizes are grappling with how best to \naddress challenges like these.  As they have throughout the \nNation’s  history,  charitable  organizations  “serve  as  the \nbackbone of the emergency shelter system in this country,” \naccounting for roughly 40 percent of the country’s shelter \nbeds for single adults on a given night.  See National Alli-\nance  To  End  Homelessness,  Faith-Based  Organizations:  \nFundamental Partners in Ending Homelessness 1 (2017).  \nMany private organizations, city officials, and States have \nworked, as well, to increase the availability of affordable \nhousing in order to provide more permanent shelter for \nthose in need.  See Brief for Local Government Legal Center \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  5 \n \nOpinion of the Court \net al. as Amici Curiae 4, 32 (Cities Brief ).  But many, too, \n \nhave come to the conclusion that, as they put it, “[j]ust \nbuilding more shelter beds and public housing options is al-\nmost certainly not the answer by itself.”  Id., at 11. \n  As many cities see it, even as they have expanded shelter \ncapacity and other public services, their unsheltered popu-\nlations have continued to grow.  Id., at 9–11.  The city of\nSeattle, for example, reports that roughly 60 percent of its \noffers of shelter have been rejected in a recent year.  See id.,  \nat 28, and n. 26.  Officials in Portland, Oregon, indicate \nthat, between April 2022 and January 2024, over 70 percent \nof their approximately 3,500 offers of shelter beds to home-\nless individuals were declined.  Brief for League of Oregon  \nCities et al. as Amici Curiae 5 (Oregon Cities Brief ).  Other \n \ncities tell us that “the vast majority of their homeless popu-\nlations are not actively seeking shelter and refuse all ser-\nvices.” Brief for Thirteen California Cities as Amici Curiae  \n3. Surveys cited by the Department of Justice suggest that \nonly “25–41 percent” of “homeless encampment residents” \n“willingly” accept offers of shelter beds.  See Dept. of Jus-\ntice, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, S. \nChamard, Homeless Encampments 36 (2010). \n  The reasons why the unsheltered sometimes reject offers \nof assistance may themselves be many and complex.  Some  \nmay reject shelter because accepting it would take them \nfurther from family and local ties.  See Brief for 57 Social \nScientists as Amici Curiae 20.  Some may decline  offers of  \nassistance because of concerns for their safety or the rules\nsome shelters impose regarding curfews, drug use, or reli-\ngious practices.  Id., at 22; see Cities Brief 29.  Other factors \nmay also be at play. But whatever the causes, local govern-\nments say, this dynamic significantly complicates their ef-\nforts to address the challenges of homelessness.  See id., at \n11. \n  Rather than focus on a single policy to meet the chal-\n \n\n6  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nOpinion of the Court \nlenges associated with  homelessness, many States and cit-\nies have pursued a range of policies and programs.  See \n2020 HUD Report 14–20.  Beyond expanding shelter and \naffordable housing opportunities, some have reinvested in\nmental-health and substance-abuse treatment programs.  \nSee Brief for California State Association of Counties et al.  \nas Amici Curiae 20, 25; see also 2020 HUD Report 23.  Some \nhave trained their employees in outreach tactics designed \nto improve relations between governments and the home-\nless they serve.  Ibid.   And still others have chosen to pair\nthese efforts with the enforcement of laws that restrict  \ncamping in public places, like parks, streets, and sidewalks.  \nCities Brief 11. \n  Laws like those are commonplace.  By one count, “a ma-\njority  of  cities  have  laws  restricting  camping  in  public \nspaces,” and nearly forty percent “have one or more laws \nprohibiting camping citywide.”  See Brief for Western Re-\ngional Advocacy Project as Amicus Curiae 7, n.  15 (empha-\nsis deleted).  Some have argued that the enforcement of \nthese laws can create a “revolving door that circulates indi-\nviduals experiencing homelessness from the street to the \ncriminal justice system and back.”  U. S. Interagency Coun-\ncil on Homelessness, Searching Out Solutions 6 (2012).  But \nmany cities take a different view.  According to the National \nLeague of Cities (a group that represents more than 19,000 \nAmerican cities and towns), the National Association of \nCounties (which represents the Nation’s 3,069 counties)\nand others across the American West, these public-camping \nregulations are not usually deployed as a front-line re-\nsponse “to criminalize homelessness.”  Cities Brief 11.  In-\nstead, they are used to provide city employees with the legal \nauthority to address “encampments that pose significant \nhealth and safety risks” and to encourage their inhabitants\nto accept other alternatives  like  shelters, drug  treatment  \nprograms,  and  mental-health facilities.  Ibid.  \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  7 \n \nOpinion of the Court \n  Cities are not alone in pursuing this approach.  The fed-\neral government also restricts “the storage of . . . sleeping \nbags,” as well as other “sleeping activities,” on park lands.  \n36 CFR §§7.96(i), (j)(1) (2023).  And it, too, has exercised \nthat authority to clear certain “dangerous” encampments.  \nNational Park Service, Record of Determination for Clear-\ning the Unsheltered Encampment at McPherson Square\nand Temporary Park Closure for Rehabilitation (Feb. 13, \n2023).\n  Different governments may use these laws in different\nways and to varying degrees.  See Cities Brief 11.  But many\nbroadly agree that “policymakers need access to the full \npanoply of tools in the policy toolbox” to “tackle the compli-\ncated issues of housing and homelessness.” California Gov-\nernor Brief 16; accord, Cities Brief 11; Oregon Cities Brief \n17.  \nB \n  Five years ago, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit took one of those tools off the table.  In Martin v. \nBoise, 920 F. 3d 584 (2019), that court considered a public-\ncamping ordinance in Boise, Idaho, that made it a misde-\nmeanor to use “streets, sidewalks, parks, or public places” \nfor “camping.”  Id., at 603 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted).  According to the Ninth Circuit, the Eighth Amend-\nment’s  Cruel  and  Unusual  Punishments  Clause  barred \nBoise from  enforcing its public-camping ordinance against \nhomeless  individuals  who  lacked  “access  to  alternative \nshelter.”  Id., at 615.  That “access” was lacking, the court \nsaid, whenever “‘there is a greater number of homeless in-\n \ndividuals in a jurisdiction than the number of available \nbeds in shelters.’”  Id., at 617 (alterations omitted). Accord-\n \ning to the Ninth Circuit, nearly three quarters of Boise’s \nshelter beds were not “practically available”  because the \ncity’s charitable shelters had a “religious atmosphere.”  Id.,  \nat 609–610, 618.  Boise was thus enjoined from enforcing \n \n\n8  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nOpinion of the Court \nits camping laws against the plaintiffs.  Ibid.  \n  No other circuit has followed Martin’s lead with respect \nto public-camping laws.  Nor did the decision go unre-\nmarked within the Ninth Circuit.  When the full court de-\nnied rehearing en banc, several judges wrote separately to \nnote their dissent. In one statement, Judge Bennett argued \nthat Martin was inconsistent with the Cruel and Unusual  \nPunishments Clause.  That provision, Judge Bennett con-\ntended, prohibits certain methods of punishment a govern-\nment may impose after a criminal conviction, but it does not \n“impose [any] substantive limits on what conduct a state \nmay criminalize.” 920 F. 3d, at 599–602.  In another state-\nment, Judge Smith lamented that Martin had “shackle[d] \nthe hands of public officials trying to redress the serious so-\ncietal concern of homelessness.”  Id., at 590.  He predicted \nthe decision would “wrea[k] havoc on local governments, \nresidents, and businesses” across the American West.  Ibid. \n  After Martin, similar suits proliferated against Western \ncities within the Ninth Circuit.  As Judge Smith put it, “[i]f \none picks up a map of the western United States and points \nto a city that appears on it, there is a good chance that city \nhas already faced” a judicial injunction based on Martin or  \nthe threat of one “in the few short years since [the Ninth \nCircuit] initiated its Martin experiment.”  72 F. 4th, at 940;  \nsee, e.g., Boyd v. San Rafael, 2023 WL 7283885, *1–*2 (ND \nCal., Nov. 2, 2023); Fund for Empowerment v. Phoenix, 646  \nF. Supp. 3d 1117, 1132 (Ariz. 2022); Warren v.  Chico, 2021 \nWL 2894648, *3 (ED Cal., July 8, 2021). \n  Consider  San  Francisco,  where  each  night  thousands \nsleep “in tents and other makeshift structures.”  Brief for  \nCity and County of San Francisco et al. as  Amici Curiae 8 \n(San Francisco Brief ).  Applying Martin, a district court en-\n \ntered an injunction barring the city from enforcing “laws \nand ordinances to prohibit involuntarily homeless individ-\nuals from sitting, lying, or sleeping on public property.” Co-\nalition on Homelessness v.  San Francisco, 647 F. Supp. 3d  \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  9 \n \nOpinion of the Court \n806,  841  (ND  Cal.  2022).    That  “misapplication  of  this \nCourt’s Eighth Amendment precedents,” the Mayor tells us, \nhas “severely constrained San Francisco’s ability to address \nthe homelessness crisis.”  San Francisco Brief 7.  The city \n“uses enforcement of its laws prohibiting camping” not to \ncriminalize  homelessness,  but  “as  one  important  tool\namong others to encourage individuals experiencing home-\nlessness to accept services and to help ensure safe and ac-\ncessible sidewalks and public spaces.”  Id., at 7–8.  Judicial \nintervention restricting the use of that tool, the Mayor con-\ntinues, “has led to painful results on the streets and in  \nneighborhoods.” Id., at 8.  “San Francisco has seen over half \nof its offers of shelter and services rejected by unhoused in-\ndividuals, who often cite” the Martin order against the city \n“as their justification to permanently occupy and block pub-\nlic sidewalks.”  Id., at 8–9. \n  An exceptionally large number of cities and States have \nfiled briefs in this Court reporting experiences like San \nFrancisco’s.  In the judgment of many of them, the Ninth\nCircuit has inappropriately “limit[ed] the tools available to \nlocal governments for tackling [what is a] complex and dif-\nficult human issue.”  Oregon Cities Brief 2.  The threat of \nMartin injunctions, they say, has “paralyze[d]” even com-\nmonsense and good-faith efforts at addressing homeless-\nness.  Brief for City of Phoenix et al. as Amici Curiae 36  \n(Phoenix Brief ).  The Ninth Circuit’s intervention, they in-\n \nsist, has prevented local governments from pursuing “effec-\ntive solutions to this humanitarian crisis while simultane-\nously protecting the remaining community’s right to safely \nenjoy public spaces.”  Brief for  International Municipal\nLawyers Association et al. as  Amici Curiae on Pet. for Cert. \n27 (Cities Cert. Brief ); States Brief 11 (“State and local gov-\n \nernments in the Ninth Circuit have attempted a variety of \nsolutions to address the problems that public encampments \ninflict on their communities,” only to have those “efforts . . . \nshut down by federal courts”).  \n \n\n10  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nOpinion of the Court \n  Many cities further report that, rather than help allevi-\nate the homelessness crisis, Martin injunctions have inad-\nvertently contributed to it.  The numbers of “[u]nsheltered \nhomelessness,” they represent, have “increased dramati-\ncally in the Ninth Circuit since Martin.”  Brief for League \nof Oregon Cities et al. as Amici Curiae  on Pet. for Cert. 7  \n(boldface and capitalization deleted).  And, they say, Martin  \ninjunctions have contributed to this trend by “weaken[ing]” \nthe ability of public officials “to persuade persons experienc-\ning homelessness to accept shelter beds and [other] ser-\nvices.”  Brief for Ten California Cities as Amici Curiae on  \nPet. for Cert. 2.  In Portland, for example, residents report \nsome unsheltered persons “often return within days” of an \nencampment’s clearing, on the understanding that “Martin  \n. . . and its progeny prohibit the [c]ity from implementing \nmore efficacious strategies.”  Tozer Brief 5; Washington\nSheriffs Brief 14 (Martin divests officers of the “ability to \ncompel [unsheltered] persons to leave encampments and \nobtain necessary services”).  In short, they say, Martin  \n“make[s] solving this crisis harder.”  Cities Cert. Brief 3.  \n  All acknowledge “[h]omelessness is a complex and serious \nsocial issue that cries out for effective . . . responses.”  Ibid.   \nBut many States and cities believe “it is crucial” for local \ngovernments to “have the latitude” to experiment and find \neffective responses. Id., at 27; States Brief 13–17.  “Injunc-\ntions and the threat of federal litigation,” they insist, “im-\npede  this  democratic  process,”  undermine  local  govern-\nments, and do not well serve the homeless or others who  \nlive in the Ninth Circuit.  Cities Cert. Brief 27–28. \nC \n  The case before us arises from a Martin  injunction issued \nagainst the city of Grants Pass.  Located on the banks of the  \nRogue River in southwestern Oregon, the city is home to \nroughly 38,000 people.  Among them are an estimated 600 \nindividuals who experience homelessness on a given day.   \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  11  \n \nOpinion of the Court \n72 F. 4th, at 874; App. to Pet. for Cert. 167a–168a; 212a–\n213a. \n  Like many American cities, Grants Pass has laws re-\nstricting camping in public spaces.  Three are relevant here.   \nThe first prohibits sleeping “on public sidewalks, streets, or \nalleyways.”  Grants  Pass  Municipal  Code  §5.61.020(A) \n(2023); App. to Pet. for Cert. 221a.  The second prohibits\n“[c]amping” on public property.  §5.61.030; App. to Pet. for\nCert.  222a  (boldface  deleted).  Camping  is  defined  as  \n“set[ting] up . . . or remain[ing] in or at a campsite,” and a \n“[c]ampsite” is defined as “any place where bedding, sleep-\ning bag[s], or other material used for bedding purposes, or \nany stove or fire is placed . . . for the purpose of  maintaining \na temporary place to live.”  §§5.61.010(A)–(B); App. to Pet. \nfor Cert. 221a.  The third prohibits “[c]amping” and “[o]ver-\nnight parking” in the city’s parks.  §§6.46.090(A)–(B); 72  \nF. 4th, at 876.  Penalties for violating these ordinances es-\ncalate stepwise.  An initial violation may trigger a fine.  \n§§1.36.010(I)–(J).  Those who receive multiple citations may\nbe subject to an order barring them from city parks for 30  \ndays.  §6.46.350; App. to Pet. for Cert. 174a.  And, in turn,  \nviolations of those orders can constitute criminal trespass, \npunishable by a maximum of 30 days in prison and a $1,250 \nfine.  Ore. Rev. Stat. §§164.245, 161.615(3), 161.635(1)(c) \n(2023).\n  Neither of the named plaintiffs before us has  been sub-\njected to an order barring them from city property or to \ncriminal trespass charges. Perhaps that is because the city\nhas traditionally taken a light-touch approach to enforce-\nment.  The city’s officers are directed “to provide law en-\nforcement services to all members of the community while \nprotecting the rights, dignity[,] and private property of the \nhomeless.”  App. 152, Grants Pass Dept. of Public Safety\nPolicy Manual ¶428.1.1 (Dec. 17, 2018).  Officers are in-\nstructed that “[h]omelessness is not a crime.”  Ibid.   And \nthey are “encouraged” to render “aid” and “support” to the  \n \n\n12  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nOpinion of the Court \nhomeless whenever possible.  Id., at 153, ¶428.3.1  \n  Still,  shortly  after  the  panel  decision  in  Martin,  two  \nhomeless individuals, Gloria Johnson and John Logan, filed \nsuit challenging the city’s public-camping laws.  App. 37, \nThird Amended Complaint ¶¶6–7.  They claimed, among \nother things, that the city’s ordinances violated the Eighth \nAmendment’s  Cruel  and  Unusual  Punishments  Clause.   \nId., at 51,  ¶66.  And they sought to pursue their claim on  \nbehalf of a class encompassing “all involuntarily homeless \npeople living in Grants Pass.”  Id., at 48, ¶52.2  \n  The district court certified the class action and enjoined \nthe city from enforcing its public-camping laws against the \nhomeless.  While Ms. Johnson and Mr. Logan generally \nsleep in their vehicles, the court held, they could adequately \nrepresent the class, for sleeping in a vehicle can sometimes \ncount  as  unlawful  “‘camping’”  under  the  relevant  ordi-\n   \nnances.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 219a (quoting Grants Pass \nMunicipal Code §5.61.010).  And, the court found, everyone  \n—————— \n1The dissent cites minutes from a community roundtable meeting to \n \nsuggest that officials in Grants Pass harbored only punitive motives  \nwhen adopting their camping ban.  Post, at 13–14 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR,  \nJ.).  But the dissent tells at best half the story about that meeting.  In  \nhis opening remarks, the Mayor stressed that the city’s goal was to “find \na balance between providing the help [homeless] people need and not en-\nabling . . . aggressive negative behavior” some community members had \nexperienced.  App. 112. And, by all accounts, the “purpose” of the meet-\ning was to “develo[p] strategies to . . . connect [homeless] people to ser-\n \nvices.”   Ibid.   The city manager and others explained that the city was  \ndealing with problems of “harassment” and “defecation in public places” \nby those who seemingly “do not want to receive services.”  Id., at 113, \n118–120.

App. to Pet.\n   \nfor Cert. 179a, 216a.  In fact, the court ruled, none of the  \nbeds  at  Grants  Pass’s  charity-run  shelter  qualified  as  \n“available.”  They did not, the court said, both because that \nshelter offers something closer to transitional housing than \n“temporary emergency shelter,” and because the shelter \nhas rules requiring residents to abstain from smoking and\nattend religious services.  Id., at 179a–180a.  The Eighth \nAmendment, the district court thus concluded, prohibited \nGrants Pass from enforcing its laws against homeless indi-\nviduals in the city.  Id., at 182a–183a. \n  A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed in relevant \npart.  72 F. 4th, at 874–896.  The majority agreed with the \ndistrict court that all unsheltered individuals in Grants \nPass qualify as “involuntarily homeless” because the city’s \nhomeless population exceeds “available” shelter beds.  Id., \nat 894.  And the majority further agreed that, under Mar-\ntin,  the homeless there cannot be punished for camping \nwith “rudimentary forms of protection from the elements.”  \n72 F. 4th, at 896.

S. ____ (2024)  15  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nII  \nA \n  The Constitution and its Amendments impose a number \nof limits on  what governments in this country may declare \nto be criminal behavior and how they may go about enforc-\ning their criminal laws.  Familiarly, the First Amendment \nprohibits governments from using their criminal laws to\nabridge the rights to speak, worship, assemble, petition, \nand exercise the freedom of the press.  The Equal Protection\nClause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  prevents  govern-\nments from adopting laws that invidiously discriminate be-\ntween persons.  The Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments ensure that officials  may not dis-\nplace certain rules associated with criminal liability that\nare “so old and venerable,” “‘so rooted in the traditions and  \n \nconscience of our people[,] as to be ranked as fundamental.’”  \n \nKahler v. Kansas, 589 U. S. 271, 279 (2020) (quoting Leland  \nv. Oregon, 343 U. S. 790, 798 (1952)).  The Fifth and Sixth  \nAmendments require prosecutors and courts to observe var-\nious procedures before denying any person of his liberty, \npromising for example that every person enjoys the right to \nconfront his accusers and have serious criminal charges re-\nsolved by a jury of his peers.  One could go on. \n  But if many other constitutional provisions address what \na government may criminalize and how it may go about se-\ncuring a conviction, the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition \nagainst “cruel and unusual punishments” focuses on what \nhappens next.  That Clause “has always been considered, \nand properly so, to be directed at the method or kind of pun-\nishment” a government may “impos[e] for the violation of \ncriminal statutes.” Powell v. Texas, 392 U. S. 514, 531–532  \n(1968) (plurality opinion).\n  We have previously discussed the Clause’s origins and \nmeaning.  In the 18th century, English law still “formally \ntolerated” certain barbaric punishments like “disembowel-\ning, quartering, public dissection, and burning alive,” even  \n \n\n16  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nOpinion of the Court \nthough those practices had by then “fallen into disuse.”   \nBucklew v. Precythe, 587 U. S. 119, 130 (2019) (citing 4  W. \nBlackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 370 \n(1769) (Blackstone)). The Cruel and Unusual Punishments  \nClause was adopted to ensure that the new Nation would \nnever resort to any of those punishments or others like \nthem.  Punishments like those were “cruel” because they \nwere  calculated  to  “‘superad[d]’”  “‘terror,  pain,  or  dis-\n     \ngrace.’” 587 U. S., at 130  (quoting 4 Blackstone 370). And \n \nthey were “unusual” because, by the time of the Amend-\nment’s adoption, they had “long fallen out of use.”  587 U. S.,  \nat 130. Perhaps some of those who framed our Constitution \nthought, as Justice Story did, that a guarantee against\nthose kinds of “atrocious” punishments would prove “unnec-\nessary” because no “free government” would ever employ \nanything like them.  3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Con-\nstitution of the United States §1896, p. 750 (1833).  But in  \nadopting  the  Eighth  Amendment,  the  framers  took   no \nchances. \n  All that would seem to make the Eighth Amendment a \npoor foundation on which to rest the kind of decree the \nplaintiffs seek in this case and the Ninth Circuit has en-\ndorsed since Martin. The Cruel and Unusual Punishments  \nClause focuses on the question what “method or kind of \npunishment” a government may impose after a criminal \nconviction, not on the question whether a government may \ncriminalize particular behavior in the first place or how it \nmay go about securing a conviction for that offense.  Powell, \n392  U. S.,  at  531–532.  To  the  extent  the  Constitution  \nspeaks to those other matters, it does so, as we have seen,  \nin other provisions. \n  Nor, focusing on the criminal punishments Grant Pass \nimposes, can we say they qualify as cruel and unusual.  Re-\ncall that, under the city’s ordinances, an initial offense may \ntrigger a civil fine.  Repeat offenses may trigger an order \ntemporarily barring an  individual from camping in a public  \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  17  \n \nOpinion of the Court \npark.  Only those who later violate an order like that may\nface a criminal punishment of up to 30 days in jail and a \nlarger fine.  See Part I–C, supra.  None of the city’s sanc-\ntions qualifies as cruel because none is designed to “su-\nperad[d]” “terror, pain, or disgrace.”   Bucklew, 587 U. S., at \n130 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Nor are the city’s\nsanctions unusual, because similar punishments have been \nand remain among “the usual mode[s]” for punishing of-\nfenses throughout the country.  Pervear v. Commonwealth, \n5 Wall. 475, 480 (1867); see 4 Blackstone 371–372; Timbs v. \nIndiana, 586 U. S. 146, 165 (2019)  (Thomas J., concurring \nin  judgment)  (describing  fines  as  “‘the  drudge-horse  of \n \ncriminal justice, probably the most common form of punish-\nment’” (some internal quotation marks omitted)).  In fact, \n \nlarge numbers of cities and States across the country have \nlong employed, and today employ, similar punishments for \nsimilar offenses.  See Part I–A, supra; Brief for Professor \nJohn F. Stinneford as Amicus Curiae 7–13 (collecting his-\ntorical and contemporary examples).  Notably, neither the \nplaintiffs nor the dissent meaningfully contests any of this.  \nSee Brief for Respondents 40.4  \nB \n  Instead, the plaintiffs and the dissent pursue an entirely \ndifferent theory.  They do not question that, by its terms, \nthe Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause speaks to the\nquestion what punishments may follow a criminal convic-\ntion, not to antecedent questions  like what a State may \ncriminalize or how it may go about securing a conviction.  \nYet, echoing the Ninth Circuit in  Martin,  they insist one\nnotable exception exists. \n—————— \n4This Court has never held that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments \n \nClause extends beyond criminal punishments to civil fines and orders, \nsee Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651, 666–668 (1977), nor does this case \npresent any occasion to do so for none of the city’s sanctions defy the  \nClause.  \n \n\n18  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nOpinion of the Court \nIn Robinson v. California, 370 U. S.  660 (1962), the plain-\ntiffs and the dissent observe, this Court addressed a chal-\nlenge to a criminal conviction under a California statute \nproviding that “‘[n]o person shall . . . be addicted to the use \n \nof narcotics.’”  Ibid., n. 1.  In response to that challenge, the\n \nCourt invoked the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause \nto hold that California could not enforce its law making “the \n‘status’ of narcotic addiction a criminal offense.”  Id., at 666.  \nThe Court recognized that “imprisonment for ninety days  is \nnot, in the abstract, a punishment which is either cruel or \nunusual.”  Id., at 667.  But, the Court reasoned, when pun-\nishing “‘status,’” “[e]ven one day in prison would be . . . \n   \ncruel and unusual.”  Id., at 666–667. \n  In doing so, the Court stressed the limits of its decision.  \nIt would have ruled differently, the Court said, if California \nhad sought to convict the defendant for, say, the knowing \nor intentional “use of narcotics, for their purchase, sale, or \npossession, or for antisocial or disorderly behavior resulting \nfrom their administration.”  Id., at 666.  In fact, the Court \ntook pains to emphasize that it did not mean to cast doubt \non the States’ “broad power” to prohibit behavior like that, \neven by those, like the  defendant, who suffered from addic-\ntion.  Id., at 664, 667–668.  The only problem, as the Court \nsaw it, was that California’s law did not operate that way.  \nInstead, it made the mere status of being an addict a crime.  \nId., at 666–667.  And it was that feature of the law, the \nCourt held, that went too far. \n  Reaching that conclusion under the banner of the Eighth \nAmendment may have come as a surprise to the litigants.  \nMr. Robinson challenged his conviction principally on the \nground that it offended the Fourteenth Amendment’s guar-\nantee of due process of law.  As he saw it, California’s law \nviolated due process because it purported to make unlawful \na “status” rather than the commission of any “volitional \nact.”  See Brief for Appellant in Robinson v. California, \nO. T. 1961, No. 61–554, p. 13 (Robinson Brief ). \n \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  19  \n \nOpinion of the Court \n  That framing may have made some sense.  Our due pro-\ncess jurisprudence has long taken guidance from the “set-\ntled usage[s] . . . in England and in this country.”  Hurtado  \nv. California, 110 U. S. 516, 528 (1884); see also Kahler, 589  \nU. S., at 279.  And, historically, crimes in England and this \ncountry have usually required proof of some act (or actus \nreus) undertaken with some measure of volition (mens rea).  \nAt  common  law,  “a  complete  crime”  generally  required \n“both a will and an act.”  4 Blackstone 21.  This view “took \ndeep and early root in American soil” where, to this day, a \ncrime ordinarily arises “only from concurrence of an evil-\nmeaning  mind  with  an  evil-doing  hand.”    Morissette  v.  \nUnited States, 342 U. S. 246, 251–252 (1952).  Measured \nagainst these standards, California’s law was an anomaly, \nas it required proof of neither of those things. \n  Mr. Robinson’s resort to the Eighth Amendment was \ncomparatively brief.  He referenced it only in passing, and \nonly for the proposition that forcing a drug addict like him-\nself to go “‘cold turkey’” in a jail cell after conviction en-\n   \ntailed such “intense mental and physical torment” that it \nwas akin to “the burning of witches at the stake.”  Robinson \nBrief 30. The State responded to that argument with barely\na paragraph of analysis, Brief for Appellee in  Robinson v.  \nCalifornia, O. T. 1961, No. 61–554, pp. 22–23, and it re-\nceived virtually no attention at oral argument.  By almost \nevery indication, then, Robinson was set to be a case about \nthe scope of the Due Process Clause, or perhaps an Eighth \nAmendment case about whether forcing an addict to with-\ndraw from drugs after conviction qualified as cruel and un-\nusual punishment. \n  Of course, the case turned out differently.  Bypassing Mr. \nRobinson’s  primary  Due  Process  Clause  argument,  the \nCourt charted its own course, reading the Cruel and Unu-\nsual Punishments Clause to impose a limit not just on what \npunishments may follow a criminal conviction but what a  \n \n\n20  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nOpinion of the Court \nState may criminalize to begin with.  It was a view unprec-\nedented in the history of the Court before 1962.  In dissent,  \nJustice White lamented that the majority had embraced an \n“application of ‘cruel and unusual punishment’ so novel \nthat” it could not possibly be “ascribe[d] to the Framers of \nthe Constitution.”  370 U. S., at 689.  Nor, in the 62 years\nsince Robinson, has this Court once invoked it as authority\nto decline the enforcement of any criminal law, leaving the \nEighth Amendment instead to perform its traditional func-\ntion of addressing the punishments that follow a criminal \nconviction. \n  Still, no one has asked us to reconsider Robinson. Nor do  \nwe see any need to do so today.  Whatever its persuasive \nforce as an interpretation of the Eighth Amendment, it can-\nnot sustain the Ninth Circuit’s course since Martin. In Rob-\ninson, the Court  expressly recognized the “broad power” \nStates  enjoy  over  the  substance  of  their  criminal  laws, \nstressing that they may criminalize knowing or intentional\ndrug use even by those suffering from addiction.  370 U. S.,  \nat 664, 666.  The Court held only that a State may not crim-\ninalize the “‘status’” of being an addict.  Id., at 666.  In crim-\n   \ninalizing a mere status, Robinson stressed, California had \ntaken a historically anomalous approach toward criminal \nliability. One, in fact, this Court has not encountered since \nRobinson itself.  \n  Public camping ordinances like those before us are noth-\ning like the law at issue in Robinson.  Rather than crimi-\nnalize mere status, Grants Pass forbids actions like “oc-\ncupy[ing] a campsite” on public property “for the purpose of \nmaintaining a temporary place to live.”  Grants Pass Mu-\nnicipal Code §§5.61.030, 5.61.010; App. to Pet. for Cert. \n221a–222a.  Under the city’s laws, it makes no difference \nwhether the charged defendant is homeless, a backpacker \non vacation passing through town, or a student who aban-\ndons his dorm room to camp out in protest on the lawn of a \nmunicipal building.  See Part I–C, supra; Blake v. Grants  \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  21  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nPass, No. 1:18–cv–01823 (D Ore.), ECF Doc. 63–4, pp. 2, 16; \nTr. of Oral Arg. 159. In that respect, the city’s laws parallel \nthose found in countless jurisdictions across the country.  \nSee Part I–A, supra.  And because laws like these do not \ncriminalize mere status, Robinson is not implicated.5  \nC \nIf Robinson does not control this case, the plaintiffs and \nthe dissent argue, we should extend it so that it does.  Per-\nhaps a person does not violate ordinances like Grants Pass’s \nsimply by being homeless but only by engaging in certain \nacts (actus rei) with certain mental states (mentes reae).  \nStill, the plaintiffs and the dissent insist, laws like these \nseek to regulate actions that are in some sense “involun-\ntary,” for some homeless persons cannot help but do what \nthe law forbids.  See Brief for Respondents 24–25, 29, 32;  \npost, at 16–17 (opinion  of SOTOMAYOR,  J.).  And, the plain-\ntiffs and the dissent continue, we should extend Robinson  \nto prohibit the enforcement of laws that operate this way—\nlaws that don’t proscribe status as such but that proscribe \nacts,  even  acts  undertaken  with   some  required  mental \nstate, the defendant cannot help but undertake.  Post, at  \n16–17. To rule otherwise, the argument goes, would “‘effec-\n \ntively’” allow cities to punish a person because of his status.   \n \nPost, at 25.   The Ninth Circuit pursued just this line of \nthinking below and in Martin. \n  The problem is, this Court has already rejected that view.   \n—————— \n5At times, the dissent seems to suggest, mistakenly, that laws like  \n \nGrants Pass’s apply only to the homeless.  See post, at 13.  That view \nfinds no support in the laws before us.  Perhaps the dissent means to  \nsuggest that some cities selectively  “enforce” their public-camping laws \nonly against homeless persons. See post, at 17–19.  But if that’s the dis-\nsent’s theory, it is not one that arises under the Eighth Amendment’s\nCruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.  Instead, if anything, it may \nimplicate due process and our precedents regarding selective prosecu-\ntion.  See, e.g., United States v.  Armstrong, 517 U. S. 456 (1996).  No  \nclaim like that is before us in this case. \n \n\n22  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nOpinion of the Court \nIn Powell v. Texas, 392 U. S. 514 (1968), the Court con-\nfronted a defendant who had been  convicted under a Texas \nstatute making it a crime to “‘get drunk or be found in a  \n \nstate of intoxication in any public place.’”  Id., at 517 (plu-\n \nrality opinion).  Like the plaintiffs here, Mr. Powell argued\nthat his drunkenness was an “‘involuntary’” byproduct of \n   \nhis status as an alcoholic.  Id., at 533.  Yes, the statute re-\nquired proof of an act (becoming drunk or intoxicated and \nthen proceeding into public), and perhaps some associated\nmental state (for presumably the defendant knew he was \ndrinking and maybe even knew he made his way to a public \nplace).  Still, Mr. Powell contended, Texas’s law effectively \ncriminalized his status as an alcoholic because he could not \nhelp but doing as he did.  Ibid.  Justice Fortas embraced \nthat view, but only in dissent:  He would have extended \nRobinson to cover conduct that flows from any “condition \n[the defendant] is powerless to change.”  392 U. S., at 567 \n(Fortas, J., dissenting).\n  The Court did not agree.  Writing for a plurality, Justice  \nMarshall observed that  Robinson had authorized “a very\nsmall” intrusion by courts “into the substantive criminal\nlaw” “under the aegis of the Cruel and Unusual Punish-\nment[s] Clause.”   392  U. S., at 533.  That small intrusion, \nJustice Marshall said, prevents States only from enforcing\nlaws that criminalize “a mere status.”  Id., at 532.  It does  \nnothing to curtail a State’s authority to secure a conviction \nwhen “the accused has committed some act . . . society has  \nan interest in preventing.”  Id., at 533.  That remains true, \nJustice Marshall continued, regardless whether the defend-\nant’s act “in some sense” might be described as  “‘involun-\n \ntary’ or ‘occasioned by’” a particular status.   Ibid. (emphasis \n \nadded).  In this, Justice Marshall echoed Robinson itself, \nwhere the Court emphasized that California remained free \nto criminalize intentional or knowing drug use even by ad-\ndicts whose conduct, too, in some sense could be considered \ninvoluntary.  See Robinson, 370 U. S., at 664, 666.  Based \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  23  \n \nOpinion of the Court \non all this, Justice Marshall concluded, because the defend-\nant before the Court had not been convicted “for being” an \n“alcoholic, but for [engaging in the act of] being in public\nwhile drunk on a particular occasion,” Robinson did not ap-\nply.  Powell, 392 U. S., at 532.6  \n  This case is no different from  Powell.  Just as there, the  \nplaintiffs here seek to expand Robinson’s “small” intrusion \n“into the substantive criminal law.”  Just as there, the  \nplaintiffs here seek to extend its rule beyond  laws address-\ning “mere status” to laws addressing actions that, even if \nundertaken with the requisite mens rea, might “in some \nsense” qualify as “‘involuntary.’”  And just as Powell could  \n   \nfind nothing in the Eighth Amendment permitting that \ncourse, neither can we.  As we have seen,  Robinson already\nsits uneasily with the Amendment’s terms, original mean-\ning, and our precedents.  Its holding is restricted to laws \nthat criminalize “mere status.”  Nothing in the decision \ncalled into question the “broad power” of States to regulate \nacts undertaken with some mens rea.  And, just as in  Pow-\nell,  we  discern  nothing  in  the  Eighth  Amendment  that \nmight provide us with lawful authority to extend Robinson  \nbeyond its narrow holding. \n—————— \n6Justice White, who cast the fifth vote upholding the conviction, con-\n \ncurred in the result.  Writing only for himself, Justice White expressed \nsome sympathy for Justice Fortas’s  theory, but ultimately deemed that \n“novel construction” of the Eighth Amendment “unnecessary to pursue” \nbecause the defendant hadn’t proven that his alcoholism made him “un-\nable to stay off the streets on the night in question.”  392 U. S., at 552,  \nn.  4, 553–554 (White, J., concurring in result).  In  Martin, the Ninth Cir-\ncuit suggested Justice White’s solo concurrence somehow rendered the \nPowell dissent controlling and the plurality a dissent.  See Martin v.  \nBoise, 920 F. 3d 584, 616–617 (2019).  Before us, neither the plaintiffs  \nnor the dissent defend that  theory, and for good reason:  In the years\nsince Powell, this Court has repeatedly relied on Justice Marshall’s opin-\nion, as we do today.  See,  e.g.,  Kahler v. Kansas,  589 U. S. 271, 280 (2020);  \nClark v. Arizona, 548 U. S. 735, 768, n.  38 (2006); Jones v. United States, \n463 U. S. 354, 365, n. 13 (1983). \n \n\n24  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nOpinion of the Court \n  To be sure, and once more, a variety of other legal doc-\ntrines and constitutional provisions work to protect those in \nour criminal justice system from a conviction.  Like some \nother jurisdictions, Oregon recognizes a “necessity” defense \n \nto certain criminal charges. It may be that defense extends \nto charges for illegal camping when it comes to those with \nnowhere else to go.  See  State v. Barrett, 302 Ore. App. 23, \n28, 460 P. 3d 93, 96 (2020) (citing Ore. Rev. Stat. §161.200).  \nInsanity,  diminished-capacity,  and  duress  defenses  also \nmay be available in many jurisdictions.  See Powell, 392  \nU. S., at 536.  States and cities are free as well to add addi-\ntional substantive protections.  Since this litigation began, \nfor example, Oregon itself has adopted a law specifically ad-\ndressing how far its municipalities may go in regulating\npublic  camping.  See,   e.g.,  Ore.  Rev.  Stat.  §195.530(2) \n(2023).  For that matter, nothing in today’s decision pre-\nvents States, cities, and counties from going a step further \nand declining to criminalize public camping altogether.  For \nits part, the Constitution provides many additional limits \non state prosecutorial power, promising fair notice of the \nlaws and equal treatment under them, forbidding selective \nprosecutions, and much more besides.  See Part II–A, supra; \nand n. 5, supra.  All this represents only a small sample of \nthe legion protections our society affords a presumptively \nfree individual from a criminal conviction.  But aside from  \nRobinson, a case directed to a highly unusual law that con-\ndemned status alone, this Court has never invoked the  \nEighth  Amendment’s  Cruel  and  Unusual  Punishments \nClause to perform that function. \nD \n  Not only did Powell decline to extend Robinson to “invol-\nuntary” acts, it stressed the dangers that would likely at-\ntend any attempt to do so.  Were the Court to pursue that \npath in the name of the Eighth Amendment, Justice Mar-\nshall warned, “it is difficult to see any limiting principle  \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  25  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nthat would serve to prevent this Court from becoming . . . \nthe ultimate arbiter of the standards of criminal responsi-\nbility, in diverse areas of the criminal law, throughout the\ncountry.” Powell, 392 U. S., at 533.  After all, nothing in the \nAmendment’s text or history exists to “confine” or guide our \nreview. Id., at 534. Unaided by those sources, we would be \nleft “to write into the Constitution” our own “formulas,”  \nmany of which would likely prove unworkable in practice.   \nId., at 537. Along the way, we would interfere with “essen-\ntial considerations of federalism” that reserve to the States  \nprimary responsibility for drafting their own criminal laws.  \nId., at 535.  \n  In particular, Justice Marshall observed, extending Rob-\ninson to cover involuntary acts would effectively “impe[l]” \nthis Court “into defining” something akin to a new “insanity \ntest in constitutional terms.”  392 U. S., at 536.  It would \nbecause an individual like the defendant in Powell does not \ndispute that he has committed an otherwise criminal act \nwith the requisite mens rea, yet he seeks to be excused from \n“moral accountability” because of  his “‘condition.’”  Id., at  \n   \n535–536.  And “[n]othing,” Justice Marshall said, “could be \nless fruitful than for this Court” to try to resolve for the Na-\ntion profound questions like that under a provision of the \nConstitution that does not speak to them.  Id., at 536.  In-\nstead, Justice Marshall reasoned, such matters are gener-\nally left to be resolved through “productive” democratic “di-\nalogue”  and  “experimentation,”  not  by  “freez[ing]”  any \nparticular, judicially preferred approach “into a rigid con-\nstitutional mold.”  Id., at 537. \n  We recently reemphasized that last point in Kahler v.  \nKansas in the context of a Due Process Clause challenge.  \nDrawing  on  Justice  Marshall’s  opinion  in   Powell,  we  \nacknowledged that “a state rule about criminal liability” \nmay violate due process if it departs from a rule “so rooted \nin the traditions” of this Nation that it might be said to  \n \n\n26  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nOpinion of the Court \n“ran[k] as fundamental.”  589 U. S., at 279 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).  But, we stressed, questions about \nwhether an individual who has committed a proscribed act \nwith the requisite mental state should be “reliev[ed of] re-\nsponsibility,” id., at 283, due to a lack of “moral culpability,” \nid., at 286, are generally best resolved by the people and \ntheir elected representatives. Those are questions, we said, \n“of recurrent controversy” to which history supplies few “en-\ntrenched” answers, and on which the Constitution gener-\nally commands “no one view.”  Id., at 296. \n  The Ninth Circuit’s Martin experiment defied these les-\nsons.  Under Martin, judges take from elected representa-\ntives the questions whether and when someone who has \ncommitted a proscribed act with  a requisite mental state \nshould be “relieved of responsibility” for lack of “moral cul-\npability.”  598 U. S., at 283, 286.  And Martin  exemplifies\nmuch of what can go wrong when courts try to resolve mat-\nters like those unmoored from any secure guidance in the \nConstitution. \n  Start with this problem. Under  Martin, cities must allow \npublic camping by those who are “involuntarily” homeless.  \n72 F. 4th, at 877 (citing Martin, 920 F. 3d, at 617, n. 8). But \nhow are city officials and law enforcement officers to know \nwhat it means to be “involuntarily” homeless, or whether \nany particular person meets that standard?  Posing the \nquestions may be easy; answering them is not.  Is it enough \nthat a homeless person has turned down an offer of shelter?  \nOr does it matter why?  Cities routinely confront individu-\nals who decline offers of shelter for any number of reasons, \nranging from safety concerns to individual preferences.  See \nPart I–A, supra.  How are cities and their law enforcement \nofficers on the ground to know which of these reasons are \nsufficiently weighty to qualify a person as “involuntarily” \nhomeless? \n  If there are answers to those questions, they cannot be \nfound in the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.  Nor \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  27  \n \nOpinion of the Court \ndo federal judges enjoy any special competence to provide \nthem. Cities across the West report that the Ninth Circuit’s \nill-defined involuntariness test has proven “unworkable.”  \nOregon Cities Brief 3; see Phoenix Brief 11.  The test, they \nsay, has left them “with little or no direction as to the scope \nof their authority in th[eir] day-to-day policing contacts,” \nCalifornia Sheriffs Brief 6, and under “threat of federal lit-\nigation . . . at all times and in all circumstances,” Oregon \nCities Brief 6–7.  \n  To be sure, Martin attempted to head off these complexi-\nties through some back-of-the-envelope arithmetic.  The \nNinth Circuit said a city needs to consider individuals “in-\nvoluntarily” homeless (and thus entitled to camp on public \nproperty) only when the overall homeless population ex-\nceeds the total number of “adequate” and “practically avail-\nable” shelter beds. See 920 F. 3d, at 617–618, and n. 8.  But \nas sometimes happens with abstract rules created by those \nfar from the front lines, that test has proven all but impos-\nsible to administer in practice. \n  City officials report that it can be “monumentally diffi-\ncult” to keep an accurate accounting of those experiencing \nhomelessness on any given day.  Los Angeles Cert. Brief 14.  \nOften, a city’s homeless population “fluctuate[s] dramati-\ncally,” in part because homelessness is an inherently dy-\nnamic status.  Brief for City of San Clemente as Amicus Cu-\nriae 16 (San Clemente Brief ).   While cities sometimes make \n \nrough estimates based on a single point-in-time count, they \nsay it would be “impossibly expensive and difficult” to un-\ndertake that effort with any regularity.  Id., at 17.  In Los \nAngeles, for example, it takes three days to count the home-\nless population block-by-block—even with the participation \nof  thousands  of  volunteers.    Martin,  920  F. 3d,  at  595  \n(Smith, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). \n  Beyond these complexities, more await.  Suppose even\nlarge cities could keep a running tally of their homeless cit-\nizens forevermore.  And suppose further that they could \n \n\n28  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nOpinion of the Court \nkeep a live inventory of available shelter beds.   Even so, cit-\nies face questions over which shelter beds count as “ade-\nquate” and “available” under Martin.  Id., at 617, and n. 8.   \nRather than resolve the challenges associated with defining \nwho qualifies as “involuntarily” homeless, these standards \nmore nearly return us to them.  Is a bed “available” to a  \nsmoker if the shelter requires residents to abstain from nic-\notine, as the shelter in Grants Pass does?  72 F. 4th, at 896;  \nApp. 39, Third Amended Complaint ¶13.  Is a bed “availa-\nble” to an atheist if the shelter includes “religious” messag-\ning?  72 F. 4th, at 877.  And how is a city to know whether\nthe accommodations it provides will prove “adequate” in\nlater litigation? 920 F.  3d, at 617, n. 8.  Once more, a large \nnumber of cities in the Ninth Circuit tell us they have no \nway to be sure.  See, e.g., Phoenix Brief 28; San Clemente \nBrief 8–12; Brief for City of Los Angeles as Amicus Curiae  \n22–23 (“What may be available, appropriate, or actually \nbeneficial to one [homeless] person, might not be so to an-\nother”).\n  Consider  an  example.  The  city  of  Chico,  California,\nthought it was complying with Martin  when it constructed  \nan outdoor shelter facility at its municipal airport to accom-\nmodate its homeless population. Warren v. Chico, 2021 WL \n2894648, *3 (ED Cal., July 8, 2021).  That shelter, we are  \ntold, included “protective fencing, large water totes, hand-\nwashing stations, portable toilets, [and] a large canopy for \nshade.” Brief for City of Chico as Amicus Curiae on Pet. for \nCert. 16. Still, a district court enjoined the city from enforc-\ning its public-camping ordinance.   Why?  Because, in that \ncourt’s view, “appropriate” shelter requires “‘indoo[r],’” not \n   \noutdoor, spaces.  Warren, 2021 WL 2894648, *3 (quoting  \nMartin, 920 F. 3d, at 617).  One federal court in Los Angeles \nruled, during the COVID pandemic, that “adequate” shelter \nmust also include nursing staff, testing for communicable \ndiseases, and on-site security, among other things.  See LA \nAlliance for Hum. Rights v. Los Angeles, 2020 WL 2512811,  \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  29  \n \nOpinion of the Court \n*4 (CD Cal., May 15, 2020).  By imbuing the availability of\nshelter with constitutional significance in this way,  many  \ncities tell us, Martin and its progeny have “paralyzed” com-\nmunities and prevented them from implementing even pol-\nicies designed to help the homeless while remaining sensi-\ntive to the limits of their resources and the needs of other \ncitizens.  Cities Cert. Brief 4 (boldface and capitalization\ndeleted).\n  There are more problems still.  The Ninth Circuit held  \nthat “involuntarily” homeless individuals cannot be pun-\nished  for  camping  with  materials  “necessary  to  protect \nthemselves from the elements.”  72 F. 4th, at 896.  It sug-\ngested,  too,  that  cities  cannot  proscribe  “life-sustaining \nact[s]” that flow necessarily from homelessness.  72 F. 4th,  \nat 921 (joint statement of Silver and Gould, JJ., regarding \ndenial of rehearing).  But how far does that go?  The plain-\ntiffs before us suggest a blanket is all that is required in \nGrants Pass.  Brief for Respondents 14. But might a colder\nclimate trigger a right to permanent tent encampments and \nfires for warmth?  Because the contours of this judicial right \nare so “uncertai[n],” cities across the West have been left to \nguess whether Martin forbids their officers from removing \neverything from tents to “portable heaters” on city side-\nwalks.  Brief for City of Phoenix et al. on Pet. for Cert. 19, \n29 (Phoenix Cert. Brief ).  There is uncertainty, as well, over\n \nwhether Martin requires cities to tolerate other acts no less  \n“attendant [to] survival” than sleeping, such as starting \nfires to cook food and “public urination [and] defecation.”  \nPhoenix Cert. Brief 29–30; see also Mahoney v. Sacramento, \n2020 WL 616302, *3 (ED Cal., Feb. 10, 2020) (indicating \nthat “the [c]ity may not prosecute or otherwise penalize the \n[homeless] for eliminating in public if there is no alterna-\ntive to doing so”).  By extending Robinson beyond the nar-\nrow class of status crimes, the Ninth Circuit has created a  \nright that has proven “impossible” for judges to delineate \nexcept “by fiat.”  Powell, 392 U. S., at 534. \n \n\n30  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nOpinion of the Court \n  Doubtless, the Ninth Circuit’s intervention in Martin was  \nwell-intended.  But since the trial court entered its injunc-\ntion against Grants Pass, the city shelter reports that utili-\nzation of its resources has fallen by roughly 40 percent.  See  \nBrief for Grants Pass Gospel Rescue Mission as  Amicus Cu-\nriae 4–5.  Many other cities offer similar accounts about\ntheir experiences after Martin, telling us the decision has \nmade it more difficult, not less, to help the homeless accept \nshelter off city streets.  See Part I–B, supra (recounting ex-\namples).  Even when “policymakers would prefer to invest \nin more permanent” programs and policies designed to ben-\nefit homeless and other citizens, Martin has forced these \n“overwhelmed jurisdictions to concentrate public resources \non temporary shelter beds.” Cities Brief 25; see Oregon Cit-\nies Brief 17–20; States Brief 16–17.  As a result, cities re-\nport, Martin has undermined their efforts to balance con-\nflicting public needs and mired them in litigation at a time \nwhen the homelessness crisis calls for action.  See States  \nBrief 16–17.  \n  All told, the Martin experiment is perhaps just what Jus-\ntice Marshall anticipated ones like it would be. The Eighth\nAmendment provides no guidance to “confine” judges in de-\nciding what conduct a State or city may or may not pro-\nscribe.  Powell, 392 U. S., at 534.  Instead of encouraging \n“productive dialogue” and “experimentation” through our \ndemocratic institutions, courts have frozen in place their \nown “formulas” by “fiat.”  Id., at 534, 537.  Issued by federal \ncourts removed from realities on the ground, those rules \nhave produced confusion.  And they have interfered with \n“essential considerations of federalism,” taking from the \npeople and their elected leaders difficult questions tradi-\ntionally “thought to be the[ir] province.”  Id., at 535–536.7  \n—————— \n7The dissent suggests we cite selectively to the amici and “see only\n \nwhat [we] wan[t]” in their briefs.  Post, at 24.  In fact, all the States,  \ncities, and counties listed above (n. 3, supra) asked us to review this case.  \nAmong them all, the dissent purports to identify just two public officials  \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  31  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nE \n  Rather than address what we have actually said, the dis-\nsent accuses us of extending to local governments an “un-\nfettered freedom to punish,” post, at 25, and stripping away \nany protections “the Constitution” has against “criminaliz-\ning sleeping,” post, at 5.  “Either stay awake,” the dissent  \nwarns, “or be arrested.”  Post, at 2.  That is gravely mis-\ntaken.  We hold nothing of the sort.  As we have stressed, \ncities and States are not bound to adopt public-camping\nlaws. They may also choose to narrow such laws (as Oregon \nitself has recently).  Beyond all that, many substantive le-\ngal protections and provisions of the Constitution may have \nimportant roles to play when States and cities seek to en-\nforce their laws against the homeless.  See Parts II–A, II– \nC, supra. The only question we face is whether one specific\nprovision of the Constitution—the Cruel and Unusual Pun-\nishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment—prohibits the \nenforcement of public-camping laws. \n  Nor does the dissent meaningfully engage with the rea-\nsons we have offered for our conclusion on that question.  It \nclaims that we “gratuitously” treat Robinson “as an outlier.”  \nPost, at 12, and n. 2.  But the dissent does not dispute that \n—————— \nand two cities that, according to the dissent, support its view.  Post, at  \n24–25.  But even among that select group, the dissent overlooks the fact \nthat each expresses strong dissatisfaction with how  Martin has been ap-\nplied in practice.   See San Francisco Brief 15, 26 (“[T]he Ninth Circuit  \nand its lower courts have repeatedly misapplied and overextended the \nEighth Amendment” and “hamstrung San Francisco’s balanced approach \nto addressing the homelessness crisis”); Brief for City of Los Angeles as  \nAmicus Curiae 6 (“[T]he sweeping rationale in Martin . . . calls into ques-\ntion whether cities can enforce public  health and safety laws”); California \nGovernor Brief 3 (“In the wake of Martin, lower courts have blocked ef-\nforts to clear encampments while micromanaging what qualifies as a  \nsuitable offer of shelter”).  And for all the reasons we have explored and  \nso many other cities have suggested, we see no principled basis under \nthe Eighth Amendment for federal judges to administer anything like \nMartin. \n \n\n32  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nOpinion of the Court \nthe law Robinson faced was an anomaly, punishing mere  \nstatus.  The dissent does not dispute that Robinson’s deci-\nsion to address that law under the rubric of the Eighth \nAmendment is itself hard to square with the Amendment’s \ntext and this Court’s other precedents interpreting it.  And \nthe dissent all but ignores Robinson’s own insistence that a \ndifferent result would have obtained in that case if the law \nthere had proscribed an act rather than status alone. \n  Tellingly, too, the dissent barely mentions Justice Mar-\nshall’s opinion in  Powell. There, reasoning exactly as we do \ntoday, Justice Marshall refused to extend Robinson to ac-\ntions undertaken, “in some sense, ‘involuntar[ily].’”  392 \n \nU. S., at 533.  Rather than confront any of this, the dissent \nbrusquely calls Powell a “strawman” and seeks to distin-\nguish it on the inscrutable ground that Grants Pass penal-\nizes “status[-defining]” (rather than “involuntary”) conduct.   \nPost,  at 23.  But whatever that might mean, it is no answer \nto the reasoning Justice Marshall offered, to its obvious rel-\nevance here, or to the fact this Court has since endorsed \nJustice Marshall’s reasoning as correct in cases like Kahler  \nand Jones, cases that go undiscussed in the dissent.  See \nn. 6, supra.  The only extraordinary result we might reach \nin this case is one that would defy Powell, ignore the histor-\nical reach of the Eighth Amendment, and transform Robin-\nson’s narrow holding addressing a peculiar law punishing \nstatus alone into a new rule that would bar the enforcement  \nof  laws  that  are,  as  the  dissent  puts  it,  “‘pervasive’” \n   \nthroughout the country.  Post, at 15; Part I–A,  supra. \n  To be sure, the dissent seeks to portray the new rule it \nadvocates as a modest, “limited,” and “narrow” one address-\ning only those who wish to fulfill a “biological necessity” and \n“keep warm outside with a blanket” when they have no  \nother “adequate” place “to go.” Post, at 1, 5, 10, 21, 24.  But \nthat reply blinks the difficult questions that necessarily fol-\nlow and the Ninth Circuit has been forced to confront:   \nWhat does it mean to be “involuntarily” homeless with “no \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  33  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nplace to go”?  What kind of “adequate” shelter must a city \nprovide to avoid being forced to allow people to camp in its \nparks and on its sidewalks?  And what are people entitled \nto do and use in public spaces to “keep warm” and fulfill \nother “biological necessities”?8  \n  Those unavoidable questions have plunged courts and \ncities across the Ninth Circuit into waves of litigation.  And  \nwithout anything in the Eighth Amendment to guide them, \nany answers federal judges can offer (and have offered) \ncome, as Justice Marshall foresaw, only by way of “fiat.”   \nPowell, 392 U. S., at 534.  The dissent cannot escape that\nhard truth.  Nor can it escape the fact that, far from nar-\nrowing Martin, it would expand its  experiment from one cir-\ncuit to the entire country—a development without any prec-\nedent in this Court’s history.  One that would authorize  \n—————— \n8The dissent brushes aside these questions, declaring that “available  \n \nanswers” exist in the decisions below.   Post,  at 22.  But the dissent misses \nthe point.  The problem, as Justice Marshall discussed, is not that it is \nimpossible for someone to dictate answers to these questions.  The prob-\nlem is that nothing in the Eighth Amendment gives federal judges the \nauthority or guidance they  need to answer them in a principled way.  \nTake just two examples.  First, the dissent says, a city seeking to ban \ncamping must provide “adequate” shelter for those with “no place to go.”  \nPost, at 21–22.  But it never says what qualifies as “adequate” shelter.   \nIbid.  And, as we have seen, cities and courts across the Ninth Circuit  \nhave struggled mightily with that  question, all with nothing in the \nEighth Amendment to guide their work.  Second, the dissent seems to  \nthink that, if a city lacks enough “adequate” shelter, it must permit “‘bed-\n \nding’” in public spaces, but not campfires, tents, or “‘public urination or \n   \ndefecation.’ ” Post, at 15, 21–22, 24. But where does that rule come from,  \n \nthe federal register?  See post, at 22.  After  Martin, again as we have  \nseen, many courts have taken a very different view.  The dissent never \nexplains why it disagrees with those courts.  Instead, it merely quotes\nthe district court’s opinion in this case that announced a rule it seems \nthe dissent happens to prefer.  By elevating Martin over our own prece-\ndents and the Constitution’s original public meaning, the dissent faces  \ndifficult choices that cannot be swept under the rug—ones that it can \nresolve not by  anything found in the Eighth Amendment, only by fiat. \n \n\n34  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nOpinion of the Court \nfederal judges to freeze into place their own rules on mat-\nters long “thought to be the province” of state and local lead-\ners, id., at 536, and one that would deny communities the \n“wide latitude” and “flexibility” even the dissent acknowl-\nedges they need to address the homelessness crisis, post, at \n2, 5. \nIII  \n  Homelessness is complex.  Its causes are many.  So may\nbe the public policy responses required to address it.  At \nbottom,  the  question  this  case  presents  is  whether  the \nEighth Amendment grants federal judges primary respon-\nsibility for assessing those causes and devising those re-\nsponses. It does not.  Almost 200 years ago, a visitor to this\ncountry remarked upon the “extreme skill with which the \ninhabitants of the United States succeed in proposing a\ncommon object to the exertions of a great many men, and in \ngetting them voluntarily to pursue it.”  2 A. de Tocqueville, \nDemocracy in America 129 (H. Reeve transl. 1961).  If the \nmultitude of amicus briefs before us proves one thing, it is \nthat the American people are still at it.  Through their vol-\nuntary associations and charities, their elected representa-\ntives and appointed officials, their police officers and men-\ntal health professionals, they display that same energy and \nskill today in their efforts to address the complexities of the \nhomelessness challenge facing the most vulnerable among \nus. \n  Yes, people will disagree over which policy responses are \nbest; they may experiment with one set of approaches only \nto find later another set works better; they may find certain  \nresponses more appropriate for some communities than \nothers.  But in our democracy, that is their right.  Nor can  \na handful of federal judges begin to “match” the collective \nwisdom the American people possess in deciding “how best \nto handle” a pressing social question like homelessness.  \nRobinson, 370 U. S., at 689 (White, J., dissenting).  The \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  35  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nConstitution’s Eighth Amendment serves many important \nfunctions, but it does not authorize federal judges to wrest \nthose rights and responsibilities from the American people \nand in their place dictate this Nation’s homelessness policy.  \nThe judgment below is reversed, and the case is remanded \nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion. \n \nIt is so ordered.  \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U.

As the Court observes, that Clause  \n“focuses on the question what method or kind of punish-\nment a government may impose after a criminal convic-\ntion.”  Ante, at 16 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The \nrespondents, by contrast, ask whether Grants Pass “may \ncriminalize particular behavior in the first place.”  Ibid.  I \nwrite separately to make two additional observations about \nthe respondents’ claims.\n  First, the precedent that the respondents primarily rely  \nupon, Robinson v. California, 370 U. S. 660 (1962), was  \nwrongly decided.  In Robinson, the Court held that the \nCruel and Unusual Punishments Clause prohibits the en-\nforcement of laws criminalizing a person’s status.  Id., at \n666.  That holding conflicts with the plain text and history\nof the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.  See ante,  \nat 15–16.  That fact is unsurprising given that the Robinson  \nCourt made no attempt to analyze the Eighth Amendment’s \ntext or discern its original meaning.  Instead, Robinson’s  \nholding rested almost entirely on the Court’s understand-\ning of public opinion: The Robinson Court observed that “in \n \n\n2  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nTHOMAS,  J., concurring  \nthe light of contemporary human knowledge, a law which \nmade a criminal offense of . . . a disease [such as narcotics \naddiction] would doubtless be universally thought to be an \ninfliction of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of \nthe Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.”  370 U. S.,  at \n666. Modern public opinion is not an appropriate metric for \ninterpreting the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause—\nor any provision of the Constitution for that matter. \n  Much of the Court’s other Eighth Amendment precedents\nmake the same mistake. Rather than interpret our written \nConstitution, the Court has at times “proclaim[ed] itself \nsole arbiter of our Nation’s moral standards,” Roper v. Sim-\nmons, 543 U. S. 551, 608 (2005) (Scalia, J., dissenting), and \nhas set out to enforce “evolving standards of decency,” Trop  \nv. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion).  “In  a \nsystem based upon constitutional and statutory text demo-\ncratically adopted, the concept of ‘law’ ordinarily signifies \nthat particular words have a fixed meaning.”  Roper, 543  \nU. S., at 629 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  I continue to believe  \nthat we should adhere to the Cruel and Unusual Punish-\nments Clause’s fixed meaning in resolving any challenge \nbrought under it. \n  To be sure, we need not reconsider Robinson to resolve \nthis case. As the Court explains, the challenged ordinances \nregulate conduct, not status, and thus do not implicate Rob-\ninson.   Ante, at 20–21. Moreover, it is unclear what, if any, \nweight Robinson carries.  The Court has not once applied \nRobinson’s interpretation of the Cruel and Unusual Pun-\nishments Clause.  And, today the Court rightly questions \nthe decision’s “persuasive force.”  Ante, at 20.  Still, rather \nthan let Robinson’s erroneous holding linger in the back-\nground of our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, we should\ndispose of it once and for all.  In an appropriate case, the \nCourt should certainly correct this error. \n  Second, the respondents have not established that their \nclaims  implicate  the  Cruel  and  Unusual  Punishments  \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  3 \n \nTHOMAS,  J., concurring  \nClause in the first place.  The challenged ordinances are en-\nforced through the imposition of civil fines and civil park \nexclusion  orders,  as  well  as  through  criminal  trespass \ncharges.  But, “[a]t the time the Eighth Amendment was \nratified, the word ‘punishment’ referred to the penalty im-\nposed for the commission of a crime.” Helling v. McKinney, \n509 U. S. 25, 38 (1993) (THOMAS, J., dissenting); see ante,  \nat 15–16. The respondents have yet to explain how the civil\nfines and park exclusion orders constitute a “penalty im-\nposed for the commission of a crime.” Helling, 509 U. S., at  \n38. \n  For its part, the Court of Appeals concluded that the  \nCruel and Unusual Punishments Clause governs these civil \npenalties because they can “later . . . become criminal of-\nfenses.”  72 F. 4th 868, 890 (CA9 2023).  But, that theory \nrests on layer upon layer of speculation.  It requires reason-\ning that because violating one of the ordinances “could re-\nsult in civil citations and fines, [and] repeat violators could  \nbe excluded from specified City property, and .  . . violating \nan exclusion order could subject a violator to criminal tres-\npass  prosecution,”  civil  fines  and  park  exclusion  orders  \ntherefore must be governed by the Cruel and Unusual Pun-\nishments Clause.  Id., at 926 (O’Scannlain, J., statement \nrespecting denial of rehearing en banc) (emphasis added).  \nAnd, if this case is any indication, the possibility that a civil \nfine turns into a criminal trespass charge is a remote one.  \nThe respondents assert that they have been involuntarily \nhomeless in Grants Pass for years, yet they have never re-\nceived a park exclusion order, much less a criminal trespass \ncharge.  See ante, at 11.  \n  Because  the  respondents’  claims  fail  either  way,  the \nCourt does not address the merits of the Court of Appeals’ \ntheory.  See ante, at 16–17, and n. 4.  Suffice it to say, we \nhave never endorsed such a broad view of the Cruel and \nUnusual Punishments Clause.  Both this Court and lower \ncourts should be wary of expanding the Clause beyond its  \n \n\n4  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v.

For some peo-\nple, sleeping outside is their only option.  The City of Grants \nPass jails and fines those people for sleeping anywhere in \npublic at any time, including in their cars, if they use as\nlittle as a blanket to keep warm or a rolled-up shirt as a \npillow.  For people with no access to shelter, that punishes \nthem for being homeless.  That is unconscionable and un-\nconstitutional.  Punishing people for their status is “cruel \nand unusual” under the Eighth Amendment.  See Robinson  \nv. California, 370 U. S. 660 (1962). \n  Homelessness is a reality for too many Americans.  On  \nany given night, over half a million people across the coun-\ntry lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence.  \nMany do not have access to shelters and are left to sleep in \ncars, sidewalks, parks, and other public places. They expe-\nrience homelessness due to complex and interconnected is-\nsues, including crippling debt and stagnant wages; domes-\ntic and sexual abuse;  physical and psychiatric disabilities; \nand rising housing costs coupled with declining affordable \nhousing options.  \n \n\n2  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \n  At the same time, States and cities face immense chal-\nlenges in responding to homelessness.  To address these \nchallenges and provide for public health and safety, local \ngovernments  need  wide  latitude,  including  to  regulate \nwhen, where, and how homeless people sleep in public.  The  \ndecision below did, in fact, leave cities free to punish “litter-\ning, public urination or defecation, obstruction of roadways, \npossession or distribution of illicit substances, harassment, \nor violence.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 200a.  The only question \nfor the Court today is whether the Constitution permits \npunishing homeless people with no access to shelter for \nsleeping in public with as little as a blanket to keep warm. \n  It is possible to acknowledge and balance the issues fac-\ning local governments, the humanity and dignity of home-\nless people, and our constitutional principles.  Instead, the  \nmajority focuses almost exclusively on the needs of local \ngovernments and leaves the most vulnerable in our society \nwith an impossible choice: Either stay awake or be arrested.  \nThe Constitution provides a baseline of rights for all Amer-\nicans rich and poor, housed and unhoused. This Court must \nsafeguard those rights even when, and perhaps especially \nwhen, doing so is uncomfortable or unpopular.  Otherwise, \n“the words of the Constitution become little more than good \nadvice.”  Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 104 (1958) (plurality \nopinion).  \nI \n  The causes, consequences, and experiences of homeless-\nness are complex and interconnected.  The majority paints \na picture of “cities across the American West” in “crisis” \nthat are using criminalization as a last resort.  Ante, at 1.  \nThat  narrative  then  animates  the  majority’s  reasoning.  \nThis account, however, fails to  engage seriously with the \nprecipitating causes of homelessness, the damaging effects \nof criminalization, and the myriad legitimate reasons peo-\nple may lack or decline shelter.  \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  3 \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nA \n  Over 600,000 people experience homelessness in America \non any given night, meaning that they lack “a fixed, regu-\nlar, and adequate nighttime residence.”  Dept. of Housing \nand Urban Development, T. de Sousa et al., The 2023 An-\nnual  Homeless  Assessment  Report  to  Congress  4  (2023 \nAHAR).  These people experience homelessness in different  \nways.  Although 6 in 10 are able to secure shelter beds, the \nremaining 4 in 10 are unsheltered, sleeping “in places not \nmeant for human habitation,” such as sidewalks, aban-\ndoned buildings, bus or train stations, camping grounds, \nand parked vehicles.  See id., at 2.  “Some sleep alone in \npublic places, without any physical structures (like tents or \nshacks) or connection to services.  Others stay in encamp-\nments, which generally refer to groups of people living sem-\nipermanently in tents or other temporary structures in a  \npublic space.” Brief for California as Amicus Curiae 6 (Cal-\nifornia Brief ) (citation omitted).  This is in part because \n \nthere has been a national “shortage of 188,000 shelter beds \nfor individual adults.”  Brief for Service Providers as Amici \nCuriae 8 (Service Providers Brief ). \n \n  People  become  homeless  for  many  reasons,  including\nsome beyond their control.  “[S]tagnant wages and the lack\nof affordable housing” can mean some people are one unex-\npected medical bill away from being unable to pay rent.  \nBrief for Public Health Professionals and Organizations as \nAmici Curiae 3.  Every “$100 increase in median rental \nprice” is “associated with about a 9 percent increase in the \nestimated homelessness rate.”  GAO, A. Cackley, Homeless-\nness: Better HUD Oversight of Data Collection Could Im-\nprove Estimates of Homeless Populations 30 (GAO–20–433, \n2020).  Individuals with disabilities, immigrants, and vet-\nerans face policies that increase housing instability.  See \nCalifornia Brief 7.  Natural disasters also play a role, in-\ncluding in Oregon, where increasing numbers of people \n \n\n4  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \n“have lost housing because of climate events such as ex-\ntreme wildfires across the state, floods in the coastal areas, \n[and] heavy snowstorms.”  2023 AHAR 52.  Further, “men-\ntal and physical health challenges,” and family and domes-\ntic  “violence  and  abuse”  can  be  precipitating  causes  of \nhomelessness.  California Brief 7. \n  People experiencing homelessness are young and old, live \nin families and as individuals, and belong to all races, cul-\ntures, and creeds.  Given the complex web of causes, it is \nunsurprising that the burdens of homelessness fall dispro-\nportionately on the most vulnerable in our society.  People\nalready in precarious positions with mental and physical \nhealth, trauma, or abuse may have nowhere else to go if \nforced to leave their homes.  Veterans, victims of domestic  \nviolence, teenagers, and people with disabilities are all at  \nan increased risk of homelessness.  For veterans, “those \nwith a history of mental health conditions, including post-\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) . . . are at greater risk of \nhomelessness.”  Brief for American Psychiatric Association \net al. as Amici Curiae 6.  For women, almost 60% of those \nexperiencing homelessness report that fleeing domestic vi-\nolence was the “immediate cause.”  Brief for Advocates for \nSurvivors of Gender-Based Violence as Amici Curiae 9.  For  \nyoung  people,  “family  dysfunction  and  rejection,  sexual\nabuse, juvenile legal system involvement, ‘aging out’ of the \nfoster care system, and economic hardship” make them par-\nticularly vulnerable to homelessness.  Brief for Juvenile \nLaw Center et al. as Amici Curiae 2.  For American Indians,  \n“policies of removal and resettlement in tribal lands” have  \ncaused  displacement,  resulting  in  “a  disproportionately \nhigh rate of housing insecurity and unsheltered homeless-\nness.”  Brief for StrongHearts  Native Helpline et al. as \nAmici Curiae 10, 24.  For people with disabilities, “[l]ess \nthan 5% of housing in the United States is accessible for \nmoderate mobility disabilities, and less than 1% is accessi-\n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  5 \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nble for wheelchair use.”  Brief for Disability Rights Educa-\ntion and Defense Fund et al. as Amici Curiae 2 (Disability\nRights Brief ). \n \nB \n  States and cities responding to the homelessness crisis \nface the difficult task of addressing the underlying causes \nof homelessness while also providing for public health and \nsafety. This includes, for example, dealing with the hazards \nposed by encampments, such as “a heightened risk of dis-\nease associated with living outside without bathrooms or \nwash basins,” “deadly fires” from efforts to “prepare food \nand create heat sources,” violent crime, and drug distribu-\ntion and abuse.  California Brief 12. \n  Local  governments  need  flexibility  in  responding  to\nhomelessness with effective and thoughtful solutions.  See \ninfra, at 19–21.  Almost all of these policy solutions are be-\nyond the scope of this case.  The only question here is \nwhether the Constitution permits criminalizing sleeping \noutside when there is nowhere else to go.  That question is \nincreasingly  relevant  because  many  local  governments \nhave made criminalization a frontline response to home-\nlessness.  “[L]ocal measures to criminalize ‘acts of living’” \n \nby “prohibit[ing] sleeping, eating, sitting, or panhandling in\npublic spaces” have recently proliferated.  U. S. Interagency \nCouncil  on  Homelessness,  Searching  Out  Solutions  1 \n(2012).\n  Criminalizing  homelessness  can  cause  a  destabilizing\ncascade of harm.  “Rather than helping people to regain \nhousing, obtain employment, or access needed treatment \nand services, criminalization creates a costly revolving door \nthat circulates individuals experiencing homelessness from \nthe street to the criminal justice system and back.”  Id., at \n6.  When a homeless person is arrested or separated from \ntheir property, for example, “items frequently destroyed in-\n \n\n6  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nclude personal documents needed for accessing jobs, hous-\ning, and services such as IDs, driver’s licenses, financial \ndocuments, birth certificates, and benefits cards; items re-\nquired for work such as clothing and uniforms, bicycles, \ntools, and computers; and irreplaceable mementos.”  Brief \nfor 57 Social Scientists as Amici Curiae 17–18 (Social Sci-\nentists Brief ).  Consider Erin Spencer, a disabled Marine \n \nCorps veteran who stores items he uses to make a living, \nsuch as tools and bike parts, in a cart.  He was arrested  \nrepeatedly for illegal lodging.  Each time, his cart and be-\nlongings were gone once he returned to the sidewalk.  “[T]he \nmassive number of times the City or State has taken all I \npossess leaves me in a vacuous déjà vu.”  Brief for National \nCoalition for Homeless Veterans et al. as Amici Curiae 28.  \n  Incarceration and warrants from unpaid fines can also \nresult in the loss of employment, benefits, and housing op-\ntions.  See Social Scientists Brief 13, 17 (incarceration and \nwarrants can lead to “termination of federal health benefits  \nsuch as Social Security,  Medicare, or Medicaid,” the “loss of \na shelter bed,” or disqualification from “public housing and \nSection  8  vouchers”).   Finally,  criminalization  can  lead\nhomeless people to “avoid calling the police in the face of \nabuse or theft for fear of eviction from public space.”  Id., at \n27.  Consider the tragic story of a homeless woman “who \nwas raped almost immediately following a police move-\nalong order that pushed her into an unfamiliar area in the\ndead of night.”  Id., at 26.  She described her hesitation in \ncalling for help: “What’s the point?  If I called them, they \nwould have made all of us move [again].”  Ibid. \n  For people with nowhere else to go, fines and jail time do \nnot deter behavior, reduce homelessness, or increase public \nsafety. In one study, 91% of homeless people who were sur-\nveyed “reported remaining outdoors, most often just moving \ntwo to three blocks away” when they received a move-along \norder.  Id., at 23.  Police officers in these cities recognize as \nmuch: “‘Look we’re not really solving anybody’s problem.  \n \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  7 \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nThis is a big game of whack-a-mole.’”  Id., at 24.  Consider \n \nJerry Lee, a Grants Pass resident who sleeps in a van.  Over \nthe course of three days, he was woken up and cited six \ntimes for “camping in the city limits” just because he was \nsleeping in the van.  App. 99 (capitalization omitted).  Lee \nleft the van each time only to return later to sleep.  Police  \nreports eventually noted that he “continues to disregard the \ncity ordinance and returns to the van to sleep as soon as \npolice leave the area.  Dayshift needs to check on the van \nthis morning and . . . follow up for tow.”  Ibid. (same).\n  Shelter beds that are available in theory may be practi-\ncally unavailable because of “restrictions based on gender, \nage, income, sexuality, religious practice, curfews that con-\nflict  with  employment  obligations,  and  time  limits  on \nstays.”  Social Scientists Brief 22.  Studies have shown, \nhowever, that the “vast majority of those who are unshel-\ntered would move inside if safe and affordable options were \navailable.”  Service Providers Brief 8 (collecting studies).  \nConsider CarrieLynn Hill.  She cannot stay at Gospel Res-\ncue Mission, the only entity in Grants Pass offering tempo-\nrary beds, because “she would have to check her nebulizer \nin as medical equipment and, though she must use it at \nleast once every four hours, would not be able to use it in \nher room.”  Disability Rights Brief 18.  Similarly, Debra \nBlake’s  “disabilities  prevent  her  from  working,  which \nmeans she cannot comply with the Gospel Rescue Mission’s \nrequirement that its residents work 40-hour work weeks.”  \nIbid.  \n  Before I move on, consider one last example of a Nashville\nman who experienced homelessness for nearly 20 years.  \nWhen an outreach worker tried to help him secure housing, \nthe worker had difficulty finding him for his appointments \nbecause he was frequently arrested for being homeless.  He  \nwas arrested 198 times and had over 250 charged citations, \nall for petty offenses.  The outreach worker made him a t-\nshirt  that  read  “Please  do  not  arrest  me,  my  outreach \n \n\n8  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nworker is working on my housing.”  Service Providers Brief \n16. Once the worker was able to secure him stable housing, \nhe “had no further encounters with the police, no citations, \nand no arrests.”  Ibid.  \n  These and countless other stories reflect the reality of \ncriminalizing sleeping outside when people have no other \nchoice. \nII  \n  Grants Pass, a city of 38,000 people in southern Oregon, \nadopted  three  ordinances  (Ordinances)  that  effectively \nmake it unlawful to sleep anywhere in public, including in\nyour car, at  any time, with as little as a blanket or a rolled-\nup shirt as a pillow.  The Ordinances prohibit “[c]amping”\non “any sidewalk, street, alley, lane, public right of way, \npark, bench, or any other publicly-owned property or under \nany bridge or viaduct.”  Grants Pass, Ore. Municipal Code  \n§5.61.030 (2024).  A “[c]ampsite” is defined as “any place \nwhere bedding, sleeping bag, or other material used for bed-\nding purposes, or any stove or fire is placed, established, or \nmaintained for the purposes of maintaining a temporary \nplace to live.”  §5.61.010(B).  Relevant here, the definition  \nof “campsite” includes sleeping in “any vehicle.”  Ibid.  The \nOrdinances also prohibit camping in public parks, including \nthe “[o]vernight parking” of any vehicle.  §6.46.090(B).1  \n  The City enforces these Ordinances with fines starting at \n$295 and increasing to $537.60 if unpaid.  Once a person is \ncited twice for violating park regulations within a 1-year \nperiod, city officers can issue an exclusion order barring \nthat person from the park for 30 days.  See §6.46.350.  A \n—————— \n1The City’s “sleeping” ordinance prohibits sleeping “on public side-\n \nwalks, streets, or alleyways at any time as a matter of individual and \npublic safety.”  §5.61.020(A).  That ordinance is not before the Court to-\nday because, after the only  class representative with standing to chal-\nlenge this ordinance died, the Ninth Circuit remanded to the District \nCourt “to determine whether a substitute representative is available as  \nto that challenge alone.”  72 F. 4th 868, 884 (2023). \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  9 \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nperson who camps in a park after receiving that order com-\nmits criminal trespass, which is punishable by a maximum \nof 30 days in jail and a $1,250 fine. Ore. Rev. Stat. §164.245 \n(2023); see §§161.615(3), 161.635(1)(c). \n  In 2019, the Ninth Circuit held that “‘the Eighth Amend-\n \nment prohibits the imposition of criminal penalties for sit-\nting, sleeping, or lying outside on public property for home-\nless individuals who cannot obtain shelter.’”  Martin v.  \n \nBoise, 920 F. 3d 584, 616, cert. denied, 589 U. S. ___ (2019).  \nConsidering an ordinance from Boise, Idaho, that made it a \nmisdemeanor to use “streets, sidewalks, parks, or public \nplaces” for “camping,” 920 F. 3d, at 603, the court concluded \nthat “as long as there is no option of sleeping indoors, the \ngovernment cannot criminalize indigent, homeless people \nfor sleeping outdoors, on public property,” id., at 617. \n  Respondents here, two longtime residents of Grants Pass \nwho are homeless and sleep in their cars, sued on behalf of \nthemselves and all other involuntarily homeless people in \nthe City, seeking to enjoin enforcement of the Ordinances.  \nThe District Court eventually certified a class and granted \nsummary judgment to respondents.  “As was the case in  \nMartin, Grants Pass has far more homeless people than \n‘practically available’ shelter beds.”  App. to Pet. for Cert.  \n179a. The City had “zero emergency shelter beds,” and even \ncounting the beds at the Gospel Rescue Mission (GRM), \nwhich is “the only entity in Grants Pass that offers any sort \nof temporary program for some class members,” “GRM’s 138 \nbeds would not be nearly enough to accommodate the at \nleast 602 homeless individuals in Grants Pass.”  Id., at \n179a–180a.  Thus, “the only way for homeless people to le-\ngally sleep on public property within the City is if they lay \non the ground with only the clothing on their backs and \nwithout their items near them.”  Id., at 178a. \n  The District Court entered a narrow injunction.  It con-\ncluded that Grants Pass could “implement time and place \nrestrictions for when homeless individuals may use their \n \n\n10  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nbelongings to keep warm and dry and when they must have \ntheir belonging[s] packed up.”  Id., at 199a.  The City could\nalso “ban the use of tents in public parks,” as long as it did \nnot “ban people from using any bedding type materials to \nkeep warm  and dry while they sleep.”  Id., at 199a–200a.  \nFurther, Grants Pass could continue to “enforce laws that  \nactually further public health and safety, such as laws re-\nstricting littering, public urination or defecation, obstruc-\ntion of roadways, possession or distribution of illicit sub-\nstances, harassment, or violence.”  Id., at 200a. \n  The Ninth Circuit largely agreed that the Ordinances vi-\nolated the Eighth Amendment because they punished peo-\nple who lacked “some place, such as [a] shelter, they can \nlawfully sleep.”  72 F. 4th 868, 894 (2023).  It further nar-\nrowed the District Court’s already-limited injunction.  The  \nNinth Circuit noted that, beyond prohibiting bedding, “the \nordinances also prohibit the use of stoves or fires, as well as \nthe erection of any structures.”  Id., at 895.   Because the  \nrecord did not “establis[h that] the fire, stove, and structure \nprohibitions deprive homeless persons of sleep or ‘the most \nrudimentary precautions’ against the elements,” the court \nremanded for the District Court “to craft a narrower injunc-\ntion  recognizing  Plaintiffs’  limited  right  to  protection \nagainst the elements, as well as limitations when a shelter \nbed is available.”  Ibid. \nIII  \n  The Eighth Amendment prohibits the infliction of “cruel \nand  unusual  punishments.”    Amdt.  8  (Punishments  \nClause).  This prohibition, which is not limited to medieval \ntortures, places “‘limitations’ on ‘the power of those en-\n \ntrusted with the criminal-law function of government.’”  \n \nTimbs v. Indiana, 586 U. S. 146, 151 (2019).  The Punish-\nments Clause “circumscribes the criminal process in three \nways: First, it limits the kinds of punishment that can be \nimposed on those convicted of crimes; second, it proscribes  \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  11  \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \npunishment grossly disproportionate to the severity of the \ncrime; and third, it imposes substantive limits on what can \nbe made criminal and punished as such.”  Ingraham v.  \nWright, 430 U. S. 651, 667 (1977) (citations omitted). \nIn Robinson v. California, this Court detailed one sub-\nstantive  limitation  on  criminal  punishment.    Lawrence  \nRobinson  was  convicted  under  a  California  statute  for \n“‘be[ing] addicted to the use of narcotics’” and faced a man-\n   \ndatory 90-day jail sentence. 370 U.  S., at 660.  The Califor-\nnia statute did not “punis[h] a person for the use of narcot-\nics, for their purchase, sale or possession, or for antisocial \nor disorderly behavior resulting from their administration.”  \nId., at 666.  Instead, it made “the ‘status’ of narcotic addic-\ntion a criminal offense, for which the offender may be pros-\necuted ‘at any time before he reforms.’”  Ibid. \n \n  The Court held that, because it criminalized the “‘status’  \n \nof narcotic addiction,” ibid., the California law “inflict[ed] a \ncruel and unusual punishment in violation” of the Punish-\nments Clause, id., at 667.  Importantly, the Court did not \nlimit that holding to the status of narcotic addiction alone.  \nIt began by reasoning that the criminalization of the “men-\ntally ill, or a leper, or [those] afflicted with a venereal dis-\nease” “would doubtless be universally thought to be an in-\nfliction of cruel and unusual punishment.”  Id., at 666.  It \nextended that same reasoning to the status of being an ad-\ndict, because “narcotic addiction is an illness” “which may \nbe contracted innocently or involuntarily.”  Id., at 667. \n  Unlike the majority, see ante, at 15–17, the Robinson  \nCourt did not rely on the harshness of the criminal penalty \nitself.  It understood that “imprisonment for ninety days is\nnot, in the abstract, a punishment which is either cruel or \nunusual.” 370 U. S., at 667.  Instead, it reasoned that, when \nimposed because of a person’s status, “[e]ven one day in \nprison would be a cruel and unusual punishment.”  Ibid. \n  Robinson did not prevent States from using a  variety of \ntools, including criminal law, to address harmful conduct \n \n\n12  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nrelated to a particular status.  The Court candidly recog-\nnized the “vicious evils of the narcotics traffic”  and acknowl-\nedged the “countless fronts on which those evils may be le-\ngitimately attacked.”  Id., at 667–668.  It left untouched the  \n“broad power of a State to regulate the narcotic drugs traffic \nwithin its borders,” including the power to “impose criminal \nsanctions . .  . against the unauthorized manufacture, pre-\nscription, sale, purchase, or possession of narcotics,” and \nthe power to establish “a program of compulsory treatment \nfor those addicted to narcotics.”  Id., at 664–665. \n  This Court has repeatedly cited Robinson for the proposi-\ntion that the “Eighth Amendment . . . imposes a substantive \nlimit on what can be made criminal and punished as such.”  \nRhodes v. Chapman, 452 U. S. 337, 346, n. 12 (1981); see  \nalso Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 172 (1976) (joint opin-\nion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) (“The substantive\nlimits imposed by the Eighth Amendment on what can be \nmade criminal and punished were discussed in Robinson”).   \nThough it casts aspersions on  Robinson and mistakenly \ntreats it as an outlier, the majority does not overrule or re-\nconsider that decision.2  Nor does the majority cast doubt  \non this Court’s firmly rooted principle that inflicting “un-\nnecessary suffering” that is “grossly disproportionate to the \nseverity of the crime” or that serves no “penological pur-\npose” violates the Punishments Clause.  Estelle v. Gamble, \n429 U. S. 97, 103, and n. 7 (1976).  Instead, the majority\nsees this case as requiring an application or extension of \nRobinson. The majority’s understanding of Robinson, how-\never,  is plainly wrong.  \n—————— \n2See ante,  at  20 (“[N]o one has asked us to reconsider Robinson.  Nor  \n \ndo we see any need to do so today”); but see ante, at 23 (gratuitously  \nnoting that  Robinson “sits uneasily with the Amendment’s terms, origi-\nnal meaning, and our precedents”).  The most important takeaway from  \nthese unnecessary swipes at  Robinson is just that.  They are unneces-\nsary.   Robinson remains binding precedent, no matter how incorrectly \nthe majority applies it to these facts.  \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  13  \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nIV \n  Grants Pass’s Ordinances criminalize being homeless.  \nThe status of being homeless (lacking available shelter) is \ndefined by the very behavior singled out for punishment \n(sleeping outside).  The majority protests that the Ordi-\nnances “do not criminalize mere status.”  Ante, at 21.  Say-\ning so does not make it so.  Every shred of evidence points \nthe other way. The Ordinances’ purpose, text, and enforce-\nment confirm that they target status, not conduct.  For \nsomeone with no available shelter, the only way to comply \nwith the Ordinances is to leave Grants Pass altogether. \nA \n  Start with their purpose.  The Ordinances, as enforced, \nare intended to criminalize being homeless.  The Grants  \nPass City Council held a public meeting in 2013 to “‘identify \n \nsolutions to current vagrancy problems.’”  App. to Pet. for \n \nCert. 168a.  The council discussed the City’s previous efforts \nto banish homeless people by “buying the person a bus \nticket to a specific destination,” or transporting them to a  \ndifferent jurisdiction and “leaving them there.”  App. 113– \n114.  That was unsuccessful, so the council discussed other \nideas, including a “‘do not serve’” list or “a ‘most unwanted  \n   \nlist’ made by taking pictures of the offenders .  . . and then \ndisseminating it to all the service agencies.”  Id., at 121.   \nThe council even contemplated denying basic services such \nas “food, clothing, bedding, hygiene, and those types of \nthings.”  Ibid. \n  The idea was deterrence, not altruism.  “[U]ntil the pain \nof staying the same outweighs the pain of changing, people \nwill not change; and some people need an external source \nto motivate that needed change.”  Id., at 119.  One coun-\ncilmember opined that “[m]aybe they aren’t hungry enough \nor cold enough . . . to make a change in their behavior.” Id., \nat 122.  The council president summed up the goal suc-\ncinctly: “‘[T]he point is to make it uncomfortable enough for \n \n \n\n14  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \n[homeless people] in our city so they will want to move on \ndown the road.’”  Id., at 114.3  \n \n  One action item from this meeting was the “‘targeted en-\n \nforcement  of  illegal  camping’”  against  homeless  people.   \n \nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 169a.  “The year following the [public \nmeeting] saw a significant increase in enforcement of the \nCity’s anti-sleeping and anti-camping ordinances.  From  \n2013 through 2018, the City issued a steady stream of tick-\nets under the ordinances.”  72 F. 4th, at 876–877. \nB \n  Next consider the text.  The Ordinances by their terms \nsingle out homeless people.  They define “campsite” as “any \nplace where bedding, sleeping bag, or other material used \nfor bedding purposes” is placed “for the purpose of main-\ntaining a temporary place to live.”  §5.61.010. The majority\nclaims that it “makes no difference whether the charged de-\nfendant is homeless.”  Ante, at 20.  Yet the Ordinances do \nnot apply unless bedding is placed to maintain a temporary \nplace to live.  Thus, “what separates prohibited conduct\nfrom permissible conduct is a person’s intent to ‘live’ in pub-\nlic spaces.  Infants napping in strollers, Sunday afternoon \npicnickers, and nighttime stargazers may all engage in the \nsame conduct of bringing blankets to public spaces [and \nsleeping], but they are exempt from punishment because\nthey have a separate ‘place to live’ to which they presuma-\n—————— \n3The majority does not contest that  the Ordinances, as enforced, are \n \nintended to target homeless people.  The majority observes, however,  \nthat the council also discussed other ways to handle homelessness in \nGrants Pass. See ante, at 12, n. 1.  That is true.  Targeted enforcement \nof the Ordinances to criminalize homelessness was only one solution dis-\ncussed at the meeting.  See App. 131–132 (listing “[a]ctions to move  for-\nward,” including increasing police presence, exclusion zones, “zero toler-\nance” signs, “do not serve” or “most unwanted” lists, trespassing letters, \nand building a sobering center or youth center (internal quotation marks \nomitted)).  \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  15  \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nbly intend to return.”  Brief for Criminal Law and Punish-\nment Scholars as Amici Curiae 12.   \n  Put another way, the Ordinances single out for punish-\nment the activities that define the status of being homeless.  \nBy most definitions, homeless individuals are those that \nlack “a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence.”  \n42 U. S. C. §11434a(2)(A); 24 CFR §§582.5, 578.3 (2023).  \nPermitting  Grants  Pass  to  criminalize  sleeping  outside \nwith as little as a blanket permits Grants Pass to criminal-\nize homelessness.  “There is no . . . separation between be-\ning without available indoor shelter and sleeping in pub-\nlic—they are opposite sides of the same coin.”  Brief for \nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 25.  The Ordinances use \nthe definition of “campsite” as a proxy for homelessness be-\ncause  those  lacking  “a  fixed,  regular,  and  adequate \nnighttime residence” are those who need to sleep in public\nto “maintai[n] a temporary place to live.”   \n  Take the respondents here, two longtime homeless resi-\ndents of Grants Pass who sleep in their cars.  The Ordi-\nnances  define  “campsite”  to  include  “any  vehicle.”  \n§5.61.010(B).  For respondents, the Ordinances as applied \ndo not criminalize any behavior or conduct related to en-\ncampments (such as fires or tents). Instead, the Ordinances  \ntarget respondents’ status as people without any other form \nof shelter.  Under the majority’s logic, cities cannot crimi-\nnalize the status of being homeless, but they can criminal-\nize the conduct that defines that status.  The Constitution  \ncannot be evaded by such formalistic distinctions. \n  The Ordinances’ definition of “campsite” creates a situa-\ntion where homeless people necessarily break the law just \nby existing.  “[U]nsheltered people have no private place to \nsurvive, so they are virtually guaranteed to violate these \npervasive laws.”  S. Rankin, Hiding Homelessness: The \nTranscarceration of Homelessness, 109 Cal.  L. Rev. 559, \n561 (2021); see also Disability Rights Brief 2 (“[T]he mem-\nbers of Grants Pass’s homeless community do not choose to  \n \n\n16  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nbe homeless.  Instead, in a city with no public shelters, they \nhave no alternative but to sleep in parks or on the street”).  \nEvery human needs to sleep at some point.  Even if home-\nless people  with no available shelter options can exist for a \nfew days in Grants Pass without sleeping, they eventually\nmust leave or be criminally punished.\n  The majority resists this understanding, arguing that the \nOrdinances criminalize the conduct of being homeless in \nGrants Pass while sleeping with as little as a blanket.   \nTherefore, the argument goes, “[r]ather than criminalize \nmere status, Grants Pass forbids actions.”  Ante, at 20.   \nWith no discussion about what it means to criminalize “sta-\ntus” or “conduct,” the majority’s analysis consists of a few \nsentences repeating its conclusion again and again in hopes \nthat it will become true.  See ante, at 20–21 (proclaiming \nthat the Ordinances “forbi[d] actions” “[r]ather than crimi-\nnalize mere status”; and that they “do not criminalize mere \nstatus”).  The best the majority can muster is the following \ntautology: The Ordinances criminalize conduct, not pure \nstatus, because they apply to conduct, not status.\n  The flaw in this conclusion is evident.  The majority coun-\ntenances the criminalization of status as long as the City \ntacks on an essential bodily function—blinking, sleeping, \neating, or breathing.  That is just another way to ban the \nperson.  By this logic, the majority would conclude that the \nordinance deemed unconstitutional in Robinson criminaliz-\ning “being an addict” would be constitutional if it criminal-\nized “being an addict and breathing.”  Or take the example  \nin Robinson: “Even one day in prison would be a cruel and \nunusual punishment for the ‘crime’ of having a common \ncold.” 370 U. S., at 667.  According to the majority, although \nit is cruel and unusual to punish someone for having a com-\nmon cold, it is not cruel and unusual to punish them for \nsniffling or coughing because of that cold.  See Manning v.  \nCaldwell, 930 F. 3d 264, 290 (CA4 2019) (Wilkinson, J., dis-\nsenting) (“In the rare case where the Eighth Amendment \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  17  \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nwas found to invalidate a criminal law, the law in question \nsought to punish persons merely for their need to eat or \nsleep, which are essential bodily functions.  This is simply  \na variation of Robinson’s command that the state identify\nconduct in crafting its laws, rather than punish a person’s \nmere existence” (citation omitted)). \nC \n  The Ordinances are enforced exactly as intended: to crim-\ninalize the status of being homeless.  City officials sought \nto use the Ordinances to drive homeless people out of town.  \nSee supra, at 13–14.  The message to homeless residents is  \nclear.  As Debra Blake, a named plaintiff who passed away\nwhile this case was pending, see n. 1, supra, shared: \n  “I have been repeatedly told by Grants Pass police\nthat I must ‘move along’ and  that there is nowhere in \nGrants Pass that I can legally sit or rest.  I have been \nrepeatedly  awakened  by  Grants  Pass  police  while \nsleeping and told that I need to get  up and move.  I have \nbeen told by Grants Pass police that I should leave \ntown.  \n  Because I have no choice but to live outside and have \nno place else to go, I have gotten tickets, fines and have \nbeen criminally prosecuted for being homeless.”  App.\n180–181. \nDebra Blake’s heartbreaking message captures the cruelty \nof criminalizing someone for their status: “I am afraid at all \ntimes in Grants Pass that I could be arrested, ticketed and \nprosecuted for sleeping outside or for covering myself with \na blanket to stay warm.”   Id., at 182.  So, at times, when she \ncould, Blake “slept outside of the city.”  Ibid.  Blake, who \nwas disabled, unemployed, and elderly, “owe[d] the City of \nGrants Pass more than $5000 in fines for crimes and viola-\ntions related directly to [her] involuntary homelessness and \nthe fact that there is no affordable housing or emergency \n \n\n18  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nshelters in Grants Pass where [she could] stay.”  Ibid. \n  Another homeless individual was found outside a non-\nprofit “in severe distress outside in the frigid air.”  Id., at  \n109. “[H]e could not breathe and he was experiencing acute \npain,” and he “disclosed fear that he would be arrested and \ntrespassed again for being outside.”  Ibid.  Another, Carri-\neLynn Hill, whose story you read earlier, see supra, at 7,  \nwas ticketed for “lying down on a friend’s mat” and “lying \ndown under a tarp to stay warm.”  App. 134.  She was “con-\nstantly afraid” of being “cited and arrested for being outside \nin Grants Pass.”  Ibid.  She is unable to stay at the only \nshelter in the City because she cannot keep her nebulizer, \nwhich she needs throughout the night, in her room. So she  \ndoes “not know of anywhere in the city of Grants Pass \nwhere [she] can safely sleep or rest without being arrested, \ntrespassed, or moved along.”  Id., at 135.  As she put it: “The \nonly way I have figured out how to get by is try to stay out \nof sight and out of mind.”  Ibid.   Stories like these fill the \nrecord and confirm the City’s success in targeting the status \nof being homeless. \n  The majority proclaims, with no citation, that “it makes \nno difference whether the charged defendant is homeless, a \nbackpacker on vacation passing through town, or a student \nwho abandons his dorm room to camp out in protest.”  Ante,  \nat 20. That describes a fantasy.  In reality, the deputy chief \nof police operations acknowledged that he was not aware of \n“any non-homeless person ever getting a ticket for illegal \ncamping in Grants Pass.”  Tr. of Jim Hamilton in Blake  v.  \nGrants Pass, No. 1:18–cr–01823 (D Ore., Oct. 16, 2019), \nECF Doc. 63–4, p. 16.  Officers testified that “laying on a  \nblanket  enjoying  the  park”  would  not  violate  the  ordi-\nnances, ECF Doc. 63–7, at 2; and that bringing a sleeping \nbag to “look at stars” would not be  punished, ECF Doc. 63–\n5, at 5.  Instead, someone violates the Ordinance only if he \nor she does not “have another home to go to.”  Id., at 6. That \nis the definition of being homeless.  The majority does not \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  19  \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \ncontest any of this.  So much for the Ordinances applying to \nbackpackers and students. \nV \n  Robinson should squarely resolve this case.  Indeed, the \nmajority seems to agree that an ordinance that fined and\njailed “homeless” people would be unconstitutional.  See \nante, at 21 (disclaiming that the Ordinances “criminalize \nmere status”).  The majority resists a straightforward ap-\nplication of Robinson by speculating about policy consider-\nations and fixating on extensions of the Ninth Circuit’s nar-\nrow rule in Martin. \n  The majority is wrong on all accounts.  First, no one con-\ntests the power of local governments to address homeless-\nness.  Second, the majority overstates the line-drawing \nproblems that this case presents.  Third, a straightforward  \napplication of Robinson does not conflict with Powell v. \nTexas, 392 U. S. 514 (1968).  Finally, the majority draws the \nwrong  message  from  the  various  amici  requesting  this \nCourt’s guidance. \nA \n  No one contests that local governments can regulate the \ntime, place, and manner of public sleeping pursuant to their \npower to “enact regulations in the interest of the public \nsafety, health, welfare or convenience.”  Schneider v. State \n(Town of Irvington), 308 U. S. 147, 160 (1939).  This power\nincludes controlling “the use of public streets and side-\nwalks, over which a municipality must rightfully exercise a \ngreat deal of control in the interest of traffic regulation and \npublic safety.”  Shuttlesworth v.  Birmingham, 394 U. S. \n147, 152 (1969).  When  exercising that power, however, reg-\nulations still “may not abridge the individual liberties se-\ncured by the Constitution.”  Schneider, 308 U. S., at 160. \n  The Ninth Circuit in Martin provided that “an ordinance \n \n\n20  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nviolates the Eighth Amendment insofar as it imposes crim-\ninal sanctions against homeless individuals for sleeping \noutdoors, on public property, when no alternative shelter is \navailable to them.” 920 F. 3d, at 604.  Martin was narrow.4   \nConsider these qualifications:  \n“[O]ur holding does not cover individuals who do have \naccess to adequate temporary shelter, whether because \nthey have the means to pay for it or because it is real-\nistically available to them for free, but who choose not \nto use it.  Nor do we suggest that a jurisdiction with \ninsufficient shelter can never criminalize the act of  \nsleeping outside.  Even where shelter is unavailable, an \nordinance prohibiting sitting, lying, or sleeping outside \nat particular times or in particular locations might well \nbe constitutionally permissible.  So, too, might an ordi-\nnance barring the obstruction of public rights of way or \nthe erection of certain structures.”  Id., at 617, n. 8 (ci-\ntation omitted). \nUpholding Martin  does not call into question all the other\ntools that a city has to deal with homelessness.  “Some cities  \nhave established approved encampments on public prop-\nerty with security, services, and other resources; others  \nhave sought to impose geographic and time-limited bans on \npublic sleeping; and others have worked to clear and clean \nparticularly dangerous encampments after providing notice \nand reminders to those who lived there.”  California Brief \n14. Others might “limit the use of fires, whether for cooking \nor other purposes” or “ban (or enforce already-existing bans \non) particular conduct that negatively affects other people, \nincluding harassment of passersby, illegal drug use, and lit-\ntering.”  Brief for Maryland et al. as Amici Curiae 12.  All \n—————— \n4Some district  courts have since interpreted Martin broadly, relying\n \non it to enjoin time, place, and manner restrictions on camping outside.   \nSee ante, at 7–10, 28–29.  This Court is not asked today to consider any \nof these interpretations or extensions of Martin. \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  21  \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nof these tools remain available to localities seeking to ad-\ndress homelessness within constitutional bounds. \nB \n  The scope of this dispute is narrow.  Respondents do not\nchallenge the City’s “restrictions on the use of tents or other \ncamping gear,” “encampment clearances,” “time and place\nrestrictions on sleeping outside,” or “the imposition of fines \nor jail time on homeless people who decline accessible shel-\nter options.”  Brief for Respondents 18.\n  That means the majority does not need to answer most of \nthe hypotheticals it poses.  The City’s hypotheticals, echoed \nthroughout the majority opinion, concern “violent crime, \ndrug overdoses, disease, fires, and  hazardous waste.”  Brief \nfor Petitioner 47.  For the most part, these concerns are not \nimplicated in this case.  The District Court’s injunction, for\nexample, permits the City to prohibit “littering, public uri-\nnation or defecation, obstruction of roadways, possession or \ndistribution of illicit substances, harassment, or violence.”   \nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 200a.  The majority’s framing of the \nproblem as one involving drugs, diseases, and fires instead \nof one involving people trying to keep warm outside with a \nblanket just provides the Court with cover to permit the\ncriminalization of homeless people. \n  The majority also overstates the line-drawing problems \nthat  a  baseline  Eighth  Amendment  standard  presents.  \nConsider the “unavoidable” “difficult questions” that dis-\ncombobulate the majority.  Ante, at 32–33.  Courts answer \nsuch factual questions every day.  For example, the major-\nity asks: “What does it mean to be ‘involuntarily’ homeless \nwith ‘no place to go’?”  Ibid.  Martin’s answer was clear: It  \nis when “‘there is a greater number of homeless individuals \n \nin [a city] than the number of available beds [in shelters,]’” \n \nnot including “individuals who do have access to adequate\ntemporary shelter, whether because they have the means \nto pay for it or because it is realistically available to them  \n \n\n22  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nfor free.”  920 F. 3d, at 617, and n.  8.  The District Court \nhere found that Grants Pass had “zero emergency shelter \nbeds” and that Gospel Rescue Mission’s “138 beds would not \nbe nearly enough to accommodate the at least 602 homeless \nindividuals in Grants Pass.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 179a– \n180a.  The majority also asks: “[W]hat are people entitled \nto do and use in public spaces to ‘keep warm’”?  Ante, at 33.  \n \nThe District Court’s opinion also provided a clear answer: \nThey are permitted “bedding type materials to keep warm \nand dry,” but cities can still “implement time and place re-\nstrictions for when homeless individuals . . . must have  \ntheir belonging[s] packed up.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 199a.  \nUltimately, these are not metaphysical questions but fac-\ntual ones. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C. §11302 (defining “homeless,” \n“homeless  individual,”  and  “homeless  person”);  24  CFR \n§582.5 (defining “[a]n individual or family who lacks a fixed, \nregular, and adequate nighttime residence”).\n  Just because the majority can list difficult questions that \nrequire answers, see ante, at 33, n.  8, does not absolve fed-\neral judges of the responsibility to interpret and enforce the \nsubstantive bounds of the Constitution.  The majority pro-\nclaims that this dissent “blinks the difficult questions.”   \nAnte, at 32.  The majority should open its eyes to available \nanswers instead of throwing up its hands in defeat. \nC \n  The majority next spars with a strawman in its discus-\nsion of  Powell v. Texas. The Court in Powell considered the  \ndistinction between status and conduct but could not agree \non a controlling rationale.  Four Justices concluded that \nRobinson covered any “condition [the defendant] is power-\nless to change,” 392 U. S., at 567 (Fortas, J., dissenting), \nand four Justices rejected that view.  Justice White, casting \nthe decisive fifth vote, left the question open because the \ndefendant had “made no showing that he was unable to stay \noff the streets on the night in question.” Id., at 554 (opinion \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  23  \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nconcurring in judgment).  So, in his view, it was “unneces-\nsary to pursue at this point the further definition of the cir-\ncumstances or the state of intoxication which might bar \nconviction of a chronic alcoholic for being drunk in a public \nplace.”  Id., at 553. \n  This case similarly called for a straightforward applica-\ntion of  Robinson. The majority finds it telling that this dis-\nsent “barely mentions”  Justice Marshall’s opinion in Powell. \nAnte, at 32.5  The majority completely misses the point.  \nEven Justice Marshall’s plurality opinion in Powell agreed\nthat Robinson prohibited enforcing laws criminalizing “a \nmere status.”  392 U. S., at 532.  The Powell Court consid-\nered a statute that criminalized voluntary conduct (getting \ndrunk) that could be rendered involuntary by a status (al-\ncoholism); here, the Ordinances criminalize conduct (sleep-\ning outside) that defines a particular status (homelessness).  \nSo unlike the debate in  Powell, this case does not turn on  \nwhether the criminalized actions are “‘involuntary’ or ‘oc-\n \ncasioned by’” a particular status.  Id., at 533 (Marshall, J.,  \n \ndissenting). For all the reasons discussed above, see supra, \nat 13–19, these Ordinances criminalize status and are thus  \nunconstitutional under any of the opinions in  Powell. \nD \n  The majority does not let the reader forget that “a large \nnumber  of  States,  cities,  and  counties”  all  “urg[ed]  the \nCourt to grant review.”  Ante, at 14; see also ante, at 9 (“An \nexceptionally large number of cities and States have filed \nbriefs in this Court”); ante, at 34 (noting the “multitude of \n—————— \n5The majority claims that this dissent does  not dispute that Robinson  \n \nis “hard to square” with the Eighth Amendment’s “text and this Court’s \nother precedents.”  Ante, at 32.  That is wrong.  See supra, at 12 (recog-\nnizing Robinson’s well-established rule).  The majority also claims that  \nthis dissent “ignores Robinson’s own insistence that a different result  \nwould have obtained in that case if the law there had proscribed an act \nrather than status alone.”  Ante, at 32.  That too is wrong. See supra, at \n11–12 (discussing  Robinson’s distinction between status and conduct).  \n \n\n24  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \namicus briefs before us”); ante, at 14, n. 3 (listing certiorari-\nstage amici).  No one contests that States, cities, and coun-\nties could benefit from this Court’s guidance.  Yet the ma-\njority relies on these amici to shift the goalposts and focus \non policy questions beyond the scope of this case.  It first \ndeclares that “[t]he only question we face is whether one \nspecific provision of the Constitution . . . prohibits the en-\nforcement of public-camping laws.”  Ante, at 31.  Yet it  \nquickly shifts gears and claims that “the question this case \npresents is whether the Eighth Amendment grants federal \njudges primary responsibility for assessing those causes [of \nhomelessness] and devising those responses.”  Ante, at 34.   \nThis sleight of hand allows the majority to abdicate its re-\nsponsibility to answer the first (legal) question by declining \nto answer the second (policy) one. \n  The  majority  cites  various  amicus  briefs  to  amplify\nGrants Pass’s belief that its homelessness crisis is intracta-\nble absent the ability to criminalize homelessness.  In so  \ndoing, the majority chooses to see only what it wants.  Many \nof those stakeholders support the narrow rule in Martin. \nSee, e.g., Brief for City and County of San Francisco et al.  \nas Amici Curiae 4 (“[U]nder the Eighth Amendment  . . . a  \nlocal municipality may not prohibit sleeping—a biological \nnecessity—in all public spaces at all times and under all \nconditions, if there is no alternative space available in the \njurisdiction for unhoused people to sleep”); Brief for City of \nLos Angeles as Amicus Curiae 1 (“The City agrees with the \nbroad premise underlying the Martin and Johnson deci-\nsions: when a person has no other place to sleep, sleeping \nat night in a public space should not be a crime leading to \nan arrest, criminal conviction, or jail”); California Brief 2–3 \n(“[T]he Constitution does not allow the government to pun-\nish people for the status of being homeless.  Nor should it \nallow the government to effectively punish the status of be-\ning homeless by making it a crime in all events for someone \nwith no other options to sleep outside on public property at \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  25  \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nnight”). \n  Even  the  Federal  Government,  which  restricts  some  \nsleeping activities on park lands, see ante,  at 7, has for \nnearly three decades “taken the position that laws prohib-\niting sleeping in public at all times and in all places violate \nthe Robinson principle as applied to individuals who have \nno access to shelter.” Brief for United States as Amicus Cu-\nriae 14.  The same is true of States across the Nation.  See \nBrief for Maryland et al. as Amici Curiae 3–4 (“Taking \nthese policies [criminalizing homelessness] off the table \ndoes not interfere with our ability to address homelessness \n(including the effects of homelessness on surrounding com-\nmunities) using other policy tools, nor does it amount to an \nundue intrusion on state sovereignty”). \n  Nothing in today’s decision prevents these States, cities, \nand counties from declining to criminalize people for sleep-\ning in public when they have no available shelter.  Indeed,  \nalthough the majority describes Martin as adopting an un-\nworkable rule, the elected representatives in Oregon codi-\nfied that very rule.  See infra, at 26.  The majority does \nthese localities a disservice by ascribing to them a demand \nfor unfettered freedom to punish that many do not seek.  \nVI \n  The Court wrongly concludes that the Eighth Amend-\nment permits Ordinances that effectively criminalize being\nhomeless.  Grants Pass’s Ordinances may still raise a host \nof other legal issues.  Perhaps recognizing the untenable \nposition it adopts, the majority stresses that “many sub-\nstantive legal protections and provisions of the Constitution \nmay have important roles to play when States and cities \nseek to enforce their laws against the homeless.”  Ante, at \n31.  That is true.  Although I do not prejudge the merits of \nthese other issues, I detail some here so that people experi-\nencing homelessness and their advocates do not take the \n \n\n26  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nCourt’s decision today as closing the door on such claims.6  \nA \n  The Court today does not decide whether the Ordinances \nare valid under a new Oregon law that codifies Martin.  In  \n2021, Oregon passed a law that constrains the ability of mu-\nnicipalities to punish homeless residents for public sleep-\ning.  “Any city or county law that regulates the acts of sit-\nting, lying, sleeping or keeping warm and dry outdoors on \npublic property that is open to the public must be objec-\ntively reasonable as to time, place and manner with regards \nto persons experiencing homelessness.”  Ore. Rev. Stat. \n§195.530(2).  The law also grants persons “experiencing\nhomelessness” a cause of action to “bring suit for injunctive \nor declaratory relief to challenge the objective reasonable-\nness” of an ordinance.  §195.530(4).  This law was meant to  \n“‘ensure that individuals experiencing homelessness are \n \nprotected from fines or arrest for sleeping or camping on \npublic property when there are no  other options.’”  Brief in  \n \nOpposition 35 (quoting Speaker T. Kotek, Hearing on H. B. \n3115 before the House Committee on the Judiciary, 2021 \nReg. Sess. (Ore., Mar. 9, 2021)).  The panel below already\nconcluded that “[t]he city ordinances addressed in Grants \nPass will be superseded, to some extent,” by this new law.  \n72 F. 4th, at 924, n. 7.  Courts may need to determine \nwhether and how the new law limits the City’s enforcement \nof its Ordinances. \nB \n  The Court today also does not decide whether the Ordi-\nnances violate the Eighth Amendment’s Excessive Fines\nClause.  That Clause separately “limits the government’s \n—————— \n6The majority does not address whether the Eighth Amendment re-\n \nquires a more  particularized inquiry into the circumstances of the indi-\nviduals subject to the City’s  ordinances.  See Brief for United States as \nAmicus Curiae  27.  I therefore do not discuss that issue here. \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  27  \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \npower to extract payments, whether in cash or in kind, as \npunishment for some offense.”  United States v. Bajakajian, \n524 U. S. 321, 328 (1998) (internal quotation  marks omit-\nted).  “The touchstone of the constitutional inquiry under \nthe Excessive Fines Clause is the principle of proportional-\nity: The amount of the forfeiture must bear some relation-\nship to the gravity of the offense that it is designed to pun-\nish.”  Id., at 334. \n  The District Court in this case concluded that the fines \nhere serve “no remedial purpose” but rather are “intended \nto  deter  homeless  individuals  from  residing  in  Grants \nPass.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 189a.  Because it concluded \nthat the fines are punitive, it went on to determine that the \nfines are “‘grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the of-\n \nfense’” and thus excessive.  Ibid.   The Ninth Circuit de-\n \nclined to consider this holding because the City presented \n“no meaningful argument on appeal regarding the exces-\nsive fines issue.”  72 F. 4th, at 895.  On remand, the Ninth \nCircuit is free to consider whether the City forfeited its ap-\npeal on this ground and, if not, whether this issue has \nmerit. \nC \n  Finally, the Court does not decide whether the Ordi-\nnances violate the Due Process Clause.  “The Due Process \nClauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments ensure  \nthat officials may not displace certain rules associated with \ncriminal liability that are ‘so old and venerable,’ ‘“so rooted \n \nin the traditions and conscience of our people[,] as to be \nranked as fundamental.”’”  Ante,  at 15 (quoting Kahler v. \n  \nKansas, 589 U. S. 271, 279 (2020)).  The majority notes that\ndue process arguments in Robinson “may have made some  \nsense.”  Ante, at 19.  On that score, I agree.  “[H]istorically, \ncrimes in England and this country have usually required \nproof of some act (or actus reus) undertaken with some  \nmeasure of  volition (mens rea).” Ibid. “This view ‘took deep \n \n\n28  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nand early root in American soil’ where, to this day, a crime \nordinarily arises ‘only from concurrence of an evil-meaning \nmind with an evil-doing hand.’  Morissette v. United States, \n342 U. S. 246, 251–252 (1952).”  Ibid.  Yet the law at issue  \nin Robinson  “was an anomaly, as it required proof of neither \nof those things.”  Ante, at 19. \n  Relatedly, this Court has concluded that some vagrancy \nlaws are unconstitutionally vague.  See, e.g.,  Kolender v. \nLawson, 461 U. S. 352, 361–362 (1983) (invalidating Cali-\nfornia law that required people who loiter or wander on the \nstreet to provide identification and account for their pres-\nence); Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S. 156, 161–162  \n(1972) (concluding that vagrancy law employing “ ‘archaic \n \nlanguage’” in its definition was “void for vagueness”); ac-\n \ncord, Desertrain v.  Los Angeles, 754 F. 3d 1147, 1155–1157 \n(CA9 2014) (holding that an ordinance prohibiting the use \nof a vehicle as “‘living quarters’” was void for vagueness be-\n   \ncause the ordinance did not define “living quarters”).  Other \npotentially relevant due process precedents abound.  See,  \ne.g., Winters v. New York, 333 U. S. 507, 520 (1948) (“Where \na statute is so vague as to make criminal an innocent act, a \nconviction under it cannot be sustained”); Chicago v. Mo-\nrales, 527 U. S. 41, 57 (1999) (opinion of Stevens, J.) (inval-\nidating ordinance that failed “to distinguish between inno-\ncent conduct and conduct threatening harm”). \n  The Due Process Clause may well place constitutional \nlimits on anti-homelessness ordinances.  See,  e.g., Memorial \nHospital v. Maricopa County, 415 U. S. 250, 263–264 (1974) \n(considering statute that denied people medical care de-\npending on duration of residency and concluding that “to \nthe extent the purpose of the [statute] is to inhibit the im-\nmigration of indigents generally, that goal is constitution-\nally impermissible”); Pottinger  v. Miami, 810 F.  Supp. 1551, \n1580 (SD Fla. 1992) (concluding that “enforcement of laws \nthat prevent homeless individuals who have no place to go \nfrom  sleeping”  might  also  unconstitutionally  “burde[n] \n \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  29  \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \ntheir right to travel”); see also ante, at 21, n. 5 (noting that \nthese Ordinances “may implicate due process and our prec-\nedents regarding selective prosecution”). \nD \n  The Ordinances might also implicate other legal issues.  \nSee, e.g., Trop, 356 U. S., at 101 (plurality opinion) (con-\ncluding that a law that banishes people threatens “the total \ndestruction of the individual’s status in organized society”); \nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 21 (describing the \nOrdinances here as “akin to a form of banishment, a meas-\nure that is now generally recognized as contrary to our Na-\ntion’s legal tradition”); Lavan v.  Los Angeles, 693 F. 3d \n1022, 1029 (CA9 2012) (holding that a city violated home-\nless plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment rights by seizing and de-\nstroying property in an encampment, because “[v]iolation of \na City ordinance does not vitiate the Fourth Amendment’s \nprotection of one’s property”).\n  The Court’s misstep today is confined to its application of \nRobinson. It is quite possible, indeed likely, that these and \nsimilar ordinances will face more days in court. \n*  *  * \n  Homelessness in America is a complex and heartbreaking \ncrisis.  People experiencing homelessness face immense \nchallenges, as do local and state governments.  Especially\nin the face of these challenges, this Court has an obligation \nto apply the Constitution faithfully and evenhandedly. \n  The Eighth Amendment prohibits punishing homeless-\nness by criminalizing sleeping outside when an individual \nhas nowhere else to go.  It is cruel and unusual to apply any \npenalty “selectively to minorities whose numbers are few, \nwho are outcasts of society, and who are unpopular, but \nwhom society is willing to see suffer though it would not \ncountenance general application of the same penalty across \nthe board.”  Furman v.  Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 245 (1972) \n \n\n30  CITY OF GRANTS PASS  v. JOHNSON  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \n(Douglas, J., concurring).\n  I remain hopeful that our society will come together “to \naddress the complexities of the homelessness challenge fac-\ning the most vulnerable among us.”  Ante, at  34.  That re-\nsponsibility is shared by those vulnerable populations, the \nStates and cities in which they reside, and each and every \none of us.  “It is only after we begin to see a street as our  \nstreet, a public park as our park, a school as our school, that \nwe can become engaged citizens, dedicating our time and \nresources for worthwhile causes.”  M. Desmond, Evicted:  \nProperty and Profit in the American City 294 (2016). \n  This Court, too, has a role to play in faithfully enforcing \nthe Constitution to prohibit punishing the very existence of \nthose without shelter.  I remain hopeful that someday in \nthe near future, this Court will play its role in safeguarding \nconstitutional liberties for the most vulnerable among us.  \nBecause the Court today abdicates that role, I respectfully \ndissent. \n ",

CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nSUMMARY** \n \n \nCivil Rights \n  The panel affirmed in part and vacated in part the district \ncourt’s summary judgment and its permanent injunction in \nfavor of plaintiffs; affirmed certification pursuant to Fed. R. \nCiv.  P.  23(b)(2),  of  a  class  of  “involuntary  homeless” \npersons; and remanded in an action challenging municipal \nordinances which, among other things, preclude homeless \npersons from using a blanket, a pillow, or cardboard box for \nprotection  from  the  elements  while  sleeping  within  the \nCity’s limits. \n \n  The  five  ordinances,  described  as  an  “anti-sleeping” \nordinance,  two  “anti-camping”  ordinances,  a  “park \nexclusion”  ordinance,  and  a  “park  exclusion  appeals” \nordinance, result in civil fines up to several hundred dollars \nper violation.  Persons found to violate ordinances multiple \ntimes could be barred from all City property.  If a homeless \nperson is found on City property after receiving an exclusion \norder, they are subject to criminal prosecution for trespass.     \n \n  The panel stated that this court’s decision in Martin v. \nCity of Boise, 902 F.3d 1031 (9th Cir. 2018), which held that \n“the Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of criminal \npenalties for sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public \nproperty  for  homeless  individuals  who  cannot  obtain \nshelter” served as the backdrop for this entire litigation.   \n \n \n** This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.  It \nhas been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 3 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  3 \n \n  The panel first rejected the City’s argument that the \ndistrict court lacked jurisdiction because plaintiffs’ claims \nwere moot or because plaintiffs failed to identify any relief \nthat was within a federal court’s power to redress.  The panel \nheld  that  there  was  abundant  evidence  in  the  record \nestablishing that homeless persons were injured by the City’s \nenforcement actions in the past and it was undisputed that \nenforcements have continued. The panel further held that the \nrelief sought by plaintiffs, enjoining enforcement of a few \nmunicipal  ordinances  aimed  at  involuntary  homeless \npersons, was redressable within the limits of Article III.  The \ndeath of class representative Debra Blake while the matter \nwas on appeal did not moot the class’s claims as to all \nchallenged  ordinances  except  possibly  the  anti-sleeping \nordinance.  The panel vacated the summary judgment as to \nthat ordinance and remanded to allow the district court the \nopportunity to substitute a class representative in Blake’s \nstead.  The remaining class representatives had standing to \nchallenge the park exclusion, criminal trespass and anti-\ncamping ordinances.   \n \n  The panel held that based on the record in this case, the \ndistrict court did not err by finding plaintiffs satisfied the \nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) such that a class could \nbe  certified  under  Rule  23(b)(2).    Although  the  City \nappeared to suggest that Martin’s need for an individualized \ninquiry  of  each  alleged  involuntary  homeless  person’s \naccess  to  shelter  defeated  numerosity,  commonality  and \ntypicality, the panel held that nothing in Martin precluded \nclass actions.  The panel held that the district court did not \nabuse  its  discretion  in  concluding  the  numerosity \nrequirement was met; that plaintiffs’ claims presented at \nleast one question and answer common to the class; and the \nclass representatives’ claims and defenses were typical of the \nclass in that they were homeless persons who claimed that \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 4 of 86\n4  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nthe City could not enforce the challenged ordinances against \nthem when they have no shelter. \n \n  Addressing the merits, the panel affirmed the district \ncourt’s  ruling  that  the  City  of  Grants  Pass  could  not, \nconsistent with the Eighth Amendment, enforce its anti-\ncamping ordinances against homeless persons for the mere \nact of sleeping outside with rudimentary protection from the \nelements, or for sleeping in their car at night, when there was \nno other place in the City for them to go.  The panel held that \nMartin applied to civil citations where, as here, the civil and \ncriminal punishments were closely intertwined.   \n \n  There was no need to resolve whether the fines imposed \nunder the anti-sleeping anti-camping ordinances violated the \nEighth Amendment’s prohibition on excessive fines because \nthe permanent injunction would result in no class member \nbeing fined for engaging in such protected activity.  Finally, \nthe panel held that it was unnecessary to decide whether \nplaintiffs  properly  pled  their  procedural  due  process \nchallenge to the park exclusion appeals ordinance because \nsubsequent to the district court’s order, the City amended the \nordinance.   \n \n  The panel directed the district court on remand to narrow \nits  injunction  to  enjoin  only  those  portions  of  the  anti-\ncamping ordinances that prohibited conduct protected by \nMartin and this opinion.  In particular, the district court \nshould narrow its injunction to the anti-camping ordinances \nand enjoin enforcement of those ordinances only against \ninvoluntarily  homeless  person  for  engaging  in  conduct \nnecessary to protect themselves from the elements when \nthere was no shelter space available.   \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 5 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  5 \n \n  Dissenting, Judge Collins stated that Martin seriously \nmisconstrued  the  Eighth  Amendment  and  the  Supreme \nCourt’s caselaw construing it, but even assuming that Martin \nremained good law, today’s decision—which both misread \nand greatly expanded Martin’s holding—was egregiously \nwrong.    To  make  things  worse,  the  majority  opinion \ncombined its gross misreading of Martin, which requires an \nindividualized inquiry, with a flagrant disregard of settled \nclass-certification  principles  pertaining  to  commonality \nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and the requirements of Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(b).  The end result of this amalgamation of error \nwas that the majority validated the core aspects of the district \ncourt’s  extraordinary  injunction  in  this  case,  which \neffectively requires the City of Grants Pass to allow all but \none of its public parks to be used as homeless encampments. \n \n \nCOUNSEL \n \nAaron P.

CITY OF GRANTS PASS  7 \n \nOPINION \nSILVER, District Judge: \nThe  City  of  Grants  Pass  in  southern  Oregon  has  a \npopulation of approximately 38,000.  At least fifty, and \nperhaps as many as 600, homeless persons live in the City.1  \nAnd  the  number  of  homeless  persons  outnumber  the \navailable shelter beds.  In other words, homeless persons \nhave nowhere to shelter and sleep in the City other than on \nthe  streets  or  in  parks.    Nonetheless,  City  ordinances \npreclude homeless persons from using a blanket, a pillow, or \na cardboard box for protection from the elements while \nsleeping within the City’s limits.  The ordinances result in \ncivil fines up to several hundred dollars per violation and \npersons found to violate ordinances multiple times can be \nbarred from all City property.  And if a homeless person is \nfound on City property after receiving an exclusion order, \nthey are subject to criminal prosecution for trespass. \nIn September 2018, a three-judge panel issued Martin v. \nCity of Boise, 902 F.3d 1031 (9th Cir. 2018), holding “the \nEighth  Amendment  prohibits  the  imposition  of  criminal \npenalties for sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public \nproperty  for  homeless  individuals  who  cannot  obtain \nshelter.”  Id. at 1048.  Approximately six weeks after the \ninitial Martin panel opinion, three homeless individuals filed \na putative class action complaint against the City arguing a \nnumber  of  City  ordinances  were  unconstitutional.    The \ndistrict court certified a class of “involuntarily homeless” \npersons and later granted partial summary judgment in favor \n \n1 During this litigation the parties have used different phrases when \nreferring to this population.  For simplicity, we use “homeless persons” \nthroughout this opinion. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 8 of 86\n8  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nof the class.2  After the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed some \nclaims not resolved at summary judgment, the district court \nissued  a  permanent  injunction  prohibiting  enforcement \nagainst  the  class  members  of  some  City  ordinances,  at \ncertain times, in certain places.  The City now appeals, \narguing this case is moot, the class should not have been \ncertified, the claims fail on the merits, and Plaintiffs did not \nadequately plead one of their theories.  On the material \naspects of this case, the district court was right.3 \n \n2 Persons are involuntarily homeless if they do not “have access to \nadequate temporary shelter, whether because they have the means to pay \nfor it or because it is realistically available to them for free.” See Martin, \n920 F.3d at 617 n.8.  However, someone who has the financial means to \nobtain shelter, or someone who is staying in an emergency shelter is not \ninvoluntarily homeless. See id. at 617 n.8.  Contrary to the City’s \nargument, this definition of involuntary homelessness is not the same as \nthe definition of “homeless” found in regulations for the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, 24 C.F.R. § 582.5, or the McKinney-\nVento Act, 42 U.S.C. § 11434a(2), the federal law regarding the right of \nhomeless children to a public education.  For example, the McKinney-\nVento Act includes as “homeless children and youths” persons who may \nnot qualify as involuntarily homeless under Martin, such as children and \nyouths  “living  in  emergency  or  transitional  shelters.”    42  U.S.C. \n§ 11434a(2).  Though the district court noted in part that Plaintiffs met \nthe definition of homelessness set forth in 24 C.F.R. § 582.5, the district \ncourt also relied on the specific definition of unsheltered homeless \npersons  set  forth  in  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban \nDevelopment’s  regulations  regarding  point-in-time  counts:  “persons \nwho are living in a place not designed or ordinarily used as a regular \nsleeping accommodation for humans must be counted as unsheltered \nhomeless persons.”  24 C.F.R. § 578.7(c)(2)(i). \n3 Our dissenting colleague’s strong disagreement with the majority \nlargely arises from his disapproval of Martin.  See, e.g., Dissent 50 \n(“Even assuming Martin remains good law . . .”); Dissent 83 (“. . . and \nthe gravity of Martin’s errors.”); Dissent 85 (claiming, without evidence, \nthat “it is hard to deny that Martin has ‘generate[d] dire practical \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 9 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  9 \n \nI. \nThis case involves challenges to five provisions of the \nGrants Pass Municipal Code (“GPMC”).  The provisions can \nbe described as an “anti-sleeping” ordinance, two “anti-\ncamping” ordinances, a “park exclusion” ordinance, and a \n“park exclusion appeals” ordinance.  When the district court \nentered judgment, the various ordinances consisted of the \nfollowing. \nFirst, the anti-sleeping ordinance stated, in full \nSleeping  on  Sidewalks,  Streets,  Alleys,  or \nWithin Doorways Prohibited \nA. No person may sleep on public sidewalks, \nstreets, or alleyways at any time as a matter \nof individual and public safety. \nB. No person may sleep in any pedestrian or \nvehicular  entrance  to  public  or  private \nproperty abutting a public sidewalk. \nC. In addition to any other remedy provided \nby law, any person found in violation of this \nsection may be immediately removed from \nthe premises. \nGPMC 5.61.020.  A violation of this ordinance resulted in a \npresumptive $75 fine.  If unpaid, that fine escalated to $160.  \nIf a violator pled guilty, the fines could be reduced by a state \n \nconsequences”) (modification in original and citation omitted).  But \nMartin is controlling law in the Ninth Circuit, to which we are required \nto adhere. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 10 of 86\n10  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \ncircuit court judge to $35 for a first offense and $50 for a \nsecond offense.  GPMC 1.36.010(K). \nNext,  the  general  anti-camping  ordinance  prohibited \npersons from occupying a “campsite” on all public property, \nsuch as parks, benches, or rights of way.  GPMC 5.61.030.  \nThe term “campsite” was defined as \nany place where bedding, sleeping bag, or \nother material used for bedding purposes, or \nany stove or fire is placed, established, or \nmaintained for the purpose of maintaining a \ntemporary place to live, whether or not such \nplace incorporates the use of any tent, lean-\nto,  shack,  or  any  other  structure,  or  any \nvehicle or part thereof. \nGPMC  5.61.010.    A  second  overlapping  anti-camping \nordinance  prohibited  camping  in  public  parks,  including \n“[o]vernight parking” of any vehicle.  GPMC 6.46.090.  A \nhomeless individual would violate this parking prohibition if \nshe parked or left “a vehicle parked for two consecutive \nhours [in a City park] . . . between the hours of midnight and \n6:00 a.m.”  Id.  Violations of either anti-camping ordinance \nresulted in a fine of $295.  If unpaid, the fine escalated to \n$537.60.  However, if a violator pled guilty, the fine could \nbe reduced to $180 for a first offense and $225 for a second \noffense.

If  an  individual  received  a  “park \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 11 of 86\n  JOHNSON V.

That year the City \nCouncil convened a Community Roundtable (“Roundtable”) \n“to  identify  solutions  to  current  vagrancy  problems.”  \nParticipants  discussed  the  possibility  of  “driving  repeat \noffenders out of town and leaving them there.”  The City’s \nPublic  Safety  Director  noted  police  officers  had  bought \nhomeless persons bus tickets out of town, only to have the \nperson returned to the City from the location where they \nwere sent.  A city councilor made clear the City’s goal \nshould be “to make it uncomfortable enough for [homeless \npersons] in our city so they will want to move on down the \nroad.”  The planned actions resulting from the Roundtable \nincluded  increased  enforcement  of  City  ordinances, \nincluding the anti-camping ordinances. \nThe year following the Roundtable saw a significant \nincrease in enforcement of the City’s anti-sleeping and anti-\ncamping ordinances.  From 2013 through 2018, the City \nissued a steady stream of tickets under the ordinances.4  On \nSeptember 4, 2018, a three-judge panel issued its opinion in \n \n4 The City issued the following number of tickets under the anti-\nsleeping and anti-camping ordinances: \n2013: 74 total tickets \n2014: 228 total tickets \n2015: 80 total tickets \n2016: 47 total tickets \n2017: 99 total tickets \n2018: 46 total tickets \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 12 of 86\n12  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nMartin v. City of Boise, 902 F.3d 1031 (9th Cir. 2018).5  That \ncase served as the backdrop for this entire litigation. \nIn Martin, six homeless or recently homeless individuals \nsued the city of Boise, Idaho, seeking relief from criminal \nprosecution  under  two  city  ordinances  related  to  public \ncamping.  Martin, 920 F.3d at 603–04.  As relevant here, \nMartin held the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the \n“Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of criminal \npenalties for sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public \nproperty  for  homeless  individuals  who  cannot  obtain \nshelter.”  Id. at 616.  Martin made clear, however, that a city \nis  not  required  to  “provide  sufficient  shelter  for  the \nhomeless, or allow anyone who wishes to sit, lie, or sleep on \nthe streets . . . at any time and at any place.”  Id. at 617 \n(quoting Jones v. City of Los Angeles, 444 F.3d 1118, 1138 \n(9th Cir. 2006), vacated, 505 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir. 2007)) \n(omission in original). \n \n5 Following the opinion, the City of Boise petitioned for rehearing \nen banc.  On April 1, 2019, an amended panel opinion was issued and \nthe petition for rehearing was denied.  Judge M. Smith, joined by five \nother judges, dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc.  He argued \nthe  three-judge  panel  had,  among  other  errors,  misinterpreted  the \nSupreme Court precedents regarding the criminalization of involuntary \nconduct.  Martin, 920 F.3d at 591–92 (M. Smith, J., dissenting from \ndenial of rehearing en banc).  Judge Bennett, joined by four judges, also \ndissented from the denial of rehearing en banc.  Judge Bennett argued \nthe three-judge panel’s opinion was inconsistent with the original public \nmeaning of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause.  Id. at 599 \n(Bennett, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  The merits of \nthose dissents do not alter the binding nature of the amended Martin \npanel opinion.

CITY OF GRANTS PASS  13 \n \nThe formula established in Martin is that the government \ncannot prosecute homeless people for sleeping in public if \nthere “is a greater number of homeless individuals in [a \njurisdiction] than the number of available” shelter spaces.  \nId. (alteration in original).  When assessing the number of \nshelter  spaces,  Martin  held  shelters  with  a  “mandatory \nreligious focus” could not be counted as available due to \npotential violations of the First Amendment’s Establishment \nClause.  Id. at 609–10 (citing Inouye v. Kemna, 504 F.3d \n705, 712–13 (9th Cir. 2007)). \nIn  October  2018,  approximately  six  weeks  after  the \nMartin opinion, Debra Blake filed her putative class action \ncomplaint  against  the  City.    The  complaint  alleged \nenforcement of the City’s anti-sleeping and anti-camping \nordinances  violated  the  Cruel  and  Unusual  Punishment \nClause  of  the  Eighth  Amendment,  the  Equal  Protection \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The complaint was \namended to include additional named plaintiffs and to allege \na claim that the fines imposed under the ordinances violated \nthe Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment.  On \nJanuary 2, 2019, a few months after the initial complaint was \nfiled,  and  before  Plaintiffs  filed  their  class  certification \nmotion, the City amended its anti-camping ordinance in an \nattempt to come into compliance with Martin.  Prior to this \nchange, the anti-camping ordinance was worded such that \n“‘sleeping’  in  parks  . . .  automatically  constitut[ed] \n‘camping.’”  According to the City, “in direct response to \nMartin  v.  Boise,  the  City  amended  [the  anti-camping \nordinance] to make it clear that the act of ‘sleeping’ was to \nbe distinguished from the prohibited conduct of ‘camping.’”  \nThe City meant to “make it clear that those without shelter \ncould engage in the involuntary acts of sleeping or resting in \nthe City’s parks.”  Shortly after the City removed “sleeping” \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 14 of 86\n14  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nfrom the “camping” definition, Plaintiffs moved to certify a \nclass.  Plaintiffs requested certification of a class defined as \nAll involuntarily homeless individuals living \nin Grants Pass, Oregon, including homeless \nindividuals who sometimes sleep outside city \nlimits to avoid harassment and punishment \nby [the City] as addressed in this lawsuit. \nPlaintiffs’ class certification motion was accompanied by a \ndeclaration from the Chief Operating Officer and Director of \nHousing  and  Homeless  Services  for  United  Community \nAction Network (“UCAN”), a non-profit organization that \nserves homeless people in Josephine County, the county \nwhere the City is located.6  UCAN had recently conducted a \n“point-in-time count of homeless individuals in Josephine \nCounty.”7    Based  on  that  count,  the  Chief  Operating \nOfficer’s  declaration  stated  “[h]undreds  of  [homeless] \n \n6 The Department of Housing and Urban Development regulations \nimpose obligations on the “continuum of care,” which is defined as “the \ngroup composed of representatives of relevant organizations . . . that are \norganized to plan for and provide, as necessary, a system of outreach, \nengagement,  and  assessment  . . .  to  address  the  various  needs  of \nhomeless persons and persons at risk of homelessness for a specific \ngeographic area.” 24 C.F.R. § 576.2. \n7 As the “continuum of care” in the City, UCAN was required to \nconduct point-in-time counts (“PIT counts”) of homeless persons within \nthat geographic area.  24 C.F.R. § 578.7(c)(2).  PIT counts measure the \nnumber of sheltered and unsheltered homeless individuals on a single \nnight.  24 C.F.R. § 578.7(c)(2).  The Martin court relied on PIT counts \nconducted by local non-profits to determine the number of homeless \npeople in the jurisdiction.  See Martin, 920 F.3d at 604.  Courts and \nexperts note that PIT counts routinely undercount homeless persons, but \nthey appear to be the best available source of data on homelessness.  See, \ne.g., id. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 15 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  15 \n \npeople live in Grants Pass,” and “almost all of the homeless \npeople in Grants Pass are involuntarily homeless.  There is \nsimply no place in Grants Pass for them to find affordable \nhousing or shelter.  They are not choosing to live on the street \nor in the woods.” \nThe City opposed class certification, arguing Plaintiffs \nhad not provided sufficient evidence to meet any of the \nrequirements  for  certifying  a  class.    The  district  court \ndisagreed and certified the class proposed by Plaintiffs.  The \nparties proceeded with discovery and filed cross-motions for \nsummary judgment. \nAt the time the parties filed their summary judgment \nmotions, there were only four locations in the City that \ntemporarily  housed  homeless  persons,  which  proved \ninadequate.  One location was run by the Gospel Rescue \nMission,  an  explicitly  religious  organization  devoted  to \nhelping the poor.  The Gospel Rescue Mission operated a \nfacility for single men without children, and another facility \nfor women, including women with children.  These two \nfacilities required residents to work at the mission six hours \na day, six days a week in exchange for a bunk for 30 days.  \nResidents were  required to attend an approved place of \nworship  each  Sunday  and  that  place  of  worship  had  to \nespouse “traditional Christian teachings such as the Apostles \nCreed.”  Disabled persons with chronic medical or mental \nhealth issues that prevented them from complying with the \nMission’s rules were prohibited.8 \n \n8 Multiple class members submitted uncontested declarations to the \ndistrict court stating they did not stay at the Gospel Rescue Mission \nbecause they suffer from disqualifying disabilities and/or were unwilling \nto attend church. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 16 of 86\n16  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nIn addition to the Gospel Rescue Mission, the City itself \noperated a “sobering center” where law enforcement could \ntransport  intoxicated  or  impaired  persons.    That  facility \nconsisted  of  twelve  locked  rooms  with  toilets  where \nintoxicated individuals could sober up.  The rooms did not \nhave beds.  The City also provided financial support to the \nHearts with a Mission Youth Shelter, an 18-bed facility \nwhere unaccompanied minors aged 10 to 17 could stay for \nup to 72 hours, and could stay even longer if they had \nparental consent. \nFinally, on nights when the temperature was below 30 \ndegrees (or below 32 degrees with snow), UCAN operated a \n“warming center” capable of holding up to 40 individuals.  \nThat  center  did  not  provide  beds.    The  center  reached \ncapacity on every night it operated except the first night it \nopened, February 3, 2020.  Between February 3 and March \n19, 2020, the warming center was open for 16 nights.  The \ncenter did not open at all during the winter of 2020–2021. \nPresented  with  evidence  of  the  number  of  homeless \npersons and the shelter spaces available, the district court \nconcluded “[t]he record is undisputed that Grants Pass has \nfar  more  homeless  individuals  than  it  has  practically \navailable shelter beds.”  The court then held that, based on \nthe unavailability of shelter beds, the City’s enforcement of \nits anti-camping and anti-sleeping ordinances violated the \nCruel and Unusual Punishment Clause.  The fact that Martin \ninvolved criminal violations while the present case involved \ninitial civil violations that matured into criminal violations \nmade “no difference for Eight Amendment purposes.”  Next, \nthe  court  held  the  system  of  fines  violated  the  Eighth \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 17 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  17 \n \nAmendment’s Excessive Fines Clause.9  Finally, the court \nheld  the  appeals  process  for  park  exclusions  violated \nprocedural due process under the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment. \nIn reaching its decision the district court was careful to \npoint  out  that,  consistent  with  Martin,  the  scope  of  its \ndecision was limited.  The court’s order made clear that the \nCity  was  not  required  to  provide  shelter  for  homeless \npersons and the City could still limit camping or sleeping at \ncertain times and in certain places.  The district court also \nnoted the City may still “ban the use of tents in public parks,” \n“limi[t] the amount of bedding type materials allowed per \nindividual,”  and  pursue  other  options  “to  prevent  the \nerection of encampments that cause public health and safety \nconcerns.”10 \nApproximately one month after the summary judgment \norder, the district court issued a judgment which included a \n \n9 Part of the City’s argument on this issue was that the fines are not \nmandatory because state court judges retain discretion not to impose \nfines.  This is inconsistent with the text of the ordinances and not \nsupported by the record.  The provision of the municipal code defining \npenalties for ordinance violations clarifies that the fines are mandatory.  \nIt provides, the fines “shall be $295” and “shall be $75.”  GPMC \n1.36.010(J)–(K) (emphasis added).  Conversely, it is only discretionary \nto reduce fines because the relevant ordinance provides that, “[u]pon a \nplea of guilty . . . the penalty may be reduced” to the amount listed for a \nfirst or second offense.  Id. (emphasis added).  After a second citation, \nthere is no authority within the municipal code that permits judges to \nreduce fines, and there is no evidence in the record demonstrating circuit \ncourt judges have reduced fines except pursuant to GPMC 1.36.010. \n10 The district court denied summary judgment on other claims \nbrought by Plaintiffs.  Those claims were subsequently voluntarily \ndismissed. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 18 of 86\n18  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \npermanent injunction that provided a complicated mix of \nrelief.    First,  the  district  court  declared  the  ordinance \nregarding the appeals of park exclusions failed to provide \n“adequate procedural due process,” but that ordinance was \nnot  permanently  enjoined.    Instead,  the  district  court \nenjoined  only  the  enforcement  of  the  underlying  park \nexclusion  ordinance.    Next,  the  district  court  declared \nenforcement  of  the  anti-sleeping  and  anti-camping \nordinances  against  class  members  “violates  the  Eighth \nAmendment  prohibition  against  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment”  and  “violates  the  Eighth  Amendment \nprohibition against excessive fines.”  Without explanation, \nhowever, the district court did not enjoin those ordinances in \ntheir entirety.  Rather, the district court entered no injunctive \nrelief regarding the anti-sleeping ordinance.  But the district \ncourt permanently enjoined enforcement of the anti-camping \nordinances,  as  well  as  an  ordinance  regarding  “criminal \ntrespassing on city property related to parks,” in all City \nparks at night except for one park where the parties agreed \nthe injunction need not apply.11  The district court also \npermanently  enjoined  enforcement  of  the  anti-camping \nordinances during daytime hours unless an initial warning \nwas  given  “at  least  24  hours  before  enforcement.”  \nAccordingly,  under  the  permanent  injunction,  the  anti-\ncamping  ordinances  may  be  enforced  under  some \ncircumstances during the day, but never at night. \nThe City appealed and sought initial en banc review to \nclarify the scope of Martin.  The petition for initial hearing \nen banc was denied. \n \n11 The City ordinance regarding “criminal trespass” was never at \nissue in the litigation until the permanent injunction.  Plaintiffs explain \nit was included in the injunction “[b]y agreement of the parties.” \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 19 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  19 \n \nII. \nThe  core  issue  involving  enforcement  of  the  anti-\ncamping ordinances is governed in large part by Martin.  \nWhile there are some differences between Martin and the \npresent case, the City has not identified a persuasive way to \ndifferentiate  its  anti-camping  ordinances  from  the \nquestioned ordinances in Martin.  Therefore, the district \ncourt’s ruling that the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause \nbars enforcement of the anti-camping ordinances will be \nmostly  affirmed.    We  need  not  address  the  potential \nexcessiveness  of  the  fines  issue  or  whether  Plaintiffs \nadequately pled their due process challenge. \nOur analysis proceeds in five parts.  First, we reject the \nCity’s argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction.12  \nSecond, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court’s \ncertification of a class of involuntarily homeless persons.  \nThird, we agree with the district court that at least portions \nof the anti-camping ordinance violate the Cruel and Unusual \nPunishment clause under Martin.  Fourth, we conclude there \nis no need to resolve whether the fines violate the Excessive \nFines clause.  Fifth, we hold it is unnecessary to decide \nPlaintiffs’ procedural due process claim. \nA. \nStanding and mootness are questions of law that we \nreview de novo.  Hartman v. Summers, 120 F.3d 157, 159 \n(9th Cir. 1997); Foster v. Carson, 347 F.3d 742, 745 (9th \nCir. 2003).  “Federal courts must determine that they have \n \n12 However, we vacate summary judgment and remand as to the anti-\nsleeping  ordinance  to  afford  the  district  court  the  opportunity  to \nsubstitute a class representative in place of Debra Blake, who passed \naway while this matter was on appeal. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 20 of 86\n20  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \njurisdiction before proceeding to the merits,” and plaintiffs \nmust demonstrate standing as a necessary component of \njurisdiction.  Lance v. Coffman, 549 U.S. 437, 439 (2007).  \nTo have Article III standing, a plaintiff must show (1) a \nconcrete  and  particularized  injury,  (2)  caused  by  the \nchallenged  conduct,  (3)  that  is  likely  redressable  by  a \nfavorable judicial decision.  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. \nLaidlaw Env’t Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180–81 \n(2000).  For purposes of injunctive relief, “[a]bstract injury \nis not enough”—the plaintiff must have sustained or be in \nimmediate danger “of sustaining some direct injury as the \nresult of the challenged” law.  O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. \n488, 494 (1974) (quotation marks and citation omitted). \nThe  City’s  appellate  briefing  makes  two  standing \narguments.  First, the City argues Plaintiffs’ claims are now \nmoot because Plaintiffs no longer face a risk of injury based \non the City’s changed behavior after Martin.  Second, the \nCity argues Plaintiffs have not identified any relief that is \nwithin a federal court’s power to redress.  Both arguments \nare without merit. \nA claim becomes moot, and no longer justiciable in \nfederal court, if it has been remedied independent of the \ncourt.  See Genesis Healthcare Corp. v. Symczyk, 569 U.S. \n66, 72 (2013).  There is abundant evidence in the record \nestablishing homeless persons were injured by the City’s \nenforcement actions in the past.  The City argues, however, \nthat it made changes after Martin such that there is no longer \na threat of future injury.  The problem for the City is that \nvoluntary cessation of challenged practices rarely suffices to \nmoot  a  case  and,  in  any  event,  there  is  evidence  the \nchallenged practices have continued after Martin. \n“It is well settled that ‘a defendant’s voluntary cessation \nof a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 21 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  21 \n \nits power to determine the legality of the practice.’”  Friends \nof the Earth, 528 U.S. at 189 (quoting City of Mesquite v. \nAladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 289 (1982)).  This is so \n“because  a  dismissal  for  mootness  would  permit  a \nresumption of the challenged conduct as soon as the case is \ndismissed.”  Knox v. Serv. Emps. Int’l Union, Local 1000, \n567  U.S.  298,  307  (2012).    Thus,  the  City  “bears  the \nformidable burden of showing that it is absolutely clear the \nallegedly  wrongful  behavior  could  not  reasonably  be \nexpected to recur.”  Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 190.  \nInstead  of  the  City  making  it  “absolutely  clear”  it  has \nstopped enforcement activities, the record shows ongoing \nenforcement. \nThe parties diverge substantially on how to characterize \nthe  degree  of  enforcement  after  Martin  was  issued  in \nSeptember 2018.  The City argued in its briefing and at oral \nargument that it has largely complied with Martin, noting the \n2019  amendment  to  an  anti-camping  ordinance,  that \ncitations were issued “sparingly” in 2019, and in particular \nit says it issued only two citations during the late evening \nand early morning  since Martin.  The City supports its \npetition with a declaration from a City police officer stating \n“[i]t is the regular practice of every officer I know of on this \ndepartment to enforce these Ordinances sparingly and in \nrecognition of the different circumstances we encounter.”  \nAs  for  Plaintiffs,  they  offered  evidence  showing \nenforcement continued after Martin such that class members \nreceived  citations  and  exclusion  orders  for  camping  or \nsleeping and were prosecuted for criminal trespass between \nthe point the lawsuit was filed and the close of discovery. \nAlthough the record does show the rate of enforcement \nof  the  various  ordinances  decreased  since  Martin,  even \naccepting the City’s position the evidence is undisputed that \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 22 of 86\n22  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nenforcement continued.13  It is plainly inaccurate for the City \nto claim all enforcement ceased.  The ongoing enforcement \nactivities establish the City did not meet its “formidable \nburden” of showing the challenged activities will not recur.  \nFriends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 190.  The City’s mootness \nargument fails.14 \nThe  City’s  other  jurisdictional  argument  is  that \nPlaintiffs’ claims are not redressable.  According to the City, \n \n13 The City also argues “there was no evidence that anyone was ever \ncited for the simple act of sleeping in a City park” after Martin.  But the \ncitation issued to Dolores Nevin in late December 2019 pursuant to the \nCity’s “criminal trespass” ordinance included a narrative explaining, \n“[d]uring an area check of Riverside Park, Dolores Nevin was found \nsleeping during closed hours.  Nevin, who has been warned in the past, \nwas issued a citation for Trespass on City Property.”  (emphasis added).  \nAnd on September 11, 2019, Grants Pass Police Officer Jason McGinnis \nissued citations to Debra Blake and Carla Thomas for being in Riverside \nPark at approximately 7:30 a.m. with sleeping bags and belongings \nspread around themselves.  Other individuals cited for camping in a city \npark in 2019 include class members: Gail Laine, William Stroh, Dawn \nSchmidt, Cristina Trejo, Kellie Parker, Colleen Bannon, Amanda Sirnio, \nand Michael and Louana Ellis. \n14 Mootness was also considered during the Martin litigation.  See \nBell v. City of Boise, 709 F.3d 890, 898, 900–01 (9th Cir. 2013).  The \nCity of Boise argued that a combination of an amended definition of \n“camping” in the ordinance and a “Special Order,” prohibiting police \nofficers from enforcing the ordinances when a person is on public \nproperty and there is no available overnight shelter, mooted the case.  Id. \nat 894–95.  We rejected the argument that the change to the definition of \n“camping” rendered the case moot because “[m]ere clarification of the \nCamping  Ordinance  does  not  address  the  central  concerns  of  the \nPlaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claims”—that the ordinance “effectively \ncriminalized their status as homeless individuals.”  Id. at 898 n.12.  And \nwe held the adoption of a “Special Order” did not moot the case because \nthe Special Order was not a legislative enactment, and as such it “could \nbe easily abandoned or altered in the future.”  Id. at 901. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 23 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  23 \n \nany possible relief intrudes inappropriately upon matters of \npolicy best left to executive and legislative discretion.  We \ndisagree.  Consistent with Martin, the district court granted \nlimited relief enjoining enforcement of  a few  municipal \nordinances at certain times, in certain places, against certain \npersons.  None of the cases cited by the City credibly support \nits argument that the district court injunction overstepped the \njudiciary’s  limited  authority  under  the  Constitution.  \nContrary to the City’s position, enjoining enforcement of a \nfew municipal ordinances aimed at involuntarily homeless \npersons  cannot  credibly  be  compared  to  an  injunction \nseeking to require the federal government to “phase out \nfossil fuel emissions and draw down excess atmospheric \nCO2.”  Juliana v. United States, 947 F.3d 1159, 1164–65 \n(9th  Cir.  2020).    The  relief  sought  by  Plaintiffs  was \nredressable within the limits of Article III.  See Renee v. \nDuncan, 686 F.3d 1002, 1013 (9th Cir. 2012) (holding a \nplaintiff’s burden to demonstrate redressability is “relatively \nmodest”) (citation omitted). \nFinally, we raise sua sponte the possibility that the death \nof class representative Debra Blake while this matter was on \nthe appeal has jurisdictional significance.  Cf. Fort Bend Cty. \nv. Davis, 139 S.Ct. 1843, 1849 (2019) (holding courts must \nraise issues of subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte).  We \nhold Blake’s death does not moot the class’s claims as to all \nchallenged  ordinances  except  possibly  the  anti-sleeping \nordinance.  As to that ordinance, we remand to allow the \ndistrict  court  the  opportunity  to  substitute  a  class \nrepresentative in Blake’s stead. \nWith respect to the park exclusion, criminal trespass, and \nanti-camping ordinances, the surviving class representatives, \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 24 of 86\n24  JOHNSON V.

It is true \nJohnson has not received a park exclusion order and has not been charged \nwith criminal trespass in the second degree. However, there is little doubt \nthat her continued camping in parks would lead to a park exclusion order \nand, eventually, criminal trespass charges.  Johnson is positioned to bring \na pre-enforcement challenge against the park exclusion and criminal \ntrespass ordinances, because they will be used against her given the \nundisputed fact that she remains involuntarily homeless in Grants Pass.  \nShe established a credible threat of future enforcement under the anti-\ncamping  ordinances  which  creates  a  credible  threat  of  future \nenforcement under the park exclusion and criminal trespass ordinances. \n16 The dissent claims John Logan has not established standing.  \nDissent 63–65.  During the course of this case, Logan submitted two \ndeclarations.  At the class certification stage, his declaration stated he \n“lived out of [his] truck on the streets in Grants Pass for about 4 years.”  \nDuring that time, he was “awakened by City of Grants Pass police officer \nand told that I cannot sleep in my truck anywhere in the city and ordered \nto move on.”  To avoid those encounters, Logan “usually sleep[s] in [his] \ntruck just outside the Grants Pass city limits.”  However, Logan stated \n“[i]f there was some place in the city where [he] could legally sleep in \n[his] truck, [he] would because it would save valuable gas money and \navoid . . . having to constantly move.”  Logan also explained he has “met \ndozens, if not hundreds, of homeless people in Grants Pass” over the \nyears who had been ticketed, fined, arrested, and criminally prosecuted \n“for  living  outside.”  At  summary  judgment,  Logan  submitted  a \ndeclaration stating he is “currently involuntarily homeless in Grants Pass \nand sleeping in [his] truck at night at a rest stop North of Grants Pass.”  \nHe stated he “cannot sleep in the City of Grants Pass for fear that [he] \nwill be awakened, ticketed, fined, moved along, trespassed and charged \nwith Criminal Trespass.”  The dissent reads this evidence as indicating \nLogan failed to “provide[] any facts to establish” that he is likely to be \nissued a citation under the challenged ordinances.  Dissent 64.  We do \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 25 of 86\n  JOHNSON V.

Debra Blake is the only class representative who \nhad standing in her own right to challenge the anti-sleeping \nordinance.  Under cases such as Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, \n401 (1975), and Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., Inc., \n424 U.S. 747 (1976), a class representative may pursue the \nlive claims of a properly certified class—without the need to \nremand  for substitution of a new representative17—even \n \nnot  agree.    The  undisputed  facts  establish  Logan  is  involuntarily \nhomeless. When he slept in Grants Pass, he was awoken by police \nofficers  and  ordered  to  move.  His  personal  knowledge  was  that \ninvoluntarily homeless individuals in Grants Pass often are cited under \nthe challenged ordinances and Grants Pass continues to enforce the \nchallenged ordinances. And, but for the challenged ordinances, Logan \nwould sleep in the city.  Therefore, as the district court found, it is \nsufficiently  likely  Logan  would  be  issued  a  citation  that  Logan’s \nstanding is established.  That is especially true given the Supreme Court's \ninstruction that a plaintiff need not wait for “an actual arrest, prosecution, \nor other enforcement action” before “challenging [a] law.” Susan B. \nAnthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014). Finally, even if \nLogan had not demonstrated standing, the dissent’s analysis regarding \nLogan is irrelevant because this case could proceed solely based on the \nstanding established by Gloria Johnson and the class.  See Bates v. United \nParcel Serv., Inc., 511 F.3d at 985 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc). \n17 See Sosna, 419 U.S. at 403 (“[W]e believe that the test of Rule \n23(a) is met.”); id. at 416–17 (White, J., dissenting) (“It is claimed that \nthe certified class supplies the necessary adverse parties for a continuing \ncase or controversy . . .

If \nDebra  Blake’s  challenge  to  the  anti-sleeping  ordinance \nbecame  moot  before  she  passed  away,  she  could  have \ncontinued to pursue the challenge on behalf of the class \nunder the doctrine of Sosna.  But we have not found any case \napplying Sosna and Franks to a situation such as this, in \nwhich the death of a representative causes a class to be \nunrepresented as to part (but not all) of a claim.  The parties \ndid not brief this issue and no precedent indicates whether \nthis raises a jurisdictional question, which would deprive us \nof  authority  to  review  the  merits  of  the  anti-sleeping \nordinance challenge, or a matter of Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23, which might not. \nBecause Plaintiffs have not moved to substitute a class \nrepresentative  pursuant  to  Federal  Rule  of  Appellate \nProcedure 43(a) or identified a representative who could be \nsubstituted, because no party has addressed this question in \nbriefing, and because we are not certain of our jurisdiction \nto consider the challenge to the anti-sleeping ordinance, we \nthink it appropriate to vacate summary judgment as to the \n \nrepresentative member of the class.  At the very least, the case should be \nremanded to the District Court.”). \n18 The class must be properly certified, see Franks, 424 U.S. at 755–\n56, or the representative must be appealing denial of class certification.  \nSee United States Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 404 \n(1980).  The class representative must be a member of the class with \nstanding to sue at the time certification is granted or denied.  See Sosna, \n419 U.S. at 403.  The unnamed class members must still have a live \ninterest in the matter throughout the duration of the litigation.  See \nFranks, 424 U.S. at 755.  And the court must be satisfied that the named \nrepresentative will adequately pursue the interests of the class even \nthough their own interest has expired.  See Sosna, 419 U.S. at 403. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 27 of 86\n  JOHNSON V.

Remand will not \ncause  significant  delay  because,  as  we  explain  below, \nremand is otherwise required so that the injunction can be \nmodified.  In the absence of briefing or precedent regarding \nthis question, we do not decide whether this limitation is \njurisdictional or whether it arises from operation of Rule 23. \nWe therefore hold the surviving class representatives at \na  minimum  have  standing  to  challenge  every  ordinance \nexcept the anti-sleeping ordinance.  As to the anti-sleeping \nordinance, we vacate summary judgment and remand for the \ndistrict court to consider in the first instance whether an \nadequate class representative, such as class member Dolores \nNevin, exists who may be substituted. \nB. \nThe City’s next argument is the district court erred in \ncertifying the class.  We “review a district court’s order \ngranting class certification for abuse of discretion, but give \nthe district court ‘noticeably more deference when reviewing \na grant of class certification than when reviewing a denial.’”  \nPatel v.

Assessing these requirements involves “rigorous \nanalysis” of the evidence.  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, \n564 U.S. 338, 351 (2011) (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of the Sw. \nv. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982)). \nIf  the  initial  requirements  of  Rule  23(a)  are  met,  a \nputative class representative must also show the class falls \ninto one of three categories under Rule 23(b).  Plaintiffs \nbrought this suit under Rule 23(b)(2), seeking injunctive or \ndeclaratory relief based on the City having “acted or refused \nto act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that \nfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is \nappropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(b)(2). \nThe district court found the Rule 23(a) requirements \nsatisfied and certified a class under Rule 23(b)(2).  The \nCity’s arguments against this class certification are obscure.  \nIt appears the City’s argument is that class certification was \nan abuse of discretion because the holding of Martin can \nonly  be  applied  after  an  individualized  inquiry  of  each \nalleged involuntarily homeless person’s access to shelter.19  \nThe City appears to suggest the need for individualized \ninquiry  defeats  numerosity,  commonality,  and typicality.  \nWhile we acknowledge the Martin litigation was not a class \naction, nothing in that decision precluded class actions.20  \n \n19 There is no reason to believe the putative class members are \nvoluntarily homeless.  To the contrary, at least 13 class members \nsubmitted declarations to the district court indicating that they are \ninvoluntarily homeless. \n20 Other courts have certified similar classes.  See e.g., Lehr v. City \nof Sacramento, 259 F.R.D. 479 (E.D. Cal. 2009) (addressing numerosity, \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 29 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  29 \n \nAnd based on the record in this case, the district court did \nnot err by finding Plaintiffs satisfied the requirements of \nRule 23 such that a class could be certified. \nTo satisfy the numerosity requirement a proposed class \nmust  be  “so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is \nimpracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  For purposes of \nthis  requirement,  “‘impracticability’  does  not  mean \n‘impossibility,’ but only the difficulty or inconvenience of \njoining all members of the class.”  Harris v. Palm Springs \nAlpine Ests., Inc., 329 F.2d 909, 913–14 (9th Cir. 1964) \n(quotation omitted).  There is no specific number of class \nmembers required.  See Gen. Tel. Co. of the Nw., Inc. v. \nEEOC,  446  U.S.  318,  330  (1980).    However,  proposed \nclasses of less than fifteen are too small while classes of \nmore  than  sixty  are  sufficiently  large.    Harik  v.  Cal. \nTeachers Ass’n, 326 F.3d 1042, 1051–52 (9th Cir. 2003). \nWhen the district court certified the class on August 7, \n2019, it found there were at least 600 homeless persons in \nthe City based on the 2018 and 2019 PIT counts conducted \nby UCAN.  The City does not identify how this finding was \nclearly erroneous.  In fact, the City affirmatively indicated to \nPlaintiffs prior to the class certification order that the number \nof homeless persons residing in Grants Pass for the past \n7 years was “unknown.”  Further, the only guidance offered \nby the City regarding a specific number of class members \ncame long after the class was certified.  A City police officer \nclaimed in a declaration that he was “aware of less than fifty \n \ncommonality, and typicality for homeless persons in Sacramento); Joyce \nv.

The  officer  admitted,  however,  it  “would  be \nextremely difficult to accurately estimate the population of \npeople who are homeless in Grants Pass regardless of the \ndefinition used.” \nThe officer’s guess of “less than fifty” homeless persons \nis  inconsistent  with  the  general  understanding  that  PIT \ncounts routinely undercount homeless persons.  See Martin, \n920 F.3d at 604 (“It is widely recognized that a one-night \npoint  in  time  count  will  undercount  the  homeless \npopulation.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But even \naccepting  the  officer’s  assessment  that  there  were \napproximately  fifty  homeless  persons  in  the  City,  the \nnumerosity requirement is satisfied.  Joining approximately \nfifty persons might be impracticable and especially so under \nthe facts here because homeless persons obviously lack a \nfixed  address  and  likely  have  no  reliable  means  of \ncommunications.21  At the very least, the district court did \n \n21  Moreover,  there  is  a  well-documented  correlation  between \nphysical and mental illness and homelessness.

Pursuant to the class definition, the class includes \nonly  involuntarily  homeless  persons.23    Individuals  who \n \n22 The dissent adapts the City’s argument that enforcement of the \nanti-camping ordinances depends on individual circumstances and is \ntherefore not capable of resolution on a common basis.  Dissent 72.  That \nmisunderstands how the present class was structured.  The dissent \nattempts to reframe the common question as a very general inquiry.  It \nappears  the  dissent  interprets  the  question  whether  an  Eighth \nAmendment violation must be determined by an individualized inquiry \nas whether each individual is “involuntarily homeless.”  To assess that, \na court would have to conduct an individualized inquiry and determine \nif an individual was “involuntarily homeless.”  But that is not the \ncommon question in this case.  Rather, the question is whether the City's \nenforcement of the anti-camping ordinances against all involuntarily \nhomeless individuals violates the Eighth Amendment.  This question is \ncapable of common resolution on a prospective class-wide basis, as the \nrecord establishes. \n23 The dissent argues this created a prohibited “fail safe” class.  That \nis erroneous.  As noted in a recent en banc decision, “a ‘fail safe’ class \n. . . is defined to include only those individuals who were injured by the \nallegedly unlawful conduct.”  Olean Wholesale Grocery Coop., Inc. v. \nBumble Bee Foods LLC, 31 F.4th 651, 669 n.14 (9th Cir. 2022) (en \nbanc).  Such classes are prohibited “because a class member either wins \nor, by virtue of losing, is defined out of the class and is therefore not \nbound by the judgment.”  Id.  See also Ruiz Torres v. Mercer Canyons \nInc., 835 F.3d 1125, 1138 (9th Cir. 2016) (noting a fail safe class “is one \nthat is defined so narrowly as to preclude[ ] membership unless the \nliability of the defendant is established”).  No such class is present here.  \nThe class was defined, in relevant part, as “[a]ll involuntarily homeless \nindividuals living in Grants Pass.”  Membership in that class has no \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 33 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  33 \n \nhave shelter or the means to acquire their own shelter simply \nare never class members.24  Because we find there existed at \nleast one question of law or fact common to the class, the \ndistrict  court  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  in  concluding \ncommonality was satisfied. \nTypicality asks whether “the claims or defenses of the \nrepresentative parties are typical” of the class.  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(a)(3).  Typicality is a “permissive standard[].”  Staton \nv. Boeing Co., 327 F.3d 938, 957 (9th Cir. 2003) (citation \nomitted).  It “refers to the nature of the claim or defense of \nthe class representative, and not to the specific facts from \n \nconnection to the success of the underlying claims.  Put differently, the \nclass would have consisted of exactly the same population whether \nGrants Pass won or lost on the merits.  The obvious illustration of this is \nthe class population would not change if a court determined the anti-\ncamping ordinance violated the Eighth Amendment while the anti-\nsleeping ordinance did not. In that situation, class members would not be \n“defined out of the class.” Olean, 31 F.4th at 669 n.14 (citation omitted).  \nRather, class members would be “bound by the judgment” regarding the \nanti-sleeping  ordinance.  Id.  In  any  event,  the  dissent’s  concerns \nregarding individualized determinations are best made when the City \nattempts to enforce its ordinances.  Cf. McArdle v. City of Ocala, \n519 F.Supp.3d 1045, 1052 (M.D. Fla. 2021) (requiring that officers \ninquire into the availability of shelter space before an arrest could be \nmade for violation of the City’s “open lodging” ordinance).  If it is \ndetermined at the enforcement stage that a homeless individual has \naccess to shelter, then they do not benefit from the injunction and may \nbe cited or prosecuted under the anti-camping ordinances.  Moreover, as \nwe noted above, several classes of homeless individuals have been \ncertified in this past. See supra note 18. \n24 We do not, as the dissent contends, “suggest[ ] that the class \ndefinition requires only an involuntary lack of access to regular or \npermanent shelter to qualify as ‘involuntarily homeless.’”  Dissent 77–\n78.  It is unclear where the dissent finds this in the opinion.  To be clear: \nA person with access to temporary shelter is not involuntarily homeless \nunless and until they no longer have access to shelter. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 34 of 86\n34  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nwhich it arose or the relief sought.”  Parsons, 754 F.3d at \n685 (citation omitted). \nThe  class  representatives’  claims  and  defenses  are \ntypical of the class in that they are homeless persons who \nclaim that the City cannot enforce the challenged ordinances \nagainst them when they have no shelter.  The defenses that \napply  to  class  representatives  and  class  members  are \nidentical.  The claims of class representatives and class \nmembers are similar, except that some class representatives \nlive in vehicles while other class members may live on \nstreets  or  in  parks,  not  vehicles.    This  does  not  defeat \ntypicality.    The  class  representatives  with  vehicles  may \nviolate the challenged ordinances in a different manner than \nsome  class  members—i.e.,  by  sleeping  in  their  vehicle, \nrather than on the ground.  But they challenge the same \nordinances under the same constitutional provisions as other \nclass  members.    Cf.  Staton,  327  F.3d  at  957 \n(“[R]epresentative claims are ‘typical’ if they are reasonably \ncoextensive with those of absent class members; they need \nnot  be  substantially  identical.”)  (citation  omitted).    The \ndistrict  court  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  in  finding  the \ntypicality requirement met. \nThe City does not present any other arguments regarding \nclass certification, such as the propriety of certifying the \nclass as an injunctive class under Rule 23(b)(2).  We do not \nmake arguments for parties and the arguments raised by the \nCity regarding class certification fail. \nC. \nHaving rejected the City’s jurisdictional arguments, as \nwell as its arguments regarding class certification, the merits \ncan be addressed.  The City’s merits arguments regarding the \nCruel and Unusual Punishment Clause take two forms.  First, \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 35 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  35 \n \nthe City argues its system of imposing civil fines cannot be \nchallenged  as  violating  the  Cruel  and  Unusual  Clause \nbecause that clause provides protection only in criminal \nproceedings, after an individual has been convicted.  That is \nincorrect.  Second, the City argues Martin does not protect \nhomeless persons from being cited under the City’s amended \nanti-camping ordinance which prohibits use of any bedding \nor similar protection from the elements.  The City appears to \nhave conceded it cannot cite homeless persons merely for \nsleeping in public but the City maintains it is entitled to cite \nindividuals for the use of rudimentary bedding supplies, such \nas a blanket, pillow, or sleeping bag “for bedding purposes.”  \nSee GPMC 5.61.010(B).  Again, the City is incorrect.  Here, \nwe focus exclusively on the anti-camping ordinances. \nAccording to the City, citing individuals under the anti-\ncamping ordinances cannot violate the Cruel and Unusual \nPunishment Clause because citations under the ordinances \nare  civil  and  civil  citations  are  “categorically  not \n‘punishment’ under the Eight Amendment.”25  The City \nexplains “the simple act of issuing a civil citation with a \ncourt date [has never] been found to be unconstitutional \n‘punishment’ under the Eighth Amendment.”  While not \nentirely clear, the City appears to be arguing the Cruel and \nUnusual Punishment Clause provides no protection from \n \n25 This position is in significant tension with the City’s actions taken \nimmediately after Martin was issued.  As noted earlier, the City amended \nits anti-camping ordinance “in direct response to Martin v. Boise” to \nallow for “the act of ‘sleeping’” in City parks.  If the City believed \nMartin has no impact on civil ordinances, it is unclear why the City \nbelieved a curative “response” to Martin was necessary. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 36 of 86\n36  JOHNSON V.

Usually, claims under the Cruel and \nUnusual Clause involve straightforward criminal charges.  \nFor  example, the situation in Martin involved  homeless \npersons  allegedly  violating  criminal  ordinances  and  the \nopinion identified its analysis as focusing on the “criminal” \nnature of the charges over ten times.  920 F.3d at 617.  Here, \nthe City has adopted a slightly more circuitous approach than \n \n26 The primary support for this contention is Ingraham v. Wright, \n430 U.S. 651 (1977).  In Ingraham, the Supreme Court addressed \nwhether the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause was implicated by \ncorporal punishment in public schools.  The Court stated the Cruel and \nUnusual Punishment Clause limits “the criminal process in three ways: \nFirst, it limits the kinds of punishment that can be imposed on those \nconvicted  of  crimes;  second,  it  proscribes  punishment  grossly \ndisproportionate to the severity of the crime; and third, it imposes \nsubstantive limits on what can be made criminal and punished as such.”  \nId. at 667.  The Court interpreted the challenge to corporal punishment \nas,  in  effect,  asserting  arguments  under  only  the  first  or  second \nlimitation.    That  is,  the  challenge  was  whether  “the  paddling  of \nschoolchildren” was a permissible amount or type of punishment.  Id. \nat 668.  The Ingraham decision involved no analysis or discussion of the \nthird  limitation,  i.e.  the  “substantive  limits  on  what  can  be  made \ncriminal.”  Id. at 667.  Thus, it was in the context of evaluating the \namount or type of punishment that Ingraham stated “Eighth Amendment \nscrutiny  is  appropriate  only  after  the  State  has  complied  with  the \nconstitutional  guarantees  traditionally  associated  with  criminal \nprosecutions.”  Id. at 671 n.40.  When, as here, plaintiffs are raising \nchallenges to the “substantive limits on what can be made criminal,” \nIngraham does not prohibit a challenge before a criminal conviction.  See \nMartin,  920  F.3d  at 614  (“Ingraham  did not hold  that  a  plaintiff \nchallenging the state’s power to criminalize a particular status or conduct \nin the first instance, as the plaintiffs in this case do, must first be \nconvicted.”). \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 37 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  37 \n \nsimply establishing violation of its ordinances as criminal \noffenses.  Instead, the City issues civil citations under the \nordinances.  If an individual violates the ordinances twice, \nshe  can  be  issued  a  park  exclusion  order.    And  if  the \nindividual is found in a park after issuance of the park \nexclusion  order,  she  is  cited  for  criminal  trespass.    See \nO.R.S. 164.245 (criminal trespass in the second degree).  \nMultiple City police officers explained in their depositions \nthis sequence was the standard protocol.  The holding in \nMartin cannot be so easily evaded. \nMartin held the Cruel and Unusual Punishment clause \n“prohibits the imposition of criminal penalties for sitting, \nsleeping, or lying outside on public property for homeless \nindividuals who cannot obtain shelter.”  920 F.3d at 616.  A \nlocal government cannot avoid this ruling by issuing civil \ncitations that, later, become criminal offenses.  A recent \ndecision by the en banc Fourth Circuit illustrates how the \nCruel and Unusual Punishment Clause looks to the eventual \ncriminal penalty, even if there are preliminary civil steps. \nThe  disputes  in  Manning  v.  Caldwell  for  City  of \nRoanoke, 930 F.3d 264 (4th Cir. 2019) (en banc) arose from \na Virginia law which allowed a state court to issue a civil \norder identifying an individual as a “habitual drunkard.”  Id. \nat 268.  Once labeled a “habitual drunkard,” the individual \nwas “subject to incarceration for the mere possession of or \nattempt to possess alcohol, or for being drunk in public.”  Id. \nat 269.  A group of homeless alcoholics filed suit claiming, \namong  other  theories,  the  “habitual  drunkard”  scheme \nviolated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause.  In the \nplaintiffs’ view, the scheme resulted in criminal prosecutions \nbased on their “status,” i.e. alcoholism.  See id. at 281. \nUsing reasoning very similar to that in Martin, the Fourth \nCircuit found the statutory scheme unconstitutional because \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 38 of 86\n38  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nit provided punishment based on the plaintiffs’ status.  Of \nparticular relevance here, the Fourth Circuit reasoned the \nfact that Virginia’s “scheme operate[d] in two steps” did not \nchange the analysis.  Id. 283.  Issuing a civil order first, \nfollowed by a criminal charge, was a “two-pronged statutory \nscheme”  potentially  “less  direct”  than  straightforwardly \ncriminalizing the status of alcohol addiction.  Id.  But the \nscheme remained unconstitutional because it “effectively \ncriminalize[d] an illness.”  Id. The fact that Virginia “civilly \nbrands alcoholics as ‘habitual drunkards’ before prosecuting \nthem for involuntary manifestations of their illness does \nnothing  to  cure  the  unconstitutionality  of  this  statutory \nscheme.”  Id. \nThe same reasoning applies here.  The anti-camping \nordinances prohibit Plaintiffs from engaging in activity they \ncannot  avoid.    The  civil  citations  issued  for  behavior \nPlaintiffs cannot avoid are then followed by a civil park \nexclusion order and, eventually, prosecutions for criminal \ntrespass.  Imposing a few extra steps before criminalizing the \nvery acts Martin explicitly says cannot be criminalized does \nnot cure the anti-camping ordinances’ Eighth Amendment \ninfirmity. \nThe City offers a second way to evade the holding in \nMartin.  According to the City, it revised its anti-camping \nordinances to allow homeless persons to sleep in City parks.  \nHowever, the City’s argument regarding the revised anti-\ncamping ordinance is an illusion.  The amended ordinance \ncontinues to prohibit homeless persons from using “bedding, \nsleeping bag, or other material used for bedding purposes,” \nor using stoves, lighting fires, or erecting structures of any \nkind.  GPMC 5.61.010.  The City claims homeless persons \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 39 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  39 \n \nare  free  to  sleep  in  City  parks,  but  only  without  items \nnecessary to facilitate sleeping outdoors.27 \nThe  discrepancy  between  sleeping  without  bedding \nmaterials,  which  is  permitted  under  the  anti-camping \nordinances,  and  sleeping  with  bedding,  which  is  not,  is \nintended to distinguish the anti-camping ordinances from \nMartin and the two Supreme Court precedents underlying \nMartin, Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660 (1962) and \nPowell v. Texas, 392 U.S. 514 (1968).  Under those cases, a \nperson may not be prosecuted for conduct that is involuntary \nor the product of a “status.”  See Martin, 920 F.3d at 617 \n(citation omitted).  The City accordingly argues that sleeping \nis  involuntary  conduct  for  a  homeless  person,  but  that \nhomeless  persons  can  choose  to  sleep  without  bedding \nmaterials and therefore can be prosecuted for sleeping with \nbedding. \nIn its order granting summary judgment, the district \ncourt  correctly  concluded  the  anti-camping  ordinances \nviolated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause to the \nextent  they  prohibited  homeless  persons  from  “taking \nnecessary minimal measures to keep themselves warm and \ndry while sleeping when there are no alternative forms of \nshelter available.”  The only plausible reading of Martin is \n \n27 The Grants Pass ordinance does not specifically define “bedding” \nbut courts give the words of a statute or ordinance their “ordinary, \ncontemporary, common meaning” absent an indication to the contrary \nfrom the legislature.  See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 420, 431 (2000) \n(citation omitted).  The Oxford English Dictionary defines “bedding” as \n“[a] collective term for the articles which compose a bed.”  OXFORD \nENGLISH DICTIONARY.  And “bed” is defined as “a place for sleeping.”  \nMERRIAM-WEBSTER COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 108 (11th ed.).  The \nCity’s effort to dissociate the use of bedding from the act of sleeping or \nprotection from the elements is nonsensical. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 40 of 86\n40  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nthat it applies to the act of “sleeping” in public, including \narticles  necessary  to  facilitate  sleep.    In  fact,  Martin \nexpressed concern regarding a citation given to a woman \nwho had been found sleeping on the ground, wrapped in \nblankets.  920 F.3d at 618.  Martin noted that citation as an \nexample  of  the  anti-camping  ordinance  being  “enforced \nagainst  homeless  individuals  who  take  even  the  most \nrudimentary  precautions  to  protect  themselves  from  the \nelements.”    Id.    Martin  deemed  such  enforcement \nunconstitutional.  Id.  It follows that the City cannot enforce \nits anti-camping ordinances to the extent they prohibit “the \nmost rudimentary precautions” a homeless person might \ntake against the elements.28  The City’s position that it is \nentitled  to  enforce  a  complete  prohibition  on  “bedding, \nsleeping bag, or other material used for bedding purposes” is \nincorrect. \nThe  dissent  claims  we  have  misread  Martin  by \n“completely disregard[ing] the Powell opinions on which \nMartin  relied,  which  make  unmistakably  clear  that  an \nindividualized  showing  of  involuntariness  is  required.”  \nDissent 75.  The dissent concedes that pursuant to Martin, \nthe City cannot impose criminal penalties on involuntarily \nhomeless individuals for sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on \npublic property.  Dissent 56.  Thus, our purported “complete \ndisregard[ ]” for Martin is not regarding the central holding \nthat  local  governments  may  not  criminalize  involuntary \nconduct.    Rather,  the  dissent  believes,  based  on  its \n \n28 Grants Pass is cold in the winter.  The evidence in the record \nestablishes that homeless persons in Grants Pass have struggled against \nfrostbite.  Faced with spending every minute of the day and night \noutdoors, the choice to use rudimentary protection of bedding to protect \nagainst snow, frost, or rain is not volitional; it is a life-preserving \nimperative. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 41 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  41 \n \ninterpretation of the Supreme Court opinions underlying \nMartin, that the Eighth Amendment provides only “a case-\nspecific affirmative defense” that can never be litigated on a \nclass basis.  Dissent  71.  To reach this counterintuitive \nconclusion,  the  dissent  reads  limitations  into  Robinson, \nPowell, and Martin that are nonexistent. \nIn Robinson, the Supreme Court struck down, under the \nEighth Amendment, a California law that made “it a criminal \noffense for a person to ‘be addicted to the use of narcotics.’”  \nRobinson, 370 U.S. at 666.  The law was unconstitutional, \nthe  Court  explained,  because  it  rendered  the  defendant \n“continuously guilty of this offense, whether or not he has \never used or possessed any narcotics within the State.”  Id. \nSix years later, in Powell, the Court divided 4-1-4 over \nwhether  Texas  violated  the  Eighth  Amendment  under \nRobinson  by  prosecuting  an  alcoholic  for  public \ndrunkenness.  In a plurality opinion, Justice Marshall upheld \nthe conviction of Leroy Powell on the ground that he was not \npunished on the basis of his status as an alcoholic, but rather \nfor the actus reus of being drunk in public.  Powell, 392 U.S. \nat 535.  Four justices dissented, in an opinion by Justice \nFortas, on the ground that the findings made by the trial \njudge—that Powell was a chronic alcoholic who could not \nresist the impulse to drink—compelled the conclusion that \nPowell’s  prosecution  violated  the  Eighth  Amendment \nbecause Powell could not avoid breaking the law.  Id. at 569–\n70 (Fortas, J., dissenting).  Justice White concurred in the \njudgment.  He stressed, “[i]f it cannot be a crime to have an \nirresistible compulsion to use narcotics, I do not see how it \ncan  constitutionally  be  a  crime  to  yield  to  such  a \ncompulsion.”  Id. at 549 (White, J., concurring).  However, \nthe reason for Justice White’s concurrence was that he felt \nPowell failed to prove his status as an alcoholic compelled \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 42 of 86\n42  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nhim to violate the law by appearing in public. Id. at 553 \n(White, J., concurring). \nPursuant to Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188 (1977), \nthe narrowest position which gained the support of five \njustices is treated as the holding of the Court.  In identifying \nthat position, Martin held: “five Justices [in Powell] gleaned \nfrom  Robinson  the  principle  that  ‘that  the  Eighth \nAmendment  prohibits  the  state  from  punishing  an \ninvoluntary  act  or  condition  if  it  is  the  unavoidable \nconsequence of one’s status or being.’”  Martin, 920 F.3d at \n616 (quoting Jones, 443 F.3d at 1135).  Martin did not—as \nthe dissent alleges—hold that Powell’s “controlling opinion \nwas Justice White’s concurrence.”  Dissent 54.  See id., \n920 F.3d at 616–17.  It would have violated the rule of Marks \nto adopt portions of Justice White’s concurrence that did not \nreceive the support of five justices.  The dissent claims \nJustice  White’s  concurrence  requires  that  the  individual \nclaiming  a  status  must  prove  the  status  compels  the \nindividual  to  violate  the  law—here,  that  each  homeless \nindividual  must  prove  their  status  as  an  involuntarily \nhomeless person to avoid prosecution.29  Dissent 53–56.  \n \n29 The dissent’s attempt to create a governing holding out of Justice \nWhite’s concurrence is erroneous.  By citing a word or two out of context \nin the Powell dissenting opinion (e.g., “constitutional defense”) our \ndissenting  colleague  argues  both  Justice  White  and  the  dissenting \njustices in Powell agreed any person subject to prosecution has, at most, \n“a case-specific affirmative ‘defense.’”  Dissent 53, 71.  We disagree.  \nThough status was litigated as a defense in the context of Leroy Powell’s \nprosecution, no opinion in Powell held status may be raised only as a \ndefense.  The Powell plurality noted trial court evidence that Leroy \nPowell was an alcoholic, but that opinion contains no indication “status” \nmay only be invoked as “a case-specific affirmative ‘defense.’”  As for \nJustice White, the opening paragraph of his concurrence indicates he was \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 43 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  43 \n \nThe  dissent  claims  this  renders  class  action  litigation \ninappropriate.  But no opinion in either Powell or Martin \ndiscussed the propriety of litigating the constitutionality of \nsuch criminal statutes by way of a class action.30 \n \nprimarily concerned not with how a status must be invoked but with the \nfact that certain statuses should be beyond the reach of the criminal law: \nIf  it  cannot  be  a  crime  to  have  an  irresistible \ncompulsion to use narcotics, I do not see how it can \nconstitutionally  be  a  crime  to  yield  to  such  a \ncompulsion.  Punishing  an  addict  for  using  drugs \nconvicts  for  addiction  under  a  different  name. \nDistinguishing  between  the  two  crimes  is  like \nforbidding criminal conviction for being sick with flu \nor epilepsy but permitting punishment for running a \nfever or having a convulsion. Unless Robinson is to be \nabandoned, the use of narcotics by an addict must be \nbeyond the reach of the criminal law. Similarly, the \nchronic alcoholic with an irresistible urge to consume \nalcohol should not be punishable for drinking or for \nbeing drunk. \nPowell, 392 U.S. at 548–49 (White, J., concurring) (internal citation \nomitted).  Finally, neither the remainder of Justice White’s concurrence \nnor the dissenting opinion explicitly indicates one’s status may only be \ninvoked as a defense.  Rather, Justice White and the dissenters simply \nagreed that, if Powell’s status made his public intoxication involuntary, \nhe could not be prosecuted.  There is no conceivable way to interpret \nMartin as adopting our dissenting colleague’s position that one’s status \nmust be invoked as a defense.  But even assuming the burden must be \nplaced on the party wishing to invoke a status, the class representatives \nestablished there is no genuine dispute of material fact they have the \nrelevant status of being involuntarily homeless. \n30 Federal courts have certified classes of homeless plaintiffs in the \npast, see supra note 18, which counsels against the City’s and the \ndissent’s position that such classes are impermissible under Rule 23. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 44 of 86\n44  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nThe law that the dissent purports to unearth in Justice \nWhite’s concurrence is not the “narrowest ground” which \nreceived the support of five justices.  No opinion in Powell \nor Martin supports the dissent’s assertion that Powell offers \nexclusively  an  “affirmative  ‘defense’”  that  cannot  be \nlitigated in a class action.31  Dissent 53, 71.  Although the \ndissent might prefer that these principles find support in the \ncontrolling law, they do not.  We thus do not misread Martin \nby failing to apply the principles found solely in Justice \nWhite’s  concurrence.    Rather,  we  adhere  to  the  narrow \nholding of Martin adopting the narrowest ground shared by \nfive justices in Powell: a person cannot be prosecuted for \ninvoluntary conduct if it is an unavoidable consequence of \none’s status. \nIn addition to erecting an absolute bar to class litigation \nof  this  sort,  the  dissent  would  also  impose  artificial \nlimitations  on  claims  brought  pursuant  to  Martin.    The \ndissent  concedes  Gloria  Johnson  has  standing  to  bring \nindividual challenges to most of the City’s ordinances.  But \nthe dissent then speculates that Gloria Johnson may, in fact, \nnot be involuntarily homeless in the City.  The dissent would \ninsist that Gloria Johnson, for example, leave the City to \n \n31 As noted above, Martin did not hold homeless persons bear the \nburden of demonstrating they are involuntarily homeless.  See supra note \n29.  Because the record plainly demonstrates Plaintiffs are involuntarily \nhomeless, there similarly is no reason for us to determine what showing \nwould be required.  We note, however, that some district courts have \naddressed circumstances in which the question of burden was somewhat \nrelevant.  See, e.g., McArdle, 519 F.Supp.3d at 1052 (requiring, based in \npart on Martin, that officers inquire into the availability of shelter space \nbefore making an arrest for violation of the City’s “open lodging” \nordinance); Butcher v. City of Marysville, 2019 WL 918203, at *7 (E.D. \nCal. Feb. 25, 2019) (holding plaintiffs failed to make the “threshold \nshowing” of pleading that there was no shelter capacity and that they had \nno other housing at the time of enforcement). \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 45 of 86\n  JOHNSON V.

Dissent 78–80.  There, of course, exists \nno law or rule requiring a homeless person to do any of these \nthings.  Gloria Johnson has adequately demonstrated that \nthere is no available shelter in Grants Pass and that she is \ninvoluntarily homeless. \nThe undisputed evidence establishes Gloria Johnson is \ninvoluntarily  homeless  and  there  is  undisputed  evidence \nshowing many other individuals in similar situations.  It is \nundisputed that there are at least around 50 involuntarily \nhomeless persons in Grants Pass, and PIT counts, which \nMartin relied on to establish the number of homeless persons \nin Boise, revealed more than 600.  See Martin, 920 F.3d \nat 604.  It is undisputed that there is no secular shelter space \navailable to adults.  Many class members, including the class \nrepresentatives, have sworn they are homeless and the City \nhas not contested those declarations.  The dissent claims this \nshowing is not enough, implying that Plaintiffs must meet an \nextremely  high  standard  to  show  they  are  involuntarily \nhomeless.  Even viewed in the light most favorable to the \nCity, there is no dispute of material fact that the City is home \nto many involuntarily homeless individuals, including the \nclass representatives.  In fact, neither the City nor the dissent \nhas demonstrated there is even one voluntarily homeless \nindividual living in the City.32  In light of the undisputed \n \n32 The dissent claims we have “shifted the burden to the City to \nestablish the voluntariness of the behavior targeted by the ordinances.”  \nDissent 80 n.13 (emphasis omitted).  To the contrary, as we have \nexplained, we do not decide who would bear such a burden because \nundisputed evidence demonstrates Plaintiffs are involuntarily homeless.  \nRather,  without  deciding  who  would  bear  such  a  burden  if \ninvoluntariness were subject to serious dispute, we note Plaintiffs have \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 46 of 86\n46  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nfacts in the record underlying the district court’s summary \njudgment  ruling  that  show  Plaintiffs  are  involuntarily \nhomeless,  and  the  complete  absence  of  evidence  that \nPlaintiffs are voluntarily homeless, we agree with the district \ncourt  that  Plaintiffs  such  as  Gloria  Johnson  are  not \nvoluntarily homeless and that the anti-camping ordinances \nare unconstitutional as applied to them unless there is some \nplace, such as shelter, they can lawfully sleep.33 \n \ndemonstrated involuntariness and there is no evidence in the record \nshowing any class member has adequate alternative shelter. \n33 Following Martin, several district courts have held that the \ngovernment may evict or punish sleeping in public in some locations, \nprovided  there  are  other  lawful  places  within  the  jurisdiction  for \ninvoluntarily homeless individuals to sleep.  See, e.g., Shipp v. Schaaf, \n379 F.Supp.3d 1033, 1037 (N.D. Cal. 2019) (“However, even assuming \n(as Plaintiffs do) that [eviction from a homeless encampment by citation \nor arrest] might occur, remaining at a particular encampment on public \nproperty is not conduct protected by Martin, especially where the closure \nis temporary in nature.”); Aitken v. City of Aberdeen, 393 F.Supp.3d \n1075, 1082 (W.D. Wash. 2019) (“Martin does not limit the City’s ability \nto evict homeless individuals from particular public places.”); Gomes v. \nCty. of Kauai, 481 F.Supp.3d 1104, 1109 (D. Haw. 2020) (holding the \nCounty of Kauai could prohibit sleeping in a public park because it had \nnot  prohibited  sleeping  on  other  public  lands);  Miralle  v.  City  of \nOakland, 2018 WL 6199929, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 28, 2018) (holding \nthe City could clear out a specific homeless encampment because \n“Martin  does  not  establish  a  constitutional  right  to  occupy  public \nproperty indefinitely at Plaintiffs’ option”); Le Van Hung v. Schaaf, 2019 \nWL 1779584, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 23, 2019) (holding Martin does not \n“create a right for homeless residents to occupy indefinitely any public \nspace of their choosing”).  Because the City has not established any \nrealistically available place within the jurisdiction for involuntarily \nhomeless individuals to sleep we need not decide whether alternate \noutdoor space would be sufficient under Martin.  The district court may \nconsider this issue on remand, if it is germane to do so. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 47 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  47 \n \nOur holding that the City’s interpretation of the anti-\ncamping  ordinances  is  counter  to  Martin  is  not  to  be \ninterpreted to hold that the anti-camping ordinances were \nproperly  enjoined  in  their  entirety.    Beyond  prohibiting \nbedding, the ordinances also prohibit the use of stoves or \nfires, as well as the erection of any structures.  The record \nhas not established the fire, stove, and structure prohibitions \ndeprive homeless persons of sleep or “the most rudimentary \nprecautions” against the elements.34  Moreover, the record \ndoes not explain the City’s interest in these prohibitions.35  \nConsistent with Martin, these prohibitions may or may not \nbe  permissible.    On  remand,  the  district  court  will  be \nrequired  to  craft  a  narrower  injunction  recognizing \nPlaintiffs’ limited right to protection against the elements, as \nwell as limitations when a shelter bed is available.36 \n \n34 The dissent claims we establish “the right to use (at least) a tent.”  \nDissent 82 n.15.  This assertion is obviously false.  The district court’s \nholding that the City may still “ban the use of tents in public parks” \nremains undisturbed by our opinion. \n35 The dissent asserts, “it is hard to deny that Martin has ‘generate[d] \ndire practical consequences for the hundreds of local governments within \nour jurisdiction, and for the millions of people that reside therein.’”  \nDissent 85 (quoting Martin, 920 F.3d at 594 (M. Smith, J., dissenting \nfrom denial of rehearing en banc)) (modification in original).  There are \nno facts in the record to establish that Martin has generated “dire” \nconsequences for the City.  Our review of this case is governed only by \nthe evidence contained in the record. \n36 The district court enjoined the park exclusion ordinance in its \nentirety.  The parties do not address this in their appellate briefing but, \non remand, the district court should consider narrowing this portion as \nwell because the park exclusion ordinance presumably may be enforced \nagainst Plaintiffs who engage in prohibited activity unrelated to their \nstatus as homeless persons. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 48 of 86\n48  JOHNSON V.

A \ncentral portion of the district court’s analysis regarding these \nfines was that they were based on conduct “beyond what the \nCity may constitutionally punish.”  With this in mind, the \ndistrict court noted “[a]ny fine [would be] excessive” for the \nconduct at issue. \nThe City presents no meaningful argument on appeal \nregarding the excessive fines issue.  As for Plaintiffs, they \nargue the fines at issue were properly deemed excessive \nbecause they were imposed for “engaging in involuntary, \nunavoidable life sustaining acts.”  The permanent injunction \nwill result in no class member being fined for engaging in \nsuch protected activity.  Because no fines will be imposed \nfor protected activity, there is no need for us to address \nwhether hypothetical fines would be excessive. \nE. \nThe final issue is whether Plaintiffs properly pled their \nchallenge to the park exclusion appeals ordinance.  GPMC \n6.46.355.  That ordinance provided a mechanism whereby \nan individual who received an exclusion order could appeal \nto the City Council.  Subsequent to the district court’s order, \nthe  City  amended  its  park  exclusion  appeals  ordinance.  \nTherefore, the district court’s determination the previous \nordinance violated Plaintiffs’ procedural due process rights \nhas no prospective relevance.  Because of this, we need not \ndecide if Plaintiffs adequately pled their challenge to the \nprevious ordinance. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 49 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  49 \n \nIII. \nWe affirm the district court’s ruling that the City of \nGrants Pass cannot, consistent with the Eighth Amendment, \nenforce  its  anti-camping  ordinances  against  homeless \npersons  for  the  mere  act  of  sleeping  outside  with \nrudimentary protection from the elements, or for sleeping in \ntheir car at night, when there is no other place in the City for \nthem to go.  On remand, however, the district court must \nnarrow its injunction to enjoin only those portions of the \nanti-camping ordinances that prohibit conduct protected by \nMartin and this opinion.  In particular, the district court \nshould narrow its injunction to the anti-camping ordinances \nand enjoin enforcement of those ordinances only against \ninvoluntarily  homeless  person  for  engaging  in  conduct \nnecessary to protect themselves from the elements when \nthere is no shelter space available.  Finally, the district court \non remand should consider whether there is an adequate \nrepresentative who may be substituted for Debra Blake. \nWe are careful to note that, as in Martin, our decision is \nnarrow.    As  in  Martin,  we  hold  simply  that  it  is \n“unconstitutional to [punish] simply sleeping somewhere in \npublic if one has nowhere else to do so.”  Martin, 920 F.3d \nat 590 (Berzon, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en \nbanc).  Our decision reaches beyond Martin slightly.  We \nhold, where Martin did not, that class certification is not \ncategorically  impermissible  in  cases  such  as  this,  that \n“sleeping” in the context of Martin includes sleeping with \nrudimentary forms of protection from the elements, and that \nMartin applies to civil citations where, as here, the civil and \ncriminal punishments are closely intertwined.  Our decision \ndoes not address a regime of purely civil infractions, nor \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 50 of 86\n50  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \ndoes it prohibit the City from attempting other solutions to \nthe homelessness issue. \nAFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND \nREMANDED. \n \nCOLLINS, Circuit Judge, dissenting: \nIn Martin v. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584 (9th Cir. 2019), \nwe held that “the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel \nand unusual punishment bars a city from prosecuting people \ncriminally for sleeping outside on public property when \nthose people have no home or other shelter to go to.”  Id. \nat 603.    Even  assuming  that  Martin  remains  good  law, \ntoday’s decision—which both misreads and greatly expands \nMartin’s holding—is egregiously wrong.  To make things \nworse,  the  majority  opinion  then  combines  its  gross \nmisreading of Martin with a flagrant disregard of settled \nclass-certification  principles.    The  end  result  of  this \namalgamation of error is that the majority validates the core \naspects of the district court’s extraordinary injunction in this \ncase, which effectively requires the City of Grants Pass to \nallow all but one of its public parks to be used as homeless \nencampments.1  I respectfully dissent. \n \n1 The majority’s decision is all the more troubling because, in truth, \nthe foundation on which it is built is deeply flawed: Martin seriously \nmisconstrued the Eighth Amendment and the Supreme Court’s caselaw \nconstruing it.  See infra at 83–85.  But I am bound by Martin, and—\nunlike the majority—I faithfully apply it here. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 51 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  51 \n \nI \nBecause our opinion in Martin frames the issues here, I \nbegin  with  a  detailed  overview  of  that  decision  before \nturning to the facts of the case before us. \nA \nIn Martin, six individuals sued the City of Boise, Idaho, \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the City had violated \ntheir Eighth Amendment rights in enforcing two ordinances \nthat respectively barred, inter alia, (1) camping in public \nspaces and (2) sleeping in public places without permission.  \n920  F.3d  at  603–04,  606.    All  six  plaintiffs  had  been \nconvicted of violating at least one of the ordinances, id. \nat 606, but we held that claims for retrospective relief based \non those convictions were barred by the doctrine of Heck v. \nHumphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994).  See Martin, 920 F.3d \nat 611–12 (noting that, under Heck, a § 1983 action may not \nbe maintained if success in the suit would necessarily show \nthe invalidity of the plaintiff’s criminal conviction, unless \nthat conviction has already been set aside or invalidated).  \nWhat remained, after application of the Heck bar, were the \nclaims  for  retrospective  relief  asserted  by  two  plaintiffs \n(Robert Martin and Pamela Hawkes) in connection with \ncitations they had received that did not result in convictions, \nand the claims for prospective injunctive and declaratory \nrelief asserted by Martin and one additional plaintiff (Robert \nAnderson).  Id. at 604, 610, 613–15; see also id. at 618–20 \n(Owens,  J.,  dissenting  in  part)  (dissenting  from  the \nmajority’s holding that the prospective relief claims survived \nHeck).    On  the  merits  of  those  three  plaintiffs’  Eighth \nAmendment claims, the Martin panel held that the district \ncourt had erred in granting summary judgment for the City.  \nId. at 615–18. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 52 of 86\n52  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nAlthough the text of the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and \nUnusual Punishments Clause states only that “cruel and \nunusual punishments” shall not be “inflicted,” U.S. CONST., \namend. VIII (emphasis added), the Martin panel nonetheless \nheld  that  the  Clause  “places  substantive  limits”  on  the \ngovernment’s  ability  to  criminalize  “sitting,  sleeping,  or \nlying outside on public property,” 920 F.3d at 615–16.  In \nreaching this conclusion, the Martin panel placed dispositive \nreliance on the Supreme Court’s decisions in Robinson v. \nCalifornia,  370  U.S.  660  (1962),  and  Powell  v.  Texas, \n392 U.S. 514 (1968).  I therefore briefly review those two \ndecisions before returning to Martin. \nRobinson held that a California law that made “it a \ncriminal offense for a person to ‘be addicted to the use of \nnarcotics,’”  370  U.S.  at  660  (quoting  CAL.  HEALTH  & \nSAFETY CODE § 11721 (1957 ed.)), and that did so “even \nthough [the person] has never touched any narcotic drug \nwithin the State or been guilty of any irregular behavior \nthere, inflicts a cruel and unusual punishment in violation of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment,” id. at 667.  The California \nstatute, the Court emphasized, made the “‘status’ of narcotic \naddiction  a  criminal  offense,”  regardless  of  whether  the \ndefendant had “ever used or possessed any narcotics within \nthe State” or had “been guilty of any antisocial behavior \nthere.”  Id. at 666 (emphasis added). \nIn Powell, a fractured Supreme Court rejected Powell’s \nchallenge to his conviction, under a Texas statute, for being \n“found  in  a  state  of  intoxication  in  any  public  place.”  \n392 U.S. at 517 (quoting TEX. PENAL CODE art. 477 (1952)).  \nA  four-Justice  plurality  distinguished  Robinson  on  the \nground that, because Powell “was convicted, not for being a \nchronic alcoholic, but for being in public while drunk on a \nparticular occasion,” Texas had “not sought to punish a mere \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 53 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  53 \n \nstatus, as California did in Robinson.”  Id. at 532 (plurality).  \nThe plurality held that Robinson did not address, much less \nestablish, that “certain conduct cannot constitutionally be \npunished  because  it  is,  in  some  sense,  ‘involuntary’  or \n‘occasioned by a compulsion.’”  Id. at 533 (emphasis added). \nJustice White concurred in the judgment on the narrower \nground that Powell had failed to establish the “prerequisites \nto the possible invocation of the Eighth Amendment,” which \nwould have required him to “satisfactorily show[] that it was \nnot feasible for him to have made arrangements to prevent \nhis  being  in  public  when  drunk  and  that  his  extreme \ndrunkenness sufficiently deprived him of his faculties on the \noccasion in issue.”  Id. at 552 (White, J., concurring).  And \nbecause, in Justice White’s view, the Eighth Amendment at \nmost  provided  a  case-specific  affirmative  “defense”  to \napplication of the statute, id. at 552 n.4, he agreed that the \nTexas statute was “constitutional insofar as it authorizes a \npolice  officer  to  arrest  any  seriously  intoxicated  person \nwhen he is encountered in a public place,” id. at 554 n.5 \n(emphasis added).  Emphasizing that Powell himself “did \nnot show that his conviction offended the Constitution” and \nthat Powell had “made no showing that he was unable to stay \noff  the  streets  on  the  night  in  question,”  Justice  White \nconcurred  in  the  majority’s  affirmance  of  Powell’s \nconviction.  Id. at 554 (emphasis added). \nThe four dissenting Justices in Powell agreed that the \nTexas statute “differ[ed] from that in Robinson” inasmuch as \nit “covers more than a mere status.”  392 U.S. at 567 (Fortas, \nJ., dissenting).  There was, as the dissenters noted, “no \nchallenge here to the validity of public intoxication statutes \nin general or to the Texas public intoxication statute in \nparticular.”  Id. at 558.  Indeed, the dissenters agreed that, in \nthe  ordinary  case  “when  the  State  proves  such  [public] \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 54 of 86\n54  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \npresence in a state of intoxication, this will be sufficient for \nconviction, and the punishment prescribed by the State may, \nof course, be validly imposed.”  Id. at 569.  Instead, the \ndissenters concluded that the application of the statute to \nPowell was unconstitutional “on the occasion in question” \nin light of the Texas trial court’s findings about Powell’s \ninability to control his condition.  Id. at 568 n.31 (emphasis \nadded).  Those findings concerning Powell’s “constitutional \ndefense,” the dissenters concluded, established that Powell \n“was  powerless  to  avoid  drinking”  and  “that,  once \nintoxicated, he could not prevent himself from appearing in \npublic places.”  Id. at 558, 568; see also id. at 525 (plurality) \n(describing the elements of the “constitutional defense” that \nPowell sought to have the Court recognize). \nWhile acknowledging that the plurality in Powell had \n“interpret[ed]  Robinson  as  precluding  only  the \ncriminalization of ‘status,’ not of ‘involuntary’ conduct,” the \nMartin panel held that the controlling opinion was Justice \nWhite’s concurrence.  920 F.3d at 616.  As I have noted, \nJustice White concluded that the Texas statute against public \ndrunkenness could constitutionally be applied, even to an \nalcoholic, if the defendant failed to “satisfactorily show[] \nthat it was not feasible for him to have made arrangements \nto prevent his being in public when drunk and that his \nextreme  drunkenness  sufficiently  deprived  him  of  his \nfaculties on the occasion in issue.”  Powell, 392 U.S. at 552 \n(White, J., concurring).2  Under Marks v. United States, \n \n2 Justice White, however, did not resolve the further question of \nwhether, if such a showing had been made, the Eighth Amendment \nwould have been violated.  He stated that the Eighth Amendment “might \nbar conviction” in such circumstances, but he found it “unnecessary” to \ndecide  whether  that  “novel  construction  of  that  Amendment”  was \nultimately correct.  392 U.S. at 552–53 & n.4 (emphasis added). \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 55 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  55 \n \n430 U.S.  188  (1977),  this  narrower  reasoning  given  by \nJustice White for joining the Powell majority’s judgment \nupholding the conviction constitutes the Court’s holding in \nthat case.  See id. at 193 (“When a fragmented Court decides \na case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the \nassent of five Justices, ‘the holding of the Court may be \nviewed  as  that  position  taken  by  those  Members  who \nconcurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.’” \n(citation omitted)); see also United States v. Moore, 486 F.2d \n1139,  1151  (D.C.  Cir.  1973)  (en  banc)  (Wilkey,  J., \nconcurring) (concluding that the judgment in Powell rested \non the overlap in the views of “four members of the Court” \nwho held that Powell’s acts of public drunkenness “were \npunishable without question” and the view of Justice White \nthat Powell’s acts “were punishable so long as the acts had \nnot  been  proved  to  be  the  product  of  an  established \nirresistible compulsion”). \nThe  Martin  panel  quoted  dicta  in  Justice  White’s \nconcurrence suggesting that, if the defendant could make the \nrequisite  “showing”  that  “resisting  drunkenness  is \nimpossible and that avoiding public places when intoxicated \nis also impossible,” then the Texas statute “[a]s applied” to \nsuch  persons  might  violate  “the  Eighth  Amendment.”  \n920 F.3d at 616 (quoting Powell, 392 U.S. at 551 (White, J., \nconcurring)).  These dicta, Martin noted, overlapped with \nsimilar statements in the dissenting opinion in Powell, and \nfrom  those  two  opinions,  the  Martin  panel  derived  the \nproposition that “five Justices” had endorsed the view that \n“the Eighth Amendment prohibits the state from punishing \nan  involuntary  act  or  condition  if  it  is  the  unavoidable \nconsequence of one’s status or being.”  Id. (citation omitted).  \nApplying  that  principle,  Martin  held  that  “the  Eighth \nAmendment prohibits the imposition of criminal penalties \nfor sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public property for \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 56 of 86\n56  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nhomeless  individuals  who  cannot  obtain  shelter.”    Id.  \nBecause “human beings are biologically compelled to rest, \nwhether by sitting, lying, or sleeping,” Martin held that \nprohibitions on such activities in public cannot be applied to \nthose who simply have “no option of sleeping indoors.”  Id. \nat 617. \nThe  Martin  panel  emphasized  that  its  “holding  is  a \nnarrow  one.”    Id.    Martin  recognized  that,  if  there  are \nsufficient available shelter beds for all homeless persons \nwithin a jurisdiction, then of course there can be no Eighth \nAmendment impediment to enforcing laws against sleeping \nand camping in public, because those persons engaging in \nsuch activities cannot be said to have “no option of sleeping \nindoors.”  Id.  But “so long as there is a greater number of \nhomeless individuals in a jurisdiction than the number of \navailable beds in shelters, the jurisdiction cannot prosecute \nhomeless individuals for involuntarily sitting, lying, and \nsleeping  in  public.”    Id.  (simplified)  (emphasis  added).  \nConsistent with Justice White’s concurrence, the Martin \npanel emphasized that, in determining whether the defendant \nwas being punished for conduct that was “involuntary and \ninseparable from status,” id. (citation omitted), the specific \nindividual  circumstances  of  the  defendant  must  be \nconsidered.  Thus, Martin explained, the panel’s “holding \ndoes not cover individuals who do have access to adequate \ntemporary shelter, whether because they have the means to \npay for it or because it is realistically available to them for \nfree, but who choose not to use it.”  Id. at 617 n.8.  But \nMartin held that, where it is shown that homeless persons \n“do not have a single place where they can lawfully be,” an \nordinance against sleeping or camping in public, “as applied \nto them, effectively punish[es] them for something for which \nthey may not be convicted under the Eighth Amendment.”  \nId.  at  617  (simplified).    Concluding  that  the  remaining \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 57 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  57 \n \nplaintiffs had “demonstrated a genuine issue of material \nfact” as to their lack of any access to indoor shelter, Martin \nreversed the district court’s grant of summary judgment to \nthe City.  Id. at 617 n.9; see also id. at 617–18. \nB \nWith that backdrop in place, I turn to the specific facts of \nthis case. \nIn  the  operative  Third  Amended  Complaint,  named \nPlaintiffs Debra Blake, Gloria Johnson, and John Logan \nsought to represent a putative class of “all involuntarily \nhomeless people living in Grants Pass, Oregon” in pursuing \na variety of claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the City \nof Grants Pass.  In particular, they asserted that the following \nthree  sections  of  the  Grants  Pass  Municipal  Code \n(“GPMC”),  which  generally  prohibited  sleeping  and \ncamping in public, violated the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel \nand Unusual Punishments Clause and its Excessive Fines \nClause: \n5.61.020  Sleeping  on  Sidewalks,  Streets, \nAlleys, or Within Doorways Prohibited \nA.  No  person  may  sleep  on  public \nsidewalks, streets, or  alleyways at any \ntime as a matter of individual and public \nsafety. \nB.

CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nIn an August 2019 order, the district court certified a \nclass seeking declaratory and injunctive relief with respect \nto Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claims, pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).5  As defined in the court’s \norder, the class consists of “[a]ll involuntarily homeless \nindividuals  living  in  Grants  Pass,  Oregon,  including \nhomeless  individuals  who  sometimes  sleep  outside  city \nlimits to avoid harassment and punishment by Defendant as \naddressed in this lawsuit.” \nAfter  the  parties  filed  cross-motions  for  summary \njudgment, the district court in July 2020 granted Plaintiffs’ \nmotion in relevant part and denied the City’s motion.  The \ndistrict court held that, under Martin, the City’s enforcement \nof the above-described ordinances violated the Cruel and \nUnusual Punishments Clause.  The court further held that, \nfor similar reasons, the ordinances imposed excessive fines \nin violation of the Eighth Amendment’s Excessive Fines \nClause. \nAfter Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed those claims as to \nwhich summary judgment had been denied to both sides, the \ndistrict court entered final judgment declaring that the City’s \nenforcement  of  the  anti-camping  and  anti-sleeping \n \nB. Is issued one or more citations for violating any \nstate law(s) while on City park property. \nThe foregoing exclusion order shall only apply to the \nparticular City park in which the offending conduct \nunder 6.46.350(A) or 6.46.350(B) occurred. \n5 At the time that the district court certified the class, the operative \ncomplaint was the Second Amended Complaint.  That complaint was \nmaterially  comparable  to  the  Third  Amended  Complaint,  with  the \nexception that it did not mention the park-exclusion ordinance or seek \ninjunctive relief with respect to it. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 61 of 86\n  JOHNSON V.

The City was enjoined from enforcing \nthe  anti-camping  ordinances  (GPMC  §§ 6.46.030  and \n6.46.090) “without first giving a person a warning of at least \n24 hours before enforcement.”  It was further enjoined from \nenforcing those ordinances, and a related ordinance against \ncriminal trespass on city property, in all but one City park \nduring specified evening and overnight hours, which varied \ndepending upon the time of year.  Finally, the City was \nenjoined from enforcing the park-exclusion ordinance.6 \nThe City timely appealed from that judgment and from \nthe district court’s subsequent award of attorneys’ fees. \nII \nBefore turning to the merits, I first address the question \nof our jurisdiction under Article  III of the Constitution.  \nPlains  Com.

The parties dispute \nwhether this claim was adequately raised and reached below, but as the \nmajority notes, this claim for purely prospective relief has been mooted \nby the City’s subsequent amendment of § 6.46.355 in a way that removes \nthe features that had led to its invalidation.  See Opin. at 48.  Accordingly, \nthis aspect of the district court’s judgment should be vacated and \nremanded with instructions to dismiss as moot Plaintiffs’ challenge to \n§ 6.46.355. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 62 of 86\n62  JOHNSON V.

Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 492 (2009).  \n“The doctrine of standing is one of several doctrines that \nreflect this fundamental limitation,” and in the context of a \nrequest for prospective injunctive or declaratory relief, that \ndoctrine requires a plaintiff to “show that he is under threat \nof  suffering  ‘injury  in  fact’  that  is  concrete  and \nparticularized; the threat must be actual and imminent, not \nconjectural or hypothetical; it must be fairly traceable to the \nchallenged action of the defendant; and it must be likely that \na favorable judicial decision will prevent or redress the \ninjury.”  Id. at 493.  The requirement to show an actual threat \nof imminent injury-in-fact in order to obtain prospective \nrelief  is  a  demanding  one:  the  Supreme  Court  has \n“repeatedly  reiterated  that  threatened  injury  must  be \ncertainly impending to constitute injury in fact, and that \nallegations  of  possible  future  injury  are  not  sufficient.”  \nClapper v.

Moreover, “standing is \nnot  dispensed  in  gross,”  and  therefore  “a  plaintiff  must \ndemonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press.”  \nDaimlerChrysler  Corp.  v.  Cuno,  547  U.S.  332,  352–53 \n(2006) (emphasis added) (citation omitted). \nPlaintiffs’ operative complaint named three individual \nplaintiffs  as  class  representatives  (John  Logan,  Gloria \nJohnson, and Debra Blake), and we have jurisdiction to \naddress the merits of a particular claim if any one of them \nsufficiently established Article III standing as to that claim.  \nSee Secretary of the Interior v. California, 464 U.S. 312, 319 \nn.3 (1984) (“Since the State of California clearly does have \nstanding, we need not address the standing of the other \n[plaintiffs], whose position here is identical to the State’s.”); \nsee also Bates v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 511 F.3d 974, \n985 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (“In a class action, standing is \nsatisfied  if  at  least  one  named  plaintiff  meets  the \nrequirements.”).  Accordingly, I address the showing made \nby each named Plaintiff in support of summary judgment. \nIn my view, Plaintiff John Logan failed to establish that \nhe  has  standing  to  challenge  any  of  the  ordinances  in \nquestion.  In support of his motion for summary judgment, \nLogan  submitted  a  half-page  declaration  stating,  in \nconclusory fashion, that he is “involuntarily homeless in \nGrants Pass,” but that he is “sleeping in [his] truck at night \nat a rest stop North of Grants Pass.”  He asserted that he \n“cannot sleep in the City of Grants Pass for fear that [he] will \nbe awakened, ticketed, fined, moved along, trespassed[,] and \ncharged with Criminal Trespass.”  Logan also previously \nsubmitted  two  declarations  in  support  of  his  class \ncertification motion.  In them, Logan stated that he has been \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 64 of 86\n64  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nhomeless in Grants Pass for nearly seven of the last 10 years; \nthat there have been occasions in the past in which police in \nGrants Pass have awakened him in his car and instructed him \nto move on; and that he now generally sleeps in his truck \noutside of Grants Pass.  Logan has made no showing that, \nover the seven years that he has been homeless, he has ever \nbeen  issued  a  citation  for  violating  the  challenged \nordinances, nor has he provided any facts to establish either \nthat the threat of such a citation is “certainly impending” or \nthat “there is a substantial risk” that he may be issued a \ncitation.  Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, \n158 (2014) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  \nAt best, his declarations suggest that he would prefer to sleep \nin his truck within the City limits rather than outside them, \nand that he is subjectively deterred from doing so due to the \nCity’s ordinances.  But such “[a]llegations of a subjective \n‘chill’ are not an adequate substitute for a claim of specific \npresent objective harm or a threat of specific future harm.”  \nLaird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 13–14 (1972).  Nor has Logan \nprovided any facts that would show that he has any actual \nintention or plans to stay overnight in the City.  See Lopez v. \nCandaele, 630 F.3d 775, 787 (9th Cir. 2010) (“[W]e have \nconcluded  that  pre-enforcement  plaintiffs  who  failed  to \nallege a concrete intent to violate the challenged law could \nnot establish a credible threat of enforcement.”).  Even if his \ndeclarations could be generously construed as asserting an \nintention to stay in the City at some future point, “[s]uch \n‘some day’ intentions—without any description of concrete \nplans, or indeed even any specification of when the some day \nwill be—do not support a finding of the ‘actual or imminent’ \ninjury that [the Court’s] cases require.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. \nat 564;  cf.  Driehaus,  573  U.S.  at  161  (permitting  pre-\nenforcement  challenge  against  ordinance  regulating \nelection-related  speech  where  plaintiffs’  allegations \nidentified “specific statements they intend[ed] to make in \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 65 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  65 \n \nfuture election cycles”).  And, contrary to what the majority \nsuggests, see Opin. at 24 n.16, Logan’s vaguely described \nknowledge about what has happened to other people cannot \nestablish his standing.  Accordingly, Logan failed to carry \nhis burden to establish standing for the prospective relief he \nseeks. \nBy contrast, Plaintiff Gloria Johnson made a sufficient \nshowing that she has standing to challenge the general anti-\ncamping ordinance, GPMC § 5.61.030, and the parks anti-\ncamping ordinance, GPMC § 6.46.090.  Although Johnson’s \nearlier declaration in support of class certification stated that \nshe “often” sleeps in her van outside the City limits, she also \nstated that she “continue[s] to live without shelter in Grants \nPass” and that, consequently, “[a]t any time, I could be \narrested, ticketed, fined, and prosecuted for sleeping outside \nin my van or for covering myself with a blanket to stay \nwarm” (emphasis added).  Her declaration also recounts \n“dozens of occasions” in which the anti-camping ordinances \nhave been enforced against her, either by instructions to \n“move along” or, in one instance, by issuance of a citation \nfor  violating  the  parks  anti-camping  ordinance,  GPMC \n§ 6.46.090.  Because Johnson presented facts showing that \nshe continues to violate the anti-camping ordinances and \nthat, in light of past enforcement, she faces a credible threat \nof future enforcement, she has standing to challenge those \nordinances.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564.  Johnson, however, \npresented no facts that would establish standing to challenge \neither the anti-sleeping ordinance (which, unlike the anti-\ncamping ordinances, does not apply to sleeping in a vehicle), \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 66 of 86\n66  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nthe  park-exclusion  ordinance,  or  the  criminal  trespass \nordinance.7 \nDebra Blake sufficiently established her standing, both \nin connection with the class certification motion and the \nsummary  judgment  motion.    Although  she  was  actually \nliving in temporary housing at the time she submitted her \ndeclarations in support of class certification in March and \nJune 2019, she explained that that temporary housing would \nsoon expire; that she would become homeless in Grants Pass \nagain; and that she would therefore again be subject to being \n“arrested, ticketed and prosecuted for sleeping outside or for \ncovering myself with a blanket to stay warm.”  And, as her \n \n7 The majority concludes that Johnson’s standing to challenge the \nanti-camping  ordinances  necessarily  establishes  her  standing  to \nchallenge the park-exclusion and criminal-trespass ordinances.  See \nOpin. at 24 n.15.  But as the district court explained, the undisputed \nevidence concerning Grants Pass’s enforcement policies established that \n“Grants Pass first issues fines for violations and then either issues a \ntrespass order or excludes persons from all parks before a person is \ncharged  with  misdemeanor  criminal  trespass”  (emphasis  added).  \nAlthough Johnson’s continued intention to sleep in her vehicle in Grants \nPass  gives  her  standing  to  challenge  the  anti-camping  ordinances, \nJohnson has wholly failed to plead any facts to show, inter alia, that she \nintends to engage in the further conduct that might expose her to a \n“credible threat” of prosecution under the park-exclusion or criminal \ntrespass ordinances.  Driehaus, 573 U.S. at 159 (citation omitted).  \nJohnson’s declaration states that she has been homeless in Grants Pass \nfor three years, but it does not contend that she has ever been issued, or \nthreatened with issuance of, a trespass order, a park-exclusion order, or \na criminal trespass charge or that she has “an intention to engage in a \ncourse of conduct” that would lead to such an order or charge.  Id. \n(citation omitted).  Because “standing is not dispensed in gross,” see \nDaimlerChrysler, 547 U.S. at 353 (citation omitted), Johnson must \nseparately establish her standing with respect to each ordinance, and she \nhas failed to do so with respect to the park-exclusion and criminal-\ntrespass ordinances. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 67 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  67 \n \ndeclaration at summary judgment showed, that is exactly \nwhat  happened:  in  September  2019,  she  was  cited  for \nsleeping  in  the  park  in  violation  of  GPMC  § 6.46.090, \nconvicted, and fined.  Her declarations also confirmed that \nBlake’s persistence in sleeping and camping in a variety of \nplaces in Grants Pass had also resulted in a park-exclusion \norder (which she successfully appealed), and in citations for \nviolation of the anti-sleeping ordinance, GPMC § 5.61.020 \n(for sleeping in an alley), and for criminal trespass on City \nproperty.  Based on this showing, I conclude that Blake \nestablished standing to challenge each of the ordinances at \nissue in the district court’s judgment. \nHowever, Blake subsequently passed away during this \nlitigation,  as  her  counsel  noted  in  a  letter  to  this  court \nsubmitted under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 43(a).  \nBecause  the  only  relief  she  sought  was  prospective \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, Blake’s death moots her \nclaims.  King v. County of Los Angeles, 885 F.3d 548, 553, \n559 (9th Cir. 2018).  And because, as explained earlier, \nBlake was the only named Plaintiff who established standing \nwith  respect  to  the  anti-sleeping,  park-exclusion,  and \ncriminal  trespass  ordinances  that  are  the  subject  of  the \ndistrict  court’s  classwide  judgment,  her  death  raises  the \nquestion whether we consequently lack jurisdiction over \nthose additional claims.  Under Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393 \n(1975), the answer to that question would appear to be no.  \nBlake established her standing at the time that the class was \ncertified and, as a result, “[w]hen the District Court certified \nthe  propriety  of  the  class  action,  the  class  of  unnamed \npersons described in the certification acquired a legal status \nseparate from the interest asserted by [Blake].”  Id. at 399.  \n“Although the controversy is no longer alive as to [Blake], it \nremains very much alive for the class of persons she [had] \nbeen certified to represent.”  Id. at 401; see also Nielsen v. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 68 of 86\n68  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nPreap, 139 S. Ct. 954, 963 (2019) (finding no mootness \nwhere “there was at least one named plaintiff with a live \nclaim when the class was certified”); Bates v. United Parcel \nService, Inc., 511 F.3d 974, 987–88 (9th Cir. 2007) (en \nbanc). \nThere is, however, presently no class representative who \nmeets the requirements for representing the certified class \nwith  respect  to  the  anti-sleeping,  park-exclusion,  and \ncriminal  trespass  ordinances.8    Although  that  would \nnormally require a remand to permit the possible substitution \nof a new class member, see Kuahulu v. Employers Ins. of \nWausau, 557 F.2d 1334, 1336–37 (9th Cir. 1977), I see no \nneed to do so here, and that remains true even if one assumes \nthat the failure to substitute a new class representative might \notherwise present a potential jurisdictional defect.  As noted \nearlier, we have jurisdiction to address all claims concerning \nthe two anti-camping ordinances, as to which Johnson has \n \n8 Because—in contrast to the named representative in Sosna, who \nhad Article III standing at the time of certification—Johnson and Logan \nnever had standing to represent the class with respect to the anti-sleeping \nordinance, they may not represent the class as to such claims.  See Sosna, \n419 U.S. at 403 (holding that a previously proper class representative \nwhose claims had become moot on appeal could continue to represent \nthe class for purposes of that appeal); see also Bates, 511 F.3d at 987 \n(emphasizing that the named plaintiff “had standing at the time of \ncertification”); B.K. ex rel. Tinsley v. Snyder, 922 F.3d 957, 966 (9th Cir. \n2019)  (stating  that  “class  representatives  must  have  Article  III \nstanding”); cf. NEI Contracting & Eng’g, Inc. v. Hanson Aggregates \nPac. SW., Inc., 926 F.3d 528, 533 (9th Cir. 2019) (holding that, where \nthe named plaintiffs never had standing, the class “must be decertified”).  \nThe  majority  correctly  concedes  this  point.    See  Opin.  at  25–26.  \nNonetheless,  the  majority  wrongly  allows  Johnson  and  Logan  to \nrepresent  the  class  as  to  the  park-exclusion  and  criminal-trespass \nordinances, based on its erroneous conclusion that they established \nstanding to challenge those ordinances.  See supra at 63–66 & n.7. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 69 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  69 \n \nsufficient standing to represent the certified class.  And, as I \nshall  explain,  the  class  as  to  those  claims  should  be \ndecertified, and the reasons for that decertification rest on \ncross-cutting grounds that apply equally to all claims.  As a \nresult, I conclude that we have jurisdiction to order the \ncomplete decertification of the class as to all claims, without \nthe need for a remand to substitute a new class representative \nas to the anti-sleeping, park-exclusion, and criminal trespass \nordinances.  Cf. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, \n523 U.S. 83, 98 (1998) (holding that, where “a merits issue \n[is] dispositively resolved in a companion case,” that merits \nruling could be applied to the other companion case without \nthe need for a remand to resolve a potential jurisdictional \nissue). \nIII \nI therefore turn to whether the district court properly \ncertified the class under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure.  In my view, the district court relied on erroneous \nlegal premises in certifying the class, and it therefore abused \nits discretion in doing so.  B.K., 922 F.3d at 965. \nA \n“To obtain certification of a plaintiff class under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23, a plaintiff must satisfy both the \nfour  requirements  of  Rule  23(a)—‘numerosity, \ncommonality, typicality, and adequate representation’—and \n‘one of the three requirements listed in Rule 23(b).’”  A.B. v. \nHawaii State Dep’t of Educ., 30 F.4th 828, 834 (9th Cir. \n2022) (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. \n338, 345, 349 (2011)).  Commonality, which is contested \nhere, requires a showing that the class members’ claims \n“depend upon a common contention” that is “of such a \nnature  that  it  is  capable  of  classwide  resolution—which \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 70 of 86\n70  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nmeans that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve \nan issue that is central to the validity of each one of the \nclaims in one stroke.”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350.  In finding \nthat commonality was satisfied with respect to the Eighth \nAmendment claims, the district court relied solely on the \npremise that whether the City’s conduct “violates the Eighth \nAmendment” was a common question that could be resolved \non a classwide basis.  And in finding that Rule 23(b) was \nsatisfied  here,  the  district  court  relied  solely  on  Rule \n23(b)(2),  which  provides  that  a  “class  action  may  be \nmaintained” if “the party opposing the class has acted or \nrefused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so \nthat final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief \nis appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  FED. R. CIV. \nP. 23(b)(2).  That requirement was satisfied, the district court \nconcluded,  because  (for  reasons  similar  to  those  that \nunderlay its commonality analysis) the City’s challenged \nenforcement of the ordinances “applies equally to all class \nmembers.”    The  district  court’s  commonality  and  Rule \n23(b)(2) analyses are both flawed because they are based on \nan incorrect understanding of our decision in Martin. \nAs the earlier discussion of Martin makes clear, the \nEighth Amendment theory adopted in that case requires an \nindividualized  inquiry  in  order  to  assess  whether  any \nindividuals to whom the challenged ordinances are being \napplied  “do  have  access  to  adequate  temporary  shelter, \nwhether because they have the means to pay for it or because \nit is realistically available to them for free, but who choose \nnot to use it.”  920 F.3d at 617 n.8.  See supra at 55–57.  Only \nwhen persons “do not have a single place where they can \nlawfully be,” can it be said that an ordinance against sleeping \nor  camping  in  public,  “as  applied  to  them,  effectively \npunish[es] them for something for which they may not be \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 71 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  71 \n \nconvicted  under  the  Eighth  Amendment.”    Id.  at 617 \n(simplified) (emphasis added). \nOf  course,  such  an  individualized  inquiry  is  not \nrequired—and no Eighth Amendment violation occurs under \nMartin—when the defendant can show that there is adequate \nshelter  space  to  house  all  homeless  persons  in  the \njurisdiction.  Id.  But the converse is not true—the mere fact \nthat a city’s shelters are full does not by itself establish, \nwithout more, that any particular person who is sleeping in \npublic does “not have a single place where [he or she] can \nlawfully be.”  Id.  The logic of Martin, and of the opinions \nin Powell on which it is based, requires an assessment of a \nperson’s individual situation before it can be said that the \nEighth  Amendment  would  be  violated  by  applying  a \nparticular provision against that person.  Indeed, the opinions \nin  Powell  on  which  Martin  relied—Justice  White’s \nconcurring  opinion  and  the  opinion  of  the  dissenting \nJustices—all agreed that, at most, the Eighth Amendment \nprovided  a  case-specific  affirmative  defense  that  would \nrequire the defendant to provide a “satisfactor[y] showing \nthat it was not feasible for him to have made arrangements” \nto avoid the conduct at issue.  Powell, 392 U.S. at 552 \n(White, J., concurring); id. at 568 n.31 (Fortas, J., dissenting) \n(agreeing with Justice White that the issue is whether the \ndefendant “on the occasion in question” had shown that \navoiding the conduct was “impossible”); see also  supra \nat 53.9 \n \n9 The majority incorrectly contends that the dissenters in Powell did \nnot endorse Justice White’s conclusion that the defendant bears the \nburden to establish that his or her conduct was involuntary.  See Opin. \nat 42–45.  On the contrary, the Powell dissenters’ entire argument rested \non the affirmative “constitutional defense” presented at the trial in that \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 72 of 86\n72  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nIn light of this understanding of Martin, the district court \nclearly erred in finding that the requirement of commonality \nwas met here.  “What matters to class certification is not the \nraising of common ‘questions’—even in droves—but rather, \nthe capacity of a class-wide proceeding to generate common \nanswers  apt  to  drive  the  resolution  of  the  litigation.  \nDissimilarities within the proposed class are what have the \npotential to impede the generation of common answers.”  \nWal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350 (simplified).  Under Martin, the \nanswer to the question whether the City’s enforcement of \neach of the anti-camping ordinances violates the Eighth \nAmendment turns on the individual circumstances of each \nperson to whom the ordinance is being applied on a given \noccasion.    That  question  is  simply  not  one  that  can  be \nresolved, on a common basis, “in one stroke.”  Id.  That \nrequires decertification. \nFor  similar  reasons,  the  district  court  also  erred  in \nconcluding that the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) were met.  \nBy  its  terms,  Rule  23(b)(2)  is  satisfied  only  if  (1) the \n \ncase and on the findings made by the trial court in connection with that \ndefense.  See 392 U.S. at 558 (Fortas, J., dissenting).  The majority’s \nsuggestion that I have taken that explicit reference to Powell’s defense \n“out of context,” see Opin. at 42 n.29, is demonstrably wrong—the \ncontext of the case was precisely the extensive affirmative defense that \nPowell presented at trial, including the testimony of an expert.  See id. \nat 517–26 (plurality) (summarizing the testimony).  And, of course, in \nMartin, the issue was raised in the context of a § 1983 action in which \nthe  plaintiffs  challenging  the  laws  bore  the  burden  to  prove  the \ninvoluntariness of their relevant conduct.  The majority points to nothing \nthat would plausibly support the view that Powell and Martin might \nrequire the government to carry the burden to establish voluntariness.  \nSee Opin. at 44 n.31 (leaving this issue open).  The majority claims that \nit can sidestep this issue here, but that is also wrong: the burden issue is \ncritical  both  to  the  class-certification  analysis  and  to  the  issue  of \nsummary judgment on the merits.  See infra at 72–82. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 73 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  73 \n \ndefendant has acted (or refused to act) on grounds that are \ngenerally applicable to the class as whole and (2) as a result, \nfinal classwide or injunctive relief is appropriate.  As the \nSupreme Court has observed, “[t]he key to the (b)(2) class is \n‘the  indivisible  nature  of  the  injunctive  or  declaratory \nremedy warranted—the notion that the conduct is such that \nit can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the \nclass members or as to none of them.’”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. \nat  360.    It  follows  that,  when  the  wrongfulness  of  the \nchallenged  conduct  with  respect  to  any  particular  class \nmember  depends  critically  upon  the  individual \ncircumstances of that class member, a class action under \nRule 23(b)(2) is not appropriate.  In such a case, in which \n(for example) the challenged enforcement of a particular law \nmay be lawful as to some persons and not as to others, \ndepending upon their individual circumstances, the all-or-\nnothing determination of wrongfulness that is the foundation \nof a (b)(2) class is absent: in such a case, it is simply not true \nthat the defendant’s “conduct is such that it can be enjoined \nor declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or \nas to none of them.’”  Id. (emphasis added). \nBecause Martin requires an assessment of each person’s \nindividual  circumstances  in  order  to  determine  whether \napplication of the challenged ordinances violates the Eighth \nAmendment, these standards for the application of Rule \n23(b)(2) were plainly not met in this case.  That is, because \nthe applicable law governing Plaintiffs’ claims would entail \n“a  process  through  which  highly  individualized \ndeterminations  of  liability  and  remedy  are  made,” \ncertification of a class under Rule 23(b)(2) is improper.  \nJamie S. v. Milwaukee Pub. Sch., 668 F.3d 481, 499 (7th Cir. \n2012).  Moreover, the mere fact that the district court’s final \njudgment  imposes  sweeping  across-the-board  injunctive \nrelief that disregards individual differences in determining \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 74 of 86\n74  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nthe defendant’s liability does not mean that Rule 23(b)(2) \nhas been satisfied.  The rule requires that any such classwide \nrelief be rooted in a determination of classwide liability—\nthe defendant must have acted, or be acting, unlawfully “on \ngrounds  that  apply  generally  to  the  class,  so  that  final \ninjunctive or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate \nrespecting the class as a whole.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(2) \n(emphasis added).  That requirement was not established \nhere, and the class must be decertified.10 \nB \nThe majority provides two responses to this analysis, but \nboth of them are wrong. \nFirst, the majority contends that Martin established a \nbright-line  rule  that  “the  government  cannot  prosecute \nhomeless people for sleeping in public”—or, presumably, \nfor camping—“if there ‘is a greater number of homeless \nindividuals in [a jurisdiction] than the number of available’ \nshelter spaces.”  See Opin. at 13 (quoting Martin, 920 F.3d \nat  617).    Because,  according  to  the  majority,  Martin \nestablishes a simple “formula” for determining when all \nenforcement of anti-camping and anti-sleeping ordinances \n \n10 The majority wrongly concludes that the City has forfeited any \nargument  concerning  Rule  23(b)(2)  because  it  did  not  specifically \nmention that subdivision of the rule in its opening brief.  Opin. at 34.  \nThis “Simon Says” approach to reading briefs is wrong.  The substance \nof the argument is contained in the opening brief, in which the City \nexplicitly  contended  that  Martin  requires  “a  more  individualized \nanalysis” than the district court applied and that, as a result, “neither FED. \nR. CIV. P. 23 nor Martin provide plaintiffs the ability to establish the type \nof sweeping class-wide claims advanced in this case.”  Indeed, Plaintiffs \nthemselves responded to this argument, in their answering brief, by \nexplaining why they believe that the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) were \nmet. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 75 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  75 \n \nmust cease, it presents a common question that may be \nresolved on a classwide basis.  See Opin. at 13; see also \nOpin. at 28–29, 31.  As the above analysis makes clear, the \nmajority’s premise is incorrect.  Martin states that, if there \nare insufficient available beds at shelters, then a jurisdiction \n“cannot prosecute homeless individuals for ‘involuntarily \nsitting, lying, and sleeping in public.’”  920 F.3d at 617 \n(emphasis added).  The lack of adequate shelter beds thus \nmerely eliminates a safe-harbor that might otherwise have \nallowed  a  jurisdiction  to  prosecute  violations  of  such \nordinances without regard to individual circumstances, with \nthe result  that the  jurisdiction’s enforcement power will \ninstead depend upon whether the conduct of the individual \non a particular occasion was “involuntar[y].”  Id.  Martin \nconfirms that the resulting inquiry turns on whether the \npersons in question “do have access to adequate temporary \nshelter, whether because they have the means to pay for it or \nbecause it is realistically available to them for free, but who \nchoose not to use it.”  Id. at 617 n.8; see also id. at 617 \n(stating that enforcement is barred only if the persons in \nquestion “do not have a single place where they can lawfully \nbe” (citation omitted)).  And the majority’s misreading of \nMartin completely disregards the Powell opinions on which \nMartin  relied,  which  make  unmistakably  clear  that  an \nindividualized showing of involuntariness is required. \nSecond, the majority states that, to the extent that Martin \nrequires  such  an  individualized  showing  to  establish  an \nEighth Amendment violation, any such individualized issue \nhere has been eliminated by the fact that “[p]ursuant to the \nclass  definition,  the  class  includes  only  involuntarily \nhomeless persons.”  See Opin. at 31–33.  As the majority \nacknowledges, “[p]ersons are involuntarily homeless” under \nMartin  only  “if  they  do  not  ‘have  access  to  adequate \ntemporary shelter,’” such as, for example, when they lack \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 76 of 86\n76  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \n“‘the  means  to  pay  for  it’”  and  it  is  otherwise  not \n“‘realistically available to them for free.’”  Opin. at 8 n.2 \n(quoting  Martin,  920  F.3d  at  617  n.8).    Because  that \nindividualized  issue  has  been  shifted  into  the  class \ndefinition, the majority holds, the City’s enforcement of the \nchallenged ordinances against that class can in that sense be \nunderstood to present a “common question” that can be \nresolved in one stroke.  According to the majority, because \nthe class definition requires that, at the time the ordinances \nare  applied  against  them,  the  class  members  must  be \n“involuntarily homeless” in the sense that Martin requires, \nthere  is  a  common  question  as  to  whether  “the  City’s \nenforcement  of  the  anti-camping  ordinances  against  all \ninvoluntarily  homeless  individuals  violates  the  Eighth \nAmendment.”  See Opin. at 31–33 & n.22. \nThe  majority  cites  no  authority  for  this  audacious \nbootstrap argument.  If a person’s individual circumstances \nare such that he or she has no “access to adequate temporary \nshelter”—which necessarily subsumes (among other things) \nthe determination that there are no shelter beds available—\nthen the entire (highly individualized) question of the City’s \nliability to that person under Martin’s standards has been \nshifted into the class definition.  That is wholly improper.  \nSee Olean Wholesale Grocery Coop. v. Bumble Bee Foods, \n31 F.4th 651, 670 n.14 (9th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (“A court \nmay not . . . create a ‘fail safe’ class that is defined to include \nonly those individuals who were injured by the allegedly \nunlawful  conduct.”);  see  also  Ruiz  Torres  v.  Mercer \nCanyons Inc., 835 F.3d 1125, 1138 n.7 (9th Cir. 2016) \n(stating that it would be improper to define a class in such a \nway “as to preclude membership unless the liability of the \ndefendant is established” (simplified)). \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 77 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  77 \n \nThe majority nonetheless insists that “[m]embership in \nthe class” here “has no connection to the success of the \nunderlying claims.”  See Opin. at 32 n.23.  That is obviously \nfalse.  As I have explained, Martin’s understanding of when \na person “involuntarily” lacks “access to adequate temporary \nshelter” or to “a single place where [he or she] can lawfully \nbe,” see 920 F.3d at 617 & n.8 (citations omitted), requires \nan  individualized  inquiry  into  a  given  person’s \ncircumstances at a particular moment.  By insisting that a \ncommon  question  exists  here  because  Martin’s \ninvoluntariness  standard  has  been  folded  into  the  class \ndefinition, the majority is unavoidably relying on a fail-safe \nclass  definition  that  improperly  subsumes  this  crucial \nindividualized merits issue into the class definition.  The \nmajority’s artifice renders the limitations of Rule 23 largely \nillusory.11 \nTo the extent that the majority instead suggests that the \nclass definition requires only an involuntary lack of access \nto regular or permanent shelter to qualify as “involuntarily \n \n11 The majority contends that, despite the presence of a liability-\ndetermining individualized issue in the class definition, there is no fail-\nsafe class here because one or more of the claims might still conceivably \nfail on the merits for other reasons.  See Opin. at 32 n.23.  But the \nmajority does not identify any such other reasons and, of course, under \nthe majority’s view of the substantive law, there are none.  But more \nimportantly, the majority is simply wrong in positing that the only type \nof class that would qualify as an impermissible fail-safe class is one in \nwhich every conceivable merits issue in the litigation has been folded \ninto the class definition.  What matters is whether the class definition \nfolds within it any bootstrapping merits issue (such as the “injur[y]” issue \nmentioned in Olean) as to which “a class member either wins or, by \nvirtue of losing, is defined out of the class and is therefore not bound by \nthe judgment.”  Olean, 31 F.4th at 670 n.14.  To the extent that the central \nindividualized merits issue in this case has been folded into the class \ndefinition, that defect is present here. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 78 of 86\n78  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nhomeless,” its argument collapses for a different reason.  \nBecause Martin’s Eighth Amendment holding applies only \nto  those  who  involuntarily  lack  “access  to  adequate \ntemporary shelter” on a given occasion, see 920 F.3d at 617 \nn.8, such an understanding of the class definition would not \nbe sufficient to eliminate the highly individualized inquiry \ninto whether a particular person lacked such access at a given \nmoment, and the class would then have to be decertified for \nthe reasons I have discussed earlier.  See supra at 69–74.  Put \nsimply, the majority cannot have it both ways: either the \nclass  definition  is  co-extensive  with  Martin’s \ninvoluntariness  concept  (in  which  case  the  class  is  an \nimproper fail-safe class) or the class definition differs from \nthe Martin standard (in which case Martin’s individualized \ninquiry requires decertification). \nIV \nGiven  these  conclusions  as  to  standing  and  class \ncertification, all that remains are the individual claims of \nJohnson for prospective relief against enforcement of the \ntwo anti-camping ordinances.  In my view, these claims fail \nas a matter of law. \nJohnson’s sole basis for challenging these ordinances is \nthat they prohibit her from sleeping in her van within the \nCity.  In her declaration in support of class certification, \nhowever, Johnson specifically stated that she has “often” \nbeen able to sleep in her van by parking outside the City \nlimits.  In a supplemental declaration in support of summary \njudgment, she affirmed that these facts “remain true,” but \nshe added that there had also been occasions in which, \noutside the City limits, county officers had told her to “move \non” when she “was parked on county roads” and that, when \nshe  parked  “on  BLM  land”—i.e.,  land  managed  by  the \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 79 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  79 \n \nfederal Bureau of Land Management—she was told that she \n“could only stay on BLM for a few days.” \nAs an initial matter, Johnson’s declaration provides no \nnon-conclusory basis for finding that she lacks any option \nother than sleeping in her van.  Although her declaration \nnotes that she worked as a nurse “for decades” and that she \nnow collects social security benefits, the declaration simply \nstates, without saying anything further about her present \neconomic situation, that she “cannot afford housing.”  Her \ndeclaration also says nothing about where she lived before \nshe began living “on the street” a few years ago, and it says \nnothing about whether she has any friends or family, in \nGrants Pass or elsewhere, who might be able to provide \nassistance.12  And even assuming that this factual showing \nwould be sufficient to permit a trier of fact to find that \nJohnson lacks any realistic option other than sleeping in her \nvan, we cannot affirm the district court’s summary judgment \nin Johnson’s favor without holding that her showing was so \noverwhelming that she should prevail as a matter of law.  \nBecause a reasonable trier of fact could find, in light of these \nevidentiary gaps, that Johnson failed to carry her burden of \n \n12 The majority dismisses these questions about the sufficiency of \nJohnson’s evidentiary showing as “artificial limitations” on claims under \nMartin, see Opin. at 44, but the standard for establishing an Eighth \nAmendment violation under Martin and the Powell opinions on which it \nrelies is a demanding and individualized one, and we are obligated to \nfollow  it.    Indeed,  in  upholding  Powell’s  conviction  for  public \ndrunkenness, the controlling opinion of Justice White probed the details \nof the record as to whether, in light of the fact that Powell “had a home \nand wife,” he could have “made plans while sober to prevent ending up \nin a public place,” and whether, despite his chronic alcoholism, he \n“retained the power to stay off or leave the streets, and simply preferred \nto be there rather than elsewhere.”  392 U.S. at 553. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 80 of 86\n80  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nproof on this preliminary point, summary judgment in her \nfavor was improper.13 \nBut even assuming that Johnson had established that she \ntruly  has  no  option  other  than  sleeping  in  her  van,  her \nshowing  is  still  insufficient  to  establish  an  Eighth \nAmendment violation.  As noted, Johnson’s sole complaint \nin this case is that, by enforcing the anti-camping ordinances, \nthe City will not let her sleep in her van.  But the sparse facts \nshe  has  presented  fail  to  establish  that  she  lacks  any \nalternative place where she could park her van and sleep in \nit.  On the contrary, her factual showing establishes that the \nBLM will let her do so on BLM land for a “few days” at a \ntime and that she also has “often” been able to do so on \ncounty  land.    Given  that  Johnson  has  failed  to  present \nsufficient evidence to show that she lacks alternatives that \nwould allow her to avoid violating the City’s anti-camping \nordinances, she has not established that the conduct for \nwhich the City would punish her is involuntary such that, \nunder Martin and the Powell opinions on which Martin \nrelies, it would violate the Eighth Amendment to enforce that \nprohibition against her. \n \n13 The majority errs by instead counting all gaps in the evidentiary \nrecord against the City, faulting it for what the majority thinks the City \nhas failed to “demonstrate[],”  See Opin. at 45 & n.32.  That is contrary \nto well-settled law.  See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 \n(1986) (holding that a movant’s summary judgment motion should be \ngranted “against a [nonmovant] who fails to make a showing sufficient \nto establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and \non which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial”).  The \nmajority’s analysis also belies its implausible claim that it has not shifted \nthe burden to the City to establish the voluntariness of the behavior \ntargeted by the ordinances.  See supra at 71 n.9. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 81 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  81 \n \nIn nonetheless finding that the anti-camping ordinances’ \nprohibition  on  sleeping  in  vehicles  violates  the  Eighth \nAmendment, the majority apparently relies on the premise \nthat the question of whether an individual has options for \navoiding violations of the challenged law must be limited to \nalternatives that are within the City limits.  Under this view, \nif a large homeless shelter with 1,000 vacant beds were \nopened a block outside the City’s limits, the City would still \nbe required by the Eighth Amendment to allow hundreds of \npeople to sleep in their vans in the City and, presumably, in \nthe City’s public parks as well.  Nothing in law or logic \nsupports such a conclusion.  Martin says that anti-sleeping \nordinances  may  be  enforced,  consistent  with  the  Eighth \nAmendment, so long as there is a “single place where [the \nperson] can lawfully be,” 920 F.2d at 617 (emphasis added) \n(citation  omitted),  and  Justice  White’s  concurrence  in \nPowell confirms that the Eighth Amendment does not bar \nenforcement of a law when the defendant has failed to show \nthat avoiding the violative conduct is “impossible,” 392 U.S. \nat 551 (emphasis added).14  Nothing in the rationale of this \nEighth Amendment theory suggests that the inquiry into \nwhether  it  is  “impossible”  for  the  defendant  to  avoid \nviolating the law must be artificially constrained to only \nthose particular options that suit the defendant’s geographic \nor other preferences.  To be sure, Johnson states that having \nto drive outside the City limits costs her money for gas, but \nthat does not provide any basis for concluding that the option \nis infeasible or that she has thereby suffered “cruel and \nunusual punishment.” \n \n14 The majority complains that this standard is too high, see Opin. \nat 45, but it is the standard applied in Martin and in the Powell opinions \non which Martin relied. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 82 of 86\n82  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \nFinally,  because  the  district  court’s  reliance  on  the \nExcessive Fines Clause was predicated on the comparable \nview that the challenged ordinances punish “status and not \nconduct” in violation of Robinson, that ruling was flawed for \nthe same reasons.  And because Johnson provides no other \nbasis for  finding an Excessive  Fines violation  here, her \nclaims under that clause also fail as a matter of law. \nV \nAccordingly, I would remand this case with instructions \n(1) to dismiss as moot the claims of Debra Blake as well as \nPlaintiffs’ claims with respect to GPMC § 6.46.355; (2) to \ndismiss the claims of John Logan for lack of Article III \nstanding;  (3) to  dismiss  the  remaining  claims  of  Gloria \nJohnson for lack of Article III standing, except to the extent \nthat she challenges the two anti-camping ordinances (GPMC \n§§ 5.61.030, 6.46.090); (4) to decertify the class; and (5) to \ngrant summary judgment to the City, and against Johnson, \nwith respect to her challenges to the City’s anti-camping \nordinances  under  the  Eighth  Amendment’s  Cruel  and \nUnusual Punishments Clause and Excessive Fines Clause.  \nThat disposes of all claims at issue, and I therefore need not \nreach  any  of  the  many  additional  issues  discussed  and \ndecided by the majority’s opinion or raised by the parties.15 \n \n15 Two of the majority’s expansions of Martin nonetheless warrant \nspecial mention.  First, the majority’s decision goes well beyond Martin \nby holding that the Eighth Amendment precludes enforcement of anti-\ncamping ordinances against those who involuntarily lack access to \ntemporary shelter, if those ordinances deny such persons the use of \nwhatever materials they need “to keep themselves warm and dry.”  See \nOpin. at 39.  It seems unavoidable that this newly declared right to the \nnecessary “materials to keep warm and dry” while sleeping in public \nparks must include the right to use (at least) a tent; it is hard to see how \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 83 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  83 \n \nVI \nUp to this point, I have faithfully adhered to Martin and \nits understanding of Powell, as I am obligated to do.  See \nMiller v. Gammie, 335 F.3d 889, 899–900 (9th Cir. 2003) \n(en banc).  But given the importance of the issues at stake, \nand the gravity of Martin’s errors, I think it appropriate to \nconclude by noting my general agreement with many of the \npoints  made  by  my  colleagues  who  dissented  from  our \nfailure to rehear Martin en banc. \nIn  particular,  I  agree  that,  by  combining  dicta  in  a \nconcurring  opinion  with  a  dissent,  the  panel  in  Martin \nplainly misapplied Marks’ rule that “[w]hen a fragmented \nCourt decides a case and no single rationale explaining the \nresult enjoys the assent of five Justices, ‘the holding of the \nCourt  may  be  viewed  as  that  position  taken  by  those \nMembers who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest \n \nelse one would keep “warm and dry” in a downpour.  And the majority \nalso raises, and leaves open, the possibility that the City’s prohibition on \nthe use of other “items necessary to facilitate sleeping outdoors”—such \nas “stoves,” “fires,” and makeshift “structures”—“may or may not be \npermissible.”  See Opin. at 38–39, 47.  Second, the majority indirectly \nextends Martin’s holding from the strictly criminal context at issue in \nthat case to civil citations and fines.  See Opin. at 35–38.  As the district \ncourt noted below, the parties vigorously debated the extent to which a \n“violation” qualifies as a crime under Oregon law.  The majority, \nhowever, sidesteps that issue by instead treating it as irrelevant.  The \nmajority’s theory is that, even assuming arguendo that violations of the \nanti-camping ordinances are only civil in nature, they are covered by \nMartin because such violations later could lead (after more conduct by \nthe defendant) to criminal fines, see Opin. at 38.  But the majority does \nnot follow the logic of its own theory, because it has not limited its \nholding  or  remedy  to  the  enforcement  of  the  ultimate  criminal \nprovisions; on the contrary, the majority has enjoined any relevant \nenforcement  of  the  underlying  ordinances  that  contravenes  the \nmajority’s understanding of Martin.  See Opin. at 49. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 84 of 86\n84  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n \ngrounds.’”    430  U.S.  at  193  (emphasis  added)  (citation \nomitted).  Under a correct application of Marks, the holding \nof  Powell  is  that  there  is  no  constitutional  obstacle  to \npunishing conduct that has not been shown to be involuntary, \nand the converse question of what rule applies when the \nconduct has been shown to be involuntary was left open.  See \nMartin, 920 F.3d at 590–93 (M. Smith, J., dissenting from \ndenial of rehearing en banc) (explaining that, under a proper \napplication of Marks, “‘there is definitely no Supreme Court \nholding’  prohibiting  the  criminalization  of  involuntary \nconduct” (citation omitted)). \nMoreover, the correct answer to the question left open in \nPowell was the one provided in Justice Marshall’s plurality \nopinion  in  that  case:  there  is  no  federal  “constitutional \ndoctrine of criminal responsibility.”  392 U.S. at 534.  In \nlight of the “centuries-long evolution of the collection of \ninterlocking and overlapping concepts which the common \nlaw has utilized to assess the moral accountability of an \nindividual for his antisocial deeds,” including the “doctrines \nof actus reus, mens rea, insanity, mistake, justification, and \nduress,” the “process of adjustment” of “the tension between \nthe evolving aims of the criminal law and changing religious, \nmoral, philosophical, and medical views of the nature of \nman” is a matter that the Constitution leaves within “the \nprovince of the States” or of Congress.  Id. at 535–36.  \n“There is simply no indication in the history of the Eighth \nAmendment that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause \nwas intended to reach the substantive authority of Congress \nto  criminalize  acts  or  status,  and  certainly  not  before \nconviction,”  and  the  later  incorporation  of  that  clause’s \nprotections  vis-à-vis  the  States  in  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment “worked no change in its meaning.”  Martin, \n920  F.3d  at  602  (Bennett,  J.,  dissenting  from  denial  of \nrehearing en banc);  see also id. at 599 (explaining that \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 85 of 86\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS  85 \n \nMartin’s  novel  holding  was  inconsistent  with  the  “text, \ntradition, and original public meaning[] [of] the Cruel and \nUnusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment”).  \nConsequently, so long as “the accused has committed some \nact, has engaged in some behavior, which society has an \ninterest in preventing, or perhaps in historical common law \nterms,  has  committed  some  actus  reus,”  the  Eighth \nAmendment  principles  applied  in  Robinson  have  been \nsatisfied.  Powell, 392 U.S. at 533 (plurality).  The Eighth \nAmendment does not preclude punishing such an act merely \n“because it is, in some sense, ‘involuntary’ or ‘occasioned \nby a compulsion.’”  Id.; see also Martin, 920 F.3d at 592 n.3 \n(M. Smith, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) \n(“Powell does not prohibit the criminalization of involuntary \nconduct.”). \nFurther, it is hard to deny that Martin has “generate[d] \ndire  practical  consequences  for  the  hundreds  of  local \ngovernments within our jurisdiction, and for the millions of \npeople  that  reside  therein.”    Id.  at  594  (M.  Smith,  J., \ndissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  Those harms, \nof  course,  will  be  greatly  magnified  by  the  egregiously \nflawed  reconceptualization  and  extension  of  Martin’s \nholding in today’s decision, and by the majority’s equally \ntroubling reworking of settled class-action principles.  With \nno sense of irony, the majority declares that no such harms \nare demonstrated by the record in this case, even as the \nmajority largely endorses an injunction effectively requiring \nGrants Pass to allow the use of its public parks as homeless \nencampments.  Other cities in this circuit can be expected to \nsuffer a similar fate. \nIn view of all of the foregoing, both Martin and today’s \ndecision should be overturned or overruled at the earliest \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 138    Filed 09/28/22    Page 86 of 86\n86  JOHNSON V.

Having \nreviewed all of the pleadings on those motions, having certified a class on August 7, 2019, \ndefined as “all involuntarily homeless individuals living in Grants Pass, Oregon, including \nhomeless individuals who sometimes sleep outside city limits to avoid harassment and \npunishment by Defendant as addressed in this lawsuit,” and for the reasons as explained in the \nCourt’s Opinion and Order (#111) dated July 22, 2020, the Court grants plaintiffs’ motion for \nPage 1 of 3 JUDGMENT \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 114    Filed 08/26/20    Page 2 of 3\nsummary judgment in part and denies it in part and denies defendant’s motion for summary \njudgment. Plaintiffs have since voluntarily dismissed their equal protection and substantive due \nprocess claims, which remained unresolved by this Court’s July 22, 2020 Opinion and Order. \nBased upon these proceedings, the court enters the following judgment. \n1.  Grants Pass Municipal Code (GPMC) 6.46.355 fails to provide individuals excluded \nfrom Grants Pass parks with adequate procedural due process;  \nAs applied to the Plaintiff class:  \n2.   As detailed in the Court’s Order and Opinion, Defendants’ enforcement of GPMC \n5.61.020, 5.61.030, and 6.46.090 violates the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and \nunusual punishment;  \n3.   As detailed in the Court’s Order and Opinion, defendants’ enforcement of GPMC \n5.61.020, 5.61.030, and 6.46.090 violates the Eighth Amendment prohibition against excessive fines;  \n4.  Based upon the above determinations, the Court enjoins Defendant from enforcing \nCity Ordinances against the plaintiff class as follows:  \na. Defendant is enjoined from enforcing GPMC 6.46.350 (the park exclusion \nordinance);  \nb. Defendant is enjoined from enforcing GPMC 5.61.030 and GPMC 6.46.090 (the \ncamping ordinances) without first giving a person a warning of at least 24 hours before \nenforcement;  \nc. Defendant is enjoined from enforcing GPMC 5.61.030, GPMC 6.46.090 (the \ncamping ordinances) and GPMC 5.57.020(A) (criminal trespassing on city property related to \nparks) from 9:00 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. during the months of April through September and from \n7:00 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. during the months of October to March, in all City parks with the \nexception of Reinhart Volunteer Park located at 1690 SW Webster Rd. The Court’s \ninjunction does not apply to the Reinhart Volunteer Park, which the parties have agreed has \nPage 2 of 3 JUDGMENT \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 114    Filed 08/26/20    Page 3 of 3\nunique uses and leaves class members with sufficient alternatives, making this exception \nappropriate.  \n5.

The City of Grants Pass is trying to run homeless people out of town.  On any given day \nor night, hundreds of individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon are forced to live outside due to the lack \n \n1 – THIRD AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  \n\nof emergency shelter and affordable housing in their community.  The most recent “point in \ntime” count in Josephine County found 654 individuals on the street and another 1011 \nindividuals precariously housed for a total of 1754 people who are homeless or at immediate risk \nof homelessness.  These numbers have risen since that count in 2017.  This year, Grants Pass \nSchool District #7 reported 513 homeless youth enrolled in the District, the tenth most in the \nstate.  Grants Pass has a severe affordable housing shortage and no emergency shelter for \nhomeless people.  The people living outside in Grants Pass have nowhere else to go.  Like all \npeople, they require a place to rest, sleep, stay warm, and stay alive.  \n2.  Over a period of years, the City of Grants Pass has taken coordinated steps to drive \nhomeless people out of town.  The City has refused to allow warming stations in the winter \n(which are very cold), and cooling stations in the summer (which are very hot and increasingly \nsmoky).  The City has removed park benches from its parks.   The City has paid one-way bus \nfare for homeless people to leave town.  The City has driven people to Jackson County.  One city \ncouncilor stated in a city council meeting, “the point is to make it uncomfortable enough for \nthem [homeless people] in our city so they will want to move on down the road.”  At the same \ntime, city council has voted against affordable housing in the City and has failed to take steps to \ncreate a low-barrier emergency shelter for the hundreds of homeless people who live in the City.   \n3.  Grants Pass has a web of ordinances, customs, policies and practices that, in combination, \npunish and criminalize the existence of homeless people in Grants Pass.  When people are found \nsleeping outside (whether in a vehicle or not) they are awakened by police, ordered to move \nalong, excluded from parks, often ticketed, ordered to appear in court, criminally fined and \nprosecuted for “illegal sleeping,” “illegal camping” and criminal trespass.  When homeless \npeople are sitting or resting in public spaces with a blanket or tarp for warmth or in their vehicle, \n \n2 – THIRD AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  \n\nthey are ordered to move-along, threatened with ticketing, ticketed, fined and arrested for illegal \ncamping, illegal sleeping or criminal trespass.  Grants Pass’ customs, policies and practices, as \napplied to involuntarily homeless individuals, violate the constitutional rights to be free from \ncruel and unusual punishment and excessive fines, to due process of law, and to equal protection \nof the laws, secured by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Plaintiffs seek prospective \ninjunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to 42 USC § 1983.  Plaintiffs bring this action for \nthemselves and on behalf of all similarly situated persons pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Plaintiffs ask this court to enjoin defendant from taking law \nenforcement action against plaintiffs for sleeping or simply existing in Grants Pass unless and \nuntil the City provides a lawful place for people to rest, sleep and find shelter.   \nI. JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4.  Jurisdiction exists for the claim pursuant to 28 USC §§ 1331 (federal question) and 1343 \n(civil rights) in that plaintiffs’ claims arise under 42 USC § 1983. Venue is proper in the District \nof Oregon pursuant to 28 USC § 1391(b)(2) because the City of Grants Pass is in this district and \nthe events giving rise to plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this district.  \nII. PARTIES \n5.   Plaintiff Debra Blake is and was at all relevant times an involuntarily homeless resident \nof Grants Pass, Oregon.   \n6.  Plaintiff Gloria Johnson is and was at all relevant times an involuntarily homeless \nresident of Grants Pass, Oregon.  \n7.  Plaintiff John Logan is and was at all relevant times an involuntarily homeless resident of \nGrants Pass, Oregon. \n \n3 – THIRD AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  \n\n8.  Defendant City of Grants Pass is a municipal corporation duly organized and existing \nunder the laws of the State of Oregon.  The acts of defendant complained of were undertaken in \nthe execution of customs, policies, and practices implemented or consented to by authorized \npolicymakers of the City of Grants Pass.  The acts complained of were intentionally committed, \nare ongoing, and will continue to be systematically committed unless restrained by this Court. \nIII. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.    Grants Pass’ Affordable Housing Crisis and Lack of Emergency Shelter \n9.  Grants Pass is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis.  There is not nearly enough \naffordable housing to house all of the low-income residents of Grants Pass.  In 2017, the Point-\nin-Time Count of homeless people in Josephine County found 654 individuals on the street and \nanother 1011 individuals precariously housed for a total of 1754 people who are homeless or at \nimmediate risk of homelessness.  The majority of these people reside in Grants Pass, the \ncounty’s largest city, and these numbers have increased since 2017. The Grants Pass School \nDistrict #7 currently has 531 homeless students enrolled.   \n10.   Grants Pass residents spend on average 27.1% of their income on housing. This is the \nthird highest rate in the nation. Only Santa Cruz, CA (30%) and Miami, FL (29.7%) have higher \nrates. \n11.  Unlike other comparably sized cities in Oregon, Grants Pass has no emergency shelter for \nhomeless individuals.  There is no place in Grants Pass where people can simply show up and \nreceive shelter during the day or night.   \n12.   The only shelters for adults in Grants Pass are run by the Gospel Rescue Mission.  These \nshelters are nearly always full, they only allow people to stay for a limited duration, and they \nhave many rules that exclude large numbers of people.  They require people to be able-bodied \n \n4 – THIRD AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  \n\nand to work for 40 hours a week without pay.  There are no shelters at all for couples or for men \nwith children.   \n13.  Stays at the Gospel Mission are limited to 30 days. The rules of the Mission run for \nseveral pages and include the following: \n  “If you have serious or chronic medical or mental issues that prevent you from \nparticipating in daily Mission life, you may not be able to stay at the Mission.” \n  “Medications must be turned in at the front desk.” \n  “You are to remain nicotine free during your stay at the Mission.”   \n  “There is no socializing between members of the opposite sex except at approved \nMission events.  Treat one another as a brother and/or sister.  All intimate relationships other \nthan legal/biblical marriage, regardless of gender, either on or off Mission property are strictly \nforbidden.”   \n  “Taking a sick day will result in losing pass privileges for 72 hours and confinement to \nstaying indoors during this time to insure a thorough recovery from illness.”   \n  “Every Sunday, you are required to attend a church approved by the Mission staff.  The \nindividual church is your choice, however it must hold to traditional Christian teachings such as \nthe Apostles Creed.”    \n14.  Residents are not allowed to look for work outside the Mission during their 30 days there.   \n15.  Even if these shelters were lower-barrier, there would not be nearly enough beds to \nshelter all of the homeless people in Grants Pass.  In total, there are 30 beds in a dorm for single \nmen, four bunk rooms for single women and twelve rooms for mothers with up to four children.   \n16.  The County in which Grants Pass is located, Josephine, has in recent months taken steps \nin a different direction than the City of Grants Pass.  Josephine County’s Board of \n \n5 – THIRD AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  \n\nCommissioners declared a countywide affordable housing crisis in November of 2017.  The \nCounty took steps to legalize more nonconventional housing units and camping in some \ncircumstances.  Then Mayor of Grants Pass, Darin Fowler, publicly expressed opposition to \nthese measures.   \n17.    Grants Pass has no Public Housing and the wait list for a Section 8 voucher is long.  If a \nperson is lucky enough to get a voucher in Josephine County there is only a 22% utilization rate.  \nIn short, it is hard to get a housing voucher and if a person gets one, there are very few places to \nuse it.   \nB.  Plaintiff Debra Blake \n18.  Plaintiff Debra Blake is involuntarily homeless and has been so for the past eight years.  \nShe has lived in Grants Pass for 15 years.  About eight years ago, she lost her job and her \nhousing and has been forced to live outside.   \n19.  Ms. Blake cannot afford housing and there is no available bed for her at an emergency \nshelter anywhere in Grants Pass.  \n20.  Ms. Blake, over the past seven years has been repeatedly told by Grants Pass police that \nshe must “move along” and that there is nowhere in Grants Pass that she can legally sit or rest. \nShe has been repeatedly awakened by Grants Pass police while sleeping and told that she needs \nto get up and move.  She has been told by Grants Pass police that she should leave town.   \n21.  Because she has no choice but to live outside and has no place else to go, Ms. Blake has \nfaced ticketing, fines and criminal prosecution.   \n22.  On July 1, 2014, at 6:20 a.m., Ms. Blake was cited for violating GPMC 5.61.020 for \nsleeping in an alley at 620 SE J Street in Grants Pass and was fined $35.  Ms. Blake is unable to \npay this fine, which because of late fees is now $109.   \n \n6 – THIRD AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  \n\n23.  On September 24, 2014 at 3:26 a.m., Ms. Blake was cited for violating GPMC 5.61.030 \nfor “prohibited camping” while sleeping at 311SE G Street in Grants Pass and was fined $295.  \nMs. Blake is unable to pay this fine, which because of late fees is now $503.   \n24.  On October 4, 2014, Ms. Blake was cited for violating GPMC 5.61.030 for “prohibited \ncamping” while sleeping at 431 NE D Street in Grants Pass and was fined $295.  Ms. Blake is \nunable to pay this fine, which because of late fees is now $503.    \n25.  On May 1, 2016, Ms. Blake was sleeping on private property located at 201 NE 8th Street \nin Grants Pass and was arrested and charged with Criminal Trespass in the Second Degree under \nORS 164.245, a Class C Misdemeanor.  She was convicted, fined $200 and placed on bench \nprobation for six months.  Ms. Blake is unable to pay this fine which because of late fees is now \n$416.   \n24.  On July 17, 2018, Ms. Blake was sleeping in Riverside Park in Grants Pass at 7:33 a.m.  \nShe was approached by a Grants Pass police officer and issued a citation for violating GPMC \n6.46.090 “Camping in Park” a violation that has a presumptive fine of $295.  On July 24, 2018, \nMs. Blake was again in or near Riverside Park.  She was arrested, taken into custody, cited for \nCriminal Trespass II, incarcerated and spent the night in jail before being released the next \nmorning.  Her release agreement contains the provision that Ms. Blake is to “have no contact \nwith All Grants Pass Parks.”  The Criminal Trespass II citation has yet to be charged.  She was \nfound guilty of the “Camping in Park” offense and her fine for this offense is now $537.60.    \n25.  Ms. Blake now owes the City of Grants Pass more than $2000 in fines for crimes and \nviolations related directly to her involuntary homelessness and the fact that there is no affordable \nhousing or emergency shelter in Grants Pass where Ms. Blake can stay.   \n \n7 – THIRD AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  \n\n26.  In January 2019, Ms. Blake was admitted into a 30-day treatment program as a condition \nof her release from jail.  She has nowhere to go once that program ends.  Once she is on the \nstreet again, she could be arrested, ticketed and prosecuted for sleeping outside or for covering \nherself with a blanket to stay warm.  She has no place else to go.   \nC.  Plaintiff Gloria Johnson \n27.  Plaintiff Gloria Johnson is 68 years old and is involuntarily homeless.  She has been \nhomeless for the past three years.  She has lived in Grants Pass for the past 12 years.    \n28.  Prior to retiring she was a nurse, for decades, in an ophthalmology office.  Ms. Johnson \nhas a limited fixed income from social security retirement and cannot afford housing and there is \nno available bed for her at an emergency shelter anywhere in Grants Pass. She lives with her \ndog, Echo, who helps her cope with the symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.  If she \ncould find shelter or housing that she could afford and live in with Echo she would move inside.   \n29.  Ms. Johnson owns a 2002 Dodge Grand Caravan van.  She sleeps in her van to stay out of \nthe elements.   \n30.    On October 12, 2017, Ms. Johnson was ticketed by Grants Pass police officers for \nviolating GPMC 6.46.090, “camping in parks” while in her van in an authorized parking spot in \nMorrison Park in Grants Pass at 9:21 a.m.  The police explanation on the ticket says, “Johnson \nwas found sleeping in her van with the curtains covering the. . . .” This explanation ends mid-\nsentence.  This offense carried a presumptive fine of $295.  It appears that the police officers \nnever filed this ticket with the Court, despite the ticket including a court appearance with a time \nand date.   \n31.  On February 19th, 2019 at about 9:30 A.M., Ms. Johnson was parked at Baker Park.  She \nwas in her van eating breakfast.  A Grants Pass police officer approached her in her van.  That \n \n8 – THIRD AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  \n\nofficer told her that a new ordinance was in effect and that she could not stay parked there for \nmore than two hours.  \n32.  Ms. Johnson, over the past three years has been repeatedly told, on dozens of occasions, \nby Grants Pass police that she must “move along” and that there is nowhere in Grants Pass that \nshe can legally park to sleep in her van.  She has been repeatedly awakened by Grants Pass \npolice while sleeping and told that she needs move her van or be ticketed for illegal sleeping or \ncamping and fined.  She has been told that it is illegal for her to sleep in her van anywhere in \nGrants Pass city limits and that she must leave town if she wants to sleep in her van.  \n33.  As a result, she often sleeps in her van at night just outside the Grants Pass city limits to \navoid being awakened and harassed by the police.  She comes into town each day for needed \nservices, including food for her and Echo.  If the Grants Pass police did not repeatedly harass her \nand threaten her with ticketing, she would sleep in her van at night in Grants Pass to save \nvaluable gas money and to avoid the hassle of constantly moving her van. \n34.  Because she has no choice but to live outside and has no place else to go, Ms. Johnson is \nat risk of ticketing, fines and criminal prosecution.   \n36.   Ms. Johnson continues to live without shelter in Grants Pass. At any time, she could be \narrested, ticketed and prosecuted for sleeping outside in her van or for covering herself with a \nblanket to stay warm.   \nD.   Plaintiff John Logan \n37.  Plaintiff John Logan is 60 years old and is currently involuntarily homeless. He has been \ninvoluntarily homeless in Grants Pass several times within the past 10 years.  \n38.  Mr. Logan was raised in Grants Pass, attended Grants Pass public schools, and has lived \nthe vast majority of his life in Grants Pass. \n \n9 – THIRD AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  \n\n39.  He first experienced homelessness about 10 years ago after losing his job. He \ninvoluntarily lived out of his truck on the streets in Grants Pass for about 4 years. \n40.  In 2015, Mr. Logan found housing with assistance from HUD’s Housing Choice Voucher \nprogram.  Unfortunatley, after three years of being housed, he recieved a no-cause notice of \ntermination and was forced to move from his residence.  He was unable to find replacement \nhousing and his Housing Choice Voucher expired.  \n41.  Mr. Logan has been awakened by City of Grants Pass police officers and told that the \ncannot sleep in his truck in the city, told there was no place to camp or sleep in his truck in the \ncity, and ordered to move on. \n42.  Mr. Logan has heard from other homeless persons that there is no where to camp or sleep \nin a vehicle in the city. \n43.   As a result, Mr. Logan usually sleeps in his truck just outside the Grants Pass city limits \nto avoid being awakened and harassed by the police. He comes into town each day to access \nservices. If there was some place in the city where Mr. Logan could legally sleep in his truck in \nthe city, he would because it would save valuable gas money and avoid the hassle of having to \nconstantly move.  \nE.  Grants Pass’ Efforts to Run Homeless People Out of Town \n44.  On a daily and nightly basis hundreds of homeless people living in Grants Pass are in the \nidentical situations as plaintiffs.  They are awakened by officers of the Grants Pass Public Safety \nDepartment.  They are moved along.  They are told that they cannot sleep outside.  They are \nfrequently ticketed, fined, prosecuted and jailed for existing outside in Grants Pass.  Many \nhomeless people now sleep just outside city limits to avoid being harassed, awakened, orderd to \nmove-along, threatened with punishment, ticketed, arrested and prosecuted.   \n \n10 – THIRD AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  \n\n45.  The City of Grants Pass has taken other affirmative and intentional steps to remove \nhomeless people from within its borders.  The City has removed park benches from its parks so \nthat people have no place in public to rest.  The City has built fences around bus stop benches.  \nCity police have offered to pay one-way bus fare to get homeless people out of town.   \n46.  The City has made it difficult or impossible for any organization to operate a warming or \ncooling center for homeless people anywhere within the City.  \n47.  The Grants Pass City Council has voted against affordable housing projects being \nallowed in the City, sometimes citing non-existent problems, like lack of parking, to explain their \nvotes against affordable housing.   \n48.  Elected officials have publically stated their desire to drive homeless people from the \nCity and to make it difficult for homeless people to live in Grants Pass.   \n49.  Counsel for plaintiffs reviewed dozens of anti-camping and anti-sleeping citations \nproduced to them by Defendants pursuant to a public records request.  These tickets were issued \nbetween January of 2015 and May of 2017.  Of the 208 tickets received and reviewed, almost all \nof them were issued to people who were homeless at the time of issuance.  These tickets show \nthat these ordianances are selectively enforced against homeless individuals.  Also, the tickets \nwere usually issued based on officer initiated patrols, not based upon complaints from the public.  \nOf the 83 camping tickets issued pursuant to GPMC 5.61.030, 67 were officer initiated.  Of the \n125 sleeping tickets issued pursuant to GPMC 5.61.020, 93 of them were officer initiated.   \nF.  Relevant Ordinances   \n50.   City of Grants Pass Municipal Code 5.61.010-030 “Prohibited Camping” provides, in \npart: \n5.61.010 Definitions. Unless the context requires otherwise the \n \n11 – THIRD AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  \n\nfollowing definitions apply to Chapter 5.61.  \nA. “To Camp” means to set up or to remain in or at a campsite.  \nB. “Campsite” means any place where bedding, sleeping bag, or other \nmaterial used for bedding purposes, or any stove or fire is placed, \nestablished, or maintained for the purpose of maintaining a temporary \nplace to live, whether or not such place incorporates the use of any tent, \nlean-to, shack, or any other structure, or any vehicle or part thereof.  \n5.61.020 Sleeping on Sidewalks, Streets, Alleys, or Within Doorways \nProhibited  \nA. No person may sleep on public sidewalks, streets, or alleyways at any \ntime as a matter of individual and public safety.  \nB. No person may sleep in any pedestrian or vehicular entrance to public \nor private property abutting a public sidewalk.  \nC. In addition to any other remedy provided by law, any person found in \nviolation of this section may be immediately removed from the premises.  \n5.61.030 Camping Prohibited  \nNo person may occupy a campsite in or upon any sidewalk, street, alley, \nlane, public right of way, park, bench, or any other publicly-owned \nproperty or under any bridge or viaduct,  \n \n51.  The City of Grants Pass Municipal Code 6.46.090, “Camping in Parks” provides,    \n6.46.090 Camping in Parks \nA. It is unlawful for any person to camp, as defined in GPMC Title 5, \nwithin the boundaries of the city parks.1 \n \nIV. Class Allegations \n52.  Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated under \nRule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  They seek to represent a class that consists of: \nall involuntarily homeless people living in Grants Pass, Oregon.2   \n                                                 \n1 Defendant adopted this amended version of GPMC 6.46.090(A) on or about Jan. 2, 2019.  At the time of Plaintiffs’ \ninitial filing, GPMC 6.46.090(A) read as follows:  It is unlawful for any person to camp within the boundaries of the \nCity parks.  For the purposes of this section, camping shall mean sleeping or erecting sleeping quarters or living \nquarters.  \n   \n2 This definition includes homeless individuals who sometimes sleep outside of city limits to avoid punishment by \nDefendant addressed in this lawsuit.   \n \n12 – THIRD AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  \n\n53.  The Class is so numerous that joinder of its members is impracticable.  The latest (2017) \npoint-in-time count for Josephine County indicates that the class numbers, at a minimum, in the \nhundreds.  In addition to the hundreds of homeless adults, there are 531 homeless youth enrolled \nin school in Grants Pass.   \n54.  The relief sought is common to all members of the proposed class, and common \nquestions of law and fact exist as to all members of the class.  Plaintiffs seek prospective relief \nfrom being ordered to “move along” when they have nowhere else to go and from enforcement \nof Grants Pass’ anti-camping ordinances, Grants Pass’ anti-sleeping ordinance, the park \nexclusion ordinance and Criminal Trespass laws when they are enforced against members of the \nclass solely because they have no place else to go.   \n55.  There is a well-defined community of interest in the questions of law and fact affecting \nthe class as a whole.  The questions of law and fact common to the class predominate over any \nquestions affecting solely individual members of the action, and include: \na.  Are emergency shelter beds available to all homeless individuals in Grants Pass? \nb.  Are there other places where involuntarily homeless people can go to rest, sleep, \nor shelter in Grants Pass?  \nc.  Are resting, sleeping and sheltering oneself unavoidable basic human needs? \nd.  Does the City of Grants Pass’ policy and practice of ordering homeless people to \n“move along” as well as enforcement of the anti-sleeping ordinance, the anti-\ncamping ordinances and criminal trespass laws violate plaintiffs’ rights to equal \nprotection and due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution?   \n \n13 – THIRD AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  \n\ne.  Does the City of Grants Pass’ policy and practice of ordering homeless people to \n“move along” as well as enforcement of the anti-sleeping ordinance, the anti-\ncamping ordinances and criminal trespass laws violate plaintiffs’ right to be free \nfrom cruel and unusual punishment and excessive fines under the Eighth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution? and \nf.  Is prospective relief appropriate to stop the City of Grants Pass from violating \nplaintiffs’ rights?  \n56.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical to the class.  Plaintiffs and the proposed class are \ninvoluntarily homeless individuals who have been and are subject to the enforcement of the \nCity’s policy and practice of ordering homeless people to “move-along,” the anti-camping \nordinances, anti-sleeping ordinance and criminal trespass laws as well as the City’s other policies \nand practices aimed at making homeless people living in Grants Pass uncomfortable and driving \nthem out of town. \n57.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  Plaintiffs have \nretained counsel competent and experienced in class action litigation. \n58.  A class action is the appropriate and superior method for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy.  Prosecuting separate actions would create the risk of \ninconsistent or varying adjudications, establishing incompatible standards of conduct for the City \nof Grants Pass.  Allowing this lawsuit to proceed as a class action will permit the class of \nsimilarly situated persons to prosecute their common claims in a single forum simultaneously \nand efficiently, and without the unnecessary duplication of effort and expense that numerous \nindividual actions would entail. \n \n14 – THIRD AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  \n\n59.  To the extent that any member of the class could afford individual litigation, it would be \nunduly burdensome to the judicial system.  Concentrating this litigation in one forum will \npromote judicial economy, consistency, and parity among the claims of individual members of \nthe class. \n60.  Plaintiffs know of no difficulty which would be encountered in the management of this \nlitigation that would preclude its maintenance as a class action. \nV. Plaintiffs Attempted to Resolve this Matter Prior to Litigation \n61.  Plaintiffs’ counsel contacted the City of Grants Pass on September 10, 2018 to demand \nrelief as outlined in this complaint.   \n62.  Despite these efforts, the parties have not been able to resolve their dispute. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \nEighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Cruel and Unusual Punishment; \nExcessive Fines) and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n63.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations above as if fully set forth herein. \n64.  Unsheltered homeless people in Grants Pass are involuntarily homeless in public.  They \nhave no place else to go.    \n65.  Resting, sleeping and seeking shelter is not voluntary conduct.  They are basic and \nharmless human needs.  Performing these acts in public is integral to the status of being \nhomeless in Grants Pass.   \n66.  By punishing the acts of resting, sleeping or seeking shelter in public, without providing \nany legal place for most homeless place to conduct such activities, Grants Pass effectively \npunishes and criminalizes the status of homelessness in violation of plaintiffs’ rights to be free \nfrom excessive fines and cruel and usual punishment.   \n \n15 – THIRD AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  \n\n67.  As applied to the homeless individuals, the City’s pattern and practice of ordering \nhomeless people to “move along,” as well as the enforcement of the anti-sleeping ordinance, the \nanti-camping ordinances and criminal trespass laws violates the 8th Amendment prohibited on \nimposing excessive fines and inflicting cruel and unusual punishment by harming plaintiffs with \npunitive and criminal sanctions for engaging in innocent, involuntary, life-sustaining activity, \nthus effectively punishing and criminalizing their homeless status.   \n68.  In the absence of prospective injunctive relief, plaintiffs and prospective class members \nwill be subject to the real threat of being ticketed, arrested, fined and jailed in violation of their \nrights.   \n69.  Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive and declaratory relief, as set forth below. \n70.  Plaintiffs are entitled to their reasonable costs and attorney fees on this claim pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1988. \nSECOND  CLAIM FOR RELIEF:  \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Equal Protection) \nand 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n71.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations above as if fully set forth herein.  \n72.  Defendant selectively orders homeless individuals to “move along” when they are resting \nor sleeping in public or in their vehicles.  Defendant selectively enforces the anti-camping \nordinances and criminal trespass laws against individuals like plaintiffs pursuant to a \ndiscriminatory purpose to rid the City of Grants Pass of homeless individuals. \n73.  Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent have been told by Grants Pass police that \nthere is no place where homeless people are allowed to be in Grants Pass.  The fundamental right \nof the plaintiffs to move about freely and engage in harmless life-sustaining activities such as \n \n16 – THIRD AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  \n\nresting,  sleeping and attempting to stay warm was and is infringed on by defendant’s conduct \nand enforcement of the camping ordinances, the sleeping ordinance and criminal trespass laws.   \n74.  Homelessness is an arbitrary classification that defendant uses to accomplish the \nforbidden aim of ridding the City of Grants Pass of homeless persons through selective \napplication of the above laws. \n75.  Non-homeless people are not ordered to “move-along,” ticketed, fined, prosecuted and \njailed for resting or sleeping in public.  \n76.  Defendant’s selective enforcement of these laws violates the Equal Protection clause of \nthe 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. \n77.  Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive and declaratory relief, as set forth below. \n78.  Plaintiffs are entitled to their reasonable costs and attorney fees on this claim pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1988. \nTHIRD  CLAIM FOR RELIEF:  \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Substantive Due Process) \nand 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n79.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations above as if fully set forth herein.  \n80.  The fundamental right of the individual plaintiffs to move about freely and engage in \nharmless life-sustaining activities such as resting,  sleeping and attempting to stay warm was and \nis infringed on by defendant’s “move-along” orders and enforcement of the camping ordinances, \nthe sleeping ordinance and criminal trespass laws.   \n81.  Defendant’s conduct violates the Due Process clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution. \n82.  Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive and declaratory relief, as set forth below. \n \n17 – THIRD AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  \n\n83.  Plaintiffs are entitled to their reasonable costs and attorney fees on this claim pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1988. \nFOURTH  CLAIM FOR RELIEF:  \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Procedural Due Process/Notice) \nand 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n84.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations above as if fully set forth herein.  \n85.  The City of Grants Pass’ two anti-camping ordinances do not provide constitutionally \nsufficient notice such that a reasonable homeless person in Grants Pass would understand what \nconduct is prohibited.   \n86.  Plaintiffs have not been given meaningful notice prior to being deprived of the liberty \ninterests in moving freely through Grants Pass, resting, sleeping and seeking shelter from the \nelements.   \n87.    Plaintiffs have been excluded from Grants Pass parks without due process of law. \n88.  Plaintiffs are entitled to their reasonable costs and attorney fees on this claim pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1988. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs ask the Court for the following relief: \n1.  To certify the class as defined above at ¶ 52; \n2.  To declare Grants Pass’ campaign to drive homeless people out of the City \nunconstitutional and enjoin such practices, policies and customs;   \n3.  To issue a declaration that, as applied to plaintiffs, enforcement of GPMC 5.61.020 (the \nanti-sleeping ordinance), GPMC 5.61.030 (the anti-camping ordinance), GPMC 6.46.090 (the \nparks anti-camping ordinance), GPMC 6.46.350 (the park exclusion ordinance) and criminal \n \n18 – THIRD AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  \n\ntrespass laws is an unconstitutional infringement on plaintiffs' Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendment rights. \n4.  To issue an injunction prohibiting Grants Pass from enforcement of GPMC 5.61.020 (the \nanti-sleeping ordinance), GPMC 5.61.030 (the anti-camping ordinance), GPMC 6.46.090 (the \nparks anti-camping ordinance), GPMC 6.46.350 (park exclusion ordinance) and criminal trespass \nlaws against homeless individuals in Grants Pass who are engaged in the life sustaining activities \nof resting, sleeping or seeking shelter from the elements, unless and until Grants Pass provides a \nplace where plaintiffs can lawfully engage in necessary life-sustaining activities.   \n5.  To award plaintiffs their costs and attorney fees, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988 \n6.  To award plaintiffs such other relief as may be just and equitable.   \n  Respectfully submitted, this 13th  day of November, 2019.   \n \n            s/ Walter Fonseca       \n            Walter Fonseca, OSB #136349 \n            Eric Dahlin, OSB #945439 \n            Edward Johnson, OSB #965737 \n            (541) 476-2154     \n \n19 – THIRD AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  ",

The class members allege that the City of Grants Pass has a web of ordinances, \ncustoms, and practices that, in combination, punish people based on their status of being \ninvoluntarily homeless.  This case comes before the Court on cross-motions for summary \njudgment.  The Court has also considered amicus briefs submitted by League of Oregon Cities \nand the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty.  For the reasons below, Plaintiffs' \nPage 1 of 35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 2 of 35\nMotion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 62) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part, and \nDefendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 80) is DENIED.1 \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nSummary judgment shall be granted when the record sµows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material facts and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,247 (1986).  The moving \nparty has the initial burden of showing that no genuine issue of material fact exists. Celotex \nv. \nCorp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,323 (1986); Devereaux  Abbey, 263 F.3d 1070, 1076 (9th Cir. \n2001) (en bane).  The court cannot weigh the evidence or determine the truth but may only \ndetermine whether there is a genuine issue of fact.  Playboy Enters., Inc. v.  Welles, 279 F.3d 796, \n800 (9th Cir. 2002).  An issue of fact is genuine \"if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury \n' \ncould return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. \nWhen a properly supported motion for summary judgment is made, the burden shifts to \nthe opposing party to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.  Id. at \n250.  Conclusory allegations unsupported by factual material are insufficient to defeat a motion \nfor summary judgment.  Taylor v. List, 880 F.2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir. 1989).  Instead, the  . \nopposing party must, by affidavit or as otherwise provided by Rule 56, designate specific facts \nwhich show there is a genuine issue for trial.  Devereaux, 263 F .3d at 1076.  In assessing whether \na \nparty has met its burden, the court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the non \nmoving party.  Allen v. City ofL os Angeles, 66 F.3d 1052, 1056 (9th Cir. 1995). \n1 The parties have consented to Magistrate Judge jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c)(l). \nPage 2 of35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 3 of 35\nBACKGROUND \nThis case is about respecting the dignity of homeless individuals and the City of Grants \nPass' ability to protect the safety and welfare of its citizens.  Unsheltered homelessness is an \never-growing crisis nationwide, and the overwhelming majority of homeless individuals are not \nliving that way by choice.  According to the United States Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (\"HUD\"), there were an estimated 533,000 homeless individuals in the United \nStates in 2018; more than a third of whom were \"unsheltered homeless,\" meaning, individuals \n\"whose primary nighttime location [wa]s a public or private place not designed for or ordinarily \nused as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings, including a car, park, ... or \ncamping ground.\"2  HUD's figures are obtained using what is known as a \"point-in-time\" or \n\"PIT\" count, which, as its name suggests, is arrived at by counting the number of people in a city \nor county who are homeless on a particular night.3  HUD requires local homelessness assistance \nand prevention networks to conduct a PIT count each year as a condition of federal funding.  A \n2001 administrative study found that the true size of a homeless population may be anywhere \nbetween 2.5 to 10 times larger than what can be estimated by a PIT count.4  As the Ninth Circuit \nrecognized in Martin v.  City ofB  oise, there are many reasons for this undercount: · \nIt is widely recognized that a one-night point in time count will undercount the \nhomeless population, as many homeless individuals may have access to temporary \nhousing on a given night, and as weather conditions may affect the number of \navailable volunteers and the number of homeless people staying at shelters or \naccessing services on the night of the count.  · \n.  . \n2 National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty, Housing Notilandcuffs 2019: Ending the \nCriminalization ofH  omelessness in U.S. Cities 28 n. 15 (2019),  . \nhttp://nlchp.org/wpcontent/uploads/2019/12/HOUSING-NOT-HANDCUFFS-2019-FINAL.pdf . \n[hereinafter Housing Not Handcuffs]. \n3 Id. at 28. \n4 Id. \nPage 3 of35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 4 of 35\n. 920 F.3d 584, 604 (9th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. City ofB  oise, Idaho v. Martin, 140 S. Ct. \n674, (2019). \nTo combat the homeless crisis, many local governments have created ordinances-such \nas the ones challenged by Plaintiffs in this case-that ban \"camping\" or similar activities in all or \nparts of a city.  These ordinances are often referred to as \"quality of life laws. \"5  Enforcing \nquality oflife laws is an expensive endeavor nationwide.  For example, the City of Los Angeles \nspends $50 million annually policing criminal and civil quality of life laws.6  By contrast, the \nCity of Los Angeles spends only $13 million on providing housing and services to the country's \n. largest homeless population.7  Likewise, a Seattle University study found that the cost to the City \nof Seattl~ for enforcing just one of its six quality of life laws was $2.3 million over five years. 8 \nThe.City of Grants Pass, Oregon, the city involved in this case, had a population of \nI \nI \n23,000 people according to the 2000 census, and it is now estimated to have more than 38,000 \npeople.9  The development of affordable housing in Grants Pass has not kept up with the \npopulation growth~  City Manager Aaron Cubic confirmed in his deposition that Grants Pass has \nI \na vacancy rate of 1%   and that \"essentially means that there's no vacancy.\"  Edward Johnson \nI \nI \nDeel., Ex. 1, Cubic Depo. at p. 49, lines 1-10 (Dkt. #63-1).  Kelly Wessels, the Chief Operating \nI \nI \nOfficer of the Community Action Agency that serves Grants Pass testified that \"Grants Pass'  I \n5 See Joshua Howard et al., At What Cost: The Minimum Cost ofC  riminalizing Homelessness in Seattle \nand Spokane, HOMELESS RIGHTS ADVOCACY PROJECT 10 (2015), \n· https://digitalcommons.law .seattleu.edu/hrap/10. \n6 Gale Holland; L.A.

Landlords routinely require an \napplicant to have an income that is three times the monthly rent.  Rental units that cost less than \n,r \n$1,000/month are virtually unheard of in Grants Pass.\" Kelly Wessels Deel.  7 (Dkt. #42). \nA point-in-time count of homeless individuals was conducted by the United Community \nAction Network (\"UCAN\") on January 30, 2019, in Grants Pass.  UCAN counted 602 homeless \n,r \nindividuals in Grants Pass.  Wessels DecL  6 (Dkt. #42).  Another 1,045 individuals were \ncounted as \"precariously housed,\" meaning that they were sleeping at the home of somebody \nelse, or \"couch surfing.\"  Id. \nIn.March 2013, the Grants Pass City Council hosted a Community Roundtable, \nhereinafter referred to as the \"2013 Roundtable Meeting,\" to \"identify solutions to current \n,r \nvagrancy problems.\"  Wessels Deel.  8, Ex. 1 (minutes of public roundtable) (Dkt #65). \nMinutes from this meeting show that the City Council President stated, \"the point is to make it \nuncomfortable enough for them in our city so they [referring to homeless individuals] will want· \nto move on do';Vll the road.\"  Wessels Deel., Ex. 1 at 2 (Dkt. #65~1).  At the end of the meeting, a \nlist of\"actions to move forward on\" was created.  These action items included (i) ways to \nincrease police presence downtown; (ii) create an exclusion zone and possibly have a blanket \ntrespassing regulation; (iii) specific amount of misdemeanors leading to prosecution; (iv) not \nfeeding in parks or other specific areas in the city; (v) posting \"zero tolerance\" signs stating \ncertain ordinances will be strictly enforced; (vi) look into the possibility of creating a \"do not \nserve\" or \"most unwanted\" list; (vii) pass out the trespassing letters and get word out to have \nthem signed; and (viii) provide assistance in constructing safe areas at agencies to protect \n. volunteers from aggressive behavior.  Id at 13.  City Manager Aaron Cubic confirmed that the \naction items from the 2013. Roundtable Meeting were copied into the City's strategic plans in the \nPage 5 of35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 6 of 35\nform of an objective to \"address the vagrancy issue\" starting with the 2013-14 Grants Pass \nI \nStrategic Plan up to the current 2019 Grants Pass Strategic Plan.  Edward Johnson Deel., Ex. 1,  I \nI \nCubic Depo. at p. 29 lines 11-16; p. 46 line 20 to p. 48 line 10. (Dkt. #63-1 ).  The City Manager \nI \nalso confirmed that one of the action items related to this objective was the \"targeted \nI \nenforcement of illegal camping.\"  Id. at p. 36 line 16 top. 37 line 5. \nThere are no homeless shelters in Grants Pass that qualify as \"shelters\" under the criteria \nprovided by HUD.  The housing option cited by the City that most resembles a shelter is the \nGospel Rescue Mission (\"GRM\"), which operates transitional housing programs in Grants Pass. \nGRM Director of Resident Services, Brian Bouteller, te.stified that GRM offers 30-day \ntransitional housing in two facilities: one facility is for women and children with capacity for 60 \npeople and the other for men with 78 spaces.  Edward Johnson Deel., Ex. 2, Bouteller Depo. p. \n18 lines 10-15 (Dkt. #63-2).  There is no program for men with children or unaccompanied \nminors.  Id. at Bouteller Depo. p. 19, lines 5-8.  Homeless individuals in these programs are \nrequired to work six-hour days, six days a week in exchange for a bunk for 30 days.  Id. at \nBouteller Depo. p. 48 line 23-p. 51 line 5.  During this 30-day period, people are not permitted to \nlook for outside work.  Id. at Bouteller Depo. at p. 51 line 25-p. 52 line 4.  It is mandatory that \nI  GRM residents attend a traditional Christian Chapel twice a day and go to a Christian Church , \nI . \nthat follows the Nicene and Apostle's Creed ~very week.  Id. atBou!eller Depo. at p. 33 line 10-\np. 35 line 3.  Before a person is considered for admission at GRM, they must agree to comply \nwith a lengthy list of rules.  For example, if you have serious or chronic medical or mental health \nissues that preventyou from participating in daily GRM life, you may not be able to stay at the \nGRM; you are to remain nicotine free during your stay at GRM; all intimate relationships other \n· than legal/biblical marriage, regardless of gender, either on or off Mission property are strictly \nPage 6 of35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 7 of 35\nforbidden.  Edward Johnson Deel., Ex 3 (Dkt. #63-3).  GRM has avoided seeking government \nfunding so that it can maintain these restrictive rules.  Johnson Deel., Ex 2, Bouteller Depo. p. \n15 lines 15-23 (Dkt. #63-2). \nThe class of involuntarily homeless people living in and around Grants Pass, Oregon was  . \ncertified by this Court on August 7, 2019. (Dkt. #4 7).  The class is defined as all involuntarily \nhomeless individuals living in Grants Pass, Oregon, including homeless individuals who \nsometimes sleep outside city limits to avoid harassment and punishment by Defendant City of \nGrants Pass as addressed in this lawsuit.  The class representatives allege that each of their \nsituations fall under the definition of homelessness adopted by HUD.  24 C.F.R § 582.5 (2012). \nHUD's definition encompasses a variety of living situations, including youth homelessness, id § \n582.5(3); individuals fleeing domestic violence, id. § 582.5(4); individuals \"living in a \nsupervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living \narrangements,\" id § 582.5(1)(ii); and individuals whose primary nighttime residence \"is a public \nor private place not designed for or ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation for \nhuman beings, including a car, park, abandoned building, bus or train station, or camping \nground, id. § 582.5(1)(i). \nClass representatives allege that their situations are just three representations of modem \nhomelessness in the United States.  Class representative, Debra Blake, lost her job and housing \napproximately ten years ago and has been involuntarily homeless in Grants Pass ever since. \n,r \nBlake Deel.  3 (Dkt. #90).  At the time of class certification, Ms. Blake was living in temporary \ntransitional housing, but her ninety-day stay expired and she has returned to sleeping outside.  As \nrecently as September 11, 2019, Ms. Blake was cited for illegal camping and \"prohibited \nconduct\" in Riverside Park in Grants Pass because she was laying in the park in a sleeping bag at \n,r \n7:30 a.m.  Id.  7.  Ms. Blake was convicted and fined $590.  Later that same morning, the same \nPage 7 of35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 8 of 35\nofficer wrote Ms. Blake a citation for \"c.riminal trespass on City property\" with an associated \nfine of $295.  Id.  Ms. Blake was also issued· a park exclusion on September 11, 2019.  Id., 8. \nMs. Blake filed an appeal and the exclusion was lifted without explanation after she had already \nbeen excluded from all Grants Pass parks for two weeks.  Id.  Currently, Ms. Blake owes the City \nover $5,000 in unpaid fines related to enforcement of the ordinances at issue while living outside \nin Grants Pass.  Class representative, John Logan, has been intermittently homeless in Grants \nPass for the last ten years.  Mr. Logan currently sleeps in his truck at a rest stop north of Grants \nPass because he fears being awakened and ticketed ifhe sleeps in his truck within the City. \nLogan Deel. , 2 (Dkt. #67).  Mr. Logan is a licensed home care provider and his clients have \nallowed him to sleep on a mattress in a room they use for storage approximately four to five \na \nnights  week.  Id. ,  3.  However, that job ended in October or November 2019.  Id  Class \nrepresentative, Gloria Johnson, has been living out of her van since at least before this litigation \nbegan.  Johnson Deel., 2 (Dkt. #91).  Ms. Johnson has parked her van to sleep outside of town \non both BLM land and county roads.  She claims that she has been asked to move along several \ntimes.  Id ,, 3-5.  While their exact circumstances and stories may vary, the three class \nrepresentatives all share the need to conduct the life sustaining activities of resting, sleeping, and \nseeking shelter from the elements while living in Grants Pass without a permanent home. \nThrough their appointed class representatives, Plaintiffs move for summary judgment on \neach of their claims.  Plaintiffs allege that the City of Grants Pass, through a combination of \nordinances, customs, and policies, has unconstitutionally punished them for conducting life \nsustaining activities and criminalized their existence as homeless individuals.  Plaintiffs seek an•. \norder from this Court declaring that the City's enforcement of Grants Pass Municipal Codes \n(\"GPMC\") 5.61.020 (the \"anti-sleeping ordinance\"); GPMC 5.61.030 and GPMC 6.46.090 (the \n\"anti-camping ordinances\"), GPMC 6.46.350 (the \"park exclusion ordinance\") and criminal · \ntrespass laws stemming from violations of those ordinances are uncqnstitutional as applied to the \nPage 8 of35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 9 of 35\nplaintiff class. Plaintiffs also seek an injunction prohibiting the City from enforcing those \nordinances and related criminal trespass laws against the plaintiff class unless and until members \nof the class have the opportunity to obtain shelter within the City.  The exact language of the \nordinances at issue are as follows: \n5.61.010 Definitions \nA. \"To Camp\" means to set up or to remain in or at a campsite. \nB. \"Campsite\" means any place where bedding, sleeping b~g, or other material used \nfor bedding purposes, or any stove or fire is placed, established, or maintained for \nthe purpose of maintaining a temporary place to live, whether or not such place \nincorporates the use of any tent, lean-to, shack, or any other structure, or any vehicle \n01· part thereof. \n5.61.020  Sleeping  on  Sidewalks,  Streets,  Alleys,  or  Within  Doorways \nProhibited \nA.

Id., 5 (some citations were for more than one offense). The \nnumber of citations rose from 24 tickets in 2012 to 228 tickets in 2014, a significant increase \nfollowing the 2013 Roundtable Meeting.  Id. \nDISCUSSION \nI.  Grants Pass' policy and practice of punishing homelessness violates the Cruel and \nUnusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment. \na.  Martin v. Boise is controlling precedent. \nThe United States Constitution prohibits punishing people for engaging in unavoidable \nhuman acts, such as sleeping or resting outside when they. have no access to shelter.  Martin v. \nBoise, 920 F.3d 584 (9th Cir. 2019) cert. denied2019 U.S.~LEXIS 7571 (Dec. 16, 2019).  In \nMartin, the Ninth Circuit held that \"so long as there is a greater number of homeless individuals \nin [a  city] than the number of available beds [in shelters],\" a city cannot punish homeless \nindividuals for \"involuntarily sitting, lying, and sleeping in public.\"  Id. at 617.  That is, as long \nas there are no emergency shelter beds available to homeless individuals, \"the government \ncannot criminalize indigent, homeless people for sleeping outdoors, on public property, on the \nfalse premise they had a choice in the matter.\" Id. (quoting Jones v. City ofL os Angeles, 444 \nF.3d 1118, 1138 (9th Cir. 2006);vacated on other grounds; 505 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir. 2007)). \nMartin is binding precedent on this Court.  In Martin, six plaintiffs who were or had \nrecently been homeless residents of Boise, Idaho challenged two city ordinances that punished \nhomeless people for sleeping or camping in public spaces.  The Boise ~•camping ordinance\" \nprohibited and punished the \"use of 'any street~, sidewalks, parks, or public places as a camping \nPage 11 of 35 OPINION AND ORDER. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 12 of 35\nplace at any time.\"'  Id at 603.  Camping was defined as \"the use of public property as a \ntemporary or permanent place of dwelling, lodging, or residence.\"  Id. at 603-604. The Boise \n\"disorderly conduct ordinance\" prohibited \"occupying, lodging, or sleeping in any building, \nstructure, or public place, whether public or private ... without the permission of the owner or \nperson entitled to possession or in control thereof.\"  Id. at 604. \nIn this case, Grants Pass' two anti-camping ordinances prohibit \"occupying a campsite\" \non \"any publicly-owned property\" in the City of Grants Pass.  GPMC 5.61.030; GPMC 6.46.090. \n\"Campsite\" is defined as \"any place where bedding, sleeping bag, or other material used for \nbedding purposes ... is placed ... for the purpose of maintaining a temporary place to live.\" \nGPMC 5.61.01 0(B).  The camping ordinances apply to all public spaces in Grants Pass at all \ntimes, including parks.  The camping ordinances also prohibit anyone from sleeping in their c~s \nfor two consecutive hours within any Grants Pass park parking lot between the hours ,of midnight \nand 6:00 a.m.  GPMC 6.46.090(B).  The anti-sleeping ordinance prohibits sleeping \"on public \nsidewalks, streets, or alleyways at any time ....\"   GPMC 5.61.020.  Additionally, \"[n]o person \nmay sleep in any pedestrian or vehicular entrance to public or private property abutting a public \nsidewalk.\"  Id  These ordinances, in combination, prohibit individuals from sleeping in any \npublic space in Grarits Pass while usint:; any type of item that falls into the category of\"bedding\" \nor is used as \"bedding.\" \nGrants Pass takes the position that Martin simply confirms that a city cannot criminalize \nthe unavoidable act of sleeping outside when there are not enough shelter beds available.  Grants \nPass argues that the City amended its anti-camping ordinances to remove the word \"sleeping\" \nafter Martin.  On January 2, 2019, the City amended GPMC 6.46.090 by removing the word \n\"sleeping\" so that the act of \"sleeping\" was to be distinguished from the prohibited conduct of \nPage 12 of35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 13 of 35\n1112, \n\"camping\" under the City's Camping in the Parks Ordinance.  Aaron Hisel Deel.  13, Exs. \n11, 12 (Dkt. #81). The City's intent for making this change \"was to make it clear that those \nwithout shelter could engage in the involuntary acts of sleeping or resting in the City's parks but \nwould still be prohibited from the voluntary conduct of maintaining a 'campsite' in the parks as a \n'place to live.\"' Defendant's Motion at 35 (Dkt. #80) (emphasis in original).  The Court \nappreciates the City's attempt to comply with Martin.  However, Grants Pass ignores the basic \nlife sustaining need to keep warm and dry while sleeping in order to survive the elements.  Under \nthe Grants Pass ordnances, if a homeless person sleeps on public property with so much as a \nflattened cardboard box to separate himself from the wet cold ground, he risks being punished \nunder the anti-camping ordinance.  Grants Pass cannot credibly argue that its ordinances allow \nsleeping in public without punishment when, in reality, the only way for homeless people to \nI'  . \nlegally sleep on public property within the City is if they lay on the ground with orily the clothing \non their backs and without their items near them.  That cannot be what Martin had in mind. \nMaintaining a practice where the City allows a person to \"sleep\" on public property, but punishes \nhim as a \"camper\" ifhe so much as uses a bundled up item of clothing as a pillow, is cruel and \nunusual punishment.  Therefore, this Court finds that it is not enough under the Eight \nAmendment to simply allow sleeping in public spaces; the Eight Amendment also prohibits a \nCity from punishing homeless people for taking necessary minimal measures to keep themselves \nwarm and dry while sleeping when there are no alternative forms of shelter available. \nI \nAs was the case in Martin, Grants Pass has far more homeless people than \"practically \n1 \nI \navailable\"1shelter beds.  In Martin, the Ninth Circuit's math reflected 867 homeless individuals  I \nin Ada County Idaho (an unknown number. in Boise) while Boise had 354 emergency shelter \nbeds and 92 overflow mats.  Martin 920 F.3d at 604,606.  On January 30, 2019, the Point in \nPage 13 of 35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 14 of 35\nTime Count10 in Grants Pass counted 1,673 unduplicated individuals, 602 of whom were \n,r,r \n\"homeless\" and the rest of whom were ''p~ecariously housed or doubled up.\"  Wessels Deel. \n5-6 (0kt. #42).  The mathematical ratio in the record as it currently stands is 602 homeless \npeople (with another 1,071 on the verge of homelessness) in Grants Pass and, on the other side of \nthe ledger, zero emergency shelter beds.  The numbers here are clear, overwhelming, and \ndecisive. \nThe Gospel Rescue Mission (\"GRM\") is the only entity in-Grants Pass that offers any \nsort of temporary program for some class members year-round.· However, GRM cannot be \nincluded in the mathematical ratio of homeless people to shelter beds because GRM has lost its \n,r \ndesignation as a HUD certified emergency shelter.  Wessels Deel.  12 (Dkt. #29).  GRM is also \nconsiderably less accessible than even the shelters in Martin because it does not offer temporary \nemergency shelter and has substantial religious requirements and other restrictive rules.  GRM \n. does not offer \"emergency shelter,\" only a \"30-day Residential Program.\"  Bouteller Depo. p. 27 \nlines 11-18.  This program offers extended stays and is more akin to a transitional housing \nI \n,r \nprogram than a homeless shelter.  Bouteller Depo. p. 18 lines 10-15; Wessels Deel.  12 (Dkt. \nI \n.  I \n#29).  Additionally, there are several strict rules for residents of GRM, including remaining \nI \nnicotine free while_ on or off the premises and mandatory attendance to Christian church and \nother church affiliated activities.  Even without these rules, GRM's 138 beds would not be nearly \nenough to accommodate the at least 602 homeless individuals in Grants Pass. \n· Grants· Pass argues that Plaintiffs have alternative \"realistically available\" shelter outside \nthe City on federal BLM land, Josephine County land, or state rest stops.  This remarkable \n10 The Ninth Circuit in Martin also used PIT Counts to determine the number of homeless people in the \narea and commented that PIT Counts typically undercount the homeless population in a community \nbecause of difficulty in locating people, weather and volunteer issues.  Martin at 604. · \nPage 14 of35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 15 of 35\nargument not only fails under Martin, but it also sheds light on the City's attitude towards its \nhomeless citizens.  Essentially, Grants Pass argues that it should be permitted to continue to \npunish its homeless population because Plaintiffs have the option to just leave the City.  The \nCity's suggestion that because it is geographically smaller than Boise or other cities, it should be \nallowed to drive its homeless population onto \"nearby\" federal, state, or Josephine County land, \nis not supported by Martin.  Additionally, the record does not support the suggestion that \nhomeless people are welcome to live without interruption by law enforcement at these locations. \nBLM land is available for recreational camping, not as a space for emergency shelter.  Fed. Reg. \nVol. 70, No. 159 (Aug. 18, 2005).  The campsites cost money.  Aaron Hisel Deel., Ex. 1 at 52 \n(Dkt. #81-1).  Living, establishing occupancy, or using this land for \"residential purposes\" is \nspecifically prohibited, and there are limits on how long a person can stay.  Fed. Reg. Vol. 70, \nNo. 159; See also Gloria Johnson Deel. ,r,r 3-5; Blake Deel. ,r 15.  Homeless people who attempt \nto live on BLM land are subject to trespass prosecution under 43 C.F.R. 2808.10, fined $330, and \nsummoned to this Court.  Likewise, Josephine County does not welcome non~recreational \ncamping in its parks.  The County issued a letter from its Parks Director on November 12, 2019, \nstating that \"County Parks are not a good alternative for nonrecreationalcampers-individuals or \nfamilies who need a place to sleep, due to not having a permenant [sic] residents [sic].\"  Wessels \n· Deel., Ex. 1 (Dkt. #89-1).  This letter urges homeless services providers not to pay for campsites \n,r \nfor homeless individuals in County Parks.  Wessels Deel.  8 (Dkt. #89).  Similarly, camping, \nsetting up a tent, or remaining in a rest stop for more than 12 hours in a 24-hour period are \nexplicitly prohibited.  0 AR 734-030-0010(18). \nFinally, the City lists three services offen~d within Grants Pass that similarly do not \nchange the equation under Martin.  In February 2020, the Umpqua Community Action Network \nPage 15 of 35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 16 of 35\n(UCAN) opened a warming center that may hold up to 40 individuals on nights when the \ntemperature is either below 30 degrees or below 32 degrees with snow.  Wessels Deel. ,i 9 (Dkt. \n·. #89).  From the record, it appears 131 different people have stayed at the warming center since.it \nopened.  ld. ,i,i 9-11.  As of the filing of Plaintiffs' Reply Brief, the center had been open sixteen \nnights and reached capacity on every night except the first night it opened, when it had 32 \noccupants.  Id. ,i 11.  While the opening of a warming shelter is positive for the City, this \nemergency warming facility is not a shelter for the purposes of the Martin analysis because the  . \nfacility does not have beds and is not available consistently throughout the year.  Id. ,i 9.  Even if \nthe warming center did count as a shelter under HUD, the capacity of the warming center is not \nlarge enough to accommodate the amount of homeless people in Grants Pass. \nThe City also referenced a \"sobering center\" where intoxicated individuals may be \n. temporarily held and a youth shelt~r. Response Br. at 13 (Dkt. #80).  The sobering centeris not a \nshelter.  It allows for temporary placement for \"highly intoxicated\" individuals while they sober \nup, and for individuals who are creating a nuisance but \"do not warrant a trip to jail.\" Aaron · \nHisel Deel., Ex. 1 at 33 (Dkt #81-1 ).  Plaintiffs claim that the sobering center has no beds and \nconsists of a chair with restraints and 12 locked rooms with toilets where people can sober up for \nseveral hours.  Edward Johnson Deel., Ex. 2 (Dkt. #92-2)'.  Hearts with a Mission Youth Shelter \nruns an 18-bed facility where minors aged 10-1 7 may stay for 72 hours,. unless they have \nparental consent to stay longer.  Edward Johnson Deel. ,i 4 (Dkt. #92).  This shelter does not \nhave enough beds to serve the number of homeless individuals in Grants Pass and is not \n\"practically available\" to class members in this case b.ecause it is reserved for minors.  The \nrecord is undisputed that Grants Pass has far more homeless individuals than it has practically \navailable shelter beds. \n1 \n'. \nPage 16 of35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 17 of 35\nThis case cannot be distinguished from the.holding in Martin. The alternative shelters \nsuggested by the City do not change the equation set out in Martin. Because Grants Pass lacks \nadequate shelter for its homeless population, its practice of punishing people who have no access \nto shelter for the act of sleeping  resting outside while having a blanket or other bedding to stay \nOF \nwarm and dry constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. \nb.  The Eighth Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment whether \nthe punishment is designated as civil or criminal. \nGrants Pass argues that the Eighth Amendment analysis does not apply to the ordinances \nat issue in this case because they are designated as violations and, therefore, not criminal matters. \nTo support this assertion, Grants Pass quotes the Oregon Court of Appeals, which found \"[a] \nviolation is not a crime.\" State v. Dahl, 185 Or App 149, 152-56 (2002) (analyzing Oregon's \nstatutory distinctions between crimes and civil offenses and holding, among other things, that the \nFifth Amendment does not apply to violations precisely because they are not crimes).  However, \nthe label of crime or violation is not dispositive where the Eighth Amendment is concerned.  The \nfocus, for Eighth Amendment purposes, is the punishment associated with the crime, violation, \nor civil penalty.  Even though Grants Pass labels the ordinances as violations, offenders of these \nviolations are still subject to punishment.  As the United States Supreme Court has held, \nThe purpose of the Eighth Amendment ... was to limit the government's power to \npunish. See Browning-Ferris, 492 U.S. at 266-267, 275. The Cruel and Unusual \nPunishments Clause is self-evidently concerned with punishment. 'The notion of \npunishment, as we commonly understand it, cuts across the division between the \ncivil and the criminal law.' United States v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435, 447-448, (1989). \nAustin v.  United States, 509 U.S. 602, 609-610 (1993). \nUnlike the Fifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause, the Eighth Amendment's \nprohibition on punishing an involuntary act or condition applies to punishment beyond \n\"criminal\" cases.  Again, the Supreme Court made clear, \nPage 17 of35 OPINION AND ORDER. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 18 of 35\n[The United States] further suggests that the Eighth Amendment cannot apply to a \ncivil proceeding unless that proceeding is so punitive that it must be considered \ncriminal [citations omitted]. We disagree. Some provisions of the Bill of Rights are \nexpressly limited to criminal cases. The Fifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination \nClause, for example, provides: \"No person ... shall be compelled in any criminal \ncase to  be a witness  against himself.\" The protections provided by the  Sixth \nAmendment are explicitly confined to \"criminal prosecutions.\" [Citation omitted]. \nThe text of the Eighth Amendment includes no similar limitation. Nor does the \nhistory of the Eighth Amendment require such a limitation ... \nAustin, 509 U.S. at 608. \nThe Supreme Court further opined that provisions of civil forfeiture were punitive \nbecause \"a civil sanction that cannot fairly be said soiely to serve a remedial purpose, but rather \ncah only be explained as also serving either retributive or deterrent purposes, is punishment, as \nwe have come to understand the term.\" Id. at 610 (emphasis in original).  Ultimately, the \nSupreme Court held that civil forfeiture constitutes \"payments to a sovereign as punishment for \nsome offense, and, as such, is subjectto the limitations of the Eighth Amendment excessive fines \nclause.\"  Id. at 622. \nThe Court's reasoning and holding in Austin has been affirmed by subsequent decisions. \nMost recently, in Timbs v. Indiana, the Supreme Court declined to overrule Austin: \"We thus \ndecline the State's invitation to reconsider our unanimous judgment in Austin that civil in \nrem forfeitures are fines for purposes .of the Eighth Amendment when they are at least partially \nI \nI \npunitive.\"  Timbs v. Indiana, 139 S. Ct. 682,690 (2019). \nI \nViolations of the Boise ordinances analyzed in Martin were misdemeanors, 920 F.3d at \nI \n603, so the.Ninth Circuit at times used the word \"criminal\" in its analysis.  However, a careful \nreading of Martin shows that this language was not a limitation on when the Eighth \nAmendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment applies.  The Ninth Circuit stated the \nbroad question that it was addressing was \"[D]oes the Cruel ahd Unusual Punishments Clause of \nPage 18 of35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 19 of 35\n·the Eighth Amendment preclude the enforcement of a statute prohibiting sleeping outside against \nhomeless individuals with no access to alternative shelter?\" Id at 615.  The Ninth Circuit held \nthat it does, quoting Jones, \"the Eighth Amendment prohibits the state from punishing an \ninvoluntary act or condition if it is the unavoidable consequence of one's status or being.\" Id. at \n616.  It is the punishment of a person's unavoidable status that violates the constitution, not \nwhether that punishment is designated civil or criminal.  See id  The main difference between \nGrants Pass' punishment scheme and that of Boise's in Martin is that Grants Pass first issues \nfines for violations and then either issues a trespass order or excludes persons from all parks \nbefore a person is charged with misdemeanor criminal trespass.  This makes no difference for \nEight Amendment purposes because the result, in Boise and Grants Pass, is identical: \ninvoluntarily homeless people are punished for engaging in the unavoidable acts of sleeping or \nresting in a public place when they have nowhere else to go. \nAdditionally, as the Supreme Court noted, \"whether a particular statutorily defined \npenalty is civil or criminal is a matter of statutory construction.\"  United States v.  Ward, 448 U.S. \n242, 248 (1980).  In Oregon, violations are defined as criminal actions and are prosecuted in \ncriminal proceedings.  ORS 131.005(6)-(7).  The Grants Pass Municipal Code uses the language \nand procedures of criminal law, discussing those \"guilty\" of code violations.  GPMC \n1.36.0l0(A).  The violations are prosecuted in the Josephine County Circuit Court by the \nJosephine County District Attorney's office.  ORS 153.076(6).  As in a criminal trial, a \ndefendant may not be compelled to testify and the same pretrial discovery that applies in \nmisdemeanor and felony cases applies.  ORS 153.076(3)-(4).  The judgment from a camping \nviolation in Grants Pass reads, \"[t]he court finds the defendant GUILTY of the charges \nPage 19 of35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 20 of 35\ndesignated CONVICTED in the section below.\"  Edward Johnson Deel., Ex. 9 at 3-4 (Dkt#63-\n9). \nMoreover, even if Martin and the Eighth Amendment were limited to \"criminal\" \npunishments, which they are.not, Grants Pass' enforcement scheme involves criminal \npunishment.  Violations fqr sleeping and \"camping\" are an element offuture Criminal Trespass \nII arrests and initiate the criminal process in two common circumstances: (1) after a person is \n\"trespassed\" from an area for \"camping\" and either.does not leave or returns, or (2) after an \nofficer excludes a person from a park for prohibited camping.  In either situation, if that person \ndoes not move along or returns to the location, they are subject to arrest and prosecution for \nCriminal Trespass II. The criminalprocess is initiated w,ith the original citation and that citation \nis an element of the subsequent criminal trespass charge once the person is trespassed or \nexcluded under threat of arrest for criminal 'trespassing·. \nTherefore, Grants Pass' enforcement scheme is subJect to Eighth Amendment analysis. \nUnder such analysis, the ordinances at issue and their enforcement, as applied to plaintiff class \nmembers, violate the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment. \nII.  Grants Pass' policy and practice of enforcing the ordinances at issue violates the \nExcessive Fines Clause of the Eight Amendment. \nGrants Pass' enforcement of the ordinances at issue also violates the Excessive Fines \nClause of the Eighth Amendment.  The Supreme Court has found that the phrase \"nor excessive. \nfines imposed,\" in the Eighth Amendment \"limits the government's power to extract payments, \nwhether in cash or in kind, 'as punishment for some offense.\"'  Timbs v. Indiana, 139 S.Ct. 682, \n687 (2019) citing United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321, 327-328, (1998).  There is a two \nstep inquiry in analyzing an excessive fines claim: (1) is the fine punitive, and if so, (2) is it \n.excessive?  Bajakajian, 524 U.S. at 334. \nPage 20 of 35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 21 of 35\nTo determine when a fine is punitive, courts look to whether the fine is tied to \npunishment and prohibited conduct.  Bajakajian, 524 U.S. at 328; Austin, 509 U.S. at 619-22; \nSee also U.S. v. Mackby, 339 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir. 2003) (assuming a statutory fine under the False \nClaims Act imposed after a finding of liability in a civil trial was punitive).  It does not matter if \nthe fine imposed is characterized as criminal or civil, the salient inquiry is whether the fine at \nleast partially serves the traditional punitive functions of retribution and deterrence.  Austin, 509 \nU.S. at 610.  For example, in Wright v. Rive land, the Ninth Circuit held that a 5% deduction for \nthe Crime Victim's Compensation Fund was punitive because there was no relationship between \nthe deduction and the harm the defendant caused.  Wright v. Riveland, 219 F.3d 905,915 (9th Cir. \n2000); see also Dept. ofR  evenue ofM  ontana v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U.S. 767, 778 (1994) \n( observing the similarities between civil and criminal punishment, the court held \"Criminal fines, \ncivil penalties, civil forfeitures, and taxes all share certain features: They generate government \nrevenues, impose fiscal burdens on individuals, and deter certain behavior.\").  The Supreme \nCourt has held that all civil penalties have some deterrent effect. U.S. v Hudson, 522 U.S. 93, \n102 (1997). \nIn this case, the Court finds that the fines imposed for violating the ordinances at issue \nare punitive.  According to the record, the two camping ordinances carry a mandatory fine of \n$295.  The fine for illegal sleeping is $75.  When unpaid, the fines increase to $537.60 and $160 \nrespectively because of additional \"collection fees.\"  Johnson Deel., Ex. 9 at 5-6 (Dkt. #63-9). \nOfficers have the discretion to issue warnings prior to issuing a citation, but once a citation is \nissued, officers have no discretion over the amount of the fine, which is \"autofilled\" into all \ncamping citations.  Johnson Deel., Ex. 6, Burge Depo. at 20, lines 15-21 (Dkt. #63-6); Ex. 4, \nHamilton Depo at p. 84 line 23 top. 85 line 5 (Dkt. #63-4).  Based on the record and minutes \nPage 21 of35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 22 of 35\nfrom the 2013 Roundtable Meeting, these statutory fines serve no remedial purpose and w~re \nintended to deter homeless individuals from residing in Grants Pass.  Moreover, the ordinances \nthemselves describe these fines as punishment.  Compare GPMC 1.36.0l0(c) (\"MAXIMUM \nFINE: except in cases where a different punishment is prescribed by any provision of this · \nCode ... '') with GPMC 1.36.0I0(e) (allowing for restitutiop. to any person, or business, including \nthe city, who has been damaged by the defendant's conduct). \nBecause the fines are punitive, the inquiry turns to whether the fines are excessive.  The \nSupreme Court held that a fine violates the excessiveness standard of the Eighth Amendment if \nthe amount of the fine is \"grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the offense.\" Bajakajian, 524 \nU.S. at 324, 334 (\"The touchstone of the constitutional inquiry under the Excessive Fines Clause \nis the principle of proportionality: The amount of the forfeiture must bear some relationship to \nthe gravity of the offense that it is designed to punish.\"); see also Wright v. Rivel and, 219 'F .3d \n905, 916 (9th Cir. 2000) (following Bajakajian).  In applying this standard, courts have looked to \na non-exhaustive list,of several factors, including the nature of the offense, whether the violation \nwas related to other illegal activity, and other penalties that may be imposed.11  See generally \nU.S. v. Mackby, 3.39 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir. 2003). \nHere, the decisiv~ consideration is that Plaintiffs are being punished for engaging in the \nunavoidable, biological, life-sustaining acts of sleeping and resting while also trying to stay \nwarm and dry.  Plaintiffs do not have enough money to obtain shelter, so they likely cannot pay \nthese fines.  When the fines remain unpaid, the additional collection fees are applied and the \n_; \nfines still remain unpaid; subjecting plaintiffs to collection efforts, the threat of driver license \nll The Supreme Court has left open the question of whether the ability to pay the fine would be relevant to · \nthe excessiveness inquiry. Bajakajian at 340, n.15; see also Timbs at 688 quoting 4 W. Blackstone, \nCommentaries on the Laws of England 372 (1769) \"[N]o man shall have a larger amercement imposed \nupon him, than his circumstances or personal estate will bear ....\"  \n· Page 22 of 35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 23 of 35\nsuspensions (Johnson Deel., Ex. 9 at 3-4 (Dkt. #63-9)), and damaged credit that makes it even \n· more difficult for them to find housing, exacerbating the homeless problem in Grants Pass \n(Wessels Dec. ,r11 (Dkt #65)).  As the Supreme Court recognized in the cruel and unusual \npunishment context, \"even one day in prison would be cruel and unusual punishment for the \n'crime' of having a common cold.\"  Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660,667 (1962).  So too \nhere.  Fining a homeless person in Grants Pass who must sleep outside beneath a l;,lanket because \nthey cannot find shelter $295 ($537.60 after collection fees are inevitably assessed) is grossly \ndisproportionate to the \"gravity of the offense.\"  Any fine is excessive if it is imposed on the \nbasis of status and not conduct.  For Plaintiffs, the conduct for which they face punishment is \ninseparable from their status as homeless individuals, and therefore, beyond what the City may \nconstitutionally punish.  The fines associated with violating the ordinances at issue, as applied to \nPlaintiffs, are unconstitutionally excessive. \nHaving found that the ordinances violate the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause as \nwell as the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eight Amendment, the Court declines to decide \nwhether the ordinances are also unconstitutionally vague. \nIII.  · The appeal process for park exclusions in Grants Pass violates procedural due \nprocess rights. \na.  Plaintiffs' claim that park exclusions violate procedural due process was \n· adequately pied and standing bas been established. \nGrants Pass does not challenge the merits of plaintiffs' procedural due process claim \nregarding the City's park exclusion ordinance in its response to Plaintiffs' motion for summary \njudgment.  Instead, Grants Pass argues that this claim was not properly pled in the operative \ncomplaint.  The Court disagrees.  This claim seems to be the sole reason for the Third Amended \nComplaint filed on November 13, 2019.  (Dkt. #50).  The only changes from the Second \nI \nAmended Complaint were to add the allegation.at  paragraph 87 that, \"Plaintiffs have been \n!  Page 23 of 35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 24 of 35\n· excluded from Grants Pass parks without due process oflaw\" and to specifically add \"GPMC \n6.46.350 (the park exclusion ordinance)\" to the injunctive and declaratory relief sought in this \n,r  ,r,r \ncase.  Third Amended Complaint  87, Prayer  3-4 (Dkt. #50).  Although the City correctly \npoints out that GPMC 6.46.355 (the ordinance that explains the appeal procedure) is missing \nfrom the operative complaint, Plaintiffs made clear that they were challenging park exclusions \nunder the Procedural Due Process Clause.  The City did not object to the amendment or ask that \nit be clarified or made more specific.  Therefore, the claim was pled, and the City was on notice. \nSecond, Grants Pass argues that if the claim was ·pled, it should be dismissed because \nPlaintiffs have. not alleged or sufficiently established standing.  The City argues, \"plaintiffs do \nnot even attempt to produce a plaintiff or rely upon any individual's standing.\" Response at 51 \n(Dkt. #80).  The Court disagrees.  The record shows that of the 59 park exclusions produced to \nPlaintiffs by the City, all were issued to homeless individuals and 42 were issued for illegal \n,r \ncamping.  Pltf.s' Motion at 22 (Dkt. #62); Inessa Wurscher Deel.  7 (Dkt. #64).  Class \nrepresentative Debra Blake was issued an exclusion on September 11, 2019, after she was found \nsleeping in a City Park, and a copy of that exclusion order has been provided in the record. \nJohnson Deel., Ex. 9-at 7 (Dkt. #63-9).  Debra Blake filed a written objection to her September \n11, 2019 banishment from all parks.  The ban was \"lifted\" without explanation on September 25, \n,r \n2019, after half of the exclusion period had expired.  Blake Deel.  8 (Dkt. #90).  Additionally,. \nclass member Dolores Nevin was excluded from all parks after being found sleeping in Riverside \nPark on December 31, 2019.  Wurscher Deel., Ex. 1 at 33-35 (Dkt. #64-1).  Moreover, Plaintiffs \nprovided evidence that a park exclusion goes into effect immediately and is not stayed when \nappealed.  Johnson Deel., Ex. 5, McGinnis Depo p. 28 line 23 top. 29 line 5 (Dkt. #63-5); Ex. 4, \nPage 24 of 35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 25 of 35\nHamilton Depo. at p.117 lines 11-14 (Dkt. #63-4).  Therefore, Plaintiffs have standing to seek \nprospective declaratory and injunctive relief regarding the park exclusion appeal process. \nFinally, Grants Pass argues in a footnote that if the claim was pled and plaintiffs do have \nstanding, the claim is \"moot\" because the current practice of the Grants Pass Department of \n' \nPublic Safety is to not issue park exclusions until City Council \"has made appropriate revisions.\" \nResponse at 51, n.8 (Dkt. #80).  Evidence presented by Grants Pass to show this policy change \nconsists of a sworn declaration from Jim Hamilton, the Deputy Chief for the City of Grants Pass \nDepartment of Public Safety, in which he declares, \"The current practice is that there are.no park \nexclusions being issued by anyone in the Grants Pass Department of Public Safety by way of \nwritten Order from me. Unless and until a revised version of the park exclusion ordinance is \nadopted by the City council and the related forms revised, they will not be issued.\" Hamilton \nDeel. 13 (Dkt. #83).  The written order issued to the department was not attached as an exhibit. \nHowever, even if it was, policy changes not reflected in a change to statutes or ordinances does \nnot render.a claim moot.  Rosebrock, 745 F.3d at 971-72.  The doctrine of voluntary cessation  . \nhas been interpreted to apply generally in cases in which an injunction is sought. \"Such cases do . \nnot become moot 'merely because the [defendant's] conduct immediately complained of has \nterminated, if there is a possibility of a recurrence which would be within the terms of a proper \ndecree.\"' Armster v.  US. District Court for the Central District ofC  alifornia, 806 F.2d 1347, \n1357 (9th Cir. 1986) (quoting P. Bator, P. Mishkin, D. Shapiro & H. Wechsler, Hart & \nWechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System 110 (2d ed. 1973)).  This is particularly \ntrue, whereas here, the \"new policy. .. could be easily abandoned or altered in the future.\"  Bell, \n709 F.3d at 901.  If a municipal defendant could moot out claims simply by announcing in its \ncross-motion for summary judgment that it has decided not to enforce the offending ordinance, \nPage 25 of 35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 26 of 35\nthe doctrine of voluntary cessation would be rendered meaningless.  Plaintiffs pled this claim, \n.  .  I \nl \nhave standing to assert it, and Grants Pass cannot mo.ot this claim by asserting that it has \nI \ntemporarily stopped issuing park exclusions. \nI \nI \nb.  Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on this claim. \nI \nUnder Grants Pass' enforcement scheme, police officers may issue a written exclusion \norder barring an individual \"from all city park properties for a period of 30 days, if within a one \nyear period the individual is issued two or more citations for violating regulations related to city \npark properties, or is iss_ued one or more citations for violating any state law(s) while on city park \nproperty.\"  GPMC·6.46.350.  A park exclusion goes into effect immediately upon being issued \nand is not stayed while a person appeals.  Johnson Deel., Ex. 5, McGinnis Depo p. 28 line 23 to \np. 29 line 5 (Dkt. #63-5); Ex. 4, Hamilton Depo. at p.117 lines 11-14 (Dkt. #63-4); GPMC \n6.46.355. The appeal period is \"within two business days\" and the method of appeal is by \n\"written objection\" to the City Manager, at which point the objection will be placed on the City \nCouncil's agenda.  GPMC 6._46.355. \nSixteen years ago, this Court found a substantially identical appeal process in Portland's \npark exclusion ordinance to violate procedural due process rights .. \nThe risk of erroneous deprivation is compounded by PCC 20.12:265's deficient \nappeal procedures and lack of a pre-deprivation hearing. An exclusion takes effect \nimmediately upon  issuance and  is  not stayed pending ·a ppeal.  Thus,  a person \n· excluded from a park is subject to ·a rrest for reentry as soon as she receives the \nexclusion notice.  An appeal may be filed  within. five  days,  but the individual \ncontinues to be excluded from the parks. Thus, even if the exclusion is ultimately \nfound t0 be invalid, the individual has been kept from the public park(s) for at.least \na significant portion of the thirty days. \nYeakle v, City ofP  ortland, 322 F. Supp. 2d 1119, 1130 (D. Or. 2004). For the same reasons, \nGrants Pass' park exclusion ordinance is also unconstitutional and violates the procedural \nprotections of the due process clause. \nPage 26 of35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 27 of 35\nThe Yeakle court applied the three-part balancing test from Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 \nU.S. 319, 335 (1976) to Portland's functionally identical park exclusion appeal process.  The \ncourt found that excluded individuals have a strong liberty interest in avoiding unjust exclusion \nbecause of the importance of public parks as a \"treasured and unmatched resource\" for members \nof the public.  322 F. Supp 2d at 1129.  In this case, that interestis even greater for Plaintiffs \nbecause several parks in Grants Pass contain benches, tables and restrooms that homeless \nindividuals may use for basic activities of daily life when they have no alternative place to dwell. \nThe court also found that \"the risk of erroneous deprivation under the present procedure is \nconsiderable\" given the lack of pre-deprivation process and the lack of \"any evidentiary \nstandard.\"  Id at 1130.  The same is true here.  There is no requirement in the ordinance that the \nGrants Pass police officer have enough evidepce or reasonable suspicion of the excludable \nconduct to issue an exclusion or make an arrest.  The officer need not witness the violation or \nhave any other reliable information that a violation occurred under the language of the ordinance. \nFurther, just like in Yeakle, \"a person is subject to arrest for reentry as soon as she receives the \nexclusion notice\" and \"even if the exclusion is ultimately found to be invalid, the individual has \nbeen kept from the public parks for at least a significant portion. o f the thirty days.\" Id.  The \nYeakle Court concluded that \"a pre-deprivation hearing or other procedural safeguard would not \nunduly burden the government\" and \"there would be no additional burden on the City if the park \nexclusions were simply stayed in the event that an individual filed an appeal.\"  Id at 1131.  For \nthe same reasons, the procedures for appealing park exclusions in Grants Pass violatePlaintiffs' \nprocedural due process rights. \nPage 27 of35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 28 of 35\nIV.  Plaintiffs are denied summary judgment on their Equal Protection Claim. \nThe Equal Protection Clause guarantees that \"all persons similarly circumstanced shall be \ntreated alike.\"  Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202,216 (1982).  Plaintiffs allege selective enforcement \nof the ordinances at issue.  As such, they \"must demcmstrate that enforcement_ had a \n. discriminatory effect and the police were motivated by a discriminatory purpose.\"  Rosenbaum v. \nCity and County ofS an Francisco, 484 F.3d 1142, 1152 (9th Cir. 2007).  Further, because the \nclass seeks to enjoin enforcement, they must demonstrate that the selective enforcement \"is part \nof a 'policy, plan, or a pervasive pattern.\"' Id. at 1153 ( quoting Thomas v. County ofL os · \nAngeles, 978 F.2d 504, 509 (9th Cir. 1993)). \nPlaintiffs did not carry their burden of demonstrating that the City's ordinances were \nselectively enforced and that enforcement was motivated by a discriminatory purpose under the \nsummary judgment standard.  The evidence relied on by Plaintiffs to prove this claim are the \n·I \ni \nminutes from the 2013 Roundtable Meeting and deposition testimony from two Grants Pass \nI \npolice officers.  The City disputes this evidence as proof of selective enforcement.  The City \nargues that deposition testimony from two knowledgeable police officers that they \"could not \nremember\" enforcing these ordinances against a non-homeless individual is not enough for the \nCourt to conclude that these ordinances were selectively enforced as a matter of law.  The Court \nagrees.  Moreover, the City provided its Department of Public Safety Policy Manual, which \nspecifically includes instructions to officers to not discriminate against homeless individuals. \nSee Hamilton Deel., Ex. 1 (Dkt. #83-1).  Therefore, facts surrounding the issues of whether the \nCity's enforcement scheme had a discriminatory effect and whether the police were motivated by \na discriminatory purpose are in dispute.  As a result, Plaintiffs are denied summary judgment on \n· their equal protection claim. \nPage 28 of35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 29 of 35\nV.  Plaintifrs are denied summary judgment on their Substantive Due Process Claim. \nThe substantive due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids the government \nfrom depriving a person oflife, liberty, or property when the government acts with deliberate \nindifference or reckless disregard for that person's fundamental rights.  Tennison v. City & \nCounty ofS .F., 570 F.3d 1078, 1089 (9th Cir. 2009); Porter v. Osborn, 546 F.3d 1131, 1137-39 \n(9th Cir. 2008).  A plaintiff establishes a substantive due process violation by showing the \ndefendant deprived him of his life, liberty, or property and engaged in \"conscience shocking. \nbehavior.\" Brittain v. Hansen, 451 F.3d 982,991 (9th Cir. . 2006).  An official's conduct may \nshock the conscience where the official acts with deliberate indifference or reckless disregard for \nthe plaintiff's rights in situations where the official had the opportunity to deliberate.  Tennison, \n570 F.3d at 1089; Porter, 546 F.3d atl 137-39. \nPlaintiffs argue they have a protected liberty interest in being present in public spaces in \nGrants Pass.  Plaintiffs cite Morales, which found \"it is apparent that an individual's decision to \nremain in a public place of his choice is as much a part of his liberty as the freedom of movement \ninside frontiers that is 'a part of our heritage,' or the right to move 'to whatsoever place one's \nown inclination may direct' identified in Blackstone's Commentaries.\"  27 U.S. at 53:.54 (citing \nWilliams v. Fears, 179 U.S. 270,274 (1900); Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 164 \n(1972); Kentv: Dulles, 357 U.S. 116, 126 (1958); 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws \nof England 130 (1765)).  At least three Courts of Appeals have followed Morales and \nacknowledged a Hberty interest to remain in a place open to the public.  See Vincent v. City of \nSulphur, 805 F.3d 543, 548 (5th Cir. 2015) (\"Supreme Court decisions amply support the \nproposition that there is a general right to go to or remain on public property for lawful purposes \n....\" ); Catron v. City ofS t. Petersburg, 658 F.3d 1260, 1266 (11th Cir. 2011) (\"Plaintiffs have a \nPage 29 of35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 30 of 35\nconstitutionally protected liberty interest to be in parks or on other city lands of their choosing \nthat are open to the public generally.\"); Kennedy v. City ofC  incinnati, 595 F.3d 327, 336 (6th \nCir. 2010) (\"[I]t is clear that Kennedy had a liberty interest 'to remain in a public place of his \n. \n. \nchoice' and that defendants interfered with this interest.\"). \nHowever, even if this Court were to find that Plaintiffs have a liberty interest to remain in \nCity parks or other City lands that are open to the public generally, Plaintiffs have not provided \nthis Court with controlling authority to convince the Court that Plaintiffs have a liberty interest to \nsleep or camp in a public place.  Moreover, Plaintiffs have not carried their burden of showing \nthat the City engaged in \"conscience shocking behavior\" under the summary judgment standard. \nThis Court's holding that the enforcement of Grants Pass' ordinances violate the Eight \nAmendment does not automatically translate to a finding that Grants Pass officials acted with \ndeliberate indifference or reckless disregard for Plaintiffs' fundamental rights.  Whether Grants \nPass' conduct shocks_ the conscience is a question of material fact.  Therefore, Plaintiffs are \ni \ndenied summary judgment on their substantive due process claim. ·  I \nI \nVI.  Conclusion \nThe holding in this case does not say that Grants Pass must allow homeless camps to be \n' \nset up at all times in public parks.  Just like in Martin, this holding in no way dictates to a local \ngovernment that it must provide sufficient shelter for the homeless,. or allow anyone who wishes \nto sit, lie, or sleep on the street at any time and at any place.  See Martin, 920 F.3d 584, 6_17.  Nor \ndoes this holding \"cover individuals who do have access to adequate temporary shelter, whether \nthey have the means to pay for it or because it is realistically available to them for free, but who \nchoose not to use it.\"  Id at n. 8.  The City may implement time and place restrictions for when \nhomeless individuals may use their belongings to keep warm and dry and when they must have \ntheir belonging packed up.· The City may also implement an anti-camping ordinance that is more \nPage 30 of 35 OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01823-CL    Document 111    Filed 07/22/20    Page 31 of 35\nspecific than the one in place now.  For example, the City may ban the use of tents in public \nparks without going so far as to ban people from using any bedding type materials to keep warm \nand dry while they sleep.  The City may also consider limiting the amount of bedding type \nmaterials allowed per individual in public places.  Moreover, this holding does not limit Grants \nPass' ability to enforce laws that actually further public health and safety, such as laws restricting \nlittering, public urination or defecation, obstruction of roadways, possession or distribution of \nillicit substances, harassment, or violence.  Grants Pass would retain a large toolbox for. \nregulating public space without violating the Eight Amendment. \nThere is no doubt that homelessness is a serious public health concern.  Homeless \nindividuals have higher rates of chronic physical and mental health conditions, increased rates of \nmortality, and related diseases and co-occurring disorders.12  With the lack of access to the most \nbasic of human needs, including running water, toilets, and trash disposal, infectious diseases \nlike COVID-19-can spread quickly.  Uprooting homeless individuals, without providing them \nwith basic sanitation and waste disposal needs, does nothing more than shift a public health crisis \nfrom one location to another, potentially endangering the health of the public in both locations. \nThis concern is particularly acute during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

It has \nbeen prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 3 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    3 \npermanent  injunction  in  favor  of  plaintiffs;  affirmed \ncertification pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), of a class \nof “involuntary homeless” persons; and remanded. \nThe five municipal ordinances, described as an “anti-\nsleeping”  ordinance,  two  “anti-camping”  ordinances,  a \n“park exclusion” ordinance, and a “park exclusion appeals” \nordinance, result in civil fines up to several hundred dollars \nper violation.  Persons found to violate ordinances multiple \ntimes could be barred from all City property.  If a homeless \nperson is found on City property after receiving an exclusion \norder, they are subject to criminal prosecution for trespass.     \nThe panel stated that this court’s decision in Martin v. \nCity of Boise, 902 F.3d 1031 (9th Cir. 2018), which held that \n“the Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of criminal \npenalties for sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public \nproperty  for  homeless  individuals  who  cannot  obtain \nshelter”  served  as  the  backdrop  for  this  entire \nlitigation.  Pursuant to Martin, it is an Eight Amendment \nviolation  to  criminally  punish  involuntarily  homeless \npersons for sleeping in public if there are no other public \nareas or appropriate shelters where those individuals can \nsleep.  \nThe panel first rejected the City’s argument that the \ndistrict court lacked jurisdiction because plaintiffs’ claims \nwere moot or because plaintiffs failed to identify any relief \nthat was within a federal court’s power to redress.  The panel \nheld  that  there  was  abundant  evidence  in  the  record \nestablishing that homeless persons were injured by the City’s \nenforcement actions in the past and it was undisputed that \nenforcements have continued. The panel further held that the \nrelief sought by plaintiffs, enjoining enforcement of a few \nmunicipal  ordinances  aimed  at  involuntary  homeless \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 4 of 155\n4  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \npersons, was redressable within the limits of Article III.  The \ndeath of class representative Debra Blake while the matter \nwas on appeal did not moot the class’s claims as to all \nchallenged  ordinances  except  possibly  the  anti-sleeping \nordinance.  The panel vacated the summary judgment as to \nthat ordinance and remanded to allow the district court the \nopportunity to substitute a class representative in Blake’s \nstead.  The remaining class representatives had standing to \nchallenge the park exclusion, criminal trespass and anti-\ncamping ordinances.   \nThe panel held that, based on the record in this case, the \ndistrict court did not err by finding plaintiffs satisfied the \nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) such that a class could \nbe  certified  under  Rule  23(b)(2).   Although  the  City \nappeared to suggest that Martin’s need for an individualized \ninquiry  of  each  alleged  involuntary  homeless  person’s \naccess  to  shelter  defeated  numerosity,  commonality  and \ntypicality, the panel held that nothing in Martin precluded \nclass actions.  The panel held that the district court did not \nabuse  its  discretion  in  concluding  the  numerosity \nrequirement was met; that plaintiffs’ claims presented at \nleast one question and answer common to the class; and that \nthe class representatives’ claims and defenses were typical \nof the class in that they were homeless persons who claimed \nthat the City could not enforce the challenged ordinances \nagainst them when they have no shelter. \nAddressing the merits, the panel affirmed the district \ncourt’s  ruling  that  the  City  of  Grants  Pass  could  not, \nconsistent with the Eighth Amendment, enforce its anti-\ncamping ordinances against homeless persons for the mere \nact of sleeping outside with rudimentary protection from the \nelements, or for sleeping in their car at night, when there was \nno other place in the City for them to go.  The panel held that \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 5 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    5 \nMartin applied to civil citations where, as here, the civil and \ncriminal punishments were closely intertwined.   \nThere was no need to resolve whether the fines imposed \nunder  the  anti-sleeping  and  anti-camping  ordinances \nviolated the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on excessive \nfines because the permanent injunction would result in no \nclass member being fined for engaging in such protected \nactivity.  Finally, the panel held that it was unnecessary to \ndecide whether plaintiffs properly pled their procedural due \nprocess challenge to the park exclusion appeals ordinance \nbecause subsequent to the district court’s order, the City \namended the ordinance.   \nThe panel directed the district court on remand to narrow \nits  injunction  to  enjoin  only  those  portions  of  the  anti-\ncamping ordinances that prohibited conduct protected by \nMartin and this opinion.  In particular, the district court \nshould narrow its injunction to the anti-camping ordinances \nand enjoin enforcement of those ordinances only against \ninvoluntarily  homeless  persons  for  engaging  in  conduct \nnecessary to protect themselves from the elements when \nthere was no shelter space available.   \nDissenting, Judge Collins stated that Martin seriously \nmisconstrued  the  Eighth  Amendment  and  the  Supreme \nCourt’s caselaw construing it, but even assuming that Martin \nremains good law, today’s decision—which both misreads \nand  greatly  expands  Martin’s  holding—is  egregiously \nwrong. Although the majority’s phrasing pays lip service to \nthe fact that the persons at issue must be “involuntarily \nhomeless,” the majority also explicitly rejects the City’s \ncontention that the holding of Martin can only be applied \nafter an individualized inquiry of each alleged involuntary \nhomeless person’s access to shelter.  The net result, for class \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 6 of 155\n6  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \ncertification purposes, is that any issue of individualized \ninvoluntariness is set aside and Martin is thereby reduced to \na simplistic formula to be resolved on a classwide basis—\ninto  whether  the  number  of  homeless  persons  in  the \njurisdiction  exceeds  the  number  of  available  shelter \nbeds.  The majority’s analysis fails because Martin does not \nallow the individualized inquiry into involuntariness to be \nset aside in this way.  Further, the majority opinion combines \nits  gross  misreading  of  Martin,  which  requires  an \nindividualized inquiry, with a flagrant disregard of settled \nclass-certification  principles  pertaining  to  commonality \nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and the requirements of Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(b).  The end result of this amalgamation of error \nis that the majority validates the core aspects of the district \ncourt’s injunction in this case, which effectively requires the \nCity of Grants Pass to allow all but one of its public parks to \nbe used as homeless encampments. \nIn a joint statement regarding the denial of rehearing, \nDistrict Judge Silver and Judge Gould wrote that Judge \nO’Scannlain’s statement regarding the denial of rehearing \nand  the  dissent  from  Judge  M.  Smith  significantly \nexaggerate the holding in Johnson v. Grants Pass.  Grants \nPass, relying on Martin, holds only that governments cannot \ncriminalize the act of sleeping with the use of rudimentary \nprotections from the elements in some public places when a \nperson has nowhere else to sleep. It does not establish an \nunrestrained  right  for  involuntarily  homeless  persons  to \nsleep  anywhere  they  choose.   Nor  does  it  require \njurisdictions  to  cede  all  public  spaces  to  involuntarily \nhomeless persons.  Judges Silver and Gould also explained \nthat class certification was proper, that the commonality \nrequirement  was  met,  that  the  majority  applied  existing \nSupreme Court and Ninth Circuit authority to the record \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 7 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    7 \npresented by the parties, and that Judge O’Scannlain greatly \noverstated the extent to which Martin and Grants Pass fall \non one side of an existing circuit split. \nRespecting  the  denial  of  rehearing  en  banc,  Judge \nO’Scannlain,  joined  by  Judges  Wallace,  Callahan,  Bea, \nIkuta, Bennett, R. Nelson, Bade, Collins, Lee, Bress, Forrest, \nBumatay, and VanDyke, and with whom Judge M. Smith \njoins as to all parts except Part II-A, states that with this \ndecision,  this  Circuit’s  jurisprudence  now  effectively \nguarantees  a  personal  federal  constitutional  ‘right’  for \nindividuals to camp or to sleep on sidewalks and in parks, \nplaygrounds,  and  other  public  places  in  defiance  of \ntraditional  health,  safety,  and  welfare  laws—a  dubious \nholding premised on a fanciful interpretation of the Eighth \nAmendment.  Judge O’Scannlain writes that the Boise panel \nmade no effort to ground its decision in the text, history, or \ntradition  of  the  Eighth  Amendment.   Unfortunately,  the \nproblems created by Boise have now been visited upon the \nCity of Grants Pass by the panel majority here, which has \nexpanded  Boise’s  faulty  holding  to  affirm  an  injunction \neffectively requiring the City to resign all but one of its \npublic parks to be used as homeless encampments.  This \nCircuit is the first and only federal circuit to have divined \nsuch a strange and sweeping mandate from the Cruel and \nUnusual Punishments Clause.  The jurisprudence in this case \nis egregiously flawed and deeply damaging—at war with \nconstitutional text, history, tradition, and Supreme Court \nprecedent.  And it conflicts with other circuits on a question \nof exceptional importance—paralyzing local communities \nfrom addressing the pressing issue of homelessness, and \nseizing policymaking authority that the federal system of \ngovernment leaves to the democratic process.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 8 of 155\n8  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nRespecting the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge Graber \nagreed  with  the  basic  legal  premise  that  the  Eighth \nAmendment protects  against criminal prosecution of the \ninvoluntary act of sleeping but stated that the injunctive \nrelief in this case goes too far.  The extension of Martin to \nclasswide relief, enjoining civil statutes that may eventually \nlead  to  criminal  violations  but  have  never  resulted  in \ncriminal convictions for any named plaintiff, is a step too far \nfrom the individualized inquiries inherent both in the Eighth \nAmendment  context  and  in  the  context  of  injunctive \nrelief.  Even assuming that classwide injunctive relief were \navailable against a prosecution for criminal trespass, the \nEighth Amendment does not prohibit all civil remedies that \ncould, in theory, lead to such a prosecution.  In this way, \nJohnson  unjustifiably  expands  the  reach  of  the  Eighth \nAmendment. \nDissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge \nM.  Smith,  joined  by  Judges  Bennett,  Bumatay,  and \nVanDyke, and with whom Judges Ikuta, R. Nelson, Bade, \nCollins and Bress join as to Parts I and II, stated that Martin \ncannot  be  squared  with  the  Supreme  Court’s  Eighth \nAmendment precedent; that the amendment to the original \nopinion is not accompanied by any downstream changes to \nthe  majority’s  application  of  its  rule  to  the  facts  or  its \nultimate conclusion; and that by wholly collapsing the merits \ninto the class definition, the majority opinion certifies an \nimpermissible  “fail  safe”  class.   Local  governments  are \nhard-pressed to find any way to regulate the adverse health \nand  safety  effects  of  homeless  encampments  without \nrunning afoul of this court’s case law—or, at a minimum, \nbeing saddled with litigation costs.  Judge M. Smith states \nthat Martin, particularly now that it has been supercharged \nby Grants Pass, has proven to be a runaway train that has \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 9 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    9 \nderailed  and  done  substantial  collateral  damage  to  the \ngovernmental units in which it has been applied and those \nliving therein.  These cases use a misreading of Supreme \nCourt precedent to require unelected federal judges—often \non  the  basis  of  sloppy,  mixed  preliminary-injunction \nrecords—to act more like homelessness policy czars than as \nArticle III judges applying a discernible rule of law.   \nDissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge \nCollins  states  that  the  panel  majority’s  joint  statement \nregarding the denial of rehearing confirms and illustrates the \nlayers of self-contradiction that underlie its opinion in this \ncase, and that the panel majority is wrong to suggest that a \nnewly enacted Oregon statute regulating the application of \nlocal ordinances to homeless individuals provides another \nreason to not rehear this case en banc.  \nDissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge \nBress, joined by Judges Callahan, M. Smith, Ikuta, Bennett, \nR.  Nelson,  Miller,  Bade,  Lee,  Forrest,  Bumatay  and \nVanDyke, states that with no mooring in the text of the \nConstitution, our history and traditions, or the precedent of \nthe Supreme Court, the court has taken our national founding \ndocument and used it to enact judge-made rules governing \nwho can sit and sleep where, rules whose ill effects are felt \nnot merely by the States, and not merely by our cities, but \nblock  by  block,  building  by  building,  doorway  by \ndoorway.  Local leaders—and the people who elect them—\nmust be allowed the latitude to address on the ground the \ndistinctly local features of the present crisis of homelessness \nand lack of affordable housing.  Not every challenge we face \nis constitutional in character.  Not every problem in our \ncountry has a legal answer that judges can provide.  This is \none of those situations.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 10 of 155\n10  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nCOUNSEL \nAaron P.

CITY OF GRANTS PASS    13 \nOPINION \nSILVER, District Judge: \nThe  City  of  Grants  Pass  in  southern  Oregon  has  a \npopulation of approximately 38,000.  At least fifty, and \nperhaps as many as 600, homeless persons live in the City.1  \nAnd  the  number  of  homeless  persons  outnumber  the \navailable shelter beds.  In other words, homeless persons \nhave nowhere to shelter and sleep in the City other than on \nthe  streets  or  in  parks.    Nonetheless,  City  ordinances \npreclude homeless persons from using a blanket, a pillow, or \na cardboard box for protection from the elements while \nsleeping within the City’s limits.  The ordinances result in \ncivil fines up to several hundred dollars per violation and \npersons found to violate ordinances multiple times can be \nbarred from all City property.  And if a homeless person is \nfound on City property after receiving an exclusion order, \nthey are subject to criminal prosecution for trespass.      \nIn September 2018, a three-judge panel issued Martin v. \nCity of Boise, 902 F.3d 1031 (9th Cir. 2018), holding “the \nEighth  Amendment  prohibits  the  imposition  of  criminal \npenalties for sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public \nproperty  for  homeless  individuals  who  cannot  obtain \nshelter.”  Id. at 1048.  Approximately six weeks after the \ninitial Martin panel opinion, three homeless individuals filed \na putative class action complaint against the City arguing a \nnumber  of  City  ordinances  were  unconstitutional.    The \ndistrict court certified a class of “involuntarily homeless” \n \n1 During this litigation the parties have used different phrases when \nreferring to this population.  For simplicity, we use “homeless persons” \nthroughout this opinion. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 14 of 155\n14  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \npersons and later granted partial summary judgment in favor \nof the class.2  After the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed some \nclaims not resolved at summary judgment, the district court \nissued  a  permanent  injunction  prohibiting  enforcement \nagainst  the  class  members  of  some  City  ordinances,  at \ncertain times, in certain places.  The City now appeals, \narguing this case is moot, the class should not have been \ncertified, the claims fail on the merits, and Plaintiffs did not \nadequately plead one of their theories.  On the material \naspects of this case, the district court was right.3 \n \n2 Persons are involuntarily homeless if they do not “have access to \nadequate temporary shelter, whether because they have the means to pay \nfor it or because it is realistically available to them for free.” See Martin, \n920 F.3d at 617 n.8.  However, someone who has the financial means to \nobtain shelter, or someone who is staying in an emergency shelter is not \ninvoluntarily homeless. See id. at 617 n.8.  Contrary to the City’s \nargument, this definition of involuntary homelessness is not the same as \nthe definition of “homeless” found in regulations for the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, 24 C.F.R. § 582.5, or the McKinney-\nVento Act, 42 U.S.C. § 11434a(2), the federal law regarding the right of \nhomeless children to a public education.  For example, the McKinney-\nVento Act includes as “homeless children and youths” persons who may \nnot qualify as involuntarily homeless under Martin, such as children and \nyouths “living in emergency or transitional shelters.”  42 U.S.C. § \n11434a(2).  Though the district court noted in part that Plaintiffs met the \ndefinition of homelessness set forth in 24 C.F.R. § 582.5, the district \ncourt also relied on the specific definition of unsheltered homeless \npersons  set  forth  in  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban \nDevelopment’s  regulations  regarding  point-in-time  counts:  “persons \nwho are living in a place not designed or ordinarily used as a regular \nsleeping accommodation for humans must be counted as unsheltered \nhomeless persons.”  24 C.F.R. § 578.7(c)(2)(i).   \n3 Our dissenting colleague’s strong disagreement with the majority \nlargely arises from his disapproval of Martin.  See, e.g., Dissent 56 \n(“Even assuming Martin remains good law . . .”); Dissent 90 (“. . . and \nthe gravity of Martin’s errors.”); Dissent 92 (claiming, without evidence, \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 15 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    15 \nI. \nThis case involves challenges to five provisions of the \nGrants Pass Municipal Code (“GPMC”).  The provisions can \nbe described as an “anti-sleeping” ordinance, two “anti-\ncamping” ordinances, a “park exclusion” ordinance, and a \n“park exclusion appeals” ordinance.  When the district court \nentered judgment, the various ordinances consisted of the \nfollowing.   \nFirst, the anti-sleeping ordinance stated, in full  \nSleeping on Sidewalks, Streets, Alleys, or \nWithin Doorways Prohibited \nA. No person may sleep on public sidewalks, \nstreets, or alleyways at any time as a matter \nof individual and public safety. \nB. No person may sleep in any pedestrian or \nvehicular  entrance  to  public  or  private \nproperty abutting a public sidewalk. \nC. In addition to any other remedy provided \nby law, any person found in violation of this \nsection may be immediately removed from \nthe premises. \nGPMC 5.61.020.  A violation of this ordinance resulted in a \npresumptive $75 fine.  If unpaid, that fine escalated to $160.  \nIf a violator pled guilty, the fines could be reduced by a state \n \nthat “it is hard to deny that Martin has ‘generate[d] dire practical \nconsequences”) (modification in original and citation omitted).  But \nMartin is controlling law in the Ninth Circuit, to which we are required \nto adhere.    \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 16 of 155\n16  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \ncircuit court judge to $35 for a first offense and $50 for a \nsecond offense.  GPMC 1.36.010(K). \nNext,  the  general  anti-camping  ordinance  prohibited \npersons from occupying a “campsite” on all public property, \nsuch as parks, benches, or rights of way.  GPMC 5.61.030.  \nThe term “campsite” was defined as  \nany place where bedding, sleeping bag, or \nother material used for bedding purposes, or \nany stove or fire is placed, established, or \nmaintained for the purpose of maintaining a \ntemporary place to live, whether or not such \nplace incorporates the use of any tent, lean-\nto,  shack,  or  any  other  structure,  or  any \nvehicle or part thereof. \nGPMC  5.61.010.    A  second  overlapping  anti-camping \nordinance  prohibited  camping  in  public  parks,  including \n“[o]vernight parking” of any vehicle.  GPMC 6.46.090.  A \nhomeless individual would violate this parking prohibition if \nshe parked or left “a vehicle parked for two consecutive \nhours [in a City park] . . . between the hours of midnight and \n6:00 a.m.”  Id.  Violations of either anti-camping ordinance \nresulted in a fine of $295.  If unpaid, the fine escalated to \n$537.60.  However, if a violator pled guilty, the fine could \nbe reduced to $180 for a first offense and $225 for a second \noffense.  GPMC 1.36.010(J). \nFinally, the “park exclusion” ordinance allowed a police \nofficer to bar an individual from all city parks for 30 days if, \nwithin one year, the individual was issued two or more \ncitations for violating park regulations.  GPMC 6.46.350(A).  \nPursuant  to  the  “park  exclusion  appeals”  ordinance, \nexclusion orders could be appealed to the City Council.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 17 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    17 \nGPMC  6.46.355.    If  an  individual  received  a  “park \nexclusion” order, but subsequently was found in a city park, \nthat individual would be prosecuted for criminal trespass.     \nSince at least 2013, City leaders have viewed homeless \npersons as cause for substantial concern.  That year the City \nCouncil convened a Community Roundtable (“Roundtable”) \n“to  identify  solutions  to  current  vagrancy  problems.”  \nParticipants  discussed  the  possibility  of  “driving  repeat \noffenders out of town and leaving them there.”  The City’s \nPublic  Safety  Director  noted  police  officers  had  bought \nhomeless persons bus tickets out of town, only to have the \nperson returned to the City from the location where they \nwere sent.  A city councilor made clear the City’s goal \nshould be “to make it uncomfortable enough for [homeless \npersons] in our city so they will want to move on down the \nroad.”  The planned actions resulting from the Roundtable \nincluded  increased  enforcement  of  City  ordinances, \nincluding the anti-camping ordinances.   \nThe year following the Roundtable saw a significant \nincrease in enforcement of the City’s anti-sleeping and anti-\ncamping ordinances.  From 2013 through 2018, the City \nissued a steady stream of tickets under the ordinances.4  On \nSeptember 4, 2018, a three-judge panel issued its opinion in \n \n4 The City issued the following number of tickets under the anti-sleeping \nand anti-camping ordinances:   \n  2013: 74 total tickets \n  2014: 228 total tickets \n  2015: 80 total tickets \n  2016: 47 total tickets \n  2017: 99 total tickets \n  2018: 46 total tickets \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 18 of 155\n18  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nMartin v. City of Boise, 902 F.3d 1031 (9th Cir. 2018). 5  That \ncase served as the backdrop for this entire litigation.   \nIn Martin, six homeless or recently homeless individuals \nsued the city of Boise, Idaho, seeking relief from criminal \nprosecution  under  two  city  ordinances  related  to  public \ncamping.  Martin, 920 F.3d at 603-04.  As relevant here, \nMartin held the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the \n“Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of criminal \npenalties for sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public \nproperty  for  homeless  individuals  who  cannot  obtain \nshelter.”  Id. at 616.  Martin made clear, however, that a city \nis  not  required  to  “provide  sufficient  shelter  for  the \nhomeless, or allow anyone who wishes to sit, lie, or sleep on \nthe streets . . . at any time and at any place.”  Id. at 617 \n(quoting Jones v. City of Los Angeles, 444 F.3d 1118, 1138 \n(9th Cir. 2006), vacated, 505 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir. 2007)) \n(omission in original).   \n \n5 Following the opinion, the City of Boise petitioned for rehearing en \nbanc.  On April 1, 2019, an amended panel opinion was issued and the \npetition for rehearing was denied.  Judge M. Smith, joined by five other \njudges, dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc.  He argued the \nthree-judge panel had, among other errors, misinterpreted the Supreme \nCourt precedents regarding the criminalization of involuntary conduct.  \nMartin, 920 F.3d at 591-92 (M. Smith, J., dissenting from denial of \nrehearing en banc).  Judge Bennett, joined by four judges, also dissented \nfrom the denial of rehearing en banc.  Judge Bennett argued the three-\njudge panel’s opinion was inconsistent with the original public meaning \nof the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause.  Id. at 599 (Bennett, J., \ndissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  The merits of those \ndissents do not alter the binding nature of the amended Martin panel \nopinion.  Unless otherwise indicated, all citations to Martin throughout \nthe remainder of this opinion are to the amended panel opinion.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 19 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    19 \nPursuant to Martin, it is an Eighth Amendment violation \nto  criminally  punish  involuntarily  homeless  persons  for \nsleeping  in  public  if  there  are  no  other  public  areas  or \nappropriate shelters where those individuals can sleep.  Id. \nat  617  n.8  (“Naturally,  our  holding  does  not  cover \nindividuals  who  do  have  access  to  adequate  temporary \nshelter, whether because they have the means to pay for it or \nbecause it is realistically available to them for free, but who \nchoose not to use it.”).  When assessing the number of shelter \nspaces, Martin held shelters with a “mandatory religious \nfocus” could not be counted as available due to potential \nviolations of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause.  \nId. at 609-10 (citing Inouye v. Kemna, 504 F.3d 705, 712-13 \n(9th Cir. 2007)). \nIn  October  2018,  approximately  six  weeks  after  the \nMartin opinion, Debra Blake filed her putative class action \ncomplaint  against  the  City.    The  complaint  alleged \nenforcement of the City’s anti-sleeping and anti-camping \nordinances  violated  the  Cruel  and  Unusual  Punishment \nClause  of  the  Eighth  Amendment,  the  Equal  Protection \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The complaint was \namended to include additional named plaintiffs and to allege \na claim that the fines imposed under the ordinances violated \nthe Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment.  On \nJanuary 2, 2019, a few months after the initial complaint was \nfiled,  and  before  Plaintiffs  filed  their  class  certification \nmotion, the City amended its anti-camping ordinance in an \nattempt to come into compliance with Martin.  Prior to this \nchange, the anti-camping ordinance was worded such that \n“‘sleeping’  in  parks  .  .  .  automatically  constitut[ed] \n‘camping.’”  According to the City, “in direct response to \nMartin  v.  Boise,  the  City  amended  [the  anti-camping \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 20 of 155\n20  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nordinance] to make it clear that the act of ‘sleeping’ was to \nbe distinguished from the prohibited conduct of ‘camping.’”  \nThe City meant to “make it clear that those without shelter \ncould engage in the involuntary acts of sleeping or resting in \nthe City’s parks.”  Shortly after the City removed “sleeping” \nfrom the “camping” definition, Plaintiffs moved to certify a \nclass.  Plaintiffs requested certification of a class defined as  \nAll involuntarily homeless individuals living \nin Grants Pass, Oregon, including homeless \nindividuals who sometimes sleep outside city \nlimits to avoid harassment and punishment \nby [the City] as addressed in this lawsuit. \nPlaintiffs’ class certification motion was accompanied by a \ndeclaration from the Chief Operating Officer and Director of \nHousing  and  Homeless  Services  for  United  Community \nAction Network (“UCAN”), a non-profit organization that \nserves homeless people in Josephine County, the county \nwhere the City is located.6  UCAN had recently conducted a \n“point-in-time count of homeless individuals in Josephine \nCounty.”7    Based  on  that  count,  the  Chief  Operating \n \n6 The Department of Housing and Urban Development regulations \nimpose obligations on the “continuum of care,” which is defined as “the \ngroup composed of representatives of relevant organizations . . . that are \norganized to plan for and provide, as necessary, a system of outreach, \nengagement, and assessment . . . to address the various needs of homeless \npersons and persons at risk of homelessness for a specific geographic \narea.” 24 C.F.R. § 576.2.   \n7 As the “continuum of care” in the City, UCAN was required to conduct \npoint-in-time counts (“PIT counts”) of homeless persons within that \ngeographic area.  24 C.F.R. § 578.7(c)(2).  PIT counts measure the \nnumber of sheltered and unsheltered homeless individuals on a single \nnight.  24 C.F.R. § 578.7(c)(2).  The Martin court relied on PIT counts \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 21 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    21 \nOfficer’s  declaration  stated  “[h]undreds  of  [homeless] \npeople live in Grants Pass,” and “almost all of the homeless \npeople in Grants Pass are involuntarily homeless.  There is \nsimply no place in Grants Pass for them to find affordable \nhousing or shelter.  They are not choosing to live on the street \nor in the woods.”   \nThe City opposed class certification, arguing Plaintiffs \nhad not provided sufficient evidence to meet any of the \nrequirements  for  certifying  a  class.    The  district  court \ndisagreed and certified the class proposed by Plaintiffs.  The \nparties proceeded with discovery and filed cross-motions for \nsummary judgment. \nAt the time the parties filed their summary judgment \nmotions, there were only four locations in the City that \ntemporarily  housed  homeless  persons,  which  proved \ninadequate.  One location was run by the Gospel Rescue \nMission,  an  explicitly  religious  organization  devoted  to \nhelping the poor.  The Gospel Rescue Mission operated a \nfacility for single men without children, and another facility \nfor women, including women with children.  These two \nfacilities required residents to work at the mission six hours \na day, six days a week in exchange for a bunk for 30 days.  \nResidents were  required to attend an approved place of \nworship  each  Sunday  and  that  place  of  worship  had  to \nespouse “traditional Christian teachings such as the Apostles \nCreed.”  Disabled persons with chronic medical or mental \n \nconducted by local non-profits to determine the number of homeless \npeople in the jurisdiction.  See Martin, 920 F.3d at 604.  Courts and \nexperts note that PIT counts routinely undercount homeless persons, but \nthey appear to be the best available source of data on homelessness.  See, \ne.g., id. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 22 of 155\n22  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nhealth issues that prevented them from complying with the \nMission’s rules were prohibited.8   \nIn addition to the Gospel Rescue Mission, the City itself \noperated a “sobering center” where law enforcement could \ntransport  intoxicated  or  impaired  persons.    That  facility \nconsisted  of  twelve  locked  rooms  with  toilets  where \nintoxicated individuals could sober up.  The rooms did not \nhave beds.  The City also provided financial support to the \nHearts with a Mission Youth Shelter, an 18-bed facility \nwhere unaccompanied minors aged 10 to 17 could stay for \nup to 72 hours, and could stay even longer if they had \nparental consent.   \nFinally, on nights when the temperature was below 30 \ndegrees (or below 32 degrees with snow), UCAN operated a \n“warming center” capable of holding up to 40 individuals.  \nThat  center  did  not  provide  beds.    The  center  reached \ncapacity on every night it operated except the first night it \nopened, February 3, 2020.  Between February 3 and March \n19, 2020, the warming center was open for 16 nights.  The \ncenter did not open at all during the winter of 2020-2021.   \nPresented  with  evidence  of  the  number  of  homeless \npersons and the shelter spaces available, the district court \nconcluded “[t]he record is undisputed that Grants Pass has \nfar  more  homeless  individuals  than  it  has  practically \navailable shelter beds.”  The court then held that, based on \nthe unavailability of shelter beds, the City’s enforcement of \nits anti-camping and anti-sleeping ordinances violated the \n \n8 Multiple class members submitted uncontested declarations to the \ndistrict court stating they did not stay at the Gospel Rescue Mission \nbecause they suffer from disqualifying disabilities and/or were unwilling \nto attend church.   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 23 of 155\n  JOHNSON V.

The fact that Martin \ninvolved criminal violations while the present case involved \ninitial civil violations that matured into criminal violations \nmade “no difference for Eight Amendment purposes.”  Next, \nthe  court  held  the  system  of  fines  violated  the  Eighth \nAmendment’s Excessive Fines Clause.9  Finally, the court \nheld  the  appeals  process  for  park  exclusions  violated \nprocedural due process under the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment.   \nIn reaching its decision the district court was careful to \npoint  out  that,  consistent  with  Martin,  the  scope  of  its \ndecision was limited.  The court’s order made clear that the \nCity  was  not  required  to  provide  shelter  for  homeless \npersons and the City could still limit camping or sleeping at \ncertain times and in certain places.  The district court also \nnoted the City may still “ban the use of tents in public parks,” \n“limi[t] the amount of bedding type materials allowed per \nindividual,”  and  pursue  other  options  “to  prevent  the \n \n9 Part of the City’s argument on this issue was that the fines are not \nmandatory because state court judges retain discretion not to impose \nfines.  This is inconsistent with the text of the ordinances and not \nsupported by the record.  The provision of the municipal code defining \npenalties for ordinance violations clarifies that the fines are mandatory.  \nIt provides, the fines “shall be $295” and “shall be $75.”  GPMC \n1.36.010(J)-(K) (emphasis added).  Conversely, it is only discretionary \nto reduce fines because the relevant ordinance provides that, “[u]pon a \nplea of guilty . . . the penalty may be reduced” to the amount listed for a \nfirst or second offense.  Id. (emphasis added).  After a second citation, \nthere is no authority within the municipal code that permits judges to \nreduce fines, and there is no evidence in the record demonstrating circuit \ncourt judges have reduced fines except pursuant to GPMC 1.36.010. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 24 of 155\n24  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nerection of encampments that cause public health and safety \nconcerns.”10   \nApproximately one month after the summary judgment \norder, the district court issued a judgment which included a \npermanent injunction that provided a complicated mix of \nrelief.    First,  the  district  court  declared  the  ordinance \nregarding the appeals of park exclusions failed to provide \n“adequate procedural due process,” but that ordinance was \nnot  permanently  enjoined.    Instead,  the  district  court \nenjoined  only  the  enforcement  of  the  underlying  park \nexclusion  ordinance.    Next,  the  district  court  declared \nenforcement  of  the  anti-sleeping  and  anti-camping \nordinances  against  class  members  “violates  the  Eighth \nAmendment  prohibition  against  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment”  and  “violates  the  Eighth  Amendment \nprohibition against excessive fines.”  Without explanation, \nhowever, the district court did not enjoin those ordinances in \ntheir entirety.  Rather, the district court entered no injunctive \nrelief regarding the anti-sleeping ordinance.  But the district \ncourt permanently enjoined enforcement of the anti-camping \nordinances,  as  well  as  an  ordinance  regarding  “criminal \ntrespassing on city property related to parks,” in all City \nparks at night except for one park where the parties agreed \nthe injunction need not apply.11  The district court also \npermanently  enjoined  enforcement  of  the  anti-camping \nordinances during daytime hours unless an initial warning \nwas  given  “at  least  24  hours  before  enforcement.”  \n \n10 The district court denied summary judgment on other claims brought \nby Plaintiffs.  Those claims were subsequently voluntarily dismissed.   \n11 The City ordinance regarding “criminal trespass” was never at issue in \nthe litigation until the permanent injunction.  Plaintiffs explain it was \nincluded in the injunction “[b]y agreement of the parties.”    \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 25 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    25 \nAccordingly,  under  the  permanent  injunction,  the  anti-\ncamping  ordinances  may  be  enforced  under  some \ncircumstances during the day, but never at night.   \nThe City appealed and sought initial en banc review to \nclarify the scope of Martin.  The petition for initial hearing \nen banc was denied.   \nII. \nThe  core  issue  involving  enforcement  of  the  anti-\ncamping ordinances is governed in large part by Martin.  \nWhile there are some differences between Martin and the \npresent case, the City has not identified a persuasive way to \ndifferentiate  its  anti-camping  ordinances  from  the \nquestioned ordinances in Martin.  Therefore, the district \ncourt’s ruling that the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause \nbars enforcement of the anti-camping ordinances will be \nmostly  affirmed.    We  need  not  address  the  potential \nexcessiveness  of  the  fines  issue  or  whether  Plaintiffs \nadequately pled their due process challenge. \nOur analysis proceeds in five parts.  First, we reject the \nCity’s argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction.12  \nSecond, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court’s \ncertification of a class of involuntarily homeless persons.  \nThird, we agree with the district court that at least portions \nof the anti-camping ordinance violate the Cruel and Unusual \nPunishment clause under Martin.  Fourth, we conclude there \nis no need to resolve whether the fines violate the Excessive \n \n12 However, we vacate summary judgment and remand as to the anti-\nsleeping  ordinance  to  afford  the  district  court  the  opportunity  to \nsubstitute a class representative in place of Debra Blake, who passed \naway while this matter was on appeal.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 26 of 155\n26  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nFines clause.  Fifth, we hold it is unnecessary to decide \nPlaintiffs’ procedural due process claim. \nA. \nStanding and mootness are questions of law that we \nreview de novo.  Hartman v. Summers, 120 F.3d 157, 159 \n(9th Cir. 1997); Foster v. Carson, 347 F.3d 742, 745 (9th \nCir. 2003).  “Federal courts must determine that they have \njurisdiction before proceeding to the merits,” and plaintiffs \nmust demonstrate standing as a necessary component of \njurisdiction.  Lance v. Coffman, 549 U.S. 437, 439 (2007).  \nTo have Article III standing, a plaintiff must show (1) a \nconcrete  and  particularized  injury,  (2)  caused  by  the \nchallenged  conduct,  (3)  that  is  likely  redressable  by  a \nfavorable judicial decision.  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. \nLaidlaw Env’t Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180-81 \n(2000).  For purposes of injunctive relief, “[a]bstract injury \nis not enough”—the plaintiff must have sustained or be in \nimmediate danger “of sustaining some direct injury as the \nresult of the challenged” law.  O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. \n488, 494 (1974) (quotation marks and citation omitted).  \nThe  City’s  appellate  briefing  makes  two  standing \narguments.  First, the City argues Plaintiffs’ claims are now \nmoot because Plaintiffs no longer face a risk of injury based \non the City’s changed behavior after Martin.  Second, the \nCity argues Plaintiffs have not identified any relief that is \nwithin a federal court’s power to redress.  Both arguments \nare without merit. \nA claim becomes moot, and no longer justiciable in \nfederal court, if it has been remedied independent of the \ncourt.  See Genesis Healthcare Corp. v. Symczyk, 569 U.S. \n66, 72 (2013).  There is abundant evidence in the record \nestablishing homeless persons were injured by the City’s \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 27 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    27 \nenforcement actions in the past.  The City argues, however, \nthat it made changes after Martin such that there is no longer \na threat of future injury.  The problem for the City is that \nvoluntary cessation of challenged practices rarely suffices to \nmoot  a  case  and,  in  any  event,  there  is  evidence  the \nchallenged practices have continued after Martin. \n“It is well settled that ‘a defendant’s voluntary cessation \nof a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of \nits power to determine the legality of the practice.’”  Friends \nof the Earth, 528 U.S. at 189 (quoting City of Mesquite v. \nAladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 289 (1982)).  This is so \n“because  a  dismissal  for  mootness  would  permit  a \nresumption of the challenged conduct as soon as the case is \ndismissed.”  Knox v. Serv. Emps. Int’l Union, Local 1000, \n567  U.S.  298,  307  (2012).    Thus,  the  City  “bears  the \nformidable burden of showing that it is absolutely clear the \nallegedly  wrongful  behavior  could  not  reasonably  be \nexpected to recur.”  Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 190.  \nInstead  of  the  City  making  it  “absolutely  clear”  it  has \nstopped enforcement activities, the record shows ongoing \nenforcement.     \nThe parties diverge substantially on how to characterize \nthe  degree  of  enforcement  after  Martin  was  issued  in \nSeptember 2018.  The City argued in its briefing and at oral \nargument that it has largely complied with Martin, noting the \n2019  amendment  to  an  anti-camping  ordinance,  that \ncitations were issued “sparingly” in 2019, and in particular \nit says it issued only two citations during the late evening \nand early morning  since Martin.  The  City supports its \npetition with a declaration from a City police officer stating \n“[i]t is the regular practice of every officer I know of on this \ndepartment to enforce these Ordinances sparingly and in \nrecognition of the different circumstances we encounter.”  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 28 of 155\n28  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nAs  for  Plaintiffs,  they  offered  evidence  showing \nenforcement continued after Martin such that class members \nreceived  citations  and  exclusion  orders  for  camping  or \nsleeping and were prosecuted for criminal trespass between \nthe point the lawsuit was filed and the close of discovery.   \nAlthough the record does show the rate of enforcement \nof  the  various  ordinances  decreased  since  Martin,  even \naccepting the City’s position the evidence is undisputed that \nenforcement continued.13  It is plainly inaccurate for the City \nto claim all enforcement ceased.  The ongoing enforcement \nactivities establish the City did not meet its “formidable \nburden” of showing the challenged activities will not recur.  \nFriends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 190.  The City’s mootness \nargument fails.14 \n \n13 The City also argues “there was no evidence that anyone was ever cited \nfor the simple act of sleeping in a City park” after Martin.  But the \ncitation issued to Dolores Nevin in late December 2019 pursuant to the \nCity’s “criminal trespass” ordinance included a narrative explaining, \n“[d]uring an area check of Riverside Park, Dolores Nevin was found \nsleeping during closed hours.  Nevin, who has been warned in the past, \nwas issued a citation for Trespass on City Property.”  (emphasis added).  \nAnd on September 11, 2019, Grants Pass Police Officer Jason McGinnis \nissued citations to Debra Blake and Carla Thomas for being in Riverside \nPark at approximately 7:30 a.m. with sleeping bags and belongings \nspread around themselves.  The citation given to Debra Blake, a named \nplaintiff, identified the offense as “Criminal Trespass on City Property.”  \nDebra Blake was later convicted of that offense and fined.  Other \nindividuals cited for camping in a city park in 2019 include class \nmembers: Gail Laine, William Stroh, Dawn Schmidt, Cristina Trejo, \nKellie Parker, Colleen Bannon, Amanda Sirnio, and Michael and Louana \nEllis.   \n14 Mootness was also considered during the Martin litigation.  See Bell \nv. City of Boise, 709 F.3d 890, 898, 900-01 (9th Cir. 2013).  The City of \nBoise argued that a combination of an amended definition of “camping” \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 29 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    29 \nThe  City’s  other  jurisdictional  argument  is  that \nPlaintiffs’ claims are not redressable.  According to the City, \nany possible relief intrudes inappropriately upon matters of \npolicy best left to executive and legislative discretion.  We \ndisagree.  Consistent with Martin, the district court granted \nlimited relief enjoining enforcement of  a few  municipal \nordinances at certain times, in certain places, against certain \npersons.  None of the cases cited by the City credibly support \nits argument that the district court injunction overstepped the \njudiciary’s  limited  authority  under  the  Constitution.  \nContrary to the City’s position, enjoining enforcement of a \nfew municipal ordinances aimed at involuntarily homeless \npersons  cannot  credibly  be  compared  to  an  injunction \nseeking to require the federal government to “phase out \nfossil fuel emissions and draw down excess atmospheric \nCO2.”  Juliana v. United States, 947 F.3d 1159, 1164-65 \n(9th  Cir.  2020).    The  relief  sought  by  Plaintiffs  was \nredressable within the limits of Article III.  See Renee v. \nDuncan, 686 F.3d 1002, 1013 (9th Cir. 2012) (holding a \nplaintiff’s burden to demonstrate redressability is “relatively \nmodest”) (citation omitted). \n \nin the ordinance and a “Special Order,” prohibiting police officers from \nenforcing the ordinances when a person is on public property and there \nis no available overnight shelter, mooted the case.  Id. at 894-95.  We \nrejected the argument that the change to the definition of “camping” \nrendered the case moot because “[m]ere clarification of the Camping \nOrdinance does not address the central concerns of the Plaintiffs’ Eighth \nAmendment claims”—that the ordinance “effectively criminalized their \nstatus as homeless individuals.”  Id. at 898 n.12.  And we held the \nadoption of a “Special Order” did not moot the case because the Special \nOrder was not a legislative enactment, and as such it “could be easily \nabandoned or altered in the future.”  Id. at 901.   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 30 of 155\n30  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nFinally, we raise sua sponte the possibility that the death \nof class representative Debra Blake while this matter was on \nthe appeal has jurisdictional significance.  Cf. Fort Bend Cty. \nv. Davis, 139 S.Ct. 1843, 1849 (2019) (holding courts must \nraise issues of subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte).  We \nhold Blake’s death does not moot the class’s claims as to all \nchallenged  ordinances  except  possibly  the  anti-sleeping \nordinance.  As to that ordinance, we remand to allow the \ndistrict  court  the  opportunity  to  substitute  a  class \nrepresentative in Blake’s stead.  \nWith respect to the park exclusion, criminal trespass, and \nanti-camping ordinances, the surviving class representatives, \nGloria Johnson15 and John Logan,16 have standing in their \n \n15 The dissent suggests Gloria Johnson does not have standing to \nchallenge the park exclusion and criminal trespass ordinances.  Dissent \n71-72.    The  dissent  concedes,  however,  Johnson  has  standing  to \nchallenge the anti-camping ordinances, GPMC 5.61.030, 6.46.090.  But \nthe dissent does not provide a meaningful explanation why it draws this \ndistinction between the ordinances that work in concert.  It is true \nJohnson has not received a park exclusion order and has not been charged \nwith criminal trespass in the second degree. However, there is little doubt \nthat her continued camping in parks would lead to a park exclusion order \nand, eventually, criminal trespass charges.  Johnson is positioned to bring \na pre-enforcement challenge against the park exclusion and criminal \ntrespass ordinances, because they will be used against her given the \nundisputed fact that she remains involuntarily homeless in Grants Pass.  \nShe established a credible threat of future enforcement under the anti-\ncamping  ordinances  which  creates  a  credible  threat  of  future \nenforcement under the park exclusion and criminal trespass ordinances. \n16 The dissent claims John Logan has not established standing.  Dissent \n69-71.  During the course of this case, Logan submitted two declarations.  \nAt the class certification stage, his declaration stated he “lived out of \n[his] truck on the streets in Grants Pass for about 4 years.”  During that \ntime, he was “awakened by City of Grants Pass police officer and told \nthat I cannot sleep in my truck anywhere in the city and ordered to move \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 31 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    31 \nown  right.    Although  they  live  in  their  cars,  they  risk \nenforcement under all the same ordinances as Blake and the \nclass (with the exception of the anti-sleeping ordinance, \nGPMC 5.61.020, which cannot be violated by sleeping in a \ncar) and have standing in their own right as to all ordinances \nexcept GPMC 5.61.020.  \n \non.”  To avoid those encounters, Logan “usually sleep[s] in [his] truck \njust outside the Grants Pass city limits.”  However, Logan stated “[i]f \nthere was some place in the city where [he] could legally sleep in [his] \ntruck, [he] would because it would save valuable gas money and avoid . \n. . having to constantly move.”  Logan also explained he has “met dozens, \nif not hundreds, of homeless people in Grants Pass” over the years who \nhad been ticketed, fined, arrested, and criminally prosecuted “for living \noutside.” At summary judgment, Logan submitted a declaration stating \nhe is “currently involuntarily homeless in Grants Pass and sleeping in \n[his] truck at night at a rest stop North of Grants Pass.”  He stated he \n“cannot sleep in the City of Grants Pass for fear that [he] will be \nawakened, ticketed, fined, moved along, trespassed and charged with \nCriminal Trespass.”  The dissent reads this evidence as indicating Logan \nfailed to “provide[] any facts to establish” that he is likely to be issued a \ncitation under the challenged ordinances.  Dissent 70.  We do not agree.  \nThe undisputed facts establish Logan is involuntarily homeless. When \nhe slept in Grants Pass, he was awoken by police officers and ordered to \nmove.  His  personal  knowledge  was  that  involuntarily  homeless \nindividuals  in  Grants  Pass  often  are  cited  under  the  challenged \nordinances  and  Grants  Pass  continues  to  enforce  the  challenged \nordinances. And, but for the challenged ordinances, Logan would sleep \nin the city.  Therefore, as the district court found, it is sufficiently likely \nLogan would be issued a citation that Logan’s standing is established.  \nThat is especially true given the Supreme Court's instruction that a \nplaintiff  need  not  wait  for “an  actual  arrest,  prosecution,  or  other \nenforcement action” before “challenging [a] law.” Susan B. Anthony List \nv. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014). Finally, even if Logan had not \ndemonstrated  standing,  the  dissent’s  analysis  regarding  Logan  is \nirrelevant because this case could proceed solely based on the standing \nestablished by Gloria Johnson and the class.  See Bates v. United Parcel \nServ., Inc., 511 F.3d at 985 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc). \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 32 of 155\n32  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nWith respect to the anti-sleeping ordinance, the law is \nless clear.  Debra Blake is the only class representative who \nhad standing in her own right to challenge the anti-sleeping \nordinance.  Under cases such as Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, \n401 (1975), and Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., Inc., \n424 U.S. 747 (1976), a class representative may pursue the \nlive claims of a properly certified class—without the need to \nremand  for substitution of a new representative17—even \nafter his own claims become moot, provided that several \nrequirements are met.18  See Bates v. United Parcel Serv., \nInc., 511 F.3d 974, 987-88 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc).  If \nDebra  Blake’s  challenge  to  the  anti-sleeping  ordinance \nbecame  moot  before  she  passed  away,  she  could  have \ncontinued to pursue the challenge on behalf of the class \nunder the doctrine of Sosna.  But we have not found any case \napplying Sosna and Franks to a situation such as this, in \n \n17 See Sosna, 419 U.S. at 403 (“[W]e believe that the test of Rule 23(a) \nis met.”); id. at 416-17 (White, J., dissenting) (“It is claimed that the \ncertified class supplies the necessary adverse parties for a continuing \ncase or controversy . . . The Court cites no authority for this retrospective \ndecision as to the adequacy of representation which seems to focus on \nthe  competence  of  counsel  rather  than  a  party  plaintiff  who  is  a \nrepresentative member of the class.  At the very least, the case should be \nremanded to the District Court.”). \n18 The class must be properly certified, see Franks, 424 U.S. at 755-56, \nor the representative must be appealing denial of class certification.  See \nUnited States Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 404 (1980).  \nThe class representative must be a member of the class with standing to \nsue at the time certification is granted or denied.  See Sosna, 419 U.S. at \n403.  The unnamed class members must still have a live interest in the \nmatter throughout the duration of the litigation.  See Franks, 424 U.S. at \n755.  And the court must be satisfied that the named representative will \nadequately pursue the interests of the class even though their own interest \nhas expired.  See Sosna, 419 U.S. at 403.   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 33 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    33 \nwhich the death of a representative causes a class to be \nunrepresented as to part (but not all) of a claim.  The parties \ndid not brief this issue and no precedent indicates whether \nthis raises a jurisdictional question, which would deprive us \nof  authority  to  review  the  merits  of  the  anti-sleeping \nordinance challenge, or a matter of Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23, which might not.   \nBecause Plaintiffs have not moved to substitute a class \nrepresentative  pursuant  to  Federal  Rule  of  Appellate \nProcedure 43(a) or identified a representative who could be \nsubstituted, because no party has addressed this question in \nbriefing, and because we are not certain of our jurisdiction \nto consider the challenge to the anti-sleeping ordinance, we \nthink it appropriate to vacate summary judgment as to the \nanti-sleeping ordinance and remand to determine whether a \nsubstitute representative is available as to that challenge \nalone.  See Cobell v. Jewell, 802 F.3d 12, 23-24 (D.C. Cir. \n2015) (discussing substitution of a party during appeal).  \nSubstitution of a class representative may significantly aid \nin the resolution of the issues in this case.  Remand will not \ncause  significant  delay  because,  as  we  explain  below, \nremand is otherwise required so that the injunction can be \nmodified.  In the absence of briefing or precedent regarding \nthis question, we do not decide whether this limitation is \njurisdictional or whether it arises from operation of Rule 23.   \nWe therefore hold the surviving class representatives at \na  minimum  have  standing  to  challenge  every  ordinance \nexcept the anti-sleeping ordinance.  As to the anti-sleeping \nordinance, we vacate summary judgment and remand for the \ndistrict court to consider in the first instance whether an \nadequate class representative, such as class member Dolores \nNevin, exists who may be substituted.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 34 of 155\n34  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nB. \nThe City’s next argument is the district court erred in \ncertifying the class.  We “review a district court’s order \ngranting class certification for abuse of discretion, but give \nthe district court ‘noticeably more deference when reviewing \na grant of class certification than when reviewing a denial.’”  \nPatel v. Facebook, Inc., 932 F.3d 1264, 1275 (9th Cir. 2019) \n(internal citation omitted) (quoting Just Film, Inc. v. Buono, \n847 F.3d 1108, 1115 (9th Cir. 2017)).  Factual findings \nunderlying class certification are reviewed for clear error.  \nParsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 673 (9th Cir. 2014).   \nA member of a class may sue as a representative party if \nthe member satisfies Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)’s \nfour prerequisites: numerosity, commonality, typicality, and \nadequacy of representation.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a); Mazza v. \nAm. Honda Motor Co., Inc., 666 F.3d 581, 588 (9th Cir. \n2012).  Assessing these requirements involves “rigorous \nanalysis” of the evidence.  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, \n564 U.S. 338, 351 (2011) (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of the Sw. \nv. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982)).   \nIf  the  initial  requirements  of  Rule  23(a)  are  met,  a \nputative class representative must also show the class falls \ninto one of three categories under Rule 23(b).  Plaintiffs \nbrought this suit under Rule 23(b)(2), seeking injunctive or \ndeclaratory relief based on the City having “acted or refused \nto act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that \nfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is \nappropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(b)(2).   \nThe district court found the Rule 23(a) requirements \nsatisfied and certified a class under Rule 23(b)(2).  The \nCity’s arguments against this class certification are obscure.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 35 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    35 \nIt appears the City’s argument is that class certification was \nan abuse of discretion because the holding of Martin can \nonly  be  applied  after  an  individualized  inquiry  of  each \nalleged involuntarily homeless person’s access to shelter.19  \nThe City appears to suggest the need for individualized \ninquiry  defeats  numerosity,  commonality,  and typicality.  \nWhile we acknowledge the Martin litigation was not a class \naction, nothing in that decision precluded class actions.20  \nAnd based on the record in this case, the district court did \nnot err by finding Plaintiffs satisfied the requirements of \nRule 23 such that a class could be certified.   \nTo satisfy the numerosity requirement a proposed class \nmust  be  “so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is \nimpracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  For purposes of \nthis  requirement,  “‘impracticability’  does  not  mean \n‘impossibility,’ but only the difficulty or inconvenience of \njoining all members of the class.”  Harris v. Palm Springs \nAlpine Ests., Inc., 329 F.2d 909, 913–14 (9th Cir. 1964) \n(quotation omitted).  There is no specific number of class \nmembers required.  See Gen. Tel.

To the contrary, at least 13 class members \nsubmitted declarations to the district court indicating that they are \ninvoluntarily homeless. \n20 Other courts have certified similar classes.  See e.g., Lehr v. City of \nSacramento, 259 F.R.D. 479 (E.D. Cal. 2009) (addressing numerosity, \ncommonality, and typicality for homeless persons in Sacramento); Joyce \nv.

The City does not identify how this finding was \nclearly erroneous.  In fact, the City affirmatively indicated to \nPlaintiffs prior to the class certification order that the number \nof homeless persons residing in Grants Pass for the past 7 \nyears was “unknown.”  Further, the only guidance offered \nby the City regarding a specific number of class members \ncame long after the class was certified.  A City police officer \nclaimed in a declaration that he was “aware of less than fifty \nindividuals total who do not have access to any shelter” in \nthe  City.    The  officer  admitted,  however,  it  “would  be \nextremely difficult to accurately estimate the population of \npeople who are homeless in Grants Pass regardless of the \ndefinition used.”   \nThe officer’s guess of “less than fifty” homeless persons \nis  inconsistent  with  the  general  understanding  that  PIT \ncounts routinely undercount homeless persons.  See Martin, \n920 F.3d at 604 (“It is widely recognized that a one-night \npoint  in  time  count  will  undercount  the  homeless \npopulation.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But even \naccepting  the  officer’s  assessment  that  there  were \napproximately  fifty  homeless  persons  in  the  City,  the \nnumerosity requirement is satisfied.

Dissent 77-79.  \nThat misunderstands how the present class was structured.  The dissent \nattempts to reframe the common question as a very general inquiry.  It \nappears  the  dissent  interprets  the  question  whether  an  Eighth \nAmendment violation must be determined by an individualized inquiry \nas whether each individual is “involuntarily homeless.”  To assess that, \na court would have to conduct an individualized inquiry and determine \nif an individual was “involuntarily homeless.”  But that is not the \ncommon question in this case.  Rather, the question is whether the City's \nenforcement of the anti-camping ordinances against all involuntarily \nhomeless individuals violates the Eighth Amendment.  This question is \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 39 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    39 \ndefinition.  Pursuant to the class definition, the class includes \nonly  involuntarily  homeless  persons.23    Individuals  who \nhave shelter or the means to acquire their own shelter simply \n \ncapable of common resolution on a prospective class-wide basis, as the \nrecord establishes.  \n23 The dissent argues this created a prohibited “fail safe” class.  That is \nerroneous.  As noted in a recent en banc decision, “a ‘fail safe’ class . . . \nis defined to include only those individuals who were injured by the \nallegedly unlawful conduct.”  Olean Wholesale Grocery Coop., Inc. v. \nBumble Bee Foods LLC, 31 F.4th 651, 669 n.14 (9th Cir. 2022) (en \nbanc).  Such classes are prohibited “because a class member either wins \nor, by virtue of losing, is defined out of the class and is therefore not \nbound by the judgment.”  Id.  See also Ruiz Torres v. Mercer Canyons \nInc., 835 F.3d 1125, 1138 (9th Cir. 2016) (noting a fail safe class “is one \nthat is defined so narrowly as to preclude[ ] membership unless the \nliability of the defendant is established”).  No such class is present here.  \nThe class was defined, in relevant part, as “[a]ll involuntarily homeless \nindividuals living in Grants Pass.”  Membership in that class has no \nconnection to the success of the underlying claims.  Put differently, the \nclass would have consisted of exactly the same population whether \nGrants Pass won or lost on the merits.  The obvious illustration of this is \nthe class population would not change if a court determined the anti-\ncamping ordinance violated the Eighth Amendment while the anti-\nsleeping ordinance did not. In that situation, class members would not be \n“defined out of the class.” Olean, 31 F.4th at 669 n.14 (citation omitted).  \nRather, class members would be “bound by the judgment” regarding the \nanti-sleeping  ordinance.  Id.  In  any  event,  the  dissent’s  concerns \nregarding individualized determinations are best made when the City \nattempts to enforce its ordinances.  Cf. McArdle v. City of Ocala, 519 \nF.Supp.3d 1045, 1052 (M.D. Fla. 2021) (requiring that officers inquire \ninto the availability of shelter space before an arrest could be made for \nviolation of the City’s “open lodging” ordinance).  If it is determined at \nthe enforcement stage that a homeless individual has access to shelter, \nthen they do not benefit from the injunction and may be cited or \nprosecuted under the anti-camping ordinances.  Moreover, as we noted \nabove, several classes of homeless individuals have been certified in the \npast. See supra note 20. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 40 of 155\n40  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nare never class members.24  Because we find there existed at \nleast one question of law or fact common to the class, the \ndistrict  court  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  in  concluding \ncommonality was satisfied.   \nTypicality asks whether “the claims or defenses of the \nrepresentative parties are typical” of the class.  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(a)(3).  Typicality is a “permissive standard[].”  Staton \nv. Boeing Co., 327 F.3d 938, 957 (9th Cir. 2003) (citation \nomitted).  It “refers to the nature of the claim or defense of \nthe class representative, and not to the specific facts from \nwhich it arose or the relief sought.”  Parsons, 754 F.3d at \n685 (citation omitted).   \nThe  class  representatives’  claims  and  defenses  are \ntypical of the class in that they are homeless persons who \nclaim that the City cannot enforce the challenged ordinances \nagainst them when they have no shelter.  The defenses that \napply  to  class  representatives  and  class  members  are \nidentical.  The claims of class representatives and class \nmembers are similar, except that some class representatives \nlive in vehicles while other class members may live on \nstreets  or  in  parks,  not  vehicles.    This  does  not  defeat \ntypicality.    The  class  representatives  with  vehicles  may \nviolate the challenged ordinances in a different manner than \nsome  class  members—i.e.,  by  sleeping  in  their  vehicle, \nrather than on the ground.  But they challenge the same \nordinances under the same constitutional provisions as other \n \n24 We do not, as the dissent contends, “suggest[ ] that the class definition \nrequires only an involuntary lack of access to regular or permanent \nshelter to qualify as ‘involuntarily homeless.’”  Dissent 84.  It is unclear \nwhere the dissent finds this in the opinion.  To be clear: A person with \naccess to temporary shelter is not involuntarily homeless unless and until \nthey no longer have access to shelter.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 41 of 155\n  JOHNSON V.

The \ndistrict  court  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  in  finding  the \ntypicality requirement met.  \nThe City does not present any other arguments regarding \nclass certification, such as the propriety of certifying the \nclass as an injunctive class under Rule 23(b)(2).  We do not \nmake arguments for parties and the arguments raised by the \nCity regarding class certification fail. \nC. \nHaving rejected the City’s jurisdictional arguments, as \nwell as its arguments regarding class certification, the merits \ncan be addressed.  The City’s merits arguments regarding the \nCruel and Unusual Punishment Clause take two forms.  First, \nthe City argues its system of imposing civil fines cannot be \nchallenged  as  violating  the  Cruel  and  Unusual  Clause \nbecause that clause provides protection only in criminal \nproceedings, after an individual has been convicted.  That is \nincorrect.  Second, the City argues Martin does not protect \nhomeless persons from being cited under the City’s amended \nanti-camping ordinance which prohibits use of any bedding \nor similar protection from the elements.  The City appears to \nhave conceded it cannot cite homeless persons merely for \nsleeping in public but the City maintains it is entitled to cite \nindividuals for the use of rudimentary bedding supplies, such \nas a blanket, pillow, or sleeping bag “for bedding purposes.”  \nSee GPMC 5.61.010(B).  Again, the City is incorrect.  Here, \nwe focus exclusively on the anti-camping ordinances. \nAccording to the City, citing individuals under the anti-\ncamping ordinances cannot violate the Cruel and Unusual \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 42 of 155\n42  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nPunishment Clause because citations under the ordinances \nare  civil  and  civil  citations  are  “categorically  not \n‘punishment’ under the Eight Amendment.”25  The City \nexplains “the simple act of issuing a civil citation with a \ncourt date [has never] been found to be unconstitutional \n‘punishment’ under the Eighth Amendment.”  While not \nentirely clear, the City appears to be arguing the Cruel and \nUnusual Punishment Clause provides no protection from \ncitations  categorized  as  “civil”  by  a  governmental \nauthority.26 \n \n25 This position is in significant tension with the City’s actions taken \nimmediately after Martin was issued.  As noted earlier, the City amended \nits anti-camping ordinance “in direct response to Martin v. Boise” to \nallow for “the act of ‘sleeping’” in City parks.  If the City believed \nMartin has no impact on civil ordinances, it is unclear why the City \nbelieved a curative “response” to Martin was necessary.      \n26 The primary support for this contention is Ingraham v. Wright, 430 \nU.S. 651 (1977).  In Ingraham, the Supreme Court addressed whether \nthe Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause was implicated by corporal \npunishment in public schools.  The Court stated the Cruel and Unusual \nPunishment Clause limits “the criminal process in three ways: First, it \nlimits the kinds of punishment that can be imposed on those convicted \nof crimes; second, it proscribes punishment grossly disproportionate to \nthe severity of the crime; and third, it imposes substantive limits on what \ncan be made criminal and punished as such.”  Id. at 667.  The Court \ninterpreted the challenge to corporal punishment as, in effect, asserting \narguments under  only  the first  or  second  limitation.   That  is,  the \nchallenge  was  whether  “the  paddling  of  schoolchildren”  was  a \npermissible amount or type of punishment.  Id. at 668.  The Ingraham \ndecision involved no analysis or discussion of the third limitation, i.e. \nthe “substantive limits on what can be made criminal.”  Id. at 667.  Thus, \nit was in the context of evaluating the amount or type of punishment that \nIngraham stated “Eighth Amendment scrutiny is appropriate only after \nthe State has complied with the constitutional guarantees traditionally \nassociated with criminal prosecutions.”  Id. at 671 n.40.  When, as here, \nplaintiffs are raising challenges to the “substantive limits on what can be \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 43 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    43 \nPlaintiffs’ focus on civil citations does involve an extra \nstep from the normal Cruel and Unusual Clause analysis and \nthe analysis of Martin.  Usually, claims under the Cruel and \nUnusual Clause involve straightforward criminal charges.  \nFor  example, the situation in Martin involved  homeless \npersons  allegedly  violating  criminal  ordinances  and  the \nopinion identified its analysis as focusing on the “criminal” \nnature of the charges over ten times.  920 F.3d at 617.  Here, \nthe City has adopted a slightly more circuitous approach than \nsimply establishing violation of its ordinances as criminal \noffenses.  Instead, the City issues civil citations under the \nordinances.  If an individual violates the ordinances twice, \nshe  can  be  issued  a  park  exclusion  order.    And  if  the \nindividual is found in a park after issuance of the park \nexclusion  order,  she  is  cited  for  criminal  trespass.    See \nO.R.S. 164.245 (criminal trespass in the second degree).  \nMultiple City police officers explained in their depositions \nthis sequence was the standard protocol.  The holding in \nMartin cannot be so easily evaded. \nMartin held the Cruel and Unusual Punishment clause \n“prohibits the imposition of criminal penalties for sitting, \nsleeping, or lying outside on public property for homeless \nindividuals who cannot obtain shelter.”  920 F.3d at 616.  A \nlocal government cannot avoid this ruling by issuing civil \ncitations that, later, become criminal offenses.  A recent \ndecision by the en banc Fourth Circuit illustrates how the \n \nmade  criminal,”  Ingraham  does  not  prohibit  a  challenge  before  a \ncriminal conviction.  See Martin, 920 F.3d at 614 (“Ingraham did not \nhold that a plaintiff challenging the state’s power to criminalize a \nparticular status or conduct in the first instance, as the plaintiffs in this \ncase do, must first be convicted.”). \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 44 of 155\n44  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nCruel and Unusual Punishment Clause looks to the eventual \ncriminal penalty, even if there are preliminary civil steps.   \nThe  disputes  in  Manning  v.  Caldwell  for  City  of \nRoanoke, 930 F.3d 264 (4th Cir. 2019) (en banc) arose from \na Virginia law which allowed a state court to issue a civil \norder identifying an individual as a “habitual drunkard.”  Id. \nat 268.  Once labeled a “habitual drunkard,” the individual \nwas “subject to incarceration for the mere possession of or \nattempt to possess alcohol, or for being drunk in public.”  Id. \nat 269.  A group of homeless alcoholics filed suit claiming, \namong  other  theories,  the  “habitual  drunkard”  scheme \nviolated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause.  In the \nplaintiffs’ view, the scheme resulted in criminal prosecutions \nbased on their “status,” i.e. alcoholism.  See id. at 281. \nUsing reasoning very similar to that in Martin, the Fourth \nCircuit found the statutory scheme unconstitutional because \nit provided punishment based on the plaintiffs’ status.  Of \nparticular relevance here, the Fourth Circuit reasoned the \nfact that Virginia’s “scheme operate[d] in two steps” did not \nchange the analysis.  Id. 283.  Issuing a civil order first, \nfollowed by a criminal charge, was a “two-pronged statutory \nscheme”  potentially  “less  direct”  than  straightforwardly \ncriminalizing the status of alcohol addiction.  Id.  But the \nscheme remained unconstitutional because it “effectively \ncriminalize[d] an illness.”  Id. The fact that Virginia “civilly \nbrands alcoholics as ‘habitual drunkards’ before prosecuting \nthem for involuntary manifestations of their illness does \nnothing  to  cure  the  unconstitutionality  of  this  statutory \nscheme.”  Id.  \nThe same reasoning applies here.  The anti-camping \nordinances prohibit Plaintiffs from engaging in activity they \ncannot  avoid.    The  civil  citations  issued  for  behavior \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 45 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    45 \nPlaintiffs cannot avoid are then followed by a civil park \nexclusion order and, eventually, prosecutions for criminal \ntrespass.  Imposing a few extra steps before criminalizing the \nvery acts Martin explicitly says cannot be criminalized does \nnot cure the anti-camping ordinances’ Eighth Amendment \ninfirmity.     \nThe City offers a second way to evade the holding in \nMartin.  According to the City, it revised its anti-camping \nordinances to allow homeless persons to sleep in City parks.  \nHowever, the City’s argument regarding the revised anti-\ncamping ordinance is an illusion.  The amended ordinance \ncontinues to prohibit homeless persons from using “bedding, \nsleeping bag, or other material used for bedding purposes,” \nor using stoves, lighting fires, or erecting structures of any \nkind.  GPMC 5.61.010.  The City claims homeless persons \nare  free  to  sleep  in  City  parks,  but  only  without  items \nnecessary to facilitate sleeping outdoors.27   \nThe  discrepancy  between  sleeping  without  bedding \nmaterials,  which  is  permitted  under  the  anti-camping \nordinances,  and  sleeping  with  bedding,  which  is  not,  is \nintended to distinguish the anti-camping ordinances from \nMartin and the two Supreme Court precedents underlying \nMartin, Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660 (1962) and \n \n27 The Grants Pass ordinance does not specifically define “bedding” but \ncourts  give  the  words  of  a  statute  or  ordinance  their  “ordinary, \ncontemporary, common meaning” absent an indication to the contrary \nfrom the legislature.  See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 420, 431 (2000) \n(citation omitted).  The Oxford English Dictionary defines “bedding” as \n“[a] collective term for the articles which compose a bed.”  OXFORD \nENGLISH DICTIONARY.  And “bed” is defined as “a place for sleeping.”  \nMERRIAM-WEBSTER COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 108 (11th ed.).  The \nCity’s effort to dissociate the use of bedding from the act of sleeping or \nprotection from the elements is nonsensical.   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 46 of 155\n46  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nPowell v. Texas, 392 U.S. 514 (1968).  Under those cases, a \nperson may not be prosecuted for conduct that is involuntary \nor the product of a “status.”  See Martin, 920 F.3d at 617 \n(citation omitted).  The City accordingly argues that sleeping \nis  involuntary  conduct  for  a  homeless  person,  but  that \nhomeless  persons  can  choose  to  sleep  without  bedding \nmaterials and therefore can be prosecuted for sleeping with \nbedding. \nIn its order granting summary judgment, the district \ncourt  correctly  concluded  the  anti-camping  ordinances \nviolated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause to the \nextent  they  prohibited  homeless  persons  from  “taking \nnecessary minimal measures to keep themselves warm and \ndry while sleeping when there are no alternative forms of \nshelter available.”  The only plausible reading of Martin is \nthat it applies to the act of “sleeping” in public, including \narticles  necessary  to  facilitate  sleep.    In  fact,  Martin \nexpressed concern regarding a citation given to a woman \nwho had been found sleeping on the ground, wrapped in \nblankets.  920 F.3d at 618.  Martin noted that citation as an \nexample  of  the  anti-camping  ordinance  being  “enforced \nagainst  homeless  individuals  who  take  even  the  most \nrudimentary  precautions  to  protect  themselves  from  the \nelements.”    Id.    Martin  deemed  such  enforcement \nunconstitutional.  Id.  It follows that the City cannot enforce \nits anti-camping ordinances to the extent they prohibit “the \nmost rudimentary precautions” a homeless person might \ntake against the elements.28  The City’s position that it is \n \n28 Grants Pass is cold in the winter.

The dissent concedes that pursuant to Martin, \nthe City cannot impose criminal penalties on involuntarily \nhomeless individuals for sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on \npublic property.  Dissent 62.  Thus, our purported “complete \ndisregard[ ]” for Martin is not regarding the central holding \nthat  local  governments  may  not  criminalize  involuntary \nconduct.    Rather,  the  dissent  believes,  based  on  its \ninterpretation of the Supreme Court opinions underlying \nMartin, that the Eighth Amendment provides only “a case-\nspecific affirmative defense” that can never be litigated on a \nclass basis.  Dissent 59.  To reach this counterintuitive \nconclusion,  the  dissent  reads  limitations  into  Robinson, \nPowell, and Martin that are nonexistent.    \nIn Robinson, the Supreme Court struck down, under the \nEighth Amendment, a California law that made “it a criminal \noffense for a person to ‘be addicted to the use of narcotics.’”  \nRobinson, 370 U.S. at 666.

He stressed, “[i]f it cannot be a crime to have an \nirresistible compulsion to use narcotics, I do not see how it \ncan  constitutionally  be  a  crime  to  yield  to  such  a \ncompulsion.”  Id. at 549 (White, J., concurring).  However, \nthe reason for Justice White’s concurrence was that he felt \nPowell failed to prove his status as an alcoholic compelled \nhim to violate the law by appearing in public. Id. at 553 \n(White, J., concurring).   \nPursuant to Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188 (1977), \nthe narrowest position which gained the support of five \njustices is treated as the holding of the Court.  In identifying \nthat position, Martin held: “five Justices [in Powell] gleaned \nfrom  Robinson  the  principle  that  ‘that  the  Eighth \nAmendment  prohibits  the  state  from  punishing  an \ninvoluntary  act  or  condition  if  it  is  the  unavoidable \nconsequence of one’s status or being.’”   Martin, 920 F.3d at \n616 (quoting Jones, 443 F.3d at 1135).  Martin did not—as \nthe dissent alleges—hold that Powell’s “controlling opinion \nwas Justice White’s concurrence.”  Dissent 60.  See id., 920 \nF.3d at 616-17.  It would have violated the rule of Marks to \nadopt portions of Justice White’s concurrence that did not \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 49 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    49 \nreceive the support of five justices.  The dissent claims \nJustice  White’s  concurrence  requires  that  the  individual \nclaiming  a  status  must  prove  the  status  compels  the \nindividual  to  violate  the  law—here,  that  each  homeless \nindividual  must  prove  their  status  as  an  involuntarily \nhomeless person to avoid prosecution.29  Dissent 59-63.  The \n \n29 The dissent’s attempt to create a governing holding out of Justice \nWhite’s concurrence is erroneous.  By citing a word or two out of context \nin the Powell dissenting opinion (e.g., “constitutional defense”) our \ndissenting  colleague  argues  both  Justice  White  and  the  dissenting \njustices in Powell agreed any person subject to prosecution has, at most, \n“a case-specific affirmative ‘defense.’”  Dissent 59-60, 77.  We disagree.  \nThough status was litigated as a defense in the context of Leroy Powell’s \nprosecution, no opinion in Powell held status may be raised only as a \ndefense.  The Powell plurality noted trial court evidence that Leroy \nPowell was an alcoholic, but that opinion contains no indication “status” \nmay only be invoked as “a case-specific affirmative ‘defense.’”  As for \nJustice White, the opening paragraph of his concurrence indicates he was \nprimarily concerned not with how a status must be invoked but with the \nfact that certain statuses should be beyond the reach of the criminal law: \nIf  it  cannot  be  a  crime  to  have  an  irresistible \ncompulsion to use narcotics, I do not see how it can \nconstitutionally  be  a  crime  to  yield  to  such  a \ncompulsion.  Punishing  an  addict  for  using  drugs \nconvicts  for  addiction  under  a  different  name. \nDistinguishing  between  the  two  crimes  is  like \nforbidding criminal conviction for being sick with flu \nor epilepsy but permitting punishment for running a \nfever or having a convulsion. Unless Robinson is to be \nabandoned, the use of narcotics by an addict must be \nbeyond the reach of the criminal law. Similarly, the \nchronic alcoholic with an irresistible urge to consume \nalcohol should not be punishable for drinking or for \nbeing drunk. \nPowell, 392 U.S. at 548-49 (White, J., concurring) (internal citation \nomitted).  Finally, neither the remainder of Justice White’s concurrence \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 50 of 155\n50  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \ndissent  claims  this  renders  class  action  litigation \ninappropriate.  But no opinion in either Powell or Martin \ndiscussed the propriety of litigating the constitutionality of \nsuch criminal statutes by way of a class action.30  \nThe law that the dissent purports to unearth in Justice \nWhite’s concurrence is not the “narrowest ground” which \nreceived the support of five justices.  No opinion in Powell \nor Martin supports the dissent’s assertion that Powell offers \nexclusively  an  “affirmative  ‘defense’”  that  cannot  be \nlitigated in a class action.31  Dissent 59, 77.  Although the \n \nnor the dissenting opinion explicitly indicates one’s status may only be \ninvoked as a defense.  Rather, Justice White and the dissenters simply \nagreed that, if Powell’s status made his public intoxication involuntary, \nhe could not be prosecuted.  There is no conceivable way to interpret \nMartin as adopting our dissenting colleague’s position that one’s status \nmust be invoked as a defense.  But even assuming the burden must be \nplaced on the party wishing to invoke a status, the class representatives \nestablished there is no genuine dispute of material fact they have the \nrelevant status of being involuntarily homeless. \n30 Federal courts have certified classes of homeless plaintiffs in the past, \nsee supra note 20, which counsels against the City’s and the dissent’s \nposition that such classes are impermissible under Rule 23.  \n31 As noted above, Martin did not hold homeless persons bear the burden \nof demonstrating they are involuntarily homeless.  See supra note 29.  \nBecause the record plainly demonstrates Plaintiffs are involuntarily \nhomeless, there similarly is no reason for us to determine what showing \nwould be required.  We note, however, that some district courts have \naddressed circumstances in which the question of burden was somewhat \nrelevant.  See, e.g., McArdle, 519 F.Supp.3d at 1052 (requiring, based in \npart on Martin, that officers inquire into the availability of shelter space \nbefore making an arrest for violation of the City’s “open lodging” \nordinance); Butcher v. City of Marysville, 2019 WL 918203, at *7 (E.D. \nCal. Feb. 25, 2019) (holding plaintiffs failed to make the “threshold \nshowing” of pleading that there was no shelter capacity and that they had \nno other housing at the time of enforcement). \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 51 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    51 \ndissent might prefer that these principles find support in the \ncontrolling law, they do not.  We thus do not misread Martin \nby failing to apply the principles found solely in Justice \nWhite’s  concurrence.    Rather,  we  adhere  to  the  narrow \nholding of Martin adopting the narrowest ground shared by \nfive justices in Powell: a person cannot be prosecuted for \ninvoluntary conduct if it is an unavoidable consequence of \none’s status.   \nIn addition to erecting an absolute bar to class litigation \nof  this  sort,  the  dissent  would  also  impose  artificial \nlimitations  on  claims  brought  pursuant  to  Martin.    The \ndissent  concedes  Gloria  Johnson  has  standing  to  bring \nindividual challenges to most of the City’s ordinances.  But \nthe dissent then speculates that Gloria Johnson may, in fact, \nnot be involuntarily homeless in the City.  The dissent would \ninsist that Gloria Johnson, for example, leave the City to \ncamp illegally on federal or state lands, provide the court an \naccounting of her finances and employment history, and \nindicate with specificity where she lived before she lost her \njob and her home.  Dissent 85-88.  There, of course, exists \nno law or rule requiring a homeless person to do any of these \nthings.  Gloria Johnson has adequately demonstrated that \nthere is no available shelter in Grants Pass and that she is \ninvoluntarily homeless. \nThe undisputed evidence establishes Gloria Johnson is \ninvoluntarily  homeless  and  there  is  undisputed  evidence \nshowing many other individuals in similar situations.  It is \nundisputed that there are at least around 50 involuntarily \nhomeless persons in Grants Pass, and PIT counts, which \nMartin relied on to establish the number of homeless persons \nin Boise, revealed more than 600.  See Martin, 920 F.3d at \n604.  It is undisputed that there is no secular shelter space \navailable to adults.  Many class members, including the class \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 52 of 155\n52  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nrepresentatives, have sworn they are homeless and the City \nhas not contested those declarations.  The dissent claims this \nshowing is not enough, implying that Plaintiffs must meet an \nextremely  high  standard  to  show  they  are  involuntarily \nhomeless.  Even viewed in the light most favorable to the \nCity, there is no dispute of material fact that the City is home \nto many involuntarily homeless individuals, including the \nclass representatives.  In fact, neither the City nor the dissent \nhas demonstrated there is even one voluntarily homeless \nindividual living in the City.32  In light of the undisputed \nfacts in the record underlying the district court’s summary \njudgment  ruling  that  show  Plaintiffs  are  involuntarily \nhomeless,  and  the  complete  absence  of  evidence  that \nPlaintiffs are voluntarily homeless, we agree with the district \ncourt  that  Plaintiffs  such  as  Gloria  Johnson  are  not \nvoluntarily homeless and that the anti-camping ordinances \nare unconstitutional as applied to them unless there is some \nplace, such as shelter, they can lawfully sleep.33 \n \n32 The dissent claims we have “shifted the burden to the City to establish \nthe voluntariness of the behavior targeted by the ordinances.”  Dissent \n87 n.13 (emphasis omitted).  To the contrary, as we have explained, we \ndo not decide who would bear such a burden because undisputed \nevidence demonstrates Plaintiffs are involuntarily homeless.  Rather, \nwithout deciding who would bear such a burden if involuntariness were \nsubject  to  serious  dispute,  we  note  Plaintiffs  have  demonstrated \ninvoluntariness and there is no evidence in the record showing any class \nmember has adequate alternative shelter.  \n33  Following  Martin,  several  district  courts  have  held  that  the \ngovernment may evict or punish sleeping in public in some locations, \nprovided  there  are  other  lawful  places  within  the  jurisdiction  for \ninvoluntarily homeless individuals to sleep.  See, e.g., Shipp v. Schaaf, \n379 F.Supp.3d 1033, 1037 (N.D. Cal. 2019) (“However, even assuming \n(as Plaintiffs do) that [eviction from a homeless encampment by citation \nor arrest] might occur, remaining at a particular encampment on public \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 53 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    53 \nOur holding that the City’s interpretation of the anti-\ncamping  ordinances  is  counter  to  Martin  is  not  to  be \ninterpreted to hold that the anti-camping ordinances were \nproperly  enjoined  in  their  entirety.    Beyond  prohibiting \nbedding, the ordinances also prohibit the use of stoves or \nfires, as well as the erection of any structures.  The record \nhas not established the fire, stove, and structure prohibitions \ndeprive homeless persons of sleep or “the most rudimentary \nprecautions” against the elements.34  Moreover, the record \ndoes not explain the City’s interest in these prohibitions.35  \n \nproperty is not conduct protected by Martin, especially where the closure \nis temporary in nature.”); Aitken v. City of Aberdeen, 393 F.Supp.3d \n1075, 1082 (W.D. Wash. 2019) (“Martin does not limit the City’s ability \nto evict homeless individuals from particular public places.”); Gomes v. \nCty. of Kauai, 481 F.Supp.3d 1104, 1109 (D. Haw. 2020) (holding the \nCounty of Kauai could prohibit sleeping in a public park because it had \nnot  prohibited  sleeping  on  other  public  lands);  Miralle  v.  City  of \nOakland, 2018 WL 6199929, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 28, 2018) (holding \nthe City could clear out a specific homeless encampment because \n“Martin  does  not  establish  a  constitutional  right  to  occupy  public \nproperty indefinitely at Plaintiffs’ option”); Le Van Hung v. Schaaf, 2019 \nWL 1779584, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 23, 2019) (holding Martin does not \n“create a right for homeless residents to occupy indefinitely any public \nspace of their choosing”).  Because the City has not established any \nrealistically available place within the jurisdiction for involuntarily \nhomeless individuals to sleep we need not decide whether alternate \noutdoor space would be sufficient under Martin.  The district court may \nconsider this issue on remand, if it is germane to do so.   \n34 The dissent claims we establish “the right to use (at least) a tent.”  \nDissent 89 n.15.  This assertion is obviously false.  The district court’s \nholding that the City may still “ban the use of tents in public parks” \nremains undisturbed by our opinion.   \n35 The dissent asserts, “it is hard to deny that Martin has ‘generate[d] dire \npractical consequences for the hundreds of local governments within our \njurisdiction, and for the millions of people that reside therein.’”  Dissent \n92 (quoting Martin, 920 F.3d at 594 (M. Smith, J., dissenting from denial \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 54 of 155\n54  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nConsistent with Martin, these prohibitions may or may not \nbe  permissible.    On  remand,  the  district  court  will  be \nrequired  to  craft  a  narrower  injunction  recognizing \nPlaintiffs’ limited right to protection against the elements, as \nwell as limitations when a shelter bed is available.36    \nD. \nThe district court concluded the fines imposed under the \nanti-sleeping  and  anti-camping  ordinances  violated  the \nEighth Amendment’s prohibition on excessive fines.  A \ncentral portion of the district court’s analysis regarding these \nfines was that they were based on conduct “beyond what the \nCity may constitutionally punish.”  With this in mind, the \ndistrict court noted “[a]ny fine [would be] excessive” for the \nconduct at issue.   \nThe City presents no meaningful argument on appeal \nregarding the excessive fines issue.  As for Plaintiffs, they \nargue the fines at issue were properly deemed excessive \nbecause they were imposed for “engaging in involuntary, \nunavoidable life sustaining acts.”  The permanent injunction \nwill result in no class member being fined for engaging in \nsuch protected activity.  Because no fines will be imposed \n \nof rehearing en banc)) (modification in original).  There are no facts in \nthe record to establish that Martin has generated “dire” consequences for \nthe City.  Our review of this case is governed only by the evidence \ncontained in the record.   \n36 The district court enjoined the park exclusion ordinance in its entirety.  \nThe parties do not address this in their appellate briefing but, on remand, \nthe district court should consider narrowing this portion as well because \nthe  park  exclusion ordinance  presumably  may be  enforced  against \nPlaintiffs who engage in prohibited activity unrelated to their status as \nhomeless persons.   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 55 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    55 \nfor protected activity, there is no need for us to address \nwhether hypothetical fines would be excessive.   \nE. \nThe final issue is whether Plaintiffs properly pled their \nchallenge to the park exclusion appeals ordinance.  GPMC \n6.46.355.  That ordinance provided a mechanism whereby \nan individual who received an exclusion order could appeal \nto the City Council.  Subsequent to the district court’s order, \nthe  City  amended  its  park  exclusion  appeals  ordinance.  \nTherefore, the district court’s determination the previous \nordinance violated Plaintiffs’ procedural due process rights \nhas no prospective relevance.  Because of this, we need not \ndecide if Plaintiffs adequately pled their challenge to the \nprevious ordinance.   \nIII. \nWe affirm the district court’s ruling that the City of \nGrants Pass cannot, consistent with the Eighth Amendment, \nenforce  its  anti-camping  ordinances  against  homeless \npersons  for  the  mere  act  of  sleeping  outside  with \nrudimentary protection from the elements, or for sleeping in \ntheir car at night, when there is no other place in the City for \nthem to go.  On remand, however, the district court must \nnarrow its injunction to enjoin only those portions of the \nanti-camping ordinances that prohibit conduct protected by \nMartin and this opinion.  In particular, the district court \nshould narrow its injunction to the anti-camping ordinances \nand enjoin enforcement of those ordinances only against \ninvoluntarily  homeless  person  for  engaging  in  conduct \nnecessary to protect themselves from the elements when \nthere is no shelter space available.  Finally, the district court \non remand should consider whether there is an adequate \nrepresentative who may be substituted for Debra Blake. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 56 of 155\n56  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nWe are careful to note that, as in Martin, our decision is \nnarrow.    As  in  Martin,  we  hold  simply  that  it  is \n“unconstitutional to [punish] simply sleeping somewhere in \npublic if one has nowhere else to do so.”  Martin, 920 F.3d \nat 590 (Berzon, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en \nbanc).  Our decision reaches beyond Martin slightly.  We \nhold, where Martin did not, that class certification is not \ncategorically  impermissible  in  cases  such  as  this,  that \n“sleeping” in the context of Martin includes sleeping with \nrudimentary forms of protection from the elements, and that \nMartin applies to civil citations where, as here, the civil and \ncriminal punishments are closely intertwined.  Our decision \ndoes not address a regime of purely civil infractions, nor \ndoes it prohibit the City from attempting other solutions to \nthe homelessness issue. \nAFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND \nREMANDED.  \n \n \nCOLLINS, Circuit Judge, dissenting:  \nIn Martin v. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584 (9th Cir. 2019), \nwe held that “the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel \nand unusual punishment bars a city from prosecuting people \ncriminally for sleeping outside on public property when \nthose people have no home or other shelter to go to.”  Id. at \n603.  Even assuming that Martin remains good law, today’s \ndecision—which  both  misreads  and  greatly  expands \nMartin’s holding—is egregiously wrong.  To make things \nworse,  the  majority  opinion  then  combines  its  gross \nmisreading of Martin with a flagrant disregard of settled \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 57 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    57 \nclass-certification  principles.    The  end  result  of  this \namalgamation of error is that the majority validates the core \naspects of the district court’s extraordinary injunction in this \ncase, which effectively requires the City of Grants Pass to \nallow all but one of its public parks to be used as homeless \nencampments.1  I respectfully dissent.   \nI \nBecause our opinion in Martin frames the issues here, I \nbegin  with  a  detailed  overview  of  that  decision  before \nturning to the facts of the case before us. \nA \nIn Martin, six individuals sued the City of Boise, Idaho, \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the City had violated \ntheir Eighth Amendment rights in enforcing two ordinances \nthat respectively barred, inter alia, (1) camping in public \nspaces and (2) sleeping in public places without permission.  \n920  F.3d  at  603–04,  606.    All  six  plaintiffs  had  been \nconvicted of violating at least one of the ordinances, id. at \n606, but we held that claims for retrospective relief based on \nthose convictions were barred by the doctrine of Heck v. \nHumphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994).  See Martin, 920 F.3d at \n611–12 (noting that, under Heck, a § 1983 action may not be \nmaintained if success in the suit would necessarily show the \ninvalidity of the plaintiff’s criminal conviction, unless that \nconviction has already been set aside or invalidated).  What \nremained, after application of the Heck bar, were the claims \n \n1 The majority’s decision is all the more troubling because, in truth, the \nfoundation on which it is built is deeply flawed: Martin seriously \nmisconstrued the Eighth Amendment and the Supreme Court’s caselaw \nconstruing it.  See infra at 90–92.  But I am bound by Martin, and—\nunlike the majority—I faithfully apply it here. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 58 of 155\n58  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nfor retrospective relief asserted by two plaintiffs (Robert \nMartin and Pamela Hawkes) in connection with citations \nthey had received that did not result in convictions, and the \nclaims  for  prospective  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief \nasserted  by  Martin  and  one  additional  plaintiff  (Robert \nAnderson).  Id. at 604, 610, 613–15; see also id. at 618–20 \n(Owens,  J.,  dissenting  in  part)  (dissenting  from  the \nmajority’s holding that the prospective relief claims survived \nHeck).    On  the  merits  of  those  three  plaintiffs’  Eighth \nAmendment claims, the Martin panel held that the district \ncourt had erred in granting summary judgment for the City.  \nId. at 615–18. \nAlthough the text of the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and \nUnusual Punishments Clause states only that “cruel and \nunusual punishments” shall not be “inflicted,” U.S. CONST., \namend. VIII (emphasis added), the Martin panel nonetheless \nheld  that  the  Clause  “places  substantive  limits”  on  the \ngovernment’s  ability  to  criminalize  “sitting,  sleeping,  or \nlying outside on public property,” 920 F.3d at 615–16.  In \nreaching this conclusion, the Martin panel placed dispositive \nreliance on the Supreme Court’s decisions in Robinson v. \nCalifornia, 370 U.S. 660 (1962), and Powell v. Texas, 392 \nU.S.  514  (1968).    I  therefore  briefly  review  those  two \ndecisions before returning to Martin. \nRobinson held that a California law that made “it a \ncriminal offense for a person to ‘be addicted to the use of \nnarcotics,’”  370  U.S.  at  660  (quoting  CAL.  HEALTH  & \nSAFETY CODE § 11721 (1957 ed.)), and that did so “even \nthough [the person] has never touched any narcotic drug \nwithin the State or been guilty of any irregular behavior \nthere, inflicts a cruel and unusual punishment in violation of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment,” id. at 667.  The California \nstatute, the Court emphasized, made the “‘status’ of narcotic \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 59 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    59 \naddiction  a  criminal  offense,”  regardless  of  whether  the \ndefendant had “ever used or possessed any narcotics within \nthe State” or had “been guilty of any antisocial behavior \nthere.”  Id. at 666 (emphasis added). \nIn Powell, a fractured Supreme Court rejected Powell’s \nchallenge to his conviction, under a Texas statute, for being \n“found in a state of intoxication in any public place.”  392 \nU.S. at 517 (quoting TEX. PENAL CODE art. 477 (1952)).  A \nfour-Justice plurality distinguished Robinson on the ground \nthat, because Powell “was convicted, not for being a chronic \nalcoholic, but for being in public while drunk on a particular \noccasion,” Texas had “not sought to punish a mere status, as \nCalifornia did in Robinson.”  Id. at 532 (plurality).  The \nplurality  held  that  Robinson  did  not  address,  much  less \nestablish, that “certain conduct cannot constitutionally be \npunished  because  it  is,  in  some  sense,  ‘involuntary’  or \n‘occasioned by a compulsion.’”  Id. at 533 (emphasis added).   \nJustice White concurred in the judgment on the narrower \nground that Powell had failed to establish the “prerequisites \nto the possible invocation of the Eighth Amendment,” which \nwould have required him to “satisfactorily show[] that it was \nnot feasible for him to have made arrangements to prevent \nhis  being  in  public  when  drunk  and  that  his  extreme \ndrunkenness sufficiently deprived him of his faculties on the \noccasion in issue.”  Id. at 552 (White, J., concurring).  And \nbecause, in Justice White’s view, the Eighth Amendment at \nmost  provided  a  case-specific  affirmative  “defense”  to \napplication of the statute, id. at 552 n.4, he agreed that the \nTexas statute was “constitutional insofar as it authorizes a \npolice  officer  to  arrest  any  seriously  intoxicated  person \nwhen he is encountered in a public place,” id. at 554 n.5 \n(emphasis added).  Emphasizing that Powell himself “did \nnot show that his conviction offended the Constitution” and \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 60 of 155\n60  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nthat Powell had “made no showing that he was unable to stay \noff  the  streets  on  the  night  in  question,”  Justice  White \nconcurred  in  the  majority’s  affirmance  of  Powell’s \nconviction.  Id. at 554 (emphasis added). \nThe four dissenting Justices in Powell agreed that the \nTexas statute “differ[ed] from that in Robinson” inasmuch as \nit “covers more than a mere status.”  392 U.S. at 567 (Fortas, \nJ., dissenting).  There was, as the dissenters noted, “no \nchallenge here to the validity of public intoxication statutes \nin general or to the Texas public intoxication statute in \nparticular.”  Id. at 558.  Indeed, the dissenters agreed that, in \nthe  ordinary  case  “when  the  State  proves  such  [public] \npresence in a state of intoxication, this will be sufficient for \nconviction, and the punishment prescribed by the State may, \nof course, be validly imposed.”  Id. at 569.  Instead, the \ndissenters concluded that the application of the statute to \nPowell was unconstitutional “on the occasion in question” \nin light of the Texas trial court’s findings about Powell’s \ninability to control his condition.  Id. at 568 n.31 (emphasis \nadded).  Those findings concerning Powell’s “constitutional \ndefense,” the dissenters concluded, established that Powell \n“was  powerless  to  avoid  drinking”  and  “that,  once \nintoxicated, he could not prevent himself from appearing in \npublic places.”  Id. at 558, 568; see also id. at 525 (plurality) \n(describing the elements of the “constitutional defense” that \nPowell sought to have the Court recognize).   \nWhile acknowledging that the plurality in Powell had \n“interpret[ed]  Robinson  as  precluding  only  the \ncriminalization of ‘status,’ not of ‘involuntary’ conduct,” the \nMartin panel held that the controlling opinion was Justice \nWhite’s concurrence.  920 F.3d at 616.  As I have noted, \nJustice White concluded that the Texas statute against public \ndrunkenness could constitutionally be applied, even to an \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 61 of 155\n  JOHNSON V.

United States, 430 \nU.S. 188 (1977), this narrower reasoning given by Justice \nWhite for joining the Powell majority’s judgment upholding \nthe conviction constitutes the Court’s holding in that case.  \nSee id. at 193 (“When a fragmented Court decides a case and \nno single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of \nfive Justices, ‘the holding of the Court may be viewed as that \nposition taken by those Members who  concurred in the \njudgments on the narrowest grounds.’” (citation omitted)); \nsee also United States v. Moore, 486 F.2d 1139, 1151 (D.C. \nCir. 1973) (en banc) (Wilkey, J., concurring) (concluding \nthat the judgment in Powell rested on the overlap in the \nviews  of  “four  members  of  the  Court”  who  held  that \nPowell’s  acts  of  public  drunkenness  “were  punishable \nwithout  question”  and  the  view  of  Justice  White  that \nPowell’s acts “were punishable so long as the acts had not \nbeen proved to be the product of an established irresistible \ncompulsion”). \nThe  Martin  panel  quoted  dicta  in  Justice  White’s \nconcurrence suggesting that, if the defendant could make the \nrequisite  “showing”  that  “resisting  drunkenness  is \n \n2 Justice White, however, did not resolve the further question of whether, \nif such a showing had been made, the Eighth Amendment would have \nbeen  violated.

These dicta, Martin noted, overlapped with \nsimilar statements in the dissenting opinion in Powell, and \nfrom  those  two  opinions,  the  Martin  panel  derived  the \nproposition that “five Justices” had endorsed the view that \n“the Eighth Amendment prohibits the state from punishing \nan  involuntary  act  or  condition  if  it  is  the  unavoidable \nconsequence of one’s status or being.”  Id. (citation omitted).  \nApplying  that  principle,  Martin  held  that  “the  Eighth \nAmendment prohibits the imposition of criminal penalties \nfor sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public property for \nhomeless  individuals  who  cannot  obtain  shelter.”    Id.  \nBecause “human beings are biologically compelled to rest, \nwhether by sitting, lying, or sleeping,” Martin held that \nprohibitions on such activities in public cannot be applied to \nthose who simply have “no option of sleeping indoors.”  Id. \nat 617. \nThe  Martin  panel  emphasized  that  its  “holding  is  a \nnarrow  one.”    Id.    Martin  recognized  that,  if  there  are \nsufficient available shelter beds for all homeless persons \nwithin a jurisdiction, then of course there can be no Eighth \nAmendment impediment to enforcing laws against sleeping \nand camping in public, because those persons engaging in \nsuch activities cannot be said to have “no option of sleeping \nindoors.”  Id.  But “so long as there is a greater number of \nhomeless individuals in a jurisdiction than the number of \navailable beds in shelters, the jurisdiction cannot prosecute \nhomeless individuals for involuntarily sitting, lying, and \nsleeping  in  public.”    Id.  (simplified)  (emphasis  added).  \nConsistent with Justice White’s concurrence, the Martin \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 63 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    63 \npanel emphasized that, in determining whether the defendant \nwas being punished for conduct that was “involuntary and \ninseparable from status,” id. (citation omitted), the specific \nindividual  circumstances  of  the  defendant  must  be \nconsidered.  Thus, Martin explained, the panel’s “holding \ndoes not cover individuals who do have access to adequate \ntemporary shelter, whether because they have the means to \npay for it or because it is realistically available to them for \nfree, but who choose not to use it.”  Id. at 617 n.8.  But \nMartin held that, where it is shown that homeless persons \n“do not have a single place where they can lawfully be,” an \nordinance against sleeping or camping in public, “as applied \nto them, effectively punish[es] them for something for which \nthey may not be convicted under the Eighth Amendment.”  \nId.  at  617  (simplified).    Concluding  that  the  remaining \nplaintiffs had “demonstrated a genuine issue of material \nfact” as to their lack of any access to indoor shelter, Martin \nreversed the district court’s grant of summary judgment to \nthe City.

CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nIn an August 2019 order, the district court certified a \nclass seeking declaratory and injunctive relief with respect \nto Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claims, pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).5  As defined in the court’s \norder, the class consists of “[a]ll involuntarily homeless \nindividuals  living  in  Grants  Pass,  Oregon,  including \nhomeless  individuals  who  sometimes  sleep  outside  city \nlimits to avoid harassment and punishment by Defendant as \naddressed in this lawsuit.”     \nAfter  the  parties  filed  cross-motions  for  summary \njudgment, the district court in July 2020 granted Plaintiffs’ \nmotion in relevant part and denied the City’s motion.  The \ndistrict court held that, under Martin, the City’s enforcement \nof the above-described ordinances violated the Cruel and \nUnusual Punishments Clause.    The court further held that, \nfor similar reasons, the ordinances imposed excessive fines \n \nindividual from a City park for a period of 30 days, if within a \none-year period the individual: \nA. Is issued two or more citations in the same City park \nfor  violating  regulations  related  to  City  park \nproperties, or \nB. Is issued one or more citations for violating any \nstate law(s) while on City park property.  \nThe foregoing exclusion order shall only apply to the particular \nCity park in which the offending conduct under 6.46.350(A) or \n6.46.350(B) occurred. \n5 At the time that the district court certified the class, the operative \ncomplaint was the Second Amended Complaint.  That complaint was \nmaterially  comparable  to  the  Third  Amended  Complaint,  with  the \nexception that it did not mention the park-exclusion ordinance or seek \ninjunctive relief with respect to it. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 67 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    67 \nin violation of the Eighth Amendment’s Excessive Fines \nClause.   \nAfter Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed those claims as to \nwhich summary judgment had been denied to both sides, the \ndistrict court entered final judgment declaring that the City’s \nenforcement  of  the  anti-camping  and  anti-sleeping \nordinances  (GPMC  §§ 5.61.020,  5.61.030,  6.46.090) \nviolates “the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel \nand  unusual  punishment”  and  its  “prohibition  against \nexcessive fines.”  Nonetheless, the court’s final injunctive \nrelief did not prohibit all enforcement of these provisions.  \nEnforcement of § 5.61.020 (the anti-sleeping ordinance) was \nnot enjoined at all.  The City was enjoined from enforcing \nthe  anti-camping  ordinances  (GPMC  §§ 5.61.030  and \n6.46.090) “without first giving a person a warning of at least \n24 hours before enforcement.”  It was further enjoined from \nenforcing those ordinances, and a related ordinance against \ncriminal trespass on city property, in all but one City park \nduring specified evening and overnight hours, which varied \ndepending upon the time of year.  Finally, the City was \nenjoined from enforcing the park-exclusion ordinance.6 \n \n6  The district  court’s  summary  judgment  order  and  judgment  also \ndeclared that a separate ordinance (GPMC § 6.46.355), which addressed \nthe procedures for appealing park-exclusion orders under § 6.46.350, \nfailed to provide sufficient procedural due process.  The parties dispute \nwhether this claim was adequately raised and reached below, but as the \nmajority notes, this claim for purely prospective relief has been mooted \nby the City’s subsequent amendment of § 6.46.355 in a way that removes \nthe features that had led to its invalidation.  See Opin. at 55.  Accordingly, \nthis aspect of the district court’s judgment should be vacated and \nremanded with instructions to dismiss as moot Plaintiffs’ challenge to \n§ 6.46.355. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 68 of 155\n68  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nThe City timely appealed from that judgment and from \nthe district court’s subsequent award of attorneys’ fees. \nII \nBefore turning to the merits, I first address the question \nof our jurisdiction under Article  III of the Constitution.  \nPlains Com. Bank v. Long Family Land & Cattle Co., 554 \nU.S.  316,  324  (2008)  (holding  that  courts  “bear  an \nindependent  obligation  to  assure  [them]selves  that \njurisdiction is proper before proceeding to the merits”). \n“In  limiting  the  judicial  power  to  ‘Cases’  and \n‘Controversies,’ Article III of the Constitution restricts it to \nthe traditional role of Anglo-American courts, which is to \nredress or prevent actual or imminently threatened injury to \npersons  caused  by  private  or  official  violation  of  law.”  \nSummers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 492 (2009).  \n“The doctrine of standing is one of several doctrines that \nreflect this fundamental limitation,” and in the context of a \nrequest for prospective injunctive or declaratory relief, that \ndoctrine requires a plaintiff to “show that he is under threat \nof  suffering  ‘injury  in  fact’  that  is  concrete  and \nparticularized; the threat must be actual and imminent, not \nconjectural or hypothetical; it must be fairly traceable to the \nchallenged action of the defendant; and it must be likely that \na favorable judicial decision will prevent or redress the \ninjury.”  Id. at 493.  The requirement to show an actual threat \nof imminent injury-in-fact in order to obtain prospective \nrelief  is  a  demanding  one:  the  Supreme  Court  has \n“repeatedly  reiterated  that  threatened  injury  must  be \ncertainly impending to constitute injury in fact, and that \nallegations  of  possible  future  injury  are  not  sufficient.”  \nClapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S 398, 409 (2013) \n(simplified).    \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 69 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    69 \nAs “an indispensable part of the plaintiff’s case,” each of \nthese elements of Article III standing “must be supported in \nthe same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears \nthe burden of proof, i.e., with the manner and degree of \nevidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.”  \nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  \nBecause,  as  in  Lujan,  this  case  arises  from  a  grant  of \nsummary  judgment,  the  question  is  whether,  in  seeking \nsummary judgment, Plaintiffs “‘set forth’ by affidavit or \nother evidence ‘specific facts’” in support of each element \nof standing.  Id. (citation omitted).  Moreover, “standing is \nnot  dispensed  in  gross,”  and  therefore  “a  plaintiff  must \ndemonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press.”  \nDaimlerChrysler  Corp.  v.  Cuno,  547  U.S.  332,  352–53 \n(2006) (emphasis added) (citation omitted). \nPlaintiffs’ operative complaint named three individual \nplaintiffs  as  class  representatives  (John  Logan,  Gloria \nJohnson, and Debra Blake), and we have jurisdiction to \naddress the merits of a particular claim if any one of them \nsufficiently established Article III standing as to that claim.  \nSee Secretary of the Interior v. California, 464 U.S. 312, 319 \nn.3 (1984) (“Since the State of California clearly does have \nstanding, we need not address the standing of the other \n[plaintiffs], whose position here is identical to the State’s.”); \nsee also Bates v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 511 F.3d 974, \n985 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (“In a class action, standing is \nsatisfied  if  at  least  one  named  plaintiff  meets  the \nrequirements.”).  Accordingly, I address the showing made \nby each named Plaintiff in support of summary judgment. \nIn my view, Plaintiff John Logan failed to establish that \nhe  has  standing  to  challenge  any  of  the  ordinances  in \nquestion.  In support of his motion for summary judgment, \nLogan  submitted  a  half-page  declaration  stating,  in \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 70 of 155\n70  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nconclusory fashion, that he is “involuntarily homeless in \nGrants Pass,” but that he is “sleeping in [his] truck at night \nat a rest stop North of Grants Pass.”  He asserted that he \n“cannot sleep in the City of Grants Pass for fear that [he] will \nbe awakened, ticketed, fined, moved along, trespassed[,] and \ncharged with Criminal Trespass.”  Logan also previously \nsubmitted  two  declarations  in  support  of  his  class \ncertification motion.  In them, Logan stated that he has been \nhomeless in Grants Pass for nearly seven of the last 10 years; \nthat there have been occasions in the past in which police in \nGrants Pass have awakened him in his car and instructed him \nto move on; and that he now generally sleeps in his truck \noutside of Grants Pass.  Logan has made no showing that, \nover the seven years that he has been homeless, he has ever \nbeen  issued  a  citation  for  violating  the  challenged \nordinances, nor has he provided any facts to establish either \nthat the threat of such a citation is “certainly impending” or \nthat “there is a substantial risk” that he may be issued a \ncitation.  Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, \n158 (2014) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  \nAt best, his declarations suggest that he would prefer to sleep \nin his truck within the City limits rather than outside them, \nand that he is subjectively deterred from doing so due to the \nCity’s ordinances.  But such “[a]llegations of a subjective \n‘chill’ are not an adequate substitute for a claim of specific \npresent objective harm or a threat of specific future harm.”  \nLaird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 13–14 (1972).  Nor has Logan \nprovided any facts that would show that he has any actual \nintention or plans to stay overnight in the City.  See Lopez v. \nCandaele, 630 F.3d 775, 787 (9th Cir. 2010) (“[W]e have \nconcluded  that  pre-enforcement  plaintiffs  who  failed  to \nallege a concrete intent to violate the challenged law could \nnot establish a credible threat of enforcement.”).  Even if his \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 71 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    71 \ndeclarations could be generously construed as asserting an \nintention to stay in the City at some future point, “[s]uch \n‘some day’ intentions—without any description of concrete \nplans, or indeed even any specification of when the some day \nwill be—do not support a finding of the ‘actual or imminent’ \ninjury that [the Court’s] cases require.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n564;  cf.  Driehaus,  573  U.S.  at  161  (permitting  pre-\nenforcement  challenge  against  ordinance  regulating \nelection-related  speech  where  plaintiffs’  allegations \nidentified “specific statements they intend[ed] to make in \nfuture election cycles”).  And, contrary to what the majority \nsuggests,  see  Opin.  at  30–31  n.16,  Logan’s  vaguely \ndescribed  knowledge  about  what  has  happened  to  other \npeople cannot establish his standing.  Accordingly, Logan \nfailed  to  carry  his  burden  to  establish  standing  for  the \nprospective relief he seeks. \nBy contrast, Plaintiff Gloria Johnson made a sufficient \nshowing that she has standing to challenge the general anti-\ncamping ordinance, GPMC § 5.61.030, and the parks anti-\ncamping ordinance, GPMC § 6.46.090.  Although Johnson’s \nearlier declaration in support of class certification stated that \nshe “often” sleeps in her van outside the City limits, she also \nstated that she “continue[s] to live without shelter in Grants \nPass” and that, consequently, “[a]t any time, I could be \narrested, ticketed, fined, and prosecuted for sleeping outside \nin my van or for covering myself with a blanket to stay \nwarm” (emphasis added).  Her declaration also recounts \n“dozens of occasions” in which the anti-camping ordinances \nhave been enforced against her, either by instructions to \n“move along” or, in one instance, by issuance of a citation \nfor  violating  the  parks  anti-camping  ordinance,  GPMC \n§ 6.46.090.  Because Johnson presented facts showing that \nshe continues to violate the anti-camping ordinances and \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 72 of 155\n72  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nthat, in light of past enforcement, she faces a credible threat \nof future enforcement, she has standing to challenge those \nordinances.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564.  Johnson, however, \npresented no facts that would establish standing to challenge \neither the anti-sleeping ordinance (which, unlike the anti-\ncamping ordinances, does not apply to sleeping in a vehicle), \nthe  park-exclusion  ordinance,  or  the  criminal  trespass \nordinance.7 \nDebra Blake sufficiently established her standing, both \nin connection with the class certification motion and the \nsummary  judgment  motion.    Although  she  was  actually \n \n7 The majority concludes that Johnson’s standing to challenge the anti-\ncamping ordinances necessarily establishes her standing to challenge the \npark-exclusion and criminal-trespass ordinances.  See Opin. at 30 n.15.  \nBut as the district court explained, the undisputed evidence concerning \nGrants Pass’s enforcement policies established that “Grants Pass first \nissues fines for violations and then either issues a trespass order or \nexcludes  persons  from  all  parks  before  a  person  is  charged  with \nmisdemeanor criminal trespass” (emphasis added).  Although Johnson’s \ncontinued intention to sleep in her vehicle in Grants Pass gives her \nstanding to challenge the anti-camping ordinances, Johnson has wholly \nfailed to plead any facts to show, inter alia, that she intends to engage in \nthe further conduct that might expose her to a “credible threat” of \nprosecution under the park-exclusion or criminal trespass ordinances.  \nDriehaus, 573 U.S. at 159 (citation omitted).  Johnson’s declaration \nstates that she has been homeless in Grants Pass for three years, but it \ndoes not contend that she has ever been issued, or threatened with \nissuance of, a trespass order, a park-exclusion order, or a criminal \ntrespass charge or that she has “an intention to engage in a course of \nconduct” that would lead to such an order or charge.  Id. (citation \nomitted).    Because  “standing  is  not  dispensed  in  gross,”  see \nDaimlerChrysler, 547 U.S. at 353 (citation omitted), Johnson must \nseparately establish her standing with respect to each ordinance, and she \nhas failed to do so with respect to the park-exclusion and criminal-\ntrespass ordinances. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 73 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    73 \nliving in temporary housing at the time she submitted her \ndeclarations in support of class certification in March and \nJune 2019, she explained that that temporary housing would \nsoon expire; that she would become homeless in Grants Pass \nagain; and that she would therefore again be subject to being \n“arrested, ticketed and prosecuted for sleeping outside or for \ncovering myself with a blanket to stay warm.”  And, as her \ndeclaration at summary judgment showed, that is exactly \nwhat  happened:  in  September  2019,  she  was  cited  for \nsleeping  in  the  park  in  violation  of  GPMC  § 6.46.090, \nconvicted, and fined.  Her declarations also confirmed that \nBlake’s persistence in sleeping and camping in a variety of \nplaces in Grants Pass had also resulted in a park-exclusion \norder (which she successfully appealed), and in citations for \nviolation of the anti-sleeping ordinance, GPMC § 5.61.020 \n(for sleeping in an alley), and for criminal trespass on City \nproperty.  Based on this showing, I conclude that Blake \nestablished standing to challenge each of the ordinances at \nissue in the district court’s judgment.   \nHowever, Blake subsequently passed away during this \nlitigation,  as  her  counsel  noted  in  a  letter  to  this  court \nsubmitted under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 43(a).  \nBecause  the  only  relief  she  sought  was  prospective \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, Blake’s death moots her \nclaims.  King v. County of Los Angeles, 885 F.3d 548, 553, \n559 (9th Cir. 2018).  And because, as explained earlier, \nBlake was the only named Plaintiff who established standing \nwith  respect  to  the  anti-sleeping,  park-exclusion,  and \ncriminal  trespass  ordinances  that  are  the  subject  of  the \ndistrict  court’s  classwide  judgment,  her  death  raises  the \nquestion whether we consequently lack jurisdiction over \nthose additional claims.

As noted \nearlier, we have jurisdiction to address all claims concerning \nthe two anti-camping ordinances, as to which Johnson has \nsufficient standing to represent the certified class.

CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nA \n“To obtain certification of a plaintiff class under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23, a plaintiff must satisfy both the \nfour  requirements  of  Rule  23(a)—‘numerosity, \ncommonality, typicality, and adequate representation’—and \n‘one of the three requirements listed in Rule 23(b).’”  A.B. v. \nHawaii State Dep’t of Educ., 30 F.4th 828, 834 (9th Cir. \n2022) (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. \n338, 345, 349 (2011)).  Commonality, which is contested \nhere, requires a showing that the class members’ claims \n“depend upon a common contention” that is “of such a \nnature  that  it  is  capable  of  classwide  resolution—which \nmeans that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve \nan issue that is central to the validity of each one of the \nclaims in one stroke.”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350.  In finding \nthat commonality was satisfied with respect to the Eighth \nAmendment claims, the district court relied solely on the \npremise that whether the City’s conduct “violates the Eighth \nAmendment” was a common question that could be resolved \non a classwide basis.  And in finding that Rule 23(b) was \nsatisfied  here,  the  district  court  relied  solely  on  Rule \n23(b)(2),  which  provides  that  a  “class  action  may  be \nmaintained” if “the party opposing the class has acted or \nrefused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so \nthat final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief \nis appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  FED. R. CIV. \nP. 23(b)(2).  That requirement was satisfied, the district court \nconcluded,  because  (for  reasons  similar  to  those  that \nunderlay its commonality analysis) the City’s challenged \nenforcement of the ordinances “applies equally to all class \nmembers.”    The  district  court’s  commonality  and  Rule \n23(b)(2) analyses are both flawed because they are based on \nan incorrect understanding of our decision in Martin. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 77 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    77 \nAs the earlier discussion of Martin makes clear, the \nEighth Amendment theory adopted in that case requires an \nindividualized  inquiry  in  order  to  assess  whether  any \nindividuals to whom the challenged ordinances are being \napplied  “do  have  access  to  adequate  temporary  shelter, \nwhether because they have the means to pay for it or because \nit is realistically available to them for free, but who choose \nnot to use it.”  920 F.3d at 617 n.8.  See supra at 61–63.  Only \nwhen persons “do not have a single place where they can \nlawfully be,” can it be said that an ordinance against sleeping \nor  camping  in  public,  “as  applied  to  them,  effectively \npunish[es] them for something for which they may not be \nconvicted  under  the  Eighth  Amendment.”    Id.  at  617 \n(simplified) (emphasis added).   \nOf  course,  such  an  individualized  inquiry  is  not \nrequired—and no Eighth Amendment violation occurs under \nMartin—when the defendant can show that there is adequate \nshelter  space  to  house  all  homeless  persons  in  the \njurisdiction.  Id.  But the converse is not true—the mere fact \nthat a city’s shelters are full does not by itself establish, \nwithout more, that any particular person who is sleeping in \npublic does “not have a single place where [he or she] can \nlawfully be.”  Id.  The logic of Martin, and of the opinions \nin Powell on which it is based, requires an assessment of a \nperson’s individual situation before it can be said that the \nEighth  Amendment  would  be  violated  by  applying  a \nparticular provision against that person.  Indeed, the opinions \nin  Powell  on  which  Martin  relied—Justice  White’s \nconcurring  opinion  and  the  opinion  of  the  dissenting \nJustices—all agreed that, at most, the Eighth Amendment \nprovided  a  case-specific  affirmative  defense  that  would \nrequire the defendant to provide a “satisfactor[y] showing \nthat it was not feasible for him to have made arrangements” \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 78 of 155\n78  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nto avoid the conduct at issue.  Powell, 392 U.S. at 552 \n(White, J., concurring); id. at 568 n.31 (Fortas, J., dissenting) \n(agreeing with Justice White that the issue is whether the \ndefendant “on the occasion in question” had shown that \navoiding the conduct was “impossible”); see also supra at \n59–60.9 \nIn light of this understanding of Martin, the district court \nclearly erred in finding that the requirement of commonality \nwas met here.  “What matters to class certification is not the \nraising of common ‘questions’—even in droves—but rather, \nthe capacity of a class-wide proceeding to generate common \nanswers  apt  to  drive  the  resolution  of  the  litigation.  \nDissimilarities within the proposed class are what have the \npotential to impede the generation of common answers.”  \n \n9 The majority incorrectly contends that the dissenters in Powell did not \nendorse Justice White’s conclusion that the defendant bears the burden \nto establish that his or her conduct was involuntary.  See Opin. at 48–51.  \nOn the contrary, the Powell dissenters’ entire argument rested on the \naffirmative “constitutional defense” presented at the trial in that case and \non the findings made by the trial court in connection with that defense.  \nSee 392 U.S. at 558 (Fortas, J., dissenting).  The majority’s suggestion \nthat I have taken that explicit reference to Powell’s defense “out of \ncontext,” see Opin. at 49 n.29, is demonstrably wrong—the context of \nthe case was precisely the extensive affirmative defense that Powell \npresented at trial, including the testimony of an expert.  See 392 U.S. at \n517–26 (plurality) (summarizing the testimony).  And, of course, in \nMartin, the issue was raised in the context of a § 1983 action in which \nthe  plaintiffs  challenging  the  laws  bore  the  burden  to  prove  the \ninvoluntariness of their relevant conduct.  The majority points to nothing \nthat would plausibly support the view that Powell and Martin might \nrequire the government to carry the burden to establish voluntariness.  \nSee Opin. at 50 n.31 (leaving this issue open).  The majority claims that \nit can sidestep this issue here, but that is also wrong: the burden issue is \ncritical  both  to  the  class-certification  analysis  and  to  the  issue  of \nsummary judgment on the merits.  See infra at 78–89. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 79 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    79 \nWal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350 (simplified).  Under Martin, the \nanswer to the question whether the City’s enforcement of \neach of the anti-camping ordinances violates the Eighth \nAmendment turns on the individual circumstances of each \nperson to whom the ordinance is being applied on a given \noccasion.    That  question  is  simply  not  one  that  can  be \nresolved, on a common basis, “in one stroke.”  Id.  That \nrequires decertification. \nFor  similar  reasons,  the  district  court  also  erred  in \nconcluding that the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) were met.  \nBy  its  terms,  Rule  23(b)(2)  is  satisfied  only  if  (1) the \ndefendant has acted (or refused to act) on grounds that are \ngenerally applicable to the class as whole and (2) as a result, \nfinal classwide or injunctive relief is appropriate.  As the \nSupreme Court has observed, “[t]he key to the (b)(2) class is \n‘the  indivisible  nature  of  the  injunctive  or  declaratory \nremedy warranted—the notion that the conduct is such that \nit can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the \nclass members or as to none of them.’”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. \nat  360.    It  follows  that,  when  the  wrongfulness  of  the \nchallenged  conduct  with  respect  to  any  particular  class \nmember  depends  critically  upon  the  individual \ncircumstances of that class member, a class action under \nRule 23(b)(2) is not appropriate.  In such a case, in which \n(for example) the challenged enforcement of a particular law \nmay be lawful as to some persons and not as to others, \ndepending upon their individual circumstances, the all-or-\nnothing determination of wrongfulness that is the foundation \nof a (b)(2) class is absent: in such a case, it is simply not true \nthat the defendant’s “conduct is such that it can be enjoined \nor declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or \nas to none of them.’”  Id. (emphasis added).   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 80 of 155\n80  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nBecause Martin requires an assessment of each person’s \nindividual  circumstances  in  order  to  determine  whether \napplication of the challenged ordinances violates the Eighth \nAmendment, these standards for the application of Rule \n23(b)(2) were plainly not met in this case.  That is, because \nthe applicable law governing Plaintiffs’ claims would entail \n“a  process  through  which  highly  individualized \ndeterminations  of  liability  and  remedy  are  made,” \ncertification of a class under Rule 23(b)(2) is improper.  \nJamie S. v. Milwaukee Pub. Sch., 668 F.3d 481, 499 (7th Cir. \n2012).  Moreover, the mere fact that the district court’s final \njudgment  imposes  sweeping  across-the-board  injunctive \nrelief that disregards individual differences in determining \nthe defendant’s liability does not mean that Rule 23(b)(2) \nhas been satisfied.  The rule requires that any such classwide \nrelief be rooted in a determination of classwide liability—\nthe defendant must have acted, or be acting, unlawfully “on \ngrounds  that  apply  generally  to  the  class,  so  that  final \ninjunctive or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate \nrespecting the class as a whole.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(2) \n(emphasis added).  That requirement was not established \nhere, and the class must be decertified. 10 \n \n10 The majority wrongly concludes that the City has forfeited any \nargument  concerning  Rule  23(b)(2)  because  it  did  not  specifically \nmention that subdivision of the rule in its opening brief.  Opin. at 41.  \nThis “Simon Says” approach to reading briefs is wrong.  The substance \nof the argument is contained in the opening brief, in which the City \nexplicitly  contended  that  Martin  requires  “a  more  individualized \nanalysis” than the district court applied and that, as a result, “neither FED. \nR. CIV. P. 23 nor Martin provide plaintiffs the ability to establish the type \nof sweeping class-wide claims advanced in this case.”  Indeed, Plaintiffs \nthemselves responded to this argument, in their answering brief, by \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 81 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    81 \nB \nThe majority provides two responses to this analysis, but \nboth of them are wrong.   \nFirst, the majority contends that Martin established a \nbright-line  rule  that  the  government  cannot  prosecute \n“involuntarily homeless persons for sleeping in public”—or, \npresumably, for camping—“if there are no other public areas \nor appropriate shelters where those individuals can sleep.”  \nSee Opin. at 19.  As the majority makes clear, that latter \ninquiry into available shelter space turns on whether “the \nnumber of homeless persons outnumber the available shelter \nbeds,” except that, “[w]hen assessing the number of shelter \nspaces,” shelters that have a “mandatory religious focus” are \nnot to be counted.  See Opin. at 13, 19 (citation omitted).  \nMoreover, although the majority’s phrasing pays lip service \nto the fact that the persons at issue must be “involuntarily \nhomeless,” the majority also explicitly rejects the City’s \ncontention that “the holding of Martin can only be applied \nafter an individualized inquiry of each alleged involuntarily \nhomeless person’s access to shelter.”  See Opin. at 35.  The \nnet result, for class certification purposes, is that any issue of \nindividualized involuntariness is set aside and Martin is \nthereby reduced to a simplistic formula—to be resolved on a \nclasswide  basis—into  whether  the  number  of  homeless \npersons in the jurisdiction exceeds the number of available \nshelter beds.  See Opin. at 34–35, 38.   \nThe majority’s analysis fails, because Martin does not \nallow the individualized inquiry into involuntariness to be \nset  aside  in  this  way.    Martin  states  that,  if  there  are \n \nexplaining why they believe that the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) were \nmet. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 82 of 155\n82  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \ninsufficient available beds at shelters, then a jurisdiction \n“cannot prosecute homeless individuals for ‘involuntarily \nsitting, lying, and sleeping in public.’”  920 F.3d at 617 \n(emphasis added).  The lack of adequate shelter beds thus \nmerely eliminates a safe-harbor that might otherwise have \nallowed  a  jurisdiction  to  prosecute  violations  of  such \nordinances without regard to individual circumstances, with \nthe result that the  jurisdiction’s enforcement power will \ninstead depend upon whether the conduct of the individual \non a particular occasion was “involuntar[y].”  Id.  Martin \nconfirms that the resulting inquiry turns on whether the \npersons in question have access to “a single place where they \ncan  lawfully  be,”  id.  at  617  (emphasis  added)  (citation \nomitted),  and  not  just  on  whether  they  have  access  to \n“appropriate  shelters” or “other public areas.”   And the \nmajority’s misreading of Martin completely disregards the \nPowell  opinions  on  which  Martin  relied,  which  make \nunmistakably  clear  that  an  individualized  showing  of \ninvoluntariness is required.   \nSecond, and relatedly, the majority states that, to the \nextent that Martin requires such an individualized showing \nto  establish  an  Eighth  Amendment  violation,  any  such \nindividualized issue here has been eliminated by the fact that \n“[p]ursuant to the class definition, the class includes only \ninvoluntarily homeless persons.”  See Opin. at 38–40 (first \nemphasis added).  As the majority acknowledges, “[p]ersons \nare involuntarily homeless” under Martin only “if they do \nnot ‘have access to adequate temporary shelter,’” such as, \nfor example, when they lack “‘the means to pay for it’” and \nit is otherwise not “‘realistically available to them for free.’”  \nOpin. at 14 n.2 (quoting Martin, 920 F.3d at  617 n.8).  \nBecause that individualized issue has been shifted into the \nclass definition, the majority holds, the City’s enforcement \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 83 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    83 \nof the challenged ordinances against that class can in that \nsense be understood to present a “common question” that \ncan be resolved in one stroke.  According to the majority, \nbecause the class definition requires that, at the time the \nordinances are applied against them, the class members must \nbe  “involuntarily  homeless”  in  the  sense  that  Martin \nrequires, there is a common question as to whether “the \nCity’s enforcement of the anti-camping ordinances against \nall involuntarily homeless individuals violates the Eighth \nAmendment.”  See Opin. at 38–39 & n.22. \nThe  majority  cites  no  authority  for  this  audacious \nbootstrap argument.  If a person’s individual circumstances \nare such that he or she has no “access to adequate temporary \nshelter”—which necessarily subsumes (among other things) \nthe determination that there are no shelter beds available—\nthen the entire (highly individualized) question of the City’s \nliability to that person under Martin’s standards has been \nshifted into the class definition.  That is wholly improper.  \nSee Olean Wholesale Grocery Coop. v. Bumble Bee Foods, \n31 F.4th 651, 670 n.14 (9th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (“A court \nmay not . . . create a ‘fail safe’ class that is defined to include \nonly those individuals who were injured by the allegedly \nunlawful  conduct.”);  see  also  Ruiz  Torres  v.  Mercer \nCanyons Inc., 835 F.3d 1125, 1138 n.7 (9th Cir. 2016) \n(stating that it would be improper to define a class in such a \nway “as to preclude membership unless the liability of the \ndefendant is established” (simplified)).   \nThe majority nonetheless insists that “[m]embership in \n[the] class” here “has no connection to the success of the \nunderlying claims.”  See Opin. at 39 n.23.  That is obviously \nfalse.  As I have explained, Martin’s understanding of when \na person “involuntarily” lacks “access to adequate temporary \nshelter” or to “a single place where [he or she] can lawfully \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 84 of 155\n84  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nbe,” see 920 F.3d at 617 & n.8 (citations omitted), requires \nan  individualized  inquiry  into  a  given  person’s \ncircumstances at a particular moment.  By insisting that a \ncommon  question  exists  here  because  Martin’s \ninvoluntariness  standard  has  been  folded  into  the  class \ndefinition, the majority is unavoidably relying on a fail-safe \nclass  definition  that  improperly  subsumes  this  crucial \nindividualized merits issue into the class definition.  The \nmajority’s artifice renders the limitations of Rule 23 largely \nillusory.11  \nTo the extent that the majority instead suggests that the \nclass definition requires only an involuntary lack of access \nto regular or permanent shelter to qualify as “involuntarily \nhomeless,” its argument collapses for a different reason.  \nBecause Martin’s Eighth Amendment holding applies only \nto  those  who  involuntarily  lack  “access  to  adequate \ntemporary shelter” on a given occasion, see 920 F.3d at 617 \nn.8, such an understanding of the class definition would not \n \n11  The  majority  contends  that,  despite  the  presence  of  a  liability-\ndetermining individualized issue in the class definition, there is no fail-\nsafe class here because one or more of the claims might still conceivably \nfail on the merits for other reasons.  See Opin. at 39 n.23.  But the \nmajority does not identify any such other reasons and, of course, under \nthe majority’s view of the substantive law, there are none.  But more \nimportantly, the majority is simply wrong in positing that the only type \nof class that would qualify as an impermissible fail-safe class is one in \nwhich every conceivable merits issue in the litigation has been folded \ninto the class definition.  What matters is whether the class definition \nfolds within it any bootstrapping merits issue (such as the “injur[y]” issue \nmentioned in Olean) as to which “a class member either wins or, by \nvirtue of losing, is defined out of the class and is therefore not bound by \nthe judgment.”  Olean, 31 F.4th at 670 n.14 (citation omitted).  To the \nextent that the central individualized merits issue in this case has been \nfolded into the class definition, that defect is present here. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 85 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    85 \nbe sufficient to eliminate the highly individualized inquiry \ninto whether a particular person lacked such access at a given \nmoment, and the class would then have to be decertified for \nthe reasons I have discussed earlier.  See supra at 75–80.  Put \nsimply, the majority cannot have it both ways: either the \nclass  definition  is  co-extensive  with  Martin’s \ninvoluntariness  concept  (in  which  case  the  class  is  an \nimproper fail-safe class) or the class definition differs from \nthe Martin standard (in which case Martin’s individualized \ninquiry requires decertification). \nIV \nGiven  these  conclusions  as  to  standing  and  class \ncertification, all that remains are the individual claims of \nJohnson for prospective relief against enforcement of the \ntwo anti-camping ordinances.  In my view, these claims fail \nas a matter of law. \nJohnson’s sole basis for challenging these ordinances is \nthat they prohibit her from sleeping in her van within the \nCity.  In her declaration in support of class certification, \nhowever, Johnson specifically stated that she has “often” \nbeen able to sleep in her van by parking outside the City \nlimits.  In a supplemental declaration in support of summary \njudgment, she affirmed that these facts “remain true,” but \nshe added that there had also been occasions in which, \noutside the City limits, county officers had told her to “move \non” when she “was parked on county roads” and that, when \nshe  parked  “on  BLM  land”—i.e.,  land  managed  by  the \nfederal Bureau of Land Management—she was told that she \n“could only stay on BLM for a few days.” \nAs an initial matter, Johnson’s declaration provides no \nnon-conclusory basis for finding that she lacks any option \nother than sleeping in her van.  Although her declaration \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 86 of 155\n86  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nnotes that she worked as a nurse “for decades” and that she \nnow collects social security benefits, the declaration simply \nstates, without saying anything further about her present \neconomic situation, that she “cannot afford housing.”  Her \ndeclaration also says nothing about where she lived before \nshe began living “on the street” a few years ago, and it says \nnothing about whether she has any friends or family, in \nGrants Pass or elsewhere, who might be able to provide \nassistance.12  And even assuming that this factual showing \nwould be sufficient to permit a trier of fact to find that \nJohnson lacks any realistic option other than sleeping in her \nvan, we cannot affirm the district court’s summary judgment \nin Johnson’s favor without holding that her showing was so \noverwhelming that she should prevail as a matter of law.  \nBecause a reasonable trier of fact could find, in light of these \nevidentiary gaps, that Johnson failed to carry her burden of \nproof on this preliminary point, summary judgment in her \nfavor was improper.13 \n \n12 The majority dismisses these questions about the sufficiency of \nJohnson’s evidentiary showing as “artificial limitations” on claims under \nMartin, see Opin. at 51, but the standard for establishing an Eighth \nAmendment violation under Martin and the Powell opinions on which it \nrelies is a demanding and individualized one, and we are obligated to \nfollow  it.    Indeed,  in  upholding  Powell’s  conviction  for  public \ndrunkenness, the controlling opinion of Justice White probed the details \nof the record as to whether, in light of the fact that Powell “had a home \nand wife,” he could have “made plans while sober to prevent ending up \nin a public place,” and whether, despite his chronic alcoholism, he \n“retained the power to stay off or leave the streets, and simply preferred \nto be there rather than elsewhere.”  392 U.S. at 553. \n13 The majority errs by instead counting all gaps in the evidentiary record \nagainst the City, faulting it for what the majority thinks the City has \nfailed to “demonstrate[],”  See Opin. at 52 & n.32.  That is contrary to \nwell-settled law.  See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986) \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 87 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    87 \nBut even assuming that Johnson had established that she \ntruly  has  no  option  other  than  sleeping  in  her  van,  her \nshowing  is  still  insufficient  to  establish  an  Eighth \nAmendment violation.  As noted, Johnson’s sole complaint \nin this case is that, by enforcing the anti-camping ordinances, \nthe City will not let her sleep in her van.  But the sparse facts \nshe  has  presented  fail  to  establish  that  she  lacks  any \nalternative place where she could park her van and sleep in \nit.  On the contrary, her factual showing establishes that the \nBLM will let her do so on BLM land for a “few days” at a \ntime and that she also has “often” been able to do so on \ncounty  land.    Given  that  Johnson  has  failed  to  present \nsufficient evidence to show that she lacks alternatives that \nwould allow her to avoid violating the City’s anti-camping \nordinances, she has not established that the conduct for \nwhich the City would punish her is involuntary such that, \nunder Martin and the Powell opinions on which Martin \nrelies, it would violate the Eighth Amendment to enforce that \nprohibition against her.   \nIn nonetheless finding that the anti-camping ordinances’ \nprohibition  on  sleeping  in  vehicles  violates  the  Eighth \nAmendment, the majority apparently relies on the premise \nthat the question of whether an individual has options for \navoiding violations of the challenged law must be limited to \nalternatives that are within the City limits.  Under this view, \nif a large homeless shelter with 1,000 vacant beds were \n \n(holding that a movant’s summary judgment motion should be granted \n“against a [nonmovant] who fails to make a showing sufficient to \nestablish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and \non which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial”).  The \nmajority’s analysis also belies its implausible claim that it has not shifted \nthe burden to the City to establish the voluntariness of the behavior \ntargeted by the ordinances.  See supra at 78 n.9. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 88 of 155\n88  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nopened a block outside the City’s limits, the City would still \nbe required by the Eighth Amendment to allow hundreds of \npeople to sleep in their vans in the City and, presumably, in \nthe City’s public parks as well.  Nothing in law or logic \nsupports such a conclusion.  Martin says that anti-sleeping \nordinances  may  be  enforced,  consistent  with  the  Eighth \nAmendment, so long as there is a “single place where [the \nperson] can lawfully be,” 920 F.2d at 617 (emphasis added) \n(citation  omitted),  and  Justice  White’s  concurrence  in \nPowell confirms that the Eighth Amendment does not bar \nenforcement of a law when the defendant has failed to show \nthat avoiding the violative conduct is “impossible,” 392 U.S. \nat 551 (emphasis added).14  Nothing in the rationale of this \nEighth Amendment theory suggests that the inquiry into \nwhether  it  is  “impossible”  for  the  defendant  to  avoid \nviolating the law must be artificially constrained to only \nthose particular options that suit the defendant’s geographic \nor other preferences.  To be sure, Johnson states that having \nto drive outside the City limits costs her money for gas, but \nthat does not provide any basis for concluding that the option \nis infeasible or that she has thereby suffered “cruel and \nunusual punishment.”   \nFinally,  because  the  district  court’s  reliance  on  the \nExcessive Fines Clause was predicated on the comparable \nview that the challenged ordinances punish “status and not \nconduct” in violation of Robinson, that ruling was flawed for \nthe same reasons.  And because Johnson provides no other \n \n14 The majority complains that this standard is too high, see Opin. at 52, \nbut it is the standard applied in Martin and in the Powell opinions on \nwhich Martin relied.   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 89 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    89 \nbasis for  finding an Excessive  Fines  violation  here, her \nclaims under that clause also fail as a matter of law. \nV \nAccordingly, I would remand this case with instructions \n(1) to dismiss as moot the claims of Debra Blake as well as \nPlaintiffs’ claims with respect to GPMC § 6.46.355; (2) to \ndismiss the claims of John Logan for lack of Article III \nstanding;  (3) to  dismiss  the  remaining  claims  of  Gloria \nJohnson for lack of Article III standing, except to the extent \nthat she challenges the two anti-camping ordinances (GPMC \n§§ 5.61.030, 6.46.090); (4) to decertify the class; and (5) to \ngrant summary judgment to the City, and against Johnson, \nwith respect to her challenges to the City’s anti-camping \nordinances  under  the  Eighth  Amendment’s  Cruel  and \nUnusual Punishments Clause and Excessive Fines Clause.  \nThat disposes of all claims at issue, and I therefore need not \nreach  any  of  the  many  additional  issues  discussed  and \ndecided by the majority’s opinion or raised by the parties.15   \n \n15 Two of the majority’s expansions of Martin nonetheless warrant \nspecial mention.  First, the majority’s decision goes well beyond Martin \nby holding that the Eighth Amendment precludes enforcement of anti-\ncamping ordinances against those who involuntarily lack access to \ntemporary shelter, if those ordinances deny such persons the use of \nwhatever materials they need “to keep themselves warm and dry.”  See \nOpin. at 46.  It seems unavoidable that this newly declared right to the \nnecessary “materials to keep warm and dry” while sleeping in public \nparks must include the right to use (at least) a tent; it is hard to see how \nelse one would keep “warm and dry” in a downpour.  And the majority \nalso raises, and leaves open, the possibility that the City’s prohibition on \nthe use of other “items necessary to facilitate sleeping outdoors”—such \nas “stoves,” “fires,” and makeshift “structures”—“may or may not be \npermissible.”    See  Opin.  at  45–46,  53–54.    Second,  the  majority \nindirectly extends Martin’s holding from the strictly criminal context at \nissue in that case to civil citations and fines.  See Opin. at 41–45.  As the \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 90 of 155\n90  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nVI \nUp to this point, I have faithfully adhered to Martin and \nits understanding of Powell, as I am obligated to do.  See \nMiller v. Gammie, 335 F.3d 889, 899–900 (9th Cir. 2003) \n(en banc).  But given the importance of the issues at stake, \nand the gravity of Martin’s errors, I think it appropriate to \nconclude by noting my general agreement with many of the \npoints  made  by  my  colleagues  who  dissented  from  our \nfailure to rehear Martin en banc.   \nIn  particular,  I  agree  that,  by  combining  dicta  in  a \nconcurring  opinion  with  a  dissent,  the  panel  in  Martin \nplainly misapplied Marks’ rule that “[w]hen a fragmented \nCourt decides a case and no single rationale explaining the \nresult enjoys the assent of five Justices, ‘the holding of the \nCourt  may  be  viewed  as  that  position  taken  by  those \nMembers who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest \ngrounds.’”    430  U.S.  at  193  (emphasis  added)  (citation \nomitted).  Under a correct application of Marks, the holding \nof  Powell  is  that  there  is  no  constitutional  obstacle  to \npunishing conduct that has not been shown to be involuntary, \nand the converse question of what rule applies when the \n \ndistrict court noted below, the parties vigorously debated the extent to \nwhich a “violation” qualifies as a crime under Oregon law.  The majority, \nhowever, sidesteps that issue by instead treating it as irrelevant.  The \nmajority’s theory is that, even assuming arguendo that violations of the \nanti-camping ordinances are only civil in nature, they are covered by \nMartin because such violations later could lead (after more conduct by \nthe defendant) to criminal fines, see Opin. at 44–45.  But the majority \ndoes not follow the logic of its own theory, because it has not limited its \nholding  or  remedy  to  the  enforcement  of  the  ultimate  criminal \nprovisions; on the contrary, the majority has enjoined any relevant \nenforcement  of  the  underlying  ordinances  that  contravenes  the \nmajority’s understanding of Martin.  See Opin. at 55.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 91 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    91 \nconduct has been shown to be involuntary was left open.  See \nMartin, 920 F.3d at 590–93 (M. Smith, J., dissenting from \ndenial of rehearing en banc) (explaining that, under a proper \napplication of Marks, “‘there is definitely no Supreme Court \nholding’  prohibiting  the  criminalization  of  involuntary \nconduct” (citation omitted)).   \nMoreover, the correct answer to the question left open in \nPowell was the one provided in Justice Marshall’s plurality \nopinion  in  that  case:  there  is  no  federal  “constitutional \ndoctrine of criminal responsibility.”  392 U.S. at 534.  In \nlight of the “centuries-long evolution of the collection of \ninterlocking and overlapping concepts which the common \nlaw has utilized to assess the moral accountability of an \nindividual for his antisocial deeds,” including the “doctrines \nof actus reus, mens rea, insanity, mistake, justification, and \nduress,” the “process of adjustment” of “the tension between \nthe evolving aims of the criminal law and changing religious, \nmoral, philosophical, and medical views of the nature of \nman” is a matter that the Constitution leaves within “the \nprovince of the States” or of Congress.  Id. at 535–36.  \n“There is simply no indication in the history of the Eighth \nAmendment that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause \nwas intended to reach the substantive authority of Congress \nto  criminalize  acts  or  status,  and  certainly  not  before \nconviction,”  and  the  later  incorporation  of  that  clause’s \nprotections  vis-à-vis  the  States  in  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment “worked no change in its meaning.”  Martin, \n920  F.3d  at  602  (Bennett,  J.,  dissenting  from  denial  of \nrehearing en banc);  see also id. at 599 (explaining that \nMartin’s  novel  holding  was  inconsistent  with  the  “text, \ntradition, and original public meaning[] [of] the Cruel and \nUnusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment”).  \nConsequently, so long as “the accused has committed some \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 92 of 155\n92  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nact, has engaged in some behavior, which society has an \ninterest in preventing, or perhaps in historical common law \nterms,  has  committed  some  actus  reus,”  the  Eighth \nAmendment  principles  applied  in  Robinson  have  been \nsatisfied.  Powell, 392 U.S. at 533 (plurality).  The Eighth \nAmendment does not preclude punishing such an act merely \n“because it is, in some sense, ‘involuntary’ or ‘occasioned \nby a compulsion.’”  Id.; see also Martin, 920 F.3d at 592 n.3 \n(M. Smith, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) \n(“Powell does not prohibit the criminalization of involuntary \nconduct.”).   \nFurther, it is hard to deny that Martin has “generate[d] \ndire  practical  consequences  for  the  hundreds  of  local \ngovernments within our jurisdiction, and for the millions of \npeople  that  reside  therein.”    Id.  at  594  (M.  Smith,  J., \ndissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  Those harms, \nof  course,  will  be  greatly  magnified  by  the  egregiously \nflawed  reconceptualization  and  extension  of  Martin’s \nholding in today’s decision, and by the majority’s equally \ntroubling reworking of settled class-action principles.  With \nno sense of irony, the majority declares that no such harms \nare demonstrated by the record in this case, even as the \nmajority largely endorses an injunction effectively requiring \nGrants Pass to allow the use of its public parks as homeless \nencampments.  Other cities in this circuit can be expected to \nsuffer a similar fate. \nIn view of all of the foregoing, both Martin and today’s \ndecision should be overturned or overruled at the earliest \nopportunity, either by this court sitting en banc or by the U.S. \nSupreme Court. \n*          *          * \nI respectfully but emphatically dissent. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 93 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    93 \nSilver,  District  Judge,  and  Gould,  Circuit  Judge,  joint \nstatement regarding denial of rehearing: \n \nThe differences of opinion in this case are hard and there \nis basis for good-faith disagreements which are reflected in \nthe filings from a variety of judges.  The robust defense of \nthe panel majority opinion we offer here should not be read \nas any comment on the sincerity of our colleagues’ quarrels \nwith our position.     \nThe statement regarding the denial of rehearing from \nJudge O’Scannlain and the dissent from Judge M. Smith \nsignificantly exaggerate the holding in Johnson v. Grants \nPass, 50 F.4th 787 (9th Cir. 2022).  Grants Pass, relying on \nMartin v. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584 (9th Cir. 2019), holds \nonly that governments cannot criminalize the act of sleeping \nwith the use of rudimentary protections, such as bedding, \nfrom the elements in some public places when a person has \nnowhere else to sleep.  It does not establish an unrestrained \nright for involuntarily homeless persons to sleep anywhere \nthey choose.  Nor does it require jurisdictions to cede all \npublic spaces to involuntarily homeless persons.  The argued \nnotion  that  Martin  and  Grants  Pass  work  together  to \nguarantee a “federal constitutional ‘right’ . . . to camp or to \nsleep on sidewalks and in parks, playgrounds, and other \npublic places” is completely absent from the opinion.  The \ndenial of en banc rehearing should not be criticized based on \nrhetorical exaggerations. \nBeyond misdescribing the holding of Grants Pass, Judge \nO’Scannlain extrapolates and proposes that the Ninth Circuit \nignore 65 years of Supreme Court precedent in favor of his \npreferred  approach  of  looking  exclusively  to  what  he \ndeclares is the “text, history, and tradition” of the Eighth \nAmendment.  But inferior courts are not free to embark on \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 94 of 155\n94  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nsuch freewheeling adventures when the Supreme Court has \nprovided the applicable guidance.  Judge M. Smith does not \njoin the portion of Judge O’Scannlain’s statement discussing \nthis point, but Judge M. Smith engages in a puzzling error \nby attributing in part the homelessness problem throughout \nthe Ninth Circuit to Martin and now Grants Pass.  The \nhomelessness problem predates Martin, and cities outside \nthe  Ninth  Circuit,  and  outside  the  United  States,  are \nexperiencing crisis-levels of homelessness.  It is implausible \nto argue the crisis would abate if jurisdictions in the Ninth \nCircuit  regained  the  authority  to  punish  involuntarily \nhomeless persons for sleeping in public with blankets.   \nI.  Limited Holding of Grants Pass  \nJudge O’Scannlain and Judge M. Smith aim most of their \nfire  at  the  portion  of  Grants  Pass  addressing  the  two \noverlapping “anti-camping” ordinances.  Grants Pass holds \nthe anti-camping ordinances enacted by the City of Grants \nPass violate the Eighth Amendment but only to the extent \nthey  criminalize  sleeping  with  rudimentary  forms  of \nprotection from the elements (i.e., bedding or sleeping bags) \nby those persons without access to any other shelter (i.e., \npersons who are “involuntarily homeless”).  Grants Pass \ndoes not expressly preface every reference to “homeless \npersons” with the adjective “involuntarily.”  However, in \nclear reliance on Martin, the opinion is strictly limited to \nenforcement  of  the  ordinances  against  “involuntarily” \nhomeless persons.  Like Martin, Grants Pass holds only that \n“it  is  ‘unconstitutional  to  [punish]  simply  sleeping \nsomewhere in public if one has nowhere else to do so.’”  Id. \n(quoting Martin, 920 F.3d at 590 (Berzon, J., concurring in \ndenial of rehearing en banc)).   \nThe holding in Grants Pass is not that involuntarily \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 95 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    95 \nhomeless persons in the City of Grants Pass and elsewhere \nin  the  Ninth  Circuit  are  allowed  to  sleep  wherever  and \nwhenever  they  wish.    When  there  is  space  available  in \nshelters, jurisdictions are free to enforce prohibitions on \nsleeping anywhere in public.  And emphatically, when an \ninvoluntarily homeless person refuses a specific offer of \nshelter  elsewhere,  that  individual  may  be  punished  for \nsleeping  in  public.    When  there  is  no  shelter  space, \njurisdictions may still enforce limitations on sleeping at \ncertain locations.  The assertion that jurisdictions must now \nallow involuntarily homeless persons to camp or sleep on \nevery sidewalk and in every playground is plainly wrong. \nJurisdictions  remain  free  to  address  the  complex  policy \nissues regarding homelessness in the way those jurisdictions \ndeem fit, subject to the single restriction that involuntarily \nhomeless persons must have “somewhere” to sleep and take \nrudimentary precautions (bedding) against the elements.  Id. \n(quoting Martin, 920 F.3d at 590 (Berzon, J., concurring in \ndenial of rehearing en banc)).   \nJudge  M.  Smith  misinterpreted  a  statement  in  the \noriginal majority opinion that he believed mandated “a crude \njurisdiction-wide  inquiry”  dictating  a  local  “government \ncannot prosecute homeless people for sleeping in public if \nthere  is  a  greater  number  of  homeless  individuals  in  a \njurisdiction than the number of available shelter spaces.”  \nJudge M. Smith’s understanding of the original statement \nwas incorrect.  To avoid any possibility of confusion, the \nmajority has now removed the statement Judge M. Smith \nfound confounding.  But Judge M. Smith is still not satisfied.  \nHe complains the change did not result in any “downstream \nchanges” to the majority’s analysis.  But Judge M. Smith \nfails to acknowledge the undisputed facts established that in \nthe  City  of  Grants  Pass,  there  were  zero  shelter  beds \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 96 of 155\n96  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \navailable on almost every night of the year.  Given that, there \nwas no need to change the remaining analysis.     \nAs clearly explained in the majority opinion, the only \nsecular shelter beds in the City of Grants Pass (other than \nbeds for intoxicated adults) were located at a “warming \ncenter”  that  operated  on  especially  cold  nights.    The \nwarming center could hold 40 individuals and was open 16 \nnights during the winter of 2020 and zero nights during the \nwinter of 2021.  Thus, on 95% of the nights in 2020 and \n100% of the nights in 2021, the City of Grants Pass had zero \nsecular shelter beds for non-intoxicated adults.  Given that \nreality, there was no need to make “downstream changes” to \nthe analysis based on the availability of shelter beds in the \nCity of Grants Pass.  When a jurisdiction has zero shelter \nbeds  even  theoretically  available,  it  does  not  require \nsignificant analysis to conclude the jurisdiction is barred \nfrom prosecuting the involuntarily homeless persons in that \njurisdiction.   \nJudge M. Smith’s refusal to acknowledge the lack of \nshelter space in the City of Grants Pass reveals his actual \ncomplaint in this area is the perceived failure to strictly \npolice  who  will  qualify  as  involuntarily  homeless.   \nAccording to Judge M. Smith, it was inappropriate to find \nthat  zero  shelter  beds,  combined  with  “conclusory \nallegations of involuntariness,” were enough to conclude \nthere  were  involuntarily  homeless  persons  in  the \njurisdiction.  The “conclusory allegations” Judge M. Smith \nfaults are expressly found in a declaration submitted by \nGloria Johnson where she stated, in relevant part, “I have no \nchoice but to live outside and have no place else to go,” and \n“I continue to live without shelter in Grants Pass.”  It bears \nrepeating this case was resolved on summary judgment.  The \nCity of Grants Pass did not present any evidence to the \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 97 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    97 \ndistrict  court,  nor  did  it  argue  on  appeal,  that  Gloria \nJohnson’s  declaration  was  inaccurate.    In  fact,  it  is \nundisputed there are at least fifty involuntarily homeless \npersons in the City of Grants Pass, as stated in the testimony \nof  a  City  of  Grants  Pass  police  officer.    Describing \nunequivocal  and  undisputed  statements  submitted  at  the \nsummary judgment stage as mere “conclusory allegations” \nis incorrect.   \nJudge M. Smith worries the amended opinion might still \nprohibit any enforcement actions against individuals with \naccess to shelter.  But the opinion repeatedly notes it only \naddresses  enforcement  attempts  against  “involuntarily \nhomeless persons.”  Grants Pass goes to great lengths to \nmake this clear.  Grants Pass states individuals qualify as \n“involuntarily homeless” only if they “do not have access to \nadequate temporary shelter, whether because they have the \nmeans to pay for it or because it is realistically available to \nthem for free.”  Id. at 793 n.2 (internal quotation marks and \ncitation  omitted).    To  remove  any  doubt,  Grants  Pass \nstresses “[i]ndividuals who have shelter or the means to \nacquire their own shelter simply are never class members,” \nmeaning such individuals are not “involuntarily homeless.”  \nId. at 805.  And to further illuminate the point, Grants Pass \nstates “To be clear: A person with access to temporary \nshelter is not involuntarily homeless unless and until they no \nlonger have access to shelter.”  Id. at 805 n.24.  Judge M. \nSmith’s  assertion  that  Grants  Pass  might  prohibit \nenforcement  against  persons  “no  matter  their  personal \nsituations” is wrong. \nWhen an individual has access to a shelter, such as \nthrough a “city’s offer of temporary housing,” that person is \nnot “involuntarily homeless” and anti-camping ordinances \nmay  be  enforced  against  that  person.    Similarly,  if  a \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 98 of 155\n98  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \njurisdiction  always  has  shelter  beds  or  other  locations \navailable, that jurisdiction is free to enforce its anti-camping \nordinances on all other public areas.   \nJudge M. Smith also claims that after Grants Pass local \nauthorities are  “powerless to cite” individuals “even  for \npublic  defecation.”1    Neither  Martin  nor  Grants  Pass \ninvolved particular ordinances precluding public urination \nand defecation and the assertion that Martin and Grants Pass \nresolved  the  constitutionality  of  ordinances  addressing \npublic urination and defecation is mistaken.2   \n \n1 Judge M. Smith’s sole support for this interpretation is an unpublished \ndecision by the Eastern District of California.  Mahoney v. City of \nSacramento, No. 2:20-cv-00258-KJM, 2020 WL 616302 (E.D. Cal. Feb. \n10, 2020).  That case involved the removal of portable toilets from public \nproperty that had been placed there by private citizens for homeless \nindividuals to use.  The plaintiffs alleged many different constitutional \nclaims, including that the removal of the toilets would violate their \nEighth Amendment rights.  On that point, the City of Sacramento stated \n“neither the benefactors of the toilets nor the users of the toilets have, or \nwill be, criminally prosecuted.”  In denying a request for a temporary \nrestraining order, the court stated “Extending Martin to these facts, the \nCity may not prosecute or otherwise penalize the plaintiffs . . . for \neliminating in public if there is no alternative to doing so.”  Id.  The court \ncontinued, arguably based on the city’s representations regarding non-\nprosecution, that “no irreparable injury to plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment \nrights is likely.”  Id.  Because the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their \nclaim nine days after the court’s order, the court did not provide a more \ncomplete  Eighth  Amendment  analysis  based  on  Martin.    A  brief \nstatement made in the context of resolving an emergency motion is not \na solid foundation for Judge M. Smith’s assertion that after Grants Pass \nlocal authorities are now “powerless to cite” individuals for public \ndefecation.   \n2 The focus of Martin and Grants Pass was sleep.  Sleep is not a \nvoluntary act but an “identifiable human need[].”  Rico v.

And Judge O’Scannlain noted almost twenty years \nago, “[i]n our system of government, courts base decisions \nnot on dramatic Hollywood fantasies . . . but on concretely \nparticularized  facts  developed  in  the  cauldron  of  the \nadversary process and reduced to an assessable record.”  \nUnited States v. Kincade, 379 F.3d 813, 838 (9th Cir. 2004) \n(en banc).  Because there was no challenge to any public \nurination  or  defecation  ordinances  in  Grants  Pass,  the \nparties did not develop a record regarding those issues such \nthat neither the district court nor Ninth Circuit had a basis to \naddress them.  Judge M. Smith’s assertion that Grants Pass \nprohibits citations “even for public defecation” is wrong.  \nII. Class Certification was Proper \nConnected to the purported “jurisdiction-wide analysis,” \nJudge M. Smith argues, as did the dissent by Judge Collins, \nthat Grants Pass erred in affirming certification of the class.  \n \nWalker v. Schult, 717 F.3d 119, 126 (2d Cir. 2013).  See also Wilkins \nKaplan & Sadock’s Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, 10th Ed. \nCH23 (“Sleep is a process required for proper brain function.  Failure to \nsleep impairs thought processes, mood regulation, and a host of normal \nphysiological functions.”).  The lack of sleep may play a role in the \ndevelopment of dementia.  See Nedergaard and Goldman, Glymphatic \nfailure  as  a  final  common  pathway  to  dementia,  available  at \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8186542/.  And long-\nterm sleep deprivation has been shown to be lethal in some animals.

CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nAccording  to  Judge  M.  Smith,  the  opinion  “wholly \ncollaps[es]  the  merits  into  the  class  definition”  which \nresulted in an “impermissible fail safe class.”  The Grants \nPass opinion explains why that conclusion is wrong.  50 \nF.4th at 805 n.23.  In brief, the population of the class of \n“involuntarily homeless” individuals does not change based \non whether the class wins or loses.  There has never been a \npossibility that a “class member either wins or, by virtue of \nlosing,  is  defined  out  of  the  class.”    Olean  Wholesale \nGrocery Coop., Inc. v. Bumble Bee Foods LLC, 31 F.4th \n651, 669 n.14 (9th Cir. 2022) (quotation marks and citation \nomitted). \nJudge M. Smith, as did Judge Collins, also believes the \nclass  should  not  have  been  certified  due  to  a  “lack  of \ncommonality.”    Judge  M.  Smith’s  view  is  that \n“commonality”  was  lacking  because  determining  class \nmembership requires an individualized assessment of each \npotential  class  member’s  access  to  shelter.    This  is  an \nincorrect understanding of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23’s “commonality” requirement.   \nTo satisfy Rule 23’s “commonality” requirement there \nmust be a “common contention” such “that determination of \nits truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the \nvalidity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  Wal-Mart \nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011).  In Grants \nPass, the “common contention” was the assertion that the \nCity’s  anti-camping  ordinances  violated  the  Eighth \nAmendment as applied to the class.  That contention could \nbe resolved in “one stroke,” meaning the “commonality” \nrequirement was met.  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350. \nWhile  not  entirely  clear,  Judge  M.  Smith  might  be \narguing “commonality” does not exist when a court is unable \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 101 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    101 \nto immediately and easily identify each and every class \nmember.  But there has never been such a requirement.  See \nIn re Google Inc. St. View Elec. Commc’ns Litig., 21 F.4th \n1102,  1115  (9th  Cir.  2021)  (affirming  class  settlement \ndespite it being “not feasible” to identify class members).  \nAlternatively,  Judge  M.  Smith  might  be  arguing \n“commonality” does not exist when some effort will be \nrequired to identify class members.  But it is entirely routine \nfor class actions to require individualized determinations to \nidentify class members.   \nFor example, a recent Ninth Circuit opinion involved a \nclass  defined  as  “All  individuals  who  have  worked  as \nCalifornia-based flight attendants of Virgin America, Inc. \nwhile residing in California at any time during the Class \nPeriod.”  Bernstein v. Virgin Am., Inc., 3 F.4th 1127, 1134 \n(9th  Cir.  2021).    Identifying  members  of  that  class \nnecessarily  required  individualized  determinations  to \nidentify  whether  an  individual  had  worked  as  a  flight \nattendant for Virgin America and where the individual had \nlived throughout the multi-year class period.   Judge M. \nSmith’s view that “commonality” is not present whenever \nclass members can only be identified after an individualized \ninquiry would preclude certification of most classes.  \nIII. Eighth Amendment Doctrine \nJudge  O’Scannlain  laments  “Grants  Pass  never \nmeaningfully engaged the text, history, and tradition of the \nConstitution.”  For the most part, that criticism is misplaced \nas the Grants Pass majority was bound to follow Martin.  \nMore importantly, however, the present record does not \ncontain  sufficient  facts  to  conduct  the  analysis  Judge \nO’Scannlain wishes to perform, presumably because the \nparties were aware Judge O’Scannlain’s preferred method of \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 102 of 155\n102  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nanalysis is foreclosed by long established precedent.   \nThe  historical  inquiry  regarding  the  meaning  of \nconstitutional terms may require looking as far back as the \n13th Century.  See Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., \n142 S. Ct. 2228, 2249 (2022) (discussing cases from 13th \ncentury).  The parties in Grants Pass did not gather and \npresent evidence regarding centuries of history to illuminate \nthe complete “text, history, and tradition” of the Eighth \nAmendment.  If, as Judge O’Scannlain believes, courts must \nassess the Eighth Amendment exclusively under a “text, \nhistory, and tradition” approach, the parties must be given \nthe opportunity to present relevant historical evidence. See \nUnited States v. Sineneng-Smith, 140 S. Ct. 1575, 1579 \n(2020)  (noting  courts  should  follow  “party  presentation \nprinciple”).  That may require the parties retain experts.  See, \ne.g., Miller v. Smith, No. 22-1482, 2023 WL 334788, at *1 \n(7th Cir. Jan. 20, 2023) (remanding for district court to \nsolicit additional expert reports regarding “text, history, and \ntradition framework” in Second Amendment case).   \nNotably, Judge O’Scannlain is not arguing Grants Pass \nshould be remanded for a proper inquiry under his proposed \n“text, history, and tradition” test.  Rather, he professes he has \nconducted the relevant inquiry on his own and definitively \nestablished the correct interpretation of centuries of history.  \nOur adversarial system takes a dim view of appellate courts \nembarking  on  their  own  fact-finding  missions.    Alpha \nDistrib. Co. of California v. Jack Daniel Distillery, 454 F.2d \n442, 453 (9th Cir. 1972) (“The appellate court is not the trier \nof facts and does not ordinarily make findings of fact.”).  \nAnd that is especially true when the inquiry has not been \nbriefed by the parties.  Sineneng-Smith, 140 S. Ct. at 1579 \n(2020).  Ultimately, however, Judge O’Scannlain’s favored \nconstitutional analysis is beside the point.  The Supreme \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 103 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    103 \nCourt has made clear “text, history, and tradition” is not the \ncorrect method when assessing Eighth Amendment claims.   \nAccording  to  the  Supreme  Court,  the  proper \ninterpretation  of  the  Eighth  Amendment  does  not  turn \nexclusively on standards from hundreds of years ago.  In a \nplurality opinion in 1958, the Supreme Court explained the \nEighth  Amendment  “must  draw  its  meaning  from  the \nevolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a \nmaturing society.”  Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101 (1958) \n(plurality opinion).  More recently, the Supreme Court stated \na proper Eighth Amendment analysis “is determined not by \nthe standards that prevailed when the Eighth Amendment \nwas  adopted  in  1791  but  by  the  norms  that  ‘currently \nprevail.’”  Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.S. 407, 419 (2008) \n(citation omitted).  And “courts must look beyond historical \nconceptions”  when  assessing  Eighth  Amendment \nchallenges.  Graham v. Florida., 560 U.S. 48, 58 (2010).   \nGiven this guidance, lamenting Grants Pass did not \ndelve  into  the  Eighth  Amendment’s  “text,  history,  and \ntradition” is a complaint that the majority in Grants Pass \nfollowed the Supreme Court’s settled guidance.  Contrary to \nJudge O’Scannlain, the majority in Grants Pass was not free \nto ignore the Supreme Court, embark on its own fact-finding \nmission,  and  conclude  the  correct  interpretation  of  the \nEighth  Amendment  is  the  one  Judge  O’Scannlain  likes.  \nInstead, the majority chose the more modest approach of \napplying existing Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit authority \nto the record presented by the parties.3   \n \n3 Judge Graber agrees with the “underlying legal premise” that the Eighth \nAmendment prohibits criminal prosecution of involuntarily homeless \npersons.  But she believes Grants Pass “unjustifiably expands the reach \nof the Eighth Amendment” by prohibiting “civil remedies that could, in \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 104 of 155\n104  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nIV. Application of Marks Doctrine \nBoth Judge O’Scannlain and Judge M. Smith take issue \nwith  the  Marks  v.  United  States,  430  U.S.  188  (1977), \nanalysis in Martin and Grants Pass.  According to them, the \nproper application of the Marks doctrine is obvious and \nshould have prevented the result in Martin and Grants Pass.  \nIt is not clear if the Marks analyses conducted by Judge \nO’Scannlain  and  Judge  M.  Smith  reach  the  same \nconclusion.4    Moreover,  neither  Judge  O’Scannlain  nor \nJudge M. Smith cite the en banc majority opinion from the \nFourth  Circuit  that  conducts  the  Marks  analysis  on  the \nrelevant Supreme Court authorities and reaches the “same \nconclusion” as that reached in Martin.  Manning v. Caldwell \nfor City of Roanoke, 930 F.3d 264, 283 n.17 (4th Cir. 2019) \n(en banc).  Thus, Judge O’Scannlain and Judge M. Smith \nshow overconfidence that their application of the Marks \ndoctrine is correct.  In the end, however, an exhaustive \n \ntheory, lead to [criminal] prosecution.”  But all parties in Grants Pass \nagreed the civil violations were used as the first step in the eventual \npursuit of criminal charges.  This is not a case where the jurisdiction has \ndisavowed pursuing criminal charges.   \n4 Judge O’Scannlain describes Justice White’s concurrence in Powell v. \nTexas, 392 U.S. 514 (1968), as “the dispositive fifth vote.”  But Judge \nO’Scannlain also relies heavily, without explanation, on statements \nmade by the non-binding plurality in Powell.  As for Judge M. Smith, he \nargues Powell produced “no single rationale and only its specific result \nis binding.”  But Judge M. Smith then faults the Martin and Grants Pass \nmajorities  for  not  addressing  arguments  made  by  the  non-binding \nplurality in Powell.  Judge M. Smith seems to believe proper application \nof the Marks doctrine means only the result in Powell is binding, but \nlower courts have an affirmative obligation to address points made by \nthe Powell plurality.  Judge M. Smith does not cite any authority for his \nidiosyncratic view of how the Marks doctrine operates.    \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 105 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    105 \nMarks analysis is not necessary. \nEveryone agrees Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660 \n(1962) is the binding Supreme Court precedent.  It is vital \nthat every justice in Powell v. State of Texas, 392 U.S. 514 \n(1968), fully embraced the holding in Robinson that a status \ncannot be prosecuted.  In Robinson, the Supreme Court \nconcluded it violated the Eighth Amendment for California \nto criminalize the status of being “addicted to the use of \nnarcotics.”  In doing so, the Supreme Court also noted it \nwould violate the Eighth Amendment for a state to make it a \ncriminal offense to be “mentally ill, or a leper, or to be \nafflicted with a venereal disease.”  Robinson, 370 U.S. at \n666.  And “[e]ven one day in prison would be a cruel and \nunusual punishment for the ‘crime’ of having a common \ncold.”  Id. at 667.  Judge O’Scannlain and Judge M. Smith \ninterpret Robinson as establishing a conclusive line between \nconstitutionally barred “status crimes” and constitutionally \npermitted  “conduct  crimes.”    But  such  a  definitive  line \nrequires Robinson be read rigidly, such that a jurisdiction \ncould avoid Robinson by tying “statuses” to inescapable \nhuman activities. \nFor example, under a strict “status-conduct” distinction, \nthe California statute at issue in Robinson could have been \ncured by tying the addiction status to sleeping.  Under such \nlogic, it would have been constitutional for California to \nmake it a criminal offense for a person “addicted to the use \nof narcotics” to fall asleep.  Id. at 660.  Similarly, it now \nwould  be  constitutional  for  a  jurisdiction  to  criminalize \nfalling asleep while being “mentally ill, or a leper, or [] \nafflicted with a venereal disease.”  Id. at 666.  Reading \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 106 of 155\n106  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nRobinson as allowing such simple evasion is absurd.5   \nRegardless of the Marks analysis, Robinson limits the \nreach of criminal law.  Or, as the Supreme Court declared \nfifteen  years  after  Robinson,  the  Eighth  Amendment \n“imposes substantive limits on what can be made criminal \nand punished as such.”  Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, \n667  (1977).    Martin  and  Grants  Pass  recognize  those \nsubstantive limits reach the exceptionally narrow situation \nof  prohibiting  punishment  when  involuntarily  homeless \npersons  engage  in  the  life-sustaining  act  of  sleeping  in \npublic.  Criminalizing the act of sleeping in public when an \nindividual  has  nowhere  else  to  sleep  is,  in  effect, \ncriminalizing the underlying status of being homeless. \nV.  Non-Existent Circuit Split  \nJudge O’Scannlain greatly overstates the extent to which \nMartin and Grants Pass fall on one side of an existing circuit \nsplit.  According to Judge O’Scannlain, no “federal circuit \nor state supreme court . . . has ever embraced Grants Pass’s \nsweeping holding” regarding the Eighth Amendment.  Judge \nO’Scannlain then cites opinions from the Eleventh and Fifth \nCircuits,  but  neither  of  those  opinions  hold  what  Judge \nO’Scannlain claims.  In fact, no circuit court has reached the \nmerits  of  a  challenge  to  public  camping  or  sleeping \n \n5 Even the dissent in the Fourth Circuit opinion Judge O’Scannlain cites \nwith approval understood the logic of Robinson points away from a rigid \ninterpretation.  Manning v. Caldwell for City of Roanoke, 930 F.3d 264, \n290 (4th Cir. 2019) (Wilkinson, J., dissenting).  That dissent noted “[i]n \nthe rare case where the Eighth Amendment was found to invalidate a \ncriminal law, the law in question sought to punish persons merely for \ntheir need to eat or sleep, which are essential bodily functions.  This is \nsimply a variation of Robinson’s command that the state identify conduct \nin crafting its laws, rather than punish a person’s mere existence.”  Id.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 107 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    107 \nrestrictions  when  no  shelter  space  was  available  and \nconcluded such restrictions were lawful.  Judge O’Scannlain \nalso points to a state supreme court opinion but that opinion \nexplicitly does not decide the question presented in Martin \nand Grants Pass. \nFirst, in Joel v. City of Orlando, 232 F.3d 1353 (11th Cir. \n2000), the Eleventh Circuit addressed a challenge to an anti-\ncamping ordinance.  The entire Eighth Amendment analysis \nin that case was premised on the fact the City of Orlando \n“presented unrefuted evidence that . . . a large homeless \nshelter . . . never reached its maximum capacity and that no \nindividual has been turned away because there was no space \navailable or for failure to pay the one dollar nightly fee.”  Id. \nat 1362.  Thus, the Eleventh Circuit concluded the anti-\nsleeping  ordinance  did  “not  criminalize  involuntary \nbehavior” because the plaintiff could “comply with the [anti-\nsleeping] ordinance” by sleeping in the shelter.  Id.  There is \nno suggestion the result would have been the same if there \nwere no shelter space available.   \nJudge  O’Scannlain  claims  the  availability  of  shelter \nspace  is  not  a  “compelling  response”  in  terms  of \ndistinguishing the result in Joel from that in Martin and \nGrants Pass.  But the central holding in Martin and Grants \nPass  is  that  the  Eighth  Amendment  analysis  turns  on \nwhether there are shelter beds or other locations where an \ninvoluntarily homeless person can lawfully sleep.  It would \nbe hard to imagine a more “compelling” way to distinguish \nJoel  than  pointing  out  Joel  did  not  involve  involuntary \nconduct because shelter space was always available.   \nJudge O’Scannlain also cites Johnson v. City of Dallas, \nTex., 61 F.3d 442 (5th Cir. 1995), where the Fifth Circuit \nconcluded the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge an anti-\n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 108 of 155\n108  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nsleeping ordinance because they had not been prosecuted.  \nThe district court had conducted an extensive overview of \nthe Supreme Court cases and concluded the challenged anti-\nsleeping ordinance impermissibly “punishe[d] the homeless \nfor their status as homeless.”  Johnson v. City of Dallas, 860 \nF. Supp. 344, 350 (N.D. Tex. 1994).  Instead of rejecting or \neven addressing such reasoning, the Fifth Circuit concluded \nno individual had standing to seek pre-enforcement review \nof  a  criminal  statute.    It  is  not  clear  whether  Judge \nO’Scannlain agrees with this standing analysis and there is \nsignificant reason to doubt it is correct.  See, e.g., Holder v. \nHumanitarian L. Project, 561 U.S. 1, 15 (2010) (allowing \n“preenforcement review of a criminal statute”).  But at the \nvery least, it is misleading to describe the Fifth Circuit’s \nrejection based on standing as establishing any position on \nthe merits of the Eighth Amendment issue.6   \n \n6 Judge O’Scannlain also professes to find conflicting decisions from the \nFirst and Seventh Circuits.  In the First Circuit case, the defendant argued \n“because his drug addiction is a disease, sentencing him to a term of \nimprisonment for manifesting a condition of his disease constitutes cruel \nand unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.”  United \nStates v. Sirois, 898 F.3d 134, 135 (1st Cir. 2018).  The First Circuit \nrejected this argument, primarily because the standard of review was \n“clear error” based on the defendant’s failure to raise the argument in the \ndistrict court.  Thus, the First Circuit held only that existing caselaw did \nnot make it “clear or obvious” that “the Eighth Amendment proscribes \ncriminal punishment for conduct that results from narcotic addiction.”  \nId. at 138.  Concluding existing caselaw did not make the issue “clear or \nobvious” is not the same as reaching the merits of the issue. As for the \nSeventh Circuit opinion, it is unpublished and is based on an obvious \nerror.  The opinion discusses a defendant who, allegedly due to his \nalcoholism, “failed to attend treatment programs, used cocaine, and \nabused  alcohol  so  excessively  that  it  led  to  his  arrest  for  public \nintoxication.”  United States v. Stenson, 475 Fed. App’x 630, 631 (7th \nCir. 2012).  The Seventh Circuit concluded the defendant could be \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 109 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    109 \nJudge O’Scannlain also cites Tobe v. City of Santa Ana, \n892 P.2d 1145 (1995) from the California Supreme Court.  \nThat case involved a facial challenge to an anti-camping \nordinance.  Id. at 1154.  The California Supreme Court \nexplicitly noted, however, it was not resolving whether an \n“involuntarily homeless person who involuntarily camps on \npublic property may be convicted or punished under the \nordinance.”  Id. at 1166 n.19.  Claiming Tobe is contrary to \nGrants Pass requires ignoring the language of Tobe. \nFinally,  Judge  O’Scannlain  does  not  disclose  that \nreaching his preferred result would create a circuit split with \nthe Fourth Circuit.  In Manning v. Caldwell for City of \nRoanoke, 930 F.3d 264, 268 (4th Cir. 2019) (en banc), the \nen  banc  Fourth  Circuit  addressed  Virginia’s  statutory \nscheme  that  made  it  a  criminal  offense  for  individuals \nidentified as “habitual drunkards” to possess or attempt to \npossess alcohol.  The Fourth Circuit concluded this scheme \nmight violate the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual \nPunishments clause because it targeted “conduct that is both \ncompelled by [the plaintiffs’] illness and is otherwise lawful \nfor all those of legal drinking age.”  Id. at 281.  In reaching \nthat conclusion, the Fourth Circuit unequivocally adopted \nthe same view of the Supreme Court cases regarding status \ncrimes as that adopted in Martin.  930 F.3d at 282 n.17.   \nJudge O’Scannlain acknowledges that Manning holds \n“involuntary conduct may be exempt” from prosecution.  \n \npunished for those acts because he was not being “punished for his status \nas an alcoholic but for his conduct.”  Id.  However, as noted by the Fourth \nCircuit, the Seventh Circuit “erroneously treated the plurality opinion in \nPowell as the holding of the Court.”  Manning v. Caldwell for City of \nRoanoke, 930 F.3d 264, 283 n.17 (4th Cir. 2019).  Therefore, Stenson is \nof little value. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 110 of 155\n110  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nBut he argues Manning “limited its holding to laws that \nsingled individuals out for special punishment for otherwise \nlawful conduct that is compelled by their illness.”  Judge \nO’Scannlain apparently believes the ordinances addressed in \nGrants Pass do not “single out” individuals in a similar \nmanner.    Judge  O’Scannlain  is  wrong.    The  ordinances \naddressed in Grants Pass target the involuntarily homeless \nthe same way the scheme in Manning targeted alcoholics. \nUnder the ordinances addressed in Grants Pass, it would \nbe lawful for an individual with access to shelter to wrap \nhimself in a blanket in a public park because the individual \nwas not using the blanket “for the purpose of maintaining a \ntemporary place to live.”  50 F.4th at 793.  However, the \nsame  conduct  could  lead  to  criminal  prosecution  of  an \ninvoluntarily homeless person because, with no other place \nto live, the person would be using the blanket for purposes \nof maintaining a place to live.  In brief, blanket use in a \npublic park is criminal if you are homeless and “lawful \nconduct” if you are not.  As with the ordinances in Manning \nregarding alcoholics, the ordinances addressed in Grants \nPass  single  out  the  involuntarily  homeless  for \ncriminalization of otherwise lawful conduct. \nJudge  O’Scannlain’s  purported  “deep  and  varied \nintercircuit split over how to read the Eighth Amendment” is \nan illusion.  The Ninth Circuit is the sole circuit to have \naddressed, on the merits, a challenge to the criminalization \nof sleeping in public by involuntarily homeless persons.  The \nNinth Circuit’s current approach is faithful to Supreme Court \nprecedent and consistent with the Fourth Circuit’s approach \nto a similar issue.  Thus, Judge O’Scannlain’s desire to hear \nGrants Pass en banc is so that a circuit split with the Fourth \nCircuit can be created, not that an existing circuit split can \nbe resolved.   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 111 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    111 \nVI. Evidence Not in the Record \nJudge M. Smith cites a wide variety of extra-record \nevidence  establishing  homelessness  is  a  serious  issue \n“caused by a complex mix of economic, mental-health, and \nsubstance-abuse factors.”  Everyone agrees.  Judge M. Smith \nthen states, “local governments have taken a variety of steps \nintended to ameliorate the crisis . . . but most of these \nattempts to mitigate the challenging issues of homelessness \nhave  been  wholly  or  partially  frustrated  by  an  alleged \nconstitutional right conjured by a panel of our court.”  This \nappears to say that, but for Martin and now Grants Pass, \nlocal governments would be able to pursue policies that \nwould reduce the homeless population.  In other words, \nJudge  M.  Smith  believes  Martin  and  Grants  Pass  are \nsomewhat  responsible  for  the  size  of  the  homeless \npopulation.  That is not sensible.   \nJudge M. Smith points out the City of Los Angeles has \nroughly 70,000 homeless persons.  Judge M. Smith seems to \nbelieve at least some of those 70,000 persons, and more \nthroughout the Ninth Circuit, remain homeless because of \nthe very limited protection offered by Martin.  Thus, it \nfollows that if Martin were overruled and criminal penalties \nwere again possible, at least some of those 70,000 persons in \nLos Angeles would obtain housing.  Judge M. Smith does \nnot cite any authority that shows the possibility of criminal \npenalties would have this effect.  Available evidence points \naway from such a conclusion.  See, e.g., Donald Saelinger, \nNowhere  to  Go:  The  Impacts  of  City  Ordinances \nCriminalizing Homelessness, 13 Geo. J. on Poverty L. & \nPol'y 545, 559 (2006) (“[C]riminalization laws make it much \nmore difficult for the homeless to gain social and economic \nmobility, and thus the laws have the result of extending the \nperiod of time that one is homeless.”).   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 112 of 155\n112  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nJudge  M.  Smith’s  extra-record  evidence  is  carefully \nlimited to support his causal theory.  But if extra-record \nevidence  should  be  considered,  other  jurisdictions  show \nMartin is not the problem.  New York City is experiencing a \ncrisis  in  the  increase  of  the  involuntarily  homeless \npopulation.  As of February 2023, New York City had more \nthan  77,000  homeless  persons,  “by  far  the  most  ever \nrecorded and an increase of over 70 percent since May.”  \nEmma G. Fitzsimmons and Andy Newman, New York City \nCommissioner Of Social Services Resigns, The New York \nTimes (Feb. 8, 2023).  New York City is not in the Ninth \nCircuit and it seems unlikely the holding in Martin is causing \na surge in the homeless population across the country.  Thus, \nMartin is not, as alleged, the driver of the homelessness \nproblem. \nVII. Conclusion \nThe Eighth Amendment “imposes substantive limits on \nwhat  can  be  made  criminal  and  punished  as  such.”  \nIngraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 667 (1977).  Those \nsubstantive limits are implicated only in rare circumstances.  \nOne such circumstance is when a jurisdiction attempts to \npunish  as  a  criminal  offense  the  life-sustaining  act  of \nsleeping in public with bedding when a person has nowhere \nelse  to  go.    Because  Grants  Pass  and  Martin  provide \nexceptionally  limited  protection,  and  are  consistent  with \nSupreme Court precedent, the decision not to rehear Grants \nPass en banc is correct.7 \n \n7 The city ordinances addressed in Grants Pass will be superseded, to \nsome extent, on July 1, 2023, when a new Oregon state law takes effect.  \nThe new state law requires “[a]ny city or county law that regulates the \nacts of sitting, lying, sleeping or keeping warm and dry outdoors on \npublic property that is open to the public must be objectively reasonable \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 113 of 155\n  JOHNSON V.

SMITH joins as to all parts except Part II-A, respecting \nthe denial of rehearing en banc: \nWith  this  decision,  our  Circuit’s  jurisprudence  now \neffectively  guarantees  a  personal  federal  constitutional \n‘right’ for individuals to camp or to sleep on sidewalks and \nin parks, playgrounds, and other public places in defiance of \ntraditional  health,  safety,  and  welfare  laws—a  dubious \nholding premised on a fanciful interpretation of the Eighth \nAmendment.  We are the first and only federal circuit to have \ndivined such a strange and sweeping mandate from the Cruel \nand Unusual Punishments Clause.  Our jurisprudence in this \ncase is egregiously flawed and deeply damaging—at war \nwith constitutional text, history, and tradition, and Supreme \nCourt precedent.

This change in state law is yet another \nreason why it was wise to not rehear Grants Pass.   \n1 As a judge of this court in senior status, I no longer have the power to \nvote on calls for rehearing cases en banc or formally to join a dissent \nfrom failure to rehear en banc.

We should have reheard this  case en banc to \nreconsider our unfortunate constitutional mistake. \nI \nInstead of respecting constitutional “text, history, and \nprecedent,” Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., 142 S. \nCt.  2228,  2271  (2022),  our  Eighth  Amendment \njurisprudence here has disrupted the “paramount role of the \nStates  in  setting  ‘standards  of  criminal  responsibility,’” \nKahler v. Kansas, 140 S. Ct. 1021, 1028 (2020) (quoting \nPowell v. Texas, 392 U.S. 514, 533 (1968) (plurality)).  In \nmy view, our cases do not inspire confidence that we have \nfaithfully  followed  the  Cruel  and  Unusual  Punishments \nClause—and it is worth explaining how we got here before \nconsidering why we should have reheard Grants Pass en \nbanc to fix our constitutional mistakes.

City of Grants Pass, 50 F.4th 787 (9th \nCir. 2022) (expanding the doctrine). \nA \nOur  untenable  jurisprudence  here  started  in  Boise—\nwhere  a  three-judge  panel  first  invented  a  federal \nconstitutional ‘right’ (rooted in the Eighth Amendment, of \nall  places!)  to  sleep  on  public  property.    In  Boise,  six \nhomeless individuals alleged that the City of Boise, Idaho, \nhad  violated  their  constitutional  rights  by  enforcing \nmunicipal ordinances that prohibited unauthorized sleeping \non sidewalks and in parks, plazas, and other public places.  \nEven though the Eighth Amendment, on its own terms, only \nprohibits  “cruel  and  unusual  punishments,”  U.S.  Const. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 115 of 155\n  JOHNSON V.

VIII, the Boise panel went where no federal circuit \nhad  gone  before—holding  that  the  Eighth  Amendment \nprohibited a local government from “prosecuting people \ncriminally” for the “involuntary act” of “sleeping outside on \npublic property [including sidewalks] when those people \nhave no home or other shelter to go to.”  Boise, 920 F.3d at \n603, 613, 616 (cleaned up).   \nIn doing so, the Boise panel made no effort to ground its \ndecision  in  the  text,  history,  or  tradition  of  the  Eighth \nAmendment.    Instead—after  failing  to  identify  a  single \nSupreme Court precedent blessing its approach—the Boise \npanel attempted to fashion its preferred constitutional rule by \nstitching together dicta in a lone concurrence with a dissent.  \nId. at 616 (holding that these separate, unprevailing writings \nin Powell “compel[led]” Boise’s result).  While we declined \nto rehear Boise en banc, see id. at 590-99 (M.

See Grants Pass, 50 F.4th at 792-93, 813.2  \nIn this case, several individuals sought to represent a putative \nclass of all involuntarily homeless people living in Grants \nPass,  seeking  a  permanent  injunction  barring  the \nenforcement  of  municipal  ordinances  that  prohibited \nunauthorized sleeping or camping in public spaces.

The district court sided with \nthe challengers—and it certified a class consisting of “[a]ll \ninvoluntarily homeless individuals living in Grants Pass,” \nand held that the City’s enforcement of the public-sleeping \nand  public-camping  ordinances  violated  the  Eighth \nAmendment.

While  our  mistaken \njurisprudence in this area has some limits, see Grants Pass, 50 F.4th at \n812 n.33, we should not pretend that the jurisprudential experiment \nstarted by Boise and expanded by Grants Pass—which “effectively \nstrikes down the anti-camping and anti-sleeping [o]rdinances … of \ncountless, if not all, cities within our jurisdiction,” Boise, 920 F.3d at 599 \n(M.

After concluding that class \ncertification was proper, the panel majority held, following \nBoise, that the City could not enforce the public-camping \nand  park-exclusion  ordinances  against  “involuntarily \nhomeless persons” for the “mere act of sleeping” or camping \nin public spaces when “there is no other place in the City for \nthem to go.”  Id. at 798 & n.12, 813 (remanding, inter alia, \non  the  public-sleeping  ordinance  because  the  relevant \nplaintiff had died).  It also expanded Boise by holding that \nthe City could not deprive persons of whatever materials \nthey needed “to keep … warm and dry,” and by extending \nBoise  from  the  purely  criminal  arena  to  civil  fines  and \ncitations.  Id. at 806-09.  In doing so, the panel majority—\ncontent to rest on Boise’s tortured reading of Supreme Court \nprecedent, see id. at 808-11—declined to devote any serious \nattention  to  the  text,  history,  or  tradition  of  the  Eighth \nAmendment. \n2 \nJudge Collins dissented.  Id. at 814-31.  He explained, \ninter alia, that the case should be reheard en banc because \nthe panel majority decision combined a “gross misreading of \n[Boise] with a flagrant disregard of settled class-certification \nprinciples,” and because “the foundation on which [the panel \nmajority decision] is built is deeply flawed: [Boise] seriously \nmisconstrued  the  Eighth  Amendment  and  the  Supreme \nCourt’s caselaw construing it.”  Id. at 814, n.1.  In his view, \nBoise has “‘generate[d] dire practical consequences for the \nhundreds of local governments within our jurisdiction,’” and \nthose harms will be “greatly magnified by the egregiously \nflawed  reconceptualization  and  extension  of  [Boise’s] \nholding.”  Id. at 831 (quoting Boise, 920 F.3d at 594 (M. \nSmith, J., dissental)). \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 118 of 155\n118  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nII \nThere is a simple reason why we should have reheard \nGrants Pass en banc: it entrenches a deeply damaging and \negregiously wrong construction of the Eighth Amendment in \nour Circuit’s precedent.  An “erroneous interpretation” of the \nConstitution is “always important.”  Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at \n2265.  But some judicial mistakes are “more damaging” than \nothers—and “more than just wrong.”  Id. at 2265-66.  The \nnovel and expansive jurisprudence entrenched by Grants \nPass—which thumbs its nose at the “standard grounds for \nconstitutional  decisionmaking[:]  text,  history,  and \nprecedent”—stands on “exceptionally weak grounds” and \n“should be overruled.”  Id. at 2264, 2266, 2271. \nA \nThe first flaw in Grants Pass’s jurisprudence is that it \nconflicts with the text, history, and tradition of the Eighth \nAmendment—which  demonstrate  that  the  Cruel  and \nUnusual Punishments Clause does not establish a federal \nconstitutional  “doctrine[]  of  criminal  responsibility.”  \nKahler, 140 S. Ct. at 1028 (cleaned up).  Constitutional text, \nhistory, and tradition make plain that the Clause was directed \nto modes of punishment—and that it was never intended to \narrogate the substantive authority of legislatures to prohibit \n“acts” like those at issue here, and “certainly not before \nconviction.”  Boise, 920 F.3d at 602 (Bennett, J., dissental).  \nIndeed, one might question whether the Cruel and Unusual \nPunishments  Clause  has  anything  to  do  with  the \njurisprudence embraced by Grants Pass—which authorizes \na plaintiff who has never been assigned a “punishment,” let \nalone one that is “cruel and unusual,” to challenge traditional \nanti-vagrancy regulations under the Clause.  It is regrettable \nthat  Grants  Pass  never  meaningfully  engaged  the  text, \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 119 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    119 \nhistory, and tradition of the Constitution—which are the \n“standard  grounds  for  constitutional  decisionmaking.”  \nDobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2271 (“text, history, and precedent”); \nsee, e.g., Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 664 (1977) \n(“history” and precedent); Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.S. \n407, 421 (2008) (“text, history, meaning, and purpose”); see \nalso, e.g., Kennedy v. Bremerton Sch. Dist., 142 S. Ct. 2407, \n2428  (2022)  (“historical  practices  and  understandings” \n(cleaned up)); New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n, Inc. v. \nBruen, 142 S. Ct. 2111, 2128-29 (2022) (“text and history”); \nWashington  v.  Glucksberg,  521  U.S.  702,  721  (1997) \n(“history and tradition” (cleaned up)). \n1 \nThe Eighth Amendment provides, “Excessive bail shall \nnot be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and \nunusual punishments inflicted.”  U.S. Const. amend. VIII \n(emphasis  added).    The  Amendment’s  bar  on  excessive \n“bail,” excessive “fines,” and the infliction of cruel and \nunusual “punishments” indicates the Amendment’s punitive \nfocus.  And the text of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments \nClause itself provides no substantive limit on what conduct \nmay be punished.  Instead, it only prohibits “punishments” \n(i.e., pain or suffering inflicted for a crime or offense) that \nare “cruel” (i.e., marked by savagery and barbarity) and \n“unusual”  (i.e.,  not  in  common  use),  reflecting  a \nconstitutional  prohibition  originally  and  traditionally \nunderstood  to  forbid  the  government  from  “authorizing \nparticular forms or ‘modes’ of punishment—specifically, \ncruel  methods  of  punishment  that  are  not  regularly  or \ncustomarily employed.”  Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. \n957,  976  (1991)  (opinion  of  Scalia,  J.);  id.  at  979 \n(“[b]reaking on the wheel,” “flaying alive,” and “maiming, \nmutilating,  and  scourging  to  death”  (cleaned  up)). \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 120 of 155\n120  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nConstitutional  text,  history,  and  tradition  make  clear—\ncontrary to Grants Pass’s holding—that the Clause was not \noriginally understood to displace the authority of legislatures \nto prohibit historically proscribable acts (and certainly not \nbefore any punishment was imposed), see Boise, 920 F.3d at \n599-603 (Bennett, J., dissental), and that the Clause was not \ntraditionally taken to enshrine a constitutional “doctrine[] of \ncriminal responsibility,” Kahler, 140 S. Ct. at 1028 (cleaned \nup). \n2 \nUltimately, the text, history, and tradition of the Eighth \nAmendment teach a simple truth: the Cruel and Unusual \nPunishments  Clause—a  constitutional  prohibition \nfundamentally centered on modes of punishment—is not a \nboundless remedy for all social and policy ills, including \nhomelessness.  It does not empower us to displace state and \nlocal decisionmakers with our own enlightened view of how \nto address a public crisis over which we can claim neither \nexpertise nor authority, and it certainly does not authorize us \nto dictate municipal policy here.  Given the “centuries-long \nevolution of the collection of interlocking and overlapping \nconcepts which the common law has utilized to assess the \nmoral  accountability  of  an  individual  for  his  antisocial \ndeeds,” including the “doctrines of actus reus, mens rea, \ninsanity, mistake, justification, and duress,” the “process of \nadjustment” of the “tension between the evolving aims of the \ncriminal law and changing religious, moral, philosophical, \nand medical views of the nature of man” has primarily “been \nthought to be the province of the States.”  Powell, 392 U.S. \nat 535-36 (plurality).  So long as “the accused has committed \nsome act, has engaged in some behavior, which society has \nan interest in preventing, or perhaps in historical common \nlaw terms, has committed some actus reus,” the Eighth \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 121 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    121 \nAmendment does not prohibit punishing such an act merely \n“because it is, in some sense, ‘involuntary’ or ‘occasioned \nby a compulsion.’”  Id. at 533.  It is troubling that our \nCircuit—in inventing a new individual ‘right’ unmoored \nfrom  text,  history,  or  tradition—has  twisted  the  Eighth \nAmendment to displace the substantive authority of local \nofficials to prohibit a species of antisocial conduct that was \nneither originally nor traditionally thought to warrant the \nprotection of the Constitution, let alone immunity under the \nCruel and Unusual Punishments Clause. \nB \nThe second flaw in Grants Pass’s jurisprudence is that it \nlacks any foundation in the Eighth Amendment doctrine \nhanded down to us by the Supreme Court—which, to be \nclear, has never accepted Grants Pass’s theory that the Cruel \nand  Unusual  Punishments  Clause  establishes  a  federal \nconstitutional  prohibition  on  the  criminalization  of \npurportedly  nonvolitional  conduct.    While  Grants  Pass \npurports faithfully to follow the Supreme Court’s decisions \nin Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660 (1962), and Powell \nv. Texas, 392 U.S. 514 (1968), it actually rests on a plain \nmisreading of the Supreme Court’s instructions because it \ndoes little more than combine dicta in a solo concurrence \nwith a dissent.  In doing so, Grants Pass has clearly erred—\nembracing a startling misapplication of the Marks doctrine \nto venture far astray from Supreme Court precedent, see \nMarks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977) (“When a \nfragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale \nexplaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the \nholding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by \nthose Members who  concurred in the judgments on the \nnarrowest grounds.” (cleaned up)). \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 122 of 155\n122  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n1 \nThe  Supreme  Court  has  never  blessed  our  Circuit’s \nsweeping approach to the Eighth Amendment here—and \nneither Robinson nor Powell provide any support for Grants \nPass’s  adventurous  holding.    In  Robinson,  the  Supreme \nCourt first articulated the status-act distinction that should \nhave made this a simple case—holding only that the Eighth \nAmendment prohibited states from making it a crime “to be \naddicted to the use of narcotics.”  Robinson, 370 U.S. at 662 \n(cleaned up).  Unlike laws “punish[ing] a person for the use \nof narcotics, for their purchase, sale or possession, or for \nantisocial  or  disorderly  behavior  resulting  from  their \nadministration,” the California law invalidated by Robinson \npunished the mere “status” of narcotics addiction, unmoored \nfrom any particular conduct.  Id. at 662, 666.  The holding of \nRobinson is simple: the criminal law cannot punish status \n(e.g., “be[ing] addicted to the use of narcotics”); it can only \npunish conduct (e.g., “the use of narcotics”).  Id. at 662-67 \n(cleaned up); see Manning v. Caldwell for City of Roanoke, \n930 F.3d 264, 288 (4th Cir. 2019) (en banc) (Wilkinson, J., \ndissenting). \nThe Supreme Court has not wavered from the status-act \ndistinction articulated by Robinson—and Powell is certainly \nno exception.  In Powell, decided soon after Robinson, a \nfractured Supreme Court upheld a Texas law prohibiting \npublic drunkenness against an Eighth Amendment challenge \nalleging that the alcoholic’s status compelled him to drink in \npublic.  Powell, 392 U.S. 514.  No controlling majority \nrejected the status-act line drawn by Robinson: (1) Justice \nMarshall’s four-justice plurality upheld the statute based on \nRobinson’s status-act distinction, id. at 516-37 (plurality); \n(2) Justice White’s lone concurrence (the dispositive fifth \nvote) upheld the statute because it involved a volitional act, \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 123 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    123 \nand he declined to determine whether a non-volitional act \ncould be criminalized, id. at 548-54 (White, J., concurring); \nand  (3)  Justice  Fortas’s  four-justice  dissent  rejected \nRobinson’s status-act distinction and deemed the statute’s \nenforcement  unconstitutional,  id.  at  554-70  (Fortas,  J., \ndissenting).  Because Justice White did not “reach[] the \nbroader question of compulsion, the judgment in Powell \nneither extended [n]or contracted Robinson, which was left \nundisturbed.”  Manning, 930 F.3d at 289 (Wilkinson, J., \ndissenting).  And the Supreme Court has certainly never \nunderstood Powell to have such broad effect: it has neither \n“walked  away  from  Robinson”  nor  “embraced  [Boise’s] \nwhole notion of nonvolitional conduct.”  Id. \n2 \nNevertheless,  Grants  Pass—turning  to  Powell’s \nfractured decision, see  Grants Pass, 50 F.4th at 809-11 \n(contorting  Powell  and  Marks)—attempts  to  “tease  [its] \npreferred  reading  from  the  dicta  of  a  single  justice,” \nManning,  930  F.3d  at  290  (Wilkinson,  J.,  dissenting).  \nGrants Pass’s distortion of Powell clearly violates Marks—\nwhich, as explained, instructs that the Court’s holding is \n“that position taken by those Members who concurred in the \njudgment[] on the narrowest grounds.”  Marks, 430 U.S. at \n193 (cleaned up).  Because no victorious majority in Powell \ndisrupted  Robinson’s  “status-act”  distinction  or  blessed \nGrants Pass’s “involuntary conduct” theory, we are left with \nnothing  more  than  Grants  Pass’s  attempt  to  craft  its \npreferred rule by combining dicta in a concurrence with a \ndissent—which  means  that  Grants  Pass  is  ultimately \npredicated on a plain Marks violation.  Such a fundamental \nmistake, which directly implicates the limits on an inferior \ncourt’s authority to circumvent the limits of such controlling \nprecedents, should not remain the law of our Circuit. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 124 of 155\n124  JOHNSON V.

But even apart \nfrom the constitutional errors entrenched by Grants Pass, \nthere  are  additional,  compelling  reasons  why  this  case \nwarranted rehearing en banc.  Perhaps most importantly, our \nexpansive  interpretation  of  the  Cruel  and  Unusual \nPunishments Clause diverges from other courts on an issue \nof exceptional importance—and it is telling that we remain \nthe  only  circuit  bold  enough  to  embrace  an  Eighth \nAmendment  doctrine  that  effectively  requires  local \ncommunities to surrender their sidewalks and other public \nplaces to homeless encampments. \nA \nThe  Eighth  Amendment  jurisprudence  undergirding \nGrants Pass squarely conflicts with decisions from other \ncircuits and other courts.  We should not pretend that our \nCircuit’s divination of a personal constitutional ‘right’ to \nencamp on public property (including sidewalks) is anything \nbut the inventive, judge-made novelty that we all know it to \nbe. \n1 \nThe  first  set  of  conflicts—which  centers  on  Grants \nPass’s result—is plain.  No federal circuit or state supreme \ncourt (not one!) has ever embraced Grants Pass’s sweeping \nholding  that  the  Eighth  Amendment  prohibits  the \nenforcement  of  public-camping  restrictions  (including \nbefore  any  punishment  is  imposed).    Other  circuits  to \nconsider the issue have uniformly upheld such laws against \nEighth Amendment challenges.  See Joel v. City of Orlando, \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 125 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    125 \n232 F.3d 1353, 1356, 1361-62 (11th Cir. 2000) (upholding \npublic-camping proscription because “[a] distinction exists \nbetween applying criminal laws to punish conduct, which is \nconstitutionally permissible, and applying them to punish \nstatus, which is not”); see also Johnson v. City of Dallas, 61 \nF.3d 442, 443-45, n.5 (5th Cir. 1995) (rejecting challenge to \npublic-camping  proscription  because  the  prohibition  on \ncruel  and  unusual  punishments  is  applicable  only  after \nprosecution and conviction, and none of the challengers had \nbeen  “convicted  of  violating  the  sleeping  in  public \nordinance” (relying on Ingraham, 430 U.S. at 664)).  And no \nstate  supreme  court  has  reached  the  same  result  as  our \naberrant decision here.  See Tobe v. City of Santa Ana, 892 \nP.2d 1145, 1166 (Cal. 1995) (upholding public-camping \nregulation because the “ordinance permits punishment for \nproscribed conduct, not punishment for status”); Allen v. \nCity  of  Sacramento,  234  Cal.  App.  4th  41,  60  (2015) \n(upholding  public-camping  bar  because  “the  Eighth \nAmendment does not prohibit the punishment of acts,” and \nthe “ordinance punishes the act[] of [illegal] camping, … not \nhomelessness”).    No  defender  of  Grants  Pass’s \njurisprudence has provided a compelling response to these \ndecisions, see Boise, 920 F.3d at 617 n.9 (attempting to \nreconcile  Boise  with  Joel’s  alternative  rationale,  but \ndeclining to do much else); Grants Pass, 50 F.4th 787 (not \neven attempting this much)—let alone a federal appellate or \nstate supreme court case that has ever reached Grants Pass’s \nresult.  While Grants Pass has not been replicated elsewhere, \naside from a smattering of trial-level dispositions, a decision \nthat stands so far out of step with so many other courts is one \nthat cries out for correction. \n2 \nThe second set of conflicts—which relates to Grants \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 126 of 155\n126  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nPass’s rationale—is similarly troublesome.  Our approach to \nthe Eighth Amendment in this area conflicts with decisions \nfrom the First Circuit, Fourth Circuit, and Seventh Circuit, \nwhich  embrace  several  competing  tests  for  determining \nwhether  the  Eighth  Amendment  immunizes  involuntary \nconduct.  At least two other circuits—the First Circuit and \nthe Seventh Circuit—have flatly rejected the Grants Pass \nprinciple that purportedly “involuntary” conduct is exempt \nfrom criminal liability under the Eighth Amendment, or that \nJustice White’s lone concurrence in Powell provides the \nbinding opinion that compels such exemptions.  See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Sirois, 898 F.3d 134, 137-38 (1st Cir. 2018); \nUnited States v. Stenson, 475 F. App’x 630, 631 (7th Cir. \n2012) (citing United States v. Black, 116 F.3d 198, 200-01 \n(7th Cir. 1997)); see also supra (collecting cases rejecting \nGrants Pass’s reading of Robinson, Powell, and Ingraham).  \nAnd  the  Fourth  Circuit—the  only  circuit  that  embraces \nanything like Grants Pass’s approach—provides, at best, \nonly  mixed  support  because  even  though  it  held  that \ninvoluntary conduct may be exempt based on dicta in Justice \nWhite’s lone concurrence, it limited its holding to laws that \n“singled”  individuals  “out  for  special  punishment  for \notherwise lawful conduct that is compelled by their illness.”  \nManning, 930 F.3d at 281 n.14.  Our Circuit is, therefore, \nlocked in a deep and varied intercircuit split over how to read \nthe Eighth Amendment in light of Robinson and Powell—\nand, as explained, we are the only federal court of appeals to \nhave  discovered  a  personal  constitutional  ‘right’  for \nindividuals  to  encamp  on  public  property  (including \nsidewalks)  in  violation  of  traditional  health,  safety,  and \nwelfare laws, a result that no other federal circuit or state \nsupreme  court  in  the  country  has  been  bold  enough  to \nreplicate. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 127 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    127 \nB \nGrants  Pass  also  presents  a  question  of  exceptional \npractical  and  institutional  importance.    The  immodest \napproach to the Eighth Amendment that it embraces is both \ntroubling and dangerous.  It undermines the power of state \nand local governments to address the homelessness crisis.  \nAnd  it  arrogates  to  federal  judges  authority  that  the \nConstitution reserves elsewhere.  We should have granted \nrehearing en banc to stop the damage already being worked \nby Boise and to stave off the mischiefs that Grants Pass is \nsure to worsen.  It is regrettable that our Circuit has declined \nto grapple with the consequences of our mistakes. \n1 \nThe practical consequences should have been reason \nenough to reconsider our jurisprudential experiment before \nit did any more harm to our communities—and before its \ndangers  were  exacerbated  by  Grants  Pass.    No  one \nreasonably doubts that our existing precedent in Boise has \ncreated grave and troubling consequences for the state and \nlocal communities within our jurisdiction.   And no one \nmeaningfully  contests  that  these  harms  will  be  greatly \nworsened by the doctrinal innovations introduced by Grants \nPass.  One need only walk through our neighborhoods—\nthrough the Tenderloin (San Francisco) or Skid Row (Los \nAngeles)—to know that our communities are fast coming \nundone.  Tents crowding out sidewalks, needles flooding \nparks,  and  rubbish  (and  worse)  marring  public  squares \nreflect a threat to the public welfare that should not be taken \nlightly.  Nor do such troubling blights mark an area where \nwe should be eager to throw caution to the wind and to \nembrace  judicial  adventurism  so  far  removed  from  the \nguardrails set by the Constitution’s text and the Supreme \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 128 of 155\n128  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nCourt’s precedents. \nUnfortunately, the “Hobson’s choice” imposed by our \nCircuit  effectively  requires  state  and  local  officials  to \n“abandon enforcement of a host of laws regulating public \nhealth and safety,” Boise, 920 F.3d at 594 (M. Smith, J., \ndissental)—and,  if  today’s  decision  is  any  guide,  our \nprecedents will readily be wielded effectively to require \njurisdictions throughout our Circuit to surrender the use of \nmany  of  their  public  spaces  (including  sidewalks)  to \nhomeless encampments.  It is easy enough for us, behind \nmarble walls and sealed doors, to dismiss the consequences \nof our decisions.  But for those who call these communities \nhome—who must live by the criminal violence, narcotics \nactivity, and dangerous diseases that plague the homeless \nencampments  buttressed  by  our  decisions—the \nconsequences of our judicial arrogation are harder to accept. \n2 \nIn addition to the practical harms that our jurisprudence \ncreates for our communities, we also should have ended the \njurisprudential mistake embraced by Grants Pass as quickly \nas possible because it “visit[s] structural and institutional \ndamage in so many respects.”  Manning, 930 F.3d at 305 \n(Wilkinson,  J.,  dissenting).    In  particular,  the  doctrine \nembraced by Grants Pass puts “judges in policymaking roles \nreserved largely for legislatures and states.”  Id. at 297.  It \nerodes “the states’ role as separate sovereigns entrusted to \ndefine  the  criminal  law  within  their  own  borders,”  and \n“pushes the Eighth Amendment as a catch-all corrective” for \nsocial  ills  identified  by  inexpert  and  unelected  judicial \nofficers.  Id.  Under our federal system, state and local \nleaders—not distant federal judges—are primarily entrusted \nwith the power and duty to protect the common welfare of \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 129 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    129 \nour towns, cities, and neighborhoods, and to ensure that our \nstreets, squares, and sidewalks remain clean and safe.  See \nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 561 n.3 (1995).  The \nreason for such “legislative responsibility over criminal law \nis fundamental: the criminal law exists to protect the safety \nof citizens, and ensuring the safety of the people is one of \nthose  things  that  popular  government  exists  to  do.”  \nManning,  930  F.3d  at  297  (Wilkinson,  J.,  dissenting).  \nUnfortunately,  this  has  not  swayed  our  Court—with \nconsequences that will sweep well past the troubles visited \nupon the City of Boise and the City of Grants Pass. \nIV \nGrants Pass is a regrettable mistake that entrenches and \nexpands  upon  previous  deeply  damaging  jurisprudence.  \nWhile I do not doubt the good faith of my colleagues, it is \nhard to imagine a jurisprudence that combines so little regard \nfor the sacred words of the Constitution, with so much \ndisregard  for  the  state  and  local  authorities  that  our \nconstitutional system entrusts as the primary protectors of \nthe health, safety, and welfare of our communities.  Our \njurisprudence  here  is  flawed—in  conflict  with  the  text, \nhistory, and tradition of the Eighth Amendment, and the \nprecedents of the Supreme Court.  And it splits from other \ncircuits on a question of exceptional importance, working \ngreat violence to our constitutional structure and threatening \ndire consequences for communities within our jurisdiction.  \nIt is most regrettable that our Court has failed to rehear this \ncase en banc. \n   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 130 of 155\n130  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nGRABER, Senior Circuit Judge, respecting the denial of \nrehearing en banc: \n \nThe constitutional limits on a municipality’s ability to \naddress the issue of homelessness present an exceptionally \nimportant  and  complex  topic.    I  appreciate  the  many \nthoughtful  views  expressed  by  my  colleagues.    I  write \nseparately to offer a middle ground. \nWhether or not the result is dictated by Powell v. Texas, \n392  U.S.  514  (1968),  the  Eighth  Amendment  almost \ncertainly  prohibits  criminal  punishment  of  persons  who \nengage in truly involuntary actions such as sleeping.  I thus \nagree with the underlying legal premise of the decisions in \nJohnson v. City of Grants Pass, 50 F.4th 787 (9th Cir. 2022), \nand Martin v. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584 (9th Cir. 2019).  \nEighth Amendment protection also extends to individualized \ninjunctive relief, such as precluding a municipality from \nenforcing a particular criminal provision against a specific \nperson, if past actions by the municipality warrant such \nequitable  relief.    Our  opinion  in  Martin,  though \ncontroversial,  reached  a  reasonable  result,  particularly \nbecause  Martin  emphasized  the  “narrow”  nature  of  its \nholding.  920 F.3d at 617.  I did not join, and did not agree \nwith, the dissents from denial of rehearing en banc in Martin. \nIn my view, though, the extension of Martin to classwide \nrelief, enjoining civil statutes that may eventually lead to \ncriminal  violations  but  have  never  resulted  in  criminal \nconvictions for any named plaintiff, is a step too far from the \nindividualized  inquiries  inherent  both  in  the  Eighth \nAmendment context and in the context of injunctive relief.  \nA  key  part  of  Johnson’s  reasoning  begins  with  the \nobservation that civil citations could lead to a civil park-\nexclusion order which, in turn, could lead to a prosecution \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 131 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    131 \nfor criminal trespass (but which never has for the named \nplaintiffs).1  Johnson, 50 F.4th at 807–08.  The opinion then \nconcludes  that,  because  the  Eighth  Amendment  would \nprohibit that ultimate prosecution, it also must prohibit the \ncivil citations.  Id.  I disagree with that double leap in logic.  \nEven  assuming  that  classwide  injunctive  relief  were \navailable against a prosecution for criminal trespass, the \nEighth Amendment does not prohibit all civil remedies that \ncould, in theory, lead to such a prosecution.  In this way, \nJohnson  unjustifiably  expands  the  reach  of  the  Eighth \nAmendment. \nThe  challenges  faced  by  individuals  experiencing \nhomelessness  are  severe.    And  the  challenges  that  face \nmunicipalities are daunting.  When called upon, we have an \nobligation to ensure that a municipality’s efforts to provide \nfor  the  common  health  and  safety  do  not  violate  the \nConstitution.  I agree with the basic legal premise that the \nEighth Amendment protects against criminal prosecution of \nthe involuntary act of sleeping, but the injunctive relief in \nthis case goes too far.  Moreover, given the widespread \nnature of the homelessness crisis in our jurisdiction, it is \n \n1 The amended opinion refers to Debra Blake as “a named plaintiff,” and \nthe amended opinion states that she was convicted of “Criminal Trespass \non City Property.”  Amended Op. at 28 n.13.  Blake unfortunately died.  \nAs the opinion elsewhere recognizes, Johnson, 50 F.4th at 800–02, she \nis no longer a named plaintiff.  Moreover, Blake’s “conviction” is doubly \ninapt here.  First, despite the name of the citation, the conviction was for \na violation, not a crime.  Second, Blake was cited for being in a closed \npark, not for violating any of the civil statutes challenged here.  The crux \nof the opinion’s analysis is that a civil citation could lead to a criminal \nmisdemeanor conviction under Oregon Revised Statute section 164.245.  \nJohnson, 50 F.4th at 807.  No evidence in the record suggests that the \ncivil statutes relevant here have caused Blake or any named plaintiff to \nbe convicted of that crime. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 132 of 155\n132  JOHNSON V.

What is more, as Judge O’Scannlain \nalso  explains,  Martin  violates  Supreme  Court  precedent \nregarding what constitutes binding precedent.  The Marks \nrule  instructs  in  no  uncertain  terms  that,  “[w]hen  a \nfragmented [Supreme] Court decides a case and no single \nrationale  explaining  the  result  enjoys  the  assent  of  five \nJustices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that \nposition taken by those Members who concurred in the \njudgments on the narrowest grounds.”  Marks v. United \nStates, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977) (cleaned up) (emphasis \nadded).    Yet  Martin  counted  to  five  votes  for  its \nunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment by including the \nfour votes of the Powell dissenters.  Martin, 920 F.3d at 616 \n(“The four dissenting Justices adopted a position consistent \nwith that taken by Justice White [in his concurrence] . . . .”).  \nWhen the Marks rule is properly applied to Powell v. Texas, \n392 U.S. 514 (1968), it produces the holding that Powell’s \n“conviction  was  constitutional  because  it  involved  the \ncommission of an act.  Nothing more, nothing less.”  Martin, \n920 F.3d at 591 (M. Smith, J., dissenting from denial of \nrehearing en banc); see also Grants Pass, 50 F.4th at 830 \n(Collins, J., dissenting) (“Under a correct application of \nMarks, the holding of Powell is that there is no constitutional \nobstacle to punishing conduct that has not been shown to be \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 138 of 155\n138  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \ninvoluntary, and the converse question of what rule applies \nwhen the conduct has been shown to be involuntary was left \nopen.”).  Put differently: When the Marks rule is properly \napplied, Martin cannot hide behind Powell and insist that \nSupreme  Court  precedent  “compels  the  conclusion”  it \nreached.  Martin, 920 F.3d at 616.   \nMartin therefore had the burden to affirmatively justify \nits rule—that a “state may not criminalize conduct that is an \nunavoidable  consequence”  of  a  person’s  status—as \nconsistent with the Eighth Amendment.  Id. at 617 (cleaned \nup).  But neither Martin nor the majority in this case even \nattempts  to  make  that  showing,  including  rebutting  the \nnumber of reasons Justice Thurgood Marshall and the other \nJustices in the Powell plurality thought an unavoidable-\nconsequence-of-status  rule  would  be  both  improper  and \nunworkable.  We are left completely in the dark as to why, \nfor example, the Martin panel and Grants Pass majority \napparently thought:  \n•  The Powell plurality was wrong to interpret Robinson \nv.  California,  370  U.S.  660  (1962)  as  a  ban  on \n“punish[ing]  a  mere  status”  and  nothing  more.  \nPowell, 392 U.S. at 532 (plurality) (Marshall, J.). \n•  The Powell plurality was wrong to be concerned that \nan  unavoidable-consequence-of-status  rule  would \nlack “any limiting principle.”  Id. at 533. \n•  The  Powell  plurality  was  wrong  to  think  that  a \nconstitutionalized  unavoidable-consequence  rule \nwould improperly override the ability of states to \ndevelop  “[t]he  doctrines  of  actus  reus,  mens  rea, \ninsanity, mistake, justification, and duress” to resolve \nas they think best “the tension between the evolving \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 139 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    139 \naims  of  the  criminal  law  and  changing  religious, \nmoral, philosophical, and medical views of the nature \nof man.”  Id. at 535–36. \n•  The  Powell  plurality  incorrectly  characterized  an \nunavoidable-consequence  rule  as  conferring  upon \nunelected federal judges the impossible task of being \n“the ultimate arbiter[s] of the standards of criminal \nresponsibility, in diverse areas of the criminal law, \nthroughout the country.”  Id. at 533.  \n•  The  punishment  flowing  from  a  public-camping \nprosecution (or even just a civil citation) constitutes \nthe “exceedingly rare” instance—outside the context \nof  capital  punishment  and  juvenile  life  without \nparole—where a particular sentence may violate the \nEighth Amendment.  Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U.S. 263, \n272 (1980); see Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. 460, \n469–70  (2012)  (summarizing  proportionality  case \nlaw). \nJudges Gould and Silver are correct to note that the Powell \nplurality is, after all, just a plurality.  But these questions, \nand others, still warranted a response—one would hope that \na lower court, when fashioning a novel constitutional rule, \nwould at least grapple with the reasons four Supreme Court \nJustices expressly chose to reject the very same rule.  The \ndistrict courts tasked with applying Martin/Grants Pass, the \nlocal governments placed in a straitjacket by these decisions, \nand the residents of our circuit who now must live with the \nconsequences  all  deserved  better  than  the  half-reasoned \ndecisions they received from our court. \nII. \nMoreover, even if one assumes arguendo that the Eighth \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 140 of 155\n140  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nAmendment supports an unavoidable-consequence-of-status \nprinciple, Grants Pass’s homelessness-specific analysis has \nnothing to do with that principle.  One would reasonably \nassume  that  Grants  Pass  implemented  Martin’s  general \nEighth  Amendment  principle  by  mandating  that  courts \nconduct an individualized inquiry: whether public camping \nby  the  individual  plaintiffs  before  the  court  is  an \n“unavoidable  consequence”  of  their  status  as  homeless \npersons—inquiring, for example, into whether the plaintiffs \ndeclined offers of temporary housing.9  But one would be \nmistaken  in  that  assumption.    Instead  of  calling  for  an \nindividualized inquiry, the original Grants Pass majority \nopinion candidly set forth a crude jurisdiction-wide inquiry: \n“The formula established in Martin is that the government \ncannot prosecute homeless people for sleeping in public if \nthere is  a  greater  number  of  homeless  individuals  in  a \njurisdiction than the number of available shelter spaces.”  \nGrants Pass, 50 F.4th at 795 (cleaned up); see id. at. 823–28 \n(Collins, J., dissenting) (arguing that Martin provides at \nmost  a  “case-specific,”  as-applied  claim).    The  original \n \n9 One short-term housing site in Los Angeles sits nearly empty despite \nproximity to a large homeless camp, and one of the new Los Angeles \nmayor’s  marquee  offers  of  short-term  housing  had  a  below-50% \nacceptance rate.

CITY OF GRANTS PASS    141 \nmajority opinion made clear that the beds-versus-population \n“formula” is all that matters: Because the plaintiffs in this \ncase established a shelter-beds deficit, they are deemed—no \nmatter  their  personal  situations—involuntarily  homeless, \nand the city effectively cannot enforce its ordinances against \nany homeless person. \nThe majority has now amended its opinion to remove \nthis “formula” language, and the opinion’s body now quotes \nMartin’s statement that individuals are outside the purview \nof its holding if they “have access to adequate temporary \nshelter, whether because they have the means to pay for it or \nbecause it is realistically available to them for free, but [they] \nchoose not to use it.”  Martin, 920 F.3d at 617 n.8.  But I fear \nthat this amendment, in reality, does little to change the \nsubstance of Grants Pass and instead simply obscures what \nGrants Pass holds.   \nNotably, the amendment is not accompanied by any \ndownstream changes to the majority’s application of its rule \nto the facts or its ultimate conclusion.  So, the “formula” \nlanguage  may  be  gone,  but  the  approach  that  language \nforthrightly described remains embedded in the opinion.  \nGrants Pass still holds that “[t]here, of course, exists no law \nor rule requiring a homeless person” to “provide the court an \naccounting of her finances and employment history” before \nbeing deemed “involuntarily homeless.”  50 F.4th at 811.  It \nstill  equates  a  shelter-beds  deficit  with  jurisdiction-wide \ninvoluntariness:  “[T]he  number  of  homeless  persons \noutnumber the available beds.  In other words, homeless \npersons have nowhere to shelter and sleep in the City . . . .”  \nId. at 792; see also id. at 797 (describing the district court \ndecision, which it largely affirms, as holding “that, based on \nthe unavailability of shelter beds, the City’s enforcement of \nits anti-camping and anti-sleeping ordinances violated the \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 142 of 155\n142  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nCruel and Unusual Punishment Clause”).  And it still treats \na  shelter-beds  deficit,  when  combined  with  conclusory \nallegations of involuntariness, as sufficient for an individual \nto show that he or she is involuntarily homeless: “Gloria \nJohnson  has  adequately  demonstrated  that  there  is  no \navailable shelter in Grants Pass and that she is involuntarily \nhomeless.”  Id. at 811. \nThe  amendment  thus  places  district  courts  in  an \nimpossible position.  They will not be able to reconcile \nGrants Pass’s disparate strands—because they cannot be \nreconciled.  District courts will have to choose between \nfollowing what Grants Pass now says in one place (there \nmust  be  a  meaningful  voluntariness  inquiry)  and  what \nGrants Pass says and does in another place (a shelter-beds \ndeficit and conclusory allegations are all one needs). \nIndeed,  Grants  Pass’s  class-certification  analysis \nconfirms that its nod to the unavoidable-consequence or \ninvoluntarily-homeless limitation is just window dressing—\nand that the amendment to the opinion is one of form, not \nsubstance.  As Judge Collins explained, if Martin’s public-\ncamping ban is truly limited to those who are involuntarily \nhomeless,  then  Martin-type  cases  cannot  possibly  be \nlitigated on a class-wide basis.  Grants Pass, 50 F.4th at 823–\n28 (Collins, J., dissenting).  To be certified, a putative class \nmust  satisfy  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  23’s \ncommonality requirement, among others.  “What matters” \nfor  purposes  of  that  requirement  “is  not  the  raising  of \ncommon  questions—even  in  droves—but  rather,  the \ncapacity of a class-wide proceeding to generate common \nanswers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.”  Wal-\nMart  Stores,  Inc.  v.  Dukes,  564  U.S.  338,  350  (2011) \n(cleaned up).  A court must be able to “resolve an issue that \nis central to the validity of each one of the [class members’] \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 143 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    143 \nclaims in one stroke.”  Id.  Whether a public-camping ban is \nunconstitutional as applied to a homeless plaintiff depends \n(it would seem) on whether that plaintiff is “involuntarily \nhomeless,” which in turn depends on a host of individualized \nfactors:  Did  they  decline  the  city’s  offer  of  temporary \nhousing?  Do they otherwise “have the means to pay” for \ntemporary housing?  Were there areas of the city where they \ncould publicly camp without citation in light of the city’s \nenforcement policies?  It blinks reality to say that the district \ncourt could, “in one stroke,” resolve the constitutionality of \nthe public-camping ban as applied to each of the “at least \naround 50” class members here.  Grants Pass, 50 F.4th at \n811. \nThe majority, for what it is worth, tries to backdoor \ninvoluntariness into its Rule 23 analysis.  But its argument is \none that Philosophy 101 professors should consider using as \ntheir go-to example of circular reasoning: The class satisfies \nRule  23’s  commonality  requirement  because  the  class \nmembers’  claims  all  present  the  question  of  whether \nenforcement  of  public-camping  ordinances  against \n“involuntarily  homeless  individuals  violates  the  Eighth \nAmendment.”  Id. at 804–05 n.22.  Answering that question \nresolves the claims of each class member “in one stroke” \nbecause “[p]ursuant to the class definition, the class includes \nonly  involuntarily  homeless  persons.”    Id.  at  804–05 \n(citation omitted).  The basis for that premise?  “[T]he record \nestablishes”  it.    Id.  at  804–05  n.22.    As  Judge  Collins \nexplained, there is “no authority for this audacious bootstrap \nargument.”  Id. at 827 (Collins, J., dissenting).  By wholly \ncollapsing the merits into the class definition, the majority \nopinion certified an impermissible “fail safe” class.  Id. \n(quoting Olean Wholesale Grocery Coop. v. Bumble Bee \nFoods, 31 F.4th 651, 670 n.14 (9th Cir. 2022) (en banc)). \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 144 of 155\n144  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nIn response to this criticism, Judges Gould and Silver \nsuggest that Grants Pass’s class-certification analysis is run \nof the mill—analogizing it to our court’s recent approval of \na  district  court’s  certification  of  a  class  of  California \nresidents who worked for a certain employer.  See Bernstein \nv. Virgin Am., Inc., 3 F.4th 1127, 1134 (9th Cir. 2021).  It is \ntelling  that  Judges  Gould  and  Silver  think  involuntary \nhomelessness  is  as  easily  determined  as  residency  and \nemployment  history—another  piece  of  evidence  that \nMartin’s involuntariness component has faded away or been \ncollapsed  into  the  shelter-beds  inquiry.    More \nfundamentally, their analogy overlooks that the Bernstein \nclass definition did not swallow the merits inquiry in the \nmanner that the class definition does here.  Separate from \nclass membership (based on residency and employment), the \nBernstein plaintiffs still had to make a merits showing that \nthe defendant violated California labor laws by, among other \nthings, failing to pay a minimum wage and to pay for all \nhours worked.  See id. at 1133.  Here, by contrast, the game \nis essentially over as soon as the class is certified.  The class \n(purportedly)  consists  only  of  involuntarily  homeless \npeople, and application of the challenged ordinances to the \nclass  members  is  unconstitutional  (under  our  flawed \nprecedent)  because  the  class  members  are  involuntarily \nhomeless. \nViewing the majority’s class-certification analysis, there \nare only two possible conclusions: Either (1) the majority \nerred in certifying the class despite a lack of commonality; \nor (2) the majority read “involuntarily” out of Martin’s \npurported involuntarily-homeless rule.  Either conclusion \npoints to profound error that we should have used the en \nbanc process to correct. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 145 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    145 \nIII. \nJudges Gould and Silver insist that Martin and Grants \nPass apply only in “exceptionally narrow situation[s]” and \nthat critics of these decisions have resorted to “rhetorical \nexaggerations.”  But whose word should one take: that of a \npanel majority defending its own work or that of several \ndistrict court judges who have no dog in this fight and are \nsimply trying to understand and apply the law as we have \nhanded it down to them?  Several district court decisions \nhave  understood  Martin  and  now  Grants  Pass  to  run \nroughshod  over  normal  procedural  rules  and  past  any \nsubstantive  limiting  principles.    As  a  result,  local \ngovernments are hard-pressed to find any way to regulate the \nadverse health and safety effects of homeless encampments \nwithout running afoul of our court’s case law—or, at a \nminimum, being saddled with litigation costs.  If one picks \nup a map of the western United States and points to a city \nthat appears on it, there is a good chance that city has already \nfaced a lawsuit in the few short years since our court initiated \nits Martin experiment.  Without expressing any view on how \nother district courts or panels of our court should decide \nthese or similar cases pursuant to our existing precedent, I \noffer a few examples of the judicial adventurism our case \nlaw has already produced: \n1.  San Francisco responded conscientiously to Martin.  \nThe police department promulgated an enforcement bulletin \nintended to comply with that case’s dictates while retaining \nflexibility to clear some of the city’s worst encampments.  \nSee Coal. on Homelessness v. City & Cnty. of San Francisco, \nNo. 22-cv-05502-DMR, 2022 WL 17905114, at *3–7 (N.D. \nCal. Dec. 23, 2022).  Pursuant to the bulletin, an officer \ncannot arrest a homeless person for a set of enumerated \noffenses unless SFPD first “secure[s] appropriate shelter.”  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 146 of 155\n146  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nId. at *4 (emphasis omitted).   SFPD policy requires officers \nto work with other city agencies to implement a multi-step \nprocess: The city posts a notice that an encampment clearing \nwill  occur  on  a  particular  date;  city  workers  perform \noutreach  at  the  encampment  the  weekend  before  the \nclearing; and city workers follow up at the encampment 24 \nto 72 hours before the clearing.  Id. at *5–7.  Only then can \nan encampment clearing take place.  To be sure, the record \non SFPD’s compliance with this policy was mixed. The \ndefendants  asserted  that  they  always  comply  with  the \npolicy—“conduct[ing]  regular  training[s]”  on  it,  setting \naside  beds  based  on  an  estimated  acceptance  rate,  and \nproviding  officers  with  the  means  to  check  shelter-bed \navailabilities.  Id. at *13–15, *23.  Some plaintiffs asserted \nthat they never received advance notice of encampment \nclearings or offers of housing.  Id. at *8–9.  Other plaintiffs \nasserted that SFPD sometimes complied with the policy and \n“acknowledge[d] receiving and/or accepting shelter offers at \n. . . encampment closures.”   Id. at *22; see also id. at *10–\n12.  The plaintiffs’ expert opined that San Francisco had a \nshelter-beds deficit but conceded that a “clear way to access \nshelter is via an encampment [closure] while under threat \nfrom law enforcement.”  Id. at *14. \nNonetheless, the court found the mixed record before it \nsufficient to issue a sweeping preliminary injunction.  The \ndistrict court repeatedly returned not to the facts of specific \nplaintiffs  in  specific  encampment  clearings  but  to  the \nconsideration at the center of Grants Pass: whether there is \na shelter-beds deficit.  See id. at *21 (“insufficient stock of \nshelter  beds”);  id.  *22  (“long-standing  shelter  bed \nshortfalls”); id. at *23 (“there are thousands more homeless \nindividuals . . . than there are available shelter beds”); id. at \n*27 (“shortfall of shelter beds”).  The court determined that \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 147 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    147 \nit “need not decide” how offers of housing, when actually \nmade, would impact the constitutionality of arrests or alter \nthe scope of an injunction.  See id. at *23–24.  The court \ninstead issued a broad, if ambiguous, injunction that appears \nto effectively prevent SFPD from enforcing five separate \nprohibitions against homeless persons in San Francisco “as \nlong as there are more homeless individuals . . . than there \nare shelter beds available.”  Id. at *28. \n2.  Phoenix suffered a similar fate.  Like San Francisco, \nit  adopted  a  policy  that  police  “officers  must  make \nindividualized assessments” before issuing citations against \nhomeless  persons  for  certain  offenses.    Fund  for \nEmpowerment v. City of Phoenix, No. CV-22-02041-PHX-\nGMS, 2022 WL 18213522, at *3 (D. Ariz. Dec. 16, 2022).  \nUnlike the San Francisco case, the district court cited no \nevidence in the record showing that Phoenix breached its \npolicy.  Still, the district court issued a sweeping injunction \nafter  conducting  a  merits  inquiry  that  focused  almost \nexclusively  on  the  Grants  Pass  beds-versus-population \ninquiry.  The district court noted that it was “not contested \nthat there are more unsheltered individuals than shelter beds \nin  Phoenix”  and  then  concluded  that  Phoenix’s  policy \n“present[s]  likely  unconstitutional  applications  especially \nwhen the unsheltered in the city outnumber the available bed \nspaces.”  Id.  The city’s enforcement policy—as a mere \n“statement of administrative policy”—was insufficient to \n“forestall the Plaintiffs’ ultimate likelihood of success on the \nmerits.”  Id. (quoting Martin, 920 F.3d at 607).  \n3.    Santa  Barbara  adopted  a  half-measure:  a \ngeographically- and time-limited ban against public sleeping \nthat applied only in the city’s downtown area.  Boring v. \nMurillo, No. CV-21-07305, 2022 WL 14740244, at *1 (C.D. \nCal. Aug. 11, 2022).  Despite the ordinance’s modest scope, \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 148 of 155\n148  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nthe district court still held that the plaintiffs stated a plausible \nclaim to relief pursuant to Martin and denied the city’s \nmotion to dismiss.  See id. at *5–6.    \n4.  Sacramento found itself subject to a lawsuit after \ntaking the innocuous step of removing a portable toilet from \ncity-owned property.  Mahoney v. City of Sacramento, No. \n2:20-cv-00258-KJM, 2020 WL 616302, at *1 (E.D. Cal. \nFeb. 10, 2020).  Though the court ultimately declined to \nissue a temporary restraining order because the plaintiffs’ \nclaims failed on factual grounds, it still interpreted Martin to \ncover  public  urination  and  defecation  prosecutions  and \nstated that “the City may not prosecute or otherwise penalize \nthe plaintiffs . . . for eliminating in public if there is no \nalternative to doing so.”  Id. at *3. \nJudges  Gould  and  Silver  argue  this  “brief  statement \nmade in the context of resolving an emergency motion is not \na solid foundation” on which to suggest that the enforcement \nof public defecation and urination laws may well be suspect \npursuant to our court’s precedent.  In their view, that is \nbecause  Martin  and  Grants  Pass  did  not  involve  a \n“challenge to any public urination or defecation ordinances.”  \nBut  our  decisions  are  not  good-for-one-ride-only  tickets \nforever bound to their specific facts; they serve as precedent \nto which parties analogize in related situations.  Martin \nattempted to limit its reach by explaining that sleep is a “life-\nsustaining activit[y].”  Martin, 920 F.3d at 617.  In their \nconcurrence,  Judges  Gould  and  Silver  offer  a  slightly \ndifferent version of that limiting principle—that sleep is an \n“identifiable  human  need[].”    But  “[w]hat  else  is  [an \nidentifiable  human  need]?    Surely  bodily  functions.”  \nMartin, 920 F.3d at 596 (M. Smith, J., dissenting from denial \nof rehearing en banc).  It is not a slippery-slope fallacy to \nnote a realistic consequence that flows directly from Martin \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 149 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    149 \nand Grants Pass’s reasoning.  Moreover, Judges Gould and \nSilver fail to recognize that something is fundamentally \namiss with our precedent if a city, even if it ultimately \nprevails, must first go to court before it can remove a toilet \nfrom property it owns. \n5.  Chico “constructed an outdoor temporary shelter \nfacility at the Chico Municipal Airport that accommodate[d] \nall 571 of the City’s homeless persons.”  Warren v. City of \nChico, No. 2:21-CV-00640-MCE, 2021 WL 2894648, at *3 \n(E.D. Cal. July 8, 2021).  But the district court cited stray \nlines in Martin in addition to Merriam-Webster’s definition \nof  “shelter,”  conducted  a  single  paragraph  of  analysis, \nconcluded  that  the  airport  shelter  was  not  Martin-type \nshelter, and subsequently enjoined Chico from enforcing its \nanti-camping laws  against “homeless persons in violation.”  \nId. at *3–4.   \nAs the district court itself recognized, this decision (as \nwell  as  the  others  above)  shows  that,  while  the  Martin \nanalysis may be “straight-forward . . . [as] to the facts of [a] \ncase,” the “practical ramifications for the community are \nmuch more complex” and the “concerns raised in the dissent \nfrom the denial of rehearing en banc appear to have come to \nfruition.”  Id. at *4 n.4 (citation omitted).  As I feared, our \ncase law has “prohibit[ed] local governments from fulfilling \ntheir duty to enforce an array of public health and safety \nlaws,” and the “[h]alting [of] enforcement of such laws” has \n“wreak[ed] havoc on our communities.”  Martin, 920 F.3d \nat 594 (M. Smith, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en \nbanc). \n* * * \nI respect the good intentions of my colleagues on the \nMartin panel and in the Grants Pass majority.  But Martin, \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 150 of 155\n150  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nparticularly now that it has been supercharged by Grants \nPass, has proven to be a runaway train that has derailed and \ndone substantial collateral damage to the governmental units \nin which it has been applied and those living therein.  These \ncases  use  a  misreading  of  Supreme  Court  precedent  to \nrequire  unelected  federal  judges—often  on  the  basis  of \nsloppy, mixed preliminary-injunction records—to act more \nlike homelessness policy czars than as Article III judges \napplying a discernible rule of law.  I respectfully dissent \nfrom our court’s decision not to rehear Grants Pass en banc. \n \n \nCOLLINS,  Circuit  Judge,  dissenting  from  the  denial  of \nrehearing en banc: \n \nIn my dissent as a member of the panel in this case, I \nexplained that: \n•  Martin v. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584 (9th Cir. 2019), \nis  a  “deeply  flawed”  decision  that  “seriously \nmisconstrued  the  Eighth  Amendment  and  the \nSupreme Court’s caselaw construing it”;  \n•  Even if Martin were correct in its Eighth Amendment \nholding, the panel majority’s decision in Johnson \n“greatly expands Martin’s holding” in a way that is \n“egregiously wrong”; and  \n•  The  panel  majority’s  decision  “make[s]  things \nworse”  by  “combin[ing]  its  gross  misreading  of \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 151 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    151 \nMartin with a flagrant disregard of settled class-\ncertification principles.” \nSee Johnson v. City of Grants Pass, 50 F.4th 787, 814 & n.1 \n(9th  Cir.  2022)  (Collins,  J.,  dissenting).    In  its  “joint \nstatement regarding denial of rehearing,” the panel majority \ntoday recycles many of the flawed arguments in its opinion.  \nI have already explained in my dissent why those arguments \nare wrong.  See id. at 823–31.  The statement of Judge \nO’Scannlain respecting the denial of rehearing en banc and \nParts I and II of Judge M. Smith’s dissent from the denial of \nrehearing en banc—which I join—further cogently explain \nthe multiple serious errors in the panel majority’s opinion.  I \nwill not repeat all of what has already been said, but I think \nthat two points are worth underscoring in response to the \npanel majority’s statement regarding the denial of rehearing. \nFirst,  the  panel  majority’s  statement  confirms  and \nillustrates the layers of self-contradiction that underlie its \nopinion in this case.   \nThe panel majority continues implausibly to insist that \nits  opinion  is  “strictly  limited  to  enforcement  of  the \nordinances against ‘involuntarily’ homeless persons,” which \nwould  suggest—as  Martin  itself  suggested—an \nindividualized case-specific inquiry.  See Panel Majority \nStatement at 94.  But the panel majority also continues to \ninsist  that  the  class  was  properly  certified  because  any \nindividualized  issues  concerning  involuntariness  were \nmoved  into  the  class  definition.    See  Panel  Majority \nStatement at 99–101.  As I have explained, that “artifice” \nignores the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23, because it “rel[ies] on a fail-safe class definition that \nimproperly subsumes this crucial individualized merits issue \ninto the class definition.”  50  F.4th at 827 (Collins, J., \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 152 of 155\n152  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \ndissenting).  The panel majority tries to wave away the \nproblem as merely one of “individualized determinations to \nidentify class members,” arguing that what it did in this case \nis no different than asking whether, for example, a given \nclass member resides in a particular State or performs a \ngiven job for a company.  See Panel Majority Statement at \n101 (emphasis added).  But in sharp contrast to the simple \nfactual  inquiries  in  the  panel  majority’s  examples,  its \nstandard for “identifying” class members here—i.e., whether \na given plaintiff’s homelessness is involuntary under all of \nthe circumstances—is the central merits issue in the case \nunder a correct reading of Martin.  Thus, under the faulty \nclass action upheld by the panel majority, if a particular \nperson’s  individual  circumstances  confirm  that  his \nhomelessness is not “involuntary” in the sense that Martin \nrequires, then his Eighth Amendment claim under Martin \nfails on the merits—and he is then defined out of the class.  \nBut  if  his  homelessness  is  involuntary  under  Martin’s \nstandards, then (under that decision’s reading of the Eighth \nAmendment) his Martin claim is a winner—and he remains \nin the class.  The result is a classic fail-safe class: each “class \nmember either wins or, by virtue of losing, is defined out of \nthe class.”  Olean Wholesale Grocery Coop. v. Bumble Bee \nFoods, 31 F.4th 651, 669–70 n.14 (9th Cir. 2022) (en banc) \n(citation omitted).   \nUnderlying all of this is a fundamental inconsistency \nbetween  the  various  propositions  endorsed  by  the  panel \nmajority’s opinion.  As I stated in my panel dissent, “the \nmajority cannot have it both ways: either the class definition \nis co-extensive with Martin’s involuntariness concept (in \nwhich case the class is an improper fail-safe class) or the \nclass definition differs from the Martin standard (in which \ncase  Martin’s  individualized  inquiry  requires \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 153 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    153 \ndecertification).”    50  F.4th  at  827–28  (Collins,  J., \ndissenting).    Nothing  in  the  panel  majority’s  statement \nresolves  these  internal  contradictions,  which  plague  its \ndeeply flawed opinion. \nSecond, I cannot let pass without comment the panel \nmajority’s contention that a newly enacted Oregon statute \nregulating the application of local ordinances to homeless \nindividuals provides “yet another reason why it was wise to \nnot rehear” this case en banc.  See Panel Majority Statement \nat 112–13 n.7.  Even assuming that this statute will require \nthat  city  laws  such  as  those  challenged  here  must  be \n“objectively reasonable as to time, place and manner with \nregards to persons experiencing homelessness,” under “the \ntotality  of  the  circumstances,”  see  Or.  Rev.  Stat. \n§ 195.530(2),  (5),  the  removal  of  the  objectively \nunreasonable constitutional straitjacket wrongly imposed by \nMartin and Johnson would continue to alter the outcome of \nthis  case  and  would  also  greatly  improve  the  cogency, \ncoherence,  and  correctness  of  Eighth  Amendment \njurisprudence in this circuit.  The panel majority is quite \nwrong in suggesting that this statute provides any grounds \nfor looking the other way and allowing Martin’s cancer on \nour jurisprudence to continue to metastasize. \nI reiterate what I said in the conclusion of my panel \ndissent, which is that both Martin and Johnson “should be \noverturned or overruled at the earliest opportunity, either by \nthis court sitting en banc or by the U.S. Supreme Court.”  50 \nF.4th at 831 (Collins, J., dissenting).  By denying rehearing \nen banc today, we have regrettably failed to overrule Martin \nand Johnson.  I again emphatically dissent. \n \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 154 of 155\n154  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nBRESS, Circuit Judge, joined by CALLAHAN, M. SMITH, \nIKUTA, BENNETT, R. NELSON, MILLER, BADE, LEE, \nFORREST, BUMATAY, and VANDYKE, Circuit Judges, \ndissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc: \n \nLooking  out  the  windows  of  the  Ninth  Circuit’s \ncourthouse in San Francisco, one sees the most difficult \nproblems  plaguing  big-city  America  on  display.  \nHomelessness, drug addiction, barely concealed narcotics \ndealing, severe mental health impairment, the post-COVID \nhollowing out of our business districts.  These problems of \ndisrespect for the law, human suffering, and urban decline \nwould seem connected, the result of a complex interaction of \nforces that defies any easy solution. \nBut on top of everything that our localities must now \ncontend with, our court has injected itself into the mix by \ndeploying the Eighth Amendment to impose sharp limits on \nwhat local governments can do about the pressing problem \nof homelessness—a problem now so often related to every \nother in our great cities.  With no mooring in the text of the \nConstitution, our history and traditions, or the precedent of \nthe Supreme Court, we have taken our national founding \ndocument and used it to enact judge-made rules governing \nwho can sit and sleep where, rules whose ill effects are felt \nnot merely by the States, and not merely by our cities, but \nblock by block, building by building, doorway by doorway.  \nThe  antecedent  question  we  must  always  ask  when \ninterpreting the Constitution is whether a matter has been \nentrusted, in the first instance, to the courts or to the people.  \nThe answer to that question here is clear: we must allow local \nleaders—and the people who elect them—the latitude to \naddress on the ground the distinctly local features of the \npresent  crisis  of  homelessness  and  lack  of  affordable \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 155 of 155\n  JOHNSON V.

The expanding \nconstitutional common law our court is fashioning in this \narea  adds  enormous  and  unjustified  complication  to  an \nalready extremely complicated set of circumstances. \nNot  every  challenge  we  face  is  constitutional  in \ncharacter.  Not every problem in our country has a legal \nanswer  that  judges  can  provide.    This  is  one  of  those \nsituations.  The decision in Johnson v.

I respectfully dissent from the denial of rehearing \nen banc. ",

It has \nbeen prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 3 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    3 \npermanent  injunction  in  favor  of  plaintiffs;  affirmed \ncertification pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), of a class \nof “involuntary homeless” persons; and remanded. \nThe five municipal ordinances, described as an “anti-\nsleeping”  ordinance,  two  “anti-camping”  ordinances,  a \n“park exclusion” ordinance, and a “park exclusion appeals” \nordinance, result in civil fines up to several hundred dollars \nper violation.  Persons found to violate ordinances multiple \ntimes could be barred from all City property.  If a homeless \nperson is found on City property after receiving an exclusion \norder, they are subject to criminal prosecution for trespass.     \nThe panel stated that this court’s decision in Martin v. \nCity of Boise, 902 F.3d 1031 (9th Cir. 2018), which held that \n“the Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of criminal \npenalties for sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public \nproperty  for  homeless  individuals  who  cannot  obtain \nshelter”  served  as  the  backdrop  for  this  entire \nlitigation.  Pursuant to Martin, it is an Eight Amendment \nviolation  to  criminally  punish  involuntarily  homeless \npersons for sleeping in public if there are no other public \nareas or appropriate shelters where those individuals can \nsleep.  \nThe panel first rejected the City’s argument that the \ndistrict court lacked jurisdiction because plaintiffs’ claims \nwere moot or because plaintiffs failed to identify any relief \nthat was within a federal court’s power to redress.  The panel \nheld  that  there  was  abundant  evidence  in  the  record \nestablishing that homeless persons were injured by the City’s \nenforcement actions in the past and it was undisputed that \nenforcements have continued. The panel further held that the \nrelief sought by plaintiffs, enjoining enforcement of a few \nmunicipal  ordinances  aimed  at  involuntary  homeless \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 4 of 155\n4  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \npersons, was redressable within the limits of Article III.  The \ndeath of class representative Debra Blake while the matter \nwas on appeal did not moot the class’s claims as to all \nchallenged  ordinances  except  possibly  the  anti-sleeping \nordinance.  The panel vacated the summary judgment as to \nthat ordinance and remanded to allow the district court the \nopportunity to substitute a class representative in Blake’s \nstead.  The remaining class representatives had standing to \nchallenge the park exclusion, criminal trespass and anti-\ncamping ordinances.   \nThe panel held that, based on the record in this case, the \ndistrict court did not err by finding plaintiffs satisfied the \nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) such that a class could \nbe  certified  under  Rule  23(b)(2).   Although  the  City \nappeared to suggest that Martin’s need for an individualized \ninquiry  of  each  alleged  involuntary  homeless  person’s \naccess  to  shelter  defeated  numerosity,  commonality  and \ntypicality, the panel held that nothing in Martin precluded \nclass actions.  The panel held that the district court did not \nabuse  its  discretion  in  concluding  the  numerosity \nrequirement was met; that plaintiffs’ claims presented at \nleast one question and answer common to the class; and that \nthe class representatives’ claims and defenses were typical \nof the class in that they were homeless persons who claimed \nthat the City could not enforce the challenged ordinances \nagainst them when they have no shelter. \nAddressing the merits, the panel affirmed the district \ncourt’s  ruling  that  the  City  of  Grants  Pass  could  not, \nconsistent with the Eighth Amendment, enforce its anti-\ncamping ordinances against homeless persons for the mere \nact of sleeping outside with rudimentary protection from the \nelements, or for sleeping in their car at night, when there was \nno other place in the City for them to go.  The panel held that \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 5 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    5 \nMartin applied to civil citations where, as here, the civil and \ncriminal punishments were closely intertwined.   \nThere was no need to resolve whether the fines imposed \nunder  the  anti-sleeping  and  anti-camping  ordinances \nviolated the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on excessive \nfines because the permanent injunction would result in no \nclass member being fined for engaging in such protected \nactivity.  Finally, the panel held that it was unnecessary to \ndecide whether plaintiffs properly pled their procedural due \nprocess challenge to the park exclusion appeals ordinance \nbecause subsequent to the district court’s order, the City \namended the ordinance.   \nThe panel directed the district court on remand to narrow \nits  injunction  to  enjoin  only  those  portions  of  the  anti-\ncamping ordinances that prohibited conduct protected by \nMartin and this opinion.  In particular, the district court \nshould narrow its injunction to the anti-camping ordinances \nand enjoin enforcement of those ordinances only against \ninvoluntarily  homeless  persons  for  engaging  in  conduct \nnecessary to protect themselves from the elements when \nthere was no shelter space available.   \nDissenting, Judge Collins stated that Martin seriously \nmisconstrued  the  Eighth  Amendment  and  the  Supreme \nCourt’s caselaw construing it, but even assuming that Martin \nremains good law, today’s decision—which both misreads \nand  greatly  expands  Martin’s  holding—is  egregiously \nwrong. Although the majority’s phrasing pays lip service to \nthe fact that the persons at issue must be “involuntarily \nhomeless,” the majority also explicitly rejects the City’s \ncontention that the holding of Martin can only be applied \nafter an individualized inquiry of each alleged involuntary \nhomeless person’s access to shelter.  The net result, for class \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 6 of 155\n6  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \ncertification purposes, is that any issue of individualized \ninvoluntariness is set aside and Martin is thereby reduced to \na simplistic formula to be resolved on a classwide basis—\ninto  whether  the  number  of  homeless  persons  in  the \njurisdiction  exceeds  the  number  of  available  shelter \nbeds.  The majority’s analysis fails because Martin does not \nallow the individualized inquiry into involuntariness to be \nset aside in this way.  Further, the majority opinion combines \nits  gross  misreading  of  Martin,  which  requires  an \nindividualized inquiry, with a flagrant disregard of settled \nclass-certification  principles  pertaining  to  commonality \nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and the requirements of Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(b).  The end result of this amalgamation of error \nis that the majority validates the core aspects of the district \ncourt’s injunction in this case, which effectively requires the \nCity of Grants Pass to allow all but one of its public parks to \nbe used as homeless encampments. \nIn a joint statement regarding the denial of rehearing, \nDistrict Judge Silver and Judge Gould wrote that Judge \nO’Scannlain’s statement regarding the denial of rehearing \nand  the  dissent  from  Judge  M.  Smith  significantly \nexaggerate the holding in Johnson v. Grants Pass.  Grants \nPass, relying on Martin, holds only that governments cannot \ncriminalize the act of sleeping with the use of rudimentary \nprotections from the elements in some public places when a \nperson has nowhere else to sleep. It does not establish an \nunrestrained  right  for  involuntarily  homeless  persons  to \nsleep  anywhere  they  choose.   Nor  does  it  require \njurisdictions  to  cede  all  public  spaces  to  involuntarily \nhomeless persons.  Judges Silver and Gould also explained \nthat class certification was proper, that the commonality \nrequirement  was  met,  that  the  majority  applied  existing \nSupreme Court and Ninth Circuit authority to the record \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 7 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    7 \npresented by the parties, and that Judge O’Scannlain greatly \noverstated the extent to which Martin and Grants Pass fall \non one side of an existing circuit split. \nRespecting  the  denial  of  rehearing  en  banc,  Judge \nO’Scannlain,  joined  by  Judges  Wallace,  Callahan,  Bea, \nIkuta, Bennett, R. Nelson, Bade, Collins, Lee, Bress, Forrest, \nBumatay, and VanDyke, and with whom Judge M. Smith \njoins as to all parts except Part II-A, states that with this \ndecision,  this  Circuit’s  jurisprudence  now  effectively \nguarantees  a  personal  federal  constitutional  ‘right’  for \nindividuals to camp or to sleep on sidewalks and in parks, \nplaygrounds,  and  other  public  places  in  defiance  of \ntraditional  health,  safety,  and  welfare  laws—a  dubious \nholding premised on a fanciful interpretation of the Eighth \nAmendment.  Judge O’Scannlain writes that the Boise panel \nmade no effort to ground its decision in the text, history, or \ntradition  of  the  Eighth  Amendment.   Unfortunately,  the \nproblems created by Boise have now been visited upon the \nCity of Grants Pass by the panel majority here, which has \nexpanded  Boise’s  faulty  holding  to  affirm  an  injunction \neffectively requiring the City to resign all but one of its \npublic parks to be used as homeless encampments.  This \nCircuit is the first and only federal circuit to have divined \nsuch a strange and sweeping mandate from the Cruel and \nUnusual Punishments Clause.  The jurisprudence in this case \nis egregiously flawed and deeply damaging—at war with \nconstitutional text, history, tradition, and Supreme Court \nprecedent.  And it conflicts with other circuits on a question \nof exceptional importance—paralyzing local communities \nfrom addressing the pressing issue of homelessness, and \nseizing policymaking authority that the federal system of \ngovernment leaves to the democratic process.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 8 of 155\n8  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nRespecting the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge Graber \nagreed  with  the  basic  legal  premise  that  the  Eighth \nAmendment protects  against criminal prosecution of the \ninvoluntary act of sleeping but stated that the injunctive \nrelief in this case goes too far.  The extension of Martin to \nclasswide relief, enjoining civil statutes that may eventually \nlead  to  criminal  violations  but  have  never  resulted  in \ncriminal convictions for any named plaintiff, is a step too far \nfrom the individualized inquiries inherent both in the Eighth \nAmendment  context  and  in  the  context  of  injunctive \nrelief.  Even assuming that classwide injunctive relief were \navailable against a prosecution for criminal trespass, the \nEighth Amendment does not prohibit all civil remedies that \ncould, in theory, lead to such a prosecution.  In this way, \nJohnson  unjustifiably  expands  the  reach  of  the  Eighth \nAmendment. \nDissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge \nM.  Smith,  joined  by  Judges  Bennett,  Bumatay,  and \nVanDyke, and with whom Judges Ikuta, R. Nelson, Bade, \nCollins and Bress join as to Parts I and II, stated that Martin \ncannot  be  squared  with  the  Supreme  Court’s  Eighth \nAmendment precedent; that the amendment to the original \nopinion is not accompanied by any downstream changes to \nthe  majority’s  application  of  its  rule  to  the  facts  or  its \nultimate conclusion; and that by wholly collapsing the merits \ninto the class definition, the majority opinion certifies an \nimpermissible  “fail  safe”  class.   Local  governments  are \nhard-pressed to find any way to regulate the adverse health \nand  safety  effects  of  homeless  encampments  without \nrunning afoul of this court’s case law—or, at a minimum, \nbeing saddled with litigation costs.  Judge M.

These cases use a misreading of Supreme \nCourt precedent to require unelected federal judges—often \non  the  basis  of  sloppy,  mixed  preliminary-injunction \nrecords—to act more like homelessness policy czars than as \nArticle III judges applying a discernible rule of law.   \nDissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge \nCollins  states  that  the  panel  majority’s  joint  statement \nregarding the denial of rehearing confirms and illustrates the \nlayers of self-contradiction that underlie its opinion in this \ncase, and that the panel majority is wrong to suggest that a \nnewly enacted Oregon statute regulating the application of \nlocal ordinances to homeless individuals provides another \nreason to not rehear this case en banc.  \nDissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge \nBress, joined by Judges Callahan, M. Smith, Ikuta, Bennett, \nR.

Local leaders—and the people who elect them—\nmust be allowed the latitude to address on the ground the \ndistinctly local features of the present crisis of homelessness \nand lack of affordable housing.

CITY OF GRANTS PASS    13 \nOPINION \nSILVER, District Judge: \nThe  City  of  Grants  Pass  in  southern  Oregon  has  a \npopulation of approximately 38,000.  At least fifty, and \nperhaps as many as 600, homeless persons live in the City.1  \nAnd  the  number  of  homeless  persons  outnumber  the \navailable shelter beds.  In other words, homeless persons \nhave nowhere to shelter and sleep in the City other than on \nthe  streets  or  in  parks.    Nonetheless,  City  ordinances \npreclude homeless persons from using a blanket, a pillow, or \na cardboard box for protection from the elements while \nsleeping within the City’s limits.  The ordinances result in \ncivil fines up to several hundred dollars per violation and \npersons found to violate ordinances multiple times can be \nbarred from all City property.  And if a homeless person is \nfound on City property after receiving an exclusion order, \nthey are subject to criminal prosecution for trespass.      \nIn September 2018, a three-judge panel issued Martin v. \nCity of Boise, 902 F.3d 1031 (9th Cir. 2018), holding “the \nEighth  Amendment  prohibits  the  imposition  of  criminal \npenalties for sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public \nproperty  for  homeless  individuals  who  cannot  obtain \nshelter.”  Id. at 1048.  Approximately six weeks after the \ninitial Martin panel opinion, three homeless individuals filed \na putative class action complaint against the City arguing a \nnumber  of  City  ordinances  were  unconstitutional.    The \ndistrict court certified a class of “involuntarily homeless” \n \n1 During this litigation the parties have used different phrases when \nreferring to this population.  For simplicity, we use “homeless persons” \nthroughout this opinion. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 14 of 155\n14  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \npersons and later granted partial summary judgment in favor \nof the class.2  After the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed some \nclaims not resolved at summary judgment, the district court \nissued  a  permanent  injunction  prohibiting  enforcement \nagainst  the  class  members  of  some  City  ordinances,  at \ncertain times, in certain places.  The City now appeals, \narguing this case is moot, the class should not have been \ncertified, the claims fail on the merits, and Plaintiffs did not \nadequately plead one of their theories.  On the material \naspects of this case, the district court was right.3 \n \n2 Persons are involuntarily homeless if they do not “have access to \nadequate temporary shelter, whether because they have the means to pay \nfor it or because it is realistically available to them for free.” See Martin, \n920 F.3d at 617 n.8.  However, someone who has the financial means to \nobtain shelter, or someone who is staying in an emergency shelter is not \ninvoluntarily homeless. See id. at 617 n.8.  Contrary to the City’s \nargument, this definition of involuntary homelessness is not the same as \nthe definition of “homeless” found in regulations for the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, 24 C.F.R. § 582.5, or the McKinney-\nVento Act, 42 U.S.C. § 11434a(2), the federal law regarding the right of \nhomeless children to a public education.  For example, the McKinney-\nVento Act includes as “homeless children and youths” persons who may \nnot qualify as involuntarily homeless under Martin, such as children and \nyouths “living in emergency or transitional shelters.”  42 U.S.C. § \n11434a(2).  Though the district court noted in part that Plaintiffs met the \ndefinition of homelessness set forth in 24 C.F.R. § 582.5, the district \ncourt also relied on the specific definition of unsheltered homeless \npersons  set  forth  in  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban \nDevelopment’s  regulations  regarding  point-in-time  counts:  “persons \nwho are living in a place not designed or ordinarily used as a regular \nsleeping accommodation for humans must be counted as unsheltered \nhomeless persons.”  24 C.F.R. § 578.7(c)(2)(i).   \n3 Our dissenting colleague’s strong disagreement with the majority \nlargely arises from his disapproval of Martin.  See, e.g., Dissent 56 \n(“Even assuming Martin remains good law . . .”); Dissent 90 (“. . . and \nthe gravity of Martin’s errors.”); Dissent 92 (claiming, without evidence, \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 15 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    15 \nI. \nThis case involves challenges to five provisions of the \nGrants Pass Municipal Code (“GPMC”).  The provisions can \nbe described as an “anti-sleeping” ordinance, two “anti-\ncamping” ordinances, a “park exclusion” ordinance, and a \n“park exclusion appeals” ordinance.  When the district court \nentered judgment, the various ordinances consisted of the \nfollowing.   \nFirst, the anti-sleeping ordinance stated, in full  \nSleeping on Sidewalks, Streets, Alleys, or \nWithin Doorways Prohibited \nA. No person may sleep on public sidewalks, \nstreets, or alleyways at any time as a matter \nof individual and public safety. \nB. No person may sleep in any pedestrian or \nvehicular  entrance  to  public  or  private \nproperty abutting a public sidewalk. \nC. In addition to any other remedy provided \nby law, any person found in violation of this \nsection may be immediately removed from \nthe premises. \nGPMC 5.61.020.  A violation of this ordinance resulted in a \npresumptive $75 fine.  If unpaid, that fine escalated to $160.  \nIf a violator pled guilty, the fines could be reduced by a state \n \nthat “it is hard to deny that Martin has ‘generate[d] dire practical \nconsequences”) (modification in original and citation omitted).  But \nMartin is controlling law in the Ninth Circuit, to which we are required \nto adhere.    \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 16 of 155\n16  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \ncircuit court judge to $35 for a first offense and $50 for a \nsecond offense.  GPMC 1.36.010(K). \nNext,  the  general  anti-camping  ordinance  prohibited \npersons from occupying a “campsite” on all public property, \nsuch as parks, benches, or rights of way.  GPMC 5.61.030.  \nThe term “campsite” was defined as  \nany place where bedding, sleeping bag, or \nother material used for bedding purposes, or \nany stove or fire is placed, established, or \nmaintained for the purpose of maintaining a \ntemporary place to live, whether or not such \nplace incorporates the use of any tent, lean-\nto,  shack,  or  any  other  structure,  or  any \nvehicle or part thereof. \nGPMC  5.61.010.    A  second  overlapping  anti-camping \nordinance  prohibited  camping  in  public  parks,  including \n“[o]vernight parking” of any vehicle.  GPMC 6.46.090.  A \nhomeless individual would violate this parking prohibition if \nshe parked or left “a vehicle parked for two consecutive \nhours [in a City park] . . . between the hours of midnight and \n6:00 a.m.”  Id.  Violations of either anti-camping ordinance \nresulted in a fine of $295.  If unpaid, the fine escalated to \n$537.60.  However, if a violator pled guilty, the fine could \nbe reduced to $180 for a first offense and $225 for a second \noffense.  GPMC 1.36.010(J). \nFinally, the “park exclusion” ordinance allowed a police \nofficer to bar an individual from all city parks for 30 days if, \nwithin one year, the individual was issued two or more \ncitations for violating park regulations.  GPMC 6.46.350(A).  \nPursuant  to  the  “park  exclusion  appeals”  ordinance, \nexclusion orders could be appealed to the City Council.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 17 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    17 \nGPMC  6.46.355.    If  an  individual  received  a  “park \nexclusion” order, but subsequently was found in a city park, \nthat individual would be prosecuted for criminal trespass.     \nSince at least 2013, City leaders have viewed homeless \npersons as cause for substantial concern.  That year the City \nCouncil convened a Community Roundtable (“Roundtable”) \n“to  identify  solutions  to  current  vagrancy  problems.”  \nParticipants  discussed  the  possibility  of  “driving  repeat \noffenders out of town and leaving them there.”  The City’s \nPublic  Safety  Director  noted  police  officers  had  bought \nhomeless persons bus tickets out of town, only to have the \nperson returned to the City from the location where they \nwere sent.  A city councilor made clear the City’s goal \nshould be “to make it uncomfortable enough for [homeless \npersons] in our city so they will want to move on down the \nroad.”  The planned actions resulting from the Roundtable \nincluded  increased  enforcement  of  City  ordinances, \nincluding the anti-camping ordinances.   \nThe year following the Roundtable saw a significant \nincrease in enforcement of the City’s anti-sleeping and anti-\ncamping ordinances.  From 2013 through 2018, the City \nissued a steady stream of tickets under the ordinances.4  On \nSeptember 4, 2018, a three-judge panel issued its opinion in \n \n4 The City issued the following number of tickets under the anti-sleeping \nand anti-camping ordinances:   \n  2013: 74 total tickets \n  2014: 228 total tickets \n  2015: 80 total tickets \n  2016: 47 total tickets \n  2017: 99 total tickets \n  2018: 46 total tickets \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 18 of 155\n18  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nMartin v. City of Boise, 902 F.3d 1031 (9th Cir. 2018). 5  That \ncase served as the backdrop for this entire litigation.   \nIn Martin, six homeless or recently homeless individuals \nsued the city of Boise, Idaho, seeking relief from criminal \nprosecution  under  two  city  ordinances  related  to  public \ncamping.  Martin, 920 F.3d at 603-04.  As relevant here, \nMartin held the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the \n“Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of criminal \npenalties for sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public \nproperty  for  homeless  individuals  who  cannot  obtain \nshelter.”  Id. at 616.  Martin made clear, however, that a city \nis  not  required  to  “provide  sufficient  shelter  for  the \nhomeless, or allow anyone who wishes to sit, lie, or sleep on \nthe streets . . . at any time and at any place.”  Id. at 617 \n(quoting Jones v. City of Los Angeles, 444 F.3d 1118, 1138 \n(9th Cir. 2006), vacated, 505 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir. 2007)) \n(omission in original).   \n \n5 Following the opinion, the City of Boise petitioned for rehearing en \nbanc.  On April 1, 2019, an amended panel opinion was issued and the \npetition for rehearing was denied.  Judge M. Smith, joined by five other \njudges, dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc.  He argued the \nthree-judge panel had, among other errors, misinterpreted the Supreme \nCourt precedents regarding the criminalization of involuntary conduct.  \nMartin, 920 F.3d at 591-92 (M. Smith, J., dissenting from denial of \nrehearing en banc).  Judge Bennett, joined by four judges, also dissented \nfrom the denial of rehearing en banc.  Judge Bennett argued the three-\njudge panel’s opinion was inconsistent with the original public meaning \nof the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause.  Id. at 599 (Bennett, J., \ndissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  The merits of those \ndissents do not alter the binding nature of the amended Martin panel \nopinion.  Unless otherwise indicated, all citations to Martin throughout \nthe remainder of this opinion are to the amended panel opinion.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 19 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    19 \nPursuant to Martin, it is an Eighth Amendment violation \nto  criminally  punish  involuntarily  homeless  persons  for \nsleeping  in  public  if  there  are  no  other  public  areas  or \nappropriate shelters where those individuals can sleep.  Id. \nat  617  n.8  (“Naturally,  our  holding  does  not  cover \nindividuals  who  do  have  access  to  adequate  temporary \nshelter, whether because they have the means to pay for it or \nbecause it is realistically available to them for free, but who \nchoose not to use it.”).  When assessing the number of shelter \nspaces, Martin held shelters with a “mandatory religious \nfocus” could not be counted as available due to potential \nviolations of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause.  \nId. at 609-10 (citing Inouye v. Kemna, 504 F.3d 705, 712-13 \n(9th Cir. 2007)). \nIn  October  2018,  approximately  six  weeks  after  the \nMartin opinion, Debra Blake filed her putative class action \ncomplaint  against  the  City.    The  complaint  alleged \nenforcement of the City’s anti-sleeping and anti-camping \nordinances  violated  the  Cruel  and  Unusual  Punishment \nClause  of  the  Eighth  Amendment,  the  Equal  Protection \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The complaint was \namended to include additional named plaintiffs and to allege \na claim that the fines imposed under the ordinances violated \nthe Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment.  On \nJanuary 2, 2019, a few months after the initial complaint was \nfiled,  and  before  Plaintiffs  filed  their  class  certification \nmotion, the City amended its anti-camping ordinance in an \nattempt to come into compliance with Martin.  Prior to this \nchange, the anti-camping ordinance was worded such that \n“‘sleeping’  in  parks  .  .  .  automatically  constitut[ed] \n‘camping.’”  According to the City, “in direct response to \nMartin  v.  Boise,  the  City  amended  [the  anti-camping \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 20 of 155\n20  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nordinance] to make it clear that the act of ‘sleeping’ was to \nbe distinguished from the prohibited conduct of ‘camping.’”  \nThe City meant to “make it clear that those without shelter \ncould engage in the involuntary acts of sleeping or resting in \nthe City’s parks.”  Shortly after the City removed “sleeping” \nfrom the “camping” definition, Plaintiffs moved to certify a \nclass.  Plaintiffs requested certification of a class defined as  \nAll involuntarily homeless individuals living \nin Grants Pass, Oregon, including homeless \nindividuals who sometimes sleep outside city \nlimits to avoid harassment and punishment \nby [the City] as addressed in this lawsuit. \nPlaintiffs’ class certification motion was accompanied by a \ndeclaration from the Chief Operating Officer and Director of \nHousing  and  Homeless  Services  for  United  Community \nAction Network (“UCAN”), a non-profit organization that \nserves homeless people in Josephine County, the county \nwhere the City is located.6  UCAN had recently conducted a \n“point-in-time count of homeless individuals in Josephine \nCounty.”7    Based  on  that  count,  the  Chief  Operating \n \n6 The Department of Housing and Urban Development regulations \nimpose obligations on the “continuum of care,” which is defined as “the \ngroup composed of representatives of relevant organizations . . . that are \norganized to plan for and provide, as necessary, a system of outreach, \nengagement, and assessment . . . to address the various needs of homeless \npersons and persons at risk of homelessness for a specific geographic \narea.” 24 C.F.R. § 576.2.   \n7 As the “continuum of care” in the City, UCAN was required to conduct \npoint-in-time counts (“PIT counts”) of homeless persons within that \ngeographic area.  24 C.F.R. § 578.7(c)(2).  PIT counts measure the \nnumber of sheltered and unsheltered homeless individuals on a single \nnight.  24 C.F.R. § 578.7(c)(2).  The Martin court relied on PIT counts \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 21 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    21 \nOfficer’s  declaration  stated  “[h]undreds  of  [homeless] \npeople live in Grants Pass,” and “almost all of the homeless \npeople in Grants Pass are involuntarily homeless.  There is \nsimply no place in Grants Pass for them to find affordable \nhousing or shelter.  They are not choosing to live on the street \nor in the woods.”   \nThe City opposed class certification, arguing Plaintiffs \nhad not provided sufficient evidence to meet any of the \nrequirements  for  certifying  a  class.    The  district  court \ndisagreed and certified the class proposed by Plaintiffs.  The \nparties proceeded with discovery and filed cross-motions for \nsummary judgment. \nAt the time the parties filed their summary judgment \nmotions, there were only four locations in the City that \ntemporarily  housed  homeless  persons,  which  proved \ninadequate.  One location was run by the Gospel Rescue \nMission,  an  explicitly  religious  organization  devoted  to \nhelping the poor.  The Gospel Rescue Mission operated a \nfacility for single men without children, and another facility \nfor women, including women with children.  These two \nfacilities required residents to work at the mission six hours \na day, six days a week in exchange for a bunk for 30 days.  \nResidents were  required to attend an approved place of \nworship  each  Sunday  and  that  place  of  worship  had  to \nespouse “traditional Christian teachings such as the Apostles \nCreed.”  Disabled persons with chronic medical or mental \n \nconducted by local non-profits to determine the number of homeless \npeople in the jurisdiction.  See Martin, 920 F.3d at 604.  Courts and \nexperts note that PIT counts routinely undercount homeless persons, but \nthey appear to be the best available source of data on homelessness.  See, \ne.g., id. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 22 of 155\n22  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nhealth issues that prevented them from complying with the \nMission’s rules were prohibited.8   \nIn addition to the Gospel Rescue Mission, the City itself \noperated a “sobering center” where law enforcement could \ntransport  intoxicated  or  impaired  persons.    That  facility \nconsisted  of  twelve  locked  rooms  with  toilets  where \nintoxicated individuals could sober up.  The rooms did not \nhave beds.  The City also provided financial support to the \nHearts with a Mission Youth Shelter, an 18-bed facility \nwhere unaccompanied minors aged 10 to 17 could stay for \nup to 72 hours, and could stay even longer if they had \nparental consent.   \nFinally, on nights when the temperature was below 30 \ndegrees (or below 32 degrees with snow), UCAN operated a \n“warming center” capable of holding up to 40 individuals.  \nThat  center  did  not  provide  beds.    The  center  reached \ncapacity on every night it operated except the first night it \nopened, February 3, 2020.  Between February 3 and March \n19, 2020, the warming center was open for 16 nights.  The \ncenter did not open at all during the winter of 2020-2021.   \nPresented  with  evidence  of  the  number  of  homeless \npersons and the shelter spaces available, the district court \nconcluded “[t]he record is undisputed that Grants Pass has \nfar  more  homeless  individuals  than  it  has  practically \navailable shelter beds.”  The court then held that, based on \nthe unavailability of shelter beds, the City’s enforcement of \nits anti-camping and anti-sleeping ordinances violated the \n \n8 Multiple class members submitted uncontested declarations to the \ndistrict court stating they did not stay at the Gospel Rescue Mission \nbecause they suffer from disqualifying disabilities and/or were unwilling \nto attend church.   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 23 of 155\n  JOHNSON V.

The fact that Martin \ninvolved criminal violations while the present case involved \ninitial civil violations that matured into criminal violations \nmade “no difference for Eight Amendment purposes.”  Next, \nthe  court  held  the  system  of  fines  violated  the  Eighth \nAmendment’s Excessive Fines Clause.9  Finally, the court \nheld  the  appeals  process  for  park  exclusions  violated \nprocedural due process under the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment.   \nIn reaching its decision the district court was careful to \npoint  out  that,  consistent  with  Martin,  the  scope  of  its \ndecision was limited.  The court’s order made clear that the \nCity  was  not  required  to  provide  shelter  for  homeless \npersons and the City could still limit camping or sleeping at \ncertain times and in certain places.  The district court also \nnoted the City may still “ban the use of tents in public parks,” \n“limi[t] the amount of bedding type materials allowed per \nindividual,”  and  pursue  other  options  “to  prevent  the \n \n9 Part of the City’s argument on this issue was that the fines are not \nmandatory because state court judges retain discretion not to impose \nfines.  This is inconsistent with the text of the ordinances and not \nsupported by the record.  The provision of the municipal code defining \npenalties for ordinance violations clarifies that the fines are mandatory.  \nIt provides, the fines “shall be $295” and “shall be $75.”  GPMC \n1.36.010(J)-(K) (emphasis added).  Conversely, it is only discretionary \nto reduce fines because the relevant ordinance provides that, “[u]pon a \nplea of guilty . . . the penalty may be reduced” to the amount listed for a \nfirst or second offense.  Id. (emphasis added).  After a second citation, \nthere is no authority within the municipal code that permits judges to \nreduce fines, and there is no evidence in the record demonstrating circuit \ncourt judges have reduced fines except pursuant to GPMC 1.36.010. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 24 of 155\n24  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nerection of encampments that cause public health and safety \nconcerns.”10   \nApproximately one month after the summary judgment \norder, the district court issued a judgment which included a \npermanent injunction that provided a complicated mix of \nrelief.    First,  the  district  court  declared  the  ordinance \nregarding the appeals of park exclusions failed to provide \n“adequate procedural due process,” but that ordinance was \nnot  permanently  enjoined.    Instead,  the  district  court \nenjoined  only  the  enforcement  of  the  underlying  park \nexclusion  ordinance.    Next,  the  district  court  declared \nenforcement  of  the  anti-sleeping  and  anti-camping \nordinances  against  class  members  “violates  the  Eighth \nAmendment  prohibition  against  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment”  and  “violates  the  Eighth  Amendment \nprohibition against excessive fines.”  Without explanation, \nhowever, the district court did not enjoin those ordinances in \ntheir entirety.  Rather, the district court entered no injunctive \nrelief regarding the anti-sleeping ordinance.  But the district \ncourt permanently enjoined enforcement of the anti-camping \nordinances,  as  well  as  an  ordinance  regarding  “criminal \ntrespassing on city property related to parks,” in all City \nparks at night except for one park where the parties agreed \nthe injunction need not apply.11  The district court also \npermanently  enjoined  enforcement  of  the  anti-camping \nordinances during daytime hours unless an initial warning \nwas  given  “at  least  24  hours  before  enforcement.”  \n \n10 The district court denied summary judgment on other claims brought \nby Plaintiffs.  Those claims were subsequently voluntarily dismissed.   \n11 The City ordinance regarding “criminal trespass” was never at issue in \nthe litigation until the permanent injunction.  Plaintiffs explain it was \nincluded in the injunction “[b]y agreement of the parties.”    \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 25 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    25 \nAccordingly,  under  the  permanent  injunction,  the  anti-\ncamping  ordinances  may  be  enforced  under  some \ncircumstances during the day, but never at night.   \nThe City appealed and sought initial en banc review to \nclarify the scope of Martin.  The petition for initial hearing \nen banc was denied.   \nII. \nThe  core  issue  involving  enforcement  of  the  anti-\ncamping ordinances is governed in large part by Martin.  \nWhile there are some differences between Martin and the \npresent case, the City has not identified a persuasive way to \ndifferentiate  its  anti-camping  ordinances  from  the \nquestioned ordinances in Martin.  Therefore, the district \ncourt’s ruling that the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause \nbars enforcement of the anti-camping ordinances will be \nmostly  affirmed.    We  need  not  address  the  potential \nexcessiveness  of  the  fines  issue  or  whether  Plaintiffs \nadequately pled their due process challenge. \nOur analysis proceeds in five parts.  First, we reject the \nCity’s argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction.12  \nSecond, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court’s \ncertification of a class of involuntarily homeless persons.  \nThird, we agree with the district court that at least portions \nof the anti-camping ordinance violate the Cruel and Unusual \nPunishment clause under Martin.  Fourth, we conclude there \nis no need to resolve whether the fines violate the Excessive \n \n12 However, we vacate summary judgment and remand as to the anti-\nsleeping  ordinance  to  afford  the  district  court  the  opportunity  to \nsubstitute a class representative in place of Debra Blake, who passed \naway while this matter was on appeal.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 26 of 155\n26  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nFines clause.  Fifth, we hold it is unnecessary to decide \nPlaintiffs’ procedural due process claim. \nA. \nStanding and mootness are questions of law that we \nreview de novo.  Hartman v. Summers, 120 F.3d 157, 159 \n(9th Cir. 1997); Foster v. Carson, 347 F.3d 742, 745 (9th \nCir. 2003).  “Federal courts must determine that they have \njurisdiction before proceeding to the merits,” and plaintiffs \nmust demonstrate standing as a necessary component of \njurisdiction.  Lance v. Coffman, 549 U.S. 437, 439 (2007).  \nTo have Article III standing, a plaintiff must show (1) a \nconcrete  and  particularized  injury,  (2)  caused  by  the \nchallenged  conduct,  (3)  that  is  likely  redressable  by  a \nfavorable judicial decision.  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. \nLaidlaw Env’t Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180-81 \n(2000).  For purposes of injunctive relief, “[a]bstract injury \nis not enough”—the plaintiff must have sustained or be in \nimmediate danger “of sustaining some direct injury as the \nresult of the challenged” law.  O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. \n488, 494 (1974) (quotation marks and citation omitted).  \nThe  City’s  appellate  briefing  makes  two  standing \narguments.  First, the City argues Plaintiffs’ claims are now \nmoot because Plaintiffs no longer face a risk of injury based \non the City’s changed behavior after Martin.  Second, the \nCity argues Plaintiffs have not identified any relief that is \nwithin a federal court’s power to redress.  Both arguments \nare without merit. \nA claim becomes moot, and no longer justiciable in \nfederal court, if it has been remedied independent of the \ncourt.  See Genesis Healthcare Corp. v. Symczyk, 569 U.S. \n66, 72 (2013).  There is abundant evidence in the record \nestablishing homeless persons were injured by the City’s \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 27 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    27 \nenforcement actions in the past.  The City argues, however, \nthat it made changes after Martin such that there is no longer \na threat of future injury.  The problem for the City is that \nvoluntary cessation of challenged practices rarely suffices to \nmoot  a  case  and,  in  any  event,  there  is  evidence  the \nchallenged practices have continued after Martin. \n“It is well settled that ‘a defendant’s voluntary cessation \nof a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of \nits power to determine the legality of the practice.’”  Friends \nof the Earth, 528 U.S. at 189 (quoting City of Mesquite v. \nAladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 289 (1982)).  This is so \n“because  a  dismissal  for  mootness  would  permit  a \nresumption of the challenged conduct as soon as the case is \ndismissed.”  Knox v. Serv. Emps. Int’l Union, Local 1000, \n567  U.S.  298,  307  (2012).    Thus,  the  City  “bears  the \nformidable burden of showing that it is absolutely clear the \nallegedly  wrongful  behavior  could  not  reasonably  be \nexpected to recur.”  Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 190.  \nInstead  of  the  City  making  it  “absolutely  clear”  it  has \nstopped enforcement activities, the record shows ongoing \nenforcement.     \nThe parties diverge substantially on how to characterize \nthe  degree  of  enforcement  after  Martin  was  issued  in \nSeptember 2018.  The City argued in its briefing and at oral \nargument that it has largely complied with Martin, noting the \n2019  amendment  to  an  anti-camping  ordinance,  that \ncitations were issued “sparingly” in 2019, and in particular \nit says it issued only two citations during the late evening \nand early morning  since Martin.  The  City supports its \npetition with a declaration from a City police officer stating \n“[i]t is the regular practice of every officer I know of on this \ndepartment to enforce these Ordinances sparingly and in \nrecognition of the different circumstances we encounter.”  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 28 of 155\n28  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nAs  for  Plaintiffs,  they  offered  evidence  showing \nenforcement continued after Martin such that class members \nreceived  citations  and  exclusion  orders  for  camping  or \nsleeping and were prosecuted for criminal trespass between \nthe point the lawsuit was filed and the close of discovery.   \nAlthough the record does show the rate of enforcement \nof  the  various  ordinances  decreased  since  Martin,  even \naccepting the City’s position the evidence is undisputed that \nenforcement continued.13  It is plainly inaccurate for the City \nto claim all enforcement ceased.  The ongoing enforcement \nactivities establish the City did not meet its “formidable \nburden” of showing the challenged activities will not recur.  \nFriends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 190.  The City’s mootness \nargument fails.14 \n \n13 The City also argues “there was no evidence that anyone was ever cited \nfor the simple act of sleeping in a City park” after Martin.  But the \ncitation issued to Dolores Nevin in late December 2019 pursuant to the \nCity’s “criminal trespass” ordinance included a narrative explaining, \n“[d]uring an area check of Riverside Park, Dolores Nevin was found \nsleeping during closed hours.  Nevin, who has been warned in the past, \nwas issued a citation for Trespass on City Property.”  (emphasis added).  \nAnd on September 11, 2019, Grants Pass Police Officer Jason McGinnis \nissued citations to Debra Blake and Carla Thomas for being in Riverside \nPark at approximately 7:30 a.m. with sleeping bags and belongings \nspread around themselves.  The citation given to Debra Blake, a named \nplaintiff, identified the offense as “Criminal Trespass on City Property.”  \nDebra Blake was later convicted of that offense and fined.  Other \nindividuals cited for camping in a city park in 2019 include class \nmembers: Gail Laine, William Stroh, Dawn Schmidt, Cristina Trejo, \nKellie Parker, Colleen Bannon, Amanda Sirnio, and Michael and Louana \nEllis.   \n14 Mootness was also considered during the Martin litigation.  See Bell \nv. City of Boise, 709 F.3d 890, 898, 900-01 (9th Cir. 2013).  The City of \nBoise argued that a combination of an amended definition of “camping” \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 29 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    29 \nThe  City’s  other  jurisdictional  argument  is  that \nPlaintiffs’ claims are not redressable.  According to the City, \nany possible relief intrudes inappropriately upon matters of \npolicy best left to executive and legislative discretion.  We \ndisagree.  Consistent with Martin, the district court granted \nlimited relief enjoining enforcement of  a few  municipal \nordinances at certain times, in certain places, against certain \npersons.  None of the cases cited by the City credibly support \nits argument that the district court injunction overstepped the \njudiciary’s  limited  authority  under  the  Constitution.  \nContrary to the City’s position, enjoining enforcement of a \nfew municipal ordinances aimed at involuntarily homeless \npersons  cannot  credibly  be  compared  to  an  injunction \nseeking to require the federal government to “phase out \nfossil fuel emissions and draw down excess atmospheric \nCO2.”  Juliana v. United States, 947 F.3d 1159, 1164-65 \n(9th  Cir.  2020).    The  relief  sought  by  Plaintiffs  was \nredressable within the limits of Article III.  See Renee v. \nDuncan, 686 F.3d 1002, 1013 (9th Cir. 2012) (holding a \nplaintiff’s burden to demonstrate redressability is “relatively \nmodest”) (citation omitted). \n \nin the ordinance and a “Special Order,” prohibiting police officers from \nenforcing the ordinances when a person is on public property and there \nis no available overnight shelter, mooted the case.  Id. at 894-95.  We \nrejected the argument that the change to the definition of “camping” \nrendered the case moot because “[m]ere clarification of the Camping \nOrdinance does not address the central concerns of the Plaintiffs’ Eighth \nAmendment claims”—that the ordinance “effectively criminalized their \nstatus as homeless individuals.”  Id. at 898 n.12.  And we held the \nadoption of a “Special Order” did not moot the case because the Special \nOrder was not a legislative enactment, and as such it “could be easily \nabandoned or altered in the future.”  Id. at 901.   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 30 of 155\n30  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nFinally, we raise sua sponte the possibility that the death \nof class representative Debra Blake while this matter was on \nthe appeal has jurisdictional significance.  Cf. Fort Bend Cty. \nv. Davis, 139 S.Ct. 1843, 1849 (2019) (holding courts must \nraise issues of subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte).  We \nhold Blake’s death does not moot the class’s claims as to all \nchallenged  ordinances  except  possibly  the  anti-sleeping \nordinance.  As to that ordinance, we remand to allow the \ndistrict  court  the  opportunity  to  substitute  a  class \nrepresentative in Blake’s stead.  \nWith respect to the park exclusion, criminal trespass, and \nanti-camping ordinances, the surviving class representatives, \nGloria Johnson15 and John Logan,16 have standing in their \n \n15 The dissent suggests Gloria Johnson does not have standing to \nchallenge the park exclusion and criminal trespass ordinances.  Dissent \n71-72.    The  dissent  concedes,  however,  Johnson  has  standing  to \nchallenge the anti-camping ordinances, GPMC 5.61.030, 6.46.090.  But \nthe dissent does not provide a meaningful explanation why it draws this \ndistinction between the ordinances that work in concert.  It is true \nJohnson has not received a park exclusion order and has not been charged \nwith criminal trespass in the second degree. However, there is little doubt \nthat her continued camping in parks would lead to a park exclusion order \nand, eventually, criminal trespass charges.  Johnson is positioned to bring \na pre-enforcement challenge against the park exclusion and criminal \ntrespass ordinances, because they will be used against her given the \nundisputed fact that she remains involuntarily homeless in Grants Pass.  \nShe established a credible threat of future enforcement under the anti-\ncamping  ordinances  which  creates  a  credible  threat  of  future \nenforcement under the park exclusion and criminal trespass ordinances. \n16 The dissent claims John Logan has not established standing.  Dissent \n69-71.  During the course of this case, Logan submitted two declarations.  \nAt the class certification stage, his declaration stated he “lived out of \n[his] truck on the streets in Grants Pass for about 4 years.”  During that \ntime, he was “awakened by City of Grants Pass police officer and told \nthat I cannot sleep in my truck anywhere in the city and ordered to move \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 31 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    31 \nown  right.    Although  they  live  in  their  cars,  they  risk \nenforcement under all the same ordinances as Blake and the \nclass (with the exception of the anti-sleeping ordinance, \nGPMC 5.61.020, which cannot be violated by sleeping in a \ncar) and have standing in their own right as to all ordinances \nexcept GPMC 5.61.020.  \n \non.”  To avoid those encounters, Logan “usually sleep[s] in [his] truck \njust outside the Grants Pass city limits.”  However, Logan stated “[i]f \nthere was some place in the city where [he] could legally sleep in [his] \ntruck, [he] would because it would save valuable gas money and avoid . \n. . having to constantly move.”  Logan also explained he has “met dozens, \nif not hundreds, of homeless people in Grants Pass” over the years who \nhad been ticketed, fined, arrested, and criminally prosecuted “for living \noutside.” At summary judgment, Logan submitted a declaration stating \nhe is “currently involuntarily homeless in Grants Pass and sleeping in \n[his] truck at night at a rest stop North of Grants Pass.”  He stated he \n“cannot sleep in the City of Grants Pass for fear that [he] will be \nawakened, ticketed, fined, moved along, trespassed and charged with \nCriminal Trespass.”  The dissent reads this evidence as indicating Logan \nfailed to “provide[] any facts to establish” that he is likely to be issued a \ncitation under the challenged ordinances.  Dissent 70.  We do not agree.  \nThe undisputed facts establish Logan is involuntarily homeless. When \nhe slept in Grants Pass, he was awoken by police officers and ordered to \nmove.  His  personal  knowledge  was  that  involuntarily  homeless \nindividuals  in  Grants  Pass  often  are  cited  under  the  challenged \nordinances  and  Grants  Pass  continues  to  enforce  the  challenged \nordinances. And, but for the challenged ordinances, Logan would sleep \nin the city.  Therefore, as the district court found, it is sufficiently likely \nLogan would be issued a citation that Logan’s standing is established.  \nThat is especially true given the Supreme Court's instruction that a \nplaintiff  need  not  wait  for “an  actual  arrest,  prosecution,  or  other \nenforcement action” before “challenging [a] law.” Susan B. Anthony List \nv. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014). Finally, even if Logan had not \ndemonstrated  standing,  the  dissent’s  analysis  regarding  Logan  is \nirrelevant because this case could proceed solely based on the standing \nestablished by Gloria Johnson and the class.  See Bates v. United Parcel \nServ., Inc., 511 F.3d at 985 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc). \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 32 of 155\n32  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nWith respect to the anti-sleeping ordinance, the law is \nless clear.  Debra Blake is the only class representative who \nhad standing in her own right to challenge the anti-sleeping \nordinance.  Under cases such as Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, \n401 (1975), and Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., Inc., \n424 U.S. 747 (1976), a class representative may pursue the \nlive claims of a properly certified class—without the need to \nremand  for substitution of a new representative17—even \nafter his own claims become moot, provided that several \nrequirements are met.18  See Bates v. United Parcel Serv., \nInc., 511 F.3d 974, 987-88 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc).  If \nDebra  Blake’s  challenge  to  the  anti-sleeping  ordinance \nbecame  moot  before  she  passed  away,  she  could  have \ncontinued to pursue the challenge on behalf of the class \nunder the doctrine of Sosna.  But we have not found any case \napplying Sosna and Franks to a situation such as this, in \n \n17 See Sosna, 419 U.S. at 403 (“[W]e believe that the test of Rule 23(a) \nis met.”); id. at 416-17 (White, J., dissenting) (“It is claimed that the \ncertified class supplies the necessary adverse parties for a continuing \ncase or controversy . . . The Court cites no authority for this retrospective \ndecision as to the adequacy of representation which seems to focus on \nthe  competence  of  counsel  rather  than  a  party  plaintiff  who  is  a \nrepresentative member of the class.  At the very least, the case should be \nremanded to the District Court.”). \n18 The class must be properly certified, see Franks, 424 U.S. at 755-56, \nor the representative must be appealing denial of class certification.  See \nUnited States Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 404 (1980).  \nThe class representative must be a member of the class with standing to \nsue at the time certification is granted or denied.  See Sosna, 419 U.S. at \n403.  The unnamed class members must still have a live interest in the \nmatter throughout the duration of the litigation.  See Franks, 424 U.S. at \n755.  And the court must be satisfied that the named representative will \nadequately pursue the interests of the class even though their own interest \nhas expired.  See Sosna, 419 U.S. at 403.   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 33 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    33 \nwhich the death of a representative causes a class to be \nunrepresented as to part (but not all) of a claim.  The parties \ndid not brief this issue and no precedent indicates whether \nthis raises a jurisdictional question, which would deprive us \nof  authority  to  review  the  merits  of  the  anti-sleeping \nordinance challenge, or a matter of Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23, which might not.   \nBecause Plaintiffs have not moved to substitute a class \nrepresentative  pursuant  to  Federal  Rule  of  Appellate \nProcedure 43(a) or identified a representative who could be \nsubstituted, because no party has addressed this question in \nbriefing, and because we are not certain of our jurisdiction \nto consider the challenge to the anti-sleeping ordinance, we \nthink it appropriate to vacate summary judgment as to the \nanti-sleeping ordinance and remand to determine whether a \nsubstitute representative is available as to that challenge \nalone.  See Cobell v. Jewell, 802 F.3d 12, 23-24 (D.C. Cir. \n2015) (discussing substitution of a party during appeal).  \nSubstitution of a class representative may significantly aid \nin the resolution of the issues in this case.  Remand will not \ncause  significant  delay  because,  as  we  explain  below, \nremand is otherwise required so that the injunction can be \nmodified.  In the absence of briefing or precedent regarding \nthis question, we do not decide whether this limitation is \njurisdictional or whether it arises from operation of Rule 23.   \nWe therefore hold the surviving class representatives at \na  minimum  have  standing  to  challenge  every  ordinance \nexcept the anti-sleeping ordinance.  As to the anti-sleeping \nordinance, we vacate summary judgment and remand for the \ndistrict court to consider in the first instance whether an \nadequate class representative, such as class member Dolores \nNevin, exists who may be substituted.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 34 of 155\n34  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nB. \nThe City’s next argument is the district court erred in \ncertifying the class.  We “review a district court’s order \ngranting class certification for abuse of discretion, but give \nthe district court ‘noticeably more deference when reviewing \na grant of class certification than when reviewing a denial.’”  \nPatel v. Facebook, Inc., 932 F.3d 1264, 1275 (9th Cir. 2019) \n(internal citation omitted) (quoting Just Film, Inc. v. Buono, \n847 F.3d 1108, 1115 (9th Cir. 2017)).  Factual findings \nunderlying class certification are reviewed for clear error.  \nParsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 673 (9th Cir. 2014).   \nA member of a class may sue as a representative party if \nthe member satisfies Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)’s \nfour prerequisites: numerosity, commonality, typicality, and \nadequacy of representation.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a); Mazza v. \nAm. Honda Motor Co., Inc., 666 F.3d 581, 588 (9th Cir. \n2012).  Assessing these requirements involves “rigorous \nanalysis” of the evidence.  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, \n564 U.S. 338, 351 (2011) (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of the Sw. \nv. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982)).   \nIf  the  initial  requirements  of  Rule  23(a)  are  met,  a \nputative class representative must also show the class falls \ninto one of three categories under Rule 23(b).  Plaintiffs \nbrought this suit under Rule 23(b)(2), seeking injunctive or \ndeclaratory relief based on the City having “acted or refused \nto act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that \nfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is \nappropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(b)(2).   \nThe district court found the Rule 23(a) requirements \nsatisfied and certified a class under Rule 23(b)(2).  The \nCity’s arguments against this class certification are obscure.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 35 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    35 \nIt appears the City’s argument is that class certification was \nan abuse of discretion because the holding of Martin can \nonly  be  applied  after  an  individualized  inquiry  of  each \nalleged involuntarily homeless person’s access to shelter.19  \nThe City appears to suggest the need for individualized \ninquiry  defeats  numerosity,  commonality,  and typicality.  \nWhile we acknowledge the Martin litigation was not a class \naction, nothing in that decision precluded class actions.20  \nAnd based on the record in this case, the district court did \nnot err by finding Plaintiffs satisfied the requirements of \nRule 23 such that a class could be certified.   \nTo satisfy the numerosity requirement a proposed class \nmust  be  “so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is \nimpracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  For purposes of \nthis  requirement,  “‘impracticability’  does  not  mean \n‘impossibility,’ but only the difficulty or inconvenience of \njoining all members of the class.”  Harris v. Palm Springs \nAlpine Ests., Inc., 329 F.2d 909, 913–14 (9th Cir. 1964) \n(quotation omitted).  There is no specific number of class \nmembers required.  See Gen. Tel.

The City does not identify how this finding was \nclearly erroneous.  In fact, the City affirmatively indicated to \nPlaintiffs prior to the class certification order that the number \nof homeless persons residing in Grants Pass for the past 7 \nyears was “unknown.”  Further, the only guidance offered \nby the City regarding a specific number of class members \ncame long after the class was certified.  A City police officer \nclaimed in a declaration that he was “aware of less than fifty \nindividuals total who do not have access to any shelter” in \nthe  City.    The  officer  admitted,  however,  it  “would  be \nextremely difficult to accurately estimate the population of \npeople who are homeless in Grants Pass regardless of the \ndefinition used.”   \nThe officer’s guess of “less than fifty” homeless persons \nis  inconsistent  with  the  general  understanding  that  PIT \ncounts routinely undercount homeless persons.  See Martin, \n920 F.3d at 604 (“It is widely recognized that a one-night \npoint  in  time  count  will  undercount  the  homeless \npopulation.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But even \naccepting  the  officer’s  assessment  that  there  were \napproximately  fifty  homeless  persons  in  the  City,  the \nnumerosity requirement is satisfied.

Dissent 77-79.  \nThat misunderstands how the present class was structured.  The dissent \nattempts to reframe the common question as a very general inquiry.  It \nappears  the  dissent  interprets  the  question  whether  an  Eighth \nAmendment violation must be determined by an individualized inquiry \nas whether each individual is “involuntarily homeless.”  To assess that, \na court would have to conduct an individualized inquiry and determine \nif an individual was “involuntarily homeless.”  But that is not the \ncommon question in this case.  Rather, the question is whether the City's \nenforcement of the anti-camping ordinances against all involuntarily \nhomeless individuals violates the Eighth Amendment.  This question is \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 39 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    39 \ndefinition.  Pursuant to the class definition, the class includes \nonly  involuntarily  homeless  persons.23    Individuals  who \nhave shelter or the means to acquire their own shelter simply \n \ncapable of common resolution on a prospective class-wide basis, as the \nrecord establishes.  \n23 The dissent argues this created a prohibited “fail safe” class.  That is \nerroneous.  As noted in a recent en banc decision, “a ‘fail safe’ class . . . \nis defined to include only those individuals who were injured by the \nallegedly unlawful conduct.”  Olean Wholesale Grocery Coop., Inc. v. \nBumble Bee Foods LLC, 31 F.4th 651, 669 n.14 (9th Cir. 2022) (en \nbanc).  Such classes are prohibited “because a class member either wins \nor, by virtue of losing, is defined out of the class and is therefore not \nbound by the judgment.”  Id.  See also Ruiz Torres v. Mercer Canyons \nInc., 835 F.3d 1125, 1138 (9th Cir. 2016) (noting a fail safe class “is one \nthat is defined so narrowly as to preclude[ ] membership unless the \nliability of the defendant is established”).  No such class is present here.  \nThe class was defined, in relevant part, as “[a]ll involuntarily homeless \nindividuals living in Grants Pass.”  Membership in that class has no \nconnection to the success of the underlying claims.  Put differently, the \nclass would have consisted of exactly the same population whether \nGrants Pass won or lost on the merits.  The obvious illustration of this is \nthe class population would not change if a court determined the anti-\ncamping ordinance violated the Eighth Amendment while the anti-\nsleeping ordinance did not. In that situation, class members would not be \n“defined out of the class.” Olean, 31 F.4th at 669 n.14 (citation omitted).  \nRather, class members would be “bound by the judgment” regarding the \nanti-sleeping  ordinance.  Id.  In  any  event,  the  dissent’s  concerns \nregarding individualized determinations are best made when the City \nattempts to enforce its ordinances.  Cf. McArdle v. City of Ocala, 519 \nF.Supp.3d 1045, 1052 (M.D. Fla. 2021) (requiring that officers inquire \ninto the availability of shelter space before an arrest could be made for \nviolation of the City’s “open lodging” ordinance).  If it is determined at \nthe enforcement stage that a homeless individual has access to shelter, \nthen they do not benefit from the injunction and may be cited or \nprosecuted under the anti-camping ordinances.  Moreover, as we noted \nabove, several classes of homeless individuals have been certified in the \npast. See supra note 20. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 40 of 155\n40  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nare never class members.24  Because we find there existed at \nleast one question of law or fact common to the class, the \ndistrict  court  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  in  concluding \ncommonality was satisfied.   \nTypicality asks whether “the claims or defenses of the \nrepresentative parties are typical” of the class.  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(a)(3).  Typicality is a “permissive standard[].”  Staton \nv. Boeing Co., 327 F.3d 938, 957 (9th Cir. 2003) (citation \nomitted).  It “refers to the nature of the claim or defense of \nthe class representative, and not to the specific facts from \nwhich it arose or the relief sought.”  Parsons, 754 F.3d at \n685 (citation omitted).   \nThe  class  representatives’  claims  and  defenses  are \ntypical of the class in that they are homeless persons who \nclaim that the City cannot enforce the challenged ordinances \nagainst them when they have no shelter.  The defenses that \napply  to  class  representatives  and  class  members  are \nidentical.  The claims of class representatives and class \nmembers are similar, except that some class representatives \nlive in vehicles while other class members may live on \nstreets  or  in  parks,  not  vehicles.    This  does  not  defeat \ntypicality.    The  class  representatives  with  vehicles  may \nviolate the challenged ordinances in a different manner than \nsome  class  members—i.e.,  by  sleeping  in  their  vehicle, \nrather than on the ground.  But they challenge the same \nordinances under the same constitutional provisions as other \n \n24 We do not, as the dissent contends, “suggest[ ] that the class definition \nrequires only an involuntary lack of access to regular or permanent \nshelter to qualify as ‘involuntarily homeless.’”  Dissent 84.  It is unclear \nwhere the dissent finds this in the opinion.  To be clear: A person with \naccess to temporary shelter is not involuntarily homeless unless and until \nthey no longer have access to shelter.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 41 of 155\n  JOHNSON V.

The \ndistrict  court  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  in  finding  the \ntypicality requirement met.  \nThe City does not present any other arguments regarding \nclass certification, such as the propriety of certifying the \nclass as an injunctive class under Rule 23(b)(2).  We do not \nmake arguments for parties and the arguments raised by the \nCity regarding class certification fail. \nC. \nHaving rejected the City’s jurisdictional arguments, as \nwell as its arguments regarding class certification, the merits \ncan be addressed.  The City’s merits arguments regarding the \nCruel and Unusual Punishment Clause take two forms.  First, \nthe City argues its system of imposing civil fines cannot be \nchallenged  as  violating  the  Cruel  and  Unusual  Clause \nbecause that clause provides protection only in criminal \nproceedings, after an individual has been convicted.  That is \nincorrect.  Second, the City argues Martin does not protect \nhomeless persons from being cited under the City’s amended \nanti-camping ordinance which prohibits use of any bedding \nor similar protection from the elements.  The City appears to \nhave conceded it cannot cite homeless persons merely for \nsleeping in public but the City maintains it is entitled to cite \nindividuals for the use of rudimentary bedding supplies, such \nas a blanket, pillow, or sleeping bag “for bedding purposes.”  \nSee GPMC 5.61.010(B).  Again, the City is incorrect.  Here, \nwe focus exclusively on the anti-camping ordinances. \nAccording to the City, citing individuals under the anti-\ncamping ordinances cannot violate the Cruel and Unusual \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 42 of 155\n42  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nPunishment Clause because citations under the ordinances \nare  civil  and  civil  citations  are  “categorically  not \n‘punishment’ under the Eight Amendment.”25  The City \nexplains “the simple act of issuing a civil citation with a \ncourt date [has never] been found to be unconstitutional \n‘punishment’ under the Eighth Amendment.”  While not \nentirely clear, the City appears to be arguing the Cruel and \nUnusual Punishment Clause provides no protection from \ncitations  categorized  as  “civil”  by  a  governmental \nauthority.26 \n \n25 This position is in significant tension with the City’s actions taken \nimmediately after Martin was issued.  As noted earlier, the City amended \nits anti-camping ordinance “in direct response to Martin v. Boise” to \nallow for “the act of ‘sleeping’” in City parks.  If the City believed \nMartin has no impact on civil ordinances, it is unclear why the City \nbelieved a curative “response” to Martin was necessary.      \n26 The primary support for this contention is Ingraham v. Wright, 430 \nU.S. 651 (1977).  In Ingraham, the Supreme Court addressed whether \nthe Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause was implicated by corporal \npunishment in public schools.  The Court stated the Cruel and Unusual \nPunishment Clause limits “the criminal process in three ways: First, it \nlimits the kinds of punishment that can be imposed on those convicted \nof crimes; second, it proscribes punishment grossly disproportionate to \nthe severity of the crime; and third, it imposes substantive limits on what \ncan be made criminal and punished as such.”  Id. at 667.  The Court \ninterpreted the challenge to corporal punishment as, in effect, asserting \narguments under  only  the first  or  second  limitation.   That  is,  the \nchallenge  was  whether  “the  paddling  of  schoolchildren”  was  a \npermissible amount or type of punishment.  Id. at 668.  The Ingraham \ndecision involved no analysis or discussion of the third limitation, i.e. \nthe “substantive limits on what can be made criminal.”  Id. at 667.  Thus, \nit was in the context of evaluating the amount or type of punishment that \nIngraham stated “Eighth Amendment scrutiny is appropriate only after \nthe State has complied with the constitutional guarantees traditionally \nassociated with criminal prosecutions.”  Id. at 671 n.40.  When, as here, \nplaintiffs are raising challenges to the “substantive limits on what can be \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 43 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    43 \nPlaintiffs’ focus on civil citations does involve an extra \nstep from the normal Cruel and Unusual Clause analysis and \nthe analysis of Martin.  Usually, claims under the Cruel and \nUnusual Clause involve straightforward criminal charges.  \nFor  example, the situation in Martin involved  homeless \npersons  allegedly  violating  criminal  ordinances  and  the \nopinion identified its analysis as focusing on the “criminal” \nnature of the charges over ten times.  920 F.3d at 617.  Here, \nthe City has adopted a slightly more circuitous approach than \nsimply establishing violation of its ordinances as criminal \noffenses.  Instead, the City issues civil citations under the \nordinances.  If an individual violates the ordinances twice, \nshe  can  be  issued  a  park  exclusion  order.    And  if  the \nindividual is found in a park after issuance of the park \nexclusion  order,  she  is  cited  for  criminal  trespass.    See \nO.R.S. 164.245 (criminal trespass in the second degree).  \nMultiple City police officers explained in their depositions \nthis sequence was the standard protocol.  The holding in \nMartin cannot be so easily evaded. \nMartin held the Cruel and Unusual Punishment clause \n“prohibits the imposition of criminal penalties for sitting, \nsleeping, or lying outside on public property for homeless \nindividuals who cannot obtain shelter.”  920 F.3d at 616.  A \nlocal government cannot avoid this ruling by issuing civil \ncitations that, later, become criminal offenses.  A recent \ndecision by the en banc Fourth Circuit illustrates how the \n \nmade  criminal,”  Ingraham  does  not  prohibit  a  challenge  before  a \ncriminal conviction.  See Martin, 920 F.3d at 614 (“Ingraham did not \nhold that a plaintiff challenging the state’s power to criminalize a \nparticular status or conduct in the first instance, as the plaintiffs in this \ncase do, must first be convicted.”). \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 44 of 155\n44  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nCruel and Unusual Punishment Clause looks to the eventual \ncriminal penalty, even if there are preliminary civil steps.   \nThe  disputes  in  Manning  v.  Caldwell  for  City  of \nRoanoke, 930 F.3d 264 (4th Cir. 2019) (en banc) arose from \na Virginia law which allowed a state court to issue a civil \norder identifying an individual as a “habitual drunkard.”  Id. \nat 268.  Once labeled a “habitual drunkard,” the individual \nwas “subject to incarceration for the mere possession of or \nattempt to possess alcohol, or for being drunk in public.”  Id. \nat 269.  A group of homeless alcoholics filed suit claiming, \namong  other  theories,  the  “habitual  drunkard”  scheme \nviolated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause.  In the \nplaintiffs’ view, the scheme resulted in criminal prosecutions \nbased on their “status,” i.e. alcoholism.  See id. at 281. \nUsing reasoning very similar to that in Martin, the Fourth \nCircuit found the statutory scheme unconstitutional because \nit provided punishment based on the plaintiffs’ status.  Of \nparticular relevance here, the Fourth Circuit reasoned the \nfact that Virginia’s “scheme operate[d] in two steps” did not \nchange the analysis.  Id. 283.  Issuing a civil order first, \nfollowed by a criminal charge, was a “two-pronged statutory \nscheme”  potentially  “less  direct”  than  straightforwardly \ncriminalizing the status of alcohol addiction.  Id.  But the \nscheme remained unconstitutional because it “effectively \ncriminalize[d] an illness.”  Id. The fact that Virginia “civilly \nbrands alcoholics as ‘habitual drunkards’ before prosecuting \nthem for involuntary manifestations of their illness does \nnothing  to  cure  the  unconstitutionality  of  this  statutory \nscheme.”  Id.  \nThe same reasoning applies here.  The anti-camping \nordinances prohibit Plaintiffs from engaging in activity they \ncannot  avoid.    The  civil  citations  issued  for  behavior \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 45 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    45 \nPlaintiffs cannot avoid are then followed by a civil park \nexclusion order and, eventually, prosecutions for criminal \ntrespass.  Imposing a few extra steps before criminalizing the \nvery acts Martin explicitly says cannot be criminalized does \nnot cure the anti-camping ordinances’ Eighth Amendment \ninfirmity.     \nThe City offers a second way to evade the holding in \nMartin.  According to the City, it revised its anti-camping \nordinances to allow homeless persons to sleep in City parks.  \nHowever, the City’s argument regarding the revised anti-\ncamping ordinance is an illusion.  The amended ordinance \ncontinues to prohibit homeless persons from using “bedding, \nsleeping bag, or other material used for bedding purposes,” \nor using stoves, lighting fires, or erecting structures of any \nkind.  GPMC 5.61.010.  The City claims homeless persons \nare  free  to  sleep  in  City  parks,  but  only  without  items \nnecessary to facilitate sleeping outdoors.27   \nThe  discrepancy  between  sleeping  without  bedding \nmaterials,  which  is  permitted  under  the  anti-camping \nordinances,  and  sleeping  with  bedding,  which  is  not,  is \nintended to distinguish the anti-camping ordinances from \nMartin and the two Supreme Court precedents underlying \nMartin, Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660 (1962) and \n \n27 The Grants Pass ordinance does not specifically define “bedding” but \ncourts  give  the  words  of  a  statute  or  ordinance  their  “ordinary, \ncontemporary, common meaning” absent an indication to the contrary \nfrom the legislature.  See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 420, 431 (2000) \n(citation omitted).  The Oxford English Dictionary defines “bedding” as \n“[a] collective term for the articles which compose a bed.”  OXFORD \nENGLISH DICTIONARY.  And “bed” is defined as “a place for sleeping.”  \nMERRIAM-WEBSTER COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 108 (11th ed.).  The \nCity’s effort to dissociate the use of bedding from the act of sleeping or \nprotection from the elements is nonsensical.   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 46 of 155\n46  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nPowell v. Texas, 392 U.S. 514 (1968).  Under those cases, a \nperson may not be prosecuted for conduct that is involuntary \nor the product of a “status.”  See Martin, 920 F.3d at 617 \n(citation omitted).  The City accordingly argues that sleeping \nis  involuntary  conduct  for  a  homeless  person,  but  that \nhomeless  persons  can  choose  to  sleep  without  bedding \nmaterials and therefore can be prosecuted for sleeping with \nbedding. \nIn its order granting summary judgment, the district \ncourt  correctly  concluded  the  anti-camping  ordinances \nviolated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause to the \nextent  they  prohibited  homeless  persons  from  “taking \nnecessary minimal measures to keep themselves warm and \ndry while sleeping when there are no alternative forms of \nshelter available.”  The only plausible reading of Martin is \nthat it applies to the act of “sleeping” in public, including \narticles  necessary  to  facilitate  sleep.    In  fact,  Martin \nexpressed concern regarding a citation given to a woman \nwho had been found sleeping on the ground, wrapped in \nblankets.  920 F.3d at 618.  Martin noted that citation as an \nexample  of  the  anti-camping  ordinance  being  “enforced \nagainst  homeless  individuals  who  take  even  the  most \nrudimentary  precautions  to  protect  themselves  from  the \nelements.”    Id.    Martin  deemed  such  enforcement \nunconstitutional.  Id.  It follows that the City cannot enforce \nits anti-camping ordinances to the extent they prohibit “the \nmost rudimentary precautions” a homeless person might \ntake against the elements.28  The City’s position that it is \n \n28 Grants Pass is cold in the winter.

The dissent concedes that pursuant to Martin, \nthe City cannot impose criminal penalties on involuntarily \nhomeless individuals for sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on \npublic property.  Dissent 62.  Thus, our purported “complete \ndisregard[ ]” for Martin is not regarding the central holding \nthat  local  governments  may  not  criminalize  involuntary \nconduct.    Rather,  the  dissent  believes,  based  on  its \ninterpretation of the Supreme Court opinions underlying \nMartin, that the Eighth Amendment provides only “a case-\nspecific affirmative defense” that can never be litigated on a \nclass basis.  Dissent 59.  To reach this counterintuitive \nconclusion,  the  dissent  reads  limitations  into  Robinson, \nPowell, and Martin that are nonexistent.    \nIn Robinson, the Supreme Court struck down, under the \nEighth Amendment, a California law that made “it a criminal \noffense for a person to ‘be addicted to the use of narcotics.’”  \nRobinson, 370 U.S. at 666.

In a plurality opinion, Justice Marshall upheld \nthe conviction of Leroy Powell on the ground that he was not \npunished on the basis of his status as an alcoholic, but rather \nfor the actus reus of being drunk in public.  Powell, 392 U.S. \nat 535.  Four justices dissented, in an opinion by Justice \nFortas, on the ground that the findings made by the trial \njudge—that Powell was a chronic alcoholic who could not \nresist the impulse to drink—compelled the conclusion that \nPowell’s  prosecution  violated  the  Eighth  Amendment \nbecause Powell could not avoid breaking the law.  Id. at 569-\n70 (Fortas, J., dissenting).  Justice White concurred in the \njudgment.  He stressed, “[i]f it cannot be a crime to have an \nirresistible compulsion to use narcotics, I do not see how it \ncan  constitutionally  be  a  crime  to  yield  to  such  a \ncompulsion.”  Id. at 549 (White, J., concurring).  However, \nthe reason for Justice White’s concurrence was that he felt \nPowell failed to prove his status as an alcoholic compelled \nhim to violate the law by appearing in public. Id. at 553 \n(White, J., concurring).   \nPursuant to Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188 (1977), \nthe narrowest position which gained the support of five \njustices is treated as the holding of the Court.  In identifying \nthat position, Martin held: “five Justices [in Powell] gleaned \nfrom  Robinson  the  principle  that  ‘that  the  Eighth \nAmendment  prohibits  the  state  from  punishing  an \ninvoluntary  act  or  condition  if  it  is  the  unavoidable \nconsequence of one’s status or being.’”   Martin, 920 F.3d at \n616 (quoting Jones, 443 F.3d at 1135).  Martin did not—as \nthe dissent alleges—hold that Powell’s “controlling opinion \nwas Justice White’s concurrence.”  Dissent 60.  See id., 920 \nF.3d at 616-17.  It would have violated the rule of Marks to \nadopt portions of Justice White’s concurrence that did not \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 49 of 155\n  JOHNSON V.

The dissent claims \nJustice  White’s  concurrence  requires  that  the  individual \nclaiming  a  status  must  prove  the  status  compels  the \nindividual  to  violate  the  law—here,  that  each  homeless \nindividual  must  prove  their  status  as  an  involuntarily \nhomeless person to avoid prosecution.29  Dissent 59-63.  The \n \n29 The dissent’s attempt to create a governing holding out of Justice \nWhite’s concurrence is erroneous.  By citing a word or two out of context \nin the Powell dissenting opinion (e.g., “constitutional defense”) our \ndissenting  colleague  argues  both  Justice  White  and  the  dissenting \njustices in Powell agreed any person subject to prosecution has, at most, \n“a case-specific affirmative ‘defense.’”  Dissent 59-60, 77.  We disagree.  \nThough status was litigated as a defense in the context of Leroy Powell’s \nprosecution, no opinion in Powell held status may be raised only as a \ndefense.  The Powell plurality noted trial court evidence that Leroy \nPowell was an alcoholic, but that opinion contains no indication “status” \nmay only be invoked as “a case-specific affirmative ‘defense.’”  As for \nJustice White, the opening paragraph of his concurrence indicates he was \nprimarily concerned not with how a status must be invoked but with the \nfact that certain statuses should be beyond the reach of the criminal law: \nIf  it  cannot  be  a  crime  to  have  an  irresistible \ncompulsion to use narcotics, I do not see how it can \nconstitutionally  be  a  crime  to  yield  to  such  a \ncompulsion.  Punishing  an  addict  for  using  drugs \nconvicts  for  addiction  under  a  different  name. \nDistinguishing  between  the  two  crimes  is  like \nforbidding criminal conviction for being sick with flu \nor epilepsy but permitting punishment for running a \nfever or having a convulsion. Unless Robinson is to be \nabandoned, the use of narcotics by an addict must be \nbeyond the reach of the criminal law. Similarly, the \nchronic alcoholic with an irresistible urge to consume \nalcohol should not be punishable for drinking or for \nbeing drunk. \nPowell, 392 U.S. at 548-49 (White, J., concurring) (internal citation \nomitted).  Finally, neither the remainder of Justice White’s concurrence \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 50 of 155\n50  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \ndissent  claims  this  renders  class  action  litigation \ninappropriate.  But no opinion in either Powell or Martin \ndiscussed the propriety of litigating the constitutionality of \nsuch criminal statutes by way of a class action.30  \nThe law that the dissent purports to unearth in Justice \nWhite’s concurrence is not the “narrowest ground” which \nreceived the support of five justices.  No opinion in Powell \nor Martin supports the dissent’s assertion that Powell offers \nexclusively  an  “affirmative  ‘defense’”  that  cannot  be \nlitigated in a class action.31  Dissent 59, 77.  Although the \n \nnor the dissenting opinion explicitly indicates one’s status may only be \ninvoked as a defense.  Rather, Justice White and the dissenters simply \nagreed that, if Powell’s status made his public intoxication involuntary, \nhe could not be prosecuted.  There is no conceivable way to interpret \nMartin as adopting our dissenting colleague’s position that one’s status \nmust be invoked as a defense.  But even assuming the burden must be \nplaced on the party wishing to invoke a status, the class representatives \nestablished there is no genuine dispute of material fact they have the \nrelevant status of being involuntarily homeless. \n30 Federal courts have certified classes of homeless plaintiffs in the past, \nsee supra note 20, which counsels against the City’s and the dissent’s \nposition that such classes are impermissible under Rule 23.  \n31 As noted above, Martin did not hold homeless persons bear the burden \nof demonstrating they are involuntarily homeless.  See supra note 29.  \nBecause the record plainly demonstrates Plaintiffs are involuntarily \nhomeless, there similarly is no reason for us to determine what showing \nwould be required.  We note, however, that some district courts have \naddressed circumstances in which the question of burden was somewhat \nrelevant.  See, e.g., McArdle, 519 F.Supp.3d at 1052 (requiring, based in \npart on Martin, that officers inquire into the availability of shelter space \nbefore making an arrest for violation of the City’s “open lodging” \nordinance); Butcher v. City of Marysville, 2019 WL 918203, at *7 (E.D. \nCal. Feb. 25, 2019) (holding plaintiffs failed to make the “threshold \nshowing” of pleading that there was no shelter capacity and that they had \nno other housing at the time of enforcement). \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 51 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    51 \ndissent might prefer that these principles find support in the \ncontrolling law, they do not.  We thus do not misread Martin \nby failing to apply the principles found solely in Justice \nWhite’s  concurrence.    Rather,  we  adhere  to  the  narrow \nholding of Martin adopting the narrowest ground shared by \nfive justices in Powell: a person cannot be prosecuted for \ninvoluntary conduct if it is an unavoidable consequence of \none’s status.   \nIn addition to erecting an absolute bar to class litigation \nof  this  sort,  the  dissent  would  also  impose  artificial \nlimitations  on  claims  brought  pursuant  to  Martin.    The \ndissent  concedes  Gloria  Johnson  has  standing  to  bring \nindividual challenges to most of the City’s ordinances.  But \nthe dissent then speculates that Gloria Johnson may, in fact, \nnot be involuntarily homeless in the City.  The dissent would \ninsist that Gloria Johnson, for example, leave the City to \ncamp illegally on federal or state lands, provide the court an \naccounting of her finances and employment history, and \nindicate with specificity where she lived before she lost her \njob and her home.  Dissent 85-88.  There, of course, exists \nno law or rule requiring a homeless person to do any of these \nthings.  Gloria Johnson has adequately demonstrated that \nthere is no available shelter in Grants Pass and that she is \ninvoluntarily homeless. \nThe undisputed evidence establishes Gloria Johnson is \ninvoluntarily  homeless  and  there  is  undisputed  evidence \nshowing many other individuals in similar situations.  It is \nundisputed that there are at least around 50 involuntarily \nhomeless persons in Grants Pass, and PIT counts, which \nMartin relied on to establish the number of homeless persons \nin Boise, revealed more than 600.  See Martin, 920 F.3d at \n604.  It is undisputed that there is no secular shelter space \navailable to adults.  Many class members, including the class \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 52 of 155\n52  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nrepresentatives, have sworn they are homeless and the City \nhas not contested those declarations.  The dissent claims this \nshowing is not enough, implying that Plaintiffs must meet an \nextremely  high  standard  to  show  they  are  involuntarily \nhomeless.  Even viewed in the light most favorable to the \nCity, there is no dispute of material fact that the City is home \nto many involuntarily homeless individuals, including the \nclass representatives.  In fact, neither the City nor the dissent \nhas demonstrated there is even one voluntarily homeless \nindividual living in the City.32  In light of the undisputed \nfacts in the record underlying the district court’s summary \njudgment  ruling  that  show  Plaintiffs  are  involuntarily \nhomeless,  and  the  complete  absence  of  evidence  that \nPlaintiffs are voluntarily homeless, we agree with the district \ncourt  that  Plaintiffs  such  as  Gloria  Johnson  are  not \nvoluntarily homeless and that the anti-camping ordinances \nare unconstitutional as applied to them unless there is some \nplace, such as shelter, they can lawfully sleep.33 \n \n32 The dissent claims we have “shifted the burden to the City to establish \nthe voluntariness of the behavior targeted by the ordinances.”  Dissent \n87 n.13 (emphasis omitted).  To the contrary, as we have explained, we \ndo not decide who would bear such a burden because undisputed \nevidence demonstrates Plaintiffs are involuntarily homeless.  Rather, \nwithout deciding who would bear such a burden if involuntariness were \nsubject  to  serious  dispute,  we  note  Plaintiffs  have  demonstrated \ninvoluntariness and there is no evidence in the record showing any class \nmember has adequate alternative shelter.  \n33  Following  Martin,  several  district  courts  have  held  that  the \ngovernment may evict or punish sleeping in public in some locations, \nprovided  there  are  other  lawful  places  within  the  jurisdiction  for \ninvoluntarily homeless individuals to sleep.  See, e.g., Shipp v. Schaaf, \n379 F.Supp.3d 1033, 1037 (N.D. Cal. 2019) (“However, even assuming \n(as Plaintiffs do) that [eviction from a homeless encampment by citation \nor arrest] might occur, remaining at a particular encampment on public \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 53 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    53 \nOur holding that the City’s interpretation of the anti-\ncamping  ordinances  is  counter  to  Martin  is  not  to  be \ninterpreted to hold that the anti-camping ordinances were \nproperly  enjoined  in  their  entirety.    Beyond  prohibiting \nbedding, the ordinances also prohibit the use of stoves or \nfires, as well as the erection of any structures.  The record \nhas not established the fire, stove, and structure prohibitions \ndeprive homeless persons of sleep or “the most rudimentary \nprecautions” against the elements.34  Moreover, the record \ndoes not explain the City’s interest in these prohibitions.35  \n \nproperty is not conduct protected by Martin, especially where the closure \nis temporary in nature.”); Aitken v. City of Aberdeen, 393 F.Supp.3d \n1075, 1082 (W.D. Wash. 2019) (“Martin does not limit the City’s ability \nto evict homeless individuals from particular public places.”); Gomes v. \nCty. of Kauai, 481 F.Supp.3d 1104, 1109 (D. Haw. 2020) (holding the \nCounty of Kauai could prohibit sleeping in a public park because it had \nnot  prohibited  sleeping  on  other  public  lands);  Miralle  v.  City  of \nOakland, 2018 WL 6199929, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 28, 2018) (holding \nthe City could clear out a specific homeless encampment because \n“Martin  does  not  establish  a  constitutional  right  to  occupy  public \nproperty indefinitely at Plaintiffs’ option”); Le Van Hung v. Schaaf, 2019 \nWL 1779584, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 23, 2019) (holding Martin does not \n“create a right for homeless residents to occupy indefinitely any public \nspace of their choosing”).  Because the City has not established any \nrealistically available place within the jurisdiction for involuntarily \nhomeless individuals to sleep we need not decide whether alternate \noutdoor space would be sufficient under Martin.  The district court may \nconsider this issue on remand, if it is germane to do so.   \n34 The dissent claims we establish “the right to use (at least) a tent.”  \nDissent 89 n.15.  This assertion is obviously false.  The district court’s \nholding that the City may still “ban the use of tents in public parks” \nremains undisturbed by our opinion.   \n35 The dissent asserts, “it is hard to deny that Martin has ‘generate[d] dire \npractical consequences for the hundreds of local governments within our \njurisdiction, and for the millions of people that reside therein.’”  Dissent \n92 (quoting Martin, 920 F.3d at 594 (M. Smith, J., dissenting from denial \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 54 of 155\n54  JOHNSON V.

On  remand,  the  district  court  will  be \nrequired  to  craft  a  narrower  injunction  recognizing \nPlaintiffs’ limited right to protection against the elements, as \nwell as limitations when a shelter bed is available.36    \nD. \nThe district court concluded the fines imposed under the \nanti-sleeping  and  anti-camping  ordinances  violated  the \nEighth Amendment’s prohibition on excessive fines.  A \ncentral portion of the district court’s analysis regarding these \nfines was that they were based on conduct “beyond what the \nCity may constitutionally punish.”  With this in mind, the \ndistrict court noted “[a]ny fine [would be] excessive” for the \nconduct at issue.   \nThe City presents no meaningful argument on appeal \nregarding the excessive fines issue.  As for Plaintiffs, they \nargue the fines at issue were properly deemed excessive \nbecause they were imposed for “engaging in involuntary, \nunavoidable life sustaining acts.”  The permanent injunction \nwill result in no class member being fined for engaging in \nsuch protected activity.  Because no fines will be imposed \n \nof rehearing en banc)) (modification in original).  There are no facts in \nthe record to establish that Martin has generated “dire” consequences for \nthe City.  Our review of this case is governed only by the evidence \ncontained in the record.   \n36 The district court enjoined the park exclusion ordinance in its entirety.  \nThe parties do not address this in their appellate briefing but, on remand, \nthe district court should consider narrowing this portion as well because \nthe  park  exclusion ordinance  presumably  may be  enforced  against \nPlaintiffs who engage in prohibited activity unrelated to their status as \nhomeless persons.   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 55 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    55 \nfor protected activity, there is no need for us to address \nwhether hypothetical fines would be excessive.   \nE. \nThe final issue is whether Plaintiffs properly pled their \nchallenge to the park exclusion appeals ordinance.  GPMC \n6.46.355.  That ordinance provided a mechanism whereby \nan individual who received an exclusion order could appeal \nto the City Council.  Subsequent to the district court’s order, \nthe  City  amended  its  park  exclusion  appeals  ordinance.  \nTherefore, the district court’s determination the previous \nordinance violated Plaintiffs’ procedural due process rights \nhas no prospective relevance.  Because of this, we need not \ndecide if Plaintiffs adequately pled their challenge to the \nprevious ordinance.   \nIII. \nWe affirm the district court’s ruling that the City of \nGrants Pass cannot, consistent with the Eighth Amendment, \nenforce  its  anti-camping  ordinances  against  homeless \npersons  for  the  mere  act  of  sleeping  outside  with \nrudimentary protection from the elements, or for sleeping in \ntheir car at night, when there is no other place in the City for \nthem to go.  On remand, however, the district court must \nnarrow its injunction to enjoin only those portions of the \nanti-camping ordinances that prohibit conduct protected by \nMartin and this opinion.  In particular, the district court \nshould narrow its injunction to the anti-camping ordinances \nand enjoin enforcement of those ordinances only against \ninvoluntarily  homeless  person  for  engaging  in  conduct \nnecessary to protect themselves from the elements when \nthere is no shelter space available.  Finally, the district court \non remand should consider whether there is an adequate \nrepresentative who may be substituted for Debra Blake. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 56 of 155\n56  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nWe are careful to note that, as in Martin, our decision is \nnarrow.    As  in  Martin,  we  hold  simply  that  it  is \n“unconstitutional to [punish] simply sleeping somewhere in \npublic if one has nowhere else to do so.”  Martin, 920 F.3d \nat 590 (Berzon, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en \nbanc).  Our decision reaches beyond Martin slightly.  We \nhold, where Martin did not, that class certification is not \ncategorically  impermissible  in  cases  such  as  this,  that \n“sleeping” in the context of Martin includes sleeping with \nrudimentary forms of protection from the elements, and that \nMartin applies to civil citations where, as here, the civil and \ncriminal punishments are closely intertwined.  Our decision \ndoes not address a regime of purely civil infractions, nor \ndoes it prohibit the City from attempting other solutions to \nthe homelessness issue. \nAFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND \nREMANDED.  \n \n \nCOLLINS, Circuit Judge, dissenting:  \nIn Martin v. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584 (9th Cir. 2019), \nwe held that “the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel \nand unusual punishment bars a city from prosecuting people \ncriminally for sleeping outside on public property when \nthose people have no home or other shelter to go to.”  Id. at \n603.  Even assuming that Martin remains good law, today’s \ndecision—which  both  misreads  and  greatly  expands \nMartin’s holding—is egregiously wrong.  To make things \nworse,  the  majority  opinion  then  combines  its  gross \nmisreading of Martin with a flagrant disregard of settled \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 57 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    57 \nclass-certification  principles.    The  end  result  of  this \namalgamation of error is that the majority validates the core \naspects of the district court’s extraordinary injunction in this \ncase, which effectively requires the City of Grants Pass to \nallow all but one of its public parks to be used as homeless \nencampments.1  I respectfully dissent.   \nI \nBecause our opinion in Martin frames the issues here, I \nbegin  with  a  detailed  overview  of  that  decision  before \nturning to the facts of the case before us. \nA \nIn Martin, six individuals sued the City of Boise, Idaho, \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the City had violated \ntheir Eighth Amendment rights in enforcing two ordinances \nthat respectively barred, inter alia, (1) camping in public \nspaces and (2) sleeping in public places without permission.  \n920  F.3d  at  603–04,  606.    All  six  plaintiffs  had  been \nconvicted of violating at least one of the ordinances, id. at \n606, but we held that claims for retrospective relief based on \nthose convictions were barred by the doctrine of Heck v. \nHumphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994).  See Martin, 920 F.3d at \n611–12 (noting that, under Heck, a § 1983 action may not be \nmaintained if success in the suit would necessarily show the \ninvalidity of the plaintiff’s criminal conviction, unless that \nconviction has already been set aside or invalidated).  What \nremained, after application of the Heck bar, were the claims \n \n1 The majority’s decision is all the more troubling because, in truth, the \nfoundation on which it is built is deeply flawed: Martin seriously \nmisconstrued the Eighth Amendment and the Supreme Court’s caselaw \nconstruing it.  See infra at 90–92.  But I am bound by Martin, and—\nunlike the majority—I faithfully apply it here. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 58 of 155\n58  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nfor retrospective relief asserted by two plaintiffs (Robert \nMartin and Pamela Hawkes) in connection with citations \nthey had received that did not result in convictions, and the \nclaims  for  prospective  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief \nasserted  by  Martin  and  one  additional  plaintiff  (Robert \nAnderson).  Id. at 604, 610, 613–15; see also id. at 618–20 \n(Owens,  J.,  dissenting  in  part)  (dissenting  from  the \nmajority’s holding that the prospective relief claims survived \nHeck).    On  the  merits  of  those  three  plaintiffs’  Eighth \nAmendment claims, the Martin panel held that the district \ncourt had erred in granting summary judgment for the City.  \nId. at 615–18. \nAlthough the text of the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and \nUnusual Punishments Clause states only that “cruel and \nunusual punishments” shall not be “inflicted,” U.S. CONST., \namend. VIII (emphasis added), the Martin panel nonetheless \nheld  that  the  Clause  “places  substantive  limits”  on  the \ngovernment’s  ability  to  criminalize  “sitting,  sleeping,  or \nlying outside on public property,” 920 F.3d at 615–16.  In \nreaching this conclusion, the Martin panel placed dispositive \nreliance on the Supreme Court’s decisions in Robinson v. \nCalifornia, 370 U.S. 660 (1962), and Powell v. Texas, 392 \nU.S.  514  (1968).    I  therefore  briefly  review  those  two \ndecisions before returning to Martin. \nRobinson held that a California law that made “it a \ncriminal offense for a person to ‘be addicted to the use of \nnarcotics,’”  370  U.S.  at  660  (quoting  CAL.  HEALTH  & \nSAFETY CODE § 11721 (1957 ed.)), and that did so “even \nthough [the person] has never touched any narcotic drug \nwithin the State or been guilty of any irregular behavior \nthere, inflicts a cruel and unusual punishment in violation of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment,” id. at 667.  The California \nstatute, the Court emphasized, made the “‘status’ of narcotic \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 59 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    59 \naddiction  a  criminal  offense,”  regardless  of  whether  the \ndefendant had “ever used or possessed any narcotics within \nthe State” or had “been guilty of any antisocial behavior \nthere.”  Id. at 666 (emphasis added). \nIn Powell, a fractured Supreme Court rejected Powell’s \nchallenge to his conviction, under a Texas statute, for being \n“found in a state of intoxication in any public place.”  392 \nU.S. at 517 (quoting TEX. PENAL CODE art. 477 (1952)).  A \nfour-Justice plurality distinguished Robinson on the ground \nthat, because Powell “was convicted, not for being a chronic \nalcoholic, but for being in public while drunk on a particular \noccasion,” Texas had “not sought to punish a mere status, as \nCalifornia did in Robinson.”  Id. at 532 (plurality).  The \nplurality  held  that  Robinson  did  not  address,  much  less \nestablish, that “certain conduct cannot constitutionally be \npunished  because  it  is,  in  some  sense,  ‘involuntary’  or \n‘occasioned by a compulsion.’”  Id. at 533 (emphasis added).   \nJustice White concurred in the judgment on the narrower \nground that Powell had failed to establish the “prerequisites \nto the possible invocation of the Eighth Amendment,” which \nwould have required him to “satisfactorily show[] that it was \nnot feasible for him to have made arrangements to prevent \nhis  being  in  public  when  drunk  and  that  his  extreme \ndrunkenness sufficiently deprived him of his faculties on the \noccasion in issue.”  Id. at 552 (White, J., concurring).  And \nbecause, in Justice White’s view, the Eighth Amendment at \nmost  provided  a  case-specific  affirmative  “defense”  to \napplication of the statute, id. at 552 n.4, he agreed that the \nTexas statute was “constitutional insofar as it authorizes a \npolice  officer  to  arrest  any  seriously  intoxicated  person \nwhen he is encountered in a public place,” id. at 554 n.5 \n(emphasis added).  Emphasizing that Powell himself “did \nnot show that his conviction offended the Constitution” and \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 60 of 155\n60  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nthat Powell had “made no showing that he was unable to stay \noff  the  streets  on  the  night  in  question,”  Justice  White \nconcurred  in  the  majority’s  affirmance  of  Powell’s \nconviction.  Id. at 554 (emphasis added). \nThe four dissenting Justices in Powell agreed that the \nTexas statute “differ[ed] from that in Robinson” inasmuch as \nit “covers more than a mere status.”  392 U.S. at 567 (Fortas, \nJ., dissenting).  There was, as the dissenters noted, “no \nchallenge here to the validity of public intoxication statutes \nin general or to the Texas public intoxication statute in \nparticular.”  Id. at 558.  Indeed, the dissenters agreed that, in \nthe  ordinary  case  “when  the  State  proves  such  [public] \npresence in a state of intoxication, this will be sufficient for \nconviction, and the punishment prescribed by the State may, \nof course, be validly imposed.”  Id. at 569.  Instead, the \ndissenters concluded that the application of the statute to \nPowell was unconstitutional “on the occasion in question” \nin light of the Texas trial court’s findings about Powell’s \ninability to control his condition.  Id. at 568 n.31 (emphasis \nadded).  Those findings concerning Powell’s “constitutional \ndefense,” the dissenters concluded, established that Powell \n“was  powerless  to  avoid  drinking”  and  “that,  once \nintoxicated, he could not prevent himself from appearing in \npublic places.”  Id. at 558, 568; see also id. at 525 (plurality) \n(describing the elements of the “constitutional defense” that \nPowell sought to have the Court recognize).   \nWhile acknowledging that the plurality in Powell had \n“interpret[ed]  Robinson  as  precluding  only  the \ncriminalization of ‘status,’ not of ‘involuntary’ conduct,” the \nMartin panel held that the controlling opinion was Justice \nWhite’s concurrence.  920 F.3d at 616.  As I have noted, \nJustice White concluded that the Texas statute against public \ndrunkenness could constitutionally be applied, even to an \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 61 of 155\n  JOHNSON V.

United States, 430 \nU.S. 188 (1977), this narrower reasoning given by Justice \nWhite for joining the Powell majority’s judgment upholding \nthe conviction constitutes the Court’s holding in that case.  \nSee id. at 193 (“When a fragmented Court decides a case and \nno single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of \nfive Justices, ‘the holding of the Court may be viewed as that \nposition taken by those Members who  concurred in the \njudgments on the narrowest grounds.’” (citation omitted)); \nsee also United States v. Moore, 486 F.2d 1139, 1151 (D.C. \nCir. 1973) (en banc) (Wilkey, J., concurring) (concluding \nthat the judgment in Powell rested on the overlap in the \nviews  of  “four  members  of  the  Court”  who  held  that \nPowell’s  acts  of  public  drunkenness  “were  punishable \nwithout  question”  and  the  view  of  Justice  White  that \nPowell’s acts “were punishable so long as the acts had not \nbeen proved to be the product of an established irresistible \ncompulsion”). \nThe  Martin  panel  quoted  dicta  in  Justice  White’s \nconcurrence suggesting that, if the defendant could make the \nrequisite  “showing”  that  “resisting  drunkenness  is \n \n2 Justice White, however, did not resolve the further question of whether, \nif such a showing had been made, the Eighth Amendment would have \nbeen  violated.

These dicta, Martin noted, overlapped with \nsimilar statements in the dissenting opinion in Powell, and \nfrom  those  two  opinions,  the  Martin  panel  derived  the \nproposition that “five Justices” had endorsed the view that \n“the Eighth Amendment prohibits the state from punishing \nan  involuntary  act  or  condition  if  it  is  the  unavoidable \nconsequence of one’s status or being.”  Id. (citation omitted).  \nApplying  that  principle,  Martin  held  that  “the  Eighth \nAmendment prohibits the imposition of criminal penalties \nfor sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public property for \nhomeless  individuals  who  cannot  obtain  shelter.”    Id.  \nBecause “human beings are biologically compelled to rest, \nwhether by sitting, lying, or sleeping,” Martin held that \nprohibitions on such activities in public cannot be applied to \nthose who simply have “no option of sleeping indoors.”  Id. \nat 617. \nThe  Martin  panel  emphasized  that  its  “holding  is  a \nnarrow  one.”    Id.    Martin  recognized  that,  if  there  are \nsufficient available shelter beds for all homeless persons \nwithin a jurisdiction, then of course there can be no Eighth \nAmendment impediment to enforcing laws against sleeping \nand camping in public, because those persons engaging in \nsuch activities cannot be said to have “no option of sleeping \nindoors.”  Id.  But “so long as there is a greater number of \nhomeless individuals in a jurisdiction than the number of \navailable beds in shelters, the jurisdiction cannot prosecute \nhomeless individuals for involuntarily sitting, lying, and \nsleeping  in  public.”    Id.  (simplified)  (emphasis  added).  \nConsistent with Justice White’s concurrence, the Martin \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 63 of 155\n  JOHNSON V.

(citation omitted), the specific \nindividual  circumstances  of  the  defendant  must  be \nconsidered.  Thus, Martin explained, the panel’s “holding \ndoes not cover individuals who do have access to adequate \ntemporary shelter, whether because they have the means to \npay for it or because it is realistically available to them for \nfree, but who choose not to use it.”  Id. at 617 n.8.  But \nMartin held that, where it is shown that homeless persons \n“do not have a single place where they can lawfully be,” an \nordinance against sleeping or camping in public, “as applied \nto them, effectively punish[es] them for something for which \nthey may not be convicted under the Eighth Amendment.”  \nId.  at  617  (simplified).    Concluding  that  the  remaining \nplaintiffs had “demonstrated a genuine issue of material \nfact” as to their lack of any access to indoor shelter, Martin \nreversed the district court’s grant of summary judgment to \nthe City.

CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nIn an August 2019 order, the district court certified a \nclass seeking declaratory and injunctive relief with respect \nto Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claims, pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).5  As defined in the court’s \norder, the class consists of “[a]ll involuntarily homeless \nindividuals  living  in  Grants  Pass,  Oregon,  including \nhomeless  individuals  who  sometimes  sleep  outside  city \nlimits to avoid harassment and punishment by Defendant as \naddressed in this lawsuit.”     \nAfter  the  parties  filed  cross-motions  for  summary \njudgment, the district court in July 2020 granted Plaintiffs’ \nmotion in relevant part and denied the City’s motion.  The \ndistrict court held that, under Martin, the City’s enforcement \nof the above-described ordinances violated the Cruel and \nUnusual Punishments Clause.    The court further held that, \nfor similar reasons, the ordinances imposed excessive fines \n \nindividual from a City park for a period of 30 days, if within a \none-year period the individual: \nA. Is issued two or more citations in the same City park \nfor  violating  regulations  related  to  City  park \nproperties, or \nB. Is issued one or more citations for violating any \nstate law(s) while on City park property.  \nThe foregoing exclusion order shall only apply to the particular \nCity park in which the offending conduct under 6.46.350(A) or \n6.46.350(B) occurred. \n5 At the time that the district court certified the class, the operative \ncomplaint was the Second Amended Complaint.  That complaint was \nmaterially  comparable  to  the  Third  Amended  Complaint,  with  the \nexception that it did not mention the park-exclusion ordinance or seek \ninjunctive relief with respect to it. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 67 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    67 \nin violation of the Eighth Amendment’s Excessive Fines \nClause.   \nAfter Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed those claims as to \nwhich summary judgment had been denied to both sides, the \ndistrict court entered final judgment declaring that the City’s \nenforcement  of  the  anti-camping  and  anti-sleeping \nordinances  (GPMC  §§ 5.61.020,  5.61.030,  6.46.090) \nviolates “the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel \nand  unusual  punishment”  and  its  “prohibition  against \nexcessive fines.”  Nonetheless, the court’s final injunctive \nrelief did not prohibit all enforcement of these provisions.  \nEnforcement of § 5.61.020 (the anti-sleeping ordinance) was \nnot enjoined at all.  The City was enjoined from enforcing \nthe  anti-camping  ordinances  (GPMC  §§ 5.61.030  and \n6.46.090) “without first giving a person a warning of at least \n24 hours before enforcement.”  It was further enjoined from \nenforcing those ordinances, and a related ordinance against \ncriminal trespass on city property, in all but one City park \nduring specified evening and overnight hours, which varied \ndepending upon the time of year.  Finally, the City was \nenjoined from enforcing the park-exclusion ordinance.6 \n \n6  The district  court’s  summary  judgment  order  and  judgment  also \ndeclared that a separate ordinance (GPMC § 6.46.355), which addressed \nthe procedures for appealing park-exclusion orders under § 6.46.350, \nfailed to provide sufficient procedural due process.  The parties dispute \nwhether this claim was adequately raised and reached below, but as the \nmajority notes, this claim for purely prospective relief has been mooted \nby the City’s subsequent amendment of § 6.46.355 in a way that removes \nthe features that had led to its invalidation.  See Opin. at 55.  Accordingly, \nthis aspect of the district court’s judgment should be vacated and \nremanded with instructions to dismiss as moot Plaintiffs’ challenge to \n§ 6.46.355. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 68 of 155\n68  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nThe City timely appealed from that judgment and from \nthe district court’s subsequent award of attorneys’ fees. \nII \nBefore turning to the merits, I first address the question \nof our jurisdiction under Article  III of the Constitution.  \nPlains Com. Bank v. Long Family Land & Cattle Co., 554 \nU.S.  316,  324  (2008)  (holding  that  courts  “bear  an \nindependent  obligation  to  assure  [them]selves  that \njurisdiction is proper before proceeding to the merits”). \n“In  limiting  the  judicial  power  to  ‘Cases’  and \n‘Controversies,’ Article III of the Constitution restricts it to \nthe traditional role of Anglo-American courts, which is to \nredress or prevent actual or imminently threatened injury to \npersons  caused  by  private  or  official  violation  of  law.”  \nSummers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 492 (2009).  \n“The doctrine of standing is one of several doctrines that \nreflect this fundamental limitation,” and in the context of a \nrequest for prospective injunctive or declaratory relief, that \ndoctrine requires a plaintiff to “show that he is under threat \nof  suffering  ‘injury  in  fact’  that  is  concrete  and \nparticularized; the threat must be actual and imminent, not \nconjectural or hypothetical; it must be fairly traceable to the \nchallenged action of the defendant; and it must be likely that \na favorable judicial decision will prevent or redress the \ninjury.”  Id. at 493.  The requirement to show an actual threat \nof imminent injury-in-fact in order to obtain prospective \nrelief  is  a  demanding  one:  the  Supreme  Court  has \n“repeatedly  reiterated  that  threatened  injury  must  be \ncertainly impending to constitute injury in fact, and that \nallegations  of  possible  future  injury  are  not  sufficient.”  \nClapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S 398, 409 (2013) \n(simplified).    \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 69 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    69 \nAs “an indispensable part of the plaintiff’s case,” each of \nthese elements of Article III standing “must be supported in \nthe same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears \nthe burden of proof, i.e., with the manner and degree of \nevidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.”  \nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  \nBecause,  as  in  Lujan,  this  case  arises  from  a  grant  of \nsummary  judgment,  the  question  is  whether,  in  seeking \nsummary judgment, Plaintiffs “‘set forth’ by affidavit or \nother evidence ‘specific facts’” in support of each element \nof standing.  Id. (citation omitted).  Moreover, “standing is \nnot  dispensed  in  gross,”  and  therefore  “a  plaintiff  must \ndemonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press.”  \nDaimlerChrysler  Corp.  v.  Cuno,  547  U.S.  332,  352–53 \n(2006) (emphasis added) (citation omitted). \nPlaintiffs’ operative complaint named three individual \nplaintiffs  as  class  representatives  (John  Logan,  Gloria \nJohnson, and Debra Blake), and we have jurisdiction to \naddress the merits of a particular claim if any one of them \nsufficiently established Article III standing as to that claim.  \nSee Secretary of the Interior v. California, 464 U.S. 312, 319 \nn.3 (1984) (“Since the State of California clearly does have \nstanding, we need not address the standing of the other \n[plaintiffs], whose position here is identical to the State’s.”); \nsee also Bates v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 511 F.3d 974, \n985 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (“In a class action, standing is \nsatisfied  if  at  least  one  named  plaintiff  meets  the \nrequirements.”).  Accordingly, I address the showing made \nby each named Plaintiff in support of summary judgment. \nIn my view, Plaintiff John Logan failed to establish that \nhe  has  standing  to  challenge  any  of  the  ordinances  in \nquestion.  In support of his motion for summary judgment, \nLogan  submitted  a  half-page  declaration  stating,  in \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 70 of 155\n70  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nconclusory fashion, that he is “involuntarily homeless in \nGrants Pass,” but that he is “sleeping in [his] truck at night \nat a rest stop North of Grants Pass.”  He asserted that he \n“cannot sleep in the City of Grants Pass for fear that [he] will \nbe awakened, ticketed, fined, moved along, trespassed[,] and \ncharged with Criminal Trespass.”  Logan also previously \nsubmitted  two  declarations  in  support  of  his  class \ncertification motion.  In them, Logan stated that he has been \nhomeless in Grants Pass for nearly seven of the last 10 years; \nthat there have been occasions in the past in which police in \nGrants Pass have awakened him in his car and instructed him \nto move on; and that he now generally sleeps in his truck \noutside of Grants Pass.  Logan has made no showing that, \nover the seven years that he has been homeless, he has ever \nbeen  issued  a  citation  for  violating  the  challenged \nordinances, nor has he provided any facts to establish either \nthat the threat of such a citation is “certainly impending” or \nthat “there is a substantial risk” that he may be issued a \ncitation.  Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, \n158 (2014) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  \nAt best, his declarations suggest that he would prefer to sleep \nin his truck within the City limits rather than outside them, \nand that he is subjectively deterred from doing so due to the \nCity’s ordinances.  But such “[a]llegations of a subjective \n‘chill’ are not an adequate substitute for a claim of specific \npresent objective harm or a threat of specific future harm.”  \nLaird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 13–14 (1972).  Nor has Logan \nprovided any facts that would show that he has any actual \nintention or plans to stay overnight in the City.  See Lopez v. \nCandaele, 630 F.3d 775, 787 (9th Cir. 2010) (“[W]e have \nconcluded  that  pre-enforcement  plaintiffs  who  failed  to \nallege a concrete intent to violate the challenged law could \nnot establish a credible threat of enforcement.”).  Even if his \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 71 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    71 \ndeclarations could be generously construed as asserting an \nintention to stay in the City at some future point, “[s]uch \n‘some day’ intentions—without any description of concrete \nplans, or indeed even any specification of when the some day \nwill be—do not support a finding of the ‘actual or imminent’ \ninjury that [the Court’s] cases require.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n564;  cf.  Driehaus,  573  U.S.  at  161  (permitting  pre-\nenforcement  challenge  against  ordinance  regulating \nelection-related  speech  where  plaintiffs’  allegations \nidentified “specific statements they intend[ed] to make in \nfuture election cycles”).  And, contrary to what the majority \nsuggests,  see  Opin.  at  30–31  n.16,  Logan’s  vaguely \ndescribed  knowledge  about  what  has  happened  to  other \npeople cannot establish his standing.  Accordingly, Logan \nfailed  to  carry  his  burden  to  establish  standing  for  the \nprospective relief he seeks. \nBy contrast, Plaintiff Gloria Johnson made a sufficient \nshowing that she has standing to challenge the general anti-\ncamping ordinance, GPMC § 5.61.030, and the parks anti-\ncamping ordinance, GPMC § 6.46.090.  Although Johnson’s \nearlier declaration in support of class certification stated that \nshe “often” sleeps in her van outside the City limits, she also \nstated that she “continue[s] to live without shelter in Grants \nPass” and that, consequently, “[a]t any time, I could be \narrested, ticketed, fined, and prosecuted for sleeping outside \nin my van or for covering myself with a blanket to stay \nwarm” (emphasis added).  Her declaration also recounts \n“dozens of occasions” in which the anti-camping ordinances \nhave been enforced against her, either by instructions to \n“move along” or, in one instance, by issuance of a citation \nfor  violating  the  parks  anti-camping  ordinance,  GPMC \n§ 6.46.090.  Because Johnson presented facts showing that \nshe continues to violate the anti-camping ordinances and \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 72 of 155\n72  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nthat, in light of past enforcement, she faces a credible threat \nof future enforcement, she has standing to challenge those \nordinances.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564.  Johnson, however, \npresented no facts that would establish standing to challenge \neither the anti-sleeping ordinance (which, unlike the anti-\ncamping ordinances, does not apply to sleeping in a vehicle), \nthe  park-exclusion  ordinance,  or  the  criminal  trespass \nordinance.7 \nDebra Blake sufficiently established her standing, both \nin connection with the class certification motion and the \nsummary  judgment  motion.    Although  she  was  actually \n \n7 The majority concludes that Johnson’s standing to challenge the anti-\ncamping ordinances necessarily establishes her standing to challenge the \npark-exclusion and criminal-trespass ordinances.  See Opin. at 30 n.15.  \nBut as the district court explained, the undisputed evidence concerning \nGrants Pass’s enforcement policies established that “Grants Pass first \nissues fines for violations and then either issues a trespass order or \nexcludes  persons  from  all  parks  before  a  person  is  charged  with \nmisdemeanor criminal trespass” (emphasis added).  Although Johnson’s \ncontinued intention to sleep in her vehicle in Grants Pass gives her \nstanding to challenge the anti-camping ordinances, Johnson has wholly \nfailed to plead any facts to show, inter alia, that she intends to engage in \nthe further conduct that might expose her to a “credible threat” of \nprosecution under the park-exclusion or criminal trespass ordinances.  \nDriehaus, 573 U.S. at 159 (citation omitted).  Johnson’s declaration \nstates that she has been homeless in Grants Pass for three years, but it \ndoes not contend that she has ever been issued, or threatened with \nissuance of, a trespass order, a park-exclusion order, or a criminal \ntrespass charge or that she has “an intention to engage in a course of \nconduct” that would lead to such an order or charge.  Id. (citation \nomitted).    Because  “standing  is  not  dispensed  in  gross,”  see \nDaimlerChrysler, 547 U.S. at 353 (citation omitted), Johnson must \nseparately establish her standing with respect to each ordinance, and she \nhas failed to do so with respect to the park-exclusion and criminal-\ntrespass ordinances. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 73 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    73 \nliving in temporary housing at the time she submitted her \ndeclarations in support of class certification in March and \nJune 2019, she explained that that temporary housing would \nsoon expire; that she would become homeless in Grants Pass \nagain; and that she would therefore again be subject to being \n“arrested, ticketed and prosecuted for sleeping outside or for \ncovering myself with a blanket to stay warm.”  And, as her \ndeclaration at summary judgment showed, that is exactly \nwhat  happened:  in  September  2019,  she  was  cited  for \nsleeping  in  the  park  in  violation  of  GPMC  § 6.46.090, \nconvicted, and fined.  Her declarations also confirmed that \nBlake’s persistence in sleeping and camping in a variety of \nplaces in Grants Pass had also resulted in a park-exclusion \norder (which she successfully appealed), and in citations for \nviolation of the anti-sleeping ordinance, GPMC § 5.61.020 \n(for sleeping in an alley), and for criminal trespass on City \nproperty.  Based on this showing, I conclude that Blake \nestablished standing to challenge each of the ordinances at \nissue in the district court’s judgment.   \nHowever, Blake subsequently passed away during this \nlitigation,  as  her  counsel  noted  in  a  letter  to  this  court \nsubmitted under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 43(a).  \nBecause  the  only  relief  she  sought  was  prospective \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, Blake’s death moots her \nclaims.  King v. County of Los Angeles, 885 F.3d 548, 553, \n559 (9th Cir. 2018).

Under Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393 \n(1975), the answer to that question would appear to be no.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 74 of 155\n74  JOHNSON V.

See Sosna, \n419 U.S. at 403 (holding that a previously proper class representative \nwhose claims had become moot on appeal could continue to represent \nthe class for purposes of that appeal); see also Bates, 511 F.3d at 987 \n(emphasizing that the named plaintiff “had standing at the time of \ncertification”); B.K. ex rel.

As noted \nearlier, we have jurisdiction to address all claims concerning \nthe two anti-camping ordinances, as to which Johnson has \nsufficient standing to represent the certified class.

CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nA \n“To obtain certification of a plaintiff class under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23, a plaintiff must satisfy both the \nfour  requirements  of  Rule  23(a)—‘numerosity, \ncommonality, typicality, and adequate representation’—and \n‘one of the three requirements listed in Rule 23(b).’”  A.B. v. \nHawaii State Dep’t of Educ., 30 F.4th 828, 834 (9th Cir. \n2022) (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. \n338, 345, 349 (2011)).  Commonality, which is contested \nhere, requires a showing that the class members’ claims \n“depend upon a common contention” that is “of such a \nnature  that  it  is  capable  of  classwide  resolution—which \nmeans that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve \nan issue that is central to the validity of each one of the \nclaims in one stroke.”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350.  In finding \nthat commonality was satisfied with respect to the Eighth \nAmendment claims, the district court relied solely on the \npremise that whether the City’s conduct “violates the Eighth \nAmendment” was a common question that could be resolved \non a classwide basis.  And in finding that Rule 23(b) was \nsatisfied  here,  the  district  court  relied  solely  on  Rule \n23(b)(2),  which  provides  that  a  “class  action  may  be \nmaintained” if “the party opposing the class has acted or \nrefused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so \nthat final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief \nis appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  FED. R. CIV. \nP. 23(b)(2).  That requirement was satisfied, the district court \nconcluded,  because  (for  reasons  similar  to  those  that \nunderlay its commonality analysis) the City’s challenged \nenforcement of the ordinances “applies equally to all class \nmembers.”    The  district  court’s  commonality  and  Rule \n23(b)(2) analyses are both flawed because they are based on \nan incorrect understanding of our decision in Martin. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 77 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    77 \nAs the earlier discussion of Martin makes clear, the \nEighth Amendment theory adopted in that case requires an \nindividualized  inquiry  in  order  to  assess  whether  any \nindividuals to whom the challenged ordinances are being \napplied  “do  have  access  to  adequate  temporary  shelter, \nwhether because they have the means to pay for it or because \nit is realistically available to them for free, but who choose \nnot to use it.”  920 F.3d at 617 n.8.  See supra at 61–63.  Only \nwhen persons “do not have a single place where they can \nlawfully be,” can it be said that an ordinance against sleeping \nor  camping  in  public,  “as  applied  to  them,  effectively \npunish[es] them for something for which they may not be \nconvicted  under  the  Eighth  Amendment.”    Id.  at  617 \n(simplified) (emphasis added).   \nOf  course,  such  an  individualized  inquiry  is  not \nrequired—and no Eighth Amendment violation occurs under \nMartin—when the defendant can show that there is adequate \nshelter  space  to  house  all  homeless  persons  in  the \njurisdiction.  Id.  But the converse is not true—the mere fact \nthat a city’s shelters are full does not by itself establish, \nwithout more, that any particular person who is sleeping in \npublic does “not have a single place where [he or she] can \nlawfully be.”  Id.  The logic of Martin, and of the opinions \nin Powell on which it is based, requires an assessment of a \nperson’s individual situation before it can be said that the \nEighth  Amendment  would  be  violated  by  applying  a \nparticular provision against that person.  Indeed, the opinions \nin  Powell  on  which  Martin  relied—Justice  White’s \nconcurring  opinion  and  the  opinion  of  the  dissenting \nJustices—all agreed that, at most, the Eighth Amendment \nprovided  a  case-specific  affirmative  defense  that  would \nrequire the defendant to provide a “satisfactor[y] showing \nthat it was not feasible for him to have made arrangements” \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 78 of 155\n78  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nto avoid the conduct at issue.  Powell, 392 U.S. at 552 \n(White, J., concurring); id. at 568 n.31 (Fortas, J., dissenting) \n(agreeing with Justice White that the issue is whether the \ndefendant “on the occasion in question” had shown that \navoiding the conduct was “impossible”); see also supra at \n59–60.9 \nIn light of this understanding of Martin, the district court \nclearly erred in finding that the requirement of commonality \nwas met here.  “What matters to class certification is not the \nraising of common ‘questions’—even in droves—but rather, \nthe capacity of a class-wide proceeding to generate common \nanswers  apt  to  drive  the  resolution  of  the  litigation.  \nDissimilarities within the proposed class are what have the \npotential to impede the generation of common answers.”  \n \n9 The majority incorrectly contends that the dissenters in Powell did not \nendorse Justice White’s conclusion that the defendant bears the burden \nto establish that his or her conduct was involuntary.  See Opin. at 48–51.  \nOn the contrary, the Powell dissenters’ entire argument rested on the \naffirmative “constitutional defense” presented at the trial in that case and \non the findings made by the trial court in connection with that defense.  \nSee 392 U.S. at 558 (Fortas, J., dissenting).  The majority’s suggestion \nthat I have taken that explicit reference to Powell’s defense “out of \ncontext,” see Opin. at 49 n.29, is demonstrably wrong—the context of \nthe case was precisely the extensive affirmative defense that Powell \npresented at trial, including the testimony of an expert.  See 392 U.S. at \n517–26 (plurality) (summarizing the testimony).  And, of course, in \nMartin, the issue was raised in the context of a § 1983 action in which \nthe  plaintiffs  challenging  the  laws  bore  the  burden  to  prove  the \ninvoluntariness of their relevant conduct.  The majority points to nothing \nthat would plausibly support the view that Powell and Martin might \nrequire the government to carry the burden to establish voluntariness.  \nSee Opin. at 50 n.31 (leaving this issue open).  The majority claims that \nit can sidestep this issue here, but that is also wrong: the burden issue is \ncritical  both  to  the  class-certification  analysis  and  to  the  issue  of \nsummary judgment on the merits.  See infra at 78–89. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 79 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    79 \nWal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350 (simplified).  Under Martin, the \nanswer to the question whether the City’s enforcement of \neach of the anti-camping ordinances violates the Eighth \nAmendment turns on the individual circumstances of each \nperson to whom the ordinance is being applied on a given \noccasion.    That  question  is  simply  not  one  that  can  be \nresolved, on a common basis, “in one stroke.”  Id.  That \nrequires decertification. \nFor  similar  reasons,  the  district  court  also  erred  in \nconcluding that the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) were met.  \nBy  its  terms,  Rule  23(b)(2)  is  satisfied  only  if  (1) the \ndefendant has acted (or refused to act) on grounds that are \ngenerally applicable to the class as whole and (2) as a result, \nfinal classwide or injunctive relief is appropriate.  As the \nSupreme Court has observed, “[t]he key to the (b)(2) class is \n‘the  indivisible  nature  of  the  injunctive  or  declaratory \nremedy warranted—the notion that the conduct is such that \nit can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the \nclass members or as to none of them.’”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. \nat  360.    It  follows  that,  when  the  wrongfulness  of  the \nchallenged  conduct  with  respect  to  any  particular  class \nmember  depends  critically  upon  the  individual \ncircumstances of that class member, a class action under \nRule 23(b)(2) is not appropriate.  In such a case, in which \n(for example) the challenged enforcement of a particular law \nmay be lawful as to some persons and not as to others, \ndepending upon their individual circumstances, the all-or-\nnothing determination of wrongfulness that is the foundation \nof a (b)(2) class is absent: in such a case, it is simply not true \nthat the defendant’s “conduct is such that it can be enjoined \nor declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or \nas to none of them.’”  Id. (emphasis added).   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 80 of 155\n80  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nBecause Martin requires an assessment of each person’s \nindividual  circumstances  in  order  to  determine  whether \napplication of the challenged ordinances violates the Eighth \nAmendment, these standards for the application of Rule \n23(b)(2) were plainly not met in this case.  That is, because \nthe applicable law governing Plaintiffs’ claims would entail \n“a  process  through  which  highly  individualized \ndeterminations  of  liability  and  remedy  are  made,” \ncertification of a class under Rule 23(b)(2) is improper.  \nJamie S. v. Milwaukee Pub. Sch., 668 F.3d 481, 499 (7th Cir. \n2012).  Moreover, the mere fact that the district court’s final \njudgment  imposes  sweeping  across-the-board  injunctive \nrelief that disregards individual differences in determining \nthe defendant’s liability does not mean that Rule 23(b)(2) \nhas been satisfied.  The rule requires that any such classwide \nrelief be rooted in a determination of classwide liability—\nthe defendant must have acted, or be acting, unlawfully “on \ngrounds  that  apply  generally  to  the  class,  so  that  final \ninjunctive or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate \nrespecting the class as a whole.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(2) \n(emphasis added).  That requirement was not established \nhere, and the class must be decertified. 10 \n \n10 The majority wrongly concludes that the City has forfeited any \nargument  concerning  Rule  23(b)(2)  because  it  did  not  specifically \nmention that subdivision of the rule in its opening brief.  Opin. at 41.  \nThis “Simon Says” approach to reading briefs is wrong.  The substance \nof the argument is contained in the opening brief, in which the City \nexplicitly  contended  that  Martin  requires  “a  more  individualized \nanalysis” than the district court applied and that, as a result, “neither FED. \nR. CIV. P. 23 nor Martin provide plaintiffs the ability to establish the type \nof sweeping class-wide claims advanced in this case.”  Indeed, Plaintiffs \nthemselves responded to this argument, in their answering brief, by \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 81 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    81 \nB \nThe majority provides two responses to this analysis, but \nboth of them are wrong.   \nFirst, the majority contends that Martin established a \nbright-line  rule  that  the  government  cannot  prosecute \n“involuntarily homeless persons for sleeping in public”—or, \npresumably, for camping—“if there are no other public areas \nor appropriate shelters where those individuals can sleep.”  \nSee Opin. at 19.  As the majority makes clear, that latter \ninquiry into available shelter space turns on whether “the \nnumber of homeless persons outnumber the available shelter \nbeds,” except that, “[w]hen assessing the number of shelter \nspaces,” shelters that have a “mandatory religious focus” are \nnot to be counted.  See Opin. at 13, 19 (citation omitted).  \nMoreover, although the majority’s phrasing pays lip service \nto the fact that the persons at issue must be “involuntarily \nhomeless,” the majority also explicitly rejects the City’s \ncontention that “the holding of Martin can only be applied \nafter an individualized inquiry of each alleged involuntarily \nhomeless person’s access to shelter.”  See Opin. at 35.  The \nnet result, for class certification purposes, is that any issue of \nindividualized involuntariness is set aside and Martin is \nthereby reduced to a simplistic formula—to be resolved on a \nclasswide  basis—into  whether  the  number  of  homeless \npersons in the jurisdiction exceeds the number of available \nshelter beds.  See Opin. at 34–35, 38.   \nThe majority’s analysis fails, because Martin does not \nallow the individualized inquiry into involuntariness to be \nset  aside  in  this  way.    Martin  states  that,  if  there  are \n \nexplaining why they believe that the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) were \nmet. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 82 of 155\n82  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \ninsufficient available beds at shelters, then a jurisdiction \n“cannot prosecute homeless individuals for ‘involuntarily \nsitting, lying, and sleeping in public.’”  920 F.3d at 617 \n(emphasis added).  The lack of adequate shelter beds thus \nmerely eliminates a safe-harbor that might otherwise have \nallowed  a  jurisdiction  to  prosecute  violations  of  such \nordinances without regard to individual circumstances, with \nthe result that the  jurisdiction’s enforcement power will \ninstead depend upon whether the conduct of the individual \non a particular occasion was “involuntar[y].”  Id.  Martin \nconfirms that the resulting inquiry turns on whether the \npersons in question have access to “a single place where they \ncan  lawfully  be,”  id.  at  617  (emphasis  added)  (citation \nomitted),  and  not  just  on  whether  they  have  access  to \n“appropriate  shelters” or “other public areas.”   And the \nmajority’s misreading of Martin completely disregards the \nPowell  opinions  on  which  Martin  relied,  which  make \nunmistakably  clear  that  an  individualized  showing  of \ninvoluntariness is required.   \nSecond, and relatedly, the majority states that, to the \nextent that Martin requires such an individualized showing \nto  establish  an  Eighth  Amendment  violation,  any  such \nindividualized issue here has been eliminated by the fact that \n“[p]ursuant to the class definition, the class includes only \ninvoluntarily homeless persons.”  See Opin. at 38–40 (first \nemphasis added).  As the majority acknowledges, “[p]ersons \nare involuntarily homeless” under Martin only “if they do \nnot ‘have access to adequate temporary shelter,’” such as, \nfor example, when they lack “‘the means to pay for it’” and \nit is otherwise not “‘realistically available to them for free.’”  \nOpin. at 14 n.2 (quoting Martin, 920 F.3d at  617 n.8).  \nBecause that individualized issue has been shifted into the \nclass definition, the majority holds, the City’s enforcement \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 83 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    83 \nof the challenged ordinances against that class can in that \nsense be understood to present a “common question” that \ncan be resolved in one stroke.  According to the majority, \nbecause the class definition requires that, at the time the \nordinances are applied against them, the class members must \nbe  “involuntarily  homeless”  in  the  sense  that  Martin \nrequires, there is a common question as to whether “the \nCity’s enforcement of the anti-camping ordinances against \nall involuntarily homeless individuals violates the Eighth \nAmendment.”  See Opin. at 38–39 & n.22. \nThe  majority  cites  no  authority  for  this  audacious \nbootstrap argument.  If a person’s individual circumstances \nare such that he or she has no “access to adequate temporary \nshelter”—which necessarily subsumes (among other things) \nthe determination that there are no shelter beds available—\nthen the entire (highly individualized) question of the City’s \nliability to that person under Martin’s standards has been \nshifted into the class definition.  That is wholly improper.  \nSee Olean Wholesale Grocery Coop. v. Bumble Bee Foods, \n31 F.4th 651, 670 n.14 (9th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (“A court \nmay not . . . create a ‘fail safe’ class that is defined to include \nonly those individuals who were injured by the allegedly \nunlawful  conduct.”);  see  also  Ruiz  Torres  v.  Mercer \nCanyons Inc., 835 F.3d 1125, 1138 n.7 (9th Cir. 2016) \n(stating that it would be improper to define a class in such a \nway “as to preclude membership unless the liability of the \ndefendant is established” (simplified)).   \nThe majority nonetheless insists that “[m]embership in \n[the] class” here “has no connection to the success of the \nunderlying claims.”  See Opin. at 39 n.23.  That is obviously \nfalse.  As I have explained, Martin’s understanding of when \na person “involuntarily” lacks “access to adequate temporary \nshelter” or to “a single place where [he or she] can lawfully \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 84 of 155\n84  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nbe,” see 920 F.3d at 617 & n.8 (citations omitted), requires \nan  individualized  inquiry  into  a  given  person’s \ncircumstances at a particular moment.  By insisting that a \ncommon  question  exists  here  because  Martin’s \ninvoluntariness  standard  has  been  folded  into  the  class \ndefinition, the majority is unavoidably relying on a fail-safe \nclass  definition  that  improperly  subsumes  this  crucial \nindividualized merits issue into the class definition.  The \nmajority’s artifice renders the limitations of Rule 23 largely \nillusory.11  \nTo the extent that the majority instead suggests that the \nclass definition requires only an involuntary lack of access \nto regular or permanent shelter to qualify as “involuntarily \nhomeless,” its argument collapses for a different reason.  \nBecause Martin’s Eighth Amendment holding applies only \nto  those  who  involuntarily  lack  “access  to  adequate \ntemporary shelter” on a given occasion, see 920 F.3d at 617 \nn.8, such an understanding of the class definition would not \n \n11  The  majority  contends  that,  despite  the  presence  of  a  liability-\ndetermining individualized issue in the class definition, there is no fail-\nsafe class here because one or more of the claims might still conceivably \nfail on the merits for other reasons.  See Opin. at 39 n.23.  But the \nmajority does not identify any such other reasons and, of course, under \nthe majority’s view of the substantive law, there are none.  But more \nimportantly, the majority is simply wrong in positing that the only type \nof class that would qualify as an impermissible fail-safe class is one in \nwhich every conceivable merits issue in the litigation has been folded \ninto the class definition.  What matters is whether the class definition \nfolds within it any bootstrapping merits issue (such as the “injur[y]” issue \nmentioned in Olean) as to which “a class member either wins or, by \nvirtue of losing, is defined out of the class and is therefore not bound by \nthe judgment.”  Olean, 31 F.4th at 670 n.14 (citation omitted).  To the \nextent that the central individualized merits issue in this case has been \nfolded into the class definition, that defect is present here. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 85 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    85 \nbe sufficient to eliminate the highly individualized inquiry \ninto whether a particular person lacked such access at a given \nmoment, and the class would then have to be decertified for \nthe reasons I have discussed earlier.  See supra at 75–80.  Put \nsimply, the majority cannot have it both ways: either the \nclass  definition  is  co-extensive  with  Martin’s \ninvoluntariness  concept  (in  which  case  the  class  is  an \nimproper fail-safe class) or the class definition differs from \nthe Martin standard (in which case Martin’s individualized \ninquiry requires decertification). \nIV \nGiven  these  conclusions  as  to  standing  and  class \ncertification, all that remains are the individual claims of \nJohnson for prospective relief against enforcement of the \ntwo anti-camping ordinances.  In my view, these claims fail \nas a matter of law. \nJohnson’s sole basis for challenging these ordinances is \nthat they prohibit her from sleeping in her van within the \nCity.  In her declaration in support of class certification, \nhowever, Johnson specifically stated that she has “often” \nbeen able to sleep in her van by parking outside the City \nlimits.  In a supplemental declaration in support of summary \njudgment, she affirmed that these facts “remain true,” but \nshe added that there had also been occasions in which, \noutside the City limits, county officers had told her to “move \non” when she “was parked on county roads” and that, when \nshe  parked  “on  BLM  land”—i.e.,  land  managed  by  the \nfederal Bureau of Land Management—she was told that she \n“could only stay on BLM for a few days.” \nAs an initial matter, Johnson’s declaration provides no \nnon-conclusory basis for finding that she lacks any option \nother than sleeping in her van.  Although her declaration \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 86 of 155\n86  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nnotes that she worked as a nurse “for decades” and that she \nnow collects social security benefits, the declaration simply \nstates, without saying anything further about her present \neconomic situation, that she “cannot afford housing.”  Her \ndeclaration also says nothing about where she lived before \nshe began living “on the street” a few years ago, and it says \nnothing about whether she has any friends or family, in \nGrants Pass or elsewhere, who might be able to provide \nassistance.12  And even assuming that this factual showing \nwould be sufficient to permit a trier of fact to find that \nJohnson lacks any realistic option other than sleeping in her \nvan, we cannot affirm the district court’s summary judgment \nin Johnson’s favor without holding that her showing was so \noverwhelming that she should prevail as a matter of law.  \nBecause a reasonable trier of fact could find, in light of these \nevidentiary gaps, that Johnson failed to carry her burden of \nproof on this preliminary point, summary judgment in her \nfavor was improper.13 \n \n12 The majority dismisses these questions about the sufficiency of \nJohnson’s evidentiary showing as “artificial limitations” on claims under \nMartin, see Opin. at 51, but the standard for establishing an Eighth \nAmendment violation under Martin and the Powell opinions on which it \nrelies is a demanding and individualized one, and we are obligated to \nfollow  it.    Indeed,  in  upholding  Powell’s  conviction  for  public \ndrunkenness, the controlling opinion of Justice White probed the details \nof the record as to whether, in light of the fact that Powell “had a home \nand wife,” he could have “made plans while sober to prevent ending up \nin a public place,” and whether, despite his chronic alcoholism, he \n“retained the power to stay off or leave the streets, and simply preferred \nto be there rather than elsewhere.”  392 U.S. at 553. \n13 The majority errs by instead counting all gaps in the evidentiary record \nagainst the City, faulting it for what the majority thinks the City has \nfailed to “demonstrate[],”  See Opin. at 52 & n.32.  That is contrary to \nwell-settled law.  See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986) \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 87 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    87 \nBut even assuming that Johnson had established that she \ntruly  has  no  option  other  than  sleeping  in  her  van,  her \nshowing  is  still  insufficient  to  establish  an  Eighth \nAmendment violation.  As noted, Johnson’s sole complaint \nin this case is that, by enforcing the anti-camping ordinances, \nthe City will not let her sleep in her van.  But the sparse facts \nshe  has  presented  fail  to  establish  that  she  lacks  any \nalternative place where she could park her van and sleep in \nit.  On the contrary, her factual showing establishes that the \nBLM will let her do so on BLM land for a “few days” at a \ntime and that she also has “often” been able to do so on \ncounty  land.    Given  that  Johnson  has  failed  to  present \nsufficient evidence to show that she lacks alternatives that \nwould allow her to avoid violating the City’s anti-camping \nordinances, she has not established that the conduct for \nwhich the City would punish her is involuntary such that, \nunder Martin and the Powell opinions on which Martin \nrelies, it would violate the Eighth Amendment to enforce that \nprohibition against her.   \nIn nonetheless finding that the anti-camping ordinances’ \nprohibition  on  sleeping  in  vehicles  violates  the  Eighth \nAmendment, the majority apparently relies on the premise \nthat the question of whether an individual has options for \navoiding violations of the challenged law must be limited to \nalternatives that are within the City limits.  Under this view, \nif a large homeless shelter with 1,000 vacant beds were \n \n(holding that a movant’s summary judgment motion should be granted \n“against a [nonmovant] who fails to make a showing sufficient to \nestablish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and \non which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial”).  The \nmajority’s analysis also belies its implausible claim that it has not shifted \nthe burden to the City to establish the voluntariness of the behavior \ntargeted by the ordinances.  See supra at 78 n.9. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 88 of 155\n88  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nopened a block outside the City’s limits, the City would still \nbe required by the Eighth Amendment to allow hundreds of \npeople to sleep in their vans in the City and, presumably, in \nthe City’s public parks as well.  Nothing in law or logic \nsupports such a conclusion.  Martin says that anti-sleeping \nordinances  may  be  enforced,  consistent  with  the  Eighth \nAmendment, so long as there is a “single place where [the \nperson] can lawfully be,” 920 F.2d at 617 (emphasis added) \n(citation  omitted),  and  Justice  White’s  concurrence  in \nPowell confirms that the Eighth Amendment does not bar \nenforcement of a law when the defendant has failed to show \nthat avoiding the violative conduct is “impossible,” 392 U.S. \nat 551 (emphasis added).14  Nothing in the rationale of this \nEighth Amendment theory suggests that the inquiry into \nwhether  it  is  “impossible”  for  the  defendant  to  avoid \nviolating the law must be artificially constrained to only \nthose particular options that suit the defendant’s geographic \nor other preferences.  To be sure, Johnson states that having \nto drive outside the City limits costs her money for gas, but \nthat does not provide any basis for concluding that the option \nis infeasible or that she has thereby suffered “cruel and \nunusual punishment.”   \nFinally,  because  the  district  court’s  reliance  on  the \nExcessive Fines Clause was predicated on the comparable \nview that the challenged ordinances punish “status and not \nconduct” in violation of Robinson, that ruling was flawed for \nthe same reasons.  And because Johnson provides no other \n \n14 The majority complains that this standard is too high, see Opin. at 52, \nbut it is the standard applied in Martin and in the Powell opinions on \nwhich Martin relied.   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 89 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    89 \nbasis for  finding an Excessive  Fines  violation  here, her \nclaims under that clause also fail as a matter of law. \nV \nAccordingly, I would remand this case with instructions \n(1) to dismiss as moot the claims of Debra Blake as well as \nPlaintiffs’ claims with respect to GPMC § 6.46.355; (2) to \ndismiss the claims of John Logan for lack of Article III \nstanding;  (3) to  dismiss  the  remaining  claims  of  Gloria \nJohnson for lack of Article III standing, except to the extent \nthat she challenges the two anti-camping ordinances (GPMC \n§§ 5.61.030, 6.46.090); (4) to decertify the class; and (5) to \ngrant summary judgment to the City, and against Johnson, \nwith respect to her challenges to the City’s anti-camping \nordinances  under  the  Eighth  Amendment’s  Cruel  and \nUnusual Punishments Clause and Excessive Fines Clause.  \nThat disposes of all claims at issue, and I therefore need not \nreach  any  of  the  many  additional  issues  discussed  and \ndecided by the majority’s opinion or raised by the parties.15   \n \n15 Two of the majority’s expansions of Martin nonetheless warrant \nspecial mention.  First, the majority’s decision goes well beyond Martin \nby holding that the Eighth Amendment precludes enforcement of anti-\ncamping ordinances against those who involuntarily lack access to \ntemporary shelter, if those ordinances deny such persons the use of \nwhatever materials they need “to keep themselves warm and dry.”  See \nOpin. at 46.  It seems unavoidable that this newly declared right to the \nnecessary “materials to keep warm and dry” while sleeping in public \nparks must include the right to use (at least) a tent; it is hard to see how \nelse one would keep “warm and dry” in a downpour.  And the majority \nalso raises, and leaves open, the possibility that the City’s prohibition on \nthe use of other “items necessary to facilitate sleeping outdoors”—such \nas “stoves,” “fires,” and makeshift “structures”—“may or may not be \npermissible.”    See  Opin.  at  45–46,  53–54.    Second,  the  majority \nindirectly extends Martin’s holding from the strictly criminal context at \nissue in that case to civil citations and fines.  See Opin. at 41–45.  As the \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 90 of 155\n90  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nVI \nUp to this point, I have faithfully adhered to Martin and \nits understanding of Powell, as I am obligated to do.  See \nMiller v. Gammie, 335 F.3d 889, 899–900 (9th Cir. 2003) \n(en banc).  But given the importance of the issues at stake, \nand the gravity of Martin’s errors, I think it appropriate to \nconclude by noting my general agreement with many of the \npoints  made  by  my  colleagues  who  dissented  from  our \nfailure to rehear Martin en banc.   \nIn  particular,  I  agree  that,  by  combining  dicta  in  a \nconcurring  opinion  with  a  dissent,  the  panel  in  Martin \nplainly misapplied Marks’ rule that “[w]hen a fragmented \nCourt decides a case and no single rationale explaining the \nresult enjoys the assent of five Justices, ‘the holding of the \nCourt  may  be  viewed  as  that  position  taken  by  those \nMembers who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest \ngrounds.’”    430  U.S.  at  193  (emphasis  added)  (citation \nomitted).  Under a correct application of Marks, the holding \nof  Powell  is  that  there  is  no  constitutional  obstacle  to \npunishing conduct that has not been shown to be involuntary, \nand the converse question of what rule applies when the \n \ndistrict court noted below, the parties vigorously debated the extent to \nwhich a “violation” qualifies as a crime under Oregon law.  The majority, \nhowever, sidesteps that issue by instead treating it as irrelevant.  The \nmajority’s theory is that, even assuming arguendo that violations of the \nanti-camping ordinances are only civil in nature, they are covered by \nMartin because such violations later could lead (after more conduct by \nthe defendant) to criminal fines, see Opin. at 44–45.  But the majority \ndoes not follow the logic of its own theory, because it has not limited its \nholding  or  remedy  to  the  enforcement  of  the  ultimate  criminal \nprovisions; on the contrary, the majority has enjoined any relevant \nenforcement  of  the  underlying  ordinances  that  contravenes  the \nmajority’s understanding of Martin.  See Opin. at 55.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 91 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    91 \nconduct has been shown to be involuntary was left open.  See \nMartin, 920 F.3d at 590–93 (M. Smith, J., dissenting from \ndenial of rehearing en banc) (explaining that, under a proper \napplication of Marks, “‘there is definitely no Supreme Court \nholding’  prohibiting  the  criminalization  of  involuntary \nconduct” (citation omitted)).   \nMoreover, the correct answer to the question left open in \nPowell was the one provided in Justice Marshall’s plurality \nopinion  in  that  case:  there  is  no  federal  “constitutional \ndoctrine of criminal responsibility.”  392 U.S. at 534.  In \nlight of the “centuries-long evolution of the collection of \ninterlocking and overlapping concepts which the common \nlaw has utilized to assess the moral accountability of an \nindividual for his antisocial deeds,” including the “doctrines \nof actus reus, mens rea, insanity, mistake, justification, and \nduress,” the “process of adjustment” of “the tension between \nthe evolving aims of the criminal law and changing religious, \nmoral, philosophical, and medical views of the nature of \nman” is a matter that the Constitution leaves within “the \nprovince of the States” or of Congress.  Id. at 535–36.  \n“There is simply no indication in the history of the Eighth \nAmendment that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause \nwas intended to reach the substantive authority of Congress \nto  criminalize  acts  or  status,  and  certainly  not  before \nconviction,”  and  the  later  incorporation  of  that  clause’s \nprotections  vis-à-vis  the  States  in  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment “worked no change in its meaning.”  Martin, \n920  F.3d  at  602  (Bennett,  J.,  dissenting  from  denial  of \nrehearing en banc);  see also id. at 599 (explaining that \nMartin’s  novel  holding  was  inconsistent  with  the  “text, \ntradition, and original public meaning[] [of] the Cruel and \nUnusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment”).  \nConsequently, so long as “the accused has committed some \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 92 of 155\n92  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nact, has engaged in some behavior, which society has an \ninterest in preventing, or perhaps in historical common law \nterms,  has  committed  some  actus  reus,”  the  Eighth \nAmendment  principles  applied  in  Robinson  have  been \nsatisfied.  Powell, 392 U.S. at 533 (plurality).  The Eighth \nAmendment does not preclude punishing such an act merely \n“because it is, in some sense, ‘involuntary’ or ‘occasioned \nby a compulsion.’”  Id.; see also Martin, 920 F.3d at 592 n.3 \n(M. Smith, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) \n(“Powell does not prohibit the criminalization of involuntary \nconduct.”).   \nFurther, it is hard to deny that Martin has “generate[d] \ndire  practical  consequences  for  the  hundreds  of  local \ngovernments within our jurisdiction, and for the millions of \npeople  that  reside  therein.”    Id.  at  594  (M.  Smith,  J., \ndissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  Those harms, \nof  course,  will  be  greatly  magnified  by  the  egregiously \nflawed  reconceptualization  and  extension  of  Martin’s \nholding in today’s decision, and by the majority’s equally \ntroubling reworking of settled class-action principles.  With \nno sense of irony, the majority declares that no such harms \nare demonstrated by the record in this case, even as the \nmajority largely endorses an injunction effectively requiring \nGrants Pass to allow the use of its public parks as homeless \nencampments.  Other cities in this circuit can be expected to \nsuffer a similar fate. \nIn view of all of the foregoing, both Martin and today’s \ndecision should be overturned or overruled at the earliest \nopportunity, either by this court sitting en banc or by the U.S. \nSupreme Court. \n*          *          * \nI respectfully but emphatically dissent. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 93 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    93 \nSilver,  District  Judge,  and  Gould,  Circuit  Judge,  joint \nstatement regarding denial of rehearing: \n \nThe differences of opinion in this case are hard and there \nis basis for good-faith disagreements which are reflected in \nthe filings from a variety of judges.  The robust defense of \nthe panel majority opinion we offer here should not be read \nas any comment on the sincerity of our colleagues’ quarrels \nwith our position.     \nThe statement regarding the denial of rehearing from \nJudge O’Scannlain and the dissent from Judge M. Smith \nsignificantly exaggerate the holding in Johnson v. Grants \nPass, 50 F.4th 787 (9th Cir. 2022).  Grants Pass, relying on \nMartin v. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584 (9th Cir. 2019), holds \nonly that governments cannot criminalize the act of sleeping \nwith the use of rudimentary protections, such as bedding, \nfrom the elements in some public places when a person has \nnowhere else to sleep.  It does not establish an unrestrained \nright for involuntarily homeless persons to sleep anywhere \nthey choose.  Nor does it require jurisdictions to cede all \npublic spaces to involuntarily homeless persons.  The argued \nnotion  that  Martin  and  Grants  Pass  work  together  to \nguarantee a “federal constitutional ‘right’ . . . to camp or to \nsleep on sidewalks and in parks, playgrounds, and other \npublic places” is completely absent from the opinion.  The \ndenial of en banc rehearing should not be criticized based on \nrhetorical exaggerations. \nBeyond misdescribing the holding of Grants Pass, Judge \nO’Scannlain extrapolates and proposes that the Ninth Circuit \nignore 65 years of Supreme Court precedent in favor of his \npreferred  approach  of  looking  exclusively  to  what  he \ndeclares is the “text, history, and tradition” of the Eighth \nAmendment.  But inferior courts are not free to embark on \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 94 of 155\n94  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nsuch freewheeling adventures when the Supreme Court has \nprovided the applicable guidance.  Judge M. Smith does not \njoin the portion of Judge O’Scannlain’s statement discussing \nthis point, but Judge M. Smith engages in a puzzling error \nby attributing in part the homelessness problem throughout \nthe Ninth Circuit to Martin and now Grants Pass.  The \nhomelessness problem predates Martin, and cities outside \nthe  Ninth  Circuit,  and  outside  the  United  States,  are \nexperiencing crisis-levels of homelessness.  It is implausible \nto argue the crisis would abate if jurisdictions in the Ninth \nCircuit  regained  the  authority  to  punish  involuntarily \nhomeless persons for sleeping in public with blankets.   \nI.  Limited Holding of Grants Pass  \nJudge O’Scannlain and Judge M. Smith aim most of their \nfire  at  the  portion  of  Grants  Pass  addressing  the  two \noverlapping “anti-camping” ordinances.  Grants Pass holds \nthe anti-camping ordinances enacted by the City of Grants \nPass violate the Eighth Amendment but only to the extent \nthey  criminalize  sleeping  with  rudimentary  forms  of \nprotection from the elements (i.e., bedding or sleeping bags) \nby those persons without access to any other shelter (i.e., \npersons who are “involuntarily homeless”).  Grants Pass \ndoes not expressly preface every reference to “homeless \npersons” with the adjective “involuntarily.”  However, in \nclear reliance on Martin, the opinion is strictly limited to \nenforcement  of  the  ordinances  against  “involuntarily” \nhomeless persons.  Like Martin, Grants Pass holds only that \n“it  is  ‘unconstitutional  to  [punish]  simply  sleeping \nsomewhere in public if one has nowhere else to do so.’”  Id. \n(quoting Martin, 920 F.3d at 590 (Berzon, J., concurring in \ndenial of rehearing en banc)).   \nThe holding in Grants Pass is not that involuntarily \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 95 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    95 \nhomeless persons in the City of Grants Pass and elsewhere \nin  the  Ninth  Circuit  are  allowed  to  sleep  wherever  and \nwhenever  they  wish.    When  there  is  space  available  in \nshelters, jurisdictions are free to enforce prohibitions on \nsleeping anywhere in public.  And emphatically, when an \ninvoluntarily homeless person refuses a specific offer of \nshelter  elsewhere,  that  individual  may  be  punished  for \nsleeping  in  public.    When  there  is  no  shelter  space, \njurisdictions may still enforce limitations on sleeping at \ncertain locations.  The assertion that jurisdictions must now \nallow involuntarily homeless persons to camp or sleep on \nevery sidewalk and in every playground is plainly wrong. \nJurisdictions  remain  free  to  address  the  complex  policy \nissues regarding homelessness in the way those jurisdictions \ndeem fit, subject to the single restriction that involuntarily \nhomeless persons must have “somewhere” to sleep and take \nrudimentary precautions (bedding) against the elements.  Id. \n(quoting Martin, 920 F.3d at 590 (Berzon, J., concurring in \ndenial of rehearing en banc)).   \nJudge  M.  Smith  misinterpreted  a  statement  in  the \noriginal majority opinion that he believed mandated “a crude \njurisdiction-wide  inquiry”  dictating  a  local  “government \ncannot prosecute homeless people for sleeping in public if \nthere  is  a  greater  number  of  homeless  individuals  in  a \njurisdiction than the number of available shelter spaces.”  \nJudge M. Smith’s understanding of the original statement \nwas incorrect.  To avoid any possibility of confusion, the \nmajority has now removed the statement Judge M. Smith \nfound confounding.  But Judge M. Smith is still not satisfied.  \nHe complains the change did not result in any “downstream \nchanges” to the majority’s analysis.  But Judge M. Smith \nfails to acknowledge the undisputed facts established that in \nthe  City  of  Grants  Pass,  there  were  zero  shelter  beds \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 96 of 155\n96  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \navailable on almost every night of the year.  Given that, there \nwas no need to change the remaining analysis.     \nAs clearly explained in the majority opinion, the only \nsecular shelter beds in the City of Grants Pass (other than \nbeds for intoxicated adults) were located at a “warming \ncenter”  that  operated  on  especially  cold  nights.    The \nwarming center could hold 40 individuals and was open 16 \nnights during the winter of 2020 and zero nights during the \nwinter of 2021.  Thus, on 95% of the nights in 2020 and \n100% of the nights in 2021, the City of Grants Pass had zero \nsecular shelter beds for non-intoxicated adults.  Given that \nreality, there was no need to make “downstream changes” to \nthe analysis based on the availability of shelter beds in the \nCity of Grants Pass.  When a jurisdiction has zero shelter \nbeds  even  theoretically  available,  it  does  not  require \nsignificant analysis to conclude the jurisdiction is barred \nfrom prosecuting the involuntarily homeless persons in that \njurisdiction.   \nJudge M. Smith’s refusal to acknowledge the lack of \nshelter space in the City of Grants Pass reveals his actual \ncomplaint in this area is the perceived failure to strictly \npolice  who  will  qualify  as  involuntarily  homeless.   \nAccording to Judge M. Smith, it was inappropriate to find \nthat  zero  shelter  beds,  combined  with  “conclusory \nallegations of involuntariness,” were enough to conclude \nthere  were  involuntarily  homeless  persons  in  the \njurisdiction.  The “conclusory allegations” Judge M. Smith \nfaults are expressly found in a declaration submitted by \nGloria Johnson where she stated, in relevant part, “I have no \nchoice but to live outside and have no place else to go,” and \n“I continue to live without shelter in Grants Pass.”  It bears \nrepeating this case was resolved on summary judgment.  The \nCity of Grants Pass did not present any evidence to the \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 97 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    97 \ndistrict  court,  nor  did  it  argue  on  appeal,  that  Gloria \nJohnson’s  declaration  was  inaccurate.    In  fact,  it  is \nundisputed there are at least fifty involuntarily homeless \npersons in the City of Grants Pass, as stated in the testimony \nof  a  City  of  Grants  Pass  police  officer.    Describing \nunequivocal  and  undisputed  statements  submitted  at  the \nsummary judgment stage as mere “conclusory allegations” \nis incorrect.   \nJudge M. Smith worries the amended opinion might still \nprohibit any enforcement actions against individuals with \naccess to shelter.  But the opinion repeatedly notes it only \naddresses  enforcement  attempts  against  “involuntarily \nhomeless persons.”  Grants Pass goes to great lengths to \nmake this clear.  Grants Pass states individuals qualify as \n“involuntarily homeless” only if they “do not have access to \nadequate temporary shelter, whether because they have the \nmeans to pay for it or because it is realistically available to \nthem for free.”  Id. at 793 n.2 (internal quotation marks and \ncitation  omitted).    To  remove  any  doubt,  Grants  Pass \nstresses “[i]ndividuals who have shelter or the means to \nacquire their own shelter simply are never class members,” \nmeaning such individuals are not “involuntarily homeless.”  \nId. at 805.  And to further illuminate the point, Grants Pass \nstates “To be clear: A person with access to temporary \nshelter is not involuntarily homeless unless and until they no \nlonger have access to shelter.”  Id. at 805 n.24.  Judge M. \nSmith’s  assertion  that  Grants  Pass  might  prohibit \nenforcement  against  persons  “no  matter  their  personal \nsituations” is wrong. \nWhen an individual has access to a shelter, such as \nthrough a “city’s offer of temporary housing,” that person is \nnot “involuntarily homeless” and anti-camping ordinances \nmay  be  enforced  against  that  person.    Similarly,  if  a \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 98 of 155\n98  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \njurisdiction  always  has  shelter  beds  or  other  locations \navailable, that jurisdiction is free to enforce its anti-camping \nordinances on all other public areas.   \nJudge M. Smith also claims that after Grants Pass local \nauthorities are  “powerless to cite” individuals “even  for \npublic  defecation.”1    Neither  Martin  nor  Grants  Pass \ninvolved particular ordinances precluding public urination \nand defecation and the assertion that Martin and Grants Pass \nresolved  the  constitutionality  of  ordinances  addressing \npublic urination and defecation is mistaken.2   \n \n1 Judge M. Smith’s sole support for this interpretation is an unpublished \ndecision by the Eastern District of California.  Mahoney v. City of \nSacramento, No. 2:20-cv-00258-KJM, 2020 WL 616302 (E.D. Cal. Feb. \n10, 2020).  That case involved the removal of portable toilets from public \nproperty that had been placed there by private citizens for homeless \nindividuals to use.  The plaintiffs alleged many different constitutional \nclaims, including that the removal of the toilets would violate their \nEighth Amendment rights.  On that point, the City of Sacramento stated \n“neither the benefactors of the toilets nor the users of the toilets have, or \nwill be, criminally prosecuted.”  In denying a request for a temporary \nrestraining order, the court stated “Extending Martin to these facts, the \nCity may not prosecute or otherwise penalize the plaintiffs . . . for \neliminating in public if there is no alternative to doing so.”  Id.  The court \ncontinued, arguably based on the city’s representations regarding non-\nprosecution, that “no irreparable injury to plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment \nrights is likely.”  Id.  Because the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their \nclaim nine days after the court’s order, the court did not provide a more \ncomplete  Eighth  Amendment  analysis  based  on  Martin.    A  brief \nstatement made in the context of resolving an emergency motion is not \na solid foundation for Judge M. Smith’s assertion that after Grants Pass \nlocal authorities are now “powerless to cite” individuals for public \ndefecation.   \n2 The focus of Martin and Grants Pass was sleep.  Sleep is not a \nvoluntary act but an “identifiable human need[].”  Rico v.

And Judge O’Scannlain noted almost twenty years \nago, “[i]n our system of government, courts base decisions \nnot on dramatic Hollywood fantasies . . . but on concretely \nparticularized  facts  developed  in  the  cauldron  of  the \nadversary process and reduced to an assessable record.”  \nUnited States v. Kincade, 379 F.3d 813, 838 (9th Cir. 2004) \n(en banc).  Because there was no challenge to any public \nurination  or  defecation  ordinances  in  Grants  Pass,  the \nparties did not develop a record regarding those issues such \nthat neither the district court nor Ninth Circuit had a basis to \naddress them.  Judge M. Smith’s assertion that Grants Pass \nprohibits citations “even for public defecation” is wrong.  \nII. Class Certification was Proper \nConnected to the purported “jurisdiction-wide analysis,” \nJudge M. Smith argues, as did the dissent by Judge Collins, \nthat Grants Pass erred in affirming certification of the class.  \n \nWalker v. Schult, 717 F.3d 119, 126 (2d Cir. 2013).  See also Wilkins \nKaplan & Sadock’s Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, 10th Ed. \nCH23 (“Sleep is a process required for proper brain function.  Failure to \nsleep impairs thought processes, mood regulation, and a host of normal \nphysiological functions.”).  The lack of sleep may play a role in the \ndevelopment of dementia.  See Nedergaard and Goldman, Glymphatic \nfailure  as  a  final  common  pathway  to  dementia,  available  at \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8186542/.  And long-\nterm sleep deprivation has been shown to be lethal in some animals.

CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nAccording  to  Judge  M.  Smith,  the  opinion  “wholly \ncollaps[es]  the  merits  into  the  class  definition”  which \nresulted in an “impermissible fail safe class.”  The Grants \nPass opinion explains why that conclusion is wrong.  50 \nF.4th at 805 n.23.  In brief, the population of the class of \n“involuntarily homeless” individuals does not change based \non whether the class wins or loses.  There has never been a \npossibility that a “class member either wins or, by virtue of \nlosing,  is  defined  out  of  the  class.”    Olean  Wholesale \nGrocery Coop., Inc. v. Bumble Bee Foods LLC, 31 F.4th \n651, 669 n.14 (9th Cir. 2022) (quotation marks and citation \nomitted). \nJudge M. Smith, as did Judge Collins, also believes the \nclass  should  not  have  been  certified  due  to  a  “lack  of \ncommonality.”    Judge  M.  Smith’s  view  is  that \n“commonality”  was  lacking  because  determining  class \nmembership requires an individualized assessment of each \npotential  class  member’s  access  to  shelter.    This  is  an \nincorrect understanding of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23’s “commonality” requirement.   \nTo satisfy Rule 23’s “commonality” requirement there \nmust be a “common contention” such “that determination of \nits truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the \nvalidity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  Wal-Mart \nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011).  In Grants \nPass, the “common contention” was the assertion that the \nCity’s  anti-camping  ordinances  violated  the  Eighth \nAmendment as applied to the class.  That contention could \nbe resolved in “one stroke,” meaning the “commonality” \nrequirement was met.  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350. \nWhile  not  entirely  clear,  Judge  M.  Smith  might  be \narguing “commonality” does not exist when a court is unable \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 101 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    101 \nto immediately and easily identify each and every class \nmember.  But there has never been such a requirement.  See \nIn re Google Inc. St. View Elec. Commc’ns Litig., 21 F.4th \n1102,  1115  (9th  Cir.  2021)  (affirming  class  settlement \ndespite it being “not feasible” to identify class members).  \nAlternatively,  Judge  M.  Smith  might  be  arguing \n“commonality” does not exist when some effort will be \nrequired to identify class members.  But it is entirely routine \nfor class actions to require individualized determinations to \nidentify class members.   \nFor example, a recent Ninth Circuit opinion involved a \nclass  defined  as  “All  individuals  who  have  worked  as \nCalifornia-based flight attendants of Virgin America, Inc. \nwhile residing in California at any time during the Class \nPeriod.”  Bernstein v. Virgin Am., Inc., 3 F.4th 1127, 1134 \n(9th  Cir.  2021).    Identifying  members  of  that  class \nnecessarily  required  individualized  determinations  to \nidentify  whether  an  individual  had  worked  as  a  flight \nattendant for Virgin America and where the individual had \nlived throughout the multi-year class period.   Judge M. \nSmith’s view that “commonality” is not present whenever \nclass members can only be identified after an individualized \ninquiry would preclude certification of most classes.  \nIII. Eighth Amendment Doctrine \nJudge  O’Scannlain  laments  “Grants  Pass  never \nmeaningfully engaged the text, history, and tradition of the \nConstitution.”  For the most part, that criticism is misplaced \nas the Grants Pass majority was bound to follow Martin.  \nMore importantly, however, the present record does not \ncontain  sufficient  facts  to  conduct  the  analysis  Judge \nO’Scannlain wishes to perform, presumably because the \nparties were aware Judge O’Scannlain’s preferred method of \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 102 of 155\n102  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nanalysis is foreclosed by long established precedent.   \nThe  historical  inquiry  regarding  the  meaning  of \nconstitutional terms may require looking as far back as the \n13th Century.  See Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., \n142 S. Ct. 2228, 2249 (2022) (discussing cases from 13th \ncentury).  The parties in Grants Pass did not gather and \npresent evidence regarding centuries of history to illuminate \nthe complete “text, history, and tradition” of the Eighth \nAmendment.  If, as Judge O’Scannlain believes, courts must \nassess the Eighth Amendment exclusively under a “text, \nhistory, and tradition” approach, the parties must be given \nthe opportunity to present relevant historical evidence. See \nUnited States v. Sineneng-Smith, 140 S. Ct. 1575, 1579 \n(2020)  (noting  courts  should  follow  “party  presentation \nprinciple”).  That may require the parties retain experts.  See, \ne.g., Miller v. Smith, No. 22-1482, 2023 WL 334788, at *1 \n(7th Cir. Jan. 20, 2023) (remanding for district court to \nsolicit additional expert reports regarding “text, history, and \ntradition framework” in Second Amendment case).   \nNotably, Judge O’Scannlain is not arguing Grants Pass \nshould be remanded for a proper inquiry under his proposed \n“text, history, and tradition” test.  Rather, he professes he has \nconducted the relevant inquiry on his own and definitively \nestablished the correct interpretation of centuries of history.  \nOur adversarial system takes a dim view of appellate courts \nembarking  on  their  own  fact-finding  missions.    Alpha \nDistrib. Co. of California v. Jack Daniel Distillery, 454 F.2d \n442, 453 (9th Cir. 1972) (“The appellate court is not the trier \nof facts and does not ordinarily make findings of fact.”).  \nAnd that is especially true when the inquiry has not been \nbriefed by the parties.  Sineneng-Smith, 140 S. Ct. at 1579 \n(2020).  Ultimately, however, Judge O’Scannlain’s favored \nconstitutional analysis is beside the point.  The Supreme \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 103 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    103 \nCourt has made clear “text, history, and tradition” is not the \ncorrect method when assessing Eighth Amendment claims.   \nAccording  to  the  Supreme  Court,  the  proper \ninterpretation  of  the  Eighth  Amendment  does  not  turn \nexclusively on standards from hundreds of years ago.  In a \nplurality opinion in 1958, the Supreme Court explained the \nEighth  Amendment  “must  draw  its  meaning  from  the \nevolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a \nmaturing society.”  Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101 (1958) \n(plurality opinion).  More recently, the Supreme Court stated \na proper Eighth Amendment analysis “is determined not by \nthe standards that prevailed when the Eighth Amendment \nwas  adopted  in  1791  but  by  the  norms  that  ‘currently \nprevail.’”  Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.S. 407, 419 (2008) \n(citation omitted).  And “courts must look beyond historical \nconceptions”  when  assessing  Eighth  Amendment \nchallenges.  Graham v. Florida., 560 U.S. 48, 58 (2010).   \nGiven this guidance, lamenting Grants Pass did not \ndelve  into  the  Eighth  Amendment’s  “text,  history,  and \ntradition” is a complaint that the majority in Grants Pass \nfollowed the Supreme Court’s settled guidance.  Contrary to \nJudge O’Scannlain, the majority in Grants Pass was not free \nto ignore the Supreme Court, embark on its own fact-finding \nmission,  and  conclude  the  correct  interpretation  of  the \nEighth  Amendment  is  the  one  Judge  O’Scannlain  likes.  \nInstead, the majority chose the more modest approach of \napplying existing Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit authority \nto the record presented by the parties.3   \n \n3 Judge Graber agrees with the “underlying legal premise” that the Eighth \nAmendment prohibits criminal prosecution of involuntarily homeless \npersons.  But she believes Grants Pass “unjustifiably expands the reach \nof the Eighth Amendment” by prohibiting “civil remedies that could, in \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 104 of 155\n104  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nIV. Application of Marks Doctrine \nBoth Judge O’Scannlain and Judge M. Smith take issue \nwith  the  Marks  v.  United  States,  430  U.S.  188  (1977), \nanalysis in Martin and Grants Pass.  According to them, the \nproper application of the Marks doctrine is obvious and \nshould have prevented the result in Martin and Grants Pass.  \nIt is not clear if the Marks analyses conducted by Judge \nO’Scannlain  and  Judge  M.  Smith  reach  the  same \nconclusion.4    Moreover,  neither  Judge  O’Scannlain  nor \nJudge M. Smith cite the en banc majority opinion from the \nFourth  Circuit  that  conducts  the  Marks  analysis  on  the \nrelevant Supreme Court authorities and reaches the “same \nconclusion” as that reached in Martin.  Manning v. Caldwell \nfor City of Roanoke, 930 F.3d 264, 283 n.17 (4th Cir. 2019) \n(en banc).  Thus, Judge O’Scannlain and Judge M. Smith \nshow overconfidence that their application of the Marks \ndoctrine is correct.  In the end, however, an exhaustive \n \ntheory, lead to [criminal] prosecution.”  But all parties in Grants Pass \nagreed the civil violations were used as the first step in the eventual \npursuit of criminal charges.  This is not a case where the jurisdiction has \ndisavowed pursuing criminal charges.   \n4 Judge O’Scannlain describes Justice White’s concurrence in Powell v. \nTexas, 392 U.S. 514 (1968), as “the dispositive fifth vote.”  But Judge \nO’Scannlain also relies heavily, without explanation, on statements \nmade by the non-binding plurality in Powell.  As for Judge M. Smith, he \nargues Powell produced “no single rationale and only its specific result \nis binding.”  But Judge M. Smith then faults the Martin and Grants Pass \nmajorities  for  not  addressing  arguments  made  by  the  non-binding \nplurality in Powell.  Judge M. Smith seems to believe proper application \nof the Marks doctrine means only the result in Powell is binding, but \nlower courts have an affirmative obligation to address points made by \nthe Powell plurality.  Judge M. Smith does not cite any authority for his \nidiosyncratic view of how the Marks doctrine operates.    \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 105 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    105 \nMarks analysis is not necessary. \nEveryone agrees Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660 \n(1962) is the binding Supreme Court precedent.  It is vital \nthat every justice in Powell v. State of Texas, 392 U.S. 514 \n(1968), fully embraced the holding in Robinson that a status \ncannot be prosecuted.  In Robinson, the Supreme Court \nconcluded it violated the Eighth Amendment for California \nto criminalize the status of being “addicted to the use of \nnarcotics.”  In doing so, the Supreme Court also noted it \nwould violate the Eighth Amendment for a state to make it a \ncriminal offense to be “mentally ill, or a leper, or to be \nafflicted with a venereal disease.”  Robinson, 370 U.S. at \n666.  And “[e]ven one day in prison would be a cruel and \nunusual punishment for the ‘crime’ of having a common \ncold.”  Id. at 667.  Judge O’Scannlain and Judge M. Smith \ninterpret Robinson as establishing a conclusive line between \nconstitutionally barred “status crimes” and constitutionally \npermitted  “conduct  crimes.”    But  such  a  definitive  line \nrequires Robinson be read rigidly, such that a jurisdiction \ncould avoid Robinson by tying “statuses” to inescapable \nhuman activities. \nFor example, under a strict “status-conduct” distinction, \nthe California statute at issue in Robinson could have been \ncured by tying the addiction status to sleeping.  Under such \nlogic, it would have been constitutional for California to \nmake it a criminal offense for a person “addicted to the use \nof narcotics” to fall asleep.  Id. at 660.  Similarly, it now \nwould  be  constitutional  for  a  jurisdiction  to  criminalize \nfalling asleep while being “mentally ill, or a leper, or [] \nafflicted with a venereal disease.”  Id. at 666.  Reading \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 106 of 155\n106  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nRobinson as allowing such simple evasion is absurd.5   \nRegardless of the Marks analysis, Robinson limits the \nreach of criminal law.  Or, as the Supreme Court declared \nfifteen  years  after  Robinson,  the  Eighth  Amendment \n“imposes substantive limits on what can be made criminal \nand punished as such.”  Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, \n667  (1977).    Martin  and  Grants  Pass  recognize  those \nsubstantive limits reach the exceptionally narrow situation \nof  prohibiting  punishment  when  involuntarily  homeless \npersons  engage  in  the  life-sustaining  act  of  sleeping  in \npublic.  Criminalizing the act of sleeping in public when an \nindividual  has  nowhere  else  to  sleep  is,  in  effect, \ncriminalizing the underlying status of being homeless. \nV.  Non-Existent Circuit Split  \nJudge O’Scannlain greatly overstates the extent to which \nMartin and Grants Pass fall on one side of an existing circuit \nsplit.  According to Judge O’Scannlain, no “federal circuit \nor state supreme court . . . has ever embraced Grants Pass’s \nsweeping holding” regarding the Eighth Amendment.  Judge \nO’Scannlain then cites opinions from the Eleventh and Fifth \nCircuits,  but  neither  of  those  opinions  hold  what  Judge \nO’Scannlain claims.  In fact, no circuit court has reached the \nmerits  of  a  challenge  to  public  camping  or  sleeping \n \n5 Even the dissent in the Fourth Circuit opinion Judge O’Scannlain cites \nwith approval understood the logic of Robinson points away from a rigid \ninterpretation.  Manning v. Caldwell for City of Roanoke, 930 F.3d 264, \n290 (4th Cir. 2019) (Wilkinson, J., dissenting).  That dissent noted “[i]n \nthe rare case where the Eighth Amendment was found to invalidate a \ncriminal law, the law in question sought to punish persons merely for \ntheir need to eat or sleep, which are essential bodily functions.  This is \nsimply a variation of Robinson’s command that the state identify conduct \nin crafting its laws, rather than punish a person’s mere existence.”  Id.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 107 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    107 \nrestrictions  when  no  shelter  space  was  available  and \nconcluded such restrictions were lawful.  Judge O’Scannlain \nalso points to a state supreme court opinion but that opinion \nexplicitly does not decide the question presented in Martin \nand Grants Pass. \nFirst, in Joel v. City of Orlando, 232 F.3d 1353 (11th Cir. \n2000), the Eleventh Circuit addressed a challenge to an anti-\ncamping ordinance.  The entire Eighth Amendment analysis \nin that case was premised on the fact the City of Orlando \n“presented unrefuted evidence that . . . a large homeless \nshelter . . . never reached its maximum capacity and that no \nindividual has been turned away because there was no space \navailable or for failure to pay the one dollar nightly fee.”  Id. \nat 1362.  Thus, the Eleventh Circuit concluded the anti-\nsleeping  ordinance  did  “not  criminalize  involuntary \nbehavior” because the plaintiff could “comply with the [anti-\nsleeping] ordinance” by sleeping in the shelter.  Id.  There is \nno suggestion the result would have been the same if there \nwere no shelter space available.   \nJudge  O’Scannlain  claims  the  availability  of  shelter \nspace  is  not  a  “compelling  response”  in  terms  of \ndistinguishing the result in Joel from that in Martin and \nGrants Pass.  But the central holding in Martin and Grants \nPass  is  that  the  Eighth  Amendment  analysis  turns  on \nwhether there are shelter beds or other locations where an \ninvoluntarily homeless person can lawfully sleep.  It would \nbe hard to imagine a more “compelling” way to distinguish \nJoel  than  pointing  out  Joel  did  not  involve  involuntary \nconduct because shelter space was always available.   \nJudge O’Scannlain also cites Johnson v. City of Dallas, \nTex., 61 F.3d 442 (5th Cir. 1995), where the Fifth Circuit \nconcluded the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge an anti-\n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 108 of 155\n108  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nsleeping ordinance because they had not been prosecuted.  \nThe district court had conducted an extensive overview of \nthe Supreme Court cases and concluded the challenged anti-\nsleeping ordinance impermissibly “punishe[d] the homeless \nfor their status as homeless.”  Johnson v. City of Dallas, 860 \nF. Supp. 344, 350 (N.D. Tex. 1994).  Instead of rejecting or \neven addressing such reasoning, the Fifth Circuit concluded \nno individual had standing to seek pre-enforcement review \nof  a  criminal  statute.    It  is  not  clear  whether  Judge \nO’Scannlain agrees with this standing analysis and there is \nsignificant reason to doubt it is correct.  See, e.g., Holder v. \nHumanitarian L. Project, 561 U.S. 1, 15 (2010) (allowing \n“preenforcement review of a criminal statute”).  But at the \nvery least, it is misleading to describe the Fifth Circuit’s \nrejection based on standing as establishing any position on \nthe merits of the Eighth Amendment issue.6   \n \n6 Judge O’Scannlain also professes to find conflicting decisions from the \nFirst and Seventh Circuits.  In the First Circuit case, the defendant argued \n“because his drug addiction is a disease, sentencing him to a term of \nimprisonment for manifesting a condition of his disease constitutes cruel \nand unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.”  United \nStates v. Sirois, 898 F.3d 134, 135 (1st Cir. 2018).  The First Circuit \nrejected this argument, primarily because the standard of review was \n“clear error” based on the defendant’s failure to raise the argument in the \ndistrict court.  Thus, the First Circuit held only that existing caselaw did \nnot make it “clear or obvious” that “the Eighth Amendment proscribes \ncriminal punishment for conduct that results from narcotic addiction.”  \nId. at 138.  Concluding existing caselaw did not make the issue “clear or \nobvious” is not the same as reaching the merits of the issue. As for the \nSeventh Circuit opinion, it is unpublished and is based on an obvious \nerror.  The opinion discusses a defendant who, allegedly due to his \nalcoholism, “failed to attend treatment programs, used cocaine, and \nabused  alcohol  so  excessively  that  it  led  to  his  arrest  for  public \nintoxication.”  United States v. Stenson, 475 Fed. App’x 630, 631 (7th \nCir. 2012).  The Seventh Circuit concluded the defendant could be \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 109 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    109 \nJudge O’Scannlain also cites Tobe v. City of Santa Ana, \n892 P.2d 1145 (1995) from the California Supreme Court.  \nThat case involved a facial challenge to an anti-camping \nordinance.  Id. at 1154.  The California Supreme Court \nexplicitly noted, however, it was not resolving whether an \n“involuntarily homeless person who involuntarily camps on \npublic property may be convicted or punished under the \nordinance.”  Id. at 1166 n.19.  Claiming Tobe is contrary to \nGrants Pass requires ignoring the language of Tobe. \nFinally,  Judge  O’Scannlain  does  not  disclose  that \nreaching his preferred result would create a circuit split with \nthe Fourth Circuit.  In Manning v. Caldwell for City of \nRoanoke, 930 F.3d 264, 268 (4th Cir. 2019) (en banc), the \nen  banc  Fourth  Circuit  addressed  Virginia’s  statutory \nscheme  that  made  it  a  criminal  offense  for  individuals \nidentified as “habitual drunkards” to possess or attempt to \npossess alcohol.  The Fourth Circuit concluded this scheme \nmight violate the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual \nPunishments clause because it targeted “conduct that is both \ncompelled by [the plaintiffs’] illness and is otherwise lawful \nfor all those of legal drinking age.”  Id. at 281.  In reaching \nthat conclusion, the Fourth Circuit unequivocally adopted \nthe same view of the Supreme Court cases regarding status \ncrimes as that adopted in Martin.  930 F.3d at 282 n.17.   \nJudge O’Scannlain acknowledges that Manning holds \n“involuntary conduct may be exempt” from prosecution.  \n \npunished for those acts because he was not being “punished for his status \nas an alcoholic but for his conduct.”  Id.  However, as noted by the Fourth \nCircuit, the Seventh Circuit “erroneously treated the plurality opinion in \nPowell as the holding of the Court.”  Manning v. Caldwell for City of \nRoanoke, 930 F.3d 264, 283 n.17 (4th Cir. 2019).  Therefore, Stenson is \nof little value. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 110 of 155\n110  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nBut he argues Manning “limited its holding to laws that \nsingled individuals out for special punishment for otherwise \nlawful conduct that is compelled by their illness.”  Judge \nO’Scannlain apparently believes the ordinances addressed in \nGrants Pass do not “single out” individuals in a similar \nmanner.    Judge  O’Scannlain  is  wrong.    The  ordinances \naddressed in Grants Pass target the involuntarily homeless \nthe same way the scheme in Manning targeted alcoholics. \nUnder the ordinances addressed in Grants Pass, it would \nbe lawful for an individual with access to shelter to wrap \nhimself in a blanket in a public park because the individual \nwas not using the blanket “for the purpose of maintaining a \ntemporary place to live.”  50 F.4th at 793.  However, the \nsame  conduct  could  lead  to  criminal  prosecution  of  an \ninvoluntarily homeless person because, with no other place \nto live, the person would be using the blanket for purposes \nof maintaining a place to live.  In brief, blanket use in a \npublic park is criminal if you are homeless and “lawful \nconduct” if you are not.  As with the ordinances in Manning \nregarding alcoholics, the ordinances addressed in Grants \nPass  single  out  the  involuntarily  homeless  for \ncriminalization of otherwise lawful conduct. \nJudge  O’Scannlain’s  purported  “deep  and  varied \nintercircuit split over how to read the Eighth Amendment” is \nan illusion.  The Ninth Circuit is the sole circuit to have \naddressed, on the merits, a challenge to the criminalization \nof sleeping in public by involuntarily homeless persons.  The \nNinth Circuit’s current approach is faithful to Supreme Court \nprecedent and consistent with the Fourth Circuit’s approach \nto a similar issue.  Thus, Judge O’Scannlain’s desire to hear \nGrants Pass en banc is so that a circuit split with the Fourth \nCircuit can be created, not that an existing circuit split can \nbe resolved.   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 111 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    111 \nVI. Evidence Not in the Record \nJudge M. Smith cites a wide variety of extra-record \nevidence  establishing  homelessness  is  a  serious  issue \n“caused by a complex mix of economic, mental-health, and \nsubstance-abuse factors.”  Everyone agrees.  Judge M. Smith \nthen states, “local governments have taken a variety of steps \nintended to ameliorate the crisis . . . but most of these \nattempts to mitigate the challenging issues of homelessness \nhave  been  wholly  or  partially  frustrated  by  an  alleged \nconstitutional right conjured by a panel of our court.”  This \nappears to say that, but for Martin and now Grants Pass, \nlocal governments would be able to pursue policies that \nwould reduce the homeless population.  In other words, \nJudge  M.  Smith  believes  Martin  and  Grants  Pass  are \nsomewhat  responsible  for  the  size  of  the  homeless \npopulation.  That is not sensible.   \nJudge M. Smith points out the City of Los Angeles has \nroughly 70,000 homeless persons.  Judge M. Smith seems to \nbelieve at least some of those 70,000 persons, and more \nthroughout the Ninth Circuit, remain homeless because of \nthe very limited protection offered by Martin.  Thus, it \nfollows that if Martin were overruled and criminal penalties \nwere again possible, at least some of those 70,000 persons in \nLos Angeles would obtain housing.  Judge M. Smith does \nnot cite any authority that shows the possibility of criminal \npenalties would have this effect.  Available evidence points \naway from such a conclusion.  See, e.g., Donald Saelinger, \nNowhere  to  Go:  The  Impacts  of  City  Ordinances \nCriminalizing Homelessness, 13 Geo. J. on Poverty L. & \nPol'y 545, 559 (2006) (“[C]riminalization laws make it much \nmore difficult for the homeless to gain social and economic \nmobility, and thus the laws have the result of extending the \nperiod of time that one is homeless.”).   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 112 of 155\n112  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nJudge  M.  Smith’s  extra-record  evidence  is  carefully \nlimited to support his causal theory.  But if extra-record \nevidence  should  be  considered,  other  jurisdictions  show \nMartin is not the problem.  New York City is experiencing a \ncrisis  in  the  increase  of  the  involuntarily  homeless \npopulation.  As of February 2023, New York City had more \nthan  77,000  homeless  persons,  “by  far  the  most  ever \nrecorded and an increase of over 70 percent since May.”  \nEmma G. Fitzsimmons and Andy Newman, New York City \nCommissioner Of Social Services Resigns, The New York \nTimes (Feb. 8, 2023).  New York City is not in the Ninth \nCircuit and it seems unlikely the holding in Martin is causing \na surge in the homeless population across the country.  Thus, \nMartin is not, as alleged, the driver of the homelessness \nproblem. \nVII. Conclusion \nThe Eighth Amendment “imposes substantive limits on \nwhat  can  be  made  criminal  and  punished  as  such.”  \nIngraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 667 (1977).  Those \nsubstantive limits are implicated only in rare circumstances.  \nOne such circumstance is when a jurisdiction attempts to \npunish  as  a  criminal  offense  the  life-sustaining  act  of \nsleeping in public with bedding when a person has nowhere \nelse  to  go.    Because  Grants  Pass  and  Martin  provide \nexceptionally  limited  protection,  and  are  consistent  with \nSupreme Court precedent, the decision not to rehear Grants \nPass en banc is correct.7 \n \n7 The city ordinances addressed in Grants Pass will be superseded, to \nsome extent, on July 1, 2023, when a new Oregon state law takes effect.  \nThe new state law requires “[a]ny city or county law that regulates the \nacts of sitting, lying, sleeping or keeping warm and dry outdoors on \npublic property that is open to the public must be objectively reasonable \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 113 of 155\n  JOHNSON V.

SMITH joins as to all parts except Part II-A, respecting \nthe denial of rehearing en banc: \nWith  this  decision,  our  Circuit’s  jurisprudence  now \neffectively  guarantees  a  personal  federal  constitutional \n‘right’ for individuals to camp or to sleep on sidewalks and \nin parks, playgrounds, and other public places in defiance of \ntraditional  health,  safety,  and  welfare  laws—a  dubious \nholding premised on a fanciful interpretation of the Eighth \nAmendment.  We are the first and only federal circuit to have \ndivined such a strange and sweeping mandate from the Cruel \nand Unusual Punishments Clause.  Our jurisprudence in this \ncase is egregiously flawed and deeply damaging—at war \nwith constitutional text, history, and tradition, and Supreme \nCourt precedent.

This change in state law is yet another \nreason why it was wise to not rehear Grants Pass.   \n1 As a judge of this court in senior status, I no longer have the power to \nvote on calls for rehearing cases en banc or formally to join a dissent \nfrom failure to rehear en banc.

We should have reheard this  case en banc to \nreconsider our unfortunate constitutional mistake. \nI \nInstead of respecting constitutional “text, history, and \nprecedent,” Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., 142 S. \nCt.  2228,  2271  (2022),  our  Eighth  Amendment \njurisprudence here has disrupted the “paramount role of the \nStates  in  setting  ‘standards  of  criminal  responsibility,’” \nKahler v. Kansas, 140 S. Ct. 1021, 1028 (2020) (quoting \nPowell v. Texas, 392 U.S. 514, 533 (1968) (plurality)).  In \nmy view, our cases do not inspire confidence that we have \nfaithfully  followed  the  Cruel  and  Unusual  Punishments \nClause—and it is worth explaining how we got here before \nconsidering why we should have reheard Grants Pass en \nbanc to fix our constitutional mistakes.  See Martin v. City of \nBoise, 920 F.3d 584, 603 (9th Cir. 2019) (inventing the \ndoctrine); Johnson v. City of Grants Pass, 50 F.4th 787 (9th \nCir. 2022) (expanding the doctrine). \nA \nOur  untenable  jurisprudence  here  started  in  Boise—\nwhere  a  three-judge  panel  first  invented  a  federal \nconstitutional ‘right’ (rooted in the Eighth Amendment, of \nall  places!)  to  sleep  on  public  property.    In  Boise,  six \nhomeless individuals alleged that the City of Boise, Idaho, \nhad  violated  their  constitutional  rights  by  enforcing \nmunicipal ordinances that prohibited unauthorized sleeping \non sidewalks and in parks, plazas, and other public places.  \nEven though the Eighth Amendment, on its own terms, only \nprohibits  “cruel  and  unusual  punishments,”  U.S.  Const. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 115 of 155\n  JOHNSON V.

VIII, the Boise panel went where no federal circuit \nhad  gone  before—holding  that  the  Eighth  Amendment \nprohibited a local government from “prosecuting people \ncriminally” for the “involuntary act” of “sleeping outside on \npublic property [including sidewalks] when those people \nhave no home or other shelter to go to.”  Boise, 920 F.3d at \n603, 613, 616 (cleaned up).   \nIn doing so, the Boise panel made no effort to ground its \ndecision  in  the  text,  history,  or  tradition  of  the  Eighth \nAmendment.    Instead—after  failing  to  identify  a  single \nSupreme Court precedent blessing its approach—the Boise \npanel attempted to fashion its preferred constitutional rule by \nstitching together dicta in a lone concurrence with a dissent.  \nId. at 616 (holding that these separate, unprevailing writings \nin Powell “compel[led]” Boise’s result).  While we declined \nto rehear Boise en banc, see id. at 590-99 (M.

See Grants Pass, 50 F.4th at 792-93, 813.2  \nIn this case, several individuals sought to represent a putative \nclass of all involuntarily homeless people living in Grants \nPass,  seeking  a  permanent  injunction  barring  the \nenforcement  of  municipal  ordinances  that  prohibited \nunauthorized sleeping or camping in public spaces.

The district court sided with \nthe challengers—and it certified a class consisting of “[a]ll \ninvoluntarily homeless individuals living in Grants Pass,” \nand held that the City’s enforcement of the public-sleeping \nand  public-camping  ordinances  violated  the  Eighth \nAmendment.

While  our  mistaken \njurisprudence in this area has some limits, see Grants Pass, 50 F.4th at \n812 n.33, we should not pretend that the jurisprudential experiment \nstarted by Boise and expanded by Grants Pass—which “effectively \nstrikes down the anti-camping and anti-sleeping [o]rdinances … of \ncountless, if not all, cities within our jurisdiction,” Boise, 920 F.3d at 599 \n(M.

After concluding that class \ncertification was proper, the panel majority held, following \nBoise, that the City could not enforce the public-camping \nand  park-exclusion  ordinances  against  “involuntarily \nhomeless persons” for the “mere act of sleeping” or camping \nin public spaces when “there is no other place in the City for \nthem to go.”  Id. at 798 & n.12, 813 (remanding, inter alia, \non  the  public-sleeping  ordinance  because  the  relevant \nplaintiff had died).  It also expanded Boise by holding that \nthe City could not deprive persons of whatever materials \nthey needed “to keep … warm and dry,” and by extending \nBoise  from  the  purely  criminal  arena  to  civil  fines  and \ncitations.  Id. at 806-09.  In doing so, the panel majority—\ncontent to rest on Boise’s tortured reading of Supreme Court \nprecedent, see id. at 808-11—declined to devote any serious \nattention  to  the  text,  history,  or  tradition  of  the  Eighth \nAmendment. \n2 \nJudge Collins dissented.  Id. at 814-31.  He explained, \ninter alia, that the case should be reheard en banc because \nthe panel majority decision combined a “gross misreading of \n[Boise] with a flagrant disregard of settled class-certification \nprinciples,” and because “the foundation on which [the panel \nmajority decision] is built is deeply flawed: [Boise] seriously \nmisconstrued  the  Eighth  Amendment  and  the  Supreme \nCourt’s caselaw construing it.”  Id. at 814, n.1.  In his view, \nBoise has “‘generate[d] dire practical consequences for the \nhundreds of local governments within our jurisdiction,’” and \nthose harms will be “greatly magnified by the egregiously \nflawed  reconceptualization  and  extension  of  [Boise’s] \nholding.”  Id. at 831 (quoting Boise, 920 F.3d at 594 (M. \nSmith, J., dissental)). \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 118 of 155\n118  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nII \nThere is a simple reason why we should have reheard \nGrants Pass en banc: it entrenches a deeply damaging and \negregiously wrong construction of the Eighth Amendment in \nour Circuit’s precedent.  An “erroneous interpretation” of the \nConstitution is “always important.”  Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at \n2265.  But some judicial mistakes are “more damaging” than \nothers—and “more than just wrong.”  Id. at 2265-66.  The \nnovel and expansive jurisprudence entrenched by Grants \nPass—which thumbs its nose at the “standard grounds for \nconstitutional  decisionmaking[:]  text,  history,  and \nprecedent”—stands on “exceptionally weak grounds” and \n“should be overruled.”  Id. at 2264, 2266, 2271. \nA \nThe first flaw in Grants Pass’s jurisprudence is that it \nconflicts with the text, history, and tradition of the Eighth \nAmendment—which  demonstrate  that  the  Cruel  and \nUnusual Punishments Clause does not establish a federal \nconstitutional  “doctrine[]  of  criminal  responsibility.”  \nKahler, 140 S. Ct. at 1028 (cleaned up).  Constitutional text, \nhistory, and tradition make plain that the Clause was directed \nto modes of punishment—and that it was never intended to \narrogate the substantive authority of legislatures to prohibit \n“acts” like those at issue here, and “certainly not before \nconviction.”  Boise, 920 F.3d at 602 (Bennett, J., dissental).  \nIndeed, one might question whether the Cruel and Unusual \nPunishments  Clause  has  anything  to  do  with  the \njurisprudence embraced by Grants Pass—which authorizes \na plaintiff who has never been assigned a “punishment,” let \nalone one that is “cruel and unusual,” to challenge traditional \nanti-vagrancy regulations under the Clause.  It is regrettable \nthat  Grants  Pass  never  meaningfully  engaged  the  text, \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 119 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    119 \nhistory, and tradition of the Constitution—which are the \n“standard  grounds  for  constitutional  decisionmaking.”  \nDobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2271 (“text, history, and precedent”); \nsee, e.g., Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 664 (1977) \n(“history” and precedent); Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.S. \n407, 421 (2008) (“text, history, meaning, and purpose”); see \nalso, e.g., Kennedy v. Bremerton Sch. Dist., 142 S. Ct. 2407, \n2428  (2022)  (“historical  practices  and  understandings” \n(cleaned up)); New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n, Inc. v. \nBruen, 142 S. Ct. 2111, 2128-29 (2022) (“text and history”); \nWashington  v.  Glucksberg,  521  U.S.  702,  721  (1997) \n(“history and tradition” (cleaned up)). \n1 \nThe Eighth Amendment provides, “Excessive bail shall \nnot be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and \nunusual punishments inflicted.”  U.S. Const. amend. VIII \n(emphasis  added).    The  Amendment’s  bar  on  excessive \n“bail,” excessive “fines,” and the infliction of cruel and \nunusual “punishments” indicates the Amendment’s punitive \nfocus.  And the text of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments \nClause itself provides no substantive limit on what conduct \nmay be punished.  Instead, it only prohibits “punishments” \n(i.e., pain or suffering inflicted for a crime or offense) that \nare “cruel” (i.e., marked by savagery and barbarity) and \n“unusual”  (i.e.,  not  in  common  use),  reflecting  a \nconstitutional  prohibition  originally  and  traditionally \nunderstood  to  forbid  the  government  from  “authorizing \nparticular forms or ‘modes’ of punishment—specifically, \ncruel  methods  of  punishment  that  are  not  regularly  or \ncustomarily employed.”  Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. \n957,  976  (1991)  (opinion  of  Scalia,  J.);  id.  at  979 \n(“[b]reaking on the wheel,” “flaying alive,” and “maiming, \nmutilating,  and  scourging  to  death”  (cleaned  up)). \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 120 of 155\n120  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nConstitutional  text,  history,  and  tradition  make  clear—\ncontrary to Grants Pass’s holding—that the Clause was not \noriginally understood to displace the authority of legislatures \nto prohibit historically proscribable acts (and certainly not \nbefore any punishment was imposed), see Boise, 920 F.3d at \n599-603 (Bennett, J., dissental), and that the Clause was not \ntraditionally taken to enshrine a constitutional “doctrine[] of \ncriminal responsibility,” Kahler, 140 S. Ct. at 1028 (cleaned \nup). \n2 \nUltimately, the text, history, and tradition of the Eighth \nAmendment teach a simple truth: the Cruel and Unusual \nPunishments  Clause—a  constitutional  prohibition \nfundamentally centered on modes of punishment—is not a \nboundless remedy for all social and policy ills, including \nhomelessness.  It does not empower us to displace state and \nlocal decisionmakers with our own enlightened view of how \nto address a public crisis over which we can claim neither \nexpertise nor authority, and it certainly does not authorize us \nto dictate municipal policy here.  Given the “centuries-long \nevolution of the collection of interlocking and overlapping \nconcepts which the common law has utilized to assess the \nmoral  accountability  of  an  individual  for  his  antisocial \ndeeds,” including the “doctrines of actus reus, mens rea, \ninsanity, mistake, justification, and duress,” the “process of \nadjustment” of the “tension between the evolving aims of the \ncriminal law and changing religious, moral, philosophical, \nand medical views of the nature of man” has primarily “been \nthought to be the province of the States.”  Powell, 392 U.S. \nat 535-36 (plurality).  So long as “the accused has committed \nsome act, has engaged in some behavior, which society has \nan interest in preventing, or perhaps in historical common \nlaw terms, has committed some actus reus,” the Eighth \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 121 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    121 \nAmendment does not prohibit punishing such an act merely \n“because it is, in some sense, ‘involuntary’ or ‘occasioned \nby a compulsion.’”  Id. at 533.  It is troubling that our \nCircuit—in inventing a new individual ‘right’ unmoored \nfrom  text,  history,  or  tradition—has  twisted  the  Eighth \nAmendment to displace the substantive authority of local \nofficials to prohibit a species of antisocial conduct that was \nneither originally nor traditionally thought to warrant the \nprotection of the Constitution, let alone immunity under the \nCruel and Unusual Punishments Clause. \nB \nThe second flaw in Grants Pass’s jurisprudence is that it \nlacks any foundation in the Eighth Amendment doctrine \nhanded down to us by the Supreme Court—which, to be \nclear, has never accepted Grants Pass’s theory that the Cruel \nand  Unusual  Punishments  Clause  establishes  a  federal \nconstitutional  prohibition  on  the  criminalization  of \npurportedly  nonvolitional  conduct.    While  Grants  Pass \npurports faithfully to follow the Supreme Court’s decisions \nin Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660 (1962), and Powell \nv. Texas, 392 U.S. 514 (1968), it actually rests on a plain \nmisreading of the Supreme Court’s instructions because it \ndoes little more than combine dicta in a solo concurrence \nwith a dissent.  In doing so, Grants Pass has clearly erred—\nembracing a startling misapplication of the Marks doctrine \nto venture far astray from Supreme Court precedent, see \nMarks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977) (“When a \nfragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale \nexplaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the \nholding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by \nthose Members who  concurred in the judgments on the \nnarrowest grounds.” (cleaned up)). \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 122 of 155\n122  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n1 \nThe  Supreme  Court  has  never  blessed  our  Circuit’s \nsweeping approach to the Eighth Amendment here—and \nneither Robinson nor Powell provide any support for Grants \nPass’s  adventurous  holding.    In  Robinson,  the  Supreme \nCourt first articulated the status-act distinction that should \nhave made this a simple case—holding only that the Eighth \nAmendment prohibited states from making it a crime “to be \naddicted to the use of narcotics.”  Robinson, 370 U.S. at 662 \n(cleaned up).  Unlike laws “punish[ing] a person for the use \nof narcotics, for their purchase, sale or possession, or for \nantisocial  or  disorderly  behavior  resulting  from  their \nadministration,” the California law invalidated by Robinson \npunished the mere “status” of narcotics addiction, unmoored \nfrom any particular conduct.  Id. at 662, 666.  The holding of \nRobinson is simple: the criminal law cannot punish status \n(e.g., “be[ing] addicted to the use of narcotics”); it can only \npunish conduct (e.g., “the use of narcotics”).  Id. at 662-67 \n(cleaned up); see Manning v. Caldwell for City of Roanoke, \n930 F.3d 264, 288 (4th Cir. 2019) (en banc) (Wilkinson, J., \ndissenting). \nThe Supreme Court has not wavered from the status-act \ndistinction articulated by Robinson—and Powell is certainly \nno exception.  In Powell, decided soon after Robinson, a \nfractured Supreme Court upheld a Texas law prohibiting \npublic drunkenness against an Eighth Amendment challenge \nalleging that the alcoholic’s status compelled him to drink in \npublic.  Powell, 392 U.S. 514.  No controlling majority \nrejected the status-act line drawn by Robinson: (1) Justice \nMarshall’s four-justice plurality upheld the statute based on \nRobinson’s status-act distinction, id. at 516-37 (plurality); \n(2) Justice White’s lone concurrence (the dispositive fifth \nvote) upheld the statute because it involved a volitional act, \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 123 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    123 \nand he declined to determine whether a non-volitional act \ncould be criminalized, id. at 548-54 (White, J., concurring); \nand  (3)  Justice  Fortas’s  four-justice  dissent  rejected \nRobinson’s status-act distinction and deemed the statute’s \nenforcement  unconstitutional,  id.  at  554-70  (Fortas,  J., \ndissenting).  Because Justice White did not “reach[] the \nbroader question of compulsion, the judgment in Powell \nneither extended [n]or contracted Robinson, which was left \nundisturbed.”  Manning, 930 F.3d at 289 (Wilkinson, J., \ndissenting).  And the Supreme Court has certainly never \nunderstood Powell to have such broad effect: it has neither \n“walked  away  from  Robinson”  nor  “embraced  [Boise’s] \nwhole notion of nonvolitional conduct.”  Id. \n2 \nNevertheless,  Grants  Pass—turning  to  Powell’s \nfractured decision, see  Grants Pass, 50 F.4th at 809-11 \n(contorting  Powell  and  Marks)—attempts  to  “tease  [its] \npreferred  reading  from  the  dicta  of  a  single  justice,” \nManning,  930  F.3d  at  290  (Wilkinson,  J.,  dissenting).  \nGrants Pass’s distortion of Powell clearly violates Marks—\nwhich, as explained, instructs that the Court’s holding is \n“that position taken by those Members who concurred in the \njudgment[] on the narrowest grounds.”  Marks, 430 U.S. at \n193 (cleaned up).  Because no victorious majority in Powell \ndisrupted  Robinson’s  “status-act”  distinction  or  blessed \nGrants Pass’s “involuntary conduct” theory, we are left with \nnothing  more  than  Grants  Pass’s  attempt  to  craft  its \npreferred rule by combining dicta in a concurrence with a \ndissent—which  means  that  Grants  Pass  is  ultimately \npredicated on a plain Marks violation.  Such a fundamental \nmistake, which directly implicates the limits on an inferior \ncourt’s authority to circumvent the limits of such controlling \nprecedents, should not remain the law of our Circuit. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 124 of 155\n124  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nIII \nThe fundamental flaws in Grants Pass are sufficient \nreason to reject its deeply damaging and egregiously wrong \ninterpretation of the Eighth Amendment.  But even apart \nfrom the constitutional errors entrenched by Grants Pass, \nthere  are  additional,  compelling  reasons  why  this  case \nwarranted rehearing en banc.  Perhaps most importantly, our \nexpansive  interpretation  of  the  Cruel  and  Unusual \nPunishments Clause diverges from other courts on an issue \nof exceptional importance—and it is telling that we remain \nthe  only  circuit  bold  enough  to  embrace  an  Eighth \nAmendment  doctrine  that  effectively  requires  local \ncommunities to surrender their sidewalks and other public \nplaces to homeless encampments. \nA \nThe  Eighth  Amendment  jurisprudence  undergirding \nGrants Pass squarely conflicts with decisions from other \ncircuits and other courts.  We should not pretend that our \nCircuit’s divination of a personal constitutional ‘right’ to \nencamp on public property (including sidewalks) is anything \nbut the inventive, judge-made novelty that we all know it to \nbe. \n1 \nThe  first  set  of  conflicts—which  centers  on  Grants \nPass’s result—is plain.  No federal circuit or state supreme \ncourt (not one!) has ever embraced Grants Pass’s sweeping \nholding  that  the  Eighth  Amendment  prohibits  the \nenforcement  of  public-camping  restrictions  (including \nbefore  any  punishment  is  imposed).    Other  circuits  to \nconsider the issue have uniformly upheld such laws against \nEighth Amendment challenges.  See Joel v. City of Orlando, \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 125 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    125 \n232 F.3d 1353, 1356, 1361-62 (11th Cir. 2000) (upholding \npublic-camping proscription because “[a] distinction exists \nbetween applying criminal laws to punish conduct, which is \nconstitutionally permissible, and applying them to punish \nstatus, which is not”); see also Johnson v. City of Dallas, 61 \nF.3d 442, 443-45, n.5 (5th Cir. 1995) (rejecting challenge to \npublic-camping  proscription  because  the  prohibition  on \ncruel  and  unusual  punishments  is  applicable  only  after \nprosecution and conviction, and none of the challengers had \nbeen  “convicted  of  violating  the  sleeping  in  public \nordinance” (relying on Ingraham, 430 U.S. at 664)).  And no \nstate  supreme  court  has  reached  the  same  result  as  our \naberrant decision here.  See Tobe v. City of Santa Ana, 892 \nP.2d 1145, 1166 (Cal. 1995) (upholding public-camping \nregulation because the “ordinance permits punishment for \nproscribed conduct, not punishment for status”); Allen v. \nCity  of  Sacramento,  234  Cal.  App.  4th  41,  60  (2015) \n(upholding  public-camping  bar  because  “the  Eighth \nAmendment does not prohibit the punishment of acts,” and \nthe “ordinance punishes the act[] of [illegal] camping, … not \nhomelessness”).    No  defender  of  Grants  Pass’s \njurisprudence has provided a compelling response to these \ndecisions, see Boise, 920 F.3d at 617 n.9 (attempting to \nreconcile  Boise  with  Joel’s  alternative  rationale,  but \ndeclining to do much else); Grants Pass, 50 F.4th 787 (not \neven attempting this much)—let alone a federal appellate or \nstate supreme court case that has ever reached Grants Pass’s \nresult.  While Grants Pass has not been replicated elsewhere, \naside from a smattering of trial-level dispositions, a decision \nthat stands so far out of step with so many other courts is one \nthat cries out for correction. \n2 \nThe second set of conflicts—which relates to Grants \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 126 of 155\n126  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nPass’s rationale—is similarly troublesome.  Our approach to \nthe Eighth Amendment in this area conflicts with decisions \nfrom the First Circuit, Fourth Circuit, and Seventh Circuit, \nwhich  embrace  several  competing  tests  for  determining \nwhether  the  Eighth  Amendment  immunizes  involuntary \nconduct.  At least two other circuits—the First Circuit and \nthe Seventh Circuit—have flatly rejected the Grants Pass \nprinciple that purportedly “involuntary” conduct is exempt \nfrom criminal liability under the Eighth Amendment, or that \nJustice White’s lone concurrence in Powell provides the \nbinding opinion that compels such exemptions.  See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Sirois, 898 F.3d 134, 137-38 (1st Cir. 2018); \nUnited States v. Stenson, 475 F. App’x 630, 631 (7th Cir. \n2012) (citing United States v. Black, 116 F.3d 198, 200-01 \n(7th Cir. 1997)); see also supra (collecting cases rejecting \nGrants Pass’s reading of Robinson, Powell, and Ingraham).  \nAnd  the  Fourth  Circuit—the  only  circuit  that  embraces \nanything like Grants Pass’s approach—provides, at best, \nonly  mixed  support  because  even  though  it  held  that \ninvoluntary conduct may be exempt based on dicta in Justice \nWhite’s lone concurrence, it limited its holding to laws that \n“singled”  individuals  “out  for  special  punishment  for \notherwise lawful conduct that is compelled by their illness.”  \nManning, 930 F.3d at 281 n.14.  Our Circuit is, therefore, \nlocked in a deep and varied intercircuit split over how to read \nthe Eighth Amendment in light of Robinson and Powell—\nand, as explained, we are the only federal court of appeals to \nhave  discovered  a  personal  constitutional  ‘right’  for \nindividuals  to  encamp  on  public  property  (including \nsidewalks)  in  violation  of  traditional  health,  safety,  and \nwelfare laws, a result that no other federal circuit or state \nsupreme  court  in  the  country  has  been  bold  enough  to \nreplicate. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 127 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    127 \nB \nGrants  Pass  also  presents  a  question  of  exceptional \npractical  and  institutional  importance.    The  immodest \napproach to the Eighth Amendment that it embraces is both \ntroubling and dangerous.  It undermines the power of state \nand local governments to address the homelessness crisis.  \nAnd  it  arrogates  to  federal  judges  authority  that  the \nConstitution reserves elsewhere.  We should have granted \nrehearing en banc to stop the damage already being worked \nby Boise and to stave off the mischiefs that Grants Pass is \nsure to worsen.  It is regrettable that our Circuit has declined \nto grapple with the consequences of our mistakes. \n1 \nThe practical consequences should have been reason \nenough to reconsider our jurisprudential experiment before \nit did any more harm to our communities—and before its \ndangers  were  exacerbated  by  Grants  Pass.    No  one \nreasonably doubts that our existing precedent in Boise has \ncreated grave and troubling consequences for the state and \nlocal communities within our jurisdiction.   And no one \nmeaningfully  contests  that  these  harms  will  be  greatly \nworsened by the doctrinal innovations introduced by Grants \nPass.  One need only walk through our neighborhoods—\nthrough the Tenderloin (San Francisco) or Skid Row (Los \nAngeles)—to know that our communities are fast coming \nundone.  Tents crowding out sidewalks, needles flooding \nparks,  and  rubbish  (and  worse)  marring  public  squares \nreflect a threat to the public welfare that should not be taken \nlightly.  Nor do such troubling blights mark an area where \nwe should be eager to throw caution to the wind and to \nembrace  judicial  adventurism  so  far  removed  from  the \nguardrails set by the Constitution’s text and the Supreme \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 128 of 155\n128  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nCourt’s precedents. \nUnfortunately, the “Hobson’s choice” imposed by our \nCircuit  effectively  requires  state  and  local  officials  to \n“abandon enforcement of a host of laws regulating public \nhealth and safety,” Boise, 920 F.3d at 594 (M. Smith, J., \ndissental)—and,  if  today’s  decision  is  any  guide,  our \nprecedents will readily be wielded effectively to require \njurisdictions throughout our Circuit to surrender the use of \nmany  of  their  public  spaces  (including  sidewalks)  to \nhomeless encampments.  It is easy enough for us, behind \nmarble walls and sealed doors, to dismiss the consequences \nof our decisions.  But for those who call these communities \nhome—who must live by the criminal violence, narcotics \nactivity, and dangerous diseases that plague the homeless \nencampments  buttressed  by  our  decisions—the \nconsequences of our judicial arrogation are harder to accept. \n2 \nIn addition to the practical harms that our jurisprudence \ncreates for our communities, we also should have ended the \njurisprudential mistake embraced by Grants Pass as quickly \nas possible because it “visit[s] structural and institutional \ndamage in so many respects.”  Manning, 930 F.3d at 305 \n(Wilkinson,  J.,  dissenting).    In  particular,  the  doctrine \nembraced by Grants Pass puts “judges in policymaking roles \nreserved largely for legislatures and states.”  Id. at 297.  It \nerodes “the states’ role as separate sovereigns entrusted to \ndefine  the  criminal  law  within  their  own  borders,”  and \n“pushes the Eighth Amendment as a catch-all corrective” for \nsocial  ills  identified  by  inexpert  and  unelected  judicial \nofficers.  Id.  Under our federal system, state and local \nleaders—not distant federal judges—are primarily entrusted \nwith the power and duty to protect the common welfare of \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 129 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    129 \nour towns, cities, and neighborhoods, and to ensure that our \nstreets, squares, and sidewalks remain clean and safe.  See \nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 561 n.3 (1995).  The \nreason for such “legislative responsibility over criminal law \nis fundamental: the criminal law exists to protect the safety \nof citizens, and ensuring the safety of the people is one of \nthose  things  that  popular  government  exists  to  do.”  \nManning,  930  F.3d  at  297  (Wilkinson,  J.,  dissenting).  \nUnfortunately,  this  has  not  swayed  our  Court—with \nconsequences that will sweep well past the troubles visited \nupon the City of Boise and the City of Grants Pass. \nIV \nGrants Pass is a regrettable mistake that entrenches and \nexpands  upon  previous  deeply  damaging  jurisprudence.  \nWhile I do not doubt the good faith of my colleagues, it is \nhard to imagine a jurisprudence that combines so little regard \nfor the sacred words of the Constitution, with so much \ndisregard  for  the  state  and  local  authorities  that  our \nconstitutional system entrusts as the primary protectors of \nthe health, safety, and welfare of our communities.  Our \njurisprudence  here  is  flawed—in  conflict  with  the  text, \nhistory, and tradition of the Eighth Amendment, and the \nprecedents of the Supreme Court.  And it splits from other \ncircuits on a question of exceptional importance, working \ngreat violence to our constitutional structure and threatening \ndire consequences for communities within our jurisdiction.  \nIt is most regrettable that our Court has failed to rehear this \ncase en banc. \n   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 130 of 155\n130  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nGRABER, Senior Circuit Judge, respecting the denial of \nrehearing en banc: \n \nThe constitutional limits on a municipality’s ability to \naddress the issue of homelessness present an exceptionally \nimportant  and  complex  topic.    I  appreciate  the  many \nthoughtful  views  expressed  by  my  colleagues.    I  write \nseparately to offer a middle ground. \nWhether or not the result is dictated by Powell v. Texas, \n392  U.S.  514  (1968),  the  Eighth  Amendment  almost \ncertainly  prohibits  criminal  punishment  of  persons  who \nengage in truly involuntary actions such as sleeping.  I thus \nagree with the underlying legal premise of the decisions in \nJohnson v. City of Grants Pass, 50 F.4th 787 (9th Cir. 2022), \nand Martin v. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584 (9th Cir. 2019).  \nEighth Amendment protection also extends to individualized \ninjunctive relief, such as precluding a municipality from \nenforcing a particular criminal provision against a specific \nperson, if past actions by the municipality warrant such \nequitable  relief.    Our  opinion  in  Martin,  though \ncontroversial,  reached  a  reasonable  result,  particularly \nbecause  Martin  emphasized  the  “narrow”  nature  of  its \nholding.  920 F.3d at 617.  I did not join, and did not agree \nwith, the dissents from denial of rehearing en banc in Martin. \nIn my view, though, the extension of Martin to classwide \nrelief, enjoining civil statutes that may eventually lead to \ncriminal  violations  but  have  never  resulted  in  criminal \nconvictions for any named plaintiff, is a step too far from the \nindividualized  inquiries  inherent  both  in  the  Eighth \nAmendment context and in the context of injunctive relief.  \nA  key  part  of  Johnson’s  reasoning  begins  with  the \nobservation that civil citations could lead to a civil park-\nexclusion order which, in turn, could lead to a prosecution \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 131 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    131 \nfor criminal trespass (but which never has for the named \nplaintiffs).1  Johnson, 50 F.4th at 807–08.  The opinion then \nconcludes  that,  because  the  Eighth  Amendment  would \nprohibit that ultimate prosecution, it also must prohibit the \ncivil citations.  Id.  I disagree with that double leap in logic.  \nEven  assuming  that  classwide  injunctive  relief  were \navailable against a prosecution for criminal trespass, the \nEighth Amendment does not prohibit all civil remedies that \ncould, in theory, lead to such a prosecution.  In this way, \nJohnson  unjustifiably  expands  the  reach  of  the  Eighth \nAmendment. \nThe  challenges  faced  by  individuals  experiencing \nhomelessness  are  severe.    And  the  challenges  that  face \nmunicipalities are daunting.  When called upon, we have an \nobligation to ensure that a municipality’s efforts to provide \nfor  the  common  health  and  safety  do  not  violate  the \nConstitution.  I agree with the basic legal premise that the \nEighth Amendment protects against criminal prosecution of \nthe involuntary act of sleeping, but the injunctive relief in \nthis case goes too far.  Moreover, given the widespread \nnature of the homelessness crisis in our jurisdiction, it is \n \n1 The amended opinion refers to Debra Blake as “a named plaintiff,” and \nthe amended opinion states that she was convicted of “Criminal Trespass \non City Property.”  Amended Op. at 28 n.13.  Blake unfortunately died.  \nAs the opinion elsewhere recognizes, Johnson, 50 F.4th at 800–02, she \nis no longer a named plaintiff.  Moreover, Blake’s “conviction” is doubly \ninapt here.  First, despite the name of the citation, the conviction was for \na violation, not a crime.  Second, Blake was cited for being in a closed \npark, not for violating any of the civil statutes challenged here.  The crux \nof the opinion’s analysis is that a civil citation could lead to a criminal \nmisdemeanor conviction under Oregon Revised Statute section 164.245.  \nJohnson, 50 F.4th at 807.  No evidence in the record suggests that the \ncivil statutes relevant here have caused Blake or any named plaintiff to \nbe convicted of that crime. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 132 of 155\n132  JOHNSON V.

The Marks \nrule  instructs  in  no  uncertain  terms  that,  “[w]hen  a \nfragmented [Supreme] Court decides a case and no single \nrationale  explaining  the  result  enjoys  the  assent  of  five \nJustices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that \nposition taken by those Members who concurred in the \njudgments on the narrowest grounds.”  Marks v. United \nStates, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977) (cleaned up) (emphasis \nadded).    Yet  Martin  counted  to  five  votes  for  its \nunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment by including the \nfour votes of the Powell dissenters.  Martin, 920 F.3d at 616 \n(“The four dissenting Justices adopted a position consistent \nwith that taken by Justice White [in his concurrence] . . . .”).  \nWhen the Marks rule is properly applied to Powell v. Texas, \n392 U.S. 514 (1968), it produces the holding that Powell’s \n“conviction  was  constitutional  because  it  involved  the \ncommission of an act.  Nothing more, nothing less.”  Martin, \n920 F.3d at 591 (M. Smith, J., dissenting from denial of \nrehearing en banc); see also Grants Pass, 50 F.4th at 830 \n(Collins, J., dissenting) (“Under a correct application of \nMarks, the holding of Powell is that there is no constitutional \nobstacle to punishing conduct that has not been shown to be \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 138 of 155\n138  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \ninvoluntary, and the converse question of what rule applies \nwhen the conduct has been shown to be involuntary was left \nopen.”).  Put differently: When the Marks rule is properly \napplied, Martin cannot hide behind Powell and insist that \nSupreme  Court  precedent  “compels  the  conclusion”  it \nreached.  Martin, 920 F.3d at 616.   \nMartin therefore had the burden to affirmatively justify \nits rule—that a “state may not criminalize conduct that is an \nunavoidable  consequence”  of  a  person’s  status—as \nconsistent with the Eighth Amendment.  Id. at 617 (cleaned \nup).  But neither Martin nor the majority in this case even \nattempts  to  make  that  showing,  including  rebutting  the \nnumber of reasons Justice Thurgood Marshall and the other \nJustices in the Powell plurality thought an unavoidable-\nconsequence-of-status  rule  would  be  both  improper  and \nunworkable.  We are left completely in the dark as to why, \nfor example, the Martin panel and Grants Pass majority \napparently thought:  \n•  The Powell plurality was wrong to interpret Robinson \nv.  California,  370  U.S.  660  (1962)  as  a  ban  on \n“punish[ing]  a  mere  status”  and  nothing  more.  \nPowell, 392 U.S. at 532 (plurality) (Marshall, J.). \n•  The Powell plurality was wrong to be concerned that \nan  unavoidable-consequence-of-status  rule  would \nlack “any limiting principle.”  Id. at 533. \n•  The  Powell  plurality  was  wrong  to  think  that  a \nconstitutionalized  unavoidable-consequence  rule \nwould improperly override the ability of states to \ndevelop  “[t]he  doctrines  of  actus  reus,  mens  rea, \ninsanity, mistake, justification, and duress” to resolve \nas they think best “the tension between the evolving \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 139 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    139 \naims  of  the  criminal  law  and  changing  religious, \nmoral, philosophical, and medical views of the nature \nof man.”  Id. at 535–36. \n•  The  Powell  plurality  incorrectly  characterized  an \nunavoidable-consequence  rule  as  conferring  upon \nunelected federal judges the impossible task of being \n“the ultimate arbiter[s] of the standards of criminal \nresponsibility, in diverse areas of the criminal law, \nthroughout the country.”  Id. at 533.  \n•  The  punishment  flowing  from  a  public-camping \nprosecution (or even just a civil citation) constitutes \nthe “exceedingly rare” instance—outside the context \nof  capital  punishment  and  juvenile  life  without \nparole—where a particular sentence may violate the \nEighth Amendment.  Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U.S. 263, \n272 (1980); see Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. 460, \n469–70  (2012)  (summarizing  proportionality  case \nlaw). \nJudges Gould and Silver are correct to note that the Powell \nplurality is, after all, just a plurality.  But these questions, \nand others, still warranted a response—one would hope that \na lower court, when fashioning a novel constitutional rule, \nwould at least grapple with the reasons four Supreme Court \nJustices expressly chose to reject the very same rule.  The \ndistrict courts tasked with applying Martin/Grants Pass, the \nlocal governments placed in a straitjacket by these decisions, \nand the residents of our circuit who now must live with the \nconsequences  all  deserved  better  than  the  half-reasoned \ndecisions they received from our court. \nII. \nMoreover, even if one assumes arguendo that the Eighth \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 140 of 155\n140  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nAmendment supports an unavoidable-consequence-of-status \nprinciple, Grants Pass’s homelessness-specific analysis has \nnothing to do with that principle.  One would reasonably \nassume  that  Grants  Pass  implemented  Martin’s  general \nEighth  Amendment  principle  by  mandating  that  courts \nconduct an individualized inquiry: whether public camping \nby  the  individual  plaintiffs  before  the  court  is  an \n“unavoidable  consequence”  of  their  status  as  homeless \npersons—inquiring, for example, into whether the plaintiffs \ndeclined offers of temporary housing.9  But one would be \nmistaken  in  that  assumption.    Instead  of  calling  for  an \nindividualized inquiry, the original Grants Pass majority \nopinion candidly set forth a crude jurisdiction-wide inquiry: \n“The formula established in Martin is that the government \ncannot prosecute homeless people for sleeping in public if \nthere is  a  greater  number  of  homeless  individuals  in  a \njurisdiction than the number of available shelter spaces.”  \nGrants Pass, 50 F.4th at 795 (cleaned up); see id. at. 823–28 \n(Collins, J., dissenting) (arguing that Martin provides at \nmost  a  “case-specific,”  as-applied  claim).    The  original \n \n9 One short-term housing site in Los Angeles sits nearly empty despite \nproximity to a large homeless camp, and one of the new Los Angeles \nmayor’s  marquee  offers  of  short-term  housing  had  a  below-50% \nacceptance rate.

CITY OF GRANTS PASS    141 \nmajority opinion made clear that the beds-versus-population \n“formula” is all that matters: Because the plaintiffs in this \ncase established a shelter-beds deficit, they are deemed—no \nmatter  their  personal  situations—involuntarily  homeless, \nand the city effectively cannot enforce its ordinances against \nany homeless person. \nThe majority has now amended its opinion to remove \nthis “formula” language, and the opinion’s body now quotes \nMartin’s statement that individuals are outside the purview \nof its holding if they “have access to adequate temporary \nshelter, whether because they have the means to pay for it or \nbecause it is realistically available to them for free, but [they] \nchoose not to use it.”  Martin, 920 F.3d at 617 n.8.  But I fear \nthat this amendment, in reality, does little to change the \nsubstance of Grants Pass and instead simply obscures what \nGrants Pass holds.   \nNotably, the amendment is not accompanied by any \ndownstream changes to the majority’s application of its rule \nto the facts or its ultimate conclusion.  So, the “formula” \nlanguage  may  be  gone,  but  the  approach  that  language \nforthrightly described remains embedded in the opinion.  \nGrants Pass still holds that “[t]here, of course, exists no law \nor rule requiring a homeless person” to “provide the court an \naccounting of her finances and employment history” before \nbeing deemed “involuntarily homeless.”  50 F.4th at 811.  It \nstill  equates  a  shelter-beds  deficit  with  jurisdiction-wide \ninvoluntariness:  “[T]he  number  of  homeless  persons \noutnumber the available beds.  In other words, homeless \npersons have nowhere to shelter and sleep in the City . . . .”  \nId. at 792; see also id. at 797 (describing the district court \ndecision, which it largely affirms, as holding “that, based on \nthe unavailability of shelter beds, the City’s enforcement of \nits anti-camping and anti-sleeping ordinances violated the \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 142 of 155\n142  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nCruel and Unusual Punishment Clause”).  And it still treats \na  shelter-beds  deficit,  when  combined  with  conclusory \nallegations of involuntariness, as sufficient for an individual \nto show that he or she is involuntarily homeless: “Gloria \nJohnson  has  adequately  demonstrated  that  there  is  no \navailable shelter in Grants Pass and that she is involuntarily \nhomeless.”  Id. at 811. \nThe  amendment  thus  places  district  courts  in  an \nimpossible position.  They will not be able to reconcile \nGrants Pass’s disparate strands—because they cannot be \nreconciled.  District courts will have to choose between \nfollowing what Grants Pass now says in one place (there \nmust  be  a  meaningful  voluntariness  inquiry)  and  what \nGrants Pass says and does in another place (a shelter-beds \ndeficit and conclusory allegations are all one needs). \nIndeed,  Grants  Pass’s  class-certification  analysis \nconfirms that its nod to the unavoidable-consequence or \ninvoluntarily-homeless limitation is just window dressing—\nand that the amendment to the opinion is one of form, not \nsubstance.  As Judge Collins explained, if Martin’s public-\ncamping ban is truly limited to those who are involuntarily \nhomeless,  then  Martin-type  cases  cannot  possibly  be \nlitigated on a class-wide basis.  Grants Pass, 50 F.4th at 823–\n28 (Collins, J., dissenting).  To be certified, a putative class \nmust  satisfy  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  23’s \ncommonality requirement, among others.  “What matters” \nfor  purposes  of  that  requirement  “is  not  the  raising  of \ncommon  questions—even  in  droves—but  rather,  the \ncapacity of a class-wide proceeding to generate common \nanswers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.”  Wal-\nMart  Stores,  Inc.  v.  Dukes,  564  U.S.  338,  350  (2011) \n(cleaned up).  A court must be able to “resolve an issue that \nis central to the validity of each one of the [class members’] \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 143 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    143 \nclaims in one stroke.”  Id.  Whether a public-camping ban is \nunconstitutional as applied to a homeless plaintiff depends \n(it would seem) on whether that plaintiff is “involuntarily \nhomeless,” which in turn depends on a host of individualized \nfactors:  Did  they  decline  the  city’s  offer  of  temporary \nhousing?  Do they otherwise “have the means to pay” for \ntemporary housing?  Were there areas of the city where they \ncould publicly camp without citation in light of the city’s \nenforcement policies?  It blinks reality to say that the district \ncourt could, “in one stroke,” resolve the constitutionality of \nthe public-camping ban as applied to each of the “at least \naround 50” class members here.  Grants Pass, 50 F.4th at \n811. \nThe majority, for what it is worth, tries to backdoor \ninvoluntariness into its Rule 23 analysis.  But its argument is \none that Philosophy 101 professors should consider using as \ntheir go-to example of circular reasoning: The class satisfies \nRule  23’s  commonality  requirement  because  the  class \nmembers’  claims  all  present  the  question  of  whether \nenforcement  of  public-camping  ordinances  against \n“involuntarily  homeless  individuals  violates  the  Eighth \nAmendment.”  Id. at 804–05 n.22.  Answering that question \nresolves the claims of each class member “in one stroke” \nbecause “[p]ursuant to the class definition, the class includes \nonly  involuntarily  homeless  persons.”    Id.  at  804–05 \n(citation omitted).  The basis for that premise?  “[T]he record \nestablishes”  it.    Id.  at  804–05  n.22.    As  Judge  Collins \nexplained, there is “no authority for this audacious bootstrap \nargument.”  Id. at 827 (Collins, J., dissenting).  By wholly \ncollapsing the merits into the class definition, the majority \nopinion certified an impermissible “fail safe” class.  Id. \n(quoting Olean Wholesale Grocery Coop. v. Bumble Bee \nFoods, 31 F.4th 651, 670 n.14 (9th Cir. 2022) (en banc)). \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 144 of 155\n144  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nIn response to this criticism, Judges Gould and Silver \nsuggest that Grants Pass’s class-certification analysis is run \nof the mill—analogizing it to our court’s recent approval of \na  district  court’s  certification  of  a  class  of  California \nresidents who worked for a certain employer.  See Bernstein \nv. Virgin Am., Inc., 3 F.4th 1127, 1134 (9th Cir. 2021).  It is \ntelling  that  Judges  Gould  and  Silver  think  involuntary \nhomelessness  is  as  easily  determined  as  residency  and \nemployment  history—another  piece  of  evidence  that \nMartin’s involuntariness component has faded away or been \ncollapsed  into  the  shelter-beds  inquiry.    More \nfundamentally, their analogy overlooks that the Bernstein \nclass definition did not swallow the merits inquiry in the \nmanner that the class definition does here.  Separate from \nclass membership (based on residency and employment), the \nBernstein plaintiffs still had to make a merits showing that \nthe defendant violated California labor laws by, among other \nthings, failing to pay a minimum wage and to pay for all \nhours worked.  See id. at 1133.  Here, by contrast, the game \nis essentially over as soon as the class is certified.  The class \n(purportedly)  consists  only  of  involuntarily  homeless \npeople, and application of the challenged ordinances to the \nclass  members  is  unconstitutional  (under  our  flawed \nprecedent)  because  the  class  members  are  involuntarily \nhomeless. \nViewing the majority’s class-certification analysis, there \nare only two possible conclusions: Either (1) the majority \nerred in certifying the class despite a lack of commonality; \nor (2) the majority read “involuntarily” out of Martin’s \npurported involuntarily-homeless rule.  Either conclusion \npoints to profound error that we should have used the en \nbanc process to correct. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 145 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    145 \nIII. \nJudges Gould and Silver insist that Martin and Grants \nPass apply only in “exceptionally narrow situation[s]” and \nthat critics of these decisions have resorted to “rhetorical \nexaggerations.”  But whose word should one take: that of a \npanel majority defending its own work or that of several \ndistrict court judges who have no dog in this fight and are \nsimply trying to understand and apply the law as we have \nhanded it down to them?  Several district court decisions \nhave  understood  Martin  and  now  Grants  Pass  to  run \nroughshod  over  normal  procedural  rules  and  past  any \nsubstantive  limiting  principles.    As  a  result,  local \ngovernments are hard-pressed to find any way to regulate the \nadverse health and safety effects of homeless encampments \nwithout running afoul of our court’s case law—or, at a \nminimum, being saddled with litigation costs.  If one picks \nup a map of the western United States and points to a city \nthat appears on it, there is a good chance that city has already \nfaced a lawsuit in the few short years since our court initiated \nits Martin experiment.  Without expressing any view on how \nother district courts or panels of our court should decide \nthese or similar cases pursuant to our existing precedent, I \noffer a few examples of the judicial adventurism our case \nlaw has already produced: \n1.  San Francisco responded conscientiously to Martin.  \nThe police department promulgated an enforcement bulletin \nintended to comply with that case’s dictates while retaining \nflexibility to clear some of the city’s worst encampments.  \nSee Coal. on Homelessness v. City & Cnty. of San Francisco, \nNo. 22-cv-05502-DMR, 2022 WL 17905114, at *3–7 (N.D. \nCal. Dec. 23, 2022).  Pursuant to the bulletin, an officer \ncannot arrest a homeless person for a set of enumerated \noffenses unless SFPD first “secure[s] appropriate shelter.”  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 146 of 155\n146  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nId. at *4 (emphasis omitted).   SFPD policy requires officers \nto work with other city agencies to implement a multi-step \nprocess: The city posts a notice that an encampment clearing \nwill  occur  on  a  particular  date;  city  workers  perform \noutreach  at  the  encampment  the  weekend  before  the \nclearing; and city workers follow up at the encampment 24 \nto 72 hours before the clearing.  Id. at *5–7.  Only then can \nan encampment clearing take place.  To be sure, the record \non SFPD’s compliance with this policy was mixed. The \ndefendants  asserted  that  they  always  comply  with  the \npolicy—“conduct[ing]  regular  training[s]”  on  it,  setting \naside  beds  based  on  an  estimated  acceptance  rate,  and \nproviding  officers  with  the  means  to  check  shelter-bed \navailabilities.  Id. at *13–15, *23.  Some plaintiffs asserted \nthat they never received advance notice of encampment \nclearings or offers of housing.  Id. at *8–9.  Other plaintiffs \nasserted that SFPD sometimes complied with the policy and \n“acknowledge[d] receiving and/or accepting shelter offers at \n. . . encampment closures.”   Id. at *22; see also id. at *10–\n12.  The plaintiffs’ expert opined that San Francisco had a \nshelter-beds deficit but conceded that a “clear way to access \nshelter is via an encampment [closure] while under threat \nfrom law enforcement.”  Id. at *14. \nNonetheless, the court found the mixed record before it \nsufficient to issue a sweeping preliminary injunction.  The \ndistrict court repeatedly returned not to the facts of specific \nplaintiffs  in  specific  encampment  clearings  but  to  the \nconsideration at the center of Grants Pass: whether there is \na shelter-beds deficit.  See id. at *21 (“insufficient stock of \nshelter  beds”);  id.  *22  (“long-standing  shelter  bed \nshortfalls”); id. at *23 (“there are thousands more homeless \nindividuals . . . than there are available shelter beds”); id. at \n*27 (“shortfall of shelter beds”).  The court determined that \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 147 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    147 \nit “need not decide” how offers of housing, when actually \nmade, would impact the constitutionality of arrests or alter \nthe scope of an injunction.  See id. at *23–24.  The court \ninstead issued a broad, if ambiguous, injunction that appears \nto effectively prevent SFPD from enforcing five separate \nprohibitions against homeless persons in San Francisco “as \nlong as there are more homeless individuals . . . than there \nare shelter beds available.”  Id. at *28. \n2.  Phoenix suffered a similar fate.  Like San Francisco, \nit  adopted  a  policy  that  police  “officers  must  make \nindividualized assessments” before issuing citations against \nhomeless  persons  for  certain  offenses.    Fund  for \nEmpowerment v. City of Phoenix, No. CV-22-02041-PHX-\nGMS, 2022 WL 18213522, at *3 (D. Ariz. Dec. 16, 2022).  \nUnlike the San Francisco case, the district court cited no \nevidence in the record showing that Phoenix breached its \npolicy.  Still, the district court issued a sweeping injunction \nafter  conducting  a  merits  inquiry  that  focused  almost \nexclusively  on  the  Grants  Pass  beds-versus-population \ninquiry.  The district court noted that it was “not contested \nthat there are more unsheltered individuals than shelter beds \nin  Phoenix”  and  then  concluded  that  Phoenix’s  policy \n“present[s]  likely  unconstitutional  applications  especially \nwhen the unsheltered in the city outnumber the available bed \nspaces.”  Id.  The city’s enforcement policy—as a mere \n“statement of administrative policy”—was insufficient to \n“forestall the Plaintiffs’ ultimate likelihood of success on the \nmerits.”  Id. (quoting Martin, 920 F.3d at 607).  \n3.    Santa  Barbara  adopted  a  half-measure:  a \ngeographically- and time-limited ban against public sleeping \nthat applied only in the city’s downtown area.  Boring v. \nMurillo, No. CV-21-07305, 2022 WL 14740244, at *1 (C.D. \nCal. Aug. 11, 2022).  Despite the ordinance’s modest scope, \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 148 of 155\n148  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nthe district court still held that the plaintiffs stated a plausible \nclaim to relief pursuant to Martin and denied the city’s \nmotion to dismiss.  See id. at *5–6.    \n4.  Sacramento found itself subject to a lawsuit after \ntaking the innocuous step of removing a portable toilet from \ncity-owned property.  Mahoney v. City of Sacramento, No. \n2:20-cv-00258-KJM, 2020 WL 616302, at *1 (E.D. Cal. \nFeb. 10, 2020).  Though the court ultimately declined to \nissue a temporary restraining order because the plaintiffs’ \nclaims failed on factual grounds, it still interpreted Martin to \ncover  public  urination  and  defecation  prosecutions  and \nstated that “the City may not prosecute or otherwise penalize \nthe plaintiffs . . . for eliminating in public if there is no \nalternative to doing so.”  Id. at *3. \nJudges  Gould  and  Silver  argue  this  “brief  statement \nmade in the context of resolving an emergency motion is not \na solid foundation” on which to suggest that the enforcement \nof public defecation and urination laws may well be suspect \npursuant to our court’s precedent.  In their view, that is \nbecause  Martin  and  Grants  Pass  did  not  involve  a \n“challenge to any public urination or defecation ordinances.”  \nBut  our  decisions  are  not  good-for-one-ride-only  tickets \nforever bound to their specific facts; they serve as precedent \nto which parties analogize in related situations.  Martin \nattempted to limit its reach by explaining that sleep is a “life-\nsustaining activit[y].”  Martin, 920 F.3d at 617.  In their \nconcurrence,  Judges  Gould  and  Silver  offer  a  slightly \ndifferent version of that limiting principle—that sleep is an \n“identifiable  human  need[].”    But  “[w]hat  else  is  [an \nidentifiable  human  need]?    Surely  bodily  functions.”  \nMartin, 920 F.3d at 596 (M. Smith, J., dissenting from denial \nof rehearing en banc).  It is not a slippery-slope fallacy to \nnote a realistic consequence that flows directly from Martin \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 149 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    149 \nand Grants Pass’s reasoning.  Moreover, Judges Gould and \nSilver fail to recognize that something is fundamentally \namiss with our precedent if a city, even if it ultimately \nprevails, must first go to court before it can remove a toilet \nfrom property it owns. \n5.  Chico “constructed an outdoor temporary shelter \nfacility at the Chico Municipal Airport that accommodate[d] \nall 571 of the City’s homeless persons.”  Warren v. City of \nChico, No. 2:21-CV-00640-MCE, 2021 WL 2894648, at *3 \n(E.D. Cal. July 8, 2021).  But the district court cited stray \nlines in Martin in addition to Merriam-Webster’s definition \nof  “shelter,”  conducted  a  single  paragraph  of  analysis, \nconcluded  that  the  airport  shelter  was  not  Martin-type \nshelter, and subsequently enjoined Chico from enforcing its \nanti-camping laws  against “homeless persons in violation.”  \nId. at *3–4.   \nAs the district court itself recognized, this decision (as \nwell  as  the  others  above)  shows  that,  while  the  Martin \nanalysis may be “straight-forward . . . [as] to the facts of [a] \ncase,” the “practical ramifications for the community are \nmuch more complex” and the “concerns raised in the dissent \nfrom the denial of rehearing en banc appear to have come to \nfruition.”  Id. at *4 n.4 (citation omitted).  As I feared, our \ncase law has “prohibit[ed] local governments from fulfilling \ntheir duty to enforce an array of public health and safety \nlaws,” and the “[h]alting [of] enforcement of such laws” has \n“wreak[ed] havoc on our communities.”  Martin, 920 F.3d \nat 594 (M. Smith, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en \nbanc). \n* * * \nI respect the good intentions of my colleagues on the \nMartin panel and in the Grants Pass majority.

CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nparticularly now that it has been supercharged by Grants \nPass, has proven to be a runaway train that has derailed and \ndone substantial collateral damage to the governmental units \nin which it has been applied and those living therein.  These \ncases  use  a  misreading  of  Supreme  Court  precedent  to \nrequire  unelected  federal  judges—often  on  the  basis  of \nsloppy, mixed preliminary-injunction records—to act more \nlike homelessness policy czars than as Article III judges \napplying a discernible rule of law.  I respectfully dissent \nfrom our court’s decision not to rehear Grants Pass en banc. \n \n \nCOLLINS,  Circuit  Judge,  dissenting  from  the  denial  of \nrehearing en banc: \n \nIn my dissent as a member of the panel in this case, I \nexplained that: \n•  Martin v. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584 (9th Cir. 2019), \nis  a  “deeply  flawed”  decision  that  “seriously \nmisconstrued  the  Eighth  Amendment  and  the \nSupreme Court’s caselaw construing it”;  \n•  Even if Martin were correct in its Eighth Amendment \nholding, the panel majority’s decision in Johnson \n“greatly expands Martin’s holding” in a way that is \n“egregiously wrong”; and  \n•  The  panel  majority’s  decision  “make[s]  things \nworse”  by  “combin[ing]  its  gross  misreading  of \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 151 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    151 \nMartin with a flagrant disregard of settled class-\ncertification principles.” \nSee Johnson v. City of Grants Pass, 50 F.4th 787, 814 & n.1 \n(9th  Cir.  2022)  (Collins,  J.,  dissenting).    In  its  “joint \nstatement regarding denial of rehearing,” the panel majority \ntoday recycles many of the flawed arguments in its opinion.  \nI have already explained in my dissent why those arguments \nare wrong.  See id. at 823–31.  The statement of Judge \nO’Scannlain respecting the denial of rehearing en banc and \nParts I and II of Judge M. Smith’s dissent from the denial of \nrehearing en banc—which I join—further cogently explain \nthe multiple serious errors in the panel majority’s opinion.  I \nwill not repeat all of what has already been said, but I think \nthat two points are worth underscoring in response to the \npanel majority’s statement regarding the denial of rehearing. \nFirst,  the  panel  majority’s  statement  confirms  and \nillustrates the layers of self-contradiction that underlie its \nopinion in this case.   \nThe panel majority continues implausibly to insist that \nits  opinion  is  “strictly  limited  to  enforcement  of  the \nordinances against ‘involuntarily’ homeless persons,” which \nwould  suggest—as  Martin  itself  suggested—an \nindividualized case-specific inquiry.  See Panel Majority \nStatement at 94.  But the panel majority also continues to \ninsist  that  the  class  was  properly  certified  because  any \nindividualized  issues  concerning  involuntariness  were \nmoved  into  the  class  definition.    See  Panel  Majority \nStatement at 99–101.  As I have explained, that “artifice” \nignores the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23, because it “rel[ies] on a fail-safe class definition that \nimproperly subsumes this crucial individualized merits issue \ninto the class definition.”  50  F.4th at 827 (Collins, J., \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 152 of 155\n152  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \ndissenting).  The panel majority tries to wave away the \nproblem as merely one of “individualized determinations to \nidentify class members,” arguing that what it did in this case \nis no different than asking whether, for example, a given \nclass member resides in a particular State or performs a \ngiven job for a company.  See Panel Majority Statement at \n101 (emphasis added).  But in sharp contrast to the simple \nfactual  inquiries  in  the  panel  majority’s  examples,  its \nstandard for “identifying” class members here—i.e., whether \na given plaintiff’s homelessness is involuntary under all of \nthe circumstances—is the central merits issue in the case \nunder a correct reading of Martin.  Thus, under the faulty \nclass action upheld by the panel majority, if a particular \nperson’s  individual  circumstances  confirm  that  his \nhomelessness is not “involuntary” in the sense that Martin \nrequires, then his Eighth Amendment claim under Martin \nfails on the merits—and he is then defined out of the class.  \nBut  if  his  homelessness  is  involuntary  under  Martin’s \nstandards, then (under that decision’s reading of the Eighth \nAmendment) his Martin claim is a winner—and he remains \nin the class.  The result is a classic fail-safe class: each “class \nmember either wins or, by virtue of losing, is defined out of \nthe class.”  Olean Wholesale Grocery Coop. v. Bumble Bee \nFoods, 31 F.4th 651, 669–70 n.14 (9th Cir. 2022) (en banc) \n(citation omitted).   \nUnderlying all of this is a fundamental inconsistency \nbetween  the  various  propositions  endorsed  by  the  panel \nmajority’s opinion.  As I stated in my panel dissent, “the \nmajority cannot have it both ways: either the class definition \nis co-extensive with Martin’s involuntariness concept (in \nwhich case the class is an improper fail-safe class) or the \nclass definition differs from the Martin standard (in which \ncase  Martin’s  individualized  inquiry  requires \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 153 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    153 \ndecertification).”    50  F.4th  at  827–28  (Collins,  J., \ndissenting).    Nothing  in  the  panel  majority’s  statement \nresolves  these  internal  contradictions,  which  plague  its \ndeeply flawed opinion. \nSecond, I cannot let pass without comment the panel \nmajority’s contention that a newly enacted Oregon statute \nregulating the application of local ordinances to homeless \nindividuals provides “yet another reason why it was wise to \nnot rehear” this case en banc.  See Panel Majority Statement \nat 112–13 n.7.  Even assuming that this statute will require \nthat  city  laws  such  as  those  challenged  here  must  be \n“objectively reasonable as to time, place and manner with \nregards to persons experiencing homelessness,” under “the \ntotality  of  the  circumstances,”  see  Or.  Rev.  Stat. \n§ 195.530(2),  (5),  the  removal  of  the  objectively \nunreasonable constitutional straitjacket wrongly imposed by \nMartin and Johnson would continue to alter the outcome of \nthis  case  and  would  also  greatly  improve  the  cogency, \ncoherence,  and  correctness  of  Eighth  Amendment \njurisprudence in this circuit.  The panel majority is quite \nwrong in suggesting that this statute provides any grounds \nfor looking the other way and allowing Martin’s cancer on \nour jurisprudence to continue to metastasize. \nI reiterate what I said in the conclusion of my panel \ndissent, which is that both Martin and Johnson “should be \noverturned or overruled at the earliest opportunity, either by \nthis court sitting en banc or by the U.S. Supreme Court.”  50 \nF.4th at 831 (Collins, J., dissenting).  By denying rehearing \nen banc today, we have regrettably failed to overrule Martin \nand Johnson.  I again emphatically dissent. \n \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 154 of 155\n154  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nBRESS, Circuit Judge, joined by CALLAHAN, M. SMITH, \nIKUTA, BENNETT, R. NELSON, MILLER, BADE, LEE, \nFORREST, BUMATAY, and VANDYKE, Circuit Judges, \ndissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc: \n \nLooking  out  the  windows  of  the  Ninth  Circuit’s \ncourthouse in San Francisco, one sees the most difficult \nproblems  plaguing  big-city  America  on  display.  \nHomelessness, drug addiction, barely concealed narcotics \ndealing, severe mental health impairment, the post-COVID \nhollowing out of our business districts.  These problems of \ndisrespect for the law, human suffering, and urban decline \nwould seem connected, the result of a complex interaction of \nforces that defies any easy solution. \nBut on top of everything that our localities must now \ncontend with, our court has injected itself into the mix by \ndeploying the Eighth Amendment to impose sharp limits on \nwhat local governments can do about the pressing problem \nof homelessness—a problem now so often related to every \nother in our great cities.  With no mooring in the text of the \nConstitution, our history and traditions, or the precedent of \nthe Supreme Court, we have taken our national founding \ndocument and used it to enact judge-made rules governing \nwho can sit and sleep where, rules whose ill effects are felt \nnot merely by the States, and not merely by our cities, but \nblock by block, building by building, doorway by doorway.  \nThe  antecedent  question  we  must  always  ask  when \ninterpreting the Constitution is whether a matter has been \nentrusted, in the first instance, to the courts or to the people.  \nThe answer to that question here is clear: we must allow local \nleaders—and the people who elect them—the latitude to \naddress on the ground the distinctly local features of the \npresent  crisis  of  homelessness  and  lack  of  affordable \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/06/2023, ID: 12749500, DktEntry: 100, Page 155 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    155 \nhousing.  And we must preserve for our localities the ability \nto make tough policy choices unobstructed by court-created \nmandates that lack any sound basis in law.  The expanding \nconstitutional common law our court is fashioning in this \narea  adds  enormous  and  unjustified  complication  to  an \nalready extremely complicated set of circumstances. \nNot  every  challenge  we  face  is  constitutional  in \ncharacter.  Not every problem in our country has a legal \nanswer  that  judges  can  provide.    This  is  one  of  those \nsituations.  The decision in Johnson v. City of Grants Pass, \n50 F.4th 787 (9th Cir. 2022), and our decision in Martin v. \nCity  of  Boise,  920  F.3d  584  (9th  Cir.  2019),  on  which \nJohnson is premised, are clearly wrong and should have been \noverruled.  I respectfully dissent from the denial of rehearing \nen banc. ",

It has \nbeen prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 3 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    3 \npermanent  injunction  in  favor  of  plaintiffs;  affirmed \ncertification pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), of a class \nof “involuntary homeless” persons; and remanded. \nThe five municipal ordinances, described as an “anti-\nsleeping”  ordinance,  two  “anti-camping”  ordinances,  a \n“park exclusion” ordinance, and a “park exclusion appeals” \nordinance, result in civil fines up to several hundred dollars \nper violation.  Persons found to violate ordinances multiple \ntimes could be barred from all City property.  If a homeless \nperson is found on City property after receiving an exclusion \norder, they are subject to criminal prosecution for trespass.     \nThe panel stated that this court’s decision in Martin v. \nCity of Boise, 902 F.3d 1031 (9th Cir. 2018), which held that \n“the Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of criminal \npenalties for sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public \nproperty  for  homeless  individuals  who  cannot  obtain \nshelter”  served  as  the  backdrop  for  this  entire \nlitigation.  Pursuant to Martin, it is an Eight Amendment \nviolation  to  criminally  punish  involuntarily  homeless \npersons for sleeping in public if there are no other public \nareas or appropriate shelters where those individuals can \nsleep.  \nThe panel first rejected the City’s argument that the \ndistrict court lacked jurisdiction because plaintiffs’ claims \nwere moot or because plaintiffs failed to identify any relief \nthat was within a federal court’s power to redress.  The panel \nheld  that  there  was  abundant  evidence  in  the  record \nestablishing that homeless persons were injured by the City’s \nenforcement actions in the past and it was undisputed that \nenforcements have continued. The panel further held that the \nrelief sought by plaintiffs, enjoining enforcement of a few \nmunicipal  ordinances  aimed  at  involuntary  homeless \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 4 of 155\n4  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \npersons, was redressable within the limits of Article III.  The \ndeath of class representative Debra Blake while the matter \nwas on appeal did not moot the class’s claims as to all \nchallenged  ordinances  except  possibly  the  anti-sleeping \nordinance.  The panel vacated the summary judgment as to \nthat ordinance and remanded to allow the district court the \nopportunity to substitute a class representative in Blake’s \nstead.  The remaining class representatives had standing to \nchallenge the park exclusion, criminal trespass and anti-\ncamping ordinances.   \nThe panel held that, based on the record in this case, the \ndistrict court did not err by finding plaintiffs satisfied the \nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) such that a class could \nbe  certified  under  Rule  23(b)(2).   Although  the  City \nappeared to suggest that Martin’s need for an individualized \ninquiry  of  each  alleged  involuntary  homeless  person’s \naccess  to  shelter  defeated  numerosity,  commonality  and \ntypicality, the panel held that nothing in Martin precluded \nclass actions.  The panel held that the district court did not \nabuse  its  discretion  in  concluding  the  numerosity \nrequirement was met; that plaintiffs’ claims presented at \nleast one question and answer common to the class; and that \nthe class representatives’ claims and defenses were typical \nof the class in that they were homeless persons who claimed \nthat the City could not enforce the challenged ordinances \nagainst them when they have no shelter. \nAddressing the merits, the panel affirmed the district \ncourt’s  ruling  that  the  City  of  Grants  Pass  could  not, \nconsistent with the Eighth Amendment, enforce its anti-\ncamping ordinances against homeless persons for the mere \nact of sleeping outside with rudimentary protection from the \nelements, or for sleeping in their car at night, when there was \nno other place in the City for them to go.  The panel held that \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 5 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    5 \nMartin applied to civil citations where, as here, the civil and \ncriminal punishments were closely intertwined.   \nThere was no need to resolve whether the fines imposed \nunder  the  anti-sleeping  and  anti-camping  ordinances \nviolated the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on excessive \nfines because the permanent injunction would result in no \nclass member being fined for engaging in such protected \nactivity.  Finally, the panel held that it was unnecessary to \ndecide whether plaintiffs properly pled their procedural due \nprocess challenge to the park exclusion appeals ordinance \nbecause subsequent to the district court’s order, the City \namended the ordinance.   \nThe panel directed the district court on remand to narrow \nits  injunction  to  enjoin  only  those  portions  of  the  anti-\ncamping ordinances that prohibited conduct protected by \nMartin and this opinion.  In particular, the district court \nshould narrow its injunction to the anti-camping ordinances \nand enjoin enforcement of those ordinances only against \ninvoluntarily  homeless  persons  for  engaging  in  conduct \nnecessary to protect themselves from the elements when \nthere was no shelter space available.   \nDissenting, Judge Collins stated that Martin seriously \nmisconstrued  the  Eighth  Amendment  and  the  Supreme \nCourt’s caselaw construing it, but even assuming that Martin \nremains good law, today’s decision—which both misreads \nand  greatly  expands  Martin’s  holding—is  egregiously \nwrong. Although the majority’s phrasing pays lip service to \nthe fact that the persons at issue must be “involuntarily \nhomeless,” the majority also explicitly rejects the City’s \ncontention that the holding of Martin can only be applied \nafter an individualized inquiry of each alleged involuntary \nhomeless person’s access to shelter.  The net result, for class \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 6 of 155\n6  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \ncertification purposes, is that any issue of individualized \ninvoluntariness is set aside and Martin is thereby reduced to \na simplistic formula to be resolved on a classwide basis—\ninto  whether  the  number  of  homeless  persons  in  the \njurisdiction  exceeds  the  number  of  available  shelter \nbeds.  The majority’s analysis fails because Martin does not \nallow the individualized inquiry into involuntariness to be \nset aside in this way.  Further, the majority opinion combines \nits  gross  misreading  of  Martin,  which  requires  an \nindividualized inquiry, with a flagrant disregard of settled \nclass-certification  principles  pertaining  to  commonality \nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and the requirements of Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(b).  The end result of this amalgamation of error \nis that the majority validates the core aspects of the district \ncourt’s injunction in this case, which effectively requires the \nCity of Grants Pass to allow all but one of its public parks to \nbe used as homeless encampments. \nIn a joint statement regarding the denial of rehearing, \nDistrict Judge Silver and Judge Gould wrote that Judge \nO’Scannlain’s statement regarding the denial of rehearing \nand  the  dissent  from  Judge  M.  Smith  significantly \nexaggerate the holding in Johnson v. Grants Pass.  Grants \nPass, relying on Martin, holds only that governments cannot \ncriminalize the act of sleeping with the use of rudimentary \nprotections from the elements in some public places when a \nperson has nowhere else to sleep. It does not establish an \nunrestrained  right  for  involuntarily  homeless  persons  to \nsleep  anywhere  they  choose.   Nor  does  it  require \njurisdictions  to  cede  all  public  spaces  to  involuntarily \nhomeless persons.  Judges Silver and Gould also explained \nthat class certification was proper, that the commonality \nrequirement  was  met,  that  the  majority  applied  existing \nSupreme Court and Ninth Circuit authority to the record \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 7 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    7 \npresented by the parties, and that Judge O’Scannlain greatly \noverstated the extent to which Martin and Grants Pass fall \non one side of an existing circuit split. \nRespecting  the  denial  of  rehearing  en  banc,  Judge \nO’Scannlain,  joined  by  Judges  Wallace,  Callahan,  Bea, \nIkuta, Bennett, R. Nelson, Bade, Collins, Lee, Bress, Forrest, \nBumatay, and VanDyke, and with whom Judge M. Smith \njoins as to all parts except Part II-A, states that with this \ndecision,  this  Circuit’s  jurisprudence  now  effectively \nguarantees  a  personal  federal  constitutional  ‘right’  for \nindividuals to camp or to sleep on sidewalks and in parks, \nplaygrounds,  and  other  public  places  in  defiance  of \ntraditional  health,  safety,  and  welfare  laws—a  dubious \nholding premised on a fanciful interpretation of the Eighth \nAmendment.  Judge O’Scannlain writes that the Boise panel \nmade no effort to ground its decision in the text, history, or \ntradition  of  the  Eighth  Amendment.   Unfortunately,  the \nproblems created by Boise have now been visited upon the \nCity of Grants Pass by the panel majority here, which has \nexpanded  Boise’s  faulty  holding  to  affirm  an  injunction \neffectively requiring the City to resign all but one of its \npublic parks to be used as homeless encampments.  This \nCircuit is the first and only federal circuit to have divined \nsuch a strange and sweeping mandate from the Cruel and \nUnusual Punishments Clause.  The jurisprudence in this case \nis egregiously flawed and deeply damaging—at war with \nconstitutional text, history, tradition, and Supreme Court \nprecedent.  And it conflicts with other circuits on a question \nof exceptional importance—paralyzing local communities \nfrom addressing the pressing issue of homelessness, and \nseizing policymaking authority that the federal system of \ngovernment leaves to the democratic process.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 8 of 155\n8  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nRespecting the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge Graber \nagreed  with  the  basic  legal  premise  that  the  Eighth \nAmendment protects  against criminal prosecution of the \ninvoluntary act of sleeping but stated that the injunctive \nrelief in this case goes too far.  The extension of Martin to \nclasswide relief, enjoining civil statutes that may eventually \nlead  to  criminal  violations  but  have  never  resulted  in \ncriminal convictions for any named plaintiff, is a step too far \nfrom the individualized inquiries inherent both in the Eighth \nAmendment  context  and  in  the  context  of  injunctive \nrelief.  Even assuming that classwide injunctive relief were \navailable against a prosecution for criminal trespass, the \nEighth Amendment does not prohibit all civil remedies that \ncould, in theory, lead to such a prosecution.  In this way, \nJohnson  unjustifiably  expands  the  reach  of  the  Eighth \nAmendment. \nDissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge \nM.  Smith,  joined  by  Judges  Bennett,  Bumatay,  and \nVanDyke, and with whom Judges Ikuta, R. Nelson, Bade, \nCollins and Bress join as to Parts I and II, stated that Martin \ncannot  be  squared  with  the  Supreme  Court’s  Eighth \nAmendment precedent; that the amendment to the original \nopinion is not accompanied by any downstream changes to \nthe  majority’s  application  of  its  rule  to  the  facts  or  its \nultimate conclusion; and that by wholly collapsing the merits \ninto the class definition, the majority opinion certifies an \nimpermissible  “fail  safe”  class.   Local  governments  are \nhard-pressed to find any way to regulate the adverse health \nand  safety  effects  of  homeless  encampments  without \nrunning afoul of this court’s case law—or, at a minimum, \nbeing saddled with litigation costs.  Judge M.

These cases use a misreading of Supreme \nCourt precedent to require unelected federal judges—often \non  the  basis  of  sloppy,  mixed  preliminary-injunction \nrecords—to act more like homelessness policy czars than as \nArticle III judges applying a discernible rule of law.   \nDissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge \nCollins  states  that  the  panel  majority’s  joint  statement \nregarding the denial of rehearing confirms and illustrates the \nlayers of self-contradiction that underlie its opinion in this \ncase, and that the panel majority is wrong to suggest that a \nnewly enacted Oregon statute regulating the application of \nlocal ordinances to homeless individuals provides another \nreason to not rehear this case en banc.  \nDissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge \nBress, joined by Judges Callahan, M. Smith, Ikuta, Bennett, \nR.  Nelson,  Miller,  Bade,  Lee,  Forrest,  Bumatay  and \nVanDyke, states that with no mooring in the text of the \nConstitution, our history and traditions, or the precedent of \nthe Supreme Court, the court has taken our national founding \ndocument and used it to enact judge-made rules governing \nwho can sit and sleep where, rules whose ill effects are felt \nnot merely by the States, and not merely by our cities, but \nblock  by  block,  building  by  building,  doorway  by \ndoorway.  Local leaders—and the people who elect them—\nmust be allowed the latitude to address on the ground the \ndistinctly local features of the present crisis of homelessness \nand lack of affordable housing.

CITY OF GRANTS PASS    13 \nOPINION \nSILVER, District Judge: \nThe  City  of  Grants  Pass  in  southern  Oregon  has  a \npopulation of approximately 38,000.  At least fifty, and \nperhaps as many as 600, homeless persons live in the City.1  \nAnd  the  number  of  homeless  persons  outnumber  the \navailable shelter beds.  In other words, homeless persons \nhave nowhere to shelter and sleep in the City other than on \nthe  streets  or  in  parks.    Nonetheless,  City  ordinances \npreclude homeless persons from using a blanket, a pillow, or \na cardboard box for protection from the elements while \nsleeping within the City’s limits.  The ordinances result in \ncivil fines up to several hundred dollars per violation and \npersons found to violate ordinances multiple times can be \nbarred from all City property.  And if a homeless person is \nfound on City property after receiving an exclusion order, \nthey are subject to criminal prosecution for trespass.      \nIn September 2018, a three-judge panel issued Martin v. \nCity of Boise, 902 F.3d 1031 (9th Cir. 2018), holding “the \nEighth  Amendment  prohibits  the  imposition  of  criminal \npenalties for sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public \nproperty  for  homeless  individuals  who  cannot  obtain \nshelter.”  Id. at 1048.  Approximately six weeks after the \ninitial Martin panel opinion, three homeless individuals filed \na putative class action complaint against the City arguing a \nnumber  of  City  ordinances  were  unconstitutional.    The \ndistrict court certified a class of “involuntarily homeless” \n \n1 During this litigation the parties have used different phrases when \nreferring to this population.  For simplicity, we use “homeless persons” \nthroughout this opinion. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 14 of 155\n14  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \npersons and later granted partial summary judgment in favor \nof the class.2  After the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed some \nclaims not resolved at summary judgment, the district court \nissued  a  permanent  injunction  prohibiting  enforcement \nagainst  the  class  members  of  some  City  ordinances,  at \ncertain times, in certain places.  The City now appeals, \narguing this case is moot, the class should not have been \ncertified, the claims fail on the merits, and Plaintiffs did not \nadequately plead one of their theories.  On the material \naspects of this case, the district court was right.3 \n \n2 Persons are involuntarily homeless if they do not “have access to \nadequate temporary shelter, whether because they have the means to pay \nfor it or because it is realistically available to them for free.” See Martin, \n920 F.3d at 617 n.8.  However, someone who has the financial means to \nobtain shelter, or someone who is staying in an emergency shelter is not \ninvoluntarily homeless. See id. at 617 n.8.  Contrary to the City’s \nargument, this definition of involuntary homelessness is not the same as \nthe definition of “homeless” found in regulations for the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, 24 C.F.R. § 582.5, or the McKinney-\nVento Act, 42 U.S.C. § 11434a(2), the federal law regarding the right of \nhomeless children to a public education.  For example, the McKinney-\nVento Act includes as “homeless children and youths” persons who may \nnot qualify as involuntarily homeless under Martin, such as children and \nyouths “living in emergency or transitional shelters.”  42 U.S.C. § \n11434a(2).  Though the district court noted in part that Plaintiffs met the \ndefinition of homelessness set forth in 24 C.F.R. § 582.5, the district \ncourt also relied on the specific definition of unsheltered homeless \npersons  set  forth  in  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban \nDevelopment’s  regulations  regarding  point-in-time  counts:  “persons \nwho are living in a place not designed or ordinarily used as a regular \nsleeping accommodation for humans must be counted as unsheltered \nhomeless persons.”  24 C.F.R. § 578.7(c)(2)(i).   \n3 Our dissenting colleague’s strong disagreement with the majority \nlargely arises from his disapproval of Martin.  See, e.g., Dissent 56 \n(“Even assuming Martin remains good law . . .”); Dissent 90 (“. . . and \nthe gravity of Martin’s errors.”); Dissent 92 (claiming, without evidence, \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 15 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    15 \nI. \nThis case involves challenges to five provisions of the \nGrants Pass Municipal Code (“GPMC”).  The provisions can \nbe described as an “anti-sleeping” ordinance, two “anti-\ncamping” ordinances, a “park exclusion” ordinance, and a \n“park exclusion appeals” ordinance.  When the district court \nentered judgment, the various ordinances consisted of the \nfollowing.   \nFirst, the anti-sleeping ordinance stated, in full  \nSleeping on Sidewalks, Streets, Alleys, or \nWithin Doorways Prohibited \nA. No person may sleep on public sidewalks, \nstreets, or alleyways at any time as a matter \nof individual and public safety. \nB. No person may sleep in any pedestrian or \nvehicular  entrance  to  public  or  private \nproperty abutting a public sidewalk. \nC. In addition to any other remedy provided \nby law, any person found in violation of this \nsection may be immediately removed from \nthe premises. \nGPMC 5.61.020.  A violation of this ordinance resulted in a \npresumptive $75 fine.  If unpaid, that fine escalated to $160.  \nIf a violator pled guilty, the fines could be reduced by a state \n \nthat “it is hard to deny that Martin has ‘generate[d] dire practical \nconsequences”) (modification in original and citation omitted).  But \nMartin is controlling law in the Ninth Circuit, to which we are required \nto adhere.    \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 16 of 155\n16  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \ncircuit court judge to $35 for a first offense and $50 for a \nsecond offense.  GPMC 1.36.010(K). \nNext,  the  general  anti-camping  ordinance  prohibited \npersons from occupying a “campsite” on all public property, \nsuch as parks, benches, or rights of way.  GPMC 5.61.030.  \nThe term “campsite” was defined as  \nany place where bedding, sleeping bag, or \nother material used for bedding purposes, or \nany stove or fire is placed, established, or \nmaintained for the purpose of maintaining a \ntemporary place to live, whether or not such \nplace incorporates the use of any tent, lean-\nto,  shack,  or  any  other  structure,  or  any \nvehicle or part thereof. \nGPMC  5.61.010.    A  second  overlapping  anti-camping \nordinance  prohibited  camping  in  public  parks,  including \n“[o]vernight parking” of any vehicle.  GPMC 6.46.090.  A \nhomeless individual would violate this parking prohibition if \nshe parked or left “a vehicle parked for two consecutive \nhours [in a City park] . . . between the hours of midnight and \n6:00 a.m.”  Id.  Violations of either anti-camping ordinance \nresulted in a fine of $295.  If unpaid, the fine escalated to \n$537.60.  However, if a violator pled guilty, the fine could \nbe reduced to $180 for a first offense and $225 for a second \noffense.  GPMC 1.36.010(J). \nFinally, the “park exclusion” ordinance allowed a police \nofficer to bar an individual from all city parks for 30 days if, \nwithin one year, the individual was issued two or more \ncitations for violating park regulations.  GPMC 6.46.350(A).  \nPursuant  to  the  “park  exclusion  appeals”  ordinance, \nexclusion orders could be appealed to the City Council.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 17 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    17 \nGPMC  6.46.355.    If  an  individual  received  a  “park \nexclusion” order, but subsequently was found in a city park, \nthat individual would be prosecuted for criminal trespass.     \nSince at least 2013, City leaders have viewed homeless \npersons as cause for substantial concern.  That year the City \nCouncil convened a Community Roundtable (“Roundtable”) \n“to  identify  solutions  to  current  vagrancy  problems.”  \nParticipants  discussed  the  possibility  of  “driving  repeat \noffenders out of town and leaving them there.”  The City’s \nPublic  Safety  Director  noted  police  officers  had  bought \nhomeless persons bus tickets out of town, only to have the \nperson returned to the City from the location where they \nwere sent.  A city councilor made clear the City’s goal \nshould be “to make it uncomfortable enough for [homeless \npersons] in our city so they will want to move on down the \nroad.”  The planned actions resulting from the Roundtable \nincluded  increased  enforcement  of  City  ordinances, \nincluding the anti-camping ordinances.   \nThe year following the Roundtable saw a significant \nincrease in enforcement of the City’s anti-sleeping and anti-\ncamping ordinances.  From 2013 through 2018, the City \nissued a steady stream of tickets under the ordinances.4  On \nSeptember 4, 2018, a three-judge panel issued its opinion in \n \n4 The City issued the following number of tickets under the anti-sleeping \nand anti-camping ordinances:   \n  2013: 74 total tickets \n  2014: 228 total tickets \n  2015: 80 total tickets \n  2016: 47 total tickets \n  2017: 99 total tickets \n  2018: 46 total tickets \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 18 of 155\n18  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nMartin v. City of Boise, 902 F.3d 1031 (9th Cir. 2018). 5  That \ncase served as the backdrop for this entire litigation.   \nIn Martin, six homeless or recently homeless individuals \nsued the city of Boise, Idaho, seeking relief from criminal \nprosecution  under  two  city  ordinances  related  to  public \ncamping.  Martin, 920 F.3d at 603-04.  As relevant here, \nMartin held the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the \n“Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of criminal \npenalties for sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public \nproperty  for  homeless  individuals  who  cannot  obtain \nshelter.”  Id. at 616.  Martin made clear, however, that a city \nis  not  required  to  “provide  sufficient  shelter  for  the \nhomeless, or allow anyone who wishes to sit, lie, or sleep on \nthe streets . . . at any time and at any place.”  Id. at 617 \n(quoting Jones v. City of Los Angeles, 444 F.3d 1118, 1138 \n(9th Cir. 2006), vacated, 505 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir. 2007)) \n(omission in original).   \n \n5 Following the opinion, the City of Boise petitioned for rehearing en \nbanc.  On April 1, 2019, an amended panel opinion was issued and the \npetition for rehearing was denied.  Judge M. Smith, joined by five other \njudges, dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc.  He argued the \nthree-judge panel had, among other errors, misinterpreted the Supreme \nCourt precedents regarding the criminalization of involuntary conduct.  \nMartin, 920 F.3d at 591-92 (M. Smith, J., dissenting from denial of \nrehearing en banc).  Judge Bennett, joined by four judges, also dissented \nfrom the denial of rehearing en banc.  Judge Bennett argued the three-\njudge panel’s opinion was inconsistent with the original public meaning \nof the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause.  Id. at 599 (Bennett, J., \ndissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  The merits of those \ndissents do not alter the binding nature of the amended Martin panel \nopinion.  Unless otherwise indicated, all citations to Martin throughout \nthe remainder of this opinion are to the amended panel opinion.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 19 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    19 \nPursuant to Martin, it is an Eighth Amendment violation \nto  criminally  punish  involuntarily  homeless  persons  for \nsleeping  in  public  if  there  are  no  other  public  areas  or \nappropriate shelters where those individuals can sleep.  Id. \nat  617  n.8  (“Naturally,  our  holding  does  not  cover \nindividuals  who  do  have  access  to  adequate  temporary \nshelter, whether because they have the means to pay for it or \nbecause it is realistically available to them for free, but who \nchoose not to use it.”).  When assessing the number of shelter \nspaces, Martin held shelters with a “mandatory religious \nfocus” could not be counted as available due to potential \nviolations of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause.  \nId. at 609-10 (citing Inouye v. Kemna, 504 F.3d 705, 712-13 \n(9th Cir. 2007)). \nIn  October  2018,  approximately  six  weeks  after  the \nMartin opinion, Debra Blake filed her putative class action \ncomplaint  against  the  City.    The  complaint  alleged \nenforcement of the City’s anti-sleeping and anti-camping \nordinances  violated  the  Cruel  and  Unusual  Punishment \nClause  of  the  Eighth  Amendment,  the  Equal  Protection \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The complaint was \namended to include additional named plaintiffs and to allege \na claim that the fines imposed under the ordinances violated \nthe Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment.  On \nJanuary 2, 2019, a few months after the initial complaint was \nfiled,  and  before  Plaintiffs  filed  their  class  certification \nmotion, the City amended its anti-camping ordinance in an \nattempt to come into compliance with Martin.  Prior to this \nchange, the anti-camping ordinance was worded such that \n“‘sleeping’  in  parks  .  .  .  automatically  constitut[ed] \n‘camping.’”  According to the City, “in direct response to \nMartin  v.  Boise,  the  City  amended  [the  anti-camping \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 20 of 155\n20  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nordinance] to make it clear that the act of ‘sleeping’ was to \nbe distinguished from the prohibited conduct of ‘camping.’”  \nThe City meant to “make it clear that those without shelter \ncould engage in the involuntary acts of sleeping or resting in \nthe City’s parks.”  Shortly after the City removed “sleeping” \nfrom the “camping” definition, Plaintiffs moved to certify a \nclass.  Plaintiffs requested certification of a class defined as  \nAll involuntarily homeless individuals living \nin Grants Pass, Oregon, including homeless \nindividuals who sometimes sleep outside city \nlimits to avoid harassment and punishment \nby [the City] as addressed in this lawsuit. \nPlaintiffs’ class certification motion was accompanied by a \ndeclaration from the Chief Operating Officer and Director of \nHousing  and  Homeless  Services  for  United  Community \nAction Network (“UCAN”), a non-profit organization that \nserves homeless people in Josephine County, the county \nwhere the City is located.6  UCAN had recently conducted a \n“point-in-time count of homeless individuals in Josephine \nCounty.”7    Based  on  that  count,  the  Chief  Operating \n \n6 The Department of Housing and Urban Development regulations \nimpose obligations on the “continuum of care,” which is defined as “the \ngroup composed of representatives of relevant organizations . . . that are \norganized to plan for and provide, as necessary, a system of outreach, \nengagement, and assessment . . . to address the various needs of homeless \npersons and persons at risk of homelessness for a specific geographic \narea.” 24 C.F.R. § 576.2.   \n7 As the “continuum of care” in the City, UCAN was required to conduct \npoint-in-time counts (“PIT counts”) of homeless persons within that \ngeographic area.  24 C.F.R. § 578.7(c)(2).  PIT counts measure the \nnumber of sheltered and unsheltered homeless individuals on a single \nnight.  24 C.F.R. § 578.7(c)(2).  The Martin court relied on PIT counts \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 21 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    21 \nOfficer’s  declaration  stated  “[h]undreds  of  [homeless] \npeople live in Grants Pass,” and “almost all of the homeless \npeople in Grants Pass are involuntarily homeless.  There is \nsimply no place in Grants Pass for them to find affordable \nhousing or shelter.  They are not choosing to live on the street \nor in the woods.”   \nThe City opposed class certification, arguing Plaintiffs \nhad not provided sufficient evidence to meet any of the \nrequirements  for  certifying  a  class.    The  district  court \ndisagreed and certified the class proposed by Plaintiffs.  The \nparties proceeded with discovery and filed cross-motions for \nsummary judgment. \nAt the time the parties filed their summary judgment \nmotions, there were only four locations in the City that \ntemporarily  housed  homeless  persons,  which  proved \ninadequate.  One location was run by the Gospel Rescue \nMission,  an  explicitly  religious  organization  devoted  to \nhelping the poor.  The Gospel Rescue Mission operated a \nfacility for single men without children, and another facility \nfor women, including women with children.  These two \nfacilities required residents to work at the mission six hours \na day, six days a week in exchange for a bunk for 30 days.  \nResidents were  required to attend an approved place of \nworship  each  Sunday  and  that  place  of  worship  had  to \nespouse “traditional Christian teachings such as the Apostles \nCreed.”  Disabled persons with chronic medical or mental \n \nconducted by local non-profits to determine the number of homeless \npeople in the jurisdiction.  See Martin, 920 F.3d at 604.  Courts and \nexperts note that PIT counts routinely undercount homeless persons, but \nthey appear to be the best available source of data on homelessness.  See, \ne.g., id. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 22 of 155\n22  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nhealth issues that prevented them from complying with the \nMission’s rules were prohibited.8   \nIn addition to the Gospel Rescue Mission, the City itself \noperated a “sobering center” where law enforcement could \ntransport  intoxicated  or  impaired  persons.    That  facility \nconsisted  of  twelve  locked  rooms  with  toilets  where \nintoxicated individuals could sober up.  The rooms did not \nhave beds.  The City also provided financial support to the \nHearts with a Mission Youth Shelter, an 18-bed facility \nwhere unaccompanied minors aged 10 to 17 could stay for \nup to 72 hours, and could stay even longer if they had \nparental consent.   \nFinally, on nights when the temperature was below 30 \ndegrees (or below 32 degrees with snow), UCAN operated a \n“warming center” capable of holding up to 40 individuals.  \nThat  center  did  not  provide  beds.    The  center  reached \ncapacity on every night it operated except the first night it \nopened, February 3, 2020.  Between February 3 and March \n19, 2020, the warming center was open for 16 nights.  The \ncenter did not open at all during the winter of 2020-2021.   \nPresented  with  evidence  of  the  number  of  homeless \npersons and the shelter spaces available, the district court \nconcluded “[t]he record is undisputed that Grants Pass has \nfar  more  homeless  individuals  than  it  has  practically \navailable shelter beds.”  The court then held that, based on \nthe unavailability of shelter beds, the City’s enforcement of \nits anti-camping and anti-sleeping ordinances violated the \n \n8 Multiple class members submitted uncontested declarations to the \ndistrict court stating they did not stay at the Gospel Rescue Mission \nbecause they suffer from disqualifying disabilities and/or were unwilling \nto attend church.   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 23 of 155\n  JOHNSON V.

The fact that Martin \ninvolved criminal violations while the present case involved \ninitial civil violations that matured into criminal violations \nmade “no difference for Eight Amendment purposes.”  Next, \nthe  court  held  the  system  of  fines  violated  the  Eighth \nAmendment’s Excessive Fines Clause.9  Finally, the court \nheld  the  appeals  process  for  park  exclusions  violated \nprocedural due process under the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment.   \nIn reaching its decision the district court was careful to \npoint  out  that,  consistent  with  Martin,  the  scope  of  its \ndecision was limited.  The court’s order made clear that the \nCity  was  not  required  to  provide  shelter  for  homeless \npersons and the City could still limit camping or sleeping at \ncertain times and in certain places.  The district court also \nnoted the City may still “ban the use of tents in public parks,” \n“limi[t] the amount of bedding type materials allowed per \nindividual,”  and  pursue  other  options  “to  prevent  the \n \n9 Part of the City’s argument on this issue was that the fines are not \nmandatory because state court judges retain discretion not to impose \nfines.  This is inconsistent with the text of the ordinances and not \nsupported by the record.  The provision of the municipal code defining \npenalties for ordinance violations clarifies that the fines are mandatory.  \nIt provides, the fines “shall be $295” and “shall be $75.”  GPMC \n1.36.010(J)-(K) (emphasis added).  Conversely, it is only discretionary \nto reduce fines because the relevant ordinance provides that, “[u]pon a \nplea of guilty . . . the penalty may be reduced” to the amount listed for a \nfirst or second offense.  Id. (emphasis added).  After a second citation, \nthere is no authority within the municipal code that permits judges to \nreduce fines, and there is no evidence in the record demonstrating circuit \ncourt judges have reduced fines except pursuant to GPMC 1.36.010. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 24 of 155\n24  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nerection of encampments that cause public health and safety \nconcerns.”10   \nApproximately one month after the summary judgment \norder, the district court issued a judgment which included a \npermanent injunction that provided a complicated mix of \nrelief.    First,  the  district  court  declared  the  ordinance \nregarding the appeals of park exclusions failed to provide \n“adequate procedural due process,” but that ordinance was \nnot  permanently  enjoined.    Instead,  the  district  court \nenjoined  only  the  enforcement  of  the  underlying  park \nexclusion  ordinance.    Next,  the  district  court  declared \nenforcement  of  the  anti-sleeping  and  anti-camping \nordinances  against  class  members  “violates  the  Eighth \nAmendment  prohibition  against  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment”  and  “violates  the  Eighth  Amendment \nprohibition against excessive fines.”  Without explanation, \nhowever, the district court did not enjoin those ordinances in \ntheir entirety.  Rather, the district court entered no injunctive \nrelief regarding the anti-sleeping ordinance.  But the district \ncourt permanently enjoined enforcement of the anti-camping \nordinances,  as  well  as  an  ordinance  regarding  “criminal \ntrespassing on city property related to parks,” in all City \nparks at night except for one park where the parties agreed \nthe injunction need not apply.11  The district court also \npermanently  enjoined  enforcement  of  the  anti-camping \nordinances during daytime hours unless an initial warning \nwas  given  “at  least  24  hours  before  enforcement.”  \n \n10 The district court denied summary judgment on other claims brought \nby Plaintiffs.  Those claims were subsequently voluntarily dismissed.   \n11 The City ordinance regarding “criminal trespass” was never at issue in \nthe litigation until the permanent injunction.  Plaintiffs explain it was \nincluded in the injunction “[b]y agreement of the parties.”    \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 25 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    25 \nAccordingly,  under  the  permanent  injunction,  the  anti-\ncamping  ordinances  may  be  enforced  under  some \ncircumstances during the day, but never at night.   \nThe City appealed and sought initial en banc review to \nclarify the scope of Martin.  The petition for initial hearing \nen banc was denied.   \nII. \nThe  core  issue  involving  enforcement  of  the  anti-\ncamping ordinances is governed in large part by Martin.  \nWhile there are some differences between Martin and the \npresent case, the City has not identified a persuasive way to \ndifferentiate  its  anti-camping  ordinances  from  the \nquestioned ordinances in Martin.  Therefore, the district \ncourt’s ruling that the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause \nbars enforcement of the anti-camping ordinances will be \nmostly  affirmed.    We  need  not  address  the  potential \nexcessiveness  of  the  fines  issue  or  whether  Plaintiffs \nadequately pled their due process challenge. \nOur analysis proceeds in five parts.  First, we reject the \nCity’s argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction.12  \nSecond, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court’s \ncertification of a class of involuntarily homeless persons.  \nThird, we agree with the district court that at least portions \nof the anti-camping ordinance violate the Cruel and Unusual \nPunishment clause under Martin.  Fourth, we conclude there \nis no need to resolve whether the fines violate the Excessive \n \n12 However, we vacate summary judgment and remand as to the anti-\nsleeping  ordinance  to  afford  the  district  court  the  opportunity  to \nsubstitute a class representative in place of Debra Blake, who passed \naway while this matter was on appeal.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 26 of 155\n26  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nFines clause.  Fifth, we hold it is unnecessary to decide \nPlaintiffs’ procedural due process claim. \nA. \nStanding and mootness are questions of law that we \nreview de novo.  Hartman v. Summers, 120 F.3d 157, 159 \n(9th Cir. 1997); Foster v. Carson, 347 F.3d 742, 745 (9th \nCir. 2003).  “Federal courts must determine that they have \njurisdiction before proceeding to the merits,” and plaintiffs \nmust demonstrate standing as a necessary component of \njurisdiction.  Lance v. Coffman, 549 U.S. 437, 439 (2007).  \nTo have Article III standing, a plaintiff must show (1) a \nconcrete  and  particularized  injury,  (2)  caused  by  the \nchallenged  conduct,  (3)  that  is  likely  redressable  by  a \nfavorable judicial decision.  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. \nLaidlaw Env’t Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180-81 \n(2000).  For purposes of injunctive relief, “[a]bstract injury \nis not enough”—the plaintiff must have sustained or be in \nimmediate danger “of sustaining some direct injury as the \nresult of the challenged” law.  O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. \n488, 494 (1974) (quotation marks and citation omitted).  \nThe  City’s  appellate  briefing  makes  two  standing \narguments.  First, the City argues Plaintiffs’ claims are now \nmoot because Plaintiffs no longer face a risk of injury based \non the City’s changed behavior after Martin.  Second, the \nCity argues Plaintiffs have not identified any relief that is \nwithin a federal court’s power to redress.  Both arguments \nare without merit. \nA claim becomes moot, and no longer justiciable in \nfederal court, if it has been remedied independent of the \ncourt.  See Genesis Healthcare Corp. v. Symczyk, 569 U.S. \n66, 72 (2013).  There is abundant evidence in the record \nestablishing homeless persons were injured by the City’s \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 27 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    27 \nenforcement actions in the past.  The City argues, however, \nthat it made changes after Martin such that there is no longer \na threat of future injury.  The problem for the City is that \nvoluntary cessation of challenged practices rarely suffices to \nmoot  a  case  and,  in  any  event,  there  is  evidence  the \nchallenged practices have continued after Martin. \n“It is well settled that ‘a defendant’s voluntary cessation \nof a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of \nits power to determine the legality of the practice.’”  Friends \nof the Earth, 528 U.S. at 189 (quoting City of Mesquite v. \nAladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 289 (1982)).  This is so \n“because  a  dismissal  for  mootness  would  permit  a \nresumption of the challenged conduct as soon as the case is \ndismissed.”  Knox v. Serv. Emps. Int’l Union, Local 1000, \n567  U.S.  298,  307  (2012).    Thus,  the  City  “bears  the \nformidable burden of showing that it is absolutely clear the \nallegedly  wrongful  behavior  could  not  reasonably  be \nexpected to recur.”  Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 190.  \nInstead  of  the  City  making  it  “absolutely  clear”  it  has \nstopped enforcement activities, the record shows ongoing \nenforcement.     \nThe parties diverge substantially on how to characterize \nthe  degree  of  enforcement  after  Martin  was  issued  in \nSeptember 2018.  The City argued in its briefing and at oral \nargument that it has largely complied with Martin, noting the \n2019  amendment  to  an  anti-camping  ordinance,  that \ncitations were issued “sparingly” in 2019, and in particular \nit says it issued only two citations during the late evening \nand early morning  since Martin.  The  City supports its \npetition with a declaration from a City police officer stating \n“[i]t is the regular practice of every officer I know of on this \ndepartment to enforce these Ordinances sparingly and in \nrecognition of the different circumstances we encounter.”  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 28 of 155\n28  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nAs  for  Plaintiffs,  they  offered  evidence  showing \nenforcement continued after Martin such that class members \nreceived  citations  and  exclusion  orders  for  camping  or \nsleeping and were prosecuted for criminal trespass between \nthe point the lawsuit was filed and the close of discovery.   \nAlthough the record does show the rate of enforcement \nof  the  various  ordinances  decreased  since  Martin,  even \naccepting the City’s position the evidence is undisputed that \nenforcement continued.13  It is plainly inaccurate for the City \nto claim all enforcement ceased.  The ongoing enforcement \nactivities establish the City did not meet its “formidable \nburden” of showing the challenged activities will not recur.  \nFriends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 190.  The City’s mootness \nargument fails.14 \n \n13 The City also argues “there was no evidence that anyone was ever cited \nfor the simple act of sleeping in a City park” after Martin.  But the \ncitation issued to Dolores Nevin in late December 2019 pursuant to the \nCity’s “criminal trespass” ordinance included a narrative explaining, \n“[d]uring an area check of Riverside Park, Dolores Nevin was found \nsleeping during closed hours.  Nevin, who has been warned in the past, \nwas issued a citation for Trespass on City Property.”  (emphasis added).  \nAnd on September 11, 2019, Grants Pass Police Officer Jason McGinnis \nissued citations to Debra Blake and Carla Thomas for being in Riverside \nPark at approximately 7:30 a.m. with sleeping bags and belongings \nspread around themselves.  The citation given to Debra Blake, a named \nplaintiff, identified the offense as “Criminal Trespass on City Property.”  \nDebra Blake was later convicted of that offense and fined.  Other \nindividuals cited for camping in a city park in 2019 include class \nmembers: Gail Laine, William Stroh, Dawn Schmidt, Cristina Trejo, \nKellie Parker, Colleen Bannon, Amanda Sirnio, and Michael and Louana \nEllis.   \n14 Mootness was also considered during the Martin litigation.  See Bell \nv. City of Boise, 709 F.3d 890, 898, 900-01 (9th Cir. 2013).  The City of \nBoise argued that a combination of an amended definition of “camping” \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 29 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    29 \nThe  City’s  other  jurisdictional  argument  is  that \nPlaintiffs’ claims are not redressable.  According to the City, \nany possible relief intrudes inappropriately upon matters of \npolicy best left to executive and legislative discretion.  We \ndisagree.  Consistent with Martin, the district court granted \nlimited relief enjoining enforcement of  a few  municipal \nordinances at certain times, in certain places, against certain \npersons.  None of the cases cited by the City credibly support \nits argument that the district court injunction overstepped the \njudiciary’s  limited  authority  under  the  Constitution.  \nContrary to the City’s position, enjoining enforcement of a \nfew municipal ordinances aimed at involuntarily homeless \npersons  cannot  credibly  be  compared  to  an  injunction \nseeking to require the federal government to “phase out \nfossil fuel emissions and draw down excess atmospheric \nCO2.”  Juliana v. United States, 947 F.3d 1159, 1164-65 \n(9th  Cir.  2020).    The  relief  sought  by  Plaintiffs  was \nredressable within the limits of Article III.  See Renee v. \nDuncan, 686 F.3d 1002, 1013 (9th Cir. 2012) (holding a \nplaintiff’s burden to demonstrate redressability is “relatively \nmodest”) (citation omitted). \n \nin the ordinance and a “Special Order,” prohibiting police officers from \nenforcing the ordinances when a person is on public property and there \nis no available overnight shelter, mooted the case.  Id. at 894-95.  We \nrejected the argument that the change to the definition of “camping” \nrendered the case moot because “[m]ere clarification of the Camping \nOrdinance does not address the central concerns of the Plaintiffs’ Eighth \nAmendment claims”—that the ordinance “effectively criminalized their \nstatus as homeless individuals.”  Id. at 898 n.12.  And we held the \nadoption of a “Special Order” did not moot the case because the Special \nOrder was not a legislative enactment, and as such it “could be easily \nabandoned or altered in the future.”  Id. at 901.   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 30 of 155\n30  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nFinally, we raise sua sponte the possibility that the death \nof class representative Debra Blake while this matter was on \nthe appeal has jurisdictional significance.  Cf. Fort Bend Cty. \nv. Davis, 139 S.Ct. 1843, 1849 (2019) (holding courts must \nraise issues of subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte).  We \nhold Blake’s death does not moot the class’s claims as to all \nchallenged  ordinances  except  possibly  the  anti-sleeping \nordinance.  As to that ordinance, we remand to allow the \ndistrict  court  the  opportunity  to  substitute  a  class \nrepresentative in Blake’s stead.  \nWith respect to the park exclusion, criminal trespass, and \nanti-camping ordinances, the surviving class representatives, \nGloria Johnson15 and John Logan,16 have standing in their \n \n15 The dissent suggests Gloria Johnson does not have standing to \nchallenge the park exclusion and criminal trespass ordinances.  Dissent \n71-72.    The  dissent  concedes,  however,  Johnson  has  standing  to \nchallenge the anti-camping ordinances, GPMC 5.61.030, 6.46.090.  But \nthe dissent does not provide a meaningful explanation why it draws this \ndistinction between the ordinances that work in concert.  It is true \nJohnson has not received a park exclusion order and has not been charged \nwith criminal trespass in the second degree. However, there is little doubt \nthat her continued camping in parks would lead to a park exclusion order \nand, eventually, criminal trespass charges.  Johnson is positioned to bring \na pre-enforcement challenge against the park exclusion and criminal \ntrespass ordinances, because they will be used against her given the \nundisputed fact that she remains involuntarily homeless in Grants Pass.  \nShe established a credible threat of future enforcement under the anti-\ncamping  ordinances  which  creates  a  credible  threat  of  future \nenforcement under the park exclusion and criminal trespass ordinances. \n16 The dissent claims John Logan has not established standing.  Dissent \n69-71.  During the course of this case, Logan submitted two declarations.  \nAt the class certification stage, his declaration stated he “lived out of \n[his] truck on the streets in Grants Pass for about 4 years.”  During that \ntime, he was “awakened by City of Grants Pass police officer and told \nthat I cannot sleep in my truck anywhere in the city and ordered to move \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 31 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    31 \nown  right.    Although  they  live  in  their  cars,  they  risk \nenforcement under all the same ordinances as Blake and the \nclass (with the exception of the anti-sleeping ordinance, \nGPMC 5.61.020, which cannot be violated by sleeping in a \ncar) and have standing in their own right as to all ordinances \nexcept GPMC 5.61.020.  \n \non.”  To avoid those encounters, Logan “usually sleep[s] in [his] truck \njust outside the Grants Pass city limits.”  However, Logan stated “[i]f \nthere was some place in the city where [he] could legally sleep in [his] \ntruck, [he] would because it would save valuable gas money and avoid . \n. . having to constantly move.”  Logan also explained he has “met dozens, \nif not hundreds, of homeless people in Grants Pass” over the years who \nhad been ticketed, fined, arrested, and criminally prosecuted “for living \noutside.” At summary judgment, Logan submitted a declaration stating \nhe is “currently involuntarily homeless in Grants Pass and sleeping in \n[his] truck at night at a rest stop North of Grants Pass.”  He stated he \n“cannot sleep in the City of Grants Pass for fear that [he] will be \nawakened, ticketed, fined, moved along, trespassed and charged with \nCriminal Trespass.”  The dissent reads this evidence as indicating Logan \nfailed to “provide[] any facts to establish” that he is likely to be issued a \ncitation under the challenged ordinances.  Dissent 70.  We do not agree.  \nThe undisputed facts establish Logan is involuntarily homeless. When \nhe slept in Grants Pass, he was awoken by police officers and ordered to \nmove.  His  personal  knowledge  was  that  involuntarily  homeless \nindividuals  in  Grants  Pass  often  are  cited  under  the  challenged \nordinances  and  Grants  Pass  continues  to  enforce  the  challenged \nordinances. And, but for the challenged ordinances, Logan would sleep \nin the city.  Therefore, as the district court found, it is sufficiently likely \nLogan would be issued a citation that Logan’s standing is established.  \nThat is especially true given the Supreme Court's instruction that a \nplaintiff  need  not  wait  for “an  actual  arrest,  prosecution,  or  other \nenforcement action” before “challenging [a] law.” Susan B. Anthony List \nv. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014). Finally, even if Logan had not \ndemonstrated  standing,  the  dissent’s  analysis  regarding  Logan  is \nirrelevant because this case could proceed solely based on the standing \nestablished by Gloria Johnson and the class.  See Bates v. United Parcel \nServ., Inc., 511 F.3d at 985 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc). \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 32 of 155\n32  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nWith respect to the anti-sleeping ordinance, the law is \nless clear.  Debra Blake is the only class representative who \nhad standing in her own right to challenge the anti-sleeping \nordinance.  Under cases such as Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, \n401 (1975), and Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., Inc., \n424 U.S. 747 (1976), a class representative may pursue the \nlive claims of a properly certified class—without the need to \nremand  for substitution of a new representative17—even \nafter his own claims become moot, provided that several \nrequirements are met.18  See Bates v. United Parcel Serv., \nInc., 511 F.3d 974, 987-88 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc).  If \nDebra  Blake’s  challenge  to  the  anti-sleeping  ordinance \nbecame  moot  before  she  passed  away,  she  could  have \ncontinued to pursue the challenge on behalf of the class \nunder the doctrine of Sosna.  But we have not found any case \napplying Sosna and Franks to a situation such as this, in \n \n17 See Sosna, 419 U.S. at 403 (“[W]e believe that the test of Rule 23(a) \nis met.”); id. at 416-17 (White, J., dissenting) (“It is claimed that the \ncertified class supplies the necessary adverse parties for a continuing \ncase or controversy . . . The Court cites no authority for this retrospective \ndecision as to the adequacy of representation which seems to focus on \nthe  competence  of  counsel  rather  than  a  party  plaintiff  who  is  a \nrepresentative member of the class.  At the very least, the case should be \nremanded to the District Court.”). \n18 The class must be properly certified, see Franks, 424 U.S. at 755-56, \nor the representative must be appealing denial of class certification.  See \nUnited States Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 404 (1980).  \nThe class representative must be a member of the class with standing to \nsue at the time certification is granted or denied.  See Sosna, 419 U.S. at \n403.  The unnamed class members must still have a live interest in the \nmatter throughout the duration of the litigation.  See Franks, 424 U.S. at \n755.  And the court must be satisfied that the named representative will \nadequately pursue the interests of the class even though their own interest \nhas expired.  See Sosna, 419 U.S. at 403.   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 33 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    33 \nwhich the death of a representative causes a class to be \nunrepresented as to part (but not all) of a claim.  The parties \ndid not brief this issue and no precedent indicates whether \nthis raises a jurisdictional question, which would deprive us \nof  authority  to  review  the  merits  of  the  anti-sleeping \nordinance challenge, or a matter of Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23, which might not.   \nBecause Plaintiffs have not moved to substitute a class \nrepresentative  pursuant  to  Federal  Rule  of  Appellate \nProcedure 43(a) or identified a representative who could be \nsubstituted, because no party has addressed this question in \nbriefing, and because we are not certain of our jurisdiction \nto consider the challenge to the anti-sleeping ordinance, we \nthink it appropriate to vacate summary judgment as to the \nanti-sleeping ordinance and remand to determine whether a \nsubstitute representative is available as to that challenge \nalone.  See Cobell v. Jewell, 802 F.3d 12, 23-24 (D.C. Cir. \n2015) (discussing substitution of a party during appeal).  \nSubstitution of a class representative may significantly aid \nin the resolution of the issues in this case.  Remand will not \ncause  significant  delay  because,  as  we  explain  below, \nremand is otherwise required so that the injunction can be \nmodified.  In the absence of briefing or precedent regarding \nthis question, we do not decide whether this limitation is \njurisdictional or whether it arises from operation of Rule 23.   \nWe therefore hold the surviving class representatives at \na  minimum  have  standing  to  challenge  every  ordinance \nexcept the anti-sleeping ordinance.  As to the anti-sleeping \nordinance, we vacate summary judgment and remand for the \ndistrict court to consider in the first instance whether an \nadequate class representative, such as class member Dolores \nNevin, exists who may be substituted.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 34 of 155\n34  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nB. \nThe City’s next argument is the district court erred in \ncertifying the class.  We “review a district court’s order \ngranting class certification for abuse of discretion, but give \nthe district court ‘noticeably more deference when reviewing \na grant of class certification than when reviewing a denial.’”  \nPatel v. Facebook, Inc., 932 F.3d 1264, 1275 (9th Cir. 2019) \n(internal citation omitted) (quoting Just Film, Inc. v. Buono, \n847 F.3d 1108, 1115 (9th Cir. 2017)).  Factual findings \nunderlying class certification are reviewed for clear error.  \nParsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 673 (9th Cir. 2014).   \nA member of a class may sue as a representative party if \nthe member satisfies Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)’s \nfour prerequisites: numerosity, commonality, typicality, and \nadequacy of representation.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a); Mazza v. \nAm. Honda Motor Co., Inc., 666 F.3d 581, 588 (9th Cir. \n2012).  Assessing these requirements involves “rigorous \nanalysis” of the evidence.  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, \n564 U.S. 338, 351 (2011) (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of the Sw. \nv. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982)).   \nIf  the  initial  requirements  of  Rule  23(a)  are  met,  a \nputative class representative must also show the class falls \ninto one of three categories under Rule 23(b).  Plaintiffs \nbrought this suit under Rule 23(b)(2), seeking injunctive or \ndeclaratory relief based on the City having “acted or refused \nto act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that \nfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is \nappropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(b)(2).   \nThe district court found the Rule 23(a) requirements \nsatisfied and certified a class under Rule 23(b)(2).  The \nCity’s arguments against this class certification are obscure.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 35 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    35 \nIt appears the City’s argument is that class certification was \nan abuse of discretion because the holding of Martin can \nonly  be  applied  after  an  individualized  inquiry  of  each \nalleged involuntarily homeless person’s access to shelter.19  \nThe City appears to suggest the need for individualized \ninquiry  defeats  numerosity,  commonality,  and typicality.  \nWhile we acknowledge the Martin litigation was not a class \naction, nothing in that decision precluded class actions.20  \nAnd based on the record in this case, the district court did \nnot err by finding Plaintiffs satisfied the requirements of \nRule 23 such that a class could be certified.   \nTo satisfy the numerosity requirement a proposed class \nmust  be  “so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is \nimpracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  For purposes of \nthis  requirement,  “‘impracticability’  does  not  mean \n‘impossibility,’ but only the difficulty or inconvenience of \njoining all members of the class.”  Harris v. Palm Springs \nAlpine Ests., Inc., 329 F.2d 909, 913–14 (9th Cir. 1964) \n(quotation omitted).  There is no specific number of class \nmembers required.  See Gen. Tel.

To the contrary, at least 13 class members \nsubmitted declarations to the district court indicating that they are \ninvoluntarily homeless. \n20 Other courts have certified similar classes.

The City does not identify how this finding was \nclearly erroneous.  In fact, the City affirmatively indicated to \nPlaintiffs prior to the class certification order that the number \nof homeless persons residing in Grants Pass for the past 7 \nyears was “unknown.”  Further, the only guidance offered \nby the City regarding a specific number of class members \ncame long after the class was certified.  A City police officer \nclaimed in a declaration that he was “aware of less than fifty \nindividuals total who do not have access to any shelter” in \nthe  City.    The  officer  admitted,  however,  it  “would  be \nextremely difficult to accurately estimate the population of \npeople who are homeless in Grants Pass regardless of the \ndefinition used.”   \nThe officer’s guess of “less than fifty” homeless persons \nis  inconsistent  with  the  general  understanding  that  PIT \ncounts routinely undercount homeless persons.  See Martin, \n920 F.3d at 604 (“It is widely recognized that a one-night \npoint  in  time  count  will  undercount  the  homeless \npopulation.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But even \naccepting  the  officer’s  assessment  that  there  were \napproximately  fifty  homeless  persons  in  the  City,  the \nnumerosity requirement is satisfied.

Dissent 77-79.  \nThat misunderstands how the present class was structured.  The dissent \nattempts to reframe the common question as a very general inquiry.  It \nappears  the  dissent  interprets  the  question  whether  an  Eighth \nAmendment violation must be determined by an individualized inquiry \nas whether each individual is “involuntarily homeless.”  To assess that, \na court would have to conduct an individualized inquiry and determine \nif an individual was “involuntarily homeless.”  But that is not the \ncommon question in this case.  Rather, the question is whether the City's \nenforcement of the anti-camping ordinances against all involuntarily \nhomeless individuals violates the Eighth Amendment.  This question is \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 39 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    39 \ndefinition.  Pursuant to the class definition, the class includes \nonly  involuntarily  homeless  persons.23    Individuals  who \nhave shelter or the means to acquire their own shelter simply \n \ncapable of common resolution on a prospective class-wide basis, as the \nrecord establishes.  \n23 The dissent argues this created a prohibited “fail safe” class.  That is \nerroneous.  As noted in a recent en banc decision, “a ‘fail safe’ class . . . \nis defined to include only those individuals who were injured by the \nallegedly unlawful conduct.”  Olean Wholesale Grocery Coop., Inc. v. \nBumble Bee Foods LLC, 31 F.4th 651, 669 n.14 (9th Cir. 2022) (en \nbanc).  Such classes are prohibited “because a class member either wins \nor, by virtue of losing, is defined out of the class and is therefore not \nbound by the judgment.”  Id.  See also Ruiz Torres v. Mercer Canyons \nInc., 835 F.3d 1125, 1138 (9th Cir. 2016) (noting a fail safe class “is one \nthat is defined so narrowly as to preclude[ ] membership unless the \nliability of the defendant is established”).  No such class is present here.  \nThe class was defined, in relevant part, as “[a]ll involuntarily homeless \nindividuals living in Grants Pass.”  Membership in that class has no \nconnection to the success of the underlying claims.  Put differently, the \nclass would have consisted of exactly the same population whether \nGrants Pass won or lost on the merits.  The obvious illustration of this is \nthe class population would not change if a court determined the anti-\ncamping ordinance violated the Eighth Amendment while the anti-\nsleeping ordinance did not. In that situation, class members would not be \n“defined out of the class.” Olean, 31 F.4th at 669 n.14 (citation omitted).  \nRather, class members would be “bound by the judgment” regarding the \nanti-sleeping  ordinance.  Id.  In  any  event,  the  dissent’s  concerns \nregarding individualized determinations are best made when the City \nattempts to enforce its ordinances.  Cf. McArdle v. City of Ocala, 519 \nF.Supp.3d 1045, 1052 (M.D. Fla. 2021) (requiring that officers inquire \ninto the availability of shelter space before an arrest could be made for \nviolation of the City’s “open lodging” ordinance).  If it is determined at \nthe enforcement stage that a homeless individual has access to shelter, \nthen they do not benefit from the injunction and may be cited or \nprosecuted under the anti-camping ordinances.  Moreover, as we noted \nabove, several classes of homeless individuals have been certified in the \npast. See supra note 20. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 40 of 155\n40  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nare never class members.24  Because we find there existed at \nleast one question of law or fact common to the class, the \ndistrict  court  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  in  concluding \ncommonality was satisfied.   \nTypicality asks whether “the claims or defenses of the \nrepresentative parties are typical” of the class.  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(a)(3).  Typicality is a “permissive standard[].”  Staton \nv. Boeing Co., 327 F.3d 938, 957 (9th Cir. 2003) (citation \nomitted).  It “refers to the nature of the claim or defense of \nthe class representative, and not to the specific facts from \nwhich it arose or the relief sought.”  Parsons, 754 F.3d at \n685 (citation omitted).   \nThe  class  representatives’  claims  and  defenses  are \ntypical of the class in that they are homeless persons who \nclaim that the City cannot enforce the challenged ordinances \nagainst them when they have no shelter.  The defenses that \napply  to  class  representatives  and  class  members  are \nidentical.  The claims of class representatives and class \nmembers are similar, except that some class representatives \nlive in vehicles while other class members may live on \nstreets  or  in  parks,  not  vehicles.    This  does  not  defeat \ntypicality.    The  class  representatives  with  vehicles  may \nviolate the challenged ordinances in a different manner than \nsome  class  members—i.e.,  by  sleeping  in  their  vehicle, \nrather than on the ground.  But they challenge the same \nordinances under the same constitutional provisions as other \n \n24 We do not, as the dissent contends, “suggest[ ] that the class definition \nrequires only an involuntary lack of access to regular or permanent \nshelter to qualify as ‘involuntarily homeless.’”  Dissent 84.  It is unclear \nwhere the dissent finds this in the opinion.  To be clear: A person with \naccess to temporary shelter is not involuntarily homeless unless and until \nthey no longer have access to shelter.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 41 of 155\n  JOHNSON V.

The \ndistrict  court  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  in  finding  the \ntypicality requirement met.  \nThe City does not present any other arguments regarding \nclass certification, such as the propriety of certifying the \nclass as an injunctive class under Rule 23(b)(2).  We do not \nmake arguments for parties and the arguments raised by the \nCity regarding class certification fail. \nC. \nHaving rejected the City’s jurisdictional arguments, as \nwell as its arguments regarding class certification, the merits \ncan be addressed.  The City’s merits arguments regarding the \nCruel and Unusual Punishment Clause take two forms.  First, \nthe City argues its system of imposing civil fines cannot be \nchallenged  as  violating  the  Cruel  and  Unusual  Clause \nbecause that clause provides protection only in criminal \nproceedings, after an individual has been convicted.  That is \nincorrect.  Second, the City argues Martin does not protect \nhomeless persons from being cited under the City’s amended \nanti-camping ordinance which prohibits use of any bedding \nor similar protection from the elements.  The City appears to \nhave conceded it cannot cite homeless persons merely for \nsleeping in public but the City maintains it is entitled to cite \nindividuals for the use of rudimentary bedding supplies, such \nas a blanket, pillow, or sleeping bag “for bedding purposes.”  \nSee GPMC 5.61.010(B).  Again, the City is incorrect.  Here, \nwe focus exclusively on the anti-camping ordinances. \nAccording to the City, citing individuals under the anti-\ncamping ordinances cannot violate the Cruel and Unusual \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 42 of 155\n42  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nPunishment Clause because citations under the ordinances \nare  civil  and  civil  citations  are  “categorically  not \n‘punishment’ under the Eight Amendment.”25  The City \nexplains “the simple act of issuing a civil citation with a \ncourt date [has never] been found to be unconstitutional \n‘punishment’ under the Eighth Amendment.”  While not \nentirely clear, the City appears to be arguing the Cruel and \nUnusual Punishment Clause provides no protection from \ncitations  categorized  as  “civil”  by  a  governmental \nauthority.26 \n \n25 This position is in significant tension with the City’s actions taken \nimmediately after Martin was issued.  As noted earlier, the City amended \nits anti-camping ordinance “in direct response to Martin v. Boise” to \nallow for “the act of ‘sleeping’” in City parks.  If the City believed \nMartin has no impact on civil ordinances, it is unclear why the City \nbelieved a curative “response” to Martin was necessary.      \n26 The primary support for this contention is Ingraham v. Wright, 430 \nU.S. 651 (1977).  In Ingraham, the Supreme Court addressed whether \nthe Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause was implicated by corporal \npunishment in public schools.  The Court stated the Cruel and Unusual \nPunishment Clause limits “the criminal process in three ways: First, it \nlimits the kinds of punishment that can be imposed on those convicted \nof crimes; second, it proscribes punishment grossly disproportionate to \nthe severity of the crime; and third, it imposes substantive limits on what \ncan be made criminal and punished as such.”  Id. at 667.  The Court \ninterpreted the challenge to corporal punishment as, in effect, asserting \narguments under  only  the first  or  second  limitation.   That  is,  the \nchallenge  was  whether  “the  paddling  of  schoolchildren”  was  a \npermissible amount or type of punishment.  Id. at 668.  The Ingraham \ndecision involved no analysis or discussion of the third limitation, i.e. \nthe “substantive limits on what can be made criminal.”  Id. at 667.  Thus, \nit was in the context of evaluating the amount or type of punishment that \nIngraham stated “Eighth Amendment scrutiny is appropriate only after \nthe State has complied with the constitutional guarantees traditionally \nassociated with criminal prosecutions.”  Id. at 671 n.40.  When, as here, \nplaintiffs are raising challenges to the “substantive limits on what can be \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 43 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    43 \nPlaintiffs’ focus on civil citations does involve an extra \nstep from the normal Cruel and Unusual Clause analysis and \nthe analysis of Martin.  Usually, claims under the Cruel and \nUnusual Clause involve straightforward criminal charges.  \nFor  example, the situation in Martin involved  homeless \npersons  allegedly  violating  criminal  ordinances  and  the \nopinion identified its analysis as focusing on the “criminal” \nnature of the charges over ten times.  920 F.3d at 617.  Here, \nthe City has adopted a slightly more circuitous approach than \nsimply establishing violation of its ordinances as criminal \noffenses.  Instead, the City issues civil citations under the \nordinances.  If an individual violates the ordinances twice, \nshe  can  be  issued  a  park  exclusion  order.    And  if  the \nindividual is found in a park after issuance of the park \nexclusion  order,  she  is  cited  for  criminal  trespass.    See \nO.R.S. 164.245 (criminal trespass in the second degree).  \nMultiple City police officers explained in their depositions \nthis sequence was the standard protocol.  The holding in \nMartin cannot be so easily evaded. \nMartin held the Cruel and Unusual Punishment clause \n“prohibits the imposition of criminal penalties for sitting, \nsleeping, or lying outside on public property for homeless \nindividuals who cannot obtain shelter.”  920 F.3d at 616.  A \nlocal government cannot avoid this ruling by issuing civil \ncitations that, later, become criminal offenses.  A recent \ndecision by the en banc Fourth Circuit illustrates how the \n \nmade  criminal,”  Ingraham  does  not  prohibit  a  challenge  before  a \ncriminal conviction.  See Martin, 920 F.3d at 614 (“Ingraham did not \nhold that a plaintiff challenging the state’s power to criminalize a \nparticular status or conduct in the first instance, as the plaintiffs in this \ncase do, must first be convicted.”). \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 44 of 155\n44  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nCruel and Unusual Punishment Clause looks to the eventual \ncriminal penalty, even if there are preliminary civil steps.   \nThe  disputes  in  Manning  v.  Caldwell  for  City  of \nRoanoke, 930 F.3d 264 (4th Cir. 2019) (en banc) arose from \na Virginia law which allowed a state court to issue a civil \norder identifying an individual as a “habitual drunkard.”  Id. \nat 268.  Once labeled a “habitual drunkard,” the individual \nwas “subject to incarceration for the mere possession of or \nattempt to possess alcohol, or for being drunk in public.”  Id. \nat 269.  A group of homeless alcoholics filed suit claiming, \namong  other  theories,  the  “habitual  drunkard”  scheme \nviolated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause.  In the \nplaintiffs’ view, the scheme resulted in criminal prosecutions \nbased on their “status,” i.e. alcoholism.  See id. at 281. \nUsing reasoning very similar to that in Martin, the Fourth \nCircuit found the statutory scheme unconstitutional because \nit provided punishment based on the plaintiffs’ status.  Of \nparticular relevance here, the Fourth Circuit reasoned the \nfact that Virginia’s “scheme operate[d] in two steps” did not \nchange the analysis.  Id. 283.  Issuing a civil order first, \nfollowed by a criminal charge, was a “two-pronged statutory \nscheme”  potentially  “less  direct”  than  straightforwardly \ncriminalizing the status of alcohol addiction.  Id.  But the \nscheme remained unconstitutional because it “effectively \ncriminalize[d] an illness.”  Id. The fact that Virginia “civilly \nbrands alcoholics as ‘habitual drunkards’ before prosecuting \nthem for involuntary manifestations of their illness does \nnothing  to  cure  the  unconstitutionality  of  this  statutory \nscheme.”  Id.  \nThe same reasoning applies here.  The anti-camping \nordinances prohibit Plaintiffs from engaging in activity they \ncannot  avoid.    The  civil  citations  issued  for  behavior \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 45 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    45 \nPlaintiffs cannot avoid are then followed by a civil park \nexclusion order and, eventually, prosecutions for criminal \ntrespass.  Imposing a few extra steps before criminalizing the \nvery acts Martin explicitly says cannot be criminalized does \nnot cure the anti-camping ordinances’ Eighth Amendment \ninfirmity.     \nThe City offers a second way to evade the holding in \nMartin.  According to the City, it revised its anti-camping \nordinances to allow homeless persons to sleep in City parks.  \nHowever, the City’s argument regarding the revised anti-\ncamping ordinance is an illusion.  The amended ordinance \ncontinues to prohibit homeless persons from using “bedding, \nsleeping bag, or other material used for bedding purposes,” \nor using stoves, lighting fires, or erecting structures of any \nkind.  GPMC 5.61.010.  The City claims homeless persons \nare  free  to  sleep  in  City  parks,  but  only  without  items \nnecessary to facilitate sleeping outdoors.27   \nThe  discrepancy  between  sleeping  without  bedding \nmaterials,  which  is  permitted  under  the  anti-camping \nordinances,  and  sleeping  with  bedding,  which  is  not,  is \nintended to distinguish the anti-camping ordinances from \nMartin and the two Supreme Court precedents underlying \nMartin, Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660 (1962) and \n \n27 The Grants Pass ordinance does not specifically define “bedding” but \ncourts  give  the  words  of  a  statute  or  ordinance  their  “ordinary, \ncontemporary, common meaning” absent an indication to the contrary \nfrom the legislature.  See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 420, 431 (2000) \n(citation omitted).  The Oxford English Dictionary defines “bedding” as \n“[a] collective term for the articles which compose a bed.”  OXFORD \nENGLISH DICTIONARY.  And “bed” is defined as “a place for sleeping.”  \nMERRIAM-WEBSTER COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 108 (11th ed.).  The \nCity’s effort to dissociate the use of bedding from the act of sleeping or \nprotection from the elements is nonsensical.   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 46 of 155\n46  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nPowell v. Texas, 392 U.S. 514 (1968).  Under those cases, a \nperson may not be prosecuted for conduct that is involuntary \nor the product of a “status.”  See Martin, 920 F.3d at 617 \n(citation omitted).  The City accordingly argues that sleeping \nis  involuntary  conduct  for  a  homeless  person,  but  that \nhomeless  persons  can  choose  to  sleep  without  bedding \nmaterials and therefore can be prosecuted for sleeping with \nbedding. \nIn its order granting summary judgment, the district \ncourt  correctly  concluded  the  anti-camping  ordinances \nviolated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause to the \nextent  they  prohibited  homeless  persons  from  “taking \nnecessary minimal measures to keep themselves warm and \ndry while sleeping when there are no alternative forms of \nshelter available.”  The only plausible reading of Martin is \nthat it applies to the act of “sleeping” in public, including \narticles  necessary  to  facilitate  sleep.    In  fact,  Martin \nexpressed concern regarding a citation given to a woman \nwho had been found sleeping on the ground, wrapped in \nblankets.  920 F.3d at 618.  Martin noted that citation as an \nexample  of  the  anti-camping  ordinance  being  “enforced \nagainst  homeless  individuals  who  take  even  the  most \nrudimentary  precautions  to  protect  themselves  from  the \nelements.”    Id.    Martin  deemed  such  enforcement \nunconstitutional.  Id.  It follows that the City cannot enforce \nits anti-camping ordinances to the extent they prohibit “the \nmost rudimentary precautions” a homeless person might \ntake against the elements.28  The City’s position that it is \n \n28 Grants Pass is cold in the winter.

The dissent concedes that pursuant to Martin, \nthe City cannot impose criminal penalties on involuntarily \nhomeless individuals for sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on \npublic property.  Dissent 62.  Thus, our purported “complete \ndisregard[ ]” for Martin is not regarding the central holding \nthat  local  governments  may  not  criminalize  involuntary \nconduct.    Rather,  the  dissent  believes,  based  on  its \ninterpretation of the Supreme Court opinions underlying \nMartin, that the Eighth Amendment provides only “a case-\nspecific affirmative defense” that can never be litigated on a \nclass basis.  Dissent 59.  To reach this counterintuitive \nconclusion,  the  dissent  reads  limitations  into  Robinson, \nPowell, and Martin that are nonexistent.    \nIn Robinson, the Supreme Court struck down, under the \nEighth Amendment, a California law that made “it a criminal \noffense for a person to ‘be addicted to the use of narcotics.’”  \nRobinson, 370 U.S. at 666.

In a plurality opinion, Justice Marshall upheld \nthe conviction of Leroy Powell on the ground that he was not \npunished on the basis of his status as an alcoholic, but rather \nfor the actus reus of being drunk in public.  Powell, 392 U.S. \nat 535.  Four justices dissented, in an opinion by Justice \nFortas, on the ground that the findings made by the trial \njudge—that Powell was a chronic alcoholic who could not \nresist the impulse to drink—compelled the conclusion that \nPowell’s  prosecution  violated  the  Eighth  Amendment \nbecause Powell could not avoid breaking the law.  Id. at 569-\n70 (Fortas, J., dissenting).  Justice White concurred in the \njudgment.  He stressed, “[i]f it cannot be a crime to have an \nirresistible compulsion to use narcotics, I do not see how it \ncan  constitutionally  be  a  crime  to  yield  to  such  a \ncompulsion.”  Id. at 549 (White, J., concurring).  However, \nthe reason for Justice White’s concurrence was that he felt \nPowell failed to prove his status as an alcoholic compelled \nhim to violate the law by appearing in public. Id. at 553 \n(White, J., concurring).   \nPursuant to Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188 (1977), \nthe narrowest position which gained the support of five \njustices is treated as the holding of the Court.  In identifying \nthat position, Martin held: “five Justices [in Powell] gleaned \nfrom  Robinson  the  principle  that  ‘that  the  Eighth \nAmendment  prohibits  the  state  from  punishing  an \ninvoluntary  act  or  condition  if  it  is  the  unavoidable \nconsequence of one’s status or being.’”   Martin, 920 F.3d at \n616 (quoting Jones, 443 F.3d at 1135).  Martin did not—as \nthe dissent alleges—hold that Powell’s “controlling opinion \nwas Justice White’s concurrence.”  Dissent 60.  See id., 920 \nF.3d at 616-17.  It would have violated the rule of Marks to \nadopt portions of Justice White’s concurrence that did not \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 49 of 155\n  JOHNSON V.

The dissent claims \nJustice  White’s  concurrence  requires  that  the  individual \nclaiming  a  status  must  prove  the  status  compels  the \nindividual  to  violate  the  law—here,  that  each  homeless \nindividual  must  prove  their  status  as  an  involuntarily \nhomeless person to avoid prosecution.29  Dissent 59-63.  The \n \n29 The dissent’s attempt to create a governing holding out of Justice \nWhite’s concurrence is erroneous.  By citing a word or two out of context \nin the Powell dissenting opinion (e.g., “constitutional defense”) our \ndissenting  colleague  argues  both  Justice  White  and  the  dissenting \njustices in Powell agreed any person subject to prosecution has, at most, \n“a case-specific affirmative ‘defense.’”  Dissent 59-60, 77.  We disagree.  \nThough status was litigated as a defense in the context of Leroy Powell’s \nprosecution, no opinion in Powell held status may be raised only as a \ndefense.  The Powell plurality noted trial court evidence that Leroy \nPowell was an alcoholic, but that opinion contains no indication “status” \nmay only be invoked as “a case-specific affirmative ‘defense.’”  As for \nJustice White, the opening paragraph of his concurrence indicates he was \nprimarily concerned not with how a status must be invoked but with the \nfact that certain statuses should be beyond the reach of the criminal law: \nIf  it  cannot  be  a  crime  to  have  an  irresistible \ncompulsion to use narcotics, I do not see how it can \nconstitutionally  be  a  crime  to  yield  to  such  a \ncompulsion.  Punishing  an  addict  for  using  drugs \nconvicts  for  addiction  under  a  different  name. \nDistinguishing  between  the  two  crimes  is  like \nforbidding criminal conviction for being sick with flu \nor epilepsy but permitting punishment for running a \nfever or having a convulsion. Unless Robinson is to be \nabandoned, the use of narcotics by an addict must be \nbeyond the reach of the criminal law. Similarly, the \nchronic alcoholic with an irresistible urge to consume \nalcohol should not be punishable for drinking or for \nbeing drunk. \nPowell, 392 U.S. at 548-49 (White, J., concurring) (internal citation \nomitted).  Finally, neither the remainder of Justice White’s concurrence \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 50 of 155\n50  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \ndissent  claims  this  renders  class  action  litigation \ninappropriate.  But no opinion in either Powell or Martin \ndiscussed the propriety of litigating the constitutionality of \nsuch criminal statutes by way of a class action.30  \nThe law that the dissent purports to unearth in Justice \nWhite’s concurrence is not the “narrowest ground” which \nreceived the support of five justices.  No opinion in Powell \nor Martin supports the dissent’s assertion that Powell offers \nexclusively  an  “affirmative  ‘defense’”  that  cannot  be \nlitigated in a class action.31  Dissent 59, 77.  Although the \n \nnor the dissenting opinion explicitly indicates one’s status may only be \ninvoked as a defense.  Rather, Justice White and the dissenters simply \nagreed that, if Powell’s status made his public intoxication involuntary, \nhe could not be prosecuted.  There is no conceivable way to interpret \nMartin as adopting our dissenting colleague’s position that one’s status \nmust be invoked as a defense.  But even assuming the burden must be \nplaced on the party wishing to invoke a status, the class representatives \nestablished there is no genuine dispute of material fact they have the \nrelevant status of being involuntarily homeless. \n30 Federal courts have certified classes of homeless plaintiffs in the past, \nsee supra note 20, which counsels against the City’s and the dissent’s \nposition that such classes are impermissible under Rule 23.  \n31 As noted above, Martin did not hold homeless persons bear the burden \nof demonstrating they are involuntarily homeless.  See supra note 29.  \nBecause the record plainly demonstrates Plaintiffs are involuntarily \nhomeless, there similarly is no reason for us to determine what showing \nwould be required.  We note, however, that some district courts have \naddressed circumstances in which the question of burden was somewhat \nrelevant.  See, e.g., McArdle, 519 F.Supp.3d at 1052 (requiring, based in \npart on Martin, that officers inquire into the availability of shelter space \nbefore making an arrest for violation of the City’s “open lodging” \nordinance); Butcher v. City of Marysville, 2019 WL 918203, at *7 (E.D. \nCal. Feb. 25, 2019) (holding plaintiffs failed to make the “threshold \nshowing” of pleading that there was no shelter capacity and that they had \nno other housing at the time of enforcement). \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 51 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    51 \ndissent might prefer that these principles find support in the \ncontrolling law, they do not.  We thus do not misread Martin \nby failing to apply the principles found solely in Justice \nWhite’s  concurrence.    Rather,  we  adhere  to  the  narrow \nholding of Martin adopting the narrowest ground shared by \nfive justices in Powell: a person cannot be prosecuted for \ninvoluntary conduct if it is an unavoidable consequence of \none’s status.   \nIn addition to erecting an absolute bar to class litigation \nof  this  sort,  the  dissent  would  also  impose  artificial \nlimitations  on  claims  brought  pursuant  to  Martin.    The \ndissent  concedes  Gloria  Johnson  has  standing  to  bring \nindividual challenges to most of the City’s ordinances.  But \nthe dissent then speculates that Gloria Johnson may, in fact, \nnot be involuntarily homeless in the City.  The dissent would \ninsist that Gloria Johnson, for example, leave the City to \ncamp illegally on federal or state lands, provide the court an \naccounting of her finances and employment history, and \nindicate with specificity where she lived before she lost her \njob and her home.  Dissent 85-88.  There, of course, exists \nno law or rule requiring a homeless person to do any of these \nthings.  Gloria Johnson has adequately demonstrated that \nthere is no available shelter in Grants Pass and that she is \ninvoluntarily homeless. \nThe undisputed evidence establishes Gloria Johnson is \ninvoluntarily  homeless  and  there  is  undisputed  evidence \nshowing many other individuals in similar situations.  It is \nundisputed that there are at least around 50 involuntarily \nhomeless persons in Grants Pass, and PIT counts, which \nMartin relied on to establish the number of homeless persons \nin Boise, revealed more than 600.  See Martin, 920 F.3d at \n604.  It is undisputed that there is no secular shelter space \navailable to adults.  Many class members, including the class \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 52 of 155\n52  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nrepresentatives, have sworn they are homeless and the City \nhas not contested those declarations.  The dissent claims this \nshowing is not enough, implying that Plaintiffs must meet an \nextremely  high  standard  to  show  they  are  involuntarily \nhomeless.  Even viewed in the light most favorable to the \nCity, there is no dispute of material fact that the City is home \nto many involuntarily homeless individuals, including the \nclass representatives.  In fact, neither the City nor the dissent \nhas demonstrated there is even one voluntarily homeless \nindividual living in the City.32  In light of the undisputed \nfacts in the record underlying the district court’s summary \njudgment  ruling  that  show  Plaintiffs  are  involuntarily \nhomeless,  and  the  complete  absence  of  evidence  that \nPlaintiffs are voluntarily homeless, we agree with the district \ncourt  that  Plaintiffs  such  as  Gloria  Johnson  are  not \nvoluntarily homeless and that the anti-camping ordinances \nare unconstitutional as applied to them unless there is some \nplace, such as shelter, they can lawfully sleep.33 \n \n32 The dissent claims we have “shifted the burden to the City to establish \nthe voluntariness of the behavior targeted by the ordinances.”  Dissent \n87 n.13 (emphasis omitted).  To the contrary, as we have explained, we \ndo not decide who would bear such a burden because undisputed \nevidence demonstrates Plaintiffs are involuntarily homeless.  Rather, \nwithout deciding who would bear such a burden if involuntariness were \nsubject  to  serious  dispute,  we  note  Plaintiffs  have  demonstrated \ninvoluntariness and there is no evidence in the record showing any class \nmember has adequate alternative shelter.  \n33  Following  Martin,  several  district  courts  have  held  that  the \ngovernment may evict or punish sleeping in public in some locations, \nprovided  there  are  other  lawful  places  within  the  jurisdiction  for \ninvoluntarily homeless individuals to sleep.  See, e.g., Shipp v. Schaaf, \n379 F.Supp.3d 1033, 1037 (N.D. Cal. 2019) (“However, even assuming \n(as Plaintiffs do) that [eviction from a homeless encampment by citation \nor arrest] might occur, remaining at a particular encampment on public \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 53 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    53 \nOur holding that the City’s interpretation of the anti-\ncamping  ordinances  is  counter  to  Martin  is  not  to  be \ninterpreted to hold that the anti-camping ordinances were \nproperly  enjoined  in  their  entirety.    Beyond  prohibiting \nbedding, the ordinances also prohibit the use of stoves or \nfires, as well as the erection of any structures.  The record \nhas not established the fire, stove, and structure prohibitions \ndeprive homeless persons of sleep or “the most rudimentary \nprecautions” against the elements.34  Moreover, the record \ndoes not explain the City’s interest in these prohibitions.35  \n \nproperty is not conduct protected by Martin, especially where the closure \nis temporary in nature.”); Aitken v. City of Aberdeen, 393 F.Supp.3d \n1075, 1082 (W.D. Wash. 2019) (“Martin does not limit the City’s ability \nto evict homeless individuals from particular public places.”); Gomes v. \nCty. of Kauai, 481 F.Supp.3d 1104, 1109 (D. Haw. 2020) (holding the \nCounty of Kauai could prohibit sleeping in a public park because it had \nnot  prohibited  sleeping  on  other  public  lands);  Miralle  v.  City  of \nOakland, 2018 WL 6199929, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 28, 2018) (holding \nthe City could clear out a specific homeless encampment because \n“Martin  does  not  establish  a  constitutional  right  to  occupy  public \nproperty indefinitely at Plaintiffs’ option”); Le Van Hung v. Schaaf, 2019 \nWL 1779584, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 23, 2019) (holding Martin does not \n“create a right for homeless residents to occupy indefinitely any public \nspace of their choosing”).  Because the City has not established any \nrealistically available place within the jurisdiction for involuntarily \nhomeless individuals to sleep we need not decide whether alternate \noutdoor space would be sufficient under Martin.  The district court may \nconsider this issue on remand, if it is germane to do so.   \n34 The dissent claims we establish “the right to use (at least) a tent.”  \nDissent 89 n.15.  This assertion is obviously false.  The district court’s \nholding that the City may still “ban the use of tents in public parks” \nremains undisturbed by our opinion.   \n35 The dissent asserts, “it is hard to deny that Martin has ‘generate[d] dire \npractical consequences for the hundreds of local governments within our \njurisdiction, and for the millions of people that reside therein.’”  Dissent \n92 (quoting Martin, 920 F.3d at 594 (M. Smith, J., dissenting from denial \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 54 of 155\n54  JOHNSON V.

On  remand,  the  district  court  will  be \nrequired  to  craft  a  narrower  injunction  recognizing \nPlaintiffs’ limited right to protection against the elements, as \nwell as limitations when a shelter bed is available.36    \nD. \nThe district court concluded the fines imposed under the \nanti-sleeping  and  anti-camping  ordinances  violated  the \nEighth Amendment’s prohibition on excessive fines.  A \ncentral portion of the district court’s analysis regarding these \nfines was that they were based on conduct “beyond what the \nCity may constitutionally punish.”  With this in mind, the \ndistrict court noted “[a]ny fine [would be] excessive” for the \nconduct at issue.   \nThe City presents no meaningful argument on appeal \nregarding the excessive fines issue.  As for Plaintiffs, they \nargue the fines at issue were properly deemed excessive \nbecause they were imposed for “engaging in involuntary, \nunavoidable life sustaining acts.”  The permanent injunction \nwill result in no class member being fined for engaging in \nsuch protected activity.  Because no fines will be imposed \n \nof rehearing en banc)) (modification in original).  There are no facts in \nthe record to establish that Martin has generated “dire” consequences for \nthe City.  Our review of this case is governed only by the evidence \ncontained in the record.   \n36 The district court enjoined the park exclusion ordinance in its entirety.  \nThe parties do not address this in their appellate briefing but, on remand, \nthe district court should consider narrowing this portion as well because \nthe  park  exclusion ordinance  presumably  may be  enforced  against \nPlaintiffs who engage in prohibited activity unrelated to their status as \nhomeless persons.   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 55 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    55 \nfor protected activity, there is no need for us to address \nwhether hypothetical fines would be excessive.   \nE. \nThe final issue is whether Plaintiffs properly pled their \nchallenge to the park exclusion appeals ordinance.  GPMC \n6.46.355.  That ordinance provided a mechanism whereby \nan individual who received an exclusion order could appeal \nto the City Council.  Subsequent to the district court’s order, \nthe  City  amended  its  park  exclusion  appeals  ordinance.  \nTherefore, the district court’s determination the previous \nordinance violated Plaintiffs’ procedural due process rights \nhas no prospective relevance.  Because of this, we need not \ndecide if Plaintiffs adequately pled their challenge to the \nprevious ordinance.   \nIII. \nWe affirm the district court’s ruling that the City of \nGrants Pass cannot, consistent with the Eighth Amendment, \nenforce  its  anti-camping  ordinances  against  homeless \npersons  for  the  mere  act  of  sleeping  outside  with \nrudimentary protection from the elements, or for sleeping in \ntheir car at night, when there is no other place in the City for \nthem to go.  On remand, however, the district court must \nnarrow its injunction to enjoin only those portions of the \nanti-camping ordinances that prohibit conduct protected by \nMartin and this opinion.  In particular, the district court \nshould narrow its injunction to the anti-camping ordinances \nand enjoin enforcement of those ordinances only against \ninvoluntarily  homeless  person  for  engaging  in  conduct \nnecessary to protect themselves from the elements when \nthere is no shelter space available.  Finally, the district court \non remand should consider whether there is an adequate \nrepresentative who may be substituted for Debra Blake. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 56 of 155\n56  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nWe are careful to note that, as in Martin, our decision is \nnarrow.    As  in  Martin,  we  hold  simply  that  it  is \n“unconstitutional to [punish] simply sleeping somewhere in \npublic if one has nowhere else to do so.”  Martin, 920 F.3d \nat 590 (Berzon, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en \nbanc).  Our decision reaches beyond Martin slightly.  We \nhold, where Martin did not, that class certification is not \ncategorically  impermissible  in  cases  such  as  this,  that \n“sleeping” in the context of Martin includes sleeping with \nrudimentary forms of protection from the elements, and that \nMartin applies to civil citations where, as here, the civil and \ncriminal punishments are closely intertwined.  Our decision \ndoes not address a regime of purely civil infractions, nor \ndoes it prohibit the City from attempting other solutions to \nthe homelessness issue. \nAFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND \nREMANDED.  \n \n \nCOLLINS, Circuit Judge, dissenting:  \nIn Martin v. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584 (9th Cir. 2019), \nwe held that “the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel \nand unusual punishment bars a city from prosecuting people \ncriminally for sleeping outside on public property when \nthose people have no home or other shelter to go to.”  Id. at \n603.  Even assuming that Martin remains good law, today’s \ndecision—which  both  misreads  and  greatly  expands \nMartin’s holding—is egregiously wrong.  To make things \nworse,  the  majority  opinion  then  combines  its  gross \nmisreading of Martin with a flagrant disregard of settled \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 57 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    57 \nclass-certification  principles.    The  end  result  of  this \namalgamation of error is that the majority validates the core \naspects of the district court’s extraordinary injunction in this \ncase, which effectively requires the City of Grants Pass to \nallow all but one of its public parks to be used as homeless \nencampments.1  I respectfully dissent.   \nI \nBecause our opinion in Martin frames the issues here, I \nbegin  with  a  detailed  overview  of  that  decision  before \nturning to the facts of the case before us. \nA \nIn Martin, six individuals sued the City of Boise, Idaho, \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the City had violated \ntheir Eighth Amendment rights in enforcing two ordinances \nthat respectively barred, inter alia, (1) camping in public \nspaces and (2) sleeping in public places without permission.  \n920  F.3d  at  603–04,  606.    All  six  plaintiffs  had  been \nconvicted of violating at least one of the ordinances, id. at \n606, but we held that claims for retrospective relief based on \nthose convictions were barred by the doctrine of Heck v. \nHumphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994).  See Martin, 920 F.3d at \n611–12 (noting that, under Heck, a § 1983 action may not be \nmaintained if success in the suit would necessarily show the \ninvalidity of the plaintiff’s criminal conviction, unless that \nconviction has already been set aside or invalidated).  What \nremained, after application of the Heck bar, were the claims \n \n1 The majority’s decision is all the more troubling because, in truth, the \nfoundation on which it is built is deeply flawed: Martin seriously \nmisconstrued the Eighth Amendment and the Supreme Court’s caselaw \nconstruing it.  See infra at 90–92.  But I am bound by Martin, and—\nunlike the majority—I faithfully apply it here. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 58 of 155\n58  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nfor retrospective relief asserted by two plaintiffs (Robert \nMartin and Pamela Hawkes) in connection with citations \nthey had received that did not result in convictions, and the \nclaims  for  prospective  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief \nasserted  by  Martin  and  one  additional  plaintiff  (Robert \nAnderson).  Id. at 604, 610, 613–15; see also id. at 618–20 \n(Owens,  J.,  dissenting  in  part)  (dissenting  from  the \nmajority’s holding that the prospective relief claims survived \nHeck).    On  the  merits  of  those  three  plaintiffs’  Eighth \nAmendment claims, the Martin panel held that the district \ncourt had erred in granting summary judgment for the City.  \nId. at 615–18. \nAlthough the text of the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and \nUnusual Punishments Clause states only that “cruel and \nunusual punishments” shall not be “inflicted,” U.S. CONST., \namend. VIII (emphasis added), the Martin panel nonetheless \nheld  that  the  Clause  “places  substantive  limits”  on  the \ngovernment’s  ability  to  criminalize  “sitting,  sleeping,  or \nlying outside on public property,” 920 F.3d at 615–16.  In \nreaching this conclusion, the Martin panel placed dispositive \nreliance on the Supreme Court’s decisions in Robinson v. \nCalifornia, 370 U.S. 660 (1962), and Powell v. Texas, 392 \nU.S.  514  (1968).    I  therefore  briefly  review  those  two \ndecisions before returning to Martin. \nRobinson held that a California law that made “it a \ncriminal offense for a person to ‘be addicted to the use of \nnarcotics,’”  370  U.S.  at  660  (quoting  CAL.  HEALTH  & \nSAFETY CODE § 11721 (1957 ed.)), and that did so “even \nthough [the person] has never touched any narcotic drug \nwithin the State or been guilty of any irregular behavior \nthere, inflicts a cruel and unusual punishment in violation of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment,” id. at 667.  The California \nstatute, the Court emphasized, made the “‘status’ of narcotic \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 59 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    59 \naddiction  a  criminal  offense,”  regardless  of  whether  the \ndefendant had “ever used or possessed any narcotics within \nthe State” or had “been guilty of any antisocial behavior \nthere.”  Id. at 666 (emphasis added). \nIn Powell, a fractured Supreme Court rejected Powell’s \nchallenge to his conviction, under a Texas statute, for being \n“found in a state of intoxication in any public place.”  392 \nU.S. at 517 (quoting TEX. PENAL CODE art. 477 (1952)).  A \nfour-Justice plurality distinguished Robinson on the ground \nthat, because Powell “was convicted, not for being a chronic \nalcoholic, but for being in public while drunk on a particular \noccasion,” Texas had “not sought to punish a mere status, as \nCalifornia did in Robinson.”  Id. at 532 (plurality).  The \nplurality  held  that  Robinson  did  not  address,  much  less \nestablish, that “certain conduct cannot constitutionally be \npunished  because  it  is,  in  some  sense,  ‘involuntary’  or \n‘occasioned by a compulsion.’”  Id. at 533 (emphasis added).   \nJustice White concurred in the judgment on the narrower \nground that Powell had failed to establish the “prerequisites \nto the possible invocation of the Eighth Amendment,” which \nwould have required him to “satisfactorily show[] that it was \nnot feasible for him to have made arrangements to prevent \nhis  being  in  public  when  drunk  and  that  his  extreme \ndrunkenness sufficiently deprived him of his faculties on the \noccasion in issue.”  Id. at 552 (White, J., concurring).  And \nbecause, in Justice White’s view, the Eighth Amendment at \nmost  provided  a  case-specific  affirmative  “defense”  to \napplication of the statute, id. at 552 n.4, he agreed that the \nTexas statute was “constitutional insofar as it authorizes a \npolice  officer  to  arrest  any  seriously  intoxicated  person \nwhen he is encountered in a public place,” id. at 554 n.5 \n(emphasis added).  Emphasizing that Powell himself “did \nnot show that his conviction offended the Constitution” and \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 60 of 155\n60  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nthat Powell had “made no showing that he was unable to stay \noff  the  streets  on  the  night  in  question,”  Justice  White \nconcurred  in  the  majority’s  affirmance  of  Powell’s \nconviction.  Id. at 554 (emphasis added). \nThe four dissenting Justices in Powell agreed that the \nTexas statute “differ[ed] from that in Robinson” inasmuch as \nit “covers more than a mere status.”  392 U.S. at 567 (Fortas, \nJ., dissenting).  There was, as the dissenters noted, “no \nchallenge here to the validity of public intoxication statutes \nin general or to the Texas public intoxication statute in \nparticular.”  Id. at 558.  Indeed, the dissenters agreed that, in \nthe  ordinary  case  “when  the  State  proves  such  [public] \npresence in a state of intoxication, this will be sufficient for \nconviction, and the punishment prescribed by the State may, \nof course, be validly imposed.”  Id. at 569.  Instead, the \ndissenters concluded that the application of the statute to \nPowell was unconstitutional “on the occasion in question” \nin light of the Texas trial court’s findings about Powell’s \ninability to control his condition.  Id. at 568 n.31 (emphasis \nadded).  Those findings concerning Powell’s “constitutional \ndefense,” the dissenters concluded, established that Powell \n“was  powerless  to  avoid  drinking”  and  “that,  once \nintoxicated, he could not prevent himself from appearing in \npublic places.”  Id. at 558, 568; see also id. at 525 (plurality) \n(describing the elements of the “constitutional defense” that \nPowell sought to have the Court recognize).   \nWhile acknowledging that the plurality in Powell had \n“interpret[ed]  Robinson  as  precluding  only  the \ncriminalization of ‘status,’ not of ‘involuntary’ conduct,” the \nMartin panel held that the controlling opinion was Justice \nWhite’s concurrence.  920 F.3d at 616.  As I have noted, \nJustice White concluded that the Texas statute against public \ndrunkenness could constitutionally be applied, even to an \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 61 of 155\n  JOHNSON V.

United States, 430 \nU.S. 188 (1977), this narrower reasoning given by Justice \nWhite for joining the Powell majority’s judgment upholding \nthe conviction constitutes the Court’s holding in that case.  \nSee id. at 193 (“When a fragmented Court decides a case and \nno single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of \nfive Justices, ‘the holding of the Court may be viewed as that \nposition taken by those Members who  concurred in the \njudgments on the narrowest grounds.’” (citation omitted)); \nsee also United States v. Moore, 486 F.2d 1139, 1151 (D.C. \nCir. 1973) (en banc) (Wilkey, J., concurring) (concluding \nthat the judgment in Powell rested on the overlap in the \nviews  of  “four  members  of  the  Court”  who  held  that \nPowell’s  acts  of  public  drunkenness  “were  punishable \nwithout  question”  and  the  view  of  Justice  White  that \nPowell’s acts “were punishable so long as the acts had not \nbeen proved to be the product of an established irresistible \ncompulsion”). \nThe  Martin  panel  quoted  dicta  in  Justice  White’s \nconcurrence suggesting that, if the defendant could make the \nrequisite  “showing”  that  “resisting  drunkenness  is \n \n2 Justice White, however, did not resolve the further question of whether, \nif such a showing had been made, the Eighth Amendment would have \nbeen  violated.

These dicta, Martin noted, overlapped with \nsimilar statements in the dissenting opinion in Powell, and \nfrom  those  two  opinions,  the  Martin  panel  derived  the \nproposition that “five Justices” had endorsed the view that \n“the Eighth Amendment prohibits the state from punishing \nan  involuntary  act  or  condition  if  it  is  the  unavoidable \nconsequence of one’s status or being.”  Id. (citation omitted).  \nApplying  that  principle,  Martin  held  that  “the  Eighth \nAmendment prohibits the imposition of criminal penalties \nfor sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public property for \nhomeless  individuals  who  cannot  obtain  shelter.”    Id.  \nBecause “human beings are biologically compelled to rest, \nwhether by sitting, lying, or sleeping,” Martin held that \nprohibitions on such activities in public cannot be applied to \nthose who simply have “no option of sleeping indoors.”  Id. \nat 617. \nThe  Martin  panel  emphasized  that  its  “holding  is  a \nnarrow  one.”    Id.    Martin  recognized  that,  if  there  are \nsufficient available shelter beds for all homeless persons \nwithin a jurisdiction, then of course there can be no Eighth \nAmendment impediment to enforcing laws against sleeping \nand camping in public, because those persons engaging in \nsuch activities cannot be said to have “no option of sleeping \nindoors.”  Id.  But “so long as there is a greater number of \nhomeless individuals in a jurisdiction than the number of \navailable beds in shelters, the jurisdiction cannot prosecute \nhomeless individuals for involuntarily sitting, lying, and \nsleeping  in  public.”    Id.  (simplified)  (emphasis  added).  \nConsistent with Justice White’s concurrence, the Martin \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 63 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    63 \npanel emphasized that, in determining whether the defendant \nwas being punished for conduct that was “involuntary and \ninseparable from status,” id. (citation omitted), the specific \nindividual  circumstances  of  the  defendant  must  be \nconsidered.  Thus, Martin explained, the panel’s “holding \ndoes not cover individuals who do have access to adequate \ntemporary shelter, whether because they have the means to \npay for it or because it is realistically available to them for \nfree, but who choose not to use it.”  Id. at 617 n.8.  But \nMartin held that, where it is shown that homeless persons \n“do not have a single place where they can lawfully be,” an \nordinance against sleeping or camping in public, “as applied \nto them, effectively punish[es] them for something for which \nthey may not be convicted under the Eighth Amendment.”  \nId.  at  617  (simplified).    Concluding  that  the  remaining \nplaintiffs had “demonstrated a genuine issue of material \nfact” as to their lack of any access to indoor shelter, Martin \nreversed the district court’s grant of summary judgment to \nthe City.

CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nIn an August 2019 order, the district court certified a \nclass seeking declaratory and injunctive relief with respect \nto Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claims, pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).5  As defined in the court’s \norder, the class consists of “[a]ll involuntarily homeless \nindividuals  living  in  Grants  Pass,  Oregon,  including \nhomeless  individuals  who  sometimes  sleep  outside  city \nlimits to avoid harassment and punishment by Defendant as \naddressed in this lawsuit.”     \nAfter  the  parties  filed  cross-motions  for  summary \njudgment, the district court in July 2020 granted Plaintiffs’ \nmotion in relevant part and denied the City’s motion.  The \ndistrict court held that, under Martin, the City’s enforcement \nof the above-described ordinances violated the Cruel and \nUnusual Punishments Clause.    The court further held that, \nfor similar reasons, the ordinances imposed excessive fines \n \nindividual from a City park for a period of 30 days, if within a \none-year period the individual: \nA. Is issued two or more citations in the same City park \nfor  violating  regulations  related  to  City  park \nproperties, or \nB. Is issued one or more citations for violating any \nstate law(s) while on City park property.  \nThe foregoing exclusion order shall only apply to the particular \nCity park in which the offending conduct under 6.46.350(A) or \n6.46.350(B) occurred. \n5 At the time that the district court certified the class, the operative \ncomplaint was the Second Amended Complaint.  That complaint was \nmaterially  comparable  to  the  Third  Amended  Complaint,  with  the \nexception that it did not mention the park-exclusion ordinance or seek \ninjunctive relief with respect to it. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 67 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    67 \nin violation of the Eighth Amendment’s Excessive Fines \nClause.   \nAfter Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed those claims as to \nwhich summary judgment had been denied to both sides, the \ndistrict court entered final judgment declaring that the City’s \nenforcement  of  the  anti-camping  and  anti-sleeping \nordinances  (GPMC  §§ 5.61.020,  5.61.030,  6.46.090) \nviolates “the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel \nand  unusual  punishment”  and  its  “prohibition  against \nexcessive fines.”  Nonetheless, the court’s final injunctive \nrelief did not prohibit all enforcement of these provisions.  \nEnforcement of § 5.61.020 (the anti-sleeping ordinance) was \nnot enjoined at all.  The City was enjoined from enforcing \nthe  anti-camping  ordinances  (GPMC  §§ 5.61.030  and \n6.46.090) “without first giving a person a warning of at least \n24 hours before enforcement.”  It was further enjoined from \nenforcing those ordinances, and a related ordinance against \ncriminal trespass on city property, in all but one City park \nduring specified evening and overnight hours, which varied \ndepending upon the time of year.  Finally, the City was \nenjoined from enforcing the park-exclusion ordinance.6 \n \n6  The district  court’s  summary  judgment  order  and  judgment  also \ndeclared that a separate ordinance (GPMC § 6.46.355), which addressed \nthe procedures for appealing park-exclusion orders under § 6.46.350, \nfailed to provide sufficient procedural due process.  The parties dispute \nwhether this claim was adequately raised and reached below, but as the \nmajority notes, this claim for purely prospective relief has been mooted \nby the City’s subsequent amendment of § 6.46.355 in a way that removes \nthe features that had led to its invalidation.  See Opin. at 55.  Accordingly, \nthis aspect of the district court’s judgment should be vacated and \nremanded with instructions to dismiss as moot Plaintiffs’ challenge to \n§ 6.46.355. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 68 of 155\n68  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nThe City timely appealed from that judgment and from \nthe district court’s subsequent award of attorneys’ fees. \nII \nBefore turning to the merits, I first address the question \nof our jurisdiction under Article  III of the Constitution.  \nPlains Com. Bank v. Long Family Land & Cattle Co., 554 \nU.S.  316,  324  (2008)  (holding  that  courts  “bear  an \nindependent  obligation  to  assure  [them]selves  that \njurisdiction is proper before proceeding to the merits”). \n“In  limiting  the  judicial  power  to  ‘Cases’  and \n‘Controversies,’ Article III of the Constitution restricts it to \nthe traditional role of Anglo-American courts, which is to \nredress or prevent actual or imminently threatened injury to \npersons  caused  by  private  or  official  violation  of  law.”  \nSummers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 492 (2009).  \n“The doctrine of standing is one of several doctrines that \nreflect this fundamental limitation,” and in the context of a \nrequest for prospective injunctive or declaratory relief, that \ndoctrine requires a plaintiff to “show that he is under threat \nof  suffering  ‘injury  in  fact’  that  is  concrete  and \nparticularized; the threat must be actual and imminent, not \nconjectural or hypothetical; it must be fairly traceable to the \nchallenged action of the defendant; and it must be likely that \na favorable judicial decision will prevent or redress the \ninjury.”  Id. at 493.  The requirement to show an actual threat \nof imminent injury-in-fact in order to obtain prospective \nrelief  is  a  demanding  one:  the  Supreme  Court  has \n“repeatedly  reiterated  that  threatened  injury  must  be \ncertainly impending to constitute injury in fact, and that \nallegations  of  possible  future  injury  are  not  sufficient.”  \nClapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S 398, 409 (2013) \n(simplified).    \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 69 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    69 \nAs “an indispensable part of the plaintiff’s case,” each of \nthese elements of Article III standing “must be supported in \nthe same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears \nthe burden of proof, i.e., with the manner and degree of \nevidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.”  \nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  \nBecause,  as  in  Lujan,  this  case  arises  from  a  grant  of \nsummary  judgment,  the  question  is  whether,  in  seeking \nsummary judgment, Plaintiffs “‘set forth’ by affidavit or \nother evidence ‘specific facts’” in support of each element \nof standing.  Id. (citation omitted).  Moreover, “standing is \nnot  dispensed  in  gross,”  and  therefore  “a  plaintiff  must \ndemonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press.”  \nDaimlerChrysler  Corp.  v.  Cuno,  547  U.S.  332,  352–53 \n(2006) (emphasis added) (citation omitted). \nPlaintiffs’ operative complaint named three individual \nplaintiffs  as  class  representatives  (John  Logan,  Gloria \nJohnson, and Debra Blake), and we have jurisdiction to \naddress the merits of a particular claim if any one of them \nsufficiently established Article III standing as to that claim.  \nSee Secretary of the Interior v. California, 464 U.S. 312, 319 \nn.3 (1984) (“Since the State of California clearly does have \nstanding, we need not address the standing of the other \n[plaintiffs], whose position here is identical to the State’s.”); \nsee also Bates v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 511 F.3d 974, \n985 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (“In a class action, standing is \nsatisfied  if  at  least  one  named  plaintiff  meets  the \nrequirements.”).  Accordingly, I address the showing made \nby each named Plaintiff in support of summary judgment. \nIn my view, Plaintiff John Logan failed to establish that \nhe  has  standing  to  challenge  any  of  the  ordinances  in \nquestion.  In support of his motion for summary judgment, \nLogan  submitted  a  half-page  declaration  stating,  in \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 70 of 155\n70  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nconclusory fashion, that he is “involuntarily homeless in \nGrants Pass,” but that he is “sleeping in [his] truck at night \nat a rest stop North of Grants Pass.”  He asserted that he \n“cannot sleep in the City of Grants Pass for fear that [he] will \nbe awakened, ticketed, fined, moved along, trespassed[,] and \ncharged with Criminal Trespass.”  Logan also previously \nsubmitted  two  declarations  in  support  of  his  class \ncertification motion.  In them, Logan stated that he has been \nhomeless in Grants Pass for nearly seven of the last 10 years; \nthat there have been occasions in the past in which police in \nGrants Pass have awakened him in his car and instructed him \nto move on; and that he now generally sleeps in his truck \noutside of Grants Pass.  Logan has made no showing that, \nover the seven years that he has been homeless, he has ever \nbeen  issued  a  citation  for  violating  the  challenged \nordinances, nor has he provided any facts to establish either \nthat the threat of such a citation is “certainly impending” or \nthat “there is a substantial risk” that he may be issued a \ncitation.  Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, \n158 (2014) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  \nAt best, his declarations suggest that he would prefer to sleep \nin his truck within the City limits rather than outside them, \nand that he is subjectively deterred from doing so due to the \nCity’s ordinances.  But such “[a]llegations of a subjective \n‘chill’ are not an adequate substitute for a claim of specific \npresent objective harm or a threat of specific future harm.”  \nLaird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 13–14 (1972).  Nor has Logan \nprovided any facts that would show that he has any actual \nintention or plans to stay overnight in the City.  See Lopez v. \nCandaele, 630 F.3d 775, 787 (9th Cir. 2010) (“[W]e have \nconcluded  that  pre-enforcement  plaintiffs  who  failed  to \nallege a concrete intent to violate the challenged law could \nnot establish a credible threat of enforcement.”).  Even if his \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 71 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    71 \ndeclarations could be generously construed as asserting an \nintention to stay in the City at some future point, “[s]uch \n‘some day’ intentions—without any description of concrete \nplans, or indeed even any specification of when the some day \nwill be—do not support a finding of the ‘actual or imminent’ \ninjury that [the Court’s] cases require.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n564;  cf.  Driehaus,  573  U.S.  at  161  (permitting  pre-\nenforcement  challenge  against  ordinance  regulating \nelection-related  speech  where  plaintiffs’  allegations \nidentified “specific statements they intend[ed] to make in \nfuture election cycles”).  And, contrary to what the majority \nsuggests,  see  Opin.  at  30–31  n.16,  Logan’s  vaguely \ndescribed  knowledge  about  what  has  happened  to  other \npeople cannot establish his standing.  Accordingly, Logan \nfailed  to  carry  his  burden  to  establish  standing  for  the \nprospective relief he seeks. \nBy contrast, Plaintiff Gloria Johnson made a sufficient \nshowing that she has standing to challenge the general anti-\ncamping ordinance, GPMC § 5.61.030, and the parks anti-\ncamping ordinance, GPMC § 6.46.090.  Although Johnson’s \nearlier declaration in support of class certification stated that \nshe “often” sleeps in her van outside the City limits, she also \nstated that she “continue[s] to live without shelter in Grants \nPass” and that, consequently, “[a]t any time, I could be \narrested, ticketed, fined, and prosecuted for sleeping outside \nin my van or for covering myself with a blanket to stay \nwarm” (emphasis added).  Her declaration also recounts \n“dozens of occasions” in which the anti-camping ordinances \nhave been enforced against her, either by instructions to \n“move along” or, in one instance, by issuance of a citation \nfor  violating  the  parks  anti-camping  ordinance,  GPMC \n§ 6.46.090.  Because Johnson presented facts showing that \nshe continues to violate the anti-camping ordinances and \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 72 of 155\n72  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nthat, in light of past enforcement, she faces a credible threat \nof future enforcement, she has standing to challenge those \nordinances.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564.  Johnson, however, \npresented no facts that would establish standing to challenge \neither the anti-sleeping ordinance (which, unlike the anti-\ncamping ordinances, does not apply to sleeping in a vehicle), \nthe  park-exclusion  ordinance,  or  the  criminal  trespass \nordinance.7 \nDebra Blake sufficiently established her standing, both \nin connection with the class certification motion and the \nsummary  judgment  motion.    Although  she  was  actually \n \n7 The majority concludes that Johnson’s standing to challenge the anti-\ncamping ordinances necessarily establishes her standing to challenge the \npark-exclusion and criminal-trespass ordinances.  See Opin. at 30 n.15.  \nBut as the district court explained, the undisputed evidence concerning \nGrants Pass’s enforcement policies established that “Grants Pass first \nissues fines for violations and then either issues a trespass order or \nexcludes  persons  from  all  parks  before  a  person  is  charged  with \nmisdemeanor criminal trespass” (emphasis added).  Although Johnson’s \ncontinued intention to sleep in her vehicle in Grants Pass gives her \nstanding to challenge the anti-camping ordinances, Johnson has wholly \nfailed to plead any facts to show, inter alia, that she intends to engage in \nthe further conduct that might expose her to a “credible threat” of \nprosecution under the park-exclusion or criminal trespass ordinances.  \nDriehaus, 573 U.S. at 159 (citation omitted).  Johnson’s declaration \nstates that she has been homeless in Grants Pass for three years, but it \ndoes not contend that she has ever been issued, or threatened with \nissuance of, a trespass order, a park-exclusion order, or a criminal \ntrespass charge or that she has “an intention to engage in a course of \nconduct” that would lead to such an order or charge.  Id. (citation \nomitted).    Because  “standing  is  not  dispensed  in  gross,”  see \nDaimlerChrysler, 547 U.S. at 353 (citation omitted), Johnson must \nseparately establish her standing with respect to each ordinance, and she \nhas failed to do so with respect to the park-exclusion and criminal-\ntrespass ordinances. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 73 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    73 \nliving in temporary housing at the time she submitted her \ndeclarations in support of class certification in March and \nJune 2019, she explained that that temporary housing would \nsoon expire; that she would become homeless in Grants Pass \nagain; and that she would therefore again be subject to being \n“arrested, ticketed and prosecuted for sleeping outside or for \ncovering myself with a blanket to stay warm.”  And, as her \ndeclaration at summary judgment showed, that is exactly \nwhat  happened:  in  September  2019,  she  was  cited  for \nsleeping  in  the  park  in  violation  of  GPMC  § 6.46.090, \nconvicted, and fined.  Her declarations also confirmed that \nBlake’s persistence in sleeping and camping in a variety of \nplaces in Grants Pass had also resulted in a park-exclusion \norder (which she successfully appealed), and in citations for \nviolation of the anti-sleeping ordinance, GPMC § 5.61.020 \n(for sleeping in an alley), and for criminal trespass on City \nproperty.  Based on this showing, I conclude that Blake \nestablished standing to challenge each of the ordinances at \nissue in the district court’s judgment.   \nHowever, Blake subsequently passed away during this \nlitigation,  as  her  counsel  noted  in  a  letter  to  this  court \nsubmitted under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 43(a).  \nBecause  the  only  relief  she  sought  was  prospective \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, Blake’s death moots her \nclaims.  King v. County of Los Angeles, 885 F.3d 548, 553, \n559 (9th Cir. 2018).

Under Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393 \n(1975), the answer to that question would appear to be no.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 74 of 155\n74  JOHNSON V.

See Sosna, \n419 U.S. at 403 (holding that a previously proper class representative \nwhose claims had become moot on appeal could continue to represent \nthe class for purposes of that appeal); see also Bates, 511 F.3d at 987 \n(emphasizing that the named plaintiff “had standing at the time of \ncertification”); B.K. ex rel.

CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nA \n“To obtain certification of a plaintiff class under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23, a plaintiff must satisfy both the \nfour  requirements  of  Rule  23(a)—‘numerosity, \ncommonality, typicality, and adequate representation’—and \n‘one of the three requirements listed in Rule 23(b).’”  A.B. v. \nHawaii State Dep’t of Educ., 30 F.4th 828, 834 (9th Cir. \n2022) (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. \n338, 345, 349 (2011)).  Commonality, which is contested \nhere, requires a showing that the class members’ claims \n“depend upon a common contention” that is “of such a \nnature  that  it  is  capable  of  classwide  resolution—which \nmeans that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve \nan issue that is central to the validity of each one of the \nclaims in one stroke.”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350.  In finding \nthat commonality was satisfied with respect to the Eighth \nAmendment claims, the district court relied solely on the \npremise that whether the City’s conduct “violates the Eighth \nAmendment” was a common question that could be resolved \non a classwide basis.  And in finding that Rule 23(b) was \nsatisfied  here,  the  district  court  relied  solely  on  Rule \n23(b)(2),  which  provides  that  a  “class  action  may  be \nmaintained” if “the party opposing the class has acted or \nrefused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so \nthat final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief \nis appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  FED. R. CIV. \nP. 23(b)(2).  That requirement was satisfied, the district court \nconcluded,  because  (for  reasons  similar  to  those  that \nunderlay its commonality analysis) the City’s challenged \nenforcement of the ordinances “applies equally to all class \nmembers.”    The  district  court’s  commonality  and  Rule \n23(b)(2) analyses are both flawed because they are based on \nan incorrect understanding of our decision in Martin. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 77 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    77 \nAs the earlier discussion of Martin makes clear, the \nEighth Amendment theory adopted in that case requires an \nindividualized  inquiry  in  order  to  assess  whether  any \nindividuals to whom the challenged ordinances are being \napplied  “do  have  access  to  adequate  temporary  shelter, \nwhether because they have the means to pay for it or because \nit is realistically available to them for free, but who choose \nnot to use it.”  920 F.3d at 617 n.8.  See supra at 61–63.  Only \nwhen persons “do not have a single place where they can \nlawfully be,” can it be said that an ordinance against sleeping \nor  camping  in  public,  “as  applied  to  them,  effectively \npunish[es] them for something for which they may not be \nconvicted  under  the  Eighth  Amendment.”    Id.  at  617 \n(simplified) (emphasis added).   \nOf  course,  such  an  individualized  inquiry  is  not \nrequired—and no Eighth Amendment violation occurs under \nMartin—when the defendant can show that there is adequate \nshelter  space  to  house  all  homeless  persons  in  the \njurisdiction.  Id.  But the converse is not true—the mere fact \nthat a city’s shelters are full does not by itself establish, \nwithout more, that any particular person who is sleeping in \npublic does “not have a single place where [he or she] can \nlawfully be.”  Id.  The logic of Martin, and of the opinions \nin Powell on which it is based, requires an assessment of a \nperson’s individual situation before it can be said that the \nEighth  Amendment  would  be  violated  by  applying  a \nparticular provision against that person.  Indeed, the opinions \nin  Powell  on  which  Martin  relied—Justice  White’s \nconcurring  opinion  and  the  opinion  of  the  dissenting \nJustices—all agreed that, at most, the Eighth Amendment \nprovided  a  case-specific  affirmative  defense  that  would \nrequire the defendant to provide a “satisfactor[y] showing \nthat it was not feasible for him to have made arrangements” \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 78 of 155\n78  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nto avoid the conduct at issue.  Powell, 392 U.S. at 552 \n(White, J., concurring); id. at 568 n.31 (Fortas, J., dissenting) \n(agreeing with Justice White that the issue is whether the \ndefendant “on the occasion in question” had shown that \navoiding the conduct was “impossible”); see also supra at \n59–60.9 \nIn light of this understanding of Martin, the district court \nclearly erred in finding that the requirement of commonality \nwas met here.  “What matters to class certification is not the \nraising of common ‘questions’—even in droves—but rather, \nthe capacity of a class-wide proceeding to generate common \nanswers  apt  to  drive  the  resolution  of  the  litigation.  \nDissimilarities within the proposed class are what have the \npotential to impede the generation of common answers.”  \n \n9 The majority incorrectly contends that the dissenters in Powell did not \nendorse Justice White’s conclusion that the defendant bears the burden \nto establish that his or her conduct was involuntary.  See Opin. at 48–51.  \nOn the contrary, the Powell dissenters’ entire argument rested on the \naffirmative “constitutional defense” presented at the trial in that case and \non the findings made by the trial court in connection with that defense.  \nSee 392 U.S. at 558 (Fortas, J., dissenting).  The majority’s suggestion \nthat I have taken that explicit reference to Powell’s defense “out of \ncontext,” see Opin. at 49 n.29, is demonstrably wrong—the context of \nthe case was precisely the extensive affirmative defense that Powell \npresented at trial, including the testimony of an expert.  See 392 U.S. at \n517–26 (plurality) (summarizing the testimony).  And, of course, in \nMartin, the issue was raised in the context of a § 1983 action in which \nthe  plaintiffs  challenging  the  laws  bore  the  burden  to  prove  the \ninvoluntariness of their relevant conduct.  The majority points to nothing \nthat would plausibly support the view that Powell and Martin might \nrequire the government to carry the burden to establish voluntariness.  \nSee Opin. at 50 n.31 (leaving this issue open).  The majority claims that \nit can sidestep this issue here, but that is also wrong: the burden issue is \ncritical  both  to  the  class-certification  analysis  and  to  the  issue  of \nsummary judgment on the merits.  See infra at 78–89. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 79 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    79 \nWal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350 (simplified).  Under Martin, the \nanswer to the question whether the City’s enforcement of \neach of the anti-camping ordinances violates the Eighth \nAmendment turns on the individual circumstances of each \nperson to whom the ordinance is being applied on a given \noccasion.    That  question  is  simply  not  one  that  can  be \nresolved, on a common basis, “in one stroke.”  Id.  That \nrequires decertification. \nFor  similar  reasons,  the  district  court  also  erred  in \nconcluding that the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) were met.  \nBy  its  terms,  Rule  23(b)(2)  is  satisfied  only  if  (1) the \ndefendant has acted (or refused to act) on grounds that are \ngenerally applicable to the class as whole and (2) as a result, \nfinal classwide or injunctive relief is appropriate.  As the \nSupreme Court has observed, “[t]he key to the (b)(2) class is \n‘the  indivisible  nature  of  the  injunctive  or  declaratory \nremedy warranted—the notion that the conduct is such that \nit can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the \nclass members or as to none of them.’”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. \nat  360.    It  follows  that,  when  the  wrongfulness  of  the \nchallenged  conduct  with  respect  to  any  particular  class \nmember  depends  critically  upon  the  individual \ncircumstances of that class member, a class action under \nRule 23(b)(2) is not appropriate.  In such a case, in which \n(for example) the challenged enforcement of a particular law \nmay be lawful as to some persons and not as to others, \ndepending upon their individual circumstances, the all-or-\nnothing determination of wrongfulness that is the foundation \nof a (b)(2) class is absent: in such a case, it is simply not true \nthat the defendant’s “conduct is such that it can be enjoined \nor declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or \nas to none of them.’”  Id. (emphasis added).   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 80 of 155\n80  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nBecause Martin requires an assessment of each person’s \nindividual  circumstances  in  order  to  determine  whether \napplication of the challenged ordinances violates the Eighth \nAmendment, these standards for the application of Rule \n23(b)(2) were plainly not met in this case.  That is, because \nthe applicable law governing Plaintiffs’ claims would entail \n“a  process  through  which  highly  individualized \ndeterminations  of  liability  and  remedy  are  made,” \ncertification of a class under Rule 23(b)(2) is improper.  \nJamie S. v. Milwaukee Pub. Sch., 668 F.3d 481, 499 (7th Cir. \n2012).  Moreover, the mere fact that the district court’s final \njudgment  imposes  sweeping  across-the-board  injunctive \nrelief that disregards individual differences in determining \nthe defendant’s liability does not mean that Rule 23(b)(2) \nhas been satisfied.  The rule requires that any such classwide \nrelief be rooted in a determination of classwide liability—\nthe defendant must have acted, or be acting, unlawfully “on \ngrounds  that  apply  generally  to  the  class,  so  that  final \ninjunctive or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate \nrespecting the class as a whole.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(2) \n(emphasis added).  That requirement was not established \nhere, and the class must be decertified. 10 \n \n10 The majority wrongly concludes that the City has forfeited any \nargument  concerning  Rule  23(b)(2)  because  it  did  not  specifically \nmention that subdivision of the rule in its opening brief.  Opin. at 41.  \nThis “Simon Says” approach to reading briefs is wrong.  The substance \nof the argument is contained in the opening brief, in which the City \nexplicitly  contended  that  Martin  requires  “a  more  individualized \nanalysis” than the district court applied and that, as a result, “neither FED. \nR. CIV. P. 23 nor Martin provide plaintiffs the ability to establish the type \nof sweeping class-wide claims advanced in this case.”  Indeed, Plaintiffs \nthemselves responded to this argument, in their answering brief, by \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 81 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    81 \nB \nThe majority provides two responses to this analysis, but \nboth of them are wrong.   \nFirst, the majority contends that Martin established a \nbright-line  rule  that  the  government  cannot  prosecute \n“involuntarily homeless persons for sleeping in public”—or, \npresumably, for camping—“if there are no other public areas \nor appropriate shelters where those individuals can sleep.”  \nSee Opin. at 19.  As the majority makes clear, that latter \ninquiry into available shelter space turns on whether “the \nnumber of homeless persons outnumber the available shelter \nbeds,” except that, “[w]hen assessing the number of shelter \nspaces,” shelters that have a “mandatory religious focus” are \nnot to be counted.  See Opin. at 13, 19 (citation omitted).  \nMoreover, although the majority’s phrasing pays lip service \nto the fact that the persons at issue must be “involuntarily \nhomeless,” the majority also explicitly rejects the City’s \ncontention that “the holding of Martin can only be applied \nafter an individualized inquiry of each alleged involuntarily \nhomeless person’s access to shelter.”  See Opin. at 35.  The \nnet result, for class certification purposes, is that any issue of \nindividualized involuntariness is set aside and Martin is \nthereby reduced to a simplistic formula—to be resolved on a \nclasswide  basis—into  whether  the  number  of  homeless \npersons in the jurisdiction exceeds the number of available \nshelter beds.  See Opin. at 34–35, 38.   \nThe majority’s analysis fails, because Martin does not \nallow the individualized inquiry into involuntariness to be \nset  aside  in  this  way.    Martin  states  that,  if  there  are \n \nexplaining why they believe that the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) were \nmet. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 82 of 155\n82  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \ninsufficient available beds at shelters, then a jurisdiction \n“cannot prosecute homeless individuals for ‘involuntarily \nsitting, lying, and sleeping in public.’”  920 F.3d at 617 \n(emphasis added).  The lack of adequate shelter beds thus \nmerely eliminates a safe-harbor that might otherwise have \nallowed  a  jurisdiction  to  prosecute  violations  of  such \nordinances without regard to individual circumstances, with \nthe result that the  jurisdiction’s enforcement power will \ninstead depend upon whether the conduct of the individual \non a particular occasion was “involuntar[y].”  Id.  Martin \nconfirms that the resulting inquiry turns on whether the \npersons in question have access to “a single place where they \ncan  lawfully  be,”  id.  at  617  (emphasis  added)  (citation \nomitted),  and  not  just  on  whether  they  have  access  to \n“appropriate  shelters” or “other public areas.”   And the \nmajority’s misreading of Martin completely disregards the \nPowell  opinions  on  which  Martin  relied,  which  make \nunmistakably  clear  that  an  individualized  showing  of \ninvoluntariness is required.   \nSecond, and relatedly, the majority states that, to the \nextent that Martin requires such an individualized showing \nto  establish  an  Eighth  Amendment  violation,  any  such \nindividualized issue here has been eliminated by the fact that \n“[p]ursuant to the class definition, the class includes only \ninvoluntarily homeless persons.”  See Opin. at 38–40 (first \nemphasis added).  As the majority acknowledges, “[p]ersons \nare involuntarily homeless” under Martin only “if they do \nnot ‘have access to adequate temporary shelter,’” such as, \nfor example, when they lack “‘the means to pay for it’” and \nit is otherwise not “‘realistically available to them for free.’”  \nOpin. at 14 n.2 (quoting Martin, 920 F.3d at  617 n.8).  \nBecause that individualized issue has been shifted into the \nclass definition, the majority holds, the City’s enforcement \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 83 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    83 \nof the challenged ordinances against that class can in that \nsense be understood to present a “common question” that \ncan be resolved in one stroke.  According to the majority, \nbecause the class definition requires that, at the time the \nordinances are applied against them, the class members must \nbe  “involuntarily  homeless”  in  the  sense  that  Martin \nrequires, there is a common question as to whether “the \nCity’s enforcement of the anti-camping ordinances against \nall involuntarily homeless individuals violates the Eighth \nAmendment.”  See Opin. at 38–39 & n.22. \nThe  majority  cites  no  authority  for  this  audacious \nbootstrap argument.  If a person’s individual circumstances \nare such that he or she has no “access to adequate temporary \nshelter”—which necessarily subsumes (among other things) \nthe determination that there are no shelter beds available—\nthen the entire (highly individualized) question of the City’s \nliability to that person under Martin’s standards has been \nshifted into the class definition.  That is wholly improper.  \nSee Olean Wholesale Grocery Coop. v. Bumble Bee Foods, \n31 F.4th 651, 670 n.14 (9th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (“A court \nmay not . . . create a ‘fail safe’ class that is defined to include \nonly those individuals who were injured by the allegedly \nunlawful  conduct.”);  see  also  Ruiz  Torres  v.  Mercer \nCanyons Inc., 835 F.3d 1125, 1138 n.7 (9th Cir. 2016) \n(stating that it would be improper to define a class in such a \nway “as to preclude membership unless the liability of the \ndefendant is established” (simplified)).   \nThe majority nonetheless insists that “[m]embership in \n[the] class” here “has no connection to the success of the \nunderlying claims.”  See Opin. at 39 n.23.  That is obviously \nfalse.  As I have explained, Martin’s understanding of when \na person “involuntarily” lacks “access to adequate temporary \nshelter” or to “a single place where [he or she] can lawfully \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 84 of 155\n84  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nbe,” see 920 F.3d at 617 & n.8 (citations omitted), requires \nan  individualized  inquiry  into  a  given  person’s \ncircumstances at a particular moment.  By insisting that a \ncommon  question  exists  here  because  Martin’s \ninvoluntariness  standard  has  been  folded  into  the  class \ndefinition, the majority is unavoidably relying on a fail-safe \nclass  definition  that  improperly  subsumes  this  crucial \nindividualized merits issue into the class definition.  The \nmajority’s artifice renders the limitations of Rule 23 largely \nillusory.11  \nTo the extent that the majority instead suggests that the \nclass definition requires only an involuntary lack of access \nto regular or permanent shelter to qualify as “involuntarily \nhomeless,” its argument collapses for a different reason.  \nBecause Martin’s Eighth Amendment holding applies only \nto  those  who  involuntarily  lack  “access  to  adequate \ntemporary shelter” on a given occasion, see 920 F.3d at 617 \nn.8, such an understanding of the class definition would not \n \n11  The  majority  contends  that,  despite  the  presence  of  a  liability-\ndetermining individualized issue in the class definition, there is no fail-\nsafe class here because one or more of the claims might still conceivably \nfail on the merits for other reasons.  See Opin. at 39 n.23.  But the \nmajority does not identify any such other reasons and, of course, under \nthe majority’s view of the substantive law, there are none.  But more \nimportantly, the majority is simply wrong in positing that the only type \nof class that would qualify as an impermissible fail-safe class is one in \nwhich every conceivable merits issue in the litigation has been folded \ninto the class definition.  What matters is whether the class definition \nfolds within it any bootstrapping merits issue (such as the “injur[y]” issue \nmentioned in Olean) as to which “a class member either wins or, by \nvirtue of losing, is defined out of the class and is therefore not bound by \nthe judgment.”  Olean, 31 F.4th at 670 n.14 (citation omitted).  To the \nextent that the central individualized merits issue in this case has been \nfolded into the class definition, that defect is present here. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 85 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    85 \nbe sufficient to eliminate the highly individualized inquiry \ninto whether a particular person lacked such access at a given \nmoment, and the class would then have to be decertified for \nthe reasons I have discussed earlier.  See supra at 75–80.  Put \nsimply, the majority cannot have it both ways: either the \nclass  definition  is  co-extensive  with  Martin’s \ninvoluntariness  concept  (in  which  case  the  class  is  an \nimproper fail-safe class) or the class definition differs from \nthe Martin standard (in which case Martin’s individualized \ninquiry requires decertification). \nIV \nGiven  these  conclusions  as  to  standing  and  class \ncertification, all that remains are the individual claims of \nJohnson for prospective relief against enforcement of the \ntwo anti-camping ordinances.  In my view, these claims fail \nas a matter of law. \nJohnson’s sole basis for challenging these ordinances is \nthat they prohibit her from sleeping in her van within the \nCity.  In her declaration in support of class certification, \nhowever, Johnson specifically stated that she has “often” \nbeen able to sleep in her van by parking outside the City \nlimits.  In a supplemental declaration in support of summary \njudgment, she affirmed that these facts “remain true,” but \nshe added that there had also been occasions in which, \noutside the City limits, county officers had told her to “move \non” when she “was parked on county roads” and that, when \nshe  parked  “on  BLM  land”—i.e.,  land  managed  by  the \nfederal Bureau of Land Management—she was told that she \n“could only stay on BLM for a few days.” \nAs an initial matter, Johnson’s declaration provides no \nnon-conclusory basis for finding that she lacks any option \nother than sleeping in her van.  Although her declaration \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 86 of 155\n86  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nnotes that she worked as a nurse “for decades” and that she \nnow collects social security benefits, the declaration simply \nstates, without saying anything further about her present \neconomic situation, that she “cannot afford housing.”  Her \ndeclaration also says nothing about where she lived before \nshe began living “on the street” a few years ago, and it says \nnothing about whether she has any friends or family, in \nGrants Pass or elsewhere, who might be able to provide \nassistance.12  And even assuming that this factual showing \nwould be sufficient to permit a trier of fact to find that \nJohnson lacks any realistic option other than sleeping in her \nvan, we cannot affirm the district court’s summary judgment \nin Johnson’s favor without holding that her showing was so \noverwhelming that she should prevail as a matter of law.  \nBecause a reasonable trier of fact could find, in light of these \nevidentiary gaps, that Johnson failed to carry her burden of \nproof on this preliminary point, summary judgment in her \nfavor was improper.13 \n \n12 The majority dismisses these questions about the sufficiency of \nJohnson’s evidentiary showing as “artificial limitations” on claims under \nMartin, see Opin. at 51, but the standard for establishing an Eighth \nAmendment violation under Martin and the Powell opinions on which it \nrelies is a demanding and individualized one, and we are obligated to \nfollow  it.    Indeed,  in  upholding  Powell’s  conviction  for  public \ndrunkenness, the controlling opinion of Justice White probed the details \nof the record as to whether, in light of the fact that Powell “had a home \nand wife,” he could have “made plans while sober to prevent ending up \nin a public place,” and whether, despite his chronic alcoholism, he \n“retained the power to stay off or leave the streets, and simply preferred \nto be there rather than elsewhere.”  392 U.S. at 553. \n13 The majority errs by instead counting all gaps in the evidentiary record \nagainst the City, faulting it for what the majority thinks the City has \nfailed to “demonstrate[],”  See Opin. at 52 & n.32.  That is contrary to \nwell-settled law.  See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986) \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 87 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    87 \nBut even assuming that Johnson had established that she \ntruly  has  no  option  other  than  sleeping  in  her  van,  her \nshowing  is  still  insufficient  to  establish  an  Eighth \nAmendment violation.  As noted, Johnson’s sole complaint \nin this case is that, by enforcing the anti-camping ordinances, \nthe City will not let her sleep in her van.  But the sparse facts \nshe  has  presented  fail  to  establish  that  she  lacks  any \nalternative place where she could park her van and sleep in \nit.  On the contrary, her factual showing establishes that the \nBLM will let her do so on BLM land for a “few days” at a \ntime and that she also has “often” been able to do so on \ncounty  land.    Given  that  Johnson  has  failed  to  present \nsufficient evidence to show that she lacks alternatives that \nwould allow her to avoid violating the City’s anti-camping \nordinances, she has not established that the conduct for \nwhich the City would punish her is involuntary such that, \nunder Martin and the Powell opinions on which Martin \nrelies, it would violate the Eighth Amendment to enforce that \nprohibition against her.   \nIn nonetheless finding that the anti-camping ordinances’ \nprohibition  on  sleeping  in  vehicles  violates  the  Eighth \nAmendment, the majority apparently relies on the premise \nthat the question of whether an individual has options for \navoiding violations of the challenged law must be limited to \nalternatives that are within the City limits.  Under this view, \nif a large homeless shelter with 1,000 vacant beds were \n \n(holding that a movant’s summary judgment motion should be granted \n“against a [nonmovant] who fails to make a showing sufficient to \nestablish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and \non which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial”).  The \nmajority’s analysis also belies its implausible claim that it has not shifted \nthe burden to the City to establish the voluntariness of the behavior \ntargeted by the ordinances.  See supra at 78 n.9. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 88 of 155\n88  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nopened a block outside the City’s limits, the City would still \nbe required by the Eighth Amendment to allow hundreds of \npeople to sleep in their vans in the City and, presumably, in \nthe City’s public parks as well.  Nothing in law or logic \nsupports such a conclusion.  Martin says that anti-sleeping \nordinances  may  be  enforced,  consistent  with  the  Eighth \nAmendment, so long as there is a “single place where [the \nperson] can lawfully be,” 920 F.2d at 617 (emphasis added) \n(citation  omitted),  and  Justice  White’s  concurrence  in \nPowell confirms that the Eighth Amendment does not bar \nenforcement of a law when the defendant has failed to show \nthat avoiding the violative conduct is “impossible,” 392 U.S. \nat 551 (emphasis added).14  Nothing in the rationale of this \nEighth Amendment theory suggests that the inquiry into \nwhether  it  is  “impossible”  for  the  defendant  to  avoid \nviolating the law must be artificially constrained to only \nthose particular options that suit the defendant’s geographic \nor other preferences.  To be sure, Johnson states that having \nto drive outside the City limits costs her money for gas, but \nthat does not provide any basis for concluding that the option \nis infeasible or that she has thereby suffered “cruel and \nunusual punishment.”   \nFinally,  because  the  district  court’s  reliance  on  the \nExcessive Fines Clause was predicated on the comparable \nview that the challenged ordinances punish “status and not \nconduct” in violation of Robinson, that ruling was flawed for \nthe same reasons.  And because Johnson provides no other \n \n14 The majority complains that this standard is too high, see Opin. at 52, \nbut it is the standard applied in Martin and in the Powell opinions on \nwhich Martin relied.   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 89 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    89 \nbasis for  finding an Excessive  Fines  violation  here, her \nclaims under that clause also fail as a matter of law. \nV \nAccordingly, I would remand this case with instructions \n(1) to dismiss as moot the claims of Debra Blake as well as \nPlaintiffs’ claims with respect to GPMC § 6.46.355; (2) to \ndismiss the claims of John Logan for lack of Article III \nstanding;  (3) to  dismiss  the  remaining  claims  of  Gloria \nJohnson for lack of Article III standing, except to the extent \nthat she challenges the two anti-camping ordinances (GPMC \n§§ 5.61.030, 6.46.090); (4) to decertify the class; and (5) to \ngrant summary judgment to the City, and against Johnson, \nwith respect to her challenges to the City’s anti-camping \nordinances  under  the  Eighth  Amendment’s  Cruel  and \nUnusual Punishments Clause and Excessive Fines Clause.  \nThat disposes of all claims at issue, and I therefore need not \nreach  any  of  the  many  additional  issues  discussed  and \ndecided by the majority’s opinion or raised by the parties.15   \n \n15 Two of the majority’s expansions of Martin nonetheless warrant \nspecial mention.  First, the majority’s decision goes well beyond Martin \nby holding that the Eighth Amendment precludes enforcement of anti-\ncamping ordinances against those who involuntarily lack access to \ntemporary shelter, if those ordinances deny such persons the use of \nwhatever materials they need “to keep themselves warm and dry.”  See \nOpin. at 46.  It seems unavoidable that this newly declared right to the \nnecessary “materials to keep warm and dry” while sleeping in public \nparks must include the right to use (at least) a tent; it is hard to see how \nelse one would keep “warm and dry” in a downpour.  And the majority \nalso raises, and leaves open, the possibility that the City’s prohibition on \nthe use of other “items necessary to facilitate sleeping outdoors”—such \nas “stoves,” “fires,” and makeshift “structures”—“may or may not be \npermissible.”    See  Opin.  at  45–46,  53–54.    Second,  the  majority \nindirectly extends Martin’s holding from the strictly criminal context at \nissue in that case to civil citations and fines.  See Opin. at 41–45.  As the \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 90 of 155\n90  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nVI \nUp to this point, I have faithfully adhered to Martin and \nits understanding of Powell, as I am obligated to do.  See \nMiller v. Gammie, 335 F.3d 889, 899–900 (9th Cir. 2003) \n(en banc).  But given the importance of the issues at stake, \nand the gravity of Martin’s errors, I think it appropriate to \nconclude by noting my general agreement with many of the \npoints  made  by  my  colleagues  who  dissented  from  our \nfailure to rehear Martin en banc.   \nIn  particular,  I  agree  that,  by  combining  dicta  in  a \nconcurring  opinion  with  a  dissent,  the  panel  in  Martin \nplainly misapplied Marks’ rule that “[w]hen a fragmented \nCourt decides a case and no single rationale explaining the \nresult enjoys the assent of five Justices, ‘the holding of the \nCourt  may  be  viewed  as  that  position  taken  by  those \nMembers who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest \ngrounds.’”    430  U.S.  at  193  (emphasis  added)  (citation \nomitted).  Under a correct application of Marks, the holding \nof  Powell  is  that  there  is  no  constitutional  obstacle  to \npunishing conduct that has not been shown to be involuntary, \nand the converse question of what rule applies when the \n \ndistrict court noted below, the parties vigorously debated the extent to \nwhich a “violation” qualifies as a crime under Oregon law.  The majority, \nhowever, sidesteps that issue by instead treating it as irrelevant.  The \nmajority’s theory is that, even assuming arguendo that violations of the \nanti-camping ordinances are only civil in nature, they are covered by \nMartin because such violations later could lead (after more conduct by \nthe defendant) to criminal fines, see Opin. at 44–45.  But the majority \ndoes not follow the logic of its own theory, because it has not limited its \nholding  or  remedy  to  the  enforcement  of  the  ultimate  criminal \nprovisions; on the contrary, the majority has enjoined any relevant \nenforcement  of  the  underlying  ordinances  that  contravenes  the \nmajority’s understanding of Martin.  See Opin. at 55.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 91 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    91 \nconduct has been shown to be involuntary was left open.  See \nMartin, 920 F.3d at 590–93 (M. Smith, J., dissenting from \ndenial of rehearing en banc) (explaining that, under a proper \napplication of Marks, “‘there is definitely no Supreme Court \nholding’  prohibiting  the  criminalization  of  involuntary \nconduct” (citation omitted)).   \nMoreover, the correct answer to the question left open in \nPowell was the one provided in Justice Marshall’s plurality \nopinion  in  that  case:  there  is  no  federal  “constitutional \ndoctrine of criminal responsibility.”  392 U.S. at 534.  In \nlight of the “centuries-long evolution of the collection of \ninterlocking and overlapping concepts which the common \nlaw has utilized to assess the moral accountability of an \nindividual for his antisocial deeds,” including the “doctrines \nof actus reus, mens rea, insanity, mistake, justification, and \nduress,” the “process of adjustment” of “the tension between \nthe evolving aims of the criminal law and changing religious, \nmoral, philosophical, and medical views of the nature of \nman” is a matter that the Constitution leaves within “the \nprovince of the States” or of Congress.  Id. at 535–36.  \n“There is simply no indication in the history of the Eighth \nAmendment that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause \nwas intended to reach the substantive authority of Congress \nto  criminalize  acts  or  status,  and  certainly  not  before \nconviction,”  and  the  later  incorporation  of  that  clause’s \nprotections  vis-à-vis  the  States  in  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment “worked no change in its meaning.”  Martin, \n920  F.3d  at  602  (Bennett,  J.,  dissenting  from  denial  of \nrehearing en banc);  see also id. at 599 (explaining that \nMartin’s  novel  holding  was  inconsistent  with  the  “text, \ntradition, and original public meaning[] [of] the Cruel and \nUnusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment”).  \nConsequently, so long as “the accused has committed some \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 92 of 155\n92  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nact, has engaged in some behavior, which society has an \ninterest in preventing, or perhaps in historical common law \nterms,  has  committed  some  actus  reus,”  the  Eighth \nAmendment  principles  applied  in  Robinson  have  been \nsatisfied.  Powell, 392 U.S. at 533 (plurality).  The Eighth \nAmendment does not preclude punishing such an act merely \n“because it is, in some sense, ‘involuntary’ or ‘occasioned \nby a compulsion.’”  Id.; see also Martin, 920 F.3d at 592 n.3 \n(M. Smith, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) \n(“Powell does not prohibit the criminalization of involuntary \nconduct.”).   \nFurther, it is hard to deny that Martin has “generate[d] \ndire  practical  consequences  for  the  hundreds  of  local \ngovernments within our jurisdiction, and for the millions of \npeople  that  reside  therein.”    Id.  at  594  (M.  Smith,  J., \ndissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  Those harms, \nof  course,  will  be  greatly  magnified  by  the  egregiously \nflawed  reconceptualization  and  extension  of  Martin’s \nholding in today’s decision, and by the majority’s equally \ntroubling reworking of settled class-action principles.  With \nno sense of irony, the majority declares that no such harms \nare demonstrated by the record in this case, even as the \nmajority largely endorses an injunction effectively requiring \nGrants Pass to allow the use of its public parks as homeless \nencampments.  Other cities in this circuit can be expected to \nsuffer a similar fate. \nIn view of all of the foregoing, both Martin and today’s \ndecision should be overturned or overruled at the earliest \nopportunity, either by this court sitting en banc or by the U.S. \nSupreme Court. \n*          *          * \nI respectfully but emphatically dissent. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 93 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    93 \nSilver,  District  Judge,  and  Gould,  Circuit  Judge,  joint \nstatement regarding denial of rehearing: \n \nThe differences of opinion in this case are hard and there \nis basis for good-faith disagreements which are reflected in \nthe filings from a variety of judges.  The robust defense of \nthe panel majority opinion we offer here should not be read \nas any comment on the sincerity of our colleagues’ quarrels \nwith our position.     \nThe statement regarding the denial of rehearing from \nJudge O’Scannlain and the dissent from Judge M. Smith \nsignificantly exaggerate the holding in Johnson v. Grants \nPass, 50 F.4th 787 (9th Cir. 2022).  Grants Pass, relying on \nMartin v. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584 (9th Cir. 2019), holds \nonly that governments cannot criminalize the act of sleeping \nwith the use of rudimentary protections, such as bedding, \nfrom the elements in some public places when a person has \nnowhere else to sleep.  It does not establish an unrestrained \nright for involuntarily homeless persons to sleep anywhere \nthey choose.  Nor does it require jurisdictions to cede all \npublic spaces to involuntarily homeless persons.  The argued \nnotion  that  Martin  and  Grants  Pass  work  together  to \nguarantee a “federal constitutional ‘right’ . . . to camp or to \nsleep on sidewalks and in parks, playgrounds, and other \npublic places” is completely absent from the opinion.  The \ndenial of en banc rehearing should not be criticized based on \nrhetorical exaggerations. \nBeyond misdescribing the holding of Grants Pass, Judge \nO’Scannlain extrapolates and proposes that the Ninth Circuit \nignore 65 years of Supreme Court precedent in favor of his \npreferred  approach  of  looking  exclusively  to  what  he \ndeclares is the “text, history, and tradition” of the Eighth \nAmendment.  But inferior courts are not free to embark on \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 94 of 155\n94  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nsuch freewheeling adventures when the Supreme Court has \nprovided the applicable guidance.  Judge M. Smith does not \njoin the portion of Judge O’Scannlain’s statement discussing \nthis point, but Judge M. Smith engages in a puzzling error \nby attributing in part the homelessness problem throughout \nthe Ninth Circuit to Martin and now Grants Pass.  The \nhomelessness problem predates Martin, and cities outside \nthe  Ninth  Circuit,  and  outside  the  United  States,  are \nexperiencing crisis-levels of homelessness.  It is implausible \nto argue the crisis would abate if jurisdictions in the Ninth \nCircuit  regained  the  authority  to  punish  involuntarily \nhomeless persons for sleeping in public with blankets.   \nI.  Limited Holding of Grants Pass  \nJudge O’Scannlain and Judge M. Smith aim most of their \nfire  at  the  portion  of  Grants  Pass  addressing  the  two \noverlapping “anti-camping” ordinances.  Grants Pass holds \nthe anti-camping ordinances enacted by the City of Grants \nPass violate the Eighth Amendment but only to the extent \nthey  criminalize  sleeping  with  rudimentary  forms  of \nprotection from the elements (i.e., bedding or sleeping bags) \nby those persons without access to any other shelter (i.e., \npersons who are “involuntarily homeless”).  Grants Pass \ndoes not expressly preface every reference to “homeless \npersons” with the adjective “involuntarily.”  However, in \nclear reliance on Martin, the opinion is strictly limited to \nenforcement  of  the  ordinances  against  “involuntarily” \nhomeless persons.  Like Martin, Grants Pass holds only that \n“it  is  ‘unconstitutional  to  [punish]  simply  sleeping \nsomewhere in public if one has nowhere else to do so.’”  Id. \n(quoting Martin, 920 F.3d at 590 (Berzon, J., concurring in \ndenial of rehearing en banc)).   \nThe holding in Grants Pass is not that involuntarily \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 95 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    95 \nhomeless persons in the City of Grants Pass and elsewhere \nin  the  Ninth  Circuit  are  allowed  to  sleep  wherever  and \nwhenever  they  wish.    When  there  is  space  available  in \nshelters, jurisdictions are free to enforce prohibitions on \nsleeping anywhere in public.  And emphatically, when an \ninvoluntarily homeless person refuses a specific offer of \nshelter  elsewhere,  that  individual  may  be  punished  for \nsleeping  in  public.    When  there  is  no  shelter  space, \njurisdictions may still enforce limitations on sleeping at \ncertain locations.  The assertion that jurisdictions must now \nallow involuntarily homeless persons to camp or sleep on \nevery sidewalk and in every playground is plainly wrong. \nJurisdictions  remain  free  to  address  the  complex  policy \nissues regarding homelessness in the way those jurisdictions \ndeem fit, subject to the single restriction that involuntarily \nhomeless persons must have “somewhere” to sleep and take \nrudimentary precautions (bedding) against the elements.  Id. \n(quoting Martin, 920 F.3d at 590 (Berzon, J., concurring in \ndenial of rehearing en banc)).   \nJudge  M.  Smith  misinterpreted  a  statement  in  the \noriginal majority opinion that he believed mandated “a crude \njurisdiction-wide  inquiry”  dictating  a  local  “government \ncannot prosecute homeless people for sleeping in public if \nthere  is  a  greater  number  of  homeless  individuals  in  a \njurisdiction than the number of available shelter spaces.”  \nJudge M. Smith’s understanding of the original statement \nwas incorrect.  To avoid any possibility of confusion, the \nmajority has now removed the statement Judge M. Smith \nfound confounding.  But Judge M. Smith is still not satisfied.  \nHe complains the change did not result in any “downstream \nchanges” to the majority’s analysis.  But Judge M. Smith \nfails to acknowledge the undisputed facts established that in \nthe  City  of  Grants  Pass,  there  were  zero  shelter  beds \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 96 of 155\n96  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \navailable on almost every night of the year.  Given that, there \nwas no need to change the remaining analysis.     \nAs clearly explained in the majority opinion, the only \nsecular shelter beds in the City of Grants Pass (other than \nbeds for intoxicated adults) were located at a “warming \ncenter”  that  operated  on  especially  cold  nights.    The \nwarming center could hold 40 individuals and was open 16 \nnights during the winter of 2020 and zero nights during the \nwinter of 2021.  Thus, on 95% of the nights in 2020 and \n100% of the nights in 2021, the City of Grants Pass had zero \nsecular shelter beds for non-intoxicated adults.  Given that \nreality, there was no need to make “downstream changes” to \nthe analysis based on the availability of shelter beds in the \nCity of Grants Pass.  When a jurisdiction has zero shelter \nbeds  even  theoretically  available,  it  does  not  require \nsignificant analysis to conclude the jurisdiction is barred \nfrom prosecuting the involuntarily homeless persons in that \njurisdiction.   \nJudge M. Smith’s refusal to acknowledge the lack of \nshelter space in the City of Grants Pass reveals his actual \ncomplaint in this area is the perceived failure to strictly \npolice  who  will  qualify  as  involuntarily  homeless.   \nAccording to Judge M. Smith, it was inappropriate to find \nthat  zero  shelter  beds,  combined  with  “conclusory \nallegations of involuntariness,” were enough to conclude \nthere  were  involuntarily  homeless  persons  in  the \njurisdiction.  The “conclusory allegations” Judge M. Smith \nfaults are expressly found in a declaration submitted by \nGloria Johnson where she stated, in relevant part, “I have no \nchoice but to live outside and have no place else to go,” and \n“I continue to live without shelter in Grants Pass.”  It bears \nrepeating this case was resolved on summary judgment.  The \nCity of Grants Pass did not present any evidence to the \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 97 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    97 \ndistrict  court,  nor  did  it  argue  on  appeal,  that  Gloria \nJohnson’s  declaration  was  inaccurate.    In  fact,  it  is \nundisputed there are at least fifty involuntarily homeless \npersons in the City of Grants Pass, as stated in the testimony \nof  a  City  of  Grants  Pass  police  officer.    Describing \nunequivocal  and  undisputed  statements  submitted  at  the \nsummary judgment stage as mere “conclusory allegations” \nis incorrect.   \nJudge M. Smith worries the amended opinion might still \nprohibit any enforcement actions against individuals with \naccess to shelter.  But the opinion repeatedly notes it only \naddresses  enforcement  attempts  against  “involuntarily \nhomeless persons.”  Grants Pass goes to great lengths to \nmake this clear.  Grants Pass states individuals qualify as \n“involuntarily homeless” only if they “do not have access to \nadequate temporary shelter, whether because they have the \nmeans to pay for it or because it is realistically available to \nthem for free.”  Id. at 793 n.2 (internal quotation marks and \ncitation  omitted).    To  remove  any  doubt,  Grants  Pass \nstresses “[i]ndividuals who have shelter or the means to \nacquire their own shelter simply are never class members,” \nmeaning such individuals are not “involuntarily homeless.”  \nId. at 805.  And to further illuminate the point, Grants Pass \nstates “To be clear: A person with access to temporary \nshelter is not involuntarily homeless unless and until they no \nlonger have access to shelter.”  Id. at 805 n.24.  Judge M. \nSmith’s  assertion  that  Grants  Pass  might  prohibit \nenforcement  against  persons  “no  matter  their  personal \nsituations” is wrong. \nWhen an individual has access to a shelter, such as \nthrough a “city’s offer of temporary housing,” that person is \nnot “involuntarily homeless” and anti-camping ordinances \nmay  be  enforced  against  that  person.    Similarly,  if  a \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 98 of 155\n98  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \njurisdiction  always  has  shelter  beds  or  other  locations \navailable, that jurisdiction is free to enforce its anti-camping \nordinances on all other public areas.   \nJudge M. Smith also claims that after Grants Pass local \nauthorities are  “powerless to cite” individuals “even  for \npublic  defecation.”1    Neither  Martin  nor  Grants  Pass \ninvolved particular ordinances precluding public urination \nand defecation and the assertion that Martin and Grants Pass \nresolved  the  constitutionality  of  ordinances  addressing \npublic urination and defecation is mistaken.2   \n \n1 Judge M. Smith’s sole support for this interpretation is an unpublished \ndecision by the Eastern District of California.  Mahoney v. City of \nSacramento, No. 2:20-cv-00258-KJM, 2020 WL 616302 (E.D. Cal. Feb. \n10, 2020).  That case involved the removal of portable toilets from public \nproperty that had been placed there by private citizens for homeless \nindividuals to use.  The plaintiffs alleged many different constitutional \nclaims, including that the removal of the toilets would violate their \nEighth Amendment rights.  On that point, the City of Sacramento stated \n“neither the benefactors of the toilets nor the users of the toilets have, or \nwill be, criminally prosecuted.”  In denying a request for a temporary \nrestraining order, the court stated “Extending Martin to these facts, the \nCity may not prosecute or otherwise penalize the plaintiffs . . . for \neliminating in public if there is no alternative to doing so.”  Id.  The court \ncontinued, arguably based on the city’s representations regarding non-\nprosecution, that “no irreparable injury to plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment \nrights is likely.”  Id.  Because the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their \nclaim nine days after the court’s order, the court did not provide a more \ncomplete  Eighth  Amendment  analysis  based  on  Martin.    A  brief \nstatement made in the context of resolving an emergency motion is not \na solid foundation for Judge M. Smith’s assertion that after Grants Pass \nlocal authorities are now “powerless to cite” individuals for public \ndefecation.   \n2 The focus of Martin and Grants Pass was sleep.  Sleep is not a \nvoluntary act but an “identifiable human need[].”  Rico v.

And Judge O’Scannlain noted almost twenty years \nago, “[i]n our system of government, courts base decisions \nnot on dramatic Hollywood fantasies . . . but on concretely \nparticularized  facts  developed  in  the  cauldron  of  the \nadversary process and reduced to an assessable record.”  \nUnited States v. Kincade, 379 F.3d 813, 838 (9th Cir. 2004) \n(en banc).  Because there was no challenge to any public \nurination  or  defecation  ordinances  in  Grants  Pass,  the \nparties did not develop a record regarding those issues such \nthat neither the district court nor Ninth Circuit had a basis to \naddress them.  Judge M. Smith’s assertion that Grants Pass \nprohibits citations “even for public defecation” is wrong.  \nII. Class Certification was Proper \nConnected to the purported “jurisdiction-wide analysis,” \nJudge M. Smith argues, as did the dissent by Judge Collins, \nthat Grants Pass erred in affirming certification of the class.  \n \nWalker v. Schult, 717 F.3d 119, 126 (2d Cir. 2013).  See also Wilkins \nKaplan & Sadock’s Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, 10th Ed. \nCH23 (“Sleep is a process required for proper brain function.  Failure to \nsleep impairs thought processes, mood regulation, and a host of normal \nphysiological functions.”).  The lack of sleep may play a role in the \ndevelopment of dementia.  See Nedergaard and Goldman, Glymphatic \nfailure  as  a  final  common  pathway  to  dementia,  available  at \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8186542/.  And long-\nterm sleep deprivation has been shown to be lethal in some animals.

CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nAccording  to  Judge  M.  Smith,  the  opinion  “wholly \ncollaps[es]  the  merits  into  the  class  definition”  which \nresulted in an “impermissible fail safe class.”  The Grants \nPass opinion explains why that conclusion is wrong.  50 \nF.4th at 805 n.23.  In brief, the population of the class of \n“involuntarily homeless” individuals does not change based \non whether the class wins or loses.  There has never been a \npossibility that a “class member either wins or, by virtue of \nlosing,  is  defined  out  of  the  class.”    Olean  Wholesale \nGrocery Coop., Inc. v. Bumble Bee Foods LLC, 31 F.4th \n651, 669 n.14 (9th Cir. 2022) (quotation marks and citation \nomitted). \nJudge M. Smith, as did Judge Collins, also believes the \nclass  should  not  have  been  certified  due  to  a  “lack  of \ncommonality.”    Judge  M.  Smith’s  view  is  that \n“commonality”  was  lacking  because  determining  class \nmembership requires an individualized assessment of each \npotential  class  member’s  access  to  shelter.    This  is  an \nincorrect understanding of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23’s “commonality” requirement.   \nTo satisfy Rule 23’s “commonality” requirement there \nmust be a “common contention” such “that determination of \nits truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the \nvalidity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  Wal-Mart \nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011).  In Grants \nPass, the “common contention” was the assertion that the \nCity’s  anti-camping  ordinances  violated  the  Eighth \nAmendment as applied to the class.  That contention could \nbe resolved in “one stroke,” meaning the “commonality” \nrequirement was met.  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350. \nWhile  not  entirely  clear,  Judge  M.  Smith  might  be \narguing “commonality” does not exist when a court is unable \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 101 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    101 \nto immediately and easily identify each and every class \nmember.  But there has never been such a requirement.  See \nIn re Google Inc. St. View Elec. Commc’ns Litig., 21 F.4th \n1102,  1115  (9th  Cir.  2021)  (affirming  class  settlement \ndespite it being “not feasible” to identify class members).  \nAlternatively,  Judge  M.  Smith  might  be  arguing \n“commonality” does not exist when some effort will be \nrequired to identify class members.  But it is entirely routine \nfor class actions to require individualized determinations to \nidentify class members.   \nFor example, a recent Ninth Circuit opinion involved a \nclass  defined  as  “All  individuals  who  have  worked  as \nCalifornia-based flight attendants of Virgin America, Inc. \nwhile residing in California at any time during the Class \nPeriod.”  Bernstein v. Virgin Am., Inc., 3 F.4th 1127, 1134 \n(9th  Cir.  2021).    Identifying  members  of  that  class \nnecessarily  required  individualized  determinations  to \nidentify  whether  an  individual  had  worked  as  a  flight \nattendant for Virgin America and where the individual had \nlived throughout the multi-year class period.   Judge M. \nSmith’s view that “commonality” is not present whenever \nclass members can only be identified after an individualized \ninquiry would preclude certification of most classes.  \nIII. Eighth Amendment Doctrine \nJudge  O’Scannlain  laments  “Grants  Pass  never \nmeaningfully engaged the text, history, and tradition of the \nConstitution.”  For the most part, that criticism is misplaced \nas the Grants Pass majority was bound to follow Martin.  \nMore importantly, however, the present record does not \ncontain  sufficient  facts  to  conduct  the  analysis  Judge \nO’Scannlain wishes to perform, presumably because the \nparties were aware Judge O’Scannlain’s preferred method of \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 102 of 155\n102  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nanalysis is foreclosed by long established precedent.   \nThe  historical  inquiry  regarding  the  meaning  of \nconstitutional terms may require looking as far back as the \n13th Century.  See Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., \n142 S. Ct. 2228, 2249 (2022) (discussing cases from 13th \ncentury).  The parties in Grants Pass did not gather and \npresent evidence regarding centuries of history to illuminate \nthe complete “text, history, and tradition” of the Eighth \nAmendment.  If, as Judge O’Scannlain believes, courts must \nassess the Eighth Amendment exclusively under a “text, \nhistory, and tradition” approach, the parties must be given \nthe opportunity to present relevant historical evidence. See \nUnited States v. Sineneng-Smith, 140 S. Ct. 1575, 1579 \n(2020)  (noting  courts  should  follow  “party  presentation \nprinciple”).  That may require the parties retain experts.  See, \ne.g., Miller v. Smith, No. 22-1482, 2023 WL 334788, at *1 \n(7th Cir. Jan. 20, 2023) (remanding for district court to \nsolicit additional expert reports regarding “text, history, and \ntradition framework” in Second Amendment case).   \nNotably, Judge O’Scannlain is not arguing Grants Pass \nshould be remanded for a proper inquiry under his proposed \n“text, history, and tradition” test.  Rather, he professes he has \nconducted the relevant inquiry on his own and definitively \nestablished the correct interpretation of centuries of history.  \nOur adversarial system takes a dim view of appellate courts \nembarking  on  their  own  fact-finding  missions.    Alpha \nDistrib. Co. of California v. Jack Daniel Distillery, 454 F.2d \n442, 453 (9th Cir. 1972) (“The appellate court is not the trier \nof facts and does not ordinarily make findings of fact.”).  \nAnd that is especially true when the inquiry has not been \nbriefed by the parties.  Sineneng-Smith, 140 S. Ct. at 1579 \n(2020).  Ultimately, however, Judge O’Scannlain’s favored \nconstitutional analysis is beside the point.  The Supreme \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 103 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    103 \nCourt has made clear “text, history, and tradition” is not the \ncorrect method when assessing Eighth Amendment claims.   \nAccording  to  the  Supreme  Court,  the  proper \ninterpretation  of  the  Eighth  Amendment  does  not  turn \nexclusively on standards from hundreds of years ago.  In a \nplurality opinion in 1958, the Supreme Court explained the \nEighth  Amendment  “must  draw  its  meaning  from  the \nevolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a \nmaturing society.”  Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101 (1958) \n(plurality opinion).  More recently, the Supreme Court stated \na proper Eighth Amendment analysis “is determined not by \nthe standards that prevailed when the Eighth Amendment \nwas  adopted  in  1791  but  by  the  norms  that  ‘currently \nprevail.’”  Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.S. 407, 419 (2008) \n(citation omitted).  And “courts must look beyond historical \nconceptions”  when  assessing  Eighth  Amendment \nchallenges.  Graham v. Florida., 560 U.S. 48, 58 (2010).   \nGiven this guidance, lamenting Grants Pass did not \ndelve  into  the  Eighth  Amendment’s  “text,  history,  and \ntradition” is a complaint that the majority in Grants Pass \nfollowed the Supreme Court’s settled guidance.  Contrary to \nJudge O’Scannlain, the majority in Grants Pass was not free \nto ignore the Supreme Court, embark on its own fact-finding \nmission,  and  conclude  the  correct  interpretation  of  the \nEighth  Amendment  is  the  one  Judge  O’Scannlain  likes.  \nInstead, the majority chose the more modest approach of \napplying existing Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit authority \nto the record presented by the parties.3   \n \n3 Judge Graber agrees with the “underlying legal premise” that the Eighth \nAmendment prohibits criminal prosecution of involuntarily homeless \npersons.  But she believes Grants Pass “unjustifiably expands the reach \nof the Eighth Amendment” by prohibiting “civil remedies that could, in \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 104 of 155\n104  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nIV. Application of Marks Doctrine \nBoth Judge O’Scannlain and Judge M. Smith take issue \nwith  the  Marks  v.  United  States,  430  U.S.  188  (1977), \nanalysis in Martin and Grants Pass.  According to them, the \nproper application of the Marks doctrine is obvious and \nshould have prevented the result in Martin and Grants Pass.  \nIt is not clear if the Marks analyses conducted by Judge \nO’Scannlain  and  Judge  M.  Smith  reach  the  same \nconclusion.4    Moreover,  neither  Judge  O’Scannlain  nor \nJudge M. Smith cite the en banc majority opinion from the \nFourth  Circuit  that  conducts  the  Marks  analysis  on  the \nrelevant Supreme Court authorities and reaches the “same \nconclusion” as that reached in Martin.  Manning v. Caldwell \nfor City of Roanoke, 930 F.3d 264, 283 n.17 (4th Cir. 2019) \n(en banc).  Thus, Judge O’Scannlain and Judge M. Smith \nshow overconfidence that their application of the Marks \ndoctrine is correct.  In the end, however, an exhaustive \n \ntheory, lead to [criminal] prosecution.”  But all parties in Grants Pass \nagreed the civil violations were used as the first step in the eventual \npursuit of criminal charges.  This is not a case where the jurisdiction has \ndisavowed pursuing criminal charges.   \n4 Judge O’Scannlain describes Justice White’s concurrence in Powell v. \nTexas, 392 U.S. 514 (1968), as “the dispositive fifth vote.”  But Judge \nO’Scannlain also relies heavily, without explanation, on statements \nmade by the non-binding plurality in Powell.  As for Judge M. Smith, he \nargues Powell produced “no single rationale and only its specific result \nis binding.”  But Judge M. Smith then faults the Martin and Grants Pass \nmajorities  for  not  addressing  arguments  made  by  the  non-binding \nplurality in Powell.  Judge M. Smith seems to believe proper application \nof the Marks doctrine means only the result in Powell is binding, but \nlower courts have an affirmative obligation to address points made by \nthe Powell plurality.  Judge M. Smith does not cite any authority for his \nidiosyncratic view of how the Marks doctrine operates.    \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 105 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    105 \nMarks analysis is not necessary. \nEveryone agrees Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660 \n(1962) is the binding Supreme Court precedent.  It is vital \nthat every justice in Powell v. State of Texas, 392 U.S. 514 \n(1968), fully embraced the holding in Robinson that a status \ncannot be prosecuted.  In Robinson, the Supreme Court \nconcluded it violated the Eighth Amendment for California \nto criminalize the status of being “addicted to the use of \nnarcotics.”  In doing so, the Supreme Court also noted it \nwould violate the Eighth Amendment for a state to make it a \ncriminal offense to be “mentally ill, or a leper, or to be \nafflicted with a venereal disease.”  Robinson, 370 U.S. at \n666.  And “[e]ven one day in prison would be a cruel and \nunusual punishment for the ‘crime’ of having a common \ncold.”  Id. at 667.  Judge O’Scannlain and Judge M. Smith \ninterpret Robinson as establishing a conclusive line between \nconstitutionally barred “status crimes” and constitutionally \npermitted  “conduct  crimes.”    But  such  a  definitive  line \nrequires Robinson be read rigidly, such that a jurisdiction \ncould avoid Robinson by tying “statuses” to inescapable \nhuman activities. \nFor example, under a strict “status-conduct” distinction, \nthe California statute at issue in Robinson could have been \ncured by tying the addiction status to sleeping.  Under such \nlogic, it would have been constitutional for California to \nmake it a criminal offense for a person “addicted to the use \nof narcotics” to fall asleep.  Id. at 660.  Similarly, it now \nwould  be  constitutional  for  a  jurisdiction  to  criminalize \nfalling asleep while being “mentally ill, or a leper, or [] \nafflicted with a venereal disease.”  Id. at 666.  Reading \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 106 of 155\n106  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nRobinson as allowing such simple evasion is absurd.5   \nRegardless of the Marks analysis, Robinson limits the \nreach of criminal law.  Or, as the Supreme Court declared \nfifteen  years  after  Robinson,  the  Eighth  Amendment \n“imposes substantive limits on what can be made criminal \nand punished as such.”  Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, \n667  (1977).    Martin  and  Grants  Pass  recognize  those \nsubstantive limits reach the exceptionally narrow situation \nof  prohibiting  punishment  when  involuntarily  homeless \npersons  engage  in  the  life-sustaining  act  of  sleeping  in \npublic.  Criminalizing the act of sleeping in public when an \nindividual  has  nowhere  else  to  sleep  is,  in  effect, \ncriminalizing the underlying status of being homeless. \nV.  Non-Existent Circuit Split  \nJudge O’Scannlain greatly overstates the extent to which \nMartin and Grants Pass fall on one side of an existing circuit \nsplit.  According to Judge O’Scannlain, no “federal circuit \nor state supreme court . . . has ever embraced Grants Pass’s \nsweeping holding” regarding the Eighth Amendment.  Judge \nO’Scannlain then cites opinions from the Eleventh and Fifth \nCircuits,  but  neither  of  those  opinions  hold  what  Judge \nO’Scannlain claims.  In fact, no circuit court has reached the \nmerits  of  a  challenge  to  public  camping  or  sleeping \n \n5 Even the dissent in the Fourth Circuit opinion Judge O’Scannlain cites \nwith approval understood the logic of Robinson points away from a rigid \ninterpretation.  Manning v. Caldwell for City of Roanoke, 930 F.3d 264, \n290 (4th Cir. 2019) (Wilkinson, J., dissenting).  That dissent noted “[i]n \nthe rare case where the Eighth Amendment was found to invalidate a \ncriminal law, the law in question sought to punish persons merely for \ntheir need to eat or sleep, which are essential bodily functions.  This is \nsimply a variation of Robinson’s command that the state identify conduct \nin crafting its laws, rather than punish a person’s mere existence.”  Id.  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 107 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    107 \nrestrictions  when  no  shelter  space  was  available  and \nconcluded such restrictions were lawful.  Judge O’Scannlain \nalso points to a state supreme court opinion but that opinion \nexplicitly does not decide the question presented in Martin \nand Grants Pass. \nFirst, in Joel v. City of Orlando, 232 F.3d 1353 (11th Cir. \n2000), the Eleventh Circuit addressed a challenge to an anti-\ncamping ordinance.  The entire Eighth Amendment analysis \nin that case was premised on the fact the City of Orlando \n“presented unrefuted evidence that . . . a large homeless \nshelter . . . never reached its maximum capacity and that no \nindividual has been turned away because there was no space \navailable or for failure to pay the one dollar nightly fee.”  Id. \nat 1362.  Thus, the Eleventh Circuit concluded the anti-\nsleeping  ordinance  did  “not  criminalize  involuntary \nbehavior” because the plaintiff could “comply with the [anti-\nsleeping] ordinance” by sleeping in the shelter.  Id.  There is \nno suggestion the result would have been the same if there \nwere no shelter space available.   \nJudge  O’Scannlain  claims  the  availability  of  shelter \nspace  is  not  a  “compelling  response”  in  terms  of \ndistinguishing the result in Joel from that in Martin and \nGrants Pass.  But the central holding in Martin and Grants \nPass  is  that  the  Eighth  Amendment  analysis  turns  on \nwhether there are shelter beds or other locations where an \ninvoluntarily homeless person can lawfully sleep.  It would \nbe hard to imagine a more “compelling” way to distinguish \nJoel  than  pointing  out  Joel  did  not  involve  involuntary \nconduct because shelter space was always available.   \nJudge O’Scannlain also cites Johnson v. City of Dallas, \nTex., 61 F.3d 442 (5th Cir. 1995), where the Fifth Circuit \nconcluded the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge an anti-\n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 108 of 155\n108  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nsleeping ordinance because they had not been prosecuted.  \nThe district court had conducted an extensive overview of \nthe Supreme Court cases and concluded the challenged anti-\nsleeping ordinance impermissibly “punishe[d] the homeless \nfor their status as homeless.”  Johnson v. City of Dallas, 860 \nF. Supp. 344, 350 (N.D. Tex. 1994).  Instead of rejecting or \neven addressing such reasoning, the Fifth Circuit concluded \nno individual had standing to seek pre-enforcement review \nof  a  criminal  statute.    It  is  not  clear  whether  Judge \nO’Scannlain agrees with this standing analysis and there is \nsignificant reason to doubt it is correct.  See, e.g., Holder v. \nHumanitarian L. Project, 561 U.S. 1, 15 (2010) (allowing \n“preenforcement review of a criminal statute”).  But at the \nvery least, it is misleading to describe the Fifth Circuit’s \nrejection based on standing as establishing any position on \nthe merits of the Eighth Amendment issue.6   \n \n6 Judge O’Scannlain also professes to find conflicting decisions from the \nFirst and Seventh Circuits.  In the First Circuit case, the defendant argued \n“because his drug addiction is a disease, sentencing him to a term of \nimprisonment for manifesting a condition of his disease constitutes cruel \nand unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.”  United \nStates v. Sirois, 898 F.3d 134, 135 (1st Cir. 2018).  The First Circuit \nrejected this argument, primarily because the standard of review was \n“clear error” based on the defendant’s failure to raise the argument in the \ndistrict court.  Thus, the First Circuit held only that existing caselaw did \nnot make it “clear or obvious” that “the Eighth Amendment proscribes \ncriminal punishment for conduct that results from narcotic addiction.”  \nId. at 138.  Concluding existing caselaw did not make the issue “clear or \nobvious” is not the same as reaching the merits of the issue. As for the \nSeventh Circuit opinion, it is unpublished and is based on an obvious \nerror.  The opinion discusses a defendant who, allegedly due to his \nalcoholism, “failed to attend treatment programs, used cocaine, and \nabused  alcohol  so  excessively  that  it  led  to  his  arrest  for  public \nintoxication.”  United States v. Stenson, 475 Fed. App’x 630, 631 (7th \nCir. 2012).  The Seventh Circuit concluded the defendant could be \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 109 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    109 \nJudge O’Scannlain also cites Tobe v. City of Santa Ana, \n892 P.2d 1145 (1995) from the California Supreme Court.  \nThat case involved a facial challenge to an anti-camping \nordinance.  Id. at 1154.  The California Supreme Court \nexplicitly noted, however, it was not resolving whether an \n“involuntarily homeless person who involuntarily camps on \npublic property may be convicted or punished under the \nordinance.”  Id. at 1166 n.19.  Claiming Tobe is contrary to \nGrants Pass requires ignoring the language of Tobe. \nFinally,  Judge  O’Scannlain  does  not  disclose  that \nreaching his preferred result would create a circuit split with \nthe Fourth Circuit.  In Manning v. Caldwell for City of \nRoanoke, 930 F.3d 264, 268 (4th Cir. 2019) (en banc), the \nen  banc  Fourth  Circuit  addressed  Virginia’s  statutory \nscheme  that  made  it  a  criminal  offense  for  individuals \nidentified as “habitual drunkards” to possess or attempt to \npossess alcohol.  The Fourth Circuit concluded this scheme \nmight violate the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual \nPunishments clause because it targeted “conduct that is both \ncompelled by [the plaintiffs’] illness and is otherwise lawful \nfor all those of legal drinking age.”  Id. at 281.  In reaching \nthat conclusion, the Fourth Circuit unequivocally adopted \nthe same view of the Supreme Court cases regarding status \ncrimes as that adopted in Martin.  930 F.3d at 282 n.17.   \nJudge O’Scannlain acknowledges that Manning holds \n“involuntary conduct may be exempt” from prosecution.  \n \npunished for those acts because he was not being “punished for his status \nas an alcoholic but for his conduct.”  Id.  However, as noted by the Fourth \nCircuit, the Seventh Circuit “erroneously treated the plurality opinion in \nPowell as the holding of the Court.”  Manning v. Caldwell for City of \nRoanoke, 930 F.3d 264, 283 n.17 (4th Cir. 2019).  Therefore, Stenson is \nof little value. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 110 of 155\n110  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nBut he argues Manning “limited its holding to laws that \nsingled individuals out for special punishment for otherwise \nlawful conduct that is compelled by their illness.”  Judge \nO’Scannlain apparently believes the ordinances addressed in \nGrants Pass do not “single out” individuals in a similar \nmanner.    Judge  O’Scannlain  is  wrong.    The  ordinances \naddressed in Grants Pass target the involuntarily homeless \nthe same way the scheme in Manning targeted alcoholics. \nUnder the ordinances addressed in Grants Pass, it would \nbe lawful for an individual with access to shelter to wrap \nhimself in a blanket in a public park because the individual \nwas not using the blanket “for the purpose of maintaining a \ntemporary place to live.”  50 F.4th at 793.  However, the \nsame  conduct  could  lead  to  criminal  prosecution  of  an \ninvoluntarily homeless person because, with no other place \nto live, the person would be using the blanket for purposes \nof maintaining a place to live.  In brief, blanket use in a \npublic park is criminal if you are homeless and “lawful \nconduct” if you are not.  As with the ordinances in Manning \nregarding alcoholics, the ordinances addressed in Grants \nPass  single  out  the  involuntarily  homeless  for \ncriminalization of otherwise lawful conduct. \nJudge  O’Scannlain’s  purported  “deep  and  varied \nintercircuit split over how to read the Eighth Amendment” is \nan illusion.  The Ninth Circuit is the sole circuit to have \naddressed, on the merits, a challenge to the criminalization \nof sleeping in public by involuntarily homeless persons.  The \nNinth Circuit’s current approach is faithful to Supreme Court \nprecedent and consistent with the Fourth Circuit’s approach \nto a similar issue.  Thus, Judge O’Scannlain’s desire to hear \nGrants Pass en banc is so that a circuit split with the Fourth \nCircuit can be created, not that an existing circuit split can \nbe resolved.   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 111 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    111 \nVI. Evidence Not in the Record \nJudge M. Smith cites a wide variety of extra-record \nevidence  establishing  homelessness  is  a  serious  issue \n“caused by a complex mix of economic, mental-health, and \nsubstance-abuse factors.”  Everyone agrees.  Judge M. Smith \nthen states, “local governments have taken a variety of steps \nintended to ameliorate the crisis . . . but most of these \nattempts to mitigate the challenging issues of homelessness \nhave  been  wholly  or  partially  frustrated  by  an  alleged \nconstitutional right conjured by a panel of our court.”  This \nappears to say that, but for Martin and now Grants Pass, \nlocal governments would be able to pursue policies that \nwould reduce the homeless population.  In other words, \nJudge  M.  Smith  believes  Martin  and  Grants  Pass  are \nsomewhat  responsible  for  the  size  of  the  homeless \npopulation.  That is not sensible.   \nJudge M. Smith points out the City of Los Angeles has \nroughly 70,000 homeless persons.  Judge M. Smith seems to \nbelieve at least some of those 70,000 persons, and more \nthroughout the Ninth Circuit, remain homeless because of \nthe very limited protection offered by Martin.  Thus, it \nfollows that if Martin were overruled and criminal penalties \nwere again possible, at least some of those 70,000 persons in \nLos Angeles would obtain housing.  Judge M. Smith does \nnot cite any authority that shows the possibility of criminal \npenalties would have this effect.  Available evidence points \naway from such a conclusion.  See, e.g., Donald Saelinger, \nNowhere  to  Go:  The  Impacts  of  City  Ordinances \nCriminalizing Homelessness, 13 Geo. J. on Poverty L. & \nPol'y 545, 559 (2006) (“[C]riminalization laws make it much \nmore difficult for the homeless to gain social and economic \nmobility, and thus the laws have the result of extending the \nperiod of time that one is homeless.”).   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 112 of 155\n112  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nJudge  M.  Smith’s  extra-record  evidence  is  carefully \nlimited to support his causal theory.  But if extra-record \nevidence  should  be  considered,  other  jurisdictions  show \nMartin is not the problem.  New York City is experiencing a \ncrisis  in  the  increase  of  the  involuntarily  homeless \npopulation.  As of February 2023, New York City had more \nthan  77,000  homeless  persons,  “by  far  the  most  ever \nrecorded and an increase of over 70 percent since May.”  \nEmma G. Fitzsimmons and Andy Newman, New York City \nCommissioner Of Social Services Resigns, The New York \nTimes (Feb. 8, 2023).  New York City is not in the Ninth \nCircuit and it seems unlikely the holding in Martin is causing \na surge in the homeless population across the country.  Thus, \nMartin is not, as alleged, the driver of the homelessness \nproblem. \nVII. Conclusion \nThe Eighth Amendment “imposes substantive limits on \nwhat  can  be  made  criminal  and  punished  as  such.”  \nIngraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 667 (1977).  Those \nsubstantive limits are implicated only in rare circumstances.  \nOne such circumstance is when a jurisdiction attempts to \npunish  as  a  criminal  offense  the  life-sustaining  act  of \nsleeping in public with bedding when a person has nowhere \nelse  to  go.    Because  Grants  Pass  and  Martin  provide \nexceptionally  limited  protection,  and  are  consistent  with \nSupreme Court precedent, the decision not to rehear Grants \nPass en banc is correct.7 \n \n7 The city ordinances addressed in Grants Pass will be superseded, to \nsome extent, on July 1, 2023, when a new Oregon state law takes effect.  \nThe new state law requires “[a]ny city or county law that regulates the \nacts of sitting, lying, sleeping or keeping warm and dry outdoors on \npublic property that is open to the public must be objectively reasonable \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 113 of 155\n  JOHNSON V.

SMITH joins as to all parts except Part II-A, respecting \nthe denial of rehearing en banc: \nWith  this  decision,  our  Circuit’s  jurisprudence  now \neffectively  guarantees  a  personal  federal  constitutional \n‘right’ for individuals to camp or to sleep on sidewalks and \nin parks, playgrounds, and other public places in defiance of \ntraditional  health,  safety,  and  welfare  laws—a  dubious \nholding premised on a fanciful interpretation of the Eighth \nAmendment.  We are the first and only federal circuit to have \ndivined such a strange and sweeping mandate from the Cruel \nand Unusual Punishments Clause.  Our jurisprudence in this \ncase is egregiously flawed and deeply damaging—at war \nwith constitutional text, history, and tradition, and Supreme \nCourt precedent.

This change in state law is yet another \nreason why it was wise to not rehear Grants Pass.   \n1 As a judge of this court in senior status, I no longer have the power to \nvote on calls for rehearing cases en banc or formally to join a dissent \nfrom failure to rehear en banc.

We should have reheard this  case en banc to \nreconsider our unfortunate constitutional mistake. \nI \nInstead of respecting constitutional “text, history, and \nprecedent,” Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., 142 S. \nCt.  2228,  2271  (2022),  our  Eighth  Amendment \njurisprudence here has disrupted the “paramount role of the \nStates  in  setting  ‘standards  of  criminal  responsibility,’” \nKahler v. Kansas, 140 S. Ct. 1021, 1028 (2020) (quoting \nPowell v. Texas, 392 U.S. 514, 533 (1968) (plurality)).  In \nmy view, our cases do not inspire confidence that we have \nfaithfully  followed  the  Cruel  and  Unusual  Punishments \nClause—and it is worth explaining how we got here before \nconsidering why we should have reheard Grants Pass en \nbanc to fix our constitutional mistakes.

City of Grants Pass, 50 F.4th 787 (9th \nCir. 2022) (expanding the doctrine). \nA \nOur  untenable  jurisprudence  here  started  in  Boise—\nwhere  a  three-judge  panel  first  invented  a  federal \nconstitutional ‘right’ (rooted in the Eighth Amendment, of \nall  places!)  to  sleep  on  public  property.    In  Boise,  six \nhomeless individuals alleged that the City of Boise, Idaho, \nhad  violated  their  constitutional  rights  by  enforcing \nmunicipal ordinances that prohibited unauthorized sleeping \non sidewalks and in parks, plazas, and other public places.  \nEven though the Eighth Amendment, on its own terms, only \nprohibits  “cruel  and  unusual  punishments,”  U.S.  Const. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 115 of 155\n  JOHNSON V.

VIII, the Boise panel went where no federal circuit \nhad  gone  before—holding  that  the  Eighth  Amendment \nprohibited a local government from “prosecuting people \ncriminally” for the “involuntary act” of “sleeping outside on \npublic property [including sidewalks] when those people \nhave no home or other shelter to go to.”  Boise, 920 F.3d at \n603, 613, 616 (cleaned up).   \nIn doing so, the Boise panel made no effort to ground its \ndecision  in  the  text,  history,  or  tradition  of  the  Eighth \nAmendment.    Instead—after  failing  to  identify  a  single \nSupreme Court precedent blessing its approach—the Boise \npanel attempted to fashion its preferred constitutional rule by \nstitching together dicta in a lone concurrence with a dissent.  \nId. at 616 (holding that these separate, unprevailing writings \nin Powell “compel[led]” Boise’s result).  While we declined \nto rehear Boise en banc, see id. at 590-99 (M.

See Grants Pass, 50 F.4th at 792-93, 813.2  \nIn this case, several individuals sought to represent a putative \nclass of all involuntarily homeless people living in Grants \nPass,  seeking  a  permanent  injunction  barring  the \nenforcement  of  municipal  ordinances  that  prohibited \nunauthorized sleeping or camping in public spaces.

The district court sided with \nthe challengers—and it certified a class consisting of “[a]ll \ninvoluntarily homeless individuals living in Grants Pass,” \nand held that the City’s enforcement of the public-sleeping \nand  public-camping  ordinances  violated  the  Eighth \nAmendment.

While  our  mistaken \njurisprudence in this area has some limits, see Grants Pass, 50 F.4th at \n812 n.33, we should not pretend that the jurisprudential experiment \nstarted by Boise and expanded by Grants Pass—which “effectively \nstrikes down the anti-camping and anti-sleeping [o]rdinances … of \ncountless, if not all, cities within our jurisdiction,” Boise, 920 F.3d at 599 \n(M.

After concluding that class \ncertification was proper, the panel majority held, following \nBoise, that the City could not enforce the public-camping \nand  park-exclusion  ordinances  against  “involuntarily \nhomeless persons” for the “mere act of sleeping” or camping \nin public spaces when “there is no other place in the City for \nthem to go.”  Id. at 798 & n.12, 813 (remanding, inter alia, \non  the  public-sleeping  ordinance  because  the  relevant \nplaintiff had died).  It also expanded Boise by holding that \nthe City could not deprive persons of whatever materials \nthey needed “to keep … warm and dry,” and by extending \nBoise  from  the  purely  criminal  arena  to  civil  fines  and \ncitations.  Id. at 806-09.  In doing so, the panel majority—\ncontent to rest on Boise’s tortured reading of Supreme Court \nprecedent, see id. at 808-11—declined to devote any serious \nattention  to  the  text,  history,  or  tradition  of  the  Eighth \nAmendment. \n2 \nJudge Collins dissented.  Id. at 814-31.  He explained, \ninter alia, that the case should be reheard en banc because \nthe panel majority decision combined a “gross misreading of \n[Boise] with a flagrant disregard of settled class-certification \nprinciples,” and because “the foundation on which [the panel \nmajority decision] is built is deeply flawed: [Boise] seriously \nmisconstrued  the  Eighth  Amendment  and  the  Supreme \nCourt’s caselaw construing it.”  Id. at 814, n.1.  In his view, \nBoise has “‘generate[d] dire practical consequences for the \nhundreds of local governments within our jurisdiction,’” and \nthose harms will be “greatly magnified by the egregiously \nflawed  reconceptualization  and  extension  of  [Boise’s] \nholding.”  Id. at 831 (quoting Boise, 920 F.3d at 594 (M. \nSmith, J., dissental)). \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 118 of 155\n118  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nII \nThere is a simple reason why we should have reheard \nGrants Pass en banc: it entrenches a deeply damaging and \negregiously wrong construction of the Eighth Amendment in \nour Circuit’s precedent.  An “erroneous interpretation” of the \nConstitution is “always important.”  Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at \n2265.  But some judicial mistakes are “more damaging” than \nothers—and “more than just wrong.”  Id. at 2265-66.  The \nnovel and expansive jurisprudence entrenched by Grants \nPass—which thumbs its nose at the “standard grounds for \nconstitutional  decisionmaking[:]  text,  history,  and \nprecedent”—stands on “exceptionally weak grounds” and \n“should be overruled.”  Id. at 2264, 2266, 2271. \nA \nThe first flaw in Grants Pass’s jurisprudence is that it \nconflicts with the text, history, and tradition of the Eighth \nAmendment—which  demonstrate  that  the  Cruel  and \nUnusual Punishments Clause does not establish a federal \nconstitutional  “doctrine[]  of  criminal  responsibility.”  \nKahler, 140 S. Ct. at 1028 (cleaned up).  Constitutional text, \nhistory, and tradition make plain that the Clause was directed \nto modes of punishment—and that it was never intended to \narrogate the substantive authority of legislatures to prohibit \n“acts” like those at issue here, and “certainly not before \nconviction.”  Boise, 920 F.3d at 602 (Bennett, J., dissental).  \nIndeed, one might question whether the Cruel and Unusual \nPunishments  Clause  has  anything  to  do  with  the \njurisprudence embraced by Grants Pass—which authorizes \na plaintiff who has never been assigned a “punishment,” let \nalone one that is “cruel and unusual,” to challenge traditional \nanti-vagrancy regulations under the Clause.  It is regrettable \nthat  Grants  Pass  never  meaningfully  engaged  the  text, \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 119 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    119 \nhistory, and tradition of the Constitution—which are the \n“standard  grounds  for  constitutional  decisionmaking.”  \nDobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2271 (“text, history, and precedent”); \nsee, e.g., Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 664 (1977) \n(“history” and precedent); Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.S. \n407, 421 (2008) (“text, history, meaning, and purpose”); see \nalso, e.g., Kennedy v. Bremerton Sch. Dist., 142 S. Ct. 2407, \n2428  (2022)  (“historical  practices  and  understandings” \n(cleaned up)); New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n, Inc. v. \nBruen, 142 S. Ct. 2111, 2128-29 (2022) (“text and history”); \nWashington  v.  Glucksberg,  521  U.S.  702,  721  (1997) \n(“history and tradition” (cleaned up)). \n1 \nThe Eighth Amendment provides, “Excessive bail shall \nnot be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and \nunusual punishments inflicted.”  U.S. Const. amend. VIII \n(emphasis  added).    The  Amendment’s  bar  on  excessive \n“bail,” excessive “fines,” and the infliction of cruel and \nunusual “punishments” indicates the Amendment’s punitive \nfocus.  And the text of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments \nClause itself provides no substantive limit on what conduct \nmay be punished.  Instead, it only prohibits “punishments” \n(i.e., pain or suffering inflicted for a crime or offense) that \nare “cruel” (i.e., marked by savagery and barbarity) and \n“unusual”  (i.e.,  not  in  common  use),  reflecting  a \nconstitutional  prohibition  originally  and  traditionally \nunderstood  to  forbid  the  government  from  “authorizing \nparticular forms or ‘modes’ of punishment—specifically, \ncruel  methods  of  punishment  that  are  not  regularly  or \ncustomarily employed.”  Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. \n957,  976  (1991)  (opinion  of  Scalia,  J.);  id.  at  979 \n(“[b]reaking on the wheel,” “flaying alive,” and “maiming, \nmutilating,  and  scourging  to  death”  (cleaned  up)). \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 120 of 155\n120  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nConstitutional  text,  history,  and  tradition  make  clear—\ncontrary to Grants Pass’s holding—that the Clause was not \noriginally understood to displace the authority of legislatures \nto prohibit historically proscribable acts (and certainly not \nbefore any punishment was imposed), see Boise, 920 F.3d at \n599-603 (Bennett, J., dissental), and that the Clause was not \ntraditionally taken to enshrine a constitutional “doctrine[] of \ncriminal responsibility,” Kahler, 140 S. Ct. at 1028 (cleaned \nup). \n2 \nUltimately, the text, history, and tradition of the Eighth \nAmendment teach a simple truth: the Cruel and Unusual \nPunishments  Clause—a  constitutional  prohibition \nfundamentally centered on modes of punishment—is not a \nboundless remedy for all social and policy ills, including \nhomelessness.  It does not empower us to displace state and \nlocal decisionmakers with our own enlightened view of how \nto address a public crisis over which we can claim neither \nexpertise nor authority, and it certainly does not authorize us \nto dictate municipal policy here.  Given the “centuries-long \nevolution of the collection of interlocking and overlapping \nconcepts which the common law has utilized to assess the \nmoral  accountability  of  an  individual  for  his  antisocial \ndeeds,” including the “doctrines of actus reus, mens rea, \ninsanity, mistake, justification, and duress,” the “process of \nadjustment” of the “tension between the evolving aims of the \ncriminal law and changing religious, moral, philosophical, \nand medical views of the nature of man” has primarily “been \nthought to be the province of the States.”  Powell, 392 U.S. \nat 535-36 (plurality).  So long as “the accused has committed \nsome act, has engaged in some behavior, which society has \nan interest in preventing, or perhaps in historical common \nlaw terms, has committed some actus reus,” the Eighth \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 121 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    121 \nAmendment does not prohibit punishing such an act merely \n“because it is, in some sense, ‘involuntary’ or ‘occasioned \nby a compulsion.’”  Id. at 533.  It is troubling that our \nCircuit—in inventing a new individual ‘right’ unmoored \nfrom  text,  history,  or  tradition—has  twisted  the  Eighth \nAmendment to displace the substantive authority of local \nofficials to prohibit a species of antisocial conduct that was \nneither originally nor traditionally thought to warrant the \nprotection of the Constitution, let alone immunity under the \nCruel and Unusual Punishments Clause. \nB \nThe second flaw in Grants Pass’s jurisprudence is that it \nlacks any foundation in the Eighth Amendment doctrine \nhanded down to us by the Supreme Court—which, to be \nclear, has never accepted Grants Pass’s theory that the Cruel \nand  Unusual  Punishments  Clause  establishes  a  federal \nconstitutional  prohibition  on  the  criminalization  of \npurportedly  nonvolitional  conduct.    While  Grants  Pass \npurports faithfully to follow the Supreme Court’s decisions \nin Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660 (1962), and Powell \nv. Texas, 392 U.S. 514 (1968), it actually rests on a plain \nmisreading of the Supreme Court’s instructions because it \ndoes little more than combine dicta in a solo concurrence \nwith a dissent.  In doing so, Grants Pass has clearly erred—\nembracing a startling misapplication of the Marks doctrine \nto venture far astray from Supreme Court precedent, see \nMarks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977) (“When a \nfragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale \nexplaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the \nholding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by \nthose Members who  concurred in the judgments on the \nnarrowest grounds.” (cleaned up)). \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 122 of 155\n122  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \n1 \nThe  Supreme  Court  has  never  blessed  our  Circuit’s \nsweeping approach to the Eighth Amendment here—and \nneither Robinson nor Powell provide any support for Grants \nPass’s  adventurous  holding.    In  Robinson,  the  Supreme \nCourt first articulated the status-act distinction that should \nhave made this a simple case—holding only that the Eighth \nAmendment prohibited states from making it a crime “to be \naddicted to the use of narcotics.”  Robinson, 370 U.S. at 662 \n(cleaned up).  Unlike laws “punish[ing] a person for the use \nof narcotics, for their purchase, sale or possession, or for \nantisocial  or  disorderly  behavior  resulting  from  their \nadministration,” the California law invalidated by Robinson \npunished the mere “status” of narcotics addiction, unmoored \nfrom any particular conduct.  Id. at 662, 666.  The holding of \nRobinson is simple: the criminal law cannot punish status \n(e.g., “be[ing] addicted to the use of narcotics”); it can only \npunish conduct (e.g., “the use of narcotics”).  Id. at 662-67 \n(cleaned up); see Manning v. Caldwell for City of Roanoke, \n930 F.3d 264, 288 (4th Cir. 2019) (en banc) (Wilkinson, J., \ndissenting). \nThe Supreme Court has not wavered from the status-act \ndistinction articulated by Robinson—and Powell is certainly \nno exception.  In Powell, decided soon after Robinson, a \nfractured Supreme Court upheld a Texas law prohibiting \npublic drunkenness against an Eighth Amendment challenge \nalleging that the alcoholic’s status compelled him to drink in \npublic.  Powell, 392 U.S. 514.  No controlling majority \nrejected the status-act line drawn by Robinson: (1) Justice \nMarshall’s four-justice plurality upheld the statute based on \nRobinson’s status-act distinction, id. at 516-37 (plurality); \n(2) Justice White’s lone concurrence (the dispositive fifth \nvote) upheld the statute because it involved a volitional act, \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 123 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    123 \nand he declined to determine whether a non-volitional act \ncould be criminalized, id. at 548-54 (White, J., concurring); \nand  (3)  Justice  Fortas’s  four-justice  dissent  rejected \nRobinson’s status-act distinction and deemed the statute’s \nenforcement  unconstitutional,  id.  at  554-70  (Fortas,  J., \ndissenting).  Because Justice White did not “reach[] the \nbroader question of compulsion, the judgment in Powell \nneither extended [n]or contracted Robinson, which was left \nundisturbed.”  Manning, 930 F.3d at 289 (Wilkinson, J., \ndissenting).  And the Supreme Court has certainly never \nunderstood Powell to have such broad effect: it has neither \n“walked  away  from  Robinson”  nor  “embraced  [Boise’s] \nwhole notion of nonvolitional conduct.”  Id. \n2 \nNevertheless,  Grants  Pass—turning  to  Powell’s \nfractured decision, see  Grants Pass, 50 F.4th at 809-11 \n(contorting  Powell  and  Marks)—attempts  to  “tease  [its] \npreferred  reading  from  the  dicta  of  a  single  justice,” \nManning,  930  F.3d  at  290  (Wilkinson,  J.,  dissenting).  \nGrants Pass’s distortion of Powell clearly violates Marks—\nwhich, as explained, instructs that the Court’s holding is \n“that position taken by those Members who concurred in the \njudgment[] on the narrowest grounds.”  Marks, 430 U.S. at \n193 (cleaned up).  Because no victorious majority in Powell \ndisrupted  Robinson’s  “status-act”  distinction  or  blessed \nGrants Pass’s “involuntary conduct” theory, we are left with \nnothing  more  than  Grants  Pass’s  attempt  to  craft  its \npreferred rule by combining dicta in a concurrence with a \ndissent—which  means  that  Grants  Pass  is  ultimately \npredicated on a plain Marks violation.  Such a fundamental \nmistake, which directly implicates the limits on an inferior \ncourt’s authority to circumvent the limits of such controlling \nprecedents, should not remain the law of our Circuit. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 124 of 155\n124  JOHNSON V.

But even apart \nfrom the constitutional errors entrenched by Grants Pass, \nthere  are  additional,  compelling  reasons  why  this  case \nwarranted rehearing en banc.  Perhaps most importantly, our \nexpansive  interpretation  of  the  Cruel  and  Unusual \nPunishments Clause diverges from other courts on an issue \nof exceptional importance—and it is telling that we remain \nthe  only  circuit  bold  enough  to  embrace  an  Eighth \nAmendment  doctrine  that  effectively  requires  local \ncommunities to surrender their sidewalks and other public \nplaces to homeless encampments. \nA \nThe  Eighth  Amendment  jurisprudence  undergirding \nGrants Pass squarely conflicts with decisions from other \ncircuits and other courts.  We should not pretend that our \nCircuit’s divination of a personal constitutional ‘right’ to \nencamp on public property (including sidewalks) is anything \nbut the inventive, judge-made novelty that we all know it to \nbe. \n1 \nThe  first  set  of  conflicts—which  centers  on  Grants \nPass’s result—is plain.  No federal circuit or state supreme \ncourt (not one!) has ever embraced Grants Pass’s sweeping \nholding  that  the  Eighth  Amendment  prohibits  the \nenforcement  of  public-camping  restrictions  (including \nbefore  any  punishment  is  imposed).    Other  circuits  to \nconsider the issue have uniformly upheld such laws against \nEighth Amendment challenges.  See Joel v. City of Orlando, \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 125 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    125 \n232 F.3d 1353, 1356, 1361-62 (11th Cir. 2000) (upholding \npublic-camping proscription because “[a] distinction exists \nbetween applying criminal laws to punish conduct, which is \nconstitutionally permissible, and applying them to punish \nstatus, which is not”); see also Johnson v. City of Dallas, 61 \nF.3d 442, 443-45, n.5 (5th Cir. 1995) (rejecting challenge to \npublic-camping  proscription  because  the  prohibition  on \ncruel  and  unusual  punishments  is  applicable  only  after \nprosecution and conviction, and none of the challengers had \nbeen  “convicted  of  violating  the  sleeping  in  public \nordinance” (relying on Ingraham, 430 U.S. at 664)).  And no \nstate  supreme  court  has  reached  the  same  result  as  our \naberrant decision here.  See Tobe v. City of Santa Ana, 892 \nP.2d 1145, 1166 (Cal. 1995) (upholding public-camping \nregulation because the “ordinance permits punishment for \nproscribed conduct, not punishment for status”); Allen v. \nCity  of  Sacramento,  234  Cal.  App.  4th  41,  60  (2015) \n(upholding  public-camping  bar  because  “the  Eighth \nAmendment does not prohibit the punishment of acts,” and \nthe “ordinance punishes the act[] of [illegal] camping, … not \nhomelessness”).    No  defender  of  Grants  Pass’s \njurisprudence has provided a compelling response to these \ndecisions, see Boise, 920 F.3d at 617 n.9 (attempting to \nreconcile  Boise  with  Joel’s  alternative  rationale,  but \ndeclining to do much else); Grants Pass, 50 F.4th 787 (not \neven attempting this much)—let alone a federal appellate or \nstate supreme court case that has ever reached Grants Pass’s \nresult.  While Grants Pass has not been replicated elsewhere, \naside from a smattering of trial-level dispositions, a decision \nthat stands so far out of step with so many other courts is one \nthat cries out for correction. \n2 \nThe second set of conflicts—which relates to Grants \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 126 of 155\n126  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nPass’s rationale—is similarly troublesome.  Our approach to \nthe Eighth Amendment in this area conflicts with decisions \nfrom the First Circuit, Fourth Circuit, and Seventh Circuit, \nwhich  embrace  several  competing  tests  for  determining \nwhether  the  Eighth  Amendment  immunizes  involuntary \nconduct.  At least two other circuits—the First Circuit and \nthe Seventh Circuit—have flatly rejected the Grants Pass \nprinciple that purportedly “involuntary” conduct is exempt \nfrom criminal liability under the Eighth Amendment, or that \nJustice White’s lone concurrence in Powell provides the \nbinding opinion that compels such exemptions.  See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Sirois, 898 F.3d 134, 137-38 (1st Cir. 2018); \nUnited States v. Stenson, 475 F. App’x 630, 631 (7th Cir. \n2012) (citing United States v. Black, 116 F.3d 198, 200-01 \n(7th Cir. 1997)); see also supra (collecting cases rejecting \nGrants Pass’s reading of Robinson, Powell, and Ingraham).  \nAnd  the  Fourth  Circuit—the  only  circuit  that  embraces \nanything like Grants Pass’s approach—provides, at best, \nonly  mixed  support  because  even  though  it  held  that \ninvoluntary conduct may be exempt based on dicta in Justice \nWhite’s lone concurrence, it limited its holding to laws that \n“singled”  individuals  “out  for  special  punishment  for \notherwise lawful conduct that is compelled by their illness.”  \nManning, 930 F.3d at 281 n.14.  Our Circuit is, therefore, \nlocked in a deep and varied intercircuit split over how to read \nthe Eighth Amendment in light of Robinson and Powell—\nand, as explained, we are the only federal court of appeals to \nhave  discovered  a  personal  constitutional  ‘right’  for \nindividuals  to  encamp  on  public  property  (including \nsidewalks)  in  violation  of  traditional  health,  safety,  and \nwelfare laws, a result that no other federal circuit or state \nsupreme  court  in  the  country  has  been  bold  enough  to \nreplicate. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 127 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    127 \nB \nGrants  Pass  also  presents  a  question  of  exceptional \npractical  and  institutional  importance.    The  immodest \napproach to the Eighth Amendment that it embraces is both \ntroubling and dangerous.  It undermines the power of state \nand local governments to address the homelessness crisis.  \nAnd  it  arrogates  to  federal  judges  authority  that  the \nConstitution reserves elsewhere.  We should have granted \nrehearing en banc to stop the damage already being worked \nby Boise and to stave off the mischiefs that Grants Pass is \nsure to worsen.  It is regrettable that our Circuit has declined \nto grapple with the consequences of our mistakes. \n1 \nThe practical consequences should have been reason \nenough to reconsider our jurisprudential experiment before \nit did any more harm to our communities—and before its \ndangers  were  exacerbated  by  Grants  Pass.    No  one \nreasonably doubts that our existing precedent in Boise has \ncreated grave and troubling consequences for the state and \nlocal communities within our jurisdiction.   And no one \nmeaningfully  contests  that  these  harms  will  be  greatly \nworsened by the doctrinal innovations introduced by Grants \nPass.  One need only walk through our neighborhoods—\nthrough the Tenderloin (San Francisco) or Skid Row (Los \nAngeles)—to know that our communities are fast coming \nundone.  Tents crowding out sidewalks, needles flooding \nparks,  and  rubbish  (and  worse)  marring  public  squares \nreflect a threat to the public welfare that should not be taken \nlightly.  Nor do such troubling blights mark an area where \nwe should be eager to throw caution to the wind and to \nembrace  judicial  adventurism  so  far  removed  from  the \nguardrails set by the Constitution’s text and the Supreme \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 128 of 155\n128  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nCourt’s precedents. \nUnfortunately, the “Hobson’s choice” imposed by our \nCircuit  effectively  requires  state  and  local  officials  to \n“abandon enforcement of a host of laws regulating public \nhealth and safety,” Boise, 920 F.3d at 594 (M. Smith, J., \ndissental)—and,  if  today’s  decision  is  any  guide,  our \nprecedents will readily be wielded effectively to require \njurisdictions throughout our Circuit to surrender the use of \nmany  of  their  public  spaces  (including  sidewalks)  to \nhomeless encampments.  It is easy enough for us, behind \nmarble walls and sealed doors, to dismiss the consequences \nof our decisions.  But for those who call these communities \nhome—who must live by the criminal violence, narcotics \nactivity, and dangerous diseases that plague the homeless \nencampments  buttressed  by  our  decisions—the \nconsequences of our judicial arrogation are harder to accept. \n2 \nIn addition to the practical harms that our jurisprudence \ncreates for our communities, we also should have ended the \njurisprudential mistake embraced by Grants Pass as quickly \nas possible because it “visit[s] structural and institutional \ndamage in so many respects.”  Manning, 930 F.3d at 305 \n(Wilkinson,  J.,  dissenting).    In  particular,  the  doctrine \nembraced by Grants Pass puts “judges in policymaking roles \nreserved largely for legislatures and states.”  Id. at 297.  It \nerodes “the states’ role as separate sovereigns entrusted to \ndefine  the  criminal  law  within  their  own  borders,”  and \n“pushes the Eighth Amendment as a catch-all corrective” for \nsocial  ills  identified  by  inexpert  and  unelected  judicial \nofficers.  Id.  Under our federal system, state and local \nleaders—not distant federal judges—are primarily entrusted \nwith the power and duty to protect the common welfare of \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 129 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    129 \nour towns, cities, and neighborhoods, and to ensure that our \nstreets, squares, and sidewalks remain clean and safe.  See \nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 561 n.3 (1995).  The \nreason for such “legislative responsibility over criminal law \nis fundamental: the criminal law exists to protect the safety \nof citizens, and ensuring the safety of the people is one of \nthose  things  that  popular  government  exists  to  do.”  \nManning,  930  F.3d  at  297  (Wilkinson,  J.,  dissenting).  \nUnfortunately,  this  has  not  swayed  our  Court—with \nconsequences that will sweep well past the troubles visited \nupon the City of Boise and the City of Grants Pass. \nIV \nGrants Pass is a regrettable mistake that entrenches and \nexpands  upon  previous  deeply  damaging  jurisprudence.  \nWhile I do not doubt the good faith of my colleagues, it is \nhard to imagine a jurisprudence that combines so little regard \nfor the sacred words of the Constitution, with so much \ndisregard  for  the  state  and  local  authorities  that  our \nconstitutional system entrusts as the primary protectors of \nthe health, safety, and welfare of our communities.  Our \njurisprudence  here  is  flawed—in  conflict  with  the  text, \nhistory, and tradition of the Eighth Amendment, and the \nprecedents of the Supreme Court.  And it splits from other \ncircuits on a question of exceptional importance, working \ngreat violence to our constitutional structure and threatening \ndire consequences for communities within our jurisdiction.  \nIt is most regrettable that our Court has failed to rehear this \ncase en banc. \n   \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 130 of 155\n130  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nGRABER, Senior Circuit Judge, respecting the denial of \nrehearing en banc: \n \nThe constitutional limits on a municipality’s ability to \naddress the issue of homelessness present an exceptionally \nimportant  and  complex  topic.    I  appreciate  the  many \nthoughtful  views  expressed  by  my  colleagues.    I  write \nseparately to offer a middle ground. \nWhether or not the result is dictated by Powell v. Texas, \n392  U.S.  514  (1968),  the  Eighth  Amendment  almost \ncertainly  prohibits  criminal  punishment  of  persons  who \nengage in truly involuntary actions such as sleeping.  I thus \nagree with the underlying legal premise of the decisions in \nJohnson v. City of Grants Pass, 50 F.4th 787 (9th Cir. 2022), \nand Martin v. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584 (9th Cir. 2019).  \nEighth Amendment protection also extends to individualized \ninjunctive relief, such as precluding a municipality from \nenforcing a particular criminal provision against a specific \nperson, if past actions by the municipality warrant such \nequitable  relief.    Our  opinion  in  Martin,  though \ncontroversial,  reached  a  reasonable  result,  particularly \nbecause  Martin  emphasized  the  “narrow”  nature  of  its \nholding.  920 F.3d at 617.  I did not join, and did not agree \nwith, the dissents from denial of rehearing en banc in Martin. \nIn my view, though, the extension of Martin to classwide \nrelief, enjoining civil statutes that may eventually lead to \ncriminal  violations  but  have  never  resulted  in  criminal \nconvictions for any named plaintiff, is a step too far from the \nindividualized  inquiries  inherent  both  in  the  Eighth \nAmendment context and in the context of injunctive relief.  \nA  key  part  of  Johnson’s  reasoning  begins  with  the \nobservation that civil citations could lead to a civil park-\nexclusion order which, in turn, could lead to a prosecution \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 131 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    131 \nfor criminal trespass (but which never has for the named \nplaintiffs).1  Johnson, 50 F.4th at 807–08.  The opinion then \nconcludes  that,  because  the  Eighth  Amendment  would \nprohibit that ultimate prosecution, it also must prohibit the \ncivil citations.  Id.  I disagree with that double leap in logic.  \nEven  assuming  that  classwide  injunctive  relief  were \navailable against a prosecution for criminal trespass, the \nEighth Amendment does not prohibit all civil remedies that \ncould, in theory, lead to such a prosecution.  In this way, \nJohnson  unjustifiably  expands  the  reach  of  the  Eighth \nAmendment. \nThe  challenges  faced  by  individuals  experiencing \nhomelessness  are  severe.    And  the  challenges  that  face \nmunicipalities are daunting.  When called upon, we have an \nobligation to ensure that a municipality’s efforts to provide \nfor  the  common  health  and  safety  do  not  violate  the \nConstitution.  I agree with the basic legal premise that the \nEighth Amendment protects against criminal prosecution of \nthe involuntary act of sleeping, but the injunctive relief in \nthis case goes too far.  Moreover, given the widespread \nnature of the homelessness crisis in our jurisdiction, it is \n \n1 The amended opinion refers to Debra Blake as “a named plaintiff,” and \nthe amended opinion states that she was convicted of “Criminal Trespass \non City Property.”  Amended Op. at 28 n.13.  Blake unfortunately died.  \nAs the opinion elsewhere recognizes, Johnson, 50 F.4th at 800–02, she \nis no longer a named plaintiff.  Moreover, Blake’s “conviction” is doubly \ninapt here.  First, despite the name of the citation, the conviction was for \na violation, not a crime.  Second, Blake was cited for being in a closed \npark, not for violating any of the civil statutes challenged here.  The crux \nof the opinion’s analysis is that a civil citation could lead to a criminal \nmisdemeanor conviction under Oregon Revised Statute section 164.245.  \nJohnson, 50 F.4th at 807.  No evidence in the record suggests that the \ncivil statutes relevant here have caused Blake or any named plaintiff to \nbe convicted of that crime. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 132 of 155\n132  JOHNSON V.

What is more, as Judge O’Scannlain \nalso  explains,  Martin  violates  Supreme  Court  precedent \nregarding what constitutes binding precedent.  The Marks \nrule  instructs  in  no  uncertain  terms  that,  “[w]hen  a \nfragmented [Supreme] Court decides a case and no single \nrationale  explaining  the  result  enjoys  the  assent  of  five \nJustices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that \nposition taken by those Members who concurred in the \njudgments on the narrowest grounds.”  Marks v. United \nStates, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977) (cleaned up) (emphasis \nadded).    Yet  Martin  counted  to  five  votes  for  its \nunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment by including the \nfour votes of the Powell dissenters.  Martin, 920 F.3d at 616 \n(“The four dissenting Justices adopted a position consistent \nwith that taken by Justice White [in his concurrence] . . . .”).  \nWhen the Marks rule is properly applied to Powell v. Texas, \n392 U.S. 514 (1968), it produces the holding that Powell’s \n“conviction  was  constitutional  because  it  involved  the \ncommission of an act.  Nothing more, nothing less.”  Martin, \n920 F.3d at 591 (M. Smith, J., dissenting from denial of \nrehearing en banc); see also Grants Pass, 50 F.4th at 830 \n(Collins, J., dissenting) (“Under a correct application of \nMarks, the holding of Powell is that there is no constitutional \nobstacle to punishing conduct that has not been shown to be \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 138 of 155\n138  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \ninvoluntary, and the converse question of what rule applies \nwhen the conduct has been shown to be involuntary was left \nopen.”).  Put differently: When the Marks rule is properly \napplied, Martin cannot hide behind Powell and insist that \nSupreme  Court  precedent  “compels  the  conclusion”  it \nreached.  Martin, 920 F.3d at 616.   \nMartin therefore had the burden to affirmatively justify \nits rule—that a “state may not criminalize conduct that is an \nunavoidable  consequence”  of  a  person’s  status—as \nconsistent with the Eighth Amendment.  Id. at 617 (cleaned \nup).  But neither Martin nor the majority in this case even \nattempts  to  make  that  showing,  including  rebutting  the \nnumber of reasons Justice Thurgood Marshall and the other \nJustices in the Powell plurality thought an unavoidable-\nconsequence-of-status  rule  would  be  both  improper  and \nunworkable.  We are left completely in the dark as to why, \nfor example, the Martin panel and Grants Pass majority \napparently thought:  \n•  The Powell plurality was wrong to interpret Robinson \nv.  California,  370  U.S.  660  (1962)  as  a  ban  on \n“punish[ing]  a  mere  status”  and  nothing  more.  \nPowell, 392 U.S. at 532 (plurality) (Marshall, J.). \n•  The Powell plurality was wrong to be concerned that \nan  unavoidable-consequence-of-status  rule  would \nlack “any limiting principle.”  Id. at 533. \n•  The  Powell  plurality  was  wrong  to  think  that  a \nconstitutionalized  unavoidable-consequence  rule \nwould improperly override the ability of states to \ndevelop  “[t]he  doctrines  of  actus  reus,  mens  rea, \ninsanity, mistake, justification, and duress” to resolve \nas they think best “the tension between the evolving \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 139 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    139 \naims  of  the  criminal  law  and  changing  religious, \nmoral, philosophical, and medical views of the nature \nof man.”  Id. at 535–36. \n•  The  Powell  plurality  incorrectly  characterized  an \nunavoidable-consequence  rule  as  conferring  upon \nunelected federal judges the impossible task of being \n“the ultimate arbiter[s] of the standards of criminal \nresponsibility, in diverse areas of the criminal law, \nthroughout the country.”  Id. at 533.  \n•  The  punishment  flowing  from  a  public-camping \nprosecution (or even just a civil citation) constitutes \nthe “exceedingly rare” instance—outside the context \nof  capital  punishment  and  juvenile  life  without \nparole—where a particular sentence may violate the \nEighth Amendment.  Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U.S. 263, \n272 (1980); see Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. 460, \n469–70  (2012)  (summarizing  proportionality  case \nlaw). \nJudges Gould and Silver are correct to note that the Powell \nplurality is, after all, just a plurality.  But these questions, \nand others, still warranted a response—one would hope that \na lower court, when fashioning a novel constitutional rule, \nwould at least grapple with the reasons four Supreme Court \nJustices expressly chose to reject the very same rule.  The \ndistrict courts tasked with applying Martin/Grants Pass, the \nlocal governments placed in a straitjacket by these decisions, \nand the residents of our circuit who now must live with the \nconsequences  all  deserved  better  than  the  half-reasoned \ndecisions they received from our court. \nII. \nMoreover, even if one assumes arguendo that the Eighth \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 140 of 155\n140  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nAmendment supports an unavoidable-consequence-of-status \nprinciple, Grants Pass’s homelessness-specific analysis has \nnothing to do with that principle.  One would reasonably \nassume  that  Grants  Pass  implemented  Martin’s  general \nEighth  Amendment  principle  by  mandating  that  courts \nconduct an individualized inquiry: whether public camping \nby  the  individual  plaintiffs  before  the  court  is  an \n“unavoidable  consequence”  of  their  status  as  homeless \npersons—inquiring, for example, into whether the plaintiffs \ndeclined offers of temporary housing.9  But one would be \nmistaken  in  that  assumption.    Instead  of  calling  for  an \nindividualized inquiry, the original Grants Pass majority \nopinion candidly set forth a crude jurisdiction-wide inquiry: \n“The formula established in Martin is that the government \ncannot prosecute homeless people for sleeping in public if \nthere is  a  greater  number  of  homeless  individuals  in  a \njurisdiction than the number of available shelter spaces.”  \nGrants Pass, 50 F.4th at 795 (cleaned up); see id. at. 823–28 \n(Collins, J., dissenting) (arguing that Martin provides at \nmost  a  “case-specific,”  as-applied  claim).    The  original \n \n9 One short-term housing site in Los Angeles sits nearly empty despite \nproximity to a large homeless camp, and one of the new Los Angeles \nmayor’s  marquee  offers  of  short-term  housing  had  a  below-50% \nacceptance rate.

CITY OF GRANTS PASS    141 \nmajority opinion made clear that the beds-versus-population \n“formula” is all that matters: Because the plaintiffs in this \ncase established a shelter-beds deficit, they are deemed—no \nmatter  their  personal  situations—involuntarily  homeless, \nand the city effectively cannot enforce its ordinances against \nany homeless person. \nThe majority has now amended its opinion to remove \nthis “formula” language, and the opinion’s body now quotes \nMartin’s statement that individuals are outside the purview \nof its holding if they “have access to adequate temporary \nshelter, whether because they have the means to pay for it or \nbecause it is realistically available to them for free, but [they] \nchoose not to use it.”  Martin, 920 F.3d at 617 n.8.  But I fear \nthat this amendment, in reality, does little to change the \nsubstance of Grants Pass and instead simply obscures what \nGrants Pass holds.   \nNotably, the amendment is not accompanied by any \ndownstream changes to the majority’s application of its rule \nto the facts or its ultimate conclusion.  So, the “formula” \nlanguage  may  be  gone,  but  the  approach  that  language \nforthrightly described remains embedded in the opinion.  \nGrants Pass still holds that “[t]here, of course, exists no law \nor rule requiring a homeless person” to “provide the court an \naccounting of her finances and employment history” before \nbeing deemed “involuntarily homeless.”  50 F.4th at 811.  It \nstill  equates  a  shelter-beds  deficit  with  jurisdiction-wide \ninvoluntariness:  “[T]he  number  of  homeless  persons \noutnumber the available beds.  In other words, homeless \npersons have nowhere to shelter and sleep in the City . . . .”  \nId. at 792; see also id. at 797 (describing the district court \ndecision, which it largely affirms, as holding “that, based on \nthe unavailability of shelter beds, the City’s enforcement of \nits anti-camping and anti-sleeping ordinances violated the \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 142 of 155\n142  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nCruel and Unusual Punishment Clause”).  And it still treats \na  shelter-beds  deficit,  when  combined  with  conclusory \nallegations of involuntariness, as sufficient for an individual \nto show that he or she is involuntarily homeless: “Gloria \nJohnson  has  adequately  demonstrated  that  there  is  no \navailable shelter in Grants Pass and that she is involuntarily \nhomeless.”  Id. at 811. \nThe  amendment  thus  places  district  courts  in  an \nimpossible position.  They will not be able to reconcile \nGrants Pass’s disparate strands—because they cannot be \nreconciled.  District courts will have to choose between \nfollowing what Grants Pass now says in one place (there \nmust  be  a  meaningful  voluntariness  inquiry)  and  what \nGrants Pass says and does in another place (a shelter-beds \ndeficit and conclusory allegations are all one needs). \nIndeed,  Grants  Pass’s  class-certification  analysis \nconfirms that its nod to the unavoidable-consequence or \ninvoluntarily-homeless limitation is just window dressing—\nand that the amendment to the opinion is one of form, not \nsubstance.  As Judge Collins explained, if Martin’s public-\ncamping ban is truly limited to those who are involuntarily \nhomeless,  then  Martin-type  cases  cannot  possibly  be \nlitigated on a class-wide basis.  Grants Pass, 50 F.4th at 823–\n28 (Collins, J., dissenting).  To be certified, a putative class \nmust  satisfy  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  23’s \ncommonality requirement, among others.  “What matters” \nfor  purposes  of  that  requirement  “is  not  the  raising  of \ncommon  questions—even  in  droves—but  rather,  the \ncapacity of a class-wide proceeding to generate common \nanswers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.”  Wal-\nMart  Stores,  Inc.  v.  Dukes,  564  U.S.  338,  350  (2011) \n(cleaned up).  A court must be able to “resolve an issue that \nis central to the validity of each one of the [class members’] \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 143 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    143 \nclaims in one stroke.”  Id.  Whether a public-camping ban is \nunconstitutional as applied to a homeless plaintiff depends \n(it would seem) on whether that plaintiff is “involuntarily \nhomeless,” which in turn depends on a host of individualized \nfactors:  Did  they  decline  the  city’s  offer  of  temporary \nhousing?  Do they otherwise “have the means to pay” for \ntemporary housing?  Were there areas of the city where they \ncould publicly camp without citation in light of the city’s \nenforcement policies?  It blinks reality to say that the district \ncourt could, “in one stroke,” resolve the constitutionality of \nthe public-camping ban as applied to each of the “at least \naround 50” class members here.  Grants Pass, 50 F.4th at \n811. \nThe majority, for what it is worth, tries to backdoor \ninvoluntariness into its Rule 23 analysis.  But its argument is \none that Philosophy 101 professors should consider using as \ntheir go-to example of circular reasoning: The class satisfies \nRule  23’s  commonality  requirement  because  the  class \nmembers’  claims  all  present  the  question  of  whether \nenforcement  of  public-camping  ordinances  against \n“involuntarily  homeless  individuals  violates  the  Eighth \nAmendment.”  Id. at 804–05 n.22.  Answering that question \nresolves the claims of each class member “in one stroke” \nbecause “[p]ursuant to the class definition, the class includes \nonly  involuntarily  homeless  persons.”    Id.  at  804–05 \n(citation omitted).  The basis for that premise?  “[T]he record \nestablishes”  it.    Id.  at  804–05  n.22.    As  Judge  Collins \nexplained, there is “no authority for this audacious bootstrap \nargument.”  Id. at 827 (Collins, J., dissenting).  By wholly \ncollapsing the merits into the class definition, the majority \nopinion certified an impermissible “fail safe” class.  Id. \n(quoting Olean Wholesale Grocery Coop. v. Bumble Bee \nFoods, 31 F.4th 651, 670 n.14 (9th Cir. 2022) (en banc)). \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 144 of 155\n144  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nIn response to this criticism, Judges Gould and Silver \nsuggest that Grants Pass’s class-certification analysis is run \nof the mill—analogizing it to our court’s recent approval of \na  district  court’s  certification  of  a  class  of  California \nresidents who worked for a certain employer.  See Bernstein \nv. Virgin Am., Inc., 3 F.4th 1127, 1134 (9th Cir. 2021).  It is \ntelling  that  Judges  Gould  and  Silver  think  involuntary \nhomelessness  is  as  easily  determined  as  residency  and \nemployment  history—another  piece  of  evidence  that \nMartin’s involuntariness component has faded away or been \ncollapsed  into  the  shelter-beds  inquiry.    More \nfundamentally, their analogy overlooks that the Bernstein \nclass definition did not swallow the merits inquiry in the \nmanner that the class definition does here.  Separate from \nclass membership (based on residency and employment), the \nBernstein plaintiffs still had to make a merits showing that \nthe defendant violated California labor laws by, among other \nthings, failing to pay a minimum wage and to pay for all \nhours worked.  See id. at 1133.  Here, by contrast, the game \nis essentially over as soon as the class is certified.  The class \n(purportedly)  consists  only  of  involuntarily  homeless \npeople, and application of the challenged ordinances to the \nclass  members  is  unconstitutional  (under  our  flawed \nprecedent)  because  the  class  members  are  involuntarily \nhomeless. \nViewing the majority’s class-certification analysis, there \nare only two possible conclusions: Either (1) the majority \nerred in certifying the class despite a lack of commonality; \nor (2) the majority read “involuntarily” out of Martin’s \npurported involuntarily-homeless rule.  Either conclusion \npoints to profound error that we should have used the en \nbanc process to correct. \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 145 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    145 \nIII. \nJudges Gould and Silver insist that Martin and Grants \nPass apply only in “exceptionally narrow situation[s]” and \nthat critics of these decisions have resorted to “rhetorical \nexaggerations.”  But whose word should one take: that of a \npanel majority defending its own work or that of several \ndistrict court judges who have no dog in this fight and are \nsimply trying to understand and apply the law as we have \nhanded it down to them?  Several district court decisions \nhave  understood  Martin  and  now  Grants  Pass  to  run \nroughshod  over  normal  procedural  rules  and  past  any \nsubstantive  limiting  principles.    As  a  result,  local \ngovernments are hard-pressed to find any way to regulate the \nadverse health and safety effects of homeless encampments \nwithout running afoul of our court’s case law—or, at a \nminimum, being saddled with litigation costs.  If one picks \nup a map of the western United States and points to a city \nthat appears on it, there is a good chance that city has already \nfaced a lawsuit in the few short years since our court initiated \nits Martin experiment.  Without expressing any view on how \nother district courts or panels of our court should decide \nthese or similar cases pursuant to our existing precedent, I \noffer a few examples of the judicial adventurism our case \nlaw has already produced: \n1.  San Francisco responded conscientiously to Martin.  \nThe police department promulgated an enforcement bulletin \nintended to comply with that case’s dictates while retaining \nflexibility to clear some of the city’s worst encampments.  \nSee Coal. on Homelessness v. City & Cnty. of San Francisco, \nNo. 22-cv-05502-DMR, 2022 WL 17905114, at *3–7 (N.D. \nCal. Dec. 23, 2022).  Pursuant to the bulletin, an officer \ncannot arrest a homeless person for a set of enumerated \noffenses unless SFPD first “secure[s] appropriate shelter.”  \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 146 of 155\n146  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nId. at *4 (emphasis omitted).   SFPD policy requires officers \nto work with other city agencies to implement a multi-step \nprocess: The city posts a notice that an encampment clearing \nwill  occur  on  a  particular  date;  city  workers  perform \noutreach  at  the  encampment  the  weekend  before  the \nclearing; and city workers follow up at the encampment 24 \nto 72 hours before the clearing.  Id. at *5–7.  Only then can \nan encampment clearing take place.  To be sure, the record \non SFPD’s compliance with this policy was mixed. The \ndefendants  asserted  that  they  always  comply  with  the \npolicy—“conduct[ing]  regular  training[s]”  on  it,  setting \naside  beds  based  on  an  estimated  acceptance  rate,  and \nproviding  officers  with  the  means  to  check  shelter-bed \navailabilities.  Id. at *13–15, *23.  Some plaintiffs asserted \nthat they never received advance notice of encampment \nclearings or offers of housing.  Id. at *8–9.  Other plaintiffs \nasserted that SFPD sometimes complied with the policy and \n“acknowledge[d] receiving and/or accepting shelter offers at \n. . . encampment closures.”   Id. at *22; see also id. at *10–\n12.  The plaintiffs’ expert opined that San Francisco had a \nshelter-beds deficit but conceded that a “clear way to access \nshelter is via an encampment [closure] while under threat \nfrom law enforcement.”  Id. at *14. \nNonetheless, the court found the mixed record before it \nsufficient to issue a sweeping preliminary injunction.  The \ndistrict court repeatedly returned not to the facts of specific \nplaintiffs  in  specific  encampment  clearings  but  to  the \nconsideration at the center of Grants Pass: whether there is \na shelter-beds deficit.  See id. at *21 (“insufficient stock of \nshelter  beds”);  id.  *22  (“long-standing  shelter  bed \nshortfalls”); id. at *23 (“there are thousands more homeless \nindividuals . . . than there are available shelter beds”); id. at \n*27 (“shortfall of shelter beds”).  The court determined that \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 147 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    147 \nit “need not decide” how offers of housing, when actually \nmade, would impact the constitutionality of arrests or alter \nthe scope of an injunction.  See id. at *23–24.  The court \ninstead issued a broad, if ambiguous, injunction that appears \nto effectively prevent SFPD from enforcing five separate \nprohibitions against homeless persons in San Francisco “as \nlong as there are more homeless individuals . . . than there \nare shelter beds available.”  Id. at *28. \n2.  Phoenix suffered a similar fate.  Like San Francisco, \nit  adopted  a  policy  that  police  “officers  must  make \nindividualized assessments” before issuing citations against \nhomeless  persons  for  certain  offenses.    Fund  for \nEmpowerment v. City of Phoenix, No. CV-22-02041-PHX-\nGMS, 2022 WL 18213522, at *3 (D. Ariz. Dec. 16, 2022).  \nUnlike the San Francisco case, the district court cited no \nevidence in the record showing that Phoenix breached its \npolicy.  Still, the district court issued a sweeping injunction \nafter  conducting  a  merits  inquiry  that  focused  almost \nexclusively  on  the  Grants  Pass  beds-versus-population \ninquiry.  The district court noted that it was “not contested \nthat there are more unsheltered individuals than shelter beds \nin  Phoenix”  and  then  concluded  that  Phoenix’s  policy \n“present[s]  likely  unconstitutional  applications  especially \nwhen the unsheltered in the city outnumber the available bed \nspaces.”  Id.  The city’s enforcement policy—as a mere \n“statement of administrative policy”—was insufficient to \n“forestall the Plaintiffs’ ultimate likelihood of success on the \nmerits.”  Id. (quoting Martin, 920 F.3d at 607).  \n3.    Santa  Barbara  adopted  a  half-measure:  a \ngeographically- and time-limited ban against public sleeping \nthat applied only in the city’s downtown area.  Boring v. \nMurillo, No. CV-21-07305, 2022 WL 14740244, at *1 (C.D. \nCal. Aug. 11, 2022).  Despite the ordinance’s modest scope, \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 148 of 155\n148  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nthe district court still held that the plaintiffs stated a plausible \nclaim to relief pursuant to Martin and denied the city’s \nmotion to dismiss.  See id. at *5–6.    \n4.  Sacramento found itself subject to a lawsuit after \ntaking the innocuous step of removing a portable toilet from \ncity-owned property.  Mahoney v. City of Sacramento, No. \n2:20-cv-00258-KJM, 2020 WL 616302, at *1 (E.D. Cal. \nFeb. 10, 2020).  Though the court ultimately declined to \nissue a temporary restraining order because the plaintiffs’ \nclaims failed on factual grounds, it still interpreted Martin to \ncover  public  urination  and  defecation  prosecutions  and \nstated that “the City may not prosecute or otherwise penalize \nthe plaintiffs . . . for eliminating in public if there is no \nalternative to doing so.”  Id. at *3. \nJudges  Gould  and  Silver  argue  this  “brief  statement \nmade in the context of resolving an emergency motion is not \na solid foundation” on which to suggest that the enforcement \nof public defecation and urination laws may well be suspect \npursuant to our court’s precedent.  In their view, that is \nbecause  Martin  and  Grants  Pass  did  not  involve  a \n“challenge to any public urination or defecation ordinances.”  \nBut  our  decisions  are  not  good-for-one-ride-only  tickets \nforever bound to their specific facts; they serve as precedent \nto which parties analogize in related situations.  Martin \nattempted to limit its reach by explaining that sleep is a “life-\nsustaining activit[y].”  Martin, 920 F.3d at 617.  In their \nconcurrence,  Judges  Gould  and  Silver  offer  a  slightly \ndifferent version of that limiting principle—that sleep is an \n“identifiable  human  need[].”    But  “[w]hat  else  is  [an \nidentifiable  human  need]?    Surely  bodily  functions.”  \nMartin, 920 F.3d at 596 (M. Smith, J., dissenting from denial \nof rehearing en banc).  It is not a slippery-slope fallacy to \nnote a realistic consequence that flows directly from Martin \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 149 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    149 \nand Grants Pass’s reasoning.  Moreover, Judges Gould and \nSilver fail to recognize that something is fundamentally \namiss with our precedent if a city, even if it ultimately \nprevails, must first go to court before it can remove a toilet \nfrom property it owns. \n5.  Chico “constructed an outdoor temporary shelter \nfacility at the Chico Municipal Airport that accommodate[d] \nall 571 of the City’s homeless persons.”  Warren v. City of \nChico, No. 2:21-CV-00640-MCE, 2021 WL 2894648, at *3 \n(E.D. Cal. July 8, 2021).  But the district court cited stray \nlines in Martin in addition to Merriam-Webster’s definition \nof  “shelter,”  conducted  a  single  paragraph  of  analysis, \nconcluded  that  the  airport  shelter  was  not  Martin-type \nshelter, and subsequently enjoined Chico from enforcing its \nanti-camping laws  against “homeless persons in violation.”  \nId. at *3–4.   \nAs the district court itself recognized, this decision (as \nwell  as  the  others  above)  shows  that,  while  the  Martin \nanalysis may be “straight-forward . . . [as] to the facts of [a] \ncase,” the “practical ramifications for the community are \nmuch more complex” and the “concerns raised in the dissent \nfrom the denial of rehearing en banc appear to have come to \nfruition.”  Id. at *4 n.4 (citation omitted).  As I feared, our \ncase law has “prohibit[ed] local governments from fulfilling \ntheir duty to enforce an array of public health and safety \nlaws,” and the “[h]alting [of] enforcement of such laws” has \n“wreak[ed] havoc on our communities.”  Martin, 920 F.3d \nat 594 (M. Smith, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en \nbanc). \n* * * \nI respect the good intentions of my colleagues on the \nMartin panel and in the Grants Pass majority.  But Martin, \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 150 of 155\n150  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nparticularly now that it has been supercharged by Grants \nPass, has proven to be a runaway train that has derailed and \ndone substantial collateral damage to the governmental units \nin which it has been applied and those living therein.  These \ncases  use  a  misreading  of  Supreme  Court  precedent  to \nrequire  unelected  federal  judges—often  on  the  basis  of \nsloppy, mixed preliminary-injunction records—to act more \nlike homelessness policy czars than as Article III judges \napplying a discernible rule of law.  I respectfully dissent \nfrom our court’s decision not to rehear Grants Pass en banc. \n \n \nCOLLINS,  Circuit  Judge,  dissenting  from  the  denial  of \nrehearing en banc: \n \nIn my dissent as a member of the panel in this case, I \nexplained that: \n•  Martin v. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584 (9th Cir. 2019), \nis  a  “deeply  flawed”  decision  that  “seriously \nmisconstrued  the  Eighth  Amendment  and  the \nSupreme Court’s caselaw construing it”;  \n•  Even if Martin were correct in its Eighth Amendment \nholding, the panel majority’s decision in Johnson \n“greatly expands Martin’s holding” in a way that is \n“egregiously wrong”; and  \n•  The  panel  majority’s  decision  “make[s]  things \nworse”  by  “combin[ing]  its  gross  misreading  of \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 151 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    151 \nMartin with a flagrant disregard of settled class-\ncertification principles.” \nSee Johnson v. City of Grants Pass, 50 F.4th 787, 814 & n.1 \n(9th  Cir.  2022)  (Collins,  J.,  dissenting).    In  its  “joint \nstatement regarding denial of rehearing,” the panel majority \ntoday recycles many of the flawed arguments in its opinion.  \nI have already explained in my dissent why those arguments \nare wrong.  See id. at 823–31.  The statement of Judge \nO’Scannlain respecting the denial of rehearing en banc and \nParts I and II of Judge M. Smith’s dissent from the denial of \nrehearing en banc—which I join—further cogently explain \nthe multiple serious errors in the panel majority’s opinion.  I \nwill not repeat all of what has already been said, but I think \nthat two points are worth underscoring in response to the \npanel majority’s statement regarding the denial of rehearing. \nFirst,  the  panel  majority’s  statement  confirms  and \nillustrates the layers of self-contradiction that underlie its \nopinion in this case.   \nThe panel majority continues implausibly to insist that \nits  opinion  is  “strictly  limited  to  enforcement  of  the \nordinances against ‘involuntarily’ homeless persons,” which \nwould  suggest—as  Martin  itself  suggested—an \nindividualized case-specific inquiry.  See Panel Majority \nStatement at 94.  But the panel majority also continues to \ninsist  that  the  class  was  properly  certified  because  any \nindividualized  issues  concerning  involuntariness  were \nmoved  into  the  class  definition.    See  Panel  Majority \nStatement at 99–101.  As I have explained, that “artifice” \nignores the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23, because it “rel[ies] on a fail-safe class definition that \nimproperly subsumes this crucial individualized merits issue \ninto the class definition.”  50  F.4th at 827 (Collins, J., \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 152 of 155\n152  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \ndissenting).  The panel majority tries to wave away the \nproblem as merely one of “individualized determinations to \nidentify class members,” arguing that what it did in this case \nis no different than asking whether, for example, a given \nclass member resides in a particular State or performs a \ngiven job for a company.  See Panel Majority Statement at \n101 (emphasis added).  But in sharp contrast to the simple \nfactual  inquiries  in  the  panel  majority’s  examples,  its \nstandard for “identifying” class members here—i.e., whether \na given plaintiff’s homelessness is involuntary under all of \nthe circumstances—is the central merits issue in the case \nunder a correct reading of Martin.  Thus, under the faulty \nclass action upheld by the panel majority, if a particular \nperson’s  individual  circumstances  confirm  that  his \nhomelessness is not “involuntary” in the sense that Martin \nrequires, then his Eighth Amendment claim under Martin \nfails on the merits—and he is then defined out of the class.  \nBut  if  his  homelessness  is  involuntary  under  Martin’s \nstandards, then (under that decision’s reading of the Eighth \nAmendment) his Martin claim is a winner—and he remains \nin the class.  The result is a classic fail-safe class: each “class \nmember either wins or, by virtue of losing, is defined out of \nthe class.”  Olean Wholesale Grocery Coop. v. Bumble Bee \nFoods, 31 F.4th 651, 669–70 n.14 (9th Cir. 2022) (en banc) \n(citation omitted).   \nUnderlying all of this is a fundamental inconsistency \nbetween  the  various  propositions  endorsed  by  the  panel \nmajority’s opinion.  As I stated in my panel dissent, “the \nmajority cannot have it both ways: either the class definition \nis co-extensive with Martin’s involuntariness concept (in \nwhich case the class is an improper fail-safe class) or the \nclass definition differs from the Martin standard (in which \ncase  Martin’s  individualized  inquiry  requires \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 153 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    153 \ndecertification).”    50  F.4th  at  827–28  (Collins,  J., \ndissenting).    Nothing  in  the  panel  majority’s  statement \nresolves  these  internal  contradictions,  which  plague  its \ndeeply flawed opinion. \nSecond, I cannot let pass without comment the panel \nmajority’s contention that a newly enacted Oregon statute \nregulating the application of local ordinances to homeless \nindividuals provides “yet another reason why it was wise to \nnot rehear” this case en banc.  See Panel Majority Statement \nat 112–13 n.7.  Even assuming that this statute will require \nthat  city  laws  such  as  those  challenged  here  must  be \n“objectively reasonable as to time, place and manner with \nregards to persons experiencing homelessness,” under “the \ntotality  of  the  circumstances,”  see  Or.  Rev.  Stat. \n§ 195.530(2),  (5),  the  removal  of  the  objectively \nunreasonable constitutional straitjacket wrongly imposed by \nMartin and Johnson would continue to alter the outcome of \nthis  case  and  would  also  greatly  improve  the  cogency, \ncoherence,  and  correctness  of  Eighth  Amendment \njurisprudence in this circuit.  The panel majority is quite \nwrong in suggesting that this statute provides any grounds \nfor looking the other way and allowing Martin’s cancer on \nour jurisprudence to continue to metastasize. \nI reiterate what I said in the conclusion of my panel \ndissent, which is that both Martin and Johnson “should be \noverturned or overruled at the earliest opportunity, either by \nthis court sitting en banc or by the U.S. Supreme Court.”  50 \nF.4th at 831 (Collins, J., dissenting).  By denying rehearing \nen banc today, we have regrettably failed to overrule Martin \nand Johnson.  I again emphatically dissent. \n \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 154 of 155\n154  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS \nBRESS, Circuit Judge, joined by CALLAHAN, M. SMITH, \nIKUTA, BENNETT, R. NELSON, MILLER, BADE, LEE, \nFORREST, BUMATAY, and VANDYKE, Circuit Judges, \ndissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc: \n \nLooking  out  the  windows  of  the  Ninth  Circuit’s \ncourthouse in San Francisco, one sees the most difficult \nproblems  plaguing  big-city  America  on  display.  \nHomelessness, drug addiction, barely concealed narcotics \ndealing, severe mental health impairment, the post-COVID \nhollowing out of our business districts.  These problems of \ndisrespect for the law, human suffering, and urban decline \nwould seem connected, the result of a complex interaction of \nforces that defies any easy solution. \nBut on top of everything that our localities must now \ncontend with, our court has injected itself into the mix by \ndeploying the Eighth Amendment to impose sharp limits on \nwhat local governments can do about the pressing problem \nof homelessness—a problem now so often related to every \nother in our great cities.  With no mooring in the text of the \nConstitution, our history and traditions, or the precedent of \nthe Supreme Court, we have taken our national founding \ndocument and used it to enact judge-made rules governing \nwho can sit and sleep where, rules whose ill effects are felt \nnot merely by the States, and not merely by our cities, but \nblock by block, building by building, doorway by doorway.  \nThe  antecedent  question  we  must  always  ask  when \ninterpreting the Constitution is whether a matter has been \nentrusted, in the first instance, to the courts or to the people.  \nThe answer to that question here is clear: we must allow local \nleaders—and the people who elect them—the latitude to \naddress on the ground the distinctly local features of the \npresent  crisis  of  homelessness  and  lack  of  affordable \n\nCase: 20-35752, 07/05/2023, ID: 12748825, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 155 of 155\n  JOHNSON V. CITY OF GRANTS PASS    155 \nhousing.  And we must preserve for our localities the ability \nto make tough policy choices unobstructed by court-created \nmandates that lack any sound basis in law.  The expanding \nconstitutional common law our court is fashioning in this \narea  adds  enormous  and  unjustified  complication  to  an \nalready extremely complicated set of circumstances. \nNot  every  challenge  we  face  is  constitutional  in \ncharacter.  Not every problem in our country has a legal \nanswer  that  judges  can  provide.    This  is  one  of  those \nsituations.  The decision in Johnson v. City of Grants Pass, \n50 F.4th 787 (9th Cir. 2022), and our decision in Martin v. \nCity  of  Boise,  920  F.3d  584  (9th  Cir.  2019),  on  which \nJohnson is premised, are clearly wrong and should have been \noverruled.  I respectfully dissent from the denial of rehearing \nen banc. ",
