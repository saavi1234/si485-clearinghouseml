    "summary": "<p>This is a lawsuit challenging solitary confinement conditions for individuals on death row in the United States Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. When this suit was filed, the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute operated the only unit in the United States Bureau of Prisons that exclusively held men sentenced to death by federal courts. Referred to as the Special Confinement Unit, individuals incarcerated in the unit were only permitted to leave their single cells a few hours each week. Even when allowed to leave, they were generally denied congregate interactions.</p>\r\n<p>On January 12, 2023, one individual imprisoned in the Special Confinement Unit filed a putative class action suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons in her official capacity; the Federal Bureau of Prisons; the Warden of the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana in his official and individual capacity; a previous Warden of the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana in his individual capacity; and the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute. Represented by the ACLU and private counsel, the plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys&rsquo; fees. The case was assigned to District Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff alleged that the solitary confinement conditions in the Special Confinement Unit violated the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. According to the complaint, individuals incarcerated in the Special Confinement Unit were generally confined at all times to their cells, which contained a table, a stool, a metal sink, a toilet unit, a shower, and a slit-like window they could not open. Individuals with &ldquo;Phase I&rdquo; status were permitted to leave their cells for solitary recreation one hour a day for five days a week in either a small indoor area with exercise equipment or in individual outdoor recreation cages with a basketball net. When granted &ldquo;Phase II&rdquo; status, the plaintiff alleged they were permitted to engage in the one recreational hour with one other assigned individual. They were also permitted to meet with the assigned individual two days a week for ninety minutes in a small leisure room with books, hot water, and a television. If one&rsquo;s assigned individual refused to go to the recreation or leisure room, one would have solitary recreation or go to the leisure room alone. The plaintiff claimed that recreation and leisure room visits for individuals in &ldquo;Phase II&rdquo; were often canceled and never rescheduled.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>According to the complaint, they were also permitted to leave their cells one hour a day for solitary time in a small room with a computer terminal. Additionally, they could occasionally use another area with six cages for religious services, with the incarcerated individuals locked into each cage individually while a religious leader remained outside of the cages. According to a <a href=\"https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2017/e1705.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> from the Office of the Inspector General, individuals incarcerated remained in &ldquo;Phase I&rdquo; for at least one year and up to an indefinite period of time.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff sued on his own behalf and on behalf of a class of &ldquo;all current and future prisoners confined to death row, currently known as the Special Confinement Unit, at the United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute, Indiana.&rdquo; The plaintiff sued for declaratory relief that the defendants violated the Eighth Amendment. The plaintiff also sued under <em>Ex Parte Young</em> for injunctive relief that would allow the plaintiff and the putative class to leave their cells for multiple hours a day and to partake in congregate activities. Under <em>Bivens</em>, the plaintiff sued for individual damages to compensate for the violation of his constitutional rights and the suffering of physical and emotional injuries. The plaintiff also sued for his costs and attorneys&rsquo; fees.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 17, 2023, the court stayed the case for 21 days pending screening of the complaint. On March 27, 2023, the court issued a brief order finding that the plaintiff had made out viable Eighth Amendment claims for money damages against the defendants in their individual capacities and for injunctive and declaratory relief against the defendants in their official capacities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 4, 2023, the case was reassigned to District Judge Matthew P. Brookman, possibly for workload reasons.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of April 13, 2023, this case was ongoing.</p>",

The United States Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana (“USP Terre Haute”) is the \nsite of the federal execution chamber. Although a few federal prisoners sentenced to \ndeath are housed elsewhere, USP Terre Haute contains the only unit in the United States \nBureau of Prisons dedicated exclusively for male prisoners sentenced to death by federal \ncourts. At the current time there are approximately 38 male prisoners confined in USP \nTerre Haute’s death row, referred to as the Special Confinement Unit (“SCU”). Jurijus \n[1] \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00022-JMS-MKK   Document 1   Filed 01/12/23   Page 2 of 13 PageID #: 2\nKadamovas has been housed in the SCU since 2007, having been sentenced that year to \ndeath. \n2.  Mr. Kadamovas and the other prisoners in the SCU are held in severely isolating \nand solitary conditions. They are restricted to their single cells except for a few hours each \nweek. The only relief from this isolation is limited solitary recreation for “Phase I” \nprisoners, and brief periods of time when “Phase II” prisoners can interact with one other \nprisoner. For all prisoners, this unrelenting solitary confinement will last the entirety of \ntheir stay in the SCU—that is, for many of them, until they die.  \n3.  It is well recognized by both numerous cases and mental health experts that this \nform of isolated confinement imposed on prisoners causes severe psychological and \nemotional  harm  that  is  unwarranted.  Defendants  are  well  aware  that  the  solitary \nconfinement used in the SCU creates a substantial risk of this harm and does in fact cause \nthis harm, but they allow the conditions to continue. \n4.  Beyond that, numerous international treaties and other instruments outlaw the use \nof prolonged solitary confinement or otherwise recognize its severe harm, including the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention Against Torture, \nand the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (otherwise known as \nthe “Nelson Mandela Rules”). \n5.  The conditions of confinement of Mr. Kadamovas and the other prisoners in the \nSCU at USP Terre Haute violate the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n[2] \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00022-JMS-MKK   Document 1   Filed 01/12/23   Page 3 of 13 PageID #: 3\nPlaintiff requests the issuance of appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief on his own \nbehalf  and  on  behalf  of  a  class  consisting  of  all  SCU  prisoners.  Additionally,  Mr. \nKadamovas requests his individual damages to compensate for the violation of his \nconstitutional rights and the physical, emotional and other injuries that he has suffered. \nJurisdiction, venue, cause of action \n6.  This Court has jurisdiction of this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1346. \n7.  Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391. \n8.  Declaratory relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202 and by Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 57. \n9.  This action is brought pursuant to the Eighth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution. Damages are authorized by Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 \nU.S. 388 (1971). \nParties \n10.  Jurijus Kadamovas is an adult person confined to the SCU at USP Terre Haute. He \nis not a U.S. citizen.  \n11.  The Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons is the duly appointed head of the \nagency and is sued in her official capacity pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n17(d). \n12.  Steven Kallis is the current Warden of the United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute, \nIndiana, where the SCU is located. He is sued in his individual and official capacities. \n[3] \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00022-JMS-MKK   Document 1   Filed 01/12/23   Page 4 of 13 PageID #: 4\n \n13.  Thomas J. Watson is a past Warden of the United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute, \nIndiana. He is sued in his individual capacity. \nClass action allegations \n14.  This action is brought by Plaintiff on his own behalf and on behalf of a class of \nthose similarly situated pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure.  \n15.  The class is defined as: \nall current and future prisoners confined to death row, currently known as \nthe  Special  Confinement  Unit,  at  the  United  States  Penitentiary,  Terre \nHaute, Indiana. \n \n16.  As defined, the class meets all the requirements of Rule 23(a) of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure. Specifically: \na.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. It is \nbelieved that the SCU currently contains 38 persons. \n \nb.  There  are  questions  of  law  or  fact  common  to  the  class:  whether  the \nconditions of isolated confinement imposed on all SCU prisoners violates \nthe Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n \nc.  The claims of Mr. Kadamovas are typical of those of the class. \n \nd.  Mr. Kadamovas will fairly and adequately represent the class. \n \n17.  The further requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) are met with regard to the class as at all \ntimes defendants have acted and have refused to act on grounds that apply generally to \n[4] \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00022-JMS-MKK   Document 1   Filed 01/12/23   Page 5 of 13 PageID #: 5\nthe  class,  thereby  making  final  injunctive  and  corresponding  declaratory  relief \nappropriate with respect to the class as a whole. \n18.  Undersigned  counsel  are  appropriate  persons  to  be  appointed  class  counsel \npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(g). \nFacts \n  The SCU at USP Terre Haute \n19.  In the 1990s, the United States designated USP Terre Haute as the site where \nfederal prisoners sentenced to death would be executed. \n20.  The SCU, the living unit where most federal prisoners sentenced to death are \nhoused, was opened in 1999. \n21.  The Warden of USP Terre Haute exercises control of the SCU and the conditions \nthere.  \n22.  At the current time, the SCU houses approximately 38 prisoners, all of whom have \nbeen sentenced to death. \n23.  Prisoners are housed in individual cells that are approximately 152” x 84” (i.e., \n12.67’ x 7’).  \n24.  The cells have solid walls and a solid door with a small window. The door contains \na cuffport, a small opening that can be closed or opened from outside the cell so that \nprisoners can have handcuffs put on prior to leaving the cell and removed after returning \nto the cell. It can also be used to pass food or other items to the prisoners. \n[5] \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00022-JMS-MKK   Document 1   Filed 01/12/23   Page 6 of 13 PageID #: 6\n25.  Each cell has a small, slit-like window to the outside. The window may not be \nopened. \n26.  Each cell contains a table and stool affixed to the floor, a metal sink/toilet unit, and \na shower.  \n27.  Prisoners are not provided regular out-of-cell programming and are generally \nconfined to their cells at all times. \n28.  All meals are eaten in the cells.  \n29.  Prisoners are not removed for showers as there are showers in each cell. \n30.  SCU prisoners in “Phase I” are allowed out of their cells for solitary recreation five \ndays a week for one hour each day, with an allowed expanded recreation time of two \nhours one of those days. The recreation takes place either in a small indoor area where \nthere is some exercise equipment or in individual outdoor recreation cages, each one of \nwhich contains a basketball net.  \n31.  When prisoners are granted “Phase II” status, they are allowed to participate in \nthe above recreation opportunities with one other assigned prisoner. They are also \nallowed to meet with that assigned prisoner two days a week for 90 minutes in the \n“leisure room,” a small room in the SCU that contains books, hot water to make drinks, \nand a television.  \n[6] \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00022-JMS-MKK   Document 1   Filed 01/12/23   Page 7 of 13 PageID #: 7\n32.  Phase II prisoners must go to recreation and the “leisure room” with the same \nprisoner. If that prisoner refuses, the prisoners will have solitary recreation and will be \nalone in the “leisure room” if they choose to go. \n33.  Prisoners may also be allowed out of their cells, one hour a day, to use the “law \nlibrary” on the SCU, which is one of five small rooms containing a computer terminal.  \n34.  Only one prisoner at a time is allowed in each of the “law library” rooms. \n35.  There is also one area in the SCU with six cages that prisoners may occasionally \nuse for religious services. The prisoners are locked into each cage individually and an \noutside religious leader will stay in the open area outside of the cages. \n36.  Of the 38 prisoners on the SCU, only three have jobs on the unit.  \n37.  Other than the recreation provided to all prisoners, the time provided in the \n“leisure room” for Phase II prisoners, and any law library or religious service time, the \nprisoners who do not have jobs on the SCU are confined to their cells. There is no \ncongregate programming, either structured or unstructured. \n38.  Recreation and “leisure room” visits for Phase II prisoners are often cancelled. \nWhen they are cancelled, they are not rescheduled. \n39.  SCU prisoners are not allowed contact visits. Instead, they are allowed only non-\ncontact visits. \n40.  While in their cells, prisoners are forced to yell to try to communicate with other \nprisoners on the unit. As a result, the unit is often quite noisy. \n[7] \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00022-JMS-MKK   Document 1   Filed 01/12/23   Page 8 of 13 PageID #: 8\n41.  Correctional officers on the SCU are supposed to make rounds to check on the \nprisoners every 30 minutes. When that occurs, there is limited to no interaction between \nthe correctional officer and the prisoners.  \n42.  A mental health professional will visit each SCU prisoner at his cell front once a \nmonth and may remove the prisoner to meet with the prisoner in a more private setting. \n43.  Prisoners in the SCU will therefore spend most of their days in complete isolation. \n44.  Aside from granting some SCU prisoners Phase II status, no attempt is made by \ndefendants to determine whether SCU prisoners pose a threat to other prisoners that \njustifies their near-total isolation. SCU prisoners are placed in these conditions solely \nbecause of their placement in the SCU, and not because of their in-prison behavior. \n  Jurijus Kadamovas \n45.  Jurijus Kadamovas was sentenced to death in 2007 by the United States District \nCourt for the Central District of California after being convicted of kidnapping and \nmurder.  \n46.  Mr. Kadamovas has been in the SCU since 2007. \n47.  Mr. Kadamovas is confined in a cell as described above. \n48.  He has been a Phase II prisoner since 2014. \n49.  As a Phase II prisoner he is afforded the opportunity to have recreation with one \nother prisoner five times a week and an opportunity to spend 90 minutes, two times a \nweek, with that prisoner in the “leisure room.” \n[8] \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00022-JMS-MKK   Document 1   Filed 01/12/23   Page 9 of 13 PageID #: 9\n50.  Recreation  and  “leisure  room”  times  are  frequently  cancelled  because  of \nlockdowns or other institutional concerns.  \n51.  Mr. Kadamovas is only able to engage in recreation with one specific prisoner.  \n52.  The prisoner with whom he has been assigned to have joint recreation or “leisure \nroom” time frequently refuses to go to recreation or to the “leisure room.” \n53.  When this occurs Mr. Kadamovas will go to recreation by himself, but on occasion, \nMr. Kadamovas refuses to go the “leisure room,” as being in the “leisure room” by \nhimself is very little different than being in his cell by himself. \n54.  Mr. Kadamovas is not regularly allowed out of his cell for any other reason.  \n55.  Every month he is visited by a mental health professional who speaks to him at \nhis  cell  front  about  his  mental  health  needs.  He  has  been  removed  from  his  cell \noccasionally to talk to the mental health professional in the past year. \n56.  Mr. Kadamovas suffers from a host of physical problems, including Crohn’s \ndisease, high-blood pressure, asthma, sleep apnea, and severe pulmonary problems. \nThese are aggravated by his conditions of confinement and cause him physical injury and \nharm. \n57.  Mr. Kadamovas recognizes that his isolated confinement in the SCU for 15 years \nhas caused him, and is causing him, severe emotional and psychological problems \nincluding depression, stress, heightened anxiety, difficulty in concentration, and memory \ndifficulties. \n[9] \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00022-JMS-MKK   Document 1   Filed 01/12/23   Page 10 of 13 PageID #: 10\n58.  Mr. Kadamovas has not been disciplined by the Bureau of Prisons for any violation \nof rules or for any other reason since 2010. \n59.  Mr. Kadamovas has fully exhausted the Bureau of Prisons’ grievance procedure \nto challenge the psychological and physical injury and harm caused by the isolated \nconditions in the SCU, but he has not been provided relief through the grievance process. \n(See Ex. 1, attached). \nConclusion \n60.  It is well known that prolonged isolation and solitary confinement can cause, and \npredictably will cause, prisoners to suffer serious emotional and psychological injuries. \n61.  These  negative  consequences  are  not  in  any  way  ameliorated  by  allowing \nprisoners out for brief recreation periods or brief periods where they can be with one \nother prisoner as is afforded to Phase II prisoners in the SCU. \n62.  While there may be circumstances where short-term solitary confinement can be \njustified  because of a prisoner’s behavior while  incarcerated, there is no legitimate \npenological justification for a blanket rule that places all SCU prisoners in isolated \nconfinement merely because they are on death row. \n63.  There is no justification for placing Mr. Kadamovas into the solitary confinement \nthat he has had to endure for 15 years in the SCU. \n[10] \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00022-JMS-MKK   Document 1   Filed 01/12/23   Page 11 of 13 PageID #: 11\n64.  Because of the nature of the SCU and the implementation of the death penalty in \nthe federal system, it is anticipated that once a prisoner is placed on the unit, he is likely \nto be there for decades.  \n65.  The risk of harm that the isolated confinement imposes on Mr. Kadamovas and \nthe putative class are obvious and well documented, and the defendants are deliberately \nindifferent to the risk of harm, and the harm being caused, to Mr. Kadamovas and the \nputative class because of the conditions of confinement in the SCU. \n66.  Mr. Kadamovas and the putative class are being caused irreparable harm for \nwhich there is no adequate remedy at law. \n67.  While Warden of USP Terre Haute, Thomas J.
