    "summary": "<p>This matter has to do with Assembly Bill A5499/Senate Bill S470 (the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;) in New York State, which passed in June 2022. The Act was one of six statutes billed as the &ldquo;nation-leading legislative package to protect abortion and reproductive rights&rdquo; by New York Governor Kathy Hochul. It authorized the state Commissioner of Health to conduct a study and issue a report examining the unmet health and resource needs facing pregnant women in New York.</p>\r\n<p>The Sisters of Life, a Roman Catholic order of religious sisters located in New York, New York, filed this lawsuit against the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health on September 2, 2022. The Sisters of Life operate a crisis pregnancy center offering resources for pregnant women at their Visitation Mission in lower Manhattan. They claimed that the Act imposed intrusive and burdensome disclosure requirements, enforced by financial penalties, in violation of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause as well as the First Amendment rights to free speech, free exercise, assembly, and association in addition to the Fourth Amendment&rsquo;s protection against unreasonable search and seizure. Sisters of Life requested that the Court declare the Act unconstitutional on its face and as it applied, and sought a permanent injunction prohibiting enforcement, as well as attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 16, 2022, Sisters of Life filed a motion for a preliminary injunction that would enjoin enforcement of the Act during the litigation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 7, 2022, the parties filed a joint request to stay the litigation while they continued to discuss scheduling matters. The Court agreed to stay the litigation until January 10, 2023. On January 18, 2023 this stay was extended until April 17, 2023 after the parties jointly filed requesting an extension of the stay period. The New York State Department of Health advised that it was continuing to make progress on implementation of the statute and needed more time to determine the scope and timing of information requests under the statute. The parties agreed that in light of this, an extension of the stay period was the most efficient course of action for the parties and for the Court.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 27, 2023 the case was reassigned to Judge Jennifer H. Rearden. The stay period was extended multiple times.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 3, 2023 the parties submitted to the court a proposed Stipulation and Order of Settlement. On November 8, 2023 the order of settlement was stipulated and agreed to. The parties agreed, and Court approved, that all claims asserted by Plaintiff were to be dismissed, with prejudice and without payments, attorney's fees, costs, disbursements, or expenses, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a). Each party agreed to bear their own attorney's fees and costs. Defendant agreed not to take any enforcement action of any kind against Plaintiff based on Plaintiff's nonresponse to or noncompliance with any survey, document request, or information request of any kind authorized by or issued by Defendant pursuant to the statute. Per the agreement, the court was to retain jurisdiction until the Defendant's authority to request data ended via the publication of he report. Judge Rearden directed that the case be closed.&nbsp;</p>",

COMPLAINT \nMARY T. BASSETT, Commissioner of the \nNew York State Department of Health,    DEMAND FOR  \nin her official capacity,  JURY TRIAL \n  Defendant. \nNATURE OF THE ACTION \n1. The Sisters of Life is a Roman Catholic order of religious sisters who dedicate\ntheir lives to God by professing vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. The Sisters \nalso take a fourth vow to protect and enhance the sacredness of human life. That vow \nbinds each Sister to the defining gift (or “charism”) of the order, which is the Sisters’ \nfundamental belief that every human being is created in the image of God. \n2. For more than 30 years, the Sisters of Life have devoted themselves to prayer,\nfasting, and service to their communities—including to women who are experiencing \ndifficult, or “crisis,” pregnancies. At their Visitation Mission in lower Manhattan, the \nSisters offer free help and resources to pregnant women. In building a relationship \nwith each woman, the Sisters seek to understand and meet the needs she expresses—\nwhether emotional, spiritual, or temporal—so that she may have the greatest free-\ndom to choose life for her child and herself.  \n3. Now that mission is under threat because the Sisters of Life do not refer for\nabortion. \n1 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 2 of 30\n \n4.  A newly-enacted New York statute (the “Act”) purports to entitle the Commis-\nsioner of the New York State Department of Health to demand and receive internal \ndocuments from “limited services pregnancy centers.” N.Y. ch. 217 § 2 (McKinney \n2023) (forthcoming). \n5.  The Act was signed into law on June 13, 2022, one of six abortion-related stat-\nutes billed as New York’s “nation-leading legislative package to protect abortion and \nreproductive rights” “in anticipation of [a] final decision by [the] Supreme Court on \nDobbs v. Jackson.” Press Release, N.Y. State Governor’s Office, Governor Hochul \nSigns  Nation-Leading  Legislative  Package  to  Protect  Abortion  and  Reproductive \nRights for All (June 13, 2022), https://perma.cc/WSD3-793N (cleaned up).  \n6.  In her speech at the signing ceremony, New York Governor Kathy Hochul re-\ncalled reading the leaked Dobbs opinion with “horror and disgust,” and decried the \npro-life “Neanderthals” who “say women are not entitled to [abortion] rights.” Gover-\nnor Kathy Hochul, Governor Hochul Signs Nation-Leading Legislative Package to \nProtect Abortion and Reproductive Rights, YouTube, at 10:30, 9:45 (June 13, 2022), \nhttps://youtu.be/wx6EXENuvL8. Her remarks on the Act were especially pointed: \n“We’re . . . going to have a task force to study the impact of limited service pregnancy \ncenters—we all know what that means—on pregnant women.” Id. at 19:45 (emphasis \nadded).  \n7.  The Act directs the Commissioner to conduct a study and issue a report about \n“limited services pregnancy centers,” defined as any facility or entity that has the \n“primary purpose of . . . provid[ing] services to clients who are or may be pregnant,” \n2 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 3 of 30\n \nthat is not a licensed health care facility or is not providing services under the direc-\ntion of a licensed health care provider, and that “fails to provide or refer for the full \nrange of comprehensive reproductive and sexual health care services reimbursed un-\nder the state’s Medicaid program including contraception, testing and treatment of \nsexually transmitted infections, abortion care, and prenatal care.” N.Y. ch. 217 §§ 1, \n1-2, 2-1 (emphases added). \n8.  The Act then provides that the Commissioner “may request, and shall receive \nupon request,” a broad range of data and information from limited services pregnancy \ncenters. That includes information related to organizational funding; membership in \numbrella organizations; services provided and most frequently sought; the number of \nwomen who access services and “basic demographic information about each woman, \nincluding race, age, and marital status”; whether women seeking services are seeking \n“comprehensive options counseling or services” at medical facilities; the nature of in-\nformation given to clients or potential clients; and operational manuals, handbooks, \nor guidelines. Id. § 2-2. \n9.  All of the Act’s intrusive and burdensome disclosure requirements turn on \nwhether an organization is willing to “refer for . . . abortion care.” N.Y. ch. 217 § 1-2. \nThat definitional trigger is plainly predicated on the content of an organization’s \nspeech; it is also plainly unconstitutional. \n10. The First Amendment violation here is “all the more blatant” because the gov-\nernment is “target[ing] . . . particular views taken by speakers on a subject”—here, \n3 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 4 of 30\n \nthe Sisters’ viewpoint on abortion. See Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of \nVa., 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995).  \n11. On July 15, 2022, the Sisters of Life, through their counsel, sent a letter to \nMary T. Bassett, Commissioner of Health at the New York State Department of \nHealth (the “Commissioner”), describing their religious ministry and explaining how \nthe Act violates the U.S. Constitution. The Sisters requested that the Commissioner \nconfirm in writing, by August 1, 2022, that the Department will not attempt to en-\nforce the Act against them.  \n12. The Commissioner and the New York State Department of Health did not re-\nspond. \n13. On August 23, 2022, the Sisters of Life, through their counsel, sent a second \nletter to Commissioner Bassett, again with a copy to General Counsel Marks. The \nletter reiterated that the Act violates the Constitution and illegally interferes with \nthe Sisters’ ministry to pregnant women, and requested a response by August 26. \n14. On August 30, counsel for the Sisters of Life received a two-sentence letter \nfrom General Counsel Marks that was postmarked August 25. The letter did not dis-\navow enforcement as to the Sisters, as they had twice requested. It instead stated \nonly that “[w]e are reviewing the enacted legislation and determining appropriate \nnext steps for implementation.” \n15. Because of the Act’s unconstitutional disclosure mandate—and because the \nCommissioner has refused to disavow its enforcement against them—the Sisters of \nLife are now forced to minister under a cloud of government investigation. Worse still, \n4 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 5 of 30\n \nthe Sisters’ relationships of trust and confidence with pregnant women are chilled by \nthe government’s claimed ability to obtain documents and information about those \nwomen and their conversations with the Sisters—all without a warrant, and without \nany individualized suspicion of wrongdoing. \n16. The Sisters of Life have dedicated their lives to loving God and neighbor. They \nsimply seek to continue their ministry without illegal interference from the govern-\nment. \n17. Because of the Act’s unconstitutional intrusion into the Sisters’ ministry, the \nSisters have suffered and will suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n18. This action arises under the Constitution and the laws of the United States. \nThis Court has subject-matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343.  \n19. The Court has authority to issue the declaratory and injunctive relief sought \nunder 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n20. Venue lies in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1) and (2). \nTHE PARTIES \n21. Plaintiff Sisters of Life is a Roman Catholic order of religious sisters who ded-\nicate their lives to God by professing vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, as well \nas a fourth vow to protect and enhance the sacredness of human life. The Sisters of \nLife is incorporated under the laws of the State of New York as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit \ncorporation. The Sisters of Life is also a religious institute of diocesan right. \n5 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 6 of 30\n \n22. Defendant Mary T. Bassett is the Commissioner of the New Yor State Depart-\nment of Health (NYDOH). She is sued in her official capacity. See Ex Parte Young, \n209 U.S. 123 (1908). \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n  The Sisters of Life \n23. The Sisters of Life is a Roman Catholic community of religious sisters who give \ntheir lives to God by professing lifetime vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. The \nSisters also profess a fourth vow to protect and enhance the sacredness of human life.  \n24. The Sisters of Life was founded in 1991, after Cardinal John O’Connor penned \nan article in the local newspaper Catholic New York entitled, “Help Wanted: Sisters \nof Life.” In the article, the Cardinal described his vision for a religious community of \nwomen who would give themselves fully to the protection and enhancement of the \nsacredness of every human life, beginning with the most vulnerable. The article was \nreprinted across the country, and hundreds of letters poured in. On June 1, 1991, \neight women gathered in New York to form the Sisters of Life. \n25. The Sisters of Life today number more than 100 religious sisters serving in \nNew York, Arizona, Connecticut, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Washington, DC, and To-\nronto, Canada. In New York State, the Sisters pray and work at their convents in \nCatskill, New York City, Suffern, and Yonkers.  \n26. The purpose of the Sisters of Life is to worship the living God. The Sisters \nprovide a consecrated witness to the glory of God, who is the origin of every human \nlife. Like other Catholic religious sisters, they forgo marriage, renounce worldly pos-\nsessions, and willingly surrender to lives of obedience to Jesus Christ. The Sisters \n6 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 7 of 30\n \nfurther consecrate themselves to the protection of human life and the promotion of \nnew life in Jesus Christ. To guide their religious commitments, the Sisters of Life \nfollow the ethical teachings of the Catholic Church. \n27. The Sisters of Life believe that all human life is sacred, and that every human \nbeing is made in the image and likeness of God. The Sisters accordingly bear witness \nto the dignity of every human life, including the most vulnerable lives, such as the \nelderly, the disabled, and the unborn.  \n28. The Sisters’ primary work is prayer and fasting, which require an intense at-\ntentiveness to God and occupy many hours of each day. Because love seeks the good \nof the other, the love the Sisters receive from God in prayer must find expression. \nThus, the Sisters also spend significant time actively serving their communities.  \n29. In addition to evangelization, hosting weekend retreats, and conducting out-\nreach to college students, the Sisters’ missions include serving pregnant women in \nneed by giving them the support and resources to be able to choose life for themselves \nand their children. All of these activities are rooted in the Sisters’ fourth vow to up-\nhold the dignity and worth of each person. \n30. One such work is the Sisters’ Visitation Mission, named after the Gospel ac-\ncount in which Mary, the Mother of Jesus, visits and assists her elderly cousin Eliz-\nabeth during a difficult pregnancy. The Visitation Mission, located at St. Andrew’s \nChurch in lower Manhattan, is where the Sisters take Mary as their model and offer \naccompaniment to women during their difficult, or “crisis,” pregnancies.  \n7 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 8 of 30\n \n31. At the Visitation Mission, the Sisters listen to a pregnant woman’s hopes and \nfears surrounding her future with a new child. In building relationship, the Sisters \nendeavor to meet the needs the woman expresses—whether emotional, spiritual, or \ntemporal—so that she may have the greatest freedom to choose life for her child and \nherself. The Sisters are able to meet these needs through a network of volunteers who \ndesire to help the pregnant women who come into the Sisters’ lives.  \n32. The Sisters of Life provide pregnant women with housing, food, maternity \nclothes, baby clothes, diapers, and formula, as well as strollers, cribs, car seats, and \ncountless items a mother may need to care for her family. They also connect pregnant \nwomen and their children to pro bono medical and legal services and a wide array of \nsocial services, including child educational opportunities, daycare, and services for \nspecial needs.  \n33. In addition to providing material support, the Sisters of Life attend to the \nwoman’s emotional and spiritual needs and assist her in developing a plan for her \nfuture, including by providing help with school applications, job training, language \nlearning, budgeting, and parenting skills.  \n34. Each year, women reside with the Sisters during pregnancy, childbirth, and \nfor up to six months after the infant’s birth. \n35. The Sisters of Life offer personal, holistic help for pregnant women in need. \nThat help is rooted in the Sisters’ deep love for human life. \n36. The Sisters of Life provide all resources and services free of charge. \n37. The Sisters of Life gladly serve pregnant women of all religions and no religion.  \n8 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 9 of 30\n \n38. The Sisters of Life serve many pregnant women who are in economic need or \nrelational crisis or both. Many of these women are vulnerable to domestic violence. \nMany are undocumented and live in fear of encountering the police or other govern-\nment officials. Many come to the Sisters in search of a safe haven. \n39. Building relationships of trust and confidence with pregnant women is a core \ncomponent of the Sisters’ ministry. Many of these women disclose sensitive infor-\nmation about their lives, their needs, and their hopes for the future precisely because \nthey trust the Sisters to hold that information in confidence. \n40. Many of these women choose to stay in relationship with the Sisters for years—\nsometimes decades—as the Sisters become a second home and stable presence that \nthey can turn to throughout their lives. \n41. The Sisters of Life operate in accordance with Catholic religious teachings, in-\ncluding Catholic teachings on abortion, contraception, and sterilization. \n42. Section 2270 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that life begins \nat conception. It states:  \nHuman life must be respected and protected absolutely from the mo-\nment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human \nbeing must be recognized as having the rights of a person—among which \nis the inviolable right of every innocent being to life. \n43. Thus, the Catholic Church teaches that abortion is “gravely contrary to moral \nlaw.” Section 2271 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church provides:  \nSince the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every \nprocured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains un-\nchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an \nend or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law.  \n9 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 10 of 30\n \n44. Consistent with Catholic Church teaching, the Sisters of Life do not provide or \nrefer for abortion, contraception, or sterilization.  \n45. Given that the Sisters always work within a woman’s free will to make deci-\nsions for her life, some women served by the Sisters of Life in the Visitation Mission \nchoose to terminate their pregnancies by abortion. In fact, many of the women who \nseek the Sisters’ support have already experienced at least one or more abortions \nprior to their current pregnancy.   \n46. Even if a woman chooses abortion, the Sisters’ commitment to love and serve \nher endures. Many women turn to the Sisters for assistance after an abortion. The \nSisters meet with these women individually and host Days of Prayer and Healing, \nmonthly gatherings, and retreats that offer a safe and non-judgmental environment \nto encounter the mercy of Jesus Christ. \n47. Consistent with their lifetime vows, the Sisters of Life intend to continue en-\ngaging in substantially similar conduct going forward. \nAssembly Bill A5499 / Senate Bill S470 \n48. On June 13, 2022, Governor Kathy Hochul signed into law Assembly Bill \nA5499 / Senate Bill S470. The Act was one of six statutes billed as the “nation-leading \nlegislative package to protect abortion and reproductive rights” “in anticipation of [a] \nfinal decision by [the] Supreme Court on Dobbs v. Jackson.” Press Release, New York \nState Governor’s Office, Governor Hochul Signs Nation-Leading Legislative Package \nto  Protect  Abortion  and  Reproductive  Rights  for  All  (June  13,  2022), \nhttps://perma.cc/WSD3-793N (cleaned up). \n10 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 11 of 30\n \n49. The Act authorizes the New York Commissioner of Health to conduct a study \non “the unmet health and resource needs facing pregnant women in New York” and \n“the impact of limited service pregnancy centers on the ability of women to obtain \naccurate, non-coercive health care information and timely access to a comprehensive \nrange of reproductive and sexual health care services.” N.Y. ch. 217 § 2-1.  \n50. The Act defines a “limited services pregnancy center” as a facility or entity that \nhas the “primary purpose of . . . provid[ing] services to clients who are or may be preg-\nnant,” that is not a licensed health care facility or is not providing services under the \ndirection of a licensed health care provider, and that “fails to provide or refer for the \nfull range of comprehensive reproductive and sexual health care services reimbursed \nunder the state’s Medicaid program including, but not limited to contraception, test-\ning and treatment of sexually transmitted infections, abortion care, and prenatal \ncare.” Id. § 1, 1-2. \n51. The Act then provides that the Commissioner “may request, and shall receive \nupon request,” a broad range of “data and information” from limited services preg-\nnancy centers. Id. § 2-2. That data and information “shall include but not be limited \nto” information related to: organizational funding; membership in umbrella organi-\nzations; services provided and most frequently sought; the number of women who \naccess services, the geographic regions in which each woman resides, and “basic de-\nmographic information about each woman, including race, age, and marital status”1; \n \n1 The Act provides that “[b]asic demographic information included in any report shall be published in \nthe aggregate”—but it requires that information to be disclosed as to “each woman.” N.Y. ch. 217 § 2-\n2(d) (emphases added).  \n11 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 12 of 30\n \nwhether centers advertise as medical facilities; whether women seeking services are \nseeking “comprehensive options counseling or services” at medical facilities; whether \ncenters enroll women in public benefits programs or connect them to other services; \nthe nature of information given to clients or potential clients; and operational manu-\nals, handbooks, or guidelines. Id. \n52. The Act purports to require all limited services pregnancy centers to turn over \nthis body of information upon the Commissioner’s request without a warrant and \nwithout any reason to suspect that the organization is violating any law. \n53. The Act further directs the Commissioner to establish a taskforce of nine mem-\nbers to support the NYDOH in the development of the study, the review of its find-\nings, and the establishment of specific recommendations for “solutions to address any \nservice gaps . . . identified through the study.” Id. § 3. \n54. The study is required to commence no later than six months following the Act’s \neffective date. Id. No later than 18 months following the Act’s effective date, the Com-\nmissioner must issue a report containing findings and policy recommendations. Id. \n55. Although the Act does not address penalties for noncompliance, Section 206 of \nthe New York Public Health Law authorizes the Commissioner to assess penalties up \nto $2,000 “for a violation of or a failure to comply with any term or provision of this \nchapter.” N.Y. Pub. Health L. § 206.  \n56. The Act thus imposes intrusive and burdensome disclosure requirements—en-\nforced by financial penalties—based on whether an organization is willing to “refer \n12 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 13 of 30\n \nfor . . . abortion care.” N.Y. ch. 217 § 1-2. That definitional trigger is plainly predi-\ncated on the content of an organization’s speech. It is also plainly unconstitutional. \n57. The First Amendment violation here is “all the more blatant” because the gov-\nernment is “target[ing] . . . particular views taken by speakers on a subject”—here, \nthe Sisters’ viewpoint on abortion. See Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 829.  \n58. The Act’s legislative record is rife with evidence of content and viewpoint dis-\ncrimination. The sponsor memos for both Senate and Assembly versions of the bill \nassert that pregnancy centers “engage in misleading or deceptive practices” and “pro-\nvide inaccurate, misleading, or stigmatizing information about abortion and contra-\nception.”  Memorandum  from  the  New  York  State  Assembly  on  A05499, \nhttps://perma.cc/P42Z-63U7. The Act’s legislative supporters put forward similar \nclaims during floor debates. See, e.g., New York State Assembly Floor Debates at 112 \n(Apr. 4, 2022), https://perma.cc/3ZBG-6HMM (suggesting limited services pregnancy \ncenters “purport[] to provide a medical service” to pregnant women but instead “pro-\nvide[] them religious counseling”); New York State Senate Floor Debates at 4407 \n(May 31, 2022), https://perma.cc/6ETC-7ECG (Senate sponsor explaining that the Act \nwould not apply to abortion clinics even if they do not offer “a full spectrum of coun-\nseling services, like alternatives to abortion”).  \n59. Floor debates on an earlier version of the Act were even more explicit. For ex-\nample, one legislative supporter urged that pregnancy centers need to be regulated \nbecause “the religious ideology of these centers’ owners and employees takes priority \nover the health and well-being of the women seeking care.” New York State Assembly \n13 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 14 of 30\n \nFloor Debates at 170 (July 21, 2020), https://perma.cc/9J3T-46QF (citing American \nMedical Association’s Journal of Ethics). \n60. The Act also “covers a curiously narrow subset of speakers.” NIFLA v. Becerra, \n138 S. Ct. 2361, 2377 (2018). \n61. The sponsor memos justify the Act on the ground that “[d]ecisions about preg-\nnancy are time sensitive,” and “identifying gaps in health care . . . is critical to achiev-\ning optimal health outcomes for women who are or may be pregnant.” Memorandum \nfrom the New York State Assembly on A05499, https://perma.cc/P42Z-63U7.  \n62. But the Act imposes no disclosure obligations at all on organizations that pro-\nvide or refer for abortions. The Act’s structure thus evinces a design whereby “‘the \nState has left unburdened those speakers whose messages are in accord with its own \nviews.’” NIFLA, 138 S. Ct. at 2378 (quoting Sorrell v. IMS Health, Inc., 564 U.S. 552, \n580 (2011)). \n63. The signing ceremony that accompanied the Act’s passage leaves no doubt \nabout what messages “are in accord with [the State’s] own views.” See id. During the \n40-minute program that preceded the signing, Governor Hochul, Senate Majority \nLeader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, and Commissioner \nBassett each addressed the assembled crowd.  \n64. Governor Hochul framed her remarks with the leaked Supreme Court opinion \nin Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, telling the crowd: “The sky is on \nthe verge of falling, literally in the next week or two. That is a very real possibility. \nAnd that’s why we’re here today.” Press Release, New York State Governor’s Office, \n14 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 15 of 30\n \nGovernor Hochul Signs Nation-Leading Legislative Package to Protect Abortion and \nReproductive  Rights,  YouTube,  at  8:20  (June  13,  2022),  available  at \nhttps://youtu.be/wx6EXENuvL8. She recalled that “millions of Americans” read the \nleaked opinion with “horror and disgust,” because “[i]t reconfirmed our worst of fears \nthat the end of Roe v. Wade was actually near.” Id. at 10:30. She decried the pro-life \n“Neanderthals” who “say women are not entitled to [abortion] rights.” Id. at 9:45. And \nshe announced that, “I have three messages on the persistent assault on women’s \nrights and a woman’s right to determine and make her own decisions about her own \nbody, and they are simple messages: Not here. Not now. Not ever.” Id. at 8:35. A \nstanding ovation ensued. \n65. Hochul briefly summarized each of the six bills before sitting down to sign \nthem. Her comment on the Act was especially telling: “We’re also going to have a task \nforce to study the impact of limited service pregnancy centers—we all know what that \nmeans—on pregnant women.” Id. at 19:45 (emphasis added).  \n66. A few minutes later, Commissioner Bassett took the podium and told the \ncrowd: “I never imagined in my lifetime that we would be in the position where we \nfully expect the Supreme Court of the United States to roll back the landmark Roe v. \nWade  decision.”  Id.  at  33:20.  She  went  on  to  declare  that,  “Here  in  New  York \nState, . . . the protection of abortion rights is enshrined in the law, and today these \nlegal rights are being bolstered. New York is and continues to be a beacon of hope, a \nsafe harbor, a sanctuary.” Id. at 34:20. \n15 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 16 of 30\n \nThe Letters \n67. The Sisters of Life is arguably an entity with the primary purpose of providing \nservices to women who are or may be pregnant. The Visitation Mission is arguably a \nfacility with the primary purpose of providing services to women who are or may be \npregnant. It is not a health care facility. It is not licensed by the state of New York \nunder article 28 of the Public Health Law or articles 31 and 32 of the Mental Hygiene \nLaw. It also does not provide services under the direction of a health care provider \nlicensed under title 8 of the Education Law.  \n68. Because the Sisters of Life cannot and do not “provide or refer for the full range \nof comprehensive reproductive . . . services” required by the State, they regularly en-\ngage and intend to continue engaging in a course of conduct that arguably subjects \nthem to the Act’s burdensome and intrusive disclosure requirements. \n69. Accordingly, on July 15, 2022, the Sisters of Life, through their counsel, sent a \nletter to Commissioner Bassett, with a copy to Kathy S. Marks, General Counsel for \nthe New York State Department of Health.  \n70. In the letter, the Sisters described their religious ministry and explained how \nthe Act violates the U.S. Constitution.  \n71. The Sisters requested that by August 1, 2022, the Commissioner and the De-\npartment of Health confirm in writing that they will not attempt to enforce the Act \nagainst the Sisters or otherwise force them to disclose their internal documents. \n72. The Commissioner and the New York State Department of Health did not re-\nspond to the Sisters’ letter. \n16 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 17 of 30\n \n73. On August 23, 2022, the Sisters of Life, through their counsel, sent a second \nletter to Commissioner Bassett, again with a copy to General Counsel Marks. The \nletter reiterated that the Act violates the Constitution and illegally interferes with \nthe Sisters’ ministry to pregnant women. It requested that the Commissioner confirm \nin writing, no later than August 26, that the Department of Health will not attempt \nto enforce the Act against the Sisters.  \n74. On August 30, counsel for the Sisters of Life received a letter from General \nCounsel Marks that was dated August 24 and postmarked August 25. The letter did \nnot disavow enforcement as to the Sisters, as they had twice requested. The text of \nthe letter is quoted below in its entirety: \nThank you for contacting us regarding A.5499/S.470, which authorizes \nthe New York State Commissioner of Health to request and receive \nbroad categories of internal information and data from “limited services \npregnancy centers”. We are reviewing the enacted legislation and deter-\nmining appropriate next steps for implementation. \n75. Because of the Act’s unconstitutional disclosure mandate—and because the \nCommissioner has failed to disavow its enforcement against them—the Sisters of Life \nare now forced to minister under a cloud of government investigation. The Sisters’ \nrelationships of trust and confidence with pregnant women are chilled by the govern-\nment’s claimed ability to obtain documents and information about those women and \ntheir conversations with the Sisters.  \n76. The harm is especially acute as to the Sisters’ relationships with undocu-\nmented and other vulnerable women, who are frequently sensitive to any risk of being \nreported to the government. By intruding on the Sisters’ confidential conversations \n17 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 18 of 30\n \nwith these women, the Act directly undermines and materially burdens the Sisters’ \nministry to these vulnerable populations. \n77. In light of these developments, the Sisters of Life have standing to challenge \nthe Act because they have alleged “an intention to engage in a course of conduct ar-\nguably affected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed by a statute,” and “a \ncredible threat of prosecution thereunder.” Silva v. Farris, -- F.4th --, No. 21-0616, \n2022 WL 3650689, at *5 (2d Cir. Aug. 25, 2022) (quoting Susan B. Anthony List v. \nDriehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 159 (2014)). \n78. The Sisters of Life have already suffered irreparable harm as a result of the \nAct’s unconstitutional disclosure requirements, and they will continue to suffer irrep-\narable harm absent timely injunctive and declaratory relief.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount I \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nViolation of U.S. Const. Amend. I: Free Speech Clause \nContent and Viewpoint Discrimination \n79. All preceding paragraphs are incorporated by reference. \n80. Laws that “target speech based on its communicative content” are “content \nbased” and “presumptively unconstitutional,” and “may be justified only if the gov-\nernment proves that they are narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests.” \nReed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 163 (2015); see also City of Austin v. Reagan \nNat’l Advert. of Austin, LLC, 142 S. Ct. 1464, 1471 (2022) (“A regulation of speech is \nfacially content based under the First Amendment if it targets speech based on its \n18 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 19 of 30\n \ncommunicative content—that is, if it applies to particular speech because of the topic \ndiscussed or the idea or message expressed.” (cleaned up)).  \n81. The Act imposes intrusive and burdensome disclosure requirements based on \nwhether an organization is willing to “refer for . . . abortion care.” N.Y. ch. 217 § 1-2. \nBecause that trigger turns on the content of an organization’s speech, the Act is con-\ntent based and presumptively unconstitutional. \n82. Defendant has no compelling interest in targeting organizations that do not \n“refer for . . . abortion care” for intrusive and burdensome disclosure requests. See id.  \n83. Defendant has not selected the least restrictive means to further any govern-\nmental interest. \n84. The First Amendment violation here is particularly “blatant” because the gov-\nernment is “target[ing] . . . particular views taken by speakers on a subject”—here, \nthe Sisters’ views on abortion, contraception, and sterilization. See Rosenberger, 515 \nU.S. at 829. The Act thus engages in viewpoint discrimination, a particularly “egre-\ngious form of content discrimination.” Id.  \n85. Governor Hochul’s “congratulatory statement[s]” boasting of New York’s “for-\nward thinking” are simply further evidence that “viewpoint discrimination is inher-\nent in the design and structure of th[e] Act.” See NIFLA, 138 S. Ct. at 2379 (Kennedy, \nJ., concurring).  \n86. The Sisters have suffered and will suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive \nand declaratory relief against Defendant.  \n19 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 20 of 30\n \nCount II \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nViolation of U.S. Const. Amend. I: Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses \nChurch Autonomy  \n87. All preceding paragraphs are incorporated by reference. \n88. Under the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment, \nreligious groups have the “power to decide for themselves, free from state interfer-\nence, matters of church government as well as those of faith and doctrine.” Kedroff v. \nSt. Nicholas Cathedral of Russian Orthodox Church in N. Am., 344 U.S. 94, 116 \n(1952). \n89. Government interference in the sphere of “faith and doctrine” “would obviously \nviolate the free exercise of religion, and any attempt by government to dictate or even \ninfluence such matters would constitute one of the central attributes of an establish-\nment of religion. The First Amendment outlaws such intrusion.” Our Lady of Guada-\nlupe Sch. v. Morrissey-Berru, 140 S. Ct. 2049, 2060 (2020). In a separate but “closely \nlinked” sphere, the First Amendment also protects the autonomy of religious organi-\nzations “with respect to internal management decisions that are essential to the in-\nstitution’s central mission.” Id. \n90. As a matter of core faith and doctrine, the Sisters do not provide or refer for \nabortion, contraception, or sterilization.  \n91. The Sisters decide all issues of internal governance consistent with their un-\nderlying religious commitment to the sanctity of human life. These include myriad \ndecisions—such as how to serve, support, and counsel pregnant women—that are es-\nsential to the Sisters’ central mission. \n20 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 21 of 30\n \n92. The Act attempts to dictate and influence the Sisters’ decisions regarding mat-\nters of faith and doctrine. It also targets and interferes with the Sisters’ internal gov-\nernance, management, and decision-making.  \n93. The Act thus violates both Religion Clauses, which guarantee the Sisters’ First \nAmendment right to decide matters of faith and doctrine, govern themselves, and \ncare for pregnant women “free from state interference.” Kedroff, 344 U.S. at 116.  \n94. The Sisters have suffered and will suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive \nand declaratory relief against Defendant.   \nCount III \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nViolation of U.S. Const. Amend. I: Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses \nChurch Autonomy: Improper Investigation \n95. All preceding paragraphs are incorporated by reference. \n96. Under the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment, \nthe government may not engage in entangling investigations into religious matters, \nsince the “very process of inquiry” can “impinge on rights guaranteed by the Religion \nClauses.” NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chi., 440 U.S. 490, 502 (1979). \n97. Church autonomy thus forbids the “forced disclosure” of a religious organiza-\ntion’s “internal communications.” See Whole Woman’s Health v. Smith, 896 F.3d 362, \n374 (5th Cir. 2018). The use of governmental power to pry into a religious organiza-\ntion’s internal affairs not only interferes with its “decision-making processes,” but \nalso “exposes those processes to an opponent and will induce similar ongoing intru-\nsions against religious bodies’ self-government.” Id. at 373. \n21 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 22 of 30\n \n98. How the Sisters choose to govern themselves and care for pregnant women are \n“matter[s] of intense doctrinal concern.” See id.  \n99. Forcing the Sisters of Life to hand over their internal documents and commu-\nnications would thus “interfere[] with [their] decision-making processes on a matter \nof intense doctrinal concern” and intrude on their “self-government.” See id. \n100.  The Act thus violates both Religion Clauses, which guarantee a heightened \n“independence” for churches and religious organizations “from secular control or  \nmanipulation.” See Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and Sch. v. EEOC, \n565 U.S. 171, 186 (2012). \n101.  The Sisters have suffered and will suffer irreparable harm absent injunc-\ntive and declaratory relief against Defendant.  \nCount IV \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nViolation of U.S. Const. Amend. I: Free Exercise Clause \nNot Neutral \n102.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated by reference. \n103.  The government is “obliged under the Free Exercise Clause to proceed in a \nmanner neutral toward and tolerant of [religious actors’] religious beliefs.” Master-\npiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colo. C.R. Comm’n, 138 S. Ct. 1719, 1731 (2018).  \n104.  “Government fails to act neutrally when it proceeds in a manner intolerant \nof religious beliefs or restricts practices because of their religious nature.” Fulton v. \nCity of Philadelphia, 141 S. Ct. 1868, 1877 (2021). \n22 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 23 of 30\n \n105.  When “‘official expressions of hostility’ to religion accompany laws or poli-\ncies burdening religious exercise,” courts must “‘set aside’ such policies without fur-\nther inquiry.” Kennedy v. Bremerton Sch. Dist., 142 S. Ct. 2407, 2422 n.1 (2022) (quot-\ning Masterpiece, 138 S. Ct. at 1732)). \n106.  The Act is not neutral with regard to religion.  \n107.  The Act’s legislative history and signing statements evince anti-religious \nanimosity. \n108.  The Act targets a subset of religiously motivated actors while failing to pur-\nsue the same alleged state interest against those who refer for abortion. \n109.  The Act thus “violate[s] the State’s duty under the First Amendment not to \nbase laws or regulations on hostility to a religion or religious viewpoint.” See Master-\npiece, 138 S. Ct. at 1731. \n110.  The Sisters have suffered and will suffer irreparable harm absent injunc-\ntive and declaratory relief against Defendant.  \nCount V \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nViolation of U.S. Const. Amend. I: Free Exercise Clause \nNot Generally Applicable \n111.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated by reference. \n112.  “[L]aws  burdening  religious  practice  must  be  of  general  applicability.” \nChurch of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 542 (1993).  \n113.  A law is not generally applicable when it “fail[s] to prohibit nonreligious \nconduct that endangers” the government’s regulatory interest “in a similar or greater \ndegree” than the prohibited religious conduct. Id. at 543.  \n23 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 24 of 30\n \n114.  Put differently, a law fails general applicability if it “treat[s] any compara-\nble secular activity more favorably than religious exercise.” Tandon v. Newsom, 141 \nS. Ct. 1294, 1296 (2021) (per curiam); see also Fulton, 141 S. Ct. at 1877.  \n115.  “[W]hether two activities are comparable for purposes of the Free Exercise \nClause must be judged against the asserted government interest that justifies the \nregulation at issue.” Tandon, 141 S. Ct. at 1296. \n116.  Here, the asserted government interest is that “[d]ecisions about pregnancy \nare time sensitive,” and “identifying gaps in health care . . . is critical to achieving \noptimal health outcomes for women who are or may be pregnant.” Memorandum from \nthe New York State Assembly on A05499, https://perma.cc/P42Z-63U7. \n117.  But the Act imposes no disclosure obligations at all on secular organizations \nthat provide or refer for abortions, notwithstanding the State’s asserted interest in \n“identifying gaps in health care” and “[m]eeting the health and resource needs of \npregnant women.” Id. That omission renders the Act not generally applicable. \n118.  It is “no answer that a State treats some comparable secular [organizations] \nas poorly as or even less favorably than the religious exercise at issue.” Tandon, 141 \nS. Ct. at 1296. That pro-life, secular organizations are subject to the Act’s burdensome \nrequirements does not erase the fact that the Act “treat[s] any comparable secular” \norganizations more favorably than religious ones. See id. \n119.  The Act thus triggers strict scrutiny.  \n24 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 25 of 30\n \n120.  Defendant has no compelling interest in requiring religious organizations \nto comply with intrusive and burdensome disclosure requests, but not applying those \nsame requirements to other secular facilities. \n121.  Defendant has not selected the least restrictive means to further any gov-\nernmental interest. \n122.  The Sisters have suffered and will suffer irreparable harm absent injunc-\ntive and declaratory relief against Defendant.  \nCount VI \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nViolation of U.S. Const. Amend. I: Assembly, Free Speech, and                   \nFree Exercise Clauses                                                                     \nRight of Assembly \n123.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated by reference. \n124.  The First Amendment protects the right of people “peaceably to assemble” \nto engage in religious exercise and speech activities with persons of their choosing. \nSee Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516, 530-40 (1945). \n125.  The Sisters of Life assemble with each other, with the women they serve, \nand with their supporters, affiliates, and volunteers as an expression of their faith. \n126.  The Act infringes the Sisters’ First Amendment right “peaceably to assem-\nble” for religious exercise and speech activities by imposing intrusive and burdensome \ndisclosure requirements. See id. at 530. \n127.  Defendant does not have a compelling interest in restricting the Sisters’ \npeaceable assembly.  \n25 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 26 of 30\n \n128.  Restricting  the  Sisters’  peaceable  assembly  is  not  the  least  restrictive \nmeans to further any governmental interest. \n129.  The Sisters have suffered and will suffer irreparable harm absent injunc-\ntive and declaratory relief against Defendant.  \nCount VII \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nViolation of U.S. Const. Amend. I: Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses \nRight of Association \n130.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated by reference. \n131.  The First Amendment protects the “freedom to engage in association” with \nothers “for the advancement of beliefs and ideas.” NAACP v. State of Ala. ex rel. Pat-\nterson, 357 U.S. 449, 460 (1958). The right of association prohibits governmental ac-\ntion that either “direct[ly]” “restrict[s] the right of [persons] to associate freely,” or \nthat has the “effect of curtailing the freedom to associate.” Id. at 460-61. \n132.  Compelling an organization to disclose the identities of its supporters and \nthose who use its services is likely to chill speech by the organization, the women it \nserves, and its supporters, all of whom may “face[] a risk of reprisals if their affiliation \nwith the organization became known.” Ams. for Prosperity Found. v. Bonta, 141 S. \nCt. 2373, 2382 (2021). \n133.  The Sisters of Life engage in protected association when they support and \ncare for women experiencing crisis pregnancies, and when they engage supporters, \naffiliates, and volunteers to help carry out that work. \n26 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 27 of 30\n \n134.  The Act has a chilling effect on the Sisters’ expressive association by requir-\ning them to make decisions about how they minister and speak their religious beliefs \nunder a cloud of government investigation. \n135.  The Sisters’ discussions with pregnant women will likewise be chilled by \nboth parties’ awareness of the government’s claimed ability to obtain documents and \ninformation about the discussions and about the women seeking help. \n136.  The Act thus infringes the Sisters’ First Amendment right to associate with \nothers for the purpose of expression. \n137.  Defendant does not have a compelling interest in restricting the Sisters’ \nexpressive association.  \n138.  Restricting the Sisters’ expressive association is not the least restrictive \nmeans to further any governmental interest. \n139.  The Sisters have suffered and will suffer irreparable harm absent injunc-\ntive and declaratory relief against Defendant.  \nCount VIII \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nViolation of U.S. Const. Amend. IV \nUnreasonable Search and Seizure \n140.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated by reference. \n141.  The Fourth Amendment does not permit the government to “engag[e] in \narbitrary fishing expeditions” or “select targets of investigation out of malice or an \nintent to harass.” In re Subpoena Duces Tecum, 228 F.3d 341, 349 (4th Cir. 2000) \n(citing United States v. R. Enters., Inc., 498 U.S. 292, 299 (1991)). \n27 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 28 of 30\n \n142.  The Sisters of Life have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their records. \nThe Act purports to compel the Sisters to disclose a litany of confidential information, \nincluding information about their internal procedures, affiliate relationships, and vol-\nunteers. The Sisters take various measures to guard such confidential information \nfrom public disclosure. \n143.  The women served by the Sisters of Life also have privacy interests in the \nnon-public personal information they disclose to the Sisters. These women reasonably \nexpect that such private information would be used only for the limited purpose of \nfacilitating the care and support the Sisters provide. And the Sisters share the inter-\nests of these women in maintaining their privacy, so that the women will continue to \nhave trust and confidence in the relationships they have developed with the Sisters. \n144.  The Act violates the Fourth Amendment because it improperly authorizes \nthe Commissioner to obtain internal documents and information without a warrant \nand without any reason to suspect that the organization is violating the law. And it \ndoes so without any form of precompliance review. \n145.  The Sisters have suffered and will suffer irreparable harm absent injunc-\ntive and declaratory relief against Defendant.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, Plaintiff requests that the Court:  \na.  Declare that the Act violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment \nto the United States Constitution by discriminating against the Sisters of Life based \non the content and viewpoint of their speech;  \n28 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 29 of 30\n \nb.  Declare that the Act violates the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of \nthe First Amendment by violating the autonomy of the Sisters of Life to make deci-\nsions regarding faith, doctrine, and internal governance free from governmental in-\nterference; \nc.  Declare that the Act violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment \nto the United States Constitution because it is not neutral or generally applicable; \nd.  Declare that the Act violates the Assembly, Free Exercise, and Free Speech \nClauses of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution by infringing the \nSisters’ right peaceably to assemble with others as an expression of their faith; \ne.  Declare that the Act violates the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses of the \nFirst Amendment to the United States Constitution by infringing the Sisters’ right \nto associate with others for the purpose of expression; \nf.  Declare that the Act violates the Fourth Amendment to the United States Con-\nstitution by subjecting the Sisters to invasive and burdensome disclosure require-\nments without a warrant and without any individualized suspicion of wrongdoing; \ng.  For the foregoing reasons, declare the Act unconstitutional both on its face and \nas applied to the Sisters. \nh.  Issue  a  permanent  injunction  prohibiting  the  Defendant,  the  Defendant’s \nagents and employees, and all those acting in concert with the Defendant, from en-\nforcing the Act; \ni.  Award Plaintiff reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988; \nand \n29 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 1   Filed 09/02/22   Page 30 of 30\n \nj.

Bassett, Commissioner of the New York \nState Department of Health (hereinafter defendant or “DOH”) in this action.  \nPlaintiff filed the Complaint herein on September 2, 2022 and its motion for a preliminary \ninjunction on September 16, 2022.  The Court has ordered that defendant’s opposition to the \nmotion be filed on October 14, 2022 and its response to the Complaint be filed on October 13, \n2022, among other deadlines. \nIn late September, shortly after receipt of the filings in this case, undersigned counsel met \nand conferred with plaintiff’s counsel to discuss various scheduling matters.  That conversation \nhas continued and broadened, resulting in an agreement between the parties to request that the \nCourt temporarily stay this litigation while protecting the interests asserted by the plaintiff. \nThus, the parties now propose to stay the litigation, including all pending deadlines, for \nninety (90) days from the date of the Court’s order on this application (the “Stay Period”).  The \ndefendant DOH has agreed not to request any documents or information from the Plaintiff under \nthe Statute during the Stay Period. \n28 LIBERTY STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10005    PHONE (212) 416-8610    NOT FOR SERVICE OF PAPERS  \nWWW.AG.NY.GOV \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-LGS   Document 28   Filed 10/12/22   Page 2 of 2\nThe Honorable Lorna G. Schofield  \nOctober 7, 2022 \nPage 2 of 2 \n Either party may also opt to terminate the Stay Period prior to the expiration of the ninety \n(90) days.  At the expiration or termination of the Stay Period, the defendant has agreed not to\nrequest any documents or information from plaintiff for the additional period of time that may be\nrequired for the plaintiff to recommence a preliminary injunction motion, brief that motion, and\nfor the Court to issue a decision on that motion.  Conversely, plaintiff agrees to provide the\ndefendant a reasonable amount of time to respond to a renewed preliminary injunction motion.\nDefendant DOH has further agreed that if it intends to commence the process of issuing \ndocument or information requests to other entities under the Statute within the Stay Period, it will \nnotify plaintiff at that time, to allow plaintiff the option of terminating the Stay Period and \nreinstating this litigation, including its motion for preliminary injunction. \nFinally, if further litigation is required, the parties have agreed to submit to the Court a \nproposed schedule for the completion of briefing on the preliminary injunction motion and other \nmatters as required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Your Honor’s individual practices. \nBoth parties have reviewed and consented to the foregoing terms and respectfully request \nthat the Court adopt the proposed stay by “so ordering” it.   \nThe parties thank the Court for its assistance in this matter. \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/ \nJames Mirro \nAssistant Attorney General \ncc: All Counsel (by ECF) \n28 LIBERTY STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10005    PHONE (212) 416-8610    NOT FOR SERVICE OF PAPERS  \nWWW.AG.NY.GOV ",

McDonald in his official \ncapacity as the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health (“Defendant” or \n“DOH”), and ordered by this Court, as follows:  \nWHEREAS, on June 13, 2022, the New York State Legislature enacted Chapter 17 of the \nNew York Laws of 2022 (the “Statute”), which authorizes and directs the Commissioner of DOH \n“to conduct a study and issue a report examining the unmet health and resource needs facing \npregnant women in New York and the impact of limited service pregnancy centers on the ability \nof  women to obtain accurate, non-coercive health care information and timely access to a \ncomprehensive range of reproductive and sexual health care services” and directed the Statute to \ntake effect immediately; and \nWHEREAS, the Statute authorizes the Commissioner of DOH, for purposes of conducting \nthe  study  and  issuing  the  required  report,  to  request  “data  and  information” \n from  “limited  service  pregnancy  centers”  “and  other  relevant  sources,”  and  directs  the \nCommissioner of DOH to issue the report and to publish it on DOH’s public website; and  \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 51   Filed 11/08/23   Page 2 of 7\n   WHEREAS, on September 2, 2022, Plaintiff Sisters of Life commenced the above-\ncaptioned  action  against  Defendant  Mary  T.  Bassett,  in  her  official  capacity  as  the  then-\nCommissioner of DOH,1 asserting a facial and as-applied challenge to the Statute under the First \nand Fourth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; and   \nWHEREAS the parties want to avoid further litigation and settle the disputes between them \nwithout any admission of fault or liability;  \n  NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED AND AGREED, by and among \nthe undersigned attorneys of record for the parties, that this action is settled, subject to the approval \nof the Court, on the following terms and conditions: \n1.  As of the date that this Stipulation and Order is executed by all parties and so-\nordered by the Court (“Effective Date”), all claims asserted by Plaintiff in this action shall be \ndismissed,  with  prejudice  and  without  payments,  attorney’s  fees,  costs,  disbursements,  or \nexpenses, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a). \n2.  Defendant agrees and is hereby ordered not to take any enforcement action of any \nkind against Plaintiff based on Plaintiff’s nonresponse to or noncompliance with any survey, \ndocument request, or information request of any kind authorized by or issued by Defendant \npursuant to the Statute. \n3.  The jurisdiction of this Court to assure compliance with the Stipulation and Order \nshall terminate upon the date when the report mandated by the Statute is issued and published on \nDOH’s  public  website,  whereupon  Defendant  agrees  that  its  authority  to  request  data  and \ninformation pursuant to the Statute, and to take any enforcement action relating thereto, ends. \n \n1 On January 1, 2023, Mary T. Bassett resigned as Commissioner of DOH, and on June 10, 2023 \nJames V. McDonald was confirmed by the State Senate as Commissioner of DOH. Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 25(d), Commissioner McDonald is automatically substituted as defendant in this action. \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 51   Filed 11/08/23   Page 3 of 7\nProvided, however, if Plaintiff, prior to Defendant’s issuance and publication of the mandated \nreport, provides written notice of any alleged noncompliance of this Stipulation and Order to \nDefendant’s counsel pursuant to Paragraph 4, or moves pursuant to Paragraph 4 for enforcement \nof this Stipulation and Order, jurisdiction of the Court shall continue until (a) the time for Plaintiff \nto make a motion pursuant to Paragraph 4 expires; (b) any such motion is decided; (c) if any such \nmotion is decided favorably for Plaintiff, until such time as directed by the Court; or (d) such time \nas may be extended upon written agreement by Plaintiff and Defendant and so-ordered by the \nCourt in modification of this Stipulation and Order. \n4.  The parties to this Stipulation and Order will endeavor in good faith to informally \nresolve any differences regarding compliance and interpretation of this Stipulation and Order prior \nto making any motion to the Court and agree that the jurisdiction of the Court following the \nEffective Date is maintained solely for purposes of enforcing the terms of this Stipulation and \nOrder. During the period between the Effective Date and the date when the report mandated by the \nStatute is issued by Defendant and published on DOH’s public website, if Plaintiff believes that \nDefendant has not complied with Paragraph 2 of this Stipulation and Order, Plaintiff shall notify \nDefendant’s counsel in writing of the nature and specifics of the alleged noncompliance. Such \nwritten notice shall be accompanied by copies of any documents relied upon by Plaintiff for the \nclaimed  noncompliance. Plaintiff’s counsel and Defendant’s  counsel shall meet  as  early as \npracticable within the five (5) days following such notice to Defendant’s counsel to discuss the \nclaimed noncompliance and possible solutions. If no resolution is reached within five (5) days \nfollowing such meeting, Plaintiff may move this Court for an order for all appropriate injunctive \nrelief, provided that any such motion must be made no later than by fifteen (15) days after the date \nwhen  written  notice  of  any  alleged  noncompliance  is  provided  by  Plaintiff’s  counsel  to \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 51   Filed 11/08/23   Page 4 of 7\nDefendant’s  counsel.  The  parties  agree  that  the  aforementioned  deadlines  for  meeting  and \nresolving any potential disputes may be extended by mutual written agreement of the parties. If \nPlaintiff has moved this Court for injunctive relief pursuant to this paragraph, upon notice of the \nmotion, Defendant agrees to cease the conduct that is the subject of Plaintiff’s motion until the \nCourt resolves the motion. \n5.  In the event of any change in federal, state, or local laws, statutes, ordinances, rules \nor regulations including Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services requirements that Defendant \nbelieves changes his responsibilities pursuant to this Stipulation and Order, Defendant shall so \nnotify Plaintiff’s counsel in writing and the parties shall attempt to come to an agreement as to any \nmodifications of the Stipulation and Order that are warranted by any such changes. If no resolution \nis reached within fourteen (14) days following the written notice, Defendant may move this Court \nfor an order for all appropriate relief pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nor any other applicable rule or procedure, and Plaintiff may oppose any such motion by Defendant.  \n6.  Nothing in this Stipulation and Order shall be deemed to constitute a custom, \npolicy, or practice of DOH, the State of New York (including, but not limited to, any agencies, \ndepartments, and subdivisions thereof), or any of their officials, employees or agents. Nothing \ncontained in this Stipulation and Order, and no action taken pursuant to this Stipulation and Order, \nshall be deemed to be an admission of Plaintiff’s allegations by Defendant or any agency, office, \nofficial, employee, or agent of the State of New York, nor an admission by Defendant that he has \nin any manner or way violated Plaintiff’s rights. Similarly, nothing contained in this Stipulation \nand Order, and no action taken pursuant to this Stipulation and Order, shall be deemed a waiver or \nadmission that Plaintiff’s allegations are not meritorious or that Defendant is not liable for a \nviolation of Plaintiff’s rights. By entering into this Stipulation and Order, Defendant in no way \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 51   Filed 11/08/23   Page 5 of 7\nadmits any violation of law or any liability whatsoever to Plaintiff, all such liability being expressly \ndenied. Similarly, by entering into this Stipulation and Order, Plaintiff in no way waives or admits \nthat Defendant is not liable for violating Plaintiff’s constitutional rights. Rather, Plaintiff and \nDefendant enter into this Stipulation and Order to avoid further protracted litigation and to resolve \nand settle all disputes.  \n7.  This Stipulation and Order shall have no precedential value and shall not be used \nor admissible in this or any other action or proceeding as evidence, except in an action or \nproceeding to enforce the terms of this Stipulation and Order, provided that Plaintiff is not \nprecluded from referencing the existence of this Stipulation and Order or its terms.  \n8.  This Stipulation and Order embodies the entire agreement of the parties in this \nmatter and no oral agreement entered into at any time nor any written agreement entered into prior \nto  the  execution  of  this  Stipulation  and  Order  regarding  the  subject  matter  of  the  instant \nproceedings, shall be deemed to exist, or to bind the parties hereto, or to vary the terms and \nconditions contained herein.  \n9.  This Stipulation and Order is final and binding upon the parties and their respective \nofficials, agents, employees, successors, and assigns. \n10.  Each party agrees to bear its own attorney’s fees and costs.  \n11.  This Stipulation and Order may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of \nwhich taken together shall constitute one stipulation, and may be executed by facsimile or \nelectronically-transmitted signature.   \n12.  This Stipulation and Order may be filed with the Court by any party without further \nnotice.  \n13.  Each signatory to this Stipulation and Order hereby represents and warrants that the \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-07529-JHR   Document 51   Filed 11/08/23   Page 6 of 7\nsignatory has the requisite authority to enter into this Stipulation and Order and has not previously \nassigned or transferred any rights or interests with respect to the matters covered by this Stipulation \nand Order.  \n14.

This Stipulation and Order may not otherwise be amended, changed, \nmodified, superseded, altered, or canceled, and the terms and conditions hereof may not be waived, \nexcept by a written instrument signed by each of the parties expressly stating that it is intended to \namend. \n15.  No waiver of any provision of this Stipulation and Order or the breach thereof shall \nbe effective unless expressed in a writing signed by the waiving party. The waiver by any party of \nany of the provisions of the Stipulation and Order or of the breach thereof shall not operate or be \nconstrued as a waiver of any other provision or breach thereof. \n16.  The parties represent and warrant that: (i) they have had reasonable opportunity to \nconsult with counsel, have consulted with counsel regarding the terms of this Stipulation and Order \nand its execution, and have read and understand all provisions of this Stipulation and Order; (ii) \nthey have freely and voluntarily entered into this Stipulation and Order with an intent to bind \nthemselves to its terms; and (iii) no promises or representations were made to them by any person \nto induce them to enter into this Stipulation and Order (other than the express terms set forth \nherein).  \n17.
