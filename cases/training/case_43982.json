          "description": "MINUTE entry before the Honorable Martha M. Pacold: Plaintiffs' motion for entry of partial final judgment, 73, requests the court to enter partial final judgment as to their § 1983 claims (brought only against individual defendants). The motion, 73, is granted. \"When an action presents more than one claim for relief, the court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). \"A proper Rule 54(b) order requires the district court to make two determinations: (1) that the order in question was truly a 'final judgment,' and (2) that there is no just reason to delay the appeal of the claim that was 'finally' decided.\" Gen. Ins. Co. of Am. v. Clark Mall Corp., 644 F.3d 375, 379 (7th Cir. 2011) (quoting Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Mackey, 351 U.S. 427, 435-37 (1956)). For an order to qualify as a \"final judgment,\" \"[i]t must be a 'judgment' in the sense that it is a decision upon a cognizable claim for relief, and it must be 'final' in the sense that it is 'an ultimate disposition of an individual claim entered in the course of a multiple claims action.'\" Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Gen. Elec. Co., 446 U.S. 1, 7 (1980) (quoting Sears, Roebuck & Co., 351 U.S. at 436). \"[W]hether the 'district court's order was truly a final judgment'\" depends on \"the degree of overlap between the certified claim and all other parts of the case that are still pending in the district court.\" Mwangangi v. Nielsen, 48 F.4th 816, 823 (7th Cir. 2022) (quoting Rankins v. Sys. Sols. of Ky., LLC, 40 F.4th 589, 592 (7th Cir. 2022)). On 3/31/2025, the court granted individual defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' § 1983 claims on state sovereign immunity grounds, but denied Illinois Department of Children and Family Services' (\"DCFS\") motion to dismiss plaintiffs' claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. 62 . The court also set a 4/30/2025 deadline for plaintiffs to file a motion for leave to amend. Id. at 13. In lieu of a motion for leave to amend, plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration, 67, which the court denied, 68, 69 . The court's 3/31/2025 order constitutes a final disposition of plaintiffs' § 1983 claims against individual defendants. The facts that plaintiffs must prove to prevail on their disability discrimination claims against DCFS do not overlap with the legal or factual predicates of individual defendants' state sovereign immunity defense or the \"real party in interest\" analysis. See Factory Mut. Ins. Co. v. Bobst Grp. USA, Inc., 392 F.3d 922, 924 (7th Cir. 2004) (noting that Rule 54(b) may \"be employed only when the subjects of the partial judgment do not overlap with those ongoing in the district court\" (citations omitted)). Indeed, plaintiffs' § 1983 claims (against individual defendants) and disability discrimination claims (against DCFS) \"are based on 'entirely different legal entitlements yielding separate recoveries.'\" Peerless Network, Inc. v. MCI Commc'ns Servs., Inc., 917 F.3d 538, 543 (7th Cir. 2019) (quotation omitted); see also Curtis-Universal, Inc. v. Sheboygan Emergency Med. Servs., Inc., 43 F.3d 1119, 1121 (7th Cir. 1994) (\"The appeal is proper because, although litigation remains pending in the district court, the judge's order completely disposes of one party (First National) and the judge entered the order as a final judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).\"). Therefore, resolution of plaintiffs' disability discrimination claims against DCFS would not \"undercut\" or \"otherwise alter\" the court's disposition of plaintiffs' § 1983 claims against individual defendants or any factual or legal issues relating to those claims. Rankins, 40 F.4th at 592 (quotation omitted). Because the court's 3/31/2025 order constitutes an \"ultimate disposition\" of plaintiffs' § 1983 claims against individual defendants, and because plaintiffs have not attempted to cure the deficiencies identified in that order via an amended complaint, the 3/31/2025 order qualifies as a final judgment with respect to those claims. Curtiss-Wright Corp., 446 U.S. at 7. Next, the court concludes that \"there is no just reason to delay the appeal of the claim that was finally decided.\" Gen. Ins. Co. of Am., 644 F.3d at 379. \"In determining whether there is no just reason to delay the appeal of individual final judgments, 'a district court must take into account judicial administrative interests as well as the equities involved.'\" Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. v. Cadbury Adams USA LLC, No. 04-cv-00346, 2010 WL 4115427, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 18, 2010) (quoting Curtiss-Wright Corp., 446 U.S. at 8). Because the court's 3/31/2025 order decided discrete issues in the course of dismissing discrete claims against discrete defendants, and because discovery and settlement negotiations are just now underway, an immediate appeal of that dismissal order would promote \"judicial efficiency.\" Rankins, 40 F.4th at 592. For the foregoing reasons, the court finds that there is no \"just reason for delay\" for the entry of partial final judgment as to plaintiffs' § 1983 claims against individual defendants.

In addition to the language in Paragraph 7 of the Agreed Confidentiality Order entered today, the parties are advised that motions to seal will not be granted as to discovery documents filed with the Court unless the request complies with the common law of this Circuit. See Bond v. Utreras, 585 F.3d 1061, 1073 (7th Cir. 2009) (noting that public \"has a presumptive right to access discovery materials that are filed with the court\"); Baxter Int'l, Inc. v. Abbott Labs., 297 F.3d 544, 545-46 (7th Cir. 2002) (stating that filed discovery documents \"that influence or underpin the judicial decision are open to public inspection unless they meet the definition of trade secrets or other categories of bona fide long-term confidentiality... In civil litigation only trade secrets, information covered by a recognized privilege (such as the attorney-client privilege), and information required by statute to be maintained in confidence (such as the name of a minor victim of sexual assault) is entitled to be kept secret\"); Union Oil Co. of Cal. v. Leavell, 220 F.3d 562, 567-68 (7th Cir. 2000) (\"Many a litigant would prefer that the subject matter of a case... be kept from the curious (including its business rivals and customers), but the tradition that litigation is open to the public is of very long standing.\"); Citizens First Nat'l Bank of Princeton v.

Parties moving to seal are directed to review the foregoing case law, and any motion to seal will be taken by the Court as a certification that the movant has read the applicable case law and has ensured that it is making a good-faith argument that the document in question qualifies for sealing under the Seventh Circuit's stringent standards. Further, the Court notes for the record that the Agreed Confidentiality and Protective Order bars parties from using \"confidential\" information to interview witnesses or to prepare them for deposition, as they may be shown such documents only \"during\" their depositions unless the producing party consents.

In granting the partial stay, the Court made clear that the stay was intended to be in effect during the pendency of defendants' motion to dismiss (doc. # 10 ), as the Court ordered an updated status report to be filed seven days after decision on that pending motion (doc. # 36 ). In the most recent joint status report, the parties state that they disagree about whether the stay should continue in full, even as the dismissal motion remains pending, and the defendants state that they see decision of that question turning on questions of contract law. The Court respectfully declines to decide this dispute based on the joint status report but would entertain a plaintiffs' motion to lift the stay. Any such motion must be on file no later than noon on 1/25/24, and the filing should contain, after conferral, a proposed agreed briefing schedule for entry by the magistrate judge. In the absence of such a motion, the stay will not be lifted, and the Court does not consider this a matter of contract law, because the stay has the effect of any court order, and any court order may be modified or vacated upon motion. Arguments on any motion to lift the stay ought to be directed to whether a continued stay is appropriate as a matter of law, and not whether plaintiffs contractually bound themselves to a continued stay.

    "summary": "<p>This is a case about minors in state care held in juvenile detention centers despite a judge having ordered their release. On January 19, 2023 the Cook County Public Guardian, on behalf of nine children with disabilities who were residing in juvenile detention despite their ordered release, filed this putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiffs sued the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), as well as the agency&rsquo;s current and former directors and administrators under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Represented by Loevy &amp; Loevy, a civil rights firm, the plaintiffs sought class certification, compensatory damages, attorneys&rsquo; fees and any other appropriate relief. The plaintiffs claimed that, despite the fact that the children represented in this suit were all court ordered to be released to their guardian, or placed in an appropriate environment if no guardian was available (also known as a Release Upon Request (RUR) order), the defendant failed to release the children in a timely manner. Plaintiff alleged the practice of incarcerating minors for months beyond their ordered release date went back decades. This over-incarceration, the plaintiffs&rsquo; claimed, caused unjust damage in the form of isolation, further trauma, deprivation of childhood experiences, and insufficient support for educational and mental health treatment needs. Additionally, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants&rsquo; discriminated against them on the basis of disability by failing to place them in the least restrictive environment possible, and the children were denied the benefits of this placement as a result. The case was assigned to Judge Martha M. Pacold.</p>\r\n<p>In their motion for class certification, the plaintiffs sought to represent a class of children &ldquo;who have been placed in the care or under the guardianship of DCFS at any time on or after January 1, 2018 and who were incarcerated in juvenile jail for at least 7 consecutive days after a court order for their [RUR].&rdquo; Additionally, eight plaintiffs sought to represent a subclass of children &ldquo;who have been placed in the care or under the guardianship of DCFS at any time on or after January 1, 2018 and who were incarcerated in juvenile jail for at least 7 consecutive days after a court order for their release upon request, and who had a disability within the meaning of the Americans with Disabilities Act at the time they were held RUR.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>On June 1, 2023, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss and strike class allegations alleging the plaintiffs&rsquo; constitutional claims were barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity. Additionally, the defendants argued that the plaintiffs did not state a claim for relief under the Rehabilitation Act or Americans with Disabilities Act because disabled and non-disabled children were treated alike by the defendants&rsquo; policies. The defendants requested that the court strike the motion for class certification because of the fact-specific nature of the challenges in any given child&rsquo;s placement. After filing, the defendants filed a motion to stay discovery pending a decision of the motion.</p>\r\n<p>On August 10, 2023, the parties agreed to a partial stay on discovery pending the resolution of the motion to dismiss and motion to strike class allegations. The defendants agreed to produce a list of the names and last known addresses of RUR youth who were held RUR for 7 days or more from January 2018 to January 19, 2023. The next day, the court approved the partial motion to stay discovery.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout 2023 and 2024, the parties filed periodic status reports.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 31, 2025, the court dismissed the &sect; 1983 claims, finding the claims were barred by sovereign immunity because the claims were against the state itself rather than the officials. Further, the court found defendants were deliberately indifferent to plaintiffs&rsquo; disabilities in funding and managing the placement program, in violation of both Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act and thus those claims would continue. Finally, the motion to strike class allegations was denied with the court finding it was premature because the class allegations were facially deficient.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration on April 29.</p>",

Pacold \nMARC C. SMITH, et al., \n    Defendants. \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \nPlaintiff Charles Golbert and other named and anonymous plaintiffs filed this \ncomplaint on behalf of themselves and a putative class of persons who were allegedly \ndetained  by  the  Illinois  Department  of  Children  and  Family  Services \n(“the Department” or “DCFS”) for an extended period of time without lawful basis.  \nPlaintiffs  sue  twelve  department  officials—Marc  D.  Smith,  Debra  Dyer-\nWebster, Beverly J. Walker, Lauren Williams, Ryan Goodwin, Antwan Turpeau, \nJanet Wukas Ahern, Jacquelin Dortch, Keith Polan, Ashley Deckert, Sari Rowitz, and \nKaren  Austin-Antoine—under  42  U.S.C. §  1983, Title  II  of  the  Americans  with \nDisabilities  Act  (“ADA”),  42 U.S.C.  § 12132  et  seq.,  and  the Rehabilitation  Act, \n29 U.S.C. § 794(a). With respect to their § 1983 claims, plaintiffs allege that the \nindividual defendants violated plaintiffs’ rights under the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs also sue the Department itself under Title II and \nthe Rehabilitation Act. \nDefendants move to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims under Rule 12(b)(6) and to strike \nclass allegations under Rule 12(f). [10].1 For the reasons below, defendants’ motion to \ndismiss is granted in part and denied in part. Defendants’ motion to strike class \nallegations is denied.  \nBACKGROUND \nThe court draws the following facts from the allegations in the complaint, \nwhich must be accepted as true for purposes of the motion to dismiss. See Boucher v. \nFin. Sys. of Green Bay, Inc., 880 F.3d 362, 365 (7th Cir. 2018) (citation omitted). \n \n1 Bracketed numbers refer to docket entries and are followed by page and / or paragraph \nnumber citations. Page numbers refer to the CM/ECF page number. \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 62 Filed: 03/31/25 Page 2 of 13 PageID #:325\nIn Illinois, the state may take legal custody of children who are abused or \nneglected by their parents or guardians, or who are otherwise dependent on the state \nfor their care. [1] ¶ 22; see 705 ILCS 405/2-27. State law tasks the Department with \nadministering and supervising child welfare services consistent with each child’s \nhealth, safety, and best interest. Id. ¶¶ 20, 21; see 20 ILCS 505/1 (discussing the \nDepartment’s statutory mission “to provide social services to children and their \nfamilies, to operate children’s institutions, and to provide certain other rehabilitative \nand residential services as enumerated in” the Children and Family Services Act). \nSome of these children commit (or are suspected of committing) crimes. Those \nadjudicated delinquent may be incarcerated in a juvenile detention center, but only \npursuant to court order. [1] ¶¶ 23, 24; see 705 ILCS 405/5-501(2). Detained children \nare entitled to periodic hearings to determine “whether there is an urgent and \nimmediate necessity to detain the minor for the protection of the person or property \nof another.” 705 ILCS 405/5-501(2). \nAccording  to  the  complaint,  once  the  court  issues  a  release-upon-request \n(“RUR”) order—for instance, because there is no longer an urgent and immediate \nnecessity justifying continued detention—the Department must release the child and \nplace them somewhere “consistent with the child’s best interests,” such as with a \nrelative  or  foster  family.2  [1] ¶  2;  see  20  ILCS  505/7  (listing  requirements  and \nconsiderations for the “[p]lacement of children”). But even after the issuance of a \nrelease-upon-request order, the Department might not immediately place children \nwith an appropriate long-term caregiver. Whether plaintiffs and class members can \nhold defendants liable when a child is detained despite a court order is the subject of \nthis lawsuit. \nDefendants  Smith,  Dyer-Webster,  and  Walker  served  as  Directors  of  the \nDepartment. [1] ¶ 27. As alleged, they failed to “increase the existing number of \nresidential  and  other  placements—including  but  not  limited  to  entering  into \ncontracts  to  develop  new  placements—in  order  to  provide  safe  and  appropriate \nplacements for every child incarcerated in juvenile jail despite an order for their \nrelease.” Id. ¶ 29. \nDefendant  Williams  served  as  Associate  Deputy  Director  of  Community \nResources  Management.  Id.  ¶  33.  Her  job  was  to  ensure  that  children  are \nappropriately  placed  with  caregivers,  and  to  make  “policy  changes  to  address \nplacement gaps.” Id. ¶¶ 34–35. As alleged, she failed to “create or amend DCFS \n \n2 The parties dispute the legal effect of a “release-upon-request” (RUR) order, and whether \nDCFS may decline to request the release of a child in its legal custody. Compare [16] at 7–8, \nand [33] at 7–10, with [23] at 9–11. While defendants ask the court to take “judicial notice” \nof their limited role in the detention process (relative to the Cook County Juvenile Temporary \nDetention Center), their arguments do not cite pertinent legal authorities. See [16] at 7. The \ncomplaint alleges that they were detained contrary to court orders. [1] ¶¶ 24–25. Defendants \nmay refute this and other allegations at a later stage in this litigation.  \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 62 Filed: 03/31/25 Page 3 of 13 PageID #:326\npolicies so that placements were timely located for children in DCFS care . . . .” \nId. ¶¶ 37–40. \nDefendants Goodwin and Turpeau served as Associate Deputy Directors of \nDelinquency Prevention. Id. ¶ 41. As alleged, they failed to secure the “services and \nsupports” that delinquent children need for their rehabilitation. Id. ¶¶ 42, 45. \nDefendant Ahern served as the Department’s Guardianship Administrator. \nId. ¶ 46. Defendants Dortch, Polan, and Deckert served as Deputy Directors of Child \nServices. Id. ¶ 51.

State law does not recognize “a \nprivate right of action or a judicially enforceable claim” against defendants for their \nalleged omissions. 20 ILCS 505/2.1. Plaintiffs instead bring this suit under federal \nlaw,  alleging  that  defendants  have  violated  their  rights  under  the  ADA  and \nRehabilitation Act, and the individual defendants have violated their rights under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n“A motion under Rule 12(b)(6) challenges the sufficiency of the complaint to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted.” Hallinan v. Fraternal Ord. of Police \nChicago Lodge No. 7, 570 F.3d 811, 820 (7th Cir. 2009). To survive a motion to \ndismiss, the complaint “must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \nstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, \n678 (2009) (quotation and internal quotation marks omitted). \n“[W]hen ruling on a defendant’s motion to dismiss, a judge must accept as true \nall of the factual allegations contained in the complaint.” Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. \n89, 94 (2007). But “[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported \nby mere conclusory statements,” do not give rise to a plausible entitlement to relief. \nIqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. \nDISCUSSION \nI.  Section 1983 Claims \nThe court will first address plaintiffs’ constitutional claims, brought under \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 “against the Individual Defendants only.” [1] at 29. The individual \n  3 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 62 Filed: 03/31/25 Page 4 of 13 PageID #:327\ndefendants argue that the doctrine of sovereign immunity bars these claims. See [16] \nat 10. The court agrees. \n“After  independence,  the  States  considered  themselves  fully  sovereign \nnations.” Franchise Tax Bd. v. Hyatt, 587 U.S. 230, 237 (2019). One “fundamental \naspect of the sovereignty which the States enjoyed before the ratification of the \nConstitution” was immunity from suit by private parties. Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. \n706, 713 (1999); see Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 54 (1996) (noting \nthat it “is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an \nindividual without its consent” (quoting Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 13 (1890))). \nWhen  the  “States  entered  the  Union,”  they  did  so  with  this  immunity  “intact, \nunlimited by Article III’s jurisdictional grant.” Va. Off. for Prot. & Advoc. v. Stewart, \n563 U.S. 247, 253 (2011). Thus, “[i]n our constitutional scheme, a federal court \ngenerally may not hear a suit brought by any person against a nonconsenting State.” \nAllen v. Cooper, 589 U.S. 248, 254 (2020). Though state sovereign immunity “neither \nderives from, nor is limited by, the terms of the Eleventh Amendment,” Alden, 527 \nU.S. at 713, the Amendment “confirm[s] the structural understanding that States \nentered the Union with their sovereign immunity intact.” Stewart, 563 U.S. at 253; \nsee P.R. Aqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 146 (1993) \n(“The Amendment is rooted in a recognition that the States, although a union, \nmaintain certain attributes of sovereignty, including sovereign immunity.”). \nImmunity is a “privilege of the sovereign,” Stewart, 563 U.S. at 253 (emphasis \nadded), and thus “belongs to the state alone by virtue of its sovereignty,” Hopkins v. \nClemson Agric. Coll. of S.C., 221 U.S. 636, 645 (1911); see Lake Country Ests., Inc. v. \nTahoe Reg’l Plan. Agency, 440 U.S. 391, 400 (1979) (“By its terms, the protection \nafforded  by  [the  Eleventh]  Amendment  is  only  available  to  ‘one  of  the  United \nStates.’”).  When—as  here—“the  state  is  not  named  as  a  defendant,  sovereign \nimmunity attaches only to entities that are functionally equivalent to states” or when \n“the suit effectively operates against the state as the real party in interest.” City of \nOakland ex rel. Bd. of Port Comm’rs v. Fed. Mar. Comm’n, 724 F.3d 224, 227 (D.C. \nCir. 2013); see Green v. Graham, 906 F.3d 955, 961–62 (11th Cir. 2018) (“The Supreme \nCourt has consistently recognized that sovereign immunity belongs to the state, and \nonly derivatively to state entities and state officials.”). Thus, while “[a]n officer in an \nindividual-capacity action . . . may be able to assert personal immunity defenses,” \nsuch as qualified immunity, “sovereign immunity ‘does not erect a barrier against \nsuits to impose individual and personal liability.’” Lewis v. Clarke, 581 U.S. 155, 163 \n(2017) (quoting Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 30–31 (1991)). \nOfficial-capacity suits, however, are different. The Supreme Court has long \nacknowledged that “a State ‘can act only through its officers and agents.’” Nevada v. \nHicks, 533 U.S. 353, 365 (2001) (quoting Tennessee v. Davis, 100 U.S. (10 Otto) 257, \n263 (1879)); see also Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 114 \nn.25 (1984) (“Unlike the English sovereign perhaps, an American State can act only \nthrough its officials.”); Briscoe v. President of the Bank of Ky., 36 U.S. (11 Pet.) 257, \n  4 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 62 Filed: 03/31/25 Page 5 of 13 PageID #:328\n318 (1837) (“A state can act only through its agents; and it would be absurd to say, \nthat any act was not done by a state, which was done by its authorized agents.”). \nThus, the Court has recognized that “[o]fficial-capacity suits . . . ‘generally represent \nonly another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an \nagent.’” Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165 (1985) (quoting Monell v. New York \nCity Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 690 n.55 (1978)). In such cases, the suit is “only \nnominally against the official and in fact is against the official’s office and thus the \nsovereign itself”—triggering sovereign immunity. Lewis, 581 U.S. at 162 (citations \nomitted); see Will v. Mich. Dep’t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989) (“[A] suit \nagainst a state official in his or her official capacity is not a suit against the official \nbut rather is a suit against the official’s office. As such, it is no different from a suit \nagainst the State itself.” (citations omitted)). \nThe distinction between official- and individual-capacity suits does not depend \n“on the characterization of the parties in the complaint.” Lewis, 581 U.S. at 162; see \nWill, 491 U.S. at 71 (explaining that the distinction is not “a mere pleading device”); \nIdaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U.S. 261, 270 (1997) (“The real interests \nserved by the Eleventh Amendment must not be sacrificed to elementary mechanics \nof captions and pleading.”); Bender v. Williamsport Area Sch. Dist., 475 U.S. 534, 543 \n(1986) (disregarding the formal “individual capacity” label where “nothing else in the \ncomplaint,  or  in  the  record  on  which  the  District  Court’s  judgment  was \nbased . . . support[s] the suggestion that relief was sought against any [official] in his \nor her individual capacity”). Indeed, “[a] plaintiff cannot circumvent the sovereign \nimmunity enjoyed by states and their employees in their official capacity simply by \npleading a cause of action against those same employees as individuals.” Gerlach v. \nRokita, 95 F.4th 493, 500–01 (7th Cir. 2024). \nRather than give dispositive weight to the case caption, “courts should look to \nwhether the sovereign is the real party in interest.” Lewis, 581 U.S. at 161–62 (citing \nHafer,  502  U.S.  at  25);  see  Pennhurst,  465  U.S. at  101  (holding  that  sovereign \nimmunity “bars a suit against state officials ‘when the state is the real, substantial \nparty in interest’” (quoting Ford Motor Co. v. Dep’t of Treasury, 323 U.S. 459, 464 \n(1945)). The focus of that inquiry, in turn, is on the remedy sought. See Lewis, \n581 U.S. at 162; Hawaii v. Gordon, 373 U.S. 57, 58 (1963) (per curiam) (“[R]elief \nsought nominally against an officer is in fact against the sovereign if the decree would \noperate against the latter.”). “The general rule is that a suit is against the sovereign \nif ‘the judgment sought would expend itself on the public treasury or domain, or \ninterfere with the public administration,’ or if the effect of the judgment would be ‘to \nrestrain the Government from acting, or to compel it to act.’” Pennhurst, 465 U.S. \nat 101  n.11  (quoting  Dugan  v.  Rank,  372  U.S.  609,  620  (1963)).  Thus,  “a  suit \nnominally against state employees in their individual capacities that demonstrably \nhas  the  identical  effect  as  a  suit  against  the  state  is . . . barred”  by  sovereign \nimmunity. Luder v. Endicott, 253 F.3d 1020, 1023 (7th Cir. 2001). \n  5 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 62 Filed: 03/31/25 Page 6 of 13 PageID #:329\n“Applying this rule can be a knotty and fact-bound inquiry.” Haynes v. Ind. \nUniv., 902 F.3d 724, 732 (7th Cir. 2018). The Fourth Circuit has identified the \nfollowing factors as relevant: (1) whether “the alleged unlawful actions of the state \nofficials” were “tied inextricably to their official duties,” (2) whether “if the state \nofficials had authorized the desired relief at the outset,” the “burden” would “have \nbeen borne by the State,” (3) whether “a judgment against the state officials” would \n“be  institutional  in  character,  such  that  it  would  operate  against  the  State,” \n(4) whether  “the  actions  of  the  state  officials”  were  “taken  to  further  personal \ninterests distinct from the State’s interests,” and (5) whether “the state officials’ \nactions” were “ultra vires.” Cunningham v. Lester, 990 F.3d 361, 366 (4th Cir. 2021) \n(quoting Martin v. Wood, 772 F.3d 192, 196 (4th Cir. 2014)). Although the Seventh \nCircuit has not expressly adopted this test, the Cunningham factors provide helpful \nstructure for the court’s sovereign immunity analysis. In this case, each points in the \nsame  direction—toward  finding  that  the  state  is  the  real  party  in  interest  and \ndismissing plaintiffs’ § 1983 clams on sovereign immunity grounds. \nFirst,  the  alleged  unlawful  actions  are  inextricably  tied  to  the  individual \ndefendants’ official duties. As alleged, these defendants violated the Fourteenth \nAmendment by skirting their duties “as responsible state officials entrusted with the \ncare of vulnerable children.” [1] ¶ 3. \nSecond, if the individual defendants had authorized the desired relief at the \noutset—that is, if they had put in place policies to ensure expeditious placement—\nthe state would have borne the burden of those policies. The complaint alludes to the \nindividual defendants’ official authority “to spend whatever funds are necessary to \nfind appropriate placements for every child in DCFS custody.” [1] ¶ 88. Those funds \nwould have had to come from the state’s coffers. And the crux of plaintiffs’ § 1983 \nclaim  is  that  individual  defendants  should  have  invested  greater  sums  toward \nplacement programs, and their failure to do so violated the Fourteenth Amendment.3 \nThus, the second Cunningham factor supports finding that the state is the real party \nin interest. See Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 101 n.11 (noting the “general rule . . . that a \n \n3 As alleged, individual defendants failed to invest sufficient sums of money—approximately \n“$300-400  dollars  per  day,”  per  child—toward  “[a]ppropriate  placements  in  residential \ntreatment facilities.” [1] ¶ 91; see id. ¶ 88 (arguing that “a lack of funds is no defense to this \nsuit”). Plaintiffs’ response brief confirms that the alleged constitutional deprivations stem \nfrom individual defendants’ failure to spend more money on placement programs. See [23] at \n14–15 (asserting that Smith, Dyer-Webster, and Walker failed to “expand the number of \nplacements available to children in DCFS care”); id. at 15–16 (asserting that Williams failed \nto “create or locate appropriate placements”); id. at 16 (asserting that Turpeau and Goodwin \nfailed to “add DCFS services and supports” for plaintiffs); id. at 16–17 (asserting that Ahern \nfailed to “develop more placement capacity” or “develop new placement resources”); id. at 17 \n(asserting that Dortch, Polan, and Deckert failed to “develop more placement capacity”); \nid. at 17–18 (asserting that Rowitz and Austin-Antoine failed to “create[] new placements or \nadd[] services or capacity”). \n  6 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 62 Filed: 03/31/25 Page 7 of 13 PageID #:330\nsuit is against the sovereign if ‘the judgment sought would expend itself on the public \ntreasury’” (quoting Dugan, 372 U.S. at 620)); Gerlach, 95 F.4th at 501 (“Even if the \nsought after compensation would not definitively be paid out of the state treasury, if \nthe amount the plaintiff seeks ‘should have been paid by the State,’ the suit is likely \none against the state itself.” (quoting Lenea v. Lane, 882 F.2d 1171, 1178 (7th Cir. \n1989))). \nThird, a judgment against the individual defendants would operate against the \nstate. To be sure, “a money judgment would nominally fall on the defendants alone.” \nCunningham, 990 F.3d at 367; see Conner v. Reinhard, 847 F.2d 384, 395 (7th Cir. \n1988) (“[C]ourts do not generally consider an official sued in his personal capacity as \nbeing in privity with the government.”). This is notwithstanding the fact that the \nstate  chose  to  indemnify  the  individual  defendants.  5 ILCS  350/2(a);  see  Lewis, \n581 U.S. at 164–65 (holding that “an indemnification provision cannot, as a matter of \nlaw, extend sovereign immunity to individual employees who would otherwise not fall \nunder its protective cloak”); Luder, 253 F.3d at 1023 (“The fact that the state chooses \nto  indemnify  its  employees  who  are  sued  in  federal  court  is  irrelevant.”). \nNevertheless, the court “cannot avert [its] eyes from the effects that such a judgment \nwill have on the State.” Cunningham, 990 F.3d at 367. Here, as in Luder, “[t]he \nplaintiffs are seeking to accomplish exactly what they would accomplish were they \nallowed to maintain this suit against the state and did so successfully”—namely, \n“forc[ing] the state to accede” to their view of the Constitution and adjust its policies \naccordingly. 253 F.3d at 1024. The complaint acknowledges as much, explaining that \n“Plaintiffs seek damages from Defendants in hopes that this lawsuit will once and for \nall prevent more children from suffering wrongful incarceration within DCFS care.” \n[1] ¶ 7. Plaintiffs’ stated objective “raises serious federalism concerns that go to the \nheart of the Eleventh Amendment.” Jensen v. State Bd. of Tax Comm’rs of Ind., \n763 F.2d 272, 277 (7th Cir. 1985) (“[T]he aim of [the] suit against the individual State \nTax Board members is to compel them to act solely within their capacity as state \nofficials. The real party in interest in this case is therefore the state of Indiana, and \nthe individual members are merely nominal defendants.”); see also Ameritech Corp. \nv.  McCann,  297  F.3d  582,  586  (7th  Cir.  2002)  (explaining  that  “individual  (or \npersonal) capacity suits do not seek to conform the State’s conduct to federal law; \nrather, such suits seek recovery from the defendant personally”). \nFourth,  plaintiffs  do  not  contend  that  the  individual  defendants  acted  to \nfurther their own private interests, rather than the interests of Illinois. Finally (and \nrelatedly), plaintiffs do not challenge the individual defendants’ conduct or omission \nas ultra vires. In the context of sovereign immunity, “a state officer may be said to act \nultra vires only when he acts ‘without any authority whatever.’” Pennhurst, 465 U.S. \nat 101 n.11 (quoting Florida Dep’t of State v. Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458 U.S. 670, 697 \n(1982) (plurality opinion)). Here, the individual defendants are sued precisely because \nthey did not act despite having the authority to do so. See [1] ¶¶ 3, 26, 29, 30, 37, 38, \n43, 45, 48, 50, 53, 55, 58. Plaintiffs do not challenge the individual defendants’ failure \nto stay within the bounds of their “delegated power,” but their “error[s] in the exercise \n  7 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 62 Filed: 03/31/25 Page 8 of 13 PageID #:331\nof  that  power.”  Pennhurst,  465 U.S.  at 101  n.11  (quoting  Larson  v.  Domestic  & \nForeign Com. Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 690 (1949)). Thus, plaintiffs do not challenge the \nindividual defendants’ conduct or omissions as ultra vires. \nAll five Cunningham factors support the conclusion that the state of Illinois is \nthe real party in interest, and that the individual defendants are sued in their official, \nnot individual, capacity. \nConsideration of the Cunningham factors accords with the Seventh Circuit’s \napproach to the real-party-in-interest inquiry. Consider, for example, Genskow v. \nPrevost, 825 F. App’x 388 (7th Cir. 2020).4 As alleged in that case, a tribal chairman \nshut off a tribal elder’s microphone during a council meeting and ordered tribal police \nofficers to remove the tribal elder. Id. at 389. The Seventh Circuit held that the tribal \nelder’s § 1983 claims against the officers were official-capacity claims (and thus \nbarred by tribal sovereign immunity) “because the officers’ actions ‘in essence’ were \nthe tribe’s own.” Id. at 390–91 (quoting Lewis, 581 U.S. at 162). The “essence” of \nplaintiffs’ claims here is even more apparent than in Genskow. Plaintiffs acknowledge \nthat their purpose in bringing this suit is to “once and for all prevent more children \nfrom suffering wrongful incarceration while in DCFS care.” [1] ¶ 7. This sort of relief \nis one that can be pursued in federal court only via an action for prospective relief \nunder Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908). See Coeur d’Alene Tribe, 521 U.S. at 281 \n(noting that Ex parte Young ordinarily applies where there is “[a]n allegation of an \nongoing violation of federal law” and “the requested relief is prospective”). \nDoyle v. Camelot Care Centers, Inc., 305 F.3d 603 (7th Cir. 2002), is not to the \ncontrary. There, plaintiffs alleged that individual DCFS officials failed to follow \nconstitutionally adequate procedures during child abuse investigations. The Seventh \nCircuit did not elaborate whether defendants were entitled to sovereign immunity \nbecause the parties did not raise the issue on appeal. But in dicta via a footnote, the \ncourt  indicated that  plaintiffs  properly  sued  defendants  in  their  individual  (not \nofficial) capacities because “when fairly read, the complaints in this case do not mount \na generalized attack on the state agency; rather, they submit that the manner in \nwhich individual DCFS employees administered the reporting and investigatory \nscheme deprived [plaintiffs] of due process of law.” Id. at 613 n.9.  \nHere,  however,  plaintiffs  do  more  than  challenge  discrete  misconduct  by \nspecific  individuals  tasked  with managing  a  distinct  aspect  of  a  state  program. \nRather, plaintiffs “mount a generalized attack on the state agency,” id., alleging that \nthe  Department  and  a  dozen  of  its  officials  are  derelict  in  their  core  statutory \nresponsibility “to provide social services to children and their families, to operate \nchildren’s institutions, and to provide certain other rehabilitative and residential \nservices,” 20 ILCS 505/1. The complaint challenges the Department’s “policies and \n \n4 Although Genskow dealt with tribal—rather than state—sovereign immunity, the same \nprinciples apply in either context. See Lewis, 581 U.S. at 163. \n  8 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 62 Filed: 03/31/25 Page 9 of 13 PageID #:332\npractices”—“going back more than 30 years and continuing to this day”—regarding \nits treatment of “children in its care.” [1] ¶¶ 1, 5, 25; see Graham, 473 U.S. at 167 \nn.14 (indicating that challenges to the “implementation of state policy or custom may \nbe reached in federal court only” under Ex parte Young). As discussed, plaintiffs \n“seek[] damages from Defendants in hopes that this lawsuit will once and for all \nprevent more children from suffering wrongful incarceration while in DCFS care.” \nId. ¶ 7. Phrased differently, the purpose of this lawsuit is to obtain a money damages \njudgment that “would expend itself on the public treasury or domain, [and] interfere \nwith the public administration, [and] . . . restrain the Government from acting, or to \ncompel it to act.” Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at  101 n.11 (quotation and internal quotation \nmarks omitted). That, the Eleventh Amendment does not allow. \n Because plaintiffs’ § 1983 claims against the individual defendants are “in \nessence against [the] State,” “the State is the real party in interest and is entitled to \ninvoke” sovereign immunity. Lewis, 581 U.S. at 162. “[E]ven when properly raised,” \nhowever, “sovereign immunity is not absolute immunity.” Council 31 of the Am. Fed’n \nof State, Cnty. & Mun. Emps., AFL-CIO v. Quinn, 680 F.3d 875, 882 (7th Cir. 2012). \nStates “remain subject to suit in certain circumstances.” Torres v. Tex. Dep’t of Pub. \nSafety, 597 U.S. 580, 587 (2022). But none of those circumstances is present here. \nFirst,  “the  Ex  parte  Young  doctrine  allows  suits . . . for  declaratory  or \ninjunctive relief against state officers in their official capacities.” Reed v. Goertz, \n598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). Because plaintiffs seek damages, not forward-looking relief, \n[1] at 31, Ex parte Young is inapplicable. See Driftless Area Land Conservancy v. \nValcq, 16 F.4th 508, 521 (7th Cir. 2021) (“Ex parte Young . . . applies only when a \nplaintiff seeks prospective relief against an ongoing violation of federal law.” (citation \nomitted)). \nSecond, “Congress may abrogate state sovereign immunity when exercising its \nenforcement power conferred by section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.” McDaniel \nv. Syed, 115 F.4th 805, 820 (7th Cir. 2024) (citation omitted). However, Congress did \nnot do so when it enacted § 1983. Thomas v. Illinois, 697 F.3d 612, 613 (7th Cir. 2012) \n(“Congress did not abrogate the states’ sovereign immunity from suit under section \n1983, as it could have done.” (citations omitted)).  \nThird, the Constitution itself abrogates state sovereign immunity in a narrow \ncategory of cases. See Torres, 597 U.S. at 588–89 (listing, as examples, suits between \nstates, suits by the United States against a state, bankruptcy proceedings, and suits \ninvolving the federal power of eminent domain). But “[t]he Fourteenth Amendment \ndoes not by its own force override the States’ Eleventh Amendment immunity . . . .” \nWatson v. Div. of Child Support Servs., 560 F.

Illinois  has  not \nexpressed—unequivocally or otherwise—its consent to plaintiffs’ § 1983 claims. \nBecause plaintiffs’ § 1983 claims are “only nominally against the official[s] and \nin fact [are] against the sovereign itself,” they are barred by sovereign immunity. \nLewis, 581 U.S. at 162. Thus, plaintiffs’ § 1983 claims are dismissed. \nII.  ADA & Rehabilitation Act Claims \nNext, the court turns to plaintiffs’ ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims. These \nclaims are brought against all defendants. [1] at 29–30. However, Title II of the ADA \napplies only to “public entit[ies],” 42 U.S.C. § 12132, which are defined, in relevant \npart, as “any State or local government” or “any department, agency, special purpose \ndistrict,  or  other  instrumentality  of  a  State  or  States  or  local  government.”  Id. \n§ 12131(1); see City of San Francisco v. Sheehan, 575 U.S. 600, 610 (2015) (“Only \npublic  entities  are  subject  to  Title  II.”).  Accordingly,  individuals  are  not  proper \ndefendants in damages actions under Title II. See Jaros v. Ill. Dep’t of Corr., 684 F.3d \n667, 670 (7th Cir. 2012); Ravenna v. Vill. of Skokie, 388 F. Supp. 3d 999, 1004 \n(N.D. Ill. 2019). \nThe same is true under the Rehabilitation Act. See Washington v. Ind. High \nSch. Athletic Ass’n, Inc., 181 F.3d 840, 845 n.6 (7th Cir. 1999) (explaining that Title \nII and the Rehabilitation Act are “nearly identical, and precedent under one statute \ntypically applies to the other”); Silk v. City of Chicago, 194 F.3d 788, 798 n.6 (1999) \n(“[T]he Rehabilitation Act is distinguishable only because it is limited to programs \nreceiving  federal  financial  assistance.”).  Indeed,  the  ADA’s  definition  of  “public \nentity” mirrors the earlier-enacted Rehabilitation Act’s definition of “program or \nactivity.” Compare 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1)(B), with 29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(1)(A). Thus, \nplaintiffs’ Title II and Rehabilitation Act claims against the individual defendants \nare dismissed. \nThat leaves plaintiffs’ claims against DCFS itself. Although DCFS is a state \nagency and thus ordinarily entitled to sovereign immunity, see Darryl H. v. Coler, \n801 F.2d 893, 906 (7th Cir. 1986), it has waived immunity from Rehabilitation Act \nclaims as a condition of accepting federal funding. [1] ¶ 123; see Jaros, 684 F.3d at 672 \nn.5 (citing Stanley v. Litscher, 213 F.3d 340, 344 (7th Cir. 2000)); PennEast Pipeline, \n  10 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 62 Filed: 03/31/25 Page 11 of 13 PageID #:334\n594 U.S. at 500 (“A State may of course consent to suit . . . .”). The ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act are “with respect to this lawsuit . . . the same except that the \nRehabilitation Act includes as an additional element the receipt of federal funds.” \nJaros, 684 F.3d at 671. Thus, the court need not decide “the thorny question of \nsovereign immunity” as to plaintiffs’ ADA claims, “since [plaintiffs] can have but one \nrecovery.” Id. at 672. The court turns, therefore, to the merits of plaintiffs’ Title II \nand Rehabilitation Act claims. \nTo prevail under either statute, a “plaintiff must prove that he is a ‘qualified \nindividual  with  a  disability,’  that  he  was  denied  ‘the  benefits  of  the  services, \nprograms, or activities of a public entity’ or otherwise subjected to discrimination by \nsuch an entity, and that the denial or discrimination was ‘by reason of’ his disability.” \nWagoner v. Lemmon, 778 F.3d 586, 592 (7th Cir. 2015) (quotation omitted).  \nHere, plaintiffs allege that they and other class members suffer from “mental \nhealth issue[s], intellectual disabilit[ies], developmental disabilit[ies] and/or learning \ndisabilit[ies].”  [1]  ¶ 79.  The Department  does  not  dispute  that  these  qualify  as \ndisabilities under the ADA, or that plaintiffs were allegedly denied the benefits of the \nDepartment’s federally funded placement programs. See [16] at 20–21. Instead, the \nDepartment disputes whether plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to support a \nreasonable inference that defendants’ alleged failure to place them in a safe and \nappropriate environment was “by reason of” their disabilities. \n“[D]iscrimination under both acts may be established by evidence that (1) the \ndefendant intentionally acted on the basis of the disability, (2) the defendant refused \nto provide a reasonable accommodation, or (3) the defendant’s rule disproportionately \nimpacts disabled people.” Ind. High Sch. Athletic Ass’n, 181 F.3d at 847. Intentional \ndiscrimination may rest on a showing of deliberate indifference. Lacy v. Cook Cnty., \n897 F.3d 847, 863 (7th Cir. 2018).  \nTo show deliberate indifference, a plaintiff must demonstrate the defendant’s \n“(1) knowledge that a harm to a federally protected right is substantially likely,” and \n“(2) a failure to act upon that likelihood.” Id. (quoting S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower \nMerion Sch. Dist., 729 F.3d 248, 263 (3d Cir. 2013)). Allegations tending to show \ndiscriminatory animus—that is, “prejudice, spite, or ill will”—are not required to \nstate an intentional discrimination claim. Id. at 862 (quotation omitted). \nThe Department argues that it did not know about plaintiffs’ disabilities and \nthus could not know that its failure to act harmed plaintiffs’ federal right to equal \naccess to the benefits of the placement program. See [16] at 20–21. That argument is \nunpersuasive. As alleged, the Department was made aware of gaps in the placement \nprogram “through court filings and hearings, correspondence, meetings, internal data \nand reports, the legislature, media, and other sources.” [1] ¶ 61. The complaint quotes \nfrom no fewer than nine of plaintiff Charles Golbert’s letters and public hearing \ntestimonies “sounding the alarm bells about RUR problems at DCFS.” Id. ¶ 67. And \n  11 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 62 Filed: 03/31/25 Page 12 of 13 PageID #:335\nstate  law  required  the  Department  to  “submit  annual  reports  to  the  General \nAssembly that detailed, among other things, the number of children held in detention \ncenters after an order for release . . . .” Id. ¶ 69. Further, the allegations that multiple \nplaintiffs have been placed on individualized education programs, been diagnosed \nwith  “depressive  disorder,  neurodevelopmental  disorder,  ADHD,  and  disruptive \ndysregulation disorder[,]” and been prescribed “medication monitoring, therapy, and \nanger management” support a reasonable inference that the Department—as their \ncaretaker—knew about their disabilities. Id. ¶¶ 11–18; see Zimmerman v. Bornick, \n25 F.4th 491, 493 (7th Cir. 2022) (requiring courts, at the pleading stage, to “draw all \nreasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor”). \nIn  sum,  the  complaint  adequately  alleges  that  the  Department  was \ndeliberately  indifferent  to  plaintiffs’  disabilities  in  funding  and  managing  the \nplacement program, in violation of both Title II and the Rehabilitation Act. As to \nthese claims, the Department’s motion to dismiss is denied. \nIII.  Motion to Strike Class Allegations \nFinally, defendants move to strike plaintiffs’ class allegations under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 12(f). [10]. Rule 12(f) provides that “[t]he court may strike \nfrom a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, \nor scandalous matter.” “Courts in this District, however, evaluate motions to strike \nclass allegations under Rule 23, not Rule 12(f).” Buonomo v. Optimum Outcomes, Inc., \n301 F.R.D. 292, 295 (N.D. Ill. 2014). Thus, the court will construe defendants’ Rule \n12(f) motion as one filed under Rule 23. \nRule 23(c)(1)(A) directs that “[a]t an early practicable time after a person sues \nor is sued as a class representative, the court must determine by order whether to \ncertify the action as a class action.” “Most often it will not be ‘practicable’ for the court \nto do that at the pleading stage, but sometimes the complaint will make it clear that \nclass certification is inappropriate.” Hill v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 946 F. Supp. 2d \n817, 829 (N.D. Ill. 2013). For instance, denying class certification at the pleading \nstage is appropriate where “the plaintiff’s class allegations are facially and inherently \ndeficient.” Buonomo, 301 F.R.D. at 295. \nWith respect to plaintiff’s claims against the Department,5 the court is not \nconvinced  that  the  complaint’s  “class  allegations  are  facially  and  inherently \ndeficient,”  Buonomo,  301  F.R.D.  at  295,  such  that  class  certification  is  clearly \ninappropriate, Hill, 946 F. Supp. 2d at 829. “At this procedural stage, the Court is not \nequipped with the information needed to conduct the rigorous analysis required to \ndetermine  whether  Rule  23’s  requirements  have  been  satisfied.”  Boatwright  v. \nWalgreen Co., No. 10 C 3902, 2011 WL 843898, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 4, 2011); see Lucas \n \n5 Defendants’ arguments in support of their motion to strike class allegations focus entirely \non plaintiffs’ claims against the individual defendants. Those claims have been dismissed. \n  12 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 62 Filed: 03/31/25 Page 13 of 13 PageID #:336\nv. Vee Pak, Inc., 68 F. Supp. 3d 870, 884 (N.D. Ill. 2014) (“[Q]uestions of superiority \nand predominance are uniquely difficult to resolve based on the complaint alone[,]” \nand thus plaintiffs are “entitled to discovery before the defendants can attempt to bar \nthe door to class certification.”). Thus, defendants’ motion to strike plaintiffs’ class \nallegations is denied as premature. \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, defendants’ motion to dismiss, [10], is granted in part and \ndenied in part. Defendants’ motion to strike class allegations is denied. Plaintiffs are \ngiven until April 30, 2025, to file a motion for leave to amend, if they wish to do so \nand believe they can do so consistent with this opinion and Rule 11. If a motion for \nleave to amend is filed, a copy of the proposed amended complaint indicating what \nchanges the amended complaint makes to the original complaint must be attached to \nthe motion. \nDated: March 31, 2025  /s/ Martha M.

INTRODUCTION \nMotions to reconsider are not brought lightly, but sometimes they are necessary to correct \ninadvertent legal errors. This is such a case. \nIn granting Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Section 1983 claims, this Court \nrelied on a Fourth Circuit test to determine if statutory claims (rather than Constitutional claims) \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 67 Filed: 04/29/25 Page 2 of 11 PageID #:346\n \nwere barred by sovereign immunity. Dkt. 62 at 10. But the Fourth Circuit has expressly \ndisavowed use of that test when considering Section 1983 claims because doing so “would \nundermine the very purpose of § 1983.” Adams v. Ferguson, 884 F.3d 219, 225-\n226 (4th Cir. 2018).  \nThe important distinction between statutory claims and Constitutional claims was not \nconsidered by this Court’s decision. Plaintiffs accordingly request that this Court revisit the issue \nwith the proper legal foundation as set forth below.  \nII.  ARGUMENT \nA.  The Court Erroneously Relied on a Test that the Fourth Circuit Has Expressly Held \nInapplicable to 1983 Claims \n \nIn ruling that sovereign immunity barred Plaintiffs’ Section 1983 claims, the Court \nemployed a test from the Fourth Circuit case Cunningham v. Lester, 990 F.3d 361 (4th Cir. \n2021). But, as the Fourth Circuit has held in Adams, that test is inapplicable in the Section 1983 \ncontext. See 884 F.3d at 225. \nThe Fourth Circuit initially adopted the five-factor test to determine whether a statutory \nclaim is brought against the state or an individual in Martin v. Wood, 772 F.3d 192 (4th Cir. \n2014)1 In that case, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants—her former supervisors—had \nviolated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Id. The court found that although the plaintiff had \nalleged her claims against her former supervisors in their individual capacities, the suit was in \nfact brought against the state because the individual defendants’ “actions were inextricably tied \nto their official duties at the Hospital.” Id. at 193. In those circumstances, the court held that the \n \n1 The five factors are: “(1) were the alleged unlawful actions of the state officials tied inextricably to their official \nduties; (2) if the state officials had authorized the desired relief at the outset, would the burden have been borne by \nthe State; (3) would a judgment against the state officials be institutional in character, such that it would operate \nagainst the State; (4) were the actions of the state officials taken to further personal interests distinct from the State’s \ninterests; and (5) were the state officials’ actions ultra vires.” Cunningham v. Lester, 990 F.3d 361, 366 (4th Cir. \n2021) (quoting Martin v. Wood, 772 F.3d 192, 196 (4th Cir. 2014)).  \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 67 Filed: 04/29/25 Page 3 of 11 PageID #:347\n \nstate, which ran the hospital, was the real party in interest and the FLSA suit was therefore \nbarred by sovereign immunity. Id. at 196. Revisiting the issue in Cunningham, the Fourth Circuit \napplied the Martin factors to a suit brought under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act \n(TCPA) and, like in Martin, focused its inquiry on “whether the named defendants committed \nthe complained-of conduct in the course of performing their official duties, or whether they \nacted ultra vires or in pursuit of private interests.” Cunningham, 990 F.3d at 366. \nIn Martin and Cunningham, the Fourth Circuit applied the five factors to find ultimately \nthat sovereign immunity barred the plaintiffs’ statutory claims. But the central inquiry in those \ncases—whether the defendants were acting as part of their official duties or were acting in their \nown interest—cannot apply squarely in the Section 1983 context, where an element of the claim \nis that the defendants were acting under color of law. This is because, in every such \ncircumstance, if the test used to determine whether the Section 1983 defendant is performing his \nor her official duties, the answer will always be affirmative. This is why the Fourth Circuit \nexplicitly held that the Martin/Cunningham factors do not apply to Section 1983 suits, relying on \nHafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 26 (1991): \nIn Martin, we laid out a five-factor inquiry to “identify the real, substantial party in \ninterest” in suits alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standard Act (“FLSA”). [Martin, \n772 F.3d] at 196. Those factors focus on the connection between the officer’s conduct \nand his official duties, his interests and the state’s interests, and his authority and the \nstate’s authority. See id. This makes sense in the context of the FLSA, as “Congress \nmanifested a desire to exclusively define the private remedies available to redress \nviolations of” that statute. Kendall v. City of Chesapeake, 174 F.3d 437, 443 (4th Cir. \n1999). But Congress enacted § 1983 to give private litigants a mechanism to “enforce \nprovisions of the Fourteenth Amendment against those who carry a badge of authority of \na State and represent it in some capacity.” Hafer, 502 U.S. at 28, 112 S. Ct. 358 (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted). Applying the Martin factors, which focus on the \nofficial character of the defendant’s actions, to § 1983 claims would “absolutely \nimmunize state officials from personal liability for acts within their authority and \nnecessary to fulfilling governmental responsibilities.” Hafer, 502 U.S. at 28, 112 S.Ct. \n358. We refuse to apply to § 1983 claims these factors, which we articulated for use in \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 67 Filed: 04/29/25 Page 4 of 11 PageID #:348\n \nconsidering claims under a very different statute, and which would undermine the very \npurpose of § 1983. \n \nAdams v. Ferguson, 884 F.3d 219, 225-226 (4th Cir. 2018); see also Gibbons v. Gibbs, 99 F.4th \n211, 215 (4th Cir. 2024) (“[i]n [Adams] this Court specifically considered, and specifically \nrejected, the argument that ‘the Martin factors’ ‘apply to [Section] 1983 claims.’ The Court \nexplained that the FLSA and Section 1983 are ‘very different statute[s],’ and it concluded that \napplying the Martin factors to Section 1983 claims would stray from the Supreme Court’s \ndecision in Hafer and ‘undermine the very purpose of [Section] 1983.’”) (internal citations \nomitted); Does v. Whitmer, 69 F.4th 300, 306 (6th Cir. 2023) (“Few of our sister circuits have \nproposed tests for distinguishing between individual- and official-capacity actions. See \nCunningham v. Lester, 990 F.3d 361, 366 (4th Cir. 2021); Attwood v. Clemons, 818 F. App’x \n863, 871–72 (11th Cir. 2020) (Grant, J., concurring in part). These tests accentuate rather than \nresolve the difficulty of distinguishing between the two categories of suits and may, in part, run \ncounter to the Supreme Court’s guidance in Hafer and Lewis [v. Clarke, 581 U.S. 155, 163 \n(2017)].”). In other words, Martin factors cannot apply to Section 1983 claims because doing so \nwould be inconsistent with the statutory elements and the underlying purpose of Section 1983 as \nexplained by the Supreme Court in Hafer.  \nB.  Section 1983 Claims Predicated on Violations of the Constitution are Categorically \nDifferent from the Statutory Violations at Issue in Cunningham and Martin \n \n“The very purpose of [Section] 1983 was to interpose the federal courts between the \nStates and the people, as guardians of the people’s federal rights—to protect the people from \nunconstitutional action under color of state law, whether that action be executive, legislative, or \njudicial.” Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U.S. 225, 242 (1972) (internal citations omitted). Put \ndifferently, Section 1983 provides a remedy against state officials acting under color of state law \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 67 Filed: 04/29/25 Page 5 of 11 PageID #:349\n \nif they violated one’s constitutional rights. As alleged in Plaintiffs’ complaint, the individual \ndefendants in this suit violated Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights over a period of several years by \nleaving them in juvenile detention long after the reason for their detention expired. It is the \nconduct of these individual officers acting under color of state law of which Plaintiffs complain, \nand under Section 1983, “‘on the merits, to establish personal liability in a § 1983 action, it is \nenough to show that the official, acting under color of state law, caused the deprivation of a \nfederal right.’” Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 25 (1991), quoting Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. \n159, 166 (1985) (emphasis in original). \nA governmental actor cannot avoid liability for constitutional violations because the \nviolation was committed as part of his or her duties, because that would run afoul of the statutory \nrequirements of Section 1983. See Hafer, 502 U.S. at 27–28 (1991) (“[t]he requirement of action \nunder color of state law means that [the state official defendant] may be liable for discharging \nrespondents precisely because of her authority as auditor general. We cannot accept the novel \nproposition that this same official authority insulates [the defendant] from suit”). Any test that \nconsiders whether a state official’s challenged actions were part of their official duties will \ninvariably conclude that sovereign immunity applies because of the Section 1983 requirement \nthat mandates the challenged action be effectuated under color of state law.  \nClaims arising under Section 1983 to redress constitutional wrongs are, in other words, \ndistinguishable from statutory claims such as those arising under FLSA. If a state actor could \navoid liability for violating the constitution by claiming sovereign immunity, then any number of \nwrongs would go unvindicated. See Kolb v. State of Ohio, Dep’t of Mental Retardation & \nDevelopmental Disabilities, Cleveland Developmental Ctr., 721 F. Supp. 885, 897 (N.D. Ohio \n1989) (“The Supreme Court did not intend to adopt the ‘ultra vires’ theory advanced by the \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 67 Filed: 04/29/25 Page 6 of 11 PageID #:350\n \ndefendants. If such were the case, the Court would have effectively overruled several of its prior \ndecisions and established a new and completely unqualified requirement for pleading section \n1983 actions against state officials in their individual capacities.”). In fact, the Supreme Court \nhas never held that sovereign immunity shielded governmental actors from Section 1983 claims: \n“Nor have we ever held that a civil rights suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against a state officer in \nhis individual capacity implicates the Eleventh Amendment and a State’s sovereign immunity \nfrom suit.” Lewis, 581 U.S. at 166.  \nWhile true that it is Plaintiffs’ desire that, by bringing this lawsuit, they hope to “once \nand for all prevent more children from suffering wrongful incarceration while in DCFS care.” \nDkt. 1 ¶ 7. But the assertion that a problem is widespread or longstanding does not necessarily \nmean that an individual cannot be held liable for violating constitutional rights under Section \n1983, so long as the allegations are causally linked to the individual defendants, which here, as \nalleged, they are.  \nViewing the well-plead allegations in Plaintiffs’ favor, it is inaccurate to conclude that \nPlaintiffs’ claims amount to no more than “a generalized attack on a state agency,” Doyle v. \nCamelot Care Ctrs., Inc., 305 F.3d 603, 613 n.9 (7th Cir. 2002), particularly since Plaintiffs have \nplead specific allegations against the individual defendants for violations of their constitutional \nrights. See, e.g., Dkt. 1 ¶¶ 26-59. Rather, the allegations of the pervasive and wide-ranging \npractices and failures by the individual defendants in the Complaint support the notion that \nPlaintiffs’ claims warrant class-wide treatment. This does not mean that the individual \ndefendants are not potentially culpable.  \nMoreover, nothing in the Complaint suggests that DCFS or the State will need to expend \nor withhold money if Plaintiffs prevail, because the complained-of-conduct in Plaintiffs’ Section \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 67 Filed: 04/29/25 Page 7 of 11 PageID #:351\n \n1983 claim is linked to the actions of the individual defendants, not the state. See id. Relatedly, at \nleast at this stage of litigation, Defendants have not proven that the relief Plaintiffs seek \n(including, for example, that the individual defendants had the ability to develop more placement \ncapacity or resources) will require the state to expend more money than already provided to \nDCFS to fulfill its obligations to Plaintiffs. In fact, as pled, housing the putative class members \noutside the juvenile detention center will save taxpayer dollars, and actually require fewer \nresources from the State. Dkt. 1 at ¶¶ 92-96.  \nC.  Seventh Circuit Law Imposes Individual Liability So Long as Part of the Relief \nSought Will Not Come from the State \n \nConsistent with the Supreme Court’s decision in Lewis, the Seventh Circuit and other \njurisdictions look to the relief sought by the plaintiff to conclude that so long as some measure of \nrelief will not come from the State itself, the claims are not barred by sovereign immunity. And \nas the Supreme Court has explicitly held, “damages awards against individual defendants in \nfederal courts are a permissible remedy in some circumstances notwithstanding the fact that they \nhold public office. That is, the Eleventh Amendment does not erect a barrier against suits to \nimpose individual and personal liability on state officials under § 1983.” Hafer, 502 U.S. at 30–\n31 (internal citations omitted).  \nA comparable case from this district, Safari Childcare Inc. v. Penny, is instructive. No. \n17 C 8547, 2019 WL 3554993, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 2, 2019). In that case, the plaintiffs \nadvanced a Section 1983 against individual defendants employed by DCFS. See id. In denying \nthe defendants’ motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ Section 1983 claims based on sovereign \nimmunity, the court held:  \nAlthough Plaintiffs’ allegations concern actions that individual DCFS \nemployees allegedly took on DCFS’s behalf, this suit does not challenge the \nminimum requirements for operating a licensed daycare …but rather maintain \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 67 Filed: 04/29/25 Page 8 of 11 PageID #:352\n \nthat the DCFS employees selectively enforced those rules against Safari \ndaycare centers on constitutionally impermissible grounds…That is the \nhallmark of individual capacity claims not barred by sovereign immunity.  \n \nId; see Kroll v. Bd. of Trs. of the Univ. of Ill., 934 F.2d 904, 907 (7th Cir. 1991) (“Personal-\ncapacity suits raise no eleventh amendment issues even though an official might have the \nrequisite nexus to the state in order for his or her actions to be labelled state action.”); Osteen v. \nHenley, 13 F.3d 221, 224 (7th Cir. 1993) (“Insofar as the defendants are also being sued for \ndamages in their individual capacity, the Eleventh Amendment does not bar the suit.”). The court \nalso noted that defendants’ contention that the suit was “in essence” against the state ignored the \nmyriad of “paragraphs of allegations that specify which individual Defendants did what.” Id; see, \ne.g., Dkt. 1 ¶¶ 26-59. \nIn a similar vein, courts have looked to demands for punitive damages as indicative that \nthe claims should not be barred by sovereign immunity: \nMoreover, Reinebold seeks not only compensatory damages, but punitive \ndamages against Bruce and Norris as well. This detail further sets his case apart \nfrom Omosegbon, Haynes, and Harden, yet goes unmentioned by Defendants in \ntheir briefing. Courts have allowed individual capacity claims to proceed where a \nplaintiff seeks both punitive and compensatory damages, because punitive \ndamages “may be available from the Defendants sued in their individual capacity \nbut not from the state, which is immune to suit except for [injunctive relief \nthrough the Ex Parte Young doctrine].” Doe, 2019 WL 1369348, at *3 (emphasis \nadded); see also Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 35-36 (1983) (holding that \nindividual officers may be liable for punitive damages under § 1983); Bornick v. \nSondalle, 179 F. Supp. 2d 941, 949 (E.D. Wis. 2001) (“Punitive damages are \nindicative of an individual capacity claim.”). \n \nReinebold v. Indiana Univ. at S. Bend, No. 3:18-CV-525 JD, 2019 WL 1897288, at *3 (N.D. Ind. \nApr. 25, 2019). Similarly, Plaintiffs are seeking punitive damages from the individual defendants \nbecause the Section 1983 claim is averred against the individual defendants in this action. See \nKolb., 721 F. Supp. at 895 ) (“Individual capacity suits, however, do not seek recovery of money \nfrom the state. Therefore, the Eleventh Amendment does not bar actions for money damages \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 67 Filed: 04/29/25 Page 9 of 11 PageID #:353\n \narising from constitutional torts committed by state officials who are then sued in their individual \ncapacities in federal court”). \nUltimately, Plaintiffs seek damages from the individual defendants themselves for \nviolating Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, not the State, and the judgment sought will therefore \n“not expend itself on the public treasury or domain, or interfere with the public administration.” \nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 101 n.11 (1984); see also Lewis, 581 \nU.S. at 165 (“the critical inquiry is who may be legally bound by the court’s adverse judgment, \nnot who will ultimately pick up the tab”). By contrast, a damage award in FLSA action against a \nstate employer such as in Martin would necessarily require the state—not the individual \nsupervisor—to be legally bound by the judgment if the plaintiff were to prevail. See, e.g., Mestek \nv. LAC Courte Oreilles Cmty. Health Ctr., 72 F.4th 255, 262 (7th Cir. 2023) (“These principles \nfind straightforward application here and show why Mestek’s claims are against the employee \ndefendants only in their official capacities. In her complaint, Mestek requested front pay, back \npay, damages, reinstatement, and injunctive relief prohibiting the defendants from blacklisting or \nretaliating against her. Critically, however, any monetary relief would come from the Health \nCenter’s coffers. And reinstatement, as well, would likewise require action on the part of the \nHealth Center, not the individual defendants.”). This distinction clearly indicates that Plaintiffs’ \nSection 1983 claims are averred against the individual defendants, not the State.  \nIn dismissing Plaintiffs’ Section 1983 claim, this Court also relied on the Seventh Circuit \nunpublished opinion in Genskow, where the court held that the individual tribal officers were not \nthe real parties in interest in a Section 1983 suit because, in carrying out the alleged \nconstitutional violation, they were merely following the tribal “Chairman’s directive, [and] the \nofficers were acting merely as ‘an arm or instrumentality’ of the tribe.” Genskow v. Prevost, 825 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 67 Filed: 04/29/25 Page 10 of 11 PageID #:354\n \nF. App’x 388, 391 (7th Cir. 2020). But that case is distinguishable. Unlike in Genskow, where \nthe actions of the defendants were “in essence” the tribe’s, the actions of the individual \ndefendants here are not attributable to the State directly. There, the defendant officers removed \nthe plaintiff from a tribal meeting, allegedly in violation of her constitutional rights. The Seventh \nCircuit held, in part, that “because the tribal officers were acting not under color of state law, but \nrather in their official duties toward a tribal member on the tribe’s own land,” the suit was barred \nby sovereign immunity. Id. at 390. “Allowing [that] suit to proceed would be at odds with tribal \nself-government and undermine the authority of tribal forums.” Id.  \nInstead, the allegations here assert that the individual defendants are acting under color of \nstate law in violating Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, which is not at odds with the State’s \nsovereign immunity—otherwise, Plaintiffs would have no cause of action under Section 1983 \nagainst these defendants. See Lewis, 581 U.S. at 166 (“We have not before treated a lawsuit \nagainst an individual employee as one against a state instrumentality, and Clarke offers no \npersuasive reason to do so now”).  \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons above, Plaintiffs respectfully move the Court to reconsider its ruling \ndismissing Plaintiffs’ Section 1983 claim. \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, \n \n/s/ Fatima Ladha \nAttorney for Plaintiff \n   \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 67 Filed: 04/29/25 Page 11 of 11 PageID #:355\n \nDate: April 28, 2025 \nJon Loevy \nRussell Ainsworth \nMegan Pierce \nFatima Ladha \nLOEVY & LOEVY \n311 North Aberdeen, 3rd Floor \nChicago, IL 60607 \n(312) 243-5900  \n ",

Pacold  \n)  Magistrate Judge Gabriel A. Fuentes \nMARC D. SMITH, ET AL., \n) \n   \n) \nDefendants.   \n) \n   \n \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STAY DISCOVERY PENDING RESOLUTION OF \n \nTHEIR MOTION TO DISMISS AND MOTION TO STRIKE CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n \nPlaintiffs allege that the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (“DCFS”) \ndoes not have, and for at least 35 years has not had, enough placements for children who are \nwards of DCFS, specifically those who are awaiting adjudication for juvenile delinquency at the \nCook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center.  Dkt. 1, Cmplt. ¶ 29, 30, 60, 66, 67, 81.  On \nbehalf of a putative class, Plaintiffs advance a novel theory that they can obtain money damages \nfrom DCFS, and its current and recent Directors and other senior agency leadership, for this \nalleged systemic shortage of placement options.  Defendants have moved to dismiss on the \ngrounds that such damages claims against DCFS and its senior leadership are barred by the \nEleventh Amendment and qualified immunity, in addition to other fatal pleading deficiencies; \nDefendants also have moved to strike the class allegations as facially and inherently deficient.  \nDkt. 16.  Under these circumstances – where the motion to dismiss may resolve the entire case \nand threshold immunity questions are appropriately raised – the Court should stay discovery \npending a ruling on Defendants’ motion.   \n \n1 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 24 Filed: 07/11/23 Page 2 of 7 PageID #:168\nARGUMENT \n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 gives courts “broad discretion to tailor discovery \nnarrowly and to dictate the sequence of discovery.” See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c), (d); Crawford-El \nv. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 599 (1998).  Stays of discovery pending a ruling on a motion to dismiss \nare “granted with substantial frequency.”  Bilal v. Wolf, No. 06 C 6978, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n41983, at *3–4 (N.D. Ill. June 6, 2007).  Such stays are “not disfavored and are often appropriate \nwhere the motion to dismiss can resolve the case – at least as to the moving party.”  Id.  In \ndeciding whether to stay discovery, courts consider whether a stay will: (1) “simplify the issues \nin question and streamline the trial,” (2) “unduly prejudice or tactically disadvantage the non-\nmoving party,” and (3) “reduce the burden of litigation on the parties and on the court.” \nRodriguez v. Ford Motor Co., No. 21 C 2553, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41641, at *4 (N.D. Ill. \nMar. 9, 2022).  Here, all three factors support a stay of discovery. \n1.  Simplify the Issues \nThe first factor, which considers whether a stay will simplify the issues, weighs heavily \nin favor of staying discovery.  Stays are “often appropriate” where a motion to dismiss can \nresolve the entire case, where the defendant has raised an immunity defense, or where the issue \npresented by the motion is a threshold one.  See Bilal, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41983, at *4. \n“[T]he fact that the issues raised could potentially be dispositive weighs in favor of staying \ndiscovery.”  Rodriguez, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41641, at *4; see also Sadler v. Retail Props. of \nAm., No. 12 C 5882, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 206557, at *8 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 27, 2013) (staying \ndiscovery because defendants filed motions to dismiss that were “potentially dispositive” and \n“not frivolous”). \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss raises two threshold immunity issues.  First, as detailed in \nthe motion to dismiss, Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.  “The basic thrust of the \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 24 Filed: 07/11/23 Page 3 of 7 PageID #:169\nqualified-immunity doctrine is to free officials from the concerns of litigation, including \navoidance of disruptive discovery.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 685 (2009) (internal \ncitations omitted); see also Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 232 (2009) (providing that \nqualified immunity and the other immunities were created to “ensure that insubstantial claims \nagainst government officials [will] be resolved prior to discovery” and that the question of \nqualified immunity should be resolved at the earliest possible stage in litigation) (internal \ncitations omitted); Crawford-El, 523 U.S. at 597-98 (a trial court “must exercise its discretion in \na way that protects the substance of the qualified immunity defense. It must exercise its \ndiscretion so that officials are not subjected to unnecessary and burdensome discovery or trial \nproceedings.”).  “[T]rial courts not only may but should decide the legal issue of qualified \nimmunity in § 1983 cases before allowing discovery.”  Landstrom v. Illinois Dep’t of Children & \nFamily Services, 892 F.2d 670, 674 (7th Cir. 1990) (citation omitted); Carswell v. Camp, 54 \nF.4th 307, 312 (5th Cir. 2022) (cleaned up and citation omitted) (“When defendants assert \nqualified immunity in a motion to dismiss, the district court may not defer ruling on that \nassertion. It may not permit discovery—cabined or otherwise—against immunity-asserting \ndefendants before it has determined plaintiffs have pleaded facts sufficient to overcome the \ndefense.  The rule is that a defendant’s entitlement to qualified immunity should be determined at \nthe earliest possible stage of the litigation—full stop.”).  Resolution of qualified immunity before \ndiscovery will simplify the issues “because the costs and burdens of discovery may prove \nunnecessary if the motion to dismiss is granted” on that basis.  Liggins v. Reicks, No. 19-50303, \n2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127302, *7 (N.D. Ill. July 8, 2021).   \nDefendants also are entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, as their motion explains.  \nSuch immunity similarly “is an immunity from suit (including discovery), not just liability.  \nWhere sovereign immunity applies, it applies totally.  Plaintiffs stop at the Rule 12(b)(1) stage \n  3 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 24 Filed: 07/11/23 Page 4 of 7 PageID #:170\nand don’t get discovery. They don’t pass go.”  Massey v. Willard, No. 22-3924, 2023 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 14889, *3 (E.D. La. Jan. 30, 2023) (citation omitted).  The Eleventh Amendment defense \nsimilarly supports a stay of discovery pending resolution of the motion to dismiss.  Id. \n  While Plaintiffs’ complaint purports to advance claims under the Rehabilitation Act and \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) that would not be disposed of by the Eleventh \nAmendment and qualified immunity arguments, the case nonetheless will be simplified greatly if \nPlaintiffs’ § 1983 claims are dismissed on immunity grounds.  And Defendants have raised other \ndispositive arguments for the purported Rehabilitation Act and ADA claims, such that \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss, if granted in full, will resolve the entire case including both \nconstitutional and statutory claims.  The first factor weighs strongly in favor of a stay. \n2.  Undue Prejudice or Tactical Disadvantage \nThe second consideration also favors a stay, because Plaintiffs cannot show they would \nsuffer undue prejudice or tactical disadvantage while the Court considers Defendants’ motion to \ndismiss.  Time required to determine a pending motion to dismiss by itself “does not constitute \nundue prejudice.” See, e.g., Black & Decker, Inc. v. Positec USA, Inc., No. 13 C 3075, 2013 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 153795, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 1, 2013); see also Nat’l Police Ass’n v. Gannett Co., \nNo. 21 C 1116, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 224410, at *6 (S.D. Ind. Oct. 25, 2021) (“[W]hile a stay \nnecessarily slows the progression of a case, a short delay on its own does not constitute undue \nprejudice.”). Where, as here, a motion to dismiss raises threshold issues that could dispose of the \nentire case, “a small delay in discovery while awaiting adjudication of the motion is reasonable” \nand “will not unduly prejudice any party.”  In re Clearview AI, No. 21 C 135, 2021 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 238261, at *7 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 31, 2021).  This factor also counsels in favor of a stay. \n \n \n  4 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 24 Filed: 07/11/23 Page 5 of 7 PageID #:171\n3.  Burden of Litigation on the Parties and the Court \n“District courts have stayed discovery in a variety of complex cases.” Coss v. Playtex \nProds., LLC, No. 08 C 50222, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42933, at *9 (N.D. Ill. May 21, 2009). \nThis includes putative class actions, where discovery can be especially burdensome.  Rodriguez, \n2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41641, at *4 (“Given the burden, time, and expense often associated with \nresponding to discovery in a putative class action, courts regularly stay discovery pending a \nruling on a motion to dismiss.”).  Granting a stay here will ensure that Defendants, who are \ncurrent and former state officials and a state agency, are not forced to expend time and resources \non discovery that will have been unnecessary if the Court dismisses the case.  See Ashcroft v. \nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 685 (2009) (noting that litigation “exacts heavy costs in terms of efficiency \nand expenditure of valuable time and resources that might otherwise be directed to the proper \nexecution of the work of the Government”). \nHere, Defendants have moved not only to dismiss each of the Plaintiffs’ claims, but \nDefendants also moved to strike the putative class claims.  While Defendants’ motion may \ndispose of the entire case, even if the motion is not granted in full, it will dictate the scope and \nappropriate sequencing of discovery.  See Rodriguez, 2022 WL 704780, at *2 (“stay will reduce \nthe burden on the parties” because ruling on motion to dismiss “could greatly affect the cost and \nscope of discovery”).  For instance, if qualified immunity is not resolved on the pleadings, it may \nbe appropriate to focus discovery first on that immunity question.  See Crawford-El, 523 U.S. at \n599-600 (“Of course, the judge should give priority to discovery concerning issues that bear \nupon the qualified immunity defense, such as the actions that the official actually took, since that \ndefense should be resolved as early as possible.”).  And resolution of the pending motion will \ndetermine whether class discovery is needed (if the class allegations are stricken), or if class \ndiscovery should proceed quickly (after qualified immunity) to resolve the class issue at the \n  5 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 24 Filed: 07/11/23 Page 6 of 7 PageID #:172\nearliest possible juncture.  See Lake v. Unilever U.S., Inc., No. 12-6058, 964 F. Supp. 2d 893, \n933 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 7, 2013) (bifurcating class and merits discovery when doing so “will allow \nthe Court to reach a decision on the issue of class certification more expeditiously than it \notherwise would, as proceeding with merits discovery may delay the parties’ submission of their \nbriefs on the class certification issue”).  If discovery proceeds before the clarity that resolution of \nthe motion to dismiss and motion to strike class allegations will provide, the parties will be \nburdened by discovery that may not even be relevant to the surviving claims, if any survive.  \nThis third factor counsels strongly in favor of a stay. \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, this Court should stay discovery in this case pending a ruling on \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss and to strike class allegations. \n \nDated:  July 11, 2023         Respectfully submitted, \n \nBarbara L.

This action challenges the policies and practices promulgated by the Defendants, \nacting within the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), that cause \nchildren to be locked in juvenile jail after a court has ordered them to be released upon the \nrequest of their guardian, DCFS. \n2.  Each class member was in DCFS’s care and, at some point, came in contact with \nthe juvenile justice system and was placed in a juvenile jail. After a court ordered the children \nreleased to their guardian—also known as release upon request (RUR)—the Defendants failed to \nplace these children in a safe and appropriate environment, instead causing them to remain \nwrongfully incarcerated. \n3.  The Constitution and federal law require the Defendants, as responsible state \nofficials entrusted with the care of vulnerable children, to ensure that the class members are not \nlocked in jail after an order for their release has issued. This is particularly important because \nnearly every child in DCFS care has experienced significant trauma in their life and is in need of \nsignificant supports and services. \n4.  The damage caused by unjustly incarcerating these children is tremendous and \nundeniable. These children are isolated from loved ones and support systems. They are deprived \nof the everyday joys, experiences, and opportunities of childhood. Indeed, children incarcerated \nin juvenile jail are confined to their cells for the majority of the day, have limited opportunities to \nexercise, and are exposed to unnecessary violence and dangers. Moreover, DCFS is unable to \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 3 of 32 PageID #:3\nprovide them the clinically appropriate mental health treatment and educational services that they \nneed—critical resources for children who have suffered trauma and instability.    \n5.  This practice of wrongfully incarcerating children in DCFS care has been public \nknowledge for decades. Moreover, for years DCFS has tracked children in its care who remain \nincarcerated with RUR orders, such that Defendants have had direct knowledge of each and \nevery class member who has been wrongfully incarcerated despite an order for their release. \n6.  Despite this knowledge, Defendants have done absolutely nothing to end the \npractice. \n7.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek damages from Defendants in hopes that this lawsuit \nwill once and for all prevent more children from suffering wrongful incarceration while in DCFS \ncare. \nJurisdiction and Venue \n8.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343, \nas Plaintiffs assert claims under federal law and to redress the deprivation of their rights secured \nby the United States Constitution.  \n9.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) as, on information and belief, one or \nmore of Defendants reside in this judicial district, Defendant Illinois Department of Children and \nFamily Services conducts extensive operations in this judicial district, and a substantial part of \nthe events giving rise to the claims occurred in this judicial district. \nPlaintiffs \n10.  Named Plaintiff Charles Golbert is the Cook County Public Guardian. By orders \nof the Chief Judge of the Cook County Circuit Court and the Presiding Judge of the Juvenile \nJustice and Child Protection Division of the Circuit Court (“Juvenile Court”), Mr. Golbert is \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 4 of 32 PageID #:4\nappointed attorney and guardian ad litem for the children who are the subjects of abuse, neglect, \nand dependency petitions filed in Juvenile Court. Mr. Golbert has extensive experience in child \nwelfare and civil rights litigation. The Public Guardian brings this suit as next friend on behalf of \nhis child clients and class representatives John, Kate, Michael, David, James, Jordan, and \nThomas. \n11.  Class Representative John is a minor in the care of Illinois DCFS. John was jailed \nat the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC) for five and a half months in \n2021 and 2022, despite having a court order in place for his release upon request (RUR) during \nthe entirety of that period. While wrongfully incarcerated, John was not able to receive critical \nservices for his rehabilitation and development. For example, John has attention-\ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and borderline intellectual functioning diagnoses. He \nrequires an Individualized Education Program (IEP) to accommodate his educational needs, but \nwas not able to receive necessary educational services during his incarceration. In fact, John \nneeded glasses so he could participate meaningfully in school and receive an updated IEP, but \nhis incarceration prevented him from getting a needed eye exam. John is very close with his \nfamily, especially his mother, but was able to have only very limited interactions with his family \nduring his incarceration. John has several mental health diagnoses, including depressive disorder, \nconduct disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, and oppositional defiance disorder. \nDespite this, DCFS failed to provide John with needed mental health care during his \nincarceration, including medication monitoring, therapy, and anger management. John’s mental \nhealth issues have been exacerbated by his wrongful incarceration at JTDC. \n12.  Class Representative Janiah was a minor in the care of Illinois DCFS at all times \nrelevant to the events in this Complaint. Janiah entered DCFS care due to a history of physical \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 5 of 32 PageID #:5\nabuse. Janiah was wrongfully incarcerated in JTDC for a shocking 166 days over a one-year \nperiod. An RUR order was in place for the entirety of these 166 days but, in violation of her \nrights, DCFS left her to languish in juvenile jail. Janiah has been diagnosed with ADHD, bipolar \ndisorder, and depression. Janiah has a history of significant trauma, yet was unable to get the \nindividual therapy, psychiatric treatment, and other mental health services that she needed while \nwrongfully incarcerated. She was also not able to engage in normal teenage activities, like \ngetting a driver’s license, or to learn skills to live independently like cooking. While \nincarcerated, Janiah lost her grandmother, with whom she was very close, and she was deeply \nupset by her inability to spend time with family and friends, especially during the holidays. \nIncarceration has caused a significant deterioration in her mental health and has put her safety at \nrisk. \n13.  Class Representative Kate is a minor in the care of Illinois DCFS. In early 2022, \nKate spent just shy of two months in JTDC despite an existing RUR order. And then in August \n2022, Kate was again incarcerated in juvenile jail despite having an RUR order. In response to a \nmotion to end Kate’s wrongful incarceration, the court ordered DCFS to place Kate in \nspecialized foster care by mid-September 2022. DCFS flouted this order and continued to \nwrongfully incarcerate Kate until November, for a total of more than three months of wrongful \nincarceration. Kate has been diagnosed with ADHD, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTDS), \nmood dysregulation disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). While wrongfully \nincarcerated, Kate was not able to receive necessary and intensive mental health services.  \n14.  Class Representative Michael is a minor in the care of Illinois DCFS. Michael has \nbeen diagnosed with major depression and has a history of suicidal ideations. Michael spent 45 \ncontinuous days in JTDC despite a court order for his release. Michael, a very bright young man, \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 6 of 32 PageID #:6\nwas not able to receive appropriate educational services while incarcerated. Indeed, Michael \nmissed out on an entire quarter of his junior year—credits he had to make up. In addition to \nfalling behind academically, Michael was not able to participate in school social activities that he \ngreatly enjoys (like pep rallies) and afterschool athletic activities while he was wrongfully \nincarcerated. And Michael’s incarceration disrupted and undermined the strong bonds he was \nable to form with faculty at his school prior to his wrongful incarceration. Michael missed his \nsiblings and was unable to attend his sister’s birthday while he was wrongfully confined at \nJTDC. His wrongful incarceration greatly affected his mental health. At times, Michael worried \nthat DCFS would never find a placement for him. \n15.  Class Representative David is a minor in the care of Illinois DCFS. Like many \nchildren in DCFS care, David has a serious history of trauma and abuse. He has been diagnosed \nwith adjustment disorder. David spent 86 continuous days in JTDC despite an existing RUR \norder. During his wrongful incarceration, David was not able to receive services critical for his \nwellbeing and rehabilitation. For example, David was not able to receive help for his substance \nabuse issues, nor did he receive individual therapy. Prior to his incarceration, he attended a \nparochial school where he was a bright and engaged student and had a strong relationship with \nthe principal. But during his wrongful incarceration, he was denied the opportunity to continue \nhis education at the school. David was not able to have visits with his younger brother, with \nwhom he is very close, while incarcerated.  \n16.  Class Representative James is a minor in the care of Illinois DCFS. James has \nbeen diagnosed with ODD, PTSD, ADHD, language disorder, several learning disabilities, and a \nmood disorder. James has a long history of physical abuse, and his mental health and behavioral \nissues are linked to this history. James—a sixteen-year-old kid—has already been held with an \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 7 of 32 PageID #:7\nRUR order four times, for a staggering total of more than 240 days. James’s wrongful \nincarceration significantly exacerbated his trauma and caused his mental health to deteriorate, \nundermining his safety and stability. Moreover, James has an IEP to address his multiple \nlearning disabilities, and he was recommended to have specific special educational services, \nincluding multi-sensory instruction in all subject areas; but while James was incarcerated, he did \nnot have access to necessary educational and other services. \n17.  Class Representative Jordan is a minor in the care of Illinois DCFS. Jordan has \nbeen incarcerated despite an RUR order on four separate occasions. During two of these \nwrongful incarcerations, Jordan was just 13 years old. In total, he has spent more than 150 days \nin jail when he should have been in an appropriate placement with appropriate services and \nsupports. Jordan’s wrongful incarceration in juvenile jail was extremely harmful to him—he was \nnot able to get several assessments and evaluations that he needed for his IEP. He was also not \nable to receive other needed services, including trauma-focused individual therapy, family \ntherapy, and mentoring. Indeed, the effects of Jordan’s trauma have been exacerbated during his \nincarceration. Jordan’s incarceration has further prevented him from engaging in recreational \nactivities, which are critical to helping him build stability and directing him toward a more \npositive future. And while Jordan has a strong relationship with his family—he particularly \nenjoys cooking with his grandmother and mother—he was unable to visit with his family or \nfriends while incarcerated. \n18.  Class Representative Thomas is a minor in the care of Illinois DCFS. He has been \ndiagnosed with ADHD and intermittent explosive disorder. On three separate occasions, Thomas \nhas been incarcerated in juvenile jail despite an existing RUR order; in total, he has been \nwrongfully incarcerated for more than 7 months. While incarcerated, Thomas was not able to \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 8 of 32 PageID #:8\nreceive the mental health services that he needs, causing his mental health to deteriorate. Thomas \nwas incarcerated for his fourteenth birthday and was unable to celebrate holidays and milestones \nwith loved ones. He was deeply affected by his inability to participate in normal childhood \nactivities and to spend time with his friends and family.  \n19.  Class Representative Elliot was in the care of Illinois DCFS at all times relevant \nto the events in this Complaint, and was a minor for at least some of that period. Elliot has been \ndiagnosed with depressive disorder, neurodevelopmental disorder, ADHD, and disruptive mood \ndysregulation disorder. Elliot has a history of significant trauma. Elliot spent just shy of seven \nstraight months in JTDC despite having an RUR order. While incarcerated, Elliot’s separation \nfrom his family caused him to suffer greatly. Elliot’s grandmother passed away, and he could not \nadequately grieve the loss of his grandmother or lay her to rest with the rest of his family. For at \nleast five months of his wrongful incarceration, he was able to have only limited visits with his \nsiblings. Elliot was even separated from his siblings on the first anniversary of their parents’ \ndeath, and he had to process that pain alone. Elliot had hoped to work toward his independence, \nbut he was not able to pursue employment or engage in any recreational activities available to \nother children his age while wrongfully incarcerated. Elliot’s mental health severely deteriorated \nwhile he was incarcerated, and he routinely pleaded with DCFS for his release. \nDCFS and the RUR Problems \n20.  Defendant Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (“DCFS”) is the \nstate agency designated to administer and supervise the administration of child welfare services. \nApproximately one-third of its annual budget is obtained from federal funds, primarily through \nTitle IV-E of the Social Security Act, which matches money for state spending on foster care. \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 9 of 32 PageID #:9\n21.  The Children and Family Services Act (20 ILCS 505/7) mandates that DCFS \nplace each of the children in its care in safe and adequate placements, consistent with each \nchild’s health, safety and best interests. \n22.  DCFS assumes responsibility for the placement and care of a child after a court \nhas determined there is a lawful basis for the State to assume guardianship over the child, \nincluding, for example, where there is sufficient evidence that the child is abused, neglected or \notherwise dependent on the State for care. DCFS then has the responsibility to house each child \nin the least restrictive (most family-like) setting that is in the child’s best interest. \n23.  Children in the care and custody of DCFS—almost all of whom have experienced \nsignificant trauma in their short lives—at times come into contact with the juvenile justice \nsystem. Sometimes these children are already wards of the State when they are adjudicated \ndelinquent and incarcerated in a juvenile jail. Others become wards of the State only after their \nadjudication and detention.  \n24.  These children should be incarcerated in juvenile jails only pursuant to court \norder.  \n25.  Yet countless children in DCFS care who are ordered RUR are left languishing in \njuvenile jail for weeks or even months by DCFS. This is part of a widespread and disturbing \npractice, going back more than 30 years and continuing to this day, whereby DCFS is wrongfully \nincarcerating children in its care. \nDefendants Each Have the Obligation and Authority to Place Children in the Least \nRestrictive Setting to Ensure their Health, Safety, and Best Interests \n26.  Each of the Individual Defendants in this lawsuit served as a DCFS official with \ndirect and/or supervisory responsibility and authority for ensuring the healthy, safe, and \nappropriate placement of children in DCFS care, as described in detail below. Each of the \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 10 of 32 PageID #:10\nDefendants described below acted under color of law and within the scope of their employment \nat all times relevant to the allegations in the Complaint. \n27.  Marc D. Smith served as DCFS Director from approximately April 2019 to the \npresent. Debra Dyer-Webster served as DCFS Director from approximately February to April \n2019. Beverly J. Walker served as DCFS Director from approximately June 2017 to February \n2019. Collectively, Smith, Dyer-Webster, and Walker are referred to as “the Director \nDefendants.” \n28.  The DCFS Director Defendants were responsible for ensuring that all DCFS \nprograms comply with state and federal law and the U.S. Constitution. The DCFS Director must \nensure that all children in DCFS care or under its guardianship are safe, appropriately placed, \nand receiving appropriate and timely supports and services. \n29.  In their capacity serving as DCFS Director, the Director Defendants had the legal \nauthority to increase the existing number of residential and other placements—including but not \nlimited to entering into contracts to develop new placements—in order to provide safe and \nappropriate placements for every child incarcerated in juvenile jail despite an order for their \nrelease. \n30.  The Director Defendants also had the authority to direct their subordinates to \nincrease the existing number of residential and other placements and develop new placements—\nincluding but not limited to entering into contracts to develop new placements—in order to \nprovide safe and appropriate placements for children incarcerated in juvenile jail despite an order \nfor their release. \n31.  Through reports of placement outcomes from subordinates and other sources \ndiscussed in more detail below, the Director Defendants were aware of the widespread problem \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 11 of 32 PageID #:11\nof children being held in juvenile jails despite RUR orders, including the failure to timely and \nappropriately place each and every class member. \n32.  Despite this knowledge, the Director Defendants failed to take available and \nnecessary steps to ensure that all children in DCFS care with an order for their release from \njuvenile jail had ready and appropriate placements. \n33.  Defendant Lauren Williams served as Associate Deputy Director of Community \nResources Management during the class period.2 \n34.  In her capacity as Associate Deputy Director of Community Resources \nManagement, Williams was responsible for developing policies and procedures for placing \nchildren in DCFS care, especially children with significant emotional and behavioral needs; \nimplementing a system to track referrals to placement providers and determine outcomes; \nidentifying placement gaps; and analyzing placement data and identifying trends and issues.  \n35.  Williams was also responsible for notifying executive staff (including the \nDirector) and central and regional management about placement outcomes and making policy \nchanges to address placement gaps. \n36.  Williams was also responsible for supervising the DCFS’s Central Matching Unit \nand, in that capacity, for ensuring that every child had an appropriate placement upon release \nfrom a jail or detention center. \n37.  In short, Williams was aware of each and every child in DCFS care that remained \nincarcerated despite an order for their release, including each Plaintiff and class member, and \nWilliams had the ability and authority to create or amend DCFS policies so that placements were \n \n2 This position was formerly titled Associate Deputy Director of Placement Resources. \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 12 of 32 PageID #:12\ntimely located for children in DCFS care who were ordered or soon to be ordered released from \njuvenile jail. \n38.  Williams, as supervisor of the Central Matching Unit, also had the ability and \nauthority to create or locate (or direct subordinates to create or locate) appropriate placements \nand services for each Plaintiff and class member. \n39.  Despite this, Williams failed to ensure that policies and procedures were in place \nto appropriately and timely place children in DCFS care who had an RUR order. Indeed, DCFS \ndoes not begin the process of finding an appropriate placement for incarcerated children in its \ncare until the child is actually ordered to be released from juvenile jail. \n40.  Williams additionally failed to ensure that the Central Matching Unit timely \nmatched each Plaintiff and class member with appropriate placements and services.  \n41.  Ryan Goodwin and Antwan Turpeau both served as the Associate Deputy \nDirector of Delinquency Prevention during the class period. \n42.  As the Associate Deputy Director of Delinquency Prevention, Goodwin and \nTurpeau oversaw, among other things, the Dually Involved Youth Unit and were responsible for \nformulating and implementing policies to (1) ensure that necessary services and supports were \nprovided to dually involved youth and (2) promote the rehabilitation of those children.  \n43.  In their role as Associate Deputy Director of Delinquency Prevention, Goodwin \nand Turpeau had the authority and ability to add DCFS services and supports to placements for \nDually Involved Youth to ensure that those placements were appropriate and able to receive \nchildren ordered released from juvenile jails. \n44.  While serving as Associate Deputy Director of Delinquency Prevention, Goodwin \nand Turpeau regularly attended meetings where they were notified of each and every child in \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 13 of 32 PageID #:13\nDCFS care who was wrongfully incarcerated despite an existing RUR order, including each and \nevery Plaintiff and class member. \n45.  Despite being aware of the wrongful incarceration of each Plaintiff and class \nmember, Goodwin and Turpeau failed to take steps within their authority and ability to ensure \nthat available placements had the services and supports necessary to receive Plaintiffs and other \nclass members and to ensure that Plaintiffs and class members were in fact receiving necessary \nsupports and services. \n46.  Janet Wukas Ahern served as the Guardianship Administrator from November \n2017 through the present. \n47.  As DCFS Guardianship Administrator, Ahern is responsible for the wellbeing of \nall children in DCFS care, administers all DCFS programs related to guardianship, and evaluates \nand develops DCFS policy on the same topic.  \n48.  Through her role as Guardianship Administrator, Ahern had the authority and \nability to develop more placement capacity in existing placements, develop new placement \nresources including residential placements, and add supports to existing placements to ensure \nchildren did not stay incarcerated after receiving RUR orders. \n49.  In her position as Guardianship Administrator, Ahern was informed every time a \nchild in DCFS care, including each class member, continued to be incarcerated in a juvenile jail \ndespite having an RUR order. \n50.  Despite knowing that the Plaintiffs and class members were being held in juvenile \njail despite an order for their release and despite having the ability and authority to ensure that \nthey were timely and properly placed, Ahern failed to take steps to do so. \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 14 of 32 PageID #:14\n51.  Jacquelin Dortch, Keith Polan and Ashley Deckert each served as the Deputy \nDirector of Child Services during the class period. Collectively, Dortch, Polan and Deckert are \nreferred to as the “Child Services Defendants.” \n52.  The Child Services Defendants were responsible for contract implementation for \nall programs related to community resources, foster care, and residential treatment, as well as \nadvising executive staff and other DCFS management on implementation of the consent decree \nregarding the appropriate placement of all children in DCFS care. The Child Services Defendants \nalso oversaw DCFS Community Resources, Foster Care and Residential Recruitment, and \nDelinquency Prevention Programs. \n53.  The Child Services Defendants therefore had the ability and authority to develop \nmore placement capacity in existing placements, develop new placement resources including \nresidential placements, and add supports to existing placements to ensure children did not stay \nincarcerated after receiving RUR orders.  \n54.  Through their role at DCFS, the Child Services Defendants were aware of the \npervasive and serious problem of the wrongful incarceration of children in DCFS care. In fact, \nDefendant Dortch provided testimony and/or public statements on behalf of DCFS regarding \nDCFS’s failure to provide appropriate placements for incarcerated children who have an order \nfor their release. \n55.  Despite their knowledge of the widespread problem of wrongfully incarcerating \nchildren in DCFS care—including the unlawful incarceration of each Plaintiff and class \nmember— the Child Services Defendants failed to exercise their authority and take available \nsteps to correct the problem.  \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 15 of 32 PageID #:15\n56.  Sari Rowitz and Karen Austin-Antoine each served as the Clinical Placement \nManager in Cook County during the class period. \n57.  As the Clinical Placement Manager, Rowitz and Austin-Antoine were responsible \nfor, among other things, developing and managing DCFS’s Centralized Matching process; \nmanaging the placement of all children in DCFS care in Cook County; maintaining a working \nknowledge of all placements under contract with DCFS; formulating criteria to match children \nwith those placements; reviewing the sufficiency of placements; and creating new placements or \nadding services or capacity to existing placements to ensure that the needs of all children in \nDCFS care in Cook County are met. \n58.  In their role at DCFS, Rowitz and Austin-Antoine had the ability and authority to \nensure that there were policies and procedures in place to match all children in DCFS care with \nappropriate placements, to develop new placement resources including residential placements, \nand add supports to existing placements to ensure children did not stay incarcerated after \nreceiving RUR orders in Cook County. \n59.  In short, as Clinical Placement Managers, Rowitz and Austin-Antoine were aware \nof each and every Plaintiff and class member who was incarcerated in JTDC despite an order for \ntheir release, and failed to take necessary and available steps to timely place them in appropriate \nplacements. \n15 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 16 of 32 PageID #:16\nDefendants Were Aware of the Widespread and Longstanding RUR Problem in DCFS \n60.  Since as far back as at least 1988, DCFS administrators and staff were aware of a \ndisturbing practice: children in DCFS care were being held in juvenile jails long after courts \nordered their release.  \n61.  Each of the Defendants named in this lawsuit has been made aware of this \nlongstanding problem through their positions at DCFS, including through court filings and \nhearings, correspondence, meetings, internal data and reports, the legislature, media, and other \nsources. Nevertheless, the problem has continued unabated.  \n62.  In 1988, a class of children in DCFS care filed suit seeking injunctive relief \nagainst the agency, BH v. Johnson, Case No. 88 C 5599 (N.D. Ill.). Among other allegations, the \nchildren complained that they were being wrongfully imprisoned in juvenile jails. \n63.  Eventually, this Court entered a consent decree requiring DCFS to ensure that \nchildren are “timely and stably placed in safe and appropriate living arrangements” and in “the \nleast restrictive setting appropriate for the child.” \n64.  Sadly, that decree has been routinely ignored for many children over the ensuing \ndecades, including for every single Plaintiff and class member. \n65.  Since then, numerous court filings have continued to bring attention to and sought \nto remedy the fact that numerous children in DCFS care are regularly held in juvenile jails \ndespite court orders for their release.  \n66.  For example, a 2015 Emergency Motion to Enforce the Consent Decree advised \nthat DCFS’s own data showed an “acute shortage[] of adequate services and placements . . . \nresulting in hundreds of children in the State’s care being left to languish in psychiatric hospitals, \nshelters, detention centers and residential treatment centers long after DCFS knew the children \n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 17 of 32 PageID #:17\nneeded to be placed elsewhere.” The motion further stated that children were being \n“warehoused” in “correctional facilities for extended periods of time, long after those responsible \nfor their care acknowledge that the children need to be removed to appropriate settings.” \n67.  The Public Guardian’s Office has also continued to raise to DCFS the issue of \nchildren held in jail despite RUR orders. The examples listed below are a mere sample of the \nsteady stream of correspondence over the past several decades directed at senior DCFS officials, \nincluding Defendants, sounding the alarm bells about RUR problems at DCFS. \na.  In a 2006 letter to the DCFS Director, the Public Guardian described the results of \nan informal study that found children in DCFS care were being “maintained in \ncorrectional/detention facilities when they would be released if appropriately \nplaced,” warned of the irreparable damage resulting from this practice, and \ndemanded that the Director take immediate, concrete action to address the \nproblem. \nb.  A 2006 Placement Study Report from the Public Guardian similarly detailed this \nproblem, noting that at the time of the report, at least four children in DCFS care \nwere being wrongfully incarcerated in juvenile jails despite RUR orders. \nc.  In 2008, the Public Guardian sent a similar letter to the DCFS Director and other \nDCFS administrators, as well as the Court overseeing B.H., this time providing an \nexample of a child, Andre, who was unlawfully incarcerated in a juvenile jail for \nthree months because DCFS failed to locate an appropriate placement for him. \nWhile incarcerated, Andrew was allowed only limited time outside. \nd.  In March 2016, the Public Guardian sent another letter to the DCFS Director and \nGeneral Counsel as well as the Court overseeing B.H., emphasizing the shortage \n17 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 18 of 32 PageID #:18\nof placements and providing the example of a 15-year-old child, James, who had \nbeen improperly locked in a juvenile jail for over four months. The letter detailed \nspecific pilot programs that DCFS should implement in order to address this \nserious problem. \ne.  In June 2016, the Public Guardian wrote directly to the DCFS Director and \nGeneral Counsel, noting extreme concern about DCFS’s decision to close \nfacilities dedicated to children in DCFS care and reduce funding for existing \nplacements, identifying serious consequences (including a lack of appropriate \nplacements) that were likely to result for children in DCFS care. \nf.  In July 2016, the Public Guardian sent another letter to the DCFS Director, \nGeneral Counsel, Supervisory Regional Counsel, and the Court overseeing B.H., \nthis time providing an example of a child wrongfully held in a detention center for \nalmost two months (despite an existing court order for his release), warning about \nthe lack of adequate placements, and demanding action to address the problem. \ng.  In October 2016, public testimony from the Public Guardian to the Senate Human \nServices Sub-Committee on Issues Related to Illinois DCFS reiterated these \nproblems, highlighting the long waiting lists for much needed residential \ntreatment centers. Similar public testimony was provided to the Illinois Senate \nHuman Services Committee in May 2018. \nh.  Public testimony from the Public Guardian in April 2019 again decried DCFS’s \npractice of illegally incarcerating children in their care, providing a specific \nexample of a thirteen-year-old girl—a victim of physical and sexual abuse—who \nwas held in a juvenile jail for 36 days after the court ordered her release. \n18 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 19 of 32 PageID #:19\ni.  In November 2021, the Public Guardian wrote to DCFS General Counsel and the \nCourt overseeing B.H., again expressing extreme concern for “the dozens of \nchildren who remain incarcerated in Juvenile Detention Centers even though a \nJuvenile Judge has cleared the child for ‘release upon request’ of their guardian. . \n. . This can last for days, weeks or months. Of course, this is illegal, a profound \ncivil rights violation, and clinically devastating.” The letter further noted that 66 \nchildren in DCFS care were incarcerated after an order for their release during the \nfirst 10 months of 2021. At least 30 of these 66 children were unlawfully \nincarcerated for a month or longer.  \n68.  The Illinois Senate, acknowledging the seriousness of the problem, directed the \nAuditor General to conduct a performance audit of DCFS and to specifically examine the \nnumber of children who were held in detention facilities and other inappropriate placements. In \n2016, the Auditor General issued a report. This report found that, despite being well-aware of the \nproblem of children in its care being unlawfully incarcerated in juvenile jails after orders for \ntheir release, DCFS had taken no steps to track scheduled release dates for these children and had \nfailed to develop any procedures for placing children who are ready to leave juvenile detention \ncenters. The report further explained the reasons why children were being improperly \nincarcerated after an RUR order and found that (during the audit period) at least one child had \nbeen wrongfully incarcerated in a juvenile jail for as long as 315 days after a court ordered them \nRUR. \n69.  Starting in 2018, DCFS was required by Illinois law to submit annual reports to \nthe General Assembly that detailed, among other things, the number of children held in detention \n19 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 20 of 32 PageID #:20\ncenters after an order for release and simply because DCFS had failed to appropriately place \nthem.  \n70.  For example, DCFS reported that 42 children in DCFS care (some as young as \n13) were unlawfully incarcerated in juvenile jail between January 1 and June 30, 2018. And in \nfiscal year 2021, there were at least 66 such wrongfully incarcerated children; one child was only \n11 years old, and at least three children were wrongfully incarcerated for more than 10 months. \n71.  Additionally, a list is generated daily of all children who are being detained in \njuvenile jails despite having outstanding RUR orders. This list is sent to individuals within \nDCFS’s General Counsel’s office. Upon information and belief, these lists or the information \ntherein are shared with the DCFS Director and other Defendants. \n72.  Representatives of the DCFS Director attend regular meetings with JTDC where \nthey discuss the list of children who remain incarcerated despite RUR orders. DCFS also \nprovides weekly updates to the Juvenile Court regarding these children and any efforts being \nundertaken to find an appropriate placement for them. \n73.  For more than a decade, a committee focused on the issue of children held in \njuvenile jail despite RUR orders has met monthly to discuss the problem. Information about \nspecific incarcerated children with RUR orders is discussed at this meeting. The meeting has \nbeen attended regularly by Defendant Turpeau and then Defendant Goodwin, as well as \nRepresentatives of the DCFS Director, among others. \n74.  Additionally, various individuals within DCFS are obligated to track and compile \ndata regarding placement outcomes for children in DCFS care. For example, the Clinical \nPlacement Manger is responsible for tracking all referrals to placement providers, determining \noutcomes, identifying and analyzing trends from this data, making recommendations to address \n20 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 21 of 32 PageID #:21\nshortcomings, and providing routine reports regarding placement and service gaps, including for \nchildren who are held in juvenile jail solely because DCFS has failed to provide an appropriate \nplacement. These reports and data are provided to DCFS management, including the Director \nand Deputy Directors. \n75.  The practice of keeping kids in jail despite RUR orders has received significant \nmedia attention and public outcry. For example, following an investigation, WBEZ reported that \ndozens of children were being held in the JTDC for weeks or months after a judge ordered their \nrelease because their guardian—the State—failed to place them appropriately. Representatives of \nDCFS, including the Chief Deputy Director of Clinical and Child Services, provided statements \nfor the news reports, acknowledging the problem.  \n76.  Each Defendant was therefore aware of the pervasive and disturbing practice of \nwrongfully incarcerating children who are in DCFS care as well as the obvious and serious \nharms resulting from this practice. \n77.  Over the years, the problem of wrongfully incarcerated children in DCFS care has \ngrown, and each of the Defendants knew it. The problem exploded in 2018, with large numbers \nof children wrongfully incarcerated while in DCFS care.  \n78.  In 2021, the numbers were staggering. That year: \na.   There were more than 80 examples of children being incarcerated in the JTDC \ndespite having RUR orders. \nb.  Children who were incarcerated in JTDC despite having RUR orders were, on \naverage, wrongfully incarcerated for more than 40 continuous days at a time. \n21 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 22 of 32 PageID #:22\nc.  In total, children in DCFS care were incarcerated for more than 3,200 days in \nJTDC simply because DCFS did not provide timely and appropriate placements \nfor them.  \nDefendants’ Failure to Address the RUR Problem Constitutes Disability Discrimination \n79.  Many of Plaintiffs and class members were suffering from a disability at the time \nthey were wrongfully incarcerated in JTDC. Namely, many of the Plaintiffs and class members \nhad a mental health issue, intellectual disability, developmental disability and/or learning \ndisability at the time of their wrongful incarceration. \n80.  Defendants’ actions and failures to act, described in detail elsewhere in the \nComplaint, caused Plaintiffs and class members with disabilities to be wrongfully incarcerated in \nJTDC despite orders for their release because of their disabilities. While incarcerated, these \nPlaintiffs and other class members were deprived of needed recreational activities and other \nsupports and services. \n81.  Defendants’ failure to take the necessary, appropriate and available steps to \ndevelop sufficient placement capacity affected many children in DCFS care, but it had a \ndisproportionate impact on these Plaintiffs and class members due to their disability, causing \nunique categories and quanta of harms, including in many cases exacerbating the symptoms or \nseverity of their mental health challenges and/or setting back their education. \n82.  There is a direct causal link between Defendants’ failure to find an appropriate \nplacement for each disabled Plaintiff and class member, and those children’s disabilities. But for \ntheir disabilities, Defendants would have placed the children and their time wrongfully \nincarcerated with RUR orders would have been significantly reduced or eliminated entirely. \n22 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 23 of 32 PageID #:23\n83.  Indeed, but for their disabilities, disabled Plaintiffs and class members would not \nhave had to wait for a placement while incarcerated in juvenile jail, where they were not able to \nreceive needed mental health, educational, recreational and other services; isolated; and exposed \nto violence. \n84.  If Defendants had acted to provide reasonable modifications to their placement \nprocedures—for example, by adding additional supports to a placement such as one-on-one aides \nor additional funding for other programming or services—disabled Plaintiffs and class members \nwould have been placed sooner, significantly reducing or eliminating the time they were \nincarcerated with RUR orders. However, Defendants failed to reasonably modify these \nprocedures, such that Plaintiffs’ and class members’ disabilities caused them to be wrongfully \nincarcerated with RUR orders. \n85.  As described in detail elsewhere in this Complaint, Defendants knew about the \nproblem of children in DCFS care being held in jail with RUR orders; Defendants failed to take \nthe necessary, appropriate and available steps to solve this problem, despite knowing that these \nPlaintiffs and class members suffered from disabilities and that these failures to act would impact \nthem due to their disabilities.  \nUnlawfully Incarcerating RUR Children Costs Local Taxpayers Money \n86.  DCFS officials have pushed the false narrative that the practice of unlawfully \nincarcerating children in juvenile jails despite court orders for their release is unavoidable \nbecause the affected children have no other available placements when they are ready to be \ndischarged.  \n87.  Underlying this false narrative is the false premise that there is not enough money \nto provide adequate placements for RUR children. \n23 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 24 of 32 PageID #:24\n88.  First, a lack of funds is no defense to this suit. By statute, Defendants are \nempowered to spend whatever funds are necessary to find appropriate placements for every child \nin DCFS custody, including Plaintiffs and class members.  \n89.  Second, it is false that appropriate placements will cost more than leaving \nchildren to languish in JTDC. To the contrary, ending the unlawful incarceration of RUR \nchildren will actually save local taxpayer money. Indeed, the unlawful incarceration of RUR \nchildren is not only inhumane, it is fiscally irresponsible. \n90.  There are appropriate placements that can be created or made available for RUR \nchildren, and care providers are eager to work with DCFS to create more placements to meet any \ndemand. \n91.  Appropriate placements in residential treatment facilities for RUR children \ngenerally cost about $300-400 dollars per day, with 50% of that cost reimbursed by the federal \ngovernment. Therapeutic or specialized foster care for these children costs even less, and are \nsimilarly reimbursed by the federal government. \n92.  In contrast, the cost of incarcerating children in juvenile jail is well over $500 per \nday.  \n93.  And critically, unlike the costs of housing a child in foster care or residential \ntreatment facilities, NO portion of incarcerating a child in JTDC is reimbursed by the federal \ngovernment. \n94.  This means that wrongfully incarcerating RUR children in juvenile jail is more \nthan twice as expensive as every other Constitutionally permissible and appropriate placement \nfor these children. Even using conservative estimates, it costs local taxpayers approximately an \nextra $300 per day to wrongfully incarcerate a child in DCFS care (the difference between the \n24 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 25 of 32 PageID #:25\ncost to house a child in DCFS, and the cost to place a child in a residential treatment facility after \nfederal reimbursement).  \n95.  These costs add up quickly. Multiplying $300 by the 3,200 days children spent \nwrongfully incarcerated in the JTDC in 2021, DCFS’s illegal incarceration of children in its care \nin Cook County alone imposed an additional cost of almost one million dollars on local \ntaxpayers last year.  \n96.  In other words, DCFS wastes millions of local taxpayer dollars to harm the \nchildren in its custody and care. These figures do not include the added cost needed to repair the \nharm caused by wrongfully incarcerating children. In short, the practice of wrongfully \nincarcerating RUR children is both inhumane and fiscally irresponsible.  \nThe Harm Caused by Holding Children RUR \n97.  Wrongful incarceration during adolescence or young adulthood is associated with \nworse general health, stress-related illnesses, higher rates of depression and higher incidents of \nsuicidal thoughts during adulthood. \n98.  Children wrongly incarcerated in the Cook County JTDC—where all class \nmembers are wrongfully detained—spend much of the day locked in their small cells with only a \nmattress and a toilet.  \n99.  The longer these children are held in detention, the more they are exposed to \nviolence and threats of violence, increasing the risk that they will suffer emotional and physical \nharm. \n100.  Incarcerated children are strictly controlled. They have limited opportunities to \nengage in recreation. And the JTDC’s school curriculum and assessments are inappropriate for \nthe individual needs of the Plaintiffs. For example, James has an IEP to address his intellectual \n25 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 26 of 32 PageID #:26\ndisability, but he was not able to receive the recommended educational accommodations during \nthe approximately 5 months he was wrongfully imprisoned between June 2021 and June 2022. \n101.  Children incarcerated at JTDC have very limited opportunities to interact with \nfamily and other loved ones, including friends.  \n102.  These incarcerated children are also unable to access needed services and \nprogramming—especially mental health services which are desperately needed by a group of \nchildren who have suffered significant trauma; are separated from friends and loved ones; and \nare not able to engage in recreational activities that other children of their age enjoy.  \n103.  In short, wrongfully extended incarceration in JTDC causes significant harm to \nPlaintiffs and the class members, including exacerbating their trauma and mental health issues; \nsetting them back academically; interfering with relationships with loved ones; destabilizing \nthem and exposing them to violence and unsafe conditions; and depriving them of the joys and \nexperiences that all children should be free to enjoy, among other things. \n104.  Defendants’ decision to allow Plaintiffs and the class members to languish in \nJTDC without an end in sight also conveys a clear message to the children that they do not \nmatter. This indefinite incarceration imposes significant trauma on children who have already \nsuffered unstable family lives and who are dependent on the state to provide appropriate care.   \nClass Action Allegations \n105.  Plaintiff Golbert, on behalf of his child clients, John, Kate, Michael, David, \nJames, Jordan, and Thomas, and named Plaintiffs and class representatives Janiah and Elliot, \nbring this action on behalf of themselves and a class of those similarly situated, pursuant to Rule \n23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n106.  Plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of the following people: \n26 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 27 of 32 PageID #:27\nAll those who have been placed in the care or under the guardianship of DCFS at any \ntime on or after January 1, 2018 and who were incarcerated in juvenile jail for at least 7 \nconsecutive days after a court order for their release upon request and whose claims are not \nbarred by the applicable statute of limitations as of the date of filing of Plaintiffs’ original \ncomplaint. \n107.  Plaintiffs other than Jordan also seek to represent a subclass consisting of the \nfollowing people: \nAll those who have been placed in the care or under the guardianship of DCFS at any \ntime on or after January 1, 2018 and who were incarcerated in juvenile jail for at least 7 \nconsecutive days after a court order for their release upon request, whose claims are not barred \nby the applicable statute of limitations as of the date of filing of Plaintiffs’ original complaint, \nand who had a disability within the meaning of the Americans with Disabilities Act at the time \nthey were held RUR. \n108.  As each Individual Defendant assumed or carried out their positions in DCFS, \nthey had an opportunity to end the practice of incarcerating children with RUR orders but did not \ndo so, as described in more detail elsewhere in this Complaint. Rather than end it, each \nIndividual Defendant knowingly perpetuated it, thereby cementing the practice of incarcerating \nchildren with RUR orders and making Defendants liable for the constitutional violations and \nviolations of state and federal law that befell Plaintiffs and the class members from the time they \nassumed the position referenced above to the present. \n109.  Based on publicly available data, Plaintiffs estimate that the class encompasses \nwell over 100 children.  \n27 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 28 of 32 PageID #:28\n110.  Common questions of law and fact exist to all class members. Among these \ncommon questions are: \na.  Whether any legitimate governmental purpose exists to incarcerate the class \nmembers in juvenile jail once they have been ordered released upon request \nb.  Whether the Individual Defendants maintained a practice of violating class \nmembers’ rights under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \nthrough this practice of incarcerating them despite RUR orders; and \nc.  Whether the Individual Defendants and Defendant DCFS deprived subclass \nmembers of less restrictive housing on the basis of their disabilities and thus \nviolated Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act. \n111.  The claims of the class representatives (both the named Plaintiffs and those whose \nclaims are brought by Plaintiff Golbert as their appointed attorney and guardian ad litem) are \ntypical of the claims of the class. Each of the class representatives was incarcerated despite an \nRUR order, in violation of the constitution, due to the same practices as the rest of the members \nof the class. Class representatives seek to prove that Defendants violated their rights and the \nrights of all class members due to Defendants’ liability for the practices described in this \nComplaint. \n112.  The Class representatives will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the \nclass. They have retained counsel experienced in class action, civil rights, and conditions of \nconfinement litigation. \n113.  The further requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) are met \nhere, in that questions of law and fact common to members of the class, which are described \n28 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 29 of 32 PageID #:29\nabove, predominate over any individual issues that may exist. In addition, a class action would \nbe the most efficient method of adjudicating the class members’ claims and is therefore the \nsuperior method of adjudication. \nCount I – Class Claims Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for Violations of the Fourteenth \nAmendment (against the Individual Defendants only) \n114. Each paragraph of this Complaint is incorporated herein.\n115. There is no legitimate governmental purpose for incarcerating a child in juvenile\njail who has an RUR order. \n116.  The Individual Defendants, cloaked under color of law, had a duty to protect \nPlaintiffs and the class members from physical and emotional harm. \n117.  The Individual Defendants knew or should have known that subjecting Plaintiff \nand the class members to the practice of incarcerating them despite RUR orders created a risk \nthat Plaintiffs and the class members would suffer physical and/or severe emotional harm. \n118.  In failing to address the known risk posed to Plaintiffs and the class members, the \nIndividual Defendants acted unreasonably and allowed Plaintiffs and the class members to suffer \nthe consequences of being wrongfully incarcerated children. \n119.  As a consequence of the Individual Defendants’ failure to keep Plaintiffs and the \nclass members from being wrongfully incarcerated, Plaintiffs and the class members suffered \nharm, including but not limited to, severe emotional distress.  \nCount II – Class Claims Pursuant to Rehabilitation Act \n29 U.S.C. § 794(a) \n(against all Defendants) \n120. Each paragraph of this Complaint is incorporate herein.\n121. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act states that no otherwise qualified individual\nwith a disability shall be “excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \n29 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 30 of 32 PageID #:30\nsubjected to discrimination in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” \n29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n122.  Disabled Plaintiffs and the subclass members are qualified “individuals with a \ndisability” within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) because they have a \nmental health, intellectual, or developmental disability. \n123.  DCFS, as a department of the State of Illinois, received “federal financial \nassistance” within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n124.  The operations of DCFS are a “program or activity” that falls within the meaning \nof 29 U.S.C. §§ 794(b)(1)(A)-(B) and/or (b)(2)(B). \n125.  Disabled Plaintiffs and subclass members were excluded from and were denied \nthe benefits of placement in less restrictive housing due to their disability. \n126.  Disabled Plaintiffs and subclass members were discriminated against by \nDefendant DCFS and the Individual Defendants based on their mental health, intellectual, or \ndevelopmental disabilities and were denied less restrictive housing as a direct and proximate \nresult. \n127.  As a direct and proximate result, disabled Plaintiffs and class members suffered \nharm. \nCount III – Class Claims Pursuant to Americans with Disabilities Act  \n42 U.S.C. § 12132 \n(against all Defendants) \n128.  Each paragraph of this Complaint is incorporate herein. \n129.  Disabled Plaintiffs and the subclass members are qualified “individuals with a \ndisability” within the meaning of Title II of the ADA because they have a mental health, \nintellectual, or developmental disability. \n30 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 31 of 32 PageID #:31\n130.  Title II of the ADA prohibits public entities from excluding qualified individuals \nfrom participation in services, programs, or activities. \n131.  The claims under the ADA are brought against Defendant DCFS as a department \nof the State of Illinois and against the Individual Defendants. \n132.  Defendant “DCFS” is a public entity within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1). \n133.  In violation of Title II of the ADA, disabled Plaintiffs and subclass members have \nbeen discriminated against on the basis of their disabilities, and were thus excluded from \nparticipating in, and were denied the benefits of, placement in less restrictive housing due to their \ndisabilities.  \nRequests for Relief \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully requests that this Court: \na.  Certify this case as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure and appoint the undersigned as class counsel pursuant to Rule 23(g); and \nb.  Enter judgment in Plaintiffs’ favor and against Defendants, awarding compensatory \ndamages, costs, and attorneys’ fees against all Defendants, and awarding punitive \ndamages against all Individual Defendants; and \nc.  Grant any other relief this Court considers just and proper. \nJury Demand \n  Plaintiffs respectfully demand trial by jury, on behalf of themselves and the class \nmembers, on all issues so triable. \n \n            RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, \n \n          /s/ Megan Pierce  \n31 \n \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/19/23 Page 32 of 32 PageID #:32\nAttorneys for Plaintiff \n \nJon Loevy \nRussell Ainsworth \nMegan Pierce \nLOEVY & LOEVY \n311 North Aberdeen, 3rd Floor \nChicago, IL 60607 \n(312) 243-5900 \n32 \n ",

SMITH, ET AL.,  )  Judge Martha M. Pacold \n  ) \nDefendants.  ) \n    \nDEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTION TO DISMISS \nAND MOTION TO STRIKE CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Eleventh Amendment bars damages suits premised on allegations that a State or its \nagency’s policies, practices, or customs are unconstitutional.  Yet Plaintiffs seek money damages \nagainst the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (“DCFS”), and its current and \nrecent Directors and other senior agency leadership, for “policies and practices” that Plaintiffs \ndescribe as “widespread,” Cmplt. ¶ 25, and “pervasive,” id. ¶ 76.  Plaintiffs allege that DCFS \ndoes not have and for at least 35 years has not had enough placements for children who are \nwards of DCFS, including but not limited to those who are awaiting adjudication for juvenile \ndelinquency at the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (“Cook County JTDC”).  \nSee, e.g., id. ¶¶ 29, 30, 60, 66, 67, 81.  By Plaintiffs’ acknowledgement, this problem has existed \n“for decades,” id. ¶ 5; it is not one that any Defendant created.   \n  The substance of Plaintiffs’ section 1983 claim is a Monell claim challenging the policies \nand practices of a State agency, but the Eleventh Amendment precludes Monell claims against \nstate agencies.  So, as they must, Plaintiffs attempt to dress the claim as something else: an \nindividual capacity lawsuit under section 1983 premised on a specific defendant’s personal \ninvolvement in the deprivation of a specific plaintiff’s constitutional rights.  This pleading \n1 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 16 Filed: 06/08/23 Page 7 of 26 PageID #:101\nartifice cannot abrogate the Eleventh Amendment and the immunity from damages suits that it \nprovides.   \nAnd because Plaintiffs’ actual complaint lies with DCFS and its policies, rather than \nsome wrongful action taken by the individual defendants, Plaintiffs do not link any defendant’s \nconduct to any plaintiff’s circumstances.  Plaintiffs abandon any guise of attempting to meet that \nburden by purporting to sue on behalf of putative classes, and in so doing underscore that their \nComplaint challenges DCFS’s policies and practices on a systemic level.  To allow the \nconstitutional claim in this case to proceed would eviscerate the Eleventh Amendment, allowing \nany plaintiff thereby barred from bringing suit to do so simply by alleging that government \npolicymakers had “personal involvement” in setting policies or failing to solve longstanding \nresource shortages or fix systemic problems.  Not surprisingly, the notion that Plaintiffs easily \ncan sidestep the Eleventh Amendment finds no support in the law.   \n  Plaintiffs’ Rehabilitation Act and Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) claims also \nare deficient.  Plaintiffs plead themselves out of court by alleging that people with disabilities \nand people without disabilities are subjected to the same policy and practice.  Plaintiffs do not \nand cannot plead the basic elements of a disability discrimination claim, such as offering any \nfactual allegation that DCFS even was aware of any Plaintiff’s alleged disability, let alone any \nfacts to support that DCFS discriminated against any Plaintiff on that or any other basis.  \n  These and the other fatal deficiencies described in this memorandum compel the \nconclusion that Plaintiffs do not and cannot state a cognizable claim.  Their Complaint must be \ndismissed, and because the defects cannot be cured, dismissal should be with prejudice. \nI.  Factual Background.   \n  Plaintiffs plead, but minimize, important factual background and omit other context that \nis subject to judicial notice.  Plaintiffs repeatedly allege that DCFS is responsible for “wrongfully \n2 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 16 Filed: 06/08/23 Page 8 of 26 PageID #:102\nincarcerating” children.  Id. ¶ 1-7.  To be clear, the Circuit Court of Cook County (through its \nsubdivision, the Cook County JTDC) at all relevant times “incarcerated” plaintiffs, who were \nawaiting adjudication for delinquency charges and were lawfully detained as a result.  The Cook \nCounty JTDC houses juveniles charged with murder, sexual assault, carjacking, unlawful use of \na weapon, aggravated assault, and other serious offenses.  The Circuit Court of Cook County is \nresponsible for the conditions plaintiffs describe at Cook County JTDC.  Id. ¶¶ 97-104.  Plaintiff \nGolbert works for the Circuit Court of Cook County.1  Id. ¶ 10.   \nJudges within the Circuit Court of Cook County determine whether children who are \nhoused at Cook County JTDC awaiting adjudication are released and subject to what conditions.  \n705 ILCS 405/5-501.  Judges in the Circuit Court of Cook County use what are called “release \nupon request” or “RUR” orders.  Cmplt. ¶ 2.  Plaintiffs acknowledge this nomenclature, but act \nas if the “upon request” language does not exist.  True to their name and plain language, these \ncourt orders are conditional, and depend (whether the child is in the custody of a parent, \nguardian, or DCFS) upon a request for release.  See id. ¶ 67(i).  If DCFS is the guardian or \nbecomes the guardian during delinquency proceedings, and is unable to make that request \nimmediately, then the court conducts regular hearings to determine the appropriate course.  See \nid. ¶ 72 (“DCFS … provides weekly updates to the Juvenile Court regarding these children and \nany efforts being undertaken to find an appropriate placement for them.”).    \nII.  Plaintiffs’ Constitutional Claim Must Be Dismissed. \nAs a “prerequisite” of a section 1983 suit, a plaintiff “must specify whether suit is \nbrought against the defendant in his official capacity or in his individual capacity.”  Hill v. \nShelander, 924 F.2d 1370, 1372 (7th Cir. 1991).  In “an official capacity suit the plaintiff alleges \nthat the defendant was party to the execution or implementation of official policy or conduct by a \n \n1 See https://www.cookcountycourt.org/ABOUT-THE-COURT/Organization-of-the-Circuit-Court.   \n3 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 16 Filed: 06/08/23 Page 9 of 26 PageID #:103\ngovernment.”  Id.  In contrast, a personal- or individual-capacity suit focuses on “the \nconstitutional torts of an individual official,” and a plaintiff must “show that the official, acting \nunder color of state law, caused the deprivation of a federal right.”  Id.  In this type of suit, \n“[l]iability depends on each defendant’s knowledge and actions,” Burks v. Raemisch, 555 F.3d \n592, 594 (7th Cir. 2009), and defendants must be “personally responsible for the constitutional \ndeprivation” for liability to attach.  J.H. v. Johnson, 346 F.3d 788, 793 (7th Cir. 2003).     \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional claim must be dismissed for four independent but related \nreasons.  First, Plaintiffs plead themselves out of court by attempting to bring a Monell claim (an \nofficial capacity claim) for damages relating to a state agency’s policies and practices.  While \nMonell claims about policies and practices are appropriate when filed against local governments, \nthey are barred by the Eleventh Amendment when filed against the State.  Second, because the \ngravamen of Plaintiffs’ complaint is about institutional deficiencies, they cannot plead the \nelements of an individual capacity claim premised on personal involvement in a constitutional \ntort.  Third, Plaintiffs do not identify the constitutional right that they claim Defendants violated.  \nAnd fourth, Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. \na.  Plaintiffs’ claim is a Monell claim that cannot be brought against the State. \n \nPlaintiffs announce that they are bringing a Monell claim in the first substantive \nparagraph of their Complaint: “This action challenges the policies and practices promulgated by \nDefendants, acting within [DCFS].” 2  Cmplt. ¶ 1 (emphasis added).  They leave no doubt by \ndescribing the “policies and practices” they challenge as “widespread,” id. ¶ 25, “pervasive,” ¶ \n76, and in place since “at least 1988,” ¶ 60.3  As with a Monell claim, Plaintiffs do not sue the \n \n2 The ordinary meaning of the word “promulgate” is “to publish” or “to announce officially.”  See N.W. \nEnvtl. Def. Ctr. v. Brennen, 958 F.2d 930, 934 (9th Cir. 1992).   \n \n3 These are the precise terms used to characterize a Monell claim.  See Rossi v. City of Chicago, 790 F.3d \n729, 737 (7th Cir. 2015) (“[A] Monell claim requires more than this; the gravamen is not individual \n \n4 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 16 Filed: 06/08/23 Page 10 of 26 PageID #:104\npublic employees who actually interact with the Plaintiffs (for instance, the caseworkers who \nhave responsibility for identifying placements for specific children who are wards of DCFS), but \ninstead the Directors and other high-level policymakers in the agency.  To distinguish a Monell \nclaim from a personal involvement claim, courts ask: “is the action about which the plaintiff is \ncomplaining one of the institution itself, or is it merely one undertaken by a subordinate actor.”  \nGlisson v. Ind. Dep’t of Corr., 849 F.3d 372, 381 (7th Cir. 2017).  Here, Plaintiffs plainly \nchallenge DCFS’s policies and practices, not the actions of subordinate actors disobeying those \npolicies and practices.  See, e.g., Cmplt. ¶ 11 (“DCFS failed”); ¶ 12 (“DCFS left her”); ¶ 13 \n(“DCFS flouted”); ¶ 25 (“countless children in DCFS care who are ordered RUR are left \nlanguishing in juvenile jail for weeks or even months by DCFS”) (emphasis added).   \nSuch a suit is barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  See Joseph v. Bd. of Regents of the \nUniv. of Wis. Sys., 432 F.3d 746, 748 (7th Cir. 2005) (“The Supreme Court has expressly held \nthat Congress has not abrogated the states’ immunity in § 1983 suits.” … “The Court has been \nclear … that Monell’s holding applies only to municipalities and not to states or states’ \ndepartments.”) (citation omitted); see also Peralta v. Dillard, 744 F.3d 1076, 1084 (9th Cir. \n2014) (“A chronic shortage of resources may well amount to a policy or practice for which \nmonetary relief may be available under Monell, but Monell claims can’t be brought against \nstates, which are protected by the Eleventh Amendment.”).   \nDCFS’s policies and practices may be challenged as unconstitutional under Ex parte \nYoung, seeking injunctive relief, see McDonough Assocs., Inc. v. Grunloh, 722 F.3d 1043, 1049-\n \nmisconduct by police officers (that is covered elsewhere under § 1983), but a widespread practice that \npermeates a critical mass of an institutional body. In other words, Monell claims focus on institutional \nbehavior; for this reason, misbehavior by one or a group of officials is only relevant where it can be tied \nto the policy, customs, or practices of the institution as a whole.”); Bernard v. Scott, 501 F. Supp. 3d 611, \n628-29 (N.D. Ill. 2020) (“For this type of Monell claim to exist, [plaintiff] must show that ‘an unlawful \npractice was so pervasive or systematic that policy-making officials knew of its existence and that their \nacquiescence to the ongoing practice amounted to a policy decision.’”) (citation omitted). \n5 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 16 Filed: 06/08/23 Page 11 of 26 PageID #:105\n50 (7th Cir. 2013), but such suits may not seek damages for past conduct.4  See Peralta, 744 F.3d \nat 1084 (“If the state provided insufficient resources to accord inmates adequate medical care, it \ncould be compelled to correct those conditions.  But such a lawsuit could provide no redress for \npast constitutional violations because the state is protected by sovereign immunity.”) (cleaned \nup).  And courts do not elevate labels over substance: they readily dismiss on Eleventh \nAmendment grounds Monell claims packaged as something else.  See Wright-Gray v. Ill. Dep’t \nof Healthcare & Family Servs., No. 09-4414, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6740, *8 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 26, \n2010) (“When the action is in essence one for the recovery of money from the state, the state is \nthe real, substantial party in interest and the suit is barred by sovereign immunity.  That is \nobviously the case with Count I of the complaint, and naming [an individual defendant] in his \nindividual capacity will not license an end-run around the Eleventh Amendment in a suit for \nmonetary relief that would run against the state of Illinois.”) (cleaned up and citation omitted); \nSaleh v. Pfister, No. 18-1812, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15304, *7 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 27, 2021) (“From \nthese allegations, it appears that [plaintiff] is attempting to bring a Monell pattern and practice \nclaim … any such claim for money damages is prohibited under the Eleventh Amendment.”).    \nPlaintiffs proclaim that they seek damages, on a class wide basis, to “once and for all” \nchange DCFS’s policies and practices.  Cmplt. ¶ 7.  Plaintiffs thus once again underscore that \nthey seek an “end run around the Eleventh Amendment by subjecting the state to precisely the \nkind of economic pressure against which the amendment protects it.”  Peralta, 744 F.3d at 1084.  \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional claim – however labeled or packaged – is barred by the State’s Eleventh \nAmendment immunity, and must be dismissed accordingly. \n \n4 Plaintiffs allege that the progress of implementing the Consent Decree in B.H. v. Smith, 88 C 5599 (N.D. \nIll., Alonso, J.), is too slow. Cmplt. ¶¶ 60-66.  Specifically, Plaintiffs note a motion filed in B.H. in 2015.  \nPlaintiffs describe correspondence they sent to the judge in B.H.  raising the same complaints raised in \nthis case.  See id. ¶67.  B.H. is an ongoing class action case for injunctive relief pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(b)(2).  Plaintiffs in this case do not and may not pursue a claim for injunctive relief: that is precluded \nby B.H.    \n6 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 16 Filed: 06/08/23 Page 12 of 26 PageID #:106\nb.  Plaintiffs do not and cannot plead what is necessary to state an individual \ncapacity claim. \n \nPlaintiff Golbert and his counsel no doubt understand that they cannot bring a Monell \nclaim against DCFS.  So, they attempt to state a different type of claim: an “individual capacity” \nclaim against current and recent Directors and senior leadership in DCFS premised on their \n“personal involvement” in “promulgating” what Plaintiffs say are longstanding and engrained \nDCFS policies and practices.  See Cmplt. ¶¶ 1, 114-19.  As described above, the substance of this \nclaim is a Monell claim against DCFS itself, which must be dismissed accordingly.  See Burks, \n555 F.3d at 596 (Plaintiffs’ “contention that any public employee who knows (or should know) \nabout a wrong must do something to fix it is just an effort to evade, by indirection, Monell’s rule \nthat public employees are responsible for their own misdeeds but not for anyone else’s.”).  But in \naddition, and as a result, Plaintiffs do not and cannot plead the facts they would need to state an \nindividual capacity claim against the individual Defendants.  Because their real dispute is with \nDCFS’s policies and practices, Plaintiffs come nowhere near alleging that any specific \nDefendant participated in any placement efforts for any specific Plaintiff, let alone committed \nany wrongdoing in the process. \nAs a threshold matter, Plaintiffs do not name any caseworkers – the front-line staff who \nas part of their duties work directly on placing youth – as Defendants in this case, or allege that \nthose caseworkers engaged in unconstitutional conduct (again, because their dispute concerns \nhow DCFS operates, not the wrongful actions of anyone in particular).  This forecloses a claim \nagainst the supervisors, senior leadership, and Directors who Plaintiffs did name.  See Whitlock \nv. Brueggemann, 682 F.3d 567, 581 (7th Cir. 2012) (for section 1983 liability, the defendant’s \nact must be the “cause-in-fact” of the injury and its “proximate cause”); McQueen v. Beecher \nCmty. Sch., 433 F.3d 460, 470 (6th Cir. 2006) (“[A] prerequisite of supervisory liability under § \n1983 is unconstitutional conduct by a subordinate of the supervisor”).   \n7 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 16 Filed: 06/08/23 Page 13 of 26 PageID #:107\nEven if Plaintiffs had named caseworkers, they still do not and cannot plead facts that \nestablish supervisor liability for Directors and senior DCFS staff.  “The assumption underlying \nthis choice of defendants – that anyone who knew or should have known of [a specific problem], \nand everyone higher up the bureaucratic chain, must be liable – is a bad one.”  Burks, 555 F.3d at \n593.  Section 1983 “does not establish a system of vicarious responsibility.”  Id.  Rather, \n“liability depends on each defendant’s knowledge and actions, not on the knowledge or actions \nof persons they supervise.”  Id. at 594; see also Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 676 (2009).   \n“[P]ersonal involvement in the constitutional deprivation” is required for liability to \nattach, J.H., 346 F.3d at 793, and Plaintiffs plead no facts indicating that the Directors or senior \nlevel staff they sue had any personal involvement in any Plaintiff’s placement process.  In fact, \nthey do not even identify which Defendant or set of Defendants worked at DCFS during any \npurported constitutional violation.  Plaintiffs sue every person who has held the Director role and \nother senior staff roles without regard to their individual actions in those roles – even an interim \ndirector who held the position for two months.  This list of defendants reinforces that the suit is \nabout institutional policies rather than individual conduct.  Plaintiffs do not identify which \nactions defendants took or did not take that were illegal; in fact, the most specific factual \nallegations (as opposed to conclusory allegations) Plaintiffs include about defendants’ conduct – \nsuch as that defendants generally did not “enter[] into contracts to develop new placements,” \nCmplt. ¶¶ 29-30, and did not “add[] additional supports to a placement such as one-on-one aides \nor additional funding for other programming or services,” id. ¶ 84 – simply are not illegal acts, \nlet alone acts that demonstrate personal involvement in any particular plaintiff’s placement \nprocess.  And Plaintiffs’ vague and conclusory allegations that Defendants had a ready panacea \nto create more placements but decided not to use it, id. ¶¶ 29, 43, 45, 48, 90, are not plausible \n8 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 16 Filed: 06/08/23 Page 14 of 26 PageID #:108\nand are contradicted by Plaintiffs’ allegations that placement shortages have been a challenge for \n“decades” and “since as far back as at least 1988,” id. ¶¶ 5, 60.   \nLeft with no better option, Plaintiffs resort to vague conclusions rather than facts, relating \nto Defendants’ general responsibilities and constructive knowledge rather than their specific \nactions or actual awareness.  Conclusions such as that “Defendants have had direct knowledge of \neach and every class member who has been wrongfully incarcerated despite an order for their \nrelease,” id. ¶ 5, are empty and not creditable – not even supplying the basic fact of which \ndefendant(s) supposedly “knew” about which plaintiff’s placement status (allegations that are \nnecessary but not at all sufficient).  This sort of conclusory pleading is insufficient; it does not \nprovide “fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.” Bell Atlantic \nCorp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  The complaint must state a claim for relief that is \nplausible on its face, requiring a plaintiff to plead “factual content that allows the court to draw \nthe reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Sloan v. Am. \nBrain Tumor Ass’n., 901 F.3d 891, 894 (7th Cir. 2018).   \nDCFS provided services to between approximately 17,500 and 23,000 youth in each of \nthe past several years, and placement is one of many services the agency provides; it also \nperforms nearly 100,000 investigations per year, approves adoptions and guardianships, licenses \nday cares, and more.5  To be plausible, any allegations that DCFS’s Directors and senior \nleadership knew about and played a sufficient personal role in a particular plaintiff’s placement \nefforts to merit individual section 1983 liability requires far more in the way of facts.  Tamayo v. \nBlagojevich, 526 F.3d 1074, 1083 (7th Cir. 2008); Woods v. Maryville Academy, 2018 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 196599, at *11-12 (N.D. Ill. 2018) (Defendant’s “capacity as DCFS director by its nature \ndistanced him from the actions about which [plaintiff] complains….

See J.H. v. Johnson, 346 F.3d 788, 792-93 (7th Cir. \n2003).    (“The plaintiffs’ brief describes at length the statutory duties Illinois law imposes on \nvarious DCFS workers.  However, we find that the plaintiffs’ theory of statutorily-imposed \nknowledge falls short of satisfying their burden of proof. …  constructive or statutorily-implied \nknowledge cannot serve as a substitute for actual knowledge or suspicion.”); Almond v. Wexford \nHealth Source, Inc., No. 15-50291, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96540, *7-8 (N.D. Ill. June 22, 2017) \n(defendant’s “actual knowledge of a purported practice or policy of failing to provide adequate \nmedical care is distinct from claiming actual knowledge of [plaintiff’s] condition”).  And \nPlaintiffs cannot meet their burden by grouping Defendants and leveling vague and \nundifferentiated allegations against them. Engel v. Buchan, 710 F. 3d 698, 710 (7th Cir. 2013) \n(“Plaintiffs may not rely on vague references to a group of ‘defendants,’ without specific \nallegations tying the individual defendants to the alleged unconstitutional conduct.’”) (cleaned up \nand citation omitted); Safari Childcare, Inc. v. Penny, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147943, at *7 \n(N.D. Ill. 2018) (dismissing complaint which failed to “differentiate among the nearly two dozen \nDCFS employees named as defendants” and failed to specify which defendants took any \nparticular actions).   \nPlaintiffs’ real dispute, as they repeatedly allege, is with the “policies and practices” of \nDCFS.  Because of this, they cannot plead that any defendant had “personal responsibility” in \nany plaintiffs’ constitutional deprivation to hold them individually liable.   \n \n \n10 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 16 Filed: 06/08/23 Page 16 of 26 PageID #:110\nc.  Plaintiffs do not identify their constitutional claim. \n \nIt is not clear what constitutional right Plaintiffs are seeking to assert.  They characterize \ntheir claim as “wrongful incarceration,” but DCFS does not “incarcerate” anyone.  Plaintiffs \nmake no assertion that their pretrial detention at the Cook County JTDC did not comport with the \ndue process requirements for individuals awaiting adjudication on criminal or juvenile \ndelinquency charges.  When serving children who have been arrested and have entered the \ncustody of the Cook County JTDC, DCFS operates as directed by judges within the Circuit Court \nof Cook County, as Plaintiffs acknowledge.  Cmplt. ¶ 72.  Compliance with a State court process \nand order does not violate the Constitution, and Plaintiff Golbert’s appropriate recourse with \nrespect to how a County Court system interacts with a State agency does not lie in the federal \ncourts.6   \nWith respect to DCFS and its actions, Plaintiffs do not articulate what constitutional right \nDefendants are alleged to have violated.  A traditional section 1983 child welfare claim would \nfail for a number of foundational reasons: the plaintiffs cannot demonstrate defendants’ \n“personal involvement,” J.H., 346 F.3d at 793; a “dereliction of statutory duties” does not “form \nthe basis of a § 1983 claim,”7 id.; “knowledge or suspicion of abuse cannot merely be imputed \n \n6 Plaintiff Golbert and the Loevy & Loevy law firm have brought two other cases against DCFS, its \nDirectors, and senior staff, including a case similar to this one which seeks damages for a shortage of \noverall placement options.  See Golbert v. Walker, Case No. 18-8176 (N.D. Ill.) (seeking class \ncertification and damages under section 1983, the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADA for an insufficient \nnumber of available placements).  That case has been mired in discovery for years, and there, as here, \nplaintiffs are attempting to litigate a Monell claim challenging decades of DCFS policies in the guise of \nan individual-capacity claim against Directors and other senior staff who worked in the agency over more \nthan a decade.  The magistrate judge in that case recently observed that plaintiffs “had not actually \nthought through their actual theory of liability.” Id., Dkt. No. 262 at 1. n.1.  \n \n7 Plaintiffs repeatedly allege that Defendants are not fulfilling their statutory duties as described in the \nIllinois Children and Family Services Act, 20 ILCS 505, and that Defendants did not exercise their “legal \nauthority” under the Act to increase the number of placements.  See Cmplt. ¶¶ 21, 26, 29, 30, 37, 38, 43, \n45, 48, 50, 53, 55, 58.  State law is clear that there is no “private right of action” or any “judicially \nenforceable claim” relating to whether there are “a sufficient number of placement” options.  20 ILCS \n505/2.1.  And alleging a violation of State law does not make out a section 1983 claim.  See, e.g., Windle \n \n11 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 16 Filed: 06/08/23 Page 17 of 26 PageID #:111\nfrom a statute,” id.; and “the plaintiffs must show a connection between any knowledge or \nsuspicion of risk that the defendants may have had and the injury that the children actually \nsuffered,” id.   \nDefendants agree that children in juvenile detention should be released as quickly as \npossible after an appropriate placement is identified, and DCFS takes steps to make this happen, \nid. ¶¶ 72-73.  But there can be significant challenges with placement, especially for youth \naccused of serious crimes: the process of matching a youth to a facility (which may include \nscheduling and attending interviews and waiting to learn of acceptance) can take time; even after \nacceptance, some facilities have wait lists that preclude immediate placement; and youth \nsometimes refuse to attend interviews or otherwise cooperate in their placement.  See id. ¶ 68 \n(barriers identified in the 2016 Auditor General report).  Youth with criminal histories or who are \ncharged with serious offenses are often more difficult to place because they pose a real or \nperceived danger to their caregivers, or to other children at facilities that may otherwise be \nappropriate placements.  While DCFS takes this set of challenges seriously and has worked and \ncontinues to work to address them, difficulty or delay in identifying placements for hard-to-place \nyouth does not violate any recognized constitutional right that can serve as the basis of a section \n1983 claim.   \nd.  Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. \n \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional claim fails for the additional reason that Defendants are entitled \nto qualified immunity.  Because of the novelty of Plaintiffs’ damages suit, this is a case in which \nqualified immunity should be examined and resolved at the pleading stage.   \n \nv. City of Marion, Ind., 321 F.3d 658, 662-63 (7th Cir. 2003); White v. Olig, 56 F.3d 817, 820 (7th Cir. \n1995) (“It is therefore a truism, reiterated many times by this court, that mere allegations of state law \ninfraction are insufficient to support a Section 1983 claim.”). \n12 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 16 Filed: 06/08/23 Page 18 of 26 PageID #:112\nCourts are to resolve qualified immunity issues “at the earliest possible stage of \nlitigation.”  Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227 (1991); see also Jacobs v. City of Chi., 215 F.3d \n758, 765 n.3 (7th Cir. 2000)) (“[C]ourts have been admonished that qualified immunity is the \nability to be free from suit, not merely a defense from liability, and that, therefore, the question \nof immunity should be decided at the earliest possible stage. [The Seventh Circuit] has held that \nresolution of this issue may be appropriate as early as dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).”) (cleaned \nup).  “[A] complaint may be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) on qualified immunity grounds \nwhere the plaintiff asserts the violation of a broad constitutional right that had not been \narticulated at the time the violation is alleged to have occurred. … [A] court may properly \naddress this purely legal question under Rule 12(b)(6).”   Jacobs, 215 F.3d at 765.   \nHere, as noted above, it is not at all clear what constitutional right Plaintiffs are alleging \nthat Defendants violated.  Plaintiffs at times seem to be claiming a constitutional right to have \nDCFS “request” their release within seven days of an RUR order being issued, see Cmplt. ¶¶ \n106, 107; but that right never has been articulated by any court.  At other times, Plaintiffs seem \nto be claiming a sweeping constitutional right to have DCFS eliminate resource shortages and \nplacement challenges altogether.  Cmplt. ¶¶ 29, 30, 81.  That right also never has been \narticulated; to the contrary, Seventh Circuit precedent holds that resource constraints must \ninform when liability may arise from a child welfare placement.8  K.H. v. Morgan, 914 F.2d 846, \n853-54 (7th Cir. 1990).    \n \n8 Plaintiffs’ allegations that DCFS can spend without limitation to “create” more placements irrespective \nof its budget set by the State’s legislative process is fanciful, and cannot be credited as a plausible factual \nallegation.   Cmplt. ¶ 88, 90.  In the similar Golbert case against DCFS, this same theory of liability was \nadvanced and then abandoned.  Case No. 18-8176, Dkt. 262 at 1 n.1.  Here, Plaintiffs do not even cite the \nportion of State statute that they believe exempts DCFS from the State budget and from the universal \nreality that governmental resources always are limited.  See, e.g., K.H., 914 F.2d at 853 (“The needs of \nneglected, abused, and abandoned children compete with other demands, both public and private, for \nscarce resources.”); Rockford League of Women Voters v. United States Nuclear Regulatory Com., 679 \nF.2d 1218, 1222 (7th Cir. 1982) (“Government agencies have limited resources to perform their appointed \n \n13 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 16 Filed: 06/08/23 Page 19 of 26 PageID #:113\nAgainst this backdrop, dismissal on qualified immunity grounds is required because its \npurpose is to protect “all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law,” \nHumphrey v. Staszak, 148 F.3d 719, 727 (7th Cir. 1998) (citation omitted).  Defendants are \nprotected unless they can “fairly be said to ‘know’ that the law forbade” their “conduct.”  \nHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).  Plaintiffs do not complain of “conduct” by the \nDefendants; they complain instead about the existence of longstanding resource shortages.  At \nthe Complaint’s most specific, Defendants are charged with not “entering into contracts to \ndevelop new placements,” Cmplt. ¶¶ 29-30, and not “adding additional supports to a placement \nsuch as one-on-one aides or additional funding for other programming or services,” id. ¶ 84.  \nThat is simply not forbidden or illegal conduct, let alone conduct that is so obviously illegal that \nDefendants would have “known” it to be forbidden.  The question to be answered in analyzing \nqualified immunity is whether a reasonable official in Defendant’s position would have known \nthat her conduct was unlawful.  While a case directly on point is not required, “‘precedent must \nhave placed the ... constitutional question beyond debate’[.]” Campbell v. Kallas, 936 F.3d 536, \n545 (7th Cir. 2019) (quoting White v. Pauly, 137 S. Ct. 548, 551 (2017)).  “[T]he Supreme Court \nhas repeatedly emphasized that the clearly established law must share specific details with the \nfacts of the case at hand.”  Doxtator v. O'Brien, 39 F.4th 852, 863 (7th Cir. 2022). \nAt its core, the only “wrongdoing” that the Defendants are accused of (as evidenced inter \nalia by suing an unbroken chain of Directors and other senior staff, including an interim Director \nwho held that role for approximately two months, id. ¶ 27) is serving in the capacity of DCFS \n \ntasks. The courts cannot tell them how to allocate those resources so as to get the most value out of \nthem.”).  As with every other agency in State government, DCFS is constrained by its appropriated \nbudget.  See Illinois State Budget FY 2024 at 266-71, available at https://budget.illinois.gov/fy2024-\nbudget-book/Fiscal-Year-2024-Operating-Budget.pdf.   \n \n14 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 16 Filed: 06/08/23 Page 20 of 26 PageID #:114\nDirector or in other senior leadership roles.  Qualified immunity shields Defendants from \nsweeping liability predicated not on their conduct but on their position. \nIII.  Plaintiffs’ Rehabilitation Act and ADA Claims Must Be Dismissed. \n \nPlaintiffs’ Rehabilitation Act and ADA claims fail for similar reasons. 9  To prevail on \nthese claims (courts treat them as “functionally identical”), plaintiffs must prove that they (1) are \na qualified individual with a disability and (2) that they were denied access to a program or \nactivity “because of” their disability.  Wagoner v. Lemman, 778 F.3d 586, 592 (7th Cir. 2015).  \nTo obtain damages, as Plaintiffs seek here, Plaintiffs must demonstrate “intentional \ndiscrimination.”  CTL v. Ashland Sch. Dist., 743 F.3d 524, 528 n.4 (7th Cir. 2014).  \nPlaintiffs plead themselves out of court by alleging that disabled and non-disabled \nchildren were treated alike under DCFS’s “widespread,” Cmplt. ¶ 25, and “pervasive,” id. ¶ 76, \npolicy and practice, compare ¶ 106 with ¶ 107; see also id. ¶ 81 (alleging that the lack of \n“sufficient placement capacity affected many children in DCFS care”).  This is fatal to their \nclaim.  See Murdock v. Washington, 193 F.3d 510, 513 (7th Cir. 1999) (affirming dismissal \nwhere plaintiff alleged that the purported “discriminatory” policy applied across the institution, \nnot just those with a disability); Glick v. Walker, 272 Fed. Appx. 514, 521 (7th Cir. 2008) \n(“[Plaintiff] has pleaded himself out of court because he alleges that he was denied access to \ngroup therapy because of his security status, not because of any disability.”). \nPlaintiffs nowhere allege even in conclusory fashion (let alone make the required factual \nallegations) that DCFS had any knowledge of Plaintiffs’ disabilities.  See Long v. Bd. of Educ., \n167 F. Supp. 2d 988, 991 (N.D. Ill. 2001) (“[P]laintiff cannot prove that the decision to suspend \nhim was discriminatory unless the decisionmakers had knowledge of the disability prior to the \n \n9 All Defendants other than DCFS should be dismissed from the Rehabilitation Act and ADA claims.  See \nStanek v. St. Charles Community Unit School District No. 303, 783 F.3d 634 (7th Cir. 2015) (affirming \ndismissal of official capacity defendants where plaintiff also sued the public entity); Reed v. Illinois, 119 \nF. Supp. 3d 879, 883 (N.D. Ill. 2015); Reed v. Illinois, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60875 (N.D. Ill. 2016).  \n15 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 16 Filed: 06/08/23 Page 21 of 26 PageID #:115\ndecision.”); cf. Hedberg v. Indiana Bell Tel. Co., 47 F.3d 928, 932 (7th Cir. 1995) (“[A]n \nemployer cannot fire an employee ‘because of’ a disability unless it knows of the disability.  If it \ndoes not know of the disability, the employer is firing the employee ‘because of’ some other \nreason.”).  Nor do they provide anything other than rank speculation and vague conclusions to \nconnect any plaintiff’s disability with any placement delay.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (“A pleading \nthat offers labels and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action \nwill not do.  Nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders naked assertions devoid of further factual \nenhancement.”).  Plaintiffs allege no facts that could lead to a plausible inference of “intentional \ndiscrimination.”  Id. at 683 (Rule 8 is not satisfied if the “complaint does not contain any factual \nallegation sufficient to plausibly suggest [a] discriminatory state of mind.”).10  The Rehabilitation \nAct and ADA claims must be dismissed. \nIV.  Dismissal Should Be With Prejudice. \n \n“[C]ourts have broad discretion to deny leave to amend where . . . the amendment would \nbe futile.”  Hukic v. Aurora Loan Servs., 588 F.3d 420, 432 (7th Cir. 2009).  And Seventh Circuit \n“case law recognizes that a party may plead itself out of court by pleading facts that establish an \nimpenetrable defense to its claims;” or when “it would be necessary to contradict the complaint \nin order to prevail on the merits.” Tamayo, 526 F.3d at 1086 (citation omitted).  “If the plaintiff \nvoluntarily provides unnecessary facts in her complaint, the defendant may use those facts to \ndemonstrate that she is not entitled to relief.” Id. (citation omitted).   \nHere, Plaintiffs have foreclosed all avenues to obtaining damages by the allegations they \nincluded in their Complaint.  Any constitutional claims against the State are barred by the \n \n10 Only compensatory damages are available under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA.  Plaintiffs do not \nplead or identify any cognizable “compensatory” damages.  The “emotional damages” that they focus \ntheir Complaint on, see Cmplt. ¶¶ 97-104, 116-119, are not recoverable.  Cummings v. Premier Rehab \nKeller, P.L.L.C., 142 S. Ct. 1562, 1576 (2022).  Nor are punitive damages.  CTL ex rel. Trebatoski v. \nAshland Sch. Dist., 743 F.3d 524, 528 (7th Cir. 2014). \n16 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 16 Filed: 06/08/23 Page 22 of 26 PageID #:116\nEleventh Amendment.  Plaintiffs’ allegations have laid bare that “the gravamen” of their \ncomplaint “is not individual misconduct …, but a widespread practice that permeates a critical \nmass of an institutional body.”  Rossi, 790 F.3d at 737.  Plaintiffs would need to contradict the \nfacts already pled (attributing plaintiffs’ injuries to “policies and practices” DCFS \n“promulgated,” Cmplt. ¶ 1, that have been in place since “for decades,” id. ¶ 5, and are \n“widespread,” id. ¶ 25, and “pervasive,” id. ¶ 76) in order to state a claim predicated instead on \nindividual wrongdoing – violating rather than promulgating DCFS policies.  Likewise, with \nrespect to their Rehabilitation Act and ADA claims, Plaintiffs would need to contradict the facts \nalready pled (that the lack of “sufficient placement capacity affected many children in DCFS \ncase,” id. ¶ 81; and that disabled and non-disabled Plaintiffs were treated alike, compare ¶ 106 \nwith ¶ 107) in order to allege the intentional discrimination required to seek damages.  Because \namendment would be futile, the claims should be dismissed with prejudice. \nV.  The Putative Class Allegations Should Be Stricken. \n \nAlthough Plaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed altogether, Plaintiffs’ class claims \nadditionally cannot withstand scrutiny and should be stricken.  “If the plaintiff’s class allegations \nare facially and inherently deficient \"a motion to strike class allegations … can be an appropriate \ndevice to determine whether [the] case will proceed as a class action.”  Brunner v. Liautaud, No. \n14-5509, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46018, *18-19 (N.D. Ill. April 8, 2015) (citing cases).  \nPlaintiffs’ defective class allegations fail even at the pleading stage. \nAs described above, Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims may proceed only if they are \npredicated on the “personal liability” of each of the Defendants.  “Liability depends on each \ndefendant’s knowledge and actions.”  Burks, 555 F.3d at 593-94 (citation omitted).  The focus on \npersonal involvement and each of the twelve individual defendants’ unique knowledge and \nactions with respect to each of nine plaintiffs’ unique placement processes cannot be reconciled \n17 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 16 Filed: 06/08/23 Page 23 of 26 PageID #:117\nwith the typicality, commonality, and predominance requirements of Rule 23(b)(3).  As a result, \nwhile section 1983 cases pursuing injunctive relief on a class wide basis are relatively common \n(since personal involvement is irrelevant), Defendants are not aware of any section 1983 \ndamages suits (which hinge on personal involvement) certified under Rule 23(b)(3) – and \ncertainly none involving the myriad fact-bound and individualized determinations at issue here: \nthe reasons for a particular plaintiff’s pretrial detention; the specific placement needs of a \nparticular plaintiff (whether they have family or kin who may be appropriate placements; \nwhether they need complex medical or psychiatric care; whether they may pose a risk of \nviolence toward adult caregivers or other children); the details of a particular defendant’s \nknowledge of and conduct in relation to the particular plaintiff; whether that conduct was \nreasonable in light of available alternatives at the time and a particular plaintiff’s placement \nchallenges; whether plaintiff bears some responsibility for his own injury, including whether the \nreasons for the plaintiff’s pretrial detention (often involving allegations of committing serious or \nviolent crimes) limits the available placement options; whether plaintiff suffered injury as a \nresult of defendant’s conduct; and, if so, the extent of the injury and how to compensate for it.   \nTo the contrary, the Seventh Circuit has held specifically that class certification is not \nappropriate when questions like “whether the length of the delay before the detainee’s release \nwas reasonable in any given case” must be resolved.  See Harper v. Sheriff of Cook County, 581 \nF.3d 511, 515 (7th Cir. 2009) (noting various justifications for delay and determining that \n“[l]iability, to saying nothing of damages, would need to be determined on an individual basis. \nThus, common issues do not predominate over individual issues, making this case inappropriate \nfor class disposition.”); Portis v. City of Chi., 613 F.3d 702, 705 (7th Cir. 2010) (“The premise of \nthe class certification is that one rule applies to all members.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  Because \n18 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 16 Filed: 06/08/23 Page 24 of 26 PageID #:118\nreasonableness is a standard rather than a rule, and because one detainee’s circumstances differ \nfrom another’s, common questions do not predominate and class certification is inappropriate.”).   \nCourts likewise deny class certification in the child welfare context – even in cases \nsimply seeking injunctive relief (i.e., those not predicated on personal responsibility) – due to the \nhighly fact-specific nature of the challenges in any given child’s placement.  See Elisa W. v. City \nof New York, No. 15-5273, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 167910, *36-37 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 3, 2021) \n(“[T]he named Plaintiffs’ claims cannot be said to arise from the same course of events as those \nof other children, because it is not possible to determine what caused a permanency delay, a \nspecific placement, an untimely or poorly-conceived case plan, or an instance of maltreatment, \nwithout evaluating all of the other contributing facts and influences. To give just one example, a \nkey purpose of foster care is to remedy the root cause of a child’s separation from family by \nproviding parents with services such as housing assistance, mental health treatment, and \nsubstance abuse counseling.  Many delays in returning a child to their parents, however, flow \nfrom delays in parents receiving those services—it can take months, or even years, to obtain \nhousing or to be admitted to mental health or drug treatment programs. These delays and \ncomplications are particular to each child and their respective family members.”).   \nIt is difficult to conjure a more individualized inquiry than the reasons for the duration of \npretrial detention, compounded by the reasons for delay in a child welfare placement, \ncompounded by a liability standard that hinges upon a defendant’s specific knowledge and \npersonal involvement with respect to a specific plaintiff’s placement process.  Because Plaintiffs’ \nclass allegations are “facially and inherently deficient,” they should be stricken.   \n \n \n19 \n\nCase: 1:23-cv-00300 Document #: 16 Filed: 06/08/23 Page 25 of 26 PageID #:119\nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ Complaint should be dismissed with prejudice, and \nPlaintiffs’ class allegations should be stricken. \n \nDated:  June 1, 2023          Respectfully submitted, \n \nBarbara L.
