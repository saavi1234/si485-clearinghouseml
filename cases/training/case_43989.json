    "summary": "<p>On December 18, 2015, almost three years after the former Rensselaer County Democratic Elections Commissioner was acquitted in state court of forging absentee ballots in a local primary election, he filed this suit against the County of Rensselaer and multiple individuals who he alleged were involved in his prosecution, including the Special District Attorney for the County. The plaintiff filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 for violations of the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged malicious prosecution without probable cause and argued that the Special District Attorney fabricated evidence to pursue criminal charges against him. The plaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages, medical expenses and costs, and attorneys&rsquo; fees. U.S. District Judge Mae A. D&rsquo;Agostino presided over this case.</p>\r\n<p>On September 30, 2016, the district court ruled on multiple motions to dismiss, dismissing five defendants from the action, and granting in part and denying in part another defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss. While the district court found that the plaintiff had adequately pleaded facts to support a malicious prosecution claim against one of the defendants, the court dismissed the plaintiff&rsquo;s fabrication of evidence claims against all the defendants on statute of limitations grounds. Three months later, the district court ruled on three more motions to dismiss. First, the court dismissed the County as a defendant, reasoning that a municipality cannot be held liable solely based on the actions of city employees. The court also dismissed the Special District Attorney as a defendant, finding that he was entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity. Lastly, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss by a defendant who was assigned to assist the Special District Attorney in the investigation of the plaintiff. The court found that the defendant was entitled to absolute immunity for his grand jury and trial testimony. However, it also found that plaintiff had sufficiently alleged that the defendant acted in conjunction with the Special District Attorney to maliciously prosecute the plaintiff by ignoring or failing to obtain evidence that would have incriminated other defendants in order to continue prosecuting the plaintiff. 2016 WL 7496128.</p>\r\n<p>On January 27, 2017, the plaintiff appealed both the district court&rsquo;s dismissal of his fabrication of evidence claim and the court&rsquo;s finding that the Special District Attorney was entitled to absolute immunity for the malicious prosecution claim. On August 3, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the district court&rsquo;s holding that the Special District Attorney was entitled to absolute immunity for the malicious prosecution claim given that the malicious prosecution claim related to actions he took while acting in a prosecutorial capacity. The Second Circuit also held that the fabricated-evidence claim was properly dismissed as untimely given that the limitations period began to run when the plaintiff was arrested and stood trial, not when the plaintiff was acquitted. 898 F.3d 259.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff subsequently appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to resolve the question of when the statute of limitations for a fabricated-evidence claim begins to run. The district court stayed discovery and further proceedings pending the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision. On June 19, 2019, the Supreme Court held that the limitations period began to run when the criminal proceedings against the plaintiff terminated in his favor, and thus reversed and remanded the case. 588 U.S. 109.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff filed an amended complaint on June 8, 2020, against five defendants, alleging that they fabricated evidence against him and maliciously prosecuted him without probable cause, and that both of those actions violated the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. However, on October 30, 2020, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the amended complaint against four defendants, leaving the Special District Attorney as the only remaining defendant.</p>\r\n<p>The Special District Attorney subsequently moved to dismiss and, in the alternative, moved for summary judgment. On August 11, 2022, the district court granted the Special District Attorney&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment, dismissed the plaintiff&rsquo;s amended complaint with prejudice, and ordered judgment in favor of the defendant, finding that nothing in the record suggested that the defendant fabricated evidence or coerced individuals into perjuring themselves. 2022 WL 3279348.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is now closed.</p>",

MCDONOUGH,\nPlaintiff,\nvs. 1:15-CV-1505\n(MAD/DJS)\nYOUEL C.

O'CONNOR, ESQ.\nNAPIERSKI & O'CONNOR, LLP DIANE LUFKIN SCHILLING, ESQ.\n296 Washington Avenue Extension\nAlbany, New York 12203\nAttorneys for Defendant\nMae A. D'Agostino, U.S. District Judge:\nMEMORANDUM-DECISION AND ORDER\nI. INTRODUCTION\nPlaintiff Edward G. McDonough (\"Plaintiff\") commenced the instant action by filing a\n174 page, 1220 paragraph complaint on December 18, 2015, asserting three causes of action\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against eleven named Defendants.  See Dkt. No. 1.  As relevant\nhere, this Court dismissed Plaintiff's claim that he was denied due process based on fabricated\nevidence against Defendant Youel C. Smith, III (\"Defendant\"), finding that the claim was barred\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 2 of 60\nby the three-year statute of limitations.  See Dkt. No. 114.  Additionally, the Court dismissed the\nmalicious prosecution claim against Defendant, finding that he was entitled to absolute\nprosecutorial immunity.  See Dkt. No. 121.  \nAfter the Court's second Memorandum-Decision and Order, Plaintiff filed a notice of\nappeal to the Second Circuit, appealing only the dismissal of all claims against Defendant.  See\nDkt. No. 124. On May 8, 2017, the Court granted Plaintiff's motion for entry of final judgment\nwith respect to the dismissal of all claims against Defendant.  See Dkt. No. 142.  On August 3,\n2018, the Second Circuit affirmed this Court's dismissal of the claims against Defendant.  See\nMcDonough v. Smith, 898 F.3d 259 (2d Cir. 2018).  As to the fabrication of evidence claim, the\nSecond Circuit held that the Court properly determined that, under the circumstances of Plaintiff's\nclaim, it accrued when Plaintiff \"(1) learned of the fabrication of the evidence and its use against\nhim in criminal proceedings, and (2) was deprived of a liberty interest by his arrest and trial.\"  Id.\nat 267.  This determination was made, in part, based on the fact that, unlike a malicious\nprosecution claim, a fabricated evidence claim does not require the plaintiff to establish that the\ncriminal proceedings terminated in his favor.  See id. at 267-68.  Finally, the Second Circuit held\nthat the Court correctly determined that Defendant was entitled to absolute prosecutorial\nimmunity as to Plaintiff's malicious prosecution claim.  See id. at 269.  \nNoting the circuit split on the issue, the Supreme Court granted certiorari to decide when\n\"the statute of limitations for a Section 1983 claim based on fabrication of evidence in criminal\nproceedings begins to run.\"  McDonough v. Smith, ___ U.S.___, 139 S. Ct. 2149 (2019).  On June\n20, 2019, the Supreme Court found that this Court and the Second Circuit incorrectly determined\nthe date of accrual and held that the statute of limitations for Plaintiff's Section 1983 claim\n\"alleging that he was prosecuted using fabricated evidence began to run when the criminal\n2\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 3 of 60\nproceedings against him terminated in his favor โ that is, when he was acquitted at the end of his\nsecond trial.\"  Id. at 2161.  Accordingly, the matter was remanded for further proceedings.  \nUpon remand to this Court, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on June 8, 2020,\nasserting two causes of action against five Defendants.  See Dkt. No. 185.  In his first cause of\naction, Plaintiff claims that Defendants deprived him of his rights under the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth,\nand Fourteenth Amendments when they deprived him of his liberty \"as a result of fabrication of\nevidence.\"  Id. at ยถยถ 1019-22.  In his second cause of action, Plaintiff claims that he was\nmaliciously prosecuted without probable cause in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and\nFourteenth Amendments.1  See id. at ยถยถ 1023-26.  On October 30, 2020, Plaintiff voluntarily\ndismissed the amended complaint against Defendants Kevin B. McGrath, William A. McInerney,\nJohn J. Ogden, and Anthony J. Renna, leaving Defendant Smith the only remaining Defendant. \nSee Dkt. Nos. 199-201.  \nCurrently before the Court is Defendant's motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for\nsummary judgment.  See Dkt. No. 223.     \nII. BACKGROUND\nA. Lambertsen Petition\n1 It is not entirely clear why Plaintiff's amended complaint includes a malicious\nprosecution claim against Defendant.  On December 30, 2016, this Court dismissed that claim\nagainst Defendant based on absolute prosecutorial immunity and the Second Circuit affirmed that\ndecision.  While the Supreme Court subsequently determined that the Court erred in its analysis\nof the accrual date for Plaintiff's fabrication of evidence claim, that decision left this Court's and\nthe Second Circuit's decision regarding the malicious prosecution claim undisturbed.  In\nDefendant's motion for summary judgment and Plaintiff's response, however, both parties treat\nthese two causes of action as alleging denial of Plaintiff's right to a fair trial through the\nfabrication of evidence, with the first cause of action relating to the fabrication of evidence during\nthe criminal investigation and the second cause of action relating to its subsequent use during\njudicial proceedings.  In light of the parties' submissions, the Court will construe both causes of\naction as asserting denial of the right to a fair trial.    \n3\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 4 of 60\nOn September 15, 2009, a primary election for the Working Families Party (\"WFP\") was\nheld in the City of Troy, New York.  See Dkt. No. 223-1 at ยถ 1.  On September 23, 2009, a\nSpecial Proceeding pursuant to Article XVII of the New York Elections Law was commenced in\nNew York Supreme Court, Rensselaer County (the \"Lambertsen proceeding\").  See id. at ยถ 2.  The\nLambertsen petition and supporting affidavit alleged that numerous absentee ballots and absentee\nballot applications contained false and unauthorized entries, including forged signatures.  See id.\nat ยถ 3.  \nB. McNally Disqualification and Defendant's Appointment\nOn September 24, 2009, Rensselaer County District Attorney Richard J. McNally, Jr.\n(\"DA McNally\") filed a letter-application with Rensselaer County Court Judge Robert M. Jacon,\nstating that after review of the Lambertsen pleadings, he had concluded that a criminal\ninvestigation was appropriate.  See id. at ยถ 4.  To avoid the appearance of impropriety, DA\nMcNally disqualified himself from presiding over any matter related to the Lambertsen\nproceeding, including the investigation and prosecution, and requested the appointment of a\nSpecial Prosecutor for this purpose.  See id. at ยถ 5.\nOn September 28, 2009, Judge Jacon issued an order appointing Defendant Youel\n(\"Trey\") C. Smith as a Special Prosecutor for the investigation and \"for all purposes in this matter\nup to and including the disposition of this case[.]\" Id. at ยถ 6; Dkt. No. 237 at ยถ 6.  In his\nSeptember 28, 2009 order, Judge Jacon determined that DA McNally's disqualification was\nappropriate.  See Dkt. No. 223-1 at ยถ 7.  \nC. Lambertsen Hearing\nOn October 1, 2009, an evidentiary hearing in the Lambertsen proceeding was conducted\nin Rensselaer County Supreme Court.  See id. at ยถ 8.  On October 2, 2009, the court issued a\n4\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 5 of 60\nDecision and Order voiding numerous absentee ballots, finding that \"the testimony and affidavits\nreveal significant election law violations (see Election Law Article 17) that have compromised\nthe rights of numerous voters and the integrity of the election process in the Working Family's\n[sic] Party September 15, 2009 primary.\"  Id. at ยถ 9.  \nD.  Sara Couch\nOn October 22, 2009, State Police Investigator John Ogden, formerly a named defendant\nin this matter, obtained a sworn statement from Sara Couch, a WFP worker, describing certain\nrelevant events that occurred on September 15, 2009, the day of the primary, and thereafter.  See\nid. at ยถ 10.  In her sworn statement, Ms. Couch described a meeting that occurred the afternoon of\nthe primary, at LoPorto's Restaurant in downtown Troy.  See id. at ยถ 11.  Ms. Couch's statement\nalso described that, after the meeting, Michael LoPorto asked her to run an errand for him,\nproducing approximately thirty (30) absentee ballot envelopes wrapped in a newspaper, and\nstating \"'[t]here's a really good article in there that you should read.'\" Id. at ยถ 12 (quoting Dkt. No.\n99-13).  Ms. Couch indicated that Mr. LoPorto asked her to file the absentee ballots at the Board\nof Elections, only a few city blocks from LoPorto's Restaurant.  See id. at ยถ 13.  Ms. Couch stated\nthat she personally delivered the ballots to Plaintiff, the Democratic Commissioner of the\nRensselaer County Board of Elections, who stated that he knew what they were.  See id. at ยถ 14. \nMs. Couch indicated that she specifically asked for Plaintiff \"because he is the Democratic\nCommissioner and I thought at the time that when I give him something it will be handled\nproperly.\"  Dkt. No. 99-13 at 2-3.  As she was leaving, one of the secretaries in Plaintiff's office\nreturned one of the absentee ballots to Ms. Couch while she was waiting at the elevator because\nthe ballot was not signed by the voter.  See id. at 3.  \n5\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 6 of 60\nMs. Couch also recounted a September 24, 2009 meeting, again held at LoPorto's\nRestaurant, attended by several individuals associated with the Rensselaer County Democratic\nand WFP political parties, including Plaintiff.  See Dkt. No. 223-1 at ยถ 15.  According to Ms.\nCouch, Plaintiff opened the meeting by stating \"I don't mean to be a dickhead, but I want to make\nsure that this conversation isn't being recorded.  Does anyone have any type of recording\ndevice[?]\" Id. at ยถ 16.  Ms. Couch indicated that Plaintiff continued, stating \"[t]his is really, really\nbad, and it needs to go away.\"  Id. at ยถ 17.  Ms. Couch's statement continued as follows: \nEd said to Jim [Welch] and Brandt [Caird], \"Your names are on\nhere\"[.]  Jim Welch said, \"I've done nothing wrong[.]  The only\nthing I did wrong was to take a phone call from John Brown\"[.] \nThen Ed said to Brandt \"What are you going to do on the stand\nfacing eighteen counts of forgery\" and Brandt chuckled and said\n\"Tell the truth\".  Ed asked Brandt \"What about Figgy\" [DeFiglio's\nnickname].  Brandt didn't seem to understand and replied \"What\nabout Figgy\".  So Ed said again, this needs to go away.  He offered\nwhat he thought might be a solution.  He offered that he would\nreverse his vote on the absentee ballots and agree with Bugbee, and\nthe whole thing might go away.  I asked him \"Do you really think\nthat this can go away, this is going to Court\".  He indicated that he\nagreed.  Ed said that \"we\" could go to Mirch and try to make a deal\nwith him.  I knew the \"we\" he referred to was the WFP.  I replied\nthe WFP wasn't in a position to make any deals with anyone on this\nissue.  I thought to myself that he is asking us to commit a crime to\ncover up another crime and enter into a conspiracy.  \nId. at ยถ 18.2  \nE. Joseph Caird\nOn November 4, 2009, Joseph Caird, Vice-Chair of the Rensselaer County WFP, gave a\nsworn statement to Investigator Ogden.  See Dkt. No. 223-1 at ยถ 19.  Mr. Caird's statement\n2 The Court notes that Plaintiff denies \"as false the assertions in sentences 8-13 ('He\noffered ... this issue').\"  Dkt. No. 237 at ยถ 18.  Plaintiff is not denying that Ms. Couch gave this\nstatement, he simply claims that she was lying, without citing to any evidence in support of this\nassertion.  \n6\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 7 of 60\nindicated that he had attended the September 24, 2009 meeting at LoPorto's Restaurant and\nconfirmed Ms. Couch's description of Plaintiff's conduct at the meeting.  See id. at ยถ 20.3  Mr.\nCaird confirmed that Plaintiff, at the start of the meeting, stated that he did not want anyone to\nrecord the meeting with an electronic device.  See id. at ยถ 21.  Mr. Caird further stated that\nPlaintiff appeared \"very, very concerned\" about the Lambertsen lawsuit and thought he could\nmake a deal with the Republicans and Robert Mirch, a career Republican political operative.  See\nid. at ยถ 22.  \nF. Robert Mirch\nRobert Mirch was interviewed by Investigator Ogden on October 21, 2009.  See id. at ยถ\n23.  During the interview with Investigator Ogden, Mr. Mirch told him that, \"[b]ased on my forty\nfive years of experience working on local elections I was immediately concerned, alarmed and\nsuspicious [when told by Commissioner Bugbee that thirty-four, thirty-five absentee ballots for\nthe WFP for the City of Troy had gone out on September 14, 2009].  I knew that the number\nLarry had identified was completely out of the ordinary for that party in a primary election in the\nCity of Troy.\"  Id. at ยถ 24.  \nG. Larry Bugbee\nOn October 22, 2009, Commissioner Larry Bugbee, Plaintiff's Republican counterpart,\ntold Investigator Ogden that he \"was shocked to see there w[ere] thirty four absentee ballots for\nthe Working Family [sic] Party that had been released to the City of Troy.  In my experience in\n3 Throughout his response to Defendant's statement of material facts, Plaintiff denies\nDefendant's statements as \"mischaracterizations\" of the facts stated.  See, e.g., Dkt. No. 237 at ยถ\n20.  No reasonable mind could agree that many of these alleged \"mischaracterizations\" are, in\nfact, mischaracterizations.  As such, the Court will only address such denials when necessary.   \n7\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 8 of 60\npolitics and as Commissioner of the Board of Elections I would expect no more than ten of these\n[absentee] ballots to have been released.\"  Id. at ยถ 25.  \nH. Anthony DeFiglio\nOn November 6, 2009, Anthony DeFiglio gave a sworn statement to Investigator Ogden. \nSee id. at ยถ 26.  Defendant was not present when Mr. DeFiglio gave his statement.  See id. at ยถ 27\n(citing Dkt. No. 99-23 at 2-3).  Mr. DeFiglio's statement indicated that in late August or early\nSeptember, he and City Clerk Bill McInerney obtained absentee ballot applications from voters\nregistered in the WFP who resided in the Griswold Heights Public Housing Complex where Mr.\nDeFiglio worked as a clerk.  See id. at ยถ 28.  DeFiglio and McInerney obtained signed absentee\nballot applications from the voters, telling them they would \"take care of them getting a ballot.\" \nId. at ยถ 29.  However, \"it was common knowledge that these people were never going to receive\nan absentee [b]allot.\"  Id.  \nAccording to Mr. DeFiglio, Mr. McInerney took all the signed absentee ballot applications\nthat they obtained and he did not \"know what happened to them after he left.\"  Id. at ยถ 30.  Mr.\nDeFiglio indicated that he knew the voters would never receive the ballots, stating, \"this [was] an\nongoing scheme and it occurs on both sides of the aisle.\"  Id. at ยถ 31.  Mr. DeFiglio did not\nspecifically implicate Plaintiff in his statement; however, he stated, \"[w]ith the number of\n[b]allots [that] left the BOE it is obvious to me that red flags went up.  Larry Bugbee isn't stupid. \nI know that there is no possible way that the Democratic Commissioner of the BOE, Ed\nMcDonough, could not have known what was happening.\"  Id. at ยถ 32.  \nI. Edward McDonough\nOn November 19, 2009, Plaintiff was interviewed by Investigator Ogden and provided a\nsworn statement.  See Dkt. No. 223-1 at ยถ 34.  Plaintiff stated that on September 15, 2009,\n8\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 9 of 60\nCommissioner Bugbee told him that Robert Mirch \"had become aware that an inordina[te]\nnumber of absentee ballots for the WFP had gone out to the [F]ifth [C]ouncil [D]istrict.\"  Id. at ยถ\n35.  The day after the primary, September 16, 2009, Plaintiff stated that he spoke with William\nMcInerney, the Troy City Clerk, who told him that \"it wasn't as bad as it appears,\" and that \"he\nand his people had been to all of the apartments that were being contested.\"  Id.  \nPlaintiff further stated that on September 24, 2009, he received a call from John Brown,\none of the candidates for Troy City Council, asking Plaintiff to meet him at LoPorto's Restaurant. \nSee id. at ยถ 36.  Later that day, Plaintiff met with Brown, Couch, Caird, and Welch at LoPorto's\nRestaurant.  See id. at ยถ 37.  Plaintiff indicated that he \"had read the [voters'] affidavits prior to the\nmeeting.\"  Id.  In his statement, Plaintiff acknowledged that, at the meeting, \"we did discuss how\nto deal with the problem from this point forward.  I may or may not have stated that 'this has to go\naway', I don't specifically remember.\"  Id. at ยถ 38.  \nPlaintiff further stated that on September 14, 2009, around 10:00 a.m., John Brown came\ninto his office with a handful of applications for absentee ballots.  See id. at ยถ 39.  Plaintiff told\nBrown that they would take some time to process and Brown said he could not wait.  See id. at ยถ\n40.  Plaintiff told Brown that he would \"drop the ballots ... at City Hall.\"  Id. at ยถ 41.  Later that\nday, Plaintiff \"dropped off somewhere between ten and twenty ballots off at City Hall.\"  Id. at ยถ\n42.  In Investigator Ogden's summary of this interview, he states that \"McDonough did not\nspecify upon questioning who he gave the ballots to at City Hall.\"  Id. at ยถ 43.  \nOn December 7, 2009, Plaintiff again met with Investigator Ogden to \"clarify\" his\ndelivery of the absentee ballots to City Hall.  See id. at ยถ 44.  In the second sworn statement,\nPlaintiff stated as follows: \n9\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 10 of 60\nI would like to clarify that statement to say that I dropped off those\nabsentee ballots to the desk of the City [C]lerk, Bill McInerney. \nBill was not in his office but I did place those ballots on his desk. \nThey were the ballots that were generated from the applications that\nI received from John Brown earlier in the day.  \nId. at ยถ 45 (quoting Dkt. No. 99-26 at 2).  \nOn January 27, 2010, Plaintiff was interviewed by Defendant.  See Dkt. No. 223-1 at ยถ 46. \nAt his 50-h hearing testimony, Plaintiff testified that at the January 27, 2010 meeting, Defendant\ndescribed how years before, Plaintiff's father had snubbed him at a political fundraiser and\ndeclined to endorse him for district attorney.  See id. at ยถ 47.  According to Plaintiff, at the\nJanuary 27, 2010 meeting, Defendant stated \"[t]his is my opportunity to fuck you like your father\nfucked me.\"  Id.4  Plaintiff testified at the 50-h hearing that he initially laughed at Defendant's\ncomment and acknowledged that, although Investigator Ogden was present for the January 27,\n2010 interview, he was not in the room when this comment was made.  See Dkt. No. 223-4 at 80-\n89.  Plaintiff further testified that Defendant acted in a hostile manner towards him during the\n4 The Court notes that, while Plaintiff testified at his June 25, 2013 50-h hearing that\nDefendant made this comment, it is notably absent from his February 24, 2011 affidavit in\nsupport of his motion to disqualify Defendant as special prosecutor.  See Dkt. No. 239-6. \nAlthough Plaintiff recounts the January 27, 2010 interview with Defendant and that Defendant\nmade threats of criminal prosecution and referenced Plaintiff's father's rejection of Defendant as a\npossible candidate for District Attorney, no mention is made of Defendant stating \"[t]his is my\nopportunity to fuck you like your father fucked me\" or anything even closely resembling such a\ncomment.  See id. at ยถยถ 17-25.  Similarly, no mention of this interaction is made in Plaintiff's\ncounsel's February 24, 2011 affidavit, despite recounting that interview and all of the ways\nDefendant was perceived as biased against his client.  See Dkt. No. 239-33 at ยถยถ 145-52.  Rather,\nPlaintiff recounts that Defendant stated Plaintiff's father decided that Lou Catone would become\nthe candidate for District Attorney and that \"it was probably best that 'things turned out the way\nthey did.'\" Dkt. No. 239-6 at ยถ 22.  Plaintiff took this comment to be Defendant alluding to the\nfact that Lou Catone lost that election due to the publicity of the federal criminal investigation\ninto Plaintiff's father.  See id.  Plaintiff further recalls that as Investigator Ogden returned to the\nroom, Defendant concluded by stating as follows: \"'in finishing what I was talking about, I think\nyou can now see how it is ironic that now we are here, I am Special Prosecutor and I have the\nability to make you King for the Day.'\" Id. at ยถ 23.       \n10\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 11 of 60\ninterview and repeatedly stated how important and busy he was.  See id.  Plaintiff claimed that, at\none point during the interview, Defendant mentioned something about being \"king or queen for\nthe day,\" which sounded to Plaintiff as if Defendant was asking him to tell him about the\nsupposed \"forgery factory\" and that Plaintiff would not be prosecuted in the underlying criminal\nprobe, despite the fact that Defendant never mentioned Plaintiff's possible cooperation.  See Dkt.\nNo. 223-1 at ยถ 49; see also Dkt. No. 237 at ยถ 49.  After repeatedly telling Defendant that he had\nalready told Investigator Ogden everything that he knew regarding the alleged forged absentee\nballots, Plaintiff ended the January 27, 2010 interview.  See id. at ยถ 50.5  \nAt his September 30, 2021 deposition, Plaintiff acknowledged that he did not tell\nInvestigator Ogden on November 19, 2009 or December 7, 2009 โ or in his two sworn statements\nโ that the fields on the applications delivered by John Brown on September 14, 2009 were blank;\nthat John Brown made several phone calls in Plaintiff's office that morning related to completing\nthe blank fields in the applications; or any other details regarding what transpired in his office that\nmorning.  See Dkt. No. 223-5 at 32-41, 115-21.  Plaintiff also acknowledged at his deposition that\nhe intentionally lied in his December 7, 2009 sworn statement in order to protect Mr. McInerney,\ndespite being aware that his statement was given under penalty of perjury.  See id. at 117-19.  In\nhis November 19, 2009 sworn statement, Plaintiff falsely stated that Mr. McInerney \"was not in\n5 In his affidavit in response to Plaintiff's motion to dismiss the indictment and for\nDefendant to be disqualified from the prosecution of the criminal case, Defendant explained that\nit was his intention during the January 27, 2010 interview to make Plaintiff \"psychologically\nuncomfortable,\" and to get him \"to tell me the truth about the identity of those who had forged\nabsentee ballots in this case.\"  Dkt. No. 239-13 at 14.  He further indicated that the purpose of the\nmeeting was not to gather evidence against Plaintiff, but to get Plaintiff to be more forthcoming\nregarding the culpability of others, including McInerney.  See id.  Finally, the affidavit made clear\nthat no relevant evidence against Plaintiff was generated from that interview and that evidence of\nthat meeting was not used by Defendant either before the grand jury or at the two criminal trials. \nSee id. at 14-16.   \n11\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 12 of 60\nhis office, but I did place those ballots on his desk.\"  Id.  Plaintiff, in fact, personally gave the\nballots to Mr. McInerney in a manila envelope and then engaged him in conversation.  See id. at\n59-61.  \nJ. Kevin McGrath Cooperation\nFollowing his January 27, 2010 interview with Plaintiff, Defendant had conversations\nwith Peter Moschetti, Esq., the attorney for Kevin McGrath, a candidate for Troy Common\nCouncil in the 2009 primary, regarding a potential Cooperation Agreement with McGrath.  See\nDkt. No. 223-1 at ยถ 55.  These discussions culminated in a meeting on March 12, 2010, at\nDefendant's office between Defendant, Investigators Ogden and Fancher, Mr. McGrath, and Mr.\nMoschetti.  See id. at ยถ 56.  At the March 12, 2010 meeting, a proffer was made by Mr. McGrath,\nfollowed by execution of a Cooperation Agreement.  See id. at ยถ 57.  The Cooperation Agreement\nentered into by Mr. McGrath provided, generally, that in exchange for McGrath's truthful\ntestimony and continued cooperation, he would receive immunity from prosecution and that his\nfailure to cooperate in the preparation and investigation of any case or to testify would be a\nbreach of the agreement, which would permit Defendant to void the agreement and subsequently\nprosecute McGrath.  See id. at ยถ 58; see also Dkt. No. 237 at ยถ 58.  \nAfter McGrath executed the Cooperation Agreement, a more detailed discussion of\nMcGrath's potential testimony was then conducted.  See id. at ยถ 59.  Subsequently, Investigator\nFancher drafted a proposed typewritten statement which McGrath executed on March 29, 2010. \nSee id. at ยถ 60.  According to this statement, on August 24, 2009, he observed Plaintiff falsely\ncomplete the excuse fields on the absentee ballot applications of Thomas Dickinson and Jennifer\nTaylor.  See id. at ยถ 61.  McGrath's statement further indicated that on September 14, 2009, the\nday before the WFP primary, he was in Plaintiff's office at the Board of Elections when Plaintiff\n12\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 13 of 60\nand John Brown discussed the need to enter names in the blank \"release to\" fields on numerous\nabsentee ballot applications.  See id. at ยถ 62.  McGrath stated that Jim Welch, the local chair of\nthe WFP, was suggested as a possible candidate and Brown proceeded to call Welch on his cell\nphone.  See id. at ยถ 63.  McGrath heard Brown ask Welch if he could use his name in the \"release\nto\" field on numerous applications for absentee ballots.  See id. at ยถ 64.  After the call ended,\nBrown told Plaintiff that Welch had consented.  See id. at ยถ 65.  At this point, Plaintiff told\nMcGrath and Brown to leave the office \"because they were candidates.\"  Id. at ยถ 66.  McGrath\nstated that he assumed that Plaintiff meant that he did not want them to witness him entering\nWelch's name in the \"release to\" fields on the applications.  See id. at ยถ 67.6  \nAt his deposition, McGrath testified that his March 29, 2010 typewritten statement\nrepresents what he told Defendant and the two New York State Police Investigators on March 12,\n2010, and that there is nothing that he would change or add to his statement.  See id. at ยถ 69. \nMcGrath further testified that, after his meeting with Defendant and the investigators on March\n12, 2010 and on March 29, 2010, when he executed his statement, he did not recall meeting with\nDefendant at any other times other than to prepare for his grand jury and trial testimony.  See id.\nat ยถ 70 (citing Dkt. No. 223-7 at 68-70).  At his deposition, McGrath testified that Defendant\nnever asked him to \"provide information against Ed McDonough\" nor did Defendant state \"that it\n6 The Court notes that Plaintiff denies that he wrote false excuses on the absentee ballot\napplications as alleged in paragraph 61 and he denies that any such discussion occurred as alleged\nin paragraphs 62 through 67.

On December 6, 2010, in preparation for his December 8, 2010 grand jury testimony,\nDeFiglio met with Defendant and Investigator Ogden and entered into a Cooperation Agreement,\nwhich provided he would plead to an unspecified crime in exchange for his continued cooperation\nand truthful testimony.  See id. at ยถ 73.  DeFiglio testified at his deposition that he never spoke\nwith Plaintiff at any time leading up to the 2009 WFP primary about collecting fraudulent ballot\napplications.  See id. at ยถ 82.  In fact, DeFiglio indicated that he had no dealings or contact with\nPlaintiff at all concerning the solicitation of absentee ballots.  See id. at ยถ 83.  \nL. Grand Jury\nOn December 7, 2010, Defendant, as Special Prosecutor, empaneled a Rensselaer County\ngrand jury to consider criminal charges against Plaintiff and Michael LoPorto.

See id. at ยถยถ 88-89.  Ms. Robinson testified that, at\nDefendant's request, she extracted DNA from the glue flap of numerous absentee ballot\nenvelopes.  She then compared the DNA extracted from the envelopes with the DNA profiles of\nseveral of the suspects of the investigation, including Plaintiff's DNA, which was obtained\npursuant to a court order.  See id. at ยถ 90.  Ms. Robinson testified that the DNA taken from the\nglue flaps of absentee ballot envelopes for voters Suozzo and Testa matched the DNA sample\nprovided by Plaintiff.

Kevin O'Malley\nKevin O'Malley, who was employed by the Rensselaer County Board of Election as\nCustodian of Records in September of 2009, testified before the grand jury on December 9 and\n15, 2010.  See id. at ยถยถ 92-93.  During his initial grand jury testimony, Defendant believed that\nO'Malley was being evasive when answering questions regarding his activities with Plaintiff on\nSeptember 14, 2009.  See id. at ยถ 94.  On December 13, 2010, Defendant emailed Investigators\nOgden and Fancher, directing them to contact O'Malley to let him know that he wanted to discuss\nthe possibility of O'Malley testifying a second time before the grand jury.  See Dkt. No. 239-27 at\n1.  In that email, Defendant asked the investigators to inform O'Malley that \"under the law a\nwitness who has perjured himself before the grand jury can 'cure' the perjury if he promptly\ncorrects it before the same grand jury and that this is the topic I wish to discuss with him.\"  Id. \nAdditionally, Defendant reiterated what was known about O'Malley's involvement in the alleged\nabsentee ballot fraud and concluded that O'Malley \"has immunity for everything but perjury.\"  Id.\nAt his deposition, O'Malley recounted that Defendant called him before his return to the\ngrand jury, and stated that \"my answers were vague and some were untruthful and that I should\n15\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 16 of 60\nseek counsel.\"  Dkt. No. 223-1 at ยถ 96.  O'Malley then called his sister-in-law, an attorney, who\nadvised him that he needed an attorney and arranged for Andrew Safranko, Esq. to represent him. \nSee id. at ยถ 97.  O'Malley testified at his deposition that he met with Mr. Safranko before his\nreturn to the grand jury, told him that his initial testimony was false, and further informed him\nwhat his truthful testimony would be.  See id. at ยถ 98.  Mr. Safranko told O'Malley to tell the truth\nwhen he returned to the grand jury.  See id. at ยถ 99.  \nDuring his return appearance before the grand jury on December 15, 2010, O'Malley\nidentified his handwriting or printing in the \"Excuse\" fields on the absentee ballot applications of\nDemetrius Banks, Maritza Berrios, Diane Jordan, Michael Rebel, Bridget Ryan, and Jolene\nVanVranken.  See id. at ยถ 100.  O'Malley also testified that his boss, Plaintiff, called him into his\noffice on September 14, 2009, and instructed him to make those false entries.  See id. at ยถ 101.7 \nO'Malley repeated this testimony at Plaintiff's two subsequent criminal trials and at his November\n18, 2020 deposition.  See id. at ยถ 102.  O'Malley further testified that he was never pressured to\ngive testimony incriminating Plaintiff, other than his attorney instructing him to tell the truth\nwhen he returned to testify before the grand jury.  See id. at ยถ 103.  \n4. Investigator Ogden\nInvestigator Ogden testified before the grand jury on January 31, 2011.  See Dkt. No. 223-\n1 at ยถ 104.  Prior to his grand jury testimony, Investigator Ogden obtained New York State\nDepartment of Motor Vehicles records of Plaintiff's handwriting.  See id. at ยถ 105.  During\nInvestigator Ogden's grand jury testimony, Defendant presented for the grand jurors' review, a\n7 Again, Plaintiff relies on his own affidavit from the underlying criminal case to deny that\nhe engaged in this conduct but does not deny the fact that O'Malley testified that this occurred. \nSee Dkt.

See id. at ยถ 106.  In his\ngrand jury testimony, Investigator Ogden observed, \"[g]enerally speaking, most of the excuses\nappear to be written in the same hand.\"  Id. at ยถ 107.  In response to a question by a grand juror,\nInvestigator Ogden testified that the handwriting at several locations on the applications\n\"appeared to be the same as\" Plaintiff's handwriting from the Department of Motor Vehicle\nexemplars.  See id. at ยถ 108.  During his deposition, Investigator Ogden testified that this was his\nopinion, which he discussed with Defendant prior to his grand jury testimony.  See id. at ยถ 109. \nInvestigator Ogden further testified that he never fabricated evidence, never encouraged any\nwitnesses to fabricate evidence, and had no personal knowledge of Defendant fabricating\nevidence.  See id. at ยถ 110.  \n5. Indictment\nOn January 28, 2011, the grand jury returned an indictment which charged Plaintiff with\nthirty-eight (38) counts of forgery in the second degree, in violation of New York Penal Law ยง\n170.10(2), and thirty-six (36) counts of criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second\ndegree, in violation of New York Penal Law ยง 170.25.  See id. at ยถ 111.  Plaintiff filed successive\nmotions for dismissal of the indictment on multiple grounds, including Defendant's alleged\nmisconduct before the grand jury.  See id. at ยถ 112.  Each motion was denied, with the court\nstating that, after review of the grand jury minutes, it could \"find no hint of prosecutorial\nmisconduct[.]\" Id. at ยถ 113.  \nM. 2007-2008 McInerney Election Forgeries Investigation\n17\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 18 of 60\nOn November 17, 2010, Rensselaer County Republican Commissioner of Elections Larry\nBugbee delivered twenty (20) absentee applications and ballots from the 2007-2008 election\ncycles to Defendant, alleged by Bugbee to have been forged by William McInerney.  See Dkt. No.\n223-1 at ยถ 114.  Defendant subsequently forwarded these materials to Investigators Ogden and\nFancher for their review.  See id. at ยถ 115.  Between May 27 and June 21, 2011, Investigators\nOgden and Fancher obtained affidavits from twenty (20) 2007-2008 voters.  See id. at ยถ 116.  On\nJune 23-24, 2011, Investigator Ogden provided Defendant with copies of the affidavits from the\n2007-2008 voters, which allegedly established McInerney's criminal responsibility for these\nforgeries.  See id. at ยถ 117.  In November 2009, McInerney declined an interview by the State\nPolice and subsequently retained an attorney, James Long, Esq.  See id. at ยถ 118.  \n1. McInerney Cooperation\nIn early July 2011, Defendant discussed the evidence of McInerney's 2007-2008 election\nforgeries with Mr. Long.  See id. at ยถ 119.  Shortly thereafter, Mr. Long advised Defendant that\nMcInerney wanted to explore a plea and Cooperation Agreement with the prosecution.  See id. at\nยถ 120.  On July 6, 2011, in a meeting with Defendant, Investigators Ogden and Fancher, and Mr.\nLong, McInerney signed a Use Immunity Agreement and provided information incriminating\nhimself, John Brown, Michael LoPorto, Plaintiff, and others.  See id. at ยถ 121.  At one point\nduring the July 6, 2011 meeting, Mr. Long terminated the interview, stating \"that was all we were\ngetting until the Coop Agreement is signed and approved by Judge Pulver.\"  Id. at ยถ 122.  \nOn July 18, 2011, Mr. Long and Defendant participated in a conference call with Judge\nPulver during which the proposed plea arrangement with McInerney was discussed, as well as the\nneed for Defendant to have his authority enlarged to the 2007-2008 ballot fraud committed by\nMcInerney.  See id. at ยถ 123.  Judge Pulver conditionally approved the proposed plea agreement\n18\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 19 of 60\nwith McInerney, reserving sentencing to his discretion.  See id. at ยถ 124.  On July 22, 2011,\nMcInerney signed a Cooperation Agreement, which required him to provide truthful information\nand to cooperate with the Special Prosecutor (Defendant), the New York State Police, and, if\nrequested, the United States Attorney and FBI.  See id. at ยถยถ 125-26.  \nOn August 5, 2011, Defendant conducted a debriefing of McInerney in the presence of his\nattorney.  See id. at ยถ 127.  On August 8, 2011, Defendant's prosecutorial authority was enlarged\nby court order to include the 2007-2008 crimes committed by McInerney.  See id. at ยถ 128.  \n2. Special Grand Jury Authorization\nOn August 10, 2011, Defendant applied to the Honorable George B. Ceresia, Jr.,\nAdministrative Judge for the Third Judicial District, for the impanelment of a special grand jury. \nSee Dkt. No. 223-1 at ยถ 129.  Defendant's supporting affirmation stated as follows: \"Recently\ndiscovered evidence implicates other individuals in the September 15, 2009 ballot fraud, and the\nPeople intend to present the case against these individuals to a grand jury.  Depending on the\nevidence and circumstances as they develop, there could be as many as five individuals indicted.\" \nId. at ยถ 130.  On August 15, 2011, an administrative order was issued authorizing the\nimpanelment of an additional grand jury commencing September 6, 2011, and continuing through\nMarch 5, 2012.  See id. at ยถ 131.  \n3. McInerney Cooperation and Plea\nOn August 15, 2011, Defendant continued his debriefing of McInerney in the presence of\ncounsel.  See id. at ยถ 132.  On August 26, 2011, pursuant to the terms of his Cooperation\nAgreement, McInerney entered a guilty plea to the crime of forgery in the second degree, a class\nD felony.  See id. at ยถ 133.  \n19\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 20 of 60\nOn September 6, 2011, Defendant impaneled the special grand jury.  See id. at ยถ 134.  On\nSeptember 16, 2011, pursuant to his Cooperation Agreement and in preparation for his grand jury\ntestimony, McInerney executed a sworn statement.  See id.  In his September 16, 2011 statement,\nMcInerney implicated Anthony Renna in the forgery of four absentee ballots Renna procured\nfrom the Mamone residences on Jackson Street.  See id. at ยถ 135.  In his statement, McInerney\nalso stated that he observed John Brown completing the four ballots after Renna returned with\nthose unvoted ballots.  See id. at ยถ 136.  On November 22, 2011, McInerney testified before the\nspecial grand jury.  See id. at ยถ 137.    \n4. John Brown\nInitially, John Brown retained counsel and declined to be interviewed.  See id. at ยถ 138. \nJohn Brown did not testify before the grand jury that indicted Plaintiff.  See id. at ยถ 139.  \nOn October 27, 2011, Brown appeared voluntarily with his attorney before the special\ngrand jury.  See id. at ยถ 140.  While testifying before the special grand jury, Brown was\nquestioned at length by Defendant during which he provided the names of absentee ballot\napplications he had handled on other party lines in the 2009 primary: DeFabio, Pettit, and\nTangredi.  See id. at ยถ 141.  \nSubsequently, at Defendant's direction, Investigators Ogden and Fancher interviewed\nvoters DeFabio and Tangredi who implicated Brown in the forgery of their absentee ballot\napplications and ballot envelopes.  See id. at ยถ 142.  On December 6, 2011, confronted with this\nevidence, Brown signed a Use Immunity Agreement and after a proffer of information, executed a\nCooperation Agreement.  See id. at ยถ 143.  The next morning, Brown was interviewed at length\nby Investigators Ogden and Fancher.  See id. at ยถ 144.  Subsequently, Investigator Fancher\nprepared a draft of Brown's statement and forwarded it to Brown's attorney for review.  See id. at\n20\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 21 of 60\nยถ 145.  Brown then made changes to the statement, which he initialed and signed on December 9,\n2011.  See id. at ยถ 146.  At his September 27, 2021 deposition, Brown testified that, upon review,\nthere was nothing in his December 9, 2011 statement that he would change.  See id. at ยถ 147.  \nIn his December 9, 2011 statement, Brown stated that on September 14, 2009, after\nstopping at McInerney's office, he brought absentee ballot applications that had been collected by\nhimself and others to the BOE in an envelope.  See id. at ยถ 148.  Before he left, McInerney told\nhim to be sure to \"give the envelope directly to Ed McDonough.\"  Id. at ยถ 149 (quoting Dkt. No.\n223-17 at 5).  When he arrived at the BOE on September 14, 2009, he gave his own four (4)\napplications (DeFabio, Pettit, Tangredi, and Daniel) to Mary Sweeney at the front counter,\nrequesting ballots.  See id. at ยถ 150.  Brown then slid the envelope containing the other\napplications received from McInerney across the counter and told Sweeney that the envelope was\nfor Plaintiff.  See id.  Sweeney told Brown that Plaintiff was in his office and that he could go\nright in.  See id. at ยถ 151.  \nUpon entering his office, Brown stated that Plaintiff took the applications out of the\nenvelope and said \"they need excuses and they can't be 'Temporary Illness.'\" Dkt. No. 223-1 at ยถ\n152.8  Brown told Plaintiff that he did not know what the excuses were and Plaintiff then asked\nBrown who the ballots were supposed to be released to \"'as none of them had that field filled in\neither.'\" Id. at ยถ 153.  Brown stated that he suggested putting his own name in the fields, but\nPlaintiff rejected the idea.  See id. at ยถ 154.  Brown then called McInerney and told him \"Ed wants\n8 Plaintiff again denies that he made such a statement or that this interaction occurred,\nagain relying on his own affidavit from a motion filed in the underlying criminal case.  See Dkt.\nNo. 237 at ยถ 152 (citing Dkt. No. 239-6 at 5).  Plaintiff raises the same objection to paragraphs\n152 through 165 of Defendant's statement of material facts, but does not deny the fact that\nBrown's December 9, 2011 statement makes these allegations or that they are misrepresented in\nDefendant's statement of material facts.  \n21\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 22 of 60\nto know whom the ballots were to be released to.\"  Id. at ยถ 155.  McInerney said to put the names\nof WFP people in the fields so Robert Mirch would not know that this was a Democratic effort to\ncontrol the WFP line.  See id. at ยถ 156.  Brown then called several WFP people and received\npermission from Jim Welch and Brent Caird to put their names in the blank fields.  See id. at ยถ\n157.  During the time Brown was on the phone, Kevin McGrath came into the office, in a hurry,\nwith an application, and gave it to Plaintiff.  See id. at ยถ 158.  When Plaintiff asked McGrath what\nthe excuse was, McGrath responded \"he's old, can't you just put that in?\"  Id. at ยถยถ 159-60. \nBrown stated that he then observed Plaintiff fill out information on that ballot application and\nsummon someone from the outer office to whom he gave the application.  See id. at ยถ 161.  That\nindividual returned in a few minutes with a ballot for McGrath.  See id.  \nBrown stated that he was in McDonough's office for thirty-to-forty minutes and observed\nPlaintiff writing on documents on his desk.  See id. at ยถ 162.  Brown could not say that Plaintiff\nwas making entries on the applications that he brought in, but those applications were on top of\nthe papers on Plaintiff's desk.  See id. at ยถ 163.  When McGrath received his ballot and Brown\nreceived his four ballots, Plaintiff allegedly told them that \"you guys should get going,\" and they\nleft.  Id. at ยถ 164.  \nBrown testified that he had never spoken with Defendant prior to his October 27, 2011\ngrand jury testimony and December 6, 2011 Cooperation Agreement.  See id. at ยถ 165.  Brown\ntestified that he spoke with Defendant three times as a cooperating witness: the day he signed his\nCooperation Agreement; in preparation for his return to the grand jury; and in preparation for\ntestifying at trial.  See id. at ยถ 166.  Through his deposition testimony, Brown confirmed his\ndiscussions with Defendant and his grand jury and trial testimony were conducted pursuant to the\nCooperation Agreement.  See id. at ยถ 167.  \n22\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 23 of 60\n5. Anthony Renna\nIn his September 16, 2011 statement, McInerney implicated Anthony Renna in the forgery\nof four unvoted absentee ballots Renna procured from the Mamone residences on Jackson Street. \nSee id. at ยถ 168.  Subsequently, Investigators Ogden and Fancher interviewed Renna at the New\nYork State Police barracks, producing two written statements.  See id. at ยถ 169.  In his October\n20, 2011 statement, Renna admitted his complicity in the forgery of the four Mamone voters'\nballots.  See id. at ยถ 170.  Renna also admitted telling DeFiglio, at McInerney's request, that they\nhad an attorney for him, they supported him, and that they would get him a job when it was all\nover.  See id. at ยถ 171.  Renna further admitted to forging the voter Testa's application, as well as\neleven of fifteen applications from the 2007 election cycle.  See id. at ยถ 172.  In his November 9,\n2011 statement, Renna stated as follows: \"I'm relatively certain that I completed Peter Testa's\nBallot while I was in Ed McDonough's office at the Board of Elections.  Ed was in the office\nwhen I voted the Ballot.\"  Id. at ยถ 173.  \nOn December 5, 2011, Renna and his attorney met with Defendant at Defendant's office\nwhere a Use Immunity Agreement and a Cooperation Agreement were signed.  See id. at ยถ 174. \nThe Cooperation Agreement provided that, as long as Renna cooperated with the prosecution and\ngave truthful testimony, he would be allowed to plead to a single count of forgery in the second\ndegree.  See id. at ยถ 175; see also Dkt. No. 237 at ยถ 175.  On December 6, 2011, Renna testified\nbefore the grand jury.  See id. at ยถ 177.  At his deposition, Renna testified that neither Defendant,\nnor Investigators Ogden or Fancher asked him to give false or fabricated testimony.  See id. at ยถ\n178.  On December 20, 2011, Renna pled guilty to forgery in the second degree, a felony.  See\nid. at ยถ 180.  \nN.

Anthony DeFiglio\nAnthony DeFiglio, who became temporarily homeless during the underlying criminal\nmatter, pled guilty to an unspecified charge and entered into a Cooperation Agreement.  He was\nsentenced to 100 hours of community service and no probation, assuming he remained out of\n24\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 25 of 60\ntrouble for three years.  Dkt. No. 223-6 at 102-04, 124.  Mr. DeFiglio previously worked for the\nTroy Housing Authority where much of the fraud took place.  See id. at 133.  The Troy Record\nalso reported that Mr. DeFiglio was homeless and that he suffered from mental illness.  \n2. William McInerney\nWilliam McInerney was the Troy City Clerk.  He pled guilty to one felony and sentenced\nto 90 days sheriff's work-release program, in satisfaction of all of his 2007, 2008, and 2009\nabsentee ballot crimes.  The agreement called for the sentence to be left for the sentencing judge\nto decide at the time of sentencing.  See Dkt. No. 240-6 at ยถ 150.  Additionally, the plea\nagreement called for him to resign from his office as Troy City Clerk.  See Dkt. No. 223-6 at 287-\n88. \n3. John Brown\nJohn Brown was a Troy City Councilman who was up for reelection.  He pled guilty to\none felony (criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree), with the plea\nagreement providing that the prosecution would recommend a sentence of six months in jail and\nfive years of probation, with the ultimate sentence to be decided by the Court.  Approximately\ntwo weeks prior to his sentencing date, Brown entered into a Cooperation Agreement, but that\nwas not mentioned during his sentencing.  It did, however, lead Defendant and the probation\ndepartment to recommend a lighter sentence than what was originally agreed to (intermittent\nweekend incarceration was recommended).  See People v. Brown, 119 A.D.3d 980 (3d Dep't\n2014).  Despite the recommendation, the court sentenced Brown to six months, followed by five\nyears of probation.  This was in satisfaction for his perjury in the Lambertsen hearing and Special\nGrand Jury, as well as his absentee ballot fraud and forgery.  See Dkt. No. 240-6 at ยถ 159.\n4. Anthony Renna\n25\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 26 of 60\nAnthony Renna entered into a cooperation agreement and was sentenced to 100 hours of\ncommunity service.  See Dkt. No. 185 at ยถ 986.  At the second criminal trial, Mr. Renna was\nasked to leave the stand and escorted out of the courtroom \"on the basis that his testimony was\npatently incredible\" and because he changed his testimony a number of times.  See Dkt. No. 223-6\nat 321-22, 232-36.  At his deposition, Mr. Renna admitted that he is bipolar and has a \"chemical\nimbalance, and I think sometimes it does inhibit me understanding and answering properly.\"  Dkt.\nNo. 223-18 at 83, 155-60.  Despite this, Mr. Renna stated at his deposition that he did not lie in\nany of his statements or at trial.  See id.  During his deposition, Mr. Renna indicated that he was\ncurrently taking medication for his condition.  See id. at 84.  At sentencing, Defendant indicated\nthat Mr. Renna had voided his cooperation agreement when he changed his testimony during the\nsecond trial, which had to be stricken, dealing a \"significant blow\" to Defendant's case. \nAccording to the Troy Record, Defendant declined to state what he thought would be a fair\nsentence for Mr. Renna, indicating that he \"would have to hear why he changed his testimony.\" \nMr. Renna's attorney told the sentencing court that Mr. Renna's \"bi-polar disorder led to his\nclient's conflicting testimony during trial.\"\n5. Kevin McGrath\nKevin McGrath was running for reelection to the Troy City Council during the time in\nquestion and is the brother of Judge McGrath of the New York State Supreme Court.  See Dkt.\nNo. 185 at 3.  He signed an immunity agreement that promised he would not be charged\ncriminally in exchange for his truthful testimony and cooperation.  See Dkt. No. 240-6 at ยถ 81. \nAccording to Defendant's deposition testimony, the decision was made not to prosecute him\nbecause, of the witnesses they had against him who were interviewed by the State Police, \"none\nof them wanted to see Mr. McGrath prosecuted.\" Dkt. No. 223-6 at 144-45.  During Investigator\n26\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 27 of 60\nOgden's deposition, it was indicated that at least one of the witnesses was related by marriage to\nMcGrath and that other potential witnesses refused to speak with the State Police, or were\notherwise not inclined to provide evidence against him.  See Dkt. No. 224-2 at 35-36, 126-29.  As\nsuch, the quality of evidence against him was not great and his cooperation was determined to be\nmore important.  See id.  \nIII. DISCUSSION\nA. Waiver\nInitially, Plaintiff contends that Defendant abandoned and waived any absolute immunity\ndefense or argument as to his fabricated evidence claim since he failed to raise the argument in\nhis initial motion to dismiss or on appeal before either the Second Circuit or the Supreme Court. \nSee Dkt. No. 237-3 at 11-23.  Defendant disagrees, arguing that he sufficiently raised the issue\nbefore this Court and on appeal.  See Dkt. No. 240-7 at 6-9.  Further, Defendant contends that,\nnotwithstanding any alleged failure to raise the issue on appeal, the law is clear that with the\nreversal of this Court's ruling on the fabricated evidence claim, \"the claim 'reverted back to the\nprior, pre-trial status.'\" Dkt. No. 223-2 at 36 (quoting Brown v. City of New York, 862 F.3d 182,\n185 (2d Cir. 2017)).  \"Consequently, this Court is not constrained from entertaining defendant's\nmotion(s) relating to issues not previously decided, including dispositive motions relating to\nabsolute or qualified immunity.\"  Id. (citations omitted).  \nPlaintiff's argument merits little discussion.  As Plaintiff acknowledges at the beginning of\nhis argument, \"defendant previously moved to dismiss plaintiff's fabricated evidence claim based\non absolute immunity.\"  Dkt. No. 237-3 at 11.  Plaintiff continues by claiming that, \"[i]n doing so,\nhe advanced no argument in his initial Rule 12 motion or on appeal to the Second Circuit or\nbefore the United States Supreme Court that a prosecutor has absolute immunity for investigative\n27\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 28 of 60\nfabrication of evidence.\"  Id.  Why would Defendant advance this argument on appeal in\naddressing Plaintiff's fabricated evidence claim, when the issue was not addressed by this Court in\ndismissing the claim?  \nIn its September 30, 2016 Memorandum-Decision and Order, after dismissing the\nfabrication of evidence claim on statute of limitations grounds, the Court stated that it \"will not\naddress the merits of the individual Defendants' arguments that Plaintiff failed to state a claim for\nhis fabrication of evidence cause of action.\"  McDonough v. Smith, No. 1:15-cv-1505, 2016 WL\n5717263, *12 (N.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2016).  Three months later, in its December 30, 2016\nMemorandum-Decision and Order, the Court determined that Defendant was entitled to absolute\nimmunity with respect to Plaintiff's claims of malicious prosecution and conspiracy to commit\nmalicious prosecution.  See McDonough v. Smith, No. 1:15-cv-1505, 2016 WL 7496128, *10\n(N.D.N.Y. Dec. 30, 2016).  The Court explained the difference between a prosecutor's\ninvestigative and prosecutorial functions was immaterial as to the malicious prosecution claim;\nadding, however, that \"if Plaintiff's fabrication of evidence claim was timely ... then the\ndistinction between the investigative and prosecutorial actions would be relevant.\"  Id. \nCharacterizing this statement by the Court on December 30, 2016 as a \"ruling,\" Plaintiff\nargues that Defendant was required to cross-appeal from the Court's statement.  See Dkt. No. 237-\n3 at 13-16, 19-21.  This statement was not a \"ruling;\" it was simply an observation that the\ninvestigative/prosecutorial distinction would be \"relevant\" if the fabrication of evidence claim\nwas timely.  It was not an appealable \"ruling.\"  Moreover, the Second Circuit has held that an\nappellee is not required, upon pain of subsequent waiver, to raise every possible alternative\nground upon which the lower court could have decided an issue.  See Brown v. City of New York,\n862 F.3d 182, 186 (2d Cir. 2017).  Rather, \"[t]he role of the appellee is to defend the decision of\n28\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 29 of 60\nthe lower court.\"  Id.  Thereafter, upon reversal, the lower court is free to consider defenses\npreviously raised and not previously decided.  See id. at 185.  \nAdditionally, the Court notes that Plaintiff's argument that Defendant was required to raise\nthis issue before the Supreme Court is entirely frivolous.  The Supreme Court granted certiorari to\ndecide the limited question of when \"'the statute of limitations for a Section 1983 claim based\nupon fabrication of evidence in criminal proceedings begins to run.'\" McDonough v. Smith, ___\nU.S. ___, 139 S. Ct. 2149, 2161 (2019) (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Given the limited nature of the\nquestion before the Supreme Court, any discussion of prosecutorial immunity by Defendant\nwould have been inappropriate.  \nEven assuming that Defendant had failed to raise this defense previously, his failure to do\nso would have been entirely understandable.  Plaintiff's original complaint is exceedingly long\n(certainly not a short and plain statement of the case) and certainly not a model of clarity. \nAdditionally, before this Court, the Second Circuit, and the Supreme Court, Plaintiff has been\neither unwilling or unable to expressly state what the exact nature of his fabricated evidence claim\nis.  He has claimed that it is most closely analogous to a malicious prosecution claim, but has\nrefused to state what constitutional amendment it arises under.  Upon remand, Plaintiff filed an\namended complaint.  See Dkt. No. 185.  In his first cause of action, Plaintiff claims that\nDefendants deprived him of his rights under the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments\nwhen they deprived him of his liberty \"as a result of fabrication of evidence.\"  Id. at ยถยถ 1019-22. \nIn his second cause of action, Plaintiff claims that he was \"maliciously prosecuted without\nprobable cause\" in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.  See id. at ยถยถ\n1023-26.  Plaintiff is clearly still struggling to determine which constitutional amendment his\nfabricated evidence claim arises under, so he just cites to every possible candidate.  Given\n29\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 30 of 60\nPlaintiff's own confusion regarding the nature of his fabricated evidence claim, it would have\nbeen reasonable for Defendant to previously fail to raise all possible defenses.  See Brown, 862\nF.3d at 187 (noting that the district courts have discretion in determining whether an argument or\ndefense has been waived).  However, Defendant previously raised this defense, asserted it in his\nanswer to the amended complaint, see Dkt. No. 191 at 5-6, and the Court is free to consider it on\nremand. \nB. Standard of Review\nA court may grant a motion for summary judgment only if it determines that there is no\ngenuine issue of material fact to be tried and that the facts as to which there is no such issue\nwarrant judgment for the movant as a matter of law.  See Chambers v. TRM Copy Ctrs. Corp., 43\nF.3d 29, 36 (2d Cir. 1994) (citations omitted).  When analyzing a summary judgment motion, the\ncourt \"'cannot try issues of fact; it can only determine whether there are issues to be tried.'\"  Id. at\n36-37 (quotation and other citation omitted).  Substantive law determines which facts are\nmaterial; that is, which facts might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.  See\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 258 (1986).  In assessing the record to determine\nwhether any such issues of material fact exist, the court is required to resolve all ambiguities and\ndraw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.  See Chambers, 43 F.3d at 36\n(citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255) (other citations omitted).  Irrelevant or unnecessary facts do\nnot preclude summary judgment, even when they are in dispute.  See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 258. \nThe moving party bears the initial burden of establishing that there is no genuine issue of\nmaterial fact to be decided.  See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  With respect\nto any issue on which the moving party does not bear the burden of proof, it may meet its burden\non summary judgment by showing that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving\n30\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 31 of 60\nparty's case.  See id. at 325.  Once the movant meets this initial burden, the nonmoving party must\ndemonstrate that there is a genuine unresolved issue for trial.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).  A\ngenuine issue of material fact exists if \"the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a\nverdict for the nonmoving party.\"  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).\nC. Duplicative Claims\nIn his motion, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's due process fabricated evidence claim is\n\"coextensive with, and based upon the same underlying conduct giving rise to [P]laintiff's\nmalicious prosecution claim,\" and, therefore, it must be dismissed as duplicative and without\nmerit.  Dkt. No. 223-2 at 44.  The Court disagrees that these claims are duplicative.  Courts in the\nSecond Circuit have long treated malicious prosecution and fair trial claims as separate causes of\naction.  See Garnett v. Undercover Officer C0039, 838 F.3d 265, 278 (2d Cir. 2016) (noting that\n\"fair trial claims cover kinds of police misconduct not addressed by false arrest or malicious\nprosecution claims\"); McCaffrey v. City of New York, No. 11-CV-1636, 2013 WL 494025, *12\n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 7, 2013) (treating the plaintiff's malicious prosecution and fair trial claims as\nseparate constitutional torts); Brandon v. City of New York, 705 F. Supp. 2d 261, 276 (S.D.N.Y.\n2010) (noting that the Second Circuit has permitted \"claims for both malicious prosecution and a\ndenial of his right to trial based on the same alleged fabrication of evidence\") (citation omitted). \nMoreover, there are several important distinctions between fair trial and malicious prosecution\nclaims.  For example, \"[t]he existence of probable cause is a defense to a claim of malicious\nprosecution\" but not to a fair trial claim.  Bailey v. City of New York, 79 F. Supp. 3d 424, 449-50\n(E.D.N.Y. 2015) (citing Savino v. City of New York, 331 F.3d 63, 72 (2d Cir. 2003)).  Similarly, a\nmalicious prosecution claim generally requires a \"seizure\" cognizable under the Fourth\nAmendment.  See Lanning v. City of Glens Falls, 908 F.3d 19, 28 (2d Cir. 2018), abrogated on\n31\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 32 of 60\nother grounds by Thompson v. Clark, ___ U.S. ___, 142 S. Ct. 1332 (2022) (\"A ยง 1983 claim for\nmalicious prosecution essentially alleges a violation of the plaintiff's right under the Fourth\nAmendment to be free from unreasonable seizure\"); Washington v. County of Rockland, 373 F.3d\n310, 316 (2d Cir. 2004) (explaining that a malicious prosecution claim requires \"a seizure or other\nperversion of proper legal procedures implicating [his] personal liberty and privacy interests\nunder the Fourth Amendment\") (quotation marks omitted).  By contrast, a violation of the right to\nfair trial claim requires a \"a deprivation of life, liberty, or property\" under the Fourteenth\nAmendment.  Ganek v. Leibowitz, 874 F.3d 73, 90 (2d Cir. 2017).  The claims are composed of\ndistinct elements and therefore reflect distinct constitutional claims.  See Bailey, 79 F. Supp. 3d at\n447 (explaining that even where \"malicious prosecution and fair trial claims would rise or fall\ntogether,\" they \"remain distinct constitutional claims\") (citation omitted).  \nAccordingly, the Court declines to dismiss Plaintiff's due process claim as duplicative of\nhis malicious prosecution claims.  \nD. Prosecutorial Immunity\n\"The doctrine of absolute immunity applies broadly to shield a prosecutor from liability\nfor money damages (but not injunctive relief) in a ยง 1983 lawsuit, even when the result may be\nthat a wronged plaintiff is left without an immediate remedy.\" Anilao v. Spota, 27 F.4th 855, 863-\n64 (2d Cir. 2022) (citing Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 427, 96 S. Ct. 984, 47 L. Ed. 2d 128\n(1976)).  The Second Circuit has made clear that \"prosecutors enjoy 'absolute immunity from ยง\n1983 liability for those prosecutorial activities intimately associated with the judicial phase of the\ncriminal process.'\" Id. at 864 (quoting Barr v. Abrams, 810 F.2d 358, 361 (2d Cir. 1987)).  \"The\nimmunity covers 'virtually all acts, regardless of motivation, associated with [the prosecutor's]\nfunction as an advocate.'\" Id. (quotation and other citation omitted).  \"For example, a prosecutor\n32\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 33 of 60\nenjoys absolute immunity when determining which offenses to charge, initiating a prosecution,\npresenting a case to a grand jury, and preparing for trial.\" Id. (citations omitted); see also Imbler,\n424 U.S. at 431 (concluding that a prosecutor is absolutely immune from a ยง 1983 suit for\ndamages based on his \"initiating a prosecution and ... presenting the State's case\").  For that\nreason, the Second Circuit has held that \"absolute immunity extends even to a prosecutor who\n'conspir[es] to present false evidence at a criminal trial.  The fact that such a conspiracy is\ncertainly not something that is properly within the role of a prosecutor is immaterial, because the\nimmunity attaches to his function, not to the manner in which he performed it.'\" Anilao, 27 F.4th\nat 864 (quotation omitted).\n\"'Thus, unless a prosecutor proceeds in the clear absence of all jurisdiction, absolute\nimmunity [from ยง 1983 liability] exists for those prosecutorial activities intimately associated\nwith the judicial phase of the criminal process.'\" Id. (quotation and emphasis omitted); see also\nShmueli v. City of New York, 424 F.3d 231, 237 (2d Cir. 2005).  \"'Conversely, where a prosecutor\nacts without any colorable claim of authority, he loses the absolute immunity he would otherwise\nenjoy' and is left with only qualified immunity as a potential shield.\" Id. (quotation and other\ncitation omitted).  \"'[A] limitation upon the immunity,' Chief Judge Hand explained, '[is] that the\nofficial's act must have been within the scope of his powers,' but this does not mean that 'to\nexercise a power dishonestly is necessarily to overstep its bounds.'\" Id. (quoting Gregoire v.\nBiddle, 177 F.2d 579, 581 (2d Cir. 1949)). \n\"A narrow limitation to the scope of absolute immunity in ยง 1983 actions thus exists\nwhere the defect is jurisdictional โ that is, where the prosecutor acted well outside the scope of\nauthority, rather than where the defect relates, as here, to the prosecutor's motivation or the\nreasonableness of his official action.\" Anilao, 27 F.4th at 864.  \"The jurisdictional defect must be\n33\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 34 of 60\nclear and obvious.\" Id.  \"'In considering whether a given prosecution was clearly beyond the\nscope of that jurisdiction, or whether instead there was at least a colorable claim of authority, ...\nwe inquire whether' any relevant criminal statute exists that 'may have authorized prosecution for\nthe charged conduct.'\" Id. at 864-65 (quotation and other citation omitted).  \n\"So '[e]ven if a prosecutor may lose his absolute immunity for prosecutorial acts for which\nhe has no colorable claim of authority,' it is not lost 'immediately upon crossing the technical\nbounds of the power conferred on him by local law,' or 'simply because he acted in excess of his\nauthority.'\" Anilao, 27 F.4th at 865 (quotation omitted); see also Ashelman v. Pope, 793 F.2d\n1072, 1076-77 (9th Cir. 1986) (en banc) (unanimously holding that a prosecutor was entitled to\nabsolute immunity after overruling a prior Ninth Circuit holding that a prosecutor who \"'files\ncharges he or she knows to be baseless ... is acting outside the scope of his or her authority and\nthus lacks immunity'\") (quotation omitted).  \"Instead, 'absolute immunity must be denied' only\nwhere there is both the absence of all authority (because, for example, no statute authorizes the\nprosecutor's conduct) and the absence of any doubt that the challenged action falls well outside\nthe scope of prosecutorial authority.\" Anilao, 27 F.4th at 865 (quoting Bernard v. County of\nSuffolk, 356 F.3d 495, 504 (2d Cir. 2004)).  In the vast majority of cases \"the laws do authorize\nprosecution for the charged crimes,\" Bernard, 356 F.3d at 504, and if the charging decision or\nother act is within the prosecutor's jurisdiction as a judicial officer, then absolute immunity\nattaches to their actions \"regardless of any allegations\" that their \"actions were undertaken with\nan improper state of mind or improper motive,\" Shmueli, 424 F.3d at 237.  \"Prosecutors thus have\nabsolute immunity in a ยง 1983 action even if it turns out that 'state law did not empower [them] to\nbring the charges,' so long as 'they have at least a semblance of jurisdiction' that does not run far\nafield of their job description.\" Anilao, 27 F.4th at 865 (quotation omitted); see also Barr, 810\n34\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 35 of 60\nF.2d at 361 (declining to adopt \"a holding that a prosecutor is without absolute immunity the\nmoment he strays beyond his jurisdictional limits,\" because doing so would \"do violence to [the]\nspirit\" of the doctrine).\nIn Bernard, the Second Circuit considered whether county prosecutors were entitled to\nabsolute immunity for their politically motivated investigation and prosecution of the plaintiffs\nwithout probable cause.  See Bernard, 356 F.3d at 497-98.  The plaintiffs alleged that the\nprosecutors had sought indictments without probable cause and \"knowingly present[ed] false\nevidence to, while at the same time withholding exculpatory evidence from, the various grand\njuries that returned the[ ] flawed indictments.\" Id. at 503.  The Second Circuit held, that even in\nthe absence of probable cause, \"as long as a prosecutor acts with colorable authority, absolute\nimmunity shields his performance of advocative functions regardless of motivation.\" Id. at 498,\n505; see also id. at 503 (collecting cases in which prosecutors were absolutely immune for\ninitiating prosecutions without probable cause and/or presenting false evidence to a grand jury). \nIn doing so, the Second Circuit reaffirmed the principle that \"[w]here, as in this case, a\nprosecutor's charging decisions are not accompanied by any ... unauthorized demands,\" such as\nfor a bribe or sexual favors, \"the fact that improper motives may influence his authorized\ndiscretion cannot deprive him of absolute immunity.\" Id. at 504; see also Dorman v. Higgins, 821\nF.2d 133, 139 (2d Cir. 1987) (holding that \"absolute immunity spares the official any scrutiny of\nhis motives\" so that allegations of \"bad faith or ... malice [cannot] defeat[ ] a claim of absolute\nimmunity\").\nIn Shmueli, decided a year after Bernard, the Second Circuit held that absolute immunity\napplied to protect local prosecutors who engaged in conduct that, if it occurred, was nothing short\nof outrageous.  The plaintiff alleged that two New York County Assistant District Attorneys\n35\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 36 of 60\nmaliciously prosecuted her for aggravated harassment of her former domestic partner \"despite\nknowing that the charges against her were false and that [she] was innocent\" of those charges. \nShmueli, 424 F.3d at 233.  The plaintiff also alleged that the prosecutors made several threatening\nphone calls to her home during the prosecution.  See id. at 233-34.  The district court rejected the\nprosecutors' defense of absolute immunity because they acted \"without clear jurisdiction and\nwithout any colorable claim of authority.\" Id. at 235.  The Second Circuit reversed, holding that\nthe district court had improperly \"equat[ed] an allegedly improper prosecutorial state of mind\nwith a lack of prosecutorial jurisdiction.\" Id.  Absolute immunity shielded the prosecutors'\nconduct because the indictment contained allegations that, even if completely false, could\nauthorize the prosecutors to prosecute the plaintiff under the New York Penal Law prohibiting\naggravated harassment in the second degree.  See id. at 238-39.  The prosecutors' \"jurisdiction ...\nto prosecute ... depended on the authority conferred by the New York statutes\" โ no more, no\nless.  Id. at 238.\nThe Second Circuit has even extended absolute immunity to prosecutorial misconduct that was\narguably more reprehensible than the conduct alleged in Shmueli.  See, e.g., Pinaud v. County of\nSuffolk, 52 F.3d 1139, 1148 (2d Cir. 1995) (granting absolute immunity to prosecutors who\nimproperly sought to increase the plaintiff's bail; made false representations to prompt a plea\nagreement which they later breached; manufactured a bail jumping charge; lied to the Bureau of\nPrisons; and unnecessarily transferred the plaintiff from county to state jail); Dory, 25 F.3d at 83\n(granting absolute immunity to a prosecutor who allegedly participated in a conspiracy to present\nfalse evidence at trial).\nHowever, absolute immunity does not thwart every claim against prosecutors.  Under the\nfunctional test, \"absolute immunity may not apply when a prosecutor is not acting as 'an officer of\n36\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 37 of 60\nthe court,' but is instead engaged in other tasks, say, investigative or administrative tasks.\" Van de\nKamp v. Goldstein, 555 U.S. 335, 342 (2009) (quoting Imbler, 424 U.S. at 431 n.33). \nInvestigative tasks beyond the scope of absolute immunity are those \"normally performed by a\ndetective or police officer.\" Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U.S. 259, 273 (1993); see also Kanciper\nv. Lato, 989 F. Supp. 2d 216, 228-29 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (\"Investigation, arrest, and detention have\nhistorically and by precedent been regarded as the work of police, not prosecutors, and 'they do\nnot become prosecutorial functions merely because a prosecutor has chosen to participate'\")\n(quoting Day v. Morgenthau, 909 F.2d 75, 77-78 (2d Cir. 1990)).  Where absolute immunity does\nnot apply, a prosecutor is eligible only for qualified immunity.  See Smith v. Garretto, 147 F.3d\n91, 94 (2d Cir. 1998) (citing Buckley, 509 U.S. at 273).\nProsecutors generally only have qualified immunity for actions taken before there is\nprobable cause to arrest a defendant, because they are performing an investigative function, rather\nthan acting as advocates.  See Hill, 45 F.3d at 661; Buckley, 509 U.S. at 273.  And, although\n\"knowingly presenting evidence\" to a grand jury is considered the \"core of a prosecutor's role as\nan advocate,\" Bernard, 356 F.3d at 503, the Second Circuit has distinguished between a\nprosecutor's knowing presentation of false evidence to the grand jury โ which is still entitled to\nabsolute immunity โ from a prosecutor's deliberate fabrication of evidence, Hill, 45 F.3d at 662-\n63 (finding that where a prosecutor deliberately manufactured evidence to establish probable\ncause for the plaintiff's arrest, his conduct was investigatory, regardless of whether, when the\nevidence was manufactured, the prosecutor intended to present it to the grand jury).\nIn the present matter, the Court finds that the undisputed facts establish that, at nearly all\nrelevant times, Defendant was acting in his capacity as an advocate and is entitled to absolute\nprosecutorial immunity.  For example, on March 12, 2010, Defendant met with McGrath and his\n37\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 38 of 60\nattorney in Defendant's office for a proffer, which was followed by the execution of a\nCooperation Agreement.  See Dkt. No. 223-1 at ยถยถ 55-57.  This Cooperation Agreement provided\ngenerally that, in exchange for McGrath's truthful testimony and continued cooperation, he would\nreceive immunity from prosecution and that his failure to cooperate in the presentation of the case\nor to testify would be a breach of the agreement, which would permit Defendant to void the\nagreement and subsequently prosecute McGrath.  See id. at ยถ 58.  After McGrath provided his\nMarch 29, 2010 statement, he did not meet with Defendant again other than to prepare for his\ngrand jury and trial testimony.  See id. at ยถ 70.  Defendant taking a proffer from a witness,\nentering into a Cooperation Agreement to ensure that witness' testimony before the grand jury\nand/or at trial, and preparing a witness for his testimony before the grand jury is clearly conduct\n\"undertaken by a prosecutor in preparing for the initiation of judicial proceedings\" and is\nprotected by absolute prosecutorial immunity.  Buckley, 509 U.S. at 273.  \nIn his response to Defendant's motion, Plaintiff argues that \"the false statements of\nwitnesses Kevin McGrath, Kevin O'Malley and Inv. Ogden were fabricated to affirmatively\nincriminate the plaintiff and initiate plaintiff's prosecution.  Thereafter, defendant fabricated the\nfalse opinions of [the] private Forensic Document Examiner9 to supplant the prior fabricated false\n9 In July 2011, Defendant hired Alan T. Robillard, a private forensic document examiner,\nto compare handwriting exemplars provided by Plaintiff with the handwriting on the absentee\nballot applications that Plaintiff was suspected of forging.  See Dkt. No. 185 at ยถยถ 707-25.  Mr.\nRobillard was previously employed as a supervisor in the FBI's crime laboratory.  See id. at ยถ 712. \nIn his December 1, 2011 handwriting comparison report, Mr. Robillard stated that his opinion\nwas that Plaintiff wrote the false absentee ballot agents and excuses on the absentee ballot\napplications in question.  See id. at ยถ 722.  According to the amended complaint, Mr. Robillard\n\"testified that his handwriting opinions were 'overwhelming evidence'\" that Plaintiff wrote the\nfalse absentee ballot agent names and excuses on all of the absentee ballot applications in\nquestion.  See id. at ยถ 973.  In an entirely conclusory manner and without citing to any evidence in\nthe record to support his assertion, Plaintiff claims that Mr. Robillard's forensic handwriting\n(continued...)\n38\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 39 of 60\ngrand jury opinion testimony of Inv. Ogden and provide additional false opinion evidence\nconcerning indentations and ink findings.\" Dkt. No. 237-3 at 10.  Plaintiff continues by alleging\nthat Defendant subsequently \"fabricated the false statements of McInerney, Brown, and Renna to\ndirectly incriminate the plaintiff at trial and/or not disclose the truth that would have exonerated\nhim to be as consistent as possible with the previously fabricated false testimony of others and\nsupported the purported prosecution theory.  The false testimony of McInerney, Brown, and\nRenna was based on written statement taken during investigative gathering of evidence and\npresented to continue the prosecution.  The witnesses testified consistently at grand jury and/or\ntrial with such false evidence fabricated by the prosecutor.\" Id. at 10-11.  \nPlaintiff's argument is problematic for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the\nfact that Plaintiff has failed to present anything other than conclusory allegations that Defendant\nfabricated this evidence, supported by only his own conjecture.  For example, as to Kevin\nO'Malley, the undisputed facts make clear that he first testified before the grand jury on\nDecember 9, 2010.  See Dkt. No. 223-1 at ยถ 92.  During his initial testimony, Defendant believed\nO'Malley was being evasive when answering questions.  See id. at ยถ 94.  As such, on December\n13, 2010, Defendant emailed Investigators Ogden and Fancher directing them to contact O'Malley\n9(...continued)\nreport and testimony at trial were entirely fabricated and takes issue with the fact that Mr.\nRobillard did not perform an \"ink analysis\" on fourteen absentee ballot applications identified by\nPlaintiff, which Plaintiff claims would have exonerated him.  See id. at ยถยถ 973-81.  Plaintiff, of\ncourse, was free to hire his own forensic document examiner to perform such an analysis had he\nthought such an analysis would have been helpful in his defense.  Moreover, the decision to retain\nan expert witness for use at trial, after Plaintiff had already been indicted, is clearly intimately\nassociated with the judicial process for which Defendant is entitled to absolute prosecutorial\nimmunity.  See Van de Kamp v. Goldstein, 555 U.S. 335, 343-44 (2009); see also Bryson v. Macy,\n611 F. Supp. 2d 1234, 1263 (W.D. Okla. 2009) (holding that a prosecutor's the decision to use an\nexpert witness and forensic evidence at trial is entitled to prosecutorial immunity).   \n39\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 40 of 60\nto let him know that he wanted to discuss the possibility of O'Malley testifying a second time\nbefore the grand jury.  See Dkt. No. 239-27 at 1.  In that email, Defendant asked the investigators\nto inform O'Malley that \"under the law a witness who has perjured himself before the grand jury\ncan 'cure' the perjury if he promptly corrects it before the same grand jury and that this is the topic\nI wish to discuss with him.\" Id.  Additionally, Defendant reiterated what was known about\nO'Malley's involvement in the alleged absentee ballot fraud and concluded that O'Malley \"has\nimmunity for everything but perjury.\" Id.  During his return appearance before the grand jury on\nDecember 15, 2010, after retaining counsel, O'Malley was more forthcoming and implicated\nhimself and Plaintiff in the alleged criminal conduct.  O'Malley repeated this testimony at\nPlaintiff's two subsequent criminal trials and at his November 18, 2020 deposition.  See Dkt. No.\n223-1 at ยถ 102.  O'Malley further testified that he was never pressured to give testimony\nincriminating Plaintiff, other than his attorney instructing him to tell the truth when he returned to\ntestify before the grand jury.  See id. at ยถ 103.  Contrary to Plaintiff's claims, such conduct is not\noutside the scope of prosecutorial immunity.  Even assuming you could consider Defendant's\nconduct \"coercive\" by indicating that he believed O'Malley had perjured himself, the Second\nCircuit has made clear that \"the coercion of witnesses\" is a prosecutorial activity for which\nabsolute immunity applies.  See Taylor v. Kavanagh, 640 F.2d 450, 452 (2d Cir. 1981) (citation\nomitted).  Moreover, even assuming that O'Malley (and all of these other individuals) lied before\nthe grand jury and at trial as Plaintiff claims, \"the solicitation and subornation of perjured\ntestimony\" is similarly protected by absolute immunity.  See id. (citation omitted).  \nIn his statement of additional material facts in dispute, Plaintiff discusses a meeting that\noccurred on January 27, 2010, where Plaintiff met with Investigator Ogden and Defendant at the\nBrunswick State Police Barracks.  See Dkt. No. 237-2 at ยถยถ 68-73.  Plaintiff claims that, in his\n40\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 41 of 60\naffirmation in opposition to his disqualification and dismissal of the criminal case, Defendant\nswore that Investigator Ogden asked him to meet with Plaintiff because they thought he was not\nbeing truthful to protect McInerney and \"[t]he whole purpose of the meeting was for Inv. Ogden\nto observe his demeanor.\" Dkt. No. 237-2 at ยถ 68 (citing Dkt. No. 239-13 at 12-16).  Plaintiff\nnotes that Defendant \"also affirmed that he agreed to meet with plaintiff because 'it did not occur\nto [his investigative unit that plaintiff] was actually involved in [ ] falsification of [absentee ballot\napplications]' and he played a 'bad cop' role to pressure him into providing information about\nMcInerney while doing a 'human polygraph' because they considered him to be a cooperating\nwitness and they had no reason to suspect he was involved in ... any criminal activity.\" Id. at ยถ 69. \nAt his deposition, however, Plaintiff notes that Investigator Ogden testified that Plaintiff was\ndefinitely a suspect at that time, that he did not ask Defendant to meet with Plaintiff, and that the\npurpose of the meeting was not for him to observe Plaintiff's demeanor but for Defendant to\n\"'press him.'\" Id. at ยถ 72 (quoting Dkt. No. 224-2 at 136).  \nAlthough it is true that Defendant's recollection of the January 27, 2010 meeting and the\nmanner in which it was brought about differs from that of Investigator Ogden, the Court fails to\nsee the relevance.  Plaintiff fails to allege that any fabricated evidence was created at this meeting\nor that it was in any way used before the grand jury or in his criminal trials.  \nThe Court also notes that, throughout his response, Plaintiff repeatedly discusses the fact\nthat others were treated more favorably than he was, despite the fact that there was substantial and\ndirect evidence indicating that they were significantly more involved in the alleged voter fraud. \nPlaintiff implies that this occurred because either Defendant was seeking revenge for a decades-\nold slight by Plaintiff's father, or because Defendant was seeking to protect these other individuals\nfor personal reasons.  See Bernard, 356 F.3d at 504 (holding that prosecutorial immunity still\n41\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 42 of 60\napplies despite \"the fact that improper motives may influence his authorized discretion\");\nDorman, 821 F.2d at 139 (holding that \"absolute immunity spares the official any scrutiny of his\nmotives\" so that allegations of \"bad faith or ... malice [cannot] defeat[ ] a claim of absolute\nimmunity\").  Since nothing in the record supports the inference that Defendant was acting beyond\nthe scope of his jurisdiction, any allegations concerning his motives or alleged malice are not\nrelevant to the issue of absolute prosecutorial immunity.10  \nIn response to the motion and at oral argument, Plaintiff repeatedly discusses a press\nrelease that Defendant issued on the day Plaintiff was arraigned on the indictment as proof that\nDefendant continually acted in an investigatory capacity.  See Dkt. No. 238 at 8; see also Tr. at\n30.  For example, Plaintiff notes that the press release specifically states that the \"scope of\n[Defendant's] powers as set forth in the order of appointment is limited to the investigation and\nprosecution of crimes related to the September 15th primary.\" Id.  The press release certainly\nstates that, under the order appointing Defendant as special prosecutor, he was authorized to\ninvestigate and prosecute the underlying criminal matter.  As discussed in great detail below,\nhowever, the simple fact that Defendant may have engaged in some investigative activities is\ninsufficient, by itself, to support his fabricated evidence claim.  Rather, Plaintiff is required to\n10 Although Plaintiff claims that he was treated less favorably than others who received\nfavorable plea deals, evidence in the record shows that, prior to presenting the case to the grand\njury, Defendant and Plaintiff's counsel spoke on several occasions to discuss a possible plea deal\nfor Plaintiff.  See Dkt. No. 239-13 at ยถยถ 57-62.  Plaintiff's counsel was seeking total immunity for\nPlaintiff in exchange for Plaintiff's cooperation against Mr. McInerney.  See id.  When asked to\nspecify his client's evidence against Mr. McInerney, Defendant claims that Plaintiff's counsel\n\"was vague\" and indicated that Plaintiff \"probably did not have any evidence of great value.\"\nId. at ยถ 59.  Based on this representation, the parties were unable to come to an agreement on a\nplea deal/immunity for Plaintiff.     \n42\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 43 of 60\nprovide evidence that, while Defendant was acting in an investigative capacity, he actually\nfabricated evidence.     \nContrary to Plaintiff's assertions, the Court finds that Defendant is entitled to absolute\nprosecutorial immunity for all of the alleged actions taken in his role as an advocate.  As\ndiscussed below, however, even assuming that absolute prosecutorial immunity did not apply, all\nremaining claims are nevertheless still subject to dismissal.   \nE. Due Process Right to a Fair Trial\nPlaintiff claims that Defendant violated his \"right not to be deprived of his liberty, liberty\ninterests or a fair trial as a result of the fabrication of false evidence by a government officer\nacting in an investigatory capacity\" as protected by the \"Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and/or Fourteenth\nAmendments to the Constitution of the United States.\" Dkt. No. 185 at ยถยถ 1019-22.  Initially, the\nCourt finds that it is unnecessary to determine the precise constitutional amendment underpinning\nPlaintiff's due process right to a fair trial claim.  The Second Circuit has noted that its own\ndecisions have been \"'inconsistent as to whether' fabrication of evidence claims 'arise[ ] under the\nSixth Amendment right to a fair and speedy trial, or under the due process clauses of the Fifth and\nFourteenth Amendments.'\" Morse v. Fusto, 804 F.3d 538, 547 n.7 (2d Cir. 2015) (quotation and\nother citations omitted).  Despite these inconsistencies, the Second Circuit has not clarified the\nissue, noting that regardless of which amendment the right is rooted, it is undisputed that the\n\"constitutional harm resulting from the falsified information at issue is ... redressable in an action\nfor damages under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.\" Garnett v. Undercover Officer C0039, 838 F.3d 265, 276\nn.6 (2d Cir. 2016) (citing Morse v. Fusto, 804 F.3d 538, 547 n.7 (2d Cir. 2015)).  In line with this\nauthority, the Court declines to determine whether the right to a fair trial is rooted in the Sixth\n43\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 44 of 60\nAmendment right to a fair and speedy trial or the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth\nAmendments, and will instead simply address the merits of Plaintiff's claim.\n\"The Due Process Clause guarantees a criminal defendant's 'right to a fair trial.'\" Frost v.\nN.Y.C. Police Dep't, 980 F.3d 231, 244 (2d Cir. 2020) (quoting Ramchair v. Conway, 601 F.3d\n66, 73 (2d Cir. 2010)).  \"This right is violated '[w]hen a police officer creates false information\nlikely to influence a jury's decision and forwards that information to prosecutors.'\" Id. (quoting\nRicciuti v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., 124 F.3d 123, 130 (2d Cir. 1997)).  \"Such violations are\n'redressable in an action for damages under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.'\" Id. (quotation omitted).  \"And\nunlike a malicious prosecution claim, 'a Section 1983 claim for the denial of a right to a fair trial\nbased on an officer's provision of false information to prosecutors can stand even if the officer\nhad probable cause to arrest the Section 1983 plaintiff.'\" Id. (quoting Garnett v. Undercover\nOfficer C0039, 838 F.3d 265, 277-78 (2d Cir. 2016)).\nTo set forth a claim of the denial of the right to a fair trial, the plaintiff must establish that\nan \"(1) investigating official (2) fabricates evidence (3) that is likely to influence a jury's decision,\n(4) forwards that information to prosecutors, and (5) the plaintiff suffers a deprivation of liberty\nas a result.\" Jovanovic v. City of New York, 486 Fed. Appx. 149, 152 (2d Cir. 2012) (citing Jochs\nv. Tavernier, 316 F.3d 128, 138 (2d Cir. 2003)) (other citation omitted).  The inquiry as to\ncausation is \"whether the liberty deprivations that occurred are legally traceable back ... to [the]\nearlier investigatory act of fabrication.\" Zahrey v. Coffey, 221 F.3d 342, 352 (2d Cir. 2000).  In a\nrecent decision, however, the Second Circuit made clear that the right to a fair trial can be\nviolated even if the fabricated evidence that was supplied to the prosecutor was not ultimately\nused at trial, so long as the fabricated evidence was a proximate cause of his deprivation of\nliberty.  See Frost, 980 F.3d at 250.  In other words, the claim only accrues \"when fabricated\n44\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 45 of 60\ninformation is forwarded to a prosecutor and results in the deprivation of a defendant's liberty.\"\nSoomro v. City of New York, 174 F. Supp. 3d 806, 815 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (citation omitted).\nAdditionally, the Second Circuit has made clear that, despite the nomenclature, \"a\ncriminal defendant's right to a fair trial protects more than the fairness of the trial itself.\"  Frost,\n980 F.3d at 249.  Rather, a fair trial claim can proceed when an investigating official knowingly\nfabricates evidence and forwards it to the prosecutor, which ultimately causes a deprivation of\nliberty, even if the charges are subsequently dismissed.  See id. (citing Ricciuti, 124 F.3d at 129-\n30).  \nIn the present matter, the Court finds that Defendant's motion for summary judgment must\nbe granted with respect to all remaining claims on the merits.  Notably absent from the record in\nthis case is any evidence indicating that Defendant fabricated evidence in any manner.  In his\nstatement of material facts, Defendant repeatedly cites to evidence (including statements from\ncooperating witnesses) that implicated Plaintiff in the alleged voter fraud.  See, e.g., Dkt. No. 223-\n1 at ยถยถ 61-68.  Plaintiff does not deny that these witnesses made statements implicating him in the\nalleged voter fraud.  See Dkt. No. 237 at ยถยถ 61-68.  Rather, Plaintiff simply denies that he actually\nengaged in the conduct alleged.  See id.  Similarly, aside from his own conclusory allegations,\nPlaintiff fails to point to any evidence in the record suggesting that these incriminating statements\nwere obtained through improper means or fabricated by Defendant.  \nFor example, on March 12, 2010, at a meeting with Kevin McGrath, his attorney Peter\nMoschetti, Defendant, Investigators Ogden and Fancher, McGrath entered into a Cooperation\nAgreement.  See Dkt. No. 223-1 at ยถยถ 55-71.  Upon executing the Cooperation Agreement, \"a\nmore detailed discussion of McGrath's potential testimony was then conducted.\" Id. at ยถ 59. \nSubsequently, Investigator Fancher drafted a proposed typewritten statement, which McGrath\n45\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 46 of 60\nexecuted on March 29, 2010.  See id. at ยถ 60.  \"According to McGrath's sworn statement, on\nAugust 24, 2009, he observed McDonough falsely complete the excuse fields on the absentee\nballot applications of Thomas Dickinson and Jennifer Taylor.\" Id. at ยถ 61.  McGrath's statement\nfurther indicated that on September 14, 2009, the day before the WFP primary, he was in\nPlaintiff's office at the Board of Elections when Plaintiff and John Brown discussed the need to\nenter names in the blank \"release to\" fields on numerous absentee ballot applications.  See id. at ยถ\n62.  McGrath stated that Jim Welch, the local chair of the WFP, was suggested as a possible\ncandidate and Brown proceeded to call Welch on his cell phone.  See id. at ยถ 63.  McGrath heard\nBrown ask Welch if he could use his name in the \"release to\" field on numerous applications for\nabsentee ballots.  See id. at ยถ 64.  After the call ended, Brown told Plaintiff that Welch had\nconsented.  See id. at ยถ 65.  At this point, Plaintiff told McGrath and Brown to leave the office\n\"because they were candidates.\" Id. at ยถ 66.  McGrath stated that he assumed that Plaintiff meant\nthat he did not want them to witness him entering Welch's name in the \"release to\" fields on the\napplications.  See id. at ยถ 67. \nAt his deposition, McGrath testified that his March 29, 2010 typewritten statement\nrepresents what he told Defendant and the two New York State Police Investigators on March 12,\n2010, and that there is nothing that he would change or add to his statement.  See id. at ยถ 69. \nMcGrath further testified that, after his meeting with Defendant and the investigators on March\n12, 2010, and when he executed his statement on March 29, 2010, he did not recall meeting with\nDefendant at any other times other than to prepare for his grand jury and trial testimony.  See id.\nat ยถ 70 (citing Dkt. No. 223-7 at 68-70).  Moreover, McGrath testified that Defendant never asked\nhim to \"provide information against Ed McDonough\" nor did Defendant state \"that it was his\n46\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 47 of 60\nbelief that McDonough had falsified documents with respect to the election[.]\" Id. at ยถ 71 (citing\nDkt. No. 223-7 at 138-40).\nIn response to these allegations, Plaintiff denies that he \"knowingly wrote false excuses\"\non absentee ballot applications and generally denies that the alleged discussions that McGrath\nrecounted took place.  See Dkt. No. 237 at ยถยถ 60-68.  In support of these denials, he cites to his\naffidavit in support of his motion to disqualify Defendant as the Special District Attorney in the\nunderlying criminal matter, in which he denies that these events ever occurred.  See Dkt. No. 237\nat ยถยถ 61-67 (citing Dkt. No. 239-6 at 5).  Plaintiff does not deny that McGrath made these\nstatements and signed a written statement summarizing his recollection of what occurred on these\ndates.  As to McGrath's subsequent deposition testimony, Plaintiff admits that McGrath testified\nthat there was nothing that he would add or change about the March 29, 2010 statement.  See\nid. at ยถ 69.  As to McGrath's testimony that, aside from the March 12 and 29, 2010 meetings, he\ndid not meet with Defendant at any other point other than to prepare for his grand jury and trial\ntestimony, Plaintiff simply objects to the testimony \"as self-serving hearsay, bolstering of\ntestimony, and conclusion regarding a question of witness credibility, law and/or fact for the\nCourt or a trial jury, rather than a proper assertion of material fact.\" Id. at ยถ 70.  Contrary to\nPlaintiff's assertions, however, this testimony is directly relevant to determining whether any\nevidence supports his claims that Defendant improperly coerced witnesses into testifying falsely\nagainst him in his underlying criminal trials or before the grand jury.  \nSimilarly, Kevin O'Malley, who was employed by the Rensselaer County Board of\nElection as Custodian of Records in September of 2009, testified before the grand jury on\nDecember 9 and 15, 2010.  See Dkt. No. 223-1 at ยถยถ 92-93.  During his initial grand jury\ntestimony, Defendant believed that O'Malley was being evasive when answering questions\n47\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 48 of 60\nregarding his activities with Plaintiff on September 14, 2009.  See id. at ยถ 94.11  On December 13,\n2010, Defendant emailed Investigators Ogden and Fancher, directing them to contact O'Malley to\nlet him know that he wanted to discuss the possibility of O'Malley testifying a second time before\nthe grand jury.  See Dkt. No. 239-27 at 1.  In that email, Defendant asked the investigators to\ninform O'Malley that \"under the law a witness who has perjured himself before the grand jury can\n'cure' the perjury if he promptly corrects it before the same grand jury and that this is the topic I\nwish to discuss with him.\" Id.  Additionally, Defendant reiterated what was known about\nO'Malley's involvement in the alleged absentee ballot fraud and concluded that O'Malley \"has\nimmunity for everything but perjury.\" Id.\nAt his deposition, O'Malley recounted that Defendant called him before his return to the\ngrand jury, and stated that \"my answers were vague and some were untruthful and that I should\nseek counsel.\" Dkt. No. 223-1 at ยถ 96.  O'Malley then retained Andrew Safranko, Esq. to\nrepresent him.  See id. at ยถ 97.  O'Malley testified at his deposition that he met with Mr. Safranko\nbefore his return to the grand jury, told him that his initial testimony was false, and further\n11 The Court notes that Plaintiff objects to this assertion \"as self-serving hearsay,\nbolstering of testimony, and conclusion regarding a question of witness credibility, law and/or\nfact for the Court or a trial jury, rather than proper assertion of fact.\" Dkt. No. 237 at ยถ 94.  In this\nstatement, Defendant simply asserts that he believed that O'Malley was being evasive in his\nanswers, not that he was, in fact, being evasive.  This fact is properly supported by not only\nDefendant's affidavit, but also his email to Investigator Ogden dated December 13, 2010,\ndiscussing the fact that he believed that O'Malley may have perjured himself during his initial\ngrand jury testimony in two respects: \"1), by saying that he does not remember the precise date of\nthe meeting he attended between McDonough & McInerney at the City Clerk's Office and 2), by\nsaying he does not remember anything that was said during the 10 to 15 minute meeting that took\nplace at that time.  I would like to give Mr. O'Malley the opportunity to come clean.\" Dkt. No.\n239-27 at 1.  This contemporaneous evidence clearly demonstrates that Defendant believed\nO'Malley was evasive, and perhaps perjured himself, during his initial grand jury appearance.    \n48\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 49 of 60\ninformed him what his truthful testimony would be.  See id. at ยถ 98.12  Mr. Safranko told O'Malley\nto tell the truth when he returned to the grand jury.  See id. at ยถ 99.  \nDuring his return appearance before the grand jury on December 15, 2010, O'Malley\nidentified his handwriting or printing in the \"excuse\" fields on the absentee ballot applications of\nDemetrius Banks, Maritza Berrios, Diane Jordan, Michael Rebel, Bridget Ryan, and Jolene\nVanVranken.  See id. at ยถ 100.  O'Malley also testified that his boss, Plaintiff, called him into his\noffice on September 14, 2009, and instructed him to make those false entries.  See id. at ยถ 101.13 \nO'Malley repeated this testimony at Plaintiff's two subsequent criminal trials and at his November\n18, 2020 deposition.  See id. at ยถ 102.  O'Malley further testified that he was never pressured to\ngive testimony incriminating Plaintiff, other than his attorney instructing him to tell the truth\nwhen he returned to testify before the grand jury.  See id. at ยถ 103.\nAgain, Plaintiff does not deny that O'Malley provided testimony that directly implicated\nPlaintiff in the alleged voter fraud.  Rather, Plaintiff relies on his own self-serving affidavit to\ndeny that he engaged in the conduct alleged and otherwise misconstrues the facts.  Plaintiff argues\nthat O'Malley only changed his testimony \"after he was purportedly threatened with prosecution\nfor perjury and as a primary culprit.\" Dkt. No. 237-3 at 30.  However, Defendant's email to\nInvestigators Ogden and Fancher makes clear that it was only his belief that O'Malley had not\nbeen entirely forthcoming in his original grand jury testimony and he was simply to be reminded\n12 Plaintiff has objected to this statement \"as self-serving hearsay, bolstering of testimony,\nand conclusion regarding a question of witness credibility[.]\" Dkt. No. 237 at ยถ 98.  O'Malley's\nown recollection of statements that he made are clearly not hearsay and this statement is\notherwise relevant to the issues presently before the Court.  See Dkt. No. 223-14 at 240-41.  \n13 Again, Plaintiff relies on his own affidavit from the underlying criminal case to deny\nthat he engaged in this conduct but does not deny the fact that O'Malley testified that this\noccurred.  See Dkt. No. 237 at ยถ 101 (citing Dkt. No. 239-6 at 7-8).  \n49\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 50 of 60\nof what was required of him in his Cooperation Agreement.  Nothing about providing O'Malley\nwith a reminder or recalling him before the grand jury was improper.  \nIt is true that in certain circumstances courts have permitted fabrication claims to proceed\nbased on an official's alleged coercion of witnesses.  In those cases, however, the claimed\ncoercion was exceedingly more problematic than the alleged coercion in this case, which amounts\nto nothing more than favorable treatment in exchange for the witnesses' cooperation in the\nongoing investigation.  For example, in Gilliam v. Sealey, 932 F.3d 216 (4th Cir. 2019), the\nFourth Circuit denied the law enforcement officers' motion for summary judgment because of\nevidence that the officers had met with the plaintiffs' sixteen-year-old friend multiple times and\nmade him take a polygraph test in which he declared that he did not know anything about the\ncrime.  See id. at 228.  The officers subsequently \"marked [the friend] as a suspect in the case\"\nand ordered an analysis of his fingerprints.  See id. Only then did the friend change his story and\ntestify at the plaintiffs' trial that one of the plaintiffs had confessed to committing the crime.  See\nid.  The Fourth Circuit found that this, in addition to other evidence of the officers' bad faith,14\nwas sufficient to create a fact issue as to whether the friend's confession was fabricated or\ncoerced.  See id. at 240; see also  White v. Smith, 696 F.3d 740, 757 (8th Cir. 2012) (allowing a\nSection 1983 fabrication claim to proceed when evidence demonstrated \"that Defendants coached\nand manipulated\" witnesses \"into adopting Defendants' theory of the case\" and interview\ntranscripts contained \"a number of inexplicable moments\" where the plaintiff's \"alleged\n14 A witness testified at deposition that she had told officers she had observed a different\nsuspect attack the murder victim on the night of the murder, but the officer's interview notes for\nthis witness did not reflect this testimony.  The officers had also requested that this alternative\nsuspect's fingerprints be tested against prints on a beer can found at the crime scene, but then\nwithdrew this request three days before the defendant's trial.  See Gilliam, 932 F.3d at 228.\n50\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 51 of 60\naccomplices completely changed their stories or suddenly remembered important details about the\ncrime after breaks in the tape recording\").  Here, there are no allegations, or more importantly\nevidence, of such outrageous conduct by Defendant.\nIn his response to Defendant's motion, Plaintiff argues that \"Defendant's motion is\npremised entirely on the self-serving assertions of he [sic] and the others that they did not\nfabricate evidence, but the facts and circumstances permit a reasonable inference that if they are\nnot telling the truth as they assert, then it must be that there is a genuine issue in dispute about\nthat issue because there is no other reasonable explanation for their false assertions and omissions\nof truth that resulted in the initiation and continuation of [P]laintiff's prosecution that could not\nhave otherwise happened.\" Dkt. No. 237-3 at 30-31.  This statement clearly demonstrates just\nhow flawed Plaintiff's position is.  The issue here is not whether all of the individuals who came\nforward to testify against Plaintiff fabricated their testimony.  Rather, the issue is whether\nDefendant knowingly fabricated evidence or knowingly presented fabricated evidence or false\ntestimony against Plaintiff.  The witnesses discussed above have consistently testified against\nPlaintiff in written statements provided to the State Police, in their testimony at two criminal\ntrials, and during their depositions taken in this case.  Moreover, all of the principal witnesses\nagainst Plaintiff in the underlying criminal case have since testified that they were not pressured\nor coerced by Defendant into giving false testimony against Plaintiff.  While Plaintiff may have\nconsistently alleged that all of these witnesses were lying, nothing in the record suggests that\nDefendant knew or should have known that these witnesses consistently fabricated evidence to\nimplicate Plaintiff.  Indeed, not one of the witnesses who testified against Plaintiff during his\ncriminal trials has since recanted his or her testimony or even implied that it was untruthful or\nfabricated.  See Isaac v. City of New York, No. 16-cv-4729, 2020 WL 1694300, *9 (E.D.N.Y.\n51\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 52 of 60\nApr. 6, 2020) (granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment where the \"[p]laintiff\nclaim[ed] that the testimony of four witnesses and [the] defendant ... was false, but offer[ed] no\nevidence in support, other than his own testimony\").   \nIn Halsey v. Pfeiffer, 750 F.3d 273 (3d Cir. 2014), the Third Circuit indicated that there\nare significant hurdles facing a plaintiff alleging a due process violation for fabrication of\nevidence.  For instance, the court cautioned that a civil plaintiff's fabricated evidence claim\nshould not survive summary judgment unless he can demonstrate that the fabricated evidence\n\"was so significant that it could have affected the outcome of the criminal case.\" Halsey, 750 F.3d\nat 295.  In addition, the court held that there is a notable bar for evidence to be considered\n\"fabricated.\"  The Halsey court noted that \"testimony that is incorrect or simply disputed should\nnot be treated as fabricated merely because it turns out to have been wrong.\" Id.  There must be\n\"persuasive evidence supporting a conclusion that the proponents of the evidence\" are aware that\nevidence is incorrect or that the evidence is offered in bad faith.  Id.  For these reasons, the court\nstated that \"we expect that it will be an unusual case in which a police officer cannot obtain a\nsummary judgment in a civil action charging him with having fabricated evidence used in an\nearlier criminal case.\" Id. at 295; see also Black v. Montgomery Cty., 835 F.3d 358, 372 (3d Cir.\n2016).\nPlaintiff does not challenge, in anything but the most conclusory terms, the undisputed\nfact that none of the witnesses against him ever recanted their incriminating testimony and each\nstated under oath that Defendant did not improperly influence or coerce their testimony, or ask\nthem to fabricate evidence.  See Thorpe v. Duve, 2022 WL 332804, *3 (2d Cir. Feb. 4, 2022)\n(\"However, Mashaw has never recanted or claimed that she lied in her interview, before the grand\njury, or at trialโfacts that distinguish this appeal from the cases Thorpe and Durand rely on to\n52\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 53 of 60\nsupport their assertion that Mashaw was coerced into falsely testifying\") (citing Zahrey v. City of\nNew York, No. 98-4546, 2009 WL 54495 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 7, 2009); Blake v. Race, 487 F. Supp. 2d\n187 (E.D.N.Y. 2007)).  Plaintiff relies almost exclusively on his own affidavit in attempting to\nundermine the sworn testimony of the numerous witnesses who consistently testified against him. \nSuch conclusory allegations are insufficient to create an issue of fact.  See Boseman v. Upper\nProvidence Township, 680 Fed. Appx. 65, 70 (3d Cir. 2017) (holding that the district court\ncorrectly determined that the defendant was entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiff's\nfabricated evidence claim where the plaintiff merely denied the conclusions reached by the\ndefendant in his report); Rodriguez v. Derienzo, No. 20-cv-87, 2020 WL 615052, *3 (S.D.N.Y.\nFeb. 7, 2020) (noting that \"[t]estimony that is incorrect or simply disputed should not be treated\nas fabricated merely because it turns out to have been wrong\"). \nEven assuming that O'Malley was \"coerced\" into returning to the grand jury and providing\nadditional testimony as Plaintiff claims, any such \"coercion\" does not necessarily render his\nsubsequent testimony fabricated.  There is clearly a difference between \"coercing witnesses to\ntestify and fabricating witness testimony.\" Petty v. City of Chicago, 754 F.3d 416, 422 (7th Cir.\n2014).  As the Seventh Circuit explained, \"'[c]oerced testimony is testimony that a witness is\nforced by improper means to give; the testimony may be true or false.  Fabricated testimony is\ntestimony that is made up; it is invariably false.  False testimony is the equivalent; it is testimony\nknown to be untrue by the witness and by whoever cajoled or coerced the witness to give it.'\" Id.\n(quoting Fields v. Wharrie, 740 F.3d 1107, 1110 (7th Cir. 2014)).15  \"In fabrication cases, the\npolice or prosecutor manufactures evidence that he knows to be false.\" Id. (citation omitted). \n15 The Second Circuit has cited with approval the Seventh Circuit's decision in Fields.  See\nAnilao v. Spota, 27 F.4th 855, 869-70 (2d Cir. 2022).\n53\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 54 of 60\nHowever, \"a prosecutor fabricating evidence that she knows to be false is different than getting 'a\nreluctant witness to say what may be true.'\" Id. (quotation omitted).  \nIn Petty, the plaintiff alleged that members of the Chicago Police Department coerced a\nwitness named Tarver \"into giving false evidence by threatening him with jail time if he did not\ncooperate, holding him against his will in a locked room without food or water for over 13 hours,\nbadgering him, and pressuring him to identify Petty as one of the assailants.\" Petty, 754 F.3d at\n423.  As a result of these alleged tactics, the plaintiff argued that the defendants \"knew or should\nhave known that Tarver's statements were flawed.\" Id.  The Seventh Circuit found such\nallegations were insufficient to support a due process fabricated evidence claim because nothing\nin the record supported an inference that the defendants fabricated the statements or knowingly\nintroduced false statements against the plaintiff.  See id.  \nHere, aside from his own conclusory allegations, Plaintiff has not pointed to any evidence\nsuggesting that Defendant \"fabricated\" evidence against him.  Rather, he has pointed to one\ninstance where Defendant reminded a witness of his responsibilities under his cooperation\nagreement and arranged for him to return to the grand jury to provide additional testimony. \nWithout more, this is insufficient to support his due process fabricated evidence claim.  See\nColeman v. City of Peoria, Illinois, 925 F.3d 336, 346 (7th Cir. 2019) (holding that the plaintiff\n\"cannot save a claim based on coercive interrogation techniques via speculation that defendants\nwere knowingly fabricating evidence\"); see also Fields, 740 F.3d at 1110 (holding that coerced\ntestimony is not necessarily fabricated.  A reluctant witness or co-conspirator whose testimony an\nofficer must pry out through aggressive interrogation techniques may be telling the truth despite\nthe measures used.  Fabricated testimony, meanwhile, is invariably false because it is made up by\nthe officer, who knows he is making it up).  At summary judgment, it was Plaintiff's burden to\n54\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 55 of 60\npresent evidence of the alleged fabrication, not Defendant's burden to disprove Plaintiff's\nspeculation.  Having failed to present admissible evidence that any evidence was fabricated in this\ncase, Plaintiff's due process claim must be dismissed.   \nAccordingly, the Court grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment.      \nF. Qualified Immunity\nIn the alternative, Defendant contends that he is entitled to qualified immunity for any of\nhis conduct that for which absolute prosecutorial immunity does not apply.  See Dkt. No. 223-2 at\n53-55.  The Court agrees.\n\"The doctrine of qualified immunity shields public officials from liability for civil\ndamages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional\nrights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" Salahuddin v. Goord, 467 F.3d 263, 273\n(2d Cir. 2006) (citing Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S. Ct. 2727, 73 L. Ed. 2d 396\n(1982)).  \nFor a constitutional right to be \"clearly established\" for purposes of\ndetermining whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity, the\n\"contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable\nofficial would understand that what he is doing violates that right. \nThis is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified\nimmunity unless the very action in question has previously been\nheld unlawful, but it is to say that in the light of pre-existing law the\nunlawfulness must be apparent.\"\nMollica v. Volker, 229 F.3d 366, 370-71 (2d Cir. 2000) (quoting Anderson v. Creiehton, 483 U.S.\n635, 640 (1987)) (emphasis in original).  \"Where the right at issue in the circumstances\nconfronting police officers ... was clearly established but was violated, the officers will\nnonetheless be entitled to qualified immunity 'if ... it was objectively reasonable for them to\n55\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 56 of 60\nbelieve their acts did not violate those rights.'\" Zellner v. Summerlin, 494 F.3d 344, 367 (2d Cir.\n2007) (quotation and other citation omitted).  \n\"Although a mere mistake in the performance of an official duty may not deprive the\nofficer of qualified immunity, the doctrine does not shield performance that either (a) was in\nviolation of clearly established law, or (b) was plainly incompetent.\" Manganiello v. City of New\nYork, 612 F.3d 149, 165 (2d Cir. 2010) (citations omitted).  \"With respect to both the legal\nquestion and the matter of competence, the officials' actions must be evaluated for objective\nreasonableness. ...  That is, '[e]ven if the right at issue was clearly established in certain respects\n... an officer is still entitled to qualified immunity if \"officers of reasonable competence could\ndisagree\" on the legality of the action at issue in its particular factual context.'\" Id. (quotations\nomitted).  \nThe determination of whether an official's conduct was objectively reasonable is a mixed\nquestion of law and fact.  See Zellner, 494 F.3d at 367 (citing Kerman v. City of New York, 374\nF.3d 93, 109 (2d Cir. 2004)) (other citations omitted).  \"The ultimate question of whether it was\nobjectively reasonable for the officer to believe that his conduct did not violate a clearly\nestablished right, i.e., whether officers of reasonable competence could disagree as to the\nlawfulness of such conduct, is to be decided by the court.\" Id. (citation omitted).  \"However, '[a]\ncontention that ... it was objectively reasonable for the official to believe that his acts did not\nviolate those rights has \"its principle focus on the particular facts of the case.\"'\" Id. (quotation and\nother citations omitted).  \nIf there is no dispute as to any material fact, the issue of whether the official's conduct was\nobjectively reasonable is an issue of law to be decided by the court.  See id. at 368 (citation\nomitted).  Any unresolved factual issues, however, must be resolved by the jury.  See id. (quoting\n56\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 57 of 60\nKerman, 374 F.3d at 109) (other citations omitted).  Once the court has received the jury's\ndecision as to \"what the facts were that the officer faced or perceived,\" the court must then \"make\nthe ultimate legal determination of whether qualified immunity attaches on those facts.\" \nStephenson v. Doe, 332 F.3d 68, 81 (2d Cir. 2003) (quotation omitted); see also Lennon v. Miller,\n66 F.3d 416, 421 (2d Cir. 1995) (quotation omitted).\nAs discussed above, Plaintiff takes issue with many of the decisions Defendant made in\nthe underlying criminal case, including the fact that he was targeted for prosecution while others\nwere not.  Absent from the record, however, is any evidence that Defendant acted in an unlawful\nmanner or that an objectively reasonable officer would believe that Defendant acted in an\nunlawful manner.  Plaintiff's attempts at impugning the quality of the investigation are insufficient\nto create a question of fact precluding granting Defendant's motion on this alternative ground. \nSee Ferris v. City of Cadillac, Mich., 726 Fed. Appx. 473, 481 (6th Cir. 2018) (finding that the\ndefendants were entitled to qualified immunity on the plaintiff's fabrication of evidence claim\nwhere the record revealed only inferences of negligence in the defendants' investigation of a\nchild's cause of death) (quoting Caminata v. County of Wexford, 664 Fed. Appx. 496, 501 (6th\nCir. 2016)).\nIV. CONCLUSION\nAlthough evidence in the record suggests that Investigator Ogden and other individuals\nfrom the New York State Police were not thrilled with the work Defendant was doing, the length\nof the investigation, and the lack of progress at certain points, nothing in the record suggests that\nDefendant fabricated evidence or improperly coerced individuals into perjuring themselves.  The\nunderlying criminal investigation was exceedingly broad in scope, and it was not conducted by\nthe Rensselaer County District Attorney's office and all of its resources.  Rather, it was conducted\n57\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 58 of 60\nby Defendant (a former assistant district attorney who was then in private practice) and two\ninvestigators from the New York State Police.  It is beyond dispute that mistakes were made and\nsome aspects of the underlying investigation were handled in a way that would not be considered\ntypical.  Despite Plaintiff's perceived and the actual shortcomings of that investigation, what is\nlacking is any evidence that would permit a reasonable factfinder to find that Defendant\nfabricated evidence or coerced witnesses into providing false testimony. \nAt oral argument on the motion, the Court noted that not one of the witnesses that\nprovided evidence against Plaintiff in the underlying criminal case has ever come forward and\nindicated they were told to fabricate evidence or lie on the witness stand.  See Tr. at 13.  The\nCourt asked Plaintiff's counsel what evidence, aside from Plaintiff's own affidavit, was available\nto \"establish that any of these witnesses were told to fabricate evidence[?]\" Id.  In response,\nPlaintiff's counsel provided the following answer:\nWell, why then has Mr. McGrath not been charged?  Why\nwas Mr. McGrath allowed to continue on with absolute immunity\nwhen the first words out of his mouth were [to] call the victim\nvoters liars which demonstrably was false.  Irrefutably\ndemonstrably false.  He purposely lied about what he did.  He\nessentially said he did nothing wrong whatsoever, and that all\nemanated directly after Mr. Smith told my client to his face what\nyou know is recorded in the records that he was going to prosecute\nhim in the grand jury.\nSo, that same day he called Mr. McGrath.  That same day\nand thereafter Mr. McGrath then came in for absolute immunity. \nNow we don't really know what occurred because we weren't there. \nEither he gave a brief summary of what he was going to say, or as\nOgden testified in one of the trials, he just was given absolute\nimmunity and then he spoke.  But in any event, the cooperation\nagreement specifically says if you don't tell everything and you\naren't truthful in every detail, you don't get the benefit of the\nbargain and you may prosecuted. \n58\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 59 of 60\nId. at 13-14.  Later on, when discussing Defendant's suspected coercion of witnesses, Plaintiff's\ncounsel further acknowledges that \"[w]e weren't there.  We don't know.  We don't know how he\ndid it, but, again, I suspect it was a lot of cajoling and talking.\" Id. at 25.  These exchanges\nhighlight the problem with Plaintiff's case.  He has no evidence other than his own conclusory\nassertions, that are supported by nothing more than his own bald speculation that Defendant\nengaged in nefarious conduct.  Such speculative allegations are insufficient to create a question of\nfact.  See Debrosse v. City of New York, 739 Fed. Appx. 48, 51 (2d Cir. 2018) (holding that the\nplaintiff's conclusory, speculative allegations in his deposition testimony and summary judgment\naffidavit failed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether city police officers\nfabricated information that was likely to influence jury's verdict); Fappiano v. City of New York,\n640 Fed. Appx. 115, 118-19 (2d Cir. 2016) (same); Scotto v. Almenas, 143 F.3d 105, 115 (2d Cir.\n1998) (holding the plaintiff's evidence, which \"consists primarily of several telephone calls and\nother communications between Almenas's and the non-government defendants ... does no more\nthan demonstrate that [the non-government defendants] cooperated with Almenas's investigation\ninto Scotto's alleged parole violation\" and, as such, summary judgment was appropriate); San\nFilippo v. U.S. Trust Co., 737 F.2d 246, 256 (2d Cir. 1984) (holding that there was \"nothing\nsuspicious or improper in such meetings, which are routine and necessary in the preparation of\nevidence,\" and that the \"mere allegation of their occurrence is [not] sufficient to create a material\nissue of fact as to whether something improper took place during them\"); Gilliard v. City of New\nYork, No. 10-cv-5187, 2013 WL 521529, *6 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 11, 2013) (holding that \"[s]imply\nasserting that a party is lying is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact\").\nFinally, the Court acknowledges that Plaintiff believes that he was treated less favorably\nthan others he claims were more clearly culpable in the alleged voter fraud.  While this may well\n59\n\nCase 1:15-cv-01505-MAD-DJS   Document 242   Filed 08/11/22   Page 60 of 60\nbe true, the decision to not offer Plaintiff a favorable deal or immunity must be placed into\ncontext: he was and is the Democratic Commissioner of the Board of Elections, tasked with\nensuring the integrity of the elections in his jurisdiction.  While Plaintiff may believe that others\nwere unjustifiably treated more favorably, none of these individuals was in a position comparable\nto Plaintiff.         \nAfter carefully reviewing the entire record in this matter, the parties' submissions and the\napplicable law, and for the above-stated reasons, the Court hereby\nORDERS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment (Dkt. No. 223) is GRANTED\nin its entirety; and the Court further\nORDERS that Plaintiff's amended complaint (Dkt. No. 185) is DISMISSED with\nprejudice; and the Court further\nORDERS that the Clerk of the Court shall enter judgment in Defendant's favor and close\nthis case; and the Court further\nORDERS that the Clerk of the Court shall serve a copy of this Memorandum-Decision\nand Order on the parties in accordance with the Local Rules.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nDated: August 11, 2022\nAlbany, New York\n60",

McDonough has alleged conspiracies involving both types of defendants. \n \n2  McDonoughโs claims against Smith were brought against him in his official and individual capacities. The district \n  court dismissed the former on the basis of Eleventh Amendment immunity. That decision is not challenged in this \nappeal. Thus, it is only the individual capacity claims that we address. \n \n3  Defendant John J. Ogden, a New York State Police Trooper who worked with Smith as an investigator in the criminal \n  case against McDonough, has filed a brief in this court arguing that the district court correctly concluded that \nMcDonoughโs due process claim was timeโbarred. Although this Court previously granted Ogdenโs motion to \nintervene for the purpose of seeking a stay pending a reconsideration motion in the district court, the judgment \nentered by the district court under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) and authorization for interlocutory appeal \nonly applied to DefendantโAppellee Smith. \n \n4  McDonough, as the Democratic Rensselaer County Elections Commissioner, is responsible for ensuring that all \n  qualified  voters  may  exercise  their  right  to  vote.  See  Board  of  Elections, \nwww.rensco.com/departments/boardโofโelections/ (last visited Jun. 20, 2018). Part of the responsibilities of a \nBoard of Elections, and by extension, a Commissioner, is to receive applications for absentee ballots and determine \n6 \n \n\n \n \nMcDonough v. Smith, 898 F.3d 259 (2018)   \n \n \nwhether the applicants are qualified to vote. N.Y. Elec. Law ยง 8โ402(1). McDonough, as an elections commissioner, \nwas a fullโtime employee of Rensselaer County. \n \n5  Although Smith filed a motion to dismiss McDonoughโs complaint, he did not argue that McDonoughโs due process \n  claim was untimely. Nonetheless, the district court concluded, as other Defendants had raised untimeliness issues as \nto the fabrication of evidence claim, that the claim was also untimely as to Smith. Plaintiff does not challenge that \nSmith may assert the untimeliness of that claim in this appeal. \n \n6  The district court also determined that McDonoughโs malicious prosecution claim was timely because it had not \n  accrued until his acquittal. That claim is still proceeding in the district court as to other Defendants. \n \n7  At times, McDonough characterizes the fabrication of evidence claim against Smith as a conspiracy to fabricate \n  evidence with other Defendants. That does not affect our conclusion as to the accrual of that claim. \n \n8  District courts in this Circuit have followed Veal and concluded that a ยง 1983 claim based on fabricated evidence \n  โaccrues when the plaintiff learns or should have learned that the evidence was fabricated and such conduct causes \nthe claimant some injury.โ Mitchell v. Home, 377 F.Supp.2d 361, 373 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) \n \n9  McDonough does not allege that fabricated evidence was used against him in the second trial that was not \n  presented in the first. \n \n10  The elements of a malicious prosecution claim require a plaintiff to establish that โ(1) the defendant initiated a \n  prosecution against [the] plaintiff, (2) without probable cause to believe the proceeding can succeed, (3) the \nproceeding was begun with malice and, (4) the matter terminated in plaintiffโs favor.โ Ricciuti, 124 F.3d at 130. The \nelements are the same for the New York tort and the constitutional one. See id.; Colon v. City of New York, 60 N.Y.2d \n78, 82, 468 N.Y.S.2d 453, 455 N.E.2d 1248 (1983). \n \n11  The district court, however, concluded that Smith was entitled to absolute immunity from the malicious prosecution \n  claim. That decision is addressed later in this opinion. \n \n12  As one district court in this Circuit aptly explained: โA right to a fair trial claim is distinct from a malicious \n  prosecution claim.โ Bailey v. City of New York, 79 F.Supp.3d 424, 446 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (emphasis added). \n \n13  The Supreme Court in Wallace stated that there may be circumstances where the district court might exercise its \n  discretion to stay the civil action until the criminal case is resolved, but that is not relevant here. Wallace, 549 U.S. at \n7 \n \n\n \n \nMcDonough v. Smith, 898 F.3d 259 (2018)   \n \n \n393โ94, 127 S.Ct. 1091. \n \n14  We are also not persuaded by McDonoughโs reliance on the Supreme Courtโs recent decision in Manuel v. City of \n  Joliet, Ill., which held that a plaintiff (formerly a criminal defendant) may seek damages under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \nconcerning his pretrial detention on the ground that it violated the Fourth Amendment for the period of pretrial \ndetention after his arrest. โโโ U.S. โโโโ, 137 S.Ct. 911, 914, 197 L.Ed.2d 312 (2017). That a claim under the Fourth \nAmendment may be based on events occurring after an arrest does not affect our conclusion that McDonoughโs due \nprocess claim accrued well before his acquittal, and the Supreme Court stated in Manuel that its recognition that \nthe Fourth Amendment applies to a period after the arrest did not necessarily alter the accrual date of that and \nother causes of action, and left the question for the Courts of Appeals to resolve. Id. at 922. \n \n15  McDonough also asserts on appeal that Smithโs appointment as Special District Attorney was invalid under New \n  York law and that the conduct McDonough was charged with in the indictment could not meet the elements of the \nvarious state criminal statutes. In order to strip Smith of his absolute prosecutorial immunity, McDonough would be \nrequired to show Smith proceeded despite a โclear absence of all jurisdictionโ for the prosecution. Barr v. Abrams, \n810 F.2d 358, 361 (2d Cir. 1987). He has not done so. Also, as to the claim that Smith was not properly appointed, \nthe correct forum for such a claim would be in the New York courts. In Working Families Party v. Fisher, 23 N.Y.3d \n539, 992 N.Y.S.2d 172, 15 N.E.3d 1181 (2014), the New York Court of Appeals held that the method for challenging \nthe appointment of a special prosecutor is through a N.Y. C.P.L.R. Article 78 proceeding. McDonough did not pursue \nthe Article 78 course to invalidate Smithโs appointment. Rather, McDonough alleged in his complaint that he sought \nto have Smith disqualified by petitioning the County to file an action in the state courts to nullify Smithโs \nappointment, and later filing a motion in his criminal case to dismiss the charges on the basis that Smithโs \nappointment was unlawful.

As to the claim concerning the New York criminal statutes, the \nappropriate forum for challenging the application of the state criminal statutes to McDonoughโs alleged conduct \nwas in McDonoughโs two state criminal trials, not during this subsequent civil action under ยง 1983. To the extent he \nargues that this should support his malicious prosecution claim, the argument does not affect Smithโs absolute \nimmunity for his prosecutorial conduct, as it is the heartland of such a protection.

See Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U.S. 56, 70, \n113 S.Ct. 538, 121 L.Ed.2d 450 (1992) (โCertain wrongs affect more than a single right and, accordingly, can \nimplicate more than one of the Constitutionโs commandsโ). Moreover, because the Second Circuit understood \nMcDonoughโs due process claim to allege a deprivation of liberty, we have no occasion to consider the proper \nhandling of a fabricated-evidence claim founded on an allegation that the use of fabricated evidence was so \negregious as to shock the conscience, see, e.g., County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 849, 118 S.Ct. 1708, \n140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998), or caused harms exclusively to โinterests other than the interest in freedom from physical \nrestraint,โ Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 283, 114 S.Ct. 807, 127 L.Ed.2d 114 (1994) (Kennedy, J., concurring in \njudgment); see also, e.g., W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts ยง 119, p. \n870 (5th ed. 1984) (Prosser & Keeton) (โ[O]ne who is wrongfully prosecuted may suffer both in reputation and by \nconfinementโ). Accordingly, we do not address what the accrual rule would be for a claim rooted in other types of \nharm independent of a liberty deprivation, as no such claim is before us. See 898 F.3d 259, 266 (CA2 2018). \n \n3  The Second Circuit borrowed the common-law elements of malicious prosecution to govern McDonoughโs distinct \n  constitutional malicious prosecution claim, which is not before us. See 898 F.3d at 268, n. 10. This Court has not \ndefined the elements of such a ยง 1983 claim, see Manuel v. Joliet, 580 U. S. โโโโ, โโโโ โ โโโโ, 137 S.Ct. 911, \n921โ922, 197 L.Ed.2d 312 (2017), and this case provides no occasion to opine on what the elements of a \nconstitutional malicious prosecution action under ยง 1983 are or how they may or may not differ from those of a \nfabricated-evidence claim. Similarly, while noting that only McDonoughโs malicious prosecution claim was barred on \nabsolute-immunity grounds below, we make no statement on whether or how the doctrine of absolute immunity \nwould apply to McDonoughโs fabricated-evidence claim. Any further consideration of that question is properly \naddressed by the Second Circuit on remand, subject to ordinary principles of waiver and forfeiture. \n \n4  Though McDonough was not incarcerated pending trial, he was subject to restrictions on his ability to travel and \n  other โ โrestraints not shared by the public generally,โ โ Justices of Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon, 466 U.S. 294, \n301, 104 S.Ct. 1805, 80 L.Ed.2d 311 (1984), and as the case comes to this Court, it is undisputed that McDonough \nhas pleaded a liberty deprivation. See 898 F.3d at 266. \n \n5  Smith urges the Court to steer away from the comparison to malicious prosecution, noting that the Second Circuit \n  treats malicious prosecution claims and fabricated-evidence claims as distinct. See id., at 268, and n. 12. But two \nconstitutional claims may differ yet still both resemble malicious prosecution more than any other common-law \ntort; comparing constitutional and common-law torts is not a one-to-one matching exercise. See, e.g., Heck, 512 U.S. \nat 479, 484, 114 S.Ct. 2364 (analogizing malicious prosecution to several distinct claims). Tellingly, Smith has not \nsuggested an alternative common-law analogy. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 44โ46. \n \n6  Such considerations are why Congress has determined that a petition for writ of habeas corpus, not a ยง 1983 action, \n  โis the appropriate remedy for state prisoners attacking the validity of the fact or length of their confinement,โ \n9 \n \n\n \n \nMcDonough v.

See 512 U.S. at 487, n. 7, 114 S.Ct. 2364. \n \n9  As for Smithโs suggestion that the fabricated evidence could not have caused any liberty deprivation where, as here, \n  there could have been probable cause and there was in fact an acquittal, it suffices to reiterate that we assume the \ncontours of the claim as defined by the Second Circuit, see supra, at 2155 โ 2156, 2156 โ 2157, and nn. 2, 4, and \nthus accept its undisputed conclusion that there was a sufficient liberty deprivation here, see 898 F.3d at 266; see \nalso Garnett v. Undercover Officer C0039, 838 F.3d 265, 277 (CA2 2016) (explaining that โa further deprivation of \nliberty can result from the fabrication of evidence even if the initial arrest is lawfulโ). \n \n10  Because McDonoughโs acquittal was unquestionably a favorable termination, we have no occasion to address the \n  broader range of ways a criminal prosecution (as opposed to a conviction) might end favorably to the accused. Cf. \nHeck, 512 U.S. at 486โ487, 114 S.Ct. 2364. To the extent Smith argues that the law in this area should take account \nof prosecutorsโ broad discretion over such matters as the terms on which pleas will be offered or whether charges \nwill be dropped, those arguments more properly bear on the question whether a given resolution should be \nunderstood  as  favorable  or  not.  Such  considerations  might  call  for  a  context-specific  and  more  capacious \nunderstanding of what constitutes โfavorableโ termination for purposes of a ยง 1983 false-evidence claim, but that is \nnot the question before us. \n \n1  See Preiser, 411 U.S. at 500, 93 S.Ct. 1827 (โ[W]hen a state prisoner is challenging the very fact or duration of his \n  physical imprisonment, and the relief he seeks is a determination that he is entitled to immediate release or a \nspeedier release from that imprisonment,โ he cannot bring suit under ยง 1983); Heck, 512 U.S. at 486โ487, 114 S.Ct. \n2364 (โ[T]o recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment ... a ยง 1983 plaintiff must \nprove that the conviction or sentence has beenโ reversed, expunged, invalidated, or otherwise called into question); \naccord, id., at 486, n. 6, 114 S.Ct. 2364 (explaining that a ยง 1983 action will not lie where a plaintiff would have to \nnegate an element of the offense of which he was convicted to succeed on his ยง 1983 claim). \n \n2  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7 (petitioner) (citing the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments); id., at 42 (respondent) (asserting \n  that the claim is not a procedural due process claim). \n \n10 \n \n\n \n \nMcDonough v.
