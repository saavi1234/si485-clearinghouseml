    "summary": "<p>This is a case about the delays in processing times for provisional unlawful presence waivers in visa applications. On January 23, 2023, a group of immigrants filed this putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. The plaintiffs sued the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and its director under Section 702 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Represented by both private counsel and the American Immigration Council, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs were beneficiaries of approved family-based immigrant visa petitions. Noncitizen beneficiaries of approved immigrant visa petitions who are unlawfully present in and not lawfully admitted or paroled into the U.S. are not able to secure legal status and must appear at a consulate abroad in order to apply for issuance of an immigrant visa. They can then seek admission to the U.S. at a port of entry. They alleged that the defendants' delay in deciding their applications for a provisional waiver&mdash;a required step before they could be set for their consular appointment abroad&mdash;had left the plaintiffs and class members stuck in limbo. While they waited, the plaintiffs were unable to work and remained susceptible to removal from the U.S. The plaintiffs alleged that historically this step had typically taken four to five months, but that in fiscal year 2022 the median processing time reached 31.7 months.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had violated the APA by taking an unreasonable amount of time to process their applications. The plaintiffs argued that the delays impacted human health and welfare because the plaintiffs were unable to seek employment or obtain lawful status in the U.S. The plaintiffs asked the court to apply the six factors identified by the D.C. circuit in <em>Telecomms. Rsch. &amp; Action Ctr. v. FCC</em>&nbsp;to determine whether the agency's delay was unreasonable. Under that framework, the plaintiffs argued that:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1) \"Rule of Reason\": USCIS did not follow a rule of reason in adjudicating provisional waiver applications.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2) Statutory Benchmark: Congress had expressed that USCIS should adjudicate provisional unlawful presence waiver applications within 180 days.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3&amp;5) Prejudice and Harm to Health and Welfare Due to Delay: Much of this section of the complaint was redacted, but the plaintiffs asserted that class members had faced hardships due to the delays because they were unable to make plans due to the uncertainty surrounding their application.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>4) Competing Parties: USCIS had a history of prioritizing family unity and the delay in the applications had caused harm to the plaintiffs and their families because of the uncertainty they faced and fear of being separated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>6) Unreasonable Delay Does Not Require Impropriety: The plaintiffs argued that the processing times of roughly three years were unreasonable and did not have to be the result of bad faith or other impropriety.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the defendants violated the APA and an order compelling USCIS to decide the provisional waiver applications for the named plaintiffs within 30 days, and future applications within 180 days of filing. They also asked the court to certify a class defined as: &ldquo;all individuals: (a) who filed, or will file in the future, an application with USCIS for a provisional unlawful presence waiver (Form I-601A or any successor form), and (b) whose applications have been pending for at least twelve months from the date of filing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>On January 26, 2023 the case was assigned to Judge Tana Lin. The same day, the plaintiffs filed a separate motion to certify their class.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case was ongoing as of February 12, 2023.</p>",

JADDOU, Director of \n9  USCIS, \n10    Defendants. \n11 \n \nINTRODUCTION \n12 \n1.  Plaintiffs are the beneficiaries of approved family-based immigrant visa petitions. The \n13 \npetitions were filed either by U.S. citizens or U.S. lawful permanent residents. While Defendant \n14 \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has approved the immigrant visa petitions \n15 \nfiled on Plaintiffs’ behalf, USCIS’ unreasonable delay in deciding their applications for a \n16 \nprovisional waiver—a required step before they can be set for their consular appointment \n17 \nabroad—has left Plaintiffs and class members stuck in a bureaucratic nightmare. They cannot \n18 \nwork and remain susceptible to removal from the United States while waiting for a decision on \n19 \ntheir waiver applications. Without the timely historical processing that this step has normally \n20 \nenjoyed (4-5 months), Plaintiffs and class members cannot finalize the process to become U.S. \n21 \nlawful permanent residents. Plaintiffs seek a return to the historical processing times for their \n22 \napplications. \n23 \n2.  To obtain a provisional unlawful presence waiver, Plaintiffs and class members file Form \n24 \nI-601A, “Application for Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver” with Defendant USCIS. \n25 \nAccording to government statistics, Defendant USCIS’ median processing time for Form I-601A \n26 \nprovisional waiver applications reached 31.7 months for Fiscal Year 2022 (October 1, 2021 – \n27 \n \n28   \nClass Complaint  7  Gibbs Houston Pauw \n               1000 2d Ave. #1600 \n   Seattle WA 98104 \n        206-682-1080 \n \n  AILA Doc. No. 23012402. (Posted 1/24/23)\n\nCase 2:23-cv-00097   Document 1   Filed 01/23/23   Page 8 of 41\n \n1  September 30, 2022). Those wait times have grown exponentially, from 4.5 months in Fiscal \n2  Year 2018 to 17.1 months in Fiscal Year 2021 to today. The most recent processing times (for \n3  eighty percent of Form I-601A applications) are 34 months and 39.5 months, respectively, at the \n4  two USCIS offices that process these applications. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2022 \n5  (July 1, 2022 – September 30, 2022), Defendant USCIS received 9,349 Form I-601A provisional \n6  unlawful presence waiver applications and completed only 1,290 applications, while 121,793 \n7  applications were pending. \n8  3.  Defendants USCIS and USCIS Director Ur M. Jaddou have not acted with due regard for \n9  the convenience and necessity of Plaintiffs and class members, as the Administrative Procedure \n10  Act (APA) requires. Plaintiffs and class members seek relief pursuant to the APA to end this \n11  harmful and unreasonable delay. \n12  PARTIES \n13  4.  Plaintiff Maria Silvia Guevara Enriquez is a citizen of  . She resides in \n14  . USCIS approved an immigrant visa \n15  classification for Plaintiff Guevara Enriquez in the category of a spouse of a U.S. citizen. On \n16  , Plaintiff Guevara Enriquez filed a Form I-601A with USCIS for a provisional \n17  waiver of unlawful presence in the United States. A consular officer cannot approve Plaintiff \n18  Guevara Enriquez’s immigrant visa application without a waiver of unlawful presence. \n19  Defendant USCIS’ failure to decide Plaintiff Guevara Enriquez’s provisional waiver application \n20  denies Plaintiff Guevara Enriquez the opportunity to become a U.S. lawful permanent resident \n21  because the delay prevents her from proceeding with the immigrant visa application process. \n22  5.   Plaintiff Sofio Callejas Venegas is a citizen of  . He resides in   \n23  . USCIS approved an immigrant visa classification for Plaintiff \n24  Callejas Venegas in the category of a spouse of a U.S. citizen. On  , Plaintiff \n25  Callejas Venegas filed a Form I-601A with USCIS for a provisional waiver of unlawful presence \n26  in the United States. A consular officer cannot approve Plaintiff Callejas Venegas’ immigrant \n27 \n \n28   \nClass Complaint  8  Gibbs Houston Pauw \n               1000 2d Ave. #1600 \n   Seattle WA 98104 \n        206-682-1080 \n \n  AILA Doc.

Defendant USCIS’ failure to decide \n2  Plaintiff Callejas Venegas’ provisional waiver application denies Plaintiff Callejas Venegas the \n3  opportunity to become a U.S. lawful permanent resident because the delay prevents him from \n4  proceeding with the immigrant visa application process. \n5  6.  Plaintiff Kevin Alberto Jimenez Rivas is a citizen of  . He resides in \n6  . USCIS approved an immigrant visa classification \n7  for Plaintiff Jimenez Rivas in the category of a spouse of a U.S. citizen. On  , \n8  Plaintiff Jimenez Rivas filed a Form I-601A with USCIS for a provisional waiver of unlawful \n9  presence in the United States. A consular officer cannot approve Plaintiff Jimenez Rivas’ \n10  immigrant visa application without a waiver of unlawful presence. Defendant USCIS’ failure to \n11  decide Plaintiff Jimenez Rivas’ provisional waiver application denies Plaintiff Jimenez Rivas the \n12  opportunity to become a U.S. lawful permanent resident because the delay prevents him from \n13  proceeding with the immigrant visa application process. \n14  7.  Plaintiff Ismael Montes Cisneros is a citizen of  . He resides in \n15  . USCIS approved an immigrant visa \n16  classification for Plaintiff Montes Cisneros in the category of a spouse of a U.S. citizen. On   \n17  , Plaintiff Montes Cisneros filed a Form I-601A with USCIS for a provisional waiver of \n18  unlawful presence in the United States. A consular officer cannot approve Plaintiff Montes \n19  Cisneros’ immigrant visa application without a waiver of unlawful presence. Defendant USCIS’ \n20  failure to decide Plaintiff Montes Cisneros’ provisional waiver application denies Plaintiff \n21  Montes Cisneros the opportunity to become a U.S. lawful permanent resident because the delay \n22  prevents him from proceeding with the immigrant visa application process. \n23  8.  While the above plaintiffs are proposed class representatives with circumstances \n24  highlighted above, all 248 plaintiffs are suffering financial and emotional hardship due to \n25  USCIS’s unreasonable delay in processing and adjudicating their applications.

Defendant USCIS is a component of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), \n13  6 U.S.C. § 271, and an agency within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), \n14  5 U.S.C. § 551(1). USCIS is responsible for adjudicating all applications and petitions for \n15  immigration benefits, including Form I-601A applications for provisional waivers. \n16  10.  Defendant Ur M.

In her official capacity, she oversees \n17  the adjudication of all applications and petitions for immigration benefits, including Form I-\n18  601A applications for provisional waivers, and the establishing and implementing of governing \n19  policies. She is sued in her official capacity. \n20  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n21  11.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \n22  (federal question jurisdiction). Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99, 106 (1977). \n23  12.  This Court has the authority to grant relief pursuant to the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., to \n24  compel agency action that is unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed, 5 U.S.C. § 706(1), \n25  and pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201.

Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(C) because Plaintiffs \n2  Maria Silvia Guevara Enriquez and Ismael Montes Cisneros reside in this District and no real \n3  property is involved in this action. \n4  14.  Venue is proper in the Seattle Division of the Western District of Washington per Local  \n5  Rule (3)(e)(1).  Plaintiff Maria Silvia Guevara Enriquez is a resident of Kent, Washington, which \n6  is within King County, and Plaintiff Ismael Montes Cisneros is a resident of Sammamish, \n7  Washington, also within King County, and thus, that is where the claim arose. Id. \n8  EXHAUSTION \n9  15.   There are no available remedies for Plaintiffs to exhaust.  \n10  LEGAL BACKGROUND \n11  Family-Based Immigrant Visas and Provisional Unlawful Presence Waivers \n12  16.  To become U.S. lawful permanent residents in a family-based category, Plaintiffs and \n13  class members must complete a two-step process.  \n14  17.  First, a U.S. citizen or U.S. lawful permanent resident must file a petition with USCIS for \n15  an immigrant visa classification on behalf of their noncitizen relative using a Form I-130 Petition \n16  for Alien Relative. See 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 204.2.  \n17  18.  Second, if Defendant USCIS approves the petition, noncitizens who will consular process \n18  must apply to the State Department for an immigrant visa. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1201(a), 1202(a); \n19  22 C.F.R. §§ 42.61-62.  \n20  19.  Noncitizen beneficiaries of an approved immigrant visa petition who are (a) unlawfully \n21  present in the United States, and (b) not lawfully admitted or paroled into the United States, like \n22  Plaintiffs and class members, must appear at a consulate abroad in order to apply for issuance of \n23  an immigrant visa and then seek admission at a port of entry.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1201(a); 22 C.F.R. \n24  §§ 42.61-62  \n25  20.  A noncitizen “unlawfully present” in the United States who has not been admitted or \n26  paroled is, with limited exceptions, ineligible to adjust status in the United States on the basis of \n27 \n \n28   \nClass Complaint  19  Gibbs Houston Pauw \n               1000 2d Ave. #1600 \n   Seattle WA 98104 \n        206-682-1080 \n \n  AILA Doc. No. 23012402. (Posted 1/24/23)\n\nCase 2:23-cv-00097   Document 1   Filed 01/23/23   Page 20 of 41\n \n1  a family-based immigrant petition. 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B); 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). A noncitizen is \n2  “deemed” to be unlawfully present if “present in the United States after the expiration of the \n3  period of stay authorized by the [DHS Secretary]1 or is present in the United States without \n4  being admitted or paroled.” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(ii). \n5  21.  If the noncitizen departs the United States after being unlawfully present for more than \n6  180 days but less than one year without receiving the provisional waiver, they become \n7  inadmissible to the United States and are ineligible for a visa for three years. 8 U.S.C. \n8  § 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(I). \n9  22.  If the noncitizen departs the United States after being unlawfully present for at least one \n10  year, without receiving the provisional waiver, they become inadmissible to the United States \n11  and are ineligible for a visa for ten years from their date of departure. 8 U.S.C. \n12  § 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II). \n13  23.  A consular officer cannot approve an immigrant visa if the officer knows that the \n14  applicant is ineligible to receive a visa. 8 U.S.C. § 1201(g). \n15  24.  Congress gave the DHS Secretary the exclusive authority to waive inadmissibility for \n16  unlawful presence for “an immigrant who is the spouse or the son or daughter” of a U.S. citizen \n17  or U.S. lawful permanent resident, if the Secretary determines that the U.S. citizen or U.S. lawful \n18  permanent resident spouse or parent of the immigrant would suffer “extreme hardship” if the \n19  immigrant is refused admission to the United States. See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(v); 8 C.F.R. \n20  § 212.7(e)(3). The Secretary exercises this authority through Defendant USCIS. See 8 C.F.R. \n21  § 212.7(e)(3). \n22  25.  In 2013 and 2016, DHS, through its component Defendant USCIS, promulgated detailed \n23  regulations that permit certain individuals who are present in the United States to request from \n24  USCIS a provisional waiver of inadmissibility before departing the United States for consular \n25 \n \n26 \n1 After Congress transferred immigration authority to DHS in 2003, a statutory reference to the \n27  Attorney General is “deemed to refer to the [DHS] Secretary.” See 6 U.S.C. § 557. \n \n28   \nClass Complaint  20  Gibbs Houston Pauw \n               1000 2d Ave. #1600 \n   Seattle WA 98104 \n        206-682-1080 \n \n  AILA Doc.

See Expansion of Provisional Unlawful Presence Waivers of \n2  Inadmissibility; Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. 50244, 50245 (July 29, 2016); Provisional Unlawful \n3  Presence Waivers of Inadmissibility for Certain Immediate Relatives; Final Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. \n4  536(Jan. 3, 2013). “Having an approved provisional waiver helps facilitate immigrant visa \n5  issuance at DOS, streamlines both the waiver and the immigrant visa processes, and reduces the \n6  time that applicants are separated from their U.S. citizen or LPR family members, thus \n7  promoting family unity.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 50244.2 \n8  26.  When adjudicating provisional waiver applications, USCIS officers may issue a Request \n9  for Evidence (RFE) to applicants to obtain more information as to eligibility before issuing a \n10  decision, including, but not limited to, evidence of extreme hardship. For other types of filings, \n11  USCIS may provide up to 87 days to submit a response to an RFE. In keeping with the agency’s \n12  streamlining of the provisional waiver application process, Defendant USCIS sets a deadline of \n13  30 days for responses to RFEs issued in connection with Form I-601A applications. See 1 USCIS \n14  Policy Manual Part E, ch. 6, § F.3, chart & n.54. “USCIS will retain the 30-day RFE response \n15  period, because USCIS and DOS closely coordinate immigrant visa and provisional waiver \n16  application processing. The 30-day RFE response time streamlines USCIS processing, prevents \n17  lengthy delays at DOS, and allows applicants to complete immigrant visa processing in a timely \n18  manner.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 50258. \n19  27.  The noncitizen is allowed to wait in the United States while Defendant USCIS \n20  adjudicates the provisional unlawful presence waiver but having a pending or approved waiver \n21  application does not qualify an individual to seek work authorization or grant them any lawful \n22  immigration status. 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(2).  \n23 \n \n24 \n2 An outstanding final order of removal does not render an otherwise eligible noncitizen \n25  ineligible, if “the [noncitizen] has already filed and USCIS has already granted . . . an application \nfor consent to reapply for admission under section 212(a)(9)(A)(iii) of the Act and 8 CFR \n26 \n212.2(j).” 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(4)(iv). \n27   \n \n28   \nClass Complaint  21  Gibbs Houston Pauw \n               1000 2d Ave. #1600 \n   Seattle WA 98104 \n        206-682-1080 \n \n  AILA Doc.

Without an approved Form I-601A provisional waiver, Plaintiffs and class members will \n2  become subject to the unlawful presence bar when they depart the United States to complete the \n3  consular processing required to become U.S. lawful permanent residents. For noncitizens who \n4  have been unlawfully present for between 180 days and one year, they are barred from \n5  readmission for three years, and for those unlawfully present for more than one year, they are \n6  barred from readmission for ten years following their departure from the United States unless \n7  Defendant USCIS approves their applications for provisional waiver before they depart the \n8  United States or unless they apply for and are approved for a distinct waiver form, the Form I-\n9  601, while abroad. USCIS is currently publishing a processing time for the USCIS Nebraska \n10  Service Center of 27.5 months for the I-601 waiver form. Plaintiffs and class members therefore \n11  must wait for USCIS to adjudicate their pending applications or leave, submit a different waiver \n12  form with additional filing fees, and wait years abroad separated from their families while \n13  waiting for the I-601 waiver to be processed.  \n14  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n15  29.

With the waiver, \n5  the consular officer can issue Plaintiffs and class members an immigrant visa if the consular \n6  officer abroad determines that unlawful presence is the only applicable ground of inadmissibility. \n7  44.  USCIS is taking more than seven times as long to adjudicate a Form I-601A provisional \n8  waiver application than it did in FY 2018 – from 4.5 months to the Nebraska Service Center’s \n9  2.8 years and the Potomac Service Center’s nearly 3.3 years.

Courts often evaluate whether an agency’s delay is unreasonable by applying the six \n17  factors identified by the D.C. Circuit in Telecomms. Rsch. & Action Ctr. v. FCC (“TRAC”):  \n18  (1) the time agencies take to make decisions must be governed by a ‘rule of reason’; \n(2) where Congress has provided a timetable or other indication of the speed with \n19 \nwhich it expects the agency to proceed in the enabling statute, that statutory scheme \nmay supply content for this rule of reason; (3) delays that might be reasonable in \n20 \nthe sphere of economic regulation are less tolerable when human health and welfare \n21  are at stake; (4) the court should consider the effect of expediting delayed action on \nagency activities of a higher or competing priority; (5) the court should also take \n22 \ninto account the nature and extent of the interests prejudiced by delay; and (6) the \n23  court need not ‘find any impropriety lurking behind agency lassitude in order to \nhold that agency action is unreasonably delayed.’ \n24 \n25  Telecomms. Rsch. & Action Ctr. v. FCC, 750 F.2d 70, 80 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (citations omitted). See \n26  also Brower v.

Defendant USCIS does not follow a rule of reason in adjudicating Form I-601A \n3  provisional waiver applications. The agency’s median processing time for the Form I-601A \n4  provisional waiver application has increased from under five months from Fiscal Years 2013 \n5  through 2018 to 31.7 months for Fiscal Year 2022. The most recently available processing times \n6  show the Nebraska Service Center decides eighty percent of provisional waiver applications in \n7  34 months and the Potomac Service Center decides eighty percent in 39.5 months. \n8  47.  Defendant Jaddou acknowledges that USCIS processing times are unreasonable. On \n9  February 2, 2022 (almost a full year ago, and when processing times were shorter than they are \n10  today), at a briefing for stakeholders on the one-year anniversary of the Biden administration, \n11  Defendant Jaddou stated: “Let me be very clear. Our processing times are too long. There are no \n12  ifs, ands or buts about it.” Suzanne Monyak, USCIS director: Federal immigration funds \n13  ‘critical’ to agency, Roll Call (Feb. 2, 2022, 7:17 pm), https://rollcall.com/2022/02/02/uscis-\n14  director-federal-immigration-funds-critical-to-agency/. \n15  48.  USCIS’ median processing time for provisional unlawful presence waiver applications \n16  has jumped from under 5 months for the six years from FY 2013 through FY 2018, to 8.7 months \n17  in FY 2019, 11.2 months in FY 2020, 17.1 months in FY 2021, and 31.7 months in FY 2022. \n18  These  substantial increases in processing times do not equate to a reasonable time frame for \n19  processing provisional waiver applications. Barrios Garcia v. DHS, 25 F.4th 430, 454 (6th Cir. \n20  2022) (concluding in the context of agency delays that “it [is] unhelpful to fixate on the average \n21  snail’s pace when comparing snails against snails in a snails’ race.”). \n22  49.  Congress has expressed its expectation that USCIS adjudicate an application for a \n23  provisional unlawful presence waiver within 180 days. “It is the sense of Congress that the \n24  processing of an immigration benefit application should be completed not later than 180 days \n25  after the initial filing of the application.” 8 U.S.C. § 1571(b). \n26 \n27 \n \n28   \nClass Complaint  27  Gibbs Houston Pauw \n               1000 2d Ave. #1600 \n   Seattle WA 98104 \n        206-682-1080 \n \n  AILA Doc.

But by Fiscal Year 2019, the \n2  median processing time reached 8.7 months, and by Fiscal Year 2022, climbed to 31.7 months.  \n3  In Fiscal Year 2021, Defendant USCIS received 45,344 provisional waiver applications, and \n4  completed 20,048, which is 44% of the number received, and ended that fiscal year with 91,796 \n5  applications pending.

In Fiscal Year 2022, Defendant USCIS received 36,309 \n9  applications—20% fewer than in Fiscal Year 2021—but for the entire Fiscal Year 2022, \n10  Defendant USCIS completed only 6,064 applications—18,000 applications fewer than the year \n11  before and only 16.7% of the number received.

These representative Plaintiffs and others similarly situated have built lives spanning \n13  decades in the United States, and all have been injured by Defendants’ increasingly unreasonable \n14  delay in adjudicating their applications, and, as a consequence, the continuing specter of \n15  potentially being separated from their families, including U.S. citizen spouses and children.  \n16  57.  Plaintiffs and class members cannot consular process and, as a result cannot obtain U.S. \n17  lawful permanent residence, and the attendant benefits that status grants, including the stability \n18  that permanent resident status affords. Plaintiffs are unable to work outside the United States \n19  with their current lack of status because they currently have no documentation by which they \n20  could be readmitted to the United States. Their pathway to U.S. citizenship is indefinitely \n21  lengthened as they are not able to begin accruing the years of permanent resident status \n22  necessary to be eligible for naturalization (three if based on marriage to a U.S. citizen or five \n23  years generally). \n24  TRAC Factor 4: Competing Priorities \n25  58.

Indeed, DHS/USCIS rejected proposals from commenters who suggested that they \n2  provide interim benefits while the Form I-601A is pending, assuring the public that “USCIS and \n3  DOS have coordinated closely on this streamlined process” in order to achieve a “close \n4  timeframe between processing of the Form I-601A approval and the immigrant visa application,” \n5  that “will encourage individuals to speed up the consular process.” Id. at 555. “Any issuance of \n6  interim benefits or specific authorized periods of stay will hinder this goal and the integrity of the \n7  program.” Id.; see also 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(2)(ii) (“A pending or an approved provisional \n8  unlawful presence waiver does not support the filing of any application for interim immigration \n9  benefits, such as employment authorization or an advance parole document.”). \n10  62.  In 2016, when DHS/USCIS expanded provisional waivers to noncitizens who could \n11  demonstrate extreme hardship to a lawful permanent resident spouse or parent, the agency said: \n12  “USCIS and DOS will continue to benefit from the operational efficiencies gained from the \n13  provisional waiver’s role in streamlining immigrant visa application processing, but on a larger \n14  scale.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 50246. \n15  63.  DHS/USCIS also maintained the 30-day time limit for responding to a Request for \n16  Evidence in keeping with the agency’s intent that provisional waiver adjudications would \n17  streamline immigrant visa processing. 81 Fed. Reg. at 50258. This 30-day response time remains \n18  in effect today. 1 USCIS Policy Manual Part E, ch. 6, § F.3, chart & n.54. \n19  64.  DHS/USCIS also continued to maintain that the provisional waiver process would reduce \n20  the time spent abroad: “Having an approved provisional waiver helps facilitate immigrant visa \n21  issuance at DOS, streamlines both the waiver and the immigrant visa processes, and reduces the \n22  time that applicants are separated from their U.S. citizen or LPR family members, thus \n23  promoting family unity.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 50250. The agencies explained that the DHS Secretary \n24  directed USCIS to expand the provisional waiver program for operational efficiencies and for \n25  reducing time spent abroad: “Based on the lengthy separation periods and related financial and \n26  emotional burdens to families associated with the Form I–601 [unlawful presence] waiver \n27 \n \n28   \nClass Complaint  32  Gibbs Houston Pauw \n               1000 2d Ave. #1600 \n   Seattle WA 98104 \n        206-682-1080 \n \n  AILA Doc.

Defendant USCIS’ delay in adjudicating provisional unlawful presence waiver \n6  applications harms family unity by leaving Plaintiffs and class members and their families, \n7  including a U.S. citizen parent or spouse or children, in fear of being separated and unable to \n8  move forward with their lives because Plaintiffs and the class members are denied the \n9  opportunity to become U.S. lawful permanent residents. In the stay of removal context, and \n10  equally applicable here, the Ninth Circuit has recognized separation from family members as an \n11  important factor in demonstrating irreparable harm. Leiva-Perez v. Holder, 640 F.3d 962, 969-70 \n12  (9th Cir. 2001) (per curiam) (citing Andreiu v. Ashcroft, 253 F.3d 477, 484 (9th Cir. 2001) (en \n13  banc)).  \n14  66.  Defendant USCIS received a fee of $715 ($630 filing/$85 biometrics) from Plaintiffs and \n15  class members to adjudicate their applications for provisional unlawful presence waivers. In the \n16  final rule setting the $630 filing fee, the agency stated: “USCIS understands the importance of \n17  facilitating family unification, as well as the advantages that [lawful permanent resident] status \n18  and citizenship provide.” U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Fee Schedule, 81 Fed. Reg. \n19  73292, 73296 (Oct. 24, 2016).4 In the July 2016 final rule expanding eligibility for the \n20  provisional waiver application process, DHS/USCIS responded to commenters who thought the \n21  agency should collect thousands of dollars in fines or fees from applicants: “DHS has already \n22  established an appropriate filing fee for the I-601A application as authorized by the statute.”  \n23  81 Fed. Reg. at  50260. \n24  67.  Family unity is a compelling reason for requiring Defendant USCIS to adjudicate \n25  applications for provisional unlawful presence waivers within a reasonable time, which Plaintiffs \n26 \n \n27  4   The biometrics fee remained unchanged at $85. 81 Fed. Reg. at 73295. \n \n28   \nClass Complaint  33  Gibbs Houston Pauw \n               1000 2d Ave. #1600 \n   Seattle WA 98104 \n        206-682-1080 \n \n  AILA Doc. No. 23012402.

Prioritizing a judicial remedy for one type of application when \n2  Defendant USCIS is also unreasonably delaying the adjudication of other types of requests for \n3  immigration benefits should not be the basis for weighing TRAC Factor 4 in favor of \n4  Defendants. In Fiscal Year 2022, USCIS apparently received approximately $529.2 million \n5  appropriated by Congress. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Fee Schedule and Changes \n6  to Certain Other Immigration Benefit Request Requirements, Proposed Rule, 88 Fed. Reg. 402, \n7  416 (Jan. 4, 2023). “The appropriations support several DHS priorities, for example, decreasing \n8  USCIS application processing times, reducing the backlog of requests already on hand and being \n9  adjudicated (and for which a fee may already have been paid).” Id. \n10  TRAC Factor 6: Unreasonable Delay Does Not Require Impropriety \n11  68.  USCIS is required to decide the applications for provisional unlawful presence waiver \n12  filed by Plaintiffs and class members within a reasonable time. Agency delay—processing times \n13  currently at around three years—is unreasonable; unreasonableness does not have to be the result \n14  of bad faith or other impropriety. \n15  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n16  69.  Plaintiffs Guevara Enriquez, Callejas Venegas, Jimenez Rivas, and Montes Cisneros \n17  bring this action on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated pursuant to Federal Rules \n18  of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2), including the other individually named Plaintiffs. A class \n19  action is proper because this action involves questions of law and fact common to the class, the \n20  class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, The claims of Plaintiffs \n21  Guevara Enriquez, Callejas Venegas, Jimenez Rivas, and Montes Cisneros are typical of the \n22  claims of the class, Plaintiffs Guevara Enriquez, Callejas Venegas, Jimenez Rivas, and Montes \n23  Cisneros will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class, and Defendants USCIS \n24  and Jaddou have acted on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive or \n25  corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate with respect to the class as a whole. \n26 \n27 \n \n28   \nClass Complaint  34  Gibbs Houston Pauw \n               1000 2d Ave. #1600 \n   Seattle WA 98104 \n        206-682-1080 \n \n  AILA Doc.

Plaintiffs Guevara Enriquez, Callejas Venegas, Jimenez Rivas, and Montes Cisneros seek \n2  to represent the following class: \n3  All individuals: \n4  (a) who filed, or will file in the future, an application with USCIS for a provisional \n5  unlawful presence waiver (Form I-601A or any successor form), and \n6  (b) whose applications have been pending for at least twelve months from the date of filing.  \n7  71.  The proposed class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. Plaintiffs \n8  Guevara Enriquez, Callejas Venegas, Jimenez Rivas, and Montes Cisneros are not aware of the \n9  precise number of potential members but reasonably estimate that there are at least 70,000 \n10  potential class members. This estimate is based upon USCIS’ data that during Fiscal Year 2022 \n11  (October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022), the agency received 36,309 applications for \n12  provisional unlawful presence waiver, decided 6,064, while 121,793 applications remained \n13  pending. USCIS Number of Service-wide Forms, July – Sept. 2022. The median processing time \n14  for Fiscal Year 2022 was 31.7 months (meaning the time to complete 50% of the applications \n15  during that year). USCIS Median Processing Time FY 2018 – Dec. 31, 2022. \n16  72.  Questions of law and fact predominate over any questions affecting Plaintiffs Guevara \n17  Enriquez, Callejas Venegas, Jimenez Rivas, and Montes Cisneros. Common questions of law \n18  include: \n19  (1) Has USCIS unreasonably delayed in deciding applications for provisional \n20  unlawful presence waiver? \n21  Common questions of fact include: \n22  (1) Has USCIS utilized a “first in, first out” policy in deciding applications for \n23  provisional unlawful presence waiver? \n24  (2) What has USCIS done with the fees the agency collected from applicants for a \n25  provisional unlawful presence waiver?  \n26 \n27 \n \n28   \nClass Complaint  35  Gibbs Houston Pauw \n               1000 2d Ave. #1600 \n   Seattle WA 98104 \n        206-682-1080 \n \n  AILA Doc.

(Posted 1/24/23)\n\nCase 2:23-cv-00097   Document 1   Filed 01/23/23   Page 36 of 41\n \n1  (3) Why has the processing time for the application for provisional unlawful \n2  presence waiver increased from under five months for six years (from Fiscal Year \n3  2013 through 2018) to 8.7 months in Fiscal Year 2019, to highs of 32 to 38 \n4  months? \n5  73.  The claims of Plaintiffs Guevara Enriquez, Callejas Venegas, Jimenez Rivas, and Montes \n6  Cisneros are typical of those of the entire class as each filed an application for provisional \n7  unlawful presence waiver at least 12 months ago and their application has not been decided by \n8  USCIS. Specifically, Plaintiff Guevara Enriquez’s application was filed with USCIS on July 12, \n9  2021; Plaintiff Callejas Venejas’ application was filed with USCIS on September 28, 2020; \n10  Plaintiff Jimenez Rivas’ application was filed with USCIS on October 8, 2020; and Plaintiff \n11  Montes Cisneros’ application was filed with USCIS on April 17, 2020. Plaintiffs Guevara \n12  Enriquez, Callejas Venegas, Jimenez Rivas, and Montes Cisneros share a common harm with the \n13  proposed class as USCIS’ delay in deciding the applications for provisional unlawful presence \n14  waiver denies them the opportunity to proceed with their immigrant visa applications. \n15  74.  Plaintiffs Guevara Enriquez, Callejas Venegas, Jimenez Rivas, and Montes Cisneros will \n16  fairly and adequately represent the interests of the proposed class as they seek relief on behalf of \n17  the class as a whole and they have no interest antagonistic to the class members. \n18  75.  Plaintiffs Guevara Enriquez, Callejas Venegas, Jimenez Rivas, and Montes Cisneros are \n19  represented by competent counsel with extensive experience in both complex class actions and \n20  immigration law.  \n21  76.  By increasing the processing time from under five months from Fiscal Years 2013 \n22  through 2018, to current processing times of 34 months at the Nebraska Service Center and 39.5 \n23  months at the Potomac Service Center, for an application that is predicated on establishing \n24  extreme hardship to a U.S. citizen or U.S. lawful permanent resident spouse or parent, \n25  Defendants USCIS and Jaddou have acted and will continue to act on grounds generally \n26  applicable to the entire class, thus making final declaratory or other relief appropriate to remedy \n27 \n \n28   \nClass Complaint  36  Gibbs Houston Pauw \n               1000 2d Ave. #1600 \n   Seattle WA 98104 \n        206-682-1080 \n \n  AILA Doc.

Civ. P. \n2  23(b)(2). \n3  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n4  (APA – Unreasonable Delay in Deciding Form I-601A Provisional Waiver Applications) \n5  77.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all allegations above as though fully \n6  restated here. \n7  78.  The APA provides for judicial review when a person is adversely affected by agency \n8  action. 5 U.S.C. § 702. Agency action includes an agency’s failure to act. 5 U.S.C. § 551(13). A \n9  court “shall compel agency action . . . unreasonably delayed.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(1). \n10  79.  Defendant USCIS has a non-discretionary duty to decide Plaintiffs’ pending Forms I-\n11  601A provisional waiver applications. USCIS is required to give notice of an approval or denial \n12  for all properly filed benefits requests. See 8 C.F.R. § 103.2(b)(19) (defining procedures for \n13  notification of approvals); 8 C.F.R. § 103.3 (defining notification procedures for denials). More \n14  specifically, USCIS “will notify the [noncitizen] and the [noncitizen’s] attorney of record or \n15  accredited representative of the decision [on a Form I-601A] in accordance with 8 CFR \n16  103.2(b)(19).” 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(9)(i) (emphasis added). “With due regard for the convenience \n17  and necessity of the parties or their representatives and within a reasonable time, each agency \n18  shall proceed to conclude a matter presented to it.” 5 U.S.C. § 555(b) (emphasis added). “[B]y \n19  using the term ‘shall’ in requiring that the courts compel action unlawfully withheld or \n20  unreasonably delayed, Congress imposed a mandatory duty in that regard.” Saini v. U.S. \n21  Citizenship & Immigr. Servs., 553 F. Supp. 2d 1170, 1176 (E.D. Cal. 2008). \n22  80.  Defendant USCIS’ duty to adjudicate an application is a discrete, ministerial act that \n23  applicants pay for in advance and that USCIS must complete within a reasonable time. USCIS \n24  set an appropriate fee for the application for unlawful presence waiver based on the statute. \n25  81 Fed. Reg. at 50260. \n26 \n27 \n \n28   \nClass Complaint  37  Gibbs Houston Pauw \n               1000 2d Ave. #1600 \n   Seattle WA 98104 \n        206-682-1080 \n \n  AILA Doc. No. 23012402. (Posted 1/24/23)\n\nCase 2:23-cv-00097   Document 1   Filed 01/23/23   Page 38 of 41\n \n1  81.  USCIS has no rule of reason for adjudicating the Form I-601A provisional waiver \n2  application. \n3  82.  Even if USCIS has a processing methodology, it is not a rule that is reasonable given the \n4  unbounded growth in processing times. USCIS identified median processing times for the Form \n5  I-601A provisional waiver application of 4.5 months in FY 2018, 11.2 months in FY 2020,  31.7 \n6  months in FY 2022. USCIS Median Processing Time FY 2018 – 2023 (up to Dec. 31, 2022). \n7  83.  This Court should not consider USCIS’s current published processing times dispositive \n8  of whether a delay is reasonable because the processing times are inconsistent and not credible. \n9  See Barrios, 25 F.4th at 454. \n10  84.  USCIS’ delay in deciding Plaintiffs’ provisional waiver applications impacts human \n11  health and welfare, not merely economic interests, as Plaintiffs are denied the opportunity to \n12  obtain lawful status in the United States; to seek authorized employment, 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(2); \n13  and to plan their future with their families. The delay leaves Plaintiffs and their families in a state \n14  of uncertainty about whether they will be able to continue living together in the United States \n15  and leaves them without work authorization. \n16  85.  Family unity, which Defendants USCIS and Jaddou recognize as a priority, is a \n17  compelling reason for requiring USCIS to process the provisional waiver applications within the \n18  180-day benchmark that Congress identified. \n19  86.  USCIS’ failure to adjudicate provisional unlawful presence waivers within 180 days after \n20  filing constitutes an unreasonable delay. \n21  87.  Plaintiffs and class members have no alternative remedy available. \n22  88.  Plaintiffs and class members have suffered irreparable harm from Defendants’ delay in \n23  adjudicating their provisional waiver applications. \n24  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n25  WHEREFORE Plaintiffs request that this Court grant the following relief: \n26  A.
