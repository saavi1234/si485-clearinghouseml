    "summary": "<p>This is a case about how the state of Massachusetts allowed thousands of people with disabilities to languish and often deteriorate in nursing facilities, even though they could be living independently. On October 11, 2022, six individuals with disabilities residing in nursing facilities in Massachusetts filed this putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs sued Governor Charlie Baker and state officials employed at the Executive Office of Health and Human Services, the Executive Office of Administration and Finance, the Executive Office of Elder Affairs, and MassHealth under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Medicaid, Title XIX of the Social Security Act. An additional claim was filed under the Nursing Home Reform Amendments (NHRA) on behalf of a putative subclass.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Represented by three advocacy organizations, the Center for Public Representation, Justice in Aging, and the Greater Boston Legal Services, as well as private counsel, the plaintiffs sought: 1) the certification of &nbsp;a class and a subclass, 2) injunctive relief to compel the defendants to expand existing Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) programs and set up new ones, so that people with disabilities in nursing facilities can make informed choices and have meaningful options to live successfully outside nursing homes in the community, 3) a declaration that the defendants violated their rights under the law, and 4) attorneys&rsquo; fees and other appropriate relief.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs first claimed the defendants violated the ADA and Section 504 by failing to provide the individual plaintiffs and members of the class with community residential services and support in the most integrated setting, resulting in their needless institutionalization in nursing facilities. Plaintiffs made additional claims under the Medicaid Act, alleging that the defendants failed to provide, with reasonable promptness: 1) community residential services and supports through HCBS for persons with disabilities in nursing facilities, 2) specialized services for persons with serious medical illness, and 3) culturally competent information and an informed choice of whether to receive services in nursing facilities or in the community to persons with disabilities. A claim specific to the subclass alleged that the defendants violated the NHRA because they failed to appropriately screen for, assess and provide members of the subclass with specialized services, and inappropriately placed members of the subclass in nursing facilities. The case was assigned to District Judge Patti B. Saris.</p>\r\n<p>The individual plaintiffs sought certification of a class defined as &ldquo;all Medicaid-eligible persons with disabilities in Massachusetts who have resided or will reside in a nursing facility for at least 60 days, meet the qualifications for Massachusetts&rsquo; HCBS programs, and need access to appropriate community residential services and supports to live in integrated settings in the community.&rdquo; Approximately 22,000 individuals in Massachusetts nursing facilities qualified under the class sought by plaintiffs. The sought subclass for the NHRA claim included &ldquo;all Medicaid-eligible persons with serious mental illness who have been admitted to, or who should be screened for admission to, nursing facilities pursuant the Medicaid Act. When the lawsuit was filed, at least 1,500 individuals with a serious medical illness resided in nursing facilities across Massachusetts.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a motion to begin discovery on December 1, 2022, which the defendants&rsquo; opposed. The defendants&rsquo; argued that discovery at that early stage would be unfairly prejudicial towards them, and it was both &ldquo;impracticable and unusual&rdquo; for discovery to begin before they had even filed a response to the complaint. Additionally, the defendants&rsquo; sought a protective order, as the plaintiffs&rsquo; discovery request implicated health and personal information that was subject to privacy protections. On March 6, 2023, Judge Saris denied the motion to begin discovery, and on March 16, Magistrate Judge Jennifer C. Boal granted the defendants' request for a protective order.</p>\r\n<p>On April 19, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the following class, &ldquo;All Medicaid-eligible adults in Massachusetts with mental illness and/or physical disabilities, including older adults, who, now or in the future: (1) reside in a nursing facility for at least 60 days, notwithstanding any temporary hospitalizations, and (2) have not been provided community residential services and supports in integrated settings in the community.&rdquo; The plaintiffs also requested certification of the following subclass, &ldquo;All Medicaid-eligible adults with serious mental illness who, now or in the future, have been admitted to, or who were screened for admission to, nursing facilities pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1396r(e)(7) and 42 C.F.R. &sect; 483.112.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>On July 28, 2023, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. On September 7, 2023, Judge Saris recused herself and the case was reassigned to Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 20, 2023, the Department of Justice filed a Statement of Interest in support of the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. The statement argued that class certification was generally appropriate in this kind of case because there were common questions concerning the defendant&rsquo;s systemic policies and practices and single injunctive relief would be appropriate to remedy the unnecessary segregation of a large group of people. Shortly thereafter, on September 28, the Department filed a second Statement of Interest, opposing the defendants' motion to dismiss. This Statement argued that unnecessary segregation was an injury in fact that met Article III standing requirements and that the plaintiffs did not need to request and be denied a specific service to establish standing.</p>\r\n<p>The parties reached a proposed settlement agreement on March 24, 2024, and filed the proposed agreement with the court on April 16, 2024. The settlement agreement provided for increased investment in new housing opportunities and community-based programs for elderly adults and individuals with disabilities. Provisions included the creation of a full-time position for someone to oversee the Community Transition Liaison Program (CTLP) and 45 CTLP teams in the state. Each team assigned to work with a Medicaid-participating nursing facility in the state was to consist of a community transition liaison and case assistant. The expansion of residential services and housing supports capacity included the addition of 400 slots to its Residential Supports waiver program (24/7 supervision and support services in a provider-operated setting), with funding of up to $50,000 for home modifications, and 200 additional beds in group living environments.</p>\r\n<p>The terms of the settlement included certification of a class defined as: &ldquo;All present or future Medicaid-eligible persons who: (i) are Massachusetts residents, (ii) have attained age 22, (iii) reside (at any time before the Termination Date) in a nursing facility within the Commonwealth for 60 days or more, and (iv) either (a) have a &ldquo;disability&rdquo; as defined in the ADA and are qualified for and would not oppose transition to a community-based setting, or (b) have PASRR SMI as determined pursuant to a Level II PASRR evaluation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The agreement further provided that a minimum of 2400 class members would be transitioned to the community over the seven-year term of the agreement. Transitions to provider-operated settings were to be made within 18 months of engagement with state-funded transition assistance services, to their own home within 12 months for those who needed to obtain a home, and within 9 months for those who already had a home. In addition, the state was required to collect, analyze, and share data on the transition efforts.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement agreement consistently emphasized culturally and linguistically competent communication with all individuals. Plaintiffs were awarded $1,800,000.00 in attorneys' fees and costs.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement agreement is awaiting court approval. This case remains ongoing.</p>",

Compl. ¶ 179. Each named Plaintiff is a nursing facility resident \nwho qualifies for the State’s system of home and community-based services and prefers to live \nin a more integrated setting. Compl. ¶¶ 1–2. Their unnecessary segregation is caused in part, \naccording to Plaintiffs, by the State’s failure to provide needed residential services and supports. \nCompl. ¶ 12. Accordingly, the named Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of: \nMedicaid-eligible adults in Massachusetts with mental illness and/or \nphysical disabilities, including older adults, who, now or in the \nfuture:  (1)  reside  in  a  nursing  facility  for  at  least  60  days, \nnotwithstanding any temporary hospitalizations, and (2) have not \nbeen  provided  community  residential  services  and  supports  in \nintegrated settings in the community. \n  1 \n\n \nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG  Document 129  Filed 09/20/23  Page 2 of 11 \nECF No. 76 at 7. Plaintiffs claim that the class includes at least several hundred members. Id. at \n3, 9. \nThe State opposes certification of the proposed class on several grounds, but only two are \nrelevant for purposes of this brief. First, the State argues that class members do not share the \nsame claims because they receive services from “different State agencies administering dozens \nof programs and benefits.” ECF No. 108 at 16. For this same reason, the State further argues \nthat the class does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(2)’s requirement that injunctive relief is appropriate for \nthe class as a whole. ECF No. 108 at 29 (claiming that “the Court cannot fashion a single \ninjunction with dozens of directives ordering at least five different agencies to take specific \nactions in relation to many different programs”). These arguments disregard the longstanding, \ncommonplace, and appropriate certification of classes in similar Olmstead cases, both in this \nCircuit and across the country. As explained in this brief, such classes are regularly certified \nbecause: (1) Olmstead cases raise common questions concerning the defendant’s systemic \npolicies and practices and (2) single injunctive relief is eminently feasible and appropriate to \nremedy the unnecessary segregation of a large group of people. \nAs the agency charged with enforcing Title II and issuing regulations implementing the \nstatute, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12133–34, the Department of Justice has a strong interest in ensuring that \nsystemic violations of the ADA are remedied, including through class actions. The United States \nof America respectfully submits this Statement of Interest in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 5171 \nto assist the Court in addressing the pending motion for class certification. \n \n \n \n \n \n1 The Attorney General is authorized “to attend to the interests of the United States” in any case pending in federal \ncourt. 28 U.S.C. § 517. \n  2 \n\n \nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG  Document 129  Filed 09/20/23  Page 3 of 11 \nLegal Standard \n \nA  court  may  certify  a  class  under  Rule  23(b)(2)  if  the  moving  party  satisfies  all \nrequirements of Rule 23(a), and “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on \ngrounds  that  apply  generally  to  the  class,  so  that  final  injunctive  relief  or  corresponding \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). Rule \n23(a) requires that the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; there is \nat least one question of law or  fact common to the class; the claims or defenses of the \nrepresentative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and the representative \nparties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. \nDukes, 564 U.S. 338, 349 (2011). \nArgument \n \n“[C]ivil rights cases against parties charged with unlawful, class-based discrimination are \nprime  examples”  of  appropriate  class  actions  under  Rule  23.  Wal-Mart,  564  U.S.  at  361 \n(quotations omitted); see Am. Pipe & Const. Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538, 553 (1974). This is \nparticularly true where a public entity’s policy or practice causes unnecessary segregation of \npeople with disabilities, in violation of the integration mandate of Title II of the ADA and the \nSupreme Court’s decision in Olmstead. See, e.g., Kenneth R. v. Hassan, 293 F.R.D. 254, 268 \n(D.N.H. 2013); Lane v. Kitzhaber, 283 F.R.D. 587, 596–97 (D. Or. 2012). \nThe ADA is explicitly intended to remedy “pervasive” discrimination,  42 U.S.C. \n \n§ 12101(a)(2), and particularly discriminatory administration of state services and programs. In \nOlmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), the Supreme Court reviewed Title II of the ADA and its \nimplementing regulation and held that states are prohibited from administering services and \nprograms in a manner that makes them available only in segregated settings even when individuals \n  3 \n\n \nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG  Document 129  Filed 09/20/23  Page 4 of 11 \nwith disabilities can be served in more integrated settings. The Court’s analysis focused on the \nrequirement  that  public  entities  “administer  services,  programs,  and  activities  in  the  most \nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.130(d). The way states “administer” services and programs, practically speaking, is through \npolicies, practices, and funding decisions that impact large numbers of individuals receiving those \nservices.  As explained below, courts have repeatedly and correctly certified class actions in \nOlmstead cases that challenge such policies and practices. \n1.  Olmstead Cases Are Typically Premised on Discriminatory Policies or \nPractices That Provide the Common Contention Necessary to Satisfy \nRule 23’s Commonality Requirement. \n \nRule 23(a)(2) requires that “there are questions of law or fact common to the class.” A \nquestion is common if it is “capable of classwide resolution—which means that determination of \nits truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in \none  stroke.”  Wal-Mart,  564  U.S.  at  350.  The  analysis  focuses  on  whether  the  class-wide \nproceeding can “generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.”  Id. \n(citation omitted).  “Those common answers typically come in the form of a particular and \nsufficiently well-defined set of allegedly illegal policies [or] practices that work similar harm on \nthe class plaintiffs.” Parent/Professional Advocacy League v. City of Springfield, 934 F.3d 13, 28 \n(1st Cir. 2019) (citation omitted). In the Olmstead context, the policies or practices at issue are \nthose that cause the unnecessary segregation, or serious risk of segregation, of people with \ndisabilities. \nGiven that Olmstead cases focus on the defendants’ systemic policies and practices, courts \nregularly conclude that the commonality element is met. See, e.g., Kenneth R., 293 F.R.D. at 254, \n268  (D.N.H.  2013)  (class  certification  appropriate  where  “the  State  practices  plaintiffs \n  4 \n\n \nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG  Document 129  Filed 09/20/23  Page 5 of 11 \nchallenge . . . all pertain to a discrete set of community-based services”); Lane, 283 F.R.D. at 596– \n98 (class certification was appropriate in Olmstead action challenging “system-wide policies, \npractices, and failures” which allegedly caused unnecessary segregation). For example, in Thorpe \nv. District of Columbia, plaintiffs claimed that the District of Columbia violated the ADA by \nunnecessarily institutionalizing people with disabilities in nursing facilities and sought to certify a \nclass of nursing facility residents. 303 F.R.D. 120 (D.D.C. 2014). Specifically, plaintiffs alleged \nthat they were subject to unnecessary segregation because the District maintained a practice of \nineffective transition assistance. Id. at 146. The court found that this claim, centered on a systemic \npractice, raised several common questions and therefore satisfied Rule 23’s requirement of \ncommonality. Id. at 145–49. Similarly, a court in the Southern District of West Virginia recently \ncertified a  class in  Olmstead litigation where plaintiffs are foster children with a range of \ndisabilities who allege that West Virginia’s failure to provide community-based treatment results \nin institutionalization. Jonathan R. v. Justice, 2023 WL 5298813, No. 3:19-cv-00710 (S.D.W.V. \nAug. 17, 2023).  There, the  court found that the state’s alleged practice of maintaining  an \ninadequate infrastructure of therapeutic service providers generated common questions sufficient \nto establish commonality. Id. at 10–14. As exemplified by these cases, Olmstead actions typically \ncall for rulings on system-wide policies and practices that generate common answers and make \nclass treatment appropriate and efficient.  Plaintiffs’ claims here similarly center on common \npractices of the State. These alleged common practices include, for example, the State’s use of \neligibility criteria and methods of administration that have the effect of excluding people with \ndisabilities from accessing needed community-based residential services, Compl. ¶¶ 38, 181, 183, \n197; the State’s failure to provide timely access to residential services that would allow people \nwith disabilities to transition to the community, Compl. ¶¶ 10, 12, 38, 115, 179, 181; and the \n  5 \n\n \nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG  Document 129  Filed 09/20/23  Page 6 of 11 \nState’s failure to provide people with disabilities with sufficient information to allow them to \nmake an informed choice of whether to enter—or remain in—a nursing facility, Compl. ¶¶ 11-12, \n38, 97, 115, 181, 187-88. \nDefendants suggest that class members’ different factual circumstances in this case defeat \nthe existence of such common questions. ECF No. 108 at 16–20. But courts routinely certify \nclasses  in  Olmstead  litigation  even  though  there  are  inevitably  differences  among  people’s \ndiagnoses, methods of service delivery, and need for services. See Kenneth R., 293 F.R.D. at 268– \n70 (rejecting defendant’s argument that dissimilarities in class member needs and preferences for \ncommunity-based services made class certification improper); Pashby v. Cansler, 279 F.R.D. 347, \n351, 353–54 (E.D.N.C. 2011) (same); Rolland v. Patrick, No. 98-30208, 2008 WL 4104488, *4 \n(D. Mass. 2008) (same); see also Jonathan R., 2023 WL 5298813 at 3, 14 n. 9 (certifying a class \nof foster care children “who have physical, intellectual, cognitive, or mental health disabilities”). \nFor instance, plaintiffs in Steward v. Janek alleged that Texas’s nursing facility screening process \nfailed to identify people for community-based care and divert them from unnecessary segregation. \n315 F.R.D. 472 (W.D. Tex. 2016). The court found common questions related to this claim, \nrejecting the state’s argument that “the deficiencies of their [screening] process are not capable of \nclasswide assessment because the deficiencies will manifest as the failure to identify different \nmedical conditions in different individuals.” Id. at 482. In finding that commonality exists, courts \nhave been likewise undaunted by the fact that plaintiffs in Olmstead cases are often receiving \nservices across a range of programs and government offices.  Kenneth R., 293 F.R.D. at 268 \n(“[T]he commonality requirement has been held to be met where, as here, plaintiffs challenge more \nthan a single service deficiency and seek more than one service enhancement or improvement as \npart of the remedy.”). \n  6 \n\n \nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG  Document 129  Filed 09/20/23  Page 7 of 11 \n2.  Olmstead Claims Are Regularly Resolved Through a Single Injunctive \nRemedy. \n \nPlaintiffs seek class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) and thus must show that “the party \nopposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that \nfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a \nwhole.” Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 23(b)(2). Civil rights actions seeking injunctive relief are quintessential \nRule 23(b)(2) cases. Nat’l Ass’n of Deaf v. Harvard Univ., No. 3:15-CV-30023-KAR, 2019 WL \n6699449, at *2 (D. Mass. Dec. 9, 2019); Connor B. ex rel. Vigurs v. Patrick, 272 F.R.D. 288, 297 \n(D. Mass. 2011). It follows that an Olmstead lawsuit—brought to enforce the civil right of people \nwith disabilities to live in an integrated setting—is precisely the type of case intended to be litigated \nas a class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2). \nFor  example,  the  D.C.  Circuit  upheld  class  certification  under  Rule  23(b)(2)  in  the \nOlmstead lawsuit alleging that the District of Columbia unnecessarily segregated adults in nursing \nfacilities. In re District of Columbia, 792 F.3d 96 (D.C. Cir. 2015). In doing so, the court of \nappeals rejected the District’s argument that Rule 23(b)(2) certification was improper because the \n“unique totality of barriers to community transition for each individual class members makes \ngrouping of the claims inappropriate.” Id. at 101–02. The court reasoned simply that there is a \n“common civil right to non-segregation” and that “Rule 23(b)(2) was intended for civil rights \ncases.” Id. When that case returned on appeal, the court reaffirmed the appropriateness of class \ncertification and rejected the district court’s post-trial denial of class certification. It held that \n“[b]ecause the proposed injunction would provide, at least in part, each member of the class an \nincreased opportunity to obtain [transition to the community], Rule 23(b)(2) is satisfied on the \ncurrent record.” Brown v. D.C., 928 F.3d 1070, 1083 (D.C. Cir. 2019). \n  7 \n\n \nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG  Document 129  Filed 09/20/23  Page 8 of 11 \nHere, too, the State makes a perfunctory argument that class certification is improper under \nRule 23(b)(2) because class members have different service needs.  The State posits that the \nnecessary injunctive relief would somehow involve too many directives among too many agencies \nand programs. ECF No. 108 at 26. But it is commonplace in Olmstead litigation for courts to \nenvision an appropriate single injunction and certify classes under Rule 23(b)(2) despite the usual \ncomplexity in state long-term service systems. For example, plaintiffs in Kenneth R. named two \nstate agency defendants, each overseeing its own service system, but the court showed no \nhesitation in finding the Rule 23(b)(2) requirements satisfied. 293 F.R.D. 254. The court wrote \nthat “injunctive relief prohibiting a discriminatory lack of community service options would . . . \nbenefit all class members.” Id. at 271. The service system in another Olmstead lawsuit, Lane v. \nKitzhaber, was also multi-faceted; the court’s description noted multiple relevant offices and \nwaiver programs.  283 F.R.D. at 592–94 (describing Oregon’s employment services system). \nNonetheless, the court found that the class action could be “resolved ‘in one stroke’ with an \nappropriate  injunction”  that  would  require  the  state  to  administer,  fund,  and  operate  its \nemployment services system in a way that did not relegate people to segregated settings. Id. at \n602. \nThe appropriateness of a single injunction to resolve Olmstead claims involving numerous \nprograms and benefits is not theoretical. When such cases are litigated to resolution, courts impose \ninjunctions that require program modifications that enable people to live in integrated settings and \navoid unnecessary institutionalization. See, e.g., United States v. Florida, No. 12-cv-60460, 2023 \nWL 4546188 (S.D. Fla. July 14, 2023). The backdrop underlying an injunction to comply with \nthe integration mandate is inevitably a service system comprising multiple offices and programs, \nbut that does not stymie the availability of appropriate injunctive relief. See, e.g., United States v. \n  8 \n\n \nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG  Document 129  Filed 09/20/23  Page 9 of 11 \nMississippi, 400 F. Supp. 3d 546, 548 (S.D. Miss. 2019) (observing the “complexity” and \n“enormity” of the state’s service system); United v. Mississippi, 3:16-cv-622, ECF No. 278 (S.D. \nMiss., Sept. 7, 2021) (issuing final remedial order). \nSettlement agreements and consent decrees in Olmstead litigation also demonstrate the \nfeasibility of a single court order to remedy the unnecessary segregation of a large group of people. \nSee, e.g., Rolland v. Patrick, 562 F. Supp. 2d 176 (D. Mass. 2008) (entering an agreement to \nincrease community-based placements for class members). In Lane v. Brown, for example, the \ncourt approved a settlement agreement to resolve the Olmstead class action that challenged \nOregon’s use of segregated employment settings known as sheltered workshops. 166 F. Supp. 3d \n1180 (D. Or. 2016). Plaintiffs, a class of people with intellectual or developmental disabilities, \nhad alleged that the state over-relied on sheltered workshops and failed to develop and adequately \nfund integrated employment services. Lane v. Brown, 3:12-cv-138, ECF No. 43 (D. Or. May 29, \n2012). To remedy the alleged unnecessary segregation, the court entered as an order the parties’ \nsettlement agreement, requiring the state to (1) create and implement policies and practices to \nfacilitate compliance with the ADA; (2) reduce reliance on sheltered workshops; and (3) ensure \nthat a significant portion of class members obtain jobs in integrated settings. 166 F. Supp. 3d at \n1189; Lane v. Brown, 3:12-cv-138, ECF No. 384 (D. Or. Jan. 27, 2016) (entering the court- \nenforceable settlement agreement as an order). \nAccordingly, it is possible for courts to issue an injunction that resolves Olmstead claims \nby  requiring  public  entities  to  provide  the  services  needed  to  remedy  unnecessary \ninstitutionalization. \n  9 \n\n \nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG  Document 129  Filed 09/20/23  Page 10 of 11 \nConclusion \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, the United States requests that the Court consider this Statement \nof Interest in this litigation. \n \n \nDated: September 20, 2023 \n \nFor the United States of America: \n \n/s/ Kristen Clarke   \nKRISTEN CLARKE \nAssistant Attorney General \nCivil Rights Division \n \nJENNIFER MATHIS \nDeputy Assistant Attorney General \nCivil Rights Division \n \nREBECCA B.

L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999).  Compl. ¶ 179.  According to the Complaint,  \nnamed  Plaintiffs are  current nursing facility residents  who qualify  for the Commonwealth’s  system \nof home- and community-based services and prefer to live in a more integrated setting.  Compl. ¶¶  \n1–2.   \nIn a partial motion to dismiss the claims of named Plaintiffs, Defendants argue  that the named  \nPlaintiffs do not  have  an injury in fact to support standing.  The Commonwealth’s motion  ignores  \nPlaintiffs’ allegations of  unnecessary segregation and leap-frogs  over the Olmstead  caselaw that  \nestablishes that unnecessary segregation is an injury  in  fact.  Instead, the  Defendants  try to narrow  \nPlaintiffs’  allegations to  denial of particular services  and  argue that those services must be requested  \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG  Document 132  Filed 09/28/23  Page 2 of 7 \nand refused for  the  Plaintiffs to have an injury in fact.  Even if Plaintiffs’ allegations  were this narrow,  \nno request and refusal is  required to establish standing to bring an ADA  claim.  \nThe United States of America  respectfully submits this  Statement of Interest under 28  \nU.S.C. § 517 to provide its view on the application of Title  II of the Americans with Disabilities  \nAct, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131–12134, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794.1.  \nSpecifically, the United States clarifies that unnecessary institutionalization is an injury  in  fact  \nunder the ADA and that standing to bring an Olmstead  claim does not require  Plaintiffs to request  \ncertain services.    \nArgument  \nThe first  flaw in the Defendants’ motion to dismiss  is the failure  to recognize that  \nunnecessary institutionalization is an injury  in  fact sufficient to establish Article III standing.   \nGiven  the  Supreme  Court’s  holding  that   “unjustified  institutional  isolation  of  persons  with  \ndisabilities is a form of discrimination,” 527 U.S. 581, 600 (1999) (plurality opinion), courts  \nregularly conclude that unnecessary institutionalization  or segregation constitutes an injury in fact.  \nE.g., Murphy  by  Murphy  v.  Minn. Dep’t  of  Hum.  Servs., 260 F. Supp. 3d 1084, 1100 (D. Minn.  \n2017)  (“Through the ADA and the R[ehabilitation]  A[ct], Congress has elevated the segregation \nof individuals with disabilities to the status of  a  legally cognizable injury.”  (internal quotation \nomitted)); see also Fisher v. Okla.  Health Care Auth., 335 F.3d 1175,  1181 (10th Cir. 2003)  \n(“[T]he ADA and its attendant regulations clearly define unnecessary segregation as  a form of  \nillegal discrimination against the disabled.”  (quoting Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d 325, 333 (3d \nCir.  1995))); Davis v. Shah, 821 F.3d 231, 263–64 (2d Cir. 2016) (holding that plaintiffs’ showing \nthat they were “at a substantial risk of requiring institutionalized care  . . . establishe[d]  an injury \nsufficient to carry  [their]  integration mandate claim”).   Here,  the Complaint plainly alleges that  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG  Document 132  Filed 09/28/23  Page 3 of 7 \nnamed Plaintiffs are institutionalized in nursing  facilities, but can and want to live and receive  \nservices in the community.  Compl. ¶¶  18–24 (each named Plaintiff has resided in a nursing facility \nfor at least 60 days); Compl.  ¶¶  124–73 (describing each named Plaintiff, including their desire  \nand ability to live in the  community with supports).  These are precisely the sort of  allegations of  \nunnecessary institutionalization that courts have found  sufficient to establish a specific, tangible  \nharm to meet the injury  in  fact requirement for Article III standing.   See  A.R.  v.  Dudek, No. 12-\n60460-CIV, 2014 WL 11531370, at *8 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 13, 2014)  (explaining that children with \ndisabilities have standing to bring a claim for unnecessary institutionalization based on the injury  \nof  institutionalization),  report   and   recommendation   adopted,   No.  12-60460-CIV,  2014  WL  \n11531887 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 29, 2014); Disability  Rts.  N.Y.  v.  New  York, No. 17-CV-6965-RRM-\nSJB, 2019 WL 2497907, at *13 (E.D.N.Y. June 14, 2019)  (holding that plaintiff who was  \ninstitutionalized in a residential school had “alleged sufficient  facts to  establish a concrete and  \nparticularized  ADA and Rehab[ilitation]  Act-based injury”).  \nIn response to  Plaintiffs’  allegations of unnecessary institutionalization, the Commonwealth  \nprops up arbitrary and  narrow injuries that it then knocks down as insufficiently concrete or  \nparticularized.  For example, the Commonwealth highlights allegations that  named Plaintiff, David  \nMarsters did not receive ancillary services or  specialized PASRR services  as an  example of how  \nPlaintiffs’ pleading fails to name  a  concrete injury.  ECF No. 109 at 11–12.   This argument ignores  \nthe Complaint’s  allegations  that Mr. Marsters lives  in a locked unit of  a nursing facility but  wants to \nlive  in a community residential setting and could  do so with support.  Compl. ¶¶ 138, 143.   The \nCommonwealth’s attempt  to narrowly frame  the injury  mirrors  an argument  rejected in  Murphy.  In  \nMurphy, a lawsuit brought by individuals with disabilities who wanted to live in a more integrated \nsetting, the state similarly misidentified the injury  as the  failure to provide a  certain service.   260 F.  \n3  \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG  Document 132  Filed 09/28/23  Page 4 of 7 \nSupp. 3d at 1100.  The district court  in Murphy  rejected that  argument: “The primary injury Plaintiffs  \nallege they are  facing is segregation. While perhaps not tangible, this injury  is indeed concrete and \nparticular to Plaintiffs.”   Id.  at 1101.  \nIn inaccurately framing the injury, the Commonwealth sets up a second legal error:  \nsuggesting that standing requires  Plaintiffs  to allege that they have applied for  certain  community-\nbased services.   To make this point, the  Commonwealth  also  attempts to define the injury as the  \ndenial of particular waiver services  and then argues that certain named Plaintiffs cannot claim an  \nactionable injury because they never applied for that waiver.  ECF No. 109 at 14–18.  But the  \nCommonwealth cites no case law  for the proposition that such a  request must be made to establish  \nan injury in fact.  Nor could it  because the law is to the contrary.  For example, in an Olmstead  \nlawsuit brought by nursing facility residents with mental illness,  the defendant  similarly  tried to  \nargue that the named plaintiffs had failed to allege an injury  in  fact because they had not applied \nfor community-based services.   State of Connecticut Off. of Prot.  and Advocacy v. Connecticut, \n706 F. Supp. 2d 266, 284 (D. Conn. 2010).   The court  squarely rejected the argument and held that  \nthe plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged that they suffered an injury in fact.  Id.    \nIn any event, a  request for such an accommodation is gratuitous when  there is an obvious  \nneed for an accommodation.  Kiman  v.  N.H.  Dep’t  of  Corr., 451 F.3d 274, 283 (1st  Cir. 2006)  \n(acknowledging that different rules apply when the need for an accommodation is obvious).  Such \nis  the  case  in   Olmstead   cases   because  public  entities  are  affirmatively  required  to  prevent \nunnecessary segregation.   See, e.g., United  States  v.  Florida, No. 12-CV-60460, 2023 WL  \n4546188, at *5 (S.D. Fla. July 14, 2023)  (explaining that the ADA imposes an affirmative  \nobligation to provide community treatment options if three  elements are  met); Haddad v. Arnold, \n784 F. Supp. 2d 1284, 1297–98 (M.D. Fla. 2010)  (plaintiff was likely to  succeed  on the merits  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG  Document 132  Filed 09/28/23  Page 5 of 7 \nbecause Florida had affirmative duty “[t]o avoid the discrimination  inherent in the unjustified  \nisolation of disabled persons” by making “reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and \nprocedures for services they elect to provide” (emphasis added)); Guggenberger  v.  Minnesota, 198  \nF. Supp. 3d 973, 1032  (D. Minn. 2016)  (“[T]he alleged discrimination—undue isolation—stems  \nfrom a failure to satisfy  an affirmative duty”); cf.  Toledo v.  Sanchez, 454  F.3d 24, 32 (1st Cir.  \n2006) (“Title II imposes an affirmative  obligation on public entities  to make their programs  \naccessible to qualified individuals with disabilities, except where  compliance would result in a  \nfundamental alteration of services or impose an undue burden.”).  So, when  plaintiffs in  Olmstead  \nlitigation  receive state disability services, the  state is  on actual notice of their disabilities and its  \nobligation to deliver services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.  See, e.g., \nOlmstead, 527 U.S. at 603 n.14 (“States must  adhere to the  ADA’s nondiscrimination requirement  \nwith regard  to the services they in fact provide.”).  It logically follows that individuals need not  \nrequest  community integration for that obligation to be triggered.    Indeed,  Olmstead  itself requires  \nonly that the affected persons “do not oppose” community placement—a standard clearly lower  \nthan requiring an affirmative and explicit request.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 602–03, 607. \nFinally, requiring Plaintiffs to request a specific service is particularly inappropriate where,  \nas here,  Plaintiffs allege  that the defendant public entity consistently fails  to provide them with  \ninformation  about available community-based services.  Compl. ¶¶ 11, 12, 97, 115, 120, 123, 181, \n187–188 (alleging that the Commonwealth routinely fails to provide Plaintiffs  with information \nabout community-based programs and services);  United States v. Florida, 2023 WL 4546188, at *32  \n(rejecting state’s  argument that parents  must make  a “formal request” for  community-based services  \nfor their disabled children and finding “a  widespread failure to affirmatively inform  families that  \nthey  have alternatives to placing their children in  a nursing facility”);  cf. Murphy, 260 F. Supp. 3d at  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG  Document 132  Filed 09/28/23  Page 6 of 7 \n1095–97, 1099–1100 (plaintiffs who alleged that the State  failed to provide them  with information  \nabout integrated service  options had standing).   \nConclusion  \nIn conclusion, it is well settled law that  unnecessary institutionalization is an injury  in  fact  \nunder the ADA and that standing to bring an Olmstead  claim does not require  Plaintiffs to request  \ncertain services.   The United States respectfully requests that the Court consider this Statement of  \nInterest in this litigation.  \nDated: September  28, 2023 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n \nJOSHUA  S.

This Order governs certain confidential information (defined in paragraph 3\nbelow) that may be produced for the review of counsel in discovery and/or in connection with\n1\n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 61   Filed 03/16/23   Page 2 of 13\nnegotiations, and/or may be filed with the Court, jn the matter ofS immons, et al. v.

The\nDefendants have reserved all rights to object to the production of Shared Data on any and all\navailable grounds.\n3.  The term \"Confidential Information\" as used herein means:\n(i) The full actual names of the individual Plaintiffs and/or members of the putative\nor any certified plaintiff class in the Action or their family members, and/or any derivatives\nof those names that would be sufficient to identify those individuals, insofar as the names or\nderivatives thereof are included in documents, records, written discovery (such as\ninterrogatories and requests for admissions) and responses thereto, and/or deposition\ntestimony;\n(ii) all images( whether photographs or videos) that depict the faces of the individual\nPlaintiffs and/or members of the putative or any certified plaintiff class or their family\nmembers;\n(iii) the fiill actual names( and/or any derivatives oft hose names that would be\nsufficient to identify individual persons) of residents of Massachusetts nursing facilities\n(\"NFs\")o r other persons who receive services fi\"om any of the above-named Defendant\nagencies (including members of MassHealth), regardless of whether they are or may be\nindividually named Plaintiffs or members of the putative or any certified class;\n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 61   Filed 03/16/23   Page 3 of 13\n(iv) all images (whether photographs or videos)t hat depict the faces of residents of\nNFs or other persons who receive services from any of the above-named defendant agencies\n(including recipients of MassHealth)r egardless of whether they are or may be individually\nnamed Plaintiffs or members of the putative or any certified class, except insofar as those\nimages have been previously published or disseminated to the public through government\npublications, news media, or otherwise;\n(v) with respect to MassHealth applicants and recipients in particular, to the extent\nthe following is associated or easily associated with individual persons:( I)t heir names and\nresidential addresses (not including names and addresses of NFs where they may reside),( 2)\nmedical services provided to them,( 3)t heir social and economic conditions or\ncircumstances,( 4) MassHealth's evaluation of their personal information,( 5) their medical\ndata, including diagnoses and past history of disease or disability,( 6)i nformation received\nby any agency for purposes of verifying their income eligibility and amoimt of medical\nassistance payments; and( 7) any information received in connection with the identification\nof legally liable third-party resources;\n(vi) all \"protected health information\"( \"PHI\")o f any person as described in the\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996( \"HIPAA\")a nd its\nimplementing regulations as promulgated at 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164( including 45 CFR\n§160.103), as well as all information protected as confidential under analogous provisions\nof Massachusetts law, including but not limited to M.G.L. c. 111, § 70, and regulations of\nMassHealth and the Department ofP ublic Health;\n(vii) all \"personal data,\" as defined in G.L. c. 66A,§  1, and incorporated by\nreference in 801 CMR 3.01(3), that is in the possession of the Executive Office for\n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 61   Filed 03/16/23   Page 4 of 13\nAdministration and Finance, the Executive Office of Health and Human Services, or any\nother agency listed in 801 CMR § 3.03(2), or any subdivision thereof, and which would be\nprotected from dissemination under 801 CMR § 3.03 if it were not disseminated pursuant to\nthe exceptions set forth in 801 CMR § 3.03(a) and( d)o r pursuant to any other provision of\n801 CMR 3.01, etseq.;\n(vii)\" personal information\" as defined in G.L. c. 93H,§  1; and\n(viii) all information listed in Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2(a).\n4.  The confidentiality of substance abuse disorder patient records is governed by\nfederal regulations found at 42 CFR Part 2( §§ 2A,et seq.), which regulations are promulgated by\nthe United States Secretary for Health and Human Services pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 290dd-2(g).\nFor the purposes used herein, in addition to the categories of Confidential Information described in\nPara. 3 above, the phrase \"Confidential Information\" includes \"Patient Identifying Information\" as\nthat term is defined in 42 CFR § 2.11 (which incorporates the definition of\" Patient\" set forth in that\nsame section)( hereinafter,\" SUD-PII\"). SUD-PII does not include a number assigned to a patient\nfor intemal use by a \"Part 2 Program,\" as defmed in 42 CFR §§ 2.11 & 2.12, if the number does not\nconsist of or contain numbers that could be used to identify a patient with reasonable accuracy from\nsources extemal to the Part 2 Program (such as social security or driver's license numbers).\n5.  No SUD-Pn may be supplied by the Defendants to Plaintiffs' counsel, pursuant to\ndiscovery requests or otherwise, unless and vmtil either:( i) each patient's consent has been obtained,\nconsistent with 42 CFR §§ 2.31-33, or (ii) the requirements of4 2 CFR §§ 2.64 & 2.66 have been\nmet by issuance of a Court order (separate from this Order) authorizing disclosure and use of SUD-\nPII on conditions consistent with all provisions of4 2 CFR §§ 2.64 & 2.66 (including a finding by\nthe Court that \"good cause\" exists for entry of the order, see 42 CFR § 2.64(d)). For purposes of\n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 61   Filed 03/16/23   Page 5 of 13\n§ 2.64(e)(3), any order authorizing disclosure and use of SUD-PII must require that, if documents\ncontaining SUD-PII are filed with the Court, the SUD-PII contained therein will be protected from\npublic disclosure by pre-filing redaction of the SUD-PII and/or an order permitting unredacted\nversions of the documents to be filed under seal.\n6.  This Protective Order shall serve as a \"qualified protective order\" under HIPAA and\nits implementing regulations, including but not limited to 45 C.F.R. § 164.512(e)(ii)(B),( e)(l)(i),\nand (e)(l)(v). Further, in the event any Party produces PHI to any opposing Party's coimsel, and\nwith all available objections to such production reserved, this Order \"expressly authorizes\" for\npurposes of HIPAA the disclosure of PHI in response to discovery requests in the above-\ncaptioned matter and/or in connection with confidential settlement discussions and/or\nconfidential altemative dispute resolution proceedings (such as mediation), pursuant to 45 CFR\n§ 164.512(e)(l)(i). To the extent formal discovery is taken from third parties in association with\nthe above-captioned matter, pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (such as Rules 30 &\n45), this Order shall also serve as a qualified protective order under HIPAA and the above-\nreferenced implementing regulations for purposes ofs uch third parties' responses to discovery.\n7.  Given the volume of Confidential Information likely to be relevant to the Action and\nthe time sensitive nature of responding to discovery requests under the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure, the Court hereby finds that notice to persons whose Confidential Information is\nproduced or disseminated pursuant to this Order in connection with litigation or settlement of the\nAction \"would probably so prejudice the administration ofjustice that good cause exists to delay or\ndispense with such notice\" for purposes of8 01 CMR § 3.03(a). Accordingly, this Order shall also\nserve as an order entered pursuant to 801 CMR § 3.03(a) to dispense with any requirement to\n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 61   Filed 03/16/23   Page 6 of 13\nprovide the notice described in G.L. c. 66A,§  2(k), either prior to or after such production or\ndissemination, for purposes of this Action only.\n8.  Subject to any contrary orders of this Court, any document, testimony, or other\nmaterial containing Confidential Information may be submitted to the Court publicly in a pleading\nother than the Complaint, filing, hearing, trial, or other proceeding in the Action so long as the\nConfidential Information set forth therein has been \"de-identified,\" such that it cannot be linked by\nmembers of the public with any living individual. This may be accomplished through: (i) redaction\nof names and other identifying information;( ii) use of one or more pseudonyms;( iii) use of first and\nlast initials where written consent of the person has been obtained and forwarded to counsel for all\nParties prior to the public disclosure of Confidential Information, which consent is hereby given by\ncounsel for the Plaintiffs with respect to the individual named plaintiffs; or( iv) any other way\nagreed upon by counsel for the Parties. Notwithstanding the requirements set forth herein, the\nperson who is the subject of such Confidential Information, or that person's legal guardian, may\nauthorize its use for any purpose. Additionally, and as an altemative to the procedures described\nabove. Confidential Information may be submitted to the Court under seal upon a motion allowed\nby the Court.\n9.  In addition to the requirements set forth in Paragraph 8 above, any Party publicly\nfiling documents containing Confidential Information must redact prior to filing all personal\nidentifying information described in:( i) G.L. c. 93H,§  1;( ii) Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2(a); and (iii) the\nDistrict of Massachusetts's Case Management/Electronic Case Files Administrative Procedures at\nPart N (pp. 14-15). Information that must be redacted from all documents publicly filed with the\nCourt includes (without limitation, and regardless of whether the document includes a name or part\nthereof of any individual): (i) social security numbers;( ii) driver's license numbers or state-issued\n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 61   Filed 03/16/23   Page 7 of 13\nidentification card numbers;( iii) full birth dates of individuals; and (iv)t he names of minor\nchildren. Notwithstanding that this Action is a civil matter and not a criminal case, street addresses\nof identified individuals shall also be redacted from public filings, but this requirement does not\ninclude redaction of the names and addresses of NFs where individually named Plaintiffs or other\nidentifiable persons reside. Further, the unmarried name of a person's parent or the former name of\na person's parent( where the parent's former name has been changed as a result of marriage or for\nany other reason) shall be redacted from public filings, except that a person's last name need not be\nredacted solely for the reason that they share a last name with their parent or grandparent.\nNotwithstanding the above, an identifiable or de-identified person's year of birth need not be\nredacted from a public filing.\n10.  Nothing contained herein requires any of the Plaintiffs or Defendants or their\ncounsel to redact any Confidential Information in any documents or materials prior to disclosure of\nthe documents or materials to counsel for another Party with an appearance in the Action-   whether\npursuant to formal discovery, informal discovery, or settlement discussions. Further, nothing\ncontained herein requires any of the Parties to designate any documents or materials produced\npursuant to this Order as \"Confidential,\" or to otherwise indicate to any recipient described in\nParagraph 12 infra that Confidential Information is present in the documents or materials. Once\ndocuments, testimony, or materials containing Confidential Information have been disclosed to\ncounsel for a Party under this Order, any Party seeking to use those documents, testimony, or\nmaterial in connection with any public event or public fling in the Action is solely responsible for\nreviewing the documents, testimony, or materials to identify Confidential Information and for\ncomplying with all provisions of this Order( and in particular. Paragraph 8 & 9)i ntended to keep\nsuch Confidential Information outside of the public view.\n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 61   Filed 03/16/23   Page 8 of 13\n11.  In the event that any Party to or witness in the Action is the subject of Confidential\nInformation and voluntarily discloses that Confidential Information through documents or materials\npublicly filed with the Court( whether or not through their counsel), or through the voluntary\nsubmission to the Court of testimony or declarations, or through representations or stipulations\nmade by their counsel in open Court, the Confidential Information that has been volxmtarily\ndisclosed will no longer be considered \"Confidential Information\" for purposes of live testimony in\nCourt. However, to the extent Confidential Information is publicly filed with the Court, through\nPacer or otherwise, the requirements ofP aragraphs 8 & 9 apply notwithstanding prior voluntary\ndisclosure of the same Confidential Information. Further, if any Confidential Information is\ninadvertently publicly disclosed or is improperly publicly disclosed without actual authorization of\nthe person who is the subject of the Confidential Information or that person's legal guardian, the\ncounsel responsible for the disclosure shall notify all other counsel of the same. Upon receipt of\nsuch notice, all counsel and Parties shall treat the subject information or material as Confidential\nInformation for all purposes under this Order, notwithstanding the inadvertent or improper prior\ndisclosure.\n12.  All documents, transcripts, and/or other materials that contain Confidential\nInformation shall be treated and maintained in a manner that precludes access by any person or\nentity not entitled to access Confidential Information under this Protective Order. Confidential\nInformation shall be disclosed only to the following persons/entities (except as provided in\nParagraphs 8,9,&   11 where the disclosure is in a public filing or during a public proceeding):\n(a) counsel and any firm/entity that has filed an appearance, including legal, paralegal,\nsecretarial, legal intem, and clerical personnel who are engaged in assisting such counsel\nin this matter;\n8\n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 61   Filed 03/16/23   Page 9 of 13\n(b) any investigator, outside expert, or consultant who is employed or engaged by counsel in\nthis litigation, and employees and assistants under the control ofs uch investigator,\nexpert, or consultant;\n(c) any employee of a party who is requested by counsel for such party to work directly on\nthis matter;\n(d) any deposition or trial witness;\n(e) any person who authored or originally received the Confidential Information sought to\nbe disclosed to that person;\n(f) any court or other reporter or typist recording or transcribing testimony;\n(g) the Court, its clerks, and court personnel;\n(h) any person designated by the Court in the interests ofjustice, upon such terms as the\nCourt deems proper.\n13.  Confidential Information shall not be disclosed to persons described in paragraphs\n12(a) through (e), above until such persons have been provided with a copy of this Order and have\nagreed to abide by and comply with the terms and provisions herein. Further, persons described in\nsubparagraphs 12(b) and (d)s upra shall also be required to execute a copy oft he Protective Order\nAgreement, attached hereto as Exhibit A.\n14.  In the event any of the Defendants to the Action or their counsel are the recipients of\nConfidential Information not previously within their possession, custody, or control that is disclosed\nto the Defendants or their coimsel pursuant to this Order, no such Confidential Information may be\nfiirther disclosed by the recipient of that Confidential Information in response to a request made\nunder the Massachusetts Public Records Law (M.G.L. c. 66,§  10)( \"PRL\"), absent an Order from\nthis Court permitting such disclosure, except insofar as the Confidential Information has already\n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 61   Filed 03/16/23   Page 10 of 13\nbeen publicly disclosed (through Court filing or otherwise). In considering whether to issue a\ndisclosure order in response to such a request, the Court will follow the approach outlined by the\nSupreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in Commonwealth v. Fremont Investment & Loan,4 59\nMass. 209( 2011). It shall be the responsibility of the recipient oft he PRL request to inform any\nrequester of this procedure where their PRL request may implicate this Order. Further, Confidential\nInformation produced or disclosed (and not received) by the Defendants pursuant to this Order will\nremain subject to the PRL to the same extent and in the same way such information it would\notherwise be subject to the PRL in the absence of any disclosure made pmsuant to this Order.\n15.  Confidential Information disclosed pursuant to this Order may not be used by the\nrecipient for any purpose other than the proceedings in the Action,i mless further disclosure is\nrequired by law or by Court order.\n16.  Any Party may apply to this Court for relief fi-om, enforcement of, and/or\nmodification of this Order, or for additional protective orders. In addition, the parties may mutually\nagree to seek a modification of this Order.\n17.  This Order shall not prevent any Party firom raising any available objection to the\nproduction or use of Confidential Information in the course of discovery or at trial, including,\nwithout limitation: (i) an objection that the material requested and/or Confidential Information\nincluded therein is beyond the scope of discovery pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1);( ii) an\nobjection that any request for production is overly broad, unduly burdensome, or oppressive for any\nreason, regardless of whether it contains Confidential Information; and (iii) an objection based on\nany privilege or qualified privilege, including a privilege or qualified privilege that pertains to\nConfidential Information.\n10\n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 61   Filed 03/16/23   Page 11 of 13\n18.  More specifically, the Defendants reserve (and do not waive)t he right to object to\nany discovery request insofar as it encompasses material or information that is the subject of a\nprivilege or qualified privilege under Fed.R.Evid. 501,i ncluding a qualified privilege based on a\nstatute or regulation conceming confidentiality or nondisclosure of materials or information (such\nas, without limitation, the various statutes described in Paragraphs 3-7,s upra).\n19.  Notwithstanding that this Order does not require any Party or their counsel to redact\nConfidential Information prior to production or disclosiue to counsel for another Party having an\nappearance in this Action, nothing herein shall prevent pre-disclosure redaction by the disclosing\nParty or their counsel for the purpose of effectuating an asserted discovery privilege.\n20.  Nothing herein, however, shall be construed as waiving any Party's right to object to\nobject to the admissibility in evidence of any information or material discovered or produced\npursuant to this Order.\n21.  In the event that formal discovery under the Rules of Federal Procedure is requested\nfi-om any third party in connection with this Action, by subpoena or otherwise, all terms oft his\nOrder shall apply to the third party's disclosure of Confidential Information in response to such\nrequest as if they were named above and referred to herein as a Party. Those terms include,\nhowever, the right set forth in Paragraph 16,s upra, to apply to this Court for relief fi\"om,\nenforcement of, and/or modification of this Order, and/or for additional protective orders.\n22.  This Order shall remain in full force and effect until modified, superseded, or\nterminated by order of the Court, or terminated by mutual consent of all parties, without regard to\nthe conclusion of this litigation or any subsequent appeals. All paper copies, as well as electronic\ncopies in e-discovery databases, of material including Confidential Information that has been\ndisclosed to counsel for a party pursuant to this Order must either be returned to the providing party\n11\n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 61   Filed 03/16/23   Page 12 of 13\nby the recipient party or destroyed by the recipient party when this litigation and all subsequent\nappeals conclude, as provided in 45 CFR § 164.512(e)(l)(v)(B). Counsel shall make best efforts to\nreturn or destroy all other electronic copies stored in any electronic file or electronic or web-based\nstorage system or database of materials that contain Confidential Information that has been\ndisclosed to them by counsel for another party pursuant to this Order.\n23.  Nothing in this Order shall preclude disclosure to persons who counsel for the\nparties believe in good faith to have, or have had, prior access to the Confidential Information\nbefore its disclosure pursuant to this Order.\nDated:  \\(d^'2-0'2^^  By  Court:\njtti-^7%arts  N  '6 >OA'T—,\nUnited States Distriet-Judge\n12\n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 61   Filed 03/16/23   Page 13 of 13\nEXfflBITA\nPROTECTIVE ORDER AGREEMENT\nI have read the Protective Order issued by the United States District Court for the District\nof Massachusetts in Simmons, et al. v.

Docket No. 42.2  Although the \nparties agree that entry of a protective order is necessary and have reached agreement on many \nterms, they are unable to agree on several provisions.  For the following reasons, this Court \nmakes the rulings below. \n \n \n1 Maura Healey, who is now the governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is substituted \nfor former governor Charles D. Baker as the defendant in this suit pursuant to Rule 25(d) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n2 On February 6, 2023, Judge Saris referred the motion to the undersigned.  Docket No. 48.   \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 58   Filed 03/07/23   Page 2 of 6\nI.  BACKGROUND  \n  Plaintiffs are persons with disabilities who have resided in nursing facilities in \nMassachusetts.  Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons, \nallege that the Defendants’ system of delivering long term care unnecessarily institutionalizes \nindividuals with disabilities, routinely segregates and isolates them from the community, and \nfails to provide timely access to existing community residential services and support programs.  \nSee generally Complaint at ¶¶ 1-13, 113-120.  Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants’ long term \ncare system violates the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, \nand the Medicaid Act and seek declaratory and injunctive relief.  Id. at ¶ 13 and Prayers for \nRelief.   \n  The parties have conferred and attempted to reach agreement on the scope of a stipulated \nprotective order governing the disclosure of confidential information in discovery.  Although \nthey have agreed on many terms, there remain areas of disagreement.  Specifically, they disagree \nregarding provisions governing (1) the disclosure of information subject to data-sharing \nagreements, (2) the disclosure of substance abuse disorder patient records, (3) methods of de-\nidentification to protect the confidentiality of class members, and (4) Defendants’ proposed non-\nwaiver language.   \nII.  ANALYSIS  \nA.  The Plaintiffs’ Original Proposal  \nThe Plaintiffs originally proposed a protective order that was based on one entered in \n2007 in another case against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  Docket No. 42-1.   The \nDefendants then proposed a different, more complex protective order.  Docket No. 42-2; see also \nDocket No. 42-3.  The Plaintiffs request that this Court adopt its original proposed protective \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 58   Filed 03/07/23   Page 3 of 6\norder.  Docket No. 43 at 5.  Nevertheless, they have, in the alternative, proposed changes to the \nDefendants’ form of protective order.  Docket No. 42-4.  In deciding between the competing \nproposals, this Court finds it appropriate to use as a starting point the Defendants’ January 27, \n2023 proposed form of protective order (Ex. 2B, Docket No. 42-3).   \nB.  Data Sharing Agreements (¶ 2)  \nThe Defendants represent that some of the discoverable confidential information in this \ncase may be subject to data sharing agreements between the Defendants and other state or local \nagencies or the federal government.  The Defendants’ version of the protective order would \nexempt such information from the protective order and would require further judicial \nintervention where a data-sharing agreement may be implicated.  See Docket No. 42-3 at ¶ 2.  \nThe Plaintiffs’ version, on the other hand, would make such information subject to the protective \norder while still allowing the Defendants to object to the disclosure of information subject to data \nsharing agreements.  The Plaintiffs’ approach minimizes the need for judicial intervention while \npreserving the Defendants’ right to object on the basis of data-sharing agreements with the \nfederal government.  The Plaintiffs’ proposal, however, allows Defendants to object on the basis \nof data sharing agreements with the federal government only.  The Defendants should be able to \nobject based on data sharing agreements between them and other state or local agencies.  \nTherefore, this Court adopts the Plaintiff’s proposal with respect to paragraph 2 but modified to \ninclude data sharing agreements between the Defendants and other state or local agencies.   \nC.  Substance Abuse Disorder Patient Records (¶ 5)  \nPlaintiffs argue that the protective order should include substance use disorder \ninformation as part of confidential information that may be disclosed subject to the protective \norder.  Docket No. 43 at 9-12.  I disagree.   \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 58   Filed 03/07/23   Page 4 of 6\n“In the interest of guaranteeing the efficacy of substance abuse treatment programs, \nCongress has directed that all substance abuse treatment records be kept confidential.”  United \nStates v. Shinderman, 515 F.3d 5, 11 (1st Cir. 2008) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 290dd-2(a)).  \nInformation contained in substance abuse records is divided into two categories: confidential and \nnon-confidential communications.  U.S. ex rel Chandler, v. Cook Cnty., Ill., 277 F.3d 969, 982 \n(2nd Cir. 2002).  In the absence of patient consent, confidential communications may be \ndisclosed by court order only if:  \n(1) The disclosure is necessary to protect against an existing threat to life or \nof serious bodily injury, including circumstances which constitute child \nabuse and neglect and verbal threats against third parties;  \n(2) The  disclosure  is  necessary  in  connection  with  investigation  or \nprosecution of an extremely serious crime, such as one which directly \nthreatens loss of life or serious bodily injury, including homicide, rape, \nkidnapping, armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, or child \nabuse and neglect; or  \n(3) The disclosure is in connection with litigation or an administrative \nproceeding in which the patient offers testimony or other evidence \npertaining to the content of the confidential communications.   \n \n42 C.F.R. § 2.63(a).  “Absent one of the enumerated exceptions, a court may not order disclosure \nof a patients’ confidential communications, even if the party seeking the communications \nestablishes good cause and needs to use the protected records to prove its case.”  U.S. ex rel. \nGelfand v. Special Care Hosp. Mgmt. Corp., No. CV 02-6079(LDW)(ETB), 2010 WL 2399693, \nat *3 (E.D.N.Y. June 10, 2010) (citations omitted).  “[T]he regulations place the need for \nconfidentiality to assure successful [substance abuse] treatment above a party’s evidentiary \nneeds, even if that information is of vital importance to the party.”  Id.  Therefore, some courts \nhave rejected the argument that disclosure of confidential communications is allowed where \npatient identifying information has been redacted.  See id.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 58   Filed 03/07/23   Page 5 of 6\n  A court may order disclosure of non-confidential communications upon a finding of good \ncause.  See 42 C.F.R. § 2.64(d).  Specifically, the court must find that: “[o]ther ways of obtaining \nthe information are not available or would not be effective” and “[t]he public interest and need \nfor the disclosure outweigh the potential injury to the patient, the physician-patient relationship \nand the treatment services.”  Id.  The patient must be given notice of a person’s application to \nobtain the patient’s substance use disorder records and an opportunity to file a response to the \napplication.  See 42 C.F.R. § 2.64(b).   \n  Therefore, an order allowing for the disclosure of substance use disorder records requires \nspecific findings that this Court is unable to make in the context of a blanket protective order.3  \nRather, such findings are better made in the context of specific discovery requests.  Accordingly, \nthis Court adopts the Defendants’ proposal with respect to paragraph 5.   \nD.  Methods Of De-Identification (¶ 8) \nThe parties disagree as to the proper method of de-identifying class members and \nprotecting their confidentiality.  The Defendants’ proposal is unnecessarily complicated.  \nAccordingly, this Court adopts the Plaintiffs’ proposal with respect to paragraph 8. \nE.  Defendants’ Non-Waiver Language (¶¶ 17-19) \n    The Defendants have proposed several provisions preserving their right to object to the \nproduction of materials on substantive grounds.  See Docket No. 42-3 at ¶¶ 17-19.  Defendants \ncorrectly point out that while they have agreed that it is appropriate to facilitate the production of \nconfidential information through the adoption of a protective order, they should still be allowed \nto assert any substantive objections they have to the discovery of such information, including \n \n3 Plaintiffs argue that specific findings are not necessary given language in 42 U.S.C. § 290dd-2 \nand that this Court can issue a blanket order.  Docket No. 43 at 10.   \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 58   Filed 03/07/23   Page 6 of 6\nmatters such as privilege.  See Docket No. 44 at 14.  The language proposed by the Defendants, \nhowever, is too broad and runs the risk of frustrating the purpose of the protective order by \nproviding a defense to production solely on the basis that the information is confidential.  For \nexample, Defendants’ proposed paragraph 17 provides that a party may object to the production \nor use of confidential information on the grounds that it is “overly broad, unduly burdensome, or \noppressive for any reason, including that it contains Confidential Information.”  Docket No. 42-3 \nat ¶ 17 (emphasis added).  It also attempts to adopt specific legal analysis that the Defendants \ncontend ought to govern objections based on qualified privilege.  See id. at ¶ 18.  The Plaintiffs’ \nproposal, on the other hand, preserves the Defendants’ right to object to discovery requests on \nsubstantive grounds, including qualified privileges, without frustrating the purpose of the \nprotective order or making rulings about the specific legal analysis applicable to such objections.  \nAccordingly, this Court adopts the Plaintiffs’ proposals with respect to paragraphs 17 to 19.   \n  Within one week, the parties shall file a proposed stipulated protective order consistent \nwith this opinion. \n  So Ordered.   \n                 /s/ Jennifer C.

Mem.”) at 2, n.1. Defendants’ counsel \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 36   Filed 12/15/22   Page 2 of 10\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure (“Federal Rules”) and the Local Rules for the District of \nMassachusetts (“Local Rules”), would unfairly prejudice the Defendants, and is neither \nnecessary nor appropriate.  \nI.  Class Discovery at This Stage Is Premature and Is Not Normally Authorized \nUnder the Federal and Local Rules  \n \n  Plaintiffs’ request to open discovery at this early date, before Defendants have even filed \na response to the Complaint and well in advance of the parties’ deadline to confer about a \ndiscovery plan pursuant to Federal Rule 26(f), is premature. \n  The Federal Rules and the Local Rules lay out an orderly progression of events leading to \ndiscovery. Federal Rule 16 provides for pretrial conferences for purposes that include setting a \nscheduling order that addresses the timing and extent of discovery. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(a), (b), \n& (c). The Local Rules provide that a Rule 16 conference largely focused on setting a discovery \nschedule “shall” be convened in most cases. Local Rule (“L.R.”) 16.1(a). Federal Rule 26(f) \nrequires the parties to confer “as soon as practicable” and “in any event at least 21 days before a \nscheduling conference is to be held or a scheduling order is due under Rule 16(b).” Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 26(f)(1). The Local Rules also require the parties to convene their Rule 26(f) conference at \nleast 21 days before the Court holds the Rule 16(b) conference. See L.R. 16.1. At that meeting, \ncounsel are instructed to “prepar[e] a proposed pretrial schedule for the case that includes a plan \nfor discovery.” L.R. 16.1(b)(2). Further, seven days before the scheduling conference, the parties \nmust submit a joint statement that includes a “joint discovery plan scheduling the time and length \nfor all discovery events.” L.R. 16.1(d)(1). Following the scheduling conference, the Court “shall \n \nhas, at all relevant times, acknowledged that class discovery is likely to be necessary at some \npoint in this case, but they have opposed early discovery for reasons that are stated herein.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 36   Filed 12/15/22   Page 3 of 10\nenter a scheduling order that will govern the pretrial phase of the case,” including discovery \ndeadlines. See L.R. 16.1(f).   \nHere, the Defendants have not yet responded to the Complaint and no date for a Rule \n16(b) scheduling conference has been set.2 Thus, the deadline for the parties to confer pursuant \nto Rule 26(f) and to propose a discovery plan – including the possibility of bifurcated discovery \nto include a phase of pre-certification class discovery – has not yet occurred. Plaintiffs are \ntherefore not entitled under the Federal Rules to propound discovery requests at this time unless \nordered by the Court. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(d)(1) (subject to exception not applicable here, party \n“may not seek discovery from any source before the parties have conferred as required by Rule \n26(f), except . . . when authorized by these rules, stipulation, or by court order”).   \n  None of the cases cited in Plaintiffs’ memorandum suggest that the Court should take the \nunusual step of ordering early class discovery in this case, well before a Rule 26(f) conference \nhas been held. The cases within the First Circuit on which Plaintiffs purport to rely, Pl. Mem. at \n7-8, do not involve requests for class discovery made prior to the Defendants’ responsive \npleading deadline or the Court’s Rule 16 scheduling conference. See Lawson v. FMR LLC, 554 \nF. Supp. 3d 186, 192 (D. Mass. 2021) (allowing motion to dismiss before class certification was \naddressed); Smilow v. Sw. Bell Mobile Sys., Inc., 323 F.3d 32, 41 (1st Cir. 2003) (reversing an \norder entered several years after the filing of the lawsuit that decertified a class and denied a \nmotion to substitute a new class representative); China Agritech, Inc. v. Resh, 138 S. Ct. 1800, \n \n2   The parties jointly moved at the outset of the case for a scheduling order including a \nrequirement that the Defendants respond to the Complaint on or before December 16, 2022; that \nmotion was allowed. See ECF Nos. 27 & 29. Earlier this week, the Defendants filed an \nunopposed motion for a further extension through January 16, 2022. See ECF No. 34.  The \nDefendants’ motion for a further extension was allowed on December 13, 2022.  See ECF No. \n35. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 36   Filed 12/15/22   Page 4 of 10\n1804 (2018) (dismissing follow-on class action filed past the expiration of a statute of \nlimitations); Tigges v. AM Pizza, Inc., Civ. Action Nos. 16-10136-WGY, 16-10474-WGY, 2016 \nWL 4076829, at *1 (D. Mass. July 29, 2016) (granting motion for class certification and denying \nmotion to dismiss). At most, these cases repeat the non-controversial principle derived from the \nFederal Rules that class certification should be decided at “an early practicable time.” Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(c)(1)(A). But, as discussed in greater detail below, commencing discovery now, \nbefore the parties have even conferred on a discovery plan, is not “practicable” and would \nunfairly prejudice the Defendants.  \nII.  Class Discovery at This Stage Would Unfairly Prejudice the Defendants \n  Plaintiffs’ request for an early opening of discovery is not only inconsistent with \nprocedural rules, it would also be prejudicial to the Defendants. It is unreasonable and \nimpracticable to place on the Defendants the burden of responding to a lengthy Complaint while, \nat the same time, responding to discovery – especially the extensive and overbroad discovery \ncontemplated by the Plaintiffs in the proposed First Set of Requests for Production attached to \nthe Plaintiffs’ motion as Exhibit 4. ECF No. 32-4; see Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1) (providing that \nscope of discovery must be tailored to “the parties’ resources” and “burden or expense of the \nproposed discovery”).  \n  The Federal and Local Rules anticipate initiation of discovery after the Rule 16(b) \nscheduling conference for good reason: to allow the orderly proceeding of the case, taking into \naccount the positions of the parties as to a reasonable and achievable schedule for each stage of \nthe litigation, and only after the parties have conferred regarding a discovery plan. The Court’s \nbroad discretion in managing pre-trial litigation includes ample authority to insist that the parties \nconduct pre-trial discovery in an orderly way, in accordance with the applicable rules. See \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 36   Filed 12/15/22   Page 5 of 10\nSerrano-Perez v. FMC Corp., 985 F.2d 625, 628 (1st Cir. 1993) (“The broad measure of \ndiscretion enjoyed by the district courts in managing the litigation before it includes the control \nof pre-trial discovery.”) \n  Here, the Defendants are diligently working to prepare and file a response to a Complaint \nthat cannot reasonably be called a “short and plain statement” of the Plaintiffs’ claims. See Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The Plaintiffs’ 60-page pleading asserts four statutory claims for relief on \nbehalf of a putative class, and a fifth claim for relief on behalf of a putative sub-class, related to \nthe Commonwealth’s administration of benefits for adults with certain disabilities who are in \nneed of long-term care. See ECF No. 1. The Complaint includes 214 paragraphs of allegations \nagainst five state agencies and seeks, among other things, certification of a class and sub-class, \ndeclaratory judgments, and sweeping permanent injunctive relief. See id.  \n  The Defendants require sufficient time to make a reasonable inquiry into the Plaintiffs’ \nvoluminous factual claims while, at the same time, reviewing the law asserted in a Complaint \nrife with legal conclusions. See, e.g., ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 44-70. Further, counsel for the Defendants \nmust coordinate a response on behalf of multiple State agencies and provide reasonable time for \nsufficient review of the Defendants’ responsive pleading. Forcing the Defendants to \nsimultaneously respond at this early stage to the Plaintiffs’ discovery requests would hinder \nrather than assist the orderly progression of this litigation.3 \n \n3  The discovery sought also implicates health and personal information that is subject to \nvarious state and federal privacy protections. As the Plaintiffs acknowledge, the parties are \nactively negotiating the provisions of a protective order to ensure the confidentiality of all health \nand personal information. Pl. Mem. at 2, n.2. Defendants’ counsel are working diligently to \nidentify all relevant state and federal privacy provisions, as well as to determine the extent to \nwhich they can be addressed through a protective order (including any limitations thereon). This \nresearch takes considerable time and attention and the resulting proposals as to the protective \norder will need to be negotiated with Plaintiffs’ counsel before any discovery responses \nincluding health and personal information can be produced. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 36   Filed 12/15/22   Page 6 of 10\nIII.  Early Discovery Is Neither Necessary nor Appropriate in This Case \n \n  The Plaintiffs’ assertion that early class discovery is “necessary” and “appropriate” in this \ncase, Pl. Mem. at 5, is based entirely on two allegations, neither of which support the Plaintiffs’ \nrequest. First, the Plaintiffs claim that the Defendants have adopted a litigation strategy of \n“picking off” the named individual Plaintiffs by mooting their claims so as to block certification \nof a class. See Pl. Mem. at 5-7. But as explained below, that claim is entirely speculative. \nSecond, the Plaintiffs claim that the Defendants have been improperly objecting to a set of \nrequests for documents or data made by Plaintiffs’ counsel under the Commonwealth’s Public \nRecords Law, G.L. c. 66, § 10 (“PRL”). See Pl. Mem. at 8-10. This second argument improperly \ninvites the Court to opine on a matter of state law in a pending administrative matter that is not \nand cannot be brought before this Court. In short, neither allegation in the Plaintiffs’ motion is a \nvalid basis for the unusual early discovery that they request. Cf. Higgins v. Huhtamaki, Inc., \nNo. 1:21-CV-00369-NT, 2022 WL 523344, at *1, n.3 (D. Me. Feb. 21, 2022) (“Even though the \ncurrent version of [the Federal] [R]ules ‘does not say so, it is implicit that some showing of good \ncause should be made to justify’ an order permitting early discovery.” (citing 8A Richard L. \nMarcus, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2046.1)). \nA.  Defendants’ Litigation Strategy \nThe Plaintiffs, in the affidavits submitted in support of their motion, ECF Nos. 32-1, 32-\n2, set forth a series of innocuous facts related to recent contacts between employees of various \nState agencies, on the one hand, and, on the other, Plaintiff David Marsters, his sister, and Sara \nSpooner, the Guardian to five of the individually named Plaintiffs. From those facts, the \nPlaintiffs surmise an intent on the part of the Defendants to engage in a strategy of deliberately \nmooting the claims of potential class representatives so as to avoid certification of a class. The \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 36   Filed 12/15/22   Page 7 of 10\nPlaintiffs’ assertions ignore, however, that the Defendants are represented by counsel who have \npursued no such goal. It is the Defendants’ counsel — and not State agency employees — who \nare responsible for developing a litigation strategy in this case. And Defendants’ counsel have \nnot filed any motion grounded in assertions of mootness. Further, prior to filing the instant \nmotion, Plaintiffs’ counsel did not offer Defendants’ counsel a reasonable opportunity to discuss \nthe possibility that there may be mutually agreeable ways to address their concern. In short, the \nPlaintiffs’ assumptions about the Defendants’ counsel’s litigation strategy do not provide a \nsufficient basis for their premature request for class discovery. \nB.  The Plaintiffs’ PRL Request \n  The Plaintiffs also attach an affidavit concerning a public records request made by \nPlaintiffs’ counsel prior to the start of this litigation for certain information related to nursing \nfacility admissions. ECF No. 32-3. But the Plaintiffs’ separate and distinct efforts to obtain \ninformation through the State’s PRL should have no bearing on the timing and scope of \ndiscovery in this litigation. \n  Plaintiffs’ PRL request cannot be addressed or resolved in this Court. The PRL lays out \nan administrative process, including both administrative and judicial appeals in state courts, for \nrequesters who are unsatisfied with the response of an agency to a PRL request. See G.L. c. 66, \n§ 10(b)(ix). Indeed, the Plaintiffs have taken advantage of their available recourse under the PRL \nby submitting a letter requesting relief to the Supervisor of Records this week, on December 14, \n2022. As the Plaintiffs know, this Court is not the appropriate forum for consideration of the \nmerits of the agency’s response to the Plaintiffs’ PRL request. Id.; see also Fast Enterprises, \nLLC v. Pollack, No. 16-CV-12149-ADB, 2018 WL 4539685, at *4 (D. Mass.

In any \ncase, the materials sought in the PRL request and those that Plaintiffs propose to request in the \nRule 34 requests attached to their motion are not the same.

Thus, the \nPlaintiffs’ PRL request seeks information quite different from the material the Plaintiffs wish to \ndiscover through the instant motion, and is wholly irrelevant to the question whether the \nPlaintiffs should be permitted to commence early discovery. \nIV.  Conclusion \n  Counsel for the Defendants fully intend to participate appropriately in developing a \ndiscovery plan in accordance with Federal Rule 26(f) that will address the timing and scope of \nany necessary class discovery. However, it is both impracticable and unusual for the Plaintiffs to \nengage in class discovery before the Defendants have even filed a responsive pleading and \nbefore the parties have conferred to develop a discovery plan in advance of a Rule 16 scheduling \nconference.

Mem.”) at 2, n.1. Defendants’ counsel \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 36   Filed 12/15/22   Page 2 of 10\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure (“Federal Rules”) and the Local Rules for the District of \nMassachusetts (“Local Rules”), would unfairly prejudice the Defendants, and is neither \nnecessary nor appropriate.  \nI.  Class Discovery at This Stage Is Premature and Is Not Normally Authorized \nUnder the Federal and Local Rules  \n \n  Plaintiffs’ request to open discovery at this early date, before Defendants have even filed \na response to the Complaint and well in advance of the parties’ deadline to confer about a \ndiscovery plan pursuant to Federal Rule 26(f), is premature. \n  The Federal Rules and the Local Rules lay out an orderly progression of events leading to \ndiscovery. Federal Rule 16 provides for pretrial conferences for purposes that include setting a \nscheduling order that addresses the timing and extent of discovery. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(a), (b), \n& (c). The Local Rules provide that a Rule 16 conference largely focused on setting a discovery \nschedule “shall” be convened in most cases. Local Rule (“L.R.”) 16.1(a). Federal Rule 26(f) \nrequires the parties to confer “as soon as practicable” and “in any event at least 21 days before a \nscheduling conference is to be held or a scheduling order is due under Rule 16(b).” Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 26(f)(1). The Local Rules also require the parties to convene their Rule 26(f) conference at \nleast 21 days before the Court holds the Rule 16(b) conference. See L.R. 16.1. At that meeting, \ncounsel are instructed to “prepar[e] a proposed pretrial schedule for the case that includes a plan \nfor discovery.” L.R. 16.1(b)(2). Further, seven days before the scheduling conference, the parties \nmust submit a joint statement that includes a “joint discovery plan scheduling the time and length \nfor all discovery events.” L.R. 16.1(d)(1). Following the scheduling conference, the Court “shall \n \nhas, at all relevant times, acknowledged that class discovery is likely to be necessary at some \npoint in this case, but they have opposed early discovery for reasons that are stated herein.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 36   Filed 12/15/22   Page 3 of 10\nenter a scheduling order that will govern the pretrial phase of the case,” including discovery \ndeadlines. See L.R. 16.1(f).   \nHere, the Defendants have not yet responded to the Complaint and no date for a Rule \n16(b) scheduling conference has been set.2 Thus, the deadline for the parties to confer pursuant \nto Rule 26(f) and to propose a discovery plan – including the possibility of bifurcated discovery \nto include a phase of pre-certification class discovery – has not yet occurred. Plaintiffs are \ntherefore not entitled under the Federal Rules to propound discovery requests at this time unless \nordered by the Court. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(d)(1) (subject to exception not applicable here, party \n“may not seek discovery from any source before the parties have conferred as required by Rule \n26(f), except . . . when authorized by these rules, stipulation, or by court order”).   \n  None of the cases cited in Plaintiffs’ memorandum suggest that the Court should take the \nunusual step of ordering early class discovery in this case, well before a Rule 26(f) conference \nhas been held. The cases within the First Circuit on which Plaintiffs purport to rely, Pl. Mem. at \n7-8, do not involve requests for class discovery made prior to the Defendants’ responsive \npleading deadline or the Court’s Rule 16 scheduling conference. See Lawson v. FMR LLC, 554 \nF. Supp. 3d 186, 192 (D. Mass. 2021) (allowing motion to dismiss before class certification was \naddressed); Smilow v. Sw. Bell Mobile Sys., Inc., 323 F.3d 32, 41 (1st Cir. 2003) (reversing an \norder entered several years after the filing of the lawsuit that decertified a class and denied a \nmotion to substitute a new class representative); China Agritech, Inc. v. Resh, 138 S. Ct. 1800, \n \n2   The parties jointly moved at the outset of the case for a scheduling order including a \nrequirement that the Defendants respond to the Complaint on or before December 16, 2022; that \nmotion was allowed. See ECF Nos. 27 & 29. Earlier this week, the Defendants filed an \nunopposed motion for a further extension through January 16, 2022. See ECF No. 34.  The \nDefendants’ motion for a further extension was allowed on December 13, 2022.  See ECF No. \n35. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 36   Filed 12/15/22   Page 4 of 10\n1804 (2018) (dismissing follow-on class action filed past the expiration of a statute of \nlimitations); Tigges v. AM Pizza, Inc., Civ. Action Nos. 16-10136-WGY, 16-10474-WGY, 2016 \nWL 4076829, at *1 (D. Mass. July 29, 2016) (granting motion for class certification and denying \nmotion to dismiss). At most, these cases repeat the non-controversial principle derived from the \nFederal Rules that class certification should be decided at “an early practicable time.” Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(c)(1)(A). But, as discussed in greater detail below, commencing discovery now, \nbefore the parties have even conferred on a discovery plan, is not “practicable” and would \nunfairly prejudice the Defendants.  \nII.  Class Discovery at This Stage Would Unfairly Prejudice the Defendants \n  Plaintiffs’ request for an early opening of discovery is not only inconsistent with \nprocedural rules, it would also be prejudicial to the Defendants. It is unreasonable and \nimpracticable to place on the Defendants the burden of responding to a lengthy Complaint while, \nat the same time, responding to discovery – especially the extensive and overbroad discovery \ncontemplated by the Plaintiffs in the proposed First Set of Requests for Production attached to \nthe Plaintiffs’ motion as Exhibit 4. ECF No. 32-4; see Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1) (providing that \nscope of discovery must be tailored to “the parties’ resources” and “burden or expense of the \nproposed discovery”).  \n  The Federal and Local Rules anticipate initiation of discovery after the Rule 16(b) \nscheduling conference for good reason: to allow the orderly proceeding of the case, taking into \naccount the positions of the parties as to a reasonable and achievable schedule for each stage of \nthe litigation, and only after the parties have conferred regarding a discovery plan. The Court’s \nbroad discretion in managing pre-trial litigation includes ample authority to insist that the parties \nconduct pre-trial discovery in an orderly way, in accordance with the applicable rules. See \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 36   Filed 12/15/22   Page 5 of 10\nSerrano-Perez v. FMC Corp., 985 F.2d 625, 628 (1st Cir. 1993) (“The broad measure of \ndiscretion enjoyed by the district courts in managing the litigation before it includes the control \nof pre-trial discovery.”) \n  Here, the Defendants are diligently working to prepare and file a response to a Complaint \nthat cannot reasonably be called a “short and plain statement” of the Plaintiffs’ claims. See Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The Plaintiffs’ 60-page pleading asserts four statutory claims for relief on \nbehalf of a putative class, and a fifth claim for relief on behalf of a putative sub-class, related to \nthe Commonwealth’s administration of benefits for adults with certain disabilities who are in \nneed of long-term care. See ECF No. 1. The Complaint includes 214 paragraphs of allegations \nagainst five state agencies and seeks, among other things, certification of a class and sub-class, \ndeclaratory judgments, and sweeping permanent injunctive relief. See id.  \n  The Defendants require sufficient time to make a reasonable inquiry into the Plaintiffs’ \nvoluminous factual claims while, at the same time, reviewing the law asserted in a Complaint \nrife with legal conclusions. See, e.g., ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 44-70. Further, counsel for the Defendants \nmust coordinate a response on behalf of multiple State agencies and provide reasonable time for \nsufficient review of the Defendants’ responsive pleading. Forcing the Defendants to \nsimultaneously respond at this early stage to the Plaintiffs’ discovery requests would hinder \nrather than assist the orderly progression of this litigation.3 \n \n3  The discovery sought also implicates health and personal information that is subject to \nvarious state and federal privacy protections. As the Plaintiffs acknowledge, the parties are \nactively negotiating the provisions of a protective order to ensure the confidentiality of all health \nand personal information. Pl. Mem. at 2, n.2. Defendants’ counsel are working diligently to \nidentify all relevant state and federal privacy provisions, as well as to determine the extent to \nwhich they can be addressed through a protective order (including any limitations thereon). This \nresearch takes considerable time and attention and the resulting proposals as to the protective \norder will need to be negotiated with Plaintiffs’ counsel before any discovery responses \nincluding health and personal information can be produced. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-PBS   Document 36   Filed 12/15/22   Page 6 of 10\nIII.  Early Discovery Is Neither Necessary nor Appropriate in This Case \n \n  The Plaintiffs’ assertion that early class discovery is “necessary” and “appropriate” in this \ncase, Pl. Mem. at 5, is based entirely on two allegations, neither of which support the Plaintiffs’ \nrequest. First, the Plaintiffs claim that the Defendants have adopted a litigation strategy of \n“picking off” the named individual Plaintiffs by mooting their claims so as to block certification \nof a class. See Pl. Mem. at 5-7. But as explained below, that claim is entirely speculative. \nSecond, the Plaintiffs claim that the Defendants have been improperly objecting to a set of \nrequests for documents or data made by Plaintiffs’ counsel under the Commonwealth’s Public \nRecords Law, G.L. c. 66, § 10 (“PRL”). See Pl. Mem. at 8-10. This second argument improperly \ninvites the Court to opine on a matter of state law in a pending administrative matter that is not \nand cannot be brought before this Court. In short, neither allegation in the Plaintiffs’ motion is a \nvalid basis for the unusual early discovery that they request. Cf. Higgins v. Huhtamaki, Inc., \nNo. 1:21-CV-00369-NT, 2022 WL 523344, at *1, n.3 (D. Me. Feb. 21, 2022) (“Even though the \ncurrent version of [the Federal] [R]ules ‘does not say so, it is implicit that some showing of good \ncause should be made to justify’ an order permitting early discovery.” (citing 8A Richard L. \nMarcus, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2046.1)). \nA.

In short, the \nPlaintiffs’ assumptions about the Defendants’ counsel’s litigation strategy do not provide a \nsufficient basis for their premature request for class discovery. \nB.  The Plaintiffs’ PRL Request \n  The Plaintiffs also attach an affidavit concerning a public records request made by \nPlaintiffs’ counsel prior to the start of this litigation for certain information related to nursing \nfacility admissions.

INTRODUCTION  \n1.  John Simmons, David Marsters, Lorraine Simpson, Sherri Currin, Carole \nChojnacki, Richard Caouette, and Donald Grant are persons with disabilities, including older \nadults with disabilities, who are languishing and often deteriorating in segregated nursing \nfacilities when they could be thriving in integrated community settings.  Each prefers to reside in \n1 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 2 of 61\na more integrated residential setting, where they can live more independently, be closer to family \nand friends, and participate in community activities.  Federal law, including the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504), \nprovides that they be given the opportunity to reside in such settings: “the unjustified segregation \nof disabled individuals in institutions is a form of disability discrimination barred by federal \nlaw.”  Brown v. District of Columbia, 928 F.3d 1070, 1072 (D.C. Cir. 2019).  Yet these \nindividuals, and thousands of other similarly situated persons with disabilities, including \nmembers of Massachusetts Senior Action Council, are needlessly and illegally institutionalized \nand segregated in nursing facilities in Massachusetts. The individual plaintiffs and similarly \nsituated persons with disabilities qualify for the defendants’ system of Home and Community \nBased Services (HCBS), which provides residential and other support services in the community, \nbut that system fails to provide adequate and appropriate residential services to all qualified \npersons.   \n2.  Nursing facilities are segregated residential settings.  Unnecessary segregation in \nnursing facilities is also dangerous.  Living in segregated facilities has been linked to accelerated \nmental, emotional, and physical decline.  Further, over the past two and a half years during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, persons with disabilities in nursing facilities have suffered unique \ndeprivations, including a serious risk of harm and death, and for a significant time were deprived \nof almost all contact with loved ones and friends.  They died at an alarming rate: one in every \nseven residents of nursing facilities in Massachusetts succumbed in the COVID-19 pandemic, \nwhich is one of the highest mortality rates in the country.  At one point, nearly 66% of all deaths \nin Massachusetts involved persons with disabilities who lived in nursing facilities and other \n2 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 3 of 61\nsegregated long-term care settings.  In just the first six months of the pandemic, over 6,400 \nMassachusetts residents died in long-term institutions like nursing facilities. \n3.  COVID-19 has highlighted the inequities in healthcare and the limited choices \nlow-income people of color have regarding long-term care.  As a result, they are more likely to \nlive in low-performing and under-resourced nursing facilities.  Nursing facilities with higher \nnumbers of non-white residents have experienced higher levels of death from COVID-19.  \n4.  Being institutionalized in a nursing facility has long resulted in the denial of basic \nrights and other deprivations, including segregation, congregation, and isolation.  Many of the \nindividual plaintiffs have spent years in these institutions, isolated from their families and \nfriends.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, this isolation has at times become complete \ndeprivation of face-to-face contact with the world outside of the institution.   \n5.  People with disabilities in nursing facilities are routinely subjected to a regimen \noften dictated by the needs of the institutions, with little to no control over basic choices, such as \nwhen to eat, when to go to bed, or what to do during the day.  They rarely or never leave the \nnursing facility to return to their homes and communities, and almost never attend social, \nrecreational, and religious activities of their choosing outside of the facility.  \n6.  The hardships of institutionalization are most acutely felt by people of color, who \nfare poorly in nursing facilities compared to white residents.  For example, Black residents \nexperience increased physical restraints, indwelling catheters, and psychotropic medications as \ncompared to white residents. Similarly, they are more likely to have untreated or undertreated \npain.  \n7.  Overall, persons with disabilities live restricted and often lonely lives in nursing \nfacilities in order to access the Medicaid-funded services they need, even though the defendants \n3 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 4 of 61\ncould, and must, provide the same or comparable residential and support services to them in \nintegrated settings in the community.   \n8.  Virtually all the nursing and support services provided in a nursing facility can be \nprovided in the community through the Commonwealth’s HCBS programs.  In fact, persons \neligible for these waiver programs must need the level of care provided in nursing facilities.   \n9.  Notably, as a result of prior litigation settlements, the defendants use Medicaid \nfunding to promptly provide needed residential services and support to other populations, \nincluding persons with intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDD) or acquired brain injuries \n(ABI).  In other words, the Commonwealth knows how to provide appropriate remedies for its \nillegal segregation of people with disabilities and has done so successfully for residents with IDD \nand ABI.  It also knows how to provide information, opportunities, and meaningful choice about \nwhether to remain in a segregated nursing facility, since it does so for persons with IDD and \nABI.  And it knows how to provide effective screening, evaluation, service planning, specialized \nservices, and case management, since it does so for persons with IDD.  Its systematic failure to \ndo so for persons with other disabilities in nursing facilities leaves thousands of these persons \nunnecessarily institutionalized in nursing facilities, in violation of the ADA, Section 504, and the \nMedicaid Act.   \n10.  These few opportunities to transition to the community for the thousands of \nMedicaid-eligible people in nursing facilities means that qualified individuals who need \nresidential services and supports must wait years, if not decades, to leave nursing facilities, and \nsome never get to leave at all.  Thus, as a direct result of the defendants’ actions and inactions, \nindividuals with disabilities are experiencing or will experience unnecessary and prolonged \n4 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 5 of 61\ninstitutionalization in nursing facilities, due to the lack of sufficient community residential \nservices and supports that would allow them to live in the most integrated setting.   \n11.  The defendants also fail to offer a meaningful and effective process to allow \npersons with disabilities to make an informed choice whether to remain in or leave a segregated \nnursing facility.  The defendants fail to regularly provide relevant information to people with \ndisabilities in nursing facilities about community residential programs; present no opportunity to \nexplore and visit community residential options or engage in meaningful community activities; \nmake no systematic efforts to address barriers to transition; offer no accommodations for the \nimpact of the person’s disability on decisions concerning where to receive services; and provide \nno method for ensuring that they can make an informed choice about whether to remain in a \nsegregated nursing facility.  Similarly, there is no case management entity that is responsible for \nplanning and coordinating residential services that would allow persons with disabilities to \ntransition to community residential services.   \n12.  The unnecessary segregation and isolation of persons with disabilities stems \ndirectly from the defendants’ failure to meet their requirements under federal law.  The \ninadequacies of the defendants’ long-term care system include: (1) the failure to provide or fund  \ncommunity residential services and supports necessary to meet the diverse needs of persons with \ndisabilities in nursing facilities; (2) the failure to adequately inform persons with disabilities of \nHCBS options, including culturally competent1 residential services and supports; (3) the failure \nto engage with persons with disabilities and accommodate their disabilities to ensure that they \ncan make informed choices about whether to remain in a segregated nursing facility or live in an \n                                                 \n1  Throughout this Complaint, “culturally competent” in the context of services means services \nthat are effective, equitable, understandable, respectful, and responsive to diverse cultural health \nbeliefs and practices, preferred languages, health literacy, and other communication needs. \n \n \n5 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 6 of 61\nintegrated community setting; and (4) the lack of case management services that could facilitate \nthe transition of persons with disabilities from nursing facilities to residences in the community. \n13.  The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to require the defendants to \nprovide or fund timely, culturally competent, and appropriate community residential services and \nsupports that would enable them to transition from segregated nursing facilities to more \nintegrated community living arrangements, as required by the ADA, Section 504, and the \nMedicaid Act.  Individuals with Serious Mental Illness (SMI) seek additional declaratory and \ninjunctive relief requiring the defendants to comply with the Pre-Admission Screening and \nResident Review (PASRR) requirements of the Medicaid Act, including the provision of \nspecialized services and active treatment to them while residing in nursing facilities.   \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n14.  This action is authorized by 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to redress the deprivation under \ncolor of state law of rights, privileges, and immunities guaranteed by federal laws and the United \nStates Constitution.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(3), and \n1343(4). \n15.  This action is also brought pursuant to Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, \nand Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794.  The defendants are public \nentities subject to Title II of the ADA, and receive federal financial assistance for, among other \nthings, their Medicaid program, which in significant part funds the defendants’ long-term care \nsystem, including nursing facility services and community services and supports.  This Court has \njurisdiction over the claims under the ADA and Section 504 pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12133 and \n29 U.S.C. § 794a.  \n6 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 7 of 61\n16.  Plaintiffs’ request for declaratory relief is brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 \nand Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Injunctive relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2202, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n17.  Venue is proper in the District of Massachusetts pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). \nIII.    PARTIES \nA.    Individual Plaintiffs \n18.

Massachusetts Senior Action Council (MSAC) is a state-wide, grassroots, senior-\nled organization comprised of older adults throughout the state.  Members of MSAC and its \nvarious chapters include older adults with disabilities who reside in nursing facilities and desire \nto return to more integrated settings in their homes and communities, but who are unable to do so \nbecause of the defendants’ failure to provide them with appropriate community residential \nservices and supports. \n26.    MSAC is dedicated to ensuring that long-term care is delivered in the most \nintegrated setting possible.  It empowers its members to use their own voices to address key \npublic policy and community issues that affect their health and well-being.  MSAC’s members \nrepresent a diverse cross-section of Massachusetts’ older adult community, working together to \n8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 9 of 61\neradicate health disparities in communities of color and advocating for community-driven and \ncommunity-centric solutions.  MSAC has spent, and continues to spend, considerable resources \nadvocating for reforms in the Commonwealth’s long-term care system, for expansion of \ncommunity options needed to allow people with disabilities to live in integrated community \nsettings, and for racial and health equity in the provision of community supports. \n27.  MSAC brings this action on its own behalf and on behalf of its members who are \ndirectly affected by the defendants’ actions and inactions. \nC.    Defendants \n28.  Charles D. Baker is the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  He is \nresponsible for directing, supervising, and expending legislative appropriations for the executive \ndepartments of state government, including the Executive Office of Health and Human Services \n(EOHHS), the Executive Office of Administration and Finance (EOAF), and the Executive \nOffice of Elder Affairs (EOEA).  He is also responsible for seeking, allocating, reallocating, \nexpending, and monitoring funds from the legislature to implement the programs and deliver the \nservices of those executive agencies, including all EOHHS programs for persons with \ndisabilities, such as its waiver programs and other programs those departments operate.  The \nGovernor appoints the Secretaries of EOHHS, EOAF, and EOEA and approves the appointments \nof other personnel at relevant departments and agencies, including MassHealth, which is the \ndivision of EOHHS that directly administers the Commonwealth’s Medicaid program.  The \nGovernor also is responsible for approving and ensuring the implementation of key disability \npolicy and long-term care policies of the Commonwealth, including compliance with the ADA \nand other federal laws.  Governor Baker is sued in his official capacity.  \n9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 10 of 61\n29.  Marylou Sudders is the Secretary of EOHHS and is responsible for the oversight, \nsupervision, and administration of each of the departments within EOHHS, including EOEA, the \nDepartment of Mental Health (DMH), the Department of Public Health (DPH), the Department \nof Disability Services (DDS), the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission (MRC), and \nMassHealth.  EOHHS is the Single State Agency in the Commonwealth responsible for \ncomplying with the Medicaid Act, including requesting, spending, and accounting for the \nCommonwealth’s use of Federal Financial Participation (FFP) under the Act.  Secretary Sudders \nis responsible for the supervision, direction, and oversight of the Commonwealth’s Medicaid \nprogram, including all mandatory and optional Medicaid services, including HCBS waiver \nprograms and other services designed to enable individuals with disabilities in nursing facilities \nto transition to community settings, and for persons with SMI, to receive specialized services and \nactive treatment.  She is sued in her official capacity.  \n30.  Michael J. Heffernan is the Secretary of the EOAF and is responsible for seeking, \nallocating, and approving the expenditure of adequate funds from the legislature to comply with \nthe requirements of the Medicaid program and federal law.  He is sued in his official capacity. \n31.  Elizabeth Chen, Ph.D., is the Secretary of the EOEA, an agency under the \nadministrative authority of EOHHS.  Secretary Chen is responsible for planning, administering, \nand overseeing all services for older adults, and for “administering and coordinating a \ncomprehensive system of long-term care benefits and services for elderly persons, including \ninstitutional, home-based and community-based care and services.”  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 19A, \n§ 1.  EOEA is directly responsible for the day-to-day operation of the Frail Elder Waiver and the \nAging Service Access Points (ASAPs), which is a program designed by statute to provide \n10 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 11 of 61\ninformation and referral, pre-admission screening, and care coordination to older adults.

Ms. Kraft oversees \nthe development and execution of the Massachusetts Medicaid Plan and waiver programs, \nincluding all Medicaid policies, procedures, contracts, and practices.  As Assistant Secretary for \nMassHealth, Ms. Kraft is responsible for ensuring that appropriate residential and support \nservices are provided to nursing facility residents seeking to leave their facilities and return to \ntheir communities, as well as those residents with SMI in need of specialized services and active \ntreatment.  She is sued in her official capacity. \nIV.  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n33.  Pursuant to Rules 23(a) and (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the \nindividual plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of the following class: All Medicaid-eligible \npersons with disabilities in the Commonwealth who have resided or will reside in a nursing \nfacility for at least 60 days, meet the qualifications for the Commonwealth’s HCBS community \nprograms, and need access to appropriate community residential services and supports2 to live in \nintegrated settings in the community. \n                                                 \n2  The term “residential services and supports” means services that include provider-operated \nhomes in the community plus an array of support services necessary to allow individuals with \ncomplex needs in nursing facilities to live in integrated settings in the community.  These \nresidential services and supports currently are provided by EOHHS through its Moving Forward \nResidential Waiver program.  See Sec.V.D., infra.  For some persons with disabilities in nursing \nfacilities who do not need this level of assistance, but do need an affordable and accessible \nresidential setting, residential services and supports include a housing subsidy for an accessible \nand affordable living unit and a service coordinator/case manager who locates and arranges the \nhousing unit.  This type of residential services and supports currently is provided by EOHHS \nthrough its Moving Forward Community Living Waiver program, as well as through DMH’s \n supported housing programs.  Id.  Both waiver programs and DMH’s programs have a fixed \n \n11 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 12 of 61\n34.  The individual plaintiffs also bring additional Medicaid claims on behalf of the \nfollowing subclass (referenced herein as the “PASRR subclass”): All Medicaid-eligible persons \nwith serious mental illness who have been admitted to, or who should be screened for admission \nto, nursing facilities pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(e)(7) and 42 C.F.R. § 483.112. \n35.  The size of the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \nThere are approximately 22,000 adults with disabilities institutionalized in Massachusetts \nnursing facilities.  Joinder is also impracticable because the class is dynamic, and its members \nlack the knowledge and financial means to maintain individual actions. \n36.  The size of the PASRR subclass is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable.  There are at least 1,500 individuals with SMI residing in nursing facilities across \nthe Commonwealth.  Joinder is also impracticable because the PASRR subclass is dynamic, and \nits members lack the knowledge and financial means to maintain individual actions.   \n37.  There are questions of fact common to the class, including inter alia: \na.  Whether the defendants’ planning, funding, and administration of its long- \nterm care system for persons with disabilities fail to provide residential services \nand supports in the most integrated setting, resulting in the unnecessary \ninstitutionalization of persons with disabilities in nursing facilities; \nb.  Whether the defendants’ policies, procedures, and practices for its long- \nterm care system result in the unnecessary institutionalization of persons with \ndisabilities in nursing facilities; \n                                                 \ncapacity, which is woefully inadequate to allow all qualified persons with disabilities in nursing \nfacilities to live in integrated settings in the community. \n \n \n12 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 13 of 61\nc.  Whether the defendants’ residential services and support options for \npersons with disabilities are inadequate to allow all persons with disabilities in \nnursing facilities who are qualified for community residential services and \nsupports to transition to integrated residential settings in the community in a \ntimely manner; \nd.  Whether the defendants fail to effectively provide persons with disabilities \nin nursing facilities with sufficient and culturally competent information, \nopportunities, and accommodations to allow all persons with disabilities to make \nan informed choice whether to remain in a segregated institution or move to \nintegrated residential settings in the community; \ne.  Whether the defendants fail to provide persons with disabilities in nursing \nfacilities with medically necessary case management that plans, coordinates, and \nassists in obtaining appropriate community residential services and supports that \nwould allow them to live in culturally competent integrated residential settings in \nthe community; and    \nf.   Whether the defendants fail to provide equitable access to community \nresidential services and supports to persons with disabilities in nursing facilities. \n38.  There are questions of law common to the class, including inter alia: \na.  Whether the defendants are violating the ADA and Section 504 by \nplanning, funding, and administering their long-term care system in a manner that \nrequires persons with disabilities to live in nursing facilities in order to receive \nnecessary residential services and supports; \n13 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 14 of 61\nb.  Whether the defendants are violating the ADA and Section 504 by: \n(i) failing to offer and provide community residential services and supports to \nnursing facility residents with disabilities that would enable them to live in the \nmost integrated setting appropriate to their needs; and (ii) utilizing eligibility \ncriteria and methods of administration that have the effect of excluding \nindividuals with disabilities from accessing the community residential services \nand supports they need to reside in integrated, community residential settings;  \nc.  Whether the defendants are violating the ADA and Section 504 by \nplanning, funding, and administering their long-term care system in a way that \ndiscriminates against persons with disabilities; \nd.  Whether the defendants’ failure to provide persons with disabilities in \nnursing facilities with timely access to community residential services and \nsupports that would allow them to transition to the community, and their failure to \nprovide timely services for persons with disabilities enrolled in a HCBS waiver \nprogram, violates the reasonable promptness provisions of the Medicaid Act;  \ne.  Whether the defendants’ failure to provide persons with disabilities with \ninformation sufficient to allow them to make an informed choice of whether to \nenter or remain in a nursing facility violates the freedom of choice provision of \nthe Medicaid Act; and \nf.  Whether the defendants’ administration of the freedom of choice \nprovisions of the Medicaid Act, without providing nursing facility residents with \nreasonable accommodations in the choice process, violates the Medicaid Act.  \n39.  There are questions of fact common to the PASRR subclass, including inter alia: \n14 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 15 of 61\na.  Whether the defendants fail to accurately screen and identify persons with \na diagnosis of SMI prior to or after their admission to a nursing facility; \nb.  Whether the defendants fail to comprehensively evaluate persons with a \ndiagnosis of SMI to determine if they could be served in a community setting as \nan alternative to admission to a nursing facility; and \nc.  Whether the defendants fail to comprehensively assess whether persons \nwith a diagnosis of SMI need specialized services and to provide needed \nspecialized services and active treatment.     \n40.  There are questions of law common to the PASRR subclass, including inter alia: \nWhether the defendants are violating the PASRR provisions of the Medicaid Act \nby:  (i) failing to establish a Level II evaluation program that accurately \ndetermines if persons with SMI who apply for admission to a nursing facility can \nbe appropriately served in a more integrated community residential setting; (ii) \nfailing to conduct professionally acceptable assessments to determine the \nspecialized services these individuals require; and (iii) failing to provide an array \nof specialized services to persons with SMI in nursing facilities who need them in \na manner that satisfies the federal standard for active treatment.   \n41.  The individual plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the class and the \nPASRR subclass. \n42.  The representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nclass and PASRR subclass.

STATEMENT OF FACTS \nA.    Statutory Framework  \n \n   (1)   The Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act \n44.  On July 12, 1990, Congress enacted the ADA, establishing the most important \ncivil rights laws for persons with disabilities in our nation’s history.   \n45.  Congress stated in its findings that “historically, society has tended to isolate and \nsegregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social \nproblem.”  42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2). \n46.  Congress found that “discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists \nin . . . institutionalization . . . and access to public services.”  42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(3).  Congress \nalso found that “individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of \ndiscrimination, including outright intentional exclusion . . . , segregation, and relegation to lesser \nservices, programs, activities, benefits, jobs, or other opportunities.”  42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(5).    \n47.  Congress further concluded that “[i]ndividuals with disabilities are a discrete and \ninsular minority who have been faced with restrictions and limitations, subjected to a history of \npurposeful unequal treatment, and relegated to a position of political powerlessness in our \n16 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 17 of 61\nsociety, based on characteristics that are beyond the control of such individuals and resulting \nfrom stereotypic assumptions not truly indicative of the individual ability of such individuals to \nparticipate in, and contribute to, society.”  42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7) (1990). \n48.  A major purpose of the ADA is to provide a clear and comprehensive national \nmandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities and to provide \nclear, strong, consistent, and enforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals \nwith disabilities.  42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1) & (2). \n49.  Title II of the ADA applies to all “public entities,” including the defendants \nherein.  42 U.S.C. § 12131(1)(b).  It provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, \nby reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the \nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to any discrimination by such \nentity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n50.  In Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), the Supreme Court held that the \nunnecessary institutionalization of individuals with disabilities constitutes discrimination in \nviolation of Title II of the ADA.  Id. at 597.  In so holding, the Court made clear that public \nentities must serve persons with disabilities in community-based, rather than institutional, \nsettings when: 1) providing community-based services is appropriate; 2) the individual does not \noppose receiving such services; and 3) the provision of community-based services can be \nreasonably accommodated, considering the resources available to the entity and the needs of \nother persons with disabilities.  Id. at 607. \n51.  In reaching its decision in Olmstead, the Court stated that “unjustified institutional \nisolation of persons with disabilities is a form of discrimination” because “[i]n order to receive \nneeded medical services, persons with mental disabilities, because of those disabilities, \n17 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 18 of 61\nrelinquish participation in community life.”  Id. at 600-601.  In addition, the Court noted that \nsegregation “perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or \nunworthy of participating in community life” and “severely diminishes the everyday life \nactivities of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, [and] \neconomic independence.”  Id. \n52.  The regulations implementing Title II of the ADA state that “[a] public entity \nshall administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to \nthe needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).  The “most \nintegrated setting” is the “setting that enables individuals with disabilities to interact with \nnondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible.”  28 C.F.R. pt. 35, App. A, p. 450 (2010). \n53.  This Integration Mandate requires that public entities provide individuals with \ndisabilities with “opportunities to live, work, and receive services in the greater community, like \nindividuals without disabilities.”  Statement of the Department of Justice on Enforcement of the \nIntegration Mandate of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Olmstead v. L.C., \nhttps://www.ada.gov/olmstead/q&a_olmstead.htm (last updated Feb. 25, 2020 / last visited \nSeptember 26, 2022).  Accordingly, the defendants must provide unnecessarily institutionalized \npersons and those at risk of unnecessary institutionalization, such as persons with disabilities in \nnursing facilities, with “opportunities to live in their own apartments or family homes, with \nnecessary supports,” as well as “expand[] the services and supports necessary for [their] \nsuccessful community tenure,” rather than providing services in large congregate facilities.  Id. \n54.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act also prohibits discrimination on the basis of \ndisability.   Section 504’s implementing regulations also contain an Integration Mandate, which \nrequires that recipients of federal funds “administer programs and activities in the most \n18 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 19 of 61\nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped persons.” 28 C.F.R. \n§ 41.51(d). \n55.  The ADA and Section 504 regulations also prohibit the differential treatment of \nindividuals with disabilities or any class of individuals with disabilities with respect to their \nopportunity to access the full range of aids, benefits, or services in any program operated by a \npublic entity.  See 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(1)(ii) & (b)(1)(iv), 41.51(b)(1)(ii) & (b)(1)(iv); 45 \nC.F.R. §§ 84.4(b)(1)(ii) & (b)(1)(iv). \n56.  The ADA and Section 504 regulations prohibit public entities from utilizing \n“criteria or methods of administration” that have the effect of subjecting qualified individuals \nwith disabilities to discrimination, including unnecessary institutionalization, or “that have the \npurpose or effect of substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the public \nentity’s program with respect to individuals with disabilities.”  See 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(3), \n41.51(b)(3); 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(4). \n57.    The ADA regulations further specify that “[a] public entity shall not impose or \napply eligibility criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or any \nclass of individuals with disabilities from fully and equally enjoying any service program or \nactivity unless such criteria can be shown to be necessary for the provision of the service, \nprogram, or activity being offered.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(8). \n58.  Both the ADA and Section 504 also require that public entities must make \nreasonable modifications in their policies, practices, or procedures when necessary to avoid \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability, including the unnecessary segregation or \ninstitutionalization of individuals, unless such modifications would fundamentally alter the \nnature of the service, program, or activity.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7); § 41.53. \n19 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 20 of 61\n59.  Thus, the ADA and Section 504, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in \nOlmstead, require that public entities like the Commonwealth and EOHHS provide services to \npeople with disabilities in the most integrated setting.  The ADA and Section 504 also prohibit \nthese entities from discriminating on the basis of disability; from denying persons with \ndisabilities equal access to their benefits, programs, and services; from employing eligibility \ncriteria that screen out or tend to screen out certain persons with disabilities; and from \nadministering their public services in a manner that denies persons with disabilities full \nparticipation in the entity’s programs and services. \n(2)  The Medicaid Act \n60.  The reasonable promptness provision of the Medicaid Act requires that States \nprovide all medical services promptly, and no longer than 90 days, from the time the service is \ndeemed necessary or, if a HCBS program, the person is deemed eligible for the program.  42 \nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8).   \n61.  The freedom of choice provision of the Medicaid Act requires that States provide \nmeaningful information that allows a person with a disability to make an informed choice \nbetween institutional services, like nursing facilities, or community services, like HCBS.  42 \nU.S.C. § 1396n(c)(2)(C).    \n(3)  The Nursing Home Reform Act Amendments to the Medicaid Act \n \n62.  The Nursing Home Reform Act (NHRA) of 1987 amendments to the Medicaid \nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(e), which include the PASRR provisions, are part of a comprehensive \nremedial statute designed to address the widespread problem of warehousing people with mental \nillness and developmental disabilities in nursing facilities.  Congress enacted the PASRR \n20 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 21 of 61\nprovisions of the NHRA to prevent and remedy the unnecessary admission and confinement of \npeople with mental illness and developmental disabilities in nursing facilities. \n63.    The PASRR provisions require a careful screening of all individuals being \nconsidered for admission to a nursing facility to determine if they may have a mental illness.  \nThis is referred to as the Level I PASRR screen.  42 C.F.R. § 483.128(a). \n64.  The State must then, for all persons seeking admission to a nursing facility whose \nLevel I PASRR screen indicates that they may have a mental illness, evaluate and determine \nwhether they satisfy the State's nursing facility level of care criteria, whether their needs could be \nmet in the community through the provision of appropriate alternative services, and whether they \ncould benefit from the provision of specialized services to maximize their ability for self-\ndetermination and independence. This more in-depth evaluation is referred to as the Level II \nPASRR review. 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.128(a), 483.132, 483.134. \n65.  If the Level II PASRR review determines that a person with a mental illness \nrequires specialized services, the State, through its State Mental Health Authority, must provide \nor arrange for the provision of these services.  42 C.F.R. § 483.120(b). \n66.  PASRR reviewers are obligated to explain to the individual involved and, where \napplicable, his or her legal representative, the results of the Level II PASRR evaluation, \nincluding information regarding the individual’s ability to reside in a less restrictive community \nplacement, and must provide the individual and any legal representative with a copy of the \nPASRR report.  42 CFR §§ 483.128(k), 483.130(l)(3). \n67.  If an individual with a mental illness is admitted to a nursing facility, periodic \nreviews must be conducted whenever there is a change in the person’s condition to determine \nwhether the individual continues to need a nursing level of care and to require confinement in a \n21 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 22 of 61\nnursing facility.  The periodic PASRR Level II evaluations must also determine whether \nspecialized services are necessary to provide active treatment.  42 U.S.C. § 1396r(e)(7)(A) & \n(B); 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.128(h)(5), 483.132, 483.134. \n68.  If the PASRR review determines that an individual with mental illness admitted to \na nursing facility needs specialized services, it must then be determined whether the nursing \nfacility can provide all needed specialized services and active treatment.  If the review concludes \nthe facility cannot provide the required level of active treatment, or if the individual’s needs \nexceed the level of services that the nursing facility does provide, the individual cannot be \nadmitted to that nursing facility.  42 C.F.R. § 483.126. \n69.  Thus, the Medicaid Act requires that covered services, like Medicaid-funded \nHCBS, be provided promptly; that States offer Medicaid recipients information and an \nopportunity to make a meaningful choice to receive community services before being \ninstitutionalized in a nursing facility; and that, for people with mental illness, individuals be \nscreened prior to admission to a nursing facility, be evaluated to determine if an alternative \ncommunity placement would be appropriate, and if admitted to a nursing facility, provided a \nrange of specialized services necessary to treat their psychiatric condition. \n(4)  Massachusetts Equal Choice Law \n70.  The Medicaid Act’s PASRR provisions are mirrored in the Commonwealth’s \n“Equal Choice Law,” Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 118E, § 9(3), which requires the defendants to \nprovide pre-admission counseling and an assessment for community services to any person at \nrisk of entering a nursing facility.  The statute applies to all individuals, regardless of disabling \ncondition, and is intended to avoid unnecessary segregation in a nursing facility by ensuring that \n22 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 23 of 61\nthose at risk of institutionalization are provided meaningful choices and actual service options in \nthe community. \nB.  The Administrative Framework  \n  (1)   The Commonwealth’s Medicaid Program \n71.  State participation in the Medicaid program is optional.  States choosing to \nreceive federal matching funds for their Medicaid program must comply with the requirements \nof the Medicaid Act and federal regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services.  42 U.S.C. § 1396, 42 C.F.R. § 430 et seq. \n72.  As a condition of participating in the Medicaid program, States must submit to the \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) a State Medicaid Plan (State Plan) that fulfills \nthe requirements of the Medicaid Act. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a). \n73.  The federal government pays approximately 50% of the cost of the Medicaid \nservices, including nursing facility services, that MassHealth provides, with the Commonwealth \nfunding the balance.  Significantly, the federal government pays a much higher percentage \n(approximately 80%) of certain administrative costs, including case management and pre-\nadmission screening to nursing facilities.  There is no overall limit on how much the federal \ngovernment will pay for Medicaid services, i.e., if covered services are provided to eligible \nbeneficiaries as specified in the State Plan, the federal government must participate in sharing the \ncosts of those services.  \n74.  According to the federal government website Medicaid.gov, as of May 2022, \napproximately 1,894,844 Massachusetts residents were enrolled in the Medicaid program.  \nApproximately 22,000 of those Medicaid recipients reside in nursing facilities. \n \n23 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 24 of 61\n(2)  The Commonwealth Agencies that Deliver Long-Term Care Services \n75.  EOHHS is the lead state agency responsible for designing, developing, \nadministering, and overseeing the Commonwealth’s long-term care system, which includes both \ninstitutions, like nursing facilities, and community programs, like HCBS.  EOHHS includes, \namong other sub-agencies, EOEA, MassHealth, DPH, DMH, DDS, and MRC.  Each of these \nagencies has direct responsibility for certain groups of persons with disabilities in nursing \nfacilities or for certain tasks related to nursing facilities.  Each agency also has direct \nresponsibility for certain community components of the Commonwealth’s long-term care \nsystem. \n76.  MassHealth funds both nursing facilities and certain HCBS programs using \nMedicaid funds.  DPH oversees and certifies nursing facilities.  EOEA has the responsibility for \nand manages most programs that serve older adults.  DMH is the primary agency responsible for \nproviding long-term care services to persons with SMI and the PASRR program for people with \nmental illness.  DDS is the primary agency responsible for providing services to persons with \nIDD and for administering and managing the Commonwealth’s residential habilitation waivers.  \nMRC has the primary responsibility for persons with physical disabilities. \nC.  The Commonwealth’s Nursing Facilities \n77.  The Medicaid Act defines a nursing facility as an institution which primarily \nprovides: (1) skilled nursing care; (2) rehabilitation services for those who are sick, injured, or \ndisabled; or (3) health-related care and services to individuals who, because of their mental or \nphysical condition, require care and services in an institutional setting.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396r(a)(1)(A-C).   \n24 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 25 of 61\n78.  Services provided in nursing facilities are defined as “services which are . . . \nrequired to be given an individual who needs . . . on a daily basis nursing care (provided by or \nrequiring the supervision of nursing personnel) or other rehabilitation services which as a \npractical matter can only be provided in a nursing facility on an inpatient basis.”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396d(f).   \n79.  Nursing facilities are institutions that provide residential services and supports in \na segregated setting.  Despite often being called nursing “homes,” they are not real homes or \neven home-like.  Rather, they are residential institutions that congregate large numbers of \nunrelated persons with disabilities who did not know each other before entering the facility and \nhave not chosen to live together.  \n80.  Most nursing facilities more closely resemble medical institutions — they have \nnurses’ stations, dispense medications, and sometimes use alarmed doors to monitor persons \nleaving and entering the facility or its wards.  Some have locked doors, accessible only with an \nemployee code or pass key.  \n81.  There is little, if any, privacy for persons with disabilities in nursing facilities.  \nIndividuals often share rooms with other people whom they did not know previously and with \nwhom they did not choose to live.  They often cannot even close the doors to their own rooms.  \n82.  Meals are provided based upon a schedule dictated by the institution.  People with \ndisabilities have little choice about what and when to eat.  Food selection rarely reflects the \nethnic or racial diversity of the people with disabilities in nursing facilities. \n83.  Nursing facilities are stark environments where residents have a minimal number \nof personal possessions that usually cannot be secured.  People with disabilities in nursing \n25 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 26 of 61\nfacilities have little, if any, choice regarding when to wake, sleep, shower, how to spend their \ndays, and if and when to leave the facility for “outings.”  \n84.    Persons with disabilities in nursing facilities are neither integrated into, nor have \nopportunities to participate in, the communities in which they live or had lived prior to admission \nto the nursing facility.  They have limited access to the community, and rarely participate in \ncommunity activities, such as meeting friends, attending religious services, attending civic \nevents, or even simply sitting outside in parks or at other public spaces.  \n85.  Most persons with disabilities in nursing facilities never have the opportunity to \nleave the facility — not because their condition precludes it, but simply because there are few \nopportunities and limited means to do so. \n86.  Virtually all persons with disabilities in nursing facilities are denied access to \nmeaningful employment and education opportunities due to the segregated environment in which \nthey live and the limited supports that they are provided. \n87.  Many persons with disabilities in nursing facilities never receive visitors, even \nbefore the COVID-19 pandemic.   \n88.  During the pandemic, people in nursing facilities have been even more isolated.  \nIn early April 2020, nursing facilities in Massachusetts closed to visitors, including family, to \nprevent the spread of COVID-19.  People living in nursing facilities went for over a year without \nface-to-face visits with family and friends from their communities.   \n89.  The harm of institutionalization in nursing facilities has been dramatically \nmagnified by COVID-19.  Almost one in seven persons in nursing facilities in Massachusetts \ndied during COVID-19.  Even after EOHHS-mandated lock downs, the use of protective \nequipment and other precautions, and the provision of additional resources, persons with \n26 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 27 of 61\ndisabilities died – and continue to die – at an alarming rate.   Living in a segregated and \ncongregated nursing facility dramatically increased the probability of premature death for \npersons with disabilities.   \n90.  These harms and risks are not evenly distributed even in nursing facilities.  \nPersons with more significant disabilities suffer and die more frequently.  Black people and other \npeople of color with disabilities are disproportionately impacted by the pandemic and \ndisproportionately harmed by unnecessary institutionalization in nursing facilities. Black persons \nwith disabilities in nursing facilities experience higher levels of physical restraint, feeding tubes, \nand psychotropic medications than their white peers.  \n91.  Race-based segregation in nursing facilities is extensive and impacts quality of \ncare.  Nursing facilities located in and targeted to persons from communities of color are \nroutinely more poorly resourced, have higher admission rates, are more poorly staffed, and, not \nsurprisingly, deliver poorer health outcomes for Black persons with disabilities.    \n92.  Although nursing facilities provide a place to live, most do not provide active \ntreatment designed to meet the mental health needs of persons with disabilities, and particularly \npeople diagnosed with SMI or other cognitive disabilities.  The care provided is primarily \ncustodial, at least for persons with disabilities who remain in these facilities for long periods.  \nFor Black persons with Alzheimer’s dementia in nursing facilities, even custodial care can be \nlacking; there is increased prevalence of unsupported diagnoses of schizophrenia; and their care \nneeds are more likely to be addressed through inappropriate use of psychotropic medications \nthan their white peers. \n27 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 28 of 61\n93.   Historically, there has been a shortage of qualified direct-care staff and trained \nprofessionals, which has only compounded during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older non-white \npersons with disabilities in nursing facilities had the highest rates of COVID-19 hospitalization. \n94.  The operational practice of nursing facilities is to care for people in a segregated \nsetting rather than to have them care for themselves in an integrated one.  Consequently, older \nadults and individuals with disabilities in nursing facilities often regress and deteriorate, losing \nbasic skills and competencies needed to live successfully in the community.  \n95.  As a result of these pervasive institutional conditions, persons with disabilities in \nnursing facilities suffer harm from unnecessary confinement in segregated facilities, when they \ncould receive the same services and supports in an integrated community residential setting. \nD.  The Commonwealth’s Community Services for Persons with Disabilities \n96.  Virtually all of the services provided in a nursing facility can be, and in fact are, \nalso provided in integrated community settings.  Significantly, many, if not most, individuals \ncurrently receiving services in a nursing facility qualify for EOHHS’ HCBS waiver programs.  In \nfact, the eligibility criteria for these community waiver programs are identical to the eligibility \ncriteria for nursing facilities. \n97.  EOEA is responsible for the planning, development, and implementation of home \ncare programs for older adults in the Commonwealth.  EOEA administers a range of programs \nthat are supposed to provide information, referral, needs assessment, care coordination, and \nsupport services for eligible individuals.  EOEA operates its home care programs through a \nnetwork of 24 non-profit entities called ASAPs.  It delegates authority to these ASAPs to support \nthe older adults who participate in its home care programs, including the responsibility for \nproviding pre-admission counseling to avoid nursing facility admission and for conducting \n28 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 29 of 61\nclinical eligibility determinations for long-term stays in nursing facilities.  Few, if any, ASAPs \nregularly provide information about community options, visits to community programs, \naccommodations to ensure informed choice, and transition planning and assistance to secure \nresidential services and supports.  While ASAPs can help divert or transition older adults from \nnursing facilities who do not need residential services, ASAPs lack the capacity to provide \nresidential services or housing with the supports that are often needed to successfully divert or \ntransition older adults with disabilities from nursing facilities. \n98.  For persons with SMI, DMH plans, develops, administers, and monitors both \ncommunity residential and supports services, which are theoretically available to persons \ndiagnosed with SMI in nursing facilities.  DMH funds, licenses, and oversees a range of \ncommunity residential services for persons with SMI, including community group homes, \napartments with live-in staff, supported housing, and subsidized, accessible housing units that are \nleased by the individual with rental subsidies provided by DMH.  As a practical matter, however, \nDMH rarely offers its existing long-term services to persons diagnosed with SMI in nursing \nfacilities, and usually terminates eligibility for any existing services, like case management, once \nsuch persons enter an institution.   \n99.  Even though DMH statutorily administers the PASRR program for persons with \nmental illness, which is supposed to evaluate whether persons diagnosed with mental illness who \nare referred to nursing facilities could be better served in the community, virtually no persons \ndiagnosed with mental illness are diverted from admission.  This failure to divert significantly \nimpacts people of color, who are diagnosed with mental illness at higher rates than their white \npeers.  And although the PASRR program is supposed to determine what specialized services \npersons diagnosed with mental illness in a nursing facility need to actively treat their psychiatric \n29 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 30 of 61\ndisability, and although DMH is mandated by federal law to provide these specialized services, \nthis almost never happens.   \n100.  MassHealth’s community programs, other than its capacity-limited HCBS or \nGroup Adult Foster Care programs, do not provide community residential services or supports \nnecessary to allow persons with disabilities in nursing facilities to transition to the community, \neven though thousands of persons who receive long-term supports from MassHealth need \nresidential services in order to live or remain in the community.   \n101.  For older adults who meet specific eligibility criteria (aged 60 and older, or under \n60 with a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease or related disorder), there are only non-residential \nservices and supports available through MassHealth.  Assisted Living Facilities (ALFs) are not \nroutinely available for older adults on Medicaid, and particularly for older adults from \ncommunities of color.  Moreover, the regulatory and rate structure for the ALF program preclude \nproviding small, integrated residential services in the community for older adults.  As a result, \nolder adults without a home to return to in the community are often unnecessarily \ninstitutionalized in nursing facilities.    \n102.  MassHealth also administers several HCBS waiver programs,3 which provide an  \narray of Medicaid-funded residential and support services in the community to a small number of \nindividuals who meet specific eligibility criteria.  Eligibility for a HCBS program is based on a \ndetermination that the individual is Medicaid-eligible and meets the clinical requirements for \nadmission to a nursing facility, but could be served in the community with appropriate supports.  \n                                                 \n3  HCBS waiver programs are authorized pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1396(n), which allows states to \nprovide Medicaid services in the community without meeting (i.e. waiving) various institutional \nrequirements. \n \n \n30 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 31 of 61\nSome HCBS programs provide a full-time residential setting or home, while others only provide \nsupport services and the persons with disabilities must locate their own living arrangements. \n103.    In total, Massachusetts has 10 HCBS waiver programs serving a range of \nspecific populations, seven of which are limited to children or persons with specific disabilities \nas a result of prior litigation, thus excluding the individual plaintiffs and others like them.  Only \none – the Frail Elder Waiver – focuses on older adults, but it does not include any residential \nservices. \n104.   There are only two HCBS waiver programs that provide both residential services \nand supports to all persons in nursing facilities and are not limited by age or disability.  They are \nnot focused only on persons with disabilities living in nursing facilities, however, but instead \nalso serve individuals interested in leaving psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation facilities, and \nother health care institutions.  In effect, these two waivers – the Moving Forward Residential \nHabilitation and Community Living Programs (together referred to as the MFP waiver programs) \n– are the only options that provide residential services and supports for persons with physical \ndisabilities, persons diagnosed with SMI, and older adults with disabilities in nursing facilities.   \n105.  The MFP waiver programs offer a range of residential services and supports \nadequate to allow most persons with disabilities to transition to the community and live in more \nintegrated settings.  However, each is restricted to a fixed number of persons, with only 50 new \n“slots” per year for persons needing residential services and 75 new “slots” per year for persons \nwho have their own housing but need other community supports.  The capacity of these waiver \nprograms is plainly insufficient to meet the needs of people with disabilities in nursing facilities \nfor integrated long-term care services. \n31 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 32 of 61\n106.   The Commonwealth recently announced the renewal of a federal demonstration \nprogram called Money Follows the Person (MFP Demonstration).  This program provides some \nlimited outreach efforts, transition planning, and assistance in applying for community services \nlike the MFP waiver program.  But the MFP Demonstration does not provide any community \nservices or supports, including residential services, to persons once they leave a nursing facility, \nexcept for one year of case management.  Such residential and support services are only \navailable through the MFP waiver programs.    \n107.  Although the MFP waiver programs are funded by MassHealth with eligibility \ndeterminations made by MassHealth’s partners at the University of Massachusetts, the \nResidential Habilitation program is managed and administered by DDS, with oversight and \nfunding provided through MassHealth, due to DDS’s long experience in serving persons with \nIDD and ABI in residential settings.  The Community Living program is managed and \nadministered by MRC, with oversight and funding provided through MassHealth, due to MRC’s \nexperience in serving persons with physical disabilities in their own homes.  Neither of these \nstate agencies are dedicated to serving, or even experienced with, the needs of persons with SMI \nor older adults with disabilities who do not meet the eligibility requirements for other State \nagency services.  \n(1)  EOHHS Provides Integrated Long-Term Care for People with IDD and \nABI \n \n108.  The Commonwealth has successfully transitioned other populations from \nsegregated nursing facilities to integrated community living arrangements.  As a direct result of \ntwo settlement agreements to resolve ADA and Medicaid claims for persons with IDD in nursing \nfacilities, the Commonwealth offers two specially designed HCBS programs that offer a broad \n32 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 33 of 61\nrange of residential services and supports which are sufficient to allow virtually any person with \nIDD to leave a segregated nursing facility and live in an integrated setting in the community.  As \na result, more than 1,800 persons with IDD in nursing facilities – or more than 90% of all \npersons with IDD who were segregated in nursing facilities 20 years ago – are now living full \nlives in community homes with appropriate supports.  Rolland v. Cellucci, 191 F.R.D. 3 (D. \nMass. 2000) (first settlement agreement); Rolland v. Patrick, 562 F. Supp. 2d 176 (D. Mass. \n2008) (approving second settlement); Rolland v. Patrick, 946 F. Supp. 2d 226 (D. Mass. 2013) \n(termination). \n109.   The Commonwealth has successfully used PASRR to identify people with IDD \nwho could live in the community with supports.  As required by those settlement agreements, a \nsignificantly restructured PASRR IDD program now successfully diverts most persons with IDD \naway from long-term institutionalization in nursing facilities and provides an array of specialized \nservices and active treatment to those persons with IDD who do reside in such facilities.  These \nspecialized services include regular opportunities to leave nursing facilities, participate in \ncommunity activities, learn about community living, and develop skills necessary for a \nsuccessful return to the community.    \n110.  Each person with IDD who is admitted to a nursing facility, generally for short-\nterm rehabilitation, is assigned a service coordinator who develops a service and transition plan, \nand who coordinates and ensures the provision of services in the nursing facility that allow the \nindividual to transition successfully to the community.  Service coordinators are responsible for \nproviding persons with IDD with information about community living, facilitating visits to \ncommunity programs, addressing concerns about community supports, resolving obstacles to \ncommunity transition, accommodating the impact of IDD and institutionalization on the \n33 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 34 of 61\ntransition process, and ensuring that each person with an IDD can make an informed choice of \nwhether to remain in, or leave, a nursing facility. \n111.  Similarly, pursuant to two other settlement agreements entered to resolve ADA \nand Medicaid claims for persons with ABI in nursing facilities, the Commonwealth created two \nspecially-designed HCBS programs that offer a broad range of residential services and supports \nthat are sufficient to allow most persons with ABI to leave a segregated nursing facility and live \nin an integrated setting in the community.  Hutchinson v. Patrick, 636 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2011), \naffirming 683 F. Supp. 2d 121 (D. Mass. 2010); C.A. 07-30084-MAP (Final Comprehensive \nSettlement Agreement, September 16, 2008; Amended Settlement Agreement, July 12, 2013).  \nAs a result, more than 1,200 persons with ABI once in nursing facilities are now living \nproductive lives in community homes with appropriate supports. \n112.    As required by the Rolland and Hutchinson settlement agreements, staff from \nDDS and MRC regularly visit nursing facilities to meet with persons with ABI and provide \ninformation and opportunities to make an informed choice about whether to transition to the \ncommunity.  Case managers are assigned to each person with ABI who is interested in \ncommunity living in order to facilitate visits to community programs, address concerns about \ncommunity supports, resolve obstacles to community transition, accommodate the impact of \ndisabilities and institutionalization on the transition process, arrange transitions to residential \nservices, and ensure that each person with a disability can make an informed choice of whether \nto remain in, or leave, a nursing facility.   \n(2)  EOHHS Does Not Provide Integrated Long-Term Care for Other People in \nNursing Facilities \n \n34 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 35 of 61\n113.  Unlike people with ABI or IDD, other persons with disabilities in nursing \nfacilities do not have assigned case managers who provide meaningful choices, arrange and \ncoordinate visits to community programs, identify housing options, facilitate transitions to \nresidential services, and address barriers to community-based care.  Unlike their fellow nursing \nfacility residents with ABI or IDD, they do not have access to residential services to help them \nsecure housing and needed supports in the community. \n114.     Despite the statutory, regulatory, and policy mandates that require the provision \nof services in the most integrated setting, the Commonwealth has not taken necessary actions to \nensure that persons with disabilities in nursing facilities, including older adults with disabilities, \ncan promptly access residential and support services that will allow them to transition to \nintegrated community settings.  Instead, it has developed, implemented, and administered its \nlong-term care system in a manner that relies heavily on segregated nursing facilities to provide \nresidential care and that effectively denies persons with disabilities in nursing facilities access to \nthese same services in an integrated community setting. \n115.    The Commonwealth’s long-term care system: (1) lacks an adequate and \nsufficient array of culturally competent, community residential services and supports to equitably \nmeet the needs of all persons with disabilities in nursing facilities; (2) fails to adequately and \nregularly inform them of HCBS options, including residential services; (3) fails to engage and \naccommodate their disabilities, to ensure that they can make an informed choice about whether \nto leave or remain in a segregated facility; and (4) lacks adequate case management services that \ncan plan, coordinate, and monitor residential services necessary to transition persons with \ndisabilities from nursing facilities. \n35 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 36 of 61\n116.    Most persons with disabilities in nursing facilities could reside in integrated, \ncommunity-based settings if they were able to timely access, with reasonable modifications, the \nfull array of residential and support services that already exist and that the Commonwealth \nalready provides to persons with IDD or ABI in nursing facilities. \n117.  Although the defendants know that many persons with disabilities residing in \nnursing facilities need residential supports and services in order to live safely in the community, \nthrough its planning, administration, and funding of its long-term care system and the policies \nand practices that govern this system, the defendants effectively restrict and/or deny these and \nother necessary services.  As a result, persons with disabilities in nursing facilities remain \nunnecessarily institutionalized in segregated nursing facilities, often for many years or decades. \n118.  This institutionalization is not only unnecessary, it is dangerous and unlawful.  \nThe pandemic has starkly revealed the cost – in human suffering and lives – that unnecessary \nconfinement in segregated and congregated nursing facilities creates.  The defendants fail to \nprovide community residential services and supports in an integrated setting, and instead require \npeople with disabilities to be institutionalized in nursing facilities in order to receive these same \nservices.  This failure creates a real and present risk of harm and death to those who remain \nunnecessarily institutionalized in nursing facilities.   \n119.  For persons with disabilities from communities of color, this risk is even more \npronounced.  The location of nursing facilities in or near these communities, the under-\nresourcing of these facilities, the increased risk of COVID-19, the more serious staffing \ndeficiencies, and the defendants’ failure to provide culturally competent residential services and \nsupport in integrated settings place people of color at exceptional risk of harm.  \n36 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 37 of 61\n120.  The defendants’ failure to develop sufficient community residential services and \nsupports is particularly acute for persons with disabilities from communities of color.  They do \nnot fund or oversee a sufficient number of service providers and agencies to deliver needed \nsupport services in and for these communities.  There is no program to ensure people have \nculturally competent case managers who provide information and opportunities in a manner that \nallows persons with disabilities from diverse communities to make an informed choice whether \nto remain in nursing facilities or return to their communities.  The defendants do not collect or \nreport on relevant data pertaining to the needs, services, capacity, and choices of persons with \ndisabilities from communities of color and linguistically diverse populations. \n(3)  The Failure to Provide Community Services for Persons Diagnosed with \nSMI \n \n121.  For persons with SMI, the Commonwealth, through EOHHS and DMH, fails to: \n(1) accurately identify individuals diagnosed with SMI who are referred to nursing facilities; \n(2) determine if they could be appropriately served in community settings instead of being \nadmitted to nursing facilities; (3) comprehensively assess their need for specialized services; and \n(4) timely provide those services in nursing facilities.  This systematic failure to administer a \nPASRR program that complies with federal law results in the unnecessary institutionalization \nand lack of treatment of persons diagnosed with SMI in nursing facilities. \n122.  By failing to accurately identify and evaluate persons diagnosed with SMI \nreferred to nursing facilities, the Commonwealth’s PASRR program significantly undercounts \nthe number of individuals with SMI and denies them the protections of federal law, the \nopportunity for diversion from unnecessary admission, and the provision of specialized services \nin nursing facilities.  The failure to provide specialized services even to persons who are \n37 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 38 of 61\neventually identified as having SMI results in the lack of active treatment, including those \nservices that would allow them to transition to the community.  \n123.  The defendants have long been aware of the lack of residential and support \nservices, regular in-reach/outreach to provide information about community living, an informed \nchoice process, and case management for persons with disabilities in nursing facilities.  In 2008, \nEOHHS developed, but then abandoned, a comprehensive nursing facility diversion and \ntransition program that would apply to all persons with disabilities.  In 2000, 2008, and 2013, \nEOHHS agreed to comprehensive reforms of its system to divert and transition persons with IDD \nand ABI from nursing facilities, and then created targeted residential and support services, in-\nreach and informed choices processes, and case management programs to implement these \nagreements.  In 2016, it added two new HCBS programs for all persons with disabilities in \nnursing facilities, but limited the annual increase in capacity to 50 residential and 75 non-\nresidential “slots.”  In 2017, it reviewed its Olmstead Plan and decided to focus primarily on \nhomeless persons rather than those unnecessarily institutionalized in nursing facilities who \nneeded residential services and supports to live in the community.  Finally, it collects data every \nquarter of every year which confirms that its PASRR program for persons with SMI virtually \nnever diverts anyone from nursing facility admission and never determines that anyone with SMI \nneeds specialized services. \nE.  The Impact of the Commonwealth’s Failures on the Individual Plaintiffs \n(1)  John Simmons \n124.  John Simmons is a 73-year-old Black man with pulmonary emphysema, HIV, and \na major depressive disorder.  He uses a wheelchair for mobility, but can at times walk with a walker \n38 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 39 of 61\nor cane.  He is knowledgeable, friendly, and very well informed about local and national affairs. \nHe likes meeting and talking with other people.  \n125.  Mr. Simmons has resided at The Rehabilitation & Nursing Center at Everett since \nMarch 11, 2019.  His nursing facility admission occurred following a hospitalization related to \ndepression. \n126.  For many years prior to his placement in a nursing facility, Mr. Simmons lived \nindependently in Boston in his own apartment with a Section 8 voucher that paid part of his rent \nand made his apartment affordable.  He met all of his personal needs without assistance.  He \nspent time with family and friends, occasionally dined out, managed his own funds, did his \nerrands, and attended all his medical appointments.  As a result of his pulmonary emphysema, he \nstruggled to climb the stairs to reach his fourth-floor apartment. \n127.  Following several hospitalizations, Mr. Simmons lost his Section 8 voucher and \nwas not able to get it reinstated.  He then moved in with his sister in Fall River, Massachusetts, \nuntil the hospitalization which led to his nursing facility admission. \n128.  DMH, through its agents at the University of Massachusetts, conducted a Level II \nPASRR for Mr. Simmons in March 2019.  The evaluation concluded that Mr. Simmons did not \nmeet the criteria for mental illness, that the nursing facility was appropriate to meet his needs, \nand that he did not require any specialized services.  Consequently, Mr. Simmons does not \nreceive any specialized mental health services, any active treatment, or any consideration for \ncommunity living.  \n129.  According to Mr. Simmons’ nursing facility records, his mental health has \ndeclined during the time he has resided at the nursing facility.  His depression has increased in \nseverity.  The prospect of not returning to the community has exacerbated his depression. \n39 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 40 of 61\n130.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, the nursing facility imposed social restrictions \nwhich increased Mr. Simmons’ isolation and his psychosocial deterioration.  He indicated to the \nfacility that he wished to spend more time outside because he could not spend time indoors with \nother residents and could not have any visitors, but he was told that he could not go outside.  \nThat restriction currently remains in place.  The facility insisted that he can get fresh air by going \nto an outdoor patio connected to the facility, but since many staff and residents use that area to \nsmoke, that option is not safe due to his pulmonary emphysema.  \n131.  Medical and social services professionals who have worked with Mr. Simmons \nhave described him as mostly independent and clearly appropriate for community living with \nlimited support.  He did get assistance in submitting an application for an MFP waiver in \nOctober 2020, but has been told he is on a long waiting list that extends for years.  \n132.  Mr. Simmons wants to live independently in the community, in or near Boston \nsince that has always been his home and all his long-term medical providers are at Massachusetts \nGeneral Hospital.  He could live independently with just the assistance of a weekly visit from a \nnurse to assist with medication management.  He can cook, shop, clean, and do all the activities \nof daily living which he did prior to his nursing facility admission.  \n(2)  David Marsters \n133.  David Marsters is a 72-year-old white man who was born with a developmental \ndisability. In 2020, he received a new diagnosis of a high-functioning form of autism spectrum \ndisorder.  He is an outgoing, affable person who likes playing guitar, listening to music, rooting \nfor the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team, and collecting baseball caps and hockey jerseys.   \n40 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 41 of 61\n134.  Mr. Marsters was admitted to the Behavioral Unit at Hillcrest Commons Nursing \n& Rehabilitation in October 2016 from a DMH group home in Southwick after being \nhospitalized in several medical facilities. \n135.  Before his placement in a nursing facility, Mr. Marsters lived independently in an \napartment in West Springfield, where he received services from DMH, including a case manager \nand an outreach coordinator through The Carson Center in Westfield.  DMH also provided \ntransportation for medical appointments, grocery shopping, and to the bank for his weekly \nallowance.  Mr. Marsters receives support from his sister, Nancy Pomerleau, in making his own \ndecisions about his medical care, housing, and social activities. \n136.  Mr. Marsters worked as a janitor from the 1970s until he retired around 2014.  \nMr. Marsters was married for a year and a half when his wife died of cancer.  He never \nremarried.  When he lived in his own apartment, he enjoyed listening to music, cleaning and \nmaintaining his apartment, and walking around his neighborhood visiting friends at nearby \nstores.  Mr. Marsters liked to dine out at restaurants and to go to the store to buy magazines, \nhousehold supplies, and his favorite snacks.  \n137.  In 2014, after his mental health deteriorated following severe harassment from the \nbuilding maintenance staff at his apartment in West Springfield, DMH placed Mr. Marsters in \none of its residential programs for 16 months.  In July 2016, DMH transferred him to a respite \nprogram, then to another residential program, and then to several hospitals without his consent or \nhis sister’s knowledge.  DMH eventually placed Mr. Marsters at Hillcrest Commons, a nursing \nfacility in Pittsfield.  Each facility increased his medications, including adding several \npsychotropic drugs which created significant, problematic side effects.  \n41 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 42 of 61\n138.  Although Hillcrest Commons confines Mr. Marsters on a locked unit at the \nfacility, he periodically spends weekends at a family home in West Springfield, where he thrives.  \nThe stress of living in the nursing facility’s locked unit has caused him significant frustration and \nanxiety, and has resulted in a decline in his mental health.  \n139.  In 2016, DMH, in its capacity as the designated PASRR authority, determined \nthat a nursing facility placement for Mr. Marsters was not appropriate. \n140.  A PASRR Level I resident review, conducted by DMH’s agent and dated \nNovember 10, 2020, inaccurately found that Mr. Marsters has no documented diagnosis or \ntreatment history of IDD before age 22.  The review states that Mr. Marsters has mood and \nschizoaffective disorders and that he had one or more inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations.  \nAccordingly, Mr. Marsters received a positive mental health screen but was not identified as ever \nhaving an IDD.  A letter from the PASRR agency, dated November 20, 2020, notified Mr. \nMarsters that its Level II evaluation concluded that he did not meet the PASRR criteria for \nmental illness, and thus no specialized services were required. \n141.  On August 23, 2021, DDS completed a PASRR II evaluation and determined that \nMr. Marsters had IDD, that nursing facility level of services were required, but that no \nspecialized services were needed.  \n142.  Mr. Marsters has at times received occupational, physical, and speech therapy, but \nno ancillary services or specialized PASRR services.  In 2020, his sister successfully advocated \nfor him to leave Hillcrest Commons three days a week and participate in a day program run by \nBerkshire County Arc, though he was unable to start the program until 2021.  While in the \nprogram, Mr. Marsters has thrived when out of the nursing facility and participating in various \ncommunity activities.      \n42 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 43 of 61\n143.  Mr. Marsters wants to live in the community and return to the West Springfield \narea, where he has worked and lived his whole life.   He is able to live in a community residential \nsetting with support. \n(3)  Lorraine Simpson \n144.  Lorraine Simpson is a 63-year-old Black woman with anxiety, depression, \nhypertension, and diabetes.  She is alert, friendly, pleasant. and enjoys talking to people.  She is \nremarkably independent and mobile, and she actively engages with visitors and staff at the \nnursing facility.  Her mother, brother, and two daughters live nearby in Worcester.  \n145.  Ms. Simpson’s grandmother raised her.  When her grandmother died, Ms. \nSimpson fell into a serious depression, and moved in with one of her daughters.  Ms. Simpson’s \ndaughter allegedly misappropriated her SSI checks and dropped her off at a homeless shelter at \nthe end of each month.  Ms. Simpson would return to her daughter’s home, and this pattern \nwould be repeated.  Eventually, Worcester Elder Services conducted an investigation, then \nsought the appointment of a guardian based on Ms. Simpson’s “failure to thrive as an adult.”   \nSara Spooner, Esq. was appointed as the temporary, and then the permanent, guardian in April \n2021.   \n146.  In April 2021, Ms. Simpson was hospitalized at University of Massachusetts \n(UMass) Memorial Hospital in Worcester for her diabetes and related conditions.  The discharge \nsummary from UMass Memorial listed her primary diagnosis as depression, anxiety, \nhypertension, and diabetes.  It did not include dementia as a diagnosis.  \n147.  Nevertheless, on May 6, 2021, when Ms. Simpson was evaluated for admission to \nHermitage Healthcare, the nursing facility administered a Level I PASRR, which claimed that \nshe had dementia and therefore did not meet the criteria for mental illness.  On May 12, 2021, a \n43 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 44 of 61\nLevel II PASRR review by DMH also concluded that Ms. Simpson did not meet the criteria for \nmental illness, allegedly because of having dementia.  As a result of this questionable \ndetermination, which was contrary to her physician’s discharge diagnosis from UMass Memorial \nHospital just days before, DMH did not consider any alternatives to nursing facility admission \nand did not consider her need for specialized services.  Consequently, Ms. Simpson does not \nreceive any mental health services or active treatment in the nursing facility and has not been \nconsidered for community living.  \n148.  Additionally, physician progress notes from Hermitage Healthcare, dated May 12, \n2021, note a failure to thrive, depression and anxiety, but no mention of dementia.  Subsequent \nprogress notes between May 2021 and January 2022 describe only Ms. Simpson’s hypertension, \ndiabetes, and an infection from a cut on her toe.  \n149.  Ms. Simpson has been prescribed psychotropic medications for depression.  Notes \nfrom the nursing facility consistently state that Ms. Simpson is a long-term patient at Hermitage \nwith no plan for community integration, even though in June of 2021, and repeatedly thereafter, \nMs. Simpson stated she wants to leave the facility and move into her own apartment.  \n150.  Ms. Simpson has remained at the facility for over a year due to a lack of \nresidential and support services.  She repeatedly states: “I want to regain my independence.”   \nHer guardian believes that she could live in the community with supervision and supports to \nensure that she is not subject to exploitation.  \n151.  Ms. Simpson desperately wants to live independently in the community, cook her \nown food again, and be close to her family.  On information and belief, no action has been taken \nby DMH to assist her to transition to the community or to apply for HCBS residential services.  \n(4)  Sherri Currin  \n44 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 45 of 61\n152.  Sherri Currin is a 54-year-old white woman with multiple sclerosis who also has \nSMI and a substance use disorder (SUD).  She was admitted to the Marlborough Hills \nRehabilitation and Health Care Center from Clinton Hospital on March 23, 2022.  \n153.  Before entering the nursing facility, Ms. Currin lived with her partner in an \napartment in Marlborough.  She received support services while living in the community, but her \npartner provided the majority of her care.   She also has three adult children. \n154.  Ms. Currin briefly worked as a custodian and secretary at a nail salon but was \nunable to continue working due to her physical health challenges.  She enjoyed living in the \ncommunity with her partner, where they watched their favorite television shows together and \nparticipated in community activities.   She benefited from home health services from the local \nASAP while living in the community.   \n155.  Ms. Currin was admitted to UMass Memorial Hospital in December 2021 for \npsychiatric evaluation, which determined that her severe depression caused a failure to thrive.  A \nguardian was appointed on December 20, 2021, based on her inability to care for herself and \nfailure to take prescribed medication regularly.  \n156.  A PASRR Level I review, dated March 8, 2022, found that Ms. Currin has mental \nillness and a substance use disorder.  Based on the findings of the Level I review, DMH, through \nits agents, conducted a PASRR Level II evaluation on April 8, 2022.  A determination letter from \nDMH, dated April 14, 2022, notified Ms. Currin that she met the criteria for mental illness and \napproved her admission to the nursing facility for 90 days while a plan for transition to the \ncommunity was developed.  The evaluation found that there was no need for specialized \nservices. \n45 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 46 of 61\n157.  A second determination letter from DMH, dated August 3, 2022, reiterated that \nshe met the criteria for mental illness, approved an extension of her stay in the nursing facility \nuntil November 1, 2022, and continued to find that no specialized services were needed.  The \nsecond determination did not include any reason for the extension.   Significantly, Ms. Currin’s \ncondition was noted as “stable and that she was taking her medications per her Care Plan.”   \n158.  Ms. Currin receives occupational and physical therapy, but no specialized PASRR \nservices for her mental illness or SUD.   She uses a wheelchair for mobility and requires supports \nfor activities of daily living, psychiatric supports, and home health care.  \n159.  Ms. Currin wants to return to living in an apartment in Marlborough.   She is able \nto live in a community residential setting with supports (her partner is unable to care for her at \nthis time).  \n(4)  Carole Chojnacki  \n160.  Carole Chojnacki is a 67-year-old white woman who has been diagnosed with \nmental illness, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, \nand difficulty walking.  She was admitted to The Rehabilitation and Nursing Center at Everett on \nApril 4, 2022, following a psychiatric hospitalization.  In the past, Ms. Chojnacki has been \neligible for services through DMH.   \n161.  According to the nursing facility’s medical records, there has never been a \nPASRR Level I or Level II evaluation done for Ms. Chojnacki, either prior to or after her \nadmission to the facility.  The records also indicate that she does not receive any mental health \ncounseling or other behavioral health treatment in the facility other than psychiatric medications.  \nHer guardian is not aware of any mental health treatment provided for Ms. Chojnacki at the \nnursing facility, other than psychiatric medications.  \n46 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 47 of 61\n162.  Ms. Chojnacki wants to live in a less restrictive setting and needs residential \nservices with supports to transition to the community.  Her guardian supports her discharge to a \nsetting that can monitor and manage her mental health behaviors as well as her medical \nconditions, such as a DMH group home or other residential setting designed for people with \nmental health and medical conditions.  DMH currently operates such group homes for adults \nwith these dual needs, on a limited basis, but has not made this program available to Ms. \nChojnacki. \n(5)  Richard Caouette \n163.  Richard Caouette is a 63-year-old white man who has repeatedly expressed his \ndesire to return to the community, which is supported by his guardian and clinical team.   \nNevertheless, he has remained in a segregated nursing facility for years. \n164.  Mr. Caouette has epilepsy, Type 2 diabetes, and SMI.  He was admitted to the \nBear Mountain facility in Worcester on June 30, 2020, after receiving psychiatric care at \nUMASS Memorial Hospital.  Previously, he resided at a nursing facility in Southbridge, \nMassachusetts since November 2019. \n165.  Mr. Caouette is an avid New England Patriots fan, regularly listens to music on \nPandora, and is a talented game player.  He wants to transition to a supported living arrangement \nin or near Worcester so he can go to restaurants, movies, and other community events. \n166.  Mr. Caouette is the youngest of 10 children and has a son, although he is not in \ncontact with his family members.  He was placed under guardianship in May 2020 after suffering \na stroke.  But by March 2021, his Interdisciplinary Care Plan (ICP) described him as alert, stable, \nand capable of verbalizing his needs.  A year later, his plan noted his continued request to be \ntransitioned to the community. \n47 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 48 of 61\n167.  A Level II PASRR evaluation conducted by DMH’s agent in August 2020 \nconcluded that Mr. Caouette did not meet the criteria for mental illness due to unspecified \ndementia and, therefore, he was not entitled to any specialized services. \n168.  Mr. Caouette has continuously expressed his desire to live in the community.  Mr. \nCaouette’s treatment team and his guardian agree that he can live and thrive in the community \nwith residential services and supports.  Nevertheless, he was denied services from the MFP \nwaiver program due to capacity and service limitations, even though waiver services are \nprecisely what he needs to transition to the community. \n(6)  Donald Grant \n169.  Donald Grant is a 63-year-old white man with diabetes, respiratory disease, and \npulmonary issues.  He uses a wheelchair for mobility.  He was a chef for 45 years and enjoyed \ndeep sea fishing before his placement in a nursing facility. \n170.  Mr. Grant initially lived at Odd Fellows Home in Worcester, which conducted a \nPASRR Level I screening in October 2020, leading to a PASRR Level II evaluation by DMH.  \nThe evaluation notice, dated November 3, 2020, did not consider alternatives to a nursing facility \nbut simply approved his admission to the facility.  It also concluded that Mr. Grant did not meet \nthe criteria for mental illness, and therefore was not entitled to any specialized services.   \n171.  Mr. Grant subsequently was admitted to Worcester Rehabilitation and Health \nCare Center on May 29, 2021, following inpatient acute medical care and an evaluation for \nhyperglycemia.  He still resides in that facility.   \n172.  Staff at the Worcester Center requested that Mr. Grant have a psychotherapy \nevaluation due to his history of personality disorder and angry outbursts.  The evaluator \n48 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 49 of 61\ndetermined that Mr. Grant would benefit from therapy to develop appropriate coping \nmechanisms, but this has never been provided. \n173.  Mr. Grant does not want to stay at the nursing facility.  He misses being \nindependent and living in the community.  He would like to transition to a residential setting \nwith supports.  Because of his obesity and related medical challenges, he needs considerable \nassistance with basic health needs and mobility, which should be available through one of the \nCommonwealth’s MFP residential waiver programs. \nVI.  LEGAL CLAIMS \nFirst Claim for Relief \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act \n \n174.  The plaintiffs reallege paragraphs 1 through 173 as though fully set forth herein. \n175.  The individual plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class are qualified \nindividuals with disabilities within the meaning of the ADA.  42 U.S.C. § 12131(2). \n176.  The defendants are “public entities” as defined by Title II of the ADA.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 12131(1). \n177.  Through the acts and omissions described above, the defendants are violating \nTitle II of the ADA in the following ways: \nA.  Integration Mandate \n178.  Title II of the ADA requires that “a public entity shall administer services, \nprograms and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified \nindividuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).   \n179.   The individual plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class qualify for and would \nbenefit from community residential services and supports provided by the defendants’ HCBS \n49 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 50 of 61\nprograms.  Although community programs are the most integrated setting appropriate to meet \ntheir needs, the individual plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class remain unnecessarily \ninstitutionalized in nursing facilities due to the defendants’ failure to provide them timely access \nto existing community residential services and support programs, and by requiring them to be \nconfined in segregated institutional settings in order to receive essentially the same care, in \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 12132.  \nB.  Methods of Administration \n180.  Title II of the ADA requires that “a public entity may not, directly or through \ncontractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or other methods of administration: (i) that \nhave the effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis \nof disability; [or] (ii) that have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing \naccomplishment of the objectives of the entity's program with respect to individuals with \ndisabilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3). \n181.  The defendants have developed and utilize criteria and methods of administration \nfor the Commonwealth’s long-term care system for persons with disabilities that exclude the \nindividual plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class from timely access to residential services \nand supports integrated in the community, which results in their unnecessary institutionalization \nand unjustified segregation on the basis of their disability, including, inter alia, failing to inform \nthem of the community residential services and supports that would enable them to reside in an \nintegrated setting; failing to assess them for community residential services and supports; failing \nto offer them a meaningful and informed choice of community residential services and supports; \nand failing to afford them equal access to community residential services and supports on the \nbasis of their disability, all in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n50 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 51 of 61\nC.  Eligibility Criteria  \n182.  Title II of the ADA requires that that a public entity “not impose or apply \neligibility criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or any class \nof individuals with disabilities from fully and equally enjoying any service program, or activity, \nunless such criteria can be shown to be necessary for the provision of the service, program, or \nactivity being offered.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(8). \n183.  The defendants have developed and implemented eligibility criteria for their long-\nterm care system, and specifically for their HCBS programs, that screen out or tend to screen out \nthe individual plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class who are residing in nursing facilities \nfrom gaining access to or enjoying community residential services and supports, in violation of \n42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n184.  The defendants have failed to provide community residential services and \nsupports to the individual plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class in nursing facilities that \nwould allow them to transition to integrated settings in the community, even though the \nCommonwealth provides residential services and supports to individuals with IDD and ABI that \nhave resulted in their successful transition to the community, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \nD.  Reasonable Modifications \n185.  Title II of the ADA requires that a public entity “make reasonable modifications \nin policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination \non the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications \nwould fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.”  28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.130(7)(i). \n51 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 52 of 61\n186.  The defendants have failed to make reasonable modifications to their policies, \npractices, or procedures that would allow the individual plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff \nclass to obtain the integrated community residential services and supports necessary to avoid \nunnecessary institutionalization in nursing facilities, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n187.  The defendants have failed to provide adequate information, opportunities, and \nexperiences necessary to allow the individual plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class to \nmake an informed choice whether to remain in a segregated institution or transition to an \nintegrated community setting, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n188.  The defendants have failed to make reasonable accommodations to individual \nplaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class whose condition, disability, or unnecessary \ninstitutionalization impacts their ability to make an informed choice about community living, in \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n189.  It would not fundamentally alter the nature of the defendants’ programs, services, \nor activities to provide the individual plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class with the \ncommunity residential services and supports necessary to allow them to live in the community. \nSecond Claim for Relief \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \n190.  The plaintiffs reallege paragraphs 1 through 189 as though fully set forth herein. \n191.  The individual plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class are qualified \nindividuals with disabilities under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  \n192.  The Commonwealth and EOHHS are recipients of federal financial assistance \nsubject to the requirements of Section 504.  \n52 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 53 of 61\n193.  Section 504 requires that recipients of federal financial assistance “administer \nprograms and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified \nhandicapped persons.”  28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d). \n194.  Section 504 also prohibits recipients of federal financial assistance from \n“utiliz[ing] criteria or methods of administration ... (i) [t]hat have the effect of subjecting \nhandicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap; [or] (ii) that have the purpose or \neffect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the recipient’s \nprogram with respect to handicapped persons.”  28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3); 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b). \n195.  The individual plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class qualify for and would \nbenefit from community residential services and supports provided by the defendants’ HCBS \nprograms. Although community programs are the most integrated setting appropriate to meet \ntheir needs, the individual plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class remain unnecessarily \ninstitutionalized in nursing facilities due to the defendants’ failure to provide them timely access \nto existing community residential services and support programs, and by requiring them to be \nconfined in segregated institutional settings in order to receive essentially the same care, in \nviolation of Section 504. \n196.  The defendants have developed and utilize criteria and methods of administration \nfor the Commonwealth’s long-term care system for persons with disabilities that have the \npurpose and effect of subjecting the individual plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class to \nunnecessary institutionalization and unjustified segregation on the basis of their disability, \nincluding, inter alia, failing to inform them of the community residential services and supports \nthat would enable them to reside in an integrated setting; failing to assess them for community \nresidential services and supports; failing to offer them a meaningful and informed choice of \n53 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 54 of 61\ncommunity residential services and supports; and failing to afford them equal access to \nappropriate residential services and supports on the basis of their disability, all in violation of \nSection 504. \n197.  The defendants have developed and implemented eligibility criteria for their long-\nterm care system that screen out or tend to screen out the individual plaintiffs and members of \nthe plaintiff class who are residing in nursing facilities from gaining access to or enjoying \ncommunity residential services and supports, in violation of Section 504. \n198.  The defendants have failed to provide community residential services and \nsupports to the individual plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class in nursing facilities that \nwould allow them to transition to integrated settings in the community, even though the \nCommonwealth provides these residential services and supports to individuals with IDD and \nABI that have resulted in their successful transition to the community, in violation of Section \n504. \n199.  The defendants have failed to make reasonable modifications to their policies, \npractices, or procedures that would allow the individual plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff \nclass to obtain the integrated community residential services and supports necessary to avoid \nunnecessary institutionalization in nursing facilities, in violation of Section 504. \n200.  The defendants have failed to provide adequate information, opportunities, and \nexperiences necessary to allow the individual plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class to \nmake an informed choice whether to remain in a segregated institution or whether to transition to \nan integrated community setting, in violation of Section 504. \n201.  The defendants have failed to make reasonable accommodations to individual \nplaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class whose condition, disability, or unnecessary \n54 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 55 of 61\ninstitutionalization impacts their ability to make an informed choice about community living, in \nviolation of Section 504. \n202.  It would not fundamentally alter the nature of the defendants’ programs, services, \nor activities to provide the individual plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class with the \ncommunity residential services and supports necessary to allow them to live in the community. \nThird Claim for Relief \nReasonable Promptness Provision of the Medicaid Act  \n \n203.  The plaintiffs reallege paragraphs 1 through 202 as though fully set forth herein. \n204.  Title XIX of the Social Security Act requires States to provide Medicaid benefits \nto all eligible persons with reasonable promptness and for as long as medically necessary.  42 \nU.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(8), 1396a(a)(10)(A).  Provision of services must not be delayed by the \nagencies’ administrative procedures.  42 C.F.R § 435.930(a). \n205.  The defendants’ arbitrary policies, which limit the provision of medically \nnecessary community residential services and supports, as well as medically necessary \nspecialized services, result in extended delays and the outright denial of medically necessary care \nto the plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class.  The community residential services and \nsupport, as well as specialized services that the plaintiff subclass needs, are not provided with \nreasonable promptness, in violation of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(8). \nFourth Claim for Relief \nFreedom of Choice Provision of the Medicaid Act \n \n206.  The plaintiffs reallege paragraphs 1 through 205 as though fully set forth herein. \n207.  Title XIX of the Social Security Act requires States to provide Medicaid-eligible \npersons who qualify for their HCBS programs with a choice of living in an institution, like a \n55 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 56 of 61\nsegregated nursing facility, or in a community residence in an integrated setting.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396n(c)(2)(B) & (C). \n208.  The defendants have failed to provide residents of nursing facilities with  \ndisabilities with: 1) notice of and equal opportunities to apply for and access medically necessary \ncommunity residential services and supports; 2) an assessment of their eligibility for such \nservices; and 3) adequate information, opportunities, and experiences necessary to allow the \nindividual plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class to make an informed choice whether to \nremain in a segregated institution or whether to transition to an integrated community setting, in \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(2)(B) & (C). \nFifth Claim for Relief \nNursing Home Reform Amendments \nOn behalf of the PASRR Subclass Only \n209.  The plaintiffs reallege paragraphs 1 through 208 as though fully set forth herein. \nA.  Screening, Assessment and Placement \n210.  The NHRA requires that States develop and implement a PASRR program for all \napplicants to, and residents of, Medicaid-certified nursing facilities who are suspected of having \nan SMI or IDD. 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(e)(7); 42 C.F.R. § 483.100 et seq.  Each State’s PASRR \nprogram must accurately identify persons with SMI, determine if they could be served in an \nalternative setting to a nursing facility, assess whether they need specialized services for the \nSMI, and then ensure that such services are provided promptly.  42 U.S.C. §§ 1396r(b)(3)(F)(i), \n1396r(e)(7)(A)&(B); 42 C.F.R. § 483.112, 483.116, 483.120. \n211.  The defendants have failed to develop and implement a PASRR program that \naccurately screens nursing facility applicants for mental illness, assesses whether their needs \ncould be met in an alternative, less restrictive setting than a nursing facility, and advises them of \n56 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 57 of 61\nthe available alternatives to nursing facilities, all in violation of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396r(b)(3)(F)(i) \nand 1396r(e)(7)(A) & (B). \nB.  Specialized Services \n212.  The Level II PASRR assessment must determine whether a person with SMI \nrequires specialized services and, if so, must provide those specialized services in the nursing \nfacility.  42 U.S.C. § 1396r(e)(7)(B)(i)(II) & (C); 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.112(b), 483.114(a)(2), \n483.116(b)(2), 483.120(b). \n213.  Specialized services for individuals with mental illness must include all services \nwhich are needed to implement “a continuous and aggressive … individualized plan of care” \nthat, inter alia, “is directed toward diagnosing and reducing the resident’s behavioral symptoms \nthat necessitated institutionalization, improving his or her level of independent functioning, and \nachieving a functioning level that permits reduction in the intensity of mental health services to \nbelow the level of specialized services at the earliest possible time.”  42 C.F.R. § 483.120(a)(i). \n214.  The defendants’ failure to comprehensively assess the need for specialized \nservices of the individual plaintiffs diagnosed with SMI and members of the plaintiff subclass, \nand the defendants’ failure to provide them with the full range of needed specialized services and \nactive treatment, violates the NHRA, 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(e)(7).  \nVII.  PRAYERS FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, the plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \n1.   Certify this case as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23;  \n2.    Grant permanent injunctive relief to remedy the defendants’ violation of the \nADA, Section 504, the Medicaid Act, and the NHRA, including requiring the defendants to: \n57 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 58 of 61\n(a)  Provide culturally competent community residential services and supports \nin the most integrated setting for the individual plaintiffs and members of the \nplaintiff class, consistent with their individual needs, sufficient to avoid \nunnecessary institutionalization in nursing facilities in Massachusetts, and ensure \nthat services for persons with disabilities from communities of color are designed \nto be responsive to the needs of their communities; \n(b)   Provide culturally competent case management services to plan, \ncoordinate, and monitor transition services, provide information and opportunities \nfor the individual plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class to learn about \ncommunity living, and facilitate their transition into integrated settings in the \ncommunity; \n(c)  Develop and implement a culturally competent informed choice and in-\nreach process that allows the individual plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff \nclass to make an informed choice whether to remain in a segregated nursing \nfacility; \n(d)  Make reasonable modifications to the policies, practices, rules, and \nrequirements regarding the eligibility for and administration of the defendants’ \nlong-term care system in order to ensure that the individual plaintiffs and \nmembers of the plaintiff class receive the community residential services and \nsupports needed to reside safely in integrated settings; \n(e)  Conduct comprehensive PASRR screens and assessments of the individual \nplaintiffs with SMI and members of the plaintiff subclass to determine whether \n58 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 59 of 61\ntheir needs could be appropriately met in a more integrated setting than a nursing \nfacility and determine if they would benefit from specialized services;   \n(f)  Provide the array of needed culturally competent specialized services and \nactive treatment to individual plaintiffs with SMI and members of the plaintiff \nsubclass; and  \n(g)  Collect and use information, to monitor, adjust, and improve the \nmodifications to the defendants’ long-term care system, including the type and \nseverity of disability, and the race and ethnicity of members of the plaintiff class; \n3.  Issue a declaratory judgment declaring that:  \n(a)  The defendants have violated the ADA and Section 504 by failing to \nprovide the individual plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class with \ncommunity residential services and supports in the most integrated setting, \nresulting in their needless institutionalization in nursing facilities; \n(b)  The defendants have violated the Medicaid Act by failing to provide \ncommunity residential services and supports for persons with disabilities in \nnursing facilities, and specialized services for persons with SMI, with reasonable \npromptness;   \n(c)  The defendants have violated the Medicaid Act by failing to provide \npersons with disabilities with culturally competent information and an informed \nchoice of whether to receive services in segregated nursing facilities or more \nintegrated settings in the community; and \n(d)  The defendants have violated the NHRA by: i) failing to properly screen \nand assess PASRR subclass members’ ability to reside in a less restrictive, more \n59 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715   Document 1   Filed 10/11/22   Page 60 of 61\nintegrated setting than a nursing facility; ii) inappropriately placing PASRR \nsubclass members in nursing facilities; iii) failing to assess PASRR subclass \nmembers’ need for specialized services; and iv) failing to provide PASRR \nsubclass members with specialized services, including active treatment; \n4.  Award plaintiffs their reasonable attorneys’ fees, litigation expenses, and costs \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1988 & 12205 and 29 U.S.C. § 794a; and  \n5.  Grant such other relief which is necessary and proper to protect the federal rights \nof the individual plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \n/s/ Steven J.

 \n \n  It is THEREFORE agreed as follows:  \n \nI.  Purpose \n1.  The purpose of this Settlement Agreement is to facilitate the transition of qualified \nnursing facility residents with disabilities to community settings by providing enhanced in-reach, \ninformation, and assistance to help them make informed choices about whether to leave their \nnursing facilities; and by providing expanded residential services, supports, and transition \nassistance to enable them to live in the most integrated setting. \nII.  Nursing Facility In-Reach, Informed Choice, and Transition Planning  \n2.  The Defendants shall implement an expanded nursing facility in-reach, informed \nchoice, and transition planning effort that utilizes EOEA’s Community Transition Liaison \nProgram (“CTLP”), the Commonwealth’s Money Follows the Person Demonstration (“MFP \nDemo”), and the Department of Mental Health’s (“DMH’s”) Pre-Admission Screening and \nResident Review (“PASRR”) program, as described in Paragraphs 3 through 35 of this Section. \nA.  In-Reach, Informed Choice, and Transition Planning Provided Through EOEA’s \nCommunity Transition Liaison Program \n3.  EOHHS, through EOEA, shall operate a CTLP that will offer in-reach, informed \nchoice, and transition support to individuals in nursing facilities who are or may be interested in \ntransitioning to the community.  The program shall be available to all nursing facility residents \nages 22 or older regardless of the individual’s diagnosis or insurance type.   \n4.  EOEA shall be responsible for the overall operation and performance of the CTLP \nand shall establish, fund, and fill a full-time position for a qualified person to oversee the CTLP \nprogram.  \n5.  EOEA shall assign, fund, and oversee CTLP teams through contracts with the \nCommonwealth’s Aging Service Access Points (“ASAPs”).  Each CTLP team shall be comprised \nof a full-time Community Transition Liaison (“CTL”) and a full-time Case Assistant (“CA”), as \ndescribed in EOEA’s contracts with participating ASAPs.  EOEA’s contracts with the ASAPs \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 5 of 54\n \nshall specify that ASAP staff employed as a CTL or as a CA shall not be utilized by the ASAP to \nperform other ASAP functions unrelated to CTLP.   \n6.  To ensure statewide coverage of CTLP teams, each Medicaid-participating \nnursing facility located in Massachusetts shall have at least one assigned CTLP team.  In Year \nOne of this Agreement there shall be at least 45 CTLP teams.   \n7.  Each CTLP team shall be responsible for providing CTLP in-reach and transition \nactivities in their assigned nursing facilities.  Each CTLP team shall be required to visit each of \ntheir assigned nursing facilities at least once per week and meet with individuals as necessary to \nprovide CTLP in-reach, informed choice, and transition planning assistance. CTLP in-reach and \ninformed choice activities will not be based on a medical model and will not depend on requests \nfrom nursing facility residents, but instead, CTLP teams shall proactively engage, and continue \nto engage, with nursing facility residents. In performing in-reach and transition activities, CTLP \nteams shall focus their efforts toward individuals other than those individuals who are admitted \nfor short-term rehabilitation stays of 45 days or less, or who have an assigned case manager from \nthe Department of Developmental Services (“DDS”), DMH, or the Massachusetts Rehabilitation \nCommission, or through the MFP Demo, regardless of the individual’s insurance type.  \n8.  CTLP in-reach activities will include engaging with individuals to ascertain their \nstrengths, needs, and preferences concerning transition; providing information and education \nabout transition options; offering opportunities to visit community programs and service \nproviders, including arranging for transportation to community settings; offering opportunities to \nmeet with peers and families who have transitioned and arranging such meetings, as applicable; \nand addressing barriers and concerns about transition, including sociocultural barriers to \ntransition (e.g., barriers related to varying perspectives about illness or fears and concerns about \nmedications). \n9.  CTLP transition activities shall include referring nursing facility residents to state \nagencies, community programs, service providers, housing organizations, and other community \nsupports; assisting in locating, applying for, and qualifying for community services and housing \noptions; assisting individuals who are initially deemed ineligible for public or subsidized housing \nin appealing those determinations and/or referring those individuals to housing advocacy \norganizations such as legal services programs, as applicable; participating in transition planning; \ncoordinating activities necessary to accomplish a successful transition to the community; and \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 6 of 54\n \nhelping residents obtain and/or providing small amounts of funding to obtain items necessary to \nfacilitate transition (e.g., a government-issued identification document).   \n10.  EOEA shall ensure that, in providing in-reach, informed choice, and transition \nassistance, CTLP teams provide culturally and linguistically competent services to all nursing \nfacility residents.  EOEA shall incorporate within the ASAP contract a requirement to engage in \nemployment practices designed to recruit CTLP team members with the skills and knowledge to \nmeet the cultural and linguistic needs of residents in the ASAP’s region and to ensure CTLP \nteams have supervisory support with expertise in culturally and linguistically competent service \ndelivery.  EOEA shall ensure that ASAPs provide initial and on-going training in the provision of \nculturally and linguistically competent services to CTLP staff, including persons supervising \nCTLs and CAs.  EOEA shall ensure that ASAPs employ and train a sufficient number of CTLs \nand CAs to ensure the provision of timely and effective culturally and linguistically competent \nin-reach, informed choice, and transition assistance by CTLP teams. \n11.  All training on providing culturally and linguistically competent services provided \npursuant to Paragraph 10, above, shall be based on and consistent with the National Standards \nfor Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (“CLAS”).    \n12.  EOEA shall develop an informed choice policy that ensures that individuals \nassisted by CTLP teams are provided with reasonable accommodation for cognitive impairments \nor other challenges to allow participation in decision-making to the fullest extent possible.  \nEOEA’s informed choice policy shall recognize an individual’s right to participate and act on \ntheir own behalf and acknowledge an individual’s right to consult with and include chosen \nsupporters but shall also recognize the authority of guardians in situations where an individual \nhas a guardian.  Nothing in the informed choice policy shall conflict with Massachusetts laws. \nEOEA shall provide drafts of any such policy to Plaintiffs’ counsel for review and comment.  \n13.  Within one year of the Approval Date, and then on at least an annual basis \nthereafter, EOEA shall assess the number of CTLP teams and their capacity to provide timely \nand effective in-reach, informed choice, and transition support to nursing facility residents who \nare or may be interested in transitioning to the community and adjust the number of CTLP teams \nas necessary to meet the requirements of this section of this Agreement.  EOEA shall provide a \ncopy of its annual assessment for informational purposes only to counsel for the parties within \nthirty (30) days of its completion.    \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 7 of 54\n \n14.  EOEA shall develop program specifications, agency directives, and/or contract \nrequirements that incorporate the provisions and responsibilities set forth in this Agreement and \nshall provide drafts of any such documents to Plaintiffs’ counsel for review and comment.   \n15.  EOHHS, through a MassHealth Bulletin (a “Bulletin”), shall inform nursing \nfacilities of the CTLP program and their obligation to provide CTLP teams with timely \ninformation about and reasonable access to nursing facility residents.  The Bulletin shall further \ninform nursing facilities that they will be subject to sanction pursuant to 130 CMR 450.238-240 \nfor noncompliance with the requirements set forth in the Bulletin.  Any proposed Bulletin, or any \nproposed revisions or updates to existing Bulletins, to be sent after the Approval Date of this \nAgreement to nursing facilities regarding the CTLP program shall be provided to Plaintiffs’ counsel \nfor review and comment prior to distribution.   \n16.  EOEA shall maintain and continue to fund the CTLP for the term of this \nAgreement. \nB.  In-Reach, Informed Choice, and Transition Planning Provided Through the \nMassachusetts Money Follows the Person Demonstration \n17.  EOHHS shall implement the Commonwealth’s federal MFP Demo, as already \napproved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and shall provide in-reach, \ninformed choice, and transition assistance to individuals who have been admitted to a nursing \nfacility for sixty (60) days or longer, who are or could be eligible for MassHealth Standard or \nCommonHealth, and who are or may be interested in transitioning to the community.  Nothing in \nthis paragraph shall be construed as a limitation on the number of transitions to be facilitated by \nthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts under this Agreement.  \n18.  EOHHS through the MFP Demo shall: (1) provide information about community \nliving options that could be accessed through the MFP Demo; (2) engage individuals (and \nguardians, if any) in discussions about community living; (3) address concerns regarding the \ntransition from a nursing facility to the community, including sociocultural barriers to transition \n(e.g., barriers related to varying perspectives about illness or fears and concerns about \nmedications); (4) assist individuals in executing an MFP Informed Consent form to enroll in the \nMFP Demo; (5) assist individuals enrolled in the MFP Demo in applying for a Medicaid Home \nand Community-Based Services (HCBS) waiver or other MassHealth long-term service and \nsupports; (6) assist individuals enrolled in the MFP Demo in locating, applying for, and \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 8 of 54\n \nqualifying for housing options; and (7) offer and arrange for visits to community living programs \nfor individuals enrolled in the MFP Demo if they (or their guardian, if any) continue to express \nconcerns about or a lack of familiarity with community living programs and are willing to visit a \ncommunity program. \n19.  EOHHS through MassHealth shall ensure that persons providing MFP Demo in-\nreach, informed choice, and transition assistance who are employed by a state agency or an \nASAP provide culturally and linguistically competent in-reach, informed choice, and transition \nassistance to MFP Demo enrollees.  EOHHS shall require employment practices for such \nindividuals providing MFP Demo in-reach, informed choice, and transition assistance that are \ndesigned to recruit persons with the skills and knowledge to meet the cultural and linguistic \nneeds of nursing facility residents, that such persons receive initial and on-going training in the \nprovision of culturally and linguistically competent supports and that such persons have \nsupervisory support with expertise in culturally and linguistically competent service delivery. \n20.  All training on providing culturally and linguistically competent services provided \npursuant to Paragraph 19 above shall be based on and consistent with the National Standards for \nCLAS.    \n21.  EOHHS through MassHealth shall develop an informed choice policy that ensures \nthat MFP Demo enrollees are provided with reasonable accommodation for cognitive \nimpairments or other challenges to allow participation in decision-making to the fullest extent \npossible.  EOHHS’s informed choice policy for the MFP Demo shall recognize an individual’s \nright to participate and act on their own behalf and acknowledge an individual’s right to consult \nwith and include chosen supporters but shall also recognize the authority of guardians in \nsituations where an individual has a guardian.  Nothing in the informed choice policy shall \nconflict with Massachusetts laws.  EOHHS shall provide drafts of any such policy to Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel for review and comment.  \n22.  EOHHS through MassHealth shall develop program specifications, agency \ndirectives, and/or contract requirements that incorporate the provisions and responsibilities set forth \nin this Agreement and provide drafts of any such documents to Plaintiffs’ counsel for review and \ncomment.  \n23.  EOHHS, through a Bulletin, shall inform nursing facilities of the nursing \nfacilities’  obligations under the MFP Demo, including the obligation to provide MFP Demo staff \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 9 of 54\n \nwith timely information about and reasonable access to nursing facility residents.  The Bulletin \nshall further inform nursing facilities that they will be subject to sanction pursuant to 130 CMR \n450.238-240 for noncompliance with the requirements set forth in the Bulletin.  Any proposed \nBulletin, or any proposed revisions or updates to existing Bulletins, to be sent after the Approval \nDate of this Agreement to nursing facilities regarding the MFP Demo shall be provided to Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel for review and comment prior to distribution.   \n24.  EOHHS shall continue to seek federal authority to operate the MFP Demo for the \nterm of this Agreement.

DMH shall continue to: (1) screen and evaluate all people suspected of having  \n“serious mental illness” as that term is defined in the PASRR regulations set forth at 42 CFR \n§ 483.102 (hereinafter, “PASRR SMI”); and (2) ensure that this process accurately determines \n(a) whether the individual has PASRR SMI, (b) whether the individual needs specialized \nservices, and (c) where the individual is residing in a nursing facility, whether the individual’s \nneeds can be met in an appropriate community setting.  Nothing herein shall be construed to \nlimit the applicability of: (i) exempted hospital discharges as set forth in 42 CFR § 483.106(b), \nand (ii) categorical determinations, as set forth in 42 CFR § 483.130 and as designated by the \nCommonwealth. \n26.  Although not required by federal or state statutory and regulatory requirements, \nDMH shall conduct annual resident reviews, using the standard Level II evaluation instrument, \nof all persons in nursing facilities who were determined to have PASRR SMI at any point \nduring their current nursing facility admission.   \n27.  DMH has, and shall continue to implement, expanded authorization for DMH-\nfunded services and supports as described in 104 CMR 29.04(6) to all nursing facility residents \nwho were determined by the Level II evaluation to have PASRR SMI at any point during their \ncurrent nursing facility admission.  In addition, by July 1, 2024, DMH shall identify all nursing \nfacility residents who were determined by a Level II evaluation to no longer have PASRR SMI \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 10 of 54\n \nduring their current nursing facility admission and provide them with an annual review \nutilizing the Level II evaluation instrument consistent with Paragraph 26 above. \n28.  Pursuant to 104 CMR 29.04(6), DMH shall offer a DMH case manager and \nprovide case management services for transition assistance to nursing facility residents who \nhave had a positive Level II PASRR SMI determination at any point during their current \nnursing facility admission and who are or may be interested in transitioning to the community \nwith DMH supports. \n29.  DMH transition case management shall be provided by a dedicated nursing \nfacility team that shall have reasonable caseloads sufficient to provide timely and effective \ntransition case management services.  Within one year of the Approval Date of this Agreement \nand annually thereafter, DMH shall assess the number and capacity of its dedicated nursing \nfacility case manager staff to provide timely and effective transition case management services \nand shall adjust the number of case managers to meet the requirements of Paragraphs 28-32. \nDMH shall provide a copy of its annual assessment for informational purposes only to counsel \nfor the parties within thirty (30) days of its completion.  \n30.  DMH’s dedicated nursing facility case managers shall meet with each resident \nreceiving transition case management at least monthly, and more often as necessary, to \ndevelop, implement, and monitor a DMH transition plan, and to assist in identifying, locating, \nand obtaining needed community residential services and supports.  In providing transition \ncase management, DMH transition case managers shall explore and address nursing facility \nresident concerns, as applicable, regarding their transition from a nursing facility to the \ncommunity, including sociocultural barriers to transition (e.g., barriers related to varying \nperspectives about illness or fears and concerns about medications).  \n31.  EOHHS, through DMH, shall ensure that its dedicated nursing facility transition \ncase managers provide culturally and linguistically competent services.  DMH shall implement \nemployment practices for the dedicated nursing facility transition team that are designed to \nrecruit persons with the skills and knowledge to meet the cultural and linguistic needs of nursing \nfacility residents, provide initial and on-going training in the provision of culturally and \nlinguistically competent services to its nursing facility transition case manager staff, and to \nensure nursing facility transition managers have supervisory support with expertise in culturally \nand linguistically competent service delivery.  DMH shall employ and train a sufficient number \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 11 of 54\n \nof nursing facility transition case managers to ensure the provision of timely, culturally, and \nlinguistically competent transition case management services.    \n32.  All training on providing culturally and linguistically competent services provided \npursuant to Paragraph 31, above, shall be based on and consistent with the National Standards \nfor CLAS.    \n33.  DMH shall develop an informed choice policy that ensures that nursing facility \nresidents receiving DMH transition case management services are provided with reasonable \naccommodations for cognitive impairments or other challenges to allow participation in \ndecision-making to the fullest extent possible.  DMH’s informed choice policy shall recognize an \nindividual’s right to participate and act on their own behalf and acknowledge an individual’s \nright to consult with and include chosen supporters but shall also recognize the authority of \nguardians in situations where an individual has a guardian.  Nothing in the informed choice \npolicy shall conflict with Massachusetts laws.  DMH shall provide drafts of any such policy to \nPlaintiffs’ counsel for review and comment.   \n34.  EOHHS, through a Bulletin, shall inform nursing facilities of their requirements \nunder the PASRR program, including the obligation of nursing facilities to provide PASRR \nevaluators and DMH case managers with timely information about and reasonable access to \nresidents with PASRR SMI.  The Bulletin shall further inform nursing facilities that they will be \nsubject to sanction pursuant to 130 CMR 450.238-240 for noncompliance with the requirements \nset forth in the Bulletin.  Any proposed Bulletin, or any proposed revisions or updates to existing \nBulletins, to be sent to nursing facilities regarding the PASRR SMI program after the Approval Date \nshall be provided to Plaintiffs’ counsel for review and comment prior to distribution.   \n35.  DMH shall maintain and continue to fund the PASRR program as described in \nthis Agreement for the term of this Agreement. \nIII.  Coordination of Behavioral Health Services, Including Specialized Services, for \nMassHealth Members with PASRR SMI in Nursing Facilities  \n36.  The Defendants shall offer behavioral health care coordination provided \nthrough Behavioral Health Community Partners (BH CPs) to nursing facility residents with \nPASRR SMI and to nursing facility residents with a history of having been determined to have \nPASRR SMI by a Level II review under the State’s PASRR program at any point during their \ncurrent nursing facility admission, who are expected to reside in a nursing facility for longer \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 12 of 54\n \nthan 90 days.  For MassHealth members enrolled in Senior Care Options (“SCO”) or the One \nCare program (“One Care”), behavioral health care coordination is provided through the \nmembers’ SCO or One-Care plan, instead of through a BH CP.  \n37.  BH CPs through their BH CP Care Coordinator staff shall be responsible for \ndeveloping, coordinating, and monitoring a behavioral health care plan for participating \nnursing facility residents as described in Section III of this Agreement. \n38.  BH CP Care Coordinators shall conduct an in-person comprehensive \nassessment for each of their assigned nursing facility clients.  BH CP Care Coordinators shall \ndevelop, monitor, and modify as necessary an individualized behavioral health care plan \n(“Care Plan”) that includes all specialized services, behavioral health, and rehabilitative \nservices identified in the PASRR Level II evaluation, as well as other needs identified through \nthe comprehensive assessment.  BH CPs shall be responsible for making any necessary \nreferrals and coordinating those referrals for the provision of the services identified in the Care \nPlan.  BH CPs shall be required to offer their nursing facility clients an in-person visit monthly \nand must complete an in-person visit with their clients quarterly (and make phone \ncalls/telehealth visits as appropriate between in-person visits).  Within one year of the \nApproval Date, EOHHS shall implement contract updates to the SCO and One Care contracts \nto implement similar requirements for SCO and One Care.  During the year after the Approval \nDate, EOHHS will make reasonable efforts to encourage SCO and One Care to provide timely \nand appropriate behavioral health coordination consistent with this Paragraph.     \n39.  BH CPs shall ensure that they provide culturally and linguistically competent \nsupports.  BH CPs shall implement employment practices for BH CP Care Coordinators that \nare designed to recruit persons with the skills and knowledge to meet the cultural and linguistic \nneeds of individuals they will serve, provide BH CP Care Coordinators with initial and on-\ngoing training in the provision of culturally and linguistically competent supports, and ensure \nBH CP Care Coordinators have supervisory support with expertise in culturally and \nlinguistically competent service delivery.   \n40.  All training on providing culturally and linguistically competent services \nprovided pursuant to Paragraph 39 above shall be based on and consistent with the National \nStandards for CLAS.    \n41.  EOHHS, in collaboration with DMH, shall oversee and monitor the BH CP’s \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 13 of 54\n \nimplementation of the activities set forth in Paragraphs 37-40 above.  Within one year of the \nApproval Date, and thereafter on an annual basis, EOHHS together with DMH shall assess the \nBH CP’s staffing capacity to provide BH CP care coordination to nursing facility residents as \ndescribed in Paragraphs 37-40 above, and shall adjust BH CP contractual staffing requirements \nas appropriate.  EOHHS shall provide a copy of this annual assessment for informational \npurposes only to counsel for the parties within thirty (30) days of its completion.   \n42.  The Defendants established a new PASRR Specialized Service for persons with \nPASRR SMI called “Clubhouse Services” (“Clubhouse”).  Clubhouse is a psychosocial \nrehabilitation service that provides daily activities organized around a set structure.  Clubhouse \nservice components address an individual’s goals related to community linkages, employment, \neducation, life skills, housing, health and wellness, socialization, and recreation.  Nursing \nfacility residents with a PASRR determination of PASRR SMI or with a history of PASRR \nSMI during their current nursing facility admission will be authorized to receive the service \nwhen recommended pursuant to a PASRR Level II evaluation or when included in a behavioral \nhealth care plan as described in Paragraph 38. \n43.  EOHHS shall develop a decision-making policy that ensures that individuals \nreceiving BH CP care coordination are provided with reasonable accommodation for cognitive \nimpairments or other challenges to allow participation in the care planning process to the \nfullest extent possible.  EOHHS’s decision-making policy shall recognize an individual’s right \nto participate and act on their own behalf and acknowledge an individual’s right to consult with \nand include chosen supporters but shall also recognize the authority of guardians in situations \nwhere an individual has a guardian.  Nothing in the decision-making policy shall conflict with \nMassachusetts laws.  EOHHS shall provide drafts of any such policy to Plaintiffs’ counsel for \nreview and comment.   \n44.  EOHHS, through a Bulletin, shall inform nursing facilities of their obligations \nunder the BH CP program, including the obligation to provide BH CPs and providers of \nbehavioral health services with timely information about and reasonable access to residents. \nThe Bulletin shall further inform nursing facilities that they will be subject to sanction pursuant \nto 130 CMR 450.238-240 for noncompliance with the requirements set forth in the Bulletin.  \nAny proposed Bulletin, or any proposed revisions or updates to existing Bulletins, to be sent after \nthe Approval Date of this Agreement to nursing facilities regarding the BH CP program shall be \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 14 of 54\n \nprovided to Plaintiffs’ counsel for review and comment prior to distribution.  \n45.  EOHHS and DMH shall maintain and continue to fund the BH CP program for \nthe term of this Agreement. \nIV.  Residential Services and Housing Supports Capacity  \nA.  Expansion of Residential Services Capacity \n46.  EOHHS, through its MassHealth program, shall expand the Residential Services \ncapacity in its Moving Forward Plan-Residential Supports (MFP-RS) waiver by adding 400 slots \nto the waiver program over the term of this Agreement.  For purposes of this Agreement, \n“Residential Services” is defined as services delivered in a provider-operated setting that \nprovides 24 hours per day, 7 days per week supervision and support, such as in a DDS-operated \ngroup home or Shared Living environment. \n47.  DMH shall increase DMH Group Living Environments (GLEs) by a minimum of \n200 beds over the term of this Agreement.  DMH shall make reasonable efforts to increase DMH \nGroup Living Environments (GLEs) by an additional 200 beds over the term of this Agreement.  \nB.  Expansion of Non-Residential Services Capacity With Housing Supports \n48.  EOHHS, through its MassHealth program, shall expand its Moving Forward Plan-\nCommunity Living (“MFP-CL”) waiver program by adding 595 slots to the waiver program over \nthe term of this Agreement. \n49.  DMH shall expand its Rental Subsidy Program by 320 slots over the term of this \nAgreement.  \n50.  EOHHS, in coordination with the Executive Office of Housing and Livable \nCommunities, shall expand subsidized housing capacity targeted to elder and disabled \nMassHealth members transitioning from a nursing facility to the community by adding 800 new \nsubsidized housing opportunities over the term of this Agreement.  The addition of subsidized \nhousing capacity shall be achieved through a combination of increased mobile and project-based \nvouchers, as well as an increase in funding to create new units of housing targeted to these \npopulations. \nC.  Expansion of Access to Integrated Care Programs that Provide Supported Housing \n51.  Within 90 days of the Approval Date, EOHHS shall issue guidance to entities that \noperate a Program for All Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) stating that nursing facility \nresidents may enroll in a PACE program if at the time of enrollment, they are able to live in a \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 15 of 54\n \ncommunity setting without jeopardizing their health or safety (and they meet all other eligibility \nrequirements as specified in 42 CFR 460.150) as determined by the PACE organization.  EOHHS \nwill issue similar guidance to One Care and SCO plans reminding them of their ability to enroll \neligible nursing facility residents into their plans. \nD.  Provision of Home Modifications to Support Transitions \n52.  EOHHS, through the MFP-CL waiver, shall provide funding of up to $50,000 for \none or more home modifications per MFP-CL waiver participant, where necessary and as \nauthorized by the care plan, to facilitate the waiver participant’s transition from a nursing facility \nto a home in the community that is owned or leased by the waiver participant or a family \nmember with whom the waiver participant will reside. \n53.  EOHHS, through the MFP Demo, shall provide funding of up to $50,000 for one \nor more home modifications per MFP Demo enrollee, where necessary and authorized by the \ncare plan, to facilitate the MFP Demo enrollee’s transition from a nursing facility to a home in \nthe community that is owned or leased by the MFP Demo enrollee or a family member with \nwhom the MFP Demo enrollee will reside.  An MFP Demo enrollee who is also an MFP waiver \nparticipant may only access this benefit through one program, not both.   \n54.  Over the term of this Agreement, EOHHS, through the MFP-CL waiver and the \nMFP-Demo, shall complete a minimum of 120 major (i.e., requiring funding in excess of $5,000) \nhome modifications as described in Paragraphs 52, 53, and 59(c)(3) of this Agreement. \nV.

MassHealth will not cover the admission of a class member to a nursing facility \nunless the requirements in duly promulgated regulations set forth at 130 CMR 456.407 and 130 \nCMR 456.408 are met.  The Defendants will assist nursing facilities, long-term care options \ncounseling entities, and other community-based organizations in making available to individuals \nresiding in nursing facilities or planning to enter nursing facilities information about community \nservice options.    \n56.  For class members residing in nursing facilities who are preparing to transition to \nthe community, the Defendants will make payments to therapists in accordance with duly \npromulgated regulations set forth at 130 CMR 432 and 130 CMR 450 for ongoing therapy \nservices.  Any appeal of the denial, suspension, reduction, or termination of payment for therapy \nservices will be pursuant to the fair hearing process described in 42 C.F.R. § 431.200 et seq.   \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 16 of 54\n \n57.  The case manager from the applicable EOHHS agency or contractor shall make \nbest efforts to communicate with licensed clinicians in the nursing facility who are responsible \nfor the care of a class member in a nursing facility, so that the transitional service component of \nthe class member’s transition planning process is coordinated with the class member’s medical \ncare, including necessary therapies. \nVI.  Nursing Facility Transition Time Frames and Minimum Total Transitions  \n58.  The Defendants shall transition class members to the community within the \nfollowing time frames:  \na)  For persons transitioning into a provider-operated setting such as a group home: \nwithin 18 months of their engagement with state funded transition assistance \nservices, absent reasonable exceptions; \nb)  For persons transitioning to their own home or apartment in the community and \nwho need to locate and obtain such home or apartment: within 12 months of their \nengagement with state-funded transition assistance services, absent reasonable \nexceptions; and,  \nc)  For persons transitioning to their own home or apartment in the community and \nwho already have a home or apartment: within 9 months of their engagement with \nstate funded transition assistance services, absent reasonable exceptions. \n59.  The Defendants will transition a minimum of 2,400 class members from nursing \nfacilities to the community over the term of this Agreement.  The Defendants will make \nreasonable efforts to achieve 20% of these transitions (i.e., 480) by the start of Year 3 of this \nAgreement, 50% of these transitions (i.e., 1,200) by the start of Year 5 of this Agreement, and \n85% of these transitions (i.e., 2,040) by the start of Year 7 of this Agreement.  For the purposes \nof this Agreement a countable transition means a class member who:  \na)  received state-funded assistance with their transition to the community, which \nincludes, but is not limited to, transition assistance provided through: the CTLP, \nDMH, the MFP Demo, or through a MassHealth HCBS waiver; \nb)  receives or received state-funded long term services and supports in the \ncommunity after their transition, which is defined as either: MassHealth HCBS \nwaiver services; or DMH services; or PACE, or SCO services for persons with \nsignificant needs (as determined by being in one of the following rating \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 17 of 54\n \ncategories: Community BH, Community NHC, or Institutional, as described in \nAmendment 8, Appendix N of the SCO Contract, effective January 1, 2023, \nhttps://www.mass.gov/lists/senior-care-organization-sco-contracts#amendment-8-\nto-2nd-a&r-sco-contracts-); and \nc)  transitioned to either:  \n1)  a provider-operated setting that provides 24-hour supervision and support; \n2)  their own or a family member’s home or apartment with a housing \nsubsidy; \n3)  their own or a family member’s home or apartment with a major home \nmodification (i.e., requiring funding in excess of $5,000); \n4)  their own or a family member’s home or apartment without a major home \nmodification (no more than 700 persons); or  \n5)  a public housing setting or Assisted Living Residence, as defined in 651 \nCMR 12.02, (“ALR”) with services provided through PACE, One Care, or \nSCO. \n60.  Nothing in this Agreement shall require EOHHS to purchase a house, apartment, \nor other dwelling, or to create ALRs for class members.    \n61.  Nothing in this Agreement shall require EOHHS to reserve or designate HCBS \nwaiver slots, rental subsidies, DMH GLE beds, or home modifications for class members.   \n62.  Nothing in this Agreement shall require EOHHS to place class members in HCBS \nwaivers for which they are not eligible. \n63.  For individuals determined to be ineligible for the MFP-RS or MFP-CL waiver \nbased on their inability to be safely served within the waiver program, EOHHS shall refer the \nindividual to a person designated for facilitating eligibility determinations at DMH, or another \nappropriate EOHHS agency or MassHealth program so that a determination may be made as to \nwhether the individual is eligible to receive services offered by the agency that could meet their \nneeds and facilitate their transition to the community.   \n64.  The parties agree that, in evaluating whether a person can be safely served in an \nHCBS waiver program, a public entity may impose legitimate safety requirements necessary for \nthe safe operation of its services, programs, or activities, provided they are based on actual risks, \nnot on mere speculation, stereotypes, or generalizations about individuals with disabilities. At the \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 18 of 54\n \nmeetings specified in Paragraph 83, the Plaintiffs may raise for discussion any questions and \nconcerns about the Defendants’ process for evaluating whether a person can be safely served in \nthe MFP-RS and MFP-CL waiver programs. \nVII.

In collecting this data, the Defendants shall categorize countable transitions as \nfollows: \na)   The number of class members transitioned to a provider-operated setting that \nprovides 24-hour supervision and support, by MFP-RS waiver and DMH GLE. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 20 of 54\n \nb)   The number of class members transitioned to their own home or apartment with a \nhousing subsidy, by HCBS waiver, SCO, PACE, and DMH rental subsidy. \nc)   The number of class members transitioned to their own home or apartment with \nmajor (i.e., requiring funding in excess of $5,000) home modifications. \nd)   The number of class members transitioned to a public housing setting or ALR \nwith services provided through PACE or SCO. \ne)   The number of class members transitioned to their own home or apartment \nwithout a major home modification or rental subsidy.  \nf)   Time to Transition: \n1)  For persons transitioning into a provider-operated setting such as a group \nhome, the average time in months between engagement with state-funded \ntransition assistance services and transition.  \n2)  For persons transitioning to their own home or apartment in the \ncommunity and who need to locate and obtain such home or apartment, \nthe average time in months between engagement with state-funded \ntransition assistance services and transition.  \n3)  For persons transitioning to their own home or apartment who already \nhave a home or apartment, time in months between engagement with state-\nfunded transition assistance services and transition.  \ng)  Each quarter, for the MFP-RS waiver and MFP-CL waiver:  \n1)  Number of persons who applied. \n2)  Number of persons denied, by reason. \n3)  Number of persons determined eligible. \nThe Defendants shall develop protocols for reporting data on countable transitions by race, \nethnicity, and primary language within two years of the Approval Date. \nVIII.  Funding \n69.  The Defendants’ obligations under this Agreement are subject to appropriations \nby the Legislature and, as applicable, the availability of federal financial participation in the \nCommonwealth’s Medicaid program and the MFP Demo.  In order to implement this Agreement, \nwhich resolves all federal and state-law based claims set forth in the Complaint, the Defendants \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 21 of 54\n \nwill submit budget requests as needed and will, consistent with Art. 63 of the Massachusetts \nConstitution, make best efforts to obtain the funding necessary to implement this Agreement. \n      \nIX.  Approval, Implementation, and Termination  \nA.  Approval \n70.  Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, the Parties shall jointly move the \nCourt for preliminary approval of this Agreement.  The Parties’ joint motion shall include a copy \nof this Agreement and shall request that the Court: (a) approve a draft notice of settlement, a \ndraft summary notice, and a proposed order granting preliminary approval to be attached to the \nmotion; (b) provide that the notice of settlement and summary notice state that any class member \n(other than named class representatives) may object to this Agreement by mailing a written \nobjection to the Court and Plaintiffs’ counsel at least 10 days before the fairness hearing \ndescribed below; (c) approve mailing of the notice of the settlement by the Defendants to: (i) \nnursing facilities, with instructions to distribute copies to all residents; (ii) ASAPs; (ii) \nIndependent Living Centers; and (iv) advocacy and service organizations working with people \nwith disabilities identified by the Plaintiffs; (d) the publication of a summary notice in the major \nnewspapers throughout the state within 10 days after the entry of an order granting preliminary \napproval; and (e) request a date for a fairness hearing pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. 23(e) that is no \nfewer than 45 days, and no more than 60 days, after the entry of the order granting preliminary \napproval of this Agreement. \n71.  Plaintiffs’ counsel shall maintain copies of any objections to this Agreement and, on \na weekly basis, shall provide copies of such objections to counsel for the Defendants.  The notice of \nsettlement and the summary notice shall set out the mailing address of Plaintiffs’ counsel.  Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel shall maintain a telephone number that  may be called during normal business hours by any \nclass member who has questions about this Agreement.  The notice of settlement and the summary \nnotice shall set out this telephone number and state that class members with questions about this \nAgreement may call the number during normal business hours.   \n72.  Once the notice process described herein is complete, the Parties will promptly file a \njoint motion for final approval of this Agreement in a form substantially similar to the form attached \nhereto as Appendix 1, including the draft approval order attached hereto as that form’s Exhibit A.    \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 22 of 54\n \n  73.  The Parties agree to take such actions as are reasonably necessary to obtain final \napproval of this Agreement by the Court pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). \n  74.  As part of the approval process, the Parties will also submit a joint motion to certify \na class.  The parties agree to request that the Court certify the following class: \n“All present or future Medicaid-eligible persons who: (i) are Massachusetts \nresidents, (ii) have attained age 22, (iii) reside (at any time before the Termination \nDate) in a nursing facility within the Commonwealth for 60 days or more, and (iv) \neither (a) have a “disability” as defined in the ADA and are qualified for and \nwould not oppose transition to a community-based setting, or (b) have PASRR \nSMI as determined pursuant to a Level II PASRR evaluation.” \n \n75.  The Defendants agree to pay Plaintiffs’ counsel the following amount in attorneys’ \nfees and costs for legal work related to this matter up to and through the Approval Date: ONE \nMILLION EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND and 00/100 U.S. dollars ($1,800,000). Nothing herein \nwill require the Defendants to pay any amount of fees generated or incurred for any legal services \nprovided by any counsel to the Plaintiffs at any time after the Approval Date, with the exception that \nthe Defendants will pay reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for legal work associated with any \nmotion brought pursuant to Paragraphs 89-90, and/or Paragraph 94 below.                            \n76.  If the Court does not enter final approval of this Agreement in all respects \n(including certification of the class described in Paragraph 74, above), this Agreement shall be \nnull and void and of no force and effect, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties and resubmitted \nto and approved by the Court.  In the event that this Agreement becomes null and void, nothing \nherein shall be deemed to prejudice the position of any of the Parties with respect to the Action \nor otherwise, and neither the existence of this Agreement, nor any of its terms or provisions, nor \nany of the negotiations or proceedings connected with it, shall be admissible in evidence, \nreferred to for any purpose in the litigation or in any other litigation or proceeding, or construed \nas an admission, presumption or concession by any party to the litigation. \n77.  The Parties hereto waive any right to appeal or collaterally attack the Order \napproving this Agreement or the Judgment of dismissal with prejudice to be entered by the Court \nupon allowance of the Parties’ joint motion as described in Paragraph 72 above. \n78.  The Defendant’s obligations under this Agreement may be enforced only by the \nPlaintiffs.  Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to confer any rights or remedies on \nany person other than the Parties hereto. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 23 of 54\n \nB.  Stipulation of Dismissal \n79.  In the event that the Court enters an order of final approval of this Agreement as \nrequested by the Parties, or in a substantially similar form, the Parties shall, within ten (10) \ncalendar days, sign and file the Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal With Prejudice pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 41(1)(a)(1) that is attached hereto as Appendix 2. \n80.  The Parties agree that they will take such actions as are reasonably necessary to \nobtain a final judgment of dismissal with prejudice of the Action once this Agreement has been \nfinally approved pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). \n81.  The Parties’ Stipulation of Dismissal shall include a Stipulation that this Court shall \nretain jurisdiction to enforce, modify, and resolve any disputes that arise in connection with this \nAgreement, subject to the requirements for Dispute Resolution set forth herein. \nC.  Implementation \n82.  EOHHS will designate a senior staff person to serve as the Implementation \nCoordinator in connection with this Agreement, with the responsibility to oversee the activities \nand responsibilities required herein.  The Implementation Coordinator will coordinate, facilitate, \nand monitor compliance by the various agencies and divisions within EOHHS responsible for \nproviding the activities, programs, services, and information required by this Agreement. \n83.  The Parties shall meet quarterly to discuss any issues relevant to implementation \nof this Agreement, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties.  The first quarterly meeting will \noccur no later than 90 days after the Approval Date of this Agreement.  The Defendants will \nprovide to the Plaintiffs’ counsel, at least seven days prior to each meeting, recent information \nrelevant to implementation, including data reports described in Paragraphs 65-68 above.  \nNothing herein will require the Defendants to produce any data in accordance with Paragraphs \n65-68 above on any different or faster timetable than that set forth in Section VII above. \n84.  With respect to individuals who have transitioned pursuant to Paragraph 59, the \nPlaintiffs’ counsel will be provided on request from the Defendants: (i) the names, addresses, and \ntelephone numbers of persons who have transitioned from a nursing facility into a community \nresidential program or service, and of their guardians, if any, and (ii) the transition plan of such \npersons in whatever form the agency uses.   \n85.  The Defendants shall notify nursing facilities that the Plaintiffs’ counsel represent \na class of persons in nursing facilities and that the United States District Court has entered a \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 24 of 54\n \nprotective order (which shall be attached to the notification) with respect to that class.  The \nDefendants will facilitate access to these programs and providers for the Plaintiffs’ counsel, in \norder that they may meet with individual class members, unless the individual objects. \nD.  Dispute Resolution  \n86.  If, at any time, the Plaintiffs believe that any one or more of the Defendants or \ntheir agents are not in substantial compliance (i.e., are in substantial noncompliance) with any \nprovision of this Agreement, the Plaintiffs shall notify the Defendants of the specific reasons for \nthe alleged noncompliance, referencing the specific provision or provisions of this Agreement as \nto which they allege the Defendants have not complied.  An allegation that the Defendants are \nnot in substantial compliance with this Agreement (i.e., they are in substantial noncompliance) \nshall not be based on any minor and/or isolated delays in compliance.  The Plaintiffs will give \nsuch notice in a writing to be delivered by certified mail to the Massachusetts Attorney General’s \nOffice (the “AGO”) and to EOHHS.  The notice required herein will be referred to hereinafter as \na “Dispute Notice.” \n87.  Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Dispute Notice, EOHHS shall send a \nresponse in writing.  Within fifteen (15) days of the Plaintiffs’ receipt of EOHHS’s response, the \nParties will meet to confer for the purpose of resolving the alleged problems identified by the \nPlaintiffs in the Dispute Notice.  The requirement to “meet and confer” may be accomplished by \nremote video communication via the Internet. \n88.  Should the Parties fail to resolve any differences between them with respect to \nany allegation of a failure by the Defendants to substantially comply (i.e., that the Defendants are \nin substantial noncompliance) stated in the Dispute Notice, the Parties shall refer the matter to a \nmutually agreeable mediator for nonbinding mediation.  The Plaintiffs and the Defendants shall \neach propose three potential mediators for purposes of selecting a neutral and mutually agreeable \nmediator.  \n89.  Should the Parties fail to resolve, through mediation, any allegation of a failure by \nthe Defendants to substantially comply (i.e., that the Defendants are in substantial \nnoncompliance) stated in the Dispute Notice, the Plaintiffs may seek a judicial determination that \nthe Defendants are not substantially complying (i.e., are in substantial noncompliance) with this \nAgreement.  The Defendants shall have no fewer than thirty days (30) to respond to any such \nmotion.  If the Court finds that the Defendants have failed to substantially comply (i.e., are in \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 25 of 54\n \nsubstantial noncompliance) with this Agreement, it may enter an order consistent with equitable \nprinciples, but not an order of contempt, that is designed to achieve compliance.   \n90.  If the Plaintiffs contend that the Defendants have not complied with an order \nentered under Paragraph 89, they may, after reasonable notice to the Defendants, move for \nfurther relief from the Court to obtain compliance with the Court’s prior order.  In ruling on such \na motion, the Court may apply equitable principles and may use any appropriate equitable or \nremedial power then available to it. \n91.  If the Defendants intend to file a motion of any kind related to the terms and \nconditions of this Agreement and/or the implementation of this Agreement, they shall provide the \nPlaintiffs written notice of the nature of the motion and the relief to be requested.  The Plaintiffs will \nhave thirty days from the date of the written notice from the Defendants to meet and confer with the \nDefendants and propose any actions that they will take to resolve the dispute and make the filing of \nthe motion unnecessary.  If no resolution has occurred within thirty days of the Defendants’ written \nnotice, the Defendants may file the motion with the Court. \n92.  This Agreement shall be governed by Massachusetts law. \n93.  By mutual agreement, the Parties may change the terms of this Agreement, but only \nif such mutual agreement is memorialized in a writing that is signed by the Parties (or authorized \nrepresentatives thereof) and approved by the Court. \nE.  Termination \n94.  Except as otherwise set forth in this Paragraph or Paragraph 95, on the eighth \nanniversary of the Approval Date (which date will be referenced herein as the “Termination \nDate”), this Agreement shall terminate and the Defendants shall have no other or further \nobligations under this Agreement unless: (i) the Plaintiffs have provided written notice to the \nDefendants of a failure to substantially comply with this Agreement within at least 90 days prior \nto the Termination Date, and (ii) the alleged failure to substantially comply has not yet been \nresolved pursuant to the Dispute Resolution terms set forth in Paragraphs 86-93 above; or (iii) \nthe Parties have agreed to another Termination Date that was approved by the Court; or (iv) the \nCourt has otherwise modified or extended the Termination Date.  In the event the Court \ndetermines that the Defendants have failed to substantially comply with this Agreement, the \nobligations of this Agreement that are related to remedying the noncompliance (and only those \nobligations) shall continue until either: (i) the Court has determined that the Defendants have \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 26 of 54\n \nsubstantially complied with this Agreement; or (ii) the Parties have reached mutual agreement as \nto resolution of the allegation that the Defendants have failed to substantially comply with this \nAgreement.   \n95.  If the Defendants believe that they have met the requirements related to the total \ntransitions set forth in Paragraph 59 and are otherwise in substantial compliance with this \nAgreement prior to its eighth anniversary, they may provide the Plaintiffs with a notice of \ncompliance at any time, together with all available evidence of such compliance.  If the Parties \nagree that the Defendants are in compliance with all provisions of this Agreement, the Parties \nwill designate a mutually agreeable Termination Date that will replace the Termination Date \ndescribed above for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Plaintiffs will not unreasonably \nwithhold their agreement to designate a new Termination Date based on the Defendants’ \nsubstantial compliance with this Agreement.  If the Parties disagree on the status or existence of \nsubstantial compliance as asserted by the Defendants, the Defendants may seek from the Court a \ndetermination of substantial compliance.  \nX.  Release  \n96.  As defined above, the term “Plaintiffs” includes all members of any class certified \nby the Court.  All terms of this Agreement, including the release and dismissal terms in this \nsection, are entered on behalf of all members of any class certified in this Action. \n97.  The Plaintiffs and the Defendants represent and warrant that they have authority \nto enter into this Agreement and that this Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the \nbenefit of, their successors, agents, and assigns.  Each person executing this Agreement on behalf \nof a Plaintiff or Defendant represents and warrants that they have authority to do so. \n98.  The Plaintiffs, individually and for and on behalf of all class members, fully, \nfinally, and forever release, relinquish, discharge, and waive any and all claims for injunctive \nand/or declaratory relief that were or could have been brought against the Defendants and/or \nagainst any other agency or official of the Commonwealth concerning the subject of this Action, \nfrom the beginning of time until the Termination Date, excepting claims related to enforcing the \nprovisions of this Agreement, subject to the Dispute Resolution requirements set forth herein.  \nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Plaintiffs do not release, relinquish, discharge, or waive any \nspecific claim of any individual in the context of administrative and/or judicial review of an \naction by EOHHS or its agencies that may be litigated in an administrative proceeding and/or in \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 27 of 54\n \nthe Superior Court of the Commonwealth pursuant to Mass. G.L. c. 30A.  Nothing in this \nAgreement shall be construed or interpreted to create any right to administrative and/or judicial \nreview of any action by the Defendants that was not subject to such review prior to the Approval \nDate of this Agreement.  \n99.  This Agreement is in settlement of all claims that have been or might have been \nasserted in the Action and shall not be construed in any way as an admission, presumption, or \nconcession by any one or more Defendants (or any other one or more agencies or officials of the \nCommonwealth) of any liability or wrongdoing whatsoever.  By entering into this Agreement, \nthe Defendants do not admit any wrongdoing, or violation of law, or liability to the Plaintiffs, and \nthis Agreement shall not be construed as, and is not evidence of, an admission of wrongdoing or \nviolation of law.  This Agreement may not be relied upon as precedent in any future claim, other \nthan claim(s) brought to enforce this Agreement. \nXI.  Miscellaneous \n100.  This Agreement contains all of the agreements, conditions, promises, and \ncovenants between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants and among their respective counsel \nregarding the matters set forth in this Agreement and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous \nagreements, drafts, representations, or understandings, either written or oral, with respect to the \nsubject matter of this Agreement and with respect to the subject matter of the Complaint and the \nAction. \n101.  All Parties hereto have all participated in the drafting of this Agreement and, \naccordingly, any claimed ambiguity may not be presumptively construed for or against any of the \nPlaintiffs or the Defendants. \n102.  In this Agreement, a period of days shall be deemed to begin on the first business \nday after the event which began the period.  References to a “day” or “days” shall be construed \nto mean calendar days unless otherwise specified. \n103.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts each of which shall \nconstitute an original instrument and all of which together shall constitute one and the same \nAgreement.  Copies will be enforceable to the same extent as the original. \n104.  The date on which the Court approves this Agreement and enters its Order will be \nthe “Approval Date.” \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 28 of 54\n \n105.  This Agreement shall not be, or be construed as, a Consent Decree or any other \norder of the Court. \n106.  In no event are the Defendants required under this Agreement to make any one or \nmore expenditures in excess of the amount legally available to it under state law. \n107.  Nothing in this Agreement constitutes a waiver of the sovereign immunity that \nmay be asserted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and its instrumentalities, agencies, and \nofficials. \n108.  Force Majeure: Any failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement shall \nnot be considered a breach of or noncompliance with any term of this Agreement if such failure \nresults from any act of God, riot, war, civil unrest, flood, fire, earthquake, pandemic or epidemic, \nor other natural disaster. \n109.

In support of this Motion, the Parties state as follows: \n1 \n \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 42 of 54\n  1.  On April __ 2024, the Court preliminarily approved the Settlement Agreement, \nprovisionally certified a settlement class, approved a Notice to Class Members and a Summary \nNotice, and established a schedule for the fairness hearing.  See ECF ##. \n2.  On or before April __ 2024, the Defendants disseminated the Notice and arranged \nfor the publication of the Summary Notice, as required by the Court’s Order and as provided by \n¶70 of the Settlement Agreement. \n3.  In response to the Notice, __ class members submitted written objections.  \n[SUMMARIZE OBJECTIONS IF ANY]. \n4.  The Settlement Agreement was entered into through arms-length negotiations, by \nhighly experienced counsel for the Parties, and provides significant benefits for the Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the class, without the risk and expense of further litigation.  As such, it is a fair and \nreasonable resolution of the litigation.  [Because these objections do not undermine the \nappropriateness or reasonableness of the Settlement Agreement,] the Court should approve the \nSettlement Agreement as fair and reasonable. [for the reasons set forth in their separate \nMemoranda of Law]  \n5.  The Court should permanently certify a settlement class, as agreed to by the \nParties and as provisionally certified pursuant to its April __ Order, which is defined as follows:  \n“All present or future Medicaid-eligible persons who: (i) are Massachusetts \nresidents, (ii) have attained age 22, (iii) reside (at any time before the Termination \nDate) in a nursing facility within the Commonwealth for 60 days or more, and (iv) \neither (a) have a “disability” as defined in the ADA and are qualified for and \nwould not oppose transition to a community-based setting, or (b) have PASRR \nSMI as determined pursuant to a Level II PASRR evaluation.” \n \n6.  The settlement class satisfies all of the requirements of Fed. R. Civ.

The Settlement Agreement is finally approved as fair, reasonable, and adequate. \n2.  In making the final determination that the Settlement Agreement is fair, \nreasonable, and adequate, the Court has considered the factors set forth in Fed. R. Civ. P. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 48 of 54\n \n23(e)(2) and balanced the advantages and costs of the settlement against continued litigation.  \nSee Robinson v. Nat’l Student Clearinghouse, 14 F.4th 56, 59 (1st Cir. 2021); Nat’l Ass’n of \nChain Drug Stores v. New England Carpenters Health Benefits Fund, 582 F.3d 30, 44 (1st Cir. \n2009).  The relief provided in the Settlement Agreement to Class Members is comprehensive and \ndetailed; fairly, reasonably, and adequately remedies the injuries alleged; and treats class \nmembers equitably relative to one another.  Class counsel conducted an initial investigation of \nthe Commonwealth’s services system before filing the litigation, and adequate discovery \nthereafter, prior to engaging in arm’s length negotiations.  Class counsel are competent attorneys \nwith significant experience in litigating, negotiating, and implementing class action system \nreform cases, and the class representatives adequately represent the class.  The litigation risks \nand legal uncertainty associated with continued litigation for both parties support the conclusion \nthat settlement is preferable.  Finally, considering the above findings, any objections filed \nregarding the Settlement Agreement cannot overcome the presumption of reasonableness.  See \nCohen v. Brown Univ., 16 F.4th 935, 951 (1st Cir. 2021). \n  3.  The proposed class is permanently certified as a settlement class pursuant to Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(e), comprised of:  \n“All present or future Medicaid-eligible persons who: (i) are Massachusetts \nresidents, (ii) have attained age 22, (iii) reside (at any time before the Termination \nDate) in a nursing facility within the Commonwealth for 60 days or more, and (iv) \neither (a) have a “disability” as defined in the ADA and are qualified for and \nwould not oppose transition to a community-based setting, or (b) have PASRR \nSMI as determined pursuant to a Level II PASRR evaluation.” \n \n4.  The Court, having considered the factors required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g) \nand the qualifications, experience, and knowledge of each class counsel, as set forth in \ntheir Memorandum in Support of Class Certification, ECF 76, hereby appoints the Center \nfor Public Representation, Greater Boston Legal Services, Justice in Aging, and Foley \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-11715-NMG   Document 152-1   Filed 04/16/24   Page 49 of 54\n \nHoag LLP as class counsel.  The Court further finds that class counsel will fairly and \nadequately represent the interests of the class.  \n  5.  The Court retains jurisdiction to enforce and modify the Settlement Agreement, \nand resolve any disputes that arise in connection therewith, consistent with its terms. \n6.  The Plaintiffs are awarded $1,800,000 in attorneys’ fees and costs for legal work \nand expenses through this date, as is agreed upon by the Parties and as determined by the Court \nto be fair and reasonable.  In making the foregoing award, the Court finds that: (1) the amount of \ntime expended by class counsel, as significantly reduced in the agreed-to amount, is reasonable \nin light of the complexity and novelty of this case; (2) class counsel’s hourly rates, as reduced in \nthe agreed-to amount, are reasonable in the context of this case; (3) that the lodestar, as further \nreduced in the agreed-to amount, is fair and reasonable given the results obtained for the class; \nand (4) that the costs included in the agreed-to amount are reasonable and necessary in light of \nthe litigation.  The Defendants shall make reasonable efforts to obtain funds to pay the agreed-to \namount of attorneys’ fees and costs (i.e., $1,800,000) to the Center for Public Representation at \nthe earliest possible date. \n  SO ORDERED. \n  DATED:  \n              ______________________________   \n              Honorable Nathaniel M.
