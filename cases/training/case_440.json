    "summary": "<p>On October 4, 1994, a class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against Connecticut's Departments of Mental Retardation (DMR), Social Services (DSS), and Public Health (DPH) and Southbury Training School, an intermediate care facility for people with intellectual disabilities (ICF/MR) in Southbury, Connecticut. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief on behalf of both current and future Southbury residents. The plaintiffs claimed that the conditions at Southbury violated residents' rights under the Due Process clause, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. &sect; 12132, the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. &sect; 794, and the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1396a.</p>\r\n<p>This lawsuit followed in the wake of an earlier investigation of Southbury, conducted by the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA). 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1997 et seq. That federal investigation led to a CRIPA lawsuit, <a href=\"../../../../case/442/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">United States v. Connecticut</a>, which was apparently treated as a companion case to this one at points during litigation. Another private suit, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=5464\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McCoy v. Belmont</a>, appears to have been litigated separately. Judge Ellen B. Burns of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut adjudicated all or part of these three lawsuits.</p>\r\n<p>According to the complaint in this case, conditions at Southbury worsened after the 1986 consent decree entered in <em>United States v. Connecticut</em>. Inhumane living conditions at Southbury placed residents at risk of physical harm and death. For the institution's convenience, residents' behavior was controlled with physical and pharmaceutical restraints instead of behavior modification programming. Similarly, according to the complaint, the institution also sacrificed residents' choice, dignity, privacy, and individuality for convenience by scheduling bathing, toileting and eating to occur communally. Southbury was located in a remote rural area and did not provide community living placements, family support, employment opportunities, recreation, and adequate medical and psychological care, thereby isolating residents from their families and communities. The plaintiffs' other complaints addressed advocacy, residents' rights, facility accessibility, sanitation, staff-to-resident ratios, property ownership, and Do Not Resuscitate Orders (DNR Orders). The Complaint was amended three times, but we only have a copy of the original version.</p>\r\n<p>On October 6, 1994, the court (Judge Ellen B. Burns) declined to consolidate this lawsuit with <em>United States v. Connecticut</em>. On February 7, 1996, the court reinforced the disunion between the lawsuits by denying Southbury's motion to dismiss for res judicata. Messier v. Southbury Training Sch., 915 F. Supp. 133 (D. Conn. 1996). The court reasoned that the Messier plaintiffs were not in privity with the United States and, therefore, were not barred from litigating the issues.</p>\r\n<p>A second challenge to the integrity of the plaintiffs' claims was raised when seven Southbury residents and two advocacy groups sought to intervene in the lawsuit. The would-be interveners feared that, if granted, the relief sought by the plaintiffs would precipitate closure of Southbury. On March 6, 1996, the court disagreed and interpreted the plaintiffs' prayer as one that would require Southbury to consider community placements for all residents but only to use community placements when appropriate. Institutional placement would still be available for individuals who would benefit from living in a structured environment. The court certified the class on July 7, 1996, and refused to dismiss the claims against DPH and DSS on September 4, 1996.</p>\r\n<p>It appears that the parties engaged in discovery, and occasionally sought the court's opinion on procedural disputes. Messier v. Southbury Training Sch., No. 94-1706, 1991 WL 136170 (D. Conn. Jan. 30, 1998) (ruling on plaintiffs' subpoena of documents from non-party); Messier v. Southbury Training Sch., No. 94-1706, 1998 WL 422858 (D. Conn. June 29, 1998) (finding documents written by defense experts to be protected as strategic work products); Messier v. Southbury Training Sch., No. 94-1706, 1998 WL 841641 (D. Conn. Dec. 2, 1998) (compelling defendants to return borrowed documents to the plaintiffs and permitting plaintiffs to re-depose defense witnesses).</p>\r\n<p>On November 5, 1998, the court refused both to allow 611 of Southbury's 724 residents either to opt-out of the plaintiff class or to be defined as a subclass. Messier v. Southbury Training Sch., 183 F.R.D. 350 (D. Conn. 1998). Although the court recognized that members of a class certified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) might sometimes be permitted to opt-out of a class, the court found no substantive reason for allowing the 611 residents to opt-out in this case. The court reiterated that pending litigation would not have the effect of closing Southbury and chastised Southbury advocacy groups, which had used misinformation to recruit residents for the opt-out petition.</p>\r\n<p>On January 5, 1999, the court issued two rulings. First, the court permitted the plaintiffs to add a named plaintiff to protect the community placement claim, but refused to allow any substantive amendment. Messier v. Southbury Training Sch., No. 94-1706, 1999 WL 20907 (D. Conn. Jan. 5, 1999). Although Southbury had moved almost all of the named plaintiffs to a community-based residence, the court recognized that many individuals appropriate for community placements remained institutionalized. Adding another named plaintiff would preserve deinstitutionalization and community placement claims.</p>\r\n<p>Second, the court entered a mixed ruling on four motions for summary judgment on January 5, 1999. Messier v. Southbury Training Sch., No. 94-1706, 1999 WL 20910 (D. Conn. Jan. 5, 1999). The court awarded summary judgment to DPH on the plaintiffs' DNR Order claim. The court held that a private physician could impose a DNR Order on a patient without due process protections, even if the patient was not terminally ill and had a developmental disability. The court also granted summary judgment to the defendants on all Social Security Act claims, finding that the system for inspecting and licensing ICF/MRs contained sufficient safeguards to preclude licensing claims. The court also entered summary judgment for DSS on the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act claims because the plaintiffs failed to show that Connecticut's vocational rehabilitation programs actually discriminated against severely disabled individuals. The court dismissed DSS from the litigation and denied all other summary judgment requests.</p>\r\n<p>A 120-day trial on the remaining due process, ADA, and Rehabilitation Act claims was conducted between January 25 and October 21, 1999. On September 14, 1999, the court refused to order the defendants to compensate one of the plaintiffs' experts for time spent waiting to testify. Messier v. Southbury Training Sch., No. 94-1706, 1999 WL 795556 (D. Conn. Sept. 14, 1999). On October 4, 1999, the court refused to enter partial summary judgment on issues also raised in <em>United States v. Connecticut</em>. Sometime after the trial concluded, the court put the case on hold.</p>\r\n<p>On November 12, 1999, the parties entered mediation (Owen Eagan, Neutral), which appears to have produced a partial settlement. On December 14, 2001, the court refused to enforce the partial settlement. On November 11, 2002, with the case still on hold, the plaintiffs made a motion to intervene in the <em>United States v. Connecticut</em>. On January 7, 2003, the court denied their motion.</p>\r\n<p>After <em>United States v. Connecticut</em> was finally adjudicated in 2006, the court returned its attention to Messier in May of 2006. The court initially intended to open the record to accept additional evidence on community placement. The plaintiffs objected and, on May 5, 2006, filed a motion to determine liability on the current record. On June 2, 2006, the court agreed to issue a ruling on the basis of the 1999 trial. On June 5, 2008, the Court held that plaintiffs' claims were moot, following the decision in <em>United States v. Connecticut</em>; however, some individual remedies were needed for community placements for appropriate persons, though the plaintiffs appealed this decision and the conference was canceled pending the appellate decision. In October of 2008, the Second Circuit held that it would not hear the appeals until the District Court entered a judgment. As a result, the District Court set status conferences to take place on January and June of 2009.</p>\r\n<p>In the following months, the parties continued discovery and held a number of settlement conferences. On July 14, 2010, the Court granted a preliminary motion for a settlement agreement. The agreement required training of staff in recommending the appropriate setting for individuals, reallocation of funding to support community-based settings, implementation of programs for transition to such communities, and the hiring of a \"Remedial Expert\" to assure proper compliance. In November, 2010, the Court approved the settlement agreement as final, finding that it was a fair agreement. Lengthy litigation regarding attorney fees followed, and on January 23, 2013, the Court held that plaintiffs would be awarded attorney fees for their successful claims, but as of July 9, 2014, the Court did not decide an amount. The Court reheard a motion challenging this arrangement and it denied the motion to reconsider.</p>\r\n<p>In 2018, plaintiffs filed an appeal with the Second Circuit, which they withdrew in 2019. As of April 2019, the settlement agreement has terminated.</p>",

    "summary_short": "On October 4, 1994, a class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against Connecticut's Departments of Mental Retardation (DMR), Social Services (DSS), and Public Health (DPH) and Southbury Training School, an intermediate care facility for people with intellectual disabilities (ICF/MR) in Southbury, Connecticut. The plaintiffs claimed that the conditions at Southbury violated residents' rights under the Due Process clause, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12132, the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a. The Court (Judge Ellen B. Burns) granted four motions for summary judgment for the defendants, though the due process, ADA, and Rehabilitation Act claims survived. On July 14, 2010, the Court signed a preliminary settlement agreement that became final on November of 2010. Since then, the Court decided that plaintiffs should be awarded attorney fees for their successful claims, but the amount of fees is still being decided as of July 9, 2014.",

ADDISS, Commissioner,\nConnecticut Department of Public\nHealth and Addiction Services,\nDefendants, October 5, 1994\nCOMPLAINT\nI.  JURISDICTION;\n1.  This  action  seeks  injunctive  relief  to  redress  the\ndeprivation under color of state law of rights secured to the\nplaintiffs  by  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States\nConstitution, and federal laws, in particular the Americans with\nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, the Rehabilitation Act, 29\nU.S.C. § 794, and the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a.  The\namount in controversy exceeds $50,000 exclusive of interest and\ncosts.\n2.  The jurisdiction of this court is invoked under 28 U.S.C.\n§§ 1331, 1343, 2201, 2202 and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988.\n2\n\n3.  Money damages are inadequate and plaintiffs have been\nsuffering  and  will  continue  to  suffer  irreparable  harm  from\ndefendants' actions, policies and procedures and from violations of\nthe laws complained of herein.  Accordingly, injunctive relief is\nnecessary.\nII.  PARTIES;\nA.  Plaintiffs:\nRichard Messier\n4.  Richard Messier is a fifty year-old man with retardation\nwho lives in Cottage 32 on the grounds of STS.  Richard has no\nfamily.  He brings this lawsuit by and through his guardian, Thomas\nNerney.\n5.  Richard was placed at STS in 1965 essentially because he\nwas homeless.  Since then he has been transferred to at least four\ndifferent buildings on the STS grounds.\n6.  Since his placement at STS Richard has been injured on\nnumerous  occasions  due to  the unsafe  environment  and  lack of\nmeaningful habilitation or training.  He has also had his teeth\nremoved for reasons that are not apparent from his record.\n\n7.  It has long been the professional judgment of Richard's\nplanning team that he should be transferred to the community with\nappropriate supervision and support services to protect him from\nharm and to provide a decent and humane living environment.\n8.  Richard has remained at STS for nearly thirty years,\nhowever, because the state defendants have failed to redirect the\nsubstantial public resources spent to confine him at STS so as to\npermit him to move to a community home with the supervision and\nprogramming necessary to respond to his individual needs.\nThomas Maloney\n9.  Thomas Maloney is a thirty-nine year-old man who lives in\nCottage 27 on the grounds of Southbury Training School (\"STS\").\nThomas brings this suit by and through his sister and guardian,\nKate Clinton.\n10.  Thomas was placed at STS on January 14, 1980. Since then\nhe has been transferred to several different buildings on the\ngrounds of STS.\n11.  Thomas has been injured on numerous occasions at STS due\nto assaults from other residents and/or staff.  The defendants'\nfailure  to  provide  a  humane  and  safe  living  environment and\n\nappropriate programming threatens Thomas' health, physical well-\nbeing and safety.\n12.  It  has  long  been  the  judgment  of  Thomas1  inter-\ndisciplinary team that he should be transferred to the community to\nprotect him from harm and to provide a humane living environment.\nHe has remained at STS for fourteen years, however, because the\ndefendants have failed to redirect public funds used to confine him\nat STS so that an individualized community living arrangement could\nbe developed.\nCarole Ann Carr\n13.  Carole Ann  Carr  is a forty-nine year-old  adult with\nretardation who lives in Cottage 18 on the grounds of STS.  Carole\nAnn brings this suit by her guardian, Theodore Bergeron.  Her\nfamily is not involved in her life.\n14.  Carole Ann was placed at STS on March 3, 1959.  Since\nthen she has been transferred to at least four different buildings\non the grounds of STS.\n15.  Carole Ann has sustained many injuries during her thirty-\nfive years at STS. The defendants' failure to provide a humane and\nsafe environment and appropriate programming threatens Carole Ann's\n\nhealth, physical well-being and safety.\n16.  It has long been the professional judgment of Carole\nAnn's professional team that she should be transferred to the\ncommunity with appropriate individualized supervision and support\nservices to protect her from harm and to provide a decent and\nhumane living environment.  She has remained at STS for thirty-five\nyears,  however,  because  the  state  defendants  have  failed  to\nredirect the substantial state and federal money spent to confine\nher in Cottage 18 so that the supervision and programming necessary\nto respond to her individualized needs could be provided in the\ncommunity.\nLeon Horton\n17.  Leon Horton is a forty-three year-old former resident of\nSouthbury Training School. Leon brings this suit by his mother and\nguardian, Emma Debiase.\n18.  Leon was committed to STS at age ten in January 1961\nbecause the state failed to make available the family support\nservices, including behavior modification programs and community\nliving alternatives, necessary to keep him at home, or as close to\nhome as possible.\n\n19.  Leon was transferred to many different buildings at STS.\nHe has been  injured  on numerous occasions due primarily  to the\nfailure  of  the  defendants  to  develop  and  provide  appropriate\nprograms  and  services  to  treat  his  serious  self-injurious\nbehaviors.  This failure to treat Mr. Horton continued until in\nMarch, 1994 when STS discharged him to a Danbury apartment with\nminimal  support and  supervision.  The failure to attend to his\nindividual support needs lead to his confinement on at least one\noccasion to Fairfield Hills Hospital.\n20.  The  defendants'  failure  to  provide  necessary\nindividualized  support  services  for  the  plaintiff  continues  to\nplace  Mr.  Horton  at  risk  of  continued  injury  and  harm  and\nreadmission to STS.\nRaymond Mitchell\n21.  Raymond  Mitchell  is  a  fifty-four  year-old  man  with\nretardation who lives at 22 Colony Court on the grounds of STS.\nRaymond brings this lawsuit through his guardian and next friend,\nFrank Wargo.\n22.  Raymond was placed at STS on April 16, 1959.  Since then\nhe has been transferred to some fourteen different wards on the\n\ngrounds at STS.\n23.  It has long been the professional judgment of Richard's\nplanning team that he should be transferred to the community with\nappropriate supervision and support services to protect him from\nharm and to provide a decent and humane living environment.\n24.  Richard has remained at STS for nearly thirty-five years,\nhowever,  because  the  defendants  have  failed  to  redirect  the\nsubstantial public funds spent to confine him at STS so that he can\nmove to a community home with supervision and programming designed\nto meet his individual needs.\nLeonard Haversat\n25.  Leonard Haversat is forty-three years old and has lived\nat STS since July 13, 1965.  Leon brings this suit by and through\nhis guardian, Mary Tracy.\n26.  Leonard was placed at STS on July 13, 1965.  During the\nyears that followed he was then transferred to several different\nbuildings  at  STS  and  to  Fairfield  Hills  Hospital  on  several\noccasions.\n27.  Leonard has had numerous psychiatric hospitalizations and\nmany different, inaccurate diagnoses.\n8\n\n28.  Leonard's professional team has determined that he should\nbe moved to a supervised community living arrangement to protect\nhim from harm and to provide a humane living environment.  He has\nremained  at  STS  for  twenty-nine  years,  however,  because  the\ndefendants have failed to redirect public funds from STS so that\nindividualized services necessary to support community living can\nbe provided.\nGregory Kabbai\n29.  Gregory Kabbai is forty years old and has lived at STS\nsince April 19, 1962.  Gregory brings this case by and through his\nguardian, Jane Williams.\n30.  Gregory was placed at STS on April 19. 1962.  During the\nyears  that  followed  he  was  transferred  to  several  different\nbuildings at STS and, even to a rest home at twenty years of age.\n31.  Gregory's  planning  team  has  made  the  professional\njudgment that he should be moved to supervised community living to\nprotect him from harm and provide a humane living environment.  He\nhas remained  at  STS  for thirty-two years, however, because the\ndefendants have failed to redirect public funds used to confine him\nat STS so that he can experience community living.\n\n32.  is forty-nine years old and has lived at STS\nfor ten years.  He brings this case by and through his sister and\nguardian,  . \"  •\n  :\n33.  was placed at STS on March 6, 1984 after more than\nten years of confinement at Mansfield Training School and transfers\nto inadequately supported placements.  He was finally admitted to\nSTS due to the state's failure to provide proper support services\nin the community.\n34.  has been hospitalized on many occasions and has\nbeen consigned to the Health Care Unit at STS since March, 1994 due\nto chronic thrombosis.\n35.  Although staff has promised  that he can leave STS,\nthey tell him that he can't move until his medical condition is\neffectively treated.  Unfortunately, effective treatment has proven\nelusive.  Meanwhile, he has been forced to live in a health care\nunit at STS where programming is unavailable because no other unit\non grounds can accommodate his physical disabilities.\n36.  remains  at  STS where programming  and  effective\ntreatment are unavailable because the defendants refuse to permit\n10\n\nhim  to  use  state  funds  earmarked  for  his  care  to  purchase\nappropriate supervision and care in the community.\nPeople First of Connecticut. Inc.\n37.  People  First  of  Connecticut,  Inc.  was  organized  and\nincorporated under the laws of Connecticut in 1987 to serve as a\nvehicle for self-advocacy development.\n38.  People First is a statewide organization with fourteen\ncommunity and institution chapters and 350 members.  Its membership\nis  composed  of  people  with  significant  disabilities,  including\nretardation,  who  have  been  excluded  entirely  from  educational\nopportunities  or  required  to  attend  segregated  educational\nprograms.  Its membership also includes citizens of this state who\nhave experienced firsthand the humiliating experience of spending\ndecades  segregated  at  STS  or  Mansfield  Training  School  where\nmeaningful participation in Connecticut life is impossible.  They\nare, therefore, in the best position to inform the court about what\neffects segregation has on the lives and self-esteem  of persons\nwith disabilities, and what society loses when such a discrete and\ninsular minority is excluded.\n11\n\nARC/Connecticut, Inc.\n39.  The Association  for Retarded  Citizens  of Connecticut,\nInc.  (\"ARC/Connecticut\")  is  a  statewide  nonprofit  advocacy\nassociation  of  parents  of  children  and  adults  with  mental\nretardation, people with mental retardation, advocates, friends and\ninterested citizens.  The Association, with 4000 members, is the\nlargest  voluntary  advocacy  group  for  persons  with  mental\nretardation in Connecticut.  For forty-two years ARC/Connecticut\nhas sponsored virtually every major piece of legislation affecting\npersons  with  mental  retardation  and  their  families.  The\nAssociation has also been a party to several  significant  cases\nwhich  shaped  the  service  delivery  system  for  citizens  with\ndisabilities and protected the constitutional and statutory rights\nof persons with retardation.\nWECAHR\n40.  The Western  Connecticut  Association  for  Human  Rights\n(\"WECAHR'1) is a parent association of 250 families and individuals\nwith  an  interest  and  concern  for  the  welfare  of  people  with\ndisabilities.  Its  sole purpose  is to provide  advocacy  and to\nprotect  the  rights  of  people  with  disabilities  in  Western\n12\n\nConnecticut and Southbury Training School.  In addition, WeCAHR\nstaff provide support and advice to People First of Connecticut,\nInc., an organization for adults with mental retardation.\nClass Action\n41.  The plaintiffs bring this case on their own behalf and on\nbehalf of all similarly situated persons. The members of the class\ninclude all persons who are now at STS, those who may be placed at\nSTS in the future, and persons who have been transferred from STS\nand remain under the custody and control of the Director of STS.\n42.  This is a proper class action under Rules 23(a) and\n23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The class is so\nnumerous as to make joinder of all members impracticable.  There\nare substantial questions of law and fact common to the entire\nclass, and claims of the plaintiffs are typical of the class and\npredominate over any questions affecting individual members.  A\nclass action is superior to any other available method for the fair\nand efficient adjudication of the controversy.\nB.  Defendants:\nSouthbury Training School\n43.  Until last summer Connecticut had two large institutions\n13\n\nfor  persons  with  retardation:  Mansfield  Training  School  and\nSouthbury Training School.  Mansfield Training School closed last\nsummer  after  all  its  residents  were  transferred  to  properly\nsupported and supervised community living arrangements over a ten-\nyear period.  STS was created in 1941 because of overcrowding at\nMansfield Training School and the concomitant failure of the state\nto provide citizens with retardation services in the community.\nThe Southbury Training School was created by the state to be an\neducational  facility  that would  train  and  return  its  residents\npromptly  to the community.  Instead  of fulfilling  its  original\npurpose, Southbury quickly became an institution for the long term\nsegregation of persons with retardation under inhumane conditions.\nToni Richardson\n44.  Defendant, Toni Richardson, is the Commissioner of the\nConnecticut Department of Mental Retardation.  She is responsible\nfor the planning and development of a complete, comprehensive and\nintegrated state-wide program for persons with retardation; for the\nimplementation of that program; and for the coordination of efforts\nof DMR with other state agencies, municipal governments and private\nagencies providing services to persons with retardation.  She is\n14\n\nresponsible  for  the  administration  and  operation  of  STS,  the\nregional centers, and all state-operated community and residential\nfacilities.  She is responsible for the development of criteria for\neligibility for residential and/or program services from DMR.  She\nmay  also  assign  persons  under  her  care  to  public  or  private\nfacilities or may transfer such persons from one institution or\nfacility to another.\nThomas Howlev\n45.  Defendant, Thomas Howley, is the Director of Southbury\nTraining  School.  He  is  responsible  for  the  operation  and\nadministration  of the training  school, and  for the custody  and\ncontrol of all persons admitted to STS.  He is also responsible for\nauthorizing transfers into and out of STS and for transferring STS\nresidents  from  one  facility  to  another.  The  Director  is also\nresponsible for placing persons committed or admitted to STS in a\ncommunity residential setting or in another residential facility.\nThe Director remains responsible for exercising control over the\nperson after transfer and for exercising the power to return such\nperson to the training school.\n15\n\nIII. FACTS:\n46.  Persons were placed at Southbury Training School because\ndefendants failed to provide alternative services in the community.\nWhen a crisis occurred, no services were available to support the\nfamily or to assist in the care and treatment and the raising of\nthe child at home or in a community residence near the home.\n47.  Persons remain at Southbury Training School for the same\nreason;  the  failure  of the  defendants  to  provide  alternative\nservices,  including  residential  support,  in  the  community.\nAlthough the care is unconstitutionally deficient and dangerous at\nSouthbury, persons with disabilities and their families have relied\nupon the institution for continuity of custody and care once they\nreach majority and/or after the death of their parents.\nThe Institution\n48.  The defendants have failed and/or refused to provide to\npersons placed at Southbury habilitation in community settings.\n49.  Southbury Training School is located on the outskirts of\nSouth Britain, Connecticut, a small rural community  in Western\nConnecticut.  The location is remote and inaccessible by public\ntransportation, which limits the ability of families and friends to\n16\n\nmaintain frequent contacts with their relatives and friends.  The\nhardship  is greater  for persons with  limited means, but  in all\ncases the sheer isolation of Southbury accelerates the decline of\naffectionate relationships, stripping from the individual with a\ndisability those supports, both emotional and material, which are\nnormally available in the community.\n50.  Most STS residents are rarely if ever visited by their\nfamilies.  Many have been abandoned  altogether.  Moreover, the\ntypical  STS  resident  cannot  speak  for  himself  due  to  his\ndisabilities.  As a result, most STS residents are at the mercy of\na  vast  and  impersonal  bureaucracy when  it comes to  eradicating\nunconstitutional  conditions or realizing their elusive dream of\nliving in the community.\n51.  Southbury's  isolation  prohibits  the  use  of  community\nresources as an integral part of a training program, to meet health\nneeds,  to provide  employment  or recreation, or  as  aids  in the\ndevelopment  of  those  diversified  activities  which  noninstitu-\ntionalized  persons  take  for  granted.  Local  resources  are\ninsufficient to absorb the social needs of Southbury's population.\n17\n\n52.  Living and activity space at STS is inadequate in design,\ninsufficient in area, inappropriate in setting, and dehumanizing in\ncondition.  Buildings are not functional for modern needs and are\nnot  architecturally  accessible  to  persons  with  physical\ndisabilities.  Buildings  are  dirty  and  unsanitary,  exposing\nplaintiffs to physical health hazards in addition to the discomfort\nof constant odors and filth.\n53.  The  physical  layout  and  furnishing  of  buildings  at\nSouthbury Training School are devoid of warmth, individuality, and\ndignity.  The living and sleeping areas are sparsely furnished and\nare without the lamps, sofas, rugs, comfortable chairs, pictures,\nmagazines, and other age-appropriate furnishings associated with\nnormal living.  Plaintiffs are denied the developmental, sensory\nand  intellectual  stimulation,  comfort  and  pleasure  community\nresidents obtain from the usual physical accoutrements in homes,\nschools, restaurants, workplaces, and recreational facilities.\n54.  The  physical  setting  at  STS  does  not  allow  privacy,\nindividuality, or freedom of association.  Plaintiffs are deprived\nof freedom to choose or reject associates and to determine when and\nin what way they relate to their friends.\n18\n\n55.  Few  closets  or  chests  for  personal  possessions  are\navailable, and those that exist are not accessible or permitted to\nbe used by residents.  Because of the shortage of staff and the\nlack  of  facilities  for  storage  of  personal  items,  the  few\nbelongings  which  plaintiffs  own  are  usually  lost,  stolen  or\ndestroyed within a short period of time.  These conditions deprive\nplaintiffs of their dignity and identity.\n56.  Toilet facilities are inadequate.  Bathrooms frequently\nlack  wall  partitions  or  curtains  between  toilets  or  doors  on\nstalls.  Many  living  areas  have  a  definite  stench  of  urine.\nPlaintiffs are deprived by these conditions of the right taken for\ngranted by other citizens to exercise their bodily functions in\nprivacy and to observe proper hygienic measures.\nThe Staff\n57.  Staff resident ratios and staff training are inadequate\nto provide care, let alone to evoke development and habilitation or\nto protect plaintiffs  from harm.  The staffing  requirements of\nrecognized authoritative minimum standards are not met.\n58.  Plaintiffs  are  not  provided  with  the  services,\nstimulation and attention necessary to prevent deterioration of and\n19\n\ninjury to their physical condition, psychological well-being, and\npersonal development.  Staff-patient ratios and the gross scale of\ninstitutional  living  operate  to  discourage  personal,  intimate,\nprimary relationships, like those enjoyed in normal living.\n59.  Defendants  have  failed  to  recruit,  employ  and  train\ndirect care and professional personnel in sufficient numbers, and\nhave  failed  to  place  personnel  in  an  environment  where  it  is\npossible  for  them  to  stimulate  and  assist  in  the  daily  life\nactivities of plaintiffs.\n60.  Adequate  and  regular  evaluations  of  each  resident's\nphysical, social, psychological, and personal development are not\nmade.  Defendants have not uniformly utilized a standard process\nfor assessment of each resident.  Individualized habilitation plans\nand programs for each resident of Southbury Training School are not\nuniformly provided.\n61.  Defendants have failed to provide periodic review of the\nappropriateness  and  effectiveness  of  the  plaintiffs'  plans  or\nprograms.\n62.  Defendants have failed to provide necessary services,\nincluding  medical  and  dental  care  and  treatment, nursing care,\n20\n\npsychological services, personal care and protection, social work\nservices, physical and occupational therapy, speech pathology and\naudiology services, recreation, and vocational and rehabilitative\ntraining.\n63.  Defendants have failed to prepare residents for or assist\nthem in securing gainful employment.\n64.  Defendants  have  failed  to  provide  each  resident  an\nindividualized  exit  plan  for  placement  in  a  less  restrictive\nintegrated community setting.\n65.  Activities  such as eating/  toileting, and bathing  are\noften conducted en masse, at predetermined and unchanging times,\nchosen for the convenience of the institution.  This regimentation\ndeprives plaintiffs of the normally experienced freedom and dignity\nof choosing when to attend to their  individual daily tasks and\ninterests,  and  arranging  their  appearances  according  to  their\npersonal taste.\n66.  Physical  and  pharmaceutical  restraint  procedures  are\nfrequently utilized for convenient control of residents and as a\nsubstitute for appropriate care and programs of habilitation.\n21\n\n67.  Southbury Training School has not provided its residents\nwith  minimally  professionally  acceptable  levels  of  active\nprogramming  or habilitation  or protection  from harm, which has\ncaused deterioration and injury to residents and decreased levels\nof safety.\n68.  There are no active habilitation programs for persons\nwith the most severe physical and behavioral handicaps.  Many of\nthe persons with  severe behavioral problems have  not  developed\nthose behaviors as a result of their disabilities.  Rather, they\nare the outgrowth of the inhumane environment, lack of habilitation\nprograms  and  crowded  and  chaotic  conditions  on  living  units.\nPhysically  handicapped  persons  are  also  at  risk  because  basic\ntherapies  and  equipment necessary  to preserve their health and\nprevent loss of use of the limbs are not provided.\n69.  As a result of the conditions set out in paragraphs 47\nthrough  55 above, plaintiff  classmembers have suffered  numerous\nlacerations, broken bones and other serious injuries, have been\nsubjected to frequent physical and mechanical restraints, and have\nsuffered severe physical deterioration.\n22\n\n70.  Medical care at STS is so deficient that plaintiffs are\nexposed to risk of harm and death.\n71.  A substantial percentage of the STS budget is spent on\napproximately  one-third  of the residents who  live  in  federally\ncertified units.  This disproportionate spending on one-third of\nthe  population  deprives  two-thirds  of  the  residents  of  basic\nservices and decent living conditions.\n72.  Do Not Resuscitate Orders are imposed  as a matter of\ncourse on many STS residents who are admitted to community medical\nfacilities for treatment.  Do Not Resuscitate Orders needlessly\nsubject plaintiffs to an increased risk of death.\n73.  Persons with retardation, like all people, are capable of\ngrowth and development throughout life.\n74.  Habilitation is necessary for persons with retardation,\nespecially those with the most severe disabilities, to maintain\ntheir health and safety and protect them from harm and unnecessary\nrestraint.  Without  habilitation  programs  STS  residents  will\nregress and lose the skills they had when admitted to STS.\n75.  No  person  with  retardation  needs  to  be  at  Southbury\nTraining  School.  All  can  live  in  the  community  as  long  as\n23\n\nhabilitative  services,  supervision  and  support  are  provided.\nMultiple handicaps or severe medical conditions do not preclude\npersons with retardation from living safe and productive lives in\nthe community.  In recognition of these facts, no new admissions to\nSTS have been made for nearly a decade.\n76.  A  necessary  condition  of  growth  and  development  and\nmaintenance of skills of persons with retardation is individualized\nhabilitative  programs  and  individualized  relationships  in\nnormalized settings.\n77.  The learning characteristics and capabilities of persons\nwith retardation require that they have an opportunity to receive\nprograms  or training  and habilitation  in environments  that are\nintegrated  (i.e.  allow  for  interaction  between  persons  with\ndisabilities and nondisabled persons).\n78.  The State of Connecticut, like most other  states, has\nadopted  policies  and  professional  practices  based  upon  the\nprofessionally  accepted  facts  concerning  the  developmental\npotential  of  persons  with  retardation  and  the  requirements  of\nnormalization, individualization and integration for persons with\nretardation to realize their developmental potential and, at the\n24\n\nsame time, be protected from harm and unnecessary restraint while\nin the state's care.\n79.  Despite their own policies and professional judgments\nthat each plaintiff and each classmember should be transferred to\nan appropriately structured community setting, defendants have not\nacted to transfer the resources being used to support them at\nSouthbury Training School to the community so that plaintiffs can\nleave STS.\n80.  On or about October 30, 1986 the United States of America\nfiled a lawsuit entitled United States v. State of Connecticut. No.\nN-86-252 (EBB) . At the same time the United States filed and moved\nfor expedited adoption of a Consent Decree.  The court ultimately\napproved the Consent Decree after denying intervenor status to many\nindividuals and organizations, including some of the plaintiffs in\nthis lawsuit, who were directly affected by the Consent Decree.\nThe court's ruling, however, expressly permitted plaintiffs to file\na separate lawsuit if the USA v. Connecticut Consent Decree was not\neffective in remediating violations of the rights of Southbury\nTraining School residents.\n25\n\n81.  Although the USA v. Connecticut Consent Decree has been\nin  effect  for  nearly  nine  years,  the  conditions  at  STS  have\nactually worsened.  A recent investigation  by the United  States\ndocumented gross violations of human rights at STS, many of which\nplace classmembers at risk of serious harm and death.\nCOUNT I;  DUE PROCESS\n82.  The acts and omissions of the defendants deny plaintiffs\nand members  of the plaintiff  class  their  constitutional  rights\nsecured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to\nthe United States Constitution:\na)  to an individually controlled and designed habilitation\nplan and program to help classmembers maintain self-care skills;\nb)  to a humane and decent existence;\nc)  to  habilitation  necessary  to  ensure  that  Southbury\nTraining  School  residents  are  safe  and  free  from  unnecessary\nphysical, mechanical and chemical restraint;\nd)  to  adequate  shelter,  clothing,  nutrition  and  medical\ncare;\ne)  to  have  community  placements  that  are  integrated  in\nsociety that will enable STS residents to enjoy the benefits of\n26\n\ncitizenship;\nf)  to have  all  community  placement decisions made  on an\nindividualized  basis  and  implemented  in  accordance  with  the\nrecommendations of planning teams composed of friends and family\nand professionals who know the person with a disability best and an\nopportunity  to be heard  periodically  on the  appropriateness  of\nplacement  plans prior  to  and  after  discharge  or  transfer  from\nSouthbury Training School;\ng)  to have community placements provided when planning teams\ncomposed of friends, family and professionals who know classmembers\nbest  develop  self-determined  support  plans  and  determine  that\ntransfer  to the community  is necessary to protect classmembers1\nrights under the federal constitution and federal laws;\nh)  to  have  individual  advocates  assist  classmembers  in\nprotecting their rights under state and federal law;\ni)  to have individual budgets to implement the decisions of\nproperly composed planning teams.\nCOUNT II;  DISCRIMINATION CLAIM\n83.  By  failing to provide residents of Southbury  Training\nSchool the opportunity to receive state support in the community\n27\n\nrather than in a segregated institution and by failing to provide\nthe  most  severely  handicapped  residents  of  Southbury  Training\nSchool  with  the  same  opportunity  to benefit  from  programs  and\ncommunity  living  as  are  provided  residents  of  STS  with  mild\ndisabilities, defendants have violated plaintiffs1 rights secured\nby the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. 12132, and the\nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. 794.\nCOUNT III:  SOCIAL SECURITY ACT CLAIM\n84.  Defendants have violated the rights of some three hundred\nresidents  of  Southbury  Training  School by  not providing  active\ntreatment as required by 42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq. by a) failing to\nprovide  training  and  habilitation  services  to  all  residents\nregardless of the nature or severity of his or her disability; b)\nfailing to provide the professional services to residents including\nphysical  therapy,  occupational  therapy,  medical  services  and\npsychological services; c) failing to develop adequate activities\nfor residents; d) failing to provide individual treatment plans; e)\nfailing to evaluate the appropriateness of continued placement at\nSTS; f) failing to develop meaningful discharge plans.\n23\n\nIV.  RELIEF;\nWHEREFORE, proposed plaintiffs respectfully request that this\nCourt:\n1.  Certify  this  case  as  a  class  action  and  designate\nplaintiffs as representatives of a class of persons that includes\nall persons residing at Southbury Training School, all persons who\nmay be placed at or transferred to Southbury Training School at\nsome future date and all persons who have been transferred out of\nSTS yet remain under the Director's custody and control.\n2.  Enjoin defendants from admitting persons to Southbury\nTraining  School  or  transferring  persons  from  STS  unless  such\ntransfer is to an integrated community home with supports developed\nthrough a person-centered planning process by a team comprised of\nthe classmember, his friends, family and professionals who know him\nbest.\n3.  Enjoin defendants to identify through a person-centered\nplanning  process  a  written  plan  for  each  classmember  which\ndescribes the individualized programs, supports and supervision\nnecessary  to  protect  each  classmember  and  to  meet  his/her\nindividualized  needs  and  how  and  when  those  services will be\n29\n\nprovided.\n4.  Enjoin the defendants to identify in a written plan the\ncommunity homes necessary to protect classmembers • rights under the\nUnited States Constitution and federal laws and to remediate the\nenvironmental and program deficiencies identified in this complaint\nand  to  provide  the  community  supports  through  individualized\nperson-centered planning processes.\n5.  Enjoin the defendants to make available individual and\nindependent  advocates  for  each  plaintiff  and  member  of  the\nplaintiff class to assist them in securing their rights.\n6.  Enjoin the defendants to provide plans, support services\nand community living opportunities to all classmembers, regardless\nof the severity or nature of their disabilities.\n7.  Enjoin the defendants to prohibit the use of Do Not\nResuscitate Orders on classmembers until procedures are developed\nand  followed  which  assure  protection  of  rights  secured  to\nclassmembers by the federal Constitution and laws.\n8.  Enjoin the defendants to submit to plaintiffs and the\ncourt  for  its  approval  a  plan  for  the  implementation  of the\naforesaid.\n30\n\n9.

INTRODUCTION\nThe complaint1 in this case was filed October 6, 1994, by\neight present or former residents of Southbury Training School\n(\"STS\") and  three  organizational  plaintiffs  (People  First  of\nConnecticut, ARC/Connecticut, and Western Connecticut Association\nfor Human Rights) as a class action on behalf of all persons with\ndisabilities residing at STS, those who may be placed at STS in the\nfuture, and persons who have been transferred from STS and remain\nunder the custody and control of the Director of STS. Plaintiffs\nhave brought this action to redress unlawful conditions at STS,\nalleging violations of the STS residents1 rights secured by the\nFourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution,\n*A11 references are to the Second Amended Complaint.\n\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act and the\nSocial Security Act.  More specifically, plaintiffs allege, inter\nalia, that:\n(1) The defendants are denying plaintiffs and members of the\nplaintiff  class  their  constitutional  rights  secured  by  the  Due\nProcess  Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United  States\nConstitution:\na)  to  an  individually  controlled  and  designed\nhabilitation plan and program to help classmembers maintain self-\ncare skills;\nb)  to a humane and decent existence;\nc)  to habilitation necessary to ensure that Southbury\nTraining  School  residents  are  safe  and  free  from  unnecessary\nphysical, mechanical and chemical restraint;\nd)  to adequate shelter, clothing, nutrition and medical\ncare;\ne)  to have community placements that are safe, properly\nmonitored and integrated in society;\nf)  to have all community placement decisions made on an\nindividualized  basis  and  implemented  in  accordance  with  the\n\nrecommendations of planning teams composed of friends and family\nand professionals who know the person with a disability best and an\nopportunity to be heard periodically  on the appropriateness of\nplacement plans prior to and after discharge or transfer from\nSouthbury Training School;\ng)  to have community placements provided when planning\nteams  composed  of  friends,  family  and  professionals  who  know\nclassmembers  best  develop  self-determined  support  plans  and\ndetermine that transfer to the community is necessary to protect\nclassmembers1 rights under the federal constitution and federal\nlaws;\nh)  to have individual advocates assist classmembers in\nprotecting their rights under state and federal law;\ni)  to  have  individual  budgets  to  implement  the\ndecisions of properly composed planning teams;\nj)  to life, without due process of law, by developing\nand enforcing standards which permit community hospitals to write\nand implement DNR Orders on nonterminally ill classmembers without\nany process to ensure that the decision to withhold routine medical\ncare is consistent with the best interests of the classmember;\n\n(2) The defendants are violating plaintiffs' rights secured by\nthe  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act,  42  U.S.C.  12132,  and  the\nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. 794 by failing to provide residents\nof  Southbury  Training  School  the  opportunity  to  receive  state\nsupport in the community rather than in a segregated  institution\nand by failing to provide the most severely handicapped residents\nof Southbury Training School with the same opportunity to benefit\nfrom programs and community living as are provided residents of STS\nwith mild disabilities.\n(3)  The  defendants  are  violating  the  rights  of  some  two\nhundred residents of Southbury Training School to active treatment\nas required  by  42 U.S.C.  1396 et  seq. by  a) failing  to provide\ntraining and habilitation services to all residents regardless of\nthe  nature  or  severity  of his  or her disability; b)  failing to\nprovide the professional services to residents including physical\ntherapy, occupational therapy, medical services and psychological\nservices; c) failing to develop adequate activities for residents;\nd)  failing to provide  individual treatment plans; e) failing to\nevaluate  the  appropriateness  of  continued  placement  at  STS; f)\nfailing to develop meaningful discharge plans.\n\nPlaintiffs seek classwide declaratory and injunctive relief\nwhich would:\n(1)  Enjoin  defendants  from  admitting persons  to  Southbury\nTraining  School  or  transferring  persons  from  STS  unless  such\ntransfer is to an integrated community home with supports developed\nthrough a person-centered planning process by a team comprised of\nthe classmember, his friends, family and professionals who know him\nbest ;\n(2)  Enjoin defendants to identify through a person-centered\nplanning  process  a  written  plan  for  each  classmember  which\ndescribes  the  individualized  programs, supports  and  supervision\nnecessary  to  protect  each  classmember  and  to  meet  his/her\nindividualized needs and how those services will be provided;\n(3)  Enjoin the defendants to identify in a written plan the\ncommunity homes necessary to protect classmembers' rights under the\nUnited States Constitution and federal laws and to remediate the\nenvironmental and program deficiencies identified in the complaint\nand to provide  community supports through individualized person-\ncentered planning processes;\n(4)  Enjoin  the  defendants  to  make  available  independent\n\nadvocates for each plaintiff and member of the plaintiff class to\nassist them in securing their rights;\n(5)  Enjoin the defendants to provide plans, support services\nand community living opportunities to classmembers, regardless of\nthe severity or nature of their disabilities;\n(6)  Enjoin  the  defendants  to  prohibit  the  use  of  Do  Not\nResuscitate Orders on classmembers until procedures are developed\nand  followed  which  assure  protection  of  rights  secured  to\nclassmembers by the federal Constitution and laws.\nII. ARGUMENT\nRule 23(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure establishes\nfour prerequisites to the maintenance of a class action suit:\n(a) Prerequisites to a Class Action. One or more members\nof a class may sue or be sued as representative parties\non behalf of all only if  (1) the class is so  numerous\nthat joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there\nare questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the\nclaims  or  defenses  of  the  representative  parties  are\ntypical of the claims and defenses of the class, and (4)\nthe representative  parties will  fairly  and  adequately\nprotect the interests of the class.\nIn addition, Rule 23(b)(2) imposes an additional applicable\n\nrequirement:\nthe party opposing the class has acted or refused to act\non grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby\nmaking  appropriate  final  injunctive  relief  or\ncorresponding  declaratory  relief with respect  to the\nclass as a whole;\nA.  Plaintiffs' Class Satisfies the Numerositv Requirement.\nPlaintiffs in this case seek to represent a class consisting\nof all persons who are now at STS, those who may be placed at STS\nin the future, and persons who have been transferred from STS and\nremain under the custody and control of the Director of STS. At\npresent, according to Presentation on Governor's Proposed Budget\nfor  FY  96-97  dated  February  27, 1995, there  are  871 persons\nresiding at STS.2\nThere is no set number of members that is required to meet\nthe  numerosity  requirement. The federal rules merely require a\ndetermination that the class is so numerous as to make joinder of\n2In view of the fact that there have been no new placements at\nSTS and the ongoing concerns  about the appropriateness  of new\nplacements at STS, it would be, at best, speculative to estimate\nthe number of persons who may be placed at STS in the future.\nNevertheless, plans for the construction of additional facilities\nat STS are being considered by the Connecticut legislature. Thus,\nthere remains a possibility of new placements at STS in the future.\n\nall  members  impracticable.  A  class  consisting  of  at  least  871\nmembers is clearly sufficient to satisfy this requirement.  See\nKorn v. Franchard Corp.. 456 F.2d 1206, 1209 (2nd Cir. 1972) (class\nconsisting of 212 members sufficient); Connecticut Traumatic Brain\nInjury Association  (CTBIA) v. Hoaan. Civil No. H-90-97  (PCD) Slip\nOp. at 3-4  (D.Conn., July 6, 1990)  (Exhibit A)  (110-150 persons\nwith mental retardation and/or brain injury sufficient); National\nSuper Spuds v. New York Mercantile Exchange. 77 F.R.D. \"3*61, 367\n(S.D.N.Y.  1977)  (500 to  1000 members  sufficient).  It  is highly\nunlikely that individual claimants would institute separate suits\nfor  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  in  the  event  class\ncertification  is  denied.  See  CTBIA  v.  Hogan   Slip  Op.  at  2-3\nr\n(citing, Jordan v. County of Los Angeles. 669 F.2d 1311, 1319 (9th\nCir.  1982), vacated  on other grounds. 459 U.S. 810  (1982) and.\nArmstead  v.  Pingree.  629  F.  Supp.  273, 279  (M.D. Fla.  1986)).\nMoreover,  the  proposed  class  members  are  institutionalized\nindividuals with mental retardation, which \"is precisely the type\nof  group  which  class  treatment  was  designed  to  protect.\"  See\nArmstead.  629  F.  Supp.  at  279. Under  these  circumstances  \"the\ndifficulty  or  inconvenience  of  joining  all members makes  class\n\nlitigation  desirable.\"  Koster  v.  Perales.  108  F.R.D  46,  49\n(E.D.N.Y. 1985) (citing. Northwestern National Bank of Minneapolis\nV. Fox & Co. . 102 F.R.D. 507, 511 (S.D.N.Y. 1984)).\nThe inclusion of future members of a class is routine in a\ncivil rights action such as this one seeking injunctive relief\nagainst conduct that is likely to cause future injuries similar to\nthose suffered by the named plaintiffs. 1 Newberg on Class Actions,,\n3.07  (3rd Ed.  1992).  As  a result, in civil rights  cases, the\nmembership  of  the  class  is  usually  \"incapable  of  specific\nenumeration.\" Powell v. Ward. 487 F. Supp. 917, 922 (S.D.N.Y. 1980)\n(citing. Robertson v. National Basketball Association. 389 F. Supp.\n867, 897 (S.D.N.Y. 1975) and Advisory Note to Rule 23). In such\ncircumstances, \"a class action may proceed upon estimates as to the\nsize of the  proposed class.\" Jane B. v. New York City Dep't. of\nSocial Servs.. 117 F.R.D. 64, 70 (S.D.N.Y. 1987) (citing. In re\nAlcoholic Beverages Litigation. 95 F.R.D. 321, 324 (E.D.N.Y. 1982).\n11 [C] lass certification including future members is appropriate.\"\nPowell v. Ward, 487 F.  Supp. at 922 (citing. Gerstein v. Pugh. 420\nU.S.  103, 110-11 n. 11 95 S.Ct. 854, 861 n. 11, 43 L.Ed. 2d 54\n(1974)).\n\nB.  Class  Certification  Is  Appropriate  Because  There  Are\nQuestions of Law and Fact Common to the Entire Class.\nThe requirements of joinder impracticality of Rule 23(a)(1)\nand the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2) are correlative\ntests. \"Thus, a class action is proper only when there is a group\nof  persons  who  share  a  common  issue  and  are  so  numerous  that\njoinder of them all would be impracticable.\" 1 Newbera  3.10.\n\"There is no requirement that the factual basis for the claims\nof  all  members  of  a  proposed  class  be  identical*.\"  Koster  v.\nPerales. 108 F.R.D. at 52; Wilder v. Bernstein. 499 F. Supp. 980,\n992  (S.D.N.Y.  1980);  Abramovitz  v.  Ahem.  96  F.R.D.  208, 216\n(D.Conn. 1982). Nor is there any requirement of absolute identity\nbetween  the  legal theories  supporting  claims  by  class members.\nCTBIA v. Hoqan. Slip. op. at 5 (\"Rule 23 (a) (2) does not require\nthat there are questions of law and fact common to the class but\nrather only requires that there be either legal issue[s] or factual\nissue[s] common to the class.\" Citing. Pottinger v. City of Miami,\n720 F. Supp. 955, 958 (S.D.Fla. 1989) (emphasis in original)); Cf.\nGold Strike Stamp Company v. Christensen. 436 F.2d 791, 796 (10th\nCir.  1970)\n(\"...  where the question  of  basic  liability  can be  established\n10\n\nreadily by common issues, then it is apparent that the case is\nappropriate for class action.\"); Abramovitz. 96 F.R.D. at 216 (\"The\nfact that some individual questions of law and fact also must be\ndecided  will  not  necessarily  defeat  a  request  for  class\ncertification.\"). Rather,  in  actions  such  as  this  one, it is\nsufficient that the claims for declaratory and injunctive relief as\nto which the plaintiffs seek class certification:\n\"challenge several institutional practices and policies\nregarding the provision of ... care to all ....  Those\npractices and policies apply with equal force to, and\naffect similarly, all [residents] within the facility.\nMoreover  the  complaint  details  several  instances  of\ninstitution-wide  inadequacies  ....  These  matters  are\ncommon to all [residents].\"\nDean v. Couahlin. 107 F.R.D. 331, 333-34 (S.D.N.Y. 1985).\nThis  case  satisfies  the  commonality  requirement  of  Rule\n23(a)(2) since the putative class members present similar factual\nsituations which give rise to common legal issues. The plaintiffs\nchallenge STS policies and practices involving  all present and\nfuture residents of that institution and persons in the custody of\nthe Director of STS. STS policies and practices concerning the\nenvironment,  training  and  habilitation  services,  professional\nservices, support services, planning, programming, supervision,\n11\n\nmedical procedures and community living opportunities apply with\nequal force to, and affect similarly all residents of STS, and\npersons  in  the  custody  of  the  Director  of  STS.  The  alleged\ninadequacies in staffing, facilities, policies and procedures at\nSTS are systemic, and are of common concern to all STS residents.\nAlthough putative class members may not have identical habilitative\nor rehabilitative needs or treatment histories, the common facts\nalleged in the Complaint give rise to common legal issues under the\nDue  Process  and  Equal  Protection  clauses  of  the  Fourteenth\nAmendment, as well as federal statutory law. See Armstead. 629 F.\nSupp. at 280  (\"The  conditions at NEFSH and defendants1 policies\nregarding  treatment  of those residents who suffer,  in varying\ndegrees,  from  mental  retardation  are  examples  of  the  factual\nquestions  linking  the  subclasses.11);  Santiago  v.  City  of\nPhiladelphia. 72 F.R.D. 619, 624 (E.D.Pa. 1976).\nC  The Claims of the Representative Parties Are Typical of\nthe Claims of the Class.\n« _ _ — _ * _ _ — _ _ _ — — — — — — _ _^\n•  •  :•»\nThe typicality requirements of Rule 23(a)(3) focus on whether\nthe  named  plaintiffs'  claims  and  the  class  claims  \"are  so\ninterrelated that the interests of the class members will be fairly\n12\n\nand adequately protected in their absence.\" General Telephone Co.\nv.  Falcon.  457  U.S.  147,  157-58  n.13  (1982).  The  typicality\nrequirement demands no showing of complete identity between the\nlegal claims of a representative and each member, but only \"... a\nshowing of sufficient interrelationship between the claims of  the\nrepresentative and those of the class so that adjudication of the\nindividual claims will necessarily involve the decision of common\nquestions affecting the class.\" 1 Newberq  3.17).  Similarly,\nindividual,  factual  discrepancies  between  class  members  and\nrepresentatives do not defeat typicality. See CTBIA v. Hogan. Slip,\nop. at 7 (\"There may be factual distinctions, but their claims\narise from the same allegedly illegal policies and practices and\nare based on legal theories claimed for the entire class.\" Citing.\nJane B. . 117 F.R.D. at 70); Koster v. Perales. 108 F.R.D. at 51-2;\nDean v. Coughlin. 107 F.R.D. at 334. \"All that is required for this\noriginal  certification  is  a  nexus  between  the  claims  of  the\nrepresentatives and those of the other members of the class.\" CTBIA\nv. Hoqan, Slip. op. at  7 (citing. Roby v. St. Louis Southwestern\nRailway Co.. 775 F.2d 959, 962 (8th Cir. 1985); Harrison v. Simon.\n91 F.R.D. 423, 430 (E.D.Pa. 1981)).\n13\n\nIn this case, the nexus between the class members and class\nrepresentatives is plain in all of the representatives' claims. As\nis indicated in the Complaint and above:\n\"... plaintiffs claim systemic behavior and harm. The\nclaims of the class representatives are typical: each has\nbeen  subjected  to  some  or  all  of  the  general,\ninstitution-wide deprivations alleged on behalf of the\nclass.\"\nDean v. Coughlin, 107 F.R.D. at 334. See also Hassine v. Jeffes.\n846 F.2d 169, 178  (3rd Cir. 1988) (complainants1 assertion that\nconditions  existed,  and  that  they  were  subject  to  them, was\nsufficient to require classwide adjudication of claims). There are\nsubstantial questions of law and fact common to the entire class,\nand  claims  of  the  plaintiffs  are  typical  of  the  class  and\npredominate over any questions affecting individual members.  Cf.\nSantiago. 72 F.R.D. at 625 (Same legal theories applied to named\nplaintiffs and future residents. This was supported by allegations\nthat class representatives and members suffered the same types of\ninjuries  as  a  result  of  the  policies  and  practices  of  the\ninstitution. There was a \"close nexus\" between factual questions\nraised  by  the  representatives  and  members  pertaining  to  the\nadministration of and conditions at the institution) . Moreover, as\n14\n\nwas the case in CTBIA v. Hogan;\n\"Because plaintiffs allege violations of law common to\nall members of the class, courts may, despite factual\ndifferences,  certify  the  class  for  purposes  of\ndetermining liability. Then, if conflicts over relief are\napparent, or if discovery reveals that  ... plaintiffs\nhave adverse or distinct interests, the class can be\nsplit  into  subclasses  at  that  time.  Halderman  v.\nPennhurst State Sch. & Hospital. 612 F.2d 84, 109 (3rd\nCir.  1979), rev'd on other grounds. 451 U.S. 1  (1980);\nJacobi v. Bache & Co.. 16 F.R.D. 71, 72-73  (S.D.N.Y.\n1972). In fact \"[i]t is often proper ... for a district\ncourt to view a class action liberally  in the early\nstages  of  litigation, since the class can always be\nmodified or subdivided as issues are refined for trial.\"\nSlip op., at 6.\nD.  The Representative Parties Will Fairly and Adequately\nProtect the Interests of the Class.\nThe prerequisites for satisfying Rule 23 (a) (4) are as follows:\n... an essential concomitant of adequate representation\nis that the party's attorney be qualified, experienced\nand generally able to conduct the proposed litigation.\nAdditionally, it is necessary to eliminate so far as\npossible the likelihood that the litigants are involved\nin a collusive  suit or that plaintiff  has  interests\nantagonistic to those of the remainder of the class.\nEisen v. Carlisle & Jaaueline. 391 F.2d 555, 562 (2nd Cir. 1968).\nWith regard to the qualifications, experience, and abilities\nof counsel, from 1975 to the present Attorney David Shaw has acted\nas lead counsel, or played a central role, in many class action and\n15\n\ncivil rights lawsuits brought to enforce the federal constitutional\nand  statutory  rights  of Connecticut citizens with disabilities.\n(See Exhibit B) . Attorney Frank Laski also has an extensive record\nin litigating cases brought to enforce the rights of persons with\ndisabilities secured by state and federal law.  (See Exhibit C).\nThrough this and other  litigation Attorneys Shaw and Laski\nhave  developed  expertise  in  litigating  civil  rights  cases  for\ndisabled citizens through the federal trial and appellate courts.\nPlaintiffs1  counsel have established themselves as competent and\nvigorous advocates of persons with disabilities, and particularly\nfor persons with mental retardation in institutional settings, and\ncan be expected to pursue such interests in the future.\nThere has been a suggestion by the intervenor applicants that\nthe proposed class representatives have interests in conflict with\nclass  members,  and  that  they  may  act  collusively  with  the\ndefendants in this case. In their Memorandum of Law in Support of\nMotion to Intervene, the Home and School Association of Southbury\nTraining  School, The  Southbury  Training  School Foundation Inc.,\nseveral residents and their guardians  (Southbury Group) asserted\nthat \"defendants espouse some of the same social policies advocated\n16\n\nby plaintiffs in favor of closing STS and placing all STS residents\nin community settings.\"  (Memorandum, at p. 12)\nThis type of general assertion is insufficient to overcome the\nadequacy  of representation, particularly when the policy  issue\nintervenors  posit  as  non-adversarial  and  conflicting  is  not\nproperly before the Court. Plaintiffs' complaint does not seek\nclosure of STS. Even if the complaint did ask for such relief, it\nwould be beyond the power of this court to grant it.3 Rather, the\n3 In Richard C. v. Snider. C.A. No. 89-2038 (N.D. Pa. 6/22/93)\n(attached), an organization of parents and guardians, similar to\nintervenor applicants have challenged the closure of a Pennsylvania\nfacility for the mentally retarded (Western Center), Judge Standish\nwrote:\nThe Court has no authority to direct [defendants] to deliver\nits services to any particular facility.  The state has the\npower to relocate its residents for its own administrative\nneeds or unilaterally to close any of it institutions for\neconomic or other reasons.  Id., Slip Op. at pp. 19-20.\nAccord Le 1 sz v. Kavanauqh. 783 F. Supp. 286, 291, 298 (N.D.Tex..\n1991).  More  recently  Judge  Wolf,  in  Massachusetts,  denied\nintervention to a group that raised interests similar to Southbury\ninterests here.  The Court's reasoning applies here:\nThe Association's submission expresses its intention to argue\nthe value  of  a centralized  institution  such  as  Dever as\nopposed to community-based placements for certain individuals\nand the importance of Dever remaining open. ... However, the\nrelative  value  of  Dever  as compared  to  increased  use of\n(continued. ..)\n17\n\ncourt's role is to ensure that placements, like other treatment\ndecisions,  are  being  made  pursuant  to  professional  judgment,\nYounabera  v.  Romeo.  457  U.S.  307,  315-319  (1982);  and  the\nnondiscrimination mandates of the Americans with Disabilities Act\n42 U.S.C.  12132  and Rehabilitation Act  29 U.S.C.  794  and the\nrequirements of the Social Security Act 42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq..\nThe Intervenor applicants have not alleged that the program or\nplacement  decisions  of  the  STS  interdisciplinary  teams  are\ninadequate.  Even  if  they  had  made  this  allegation,  there are\nextensive state-law procedures already in place for resolving a\ndispute  over  interdisciplinary  team  decisions.  The  relief\nplaintiffs  have requested  specifically  contemplates  a planning\nprocess  for  each  resident  of  STS by  a team  comprised  of the\nresident, his guardians, family and professionals who know him\nbest.  The  plan  would  describe  \"the  individualized  programs,\n3(...continued)\ncommunity-based facilities is a question who resolution is\ncommitted to the democratically accountable political branches\nof the Commonwealth of Massachusetts government as long as\nthey  act  in  accordance  with  law.  This  court  does  not\nunderstand that it has been asked by plaintiffs to decide this\npolicy question and, in any event, does not intend to do so.\nHealev v. Weld. C.A. No. 94-11804-MLW (11/23/94) (attached).\n18\n\nsupports and supervision necessary to protect each classmember and\nto  meet  his/her  individualized  needs  and  how  and  when  these\nservices will  be provided.\"  (Complaint p. 29, para.  3).  Any\nparent, guardian or resident who disagrees with the recommendations\nof his/her planning team has a right to a hearing.  At that hearing\nthe burden  is on the  state  to  show by  \"clear  and  convincing\nevidence\"  that  the  placement  recommendations  are  in  the  STS\nresident's best interest.4\nThe Southbury Group has made no showing that plaintiffs will\nnot vigorously represent the interests of all residents, but simply\nexpresses a difference of opinion with some of the plaintiff parent\norganizations on the issue of whether STS should remain open —  a\ndifference of opinion that has no relevance to this litigation. As\nto unconstitutional conditions, the Southbury Group complained not\nthat  plaintiffs  are  inadequate,  but  that  they  are  overly\nadversarial  saying  \"plaintiffs  have  grossly  exaggerated  the\ndeficiencies of the case provided at STS\" (Memorandum, at 12). In\n4This standard appears in Administrative Directive # 15.\nThis provision was negotiated by plaintiffs and was ultimately\napproved by the Intervenor Applicants when they approved the\nC.A.R.C. v. Thome Consent Decree.  A copy of Administrative\nDirective # 15 is attached as Exhibit D.\n19\n\ntheir  answer, the  Southbury  Group  adopts  a defendant's  posture\ndenying,  demurring  and  diminishing  the  allegations  of\nunconstitutional  conditions  set  forth  in  plaintiffs  complaint.\nAlthough the Southbury group has displayed at length  its policy\ndisagreements with the plaintiffs and defendants, it did not come\nclose  to  demonstrating  inadequacy  of  representation.5  If  any\nsubstantial  conflict over a material  issue  should  arise  in the\ncourse of this litigation, there will be ample opportunity for the\ncourt to address it at that time. See CTBIA v. Hoaan   Slip op. at\nf\n6.\nMoreover, the Southbury Group chooses to ignore the record of\nrigorous  representation  in  opposition  to  plaintiffs  in  related\nlitigation, C.A.R.C. v. Thome  (the Mansfield  case) . The highly\nadversarial  nature  of  the  pre-trial  and  trial  phase  of  the\nMansfield  case  and  the  decades  of  litigation  during  the\nimplementation stage belie any suggestion of collusion hinted at by\nSouthbury  Intervenors. Cf. In re Agent Orange Product  Liability\nLitigation. 996 F.2d 1425, 1436 (2nd Cir. 1993) (\"By all accounts,\n5The  Home  and  School Association  agreed  to  and  signed  the\nConsent  Decree  negotiated  by  the  attorneys  for  the  class  in\nC.A.R.C. v. Thome.\n20\n\nthe negotiations were arm's-length and adversarial  . . . . \" ).\nThe named plaintiffs do not have interests divergent from the\nrest of the residents at STS. See Dean v. Couqhlin. 107 F.R.D. at\n334; Wilder v. Bernstein. 499 F. Supp. at 993 (\"The  fact that some\nmembers of the class may be personally satisfied with the existing\nsystem  and  may  prefer  to  leave  the  violation  of  their  rights\nunremedied is simply not dispositive to a determination under Rule\n23(a).\").  Since,  in  this  case,  the  commonality  and  typicality\nrequirements, are satisfied, the vigorous prosecution of claims by\nthe named plaintiffs is ensured. There is no substantial reason to\ndoubt  that  the  named  plaintiffs  will  adequately  represent  the\ninterests  of  residents  of  STS  on  their  claims  relating  to\nunconstitutional conditions and statutory violations.\nE.  The Requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) are Satisfied in That\nDefendants  Have  Acted  or  Refused  to  Act  on  Grounds\nGenerally  Applicable  to  the  Class,  Thereby  Making\nAppropriate  Final  Injunctive  Relief  or  Corresponding\nDeclaratory Relief With Respect to the Class as a Whole.\nHaving satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(a),  plaintiffs\nmust also satisfy one of the provisions of Rule 23 (b). \"[I]t is\nwell established  that civil rights actions are the paradigmatic\n23(b)(2) class suits, for they  seek classwide structural relief\n21\n\nthat would clearly rebound equally to the benefit of each class\nmember.\" Marcera v. Chinlund. 595 F.2d 1231, 1240 (2nd Cir. 1979),\nvacated on other grounds sub nom. Lombard v. Marcera. 442 U.S. 915\n(1979). See also Colev v. Clinton. 635 F.2d 1364, 1378 (8th Cir.\n1980) (Rule 23(b)(2) held to be \"an especially appropriate vehicle\nfor civil rights actions\" seeking prison or hospital reform. This\nprinciple limits a district court's discretion to refuse to certify\na class); Dean v. Coughlin. 107 F.R.D. at 335; Ram v. Blum. 533 F.\nSupp. 933, 938  (S.D.N.Y.  1982);  Santiago. 72 F.R.D.  at 625-26\n(subsection  \"liberally  applied  in  the  area  of  civil  rights,\nincluding suits challenging conditions and practices at various\ndetention facilities\").\nAlthough the plaintiffs need not prove the necessity of class\ncertification,  see  Nelson  v.  Regan.  560  F.  Supp.  1101, 1105\n(D.Conn. 1983), aff'd. 731 F.2d 105 (2nd Cir. 1984), cert, denied.\n469 U.S. 853  (1984), Rule 23(b)(2) class certification may be\ninappropriate  where  a  class  action  designation  is  \"largely  a\nformality.\" Galvan v. Levine. 490 F.2d 1255, 1261 (2nd Cir. 1973),\ncert, denied. 417 U.S. 936 (1974). In this case, certification of\nthe class is justified because plaintiffs seek to mandate certain\n22\n\nactions  by  the  defendants.  See  Jane  B. .  117  F.R.D.  at  72\n(\"Certification  of  the  class  is  necessary  to  guarantee  that\nmandatory  relief  runs  to  the  benefit  of  all  members  of  the\nclass.11); Koster v. Perales. 108 F.R.D. at 55. The mandatory relief\nrequested by plaintiff class includes court orders: (1) requiring\ndefendants to identify a written plan for each classmember to meet\nhis/her  individualized  needs;  (2) requiring  the  defendants to\nidentify in a written plan the community homes necessary to protect\nclassmembers' rights and to remediate the environmental and program\ndeficiencies  identified  in  this  complaint;  (3)  requiring  the\ndefendants to make available independent advocates for each member\nof the plaintiff class; and (4) requiring the defendants to provide\nsupport services, habilitative programs and decent care to all '\nclassmembers. Under these circumstances, class certification is\nboth necessary and appropriate to ensure that relief runs equally\nto all members of the class.\nAdditional  factors  also  make  23(b)(2)  certification\nappropriate including: (a) the need to facilitate the enforcement\nof a favorable judgment, Westcott v. Califano. 460 F. Supp. 737,\n746 (D. Mass. 1978);  Koster v. Perales. 108 F.R.D. at 54-55;\n23\n\n(b) judicial  economy, Alton v.  Coughlin.  109  F.R.D.  609, 612\n(S.D.N.Y. 1986); Wilder v. Bernstein. 499 F. Supp. at 994; (c)\nthere is no commitment by defendants that prospective relief would\nbe uniformly applied, Dionne v. Boulev. 757 F.2d 1344, 1356 (1st\nCir. 1985); Wilder v. Bernstein. 499 F. Supp. at 994; and (d) class\ncertification does not impose any significant burden on the court.\nDionne v. Bouley. 757 F.2d at 1356.\nIn sum, this is a proper class action under Rules 23(a) and\n23(b)(2)6 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons discussed above, it is respectfully requested\nthat this Court certify this case as a class action and designate\nplaintiffs as representatives of a class of persons that includes\nall persons residing at Southbury Training School, all persons who\nmay be placed at or transferred to Southbury Training School at\n6 Although a class action is superior to any other available\nmethod for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy,\nthe \"superior method\" criterion is not applicable to matters sought\nto be certified under Rule 23(b)(2) See Penland v. Warren County\nJail. 797 F.2d  332, 334-35  (6th Cir. 1986). Also, because the\nplaintiff class requests to be certified under Rule 23(b)(2) the\nmandatory notice provision of Rule 23(c)(2) does not apply. See\nFrost v. Weinberger, 515 F.2d 57, 65 (2nd Cir. 1975), cert, denied.\n424 U.S. 958 (1976).\n24\n\nsome future date and all persons who have been transferred out of\nSTS yet remain under the Director's custody and control.\nINDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS AND PLAINTIFF,\nPEOPLE £IRST OF CONNECTICUT, INC.,\nBY.\nDavid C.

In 1986, the United States Department of Justice sued the State of \nConnecticut under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (“CRIPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 et seq. (1997) to remedy \n \nunconstitutional conditions at STS. The two parties negotiated a Consent Decree providing for a comprehensive remedial plan to \n  17 \n \n\nMessier v. Southbury Training School, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (1999)   \n \nameliorate conditions at the institution. This Court approved the Consent Decree on December 22, 1986. See United States v. \nConnecticut, No. N–86–252 (EBB) (D.Conn. Dec. 22, 1986) (Order Approving Consent Decree). \nIn 1990 and 1991, the Court approved two additional Consent Orders, which were negotiated in response to continuing \ndeficiencies in the care and treatment of STS residents. When more deficiencies were discovered in 1993, the Court ruled the \nState in contempt of its prior orders. To correct the problem, the Court appointed a special master to evaluate the State’s \ncompliance and oversee the implementation of a remedial plan. The special master’s role continues at the present time. \n \n2  In contrast to the usual situation where the moving party is the defendant, when a plaintiff moves for summary judgment, a higher \ninitial burden of going forward must be satisfied. In such cases, plaintiffs must show not only that no genuine issues of material \n \nfact exist, but also that the evidence establishes each element of its prima facie case. Only then will the burden shift to the \ndefendant to rebut this showing. In moving for partial summary judgment, plaintiffs must meet this standard. \n \n3  DSS correctly notes that a state may not be sued in federal court under the Eleventh Amendment. See Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U .S. \n1 (1890). As a result, the State of Connecticut and any of its agencies are not proper defendants in this case. However, prospective \n \ninjunctive relief may be awarded against state officers in their official capacity to halt violations of federal law under the doctrine \nof Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908). While acknowledging this reality, the Court nonetheless will refer to the defendants by \ntheir state agency names for the sake of simplicity, with an understanding that the state officials are the true parties in the case. \n \n4  In this ruling, the Court grants summary judgment in favor of DSS on this claim. See infra Part III. \n \n \n5  The Court grants summary judgment in favor of DSS, DPH, and DMR on all claims asserted against them under the Social \nSecurity Act. See infra Part IV. Because all claims against DSS have been dismissed, the agency is no longer a defendant in this \n \ncase. \n \n6  The Court grants summary judgment in favor of DPH on this claim. See infra Part V. Because all claims against DPH have been \ndismissed, the agency is no longer a defendant in this case. \n \n \n7  The elements of a Section 504 prima facie case are virtually identical, except that Section 504 covers entities receiving federal \nfinancial assistance, whereas Title II of the ADA covers public entities. See Rothschild v. Grottenthaler, 907 F.2d 286, 289–90 (2d \n \nCir.1990). \n \n8  This regulation is almost identical to Section 504’s integration regulation. \n \n \n9  Pursuant to Section 504, the former Department of Health, Education and Welfare, now the Department of Health and Human \nServices, promulgated similar regulations: \n \nA recipient [of federal funding], in providing any aid, benefit or service, may not ... [p]rovide different or separate aid, \nbenefits or services to handicapped persons or to any class of handicapped persons unless such action is necessary to provide \nqualified handicapped persons with aid, benefits or services that are as effective as those provided to others. \n45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(1). \n \n10  See (Moore Aff.App. Community Referral Placement Report, 7/1/94–5/14/98) reprinted in Appendix. \n \n \n11  See infra Part V for a complete discussion of the constitutional elements of standing. \n \n \n12  The Court stated that: \n[P]laintiffs’ claims relating to community placement are not brought against DSS and DPHAS, except to the extent that 42 \n \nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(31) and 42 C.F.R. § 456.609 require inspection teams to determine whether it is ‘necessary and desirable’ \nthat ICF/MR residents’ remain in their current placement, and whether it is feasible to meet their needs through ‘alternative \ninstitutional or noninstitutional services.’ 42 C.F.R. § 456.609. \n[I]t is unclear to the Court whether plaintiffs assert violations by DPHAS of its facility inspection duties .... If plaintiffs in fact \nassert violations of DPHAS’ inspection duties in addition to DSS’ inspection duties, then plaintiffs must promptly seek to \namend their complaint to reflect this distinction. However, whether or not plaintiffs assert such violations by DPHAS, the \nstatutory scheme clearly requires DSS to take the corrective actions outlined in 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(i) and 42 C.F.R. §§ \n442.117–442.119 upon a finding of deficiencies found pursuant to either DPHAS’ facility inspections or DSS’ IR inspections. \nRuling Mot. Dismiss by DSS and DPH at 10 n.7, 20–21 n.12 (emphasis in original). \n \n13  The Court previously allowed plaintiffs to establish standing based on their allegation that at some point one of the named \nmembers of the class would be transferred to a community hospital and subjected to an improper DNR order. See Ruling Mot. \n \nClass Certification at 4–5. Actual evidence is needed at the summary judgment stage. \n \n14  In plaintiffs’ opposition, they “dispute” whether there has been informed consent. However, they provide no citation to any \n  18 \n \n\nMessier v. Southbury Training School, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (1999)   \n \n  evidence to support this proposition. (Pls.’ Mem. Opp. Summ. J. at 21.) While conclusory allegations may suffice earlier in the \ncase, plaintiffs must present actual evidence at the summary judgment stage. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. \n \n15  In response to interrogatories, plaintiffs stated that they “have no basis, based on currently available information, to allege that \nDNR orders on these individuals were issued at the direction or in consultation with officials or employees of the Department of \n \nPublic Health.” (Pls.’ Updated Resp.

The\nplaintiffs,  who  seek  solely  injunctive  relief,  allege\nconstitutional and statutory violations relating to the conditions,\nservices and programs at STS.  On January 25, 1999, a 123-day bench\ntrial was commenced before the court.  The case is now ready for\ndecision.\nBACKGROUND\nOn July 8, 1996, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n23(b),  the  court  certified  the  plaintiff  class  to  include  all\ncurrent STS residents, persons who might be placed at STS in the\nfuture, and persons who were transferred from STS but remain under\nthe control of the STS Director.  As of the date of the trial in\n1\n\nthis case, the plaintiff class included approximately 700 residents\nof STS.1  The defendants in this case are STS itself, the Director\nof  STS,  and  the  Commissioner  of  the  Connecticut  Department  of\nMental Retardation (“DMR”).2 \nFirst, the plaintiffs claim that STS and DMR violated the\nclass members’ substantive due process rights by (1) failing to\nprovide adequate shelter, clothing, nutrition, and medical care;\n(2) failing to provide adequate habilitation and training services\nto class members such that class members could retain self-care\nskills and remain free from the unnecessary use of restraints; (3)\nfailing to provide safe conditions to class members and to protect\nthem from bodily harm; and (4) failing to exercise professional\njudgment in making decisions about whether or not to place class\nmembers in the community rather than at STS.  (Third Am. Compl. ¶¶\n1Pursuant to a consent decree, there have been no new\nadmissions to STS since the 1980s, and as a result, the majority\nof STS residents are over 45 years in age.  Most class members\nhave lived at the institution since being placed there as\nchildren.  In 1997, more than 600 residents had lived at STS for\nmore than 30 years and 188 residents were older than 61.  As of\n1997, 158 residents were labeled as severely retarded and an\nadditional 440 were labeled as profoundly retarded.  The\nremaining residents have moderate or mild retardation, or, in a\ncouple of cases, no retardation at all.\n2The Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Social\nServices (“DSS”) and the Commissioner of the Connecticut\nDepartment of Public Health (“DPH”) were originally named as\ndefendants in this case.  The court granted these two defendants’\nmotions for summary judgment and they were accordingly dismissed\nfrom the case.  Messier v. Southbury Training School, No.\n94-CV-1706, 1999 WL 20910 at *5 nn.5, 6 (D. Conn. Jan. 5, 1999). \n2\n\n48-64, 69-75, 83, 86(a)-(I).)\nSecond,  the  plaintiffs claim that the defendants violated\nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA” or\n“Title II”), 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (1997), and Section 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section 504”), 29 U.S.C. § 794 (1997),\nby failing to place class members in community-based residential\nsettings.  The plaintiffs claim that the defendants violated these\nstatutes in two different ways.  The plaintiffs first claim that\nSTS and DMR violated the “integration mandates” of the ADA and\nSection 504 by failing to make sufficient efforts to place class\nmembers into integrated settings in the community. (Id. ¶ 87.)  The\nplaintiffs’ second claim under the ADA and Section 504 is that the\ndefendants discriminated on the basis of the severity of class\nmembers’ disabilities by failing to consider community placement\nfor certain profoundly and severely retarded STS residents.  (Id.\n¶¶ 81, 83, 87.)\nThird, the plaintiffs seek relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983\nfor violations of Title XIX of the Social Security Act (“Title\nXIX”), codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1396a et seq., which governs the\ncertification that is required by an intermediate care facility for\nthe  mentally  retarded  (“ICF/MR”)  in  order  to  receive  certain\nfederal  funding.    The  plaintiffs  claim  that  the  defendant\nCommissioner of DMR violated Title XIX by failing to provide some\nclass members with “active treatment” as required by § 42 U.S.C. §\n3\n\n1396d(d),  as  well  as  by  failing  to  provide  medical  and  other\nservices consistent with that statute.  (Third Am. Compl. ¶ 88.)\nMany of the instances of inadequate medical care, security and\nhabilitation programming at STS have been the subject of a related\ncase,  United  States  v.  Connecticut,  No.  3:86-cv-252  (D.  Conn.\n1986), which was, until recently, pending before this court.  The\nUnited States v. Connecticut litigation was initiated in 1986, when\nthe United States Department of Justice brought suit against the\nState of Connecticut seeking to remedy allegedly unconstitutional\nconditions at STS.  Later in 1986, a consent decree was negotiated\nby the parties and was approved by the court.  The court approved\nadditional consent decrees in 1990 and 1991.  In 1993, attorneys\nfrom the Department of Justice, along with a team of experts,\ninvestigated conditions at STS and concluded that the defendants\nhad failed to comply with the consent decrees.  See United States\nv. Connecticut, 931 F. Supp. 974, 975-76 (D. Conn. 1996). \nAfter  conducting  a  hearing,  the  court  found  by  clear  and\nconvincing evidence that defendants had not complied with the terms\nof the consent decree and held them in contempt.  Id.  The contempt\nhearing revealed numerous deficiencies in the conditions at STS and\nthe services and programs provided to its residents.   The court\nfound that “STS’s systemic flaws [had] caused many residents to\nsuffer grave harm, and, in several instances, death.”  Id. at 983-\n84.  The court found that STS provided inadequate medical care to\n4\n\nits residents.  Id. at 980.  The court found that STS had failed to\nimplement the habilitation programs needed to train residents to\navoid  injury.    Id.  at  977-78.    The  court  found  that  STS\nadministered  behavior  modifying  medication  in  cases  where  the\ninstitution should have provided habilitation.  Id. at 979-80.  The\ncourt  found  that  physical  therapy  services  as  STS  were  so\ninadequate as to have caused “several residents who, only a few\nyears earlier, were ambulatory, to be permanently bed-ridden.”  Id.\nat 983.\nIn United States v. Connecticut, as the plaintiffs here were\naware, the court appointed a Special Master to review many aspects\nof care  and  treatment at STS and to work with the parties in\nimplementing changes to STS’s operations.  Id. at 985.  Following\nhis appointment in 1997, Special Master David Ferleger and the\nparties  created  a  comprehensive  Remedial  Plan  that  specified\ncertain objectives upon which the parties had agreed.  Remedial\nPlan, U.S. v. Conn. (April 1, 1998).3  The Remedial Plan set forth\n95 Court Requirements (“CR”), thus establishing standards that the\ninstitution would be required to meet in order to purge itself of\ncontempt.  These Court Requirements covered most areas of STS’s\noperations  including  staffing,  quality  assessment  procedures,\nmedical  treatment,  administration  of  medication,  habilitation\n3In citing documents filed in United States v. Connecticut,\nthe court will use the abbreviation “U.S. v. Conn” followed by\nthe date on which the document was docketed.\n5\n\nprogramming, and case management.  \nIn  a  process  of  evaluation  lasting  almost  a  decade,  the\nSpecial Master, with the assistance of experts commissioned by him\nand the parties, measured improvements at STS against the standards\nset  forth  in  the  Court  Requirements.    Periodically,  when  the\nSpecial  Master  concluded  that  the  defendants  had  demonstrated\ncompliance with a particular Court Requirement, he recommended that\nthe court release STS from oversight for that Court Requirement.\nFinally, in 2006, after the Special Master found STS to be in\ncompliance with all remaining requirements of the Remedial Plan,\nthe  court  released  STS  from  judicial  oversight  and  purged  the\ndefendants of contempt.  See Order Purging Defendants of Contempt\nand Ending Active Judicial Oversight, U.S. v. Conn., (Mar. 24,\n2006). \nDISCUSSION AND FINDINGS\nI.  The Due Process Requirements for Programs and Services at\nState-Run Institutions\nResidents  of  state-operated  institutions  for  the  mentally\nretarded “have a constitutional right to adequate food, shelter,\nclothing and medical care.”  Society for Good Will to Retarded\nChildren, Inc. v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239, 1243 (2d Cir. 1984) (citing\nYoungberg  v.  Romeo,  457  U.S.  307,  316  (1982),  and  Estelle  v.\nGamble,  429  U.S.  97  (1976)).    Residents  also  have  a\nconstitutionally  protected  interest  in  safe  conditions  and  in\nfreedom from bodily restraint except to the extent that restraint\n6\n\nmust be used to assure safety.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315-16, 323;\nsee also Society for Good Will, 737 F.2d at 1245.  Due process also\nrequires that an institution provide its residents with a minimal\nlevel of training, or “habilitation.”4  Youngberg 457 U.S. at 324.\nThese constitutional requirements are satisfied when state\nactors have exercised “professional judgment” in determining what\nservices and care should be provided to residents of state-run\ninstitutions.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 321-22.  This standard, which\nis  highly  deferential  to  the  decisions  of  the  state’s\nprofessionals, is intended to strike a balance between the “liberty\ninterest of the individual” and the “legitimate interests of the\nState, including the fiscal and administrative burdens additional\nprocedures would entail.”  Id. at 321 (citing Parham v. J.R., 442\nU.S. 584, 599-600 (1979)).  Under this standard, a “decision, if\nmade by a professional, is presumptively valid.”  Id. at 323. \nPlaintiffs may demonstrate a violation of the requirement that\nthe state exercise professional judgment in at least two ways.\nPlaintiffs will prevail, for example, when state actors “simply\nfailed  to  exercise  any  professional  judgment.”    See,  e.g.,\nValentine v. Strange, 597 F. Supp. 1316, 1318 (D.C. Va. 1984)\n4The court uses the terms “habilitation” and “training” more\nor less synonymously, as do the parties.  See Youngberg, 457 U.S.\nat 309 n.1 (explaining that the “principal focus of habilitation\nis upon training and development of needed skills”) (quoting\nBrief for American Psychiatric Association as Amicus Curiae at 4,\nn.1).  \n7\n\n(declining to dismiss complaint by patient who set fire to herself\nafter  hospital  officials  took  no  action  to  confiscate  her\ncigarettes and lighter despite the fact that she had unsuccessfully\nattempted to burn herself earlier in the day).  Deference under\nYoungberg is not owed to decisions made by individuals who are not\nqualified professionals.  See, e.g., Cameron v. Tomes, 783 F. Supp.\n1511, 1520-21 (D. Mass. 1992) (finding due process violation where\nfacility’s administrator ignored recommendation of professionals\nand ordered a patient to be transported in shackles).  For the\npurposes of determining whether such judgment has been exercised,\na  professional  is  defined  as  “a  person  competent,  whether  by\neducation, training or experience, to make the particular decision\nat issue.”  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 323 n.30.\nPlaintiffs  may  also  prevail  where  a  decision  made  by  a\nqualified  professional  was  “such  a  substantial  departure  from\naccepted  professional  judgment,  practice,  or  standards  as  to\ndemonstrate that the person responsible actually did not base the\ndecision on such a judgment.”  Id. at 323; see also Terrance v.\nNorthville Regional Psychiatric Hosp., 286 F.3d 834, 850 (6th Cir.\n2002).  Plaintiffs cannot establish a violation of constitutional\nnorms merely by showing that the state did not “follow[] . . . the\noptimal course of treatment.”  Society for Good Will, 737 F.2d at\n1248.    A  court  cannot  find  a  constitutional  violation  simply\nbecause  experts  testify  that  they  would  have  made  a  different\n8\n\ntreatment choice.  P.C. v. McLaughlin, 913 F.2d 1033, 1043 (2d Cir.\n1990) (“The requirement that professional judgment be exercised is\nnot an invitation to a court reviewing it to ascertain whether in\nfact the best course of action was taken.”); Griffith v. Ledbetter,\n711 F. Supp. 1108, 1110 (N.D. Ga. 1989).  Generally, testimony of\nthe plaintiffs’ experts will be relevant to show that the decisions\nmade substantially departed from professional standards.  Society\nfor  Good  Will,  737  F.2d  at  1248  (“Expert  testimony  is  .  .  .\nrelevant not because of the expert’s own opinions-which are likely\nto diverge widely-but because that testimony may shed light on what\nconstitutes  minimally  acceptable  standards  across  the\nprofession.”); see also Youngberg, 457 at 323 n.31. \nII.  Collateral Estoppel\nIn  their  Post-Trial  Brief,  the  plaintiffs  argue  that  the\ndefendants  are  collaterally  estopped  from  claiming  that  the\nconditions  and  services  at  STS  satisfy  the  constitutional\nrequirements established in Youngberg.  (Pl.’s Post-Trial Br. at\n148.)  The plaintiffs argue that the defendants “resolved such\nissues  by  entering  into  a  consent  decree  in  United  States  v.\nConnecticut” and are therefore barred from relitigating the issues\ncovered in the consent decree.5  (Id.)  \n5The plaintiffs also raised this argument in a Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment filed on September 3, 1999 (Doc. No.\n746).  The court denied the motion on the ground that it was\nuntimely, but allowed the plaintiffs to raise the argument again\nin their post-trial brief.  (Doc. No. 780)\n9\n\n“Under  the  doctrine  of  offensive  collateral  estoppel,  a\nplaintiff may preclude a defendant from relitigating an issue the\ndefendant has previously litigated and lost to another plaintiff.”\nFaulkner v. Nat’l Geographic Enters. Inc., 409 F.3d 26, 37 (2d Cir.\n2005) (citing Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 329\n(1979)).    The  defendants  will  be  estopped  from  rearguing  the\nconstitutionality of conditions and services at STS only if all\nfour conditions of the following test are satisfied:\n(1) the identical issue was raised in a previous proceeding;\n(2)  the  issue  was  actually  litigated  and  decided  in  the\nprevious  proceeding;  (3)  the  party  had  a  full  and  fair\nopportunity to litigate the issue; and (4) the resolution of\nthe issue was necessary to support a valid and final judgment\non the merits. \nBoguslavsky v. Kaplan, 159 F.3d 715, 720 (2d Cir. 1998) (quotations\nomitted); see also Faulkner, 409 F.3d at 37 (quoting Gelb v. Royal\nGlobe Ins. Co., 798 F.2d 38, 44 (2d Cir. 1986)).\nThe flaw in the plaintiffs’ collateral estoppel argument is\nthat the constitutional claims they raise in this case were not\n“actually litigated and decided” in United States v. Connecticut.\nThe consent decree was a settlement, not a judgment on the merits.\nEven insofar as some of the constitutional issues raised by the\nplaintiffs in this case are identical to some of the claims raised\nby the Department of Justice in the earlier case, the court did\nnot, in approving the consent decree, decide those issues.\n  “[S]ettlements  ordinarily  occasion  no  issue  preclusion\n(sometimes called collateral estoppel), unless it is clear  . . .\n10\n\nthat the parties intend their agreement to have such an effect.”\nArizona  v.  California,  530  U.S.  392,  414  (2000).    In  some\ninstances,  a  consent  judgment  “may  involve  a  determination  of\nquestions of fact and law by the court.”  United States v. Int’l\nBldg. Co., 345 U.S. 502, 505-6 (1953).  However, “unless a showing\nis  made  that  that  was  the  case,  the  judgment  has  no  greater\ndignity,  so  far  as  collateral  estoppel  is  concerned,  than  any\njudgment entered only as a compromise of the parties.”  Id.; see\nalso Klingman v. Levinson 831 F.2d 1292, 1296 (7th Cir. 1987) (“If\nthe parties to a consent decree ‘indicated clearly the intention\nthat  the  decree  to  be  entered  shall  not  only  terminate  the\nlitigation of claims but, also, determine finally certain issues,\nthen their intention should be effectuated.’”) (quoting  Kaspar\nWire Works, Inc. v. Leco Eng’g & Mach., Inc., 575 F.2d 530, 539\n(5th Cir. 1978)). \nAs the defendants point out, the consent decree in United\nStates  v.  Connecticut  explicitly  disclaimed  any  admission  of\nliability on the part of state officials and stated that the decree\nwas “enforceable only by the parties.”  (See Defs.’ Post-Trial Br.\nat 27 (quoting Consent Decree, U.S. v. Conn (Dec. 12, 1986).)  In\nentering into the decree, the parties agreed that state officials\ndid “not admit any violation of law” and that the Consent Decree\n“may  not  be  used  as  evidence  of  liability  in  any  other  civil\nproceeding.”  Consent Decree at 3, U.S. v. Conn (Dec. 12, 1986).\n11\n\nIt  is  therefore  obvious  that  the  parties  in  United  States  v.\nConnecticut  did  not  intend  the  consent  decree  to  act  as  a\ndetermination  of  questions  of  law  or  fact  that  would  preclude\nfuture litigation of those issues in other cases involving other\nparties.6\nIn  their  Reply  to  the  Defendants’  Post-Trial  Brief,  the\nplaintiffs offer an additional collateral estoppel argument.  The\nplaintiffs now argue that the court’s contempt findings in United\nStates  v.  Connecticut  bar  the  defendants  from  asserting  the\n6The cases cited by the plaintiffs in support of their\ncollateral estoppel argument are distinguishable or inapplicable. \nThe court’s analysis in United States v. Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters,\n931 F.2d 177 (2d Cir. 1991), involved the effect of a consent\ndecree on affiliates of the labor union that had entered into to\nthe decree, which is a very different question from the one\npresented here.  Hutton Constr. Co. v. Int’l Fid., No. 97-7868,\n1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 14968 (2d Cir. April 21, 1998), involved the\nrule that a consent decree may have issue preclusive effect only\nwhere the decree involved a determination of issues of law or\nfact by the court.  No such determination was made by the court\nin United States v. Connecticut.  Similarly, in United States v.\nTennessee, No. 98-5108, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 9842 (6th Cir. May\n14, 1999), the issue of collateral estoppel arose only after the\ndistrict court made determinations of law and fact.  The other\ncase cited by the plaintiffs, Yachts America, Inc. v. United\nStates, 673 F.2d 356 (Ct. Cl. 1982), is factually distinguishable\nbecause the issue of collateral estoppel was raised by the\ndefendants, who were not parties to the consent decree at issue,\nagainst the plaintiffs, who were attempting to relitigate an\nissue that had been resolved against them in the consent decree. \nIn that case, because of the “broad language contained in the\nconsent decree precluding further suit,” the Court of Claims\nfound that the plaintiffs intended to be bound by the terms of\nthe consent decree even when suing a non-party to the decree.” \nId. at 362.  The defendants in this case indicated no comparable\nintent to be bound by the United States v. Connecticut Consent\nDecree.\n12\n\nconstitutionality of the conditions and services at STS.  (See\nPls.’ Reply at 75-79.)  However, in finding contempt in that case,\nthe court was required only to consider whether the defendants had\nviolated  the  terms  of  the  Consent  Decree.    The  court  did  not\nconsider whether the defendants had also violated the constitution.\nThe plaintiffs are correct in pointing out that United States\nv. Connecticut arose out of claims of constitutional violations\nthat are similar to the claims in this case.  However, “[u]se of\ncollateral  estoppel  ‘must  be  confined  to  situations  where  the\nmatter raised in the second suit is identical in all respects with\nthat decided in the first proceeding and where the controlling\nfacts and applicable legal rules remain unchanged.’”  Faulkner, 409\nF.3d  at  37  (quoting  Comm’r  v.  Sunnen,  333  U.S.  591,  599-600\n(1948)).  The United States v. Connecticut Consent Decree set out\nin considerable detail the obligations of the defendants.  The\nconsent  decree  included,  for  example,  an  obligation  to  ensure\nspecific staff-to-resident ratios.  See Consent Decree at 8-9, U.S.\nv.  Conn  (Dec.  12,  1986).)    The  terms  of  the  consent  decree,\ntherefore,  do  more  than  simply  restate  the  defendants’\nconstitutional obligations.  A court could find that the defendants\nin United States v. Connecticut had violated the terms of the\nConsent Decree even though they had not violated the constitution.\nThe  legal  and  factual  issues  determined  by  the  court  in  its\ncontempt finding are simply not identical to the issues in this\n13\n\ncase.\nTherefore, neither the Consent Decree in United States v.\nConnecticut nor the court’s finding of contempt based on violations\nof the Consent Decree preclude the defendants from arguing in this\ncase  that  they  have  fulfilled  their  obligations  under  the\nConstitution.\nIII. Conditions and Services at STS\nIn  their  Post-Trial  Brief,  the  plaintiffs  organize  their\nclaims  into  four  subject  areas.    They  claim  that  they  have\ndemonstrated at trial 1) that the defendants provided inadequate\nmedical care to class members; 2) that the defendants failed to\nprotect class members from physical harm; 3) that the defendants\nfailed to provide the plaintiffs with adequate habilitation and\n“active treatment”; and 4) that the defendants failed adequately to\nconsider community placement for class members.\nThe  relief  sought  by  the  plaintiffs  as  a  remedy  for  the\ndefendants’ alleged violations relating to the first three of these\nareas is somewhat limited.  The plaintiffs ask that deficiencies in\nthe  provision  of  medical  care,  protection  from  harm  and\nhabilitation  programming  be  referred  to  the  Special  Master’s\nremedial process in United States v. Connecticut.  (See Pls.’ Post-\nTrial Br. at 163-65, 167-68, 170-71.)  As described above, the\nSpecial  Master  in  United  States  v.  Connecticut  has  already\nconducted a thorough inquiry into conditions and services at STS\n14\n\nand,  along  with  the  Department  of  Justice,  has  overseen  STS’s\nefforts to remedy deficiencies in these three areas.  Much of what\nthe plaintiffs in this case seek from the Special Master’s remedial\nprocess has already been achieved . \nIn many instances, there will be no need for the court to\ndetermine whether or not the defendants are liable.  Insofar as the\nplaintiffs  here  have  committed  themselves  to  deferring  to  the\nSpecial Master and his remedial process for the resolution of any\nparticular constitutional violation, and the Special Master has\ndirectly addressed that issue, the court need not revisit that\nparticular violation.  As indicated in the following discussion,\nthe court declines to consider whether the defendants are, in fact,\nliable for almost all of the alleged violations relating to the\nprovision of medical care, protection of STS residents from harm\nand provision of adequate habilitation.  The court declines to\nconsider whether the defendants are liable under these claims not\nbecause the plaintiffs have failed to present sufficient evidence\nto prove constitutional or statutory violations in these areas but,\nrather, because these claims are moot since the plaintiffs have\nachieved everything for which they ask.  See Powell v. McCormack,\n395 U.S. 486, 495-96 (1969) (noting that a court should find as\nmoot claims in which the relief sought had already been obtained);\nMartin-Trigona v. Shiff, 702 F.2d 380, 386 (2d Cir. 1983) (“The\nhallmark of a moot case or controversy is that the relief sought\n15\n\ncan no longer be given or is no longer needed.”); County Motors,\nInc. v. General Motors Corp., 278 F.3d 40, 43 (1st Cir. 2002);\nBlanciak v. Allegheny Ludlum Corp., 77 F.3d 690, 698-99 (3d Cir.\n1996) (“If developments occur during the course of adjudication\nthat eliminate a plaintiff's personal stake in the outcome of a\nsuit or prevent a court from being able to grant the requested\nrelief, the case must be dismissed as moot.”) (citations omitted).\nA.   Medical Care\nThe plaintiffs point to evidence of numerous problems with the\nmedical care that was provided at STS prior to the trial.  (Pls.’\nPost-Trial Br. at 3-48; Pls.’ Proposed Findings at 69-194.)  The\nplaintiffs claim to have established at trial that in many cases,\nthe medical conditions of STS residents went completely untreated\nby STS staff, and that some residents’ medical conditions worsened\nas a result of the actions of STS doctors, nurses and physicians\nassistants.      They  claim  that  physicians  assistants  were  not\nproperly supervised and that there was insufficient oversight and\nreview regarding the administration of psychotropic medication.\nThey claim that medical professionals failed to properly take note\nof abnormal laboratory findings and failed to keep legible medical\nrecords.  They also claim that STS failed to adhere to proper\nstandards  regarding  the  writing  and  implementation  of  “do  not\nresuscitate” orders.\nTo remedy these alleged instances of deficient medical care,\n16\n\nthe plaintiffs ask the court to order the defendants to provide\n“adequate medical and nursing care to all class members.”  (Pls.’\nPost-Trial Br. at 164.)  More specifically, the plaintiffs “request\nthat  inadequacies  in  medical  care  be  referred  to  the  remedial\nmechanism in” United States v. Connecticut for “resolution provided\nplaintiffs can participate fully in the remedial process.”  (Id. at\n164-65.)  The plaintiffs ask the court to refer the following\nspecific issues to the Special Master:  \na. The  adequacy  of  nursing  services  provided  to  class\nmembers.\nb. The  development  of  a  process  to  remedy  cases  of\ninadequate nursing or medical care.\nc. The development of a system of oversight over physicians\nassistants such that the use of physicians assistants at\nSTS complies “at the very least” with Conn. Gen. Stat. §\n20-12d.\nd. The development of a system “to ensure that the ultimate\noversight of all aspects of medical care rest with the\ntreating  physician”  and  to  ensure  that  “laboratory\ntesting and overall medical condition of the class member\nwill be taken into account when psychotropic medications\nare administered.”\ne. The  need  for  a  requirement  that  physicians  should\nparticipate in the interdisciplinary team (“IDT”) process\n17\n\nso  that  the  use  of  psychotropic  medications  can  be\nadequately coordinated with other aspects of each class\nmembers’ overall plan of service.\nf. The need for a requirement that class members’ records\nshould  contain  an  explanation  of  why  psychotropic\nmedication  was  prescribed  as  well  as  a  “medication\nreduction plan.”\ng. The need for systematic review of the use of medications\nat  STS,  as  well  as  a  plan  to  reduce  the  use  of\nmedications.\nh. A  requirement  that  physicians  comment  on  abnormal\nlaboratory findings in a class member’s medical record.\ni. The establishment of a plan to improve the legibility of\nclass members’ medical records.\nj. The creation of “memoranda of understanding” with area\nhospitals addressing, among other issues, the use  of\nDNRs.\nk. A requirement that STS adhere to DMR 87-2, which is the\nregulation relating to the writing and implementation of\nDNRs.\nl. The implementation of nursing care that is “consistent\nwith the ICF/MR regulations.”\nm. The need to ensure that nurses and other direct care\nstaff receive adequate training so that they are able to\n18\n\nunderstand the health care needs of class members and are\nable to implement the class members’ “care plans[s].”  \nId. at 165-67.\nI. Medical Care Issues Addressed in United States v. Connecticut\nThe Remedial Plan implemented by the Special Master in United\nStates  v.  Connecticut  addressed  medical  care  at  STS  at  great\nlength.  More than 30 of the 95 Court Requirements in the Remedial\nPlan  directly  addressed  issues  of  medical  care  and  the\nadministration of medication.  In 2006, after a final expert report\ncommissioned by the Special Master showed sufficient improvements\nin medical care, he reported that STS was in compliance with all of\nthese Court Requirements, and the court released STS from judicial\noversight of all outstanding aspects of the Remedial Plan relating\nto medical services.  Order on Medical Services Compliance, U.S. v.\nConn.  (March  22,  2006);  see  also  Report  to  the  Court  No.  63:\nMedical Services, U.S. v. Conn. (Feb. 22, 2006).  During this\nprocess,  the  Special  Master  addressed  most  of  the  plaintiffs’\nspecific concerns listed above.   The Special Master addressed\noversight over medical staff, which is the issue raised in the\nplaintiffs’ specific concerns b. and d. from the above list.  The\nRemedial Plan set standards for medical care, nursing care, and\nspecialist  medical  care  (see  CR  60,  61,  63-65),  set  minimum\nacceptable  staffing  levels  and  ratios  of  supervisory  staff  to\ndirect  care  staff  (see  CR  13-32),  and  set  standards  for\n19\n\ncommunication between care-givers and other staff (see CR 34-40).\nThe  Special  Master  oversaw  the  implementation  of  a  “Quality\nAssurance” system designed to monitor the care received by STS\nresidents and to ensure that residents received an adequate level\nof care from all medical staff.  See Consultation and Review of\nMedical Services: Report to the Special Master, U.S. v. Conn. (Feb.\n17, 2006).  Because these aspects of the relief sought by the\nplaintiffs have been realized, the court sees no need to determine\nliability related to this issue.  The court will not address the\nissue of whether the defendants failed to provide for adequate\noversight over medical staff.  \nSimilarly,  oversight  over  the  administration  of  behavior\nmodifying medication by physicians assistants, the issue raised in\nspecific concern c. from the above list, was addressed in the\nRemedial  Plan  by  CR  66,  which  required  “that  only  personnel\nauthorized  by  state  law  shall  administer  medication.”    See\nQuarterly Report No. 5, U.S. v. Conn. (Dec. 2, 1998) (finding STS\nin compliance with CR 66). \nThe plaintiffs’ concern about the quality of nursing services\nat STS, expressed in specific concerns a. and l. in the above list,\nwas addressed by the Remedial Plan in CR 61, which set standards\nfor  nursing  care.    In  order  to  give  effect  to  these  Court\nRequirements, the Special Master and the parties in United States\nv.  Connecticut  developed  and  implemented  plans  to  correct\n20\n\ndeficiencies in the nursing services.  See Report to the Court No.\n42: Nursing, U.S. v. Conn.  (Aug. 23, 2002).\nThe Remedial Plan also addressed deficiencies in the training\nof  staff  at  STS,  an  issue  raised  by  the  plaintiffs’  specific\nconcern  m.  from  the  list  above.      See  CR  33  (requiring  the\nimplementation of a training plan); see also Report to the Court\nNo. 19: Staff Training, U.S. v. Conn. (Mar. 27, 2001) (noting the\nnew kinds of staff training added at STS and recommending release\nfrom judicial oversight for CR 33).\nThe administration of behavior-modifying medication at STS, an\nissue raised by the plaintiffs’ specific concerns d., e., f. and g.\nfrom the list above, received considerable attention in United\nStates v. Connecticut.  See, e.g., 931 F. Supp. at 979-80 (noting\nthe “[problematic] implications of unqualified (e.g., unlicensed)\npersonnel,  in  effect,  making  major  decisions  regarding\npharmacological  interventions”)  (quoting  the  report  of  Dr.\nVolkmar).  The Remedial Plan set forth several Court Requirements\nintended to remedy deficiencies in the manner in which medication\nwas administered.  The Remedial Plan established procedures for\napproving  the  use  of  medication  (see  CR  53)  and  procedures\nrequiring  physicians  to  systematically  review  the  need  for\nbehavior-modifying medication in individual cases (see CR 54).  The\nRemedial Plan subjected “polypharmacy” to additional scrutiny.  See\nCR 55.  The Remedial Plan set standards for evaluation of STS\n21\n\nresidents who received narcoleptic drugs and required that these\nindividuals be screened for tardive dyskinesia.  See CR 56-57.  The\nRemedial Plan required that each resident’s primary care physician,\nas well as all appropriate medical records, be made available to\nthe Program Review Committee, which is responsible for approving\nIDT decisions about each resident’s care and medication.  See CR\n58-59.  In accordance with the Remedial Plan, the Special Master\ndevoted  considerable  effort  to  correcting  deficiencies  in  the\nmanner in which behavior-modifying medications were administered at\nSTS.  See, e.g., Report to the Court No. 28: Compliance Review:\nCourt Requirement 57, EC 3, U.S. v. Conn. (Sept. 11, 2001); Report\nto the Court No. 33: Court Requirement 54 and 56, U.S. v. Conn.\n(Jan. 15, 2002).  The Special Master thus addressed all of the\nplaintiffs’ concerns related to the administration of behavior-\nmodifying medication, and the court will not consider liability on\nthis issue. \nThe United States v. Connecticut litigation also addressed\nSTS’ record-keeping procedures.  See 931 F. Supp. at 981 (finding\nthat, as of the contempt hearing, “STS’s recordkeeping procedures\n[were]  .  .  .  below  professional  standards,  causing  important\nmedical information to be obscured, and jeopardizing its residents’\nhealth”).  Several of the Court Requirements in the Remedial Plan\nspecifically addressed record-keeping procedures (see CR 79-85),\nthus addressing the plaintiffs’ specific concerns h. and i.  Prior\n22\n\nto STS’s release from judicial oversight for these requirements,\nthe Special Master’s consultant reported that records at STS are\nnow  mostly  typed,  rather  than  handwritten  and  that  STS  has\nimplemented “problem lists” to track individuals’ ongoing medical\nissues.  See Consultation and Review of Medical Services: Report to\nthe Special Master at 24-27, U.S. v. Conn. (Feb. 17, 2006). \nii. DNR and DNI Orders  \nThe plaintiffs’ specific concerns j. and k. relate to the use\nof Do Not Resuscitate (“DNR”) orders at STS.  Unlike the other\nitems in the above list, Special Master Ferleger did not address\nthis issue in United States v. Connecticut.\nIn  asserting  their  claims  that  DNR  orders  were  written\nimproperly, the plaintiffs rely on the district court’s opinion in\nConnecticut Ass’n for Retarded Citizens v. Thorne, Civ. A. No. H-\n78-653, 1993 WL 765698 (D. Conn. Feb. 12, 1993), rev’d on other\ngrounds,  30  F.3d  367  (2d.  Cir.  1994),  which  held  that  when  a\ndecision  to  withhold  potentially  lifesaving  treatment  from  an\nincompetent patient is made by a guardian appointed by the state,\ndue process requires adherence to procedural safeguards to ensure\nthat “the decision would reflect the wishes of the patient.”  The\ncourt in Thorne found that implementation of the procedures set\nforth in DMR directive 87-2 would satisfy due process.  Id. at *11.\nThe plaintiffs argue that the defendants in this case have violated\n23\n\ndue process by failing to implement DMR 87-2.7  (Pls.’ Post-Trial\nBr. at 21-29.)     \nA  DNR  order  allows  medical  professionals  to  withhold\ncardiopulmonary  resuscitation  (“CPR”)  from  a  patient  who  is\nundergoing cardiac or respiratory arrest.  DMR 87-2 allows a DNR\norder to be written only with the consent of a patient or, if the\npatient is not competent, with the consent of a “surrogate,” who\nmay be a guardian, conservator, next of kin, or close relative.\n(Pls.’ Ex. 509.)  DMR and its personnel cannot consent to a DNR\norder on behalf of STS residents.  Rather, DMR’s role is to ensure\nthat any DNR order is “medically acceptable.”  (Id.)  Under DMR 87-\n2, after an attending physician has obtained consent, he or she may\nwrite a DNR order for a patient who is in a “terminal condition,”\na state defined as “the final stage of an incurable or irreversible\nmedical  condition  which,  without  the  administration  of  a  life\nsupport system, will result in death within a relatively short time\nperiod, in the opinion of the attending physician.”  (Id. (quoting\n7The problem addressed by the district court in Thorne was\nthat DNR orders where written by DMR doctors and residents’\nguardians “without adherence to any mechanism or uniform\nprocedural safeguards to determine whether the decisions comply\nwith the wishes of the patients.”  Id. at *9 (emphasis added). \nThe court notes that the plaintiffs have not argued that the\ndefendant failed to follow any procedure.  Even if the plaintiffs\nwere able to establish that the defendants violated DMR-87, this\nfact alone would not require a finding that the defendants\nviolated due process.  In order to prevail on these claims, the\nplaintiffs would need to show either a complete absence of any\nprocedure for writing DNR orders or that whatever procedures were\nimplemented did not satisfy due process.    \n24\n\nConn. Gen. Stat. § 19a-570(11).)  If the patient is expected to die\n“during the next several days or weeks,” the signature of the\nattending physician is sufficient to create a valid DNR order.\n(Id.)  When the attending physician cannot make a prediction that\nthe patient will die within this time frame, a DNR may be written\nfor a patient who is nonetheless in the final stage of a terminal\ncondition, but such a DNR order is subject to certain additional\nprocedural safeguards, which include notifying the DMR Commissioner\nand the Attorney General.  (Id.)\nDMR  policy  does  not  impose  any  additional  procedural\nsafeguards for the writing of a “do not intubate” (“DNI”) order,\nwhich allows medical professionals to withhold additional forms of\ntreatment  designed  to  assist  patients  undergoing  respiratory\narrest.  (Tr. 6/30/99 at 206 (McDonald).)  A DNI order may be\nwritten only for residents who have valid DNR orders.  (Id.)\n1. Allegations  that  DNR  Orders  Were  Written  for  Non-\nTerminally Ill Class Members\nThe  plaintiffs  first  claim  to  have  established  that  STS\npersonnel violated the DMR’s procedures by writing DNR orders for\nclass members for whom death was not imminent.  In support of this\nclaim, the plaintiffs cite cases in which a DNR order was written\nfor a patient a substantial amount of time before the patient\nactually died.  For example, class member Gloria DeBartholomew had\na DNR order in her file for six years before she died (Pls.’ Ex.\n301), and Agnes Vernik had a DNR order in her file for two years\n25\n\nbefore she died (Pls.’ Ex. 282).  The plaintiffs cannot meet their\nburden  with  this  kind  of  evidence.    The  mere  passage  of  time\nbetween the writing of a DNR and the patient’s subsequent death\ndoes not establish that the attending physicians signed a DNR at a\ntime when he or  she could not have said that the patient was\nexpected to die within days or weeks.  \nInsofar as the plaintiffs  have presented expert testimony\nstating that DNR orders were written for patients who were not in\nthe final stages of a terminal condition, this testimony is no more\npersuasive.  The opinion of expert witness Dr. Robert Kugel that\nclass member Eleanor Fuchs had a DNR in her file even though she\nwas not terminally ill is also based merely on the passage of time\nbetween the writing of the DNR and her death two years later; this\nopinion does not seem to be based on an analysis of Ms. Fuchs’\nmedical condition.8  (See Tr. 3/22/99 at 132.)  Similarly, Dr.\nKugel’s testimony that class member Oscar Hansen’s DNR order was\nwritten at a time when “it would have seemed to me that he was not\n8Further raising the Court’s suspicion about Dr. Kugel’s\ntestimony is the fact that Dr. Kugel’s report, as opposed to his\ntrial testimony, does not mention his opinion that Ms. Fuchs\ncould not have been in a terminal condition when the DNR order\nwas written.  (See Pls.’ Ex. 423G at 30.)  Furthermore, this\nconclusion is contradicted by the DNR order itself, which states\nthat Ms. Fuchs was thought to have a 50% chance of mortality\nwithin one year.  (Pls. Ex. 613.)   While this seems to establish\nthat the attending physician did not believe that the patient\nwould die within days or weeks, it does establish that the\nphysician had determined that Ms. Fuchs was in a terminal\ncondition.\n26\n\nin imminent danger of dying” (Tr. 3/22/99 at 117) is vague and\nunsupported by reasoning or reference to facts.  Furthermore, Mr.\nHansen’s  DNR  order  was  signed  in  1992,  before  the  DMR  had\nimplemented changes in the protocol for DNR orders following the\ndecision in Thorne.  (See Pls.’ Ex. 509.)\nFurthermore, the plaintiffs have not established that it would\nbe a violation of due process for a state doctor to sign a DNR\norder for a patient who is in a terminal condition but who is\npredicted to die within months or years rather than days or weeks.\nOn the contrary, DMR 87-2, a directive of which the plaintiffs seem\nto approve, explicitly provides for DNRs to be written under such\ncircumstances, as long as certain officials are notified.  Nowhere\nhave the plaintiffs argued that failure to take these additional\nsteps  transforms  an  otherwise  valid  DNR  into  a  due  process\nviolation.  The court is unwilling to draw this legal conclusion.\nThe court is therefore not persuaded by the plaintiffs’ claim that\nthe defendants violated due process when an STS doctor recommended\na DNR order for class member Robert Fusco, who was in the “end-\nstage of a progressive and irreversible condition” and was expected\nto live for “months to years” with a feeding gastronomy tube.9\n9Moreover, the plaintiffs have not established the\nadditional procedural safeguards required by DMR 87-2 were not\nfollowed in Mr. Fusco’s case.  The exhibit they cite (see Pls.’\nProposed Findings at 88-89) is merely a letter recommending a DNR\norder (Pls.’ Ex. 615); it does not contain any of the\ndocumentation that would accompany a complete DNR order, and it\ndoes not establish that such documentation never existed.\n27\n\n(See Pls.’ Ex. 615.)\nThe other cases cited by the plaintiffs as evidence that the\ndefendants wrote DNR orders for non-terminally ill patients are\nalso unhelpful.   The plaintiffs’ reference to the case of Sandra\nZukowski is odd in this context given that no DNR order was written\nprior to her death, apparently because her family did not consent.\n(Pls.’ Ex. 300.)  Dr. Kugel’s testimony that an STS attending\nphysician’s decision to recommend a DNR order for Elsie Backus was\nunjustified (see Tr. 3/22/99 at 134-35) is flatly contradicted by\nthe consultation report of a speciality clinic that recommended a\nDNR  “in  view  of  advanced  cancer”  (Pls.’  Ex.  291).    Dr.  Kugel\ntestified that his opinion was based on the facts that Ms. Backus\nwas “in good spirits” and “ambulating” when the DNR order was\nsigned.    (Tr.  3/22/99  at  135.)    This  explanation  calls  into\nquestion Dr. Kugel’s helpfulness to the court as an expert witness.\nSimilarly, Kugel’s testimony that Thomas Jasinski remained under a\nDNR order even though he ceased be in a terminal state seems to\nhave no basis in fact.  (See Tr. 3/22/99 at 125.)  There is no\nevidence that Mr. Jasinski ceased to be in a terminal state at any\npoint after the DNR order was signed.  The plaintiffs themselves\nmoved into evidence a chart showing that STS staff reviewed the DNR\norder multiple times in 1996.10  (Pls.’ Ex. 619.) \n10The court also notes that Dr. Kugel’s testimony about Mr.\nJasinski’s DNR order is very different from the relevant passage\nin Kugel’s report, which only says that there was “no clear\n28\n\n2.  Alleged Improper Use of DNR Orders to Withhold Treatment\nFrom Class Members Suffering From Cardiac or Respiratory\nArrest Resulting from Accidents\nThe plaintiffs’ second claim relating to DNR orders is that\nthe  defendants  relied  on  these  orders  to  justify  withholding\ntreatment in situations not covered by the DNR protocol.  Under DMR\n87-2 medical professionals may withhold CPR pursuant to a DNR order\nonly  “after  respiration  and  cardiac  function  have  ceased\nspontaneously, as a natural progression of the dying process.”\n(Pls.’ Ex. 509.)  However, a DNR order does not allow medical\nprofessionals to withhold CPR from an STS resident who “aspirates\nfood or fluid, or has any other accident that may result in death\nif  left  unattended.”  (Id.)    The  plaintiffs  claim  that  the\ndefendants have, in violation of DMR 87-2, implemented policies\nunder which CPR is withheld from class members with DNR orders who\nexperience respiratory and cardiac arrest as a result of accidents\nor other causes that are not the “natural progression of the dying\nprocess.” \nThe plaintiffs contend that direct care staff and nurses, who\nmust often make decisions about whether to perform CPR on class\ndocumentation of [Mr. Jasinki’s DNR] status” and fails to mention\nthat Mr. Jasinski was no longer in a terminal state when he died. \n(Pls.’ Ex. 423G at 23.)  The court does not believe that Dr.\nKugel, who reviewed 70 cases in preparing his report, left this\ndetail out of his report but remembered it on the witness stand. \nRather, this incident suggests that Dr. Kugel, while testifying,\nwas somewhat too enthusiastic in offering opinions that supported\nthe plaintiffs’ case.\n29\n\nmembers discovered in respiratory distress, are directed by STS\npolicy to withheld CPR from every resident with a DNR bracelet\nwithout considering the cause of the resident’s distress.  (Pls.’\nPost-Trial Br. 23-24.))  If proved, the existence of this policy\nwould be problematic since it would mean that there is confusion\nabout what class members and their guardians had actually consented\nto when they requested DNR orders.  It would be improper for STS to\nobtain consent from a resident to withhold CPR should the resident\nundergo respiratory distress as a result of the natural progress of\nhis or her terminal condition and then to use this consent to\njustify withholding lifesaving treatment in other situations. \nThe plaintiffs claim that STS has implemented a rule that\nrequires staff to withhold CPR from any class member wearing a DNR\nbracelet, regardless of the cause of the cardiac or respiratory\ndistress.  However, this claim was contradicted by STS Medical\nDirector Dr. Robert McDonald, who unequivocally denied that there\nwas any such rule and explained that staff are required to perform\nCPR  on  every  resident  who  is  discovered  to  have  choked  on\nsomething, even if the resident has a DNR bracelet.11  (Tr. 6/30/99\n11The plaintiffs misconstrue the testimony of Dr. McDonald\nand cite it in support of their claim.  (See Pls.’ Proposed\nFindings at 92.)  Dr. McDonald’s testimony seems to suggest that\nin cases where a resident with a DNR bracelet is found in cardiac\nor respiratory arrest and there is no sign of choking or any\nother accident, and no indication of the cause of the distress,\ndirect care staff are instructed not to perform CPR, though they\nare required to call for emergency medical assistance.  (See Tr.\n6/30/99 at 161-62.)  The testimony on this point is somewhat\n30\n\nat 161-62.)\nThe  plaintiffs  have  not  persuaded  the  court  that  Dr.\nMcDonald’s  statement  of  STS  policy  is  inaccurate.    Kugel,  the\nplaintiffs’ expert, testified somewhat uncertainly that he did not\n“think” that direct care staff can distinguish between respiratory\narrest caused by accidents and respiratory arrest resulting from\nthe patient’s terminal condition.  (Tr. 4/5/99 at 46.)  He also\ntestified that he did not know whether nurses at STS have the\nnecessary training to make this distinction.  (Id. at 47.)  Without\nclaiming any direct knowledge, he testified that the policy at STS\n“seems  to  say”  that  direct  care  staff  and  nurses  at  STS  are\ndirected not to perform CPR on any resident with a DNR bracelet who\nis undergoing respiratory or cardiac arrest, regardless of whether\nthe direct care staff involved are able to discern the cause of the\nemergency.    (Id.)    Kugel’s  inability  to  be  more  definite  in\ndescribing  the  training  of  STS  staff  and  the  policy  they  are\ndirected to follow makes it impossible for the court to attach much\nweight to his opinion. \nThe plaintiffs also cite the testimony of Nicholas Gabriel,\nthe fire chief at STS, who testified at his deposition that staff\nmuddled and therefore inconclusive.  In any event, the issue of\nwhat direct care staff should do upon discovering a resident in a\nstate of respiratory distress of which the cause is unknown and\nunknowable seems to be a difficult one.  The parties have not\naddressed this question, and the court is not prepared to find\nthat the practice described by Dr. McDonald violates due process.\n31\n\nare instructed to withhold CPR from residents wearing DNR bracelets\nwho are discovered in either cardiopulmonary or respiratory arrest\n“no matter what the cause.”  (Tr. 3/31/99 at 196.)  While this\ntestimony  supports  the  plaintiffs’  claims,  it  is  somewhat\ninconclusive since it was quoted from Gabriel’s deposition and\nlacks  context.    It  is  completely  unclear  whether  Gabriel  was\nconsidering the possibility that staff would have to make decisions\nabout whether to perform CPR on class members who are undergoing\nrespiratory arrest as a result of, for example, a choking accident.\nThe court therefore finds that Dr. McDonald’s unequivocal statement\nof STS policy is more convincing.\n3.  Alleged Practice of Withholding Treatment Other Than\nCPR On the Basis of DNR Orders\nThe plaintiffs also claim that the defendants have relied on\nDNR  orders  to  withhold  treatment  other  than  CPR.    Because  an\nindividual’s  consent  to  a  DNR  order  encompasses  only  the\nwithholding of CPR, and not the withholding of other kinds of\nmedical treatment (see Pls.’ Ex. 509), the court agrees with the\nplaintiffs that a policy of withholding treatment other than CPR\nwould indeed violate class members’ due process rights. \nHowever, this claim is not supported by the evidence.  The\nplaintiffs rely, in large part, on misconstruing the testimony of\nDr. McDonald.  For example, McDonald did not, as the plaintiffs\nclaim, testify that a DNR order may be used to justify denying\nintubation to class members.  (See Pls.’ Proposed Findings at 89.)\n32\n\nDr. McDonald denied this claim.  (See Tr. 6/30/99 at 198 (“A DNR\norder and intubation are two different things.”))  The plaintiffs\nalso interpret one portion of McDonald’s testimony to mean that\nmeasures other than CPR, including transfer to a hospital, may be\nwithheld on the basis of a DNR order.  (See Pls.’ Proposed Findings\nat 90-91.)  As the court understands his testimony, Dr. McDonald\nsimply  stated  that  treating  professionals  may  exercise  their\nprofessional judgment to withhold treatment that would not benefit\na patient who has a DNR order.  (Tr. 6/30/99 at 208-9.)  Dr.\nMcDonald explained that this is exactly the kind of “weigh[ing of]\nrisks and benefits” that a medical professional must conduct before\nmaking any treatment decision about any patient, regardless of the\npresence of a DNR order.  (See Tr. 7/8/99 at 57-58.)  \nThere is no evidence to support the plaintiffs’ claims that\nparticular class members died after treatment other than CPR was\nwithheld.  The plaintiffs claim that class member Karen Peterson\ndied after nutrition and fluids were withheld on the basis of a DNR\norder.  (Pls.’ Proposed Findings at 95.)  However, Ms. Peterson’s\nmortality review indicates that the decision to withhold fluid and\nnutrition was made by her guardian and that this decision, not the\nDNR order, was the basis for the action.  (Pls.’ Ex. 273.)  The\nplaintiffs’ evidence regarding the 1993 death of class member Mark\nRoy  is  inconclusive.    Dr.  Kugel  stated  that  the  decision  to\nwithhold a bronchoscopy was based on a DNR order in Roy’s file.\n33\n\n(Pls. Ex. 432G  at 15; Tr. 3/22/99 at 114-15.)  Kugel did not\nexplain how he knows that the DNR order was the basis for the\ndecision, and the court is unaware of any evidence supporting this\nclaim.  Furthermore, it appears that the decision not to perform\nthe bronchoscopy was made by Waterbury Hospital personnel rather\nthan the defendants.  (Id.)  Similarly, the decision to remove an\nintubation tube from Janice Doyle prior to her death in 1993 was\nmade by Waterbury Hospital, not STS.  (Pls.’ Ex. 267.)\nThe plaintiffs also claim that DNR orders were used to justify\n“weaning class members from a ventilator.”  (See Pls.’ Proposed\nFindings  at  89.)    However,  the  mortality  review  cited  by  the\nplaintiffs in support of this claim does not demonstrate that any\nsuch decision was made.  (See Pls.’ Ex. 272.)\n4. Alleged  Failures  to  Ensure  that  Community  Hospitals\nFollow DNR Protocol\nThe plaintiffs also claim that the defendants have violated\nclass members’ due process rights by failing to address situations\nin which area community hospitals have written DNR orders for STS\nresidents without following DMR protocol.  (Pls.’ Post-Trial Br. at\n26.)  Most of the incidents to which the plaintiffs have drawn the\nCourt’s attention occurred in 1994 or shortly before.  During this\nperiod,  DNR  and  DNI  orders  were  apparently  written  for  class\nmembers at community hospitals without notifying STS or involving\nSTS in the process.  (Pls.’ Exs. 260, 262, 621, 631.)  The findings\nof  the  Mortality  Review  Committee  indicate  that  some  of  these\n34\n\norders were written for patients whose medical conditions were not\nirreversible and thus the DNR orders do not comply with DMR 87-2.\n(Pls.’ Exs.267, 324, 629.)\nDr. McDonald conceded that there had been problems with DNR\norders written for class members at community hospitals in the\npast,  but  he  testified  that  STS  had  worked  to  resolve  these\nproblems following his appointment as Medical Director in 1996.\n(Tr. 6/30/99 at 156-58; Tr. 7/8/99 at 25-27.)  He testified that\ncommunity hospitals are required to comply with STS policies when\nwriting DNR orders for STS residents, and he described how STS\ntakes  action  whenever  it  learns  that  a  community  hospital  has\nfailed to follow these policies.  (Tr. 6/30/99 at 157-58, 163-68.)\nDr. McDonald also conceded that there have been some problems with\ncommunity hospitals in this regard since 1996.  (Tr. 6/30/99 at\n164.)  The plaintiffs claim, however, that the defendants have not\ndone enough to resolve these problems and point to instances after\n1996  in  which  community  hospitals  apparently  wrote  DNR  orders\nwithout following DMR protocol. \nThe evidence supports Dr. McDonald’s testimony that STS has\ntaken  adequate  precautions  to  ensure  that  community  hospitals\ncomply with DNR protocols.  The Mortality Review for STS resident\nJose Masso (Pls.’ Ex. 281) indicates that the DNR order written by\nDanbury  Hospital  in  1996  was  poorly  documented  and  was  not\nprocessed through DMR.  Dr. McDonald agreed that the hospital had\n35\n\nfailed to follow STS and DMR policy in this instance, and explained\nthat he had addressed the issue with Danbury Hospital personnel.\n(Tr. 7/8/99 at 30; Pls.’ Ex. 281.)  Similarly, in 1997, after\nWaterbury Hospital wrote a DNR for STS resident Dorothy Goldson\nwithout STS involvement, STS responded by reminding the hospital of\nthe need to involve STS personnel when writing DNR orders for STS\nresidents.  (Pls.’ Ex. 295.)  McDonald addressed this issue again\nwith Waterbury Hospital following the 1998 death of John Cherubino,\nwhose DNR and DNI orders were written without STS involvement.\n(Pls.’ Ex. 302; Tr. 7/8/99 at 60-61.)\nThe  plaintiffs  have  not  established  that  the  defendants’\nefforts to force community hospitals to follow DMR protocol have\nbeen constitutionally deficient.  The defendants are not liable for\nthe actions of community hospitals.  Of course, insofar as the\ndefendants are aware that community hospitals frequently fail to\nfollow  proper  DNR  procedures,  they  should  work  to  resolve  the\nproblem.    Dr.  McDonald  described  how  he  informed  community\nhospitals that they must conform to DMR policies, how he consulted\nwith  the  Attorney  General  about  the  situation,  and  how  the\ncommunity hospitals are “subject to a citation” should they fail to\ncooperate with STS.  (Tr. 6/30/99 at 166.)  Furthermore, as an\nadditional safeguard, all non-STS DNR orders are reviewed upon a\nclass member’s discharge from a community hospital back to STS.\n(Tr. 7/8/99 at 61 (McDonald).)  The court declines to find that the\n36\n\ndefendants’  efforts  in  this  regard  deviate  from  professional\nstandards.  \nThe  plaintiffs  argue  that  the  defendants  must  establish\nwritten “memoranda of understanding” with community hospitals that\nguarantee that the hospitals follow DMR procedure.  (Pls.’ Post-\nTrial Br. at 28-29.)  However, the plaintiffs have not drawn to the\nCourt’s attention any evidence – expert or otherwise – establishing\nthat such memoranda are required by professional standards.12\n5. Other Claims Regarding DNR Orders \nThe  plaintiffs  also  claim  that  “there  is  no  process”  for\nwriting  DNI  orders  at  STS.    (Pls.’  Proposed  Findings  at  89.)\nHowever, the plaintiffs support their claim by mischaracterizing\nDr. McDonald’s testimony.  (See Pls.’ Proposed Findings at 89.)\nThe testimony cited by the plaintiffs related to the fact that DMR\nprotocol allows DNI orders to be written without any procedural\nsafeguards beyond those required under DMR 87-2 for DNR orders.\n(See Tr. 6/30/99 at 201.)  Because a DNI order may only be written\nfor a patient who has a valid DNR order, it is simply not true that\na DNI order may be written without following any procedure.  The\n12The plaintiffs quote, without citation, the “interpretive\nguidelines” for 42 U.S.C. § 483.460(a)(3), which, according to\nthe plaintiffs, state that ICF/MRs must establish written\nagreements with outside providers of medical services.  (Pls.’\nPost-Trial Br. at 28.)  The court is unable to locate any\ndocument containing this quotation.  In any event, the quotation\nis unhelpful since guidelines issued to interpret ICF/MR\nregulations do not establish constitutional norms.  \n37\n\nplaintiffs  have  not  argued  that  the  constitution  requires\nadditional procedural safeguards in order for a DNI order to be\nwritten.\nThe plaintiffs also claim that the defendants improperly allow\nphysicians assistants and nurses to sign reviews of DNR orders.\n(Pls.’ Proposed Findings at 103.)  The plaintiffs only evidence for\nthis claim is a passage of Dr. McDonald’s cross-examination in\nwhich plaintiffs’ counsel aggressively but unsuccessfully tried to\nforce the witness to admit that there was a deficiency in this\nregard.  (Tr. 7/9/99 at 81-85.)  Dr. McDonald explained clearly\nthat there was “no problem” because the staff who sign DNR reviews\ndo so under the supervision of doctors.  (Id.)  He testified that\nany previous problems in this area had been corrected.  (Id.)\nThe court therefore finds that the plaintiffs have failed to\nestablish that the defendants’ policies and practices for  writing\nDNR and DNI orders for class members violate due process.\nB.   Protection From Harm and Freedom From Unnecessary Restraint\nThe plaintiffs claim that the defendants have violated their\nconstitutional duty to protect residents at STS from abuse, neglect\nand  injury.    (Pls.’  Post-Trial  Br.  at  48-67.)    As  with  the\nplaintiffs’ claims relating to the provision of medical care, the\nplaintiffs set out a list in their Post-Trial Brief of specific\nmatters for which they request a remedy.  The plaintiffs state that\nthey do not know if the Special Master has addressed all of these\n38\n\nmatters and suggest that “that the appropriate course is to request\norders to remedy the violations plaintiffs established at trial,\nand to ask that they be referred to the process established in\n[United States v. Connecticut] provided plaintiffs can participate\nfully in the process.”  (Id. at 168).   The plaintiffs would have\nthe following specific orders implemented by the Special Master:\na. An order requiring the defendants to provide physical\nsafety, freedom from restraint and programming that is\nsufficient to satisfy the requirements of Youngberg.\nb. An order requiring the defendants to investigate abuse,\nneglect and injuries to class members and that STS unit\nstaff members should be prohibited from investigating\ninjuries of unknown origin.\nc. An order requiring adequate reporting, investigation and\ncorrective action in response to all abuse, neglect and\ninjuries.\nd. An order requiring the defendants to “take all reasonable\nsteps” to prevent resident-to-resident sexual assaults.\ne. An order requiring the defendants “to take all reasonable\nand  necessary  steps”  to  prevent  resident-to-resident\nassaults. \nf. An  order  requiring  the  defendants  to  provide  prompt\nmedical care to class members who have been injured or\nabused.\n39\n\ng. An  order  requiring  the  defendants  to  maintain  data\nregarding  injuries,  abuse,  neglect,  and  the  use  of\nrestraints at STS.\nh. An order requiring the defendants to use this data in\ntaking corrective action.\ni. An order requiring adequate staffing of the STS Human\nRights Office.\nj. An  order requiring the  defendants to take reasonable\nsteps to reduce the use of restraints at STS.\nk. An order requiring that buildings at STS be inspected and\nbrought into compliance with the state Fire Code.\n(Id. at 168-70.)\nThe issue of abuse and neglect at STS was an important aspect\nof the litigation in United States v. Connecticut.  See, e.g., 931\nF. Supp. at 978 (finding that “STS [had] not only failed to protect\nits residents from injury to themselves, but [had] also failed to\nprotect its residents from unreasonable risk of injury by other\nresidents”).  The Special Master accordingly devoted considerable\nattention  to  abuse  and  neglect  at  STS.    Eleven  of  the  Court\nRequirements in the Remedial Plan dealt with this issue.  See CR 2-\n12.\nThe  Remedial  Plan  focused  on  establishing  procedures  to\ninvestigate and respond to instances of abuse and neglect.  Court\nRequirement  4  required  that  STS  implement  procedures  for\n40\n\nsystematically recording and tracking instances of abuse, neglect\nand injuries and required STS to take corrective action based on\nthe data generated from these reports.  See Special Master’s Report\nto the Court No. 49: Investigation of Abuse/Neglect Allegations\n(“Report No. 49”) at 9-10, U.S. v. Conn. (May 27, 2003) (describing\nuse of the Connecticut Automated Mental Retardation Information\nSystem (“CAMRIS”) to track reports of abuse).  The Remedial Plan\nrequired  that  STS  set  standards  and  establish  procedures  for\nreporting  and  investigating  abuse  committed  both  by  staff  and\nresidents at STS.  See CR 6-11; see also Report No. 49 at 2-8\n(describing  the  emergence of a “professional,” “effective” and\nadequately resourced Human Rights Office tasked with investigating\nabuse at STS).  Therefore, the Special Master has addressed the\nplaintiffs’ specific concerns a., b., c., f., g., h. and i. \nIn addition to requiring STS to investigate and respond to\nabuse and neglect, the Remedial Plan required STS to take steps to\nprevent abuse and neglect.  Court Requirement 3 required STS to\nidentify  potential  victims  and  abusers,  implement  programs  to\nprevent victimization, and train staff and clients to recognize and\nreport abuse and neglect.  See, e.g., Report to the Court No. 54:\nAbuse/Neglect  Client  Training,  U.S.  v.  Conn.  (Jan.  20,  2004).\nTherefore,  the  Special  Master  has  addressed  the  plaintiffs’\nspecific concerns d. and e. \nThe specific order k. from the above list of the plaintiffs’\n41\n\nrequests relates to an issue – fire code compliance – that has\nalready been addressed in the United States v. Connecticut remedial\nprocess.  See CR 86, 87; see also Special Master’s Report to the\nCourt No. 59: Deletion of Several Requirements at 6-7, U.S. v.\nConn. (Oct. 24, 2005) (noting that fire marshal inspections and\nICF/MR inspections had been satisfactory).\nLastly, the Special Master has already addressed the issue of\nreducing unnecessary use of restraints on class members.  See,\ne.g., CR 48, EC 1-6 (prohibiting use of restraints in lieu of\ntraining and requiring systematic review of use of restraints).\nAlso,  as  discussed  below,  the  Special  Master  oversaw  the\nimprovement of habilitation programming, thus reducing the need to\nuse physical restraint.  It is therefore apparent that the Special\nMaster has already addressed the issue raised by the plaintiffs’\nspecific concerns a. and j.\nThe Special Master has already addressed all of the security\nand freedom from restraint issues that the plaintiffs would have\nthe court refer to him.  The court therefore will not consider\nwhether the defendants are liable for having failed to protect\nclass members from harm and unnecessary restraint.\nC.   Habilitation and Active Treatment\nThe plaintiffs claim that the defendants have violated class\nmembers’ due process rights to minimally adequate habilitation and\ntraining and they claim that the defendant Commissioner of DMR\n42\n\nviolated  class  members’  right  to  receive  active  treatment  as\nrequired by Title XIX of the Social Security Act.  (Pls.’ Post-\nTrial Br. at 67-69.)   Class members have a due process right to\ntraining or habilitation that is adequate to “ensure [their] safety\nand to facilitate [their] ability to function free from bodily\nrestraints.”  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 324.  Such training must be\n“sufficient to prevent basic self-care skills from deteriorating.”\nSociety for Good Will, 737 F.2d at 1250.  State officials violate\ndue process when they “fail to exercise professional judgment in\ndevising  programs  that  allow  patients  to  live  as  humanely  and\ndecently as when they entered the school.”  Id.  Class members do\nnot,  however,  have  a  due  process  right  to  training  that  will\n“improve [their] . . . skills beyond those with which they entered”\nSTS.  See Society for Good Will, 737 F.2d at 1250 (adopting Justice\nBlackmun’s concurring opinion in Youngberg).  \n“Active treatment,” as the term is used in Title XIX, refers\nto a level of training and treatment that is more intensive than\nthat  required  by  due  process.    The  regulations  promulgated  to\nimplement Title XIX explain that\n[e]ach client must receive a continuous active treatment\nprogram,  which  includes  aggressive,  consistent\nimplementation of a program of specialized and generic\ntraining, treatment, health services and related services\ndescribed in this subpart, that is directed toward . . .\n[t]he acquisition of the behaviors necessary for  the\nclient to function with as much self determination and\nindependence as possible [as well as] [t]he prevention or\ndeceleration of regression or loss of current optimal\nfunctional status.\n43\n\n42 C.F.R. § 483.440(a) (emphasis added).  Under Title XIX, unlike\nthe Due Process Clause, the class members enjoy a right to training\nand other treatment designed to do more than simply preserve basic\nskills. \nWhen they submitted their Post-Trial Brief, the plaintiffs\nwere aware that the Special Master in United States v. Connecticut\nhad  addressed  or  would  be  addressing  many  of  the  alleged\ndeficiencies in STS’s habilitation programming.  (Id. at 170.)\nHowever, because they were “uncertain as to the extent” that these\nalleged violations would be addressed in the remedial process in\nthat case, they have also requested a number of specific remedial\norders in this case.  (Id. at 170-71.)  The court construes this\nrequest for relief as a request that the court remedy any specific\nissues related to habilitation which the Special Master failed to\naddress.\nThe plaintiffs request the following specific remedial orders\nto fill any gaps that may have been left in the Special Master’s\noversight over reform of the habilitation services at STS:\na. An order requiring the defendants to provide each class\nmember with “minimally adequate habilitation” that is to\nbe monitored by a mental health professional.\nb. An  order  requiring  the  defendants  to  provide  class\nmembers  with  the  level  of  habilitation  that  a\nprofessional would consider adequate to ensure safety and\n44\n\nto allow freedom from restraint.\nc. An order prohibiting STS from administering unnecessary\nmedication and restraint and requiring the defendants to\nprovide habilitation to reduce the need for medication\nand restraint.\nd. An  order  requiring  the  defendants  to  “ensure  full\nparticipation in social, religious, and community group\nactivities.”\ne. An  order  requiring  the  defendants  to  “promote  the\nparticipation of legal guardians . . . in the process of\nproviding active treatment.”\nf. An order requiring the defendants to promote informal\nleave, vacations, and trips away from STS.\ng. An order requiring the defendants to provide each class\nmember with “an active treatment program consistent with\nhis/her needs.”\nh. An  order  requiring  “professional  program  staff”  to\nparticipate  in  IDT  meetings  relating  to  habilitation\nprogramming.\ni. An order requiring the defendants to provide sufficient,\nadequately  trained  staff  to  implement  habilitation\nprograms.\nj. An  order  requiring  the  defendants  to  provide  active\ntreatment designed to promote class members’ independence\n45\n\nto  prevent  loss  of  functioning,  thus  meeting  the\nstandards established in the relevant ICF/MR regulations.\nk. An order requiring the defendants to ensure that IDTs, in\naccordance with the relevant ICF/MR regulations, provide\neach class member with habilitation plans.\nl. An  order  “requiring  the  defendants  to  develop  and\nimplement [a] behavior management plan for each class\nmember who needs one through the [IDT] process.”\nm. An order requiring that behavior modifying medications\nare “monitored closely . . . “in conjunction with [a]\nphysician . . . and the [IDT]” and that such medications\n“are gradually withdrawn at least annually . . . unless\nclinical  evidence  justifies  that  this  is\ncontraindicated.”\nn. An order requiring IDTs to determine the “most integrated\nday  program  or supported work program appropriate  to\n[each] class member’s needs.”\no. An order requiring the defendants to “provide community-\nintegrated employment and other day time activities in\nthe  most integrated  setting appropriate to the class\nmember’s needs.”\np. An  order  requiring  the  defendants  to  “provide\nopportunities  for  class  members  to  participate  in\nrecreation and leisure activities in the community off\n46\n\nthe grounds of [STS].”\n(Id. at 171-74.)  As the following discussion makes clear, the\nSpecial Master has addressed all of the issues underlying these\nproposed orders and there is no need for the court to revisit any\nof them. \nThe Remedial Plan in United States v. Connecticut addressed\nhabilitation programming at STS extensively.  See CR 41-44, 46-52;\nsee also United States v. Connecticut, 931 F. Supp. at 978 (citing\na study finding that STS had failed to provide the “continuous,\naggressive, and active treatment programs” necessary to prevent STS\nresidents from  injuring themselves); id. at 982-84 (describing\nSTS’s failure to provide physical therapy services).   In 2005, a\nfinal  compliance evaluation commissioned by the Special Master\nfound that habilitation services at STS were generally meeting\nresidents’  needs.      Report  to  the  Court  No.  60:  Habilitation\n(“Report No. 60”) at 11-13, U.S. v. Conn. (Jan. 17, 2006) (citing\nthe report of Dr. Edward Skarnulis).  In 2006, the court released\nSTS from judicial oversight over the Court Requirements relating to\nhabilitation programming.  Order, U.S. v. Conn. (Jan. 18, 2006). \nMuch of the Special Master’s work on habilitation was directed\nat ensuring that individualized habilitation programming was made\navailable to each resident of STS.  Court Requirements 41 to 43\nrequired that STS create a habilitation plan for each resident and\nthat STS review and update this plan periodically.  Under the\n47\n\nSpecial Master’s supervision, STS implemented the Overall Plan of\nService/Habilitation  Initiative  (“OPS  Initiative”),  which  was\ndesigned to make individualized habilitation programming available\nfor  all  STS  residents.    See  Ruling  on  Case  Management  Plan\nCompliance,  U.S.  v.  Conn.  (Nov.  22,  2005)  (describing  the  OPS\nInitiative  as  “designed  to  move  from  ‘deficit  driven  plans  to\nplanning from peoples’ strengths and preferences  . . . , [that is]\nto a person-focused model’”) (quoting Report to the Court No: 52:\nCase Management (“Report No. 52”), vol. 8 at 27 (Oct. 29, 2003).\nThus,  the  Special  Master  addressed  the  plaintiffs’  specific\nremedial orders a., g., and l. \nIn evaluating the training provided at STS, the Special Master\nand his consultants considered whether the programs provided met\nthe requirements of the ICF/MR regulations.  See Report No. 60 at\n12  (explaining  that  Dr.  Skarnulis,  in  his  final  compliance\nevaluation, had incorporated the active treatment standards from\nthe  ICF/MR  regulations,  which  contemplate  a  more  aggressive\napproach to training with the goal of enhancing patients’ self-\nsufficiency and ability to enjoy productive lives in addition to\npreventing  patients  from  losing  basic  skills  they  currently\npossess); see also Habilitation Services at Southbury Training\nSchool  at  7-9,  U.S.  v.  Conn.  (Nov.  17,  2005)  (Report  of  Dr.\nSkarnulis).    Thus,  the  Special  Master  addressed  the  concerns\nunderlying plaintiffs’ remedial orders j. and k.\n48\n\n  The Special Master oversaw improvements in the procedures used\nfor planning and monitoring habilitation programming.  The Remedial\nPlan required implementation of a “case management” system in which\ncase managers would coordinate all aspects of the services provided\nto STS residents, including habilitation programming.  See CR 45.\nUnder the plan, Case Managers must be qualified “mental retardation\nprofessionals,”  as  defined  by  the  ICF/MR  regulations  and  are\nresponsible  for  ensuring  that  each  resident’s  Overall  Plan  of\nService is prepared and implemented and that residents receive\nservices responsive to their needs.  Report to the Court No. 52,\nvol.  8  at  7-10.      Thus,  the  Special  Master  addressed  the\nplaintiffs’ specific concerns a., h., and k.\nThe Remedial Plan required that STS provide sufficient numbers\nof staff who were qualified to implement the OPS Initiative, thus\naddressing  the  plaintiffs’  specific  concern  i.    See  CR  14\n(addressing qualifications for direct care staff); CR 27 (requiring\nrecruitment to fill positions for occupational, physical and speech\ntherapy specialists); see also CR 13 (setting ratios of supervisory\nto direct care staff).  By 2006, when the court released STS from\njudicial  oversight  over  the  Court  Requirements  relating  to\nhabilitation, “[i]mplementation of habilitation services [had been]\nthe focus of more staff at STS than any other discipline.”  See\nReport No. 60  at 3. \nThe Remedial Plan also required STS to implement policies that\n49\n\nwould  reduce  or  eliminate  unnecessary  use  of  medication  and\nphysical  restraint  in  response  to  residents’  “challenging\nbehavior.”  See CR 46-52; see also Order Purging Defendants of\nContempt and Ending Active Judicial Oversight at 9-11, U.S. v.\nConn.  (Mar. 24, 2006) (mentioning improvements in habilitation\nprogramming at STS and comparing the current state of affairs with\nthe  situation  in  1996,  when  STS  frequently  used  medication  to\nmodify residents behavior in lieu of habilitation).   Thus, the\nSpecial  Master  addressed the issues underlying the plaintiffs’\nspecific remedial orders b. and c.\nThe Remedial Plan mandated the provision of day programs and\nvocational  programs  to  residents,  thus  addressing  the  issues\nunderlying the plaintiffs’ specific remedial orders n., o., p.,\nand, to some extent d. and f.  See CR 44.  The court notes that the\nplaintiffs, in item e. from the list above, also request an order\nrequiring  that  STS  promote  the  participation  of  parents  and\nguardians  in  the  process  of  providing  habilitation.    To  some\nextent, the Remedial Plan addressed the issue of the involvement of\nparents and guardians with the care of their children and wards.\nSee CR 45 (establishing duties of case manager with respect to\nproviding information to parents and guardians); CR 71.  However,\nit is not clear that the plaintiffs would ever be entitled to an\norder like this.  The constitution always requires the court to\ndefer to the judgments of professionals, and, therefore, the court\n50\n\ncannot require the defendants to conduct habilitation programming\nin any particular manner.\nThe remaining remedial order requested by the plaintiffs, m.\nfrom  the  list  above,  relates  to  the  use  of  behavior-modifying\nmedication.  The court has already discussed how the Special Master\nhas  addressed  this  issue  and  has  concluded  that  the  claims\nunderlying the particular relief requested have been rendered moot.\nSee § IIIA supra.\n*          *          *\nWith the few exceptions indicated in the preceding discussion,\nthe Special Master has remedied the alleged deficiencies which the\nplaintiffs  would  have  the  court  refer  to  him.    Because  the\nplaintiffs do not request any additional relief  addressing alleged\nviolations in the areas of medical care, security or habilitation,\nthe court finds that the claims relating to these issues are moot.\nThe court notes, however, that the plaintiffs ask the court to\n“leav[e] to a later date the question as to whether the remedial\nprocess established in United States v. Connecticut can address all\nof the violations of law established [in this case].”  (Pls.’ Post-\nTrial Br. at 164-65, 168.)  Because the court is confident the\nplaintiffs’  concerns  have  been  fully  addressed,  it  does  not\nanticipate that it will be necessary to face this question.  Should\nthe plaintiffs seek additional relief in these areas beyond what\nhas been achieved in United States v. Connecticut, it remains to be\n51\n\nseen whether the plaintiffs,  having elected to seek relief from\nthe  Special  Master’s  remedial  process,  will  be  entitled  to  an\nextensive  examination  by  the  court  into  the  adequacy  of  that\nprocess.\nIn addition, the court notes that the plaintiffs have, in some\ninstances,  asked  to  be  allowed  to  participate  in  the  Special\nMasters’s efforts to resolve the deficiencies they claim to have\nestablished.  (See, e.g., Pls.’ Post-Trial Br. at 164-65.)  For\nobvious reasons, this relief is currently unavailable.  \nIV. Community Placement\nThe  plaintiffs  claim  that  the  defendants  have  failed  to\nexercise professional judgment in determining whether class members\nshould be placed in the community.  Unlike the majority of the\nplaintiffs’ other claims, the issue of community placement was not\naddressed  or  resolved  in  the  United  States  v.  Connecticut\nlitigation.  See Ruling on Plaintiff’s Motion to Adopt the Special\nMaster’s  Findings  and  Recommendations  Regarding  Community\nPlacement, U.S. v. Conn. (Jan. 24, 2001) (declining to adopt the\nSpecial Master’s recommendations on community placement and holding\nthat community placement issues would be addressed in the present\nlitigation); see also Order, U.S. v. Conn. (Jan. 7, 2003) (removing\nthe  issue  of  community  placement  from  the  United  States  v.\nConnecticut litigation).  Therefore, the court will now consider\nwhether the plaintiffs have established the alleged constitutional\n52\n\nand statutory violations by showing that the defendants failed\nadequately to place class members in the community.\nA.  The  Due  Process  Requirement  of  Professional  Judgment in\nCommunity Placement Decisions\nResidents of a state-run institution for the mentally retarded\nhave no constitutional right to community placement.  Society for\nGood Will, 737 F. 2d at 1249 (citing Phillips v. Thompson, 715 F.2d\n365, 368 (7th Cir. 1983) and Garrity v. Gallen, 522 F. Supp. 171,\n237-39 (D.N.H. 1981)).  Nor is there a constitutional right to the\n“least restrictive environment.” Id. (citing cases).  Community\nplacement  decisions  are,  however,  subject  to  scrutiny  under\nYoungberg.  Id.  Like any other decision to place restraints on a\npatient’s  freedom,  the  decision  to  keep  a  resident  in  an\ninstitution instead of placing the resident in a community setting\nmust be “a rational decision based on professional judgment.”  Id.\nat 1249; see also Clark v. Cohen, 794 F.2d 79, 87 (3d Cir. 1986);\nThomas S. v. Flaherty, 902 F.2d 250, 255 (4th Cir. 1990).  As in\nany other application of the Youngberg standard, the court’s role\nin evaluating a decision to keep a mentally disabled individual in\nan institution is a “narrow one,” and the court must defer to the\njudgment of the state’s medical professionals.  David v. Cuomo, 862\nF. Supp. 34, 37 (W.D.N.Y. 1994) (suggesting that if, for example,\n“a patient were being held against his will contrary to all the\nmedical evidence and expert medical opinion, there would clearly be\na constitutional violation”).\n53\n\nB. Community Placement Under the ADA and Section 504\nThe plaintiffs also claim that the defendants’ procedures for\nmaking community placement determinations violated Section 504 of\nthe Rehabilitation Act, codified at 29 U.S.C. § 794, and Title II\nof the ADA, codified at 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12165, both of which\nwere enacted to prohibit discrimination against disabled persons in\nthe provision of public services.  In Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S.\n581, 589 n.1 (1999), the Supreme Court explained that the ADA was\nthe federal government’s “most recent and extensive endeavor to\naddress  discrimination against persons with disabilities.”  In\nenacting the ADA, Congress recognized that “discrimination against\nindividuals  with  disabilities  continues  to  be  a  serious  and\npervasive social problem;” that such discrimination “persists in\nsuch critical areas as . . . institutionalization;” and that the\nforms  of  discrimination  encountered  by  individuals  with\ndisabilities include “outright intentional exclusion, . . . failure\nto make modifications to existing facilities and practices,  . . .\n[and] segregation.”  Id., 527 U.S. at 588-869 (quoting 42 U.S.C. §\n12101(a)(2), (3), (5)). \nTitle II of the ADA provides that “no qualified individual\nwith a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded\nfrom participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,\nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to\ndiscrimination  by  any  such  entity.”    42  U.S.C.  §  12132.    To\n54\n\nestablish a prima facie violation of § 12132, a plaintiff must show\n1) that he or she is a “qualified individual with a disability;” 2)\nthat he or she is being excluded from participation in or being\ndenied the benefit of some service, program or activity by reason\nof his or her disability; and 3) that the entity that provides the\nservice, program or activity is a public entity.  Civic Ass’n of\nDeaf v. Giuliani, 915 F. Supp. 622, 634 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (citing\nClarkson v. Coughlin, 898 F. Supp. 1019, 1037 (S.D.N.Y. 1995)).13\nIt  is  undisputed  both  that  class  members  are  qualified\nindividuals with disabilities and that STS is a public entity.  The\nplaintiffs argue that they have established that class members have\nbeen “excluded from participation in or denied the benefit of a\nservice, program or activity” in two different ways.  First, the\nplaintiffs argue that the defendants have violated the “integration\nmandate” set forth in the federal regulations interpreting the ADA.\nSecond,  the  plaintiffs  claim  that  defendants  DMR  and  STS\ndiscriminated on the basis of severity of disability by refusing to\nconsider severely disabled STS residents for community placement.\n13A prima facies case under Section 504 is established in the\nsame manner.  Messier, 1999 WL 20910 at *8 n.7 (citing Rothschild\nv. Grottenthaler, 907 F.2d 286, 289-90 (2d Cir. 1990)); see also \nFrederick L. v. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, 364 F.3d 487, 491 (3d Cir.\n2004).  The only relevant difference between the two statutes is\nthat Section 504 applies to entities receiving federal financial\nassistance, whereas Title II of the ADA applies to all public\nentities.  Pierce v. County of Orange, 519 F.3d 985, 1010 n.27\n(9th Cir. 2008).\n55\n\nI.   The Integration Mandate\nSection  12134(a)  instructed the Attorney General to issue\nregulations implementing § 12132’s prohibition on discrimination.\nIn  response, the Attorney General promulgated regulations that\nexpress  a  preference  for  community-based  placement  over\ninstitutionalization, where appropriate.  In particular, 28 C.F.R.\n§ 35.130(d)) provides that “[a] public entity shall administer\nservices, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting\nappropriate  to  the  needs  of  qualified  individuals  with\ndisabilities.”  The “most integrated setting” is defined as “a\nsetting that enables individuals with disabilities to interact with\nnon-disabled persons to the fullest extent possible.” 28 C.F.R. pt.\n35 app. A; quoted in Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 593.  “In short, where\nappropriate for the patient, both the ADA and [Section 504] favor\nintegrated, community-based treatment over institutionalization.”\nFrederick L., 364 F.3d at 491-92.\nThis court has previously held that the plaintiffs may prove\ndiscrimination by showing that the defendants keep class members at\nSTS despite  determinations by DMR professionals that  community\nplacement is appropriate.  Messier, 1999 WL 20910 at *10.  Further\nguidance as to how the court should interpret Title II of ADA and\nthe guidelines implementing it is offered by the Supreme Court’s\nsubsequent decision in Olmstead.  In that decision, the Supreme\nCourt considered the claims of two mentally retarded women who\n56\n\nremained in an institution in Georgia despite the opinions of the\nwomen’s  treating  professionals  that  available  community-based\nprograms met their needs.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 593.  The court\nheld that the state had violated § 13132 by keeping the women in an\ninstitution and explained that under the ADA and the guidelines\ninterpreting it\nStates are required to provide community-based treatment\nfor persons with mental disabilities when the State’s\ntreatment professionals determine that such placement is\nappropriate, the  affected persons do not oppose such\ntreatment,  and  the  placement  can  be  reasonably\naccommodated, taking into account the resources available\nto  the  State  and  the  needs  of  others  with  mental\ndisabilities.\nId. at 607.\nThe  Supreme  Court  found  that  the  interpretive  guidelines\n“constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which\ncourts and litigants may properly resort for guidance. ” Id. at 598\n(quoting  Bragdon  v.  Abbott,  524  U.S.  624,  642  (1998)  (quoting\nSkidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 139-140 (1944))); See also\nHelen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d 325, 331-32 (3d Cir. 1995) (giving\ndeference under Chevron v. Natural Res. Defense Council, 467 U.S.\n837 (1984), to the Attorney General’s interpretation of Title II),\ncert. denied, 516 U.S. 813 (1995). Importantly, the Supreme Court\napproved  of  the  Attorney  General’s  interpretation  of  what\nconstitutes  unlawful  discrimination  under  §  13132.    The  Court\nrejected the notion that proof of discrimination in this context\nrequires a showing of unequal treatment among similarly situated\n57\n\nindividuals.  The Court concluded that Congress intended for the\nADA to do more than simply prohibit unequal treatment, and the\nCourt held that “[u]njustified isolation . . . is properly regarded\nas discrimination based on disability.”  Id. at 597.    The Court\nreasoned that the Attorney General’s interpretation of the Title II\nprohibition  on  discrimination  reflected  the  judgment  that\n“institutional placement of persons who can handle and benefit from\ncommunity settings perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons\nso isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community\nlife.”  Id. at 600 (citing Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 755\n(1984) and Los Angeles Dept. of Water & Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S.\n702, 707, n.13 (1978)).  The Supreme Court further noted that\n“confinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday\nlife activities of individuals, including family relations, social\ncontacts,  work  options,  economic  independence,  educational\nadvancement, and cultural enrichment.”  Id., 527 U.S. at 601.\nWhile the plaintiffs may establish a prima facie violation of\nTitle II by showing that the defendants have failed to comply with\nthe regulations’ integration mandate, “nothing in the ADA or its\nimplementing  regulations  condones  termination  of  institutional\nsettings for persons unable to handle or benefit from community\nsettings.”  Id. at 601-602.  A state “generally may rely on the\nreasonable  assessments of its own professionals in determining\nwhether  an  individual  ‘meets  the  essential  eligibility\n58\n\nrequirements’ for habilitation in a community-based program.”  Id.\nat 602 (citing 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).  In considering whether an\nindividual has been unjustifiably isolated in an institution, the\ncourt “normally should defer to the reasonable medical judgments of\npublic health officials.”  See School Bd. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273,\n288 (1987); cited in Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 602. \nii. Discrimination  on  the  Basis  of  Severity  of  Disability  in\nCommunity Placement Decisions\nThe plaintiffs also claim they have established a violation of\nthe ADA by showing that the defendants have failed to consider\ncertain severely retarded class members for community placement.\nThe Attorney General’s regulations implementing the Title II of the\nADA make it clear that a state cannot discriminate on the basis of\nseverity of disability in providing services.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130\nprovides that\nA  public  entity,  in  providing  any  aid,  benefit,  or\nservice, may not . . . [p]rovide different or separate\naids,  benefits,  or  services  to  individuals  with\ndisabilities  or  to  any  class  of  individuals  with\ndisabilities than  is provided to others, unless such\naction is necessary to provide qualified individuals with\ndisabilities with aids, benefits, or services that are as\neffective as those provided to others.\nSee  also  Helen  L.,  46  F.3d  at  336,  (“[I]f  Congress  were  only\nconcerned with disparate treatment of the disabled as compared to\ntheir nondisabled counterparts,” then the ADA’s reference to the\npersistence  of  discrimination  in  institutionalization  would\nconstitute a “non sequitur”); Williams v. Wasserman, 937 F. Supp.\n59\n\n524, 530 (D. Md. 1996) (holding that “the ADA does oblige the\ndefendants to make [a program of community-based treatment options]\navailable to otherwise qualified individuals without regard to the\nseverity  or  particular  classification  .  .  .  of  their\ndisabilities”).  Hahn v. Linn Cty., 130 F. Supp.2d 1036, 1050 (N.D.\nIowa 2001).  See also Martin v. Voinovich, 840 F. Supp. 1175,\n1191-92 (S.D. Ohio 1993);  Jackson v. Fort Stanton Hosp. & Training\nSch.,  757  F.  Supp.  1243,  1299  (D.N.M.1990)  (“The  severity  of\nplaintiffs’ handicaps is itself a handicap which, under § 504,\ncannot  be  the  sole  reason  for  denying  plaintiffs  access  to\ncommunity programs”), rev’d on other grounds, 964 F.2d 980 (10th\nCir. 1992); Conner v. Branstad, 839 F. Supp. 1346, 1356 (S.D. Iowa\n1993); Garrity v. Gallen, 522 F. Supp. 171, 214-15 (D.N.H. 1981);\nLynch v. Maher, 507 F. Supp. 1268, 1278-79 n.15 (D. Conn. 1981).\nConsistent with these interpretations of the law, this court\nhas  previously  held  that  the  plaintiffs  may  show  that  the\ndefendants “violate the ADA and Section 504 by refusing to consider\nseverely  handicapped  STS  residents  for  community  placement  or\nvocational rehabilitation on the basis of severity of disability.”\nMessier, 1999 WL 20910 at *10.\niii. Defenses Under the ADA and Section 504\nThere  is  no  “federal  requirement  that  community-based\ntreatment be imposed on patients who do not desire it.”  Olmstead,\n527 U.S. at 602 (citing 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(e)(1)).  Therefore, the\n60\n\ndefendants  may  rebut  a  prima  facie  case  by  showing  that  they\noffered community placements to qualified STS residents and that\nthe residents declined. \nThe  defendants  may  also  rebut  a  prima  facie  case  by\nestablishing that the relief sought by the plaintiffs would require\na “fundamental alteration” of the state’s mental health system.\nFrederick L., 364 F.3d at 493-94.  This defense is derived from the\nregulations implementing the ADA, which provide that \nA public entity shall make reasonable modifications in\npolicies, practices, or procedures when the modifications\nare necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of\ndisability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that\nmaking the modifications would fundamentally alter the\nnature of the service, program, or activity.\n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7) (1998); quoted in Olmstead, 527 U.S. at\n592.14    The  “fundamental  alteration”  defense  is  an  affirmative\ndefense; once the plaintiffs have established a prima facie case,\nthe burden shifts to the defendants to establish that the remedy\nsought  requires  something  more  extensive  than  a  reasonable\nmodification of existing policies.  Frederick L., 364 F.3d at 492\nn. 4. \nDetermination  of  whether  a  modification  is  “‘reasonable’\ninvolves  a  fact-specific,  case-by-case  inquiry  that  considers,\n14The Rehabilitation Act imposes the same “reasonable\nmodifications” requirement.  See Staron v. McDonald's Corp., 51\nF.3d 353, 355 (2d Cir. 1995) (citing cases).  For all relevant\npurposes, the legal analysis required by Section 504 is identical\nto the analysis under the ADA.\n61\n\namong other factors, the effectiveness of the modification in light\nof the nature of the disability in question and the cost to the\norganization that would implement it.”  Staron v. McDonald's Corp.,\n51 F.3d 353, 356 (2d Cir. 1995) (citing D’Amico v. New York State\nBd. of Law Examiners, 813 F. Supp. 217, 221-22 (W.D.N.Y. 1993)).\nThe state is not required to achieve integration at any cost, and\nthe unreasonable cost to the state of implementing or expanding\ncommunity-based  programs  may  be  one  factor  in  establishing  a\nfundamental alteration defense.  See Helen L., 46 F.3d at 339;\nToledo v. Sanchez, 454 F.3d 24, 39 (1st Cir. 2006); Cable v. Dept.\nof Developmental Servs., 973 F. Supp. 937, 942 (C.D. Cal. 1997).\nHowever, a state’s budgetary constraints alone will not excuse\nfailure to comply with Title II or Section 504.  Helen L., 46 F.3d\nat 339; Pennsylvania Protection and Advocacy, Inc. v. Pennsylvania\nDept. of Publ. Welfare, 402 F.3d 374, 381 (3d Cir. 2005); see also\nFisher v. Oklahoma Health Care Auth., 335 F.3d 1175 (10th Cir.\n2003) (“If every alteration in a program or service that required\nthe outlay of funds were tantamount to a fundamental alteration,\nthe ADA’s integration mandate would be hollow indeed.”); Bruggeman\nv. Blagojevich, 219 F.R.D. 430, 434 (N.D. Ill. 2004) (holding that\na fundamental alteration defense “requires a court to weigh and to\nbalance . . . (1) the resources available to a state; (2) the range\nof services a state provides those with mental disabilities; and\n(3) a state’s obligation to mete out those services equitably”).\n62\n\niv. Eleventh Amendment Immunity to Suit Under the ADA\nThe  defendants  argue  that  the  plaintiffs’  ADA  claims  are\nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment, which has been interpreted to\npreclude suits brought in federal courts under federal law against\na state or its agencies.  See Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1 (1890);\nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 100 (1984).\nThe plaintiffs contend that the ADA abrogated states’ Eleventh\nAmendment  sovereign  immunity.  (Plaintiffs’  Br.  Addressing  the\nApplicability of Bd. of Trustees v. Garrett at 1-16 (Doc. No.\n843).)  The defendants respond that the Supreme Court’s decision in\nBd. of Trustees v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356 (2001), demonstrates that\nthe ADA did not abrogate the state’s Eleventh Amendment sovereign\nimmunity, and, therefore, that the plaintiffs cannot sue under the\nADA. \nIf the defendants are correct, then their Eleventh Amendment\narguments apply only to the claims against STS, which is the only\nstate agency sued in this case.  Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123\n(1908), established an exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity\nthat  allows  for  federal  law  suits  seeking  prospective  relief\nagainst state officials who are sued in their official capacities.\nEdelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 (1974); State Employees Bargaining\nAgent Coalition v. Rowland, 494 F.3d 71, 94 (2007).  The injunctive\nrelief sought by the plaintiffs for alleged ongoing violations of\nthe ADA and Section 504 is properly characterized as prospective.\n63\n\nSee Verizon Maryland, Inc. v. Public Service Com'n of Maryland, 535\nU.S. 635, 645 (2002) (“In determining whether the doctrine of Ex\nparte Young avoids an Eleventh Amendment bar to suit, a court need\nonly  conduct  a  ‘straightforward  inquiry  into  whether  [the]\ncomplaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks\nrelief properly characterized as prospective’”) (quoting Idaho v.\nCoeur d’Alene Tribe, 521 U.S. 261, 296 (1997)).  The plaintiffs’\nclaims against the defendants Commissioner of DMR and the Director\nof STS fall squarely within the Ex parte Young exception.15  See\nHenrietta  D.  v.  Bloomberg,  331  F.3d  261,  288  (2d  Cir.  2003)\n(holding that “an individual sued in his or her official capacity\nunder the doctrine of Ex parte Young is . . . subject to liability\nunder the ADA”); Randolph v. Rodgers, 253 F.3d 342 (8th Cir. 2001)\n(allowing official-capacity claims against state officials under\nADA and Section 504); Miranda B. v. Kitzhaber, 328 F.3d 1181,\n1187-88 (9th Cir. 2003).\nResolution of the question of whether or not the plaintiffs\nmay sue STS itself, as opposed to the STS Director and the DMR\n15The plaintiffs do not specify in their Third Amended\nComplaint whether they have sued the defendants in their official\nor personal capacities, but it is clear that this suit seeking\ninjunctive relief against STS and DMR is an official-capacity\nsuit.  See Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165 (1985)\n(“Personal-capacity suits seek to impose personal liability upon\na government official for actions he takes under color of state\nlaw [while] [o]fficial-capacity suits, in contrast, generally\nrepresent only another way of pleading an action against an\nentity of which an officer is an agent.”) (citations and\nquotations omitted).\n64\n\nCommissioner, for violations of the ADA would have no practical\nimpact on the outcome of this case.  An order granting injunctive\nrelief against the state officials responsible for operating STS\nwould  have  the  same  practical  effect  as  an  order  granting\ninjunctive relief against STS itself.  See Kentucky v. Graham, 473\nU.S. 159, 165-66 (1985) (quotations omitted) (“Official-capacity\nsuits . . . generally represent only another way of pleading an\naction against an entity of which an officer is an agent,” and\n“[a]s  long  as  the  government  entity  receives  notice  and  an\nopportunity  to  respond,  an  official-capacity  suit  is,  in  all\nrespects other than name, to be treated as a suit against the\nentity.”); Will v. Mich. Dep’t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71\n(1989);  Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 288 (2d Cir.\n2003)  (“The real party in interest in an official-capacity suit is\nthe government entity.”)  The court therefore sees no need to reach\nthis difficult constitutional issue.\nC. Community Placement at STS\nThe plaintiffs have devoted a significant part of their case\nto demonstrating that community placement has substantial benefits\nfor mentally disabled individuals who would otherwise be confined\nin an institution.  According to the plaintiffs’ experts, many\nmentally retarded individuals who leave institutional settings and\nare placed in the community demonstrate improvements in quality of\nlife, improvements in health, improvements in communication and\n65\n\nother skills, and decreases in challenging behavior.  (See, e.g.,\nPls.’  Ex  423H  at  4-14  (Conroy  Report)  (reviewing  studies  of\ncommunity placement out of other institutions); Tr. 3/8/99 at 24-25\n(LaVigna).)  For their part, the defendants do not dispute that\ncommunity  placements  may  benefit  many  mentally  disabled\nindividuals, but their experts dispute the notion that “movement to\nthe community is somehow therapeutic.”  (Tr. 6/9/99 at 148 (Walsh);\nsee also Defs.’ Ex. 13C (Walsh’s Rebuttal Report).)  The defendants\nclaim  that  the  plaintiffs’  experts  are  unreliable16  and  that\n16One of the defendants’ arguments about the reliability of\nthe plaintiffs’ experts is based on Federal Rule of Evidence 702,\nwhich governs the qualification of expert witnesses and the\nadmissibility of their testimony at trial.  Relying on Rule 702\nand cases such as Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, 509\nU.S. 579 (1993), which interpret that rule, the defendants argue\nthat all of the plaintiffs’ witnesses are unreliable.  (Defs.’\nPost-Trial Br. at 7-19.)  These cases are simply inapplicable\nhere because the experts have already testified and the\nevidentiary phase of the trial is complete.  The defendants did\nnot object when the plaintiffs moved to qualify their experts as\nwitnesses.  (See, e.g., Tr. 2/9/99 at 148 (certifying plaintiff’s\nwitness Dr. Sue Gant as an expert without objection by the\ndefendants); Tr. 2/3/99 at 40; Tr. 3/8/99 at 52.).  The court\ndoes not believe that the defendants raised the Daubert issue at\nany point before the plaintiffs rested, and they cannot raise the\nDaubert issue now.  See, e.g., Macsenti v. Becker, 237 F.3d 1223,\n1233-34 (10th Cir. 2001) (reasoning that “enforcement of the\nrequirement for the Daubert analysis [is] premised on a party’s\nobjection” and that such objections are waived if not raised at\nthe proper time).  Of course, the court must evaluate the\ntestimony of all witnesses, and it will discount the testimony of\nany witness – expert or lay – who gives testimony that is\nincredible or unreliable.  The defendants are free to argue that\nany particular witness’ testimony should not be relied upon. \nHowever, the defendants’ blanket argument that the plaintiffs’\nwitnesses did not satisfy the gate-keeping requirements of Rule\n702 is misplaced. \n66\n\ncommunity placement may have negative effects.  For example, the\ndefendants  point  out  that  difficulties  may  arise  in  ensuring\neffective monitoring and oversight over the provision of services\nto mentally retarded individuals living in the community, (Tr.\n5/28/99 at 44 (Strauss)), and that it may be more difficult for\nindividuals living in the community to gain access to specialist\nmedical professionals (Tr. 6/9/99 at 148 (Walsh)).\nThe court does not take a position in a policy debate about\nthe virtues of deinstitutionalization.  The court does not doubt\nthat placement in the community would be beneficial for many class\nmembers, but community placement may not be a possibility or a\nnecessity for every class member.  As the court has said in a\nprevious ruling: \nThe most that plaintiffs can accomplish is to require STS\nto conform with its constitutional and statutory duty to\nconsider the appropriateness of community placement.  In\nno way can the plaintiffs force STS to place in community\nsettings  those  for  whom  community  placement  is\ninappropriate.  There can be little disagreement that\nhaving the right to choose between institutionalization\nand community placement will benefit [class members].\nMessier, 183 F.R.D. at 358.  Congress, in enacting the ADA, and the\nAttorney General, in issuing regulations interpreting the ADA, have\nmade the judgment that mentally retarded individuals should live in\nthe most integrated setting that is appropriate to their needs.\nThe court must do what it can to give effect to this statutory\npreference for integration, while keeping in mind that it must\ndefer to the judgment of the defendants’ medical and mental health\n67\n\nprofessionals  in  determining  whether  community  placement  is\nappropriate for individual class members.\nSTS  is  not  an  integrated  setting.    It  is  a  segregated\ninstitution  in  which  all  residents  are  mentally  disabled.\nFurthermore,  STS  is  a  relatively  isolated  campus  in  a  rural\nsetting.  (Tr. 2/10/99 at 171 (Gant); Tr. 3/2/99 at 134 (Bondy).)\nWith the exception of day programs, residents of STS have limited\nopportunities to interact with people from outside the institution\nor with non-disabled people. (Tr. 2/10/99 at 171-74 (Gant).) \n Few STS residents were placed in the community in the years\npreceding the trial.  According to STS Director Charles Hamad, in\nthe fiscal years 1996, 1997 and 1998, the number of community\nplacements for STS residents was, respectively, 19, 12, and 21.\n(Tr. 9/13/99 at 83.)17  The plaintiffs claim that there are many\nmore class members who would like to live in the community and who\nwould be found qualified for community placement if professional\njudgment were exercised.  The defendants do not seem to dispute\nthat many or all class members could be placed in the community\n17There is some uncertainty in the record about the numbers\nof STS residents who have been placed.  Gant’s review of STS\ndocuments indicated that 66 residents had been placed between\nAugust 1994 and the end of 1998 (Tr. 2/12/99 at 61-63.) \nAccording to Gant, the placements for each fiscal year were as\nfollows: 11 in 1994, 19 in 1995, 12 in 1997, and 3 in 1998. (Id.) \nGeorge Moore, who was an assistant director and then later a co-\ndirector at STS between 1995 and the date of the trial, testified\nthat he believed that there had been 73 placements in the\ncommunity between 1995 and the trial. (Tr. 9/27/99 at 74.)\n68\n\nunder  the  right  circumstances.    The  defendants’  witnesses,\nincluding officials at STS, rejected a so-called “readiness model”\nand testified that anyone currently placed at STS could live in the\ncommunity if provided with the appropriate “supports and services.”\n(See, e.g., Tr. 9/13/99 at 114, 134 (Hamad); Tr. 3/30/99 at 154\n(Mulvey); Tr. 6/9/99 at 144-45 (Walsh) (rejecting the notion that\nthere is a “must stay group” of class members and taking the view\nthat  “[i]f  you  spend  enough  money  you  can  serve  anybody\nanyplace”).)\nI. IDT Community Placement Recommendations From 1996 Until the\nTrial\nThe services and treatment to be provided to each STS resident\nare  determined  by  an  Interdisciplinary  Team  (“IDT”),  which  is\ncomposed of the resident and his or her relatives, guardians and\nadvocates, staff from the resident’s residential and day programs,\nthe resident’s case manager, and various medical and/or programming\nspecialists.  (Tr. 2/26/99 at 58-59 (Ale); Pls.’ Ex. 401 (DMR-1,\nDMR-11).)  DMR policy dictates that IDT members are to “share all\ninformation and recommendations” with each other, and “decisions\nshould be made by consensus.”  (Tr. 2/26/99 at 66 (Ale) (quoting\nDMR  11-5).)    The  IDT  records  its  decisions,  goals  and\nrecommendations in the resident’s Overall Plan of Service (“OPS”),18\n18The OPS is a “document which specifies a strategy to guide\nthe delivery of service to a client for up to one year.”  (Pls.’\nEx. 401 (DMR 11-3).)\n69\n\nwhich must be rewritten at least once annually.  (Pls.’ Ex. 401\n(DMR 11); Tr. 2/26/99 at 66 (Ale).)  DMR policy requires that the\nOPS process should focus, among other goals, on integration of\nresidents into “normalized settings” and into “less restrictive\nprogram alternatives.”  (Pls.’ Ex. 401 (DMR 11-4); Tr. 2/26/99 at\n68  (Ale).)    Under  DMR  regulations,  IDTs  are  responsible  for\nconsidering  and,  where  appropriate,  recommending  community\nplacement for individual class members.  (See Tr. 2/26/99 at 75-78\n(Ale).) \nPrior  to  October  of  1996,  there  was  a  process  whereby\ncommunity  placement  recommendations  by  IDTs  were  recorded  and\nreported to the administration and, ultimately, to the DMR.  (Tr.\n4/5/99 at 112-13 (Howley); see also Tr. 2/26/99 at 122 (Ale, who\noversaw IDTs until 1995 as Unit Director at STS, being impeached\nwith a statement he made in his deposition that “there was an\nidentification of need [for community placements] coming out of the\nindividual OPSs” in previous years).)  Statistics indicating the\nnumber of individuals who were interested in community placement\nwere  reported  in  the  Monthly  Management  Reports  issued  by  the\ncentral office of the DMR.  (Tr. 4/5/99 at 112-13 (Howley); Tr.\n9/13/99 at 103-5 (Hamad).)   The October 1996, Monthly Management\nReport, for example, indicated that families and guardians of 40\nindividuals  (5%  of  STS  residents)  were  “very  interested”  in\ncommunity placement, and families and guardians of 285 individuals\n70\n\n(59% of STS residents) were “willing to look” into the option.\n(Pls.’ Ex. 390.)  Prior Monthly Management Reports contain similar\nfigures.  (Id.)\nAround  1996,  however,  the  administration  at  STS  stopped\ngathering information about class members’ interest in community\nplacement from IDTs.  Most OPS documents produced after 1996 do not\nindicate that IDTs ever made individualized community placement\ndecisions or recommendations.  The “Future Plan” sections of these\nOPSs, which  is  where  community placement recommendations would\nordinarily be found, do not mention community placement.  (Tr.\n2/26/99 at 98-101 (Ale); Tr. 2/11/99 at 147 (Gant); Tr. 3/29/99 at\n78 (Ostrum Depo.)  Instead the majority of these documents make\ngeneric references to residents requiring a residential setting\nwith 24-hour supervision, but they do not indicate whether these\nneeds  should  be  met  in  a  community  placement  as  opposed  to  a\nresidence on the STS campus.  (Tr. 2/26/99 at 102-6 (Ale); Pls.’\nEx. 411.)  In contrast, many pre-1995 OPSs specifically indicated\nthat community placement was appropriate.  (Tr. 2/26/99 at 122-23\n(Ale); Tr. 3/30/99 at 136 (Mulvey).)  \nThe change in practice was intentional on the part of STS\nadministrators.    Judith  Mulvey,  an  assistant  director  at  STS,\nadmitted  that,  at  some  point  in  1995  or  1996,  the  STS\nadministration instructed IDTs to stop referring to placements “in\nthe community” in OPSs. (Tr. 3/30/99 at 137; Pls.’ Ex. 426  (Mulvey\n71\n\nDepo. 2/9/98 at 74-77).)  William Ale, who was Director of Family\nSupport Services at STS during this period, testified that, in his\nview, IDTs were not required to determine what the most integrated\nsetting would be for a resident; instead, he directed them only to\nconsider whether the current placement at STS was appropriate.\n(Tr. 2/26/99 at 102, 107-8.)  Kathryn Hanewicz, Director of Family\nSupport Services at STS, testified that she believes that IDTs do\nnot consider whether placement at STS or somewhere else would be\nthe most integrated setting for residents.  (Tr. 7/15/99 at 60-61).\nThe result of this change in policy was that there ceased to\nbe a formal mechanism for considering community placement for class\nmembers.  Mulvey admitted that the generic statements appearing in\nOPS Future Plans sections during this period were “not based on\nformal assessment” of residents’ needs.  (Tr. 3/30/99 at 147.)  A\nnumber  of  case  managers  who  worked  at  STS  during  this  period\ntestified  that  they  believed  that  it  was  not  part  of  the  OPS\nprocess specifically to consider community placement.19  (See, e.g.,\n19Examination of the OPSs produced during this period of time\nindicates that a number of IDTs continued to discuss community\nplacement.  A substantial number of Future Plans sections state\nthat community placement would be appropriate or that residents\nand their guardians would be willing to consider community\nplacement.  (Pls.’ Ex. 411.)  One explanation for this is that\ncase managers continued to include the phrase “in the community”\nout of habit.  (Pls.’ Ex. 426  (Mulvey Depo. 2/9/98 at 75).) \nWhatever the reason, a large number of class members whose OPS\nrefer to community placement had not been placed at the time of\nthe trial.  (See Pls.’ Reply to Defs.’ Post-Trial Br. at 49-51\n(listing 61 class members whose OPSs refer to community placement\nas being appropriate).)\n72\n\nTr. 3/29/99 at 22-23 (Katlamos Depo.), 31-32 (Morgan Depo.), 37\n(McGuire Depo.), 60 (Palmer Depo.); see also Tr. 2/11/99 at 148\n(Gant).)  One of the plaintiffs’ experts, who had reviewed the\npractices and conditions at STS, reported that STS was unusual –\neven  when  compared  to  other  institutions  he  had  observed  in\nConnecticut and elsewhere – in that its “clinical teams [were]\ninstructed explicitly to obfuscate clients’ appropriate level of\ncare” in this manner.  (Pls.’ Ex. 423B at 43-44 (Ray’s Report).)\nIt is apparent that during the fiscal years 1996, 1997 and 1998,\nfor  the  majority  of  class  members,  the  IDTs  either  failed  to\nconsider community placement or, in cases where community placement\nwas considered, did not make a record of any recommendation or\ndecision that was made regarding community placement. \nThe change in policy at STS followed changes in the state\ngovernment and change in the leadership at DMR.  In 1993, then-\nGovernor Wiecker announced his intention to close STS entirely, and\nToni Richardson, who was then DMR Commissioner, began to develop a\nplan to close STS within five years.  (Tr. 9/27/99 at 47 (Moore).)\nThe announcement of this plan angered many STS residents’ families\nand guardians.  (Id. at 48.)  After Governor Rowland took office in\n1995, the state changed course.  (Id.)  Defendant O’Meara, the\nincoming DMR Commissioner, emphasized improving services at STS and\ntook the position that residents and their guardians should be able\nto  choose  whether  or  not  to  stay  at  the  institution.    (Id.)\n73\n\nInstead of trying to close STS, O’Meara worked to get additional\nfederal funding for STS by certifying as many beds as possible\nunder the IFC/MR program.  (Id. at 52.)\nStatistics  relating  to  the  number  of  class  members  whose\nfamilies and guardians were willing to consider community placement\nare strikingly  absent from Monthly Management Reports produced\nafter November of 1996.  In stark contrast to the reports from\nOctober 1996 and before, the November 1996 report states that 730\nresidents “wish to stay” at STS and only 25 “wish to move.”  (Pls.\nEx. 309.)  STS Director Hamad testified that he and Commissioner\nO’Meara jointly agreed that STS should stop reporting numbers of\nclass members who were “willing to look” but who had not reached a\ndecision about community placement.  (Tr. 9/13/99 at 108-9.)  His\nexplanation for the decision to exclude this category is puzzling.\nHe testified that this data \ndidn’t really have any meaning to us anymore.  It is like\nasking  people  whether  they  would  be  interested  in\nconsidering another job.  A lot of people would say yes\nto that, but that doesn’t mean that they are out there\nlooking for jobs.\n(Tr. 9/13/99 at 108.)  This statement seems to reveal a belief that\nSTS medical professionals should be absolved of responsibility to\nexercise their professional judgment about recommending placement\nin all cases except those in which a class member, a parent, or a\nguardian has explicitly asked for community placement.  Such an\nattitude is inconsistent with the integration mandate of the ADA\n74\n\nand § 504.  \nii. Availability of Placement Resources for Class Members\nAnother  major  impediment  to  the  exercise  of  professional\njudgment  in  considering  community  placement  for  class  members\nduring the period from approximately 1996 until the trial was the\nmanner  in  which  community  placements  were  made  available  for\nresidents of STS.  STS officials testified that most placements out\nof the institution have been “opportune,” that is they depend on an\nopening in an existing community residence somewhere in the state.\n(See  Tr.  2/26/99  at  78,  84-85  (Ale).)    Under  the  opportune\nplacement process, the coordinator of a regional branch of the DMR\nnotifies STS of a vacancy in his or her region.  (Tr. 2/26/99 at\n78-79  (Ale).)    STS  then  sends  a  description  of  the  placement\nopportunity  to  its  case  managers  who,  together  with  other  IDT\nmembers, consider whether the placement is appropriate for any of\nthe residents for whom the team is responsible.  (Id.)  If the IDT\ndetermines that placement is appropriate for an individual, and if\nthe individual’s guardian consents to placement, a referral is\nmade.  (Tr. 2/12/99 at 62 (Gant).)\nOpportune  placements  become  available  relatively\ninfrequently.20  The availability of an opportune placement that is\n20The number of opportune placements available each year is\nunclear.  Ale testified during his deposition that three or four\nopportune placements become available each year.  (Tr. 2/26/99 at\n79-80.)  At trial, he testified that this number was too low but\nwas unable to say how many opportune placements he believed were\n75\n\nsuitable for a particular STS resident depends entirely on what\nopenings occur in the regions.  (Tr. 2/26/99 at 78-79 (Ale).)  STS\nresidents  must  compete  with  other  disabled  individuals  in\nConnecticut for these openings.  (Id.)  Furthermore, because STS\nresidents already have a place to live, they are not considered to\nbe a high priority for opportune placements.  (Tr. 9/27/99 at 73\n(Moore); see also Pls.’ Ex. 423B at 44 (Ray’s Report) (reporting\nthat  senior  staff  at  STS  believe  that  class  members  are\n“discriminated  against  in  their  opportunities  for  community\nplacement”).)  \nThe  resulting  scarcity  of  opportune  placement  for  class\nmembers  is  highly  problematic  because  it  further  restricts\nopportunities  for  professional  judgment  to  be  exercised.    Ale\ntestified that case managers and IDTs “are not supposed to make a\njudgment” about community placement and are only responsible for\nreferring a resident to a community placement “if an opportunity\nbecomes available.”  (Tr. 2/26/99 at 90.)  Dr. Sue Gant, one of the\nplaintiffs’  experts,  reported  that  she  had  learned  that  case\nmanagers did not make referrals for community placement because\nthere  were  insufficient  resources  with  which  to  place  class\nmembers.    (Pls.’  Ex.  423C  at  36.)    Gant  estimated  that\napproximately 650 STS residents have never had the benefit of a\nreferral for a community placement.  (Tr. 2/12/99 at 58.)  This\navailable each year.  (Id.)\n76\n\npractice violates DMR policy, which requires that the OPS “should\nbe built around the individual needs of each client regardless of\nthe availability of resources.”  (See Pls.’ Ex. 401 (DMR 11-4).)\nKevin Walsh, one of the defendants’ experts, testified that he\nbelieves that it is improper for an institution to restrict IDTs\nfrom  considering  community  placement  and  that  IDTs  should  be\nallowed  to  “do  that  without  consideration  of  availability  of\nresources.” (Tr. 7/21/99 at 136-38.)\nEven  in  cases  in  which  STS  determines  that  placement  is\nappropriate, a resident who is referred for an opportune placement\nmay  be  rejected  by  the  regional  director,  who  will  make  the\nultimate determination of whether to accept a resident who has been\nreferred by his or her IDT.  (Tr. 2/26/99 at 79 (Ale).)  As a\nresult, many referrals by STS have not resulted in a placement.\n(Tr. 2/11/99 at 152 (Gant).)  Furthermore, while it is possible to\nmodify opportune placements to some extent in order to accommodate\nthe needs of a resident, it is also the case that an opportune\nplacement may simply not be appropriate for a class member who has\nbeen referred for placement.  (Tr. 9/27/99 at 73-74 (Moore).)  Some\nclass members who have requested placement in the community have\nbeen  referred  for  placement  a  number  of  times  but  have  been\nrejected by the regions on each occasion.  (Tr. 2/26/99 at 98\n(Ale); Pls.’ Ex. 340.)  According to Gant’s review of the 108 STS\nresidents referred for placement from 1994 to 1998, only 66 were\n77\n\nsuccessfully placed.  (Tr. 2/12/99 at 62 (Gant).) \nAnother major weakness of the opportune placement process is\nthat STS has no control over what community placement resources\nbecome  available  through  opportune  referrals.    STS  and  DMR\ntherefore cannot systematically develop resources appropriate to\nSTS residents’ placement needs.  (Pls.’ Ex. 423C at 33 (Gant’s\nReport); Tr. 2/26/99 at 23-24 (Ale); see also id. at 89 (Ale)\n(testifying that there should be “some process to create resources\nin the regions to accommodate people at [STS]”); see also Tr.\n3/29/99 at 59 (Palmer Depo.) (testifying that case managers at STS\ncannot do anything to ensure that there are community placement\nresources for class members who wish to leave STS).) \nThus,  the  opportune  placement  system  severely  limits  the\nexercise  of  professional  judgment  with  regard  to  community\nplacements, and, even in the few cases in which STS does exercise\nprofessional judgment, such judgment may be thwarted when a class\nmember is rejected by a regional director. \nIn  addition  to  opportune  placement,  there  also  exists  a\nprocedure through which DMR may develop community placements for\nparticular STS residents.  When a resident or his or her guardian\nindicates  a  preference  for  community  placement,  the  DMR\nCommissioner is able to request funding from the legislature for an\nappropriate placement for the subsequent fiscal year.  (Tr. 7/15/99\nat 34-35 (Hanewicz); Tr. 9/13/99 at 133 (Hamad); Tr. 10/20/99 at 62\n78\n\n(Dignoti).)  A limited number of STS residents were placed in the\ncommunity through this process prior to 1997.  (See Tr. 2/4/99 at\n76; Tr. 9/27/99 (Moore) (describing the appropriation of funds for\ncommunity placement of STS residents as a “rare occurrence”).)\nHowever, the Commissioner of DMR requested no additional funding\nfor placement for class members for the fiscal years 1998 and 1999\n(Tr. 10/20/99 at 63 (Dignoti).  Instead, Commissioner O’Meara told\na  legislative  appropriations  committee  that  no  funding  for\nadditional community placement for STS residents was needed because\nhe could meet the placement needs of the few individuals who wanted\nto leave STS through opportune placements.  (Tr. 10/20/99 at 63\n(Dignoti).) \nThe Commissioner requested funding for community placement for\na total of 14 class members for the fiscal year 2000.  (Tr. 2/26/99\nat 86 (Ale).)  As noted above, at this point there was no process\nin place to gather data on IDTs’ recommendations for community\nplacement from class members’ OPSs.  Instead, the Commissioner and\nthe  STS  administration  based  their  representations  to  the\nlegislature on a one-time survey conducted in 1996 (the “Family\nSurvey”) of families and guardians of class members.  (See Pls.’\nEx. 426 (O’Meara Depo. 11/17/97 at 109); Tr. 2/26/99 at 85-86\n(Ale).)  As discussed below, the Family Survey was deeply flawed\nand should not have been relied on in this manner.  \niii. Reliance on the 1996 Family Survey and the Wish to Leave List\n79\n\nThe Family Survey consisted of a one-page questionnaire and\ncover letter that was mailed to families and guardians of STS\nresidents in May of 1996.  (Pls.’ Ex. 370.)  The cover letter\ninformed guardians and families that the purpose of the mailing was\nfor DMR to solicit their “input regarding living arrangements for\nindividuals living at STS.”  (Id.)  The questionnaire contained\nthree questions.  Question 1A asked “Would you/your relatives like\nto remain at STS?” and required an answer of either “Yes” or “No.”\nQuestion  1B  elicited  indications  of  respondents’  interest  in\nvarious living arrangements for their wards; this question asked\nrespondents to indicate, on a scale of one to five, their interest\nin placements at a “DMR Campus/Regional Center,” at a “Community\nLiving  Arrangement  or  Group  Home,”  at  a  “Supported  Living”\narrangement, and at a “Community Training Home.”  (Id.)  The survey\nprovided brief, one-sentence descriptions of each of these kinds of\nliving arrangements.  (Id.)  The survey also provided respondents\nwith an opportunity to indicate that they would like additional\ninformation  about  any  of  these  options,  or  that  they  were\ninterested in taking advantage of any of these options immediately,\nor that they would be willing to consider any of these options in\nthe  future.    (Id.)    The  third  question,  on  the  back  of  the\nquestionnaire, inquired after respondents’ “overall” interest in\n“community placement;” respondents were given the opportunity to\nindicate that they were “very interested,” “willing to look and\n80\n\nconsider,” or “not interested.”  (Id.) \nSeven  hundred  and  forty-one,  or  97%  of  the  parents  and\nguardians who responded to the survey, answered “Yes” to Question\n1A, indicating that they would like their wards to “remain at STS.”\n(Pls.’  Ex.  371.)    The  families  or  guardians  of  only  28  STS\nresidents answered “No” to this question.  (Id.)  The defendants\ninterpreted  the  responses  to  the  first  question  to  mean  that\nguardians overwhelmingly opposed community placement.    The DMR\nCommissioner seems to have relied on these results when he took the\nposition before the legislature that no funding was needed for\ncommunity placement for STS residents for a two-year period. (See\nTr. 9/13/99 at 79-80 (Hamad).) The survey results for Question 1A\nare  suspiciously  similar  to  the  figures  purporting  to  reflect\ninterest  in  community  placement  in  the  November  1996  Monthly\nManagement Report, the first such report to eliminate reference to\nthe category of guardians who were undecided but “willing to look”\ninto community placement.21\n  Twenty-four of the 28 STS residents who answered Question 1A\n21Hamad denied that the Family Survey was used to “capture\npeople’s interests in looking at community placement.”  (Tr.\n9/13/99 at 109.)  However, neither Hamad nor the defendants have\nsuggested an alternative source for the statistics in the Monthly\nManagement Reports for November 1996 and later.  Furthermore,\nMoore, who was the STS assistant directly responsible for\ncommunity placement from 1995 to 1998, testified that the Family\nSurvey was the “only formal tool [he] had” to determine how many\nSTS residents were interested in community placement.  (Tr.\n9/27/99 at 128-29.) \n81\n\nin the negative were placed on a so-called “Wish to Leave List,”\nand placements were actively sought for these individuals (Tr.\n2/26/99  at  15-17  (Ale).)    The  defendants  considered  the  class\nmembers on the Wish to Leave List to be priorities so that they\nwould  be  referred  for  opportune  placements  ahead  of  other\nresidents.  (Tr. 2/26/99 at 81-83, 85-86 (Ale); Tr. 2/11/99 at151-\n52 (Gant).)  The 14 community placements for which the Commissioner\nrequested funding for the fiscal year 2000 included placements for\nthe 10 class members remaining on this list at that point.22  (Tr.\n2/26/99 at 17, 85-86 (Ale); Tr. 9/27/99 at 97 (Moore); Pls.’ Ex.\n371.)  Moore testified that after the Family Survey, neither case\nmanagers  nor  IDTs  had  any  “direct  input”  into  the  number  of\ncommunity  placements  for  which  funding  was  requested  from  the\nlegislature.  (Tr. 9/27/99 at 129-30.)  It is therefore clear that\nO’Meara’s recommendation to the legislature had very little to do\nwith the exercise of professional judgment. \nThe Family Survey, and Question 1A in particular, was not a\nreliable indicator of whether parents and guardians would consent\nto community placement.23  The responses to Question 1B demonstrate\n22Ale testified that the remaining four placements were to be\nallocated to other class members according to demand.  (Tr.\n2/26/99 at 85-86.)\n23The defendants continued to rely on the responses to\nQuestion 1A well into the trial.  The report submitted by the\ndefendants’ expert Kevin Walsh relies in part on the fact that\n97% of the survey’s respondents answered “Yes” to Question 1A to\ndemonstrate that class members, families, and guardians were\n82\n\nthat  families  and  guardians  were  considerably  more  willing  to\nconsider community placement than was suggested by the responses to\nQuestion 1A and by the statistics subsequently reported in the\nNovember  1996  Monthly  Management  Report.    For  example,  108\nrespondents indicated that they were either “very interested” or\n“somewhat interested” in a “Community Living Arrangement or Group\nHome.”  (Pls.’ Ex. 371.)  An additional 72 respondents were “not\nsure” about this category.  (Id.)  Similarly, responses to the\nthird  question  on  the  questionnaire  indicate  that  at  least  70\nrespondents were either “very interested” in community placement or\nwere “willing to look.”24  (Pls.’ Ex. 383A.)  That the statistics\nreported  by  the  DMR  did  not  paint  a  complete  picture  of  how\nfamilies and guardians felt about community placement should have\nbeen obvious to the defendants from a comparison of the responses\nto Question 1A with the figures reported in the pre-November 1996\nMonthly Management Reports.  The defendants knew that the results\nof Question 1A did not reflect guardians’ interest in community\nplacement.  Dr. Hamad himself testified that he believes that the\nguardians of “most everyone,” including the STS Foundation, would\nbe “absolutely interested” in considering community placement for\nsatisfied with placement at STS.  (Defs’ Ex. 13B at 50.)\n24A very large number of the completed surveys show that\nrespondents originally indicated that they were “willing to look”\nbut that these responses were crossed off and changed to “not\ninterested.”  (Pls. Ex. 383A.)  The court is unaware of any\nexplanation for this surprisingly large number of changes.\n83\n\ntheir wards.  (Tr. 9/13/99 at 113-14.)\nThe Family Survey itself was misleading.  The cover letter\nexplained that families and guardians could “change [their] mind at\nany time.”  (Pls.’ Ex. 371.)  The letter did not say that the\nsurvey presented a final opportunity to consent or withhold consent\nto community placement.  The letter also explained that, if parents\nand guardians were interested in community placement, STS “would\nwork closely with the Regions to identify and take advantage of any\navailable opportunities or possibly to initiate development of a\nparticular option.”  (Pls.’ Ex. 370)  This statement suggests –\nperhaps accurately – that community placement would take place\nmainly  through  the  opportune  placement  process  and  that  any\nplacement would depend on coordination with the regions.  Families\nand guardians who were informed that placements would be developed\nspecifically  for  their  wards  might  have  been  more  willing  to\nexpress an interest in community placement.\nApart from the one-sentence descriptions, neither the survey\nnor the cover letter gave much sense of what placement options were\navailable.  This might have encouraged respondents to “play it\nsafe” by indicating that they preferred their wards to remain at\nSTS, the option with which they were most familiar.  (Tr. 4/7/99 at\n186  (Conroy).)    Expert  testimony  established  that  efforts  to\neducate guardians about community placement are often successful in\nchanging their attitudes.  (Tr. 2/11/99 at 134 (Gant); id. at 125\n84\n\n(Gant) (explaining that guardians of institutionalized wards are\ngenerally more likely to favor community placement when faced with\nconcrete options for placement than when considering the abstract\npossibility  that  their  ward  could  live  in  a  more  integrated\nsetting).)  James Conroy, one of the plaintiffs’ experts, who has\nexperience in conducting studies of deinstitutionalization, found\nthe Family Survey to be so flawed in this respect that he was\namazed that as many as 24 guardians and family members had the\n“courage” to answer “No” to the first question.  (Pls.’ Ex 423H at\n10-11 (Conroy’s Rebuttal Report).)25 \nThe Family Survey was not a substitute for the individualized\nconsideration of community placement that should have taken place\nwith  mental  health professionals, class members, families, and\nguardians at the IDT level.  The defendants’ reliance on the Family\nSurvey, together with the limits on availability of placements\n25The 1996 Family Survey may also have been tainted by its\nsimilarity and temporal proximity to a 1993 survey conducted by\nthe Home and School Association (“HSA”), after then-Governor\nWiecker announced his intention to close STS entirely.  (See Tr.\n9/27/99 at 47 (Moore); Tr. 3/2/99 at 101 (Bondy).)  The HSA, an\nindependent organization, was opposed to the closure of STS, and\nthe 1993 survey was intended to demonstrate that guardians were\nalso opposed to the idea.  The question posed in the 1993 survey\n– “I or we would like our STS relatives to remain at Southbury\nTraining School” – was almost identical to Question 1A from the\nFamily Survey.  (Tr. 3/2/99 at 109 (Bondy).)  The responses to\nthis question were almost identical as well: 95% of respondents\nto the 1993 survey answered “Yes.”  (Id.)  It is therefore\nunclear whether families and guardians would have understood\nQuestion 1A as referring to community placement, as opposed to\nrespondents’ general level of satisfaction with STS, at all.  \n85\n\nimposed by the opportune placement procedure and the failure of\nIDTs  to  systematically  consider  integrated  settings  for  class\nmembers,  effectively  precluded  the  exercise  of  professional\njudgment in determining the appropriateness of community placement\nfor most class members.  \nThe defendants’ reliance on the responses to Question 1A of\nthe Family Survey is particularly troubling with respect to the\napproximately 170 class members who are wards of the Southbury\nTraining School Foundation (“STS Foundation”).  The STS Foundation\nindicated on the Family Survey that it wished all of its wards to\nremain at STS.  (Tr. 3/2/99 at 102 (Bondy).)  The evidence reveals\nthat Anne Rotzal of the STS Foundation filled out Family Survey\nquestionnaires for all of the organizations’s wards without making\nany kind of individualized determination about whether community\npreference  was  desirable.    (See  id.  at  111  (Bondy)  (“[M]y\nunderstanding is that [Rotzal’s] reasoning went like this, I know\nwhat’s at Southbury, and I don’t know what the alternative is, so\nI’ll vote for what I know.”).) \nThe STS Foundation has in the past been “unenthusiastic” about\ncommunity placement.  (See Tr. 3/2/99 at 85-86, 117 (Bondy).)  The\nplaintiffs admitted into evidence a series of letters from 1994 and\n1995 in which Dr. Howley, who was then Director of STS, attempted\nto  address  the  STS  Foundation’s  unwillingness  to  “seriously\nconsider”  community  placements  that  had  been  recommended  for\n86\n\nparticular STS Foundation wards by case managers.  (Pls.’ Exs. 141-\n151;  Tr.  3/2/99  at  53-58  (Bondy).)    At  some  point  the  STS\nFoundation entered into a compromise agreement under which IDTs\nwould  cease  to  mention  community  placement  in  OPSs  for  STS\nFoundation wards.  (Tr. 3/2/99 at 39-41 (Bondy); Tr. 4/5/99 at 98-\n100  (Howley).)    According  to  Philip  Bondy,  Chairman  of  the\nGuardianship Committee  of  the STS Foundation, the organization\nlater began to take a more favorable view of community placement\nand  developed  various  lists  of  wards  for  whom  the  Foundation\nbelieved that community placement was appropriate.  (Id. at 78-79;\nsee also Pls.’ Ex. 141).)  However, there is no evidence that the\nFoundation ever passed this information on to STS for inclusion in\nthe Wish to Leave List.  Nor are these lists reflected in the STS\nFoundation’s responses to the Family Survey.  (Tr. 3/2/99 at 124\n(Bondy).) \nThe defendants’ reliance on the Family Survey as a substitute\nfor gathering information about community placement recommendations\nfrom IDT meetings prevented professionals from exercising their\njudgment about community placement recommendations and deprived\nclass members of the opportunity to be placed in more integrated\nsettings.  As a result, community placement of class members during\nthe period from approximately 1996 until the time of the trial was\nclearly not the result of long-term planning based on a careful\nevaluation of class members’ needs. However, the court does not\n87\n\nmean  to  suggest  that  the  defendants  are  required  to  ignore\ndecisions made by guardians.  Ninety-seven percent of class members\nlive under some form of guardianship; of these, 67% have plenary\nguardians and 33% live under a more limited form of guardianship.\n(Tr. 6/2/99 at 104 (Cole).)  Plenary guardians are “the primary\ndecision maker with respect to programs needed by [their wards] and\npolicies and practices affecting the well-being of [their wards].”\nConn. Gen. Stat. § 45a-677(i).  Limited guardians are granted a\nsimilar decision-making power “with respect to such duties assigned\nto the limited guardian by the court.”  Id. \nUnder the ADA, the defendants are under no obligation to refer\nclass members for community placement if class members wish not to\nbe  placed  in  the  community.    When  a  court  has  found  that  an\nindividual is unable to make “informed decisions about matters\nrelated to his care” and appoints a guardian, see Conn. Gen. Stat.\n§  45a-676(a-b),  then  responsibility  for  making  this  kind  of\ndecision necessarily falls to the guardian, not the individual.  It\nis  therefore  appropriate  that  STS  officials  will  not  refer  a\nresident for placement in the community without the consent of a\nguardian.26  (See, e.g., Tr. 9/13/99 at 115-17 (Hamad); Tr. 2/26/99\n26The Family Survey responses include responses from limited\nguardians who might not have the authority to withhold their\nconsent to community placement.  STS treated guardians’ responses\nin the same manner without distinguishing between different kinds\nof guardianship and without determining whether limited guardians\nhad the power to withhold this consent.  (Tr. 7/15/99 at 69-72\n(Hanewicz).)  This is an additional reason that the defendants\n88\n\nat 17-19, 67 (Ale); Tr. 3/29/99 at 68 (Martin Depo.); Tr. 3/25/99\nat 52 (Greusel).)\nThe plaintiffs dispute the notion that guardians have the\npower to withhold consent to community placement.  They argue that\n“the right to refuse appropriate community alternatives . . . rests\nwith the class member not his guardian.”  (Pls.’ Post-Trial Br. at\n144; see also id. at 118-19; Pls.’ Proposed Conclusions of Law at\n23)  The plaintiffs do not address the Connecticut guardianship\nstatutes, which give guardians the power to refuse to consent to\ncommunity placement.  Instead, they argue that, as a matter of due\nprocess,  a  state  cannot  give  guardians  a  “veto”  power  over\ncommunity placement decisions affecting their wards. \nThe cases cited by the plaintiffs in support of this argument\nare inapposite.  The majority of the cases they cite involve the\nrights of individuals with mental retardation and mental illness to\nprocedural  safeguards  at  civil  commitment  proceedings.    E.g.,\nParham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584 (1979);  Sec’y of Pub. Welfare v.\nInstitutionalized Juveniles, 442 U.S. 640, (1979); Heller v. Doe,\n509 U.S. 312 (1993); Doe v. Austin, 848 F.2d 1386 (6th Cir. 1988).\nThe plaintiffs are correct that these cases sometimes recognize\nthat the interests of guardians and wards may diverge.  See, e.g.,\nParham, 442 U.S. at 608 (holding that a child whose parents sought\nshould not have relied on the responses to the Family Survey in\ndetermining which class members would be considered for community\nplacement.\n89\n\nto have him committed to a state facility had a due process right\nto an inquiry by a “neutral fact-finder,” such as a doctor, though\nhe did not have a right to a full judicial commitment proceeding).\nHowever, the context of civil commitment should be distinguished\nfrom community placement.  The Supreme Court has recognized that\ninvoluntary commitment to an institution is “a massive curtailment\nof liberty” that requires due process protections, including the\nright to a hearing.  See Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, 491-492\n(1980).  It is for this reason that, for example, the commitment of\nan individual with mental retardation by his or her guardian is\nconsidered involuntary and requires a hearing.  See Austin, 848\nF.2d at 1392.  In contrast, community placement decisions implicate\ndue  process  in  a  much  less  drastic  manner;  there  is  no\nconstitutional right to placement in the community but, instead,\nonly a constitutional right to have professionals exercise their\njudgment  as  they  must  in  any  decision  regarding  treatment,\nprogramming  or  the  use  of  restraints  at  a  state  institution.\nSociety for Good Will, 737 F.2d at 1249.  Cases involving the\nrights of guardians and wards at civil commitment proceedings are\ntherefore inapplicable here.\nThe plaintiffs’ reference to Planned Parenthood v. Danforth,\n428 U.S. 52 (1976), a case in which the Supreme Court struck down\na parental consent requirement for abortions performed on minors,\nis similarly unpersuasive.  In holding that a requirement that all\n90\n\nminors obtain consent before undergoing an abortion was overbroad,\nthe Court in Danforth “emphasize[d] that [its] holding [did] . . .\nnot suggest that every minor, regardless of age or maturity, may\ngive effective consent for termination of her pregnancy.”  Id. at\n75 (citing Bellotti v. Baird, 428 U.S. 132 (1976)).  Even if this\ncase were applicable in the present context,27 its reasoning is\nconsistent with the kind of decisions that are made by guardians\nabout community  placement.  Under the Connecticut guardianship\nstatute,  guardians  are  only  appointed  for  individuals  who  are\ndetermined by a court to be incapable of making informed decisions.\nWards therefore fall into an exception that is analogous to the\nexception  recognized  in  Danforth.    Another  case  cited  by  the\nplaintiffs,  Milonas  v.  Williams,  691  F.2d  931,  943  (10th  Cir.\n1982), which involved parental consent to certain disciplinary\npractices at a school for youths with behavioral problems, relied\non this same reasoning from Danforth and Bellotti and is therefore\nunhelpful to the plaintiffs.\nIn Thomas S. v. Morrow, 601 F. Supp. 1055, 1060-61 (D.C.N.C.\n1984), the issue of guardians’ control over community placement\ndecisions was raised, but the court declined to rule on the issue,\nand, therefore, the plaintiffs’ reliance on the case is misplaced.\n27Bellotti, 428 U.S. at 148-50 held that consent procedure\nfor abortions were distinguishable from consent procedures for\nother kinds of medical procedures.  It would therefore most\nlikely be incorrect to apply these cases to community placement\ndecisions.  \n91\n\nId.  The issue of a so-called “guardian veto” did not arise in\nClark v. Cohen,  613 F. Supp. 684 (D.C. Pa. 1985), and so the\nplaintiffs’ citation to that case is mysterious.  The plaintiffs\nalso refer to Richard S. v. Dep’t of Developmental Servs., No. CV\n97-219 at *18 (C.D. Ca. 2000), an unpublished opinion in which the\ncourt  stated  that  it  was  “not  appropriate”  to  give  “parents,\nconservators, and other legal representatives veto authority to\noverrule . . . residents’ preferences and/or best interests.”  The\ncourt’s reasoning seems to have been based on interpretations of\nCalifornia law rather than the United States Constitution.  This\ncourt is not persuaded that the quotation is a correct statement of\nthe law applicable to this case.  Furthermore, it seems obvious\nthat guardians may, in fact, override a ward’s preferences in many\nsituations; they may do so, for example, when a ward’s preference\nis for something that is not in his or her best interest.\nHowever, the power of guardians to make decisions affecting\ntheir wards’ treatment does not excuse the defendants’ failure to\nmake community placement available or their failure to exercise\nprofessional  judgment  in  the  overwhelming  majority  of  cases.\nGuardianship  does  not  completely  divest  a  mentally  retarded\nindividual of the right to participate in decisions.  In making\ndecisions affecting the “well-being” of a ward, a guardian “must\nconsult with the ward and appropriate members of the ward’s family,\nwhere possible.”  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 45a-677(i).  See also Oller v.\n92\n\nOller-Chiang, 230 Conn. 828, 848-853 (1994) (reviewing scholarship\nabout the importance of including wards in the decision-making\nprocess and holding that a court must consider a ward’s preference\nin selecting a guardian).  Furthermore, a guardian should not be\nallowed simply to ignore the advice of medical professionals.  See\nConn. Gen. Stat. § 45a-678 (providing for the appointment of a new\nguardian where a court finds it to be in the best interest of the\nward). \nIn addition, professional standards require that the opinion\nof an individual with mental retardation be taken into account in\nmaking community placement decisions.  (Tr. 2/9/99 at 157 (Gant);\nTr.  4/7/99  at  192  (Conroy);  Pls.’  Ex.  423H  (Conroy’s  Rebuttal\nReport)  at  11.)    Conroy  testified  that  many  mentally  disabled\nindividuals like the class members are capable of indicating that\nthey have an opinion about where they wish to live.  (Tr. 4/7/99 at\n192.)  Gant estimated, based on her study of the institution, that\nbetween  80  and  100  class  members  were  interested  in  community\nplacement.  (Tr. 2/11/99 at 172.)  Ale admitted that he knew of\nclass  members  who  had  expressed  a  desire  to  be  placed  in  the\ncommunity  and  who  had  not  been  placed  because  their  guardians\nwithheld  consent      (Tr.  2/26/99  at  18-19.)    The  defendants’\nprocedures encouraged guardians to make a final decision about\ncommunity placement in their responses to the Family Survey before\nwards had an opportunity to be consulted.\n93\n\nWhen professional judgment indicates that a mentally retarded\nindividual should be placed in the community, or when such an\nindividual  wishes  to  be  placed  in  the  community,  it  may  be\nappropriate to challenge the decision of a guardian who refuses to\nconsent to community placement.  STS officials agree that it is\nappropriate to challenge a guardian who insists that his or her\nward remain at STS even after professionals have determined that\nthe ward’s needs would be better met in the community.  (See Tr.\n9/13/99 at 116 (Hamad) (“[W]e would not place someone over the\nobjection  of  the  guardian  unless  we  had  an  issue  relative  to\nmeeting that person’s needs.”); Tr. 7/14/99 at 122-24 (Hanewicz);\nTr. 3/29/99 at 70-71 (Martin Depo.); Tr. 6/1/99 at 93-94 (Foxx).)\nDMR regulations allow the agency to transfer STS residents to\nother residential settings against the wishes of guardians.  (See\nPls.’ Ex. 410 (DMR Administrative Directive 15) (providing for an\nadministrative  hearing  at  which  DMR  may  show  by  clear  and\nconvincing evidence that transfer is in the best interests of the\nresident and that the new placement “provides a greater opportunity\nfor personal development” than the resident’s current placement).)\nIn some cases, it may also be appropriate to petition a court to\nremove a guardian who refuses to consent to community placement.\nSee Conn. Gen. Stat. 45a-678.  The problem with the defendants’\npolicy is that, in cases in which the guardian’s response to the\nFamily Survey had “vetoed” community placement, the opportunity to\n94\n\nchallenge a guardian’s refusal to consent to community placement\nwould never arise because IDTs were prevented from determining\nwhether community placement was appropriate.  \nThe ADA’s preference for integrated settings is not consistent\nwith a procedure in which remaining at STS is the default option\nfor residents.  The defendants cannot establish compliance with the\nintegration mandate by showing that class members never requested\ncommunity placement.  The Supreme Court’s reasoning in Olmstead\nmakes it clear  that a state must do more than wait until the\nresidents of its facilities have affirmatively asked to be placed\nin the state’s integrated residential settings; the state’s failing\nin Olmstead was that it did not place the residents even after its\n“own professionals had determined that community-based treatment\nwould be appropriate for [the two residents] and neither woman\nopposed  such  treatment.”    Olmstead,  527  U.S.  at  603.    The\nregulations  do  not  conceive  of  a  resident’s  option  to  decline\ncommunity placement as a right that is to be exercised before any\nprofessional  judgment  has  been  brought  to  bear.    Rather,  the\nregulations state that “persons with disabilities must be provided\nthe option of declining to accept a particular accommodation.”  28\nC.F.R. pt. 35, App. A, p. 350 (1998) (emphasis added); quoted in\nOlmstead, 527 U.S. at 603.    \nAn  opportunity  to  discuss  the  possibility  of  community\nplacement with guardians could make a substantial difference in the\n95\n\nnumber  of  referrals  for  placement.    Ale  agreed  that  “the\navailability of resources is extraordinarily important in working\nwith parents and educating them about the benefits of community\nplacement.”  (Tr. 2/26/99 at 94; see also Tr. 4/6/99 at 95-96\n(Moore).  Richard Foxx, one of the defendants’ experts, testified\nthat he believes the role of the IDT is to make recommendations to\nwhich  guardians  should  listen  before  making  a  decision  about\ncommunity placement or any other aspect of a ward’s treatment.\n(Tr. 6/1/99 at 93-94.)  By concluding from the results of the\nFamily Survey that there is no demand for community placements, the\ndefendants may have prevented guardians and families from making\ninformed choices. \nThere is a significant difference between, on one hand, a\nprocedure in which a guardian’s response to a somewhat misleading\nquestion on a survey determines whether or not the ward will ever\nbe considered for community placement and, on the other hand, a\nprocess  in  which  guardians  are  allowed  to  consider  community\nplacement  during  an  IDT  meeting  at  which  the  guardian  has  an\nopportunity to consult with professionals and with the ward.  The\nformer procedure deprives class members of their constitutional\nright to the exercise of professional judgment and undermines the\nintegration  mandate  of  the  ADA  and  Section  504.    The  latter\nprocedure appears to the court to be consistent with these laws and\ndoes not interfere with a guardian’s right to withhold consent.\n96\n\n The evidence shows that the defendants have not reached a\nsatisfactory balance between respecting the rights of guardians to\nwithhold consent for community placement and the requirements that\nstate  officials  exercise  professional  judgment  in  considering\ncommunity placement and that they give effect to the integration\nmandate of the ADA and Section 504.28  The defendants should not\nhave waited until a resident or guardian affirmatively asked for\ncommunity placement.  They should have given class members and\ntheir guardians  an  opportunity to consider community placement\nbefore declining the option.  Instead, the defendants failed to\ndiscuss community placement at IDT meetings.  They failed to gather\ninformation about the number of class members for whom community\nplacement was appropriate.  Having failed to learn how many class\nmembers could or should be placed in the community, the defendants\nfailed to develop resources for placing class members.  Instead,\nthe defendant Commissioner of DMR told the legislature that there\n28Another example of the defendants’ deference to guardians\nis Mulvey’s explanation that IDTs were instructed to cease\nmentioning community placement on OPSs because the STS\nadministrations wanted to avoid conflicts between guardians who\nopposed community placement and members of the IDTs who\nrecommended community placement.  (Pls.’ Ex. 426 (Mulvey 2/9/98\nDepo. at 76); Tr. 3/30/99 at 136-37 (Mulvey).)  This explanation\nis undermined by the fact that the Monthly Management Reports\nissued before November 1996 indicated that there were some 285\nclass members whose families and guardians were relatively open-\nminded about community placement.  It is difficult to believe\nthat these family members and guardians would find themselves in\nconflict with a case manager who inquired about their preference\nfor community placement.  Mulvey’s explanation also demonstrates\nan unwillingness to comply with the integration mandate.  \n97\n\nwas no demand for community placement.  Class members, or at least\nclass members who were not included on the Wish to Leave List, were\nthus deprived of the right to have a professional determine whether\nit would be appropriate to place them in a more integrated setting.\niii. Community Placement Under EMPOWER\nIn May 1999, after the plaintiffs’ case in chief was complete,\nDMR issued a document in which it set forth its policy on community\nplacement for STS residents.  This document (Pls. Ex. 1132) was\ntitled “Expanding  Meaningful Placement Options With Equity and\nRespect: Refining and Enhancing the ‘Choice’ Model for Residential\nPlacement, Support, and Service Decision-Making for STS Residents”\nand is commonly referred to as “EMPOWER.”  The EMPOWER policy\napplies solely to STS residents.  (Tr. 9/27/99 at 133 (Moore).)\nThe timing of the issuance of this document suggests that the\npromulgation of the EMPOWER policy was at least in part a response\nto criticism of the community placement procedures at STS by the\nplaintiffs and Special Master Ferleger.  See Report to the Court\nNo. 7: Community Placement: A Preliminary Study, U.S. v. Conn.\n(Feb. 23, 1999).  Moore admitted that the document was created in\nrecognition of the fact that the Family Survey was three years old\nat that point.  (Tr. 9/27/99 at 182.)\nEMPOWER is premised on a model of “choice;” the policy assumes\nthat “[a]ny person with mental retardation . . . may be served in\nany  setting  –  any  site  –  as  long  as  appropriate  supports  and\n98\n\nservices are available.”  (Pls.’ Ex 1132.)  The defendants have\nindicated that, under the policy, limitations on resources will not\nrestrict placement of class members in the community.  (Tr. 9/27/99\nat 74 (Moore);  Tr. 10/21/99 at 42 (Sterns).)  As part of the\nEMPOWER  policy,  the  defendants  have  established  a  “community\nreserve fund” which is intended to function as a third way, in\naddition  to  opportune  placement  and  appropriations  from  the\nlegislature, to fund placements for STS residents.  (Tr. 9/27/99 at\n74-78 (Moore). \nEMPOWER is intended to implement a “continuous assessment of\nchoice”  to  determine  class  members  and  guardians’  interest  in\ncommunity  placement.      Under  the  policy,  each  guardian  is  to\nreceive a “Quarterly Assessment of Choice” form which asks, “Do you\nwant the Department to actively pursue and plan an alternative\nplacement  for  [the  STS  resident]?”    (Pls.’  Exs.  663,  1132.)\nGuardians may answer “Yes” or “No” to this question.  (Pls’ Ex.\n1132.)  This question must also be posed to guardians at each IDT\nmeeting, and, if the guardian is not present at the meeting, the\nguardian can be contacted by telephone or mail.  (Pls.’ Ex. 663;\nTr. 9/27/99 at 150, 176 (Moore).)  The guardian may respond before,\nduring or after the IDT meeting.  (Tr. 7/15/99 at 50 (Hanewicz).)\nThe guardian’s response is then included in the resident’s OPS.\n(Pls.’ Ex. 663.)\nEMPOWER requires IDTs to consider community placement only\n99\n\nwhen guardians answer ‘Yes.”  (7/15/99 at 55-56 (Hanewicz); Tr.\n9/27/99 at 141-42, 172-73 (Moore).)  The policy states that “as a\ngeneral  rule,  alternative  residential  placements,  supports  and\nservices shall be actively pursued and planned when the resident or\nhis or her guardian, as appropriate, chooses to pursue and plan\nsuch alternatives.”  (Pls.’ Ex. 1132.)  However, residents whose\nguardians have not answered “Yes” to the quarterly form may still\nbe considered for opportune placements as they arise.  (Tr. 7/15/99\nat 55-56 (Hanewicz).)  The purported reasoning behind a procedure\nin which consideration of community placement may only be initiated\nby a guardian’s request is that IDTs should not “need to engage in\nan  unnecessary  assessment  process  to  determine  who  may  be\n‘eligible’ or ‘ready’ for [community placement] because all STS\nresidents are ‘eligible’ and ‘ready.’” (Id.)  The policy requires\nthat STS attempt to override a guardian’s choice only when the IDT\nfinds that placement at STS is not meeting the resident’s needs, or\nwhen there is a conflict between the guardian and the resident.\n(Id.; Pls’ Ex. 663.)  When STS recommends placement in either of\nthese scenarios, a guardian may challenge the decision through an\nadministrative process or in court under Conn. Gen. Stat. § 17a-\n210.29  (Pls. Exs. 663, 1132.)\nAccording to the compiled responses to Quarterly Assessment of\n29Conn. Gen. Stat. § 17a-210 provides for procedures to\nchallenge the decision by the DMR Commissioner to transfer an\nindividual from one state facility to another. \n100\n\nChoice  forms  that  were  admitted  into  evidence  at  trial,  28\nguardians indicated that they wished to actively pursue community\nplacement.  (Pls’ Proposed Findings at 220.)  It is therefore\napparent that community placement is being considered for some\nadditional  class  members  than  was  the  case  under  the  old\nprocedures.  In many ways, EMPOWER appears to conform more closely\nwith  the  requirements  of  the  due  process  and  the  integration\nmandate  than  previous  procedures.    EMPOWER  makes  community\nplacement resources more readily available, though as of the time\nof trial the usefulness of the Community Resources Fund had yet to\nbe  tested.    The  defendants  have  implemented  a  somewhat  more\nreliable  system  for  ascertaining  guardians’  choices  regarding\ncommunity placement.  Because the process of assessing choice is\nintended to be continuous, class members are less likely to be\ntotally deprived of the opportunity to have a professional exercise\njudgment about his or her possible placement in the community.30\nThe plaintiffs object to the EMPOWER policy because it allows\nIDTs to refrain from considering community placement for all class\n30The court notes that some class members seem again to have\nbeen arbitrarily deprived of this opportunity.  Examination of\nthe compiled Quarterly Assessment of Choice forms indicates that\ncase managers sometimes completed the forms without consulting\nguardians.  For example, the form for William B. indicates that\nDMR is not to actively pursue community placement even though the\ncase manager explains that she was unable to reach William’s\nguardian.  (Pls.’ Ex. 1134; see also Quarterly Assessment of\nChoice forms for Wendy C. and Anthony D.)  Case managers should\nnot treat “No” as the default answer to the Quarterly Assessment\nof Choice. \n101\n\nmembers whose guardians do not answer “Yes” to the single question\nposed by the Quarterly Assessment form.  (Pls.’ Post-Trial Br. at\n129-30.)  As discussed above, the plaintiffs are incorrect insofar\nas  they  claim  that  allowing  guardians  to  make  choices  about\ncommunity placement always constitutes a denial of due process.\nMany of the responses to the Quarterly Assessment of Choice forms\nindicate  that  guardians  are  adamantly  opposed  to  community\nplacement and feel that their wards are happy and receive excellent\ncare and programming at STS.  (E.g., Pls.’ Ex 1134 (Quarterly\nAssessment of Choice for Helen G.).)  Assuming that a professional\nhas considered community placement and has not determined that the\nguardian’s perception is inaccurate, STS has no duty to attempt to\noverride the guardian’s decision in a case such as this.    \nHowever,  the  court  is  concerned,  for  example,  about  what\nhappens after a guardian checks “No” on the form even though he or\nshe is somewhat open to considering placement.  Many guardians\nindicated on their Quarterly Assessment of Choice forms that they\ndid not want to “actively” pursue community placement but also\nindicated in the “Comments” section of the form that they would\nconsider community placement if an opportunity arose. (Pls.’ Ex.\n1134; see, e.g. Quarterly Assessment of Choice for Catherine A.)\nThe plaintiffs claim that out of 693 completed forms there were 34\nsuch responses.  (Pls.’ Proposed Findings at 513 ¶ 220.)  There\ncould well be additional guardians with similar feelings who failed\n102\n\nto note their willingness to consider community placement on the\nforms.  The wards of these guardians should not be deprived of an\nopportunity for an IDT to consider whether community placement\nwould be appropriate for them. \nFurthermore, a number of responses also indicate that some\nguardians are not familiar with what resources would be available\nfor  their  wards  in  a  community  placement.    For  example,  the\nguardian for Thomas D. answered “No” to the Quarterly Assessment\nquestion but then indicated that she would consider a community\nplacement if “it would have everything STS has, including 24 hour\nmedical care.”  (Pls.’ Ex. 1134.)  Similarly, Sandra G.’s guardian\nanswered “No” and indicated that “placement can only be allowed if\nit meets Sandra’s specific need.”  (Id.)  The guardian for Richard\nD. said that “there was no reason to develop another home” but that\nshe  would  “consider  alternatives  if  presented  and  they  offer\nRichard  an  improvement  from  what  he  has  now.”    (Id.)    It  is\npossible  that  guardians  like  these  would  consent  to  community\nplacement should they be presented with a concrete opportunity.\nFurthermore,  guardians  can  choose  not  to  have  IDTs  consider\ncommunity placement even without being present at the IDT meeting.\nAs a result there is a danger that guardians who are not involved\nin their wards lives will select “No” on the Quarterly Assessment\nof Choice without seriously considering community placement, thus\ndepriving their wards of the opportunity for professional judgment\n103\n\nto be exercised.31\nAs discussed above, a policy of failing to consider community\nplacement unless a guardian affirmatively requests it violates the\nintegration mandate.  Such a procedure also prevents IDTs from\nexercising professional judgment in determining whether the class\nmember could benefit from community placement.  DMR policy, which\nrequires that the OPS process focus on integrating residents into\n“normalized  settings”  and  into  “less  restrictive  program\nalternatives” (Pls.’ Ex. 401 (DMR 11-4)), would suggest that the\n31The court is particularly concerned about what information\nis available to guardians and families in light of some of the\ncompleted Quarterly Assessment of Choice forms contained in\nPlaintiffs’ Exhibit 1132.  Two of these forms are identical to\nthe usual forms except that they contain an additional note that\nreads\nHOME & SCHOOL ASSOC. NOTE: This is the new form STS is\nasking guardians to sign – If you say yes to actively\npursue alternative placement your name goes on a\nplacement list.  DMR sets aside money and a home is\ndeveloped for the resident – But you don’t know who the\nprovider will be, what supports are available or what\nservices the person will receive.\n(Pls.’ Ex. 1132 (Quarterly Assessments of Choice for Mary B. H\nand Alec M.W.).)  This note would discourage many guardians from\nanswering yes to the question on the form.  Moore testified that\nthe note was misleading and that he did not know how or why these\nforms were sent to guardians.  (Tr. 9/27/99 at 177-81.)  One\npossibility is that the Home and School Association mailed this\nversion of the form to guardians and that the guardians for these\ntwo class members returned this version to STS instead of the\nofficial version.  In any event, there is a grave danger that\nguardians who receive forms like this did not make an informed\nchoice.  The danger of uninformed choices would be diminished if\nIDTs had a practice of considering community placement in every\ncase and, if appropriate, discussing options with guardians and\ntheir wards.  \n104\n\nprofessionals on IDTs should raise the issue of community placement\nfor all class members, and in particular for those class members\nwhose guardians are undecided about the idea of placing their wards\nin the community.  (See also Pls. Ex. 663 (letter of April 15,\n1999) (explaining to guardians that community placement will be\n“formally discuss[ed] within the [IDT] process”).)  However, the\nEMPOWER policy allows IDTs to refrain from considering community\nplacement for these class members.  Thus, the court is unable to\nconclude  that  the  EMPOWER  policy  satisfies  Youngberg  or  the\nintegration mandates of Title II and Section 504.  The court sees\nno reason why STS professionals should not be required to consider\nthe appropriateness of community placement in every case.  See,\ne.g., Thomas S., 902 F.2d at 254 (approving of the actions of the\ndistrict court in “set[ting] up a process in which the [community\nplacement]  needs  of  each  class  member  will  be  evaluated  by\nprofessionals on a case-by-case basis.”) Once professional judgment\nhas been exercised, residents and their guardians may choose to\ndecline the option.  \nIt  is  conceivable  that  opportune  placements  are  now\nsufficiently numerous to allow IDTs to present concrete placement\noptions  for  the  consideration  of  guardians  who  are  open  to\nplacement.  Hanewicz testified that, as of July 15, 1999, five\nguardians  who  had  checked  “No”  on  the  Quarterly  Assessment  of\nChoice were actively considering opportune community placements.\n105\n\n(Tr. 7/15/99 at 59.)  However, the court does not have sufficient\ninformation  about  how  many  placement  opportunities  are  made\navailable to residents whose guardians have answered “No” on the\nQuarterly Assessment of Choice.  The EMPOWER policy was new when\nevidence about it was presented, and, therefore, the court is not\nin a position to determine the extent to which it has corrected for\nthe deficiencies in the old community placement procedures. \nFinally, there is an additional reason to be concerned about\nwhether the EMPOWER policy has cured all of the deficiencies in the\ncommunity placement procedures at STS.  Administrators at STS who\nwere responsible for creating and implementing EMPOWER testified\nthat it is not a new policy but, rather, that it reflected polices\nand practices that had been in place at STS for years.  (Tr.\n9/27/99  at  127  (Moore);  Tr.  7/14/99  at  105-6  (Hanewicz);  Tr.\n7/15/99 at 39 (Hanewicz).)  Given that the old community placement\nprocedures at STS were inadequate under both the constitution and\nthe statutory integration mandates, it is hardly encouraging that\nSTS officials believe that the situation has not changed.\nThe  court  cannot  conclude  that  the  defendants’  community\nplacement procedures have come into compliance with the law. \niv. Discrimination on the Basis of Disability  \nThe plaintiffs claim to have established that the defendants\ndiscriminated on the basis of disability by refusing to consider\nseverely retarded class members for community placement.  (Pls.’\n106\n\nPost-Trial Brief at 137-39.)  \nIn the fiscal year 1995-96, 78% percent of class members were\neither  severely  or  profoundly  retarded.  (Pls.’  Ex.  423C  at  34\n(Gant’s Report).)  In the same fiscal year, 65% percent of the\nplacements made out of STS were of severely or profoundly retarded\nclass members.  (Id.)  In the following fiscal year, 50% of the\nplacements  made  were  of  severely  or  profoundly  retarded  class\nmembers.  (Id.) The plaintiffs claim that these numbers show that\nSTS  placed  class  members  with  severe  disabilities  at\ndisproportionately lower rates than class members with less severe\ndisabilities.  (Pls’ Post-Trial Br. at 139) However, Gant based\nthese calculations on a very small number of actual placements:\naccording to her, in fiscal year 1995-96 only 18 STS residents were\nplaced, and in fiscal year 1996-97 there were only 12 placements.\n(Pls.’ Ex. 423C at 37.)   The court cannot conclude, based on this\nsmall sample size, that defendants have discriminated on the basis\nof severity of disability.  \nThe  defendants  have  no  obligation  under  the  ADA  to  place\nseverely disabled individuals at the same rates as they place less\nseverely disabled individuals.  The defendants are obligated only\nto consider severely disabled class members for placement, just as\nthey do less severely disabled individuals, and cannot discriminate\nsolely on the basis of severity of disability.  See Messier, 1999\nWL 20910 at * 10.  The defendants did indeed consider severely and\n107\n\nprofoundly retarded class members for community placement.  In\nfact, the majority of the referrals for community placement have\nbeen STS residents with severe disabilities.  (Tr. 2/12/99 at 71\n(Gant).)  The evidence indicates that the defendants generally\nfailed to exercise professional judgment in considering community\nplacement for a large number of class members regardless of the\ndegree of their disability, but the plaintiffs have not established\nthat the defendants failed to consider more severely disabled class\nmembers for community placement.  \nHowever, the plaintiffs have established that many severely\nand profoundly retarded class members referred for placement were\nnot successfully placed in the community.  In the fiscal year 1995-\n96, only 16% of the STS residents labeled severely retarded who\nwere  referred  for  placement  were  successfully  placed  in  the\ncommunity.  (Pls.’ Ex. 423C at 36 (Gant’s Report).)  In the same\nfiscal year, only 36% of those labeled profoundly retarded and\nreferred for placement were successfully placed in the community.32\n(Id.)\n  Gant  concluded  that  the  failure  to  place  so  many  of the\n32In their Post-Trial Brief , the plaintiffs confuse some of\nthe figures reported by Gant.  The plaintiffs claim, for example,\nthat in the fiscal year 1995-96 “only 16% of the class members\nlabeled severely retarded were referred and only 36% of those\nlabeled profound were placed.”  (Pls.’ Post-Trial Br. at 139\n(emphasis added).)  The plaintiffs thus incorrectly suggest that\nthese numbers demonstrate a failure even to consider placing\nseverely retarded individuals in the community.    \n108\n\nseverely and profoundly retarded individuals who were referred was\na result of a lack of available placement opportunities.  (Pls.’\nEx. 423C at 35-37.)  The difficulty in placing severely disabled\nindividuals appears to have been the result of the “opportune”\nsystem of placement in conjunction with the failure on the part of\nthe  DMR  to  develop  additional  placement  resources  that  were\nsuitable for class members for whom placement is appropriate.  (See\nTr. 2/26/99 at 117-18 (Ale) (testifying that he found it difficult\nto  place  senior  residents  and  residents  with  “psychosocial\nproblems” because the resources needed to provide services to these\nresidents in a community setting are not in place).)  DMR failed in\nparticular  to  provide  placements  for  severely  disabled  class\nmembers.  For example, there was a shortage of placements for\nindividuals  with  multiple  handicaps,  maladaptive  behavior\nconditions,  and  other  medical  problems.    (Tr.  2/30/99  at  134\n(Mulvey); Tr. 2/11/99 at 131-32 (Gant); Tr. 3/2/99 at 55 (Bondy).)\nThe defendants’ failure to provide resources for class members with\nmore severe handicaps constitutes discrimination within the meaning\nof the ADA and Section 504.  Jackson v. Fort Stanton Hosp. and\nTraining  Sch.,  757  F.  Supp.  1243,  1299  (D.N.M.  1990)  (finding\ndiscrimination  on  the  basis  of  severity  of  disability  where\n“severely  handicapped  residents  are  precluded  from  living  in\ncommunity settings because the programs lack amenities, that could\nreasonably  be  furnished  without  substantial  program  changes,\n109\n\nnecessary to accommodate the needs of the severely handicapped”),\nrev’d on other grounds, 964 F.2d 980 (10th Cir. 1992).\nThe defendants have attempted to correct for the inadequate\ncommunity  placement  resources.    Under  the  EMPOWER  policy,  the\ndefendants have committed themselves to making resources available\nfor  class  members  who  wish  to  be  placed  in  more  integrated\nsettings.    However,  the  EMPOWER  policy  had  only  recently  been\nimplemented at the close of the trial in this case, and the court\nis therefore unable to determine whether or not the defendants have\nceased to discriminate on the basis of severity of disability. \nv. Fundamental Alteration Defense\nThe defendants argue that the remedy sought by the plaintiffs\nwould constitute a fundamental alteration of Connecticut’s programs\nfor  the  mentally  disabled.    (Def.’s  Post-Trial  Br.  at  24.)\nSpecifically, the defendants claim that the remedy sought would\nentail a “massive movement of money from STS to community programs”\nand would require a “gigantic appropriation of funds.”  (Id. at 24-\n25.)\nThe defendants’ characterization of the remedy sought by the\nplaintiffs is misleading since what is at stake in this case is\nsomewhat limited.  The court has previously stated that, to the\nextent that the plaintiffs seek “to end all admissions to STS,\ntransfer all residents to community settings or otherwise shut down\nSTS, this court has effectively narrowed the complaint, as mandated\n110\n\nby prevailing precedent, to exclude any such relief.”  (Ruling on\nMotion to Intervene (March 7, 1996) at 4 (Doc. No. 78.)  Based on\nthis narrow reading of the relief sought, it is unlikely that\n“massive” or “gigantic” changes will be required as a result of\nordering  the  defendants  to  exercise  professional  judgment  in\nconsidering  whether  class  members  are  qualified  for  community\nplacement and ordering them to make reasonable modifications to\nConnecticut’s programs in order to make placement possible in cases\nwhere it is appropriate.\nFurthermore, the evidence does not support the defendants’\nfundamental alteration defense.  The defendants have not presented\nevidence that allocating the resources needed to place qualified\nclass  members  in  the  community  would  result  in  a  fundamental\nalteration.  To the contrary, the EMPOWER document issued by the\ndefendant DMR, claims that “Connecticut has developed one of the\nfinest community service systems in the nation.”  (Pls Ex. 1132.)\nIn  the  document,  the  DMR  claims  that  the  community  placement\nprogram in Connecticut is continuing to grow.  (Id.)  Even when the\ndocument was issued in May 1999, “[r]esidential placement, support\nand services [were] available in an array of program models” and\ncommunity placement options were already “many, varied and real.”\n(Id.)  The DMR’s fundamental alteration claim in this case is\nentirely  inconsistent  with  its  public  commitment  to  further\nenhancing a system of community placement programming which, it\n111\n\nclaims, was already robust in early 1999.\nThe  defendants  argue  that  they  cannot,  under  the  ADA,  be\nrequired to create entirely new programs for the disabled.  (See\nDefs.’ Post-Trial Br. 26 (quoting Rodriguez v. City of New York,\n197 F.3d 611, 619 (2d Cir. 1999).)  The defendants do not explain,\nhowever, why fulfilling their obligation under the ADA to properly\nassess whether class members should be placed in the community\nwould necessitate the creation of new programs.  It is clear from\nthe evidence that, where appropriate, community placement could be\nachieved through existing programs.  Placing class members in the\ncommunity might result in some additional expense to the state,\nbut, as discussed above, courts have held that minimal additional\nexpense incurred as a result of a defendant’s compliance with the\nintegration  mandate  does  not,  alone,  support  a  fundamental\nalteration defense.  The defendants therefore have not met their\nburden of establishing this affirmative defense.\nCONCLUSION AND ORDER\nThe  plaintiffs’  request  for  injunctive  relief  to  remedy\nalleged  constitutional  and  statutory  violations  relating  to\nconditions, services and programs at STS is moot as resolved by the\nactions taken in United States v. Connecticut, No. 3:86-cv-252 (D.\nConn. 1986).\nThe plaintiffs have established that the defendants, as of the\ntime of the trial in this case, had failed adequately to provide\n112\n\nfor the evaluation of all class members for community placement and\nhad failed to place in the community class members for whom such\nplacement was found to be appropriate by the defendants’ treatment\nprofessionals and who had consented to or requested such placement\neither through their guardians or, where appropriate, themselves.\nAccordingly, to ensure the fashioning of an appropriate remedy\nfor addressing the deficiencies found, the court will conduct a\nstatus conference on June 13, 2008, at 11 a.m., to establish a\nschedule for a hearing on the issue of remedy at which hearing the\ndefendants shall present data as to placements made by them since\nthe date of the trial and procedures to be implemented to assure\nplacements are made in the future where appropriate.  Participation\nin the conference may be by telephone if requested.  \nSO ORDERED.\n   /s/                     \nELLEN BREE BURNS\nSENIOR U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE\nDated at New Haven, Connecticut this 4th day of June, 2008.\n111133",

This class action litigation was brought in 1994 seeking injunctive relief\nfor alleged constitutional and statutory violations relating to the conditions, services and\nprograms at STS, as well as the continued placement of residents there.  The plaintiffs ultimately\nprevailed on their claims relating to community placement.  \nFollowing a 123-day bench trial in 1999, the Court ruled that the defendants -- who are\nSTS, the Director of STS and the Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Mental\nRetardation -- had deprived class members of their procedural due process and statutory rights to\nprofessional judgment regarding the appropriateness of individual placements in a more\nintegrated setting (\"community placement\"), as well as their statutory right to be free of\n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1146   Filed 01/23/13   Page 2 of 23\ndiscrimination with respect to having such placements made.  Messier v. Southbury Training\nSch., 562 F. Supp. 2d 294, 338-39, 343-44 (D. Conn. 2008).  The plaintiffs did not prevail on\nany of their other claims, principally because those claims were moot by reason of the then-\nongoing litigation in United States v. Connecticut, No. 3:86-cv-252 (D. Conn. 1986)\n(“Connecticut litigation”).  Messier, 562 F. Supp. 2d at 303-04.  Based on the Court's finding of\nliability on the plaintiffs' community placement claims, the parties reached a settlement on the\nissue of remedies, which required \"the defendants to fully address the violations of rights of class\nmembers that the Court identified in its decision on the merits.\"  Order Re: Approval &\nImplemen't of Settl't Agreem't [doc. # 1054] at 13.  The instant motion for attorneys' fees, costs\nand expenses followed.  By agreement of the parties, this ruling is limited to addressing a\nspecific subset of the attorneys' fees component of that motion:  the \"degree of success\" the\nplaintiffs achieved in the litigation.  The Court will address the other part of the attorneys' fees\ncomponent -- i.e., calculation of the lodestar -- as well as the costs and expenses components in a\nsubsequent ruling.\nAs discussed, infra, the plaintiffs maintain that their \"degree of success\" was excellent,\ni.e., that they obtained \"excellent results\" and so are entitled to a full award of attorneys' fees. \nThe defendants, on the other hand, contend that the plaintiffs' award should be significantly\nreduced because they succeeded on only a fraction of their claims.  For the reasons that follow,\nthe Court finds that the plaintiffs achieved \"excellent results\" with respect to the claims on which\nthey prevailed (i.e., the community placement claims), but, because those claims are both\nfactually and legally distinct from the plaintiffs' unsuccessful claims (i.e., medical care,\nprotection and habilitation), the lodestar calculation must be limited to the time the plaintiffs'\n2\n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1146   Filed 01/23/13   Page 3 of 23\ncounsel expended on the successful claims.  That is, the plaintiffs are not entitled to an award of\nfees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with their unsuccessful claims.\nDISCUSSION\nI.  The Plaintiffs' Prevailing Party Status\nA plaintiff in a civil rights case may recover attorneys' fees pursuant to, inter alia, 42\nU.S.C. § 19881 if he or she is a \"prevailing party . . . [that is,] one who achieves a material\nalteration of the legal relationship of the parties . . . [through] a judicially sanctioned change.\" \nGrievson v. Rochester Psychiatric Cent., 746 F. Supp. 2d 454, 460 (W.D.N.Y. 2010) (quoting\nBuckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep't of Health & Human Res., 532 U.S. 598,\n604 (2001)).  In this case the Court ruled that \"the defendants . . . had failed . . . [both] to provide\nfor the evaluation of all class members for community placement and had failed to place in the\ncommunity class members for whom such placement was found to be appropriate . . . .\" \nMessier, 562 F. Supp. 2d at 345.  Even though the plaintiffs did not prevail on their claims\nalleging constitutional and statutory violations relating to medical care, protection and\nhabilitation, the plaintiffs nevertheless meet § 1988's threshold requirement by virtue of the\nCourt's finding of liability on the issue of community placement and the Settlement Agreement's\nprovision requiring the defendants to take remedial action in that regard.  See Farrar v. Hobby,\n1 The plaintiffs base their motion for attorneys' fees, costs and expenses on two additional\nfee-shifting statutes: 42 U.S.C.A. § 12205 and 29 U.S.C. § 794a(b).  These statutes pertain\nspecifically to their ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, respectively.  See Pls.' Mem. in Supp.\n[doc. # 1067] at 15-16.  Because fee-shifting statutes generally contain similar key language, the\ncase law pertaining to what constitutes a reasonable fee applies uniformly to them all.  See\nPerdue v. Kenny A., 130 S.Ct. 1662, 1671 n.3 (2010); Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc., v.\nW. Va. Dep't of Health & Human Res., 532 U.S. 598, 603, n.4 (2001) (citing  Hensley v.\nEckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433, n.7 (1983)).  Thus, for purposes of this ruling, the Court cites only\nto § 1988.\n3\n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1146   Filed 01/23/13   Page 4 of 23\n506 U.S. 103, 111-12 (1992) (stating that a civil rights plaintiff \"prevails\" when, inter alia, the\nrelief obtained in the litigation requires the defendant to modify its behavior in a way that\ndirectly benefits the plaintiff).\nII.  Calculating the Amount of the Attorneys' Fees Award\nHaving found that the plaintiffs meet the threshold statutory requirement for an award of\nattorneys' fees, the Court must determine what fee is \"reasonable.\"  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461\nU.S. 424, 433 (1983); see also LeBlanc-Sternberg v. Fletcher, 143 F.3d 748, 757 (2d Cir. 1998)\n(\"The question of whether a plaintiff is a 'prevailing party' . . . is separate from the question of\nthe degree to which the plaintiff prevailed.\").  Hensley instructs that \"[t]he most useful starting\npoint for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended\non the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.\"  Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433.  This\ncalculation is otherwise known as the lodestar figure.  See Perdue v. Kenny A., 130 S.Ct. 1662,\n1672 (2010) (reaffirming use of the \"lodestar method\" post-Arbor Hill Concerned Citizens\nNeighborhood Assn. v. County of Albany, 522 F.3d 182, 190 (2d Cir. 2008), which proposed use\nof a modified method it termed the \"presumptively reasonable fee\" in place of lodestar).2  But\nwhere, as here, \"a plaintiff is deemed 'prevailing' even though he succeeded on only some of his\nclaims,\" the Court may make downward adjustments to the lodestar figure -- principally by\nconsidering the \"results obtained\" in the litigation -- in order to arrive at a reasonable fee.\n2 The plaintiffs at times make reference to use of the \"Johnson factors\" in place of, or in\naddition to, the lodestar approach as a method for determining the fee award.  See Johnson v.\nGeorgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717-719 (5th Cir. 1974).  But as the Supreme\nCourt recently reaffirmed in Perdue, the lodestar calculation displaced Johnson in the federal\ncourts some time ago.  Perdue, 130 S.Ct. at 1671-72.  This Court's prior rulings in this case\nreflect the same.  See Order Re: Pending Mots. [doc. # 1099]; Ruling Re: The Legal Standard for\nCalculating Attorneys' Fees [doc. # 1124].\n4\n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1146   Filed 01/23/13   Page 5 of 23\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 434.  As previously stated, the Court will make the lodestar calculation in a\nsubsequent ruling.  But first it must address the downward adjustment question by determining\nwhat \"degree of success\" is reflected in the \"results obtained\" by the plaintiffs.  In other words,\nthe Court must first decide whether the plaintiffs achieved \"excellent results.\"\nA.  The \"Results Obtained\"\nIn order to make the \"results obtained\" determination, Hensley instructs the Court to\naddress \"two questions.\"  Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434.  \"First, did the plaintiff fail to prevail on\nclaims that were unrelated to the claims on which he succeeded?\"  Id.  \"Second, did the plaintiff\nachieve a level of success that makes the hours reasonably expended [on the litigation as whole]\na satisfactory basis for making a fee award?\"  Id.  As discussed below, the Court answers both\nquestions \"yes.\"  \n1.  Relatedness of the Unsuccessful Claims to the Successful Ones\nAnswering the first Hensley question requires the Court to determine if any of the\nplaintiffs' unsuccessful claims were related to the successful ones.  Because § 1988 only\nauthorizes attorneys' fees to prevailing parties, no fee may be awarded for unsuccessful claims\nthat are not related to the successful ones.  Instead, any unrelated claims must be \"treated as if\nthey had been raised in separate lawsuits\" and so must be disregarded for the purpose of the fee\ncalculation.  Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435; Quaratino v. Tiffany & Co., 166 F.3d 422, 425 (2d Cir.\n1999) (stating that courts should subtract any hours dedicated to severable unsuccessful claims).\nHere, the plaintiffs' three-count complaint alleged that the defendants:  (1) violated the\nclass members' Fourteenth Amendment Due Process rights by failing to provide them with\nadequate medical care, protection from harm, habilitation and community placement (\"Count\n5\n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1146   Filed 01/23/13   Page 6 of 23\nI\");3 (2) discriminated against the class members in violation of Title II of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (1997), and Section 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973 (\"Section 504\"), 29 U.S.C. § 794 (1997) (\"Count II\"); and (3) failed\nto provide the class members with \"active treatment\" as required by Title XIX of the Social\nSecurity Act (\"SSA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1396a et seq. (\"Count III\").4  As the Court previously\ndetermined, these three counts fall into four subject areas:  (1) medical care; (2) failure to\nprotect; (3) habilitation/active treatment;5 and (4) community placement.  Messier, 562 F. Supp.\n2d at 303.  As noted, the Court found the defendants liable only on the community placement\nclaims.  Id. at 304, 313, 319, 345 (finding that the other three claims were either moot as\nresolved by the actions taken in the Connecticut litigation or without merit).\nThe question now is whether the three unsuccessful claims (pertaining to medical care,\nprotection and habilitation) are related to the plaintiffs' successful community placement claims,\n3 Count I of the complaint only cites the Fourteenth Amendment as the source of the\nplaintiffs' due process claims.  It does not reference, as is common with respect to such claims,\n42 U.S.C. § 1983, which is one of the enumerated actions for which attorneys' fees may be\nawarded under § 1988.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1988 (2000).  Nevertheless, since such Fourteenth\nAmendment claims are virtually synonymous with § 1983, and because excluding the successful\nclaims in Count I on this basis would not change the result (as those claims are nevertheless\nrelated to the claims in Count II, see infra pp. 15-17), nor have the defendants raised an objection\non this ground, the Court construes Count I as implicitly invoking § 1983 and thus coming\nwithin the explicit ambit of § 1988.\n4 The last section of the plaintiffs' complaint, entitled \"Relief,\" is merely another iteration\nof the claims for relief the plaintiffs make in Counts I-III; thus, for purposes of this ruling, the\nCourt does not give them additional, separate consideration.  The one exception to this is the\nplaintiffs' demand for class certification.  See infra n.9.\n5 Generally speaking, habilitation refers to teaching and training a person with significant\ndisabilities to function as fully and as independently as possible.  Pls.' Prop. Findings of Fact\n[doc. # 497] at ¶ 262.  Active treatment refers to a specific, customized habilitation regimen.  Id.\nat ¶ 264.  For purposes of this ruling, the Court uses the term habilitation to refer to both.\n6\n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1146   Filed 01/23/13   Page 7 of 23\n\"such that [counsel's] time spent on the failed claims [substantively overlaps with time spent on\nthe winning claims and thus] should be compensated.\"  Tatum v. City of New York, No.\n06CV4290, 2010 WL 334975, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 28, 2010) (internal quotations and citations\nomitted).\nUnder Hensely, claims for relief, even when brought against the same defendant, are not\nrelated if they are based on different facts and different legal theories.  Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434-\n35; see also Green v. Torres, 361 F.3d 96, 98 (2d Cir. 2004).  As discussed below, based on the\nfacts and legal theories in this case, the plaintiffs' unsuccessful claims cannot be deemed related\nto the successful community placement claims because they were based on different factual\nproof and legal theories.  Accordingly, for purposes of calculating the lodestar amount, the hours\nexpended by the plaintiffs' counsel on the unsuccessful medical care, protection and habilitation\nclaims are severable and thus will be disregarded.  See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434-35; see also\nGreen, 361 F.3d at 98.\na.  The unsuccessful claims do not share a common core of facts with the \n     successful claims\nA claim is related to another claim if it is based on a common core of facts.  Hensley, 461\nU.S. at 434-35.  Here, the four subject areas, which, broadly speaking, challenged and sought\nremedies for alleged deficiencies at STS, were each based on different facts and required\ndifferent proof.\nFor instance, the plaintiffs' claims that STS provided inadequate medical care was\nsupported by various factual allegations including that STS personnel had used DNR orders that\nhad been written for class members for whom death was not imminent.  For example, the\nevidence showed that the file of one patient contained a DNR order written six years before her\n7\n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1146   Filed 01/23/13   Page 8 of 23\ndeath, and the file of another patient contained a DNR order written two years prior to her death. \nMessier, 562 F. Supp. 2d at 308-09.  The plaintiffs also adduced evidence showing that the\ndefendants improperly used DNR orders to withhold nutrition, fluids and treatment, such as a\nbronchoscopy, allegedly causing the deaths of at least two STS residents.  Id. at 308-12.6\nIn contrast, the plaintiffs' allegations that the defendants failed to protect class members\nfrom physical harm and unnecessarily restrained them were drawn from an altogether different\nset of facts.  For example, in support of this claim they cited to an incident where an STS staff\nmember left residents unattended on a bus, which allegedly led one STS resident to punch and\nfracture the nose of another resident, and to another incident where a STS resident was weaned\noff \"one-to-one staffing\" by being secluded in a \"separation room\" on more than 100 occasions\nin three months without proper authorization.\nStill another set of facts supported their habilitation claims.  In this regard, the plaintiffs\nalleged that \"[STS residents] receiv[ed] little attention from staff, and rarely interact[ed] with\nanyone other than a paid staff member,\" that \"[m]ost of the[ ] [residents'] time is 'dead time,'\" and\nthat the habilitation at STS was \"meaningless\" and failed \"to support [residents] toward\nindependence.\"  These assertions were buttressed by various factual examples, including that, in\none instance, \"music activity . . . consisted [merely] of seven residents watching a music\nvideotape\" and, in another instance, that \"the staff donned gloves, went from resident to resident\nand brushed their teeth right out in the open.\"\n6 In addition to their allegations regarding DNR orders, the plaintiffs also asserted that\nmedical care at STS was inadequate due to, inter alia, lack of planning and poor administration\nof medication, infection control and nursing services.  See Pls.' Post-Trial Br. [doc. # 832] at 69-\n188.\n8\n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1146   Filed 01/23/13   Page 9 of 23\nIn connection with the community placement claims, the plaintiffs drew from still a\ndifferent set of facts, which demonstrated that STS lacked a \"formal mechanism for considering\ncommunity placement for class members.\"  Messier, 562 F. Supp. 2d at 328.  In particular, the\nevidence supporting the community placement claims included various statements and statistical\ninformation gleaned from STS reports and testimony of STS officials, which demonstrated that\nSTS had failed to exercise professional judgment regarding community placement.  See id. at\n325-42.  Other factual evidence the plaintiffs proffered with respect to the community placement\nclaims included STS's defective \"opportune placement process\" and its use of a flawed 1996\nquestionnaire mailed to the parents and guardians of STS residents, as well as factual evidence\nshowing that the defendants had instructed the Interdisciplinary Teams (\"IDTs\") not to discuss\ncommunity placement during team meetings and to cease making references to community\nplacement in the Overall Plan of Service (\"OPS\").  Id. at 329, 331-34, 338-39.  \nNot only did the four subject areas fail to share a common core of underlying facts, the\nevidence pertaining to the three unsuccessful claims was of a different character than the\nevidence required for the successful claims.  While the plaintiffs offered evidence consisting of\nindividual patient information and conditions at STS, in support of their claims of inadequate\nmedical care, failure to protect and lack of habilitation, they used mostly statistical data and\ninstitutional and departmental records to show the nature of the STS residents' confinement in\norder to prove the community placement claims.  Thus, even if conditions at STS were as the\nplaintiffs claimed, community placement (as opposed to, say, remediation of the conditions or\ntransfer of residents to another institution) would not have been mandated because such\ncommunity placement must be medically appropriate for and personally desired by each\n9\n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1146   Filed 01/23/13   Page 10 of 23\nindividual.7  The converse is also true.  Had the plaintiffs relied solely on the facts supporting the\ncommunity placement claims, the Court would not have been persuaded to find the defendants\nliable on the medical care, protection and habilitation claims since even an outright refusal by the\ndefendants to consider community placement of medically eligible and willing STS residents,\nabsent other evidence, would have proved little, if anything, about the institutional conditions at\nSTS.8  Accordingly, because the unsuccessful claims were largely predicated on factual evidence\nthat was different in kind and character from the evidence on which the successful claims were\npredicated, the unsuccessful claims are severable from the community placement claims.  Cf.\nSerrichio v. Wachovia Sec., LLC, 706 F. Supp. 2d 237, 260-61 (D. Conn. 2010) (finding\n7 This point is further illustrated by the ADA's integration mandate, which expresses a\npreference for community placement even when other institutional conditions (i.e., medical care,\nprotection and habilitation) are as they should be.  See Messier, 562 F. Supp. 2d at 326.  As the\nCourt noted in its liability ruling, \"STS is not an integrated setting.\"  Id.  Thus, even if proper\nmedical care were being provided by an institution like STS, and its residents were properly\nprotected and habilitated, the integration mandate would still require community placement (or\nthe closest thing to it) whenever medically appropriate and consented to by the resident.  See id. \nIn other words, the statute on which the plaintiffs based some of their community placement\nclaims presupposes that community placement is independent of other institutional conditions. \nAccord Soc'y for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, 902 F.2d 1085, 1087, 1090-91\n(2d Cir. 1990) (reaffirming that \"community placement . . . cannot be justified as a remedy to\ncorrect [ ] unconstitutional conditions found at [state-operated school for the mentally retarded]\")\n(emphasis added).\n8 Given these distinctions, and as further explained, infra p. 14, the Court rejects the\nplaintiffs' implication that the \"conditions\" claims constitute an alternative legal ground for the\ncommunity placement claims.  For a claim to be an alternative legal ground of another claim,\nsome factual or legal relatedness between the claims is presupposed.  See Hensley, 461 U.S. at\n435.  But for the reasons given, supra pp. 7-10 and infra pp. 11-17, the \"conditions\" claims are\nneither factually nor legally related to the community placement claims.  Thus, the Court's\ndecision to disregard the time that counsel for the plaintiffs spent on the \"conditions\" claims does\nnot contravene Hensley's proviso that the plaintiffs may \"in good faith [ ] raise alternative legal\ngrounds for a desired outcome, and the court's rejection of or failure to reach certain grounds is\nnot a sufficient reason for reducing a fee.\"  Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435.\n10\n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1146   Filed 01/23/13   Page 11 of 23\nplaintiff's unsuccessful state law claims were not severable as they were \"largely predicated on\"\nsome of the same facts underlying his successful claims).\nFurther underscoring the severability of the unsuccessful claims from the community\nplacement claims is the Court's finding early in this litigation that almost all of the plaintiffs'\nclaims pertaining to medical care, protection and habilitation were moot as a result of the\nConnecticut litigation.  The Court's mootness finding was premised on the conclusion that the\nunsuccessful claims shared a common core of facts with the issues in that other litigation, which\ninvolved the conditions at STS.  See Messier, 562 F. Supp. 2d at 303.  The community\nplacement claims, however, as they arose from different facts, were not mooted.  Were the\ncommunity placement claims based on the same core of facts as the plaintiffs' unsuccessful\nclaims -- as the plaintiffs now contend -- the Court likely would have found that they too were\nmooted by the Connecticut litigation, with the result that the plaintiffs would have prevailed on\nnone of the claims in this litigation, and, under Hensley, would not be entitled to any fees, costs\nor expenses.  \nThe one thread of factual commonality among the plaintiffs' claims is that each subject\narea alleged a different way in which the defendants failed to act.  Commonality at such a broad\nlevel, however, is too tenuous a connection to justify awarding attorneys' fees on the\nunsuccessful claims.  As noted, under Hensley, fees are awarded for time spent by counsel on\nunsuccessful claims only when such claims are inextricably intertwined with a prevailing claim\nso that counsel's time is presumed to have overlapped between the two -- making it, as courts\nhave noted, an exercise in futility to try to separate out the legal services rendered as to each\nclaim.  E.g., Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435; Munson v. Milwaukee Bd. of Sch. Dirs., 969 F.2d 266,\n11\n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1146   Filed 01/23/13   Page 12 of 23\n272 (7th Cir. 1992).  But factual claims pertaining to the different ways in which a defendant\nfailed to act -- which is what the plaintiffs alleged -- does not, without more, marry otherwise\nseparate facts, at least not for Hensley purposes.  For example, if an employee were to bring a\nsingle suit against her employer for both a slip and fall in the office lobby and a hostile work\nenvironment arising from her supervisor's continued sexual advances, the employer's implicit\nfailure to act in each instance would not mean the two claims arose from a common core of facts,\neven though all of the claims involve, in some sense, the employer's failure to act.\nFor similar reasons, the fact that the Court certified the plaintiffs as a class pursuant to\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2) does not mean that the plaintiffs' unsuccessful\nclaims are factually related to the community placement claims.  Among its prerequisites, Rule\n23 requires \"questions of law or fact common to the class\" and a showing that \"the party\nopposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class.\"  Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 23(a) & (b)(2) (emphasis added).  But whether questions of law or fact are common or\napply generally to a class says nothing of the commonality of law or fact underlying each\nsubstantive claim.  Thus, drawing on the previous example, a group of employees alleging\nmultiple instances of slip and falls and sexual harassment might obtain class certification and\nyet, absent additional, specific evidence, their underlying claims would not, per se, be factually\nrelated for Hensley purposes, i.e., the slip and falls still would arise from different factual and\nlegal allegations than the sexual harassment claims.  See, e.g., Freid v. Nat'l Action Fin. Servs.,\nInc., No. 10-2870 (ES)(CLW), 2011 WL 6934845, at *4 (D.N.J. Dec. 29, 2011) (finding that the\nlodestar amount could be reduced where the underlying substantive claim, on which the\nindividual plaintiff succeeded, was not sufficiently intertwined with his unsuccessful effort to\n12\n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1146   Filed 01/23/13   Page 13 of 23\nachieve class action certification since certification of a class under Rule 23 is a separate\nquestion from the substantive merits of a case; that is, \"a putative class must first be certified\nbefore the merits of the class action claims can be reached\").9\nBased on the foregoing, it is clear that the plaintiffs relied on wholly different facts --\ndifferent in both type and character -- to challenge the conditions and services at STS as opposed\nto the defendants' practices with regard to community placement.  The plaintiffs' assertion that\nproof of the alleged deficient conditions at STS was necessary to demonstrate that \"community\nplacement is an appropriate option for STS residents,\" is not correct, and, in any event, does not\nalone provide the requisite factual relatedness for purposes of awarding attorneys' fees.  As\nnoted, the plaintiffs' success on the community placement claims -- despite the Court's refusal to\nadjudicate virtually any of the claims relating to medical care, protection and habilitation --\ndemonstrates that the unsuccessful claims were not factual predicates of the community\n9 The defendants make a separate but related assertion:  that \"certification of a class is not\nsubstantive relief . . . and so should not be considered an area in which the [p]laintiffs prevailed\nfor purposes of awarding attorneys' fees.\"  This argument is unavailing.  While the defendants\nare correct that class certification is not a substantive claim, it is nevertheless clear that the\nplaintiffs used class certification as a method of pursuing relief on all of their claims.  See O'Neal\nv. City of Seattle, 66 F.3d 1064, 1069 (9th Cir. 1995) (\"motion [for class certification]. . . not a\nseparate claim, but rather a method for pursuing [the] ultimately successful claims\").  That class\ncertification might have tangentially benefitted the unsuccessful claims as well, see Messier v.\nSouthbury Training Sch., 183 F.R.D. 350 (D. Conn. 1998) (ruling on motion to opt out), does not\nnecessarily mean that counsel's time must be reduced for its work in this area; after all, such time\nwas expended on a successful claim.  Moreover, since the plaintiffs qualify as \"prevailing\nparties,\" the catalyst theory rejected by the Supreme Court is not implicated here either.  See\nBuckhannon, 532 U.S. at 602-10.  Thus, it is only if the defendants are able to identify specific\nblocks of time pertaining solely to class certification and one or more of the unsuccessful claims\nthat the Court will deduct time, on the rationale that such time \"cannot [then] be deemed to have\nbeen 'expended in pursuit of the ultimate result achieved.'\"  Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435.  The\ndefendants may identify and raise objections to any such blocks of time in the subsequent\nlodestar calculation phase.  See infra pp. 22-23.  The plaintiffs may respond if the defendants\nidentify any such time; otherwise, the plaintiffs should not address this issue.  \n13\n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1146   Filed 01/23/13   Page 14 of 23\nplacement claims.  See supra p. 11 & n.7.  And, although parts of the defendants' deposition and\ntrial testimonies state, in effect, that consideration of community placement had been\ndiscontinued at STS because the defendants believed that the same level of care was not\navailable in the community (thereby, according to the plaintiffs, putting the conditions at STS in\ndispute), this does not by itself mean that there was any significant overlap of the plaintiffs'\ncounsel's time and effort between the winning and losing claims.  A review of the complaint and\nthe overall record clearly shows that counsel for the plaintiffs intended and pursued medical\ncare, protection and habilitation as claims in their own right.  Thus, for the reasons stated, and\nbecause the plaintiffs have not demonstrated otherwise,10 the Court finds that the plaintiffs'\nunsuccessful claims concerning medical care, protection and habilitation are not factually related\nto the community placement claims.  The Court must now determine whether any of the\nunsuccessful claims were based on a legal theory that was related to the legal theory on which\nthe community placement claims were based.  See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435; Green v. Torres,\n10 That is, the plaintiffs have not shown -- especially given the factual differences the\nCourt has highlighted between the winning and losing claims in this case -- that courts have\ngenerally and necessarily found in this context that claims for medical care, protection and\nhabilitation arise from the same core of facts as the community placement claims.  Cf. Parrish v.\nSollecito, 280 F. Supp. 2d 145, 172 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (citing cases and awarding attorneys' fees\nbased on district courts having regularly found that unsuccessful sexual harassment\ndiscrimination claims are sufficiently related to retaliation claims to warrant inclusion of time\nspent on both for attorneys' fees purposes); Garrity v. Sununu, 752 F.2d 727, 734-35 (1st Cir.\n1984) (holding, based on specific claims made by plaintiffs in the underlying case, Garrity v.\nGallen, 522 F.Supp. 171, (D.N.H. 1981), in which plaintiffs lost on community placement claims\nbut succeeded on some claims relating to institutional conditions, and which involved more\nexpansive -- but not necessarily warranted -- reading of plaintiffs' § 504 claims (compare 752\nF.2d at 734-35, with 522 F.Supp. at 209-10, 213-15), that district court \"could reasonably find\"\nunsuccessful community placement claims were related to successful conditions claims for fee\naward purposes) (emphasis added).\n14\n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1146   Filed 01/23/13   Page 15 of 23\n361 F.3d at 98.\nb.  The unsuccessful claims were not based on a related legal theory\nClaims can also be related if they are based on a similar legal theory.  See Hensley, 461\nU.S. at 435; Green v. Torres, 361 F.3d at 98.  A legal theory is the principle on which a litigant\nbases or proceeds with its claims.  Black's Law Dictionary 907 (7th ed. 1999).  Here, the\nplaintiffs' complaint avers:  (1) denial of Fourteenth Amendment Due Process (Count I); \n(2) unlawful discrimination pertaining to community placement in violation of the ADA and\nSection 504 (Count II); and (3) failure to habilitate as required by the SSA (Count III).  Each\ncount references separate constitutional or statutory provisions and relates to one or more of the\naforementioned subject areas:  medical care, protection, habilitation and community placement. \nAs noted, the plaintiffs prevailed on the community placement claims alleged in both Counts I\nand II.  But because Count I also contains due process claims relating to the unsuccessful subject\nareas, the Court must determine whether this means that the community placement claims in\nCount I are based on a similar due process legal theory as the unsuccessful claims in that count.11\ni.)  The due process claims in Count I\nIn Count I, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants deprived class members of their\nFourteenth Amendment Due Process rights with respect to medical care, protection, habilitation\n11 Counts II and III do not possess this hybrid nature.  That is, the claims asserted in\nCount II deal only with community placement and violations of the ADA and § 504, and the\nclaims asserted in Count III deal only with habilitation and violations of the SSA.  The Court\nnotes that while the word \"programs\" in Count II and subparts (e) and (f) of Count III could be\nviewed, in the most general sense, as implicating habilitation and community placement,\nrespectively, the substance of the plaintiffs' arguments and assertions during the pendency of this\ncase did not reflect that in any meaningful way.  The plaintiffs did not advance a legal theory\nconnecting community placement with the other subject areas, and the Court did not interpret\nCounts II and III in this manner, either.  See, e.g., Messier, 562 F. Supp. 2d at 298-99.\n15\n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1146   Filed 01/23/13   Page 16 of 23\nand community placement.  While Count I only asserted a general denial of due process, the\nCourt construed it as advancing claims for violations of both substantive and procedural due\nprocess.  See Messier, 562 F. Supp. 2d at 298.  The Court found that while residents of a state-\noperated institution for the mentally disabled have a substantive due process right to medical\ncare, protection and habilitation, they do not have a substantive due process right to community\nplacement.  Id. at 300, 319.  Rather, community placement is subject to due process scrutiny only\nto the extent that \"the decision to keep a resident in an institution [rather than] placing the\nresident in a community setting must be 'a rational decision based on professional judgment.'\" \nId. at 319.  In other words, a decision to keep a mentally disabled individual in an institution may\nbe attacked on procedural due process grounds, but not substantive ones.  Because procedural\nand substantive due process are very different12 it cannot be said that the community placement\nclaims in Count I are based on a similar legal theory as the unsuccessful claims, which assert\nsubstantive due process violations.  Due process does not constitute a single legal theory so\nmuch as a platform from which a litigant may trigger liability by asserting and proving certain\n12 The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment has both a procedural and a\nsubstantive component.  See, e.g., Collins v. City of Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 125 (1992). \nProcedural due process ensures that the government utilizes \"fair procedure[s] in connection\nwith any deprivation of life, liberty, or property by a State.\"  Id.  Substantive due process, on the\nother hand, \"forbids the government to infringe certain 'fundamental' liberty interests . . . no\nmatter what process is provided, unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a\ncompelling state interest.\"  Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 302 (1993) (citing Collins, 503 U.S. at\n125).  Moreover, \"the fundamental interests that [ ] have been viewed as implicitly protected by\nthe Constitution,\" and which implicate substantive due process, are not generally viewed to be\nthe same ones that implicate procedural due process.  See Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing,\n474 U.S. 214, 229-30 (1985) (Powell, J.,concurring); Smith v. Twp. of East Greenwich, 519 F.\nSupp. 2d 493, 502 (D.N.J. 2007) (recognizing that \"while property rights for procedural due\nprocess purposes are created by state law, substantive due process rights are created by the\nConstitution”) (citing cases).  \n16\n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1146   Filed 01/23/13   Page 17 of 23\nother factual and legal claims.  See County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 850-51\n(1998).  Indeed, absent some additional and independent commonality, different claims alleging\ndenial of due process, even of the same type, are not correctly characterized as being based on a\nsimilar legal theory because the inherent fluidity of due process renders \"[t]hat which may, in\none setting, constitute a denial [of due process], . . . in other circumstances, and in light of other\nconsiderations, [cause it to] fall short of such denial.\"  Id. at 850.\nFor these reasons, it cannot be said that the plaintiffs' unsuccessful claims in Count I are\nbased on a similar legal theory as the successful community placement claims.  Due process is\ntoo fluid a concept to provide the requisite relatedness for Hensley purposes.  \n2.  The Degree of Success Achieved on the Successful Claims\nThe next step is to analyze the degree of success the plaintiffs obtained with regard to\ntheir successful community placement claims.  Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435, 440.  Ascertaining the\n\"degree of success\" requires the Court to compare the \"results obtained\" by the plaintiffs with the\nscope of \"the litigation as a whole.\"  Id.  Effectively, the Court must construct a fraction:  if\ncomparison of the \"results obtained\" with \"the litigation as a whole\" yields \"excellent results,\"\n(i.e., a fraction equaling a percent near 100), then the plaintiffs \"should recover a fully\ncompensatory fee.\"  Id. at 435.  But if the comparison shows that the results obtained were\nlimited, the amount of the fee should be reduced.  Id.  The plaintiffs’ failure to prevail on \"every\ncontention\" or \"alternative legal ground[ ],\" however, is not a sufficient reason for reducing the\nfee.  The results are what matter.13 \n13 The Court notes that utilizing a fraction for purposes of determining whether an\nadjustment to the lodestar is required, as opposed to the amount of the adjustment, does not\nviolate the rule against strict proportionality.  See Lunday v. City of Albany, 42 F.3d 131, 134-\n17\n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1146   Filed 01/23/13   Page 18 of 23\na.  Comparison of the \"results obtained\" with \"the litigation as a whole\"\nThe results obtained in this litigation are the finding that the defendants failed to provide\nfor the evaluation of all class members for community placement and they failed to place in the\ncommunity class members for whom such placement was appropriate.14  Messier, 562 F. Supp.\n2d at 345.  While this is not the exact result the plaintiffs sought to achieve -- community\nplacements for all class members -- it is sufficient relief to qualify them as a prevailing party. \nThe question now is whether the results obtained are almost the same as the results the plaintiffs\nsought in \"the litigation as a whole.\"  Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435, 440.  In other words, the Court\nmust determine if there is an appreciable difference between what the plaintiffs sought and what\nthey achieved so that a fully compensatory fee for all time expended in \"the litigation as a\nwhole\" is not excessive, i.e., whether the degree of success is close to 100% and as such may be\nfound to constitute \"excellent results.\"  \nAfter discarding the severable claims pursuant to the first Hensley question, the\ncommunity placement claims constitute \"the litigation as a whole.\"  This serves as the\ndenominator in the \"degree of success\" fraction.  The \"results obtained\" on the community\nplacement claims serves as the numerator.  Id.  If the resulting fraction is close to 100, the results\nare considered \"excellent.\"  See supra n.13.\n35 (2d Cir. 1994) (rejecting contention that lodestar amount should have been reduced by a\nspecific percentage to reflect plaintiff's limited success at trial on rationale that the Second\nCircuit has consistently resisted strict proportionality of this kind in civil rights cases, but\nreaffirming that \"determination of whether such a lodestar adjustment need be made is left\nlargely to the discretion of the trial court\") (emphasis added).  \n14 Based on the Court's liability ruling, the parties reached a settlement agreement that\nrequires the defendants to take specific, remedial actions.  But see infra n.18.\n18\n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1146   Filed 01/23/13   Page 19 of 23\ni.)  The \"results obtained\" in Count I\nThe parts of Count I pertaining to community placement consist of subparagraphs (e), (f),\nand (g).  In subparagraph (e) the plaintiffs asked \"to have community placements that are\nintegrated in society.\"  (Emphasis added.)  In subparagraph (g) the plaintiffs asked \"to have\ncommunity placements provided when . . . transfer to the community is necessary to protect\nclassmembers' [sic] rights . . . .\"  (Emphasis added.)  With regard to these two subparagraphs, the\nCourt ruled only that the defendants must evaluate all class members for community placement\nand, thus, strictly speaking, the results \"actually obtained\" are not identical to the results sought. \nOn the other hand, with regard to subparagraph (f), the result sought -- that all community\nplacement decisions be made on an individual basis and implemented in accordance with the\nrecommendations of placement teams -- corresponds closely with the results obtained.  In sum,\nthe Court concludes that as to the community placement claims in Count I, the results obtained,\nwhile not identical, closely correlate with the results sought.\nii.)  The \"results obtained\" in Count II\nThe plaintiffs also sought community placement as relief for the unlawful discrimination\nalleged in Count II (alleging that the defendants have violated class members' rights \"[b]y failing\nto provide residents of [STS] the opportunity to receive state support in the community . . . and\nby failing to provide the most severely handicapped residents of [STS] with the same\nopportunity to benefit from programs and community living . . . .\").  In connection with this\ncount the Court found that the defendants had engaged in discrimination because they \"failed to\nplace in the community class members for whom such placement was found to be appropriate \n19\n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1146   Filed 01/23/13   Page 20 of 23\n. . . .\"  Id. at 345.  Thus, the plaintiffs achieved the precise results they sought in Count II.15\nb.  Does the comparison yield \"excellent results\"?\nAfter concluding that the \"results obtained\" by the plaintiffs differ only in a minor degree\nfrom the results they sought \"in the litigation as a whole,\" the Court must now determine whether\nthat difference is nevertheless appreciable enough to preclude a finding of \"excellent results,\"\nconsidering both the quantity and the quality of the results.  See Barfield v. N.Y. City Health and\nHosps. Corp., 537 F.3d 132, 151-52 (2d Cir. 2008).  As an initial matter, however, the Court\nmust affix a meaning to the term “excellent.”  Neither the case law nor either party provides a\nspecialized definition.  As such, the Court must use its common meaning.  Stenberg v. Carhart,\n530 U.S. 914, 993 n.9 (2000) (recognizing that undefined terms are construed in accordance with\ntheir ordinary and plain meaning).  Webster's Dictionary defines \"excellent\" as \"near the\nstandard or model,\" which is to say almost but not exactly perfect.16  Webster's New International\nDictionary 888 (William A. Nielsen et al. eds., 2d ed. 1960).  In other words, \"excellent results\"\nare achieved when the \"fraction\" is close to, but not precisely, 100.\nFrom a purely quantitative standpoint one might say that the results obtained by the\nplaintiffs fall short of excellent since they did not wholly succeed on the community placement\nclaims.  But qualitatively the results obtained are a near-proxy for community placement.  As the\nCourt noted in its liability ruling, the exercise of professional judgment is but one of three factors\n15 Proof of discrimination in this context does not require a showing of unequal treatment\nof similarly situated individuals, but only a showing that class members who were referred for\ncommunity placement were not in fact so placed.  Messier, 562 F. Supp. 2d at 321, 343.\n16 Webster's defines \"perfect\" as \"conforming completely to . . . [a] standard . . . flawless \n. . . [i.e., 100%.]\"  Id. at 1817.\n20\n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1146   Filed 01/23/13   Page 21 of 23\nthat must be considered in deciding the appropriateness of community placement; the other two\nbeing medical appropriateness and consent of the STS resident, both of which were beyond the\nscope of relief that could be ordered by the Court.17  See Messier, 562 F. Supp. 2d at 319, 323,\n326.  Nevertheless, because of the results obtained in the litigation, STS residents are now\nensured that they will receive community placements when, in the exercise of professional\njudgment, such placement is deemed to be both medically appropriate and desired.  This result is\nfar different from the situation that existed prior to the litigation.  Id. at 327 (finding that \"[m]ost\nOPS documents produced after 1996 do not indicate that IDTs ever made individualized\ncommunity placement decisions or recommendations\").  \nThus, not only is the exercise of professional judgment a necessary component of and\nantecedent to community placement, the assurance that such judgment will be exercised on\nbehalf of all class members is all that the plaintiffs could have achieved in the litigation since the\ntwo other requirements for community placement are outside the scope of relief available from\nthe Court.  Accordingly, although the results are not per se the precise relief the plaintiffs sought\n\"in the litigation as whole,\" the results are the maximal relief the plaintiffs could have been\nawarded under the circumstances.  Hence, the results obtained constitute \"excellent results.\" 18 \n17 For these purposes, the Court treats professional judgment as an additional factor since\nmedical appropriateness and consent, though required, may not necessarily be sufficient for\ncommunity placement in all circumstances.\n18 To this end, the plaintiffs urge the Court to consider the Settlement Agreement and\nrelated interim progress reports submitted by the Remedial Expert as independent, additional\nevidence of the \"excellent results\" they obtained.  But the Settlement Agreement and progress\nreports simply implement the Court's liability ruling; they do not, and cannot, provide additional\nbases of relief.  See Order Re: Approval & Implemen't of Settl't Agreem't [doc. # 1054] at 13\n(stating that \"the settlement agreement requires the defendants to fully address the violations of\nthe rights of class members that the Court identified in its decision of the merits\").  Thus, while\n21\n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1146   Filed 01/23/13   Page 22 of 23\nSee Barfield, 537 F.3d at 152 (reaffirming that \"'the most critical factor' in a district court's\ndetermination of what constitutes reasonable attorney's fees . . . 'is the degree of success\nobtained' by the plaintiff\" and that \"[a] district court's assessment of the 'degree of success'\nachieved . . . is not limited to inquiring whether a plaintiff prevailed on individual claims . . .\n[rather] [b]oth 'the quantity and quality of relief obtained[ ]' . . . are key factors in . . . 'assessment\nof what is a reasonable fee under the circumstances of the case’”) (internal citations omitted).  \nFor these reasons, the Court finds the defendants have not sustained their burden of\nproving that the results obtained by the plaintiffs cannot be deemed excellent because they\nobtained only a fraction of the relief they sought in the complaint.  Indeed, that assertion is not\nonly factually incorrect, but is contrary to the logic and teaching of the Supreme Court in\nHensley.  Consistent with Hensley, the Court has disregarded the plaintiffs' severable claims and\nhas deemed the scope of the \"litigation as a whole\" to be comprised only of the community\nplacement claims.  And, pursuant to Hensley's second prong, the Court has compared the \"results\nobtained\" (i.e., the requirement that the defendants employ professional judgment to evaluate the\nappropriateness of community placement for all class members and to place in the community\nthe class members for whom such placement is appropriate) with the results sought in \"the\nlitigation as a whole\" (i.e., community placement for all class members).  Based on that\ncomparison, the Court has concluded that the plaintiffs obtained all the relief that could\nappropriately be awarded and thus achieved \"excellent results.\"  See U.S. Football League v.\nNat'l Football League, 887 F.2d 408, 413 (2d Cir. 1989) (noting that the party advocating a\nthe Court GRANTS the plaintiffs' Motion to Supplement Reply [doc. # 1127], doing so does not\nchange the result.  Accordingly, the defendants' related Motion in Limine to Exclude [doc. #\n1130] and the plaintiffs' Motion to Strike [doc. # 1144] are both DENIED.\n22\n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1146   Filed 01/23/13   Page 23 of 23\nreduction in the calculation of attorneys' fees bears the burden of proof).\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the plaintiffs obtained \"excellent results\"\nwith respect to the claims on which they prevailed (i.e., the community placement claims). \nBecause those claims are both factually and legally distinct from the plaintiffs' unsuccessful\nclaims (i.e., medical care, protection and habilitation), calculation of the lodestar shall be limited\nto the time expended by the plaintiffs' counsel on the successful claims (i.e., community\nplacement), with no fees awarded for the time the plaintiffs' counsel expended on the severable\nclaims.\nA scheduling order shall be issued setting forth the final steps in this litigation.\nSO ORDERED.\n/s/                                                                         \nELLEN BREE BURNS\nSENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\nDated this 22nd day of January, 2013 at New Haven, Connecticut.  \n23",

No. 3 :94-CV-1706(EBB) \nv. \nSOUTHBURY TRAINING SCHOOL  May 25,2010 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nINTRODUCTION \nThis Settlement Agreement is created to address the Memorandum of \nDecision and Order issued by the Court in this case on June 5, 2008. The \nSettlement Agreement consists of five components: ( 1) The Framework \nstatements of purpose, principle and policy which were developed by the \nparties to this case; (2) Benchmarks - the objective and measureable \nactivities and obligations of the Defendants which are the substance of the \nremedy requested by the Court; (3) The Role of Remedial Expert- an \nindividual mutually selected by the parties to facilitate and monitor \nimplementation of the benchmarks, to have a primary role in dispute \nresolution, and to serve a \"gatekeeper\" function related to any future \nnecessity of Court involvement or intervention; ( 4) Jurisdiction and Sunset; \nand ( 5) Attorneys' Fees and Costs - establishing a process to reach \nagreement of decision based upon the Memorandum ofD  ecision and Order. \nI.  THE FRAMEWORK \nA. Purpose \nThe purpose of this Settlement Agreement is to assure that the \ndepartment and its staff commit that each class member has the opportunity \nto have an assessment of the supports that would be needed to live \nsuccessfully in a community setting; to assure that the class member, \nguardian, involved family member, or other personal representative, has \nsufficient information to make an informed decision about the merits of \ncommunity placement to meet the particular needs of the class member \nincluding the status of programs and services at STS and to ensure that \n1 \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1036-1   Filed 07/12/10   Page 2 of 7\ninformation will be provided to each class member and his/her guardian to \nenable them to make an informed choice as to an integrated setting and \ntransition to an appropriate community setting within a reasonable time after \nprofessional judgment has been exercised by the IDT. It is recognized that \nthe ultimate decision about residence rests with the guardian unless the \ndepartment believes that this legal representative is not making decisions in \nthe best interest of the class member. \nB. Policy \nThe department shall discontinue the use of the policy EMPOWER, to \nguide community transition decisions for STS residents. The use of the \nquarterly assessment of choice shall also be discontinued. \nAll current policies in the area ofLevel of need (LON) assessment, \nIndividual Plan (IP) planning, case management, safeguards, guardian \ninvolvement, portability, placement planning and transition activities apply \nto all class members who reside at STS. Once a class member transfers to a \ncommunity setting, which is not an ICFIMR, all DDS waiver policies, \nprocedures and guidelines are applicable. The only additional procedure to \nbe issued by the department, in accordance with this Settlement Agreement, \nwill articulate the department's commitment to professional judgment being \nrendered by each team for each STS class member, including \nrecommendations for a \"most integrated setting\" as appropriate to class \nmember needs. The team will assure the active involvement of class \nmembers, guardians, advocates, and other personal representatives, and will \nschedule meetings at convenient times and locations to encourage such \nparticipation. \nThe Defendants will transition class members to the most integrated \nsetting, in accordance with the professional judgment exercised by the IDT, \nwith individualized support services, provided the class member and \nguardian, as applicable, makes an informed choice not to oppose such \ndetermination. For purposes of this agreement the \"most integrated setting\" \nis defined as \"a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to interact \nwith non-disabled persons to the fullest extent possible.\"  28 C.F.R. pt. 35 \napp. A at page 571 (2009); Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 592.  Parties acknowledge \nand accept the Court's finding that STS is a segregated institution. Messier \nv. Southbury Training School, 562 F. Supp. 2d 294, 326 (D. Conn. 2008). \n2 \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1036-1   Filed 07/12/10   Page 3 of 7\nC. Professional Judgment \nDDS will assure that professional judgment is made by each \nInterdisciplinary Team (IDT) as to the most integrated setting appropriate to \nmeet the needs of each class member. When the team determines that \ncommunity services and supports can reasonably meet the needs of the class \nmember, and is the most integrated setting, this recommendation will be \nmade in the OPS (IP) and will be discussed with the guardian and the class \nmember at the IDT meeting and documented in the OPS (IP).  The team will \ndetermine the individualized services, supports and accommodations the \nclass member needs to transition to an integrated community setting and \nhow these supports can be provided in an integrated community setting. \nOnce a class member or guardian, as applicable, has voiced an interest to \npursue community transition, a DDS regional case manager will be assigned \nto join the team. \nThe team, assisted by the Remedial Expert, will identify record and \naddress guardian, advocate, family and class member concerns and offer \nsuggestions to overcome any identified concerns that create a barrier to \nsuccessful community placement. Transition from STS to an integrated \ncommunity setting shall be considered individually for each class member \nand pursued unless the guardian exercises informed choice not to pursue \ncommunity placement as described in Benchmark #8 below. \nD.  Resource Development \nThe Level of Need (LON) assessment and Individual Plan (IP) will be \nused to determine the level of resources the class member will need to \ntransition to the community, including having employment, day service, \nmedical, dental, health and clinical supports. \nThe parties agree that DDS has the ways and means to make resources \navailable for each and every class member who wishes to transition from \nSTS to an integrated community setting with appropriate individualized \nservices and supports.  There is no financial or resource barrier to \ncommunity placement for any class member who desires to transition. STS \nclass members will not be in competition for resources allocated for any \nother individual or target group served by DDS. \n3 \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1036-1   Filed 07/12/10   Page 4 of 7\nDDS will revise its portability policies and procedures to explicitly \ninclude and be applicable to all STS class members. \nE. Informed Choice \nThe Department commits itself to taking actions and putting \nprocesses in place to make sure that guardians, family members, advocates, \nand class members have sufficient information about community options to \nmake an informed choice about team members' recommendations for the \nmost integrated setting to meet the class member's needs. \nPrior to a class member or guardian making an informed choice, all \ninterested guardians, advocates, class members and family members will be \noffered opportunities to visit day and residential programs and services that \nwould be appropriate to meet the individual needs of the class member. \nClass members shall have the opportunity to spend time in \ncommunity residential homes prior to transition from STS. \nII.  BENCHMARKS \nThe parties agree that the following benchmarks and other \nrequirements of this settlement agreement  shall be used by the parties, the \nremedial expert and the Court to assess and determine Defendants' \ncompliance with this agreement. The Defendants shall implement these \nbenchmarks within the time frames set forth herein: \n1.  Complete the development of a training curriculum for Case Managers \nand IDT members regarding the exercise of \"professional judgment\" in \nrecommending transition to the most integrated setting appropriate to meet \nthe needs of class members.  The training curriculum shall include: \n•  The ADA, as interpreted in Olmstead and related cases; \n•  DDS policies and procedures regarding community placement, \ntransfer requirements and individual rights; \n•  HCBS waivers; \n•  Access to community services and supports; \n4 \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1036-1   Filed 07/12/10   Page 5 of 7\n•  Exercising professional judgment regarding most integrated \nsetting and community inclusion; \n•  Other areas deemed necessary by the remedial expert. \n(Within six (6) months COS- Commencement of Settlement'). \n2. Complete implementation of competency-based training for Case \nManagers and IDT members in accordance with the established curriculum. \n(Within twelve (12) months COS), and establish schedule for such training \nfor new Case Managers and IDT members. \n3.

The education plan shall include the following: \na) Defendants shall provide to all class members, advocates, families and \ntheir guardians informational material that describes the revised \nportability policies that explains in plain language how portability \nallows anyone in the DDS system to utilize their resources to receive \nsupports and services in another location and from another provider \nor through hiring their own staff. \nb) Methods to assure that information is available upon which informed \nchoice can be made will include: \n•  Ongoing information for team members about current service \noptions in the community so they can be a resource for families, \nclass members, advocates and guardians \n•  Written information and presentations to families, advocates, class \nmembers and guardians about community services and providers. \nInformation sessions will be offered to small groups of guardians, \nadvocates and families or on an individual basis \n1 The Commencement of Settlement occurs when the Settlement Agreement is signed by the parties, \napproved by the Court and the Remedial Expert is retained. This must occur within thirty days of court \napproval of the Settlement Agreement. \n5 \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1036-1   Filed 07/12/10   Page 6 of 7\n•  Information provided by the Remedial Expert at individual team \nmeetings \n•  STS will invite providers to make presentations to groups of \ninterested guardians, advocates, class members and family \nmembers \n•  STS will offer provider fairs twice a year which will be open to \nclass members, advocates, families, guardians and staff \n•  Regional staff will be available to attend any individual or group \nmeetings to discuss community services, HCBS waivers and \ntransition planning \n4. Complete implementation of community education plan for class \nmembers, guardians, family, advocates, and personal representatives (within \ntwelve (12) to eighteen (18) months COS, and on-going). \n5.

(Within thirty (30) months COS).  Professional judgment shall \nidentify the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of the class \nmember regardless of severity of disability, in accordance with the ADA, its \nregulations and the Memorandum ofD  ecision and Order of the Court in this \ncase. See section I. B above. \n6. Complete transition planning and resource \nidentification/development for class members for whom there is a \nprofessional judgment/recommendation that the individual can be supported \nin a more integrated setting than the current placement, and the informed \nclass member or guardian does not oppose such placement. (Within three (3) \nmonths of the determination).  Where class member or guardian raises \nconcerns about the community transition, options to address such concerns \nare presented at each succeeding IDT meeting and the class member or \nguardian are offered ways to address concerns with the involvement of the \nexpert, as needed. The planning and community transition process shall \nprovide for the transition to the community in accordance with the \n6 \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1036-1   Filed 07/12/10   Page 7 of 7\nBenchmark# 7 below, and provide equal opportunity regardless of severity \nof disability. \n7. Community transition for class members identified through the IDT \ndeterminations and redeterminations will occur within six ( 6) to eighteen \n(18) months from determination (or annual redetermination), or as indicated \nin the class member's transition plan, with reasonable accommodation to the \nspecific needs, desires and circumstances of the class member.  Resources \nwill be made available to implement the class member's transition plan. \n8. Exercise of informed choice about community placement by a \nguardian and/or class member only after they have been informed of the \nbenefits of community placement and have had an opportunity to visit a \ncommunity and day program that is appropriate to meet their needs. Visits to \ncommunity settings appropriate to meet the needs of the class member, in \nthe judgment of the team, must occur within three (3) months of a decision \nthat the class member can live in an integrated community setting. \n9. The Remedial Expert will identify, record and evaluate the \nDepartment's response to concerns of family, advocates, guardians and class \nmembers, and to identified systemic barriers to the implementation of \nprofessional judgments for community transition.  The Department will \ndevelop a plan to address such concerns or barriers within thirty (30) days of \nidentification.  Such plans will be shared with the Remedial Expert and the \nPlaintiffs. \n10. Issues raised by the expert or the Plaintiffs in quarterly meetings \nare to be addressed by the Remedial Expert in accordance with the processes \nset forth in this Settlement Agreement, which relies upon the Defendants to \nrespond to issues to the satisfaction of the Remedial Expert. \n11. All class members recommended for community transition \nthrough the exercise of professional judgment will be disclosed to both \nparties and the Remedial expert at quarterly meetings of the parties. \n12. Advocates, independent from the department, will be sought and \nobtained for each class member who requests one and who does not have a \nguardian who is willing and able to obtain information relative to making \ninformed choice or to participate in the community placement process, \nincluding team meetings and community visitations, and for whom no other \n7 \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1036-2   Filed 07/12/10   Page 1 of 7\narrangements have been made for family, advocate, or personal \nrepresentative involvement. These independent advocates should be \nindividuals who are open to the recommendations of the team, in the \nexercise of professional judgment, and who will seriously consider what is \nthe most appropriate integrated setting in which the class member can be \nsupported. \n13. Quarterly for the first year and semi annually thereafter, the \nDepartment will identify and report on class members for whom community \ntransitions are being planned, as a result of the exercise of professional \njudgment and guardian support.  This written report will identity the nature \nand severity of disability of the class members being placed, the types of \nsupport/programs being planned, any capacity issues or barriers related to \ncommunity transition, and, as applicable specify how such capacity issues or \nbarriers will be addressed and resolved. \n14. DDS will negotiate a contract/agreement with the Remedial \nExpert within 30 days of COS to secure his services as set forth under \nSection III of this Agreement. Systemic issues identified by the Remedial \nExpert as presenting barriers to implementation of any benchmark, whether \nraised by Plaintiffs or not, shall be addressed and resolved by Defendants \nwithin the time frame specified by the Remedial Expert unless addressed in \na benchmark. \n15. All new or revised rules, regulations, policies, plans, guidelines, \ndirectives, instructions, protocols, and other material proposed by \nDefendants pursuant to this Agreement shall be made available to Plaintiffs \nfor comment.  Defendants shall respond to the Plaintiffs' comments within \nthe time frame established by the Remedial Expert. \n16. The DDS will proceed in accordance with the final transfer \nprocess and hearing rights set forth in Section 17a-210 of the Connecticut \nGeneral Statutes if the guardian's objection to community placement is not \nconsistent with what the team believes is in the class member's best interest \nto move, after all reasonable measures to address the guardian's concerns \nhave been taken. The parties acknowledge that the informed opposition of a \nguardian to transition the class member to a community setting, by itself, is \nnot a basis to propose and commence the transfer hearing process, in \naccordance with Section 17a-210 of the Connecticut general Statutes, nor a \nbasis to challenge or seek review of the guardianship in the Probate Court. \n8 \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1036-2   Filed 07/12/10   Page 2 of 7\nIII.

Three named defendants 00 STS, Commissioner of Mental Retardation Toni Richardson and\n97\nSTS Director Thomas Howley 00 have moved to dismiss on the grounds that plaintiffs' claims are barred under the\n97\ndoctrine of res judicata, and on the further grounds that plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief\nmay be granted. For the following reasons, the defendants' motion [Doc. No. 20] is denied.\nBACKGROUND\nIn 1986, the United States Department of Justice filed suit against the State of Connecticut under the Civil Rights\nof Institutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 et seq. The Justice Department suit under CRIPA, \nUnited States v. Connecticut, No. N-86-252 (EBB), sought to remedy allegedly unconstitutional conditions at\nSTS, which is an institution for persons with mental retardation operated by the Connecticut Department of\nMental Retardation. In the wake of this litigation, the Justice Department and the State of Connecticut negotiated\na Consent Decree which provided for a comprehensive remedial plan to ameliorate conditions at STS. This Court\napproved the Consent Decree on December 22, 1986.\nPrior to approval of the Consent Decree, the Association for Retarded Citizens of Connecticut (ARCC) and six\nSTS residents filed a Motion to Intervene in United States v. Connecticut. The proposed intervenors alleged, inter\nalia, that they had not been permitted to participate in negotiating the Consent Decree; that the terms of the\nConsent Decree would be inadequate to remedy conditions at STS; that the Consent Decree failed to adequately\naddress the residents' right to be considered for community placement; and that the Consent Decree failed to\nrequire STS to provide such training to residents as is necessary to preserve the basic self-care skills that they\npossess when they enter STS. This Court denied the proposed intervenors' Motion to Intervene, on the grounds\n\nthat the proposed intervenors were not prejudiced by the suit brought by the Justice Department and remained\nfree to file their own lawsuits against STS. Ruling on Pending Motions, Dec. 22, 1986.\nIn 1990 and 1991, this Court approved two additional Consent Orders, which were negotiated in response to\ncontinuing deficiencies found by Justice Department monitoring of STS. In November 1993, Justice Department\nmedical experts and attorneys undertook further investigation of conditions at STS, and found severe deficiencies\nin care and treatment of residents. These alleged deficiencies include a systemic failure to provide residents with\nadequate medical care and physical therapy, as well as a near complete absence of behavioral program\nimplementation. The Justice Department indicated its intent to pursue a further enforcement action against STS\nunless an agreement could be reached as to appropriate remedial steps.\nIn response to the Justice Department's findings, the Connecticut Department of Mental Retardation retained\noutside consultants to assess conditions at STS. These consultants largely concurred with the findings of the\nJustice Department, while also noting progress being made by STS in several areas.\nThe Justice Department and the State failed to reach an agreement concerning further remedial steps, and the\nJustice Department sought an order to show cause why the State should not be held in civil contempt. This Court\nheld a hearing on the Justice Department's motion, which is currently pending.\nThe instant litigation was commenced in October 1994 by the ARCC, seven current STS residents, People First\nof Connecticut (an advocacy group comprising people with disabilities) and the Western Connecticut Association\nfor Human Rights (an advocacy group comprising parents and families of people with disabilities). On behalf of a\nputative class of all STS residents, plaintiffs seek, inter alia, the following relief: to require STS professionals, in\nconjunction with each resident and his or her family and friends, to develop and implement an individualized plan\nof treatment and services appropriate for that resident; to have all residents evaluated for possible community\n137 placement *137 regardless of the severity or nature of their disabilities; to make available to each resident an\nindividual and independent advocate; to enjoin the use of Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders until procedures are\ndeveloped and implemented which assure that such orders will not be issued in error; and, with respect to those\nresidents in STS's Intermediate Care Facility for the Mentally Retarded (\"ICF/MR\"), to require STS to comply with\nall federal ICF/MR funding requirements, as set forth at 42 C.F.R. § 483.440.\nDISCUSSION\nA motion to dismiss under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) should be granted only if \"it is clear that no relief could be\ngranted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.\" Hishon v. King & Spalding,\n467 U.S. 69, 73, 104 S.Ct. 2229, 2232, 81 L.Ed.2d 59 (1984). \"The function of a motion to dismiss `is merely to\nassess the legal feasibility of the complaint, not to assay the weight of the evidence which might be offered in\nsupport thereof.'\" Ryder Energy Distrib. Corp. v. Merrill Lynch Commodities, Inc., 748 F.2d 774, 779 (2d Cir.1984)\n(quoting Geisler v. Petrocelli, 616 F.2d 636, 639 (2d Cir.1980)). In considering a motion to dismiss, a court must\npresume all factual allegations of the complaint to be true and must draw any reasonable inferences in favor of\nthe non-moving party. Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 101-02, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957).\nI. Res Judicata\nIt is well-settled that \"[u]nder res judicata, a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their\nprivies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.\" Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90,\n94, 101 S.Ct. 411, 414, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980). In the instant case, Defendants assert that plaintiffs' claims are\nbarred by res judicata, because the plaintiffs are privies of the United States, the plaintiffs' causes of action were\nor could have been brought in the prior action by the United States, and the consent decree entered into between\nthe United States and the State of Connecticut constitutes a final judgment on the merits. This Court disagrees.\nAs is discussed further below, res judicata is inapplicable to the instant case, because plaintiffs in this action are\nable to pursue causes of action and types of relief that were unavailable to the United States in the prior action,\n[1]\nand plaintiffs are not in fact in privity with the United States.\n\nA. Differing Causes of Action and Types of Relief Available to\nPlaintiffs\nPrior to the enactment of CRIPA in 1980, controlling precedents dictated that the Justice Department had no\nauthority to sue on behalf of institutionalized persons. See, e.g., United States v. Mattson, 600 F.2d 1295, 1297\n(9th Cir.1979). Under CRIPA, however, the Attorney General may bring suit for equitable relief to ensure the\n\"minimum corrective measures\" necessary to remediate \"egregious or flagrant conditions which deprive\n[institutional residents] of any [federally protected] rights, privileges, or immunities,\" provided the Attorney\nGeneral finds that such deprivations occur \"pursuant to a pattern or practice of resistance.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1997a.\nThus, the Justice Department may only sue on behalf of institutionalized persons if the strict requirements of\n[2]\nCRIPA are satisfied, and may only seek \"minimum corrective measures.\"\n138 *138 In contrast, in order to establish a claim under the Due Process Clause, Section 504, the ADA and Section\n1983, plaintiffs in this action need not meet the requirements of CRIPA and may seek more than minimum\ncorrective measures. The Ninth Circuit has aptly summarized this difference, commenting with respect to a case\nbrought under CRIPA that, whereas institutional residents are concerned with all aspects of conditions at their\nfacility, \"[t]he United States in this litigation is concerned only with flagrant-conditions.\" United States v. Oregon,\n839 F.2d 635, 638-39 (9th Cir.1988); see also United States v. Michigan, 116 F.R.D. 655, 663 (W.D.Mich.1987)\n(noting that remedies under a CRIPA consent decree are limited to \"minimum corrective measures\").\nThis discrepancy between the causes of action and types of relief available to the Justice Department and to\ninstitutional residents is evident in the instant case. For instance, neither the Complaint filed by the Justice\nDepartment nor the Consent Decree entered into by the Justice Department and the State of Connecticut\naddressed the residents' right to receive such training as is necessary to preserve those self-care skills that\nresidents possess upon entering STS. Similarly, neither the Complaint nor the Consent Decree addressed the\nright of residents in ICF/MR units to receive \"active treatment,\" as is required by 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(d)(2) and 42\nC.F.R. § 483.440. Moreover, neither the Complaint nor the Consent Decree sought to require STS to consider all\nresidents for community placement. Finally, neither the Complaint nor the Consent Decree sought to enjoin STS\nfrom issuing DNR orders. Each of the above remedies is sought by plaintiffs in the instant case.\nThus, in the instant case there is manifest evidence that the statutory structure of CRIPA prevented the Justice\nDepartment from pursuing all of the causes of action and types of relief which are available to the plaintiffs. For\nthis reason, plaintiffs' claims are not barred under res judicata. See Burka v. New York City Transit Auth., 32 F.3d\n654, 658 (2nd Cir.1994) (holding that res judicata is not applicable to a claim for relief that was unavailable in the\nearlier action).\nB. Absence of Privity\nLiteral privity need not exist between two parties in order for one party to be claim precluded by an action brought\nby the other. Alpert's Newspaper Delivery Inc. v. The New York Times Co., 876 F.2d 266, 270 (2d Cir.1989).\nRather, the appropriate inquiry concerns whether the party against whom preclusion is sought was adequately\nrepresented by another party vested with authority of representation. Id.; Expert Electric, Inc. v. Levine, 554 F.2d\n1227, 1233 (2d Cir.),cert. denied,434 U.S. 903, 98 S.Ct. 300, 54 L.Ed.2d 190 (1977). This inquiry must be a\n\"factual determination of substance, not mere form.\" Expert Electric, 554 F.2d at 1227.\nIn United States v. Connecticut, the Justice Department brought suit under CRIPA in order to protect the\nconstitutional rights of STS residents. The Justice Department did not, of course, have any actual consent from\nSTS residents to provide representation on their behalf. Indeed, to the contrary, the ARCC and individual STS\nresidents sought to intervene on the grounds that the Justice Department was not adequately protecting their\ninterests.\n\nThus, the only authority by which the Justice Department represented STS residents was CRIPA itself. The\ndefendants assert that CRIPA and its legislative history indicate a congressional intent to authorize the Justice\nDepartment to represent institutionalized persons. However, any such argument must be qualified by reference to\nCRIPA's disclaimer respecting private litigation, which states in relevant part:\nThe provisions of this subchapter shall in no way expand or restrict the authority of parties other\nthan the United States to enforce the legal rights which they may have pursuant to existing law\nwith regard to institutionalized persons.\n139 *139 42 U.S.C. § 1997j. The precise interplay between this clause and res judicata principles is not entirely clear\n[3]\nand need not be decided in the instant case.  At the very least, however, § 1997j clearly undercuts any\nassertion that CRIPA definitively authorizes the Attorney General to serve as a binding representative of\ninstitutionalized persons.\nMost significantly, whether or not the Justice Department can be said to have been authorized to represent STS\nresidents, this Court finds that the Justice Department did not adequately represent such residents. A finding of\ninadequate representation is required based upon the above discussion of the limited causes of action and types\nof relief available to and pursued by the Justice Department in United States v. Connecticut. Since the Justice\nDepartment did not seek all of the types of relief which plaintiffs seek in this case, it follows directly that the\nJustice Department's representation was inadequate from a res judicata perspective, and that the plaintiffs are\ntherefore not in privity with the United States. See Williamson v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 468 F.2d 1201, 1203 (2d\nCir.1972) (holding that six employees bringing suit under Title VII were not in privity with the United States, which\nhad brought a previous suit against the same employer, because the employees sought a type of relief which the\n[4]\nUnited States had not sought), cert. denied,411 U.S. 931, 93 S.Ct. 1893, 1902, 36 L.Ed.2d 390 (1973).\nThus, the requirements of res judicata are not satisfied, as plaintiffs have available causes of action and types of\nrelief that were unavailable to the United States, and plaintiffs are not in privity with the United States. Plaintiffs'\n[5]\nclaims therefore are not barred by res judicata.\nII. Failure to State A Claim Upon Which Relief Can Be Granted\nDefendants assert that plaintiffs' actions under the Due Process Clause, Section 504, the ADA and Section 1983\nall fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. This court disagrees. As the following discussion shows,\neach of plaintiffs' actions states a claim upon which relief may be granted.\nA. Due Process Claim\nIn Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982), the Supreme Court established the\ncontours of the right of residents in state-operated institutions for the mentally retarded to sue under the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court found unequivocally that such residents possess a\nconstitutional right to adequate food, shelter, clothing, medical care, safe conditions of confinement and freedom\n140 from unreasonable bodily restraints, as well as a right to such training and skill development as is necessary *140\nto protect these constitutional guarantees. 457 U.S. at 315-18, 102 S.Ct. at 2457-59. Although the Court did not\ndecide whether institutional residents have a right to other types of training and skill development, the Second\nCircuit has determined that residents have a due process right to \"training sufficient to prevent basic self-care\nskills from deteriorating.\" Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239, 1250 (2d\nCir.1984). Cf. Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 327-29, 102 S.Ct. at 2464-65 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (noting that the\nmajority opinion leaves open the question of a right to training to preserve those self-care skills possessed by a\nresident upon institutionalization).\nThe Youngberg Court established a \"professional judgment\" standard for determining whether a state-operated\ninstitution has satisfied its obligations to residents under the Due Process Clause. 457 U.S. at 321-23, 102 S.Ct.\nat 2461-62. Under this standard, a state institution may be held liable for a decision made by a professional \"only\n\nwhen the decision by the professional is such a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment,\npractice, or standards as to demonstrate that the person responsible actually did not base the decision on such a\njudgment.\" Id., at 323, 102 S.Ct. at 2462; accord Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, 737 F.2d at 1248.\nThe Youngberg professional judgment standard governs claims for failure to provide community placement.\nThus, whereas \"there is no constitutional right to community placement,\" a decision to keep a resident in an\ninstitutional rather than community setting is only constitutional to the extent that it is a \"rational decision based\non professional judgment.\" Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, 737 F.2d at 1249.\nIn the instant case, plaintiffs allege in Count One of their complaint that defendants have failed to provide\nadequate shelter, clothing, nutrition and medical care; have failed to provide sufficient training to help residents\nmaintain self-care skills and to ensure a safe environment free from unnecessary restraint; and have failed to\nconsider all residents for possible community placement, as would be required by professional judgment.\nPresuming the facts alleged in plaintiffs' complaint to be true, plaintiffs' due process action clearly states a claim\nupon which relief can be granted.\nB. Section 504 and ADA Claims\nPlaintiffs assert that defendants, by failing to consider certain severely handicapped residents for community\n[6]\nplacement, have violated both Section 504 and the ADA.  For the purpose of plaintiffs' motion, defendants\nconcede the applicability of both Section 504 and the ADA. Defendants' sole contention, other than the res\njudicata argument discussed previously, is that neither Section 504 nor the ADA confers a \"right to community\nplacement.\" Defendants are correct in this assertion. See, e.g., Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d 325, 336 (3d Cir.),\ncert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 116 S.Ct. 64, 133 L.Ed.2d 26 (1995). However, defendants misconstrue plaintiffs'\ncomplaint. Rather than asserting an absolute right to community placement, plaintiffs allege that defendants, by\nfailing to consider certain severely handicapped residents for community placement, have practiced\ndiscrimination on the basis of severity of disability. This Court considers whether relief may be granted based\nupon such a claim.\nPursuant to Section 504, the former Department of Health, Education and Welfare (\"HEW\"), now the Department\n141 of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\"), promulgated enforcement *141 regulations, including the following:\n(b) Discriminatory actions prohibited.\n(1) A recipient [of federal funding], in providing any aid, benefit or service, may not\n...\n(iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits or services to handicapped persons or to any class\nof handicapped persons unless such action is necessary to provide qualified handicapped\npersons with aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others.\n45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(1).\nCongress drafted the ADA so as to be largely consistent with Section 504, while at the same time extending its\nprovisions. See Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d at 329-35 (tracing the drafting of the ADA and its relation to Section\n504). Accordingly, Title II of the ADA directs that the Attorney General shall promulgate enforcement regulations\nand that \"such regulations shall be consistent with [those regulations] applicable to recipients of Federal financial\nassistance under [Section 504].\" 42 U.S.C. § 12134(b). Pursuant to this mandate, the Department of Justice\npromulgated regulations under Title II mirroring those promulgated under Section 504, including the following:\n35.130 General prohibitions against discrimination.\n(b)(1) A public entity, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may not ...\n(iv) Provide different or separate aids, benefits, or services to individuals with disabilities or to any\nclass of individuals with disabilities than is provided to others, unless such action is necessary to\n\nprovide qualified individuals with disabilities with aids, benefits, or services that are as effective as\nthose provided to others.\n28 C.F.R. § 35.130.\nThe regulations promulgated under both Section 504 and the ADA thus clearly prohibit discrimination based upon\nseverity of disability. An interpretation of an agency charged with the administration of a statute is entitled to\nsubstantial deference, Blum v. Bacon, 457 U.S. 132, 141, 102 S.Ct. 2355, 2361, 72 L.Ed.2d 728 (1982), and\nshould be given controlling weight unless such interpretation is arbitrary, capricious or manifestly contrary to the\nstatute. Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778,\n2782-83, 81 L.Ed.2d 694,reh'g denied,468 U.S. 1227, 105 S.Ct. 28, 82 L.Ed.2d 921 (1984). Additionally, when\nCongress, in enacting a statute, explicitly approves of prior administrative interpretations of a law, Congress is\ntreated as having adopted such interpretations. United States v. Board of Comm'rs of Sheffield, Alabama, 435\nU.S. 110, 134, 98 S.Ct. 965, 980-81, 55 L.Ed.2d 148 (1978). Thus, Congress's instruction to the Attorney General\nto promulgate regulations under the ADA consistent with those promulgated under Section 504 indicates\ncongressional approval of the above-cited specific prohibitions.\nMoreover, numerous courts have recognized that both Section 504 and the ADA prohibit discrimination on the\nbasis of the severity of a person's disability. See, e.g., Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d at 336 (\"[I]f Congress were\nonly concerned with disparate treatment of the disabled as compared to their nondisabled counterparts,\" then the\nADA's reference to the persistence of discrimination in institutionalization would constitute a \"non sequitur\"); \nPlummer v. Branstad, 731 F.2d 574, 578 (8th Cir.1984) (severity of handicap cannot be sole reason for denying\nTitle XX funding); Martin v. Voinovich, 840 F.Supp. 1175, 1191-92 (S.D.Ohio 1993) (both Section 504 and the\nADA prohibit discrimination on the basis of severity of handicap); Jackson v. Fort Stanton Hosp. & Training\nSchool, 757 F.Supp. 1243, 1299 (D.N.M.1990) (\"The severity of plaintiffs' handicaps is itself a handicap which,\nunder § 504, cannot be the sole reason for denying plaintiffs access to community programs.\"), rev'd on other\ngrounds,964 F.2d 980 (10th Cir.1992); Garrity v. Gallen, 522 F.Supp. 171, 214-15 (D.N.H. 1981) (discrimination\nbased upon a generalized assumption concerning the abilities of a group of severely handicapped persons is\nactionable under Section 504); Lynch v. Maher, 507 F.Supp. 1268, 1278-79 n. 15 (D.Conn.1981) (discrimination\n142 on the basis of *142 extent of handicap is actionable under Section 504).[7]\nThus, under both statutes, STS is prohibited from refusing to consider certain residents for possible community\nplacement, merely based upon the degree of their disabilities. Plaintiffs allege in Count Two of their complaint\nthat defendants have failed to consider certain severely disabled residents for community placement. Presuming\nthe facts alleged in plaintiffs' complaint to be true, plaintiffs' actions under Section 504 and the ADA clearly state\nclaims upon which relief can be granted.\nC. Section 1983 Claim\nAs a condition of receiving funds for ICF/MR units under the Social Security Act, STS is required to provide\n\"active treatment\" to all ICF/MR residents, 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(d)(2), and to \"meet such standards as may be\nprescribed by [HHS].\" 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(d)(1). Pursuant to these provisions, HHS has promulgated\nrequirements as to what constitutes active treatment, as well as detailed standards concerning what services\nmust be provided to ICF/MR residents, which are set forth at 42 C.F.R. § 483.440. Plaintiffs contend that\ndefendants have violated these requirements, and plaintiffs seek relief for such violations under Section 1983.\nDefendants assert that, even if violations of the ICF/MR requirements could be shown, plaintiffs have no right to\n[8]\nsue under Section 1983.\n1. The Evolving Analytic Framework\nIn a series of cases, the Supreme Court has established a framework for determining when there exists a right to\nsue under Section 1983 for violation of a federal statute. In Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 65\nL.Ed.2d 555 (1980), the Court established that Section 1983 generally provides a cause of action for violations of\n\nfederal statutes by state and local governmental units. 448 U.S. at 4, 100 S.Ct. at 2504. Subsequently, the Court\nrecognized two exceptions to this rule: (1) cases in which the statute in question does not create an enforceable\n\"right, privilege or immunity\"; and (2) cases in which such a right exists but Congress has foreclosed enforcement\nof the right under Section 1983. Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment & Housing Auth., 479 U.S. 418, 423, 107\nS.Ct. 766, 770, 93 L.Ed.2d 781 (1987).\nIn Wilder v. Virginia Hosp. Ass'n, 496 U.S. 498, 110 S.Ct. 2510, 110 L.Ed.2d 455 (1990), the Court clarified the\ncriteria for determining whether either of the two exceptions is applicable. Under the first exception, the Court\nheld that no enforceable right exists if: the statutory provision in question was not intended to benefit the putative\nplaintiffs; the provision reflects merely a \"congressional preference\" rather than a \"binding obligation\"; or the\n143 plaintiffs' interest is \"too vague and amorphous\" such that it is \"beyond the competence of the judiciary to *143\nenforce.\" Id., at 509, 110 S.Ct. at 2517 (citing Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493 U.S. 103, 106, 110\nS.Ct. 444, 448-49, 107 L.Ed.2d 420 (1989)).\nWith respect to the second exception, courts \"[should] not lightly conclude that Congress intended to preclude\nreliance on § 1983 as a remedy for the deprivation of a federally secured right.\" Id., at 520, 110 S.Ct. at 2523.\n(citations omitted). Thus, defendants have the burden of showing \"`by express provision or other specific\nevidence from the statute itself that Congress intended to foreclose such private enforcement.'\" Id., at 520-21,\n110 S.Ct. at 2523. (quoting Wright, 479 U.S. at 423, 107 S.Ct. at 770). In the absence of an express provision,\nprivate enforcement may only be deemed to be foreclosed if the statute itself creates a remedial scheme that is\n\"`sufficiently comprehensive ... to demonstrate congressional intent to preclude the remedy of suits under §\n1983.'\" Id., at 521, 110 S.Ct. at 2523 (quoting Middlesex County Sewerage Auth. v. National Sea Clammers\nAss'n, 453 U.S. 1, 20, 101 S.Ct. 2615, 2626, 69 L.Ed.2d 435 (1981)).\nTwo years after Wilder, in Suter v. Artist M., 503 U.S. 347, 112 S.Ct. 1360, 118 L.Ed.2d 1 (1992), the Supreme\nCourt considered whether a class of children subject to abuse, neglect or dependency petitions had a right to sue\nunder Section 1983 for a state's alleged violation of 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(15). Section 671(a)(15) requires states\nreceiving federal assistance for foster care and adoption services to devise a plan which includes both\nreasonable efforts to eliminate the need for removing children from their homes and, with respect to cases in\nwhich children are removed, reasonable efforts toward reunification.\nThe Suter Court found that the plaintiff class did not have a right to sue under Section 1983 for alleged violations\nof § 671(a)(15). In reaching this decision, the Court did not make explicit reference to the well-established\nframework which had been reaffirmed and clarified by the Court two years earlier in Wilder. The Court did,\nhowever, distinguish Suter from Wilder, based upon two principal grounds. First, the Court found that the only\nobligation which § 671(a)(15) unambiguously imposed upon a participating state is that it have a plan approved\nby HHS. 503 U.S. at 358, 112 S.Ct. at 1367-68. Thus, even if the defendant in Suter, the State of Illinois, had not\nin fact devised or carried out a plan involving the required \"reasonable efforts,\" the state nevertheless would have\nbeen in full compliance with its obligations, because the state's plan had been approved by HHS. Id. Secondly,\nthe Court found that neither § 671(a)(15) nor the regulations promulgated thereunder contain sufficient guidance\nconcerning the meaning of the \"reasonable efforts\" requirement so as to allow a court to determine whether or\nnot a state is in compliance therewith. Id., at 360, 112 S.Ct. at 1368-69.\nAlthough the Court's decision in Suter did not explicitly adopt the Wilder framework, the Suter Court also declined\nto overrule Wilder. Rather, the Court cited parts of Wilder and Wright with approval, while carefully distinguishing \nSuter on its facts. Thus, in the wake of Suter, the circuit courts moved toward synthesizing Suter into the Wilder\nframework. See, e.g., Howe v. Ellenbecker, 8 F.3d 1258, 1262 n. 5 (8th Cir.1993) (\"[A]lthough Suter weakened\nearlier precedent in vital respects, the Court was careful not to explicitly overrule the Wilder framework.\"), cert.\ndenied,___ U.S. ___, 114 S.Ct. 1373, 128 L.Ed.2d 49 (1994); Miller v. Whitburn, 10 F.3d 1315, 1319 (7th\nCir.1993) (\"[Suter] is not the death knell of the analytic framework established in Wilder.\") (citation omitted); Chan\nv. City of New York, 1 F.3d 96, 104 (2d Cir.) (adopting \"the Wilder analysis or, to the extent that it differs, the Suter\nanalysis\"), cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 114 S.Ct. 472, 126 L.Ed.2d 423 (1993); Stowell, 976 F.2d at 68 (finding it\n\"both prudent and possible to synthesize the teachings of Suter with the Court's prior precedents\").\nWhereas the various circuits each sought to harmonize Suter with previous precedent, the circuits varied as to\nwhich aspect of Suter should be deemed most significant. For instance, the First Circuit found that Suter added\n\n144 the following threshold consideration to the Wilder framework: \"[W]hen a provision *144 in a statute fails to\nimpose a direct obligation on the States, instead placing the onus of compliance with the statute's substantive\nprovisions on the federal government, no cause of action cognizable under section 1983 can flourish.\" Stowell,\n976 F.2d at 70. In contrast, the Second Circuit has held that \"the significant point in Suter was not that the statute\nin question only required a state to submit a plan to the federal agency, but that the statute provided no guidance\nfor measuring `reasonable efforts.'\" Marshall v. Switzer, 10 F.3d 925, 929 (2d Cir. 1993) (citing Chan, 1. F.3d at\n104). In a similar vein, the District of Columbia Circuit has held that \"[t]he Suter Court's principal concern was the\nAct's vagueness,\" and that Suter therefore did not change existing precedent. LaShawn A. v. Barry, 69 F.3d 556,\n[9]\n569-70 (D.C.Cir.1995),vacated and reh'g in banc granted,74 F.3d 303, (D.C.Cir.1996).\nIn October 1994, Congress sought to overturn what it saw as the Suter Court's deviation from the established \n[10]\nWilder framework. Accordingly, Congress enacted the following amendment to the Social Security Act:\nIn an action brought to enforce a provision of this chapter, such provision is not to be deemed\nunenforceable because of its inclusion in a section of this chapter requiring a State plan or\nspecifying the required contents of a State plan. This section is not intended to limit or expand the\ngrounds for determining the availability of private actions to enforce State plan requirements other\nthan by overturning any such grounds applied in Suter v. Artist M., 112 S.Ct. 1360 (1992), but not\napplied in prior Supreme Court decisions respecting such enforceability; provided however that\nthis section is not intended to alter the holding in Suter v. Artist M. that section 671(a)(15) of this\ntitle is not enforceable in a private right of action.\nPub.L. No. 103-382, 108 Stat. 4057 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-2) (\"Section 1320a-2\").\nThe few courts that have had the opportunity to rule on the impact of Section 1320a-2 have issued somewhat\nconflicting interpretations. Several district courts, subscribing to the view that the Suter Court based its decision\non the fact that 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(15) required only that participating states submit a plan to HHS for approval,\nhave taken Section 1320a-2 at its face value and have therefore reverted to applying the Wilder framework\nunmodified by Suter. See, e.g., Ward v. Thomas, 895 F.Supp. 406, 409 (D.Conn.1995); Harris v. James, 883\nF.Supp. 1511, 1519 (M.D.Ala.1995); Jeanine B. v. Thompson, 877 F.Supp. 1268, 1283 (E.D.Wis. 1995). In\ncontrast, however, the District of Columbia Circuit and at least one district court have taken the view that Suter\ndid not in fact modify pre-existing law, and that, therefore, Section 1320a-2 has no effect whatsoever. LaShawn\nA., 69 F.3d at 570,vacated and reh'g in banc granted,74 F.3d 303 (D.C.Cir.1996); Neal v. Ridge, 1995 WL\n728589, at *3 (E.D.Pa. Dec. 7, 1995). Although divergent in methodology, both of the above interpretations lead\nto the same endpoint: courts should apply the Wilder framework, unmodified by Suter.\nArguably, the appropriate Second Circuit interpretation of Section 1320a-2 should be slightly different from either\nof the above interpretations. In Chan and Marshall, the Second Circuit found that Suter may have modified the \nWilder framework, but if so only by placing renewed emphasis on the requirement that statutory language must\nbe definite and specific in order to confer an enforceable right. Marshall, 10 F.3d at 929; Chan, 1. F.3d at 104. If \nSuter did in fact modify prior precedent in this way, then, arguably, Section 1320a-2 does not reverse this\nmodification, as the fairest reading of Section 1320a-2 is that Congress was concerned only that a court should\n145 not eviscerate an otherwise enforceable right merely because it appears in a statute mandating *145 that\nparticipating states include a particular provision in their state plans. According to this reasoning, it would still be\nappropriate for courts in the Second Circuit to apply the Wilder framework, modified slightly by Suter in that the\nrequirement of specific statutory language should be strictly interpreted. Ultimately, however, this Court need not\ndefinitively ascertain the effect of Suter and of Section 1320a-2. As the following analysis shows, Section 1396d\n(d) and the regulations promulgated thereunder certainly confer an enforceable right, whether analyzed according\n[11]\nto a straightforward Wilder analysis or, equally, according to a Wilder analysis modified slightly by Suter.\n2. The Analytic Framework Applied\nUnder either a Wilder or modified Wilder analysis, the general rule remains that violation of a federal statute is\nremediable under Section 1983 unless one of two exceptions applies. Under the former exception, this Court\n\nmust examine three criteria in order to determine whether the statutory scheme confers an enforceable right.\nFirst, the Court finds that those members of plaintiffs' putative class who are ICF/MR residents are clearly the\nintended beneficiaries of the statutory scheme. Wilder, 496 U.S. at 509, 110 S.Ct. at 2517. There can be no\ndoubt that each of the detailed requirements set forth at 42 C.F.R. § 483.440 was drafted with the principal goal\nof ensuring quality care for ICF/MR residents.\nSecond, § 1396d(d) and the regulations promulgated thereunder clearly impose a binding obligation upon\nparticipating states, rather than merely stating a congressional preference that particular services be provided. \nWilder, 496 U.S. at 509, 110 S.Ct. at 2517. Notably, the ICF/MR regulations set forth at 42 C.F.R. § 483.440 are\nentitled \"Conditions of participation,\" and each subpart is written in clearly obligatory language. See, e.g., 42\nC.F.R. § 483.440(a)(1) (\"Each client must receive a continuous active treatment program, which includes ...\ngeneric training, treatment, health services and related services described in this subpart, that is directed toward\n(i) The acquisition of behaviors necessary for the client to function with as much self determination and\nindependence as possible; and (ii) The prevention or deceleration of regression or loss of current optimal\nfunctional status.\").\nThird, even if the provisions at issue are viewed through the strict lens of Suter, the standards which defendants\nare alleged to have violated are not \"too vague and amorphous\" such that they would be \"beyond the\ncompetence of the judiciary to enforce.\" Wilder, 496 U.S. at 509, 110 S.Ct. at 2517. Rather, the provisions at\nissue in this case are analogous to those in 29 U.S.C. §§ 721(a)(8) & (a)(9), which the Second Circuit in Marshall\nfound to be \"specific and definite, and therefore within the competence of the judiciary to enforce.\" 10 F.3d at 929.\nCompare, e.g., 29 U.S.C. § 721(a)(9) (\"[Each state plan] must provide that ... (B) an individualized written\nrehabilitation program ... will be developed for each individual with a disability eligible for vocational services\nunder this chapter; (C) such services will be provided under the plan in accordance with such program ...\") with\n42 C.F.R. § 483.440(c)(1) (\"Each client must have an individual program plan developed by an interdisciplinary\nteam that represents the professions, disciplines or service areas that are relevant to (i) Identifying the client's\nneeds, as described [later in this section]; and (ii) Designing programs that meet the client's needs.\").\nHaving found that each of the three criteria set forth under the first Wilder exception points toward finding an\n146 enforceable right to sue, the Court lastly examines the *146 second exception set forth under Wilder 00 whether\n97\nCongress has foreclosed enforcement of the right under Section 1983. As noted previously, a court may only\nconclude that Congress has intended to preclude suit under Section 1983 if the statute in question either includes\nan express provision to that effect or creates a remedial scheme sufficiently comprehensive so as to indicate\nCongress's intent. Wilder, 496 U.S. at 520-21, 110 S.Ct. at 2523-24.\nIn the instant case, the provisions of the Social Security Act at issue contain no express provision foreclosing suit\nand provide no remedial scheme by which ICF/MR residents may petition to obtain greater services. Indeed, the\nonly remedial measure established by the statutory scheme is withdrawal of funding by HHS for non-compliance\nwith program conditions. 42 U.S.C. § 1396i(b). In Wilder, the Supreme Court found that an analogous remedial\nmeasure authorizing HHS to withdraw funds for non-compliance in no way indicated Congressional intent to\nforeclose suit under Section 1983. 496 U.S. at 521-22, 110 S.Ct. at 2523-24.\nThus, neither of the exceptions set forth under Wilder are applicable in the instant case, meaning that plaintiffs\nmay validly sue under Section 1983 for alleged violations of the federal program requirements for ICF/MR units.\nPresuming the facts alleged in plaintiffs' complaint to be true, plaintiffs' Section 1983 action clearly states a claim\nupon which relief can be granted.\nSUMMARY\nDefendants' Motion to Dismiss [Doc. No. 20] is denied.\nSO ORDERED.\n\n[1] The question of whether a suit brought by the United States under CRIPA bars a later suit by institutional\nresidents is apparently one of first impression. However, one federal district court in the District of Massachusetts,\nin considering a motion to intervene by institutional residents in a CRIPA suit, stated in dicta that: \nA court faced with a subsequent suit filed by the residents would not be able to use the doctrines of claim\npreclusion or issue preclusion against the residents. A judgment against the United States in this CRIPA suit\ncould not be used against the residents to bar any claims raised or any claims that could have been raised,\nbecause the residents were not parties or privies in this suit.\nUnited States v. Massachusetts, No. 85-0632-MA (D.Mass., Apr. 28, 1986).\n[2] It is solely the province of the Attorney General to determine the existence of these extra prerequisites to suit\nunder CRIPA. Once the Attorney General has brought suit, having determined that CRIPA's prerequisites are\nsatisfied, The United States is treated no differently than any other litigant, and has neither a greater nor lesser\nburden of proof than that faced by an individual institutional resident bringing suit on his or her own behalf. U.S. v.\nPennsylvania, 863 F.Supp. 217, 220 (E.D.Pa.1994).\n[3] Section 1997j evinces Congress' intent that CRIPA should have no impact on the existing rights of individuals\nto bring suit. However, such an intent could be interpreted to mean either that Congress wished all pre-existing\nlegal rules to apply to potential plaintiffs, including res judicata, or that Congress intended that CRIPA in no way\nprejudice individual plaintiffs, even by virtue of res judicata. This Court finds it unnecessary to choose between\nthese two competing interpretations of § 1997j. Even under the former interpretation, advocated by defendants in\nthis suit, res judicata would nevertheless be inapplicable to the instant case, because plaintiffs have different\ncauses of action and remedies available to them, and are not in privity with the United States.\n[4] There can be no dispute that the consent decree entered into by the parties in United States v. Connecticut\nrepresents a final judgment on the merits. Amalgamated Sugar Co. v. NL Indus., Inc., 825 F.2d 634, 639 (2d Cir.),\ncert. denied,484 U.S. 992, 108 S.Ct. 511, 98 L.Ed.2d 511 (1987). However, the contractual nature of consent\ndecrees reinforces this Court's finding that the plaintiffs in the instant case are not in privity with the United\nStates. See United States v. City of Jackson, 519 F.2d 1147, 1152 (5th Cir.1975) (\"A consent decree is in many\nrespects a contract between the parties thereto ... such decrees do not purport to be definitive statements of the\nparties' legal rights and [courts] will accord them little or no weight in the determination of the rights of persons\nnot party to them.\").\n[5] This finding is fully consistent with this Court's ruling on the ARCC's Motion to Intervene in United States v.\nConnecticut. In that ruling, this Court denied intervention on the grounds that the proposed intervenors would not\nbe prejudiced by the Justice Department's CRIPA litigation, as the proposed intervenors would remain free to\nbring suit individually. Ruling on Pending Motions, Dec. 22, 1986.\n[6] Section 504 provides that: \nNo otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States ... shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be\nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program\nor activity receiving Federal assistance.\n29 U.S.C. § 794. Title II of the ADA, which extends Section 504's coverage to state and local governments,\nmirrors the language of Section 504, providing that:\n[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be\ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by\nsuch entity.\n42 U.S.C. § 12132.\n[7] The Supreme Court's decision in Traynor v. Turnage, 485 U.S. 535, 108 S.Ct. 1372, 99 L.Ed.2d 618 (1988) is\ninapposite to this case. The primary holding of Traynor was that the 1978 amendments to the Rehabilitation Act\nof 1973 should not be deemed to have repealed a 1977 statute (codified at 38 U.S.C. § 1662(a)(1)) which\n\nallowed for an extension of time to use veterans' benefits under certain circumstances, but only on the condition\nthat a veteran's physical or mental disorder was not a result of willful misconduct by that veteran. Id., at 548, 108\nS.Ct. at 1381-82. The Court did state in dicta that \"the central purpose\" of Section 504 is \"to assure that\nhandicapped individuals receive `evenhanded treatment' in relation to non-handicapped individuals\" (citations\nomitted), and that \"there is nothing in [Section 504] that requires that any benefit extended to one category of\nhandicapped persons also be extended to all other categories of handicapped persons.\" Id., at 548-49, 108 S.Ct.\nat 1382-83. However, the circumstances underlying Traynor clearly show that the Court was not considering\nwhether discrimination based upon extent of disability is generally actionable under Section 504. Rather, the\nCourt had no need to consider this question, because the regulations promulgated under Section 504 by HEW\nprovide that Section 504 does not prohibit \"exclusion of a specific class of handicapped persons from a program\nlimited by federal statute or executive order to a different class of handicapped persons.\" 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(c).\nThis exception to Section 504's coverage is clearly not applicable to the instant case.\n[8] Defendants also assert that plaintiffs have failed to allege any violations of the ICF/MR requirements. To the\ncontrary, however, paragraph 79 of plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint alleges specific violations of these\nrequirements.\n[9] The District of Columbia Circuit's recent decision to grant rehearing in banc in LaShawn A. casts some doubt\nupon this holding. However, the circuit's original holding may yet survive, as LaShawn A. included numerous\ndifficult issues which may have prompted the circuit's decision to grant rehearing in banc.\n[10] Although Congress passed this amendment fully fifty-five days prior to the date on which defendants filed the\ninstant Motion to Dismiss, both parties inexplicably failed to mention the amendment in their briefs.\n[11] The Court also notes that Section 1320a-2 is arguably an unconstitutional attempt by Congress to impose a\nparticular rule of decision or means of statutory interpretation upon the judiciary. See LaShawn A., 69 F.3d at 581\n(Randolph, J., dissenting) (discussing questionable constitutionality of Section 1320-a). If so, then there is an\nargument to be made that courts should still find no enforceable right to be conferred by a statute mandating only\ninclusion of a particular provision in a state plan. However, even if such were the current state of the law, the\noutcome of the instant motion would be no different, because § 1396d(d) and the regulations promulgated\nthereunder require participating states to actually provide particular services rather than merely include such\nservices in a plan.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

This Court denied a motion\nto dismiss by defendants DMR and STS (the \"DMR defendants\") on\nFebruary 9, 1996, and granted plaintiffs' motion for class\ncertification on July 8, 1996.  Defendants DPHAS and DSS now move\nto dismiss all claims against them for failure to state a claim\nupon which relief may be granted.  For the following reasons,\ndefendants' motion [Doc. No. 82] is denied.1\n1  The following discussion presumes familiarity with the\nbackground and procedural history of this case, as well as with\nthis Court's rulings of February 9, 1996, and July 8, 1996.\n1\nMessier v. Southbury Training Sch.\nAO72A MR-CT-003-004\n(Rev. 8/1\n\nDISCUSSION\nA motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) should be\ngranted only if \"it is clear that no relief could be granted\nunder any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the\nallegations.\"  Hishon v. King & Spalding   467 U.S. 69, 73  (1984).\nr\n\"The function of a motion to dismiss  'is merely to assess the\nlegal feasibility of the complaint, not to assay the weight of\nthe evidence which might be offered in support thereof.1\"  Ryder\ngnergy Distrib. Corp. v. Merrill Lynch Commodities,. Inc.  748\nr \nF.2d 774, 779 (2d Cir. 1984) (quoting Geisler v. Petrocelli  616\nr\nF.2d 636, 639 (2d cir. 1980)).  In considering a motion to\ndismiss, a court must presume all factual allegations of the\ncomplaint to be true and must draw any reasonable inferences in\nfavor of the non-moving party.  Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41,\n45-46 (1957) .\nDefendants assert five primary arguments in support of their\nmotion to dismiss.  First, defendants claim that DPHAS owes no\nsubstantive due process duty to plaintiffs, because DPHAS has no\ncustodial role with respect to plaintiffs.  Second, defendants\nstate that DPHAS cannot be found to have violated procedural due\nprocess in relation to the issuance of DNR orders at private\nhospitals, because no state action is involved in such issuance.\nThird, defendants argue that even if state action can be found\nwith respect to the issuance of DNR orders at private hospitals,\nDMR clients at such hospitals are afforded sufficient protections\nby existing procedural safeguards.  Fourth, defendants assert\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nthat plaintiffs cannot establish a legally tenable theory-\nsupporting their claims relating to community placement, and\nthat, in any case, DPHAS and DSS play no role in making placement\ndeterminations.  Finally, defendants claim that plaintiffs have\nno right to sue under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (\"Section 1983\") for DSS1\nalleged failure to take \"corrective action\" to cure deficiencies,\nas required by federal regulations under the Social Security Act.\nI.  Substantive Due Process\nDefendants assert that no claim for violation of substantive\ndue process rights may be brought by plaintiffs against DPHAS,\nbecause DMR is the sole state agency retaining custody over\nplaintiffs, even when plaintiffs are taken away from DMR\nfacilities for treatment at community medical centers.  In\nsupport of this contention, defendants rely on Deshaney v.\nWinnebago County Dep't of Social Servs•. 489 U.S. 189 (1989), in\nwhich the Supreme Court found that a state's failure to protect\nan individual against private violence does not generally violate\nthe Due Process Clause.  Id. at 197.  Specifically, the Court\nfound that no violation may be found unless a state has custody\nof the individual, is in an analogous \"special relationship\" with\nthe individual, or has created the danger facing the individual.\nId. at 197-98, 201 n.9.  The Deshaney Court explicitly\ndistinguished the Court's earlier decisions in Estelle v. Gamble\nf\n429 U.S. 97 (1976) and Youngbera v. Romeo. 457 U.S. 307 (1982),\nwhich establish that state prisoners and mentally retarded\n\nresidents of state institutions may sue for substantive due\nprocess violations.\nThe instant case falls squarely under Youngberg  as there is\nr \nno dispute that the state has custody of plaintiffs.  In urging\nthis Court to distinguish among the various state agencies whose\nactions or inactions impact on care of plaintiffs, defendants\nassert a novel argument.  Indeed, the parties have not cited, nor\nhas this Court found, any other case in which such an argument\nhas been made.  In the below discussion, the Court analyzes the\nmerits of defendants' novel attempt to extend Deshaney.\nIn explaining the rationale underlying Deshaney, the Supreme\nCourt aptly explained the basis for the Estelle - Youngberg\ndoctrine:\n[W]hen the State by the affirmative exercise of its\npower so restrains an individual's liberty that it\nrenders him unable to care for himself, and at the same\ntime fails to provide for his basic human needs . . .\nit transgresses the substantive limits on state action\nset by the Eighth Amendment and the Due Process Clause.\n489 U.S. at 200.  The above rationale clearly applies to\nplaintiffs in the instant case.  The true question, however,\nconcerns whether the phrase \"custodial state agency\" should\nproperly be substituted for \"State\" in the above formulation, as\ndefendants suggest.\nIn the absence of precedent directly on point, reasoning by\nanalogy is necessary.  In this connection, the Court first takes\nnote of the well-settled rule that an individual's substantive\ndue process rights do not disappear merely based upon a change in\n\nthat individual's residence status.  See, e.g , Thomas S. v.\nT\nMorrow. 781 F.2d 367, 374 (4th Cir.)  fYounabera does not suggest\nthat an incompetent person sheds the basic liberty interests that\nthe Court identified when state officials and his guardian move\nhim from one facility to another.\"), cert, denied, 476 U.S. 1124\n(1986); Camp v. Gregory   67 F.3d 1286, 1293  (7th Cir. 1995)\nf\n(holding that children retain substantive due process rights when\nthe state places them with a private agency or foster family),\ncert, denied   116 U.S. 2498  (1996); Norfleet v. Arkansas Dep't of\nf\nHuman Servs., 989 F.2d 289, 291-93  (8th Cir. 1993)  (same); Yvonne\nL. by & through Lewis v. New Mexico Dep't of Human Servs., 959\nF.2d 883, 291-92 (10th Cir. 1992)  (same); Meador v. Cabinet for\nHuman Services, 902 F.2d 474, 476 (6th Cir.)  (same), cert,\ndenied   498 U.S. 867  (1990); Taylor by & through Walker v.\nf\nLedbetter. 818 F.2d 791, 794-95  (11th Cir. 1987)  (same), cert,\ndenied. 489 U.S. 1065  (1989); Doe v. New York City Dep't of\nSocial Servs.  649 F.2d 134 (2d Cir. 1981)  (same), cert, denied,\nf\n464 U.S. 864  (1983).\nThe above-cited cases also clearly indicate that when a\nstate has custody of an individual, the individual may sue under\nthe Due Process Clause based upon inaction by the state, even\nwhen the ultimate harm alleged occurred at the hands of private\nactors.2  Thus, whereas defendants in the instant case assert\n2  The extent of this principle is aptly illustrated by the\nrecent case of Wana v. Reno  81 F.3d 808  (9th Cir. 1996).  In\nr\nHang, the Ninth Circuit held that the federal government entered\ninto a special custodial relationship with the plaintiff by\nAO 72A\n\nthat plaintiffs complain of a privately-inflicted harm, it is\nclear that a state acting in a custodial relationship can be sued\nfor failing to prevent privately-inflicted harms.3\nMost significantly, the Court notes that a state may not\navoid its constitutional obligations merely by contracting out\ncaretaking functions.  West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 55-56 & n.14\n(1988).  Similarly, this Court cannot fathom that a state can\navoid constitutional obligations by splitting up functions among\nstate agencies, and then asserting that only the agency given\n\"custody\" is subject to the Constitution.4  ^\nIn the instant case, it may be that DMR is solely able to\neffect the changes that plaintiffs seek with respect to issuance\nof DNR orders.  If so, then DPHAS is not a proper defendant in\nthis aspect of the litigation.  Based upon plaintiff's\nparoling him into the United States to testify at a drug\nconspiracy trial, and that the Due Process Clause therefore\nrequires the government to protect him from harms which may be\ninflicted by the Chinese government upon his return, in\nretaliation for his testimony.  81 F.3d at 818-19.\n3  Counsel for defendants suggested at oral argument that\nif the instant plaintiffs may maintain their substantive due\nprocess claim, then any private hospital patient alleging that he\nor she has been mistreated may sue DPHAS for relief.  However,\nsuch a private patient, if hot in state custody, clearly cannot\nsue based upon substantive due process.\n4  The Court does not suggest that Connecticut has sought\nto effect such a result.  Indeed, the state's division of\nauthority may be entirely logical and appropriate.  However, the\nCourt is acutely aware that a contrary ruling on the issue in\nquestion might allow a state to assign different agencies\nresponsibility for clothing, feeding, sheltering or training\nresidents, while claiming that only a single custodial agency\ncould be sued for constitutional violations.\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nallegations, however, it appears that, should plaintiffs in fact\nhave a right to the relief that they seek, DPHAS's participation\nwould be necessary to provide such relief.  If so, then DPHAS\ndoes in fact have at least a marginal caretaking role with\nrespect to plaintiffs, and is therefore not immune to suit under\nthe Constitution.\nIn sum, the instant case is one in which the state not only\nhas custody of plaintiffs, but has allegedly placed them at risk\nby taking them to private medical facilities and failing to\nrequire such facilities to afford plaintiffs sufficient\nsafeguards prior to the issuance of DNR orders.  To the extent\nthat DPHAS' inaction may combine with DMR's affirmative actions\nand inaction to create this alleged harm, the Court finds that\nDPHAS may properly be sued under the Due Process Clause.\nII.  Procedural Due Process\nA.  State Action\nDefendants assert that plaintiffs may not pursue a\nprocedural due process claim, because decisions by private\nphysicians at community medical facilities do not constitute\nstate action.  In support of this contention, defendants rely\nprimarily on Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991 (1982), in which the\nSupreme Court held that decisions by private nursing homes to\ntransfer or discharge patients do not constitute state action,\neven though the state responds to such decisions by adjusting the\npatients' Medicaid benefits.\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nPlaintiffs in Blum challenged the specific transfers and\ndischarges, not the state's response thereto.  457 U.S. at 1005.\nIn the instant case, however, plaintiffs do not challenge the\nspecific decisions of private physicians to issue DNR orders.  To\nthe contrary, plaintiffs challenge the state's decision to place\nplaintiffs in medical facilities wherein there exists a risk of\nissuance of DNR orders absent certain safeguards, as well as the\nState's alleged failure to insist that such safeguards be\nimplemented.  Thus, there is no need to undertake a Blum analysis\nas to whether state action exists, as there is no question that\nthe state is responsible for determining where plaintiffs receive\nmedical treatment, nor is there any question that the state,\nacting in either its custodial or regulatory capacity, has the\nauthority to require further safeguards.5\nB.  Adequacy of Existing Safeguards\nDefendants further claim that even if state action can be\nfound with respect to the issuance of DNR orders at private\nhospitals, DMR clients at such hospitals are afforded sufficient\nprotections by existing procedural safeguards.  In support of\nthis argument, defendants point to various state and federal laws\nand regulations designed to assure that patients' wishes\nregarding medical care are honored.  It is certainly possible\n5  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 17a-238(g) indicates that DMR,\nacting in its custodial role, may require certain safeguards\nprior to the issuance of DNR orders with respect to its clients\nwho are treated at private medical facilities.\n8\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nthat, upon summary judgment or at trial, defendants will be able\nto succeed in showing that existing safeguards provide sufficient\nprotections such that plaintiffs cannot show any constitutional\nviolation.  However, for the purposes of the instant motion to\ndismiss, this Court must accept as true all facts alleged in\nplaintiffs1 complaint.  Plaintiffs allege that DNR orders \"are\nimposed as a matter of course on many STS residents who are\nadmitted to community medical facilities for treatment.\"  Second\nAm. Compl. 5 72.  Thus, for the purposes of this ruling, the\nCourt presumes that plaintiffs will be able to show that existing\nsafeguards are, in fact, inadequate.6\nIII. Claims Relating to Community Placement\nDefendants assert that it is inappropriate to apply the\nYounabera professional judgment standard to decisions concerning\ncommunity placement, and, therefore, that plaintiffs cannot\nestablish a legally tenable theory supporting their claims\nrelating to community placement.  This Court has already\naddressed these arguments in its Ruling on DMR Defendants• Motion\nto Dismiss of February 9, 1996, and in its Ruling on Plaintiffs1\nMotion for Class Certification of July 8, 1996.  As discussed in\n6  The Court notes with some consternation that the\nparties have failed to discuss the import of DMR's Revised\nProtocol for Review of DNR Orders, dated March 27, 1996.  Indeed,\nthe Court became aware of this policy only incidentally.\nHowever, a copy of the policy has now been docketed in this case,\nand the Court intends to consider at future stages of litigation\nthe extent to which the policy affords to plaintiffs all the\nprocess that is due.\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nthose rulings, this Court disagrees with defendants' view of the\nlaw.7\nIV.  Right to Sue For Violations of the Social Security Act\nA.  Analytic Framework\nThis Court has previously explained the current state of the\nanalytic framework applicable to determinations as to whether a\nplaintiff may sue under Section 1983 for violations of a federal\nstatute.  See Ruling on DMR Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, Feb.\n9, 1996, at 19-2 6.  The framework outlined in this Court's\nprevious ruling is summarized below.\nSection 1983 generally provides a cause of action for\nviolations of federal statutes by state and local governmental\nunits, Maine v. Thiboutot   448 U.S. 1, 4 (1980), unless a given\nf\naction falls into one of  two exceptions: (1) cases in which the\nstatute in question does not create an enforceable \"right,\nprivilege or immunity\"; and (2) cases in which such a right\nexists but Congress has foreclosed enforcement of the right under\nSection 1983.  Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment & Housing Auth.\nf\n7  Of course, plaintiffs' claims relating to community\nplacement are not brought against DSS and DPHAS, except to the\nextent that 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(31) and 42 C.F.R. § 456.609\nrequire inspection teams to determine whether it is \"necessary\nand desirable\" that ICF/MR residents' remain in their current\nplacement, and whether it is feasible to meet their needs through\n\"alternative institutional or noninstitutional services.\"  42\nC.F.R. § 456.609.  In this respect, community placement issues\narise to some degree in relation to plaintiffs' claims concerning\ninadequate inspections and lack of \"corrective action\" by DSS in\nresponse to such inspections.  These claims are addressed below.\n10\nAO72A\n\n479 U.S. 418, 423  (1987).\nUnder the first exception, the Supreme Court has held that\nno enforceable right exists if: the statutory provision in\nquestion was not intended to benefit the putative plaintiffs; the\nprovision reflects merely a \"congressional preference\" rather\nthan a \"binding obligation\"; or the plaintiffs1 interest is \"too\nvague and amorphous\" such that it is \"beyond the competence of\nthe judiciary to enforce.\"  Wilder v. Virginia Hosp. Ass'n, 496\nU.S. 498, 509 (1990) (citation omitted).  Moreover, in light of\nSuter v. Artist M.   503 U.S. 347 (1992) and its progeny, courts\nf\nshould strictly enforce the requirement that statutory language\nmust be definite and specific in order to confer an enforceable\nright.  See Marshall v. Swifcser  10 F.3d 925, 929  (2d Cir. 1993)\nf\n(holding that Suter requires definite and specific statutory\nlanguage in order for an alleged violation to be actionable);\nChan v. City of New York, 1 F.3d 96, 104 (2d Cir.)  (same), cert,\ndenied. 510 U.S. 978  (1993).8\nWith respect to the second exception, courts \"[should] not\nlightly conclude that Congress intended to preclude reliance on\n§ 1983 as a remedy for the deprivation of a federally secured\nright.\"  Wilder, 496 U.S. at 520 (citations omitted).  Thus,\ndefendants have the burden of showing \"by express provision or\nother specific evidence from the statute itself that Congress\n8  As noted in this Court's prior decision, this aspect of\nSuter survives Congress's attempt to curtail the impact of Suter\nby passing Pub. L. No. 103-382, 108 Stat. 4057 (codified at 42\nU.S.C. § 1320a-2).\n11\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nintended to foreclose such private enforcement.\"  Id. at 520-21\n(citation omitted).  In the absence of an express provision,\nprivate enforcement may only be deemed to be foreclosed if the\nstatute itself creates a remedial scheme that is \"'sufficiently\ncomprehensive . . . to demonstrate congressional intent to\npreclude the remedy of suits under § 1983.•\"  Id. at 521 (quoting\nMiddlesex County Sewerage Auth. v. National Sea Clammers Ass'n,\n453 U.S. 1, 20  (1981)).\nB.  Statutory Scheme\nThe Social Security Act requires that every state\nparticipating in Medicaid must provide in its state plan, with\nrespect to each intermediate care facility for the mentally\nretarded  (\"ICF/MR\") :\n(A) with respect to each patient . . . for a regular  \"\nprogram of independent professional review  (including\nmedical evaluation) which shall periodically review his\nneed for [] services.\n(B) with respect to each [ICF/MR] within the State, for\nperiodic onsite inspections of the care being provided\nto each person receiving medical assistance, by one or\nmore independent professional review teams (composed of\na physician or registered nurse and other appropriate\nhealth and social service personnel), including with\nrespect to each such person (i) the adequacy of the\nservices available to meet his current health needs and\npromote his maximum physical well-being, (ii) the\nnecessity and desirability of his continued placement\nin the facility, and (iii) the feasibility of meeting\nhis health care needs through alternative institutional\nor noninstitutional services; and\n(C) for full reports to the State agency by each\nindependent professional review team of the findings of\neach inspection under subparagraph  (B), together with\nany recommendations.\n12\nAO72A\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a) (31) .\nPursuant to the statute, HHS has promulgated extensive\nregulations governing such \"individual review\" (\"IR\") inspections.\nThese regulations set forth specific requirements as to the make-\nup of the inspection team, 42 C.F.R. §§ 456.602-456.604; provide\nthat inspections of each facility must be conducted at least\nannually, 42 C.F.R. § 456.606; provide that no facility may be\nnotified of an inspection more than 48 hours prior to the\ninspection, 42 C.F.R. § 456.607; and require inspection teams to\nhave personal contact with each ICF/MR resident and to personally\nreview each patient's record, 42 C.F.R. § 456.608.  In addition,\nthe regulations provide that:\nThe team must determine in its inspection whether  —\n(a) The services available in the facility are adequate\nto  —\n(1) Meet the health needs [] and the\nrehabilitative and social needs of each\nrecipient in an ICF; and\n(2) Promote his maximum physical, mental and .\npsychological functioning.\n(b) It is necessary and desirable for the recipient to\nremain in the facility;\n(c) It is feasible to meet the recipient's health needs\n[and] rehabilitative needs through alternative\ninstitutional or noninstitutional services; and\n(d) Each recipient . ..  is receiving active treatment\nas defined in § 441.154 of this subchapter.\n42 C.F.R. § 456.609.\nIn making the above-described determinations, the\nregulations state that an inspection team may consider patients'\n13\nAO72A\n\nmedical, social and psychological evaluations and plans of care;\nthe frequency with which attending physicians review prescribed\nmedications; the frequency with which residents are tested and\nobserved; the consistency with which notes are recorded\nconcerning patients; patients' cleanliness, bedsores,\nmalnutrition, dehydration or absence thereof; residents'\nmaintenance of physical, mental and psychosocial function; the\nextent to which a planned program of activities to prevent\nregression is implemented and the extent to which there is\nprogress toward stated objectives; whether a resident needs any\nservice that is not being furnished; and whether a resident\nrequires continued placement in the ICF/MR or there exists a plan\nto transfer the resident elsewhere.  42 C.F.R. § 456.10.\nThe inspection team must promptly submit a report, 42 C.F.R.\n§ 456.11, and DSS must then \"take corrective action as needed\nbased on the report and recommendations of the team.\"  42 C.F.R.\n§ 456.13.  Although the term \"corrective action\" is not defined\nunder 42 C.F.R. § 456, the meaning of the term is explicated by\nother statutory and regulatory provisions.  Specifically, 42\nU.S.C. § 1396a provides in relevant part:\n(i)  Termination of certification for participation of\nand suspension of state payments to [ICF/MR units].\n(1) In addition to any other authority under State\nlaw, where a State determines that [an ICF/MR] which is\ncertified for participation under its plan no longer\nsubstantially meets the requirements for such a\nfacility under this subchapter and further determines\nthat the facility's deficiencies  —\n(A) immediately jeopardize the health\n14\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nand safety of its patients, the State shall\nprovide for the termination of the facility's\ncertification for participation under the\nplan and may provide, or\n(B) do not immediately jeopardize the\nhealth and safety of its patients, the State\nmay, in lieu of providing for terminating the\nfacility's certification under the plan,\nprovide\nthat no payment will be made under the State plan with\nrespect to any individual admitted to such facility\nafter a date specified by the State.\n(2) The State shall not make such a decision with\nrespect to a facility until the facility has had ..a.\nreasonable opportunity  [] to correct its deficiencies\n[and] reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing.\n(3) The State's decision to deny payment may be\nmade effective only after such notice to the public and\nto the facility  . . .\n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(i).  Pursuant to this statutory provision, 42\nC.F.R. §§ 442.117 - 442.119 provide as follows:\n§ 442.117 Termination of certification for ICFs/MR\nwhose deficiencies pose immediate  jeopardy.\n(a) A survey agency must terminate a facility's\ncertification if it determines that  —\n(1) The facility no longer meets\nconditions of participation for ICFs/MR as\nspecified in subpart I of part 483 of this\nchapter[; and]\n(2) The facility's deficiencies pose\nimmediate jeopardy to residents' health and\nsafety.\n(b) Subsequent to a certification of a facility's\nnoncompliance, the Medicaid agency must, in terminating\nthe provider agreement, follow the appeals process\nspecified in part 431, subpart D of this chapter.\n15\nAO72A\n\n§ 442.118 Denial of payments for new admissions to an\nICF/MR\n(a) Basis for denial of payments.  The Medicaid\nagency may deny payment for new admissions to an ICF/MR\nthat no longer meets the applicable conditions of\nparticipation [in 42 C.F.R. § 483 et seq.].\n(b) Agency  procedures.  Before denying payments\nfor new admissions, the Medicaid agency must comply\nwith the following requirements:\n(1) Provide the facility up to 60 days\nto correct the cited deficiencies and comply\nwith conditions of participation for ICFs/MR.\n(2) If at the end of the specified\nperiod the facility has not achieved\ncompliance, give the facility notice of\nintent to deny payment for new admissions,\nand opportunity for an informal hearing.\n(3) If the facility requests a hearing,\nprovide an informal hearing that includes  —\n(i) The opportunity for the\nfacility to present, before a State\nMedicaid official who was not in-\nvolved in making the initial de-\ntermination, evidence or document-\nation, in writing or in person, to\nrefute the decision that the faci-\nlity is out of compliance with the\nconditions of participation for\nICFs/MR.\n(ii) A written decision set-\nting forth the factual and legal\nbases pertinent to a resolution of\nthe dispute.\n(4) If the decision of the informal\nhearing is to deny payments for new\nadmissions, provide the facility and the\npublic, at least 15 days before the effective\ndate of the sanction, with a notice that\nincludes the effective date and the reasons\nfor the denial of payments.\n16\nAC 7?A\n\n§ 442.119 Duration of denial of payments and subsequent\ntermination of an ICF/KR.\n(a) Period  of denial.  The denial of payments for new\nadmissions will continue for 11 months after the month\nit was imposed unless, before the end of that period,\nthe Medicaid agency finds that  —\n(1) The facility has corrected the\ndeficiencies or is making a good faith effort\nto achieve compliance with the conditions of\nparticipation for ICFs/MR; or\n(2) The deficiencies are such that it is\nnecessary to terminate the facility's\nprovider agreement.\n(b)  Subsequent  termination.  The Medicaid agency must\nterminate a facility's provider agreement  —\n(1) Upon the agency's finding that the\nfacility has been unable to achieve\ncompliance with the conditions of\nparticipation for ICFs/MR during the period\nthat payments for new admissions have been\ndenied;\n(2) Effective the day following the last\nday of the denial of payments period; and\n(3) In accordance with the procedures\nfor appeal of terminations set forth in\nsubpart D of part 431 of this chapter.\n42 C.F.R. §§ 442.117 - 442.119.  Moreover, as may be inferred\nfrom the above regulations, 42 C.F.R. §§ 431.151 - 431.154 set\nforth extensive appeal procedures which a state must follow in\nthe course of terminating ICF/MR provider agreements.\nC.  Analysis\nPlaintiffs contend that DSS has failed to carry out its duty\nto take corrective action as set forth by the statutory scheme,\nand plaintiffs seek relief for such violations under Section\n17\nAO72A\n\n1983.  Defendants, while not admitting that any violations have\noccurred, challenge plaintiffs1 right to sue under Section 1983\nfor DSS' alleged failure to take corrective action.9  Defendants\nadmit that plaintiffs possess a right to sue for alleged\nviolations of DSS1 duty to carry out IR inspections.10\nDefendants assert that DSS' duty to take \"corrective action\"\nfalls into the first Wilder exception.  This Court disagrees.\nFirst, the Court finds that those plaintiffs who are ICF/MR\nresidents are the intended beneficiaries of the \"corrective\naction\" requirement,  gilder, 496 U.S. at 509.  Second, the\nstatutory scheme clearly imposes a binding obligation upon\nparticipating states, rather than merely stating a congressional\n9  The Court concurs with plaintiffs that the Second\nCircuit's decision in Hillburn v. Maher  795 F.2d 252 (2d Cir.\nf\n1986), cert, denied, 479 U.S. 1046 (1987) substantially supports\nthe right of plaintiffs to sue for violations of 42 C.F.R.\n§ 456.613.  In Hillburn, the appellate court upheld the district\ncourt's injunction, in which the district court had relied on the\n\"corrective action\" clause of Section 456.613 to require the\nConnecticut Department of Income Maintenance  (now DSS) to consult\nwith officials at skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) found to have\ndeficiencies, and to terminate provider agreements of SNFs unable\nto cure the deficiencies after consultation.  795 F.2d at 260-61.\nHowever, because Hillburn was decided prior to Wilder and Suter,\nand neither the district court nor the appellate court directly\naddressed plaintiffs' right to sue, this Court does not find\nHillburn to be entirely dispositive.  The Court therefore\nundertakes the following analysis of plaintiffs' right to sue.\n10  Although defendants assert only that the statutory\nscheme \"at best [confers] a right upon plaintiffs to have the\nsubject inspections take place,\" Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss at 35,\ndefendants make no arguments explicitly or implicitly tending to\nshow that a right to sue for inspections does not exist.\nMoreover, this Court finds that the statutory and regulatory\nprovisions setting forth the inspection requirements easily\nsatisfy the requirements of Wilder and Suter.\n18\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\npreference.  Wilder. 496 U.S. at 509.  SS& 42 C.F.R. § 456.613\n(\"The agency must take corrective action . . .\") .\nThird, even if the corrective action provision is viewed\nthrough the strict lens of Suter, it is not \"too vague and\namorphous\" such that it would be \"beyond the competence of the\njudiciary to enforce.\"  Wilder, 496 U.S. at 509.  Defendants\nassert that the term \"corrective action\" is in fact too vague for\nthe judiciary to enforce, because it is not explained under 42\nC.F.R. § 456.613.  However, as set forth above, the statutory\nscheme as a whole leaves little doubt as to the meaning of\ncorrective action.  Most significantly, the scheme requires DSS\nto terminate a facility's provider agreement upon a finding of\ndeficiencies, such as those alleged by plaintiffs in the instant\ncase, which jeopardize the health and safety of ICF/MR\nresidents.n\nDefendants point to an opinion by a federal district court\n11  The statutory scheme gives DSS some discretion as to\nwhether to deny payment for new admissions upon a finding of\nlesser deficiencies.  See 42 C.F.R. § 442.118 (\"The Medicaid\nagency may deny payment for new admissions . . .\") .  However, the\nobligatory language of the corrective action provision clearly\nindicates that DSS is required to take some enforcement action,\nup to and including denial of payments for new admissions, in\nresponse to less serious deficiencies.  If this Court were to\ndetermine that deficiencies exist but are not so serious as to\njeopardize the health and safety of ICF/MR residents, and that\nDSS has taken some corrective action in response to such lesser\ndeficiencies, then the Court might very well determine that\nplaintiffs cannot require denial of payments for new admissions.\nHowever, recognition of this small amount of discretion in no way\nrenders the corrective action provision too vague for judicial\nenforcement, particularly in a case in which plaintiffs allege\ndeficiencies which threaten the health and safety of residents.\n19\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nin the Southern District of Ohio, Martin v. Voinovich  840 F.\nf\nSupp. 1175 (S.D. Ohio 1993).  In that decision, apparently the\nonly one by any court directly considering whether plaintiffs may\nsue under Section 1983 for violation of 42 C.F.R. § 456.613, the\ndistrict court found that:\nSection 456.613 does not explain the meaning of \"take\ncorrective action,\" and there is no guidance as to the\nmeaning of the phrase elsewhere in the code or statute.\nIt does not explain, for instance, whether taking\ncorrective action means the State agency must adopt to\nthe letter every recommendation made by the team, or\nwhether the agency is merely required to consider the\nteam's recommendation in deciding what action to take.\n[] This provision also fails to give guidance as to\nwhen the corrective action must occur.  Must it occur\nimmediately, or may the State devise a long term plan\nof corrective action based on its limited resources?\nPlaintiffs do not have a claim under this provision\nbecause it offers no guidance on these basic questions.\n840 F. Supp. at 1196-97.  However, the district court failed to\nconsider the extensive regulations discussed above governing the\ncorrective actions that a Medicaid agency is required to and\npermitted to take.  For this reason, this Court disagrees with\nthe finding of the Voinovich court.  As discussed previously, the\nstatutory scheme affords this Court a substantial basis for\ndetermining whether DSS has satisfied its legal duty to take\ncorrective action, particularly given that plaintiffs allege\ndeficiencies which endanger the health and safety of ICF/MR\nresidents.12\n12  The regulations setting forth DSS's duties and powers\nto take corrective action fall under 42 C.F.R. § 442, which\nrelates to certification of ICFs/MR.  In Connecticut, such\ncertification is typically conducted via facility inspections by\nDPHAS.  These facility inspections are separate and distinct from\n20\nAO72A\n\nHaving found that each of the three elements set forth under\nthe first Wilder exception points toward finding an enforceable\nright to sue, the Court lastly examines the second exception set\nforth under Wilder —  whether Congress has foreclosed enforcement\nof the right under Section 1983.  As noted previously, a court\nmay only conclude -that Congress has intended to preclude suit\nunder Section 1983 if the statute in question either includes an\nexpress provision to that effect or creates a remedial scheme\nsufficiently comprehensive so as to indicate Congress's intent.\nWilder. 496 U.S. at 520-21.\nIn the instant case, the provisions of the Social Security\nAct at issue contain no express provision foreclosing suit and\nprovide no remedial scheme by which ICF/MR residents may petition\nto obtain greater services or to force a Medicaid agency to take\ncorrective action to cure deficiencies.  Indeed, the only\nremedial measure established by the statutory scheme, other than\nthose at issue in this case, is withdrawal of funding by HHS for\nthe IR inspections conducted by DSS.  It is unclear to the Court\nwhether plaintiffs assert violations by DPHAS of its facility\ninspection duties.  Indeed, the State itself, in its briefs,\nconflated the IR inspection process with the facility inspection\nprocess, finally clarifying the distinction at oral argument.  If\nplaintiffs in fact assert violations of DPHAS1 inspection duties\nin addition to DSS' inspection duties, then plaintiffs must\npromptly seek to amend their complaint to reflect this\ndistinction.  However, whether or not plaintiffs assert such\nviolations by DPHAS, the statutory scheme clearly requires DSS to\ntake the corrective actions outlined in 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(i) and\n42 C.F.R. §§ 442.117 - 442.119 upon a finding of deficiencies\nfound pursuant to either DPHAS1 facility inspections ox DSS's IR\ninspections.  See § 1396a(i) (establishing corrective mechanisms\napplicable \"where a State determines that [an ICF/MR] no longer\nsubstantially meets the requirements for such a facility\") .\n21\nAO72A\n\nnon-compliance with program conditions.  42 u.S.C. § 1396i(b).\nIn Wilder, the Supreme Court found that an analogous remedial\nmeasure authorizing HHS to withdraw funds for non-compliance in\nno way indicated Congressional intent to foreclose suit under\nSection 1983.  496 U.S. at 521-22.\nThus, neither of the exceptions set forth under Wilder are\napplicable in the instant case, meaning that plaintiffs may\nvalidly sue under Section 198 3 for alleged violations of a\nMedicaid agency's failure to take corrective action upon a\nfinding of deficiencies in ICF/MR units.  Presuming the facts\nalleged in plaintiffs' complaint to be true, plaintiffs' Section\n1983 action clearly states a claim upon which relief can be\ngranted.\nSUMMARY\nFor the foregoing reasons, defendants' Motion to Dismiss\n[Doc. No. 82] is denied.\nSO ORDERED.  *'\nELLEN BREE BURNS, SENIOR JUDGE\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nft\nDated at New Haven, Connecticut, this */ \"day of September, 1996,\n22\nAO72A\n'Rev  fl/8?i",

Following both \nlitigation activities and negotiations regarding a remedy, the parties have reached a Settlement \nAgreement for which this Notice is issued. \nBy Ruling dated July 8, 1996 the District Court certified a \"plaintiff class to include all \ncurrent STS residents, persons who might be placed at STS in the future, and persons who were \ntransferred from STS but remain under the control of the STS Director.\" Memorandum, at 1. \nSince new admissions to STS were closed via District Court Order in 1986, and via state statute \nin 1997, and since no person transferred from STS remains \"under the control of the STS \nDirector\", this Settlement Agreement is directed toward the individuals who are residents of STS \nat the time of approval by the District Court. \nThe major components of the Settlement Agreement include the following: \n\n-. \nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1038   Filed 07/15/10   Page 4 of 5\n1.  The training of relevant Interdisciplinary Team (IDT) staff regarding the exercise of \n\"professional  judgment\"  in  recommending  the  \"most  integrated  setting\" \ncommensurate with a class member's needs. \n2.

No. 3:94-CV-1706 (EBB) \nSOUTHBURY TRAINING SCHOOL, et al. \nDefendants. \nL  , IMPLEME \nPending before the Court in this class action is a motion pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e) \nfor an order approving the proposed settlement agreement filed by the parties on July 12, 2010. \nIn addition, the parties have moved for an order requiring the plaintiffs to file their claims for \ncosts and fees within sixty days of this Order. \nFor the following reasons, the Court finds that the proposed settlement agreement is fair, \nadequate and reasonable and accordingly grants the motion. \nBackground \nOn July 8, 1996, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b), the court certified the \nplaintiff class to include all current residents of Southbury Training School (\"STS\"), persons who \nmight be placed at STS in the future, and persons who were transferred from STS, but remain \nunder the control of the STS Director. 1  The defendants are STS, the Director of STS, and the \nCommissioner of the Connecticut Department of Developmental Services (\"DDS\") (formerly \n(Because new admissions to STS were closed by court order in 1986 and thereafter by \nstate statute in 1997, and because there is no longer any person transferred from STS who \nremains under the control of the STS Director, the class members who are bound by the \nsettlement agreement are the individuals who are residents of STS at the time the Court enters \nthis order approving the settlement agreement.  Currently there are approximately 445 class \nmembers residing at STS. \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1054   Filed 11/18/10   Page 2 of 28\nknown as the Department of Mental Retardation).} \nIn their class action complaint, the plaintiffs' alleged, inter alia, that STS and DDS \nviolated their constitutional and statutory rights by failing to exercise professional judgment in \nmaking decisions about whether class members should be placed in the community rather than at \nSTS. \nAfter a lengthy trial, the Court, on June 5, 2008, issued an order resolving the case on the \nissue of liability.  See generally, Me  ier.  uthbury Training  chool, 562 F. Supp.2d 294 (D. \nConn. 2008).  Specifically,  the Court found the plaintiffs had established that the defendants \n\"failed adequately to provide for the evaluation of all class members for community placement \nand had failed to place in the community class members for whom such placement was found to \nbe appropriate by the defendants' treatment professionals and who had consented to or requested \nsuch placement either through their guardians or, where appropriate, themselves.\" !1L at 335-45. \nIn order to fashion an appropriate remedy to address the deficiencies identified by the \nCourt, a hearing on remedies was ordered at which the defendants were to present data as to \nplacements made by them since the date of the trial and set forth the procedures they would \nimplement to assure future placements would be appropriately made.  Id .. at 345. \nAfter a lengthy discovery period, a hearing on remedies commenced on February 16, \n2010.  After five days of evidence, the parties began earnest and extensive settlement discussions \nunder the supervision of the Hon. Joan Margolis, U.S.MJ., and the hearing on remedies was \nadjourned.  The negotiation process was often difficult and contentious.  Nonetheless, during the \n2In 2007, the Department of Mental Retardation was renamed the Department of \nDevelopmental Services. \n2 \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1054   Filed 11/18/10   Page 3 of 28\ndiscussions the parties exchanged numerous drafts of proposed settlement agreements and were \nultimately successful in their efforts to resolve the issues.  On May 12,2010 they jointly filed \ntheir proposed settlement agreement along with a motion seeking  its preliminary approval, an \norder requiring notice to the class, and for a fairness hearing.  On July 15, 2010, the Court \nentered an order preliminarily approving the proposed settlement agreement, directed notice of \nthe settlement be given to the class, and scheduled a fairness hearing.  The Court also authorized \ninterested persons to file comments by September 20,2010. \n3 \nA Fairness Hearing was held on October 4, 2010.\nSummary of the Proposed Settlement \nThe settlement agreement requires the defendants to address the constitutional and \nstatutory violations that the Court identified in its ruling on liability.  In particular, it adequately \naddresses the defendants' duty to exercise professional judgment in determining the most \nintegrated setting for class members and the appropriateness of community placement for each of \nthem as well as the defendants' obligation to ensure that class members, guardians and family \nmembers have sufficient information to make informed decisions.  Quite properly, it makes no \nprovision regarding the closing or possible closing of STS, it does not contain any provision \ncalling for the transfer of all STS residents to community settings and it does not provide for the \nautomatic return of class members to STS, as none of these issues were before the Court in this \naction. \nAs the agreement states, its purpose \"is to assure that the department and its staff commit \n3Familiarity with the underlying proceedings, facts and issues is presumed.  For a full \naccount, reference may be had to the numerous rulings, opinions and orders issued by this Court \nover the course of this lengthy litigation. \n3 \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1054   Filed 11/18/10   Page 4 of 28\nthat each class member has the opportunity to have an assessment of the supports that would be \nneeded to live successfully in a community setting; to assure that the class member, guardian, \ninvolved family member, or other personal representative, has sufficient infonnation to make an \ninfonned decision about the merits of community placement to meet the particular needs of the \nclass member including the status of programs and services at STS and to ensure that infonnation \nwill be provided to each class member and hislher guardian to enable them to make an infonned \nchoice as to an integrated setting and transition to an appropriate community setting within a \nreasonable time after professional judgment has been exercised by the IDT.  It is recognized that \nthe ultimate decision about residence rests with the guardian unless the department believes that \nthis legal representative is not making decisions in the best interest of the class member.\" \n4 \nMore specifically, the salient provisions of the settlement agreement provide for (1 ) \ntraining of Interdisciplinary Team (IDT) staff members regarding the exercise of \"professional \njudgment\" that they must use in recommending the \"most integrated setting\" commensurate with \neach class member's needs; (2) implementing, after training, the process for recommending the \n\"most integrated setting\" based on the professional judgment of the IDT; (3) providing \ninfonnation to residents, guardians and families about, and exposure to, community-based \nalternatives to assure that infonned choices are made; (4) recognizing in DDS policy that the \nconcept of \"portabililty\" - the re-allocation of funding from STS and from any publicly operated \nICF/MR to the DDS Regions to support community-based alternatives - applies to STS residents \nand residents of publicly operated ICF/MR facilities; (5) exercising professional judgment in \n4All of the provisions of the settlement agreement, which is attached hereto as \nAttachment A, are fully incorporated herein and are made part of this Order. \n4 \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1054   Filed 11/18/10   Page 5 of 28\nassessing, evaluating and recommending community transition services and support; (6) planning \nfor transition and identifying and developing resources for STS residents for whom there is a \nprofessional judgment/recommendation that the individual can be supported in a more integrated \nsetting and for whom informed consent to community placement has been provided by the \nresident or guardian; (7) transitioning STS residents to the community placement including \nestablishing time lines for effecting transition; (8) retaining a \"Remedial Expert\" to assist in the \ntraining curriculum, the lOT process, the informational efforts and in effecting the community \nplacement of STS residents for whom the lOT has recommended community placement and the \nresident or guardian does not oppose such recommendation; and (9) providing for regular \nmeetings of the parties and the Remedial Expert to assess progress under the terms of the \nsettlement agreement and for resolving disputes associated with the settlement agreement. \nIn addition, the settlement agreement requires the defendants to discontinue the use of the \nEMPOWER policy and the Quarterly Assessment of Choice Process.  Further, it emphasizes that \nlOTs and STS residents and their families or guardians must discuss and determine the \"most \nintegrated setting\"S for each class member as well as the community services and supports that \nwould be needed to enable them to live successfully in the community.  It also provides for the \nappointment of advocates for STS residents who request them as well as in situations where the \nfamily or guardian is not willing to participate in the community placement process.  Overall, the \nprovisions of the settlement agreement are designed to ensure that guardians, family members, \nadvocates and class members will have the necessary information about community placements \nSThe term \"most integrated setting\" is defined in a manner consistent with federal law and \nthe ruling of this Court as the setting that enables individuals with disabilities to interact with \nnon-disabled persons to \"the fullest extent possible.\" \n5 \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1054   Filed 11/18/10   Page 6 of 28\n(including the option to visit potential placements) they will need to be fully infonned and able to \nmake an infonned choice to ensure that the needs of class members will be fully addressed in \ncommunity placements. \nIn sum, the settlement agreement fully addresses the violations of law that the Court \niterated in its ruling on liability and its implementation will bring the defendants into compliance \nwith the law. \nStandard for Evaluating the Proposed Settlement \nPursuant to Rule 23(e), Fed.R.Civ.P., a class action cannot be dismissed or compromised \nwithout court approval.  Consequently, this Court is charged with the responsibility of closely \nand carefully scrutinizing the settlement agreement to detennine its fairness, adequacy and \nreasonableness.  County of Suffolk v.  Long Is. Lighting Co., 907 F.2d 1295, 1323 (2d Cir. \n1990); Plummer v. Chern. Bank, 668 F.2d 654,658 (2d Cir.1982).  A class action settlement \nmust be both procedurally and substantively fair and reasonable.  D' Amato v. Deutsche Bank, \n236 F .3d 78, 85 (2d Cir. 2001). \nRule 23(e)(I) requires the Court to find that appropriate notice was provided to the class \nmembers who will be bound by the settlement.  The court also must consider (1) the substantive \ntenns of the settlement compared to the likely result of a trial and (2) the negotiating process, \nexamined in light of the experience of counsel, the vigor with which the case was litigated and \nthe coercion or collusion that may have marred the negotiations.  Malchman v. Davis, 706 F.2d \n426,433 (2d Cir. 1983).  In conducting that analysis, there are nine Grinnell factors that are \ncommonly considered:  (1) the complexity, expense and likely duration of the litigation; (2) the \nreaction of the class to the settlement; (3) the stage of the proceedings and the amount of \n6 \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1054   Filed 11/18/10   Page 7 of 28\ndiscovery completed; (4) the risks of establishing liability; (5) the risks of establishing damages; \n(6) the risks of maintaining the class action through the trial; (7) the ability of the defendants to \nwithstand a greater judgment; (8) the range of reasonableness of the settlement in light of the best \npossible recovery; and (9) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund to a possible \nrecovery in light of all the attendant risks oflitigation.  City of Detroit v. Grinnell Corp., 495 \nF.2d 448, 463 (2d Cir. 1974).  Here, the Court will only consider the relevant Grinnell factors \nand not those that concern maintenance of class certification, the risks of establishing liability \nand damages, the defendants' ability to withstand a greater judgment, and the reasonableness of \nthe settlement fund, as they are not relevant in the current posture of this case. \nFinally, the Court notes that \"Rule 23(e) does not give a district court the power to \nmodify a proposed settlement agreement or require parties to accept a settlement to which they \nall have not agreed.\"  Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U.S. 717, 726 (1986).  A court \"should approve or \ndisapprove a proposed agreement as it is placed before [her] and should not take it upon [herself] \nto modify its terms.\"  In re Warner Commc'ns Sec. Litig., 798 F.2d 35, 37 (2d Cir. 1986).  In \nother words, the \"settlement must stand or fall as a whole.\" =Bc:...ro=o=k~~=-=-:.=-=.;:=-=:..=-===:..:\",-=. \n59 F.3d 1114, 1119 (11th Cir. 1995). \nReasons for the Court's Approval of the Settlement \nAs noted, the Court has given due consideration to the relevant factors and finds the \nsettlement agreement to be procedurally and substantively fair, adequate and reasonable in all \nrespects. \nA.  Notice \nAdequate notice, in the manner directed by the Court in its preliminary order and in full \n7 \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1054   Filed 11/18/10   Page 8 of 28\ncompliance with the requirements of Rule 23, was given to the class members who would be \nbound.  The form and manner of the notice was the best notice practicable under the \ncircumstances.  It precisely defined the class, clearly informed class members of the nature of the \ncase, explained the material terms of the settlement such as \"professional judgment,\" \n\"community placement,\" and \"informed consent,\" and fairly apprised the class members of the \nsubstance ofthe proposed settlement and the options open to them to present their objections and \nconcerns.  In sum, the notice clearly comported with due process. \nThe notice was mailed to class members on July 23,2010 and copies of it were published \nin six newspapers on July 23,2010, fourteen days before the comment period was initially \nscheduled to close and twenty-eight days before the original date of the fairness hearing.  At the \nrequest of several guardians, the Court extended the deadline for submitting comments to \nSeptember 28, 2010, and the date of the fairness hearing to October 4, 2010.  Defendants \nprovided notice to the class of these changes and class members had sufficient time to prepare for \nthe hearing. \nThe Court has received proof of the mailing of the notice and all class members and other \ninterested parties have been given an opportunity to be heard.  No person or organization has \nchallenged the adequacy of the form and content of the notice \nB.  The Negotiation Process \nThe settlement agreement is the result of arms-length negotiations conducted by \nexperienced, competent and zealous counsel with the assistance of an experienced and able \nmediator who helped ensure that the proceedings were free of conflicts of interest and undue \npressure. \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1054   Filed 11/18/10   Page 9 of 28\nPlaintiffs' lead counsel has a great deal of experience in similar federal class action \nlitigation.  U, C.A.R.C. v. Thome, No. H-78-653(TEC); P.J. v. State of Conn., No. \n2:91cvI80(RNC); ARC/CT v. O'Meara, 3:01cvI871(JBA); Hillburn v. Maher, 795 \nF.2d 252 (2d Cir. 1986).  Counsel for the organizational plaintiffs also have considerable \nexperience litigating and resolving complex civil rights cases on behalf of individuals with \nsevere disabilities. \nThe settlement was reached after sufficient discovery had been completed, including an \nexpert tour of STS, depositions of defendants' experts and administrators and examination of the \nfiles of STS residents who had been referred for community placement, all of which enabled the \nplaintiffs to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of their positions. \nThe Court is satisfied that the settlement agreement is the product of arm's length \nnegotiations that were aimed at providing effective relief to class members and was free from \ncollusion or other factors that might taint the fairness of the settlement to the class as a whole. \nC.  Complexity, Expense & Likely Duration of the Litigation \nTo date, the litigation has been especially costly.  If the settlement had not been reached, \nthe costs would only escalate.  As noted, the action involved complex factual and legal issues and \nwas actively prosecuted over many years.  The parties invested considerable resources in the case \nthrough data collection, litigation efforts, and settlement negotiations.  The trial on liability alone \ntook 123 days and there was extensive post-trial briefing after the close of evidence. As the \ndocket reflects, after the Court ruled on liability and prior to the commencement of the hearing \non remedies, the parties engaged in extensive discovery and motion practice.  Completing the \nhearing on damages would have added considerable costs, especially when considering the \n9 \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1054   Filed 11/18/10   Page 10 of 28\nnecessary post-hearing briefing and argument.  Moreover, in the absence of settlement, it is likely \nthat appeals would be taken from the Court's remedial orders, and this would further delay relief \nto the class members and would increase the costs substantially. \nIt is clear that, by negotiating and reaching the settlement, counsel avoided the likelihood \nof further complex, lengthy and expensive proceedings.  Given this, acceptance of the settlement \nat this stage is appropriate. \nD.  Reaction of the Class \nAfter dissemination of the notice to the class, the Court received comments from families \nor guardians of seventy-one of the 445 current residents of STS.  There were no specific \nobjections to the actual terms of the settlement agreement.  The majority ofthe comments \nexpressed concern that STS may be closed and that class members may be forced to move out of \nSTS over the objection of their guardians or family members.  At the fairness hearing, many \nguardians and family members addressed the Court and voiced these concerns. \nMore specifically, comments made by the families or guardians of six current STS \nresidents approved the settlement agreement and/or stated that they would consider community \nplacement.  Comments made on behalfofforty-nine class members either opposed community \nplacement in general, opposed community placement if the class member's guardian or family \nobjected, opposed closing STS, and wanted the settlement agreement to provide for automatic \nreadmission to STS if community placement for class members did not work out.  Comments \nmade on behalf of sixteen class members expressed similar concerns, i.e., opposing the closing of \nSTS; the necessity for including a provision in the agreement providing that guardians or family \nmembers would have unfettered discretion to have their wards readmitted to STS if community \n10 \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1054   Filed 11/18/10   Page 11 of 28\nplacement did not work out; the necessity for including a provision in the settlement agreement \nclarifying and specifying that guardians or family members would make the final decision about \ncommunity placement; the necessity for including a provision in the settlement agreement that \nspecifically provides that STS may be designated as the most integrated setting; and the necessity \nfor including a provision in the settlement agreement requiring that the health needs of each class \nmember be appropriately addressed during the placement process.  In addition to these \ncomments, the family of one class member objected to the settlement agreement as being too \nvague and another family strongly objected to the agreement because they did not want their \nrelative to leave STS. \nNone of these comments, concerns, or omissions detract from the reasonableness, \nadequacy and overall fairness of the settlement agreement vis-a-vis the majority of class \nmembers and thus do not require the Court to disapprove the settlement agreement. \nSpecifically, the comments concerning the need for additions or modifications to the \nterms of the settlement agreement are untenable because the Court does not have the power or \nauthority to make changes or additions to the parties' agreement.  Evans, 475 U.S. at 726-27.  In \nother words, the Court cannot order the settlement agreement be amended to provide, for \nexample, that STS may be designated \"the most integrated setting\" for a class member6 or that \nSTS will remain open.  In sum, the concerns about, inter alia, closing STS, returning class \nmembers to STS if community placement does not work out and mandating community \n6Indeed, such a provision would run counter to the Court's specific finding that STS is \nnot an integrated setting, but \"is a segregated institution in which all residents are mentally \ndisabled.\"  Messier, 562 F. Supp.2d at 326.  In any event, such a provision is not necessary \nbecause the agreement provides that an IDT may determine that community placement is not an \nappropriate placement for a particular individual. \n11 \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1054   Filed 11/18/10   Page 12 of 28\nplacement over the objection of guardians or family members are unfounded and specific \nlanguage in the settlement agreement addressing these issues is not necessary. \nFirst, there is nothing in the settlement agreement that expressly or impliedly provides for \nthe closing of STS.  Closing STS was never an issue in this case. \nSecond, there are a number of provisions in the settlement agreement which will ensure \nthat class members will not be placed in the community over the objection of guardians or family \nmembers.  The agreement expressly makes it clear that guardians and family members are the \nprimary decision makers with regard to community placement and are the ones who will decide \nwhether to accept or reject a proposed community placement.  Only in exceptional cases will a \nguardian'S ultimate control over the decision be challenged, i.e., where a guardian is not involved \nin the decision making or where the views of class members and/or the medical judgments of \nSTS professionals are ignored.  But these exceptions would apply only in rare cases and thus the \nabsence of such a specific provision does not warrant disapproval of the settlement agreement. \nThird, it is also unnecessary for the settlement agreement to include a provision requiring \nthe community placement plan to contain specific identification of and access to comparable \nmedical care for each class member in the community placement.  The agreement has numerous \nprovisions requiring identification and development of resources that will be needed to meet the \nclass members' needs and allowing guardians or family members to oppose community \nplacement if the medical and other needs of class members are not adequately addressed. \nFourth, the absence of a provision guaranteeing the automatic return of class members to \nSTS from an unsuccessful community placement does not require disapproval of the settlement \nagreement.  Although the settlement agreement is silent on the issue of readmission, it contains \n12 \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1054   Filed 11/18/10   Page 13 of 28\nnumerous provisions that would adequately address the issue in the rare event it were to arise, not \n7 \nto mention the existing DOS policies and state laws that could come into play, e.g., Conn. Gen. \nStat. § 17a-210 (providing for a formal hearing process when necessary to address transfer \nissues).  The Court is satisfied that the agreement's provisions requiring the defendants to \nidentify and meet the needs of class members during the transition to community living will be \nsufficient to ensure that this issue will rarely, if ever, arise, but in the unlikely event it should, the \nRemedial Expert will be there to take appropriate action to remedy the situation. \nFinally, the appointment of a Remedial Expert is an important safeguard of the rights of \nclass members.  That individual will be responsible for determining whether the concerns of \nfamily members, guardians, advocates and class members are addressed and met and he is \nexpressly authorized to take appropriate action to ensure that the defendants meet those needs, \nincluding resort to the Court.  The Remedial Expert will ensure full implementation of the \nsettlement agreement, including proper training and education for STS staff and professionals; \nthe exercise of professional judgment and informed choices and consent in the placement \nprocess; the appropriate transition to community settings; and implementation of dispute \nresolution procedures. \nIn sum, the settlement agreement requires the defendants to fully address the violations of \nthe rights of class members that the Court identified in its decision of the merits.  See Messier v. \nSouthbury Training School, 562 F. Supp.2d 294 (D. Conn. 2008).  Accordingly, the Court orders \nthat the Settlement Agreement be implemented in accordance with its terms and provisions. \n7While not part of the settlement agreement, the Court understands that DDS has a policy \nproviding for readmission in such circumstances. \n13 \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1054   Filed 11/18/10   Page 14 of 28\nContinuing Court Jurisdiction \nAs stipulated by the parties, the Court will retain jurisdiction over this case to resolve \ndisputes and enter appropriate orders to insure the implement of all provisions of the \nsettlement agreement. \nApplication for Fees and Costs \nThe Court orders the plaintiffs to file their motion for costs and attorneys' fees within \nsixty days of this order approving the settlement agreement.

No.3 :94-CY-1706(EBB) \nv. \nSOUTHBURY TRAINING SCHOOL  May 25, 2010 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nINTRODUCTION \nThis Settlement Agreement is created to address the Memorandum of \nDecision and Order issued by the Court in this case on June 5, 2008. The \nSettlement Agreement consists of five components: (I) The Framework -\nstatements of purpose, principle and policy which were developed by the \nparties to this case; (2) Benchmarks - the objective and measureable \nactivities and obligations of the Defendants which are the substance of the \nremedy requested by the Court~ (3) The Role of Remedial Expert - an \nindividual mutually selected by the parties to facilitate and monitor \nimplementation of the benchmarks, to have a primary role in dispute \nresolution, and to serve a \"gatekeeper\" function related to any future \nnecessity of Court involvement or intervention; (4) Jurisdiction and Sunset; \nand (5) Attorneys' Fees and Costs - establishing a process to reach \nagreement of decision based upon the Memorandum of Decision and Order. \nI.  THE FRAMEWORK \nA. Purpose \nThe purpose of this Settlement Agreement is to assure that the \ndepartment and its staff commit that each class member has the opportunity \nto have an assessment of the supports that would be needed to live \nsuccessfully in a community setting; to assure that the class member, \nguardian, involved family member, or other personal representative, has \nsufficient information to make an informed decision about the merits of \ncommunity placement to meet the particular needs of the class member \nincluding the status of programs and services at STS and to ensure that \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1054   Filed 11/18/10   Page 16 of 28\ninformation  will be provided to each class member and his/her guardian to \nenable them to make an infonned choice as to an integrated setting and \ntransition to an appropriate community setting within a reasonable time after \nprofessional judgment has been exercised by the lOT. It is recognized that \nthe ultimate decision about residence rests with the guardian unless the \ndepartment believes that this legal representative is not making decisions in \nthe best interest of the class member. \nB. Policy \nThe department shall discontinue the use of the policy EMPOWER, to \nguide community transition decisions for STS residents. The use of the \nquarterly assessment of choice shall also be discontinued. \nAll current policies in the area of Level of need (LON) assessment, \nIndividual Plan (IP) planning, case management, safeguards, guardian \ninvolvement, portability, placement planning and transition activities apply \nto all class members who reside at STS. Once a class member transfers to a \ncommunity setting, which is not an ICF/MR, all DDS waiver policies, \nprocedures and guidelines are applicable. The only additional procedure to \nbe issued by the department, in accordance with this Settlement Agreement, \nwill articulate the department's commitment to professional judgment being \nrendered by each team for each STS class member, including \nrecommendations for a \"most integrated setting\" as appropriate to class \nmember needs. The team will assure the active involvement of class \nmembers, guardians, advocates, and other personal representatives, and will \nschedule meetings at convenient times and locations to encourage such \nparticipation. \nThe Defendants will transition class members to the most integrated \nsetting, in accordance with the professional jUdgment exercised by the lOT, \nwith individualized support services, provided the class member and \nguardian, as applicable, makes an informed choice not to oppose such \ndetermination. For purposes of this agreement the \"most integrated setting\" \nis defined as \"a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to interact \nwith non-disabled persons to the fullest extent possible.\"  28 C.F.R. pt. 35 \napp. A at page 571 (2009); Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 592.  Parties acknowledge \nand accept the Court's finding that STS is a segregated institution. Messier \nv. Southbury Training School, 562 F. Supp. 2d 294, 326 (D. Conn. 2008). \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1054   Filed 11/18/10   Page 17 of 28\nc. \nProfessional Judgment \nDDS will assure that professional judgment is made by each \nInterdisciplinary Team (IDT) as to the most integrated setting appropriate to \nmeet the needs of each class member. When the team determines that \ncommunity services and supports can reasonably meet the needs of the class \nmember, and is the most integrated setting, this recommendation will be \nmade in the OPS (lP) and will be discussed with the guardian and the class \nmember at the IDT meeting and documented in the OPS (IP).  The team will \ndetermine the individualized services, supports and accommodations the \nclass member needs to transition to an integrated community setting and \nhow these supports can be provided in an integrated community setting. \nOnce a class member or guardian, as applicable, has voiced an interest to \npursue community transition, a DDS regional case manager will be assigned \nto join the team. \nThe team, assisted by the Remedial Expert, will identifY record and \naddress guardian, advocate, family and class member concerns and offer \nsuggestions to overcome any identified concerns that create a barrier to \nsuccessful community placement. Transition from STS to an integrated \ncommunity setting shall be considered individually for each class member \nand pursued unless the guardian exercises informed choice not to pursue \ncommunity placement as described in Benchmark #8 below. \nD.  Resource Development \nThe Level of Need (LON) assessment and Individual Plan (lP) will be \nused to detennine the level of resources the class member will need to \ntransition to the community, including having employment, day service, \nmedical, dental, health and clinical supports. \nThe parties agree that DDS has the ways and means to make resources \navailable for each and every class member who wishes to transition from \nSTS to an integrated community setting with appropriate individualized \nservices and supports.  There is no financial or resource barrier to \ncommunity placement for any class member who desires to transition. STS \nclass members will not be in competition for resources allocated for any \nother individual or target group served by DDS. \n3 \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1054   Filed 11/18/10   Page 18 of 28\nDDS will revise its portability policies and procedures to explicitly \ninclude and be applicable to all STS class members. \nE. Informed Choice \nThe Department  commits itself to taking actions and putting \nprocesses in place to make sure that guardians, family members, advocates, \nand class members have sufficient information about community options to \nmake an informed choice about team members' recommendations for the \nmost integrated setting to meet the class member's needs. \nPrior to a class member or guardian making an intonned choice, all \ninterested guardians, advocates, class members and family members will be \noffered opportunities to visit day and residential programs and services that \nwould be appropriate to meet the individual needs of the class member. \nClass members shall have the opportunity to spend time in \ncommunity residential homes prior to transition from STS. \nII.

Resources \nwill be made available to implement the class member's transition plan. \n8. Exercise of informed choice about community placement by a \nguardian and/or class member only after they have been informed of the \nbenefits of community placement and have had an opportunity to visit a \ncommunity and day program that is appropriate to meet their needs. Visits to \ncommunity settings appropriate to meet the needs of the class member, in \nthe judgment of the team, must occur within three (3) months of a decision \nthat the class member can live in an integrated community setting. \n9. The Remedial Expert will identify, record and evaluate the \nDepartment's response to concerns of family, advocates, guardians and class \nmembers, and to identified systemic barriers to the implementation of \nprofessional judgments for community transition.

Advocates, independent from the department, will be sought and \nobtained for each class member who requests one and who does not have a \nguardian who is willing and able to obtain information relative to making \ninformed choice or to participate in the community placement process, \nincluding team meetings and community visitations, and for whom no other \n7 \n\nCase 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1054   Filed 11/18/10   Page 22 of 28\narrangements have been made for family, advocate, or personal \nrepresentative involvement. These independent advocates should be \nindividuals who are open to the recommendations of the team, in the \nexercise of professional judgment, and who will seriously consider what is \nthe most appropriate integrated setting in which the class member can be \nsupported. \nJ3 . Quarterly for the first year and semi annually thereafter, the \nDepartment will identify and report on class members for whom community \ntransitions are being planned, as a result of the exercise of professional \njudgment and guardian support.

The parties acknowledge that the informed opposition of a \nguardian to transition the class member to a community setting, by itself, is \nnot a basis to propose and commence the transfer hearing process, in \naccordance with Section 17a-210 of the Connecticut general Statutes, nor a \nbasis to challenge or seek review of the guardianship in the Probate Court. \n\n.. \n\"  Case 3:94-cv-01706-EBB   Document 1054   Filed 11/18/10   Page 23 of 28\n. \n, , \n• \nIII.

(collectively, the \"proposed intervenors\") move to intervene\nin the above-captioned matter.  For the following reasons, the\nproposed intervenors' motion [Doc. No. 13] is denied.1\nDISCUSSION\nI.  Intervention as of Right\nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2), intervention\nas of right is available, upon timely application, if:\nthe applicant claims an interest relating to the\nproperty or transaction which is the subject of the\naction and the applicant is so situated that the\n1  The background and procedural history of this case, as\nwell as a discussion of the claims asserted by the plaintiffs,\nare set forth in this Court's February 9, 1996, Ruling on\nDefendants' Motion to Dismiss.  Familiarity with this opinion is\npresumed in the following discussion.\nMessier v. Southbury Training Sch. 1\n* \"™~  ••  VH  mm  H  nil |\nMR-CT-003-003\n8/82^\n\ndisposition of the action may as a practical matter\nimpair or impede the applicant's ability to protect\nthat interest, unless the applicant's interest is\nadequately represented by existing parties.\nFed. R. Civ. Proc. 24(a)(2).  Precedents under Rule 24 have not,\nto date, clearly defined the type of interest that is required\nfor intervention as of right.  7C Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal\nPractice and Procedure § 1908 (Civil 2d 1986).  However, it is\nclear that the interest involved must be a \"significantly\nprotectable interest.\"  Donaldson v. United States  400 U.S. 517,\nr\n531 (1971).  Once an applicant for intervention succeeds in\nshowing the existence of such an interest, the applicant need\nonly provide \"minimal\" proof that the interest may not be\nadequately represented by existing parties.  Trbovich v. United\nMine Workers of Am.. 404 U.S. 528, 538 n.10  (1972).\nThe proposed intervenors assert three principal interests\nwhich they claim may be impaired or impeded by the instant\nlitigation, and which they claim may not be adequately\nrepresented by the existing parties.2  However, as is discussed\nbelow, the Court disagrees with respect to each of the asserted\ninterests.\n2  The proposed intervenors in fact claim that they\npossess six types of interests which may be adversely affected by\nthe instant litigation.  Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Intervene, at\n6-8.  However, three of these alleged interests are in fact\npurely derivative of the other three claimed interests.\nSpecifically, the interests asserted in ff 3, 5 & 6 on pages\nseven and eight of the proposed intervenors' brief are asserted\nby parents and by the two proposed intervenor organizations, as\nrepresentatives of STS residents.  Thus, these interests are\nwholly derivative of the residents' rights asserted in flfl 1-2 on\npage six of the proposed intervenors' brief.\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\n1.  Interest in Keeping Southbury Training School Open\nThe gravamen of the proposed intervenors• motion is their\nasserted \"right not to be forced out of an institutional setting\nand into community settings against their wishes and against the\njudgments of their parents and guardians.\"  Mem. in Supp. of Mot.\nto Intervene, at 6.  In support of their contention that the\ninstant litigation threatens such a harm, the proposed\nintervenors repeatedly assert that the plaintiffs \"espouse a\nphilosophy, and seek injunctive relief, mandating controversial\nsocial policies designed to close residential facilities such as\nSTS and to place all residents of those facilities in community\nsettings.\"  Id.., at 11-12.\nAs an initial matter, the Court chooses not to speculate as\nto the parties' philosophies.  Whereas the proposed intervenors\nmay or may not be correct concerning the plaintiffs1 philosophy,\nthe only relevant consideration is what effect the instant\nlitigation may have on the proposed intervenors' rights or\ninterests.  In this connection, the Court is cognizant that the\nplaintiffs' complaint could be read as seeking slowly to shut\ndown STS, by ending all new admissions and forcing transfers to\ncommunity settings.  See Complaint, at 29 (seeking to \"[e]njoin\ndefendants from admitting persons to [STS] or transferring\npersons from STS unless such transfer is to an integrated\ncommunity home . . .\") .\nHowever, as discussed in this Court's recent ruling on the\ndefendants' motion to dismiss, under prevailing precedent the\nAO 72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nplaintiffs• complaint must be read as seeking to require STS to\nconsider whether each resident is appropriate for community\nplacement and to then act accordingly based upon such\nconsideration.  To the extent that plaintiffs' complaint instead\nsought to end all new admissions to STS, transfer all residents\nto community settings or otherwise shut down STS, this Court has\neffectively narrowed the complaint, as mandated by prevailing\nprecedent, to exclude any such relief.  See Ruling on Motion to\nDismiss, February 9, 1996, at 13 (noting that \"'there is no\nconstitutional right to community placement,'\" but that \"a\ndecision to keep a resident in an institutional rather than\ncommunity setting is only constitutional to the extent that it is\na  'rational decision based upon professional judgment'\")\n(citation omitted).\nThus, the most that plaintiffs can accomplish is to require\nSTS to conform with its constitutional duty to consider the\nappropriateness of community placement for each resident.  In no\nway can the plaintiffs force STS to place in community settings\nthose residents for whom community placement is inappropriate, or\nforce the State of Connecticut to shut down STS.  Therefore, the\nproposed intervenors' interest in keeping STS open cannot be\nimpeded or impaired by the instant litigation.3\n3  This Court concurs with the findings of Judge Wolf in\nhis ruling on an analogous Motion to Intervene in Healy v. Weld,\nNo. 94-11804-MLW  (D. Mass. Nov. 23, 1994), a case involving the\nDever State School.  Judge Wolf found that:\nThe [intervenors'] submission expresses  [their]\n4\nAO 72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\n2.  Parents' and Guardians' Right to Participate in Decisions\nConcerning Community Placement\nThe proposed intervenors also assert that the instant\nlitigation jeopardizes parents1 and guardians1 \"right to\nparticipate in decisions concerning community placement of their\nchildren and wards.\"  Mem.- in Supp. of Mot. to Intervene, at 7.\nSpecifically, the proposed intervenors claim that these rights\nwill be \"usurped by 'independent' advisors whose agenda is to\ncompel the placement of all STS residents in community settings.\"\nId-  The basis for the proposed intervenors' allegations is that\nportion of plaintiffs' complaint in which plaintiffs seek to\n\"[ejnjoin the defendants to make available individual and\nindependent advocates for each plaintiff and member of the\nplaintiff class to assist them in securing their rights.\"\nComplaint, at 30.\nThis Court has no knowledge as to whom the plaintiffs^ seek\nto have assigned as \"independent advocates,\" or precisely what\ntype of role plaintiffs expect such advocates to play.  However,\nthis Court is unaware of any authority under which plaintiffs may\nseek to have any party usurp the rights and duties held by\nparents and legal guardians.  Thus, whatever role the plaintiffs\nintention to argue the value of a centralized\ninstitution such as Dever as opposed to community-based\nplacements for certain individuals, and the importance\nof Dever remaining open . . . [However,] [t]his court\ndoes not understand that it has been asked by\nplaintiffs to decide this policy question and, in any\nevent, does not intend to do so.\nHealy   slip op. at 2-3.\nf\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nhave in mind for the proposed independent advocates, such\nadvocates, if appointed, certainly could not infringe upon the\nlegal rights of parents and guardians.4\nIt is conceivable that STS professionals might determine\nthat community placement is appropriate for a resident whose\nparent or guardian is opposed to such placement.5  Indeed, such a\nconflict could arise currently, even absent any relief awarded to\nthe plaintiffs.  If and when such a conflict arises, the parents\nor guardians involved have legal recourse to prevent unwanted\ncommunity placement.  See State of Connecticut Department of\nMental Retardation, Admin. Directive No. 15 (Aug. 31, 1983)\n(setting forth parents1 and guardians' minimum notice and hearing\nrights with respect to proposed transfers of their children and\nwards).  However, even if plaintiffs' requested relief might make\nsuch conflicts more likely to occur, an increase in likelihood of\nconflict would not infringe on any legally protectable right or\ninterest held by parents or guardians.  Rather, parents and\nguardians currently have, and will continue to have, such rights\nand duties as the law accords them.  The mere fact that the\nplaintiffs' litigation could force STS to fulfill its\n4  The court notes that decision-making concerning a\nresident's future is not a zero-sum process.  That is, adding a\nfurther source of input need not detract from the rights and\nduties of those persons who already have input, and indeed cannot\ndetract from the rights of parents and guardians.\n5  Though, under the decision-making procedures proposed\nby the plaintiffs, parents and guardians would be integrally\ninvolved in all decisions.  Complaint, at 26.\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nconstitutional obligation accurately to assess residents1 proper\nfuture course of treatment, thus potentially leading to an\nincrease in occasions in which parents or guardians are at odds\nwith medical professionals, in no way \"impairs or impedes\"\nparents1 and guardians' ability to protect their legal rights, if\nand when such conflicts arise.\n3.  Right to Supervision, Training and Adequate Care\nThe proposed intervenors lastly assert that they \"have long-\nterm needs for, and constitutional rights to, close supervision,\ntraining and adequate and safe care.\"  Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to\n•Intervene, at 6.  The proposed intervenors claim that these\ninterests may be impaired or impeded by the instant litigation,\nand that the plaintiffs may not adequately represent these\ninterests.  This Court disagrees.\nThe proposed intervenors set forth two primary arguments as\n/\nto why the plaintiffs may not adequately represent the residents'\ninterests in remedying conditions at STS.  First, the proposed\nintervenors argue that the plaintiff organizations in this case\ncount among their members relatively few STS residents, as ?\ncompared to the intervenor organizations.  Similarly, whereas the\nplaintiff organizations are statewide or regional organizations,\nthe intervenor organizations focus specifically on STS.  However,\nthe Court finds no evidence that these differences make one group\nof organizations more qualified than the other to raise\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nconstitutional challenges to conditions at STS.6\nSecond, the proposed intervenors argue that the plaintiffs\nmay not be able adequately to challenge conditions at STS because\nthey actually seek to have STS shut down.  This argument is\npremised upon a reading of the plaintiffs1 complaint with which\nthis Court does not concur.  As discussed previously, rather than\nreading the plaintiffs1 complaint as seeking closure of STS, this\nCourt necessarily reads the plaintiffs' complaint as seeking\nequal consideration of all STS residents for community placement,\nregardless of their level of disability.  Moreover, plaintiffs'\ncomplaint additionally and with equal force seeks improved\nconditions at STS, and the Court finds no evidence whatsoever\nthat this aspect of plaintiffs' challenge is being pursued in an\ninadequate manner.  Thus, the proposed intervenors have failed to\nmake even a \"minimal\" showing of potentially inadequate\nrepresentation.  Trbovich  404 U.S. at 538 n.10.  ,—\nr\n6  It is impossible for this Court abstractly to weigh the\nimportance of the intervenors1 specific focus on STS on the one\nhand with the plaintiffs' breadth of experience from cases\ninvolving other institutions on the other hand.  However, in\nexamining the actual practices followed by plaintiffs in the\ninstant case, the Court finds no evidence of inadequate\nrepresentation.\n8\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nII.  Permissive Intervention\nUnder Rule 24(b)(2), permissive intervention may be\navailable, upon timely application, if \"an applicant's claim or\ndefense and the main action have a question of law or fact in\ncommon.\"  Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 24(b)(2).  It is discretionary with\nthe court whether to allow such intervention.  7C Wright, Miller\n& Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure, § 1911 (Civil 2d 1986).\nIn the instant case, the defense that the proposed\nintervenors seek to assert against plaintiffs' actions, as well\nas the cross-claims that the proposed intervenors seek to bring\nagainst STS, are clearly related in both law and fact to the\nexisting action.  However, the circumstances of this case counsel\nagainst allowing permissive intervention.\nFirst, as discussed previously, the proposed intervenors\nunderstand the instant litigation to seek closure of STS, an\nunderstanding which this Court does not share, and, indeed,\nbelieves to be impossible under the law.  It would be unduly\nburdensome upon all parties, and, ultimately, wasteful of\nresources for this Court to grant the proposed intervenors'\nmotion, only later to dismiss the proposed intervenors' defense\nas irrelevant given the limited scope of the questions at issue\nin this case.\nSecond, the Court finds the proposed intervenors' cross-\nclaims to be so duplicative of the plaintiffs' claims as to\ncounsel further against allowing intervention.  Indeed, if\nallowed to intervene, the proposed intervenors would seek to\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nrepresent the same residents as plaintiffs seek to represent,\nand to bring substantially similar claims concerning conditions\nat STS.  Whereas the proposed intervenors are free to file amicus\ncuriae briefs with the Court, in the absence of inadequate\nrepresentation by the plaintiffs the Court sees no rationale for\nallowing intervention.\nSUMMARY\nFor the foregoing reasons, the proposed intervenors1 motion\n[Doc. No. 13] is denied.\nSO ORDERED.\nESLLILEN BREE BURNS, SENIOR JUDGE\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n£5\nDated at New Haven, Connecticut, this (£>  day of March, 1996.\n10\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)",
