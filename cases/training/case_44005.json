Mr. Rothert stated that the Court had ruled on attorneys' fees and directed notice in its Order, Doc. 261, but because the case was stayed shortly thereafter, notice was never distributed to the class. Mr. Rothert further stated that notice would still be required pursuant to Rule 23(h), despite the class now being more of a 23(b)(2) class rather than 23(b)(3). Mr. Brown stated that defendant is seeking review in the Supreme Court. As a result, the parties both proposed staying the case to prevent having to potentially distribute multiple notices to the class. The Court ordered the case stayed for three months and ordered the parties to file a status report at the end of the stay. Appearance: Plaintiff by Anthony Rothert Jessie Steffan, Jason Williamson. Defendants by Kent Brown and Annie Willis. CRD: Renea Matthes Mitra. Court Reporter: None. (Text entry only.) (Matthes Mitra, Renea) (Entered: 02/01/2017)"

    "summary": "<p>This is a case about a mandatory drug testing policy at Linn State, a public university. On September 14, 2011, several enrolled students at Linn State University filed this class action lawsuit in United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri. The plaintiffs sued the Linn State President and several members of the Board of Regents under 42 USC &sect; 1983. Represented by the ACLU, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. They claimed that the new mandatory drug testing policy violated their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights. The case was assigned to Judge Nanette K. Laughrey and Magistrate Judge Matt J. Whitworth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The new policy required the university's students to submit to mandatory drug testing as a condition of their continued enrollment. If students refused they would be withdrawn from the school. Students were charged a non-refundable $50 for the drug test. Students whose drug test came back positive had 45 days until they were tested again. If the second test was also positive the student was withdrawn from the school.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In their complaint the plaintiffs defined their class as \"current, and future, students of Linn State Technical College who are, or will be, seeking degrees or certificates at the main campus of the College in Linn, Missouri or any other Linn State Technical College Locations.\"</p>\r\n<p>In their complaint the plaintiffs alleged that the policy was unconstitutional under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. They argued that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy against the state in the chemical content of their urine and that the policy constituted a search under the Fourth Amendment. They argued that the the policy required plaintiffs to submit to a search without any individualized suspicion and that the defendants could not show a special need for the policy that would sufficiently outweigh the individual privacy expectations of the plaintiffs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 14, 2011 the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary retraining order and permanent injunction and motion to certify their class. On the same day the court granted the plaintiffs motion for temporary restraining order enjoining the defendants from collecting any further samples and from testing the ones already collected.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 21, 2011 the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint which removed one of the named plaintiffs from the listed parties. The plaintiffs also amended their requested relief to include damages as well as relief that would require the defendants to return or destroy any samples collected during the time in which the policy was not enjoined.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 23, 2011 the plaintiffs filed a consent motion to dismiss the claim for damages from the first amended complaint. The judge granted the order on the same day. On the same day the plaintiffs also filed an emergency motion requesting an order that would extend the temporary restraining order.The court granted the motion on the same day after the defendants had agreed to resolve the extension, but had subsequently made themselves unavailable. The court extended the TRO for 14 more days and clarified that it only applied to drug testing conduct pursuant to the policy adopted by the defendants in June 2011.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 29, 2011 the plaintiffs filed a motion to expedite consideration of their preliminary injunction motion since their TRO was due to lapse before the hearing for their preliminary injunction would occur. The TRO could only be extended further if the defendants consented and the plaintiffs stipulated that the defendants would only agree in exchange for certain conditions that the plaintiffs objected to. The plaintiffs asked the court to conduct the hearing before the expiration of the TRO or to enforce the defendants' agreement to consent to an extension of the TRO.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 29, 2011 the defendants asked the court to set aside the order extending the TRO. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs sought an emergency hearing for the TRO at a time when they knew the defendant was unavailable and when the TRO did not expire for another 5 days. The defendants asked the court to set aside the results of that hearing and that a new hearing should be held regarding any proposed extension of modification of the TRO.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 30, 2011 the court denied the motion to expedite and motion to set aside as moot. The parties had filed a joint stipulation regarding the TRO and by agreement of the parties the modification of the TRO language from September 23, 2011 was set aside and the TRO was extended to October 25, 2011.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 19, 2011 the plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss without prejudice the individual claims of two of the named plaintiffs.&nbsp;On October 25, 2011 the court granted the plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction and extended the TRO until November 8, 2011.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 8, 2011 the court continued the TRO to which neither of the parties objected. The defendants agreed that Linn College would not collect any urine samples pursuant to the policy being challenged.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 9, 2011 the defendants filed a motion to dismiss party as to the student representative of the board of regents who had since left his position.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 15, 2011 the court granted the plaintiffs' motion to dismiss the individual claims of two of the named plaintiffs.&nbsp;On the same day the court granted the plaintiffs' motion to certify their class. The court did not find the defendants argument, that some students might not object to the policy and thus a class was not appropriate, persuasive. The court determined this irrelevant to the question of whether the policy was an unreasonable search and seizure. The court held that the allegation against the university's drug testing policy affected the Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure of each student in the same way and thus a class certification was appropriate.&nbsp;2011 WL 5822382.</p>\r\n<p>On November 18, 2011 the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction. The court determined that the plaintiffs would be irreparably harmed without an injunction because if they had to submit to the search and their constitutional rights were violated their only subsequent relief would be damages. The defendants on the other hand would not be harmed by maintaining the status quo of no drug testing which had been in operation since the 1960s.&nbsp;2011 WL 5827783.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants appealed this decision on December 16, 2011.</p>\r\n<p>On February 28, 2012 the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the student representative as a party. The student representative was sued in his official capacity as a part of the board of the regents and since the student had graduated in 2009 he was no longer in that position. The court dismissed the claims for lack of personal jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The interlocutory appeal was heard by a panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit constituting Circuit judges Wollman, Beam, and Loken.&nbsp; On January 29, 2013 the Eighth Circuit vacated the district court's decision and held that the plaintiffs had not shown fair chance of prevailing on their facial Fourth Amendment challenge to the university's mandatory drug-testing policy. The appellate court found that the district court had erred in its analysis that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their case. The appellate court determined that because plaintiffs had launched a facial challenge to the policy and sought a preliminary injunction they had to prove that there were no set of circumstances under which the policy could comply with the Fourth Amendment. The court reasoned that the university could implement the policy in a reasonable way so as to comply with the Fourth Amendment. Since the drug testing results were not to be used by law enforcement the university merely had to pass a balancing test between their presumed interest propelled by the policy and the protected interests of the students. The court determined that the university's pubic safety interest in providing a safe environment for students could be found to outweigh the individual privacy interests of students. 705 F.3d 315.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 12, 2013 the plaintiffs filed motions once again for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. In response to the court of appeals decision the plaintiffs asked the court for a temporary restraining order because while the court of appeals said the policy was not facially unconstitutional they had reasoned it could have unconstitutional applications. The appellate court was scheduled to issue its mandate on February 18, 2013 and the plaintiffs sought relief before the order would take effect.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 19, 2013 the court of appeals mandated that the district court vacate the preliminary injunction. The next day the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a TRO. On March 11, 2013 the court extended the TRO for an additional fourteen days or until the court could rule on the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 22, 2013 the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoined the defendants from collecting or testing any urine samples from students. Once again the court's decision turned on whether the plaintiffs had shown that they were likely to succeed on the merits of their case. The court determined that the relevant standard was that the plaintiffs had a fair chance of prevailing on their claim. The court reasoned that this less stricter standard applied because the regulation in question had not undergone the usual legislative process that allows statutes to be tested under the less strict standard of \"likely to prevail on the merits.\"</p>\r\n<p>The defendants argued that the policy was not unconstitutional as applied because none of the students initially tested had petitioned for an exemption and therefore the policy was never applied in its entirety. The plaintiffs argued that the constitutional violation was the collection and testing of the urine sample and that just because they didn't apply for an exemption did not mean that the policy had not been applied to them. The district court agreed with the plaintiffs and determined that the availability of a petition procedure might bear on the reasonableness of the policy, but did not preclude the plaintiffs from challenging the policy as it was applied to them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court held that there was a fair chance that the university's drug-testing policy was unconstitutionally applied in September of 2011 when the initial samples were taken. The university, undisputedly, lacked individualized suspicion when it initially tested students and the safety interest did not justify these searches because they were not enrolled in programs that posed significant safety concerns to others.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The defendants had argued that the concern of cross enrollment justified the policy of drug testing all students since they were allowed to take classes in different disciplines and might take a class in a subject area deemed dangerous. The court held that this concern did not justify testing all students because it was not clear if the classes they were enrolling in actually justified drug testing or if it was the upper level classes in that discipline that warranted the policy.&nbsp;The injunction applied to students who were not enrolled in the university's aviation maintenance, heavy equipment operations, and industrial electricity programs. 936 F.Supp.2d 1099.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a motion to join an additional defendant who was a member of the board of regents on April 25, 2013 which the court granted on the same day.&nbsp;On May 21, 2013 the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the claims against this defendant for failure to state a claim.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 10, 2013 the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. The amended complaint addressed the points raised by the appellate court and asked for declaratory relief that would find the drug policy unconstitutional either facially or as-applied.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 13, 2013 the district court ruled that the drug policy was unconstitutional as applied to students enrolled in academic programs that did not include tasks that posed a significant safety risk to others, but was constitutional as applied to those in programs which did and whose program was in a heavily regulated industry in which drug testing was the norm. The court granted declaratory and injunctive relief.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court found that the burden fell on the defendants to prove that there was a special need justifying the suspicion less search. If the defendants showed proof of a special need in regards to a particular program would it then be weighed against the plaintiffs' reasonable privacy expectations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court refused to uphold the policy on the basis that it sought to block students from harming themselves. There was no precedent that supported this interest, the Supreme Court had only upheld policies that protected students in dangerous positions from harming others with drug use. The court was concerned about illusory safety concerns that would mask unconstitutional purposes. \"The six \"program goals\" adopted by the Board of Regents do not even mention preventing accidents or injuries caused or contributed to by drug use, and instead focus on goals like improving retention and graduation rates.\" The court determined that only students seeking accreditation in heavily regulated industries where drug testing was the norm did there exist a diminished expectation of privacy. For all other programs students had a full expectation of privacy because defendants had not provided any evidence supporting the contrary.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court found that the policy itself was minimally intrusive, but heightened the intrusiveness because of the specific provision that would notify parents of students under 21 of positive results.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court found the cross-enrollment argument \"too abstract and unsubstantiated to constitute the kind of significant and concrete danger required to override the ordinary requirements of the Fourth Amendment.\" In regards to defendants' other argument that the petition process rendered the policy constitutional, the court disagreed that it overrode the Fourth Amendment concerns. The court found that if the petition process rendered the policy constitutional then any state actor could impose a drug testing policy as long as they also provided a petition process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court granted the following relief</p>\r\n<p>1) Declaratory relief that the policy was unconstitutional as-applied to certain students enrolled at Linn State. &nbsp;The policy was unconstitutional as applied to students not enrolled in the following programs: Aviation Maintenance, Electrical Distribution Systems, Industrial Electricity, Power Sports, and CAT Dealer Service Technician programs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2) A permanent injunction with respect to students whose Fourth Amendment rights were or would be violated by the policy as well as a reimbursement of those who previously had to pay the fee for drug testing and who the injunction applied to.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3) Attorneys fees.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>976 F.Supp.2d 1104.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a motion for attorneys fees on October 4, 2013 and the defendants filed a notice of their appeal of the court's September 13 decision with the U.S. Court of the Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on October 9, 2013.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 19, 2013 the plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the September 13 judgement. They alleged that the defendants had refused to refund the drug test fees and destroy the samples previously collected. The plaintiffs argued that even though they had filed an appeal the defendants had not asked for a stay.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs motion for attorneys fees on December 9, 2013. The court agreed that 2/3 of the attorneys had reasonable fees, but decreased the third attorney's fees because of the unreasonable amount of time designated to travel. Consequently, the court held that not all of the submitted travel was reasonable and awarded a total of $181,979.14 to the plaintiffs. 2013 WL 6920860.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court stayed the case pending the resolution of the defendants' appeal and denied the plaintiffs' motion to enforce the judgment without prejudice on January 7, 2014. On the same day the defendants filed an appeal of the court's award of attorneys fees.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On December 7, 2015 the court of appeals reversed and remanded the case for dismissal. The appellate court held that the district court had erred in conducting an analysis of every program at Linn State to determine if the defendants' burden was met. The appellate court determined that the district court had limited and applied the earlier appellate opinion incorrectly. The district court's holding that indulging any other interest (other than safety) would promote the advancement of illusory safety concerns to mask the unconstitutional purposes was incorrect. The district court had \"erred in declining to include harm to oneself in its special need analysis.\" The appellate court found that the university had a special need that justified conducting a balancing test of competing constitutional interests.</p>\r\n<p>The Eighth Circuit also disagreed with the district court's dismissal of the cross enrollment argument and held that the expectation of privacy for all students of the university was somewhat diminished because &nbsp;even though some students were not entering fields with high regulation they were juxtaposed with those who were.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court ultimately held that after balancing the interests the university's policy was reasonable and constitutional. In reversing and remanding for dismissal the district court's award of attorneys fees was also reversed in favor of the defendants.&nbsp;807 F.3d 913.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On December 22, 2016 after a rehearing en banc the court of appeals affirmed and dismissed in part the previous appellate court opinion. The panel held that:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The policy was constitutional as applied to students engaged in programs that posed significant safety risks to others.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>The university's safety interest did not constitute a special need for suspicion less drug testing.</li>\r\n<li>The policy was unconstitutional as applied to students in programs other than those that posed significant safety risks to others.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>The court of appeals lacked jurisdiction over the appeal of the tentative award of attorneys fees.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The appellate court reversed and vacated the order to the extent that it required the university to refund the fee paid by students who had been tested and dismissed the defendants' appeal of the tentative award of attorneys fees. 844 F.3d 727.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 2, 2017 the court of appeals awarded $39,566 in attorneys fees and $396.48 in costs to the plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>On April 6, 2017 the defendants filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. On May 4, 2017 the court stayed the case pending resolution of the defendants cert petition.

    "summary_short": "In 2011 several enrolled students at Linn State University filed this class action lawsuit in the US District Court for the Western District of Missouri against the university president and several members of the board of regents alleging that the mandatory drug testing policy violated their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The district court held for the plaintiffs and determined that the policy was unconstitutional as applied to students who were not enrolled in certain programs that posed significant safety risks to others. After a rehearing en banc by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals that affirmed the decision of the district court and a denial of cert by the Supreme Court the case was closed.",

Linn State Technical College (โLinn Stateโ or โCollegeโ) is the first public college \nin the country to require its students, who are 18 years old or above, to submit to mandatory drug \ntesting as a condition of their continued enrollment, despite the fact that the College has had no \ndocumented drug problems over the course of its 50-year history and no reason to suspect that \nthe students subject to testing have been engaged in the use or abuse of illegal drugs. \n2.  Linn State is a two-year, publicly funded college established by Missouri statute \nand governed by a Board of Regents appointed by the Governor.  \n3.  The mandatory, suspicionless drug testing required under the Collegeโs new \npolicy is a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Ordinarily, the Fourth \nAmendment prohibits such searches, with some exceptions, none of which are applicable here. \nMoreover, the College can demonstrate no legitimate special need for drug testing its students \nthat is sufficient to outweigh the studentsโ individual privacy expectations against the state.  \n4.  The implementation of this unconstitutional drug-testing program began in \nSeptember 2011, and Plaintiffs, along with other members of the Class, will be irreparably \nharmed if they are forced to surrender their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by \nsubmitting to a search by the government, or by refusing to consent to such a search and thereby \ncausing their removal from the College. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 USC ยงยง 1331, 1343, 2201 and 42 USC ยง \n1983. \n6.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 USC ยง 1391(b) and L.R. 3.1(A)(2).  \nThe actions giving rise to this case are occurring in Osage County, Missouri. \n  2\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 180   Filed 06/10/13   Page 2 of 11\n\nPARTIES \n7.  Plaintiff Michael Barrett, IV, enrolled for the Fall 2011 semester in the Electronics \nEngineering Technology Program as a newly classified degree-seeking student at Linn State \nTechnical College.  He was required, as a condition of continued enrollment, to submit to a \nsuspicionless drug test on or about September 13, 2011. \n8.   Plaintiff Jacob Curliss enrolled for the Fall 2011 semester in the Design Drafting \nTechnology Program as a newly classified degree-seeking student at Linn State Technical \nCollege.  He was required, as a condition of continued enrollment, to submit to a suspicionless \ndrug test on or about September 7, 2011. \n9.  Plaintiff Branden Kittle-Aikeley enrolled for the Fall 2011 semester in the \nHeating, Ventilation, & Air Conditioning Technology Program as a newly classified degree-\nseeking student at Linn State Technical College.  He was required, as a condition of continued \nenrollment, to submit to a suspicionless drug test on or about September 7, 2011. \n10.  Plaintiff John Doe enrolled for the Fall 2011 semester in the Design Drafting \nTechnology Program as a newly classified degree-seeking student at Linn State Technical \nCollege.  He was required, as a condition of continued enrollment, to submit to a suspicionless \ndrug test on or about September 7, 2011. \n11.  Defendant Donald M. Claycomb is the President of Linn State Technical College.  \nAs President, Claycomb is responsible for creating and implementing policies for operation and \nsupervision of the College.  He is sued in his official capacity only.  \n12.  Defendants Toni R. Schwartz, John Klebba, J. Scott Christianson, Diane Benetz, \nMark J. Collom, Kenneth L. Miller, and Erick V. Kern are members of the Linn State Technical \nCollege Board of Regents, which is the governing board for Linn State Technical College.  They \nare sued in their official capacities only. \n  3\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 180   Filed 06/10/13   Page 3 of 11\n\nPLAINTIFF CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n13.     The Named Plaintiffs are members of a Class of current, and future, students of \nLinn State Technical College who are, or will be, seeking degrees or certificates at the main \ncampus of the College in Linn, Missouri, or any other Linn State Technical College location that \nare subjected to the challenged drug-testing policy.  \n14.  The total enrollment at the College exceeds 1,100 students; thus, the number of \nindividuals in the Class of current, and future, students who are, or will be, seeking degrees or \ncertificates at the College is so numerous that joinder of all members of the Class would be \nimpracticable. \n15.  There are questions of law and fact that are common to the Class, including, but \nnot limited to, the legal questions of whether Defendantsโ drug-testing policy impermissibly \ninfringes the class membersโ Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and whether the \ngovernment can show a โspecial needโ sufficient to outweigh the Class membersโ individual \nprivacy expectations against the state. \n16.  The claims of the Named Plaintiffs that the drug-testing policy developed by the \nCollege impermissibly infringes on their rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments are \ntypical of the claims of the Class. \n17.  As students subjected to the Collegeโs new drug-testing policy, the Named \nPlaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. \n18.  Defendantsโ drug-testing policy requires Defendants to act on grounds generally \napplicable to the Class, thereby making it appropriate for this Court to grant injunctive relief, and \nany corresponding declaratory relief, to the Class as a whole. \nFACTS \n19.   The College has been offering academic programs since 1961. \n  4\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 180   Filed 06/10/13   Page 4 of 11\n\n20.  The College was established by, and continues to operate under the authority of, \nMissouri statutes. See Mo. Rev. Stat. ยง 178.631, et seq.  \n21.  The College was originally established with funding from the National Defense \nEducation Act as a post-secondary residential technical institution. \n22.  The Collegeโs founding philosophy was to provide two-year vocational and \ntechnical programs to all students who wish to prepare themselves for employment. \n23.  The College is Missouriโs only two-year public technical college with a statewide \nmission. \n24.  The College originated as Linn Technical Junior College, but in 1995, by passage \nof a statute, became a part of the public higher education system in Missouri. \n25.  The College now offers approximately academic programs in a wide range of \nfields, including Computer Programming, Design Drafting Technology, Automotive Technology, \nPhysical Therapy, and Electronics Engineering Technology. \n26.  Because of its range of academic offerings, as well as the paucity of other public \ntechnical colleges in the geographic area, the College provides a unique opportunity for students \nin the surrounding communities, including other nearby states. \n27.  The College has a longstanding reputation for producing graduates with valued \ntechnical and interpersonal skills. \n28.  Never in the Collegeโs 50-year history has it instituted any kind of mandatory \ndrug-testing program for all students, nor has the College ever identified drug use among its \nstudents as a significant problem. \n29.  Each of the Named Plaintiffs enrolled at the College for the Fall 2011 semester, \nwhich began on August 23, 2011.  \n30.  In addition to their General Education courses, the Named Plaintiffs are seeking \n  5\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 180   Filed 06/10/13   Page 5 of 11\n\ndegrees in several different program areas, including Electronics Engineering Technology, \nDesign Drafting Technology, and Heating, Ventilation, & Air Conditioning Technology, none of \nwhich require the use of heavy machinery. \n31.  The College, under the direction of Defendants, adopted a drug-testing policy on \nJune 17, 2011, that would require mandatory testing of all first-year degree- or certificate-\nseeking students at the College, as well as all degree- or certificate-seeking students returning to \nthe College after one or more semesters of non-enrollment at the Collegeโs main campus or any \nother Linn State Technical College location.   \n32.  The procedures for the new mandatory drug-testing policy were issued on or \nabout September 6, 2011, just prior to the commencement of the Fall 2011 semester. \n33.  On or about September 7, 2011, Linn State officials began removing students \nfrom class in small groups in order to conduct the drug screening. \n34.  Drug testing is mandatory.  Refusal to take a drug test will result in an \nadministrative or student-initiated withdrawal from the College.  \n35.  Students are charged a non-refundable $50 fee to participate in the mandatory \ndrug test.  \n36.  Students will be tested by the collection and analysis of their urine. \n37.  The analysis conducted on the studentsโ urine will be an eleven-panel test to \nidentify the following drugs: Cocaine, Amphetamines/Methamphetamines, Marijuana, Opiates, \nPhencyclidine, Benzodiazepines, Barbiturates, Methadone, Methaqualone, Propoxyphene, and \nOxycodone.  \n38.   Students whose drug test is positive will have approximately 45 days to retest, \nwith a negative result, in order to avoid being involuntarily withdrawn from the College. They \nalso will be placed on probation, and, depending on the drug detected, will be required to \n  6\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 180   Filed 06/10/13   Page 6 of 11\n\ncomplete either an online educational program at their own cost or to complete unidentified \nโappropriate activities.โ \n39.  Students who fail the second drug test will be involuntarily withdrawn from the \nCollege.   \n40.  Students who pass the initial test will not be tested again without cause at any \nother point during their enrollment at the College, unless they withdraw from the College for \nmore than one semester and subsequently re-enroll. \n41.  Students who are withdrawn because they test positive a second time will not be \nrefunded for the costs for their classes if the withdrawal occurs after the normal refund period. \n42.  The College does not have any greater student drug use issue than other colleges. \n43.  There is no evidence of a current, nationwide epidemic of drug-use among college \nstudents.  \n44.  According to the Collegeโs website, the reason for the drug-testing policy is as \nfollows: โThe mission of [the College] is to prepare students for profitable employment and a life \nof learning.  Drug screening is becoming an increasingly important part of the world of work.  It \nis also believed it will better provide a safe, healthy, and productive environment for everyone \nwho learns and works at LSTC by detecting, preventing, and deterring drug use and abuse \namong students.โ \n45.  On August 15, 2011, the American Civil Liberties Union of Eastern Missouri \nwrote to Claycomb to โdemand that [he] suspend the policy immediately and to put [the College] \non notice that implementation of the policy will violate the clearly established constitutional \nrights of students.โ \n46.  The collection of urine specimens from students began on or about September 7, \n2011.  \n  7\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 180   Filed 06/10/13   Page 7 of 11\n\n47.  Each Named Plaintiff was required to, and did, provide a urine specimen pursuant \nto the challenged policy. \n48.  Upon information and belief, each member of Class enrolled at the College in the \nFall 2011 semester was required to provide, and has provided, a urine specimen pursuant to the \nchallenged policy. \n49.  Upon information and belief, each member of the Class that will enroll at the \nCollege in the Fall 2013 semester will be required to provide a urine specimen pursuant to the \nchallenged policy without regard to the memberโs course of study. \n50.  Upon information and belief, analysis of the urine specimens that have been \ncollected to this point has been completed, but the results of the drug screenings have not yet \nbeen provide to Defendants. \n51.  In developing, approving, and implementing the Collegeโs drug-testing policy, \nDefendants act under color of state law. \nCOUNT I \n \nThe Drug-Testing Policy is Unconstitutional \n Under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments \n \n52.  The Named Plaintiffs repeat, re-allege, and incorporate by reference the \nallegations in the foregoing paragraphs of this Complaint as fully set forth herein. \n53.  The Named Plaintiffs have a reasonable expectation of privacy against the state in \nthe chemical content of their urine. \n54.  Members of the Class have a reasonable expectation of privacy against the state in \nthe chemical content of their urine. \n55.  The drug tests required by Defendantsโ policy constitute a search under the Fourth \nAmendment. \n  8\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 180   Filed 06/10/13   Page 8 of 11\n\n56.  The policy requires the Named Plaintiffs and members of the Class to submit to a \nsearch without any individualized suspicion.  \n57.  Defendants cannot show the presence of a special need for the drug-testing policy \nthat is sufficient to outweigh the individual privacy expectations of some or all of the Named \nPlaintiffs and members of the Class.   \n58.  The Named Plaintiffs and Members of the Class have been harmed by being \nrequired by Defendants to provide a specimen of their urine in violation of the Fourth \nAmendment. \nWHEREFORE, the Plaintiff prays this Court grant the following relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \nยง 1983:  \nA.  Certify a Class of current and future students of Linn State Technical \nCollege who are, or will be, seeking degrees or certificates at the Collegeโs \nmain campus, or any Linn State Technical College location; \nB.  Enter declaratory judgment finding Defendantsโ drug-testing policy \nunconstitutional on its face or as-applied; \nC.  Issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent \ninjunction to prevent the deprivation of the constitutional rights of the \nNamed Plaintiffs and members the Class; \nD.  Issue a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants from imposing any \nfee for any unconstitutional drug tests and requiring Defendants to credit \nany fees already assessed for unconstitutional instances of mandatory \ndrug-testing;   \nE.  Issue an injunction requiring Defendants to return or destroy all specimens \ncollected unconstitutionally during the time in which the policy was not \n  9\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 180   Filed 06/10/13   Page 9 of 11\n\nenjoined; \nF.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE\nWESTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI\nCENTRAL DIVISION\nMICHAEL BARRETT, IV, et al., )\n)\nPlaintiffs, )\n)\nv. ) Case No. 11-cv-04242-NKL\n)\nDONALD CLAYCOMB, et al.,  )\n)\nDefendant. )\n)\n)\nORDER\nBefore the Court is the Motion to certify class [Doc. # 6] filed by Plaintiffs as putative\nclass representatives.  For the following reasons, the Court grants the motion. \nI. Background\nPlaintiffs Michael Barrett, IV, and others, are students at Linn State Technical College\nwho brought this action against Donald Claycombโin his official capacity as President of the\nBoard of Regents at Linn State Technical College (โLinn Techโ)โand others, claiming that\nLinn Techโs new policy of subjecting all of its students to suspicionless drug testing violates\nthe studentsโ Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches by the\ngovernment.\nThe policy adopted by Linn Techโs Board required all new students seeking a degree\nor certificate, as well as any students returning to Linn Tech after absence of a semester or\nmore, to submit to a mandatory drug test by urinalysis.  All students tested under the policy\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 94   Filed 11/15/11   Page 1 of 8\n\nhad to pay fifty dollars to cover the cost of testing.  Students wishing to be exempted from\ntesting could petition the President before testing and provide reasons why they should not\nbe tested.\nBarrett now moves for certification of the following class: โcurrent, and future,\nstudents of Linn State Technical College who are, or will be, seeking degrees or certificates\nat the main campus of the College in Linn, Missouri, or any other Linn State Technical\nCollege location.โ  [Doc. # 28 at 4].\nII. Discussion\nA motion for class certification involves a two-part analysis.  First, the movant must\ndemonstrate that the proposed class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(a): \n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,\n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class,\n(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or\ndefenses of the class, and\n(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the\nclass.  \nFed. R. Civ. P.  23(a).  Second, Barrett must demonstrate that the proposed class fits into one\nof the three categories identified in Rule 23(b).  \nBarrett bears the burden of showing that the Rule 23 requirements are met and that\nthe class should be certified.  Coleman v. Watt, 40 F.3d 255, 258 (8th Cir. 1994).  To\ndetermine whether class certification is appropriate, the Court must conduct a limited\npreliminary inquiry, looking behind the pleadings.  Blades v. Monsanto Co., 400 F.3d 562,\n567 (8th Cir. 2005).  โIn conducting this preliminary inquiry, however, the Court must look\n2\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 94   Filed 11/15/11   Page 2 of 8\n\nonly so far as to determine whether, given the factual setting of the case, if the plaintiffs[โ]\ngeneral allegations are true, common evidence could suffice to make out a prima facie case\nfor the class.โ  Id. at 566.  In considering class certification motions, the Court liberally\nconstrues Rule 23(a) and does not resolve the merits of the dispute.  See Gunnells v.\nHealthplan Services, Inc., 348 F.3d 417, 424 (4th Cir. 2003).\nA. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)\n1. Numerosity\nTo address the numerosity requirement, the Court should examine the number of\npersons in a proposed class, the nature of the action, the size of the individual claims and the\ninconvenience of trying individual claims, as well as other factors.  Paxton v. Union Natโl\nBank, 688 F.2d 552, 561 (8th Cir. 1982).  \nThe proposed class could include over 1,100 current students at Linn Tech, as well\nas an unknown number of future students.  Claycomb argues that this number is inaccurate\nbecause many students might actually support the policy and refuse to join the lawsuit.\nClaycomb points out that no student has complained about the policy to the school and that\nBarrettโs attorneys had difficulty finding students on the Linn Tech campus to join the\nlawsuit as named Plaintiffs.  But the Court need not engage in such speculation at this early\nstage of the lawsuit.  Currently, there are four students willing to challenge Linn Techโs\npolicy as named Plaintiffs.  Now that a lawsuit is pending that will decide the Fourth\nAmendment rights of each member in the proposed class, these students are more likely to,\nand certainly have the right to, join the lawsuit.  Claycomb also  argues that the number of\n3\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 94   Filed 11/15/11   Page 3 of 8\n\nstudents involved in this action might further be reduced because some students are already\ntested under preexisting policies not being challenged by Barrett, or because some students\nmight successfully petition to be exempted from testing.  Despite these arguments, given the\nlarge initial  number of potential plaintiffs, and because of the fluid nature of this class (the\nlitigation is about to pass into a new semester and will thus affect different students), it would\nbe impracticable to require individual lawsuits. \n2. Commonality\nThe commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2) is satisfied when the legal question\nโlinking the class members is substantially related to the resolution of the litigation even\nthough the individuals are not identically situated.โ  Paxton, 688 F.2d at 561 (citation\nomitted).  To determine whether common questions of law or fact predominate, a court must\nconduct a limited preliminary inquiry, looking behind the pleadings.  Blades, 400 F.3d at\n567.\nUnder Barrettโs claims, it appears each class member is identically situated in that  the\nchallenged drug testing policy applies in the same way to each of them and thus implicates\neach of their Fourth Amendment rights in the same way.  Claycombโs only argument to the\ncontrary is that one named PlaintiffโJohn Doeโhas asserted that he wishes to engage in\nillegal activity, which distinguished him from the class in general.  But the use of illegal\ndrugs is for the criminal justice system to judge, not a suit aimed at preventing the State from\nviolating the Fourth Amendment.  Thus, the Court finds no merit in this argument.\n3. Typicality\n4\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 94   Filed 11/15/11   Page 4 of 8\n\nThe third requirement of Rule 23(a)(3) is that โthe claims or  defenses  of  the\nrepresentative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.โ   Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(a).  Typicality means that there are โother members of the class who have the same or\nsimilar grievances as the plaintiff.โ  Donaldson v. Pillsbury Co., 554 F.2d 825, 830 (8th Cir.\n1977).  The burden is โeasily met so long as other class members have claims similar to the\nnamed plaintiff.โ  DeBoer v. Mellon Mortg. Co., 64 F.3d 1171, 1174 (8th Cir. 1995).\nAs discussed above, the named Plaintiffs and proposed class members appear to be\nidentically situated under the claims alleged in Barrettโs amended complaint.  Claycombโs\nargument  that  some  students  are  already  being  tested  by  their  private  employers  is\nirrelevantโthose students still have the same Fourth Amendment right not to be unreasonably\nsearched by Linn Tech, which is a state actor.  \nClaycombโs argument that most students work with dangerous machinery is also not\npersuasive.  Because the Fourth Amendment requires a balancing test, it is possible that it\nwill apply differently based on the danger of different courses offered by Linn Tech.  See\nBd. of Educ. of Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 92 of Pottawatomie Cnty v. Earls, 536 U.S. 822, 829-30\n(2002).  To the extent that these differences render class litigation unmanageable, the Court\ncan later create subclasses.  Further, to sort out  at this stage the legal significance of varying\ndegrees of safety at the College, would require resolution of the merits which is not properly\ndone at the class certification stage.  \nFinally, Claycombโs argument that โ[m]any [students] may actually be upset if the\ndrug screening program is discontinued,โ [Doc. # 49 at 3] is not persuasive.  Such students\n5\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 94   Filed 11/15/11   Page 5 of 8\n\ncan execute written permission for suspicionless searches, but there is no evidence that this\nhas been done.  Absent such a waiver, the students who prefer to waive their Fourth\nAmendment rights are in the same legal position as students who oppose the policy.\nClaycombโs argument also does not account for future students who may not have made up\ntheir mind on the issue one way or another, or students who currently favor the policy but\nmay  later change their minds.\n4. Adequacy\nThe final requirement of Rule 23(a) is that the class representative and class counsel\nmust โfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) (4).  The\npurpose of the adequacy requirement is to ensure that there are no potential โconflicts of\ninterest between the named parties and the class they seek to represent.โ  Amchem Products,\nInc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 625 (1997). \nClaycomb argues that Barrettโs attorneys are inadequate because the policy objectives\nof the Plaintiffโs attorneys in trying to stop any form of drug screening might conflict with\nthe position of students who support the current drug testing policy, or who would support\nsome compromise in policy that the Plaintiffโs attorney would reject.  First, it is ultimately\nthe Plaintiffs that control settlement and prosecution of the lawsuit, not their attorneys.\nSecond, the only relevant question here is whether the Plaintiffโs and Plaintiffsโ  attorneys\nwill adequately represent the class to resolve the question of whether suspicionless drug\ntesting violates the  Fourth Amendment.  The request to stop drug screening is only related\nto that question - not whether drug testing should or should not be done as a matter of policy.\n6\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 94   Filed 11/15/11   Page 6 of 8\n\n Since there is no evidence that the Plaintiff and Plaintiffsโ attorneys will not faithfully\nrepresent the class on the issue actually pending,  the Court concludes that the class\nrepresentation prong of Rule 23 has been satisfied.  \nBecause class actions of this nature are specifically intended to address questions that\naffect a group as whole and to insure there is consistency in the application of the law, it\nwould be contrary to the purpose of class actions to deny certification because some\nmembers might not want to litigate the issue in dispute.  Indeed, the Defendants as well as\nthe class benefit from having the issue resolved for everyone, so that piecemeal litigation for\nand against the policy is avoided.  Students at any time can express their individual support\nfor the policy or can execute waivers of any Fourth Amendment rights they have.  However,\nthey do not have the right to prevent the matter being resolved as a class action.  \nB. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)\nIn  addition  to  meeting  the  requirements  of  Rule  23(a),  a  case  must  meet  the\nrequirements of one of the subsections of Rule 23(b) in order to proceed as a class action. \nBarrett asks the Court to certify the proposed class under Rule 23(b)(2).  That  Rule\nallows class treatment when โthe party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on\ngrounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding\ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 (b)(2).\nโBecause one purpose of Rule 23(b)(2) was to enable plaintiffs to bring lawsuits vindicating\ncivil rights, the rule must be read liberally in the context of civil rights suits.โ  Coley v.\nClinton, 635 F.2d 1364, 1378 (8th Cir. 1980) (internal quotes omitted).  \n7\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 94   Filed 11/15/11   Page 7 of 8\n\nBarrettโs claim meets the requirements for certification under Rule 23(b)(2).  Barrett\nhas alleged that Linn Tech instituted a policy that violates the Fourth Amendment rights of\neach proposed class member in the exact same way.  The fact that Linn Tech has a system\nto petition for exemption from the drug screening or to appeal unfavorable results, does not\nmean that its policy does not affect all students in the same way.  Each must be drug tested\nand each has the right to petition to be excused.  Claycombโs argument to the contrary, also\nignores that the legal significance of its petition and appeal programs is a disputed legal\nissue, the resolution of which bears on the Fourth Amendment rights of each proposed class\nmember.  Thus, Linn Techโs system of petitions and appeals is itself another action that\napplies generally to the class.\nIII. Conclusion\nAccordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that the Motion to certify class [Doc. # 6] filed\nby Plaintiffs as putative class representatives is GRANTED.\ns/ Nanette K.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE\nWESTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI\nCENTRAL DIVISION\nMICHAEL BARRETT, IV, et al., )\n)\nPlaintiffs, )\n)\nv. ) Case No. 11-cv-04242-NKL\n)\nDONALD CLAYCOMB, et al.,  )\n)\nDefendant. )\n)\n)\nORDER\nThe Court held a hearing on October 25, 2011, on Plaintiffsโ Motion for\nPreliminary Injunction [Doc. # 4].  The Court sought agreement by the parties to resolve\nthe Motion for Permanent Injunction at the same time it resolved the Preliminary\nInjunction motion.  There was no agreement because Defendants asked for more time to\ndevelop the factual record.  Therefore, the Court has been placed in the position of\nresolving the Motion for Preliminary Injunction on an incomplete record.  Within that\nlimitation, the Court now finds that a preliminary injunction should issue until a full\nfactual record can be developed.\nFirst, Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if their urine is tested and the results\ngiven to Defendants before Plaintiffsโ constitutional claims are resolved.  Otherwise,\nPlaintiffsโ only remedy, if they are successful, will be damages and damages cannot\nadequately address the Plaintiffsโ loss of a constitutional right under these circumstances. \nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 99   Filed 11/18/11   Page 1 of 4\n\nFurther, the risk of damages is not in Defendantsโ interest during difficult economic\ntimes.  Second, Defendants will not suffer harm if the status quo is maintained.  Linn\nState Technical College  has operated successfully and safely since the 1960s without\ndrug or alcohol testing.  No drug related injury has ever been identified at the College. \nTherefore, the balance of equities favor the status quo until resolution on a full record.\n The Court must also consider the merits of the Plaintiffsโ case to determine\nwhether a preliminary injunction should issue.  A party seeking a preliminary injunction\nregarding the implementation of  a โduly enacted state statuteโ must demonstrate that they\nare โlikely to prevailโ on the merits,  because โgovernmental policies implemented\nthrough legislation or regulations developed through presumptively reasoned democratic\nprocess are entitled to a higher degree of deference and should not be enjoined lightly.โ  \nPlanned Parenthood v. Rounds, 530 F.3d 724, 732 (8th Cir. 2008). (citation omitted).\nDefendants  argue that because they โare the President and members of a decision-making\nbody of a state entity, whose regulations have the force of state statuteโ the โlikely to\nprevailโ standard should control here.  [Doc. # 50 at 3].  However, Defendants cite no\nauthority for the proposition that their actions have the force of state statute and cite no\ncase applying the more rigorous โlikely to prevailโ standard to circumstances analogous\nto their insular, non-democratic decision-making process.  \nThe Eighth Circuit explained that โ[w]here preliminary injunctions are sought to\nenjoin city ordinances or administrative actions by federal, state or local government\nagenciesโ the test that the Eighth Circuit has adopted from the Second Circuit\nโexamine[s] the circumstances surrounding such government actions to determine to what\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 99   Filed 11/18/11   Page 2 of 4\n\nextent the challenged action represents the full play of the democratic process.โ  Planned\nParenthood v. Rounds, 530 F.3d 724, 733, n.6 (8th Cir. 2008) (internal quotes omitted). \nThe case that the Eight Circuit cited for this proposition discussed how courts within the\nSecond Circuit had applied the โfair chanceโ standard to a policy โformulated solely by\nthe executive branchโ and a method adopted by an agency โaltogether outside a\nregulatory framework,โ but applied the โlikely to prevailโ standard to a policy in which\nโCongress and the President engaged in lengthy public debate before\nformulating...enacting and signing the legislation implementing it.โ  Able v. U.S., 44 F.3d\n128, 131-32 (2d Cir. 1995). The Court finds the drug-testing policy adopted by the\nDefendants more analogous to the first two cases discussed in Able than to the third case,\nand thus finds that Plaintiffs need only show a fair chance of success.  However, under\neither standard, the Court would grant the Motion for Preliminary Injunction.  \nThe Court finds that there is a fair/likely chance that Defendantsโ drug testing\nprogram will fail Fourth Amendment scrutiny because it is over broad.  Many students\nwho have been tested are not involved with heavy equipment and hazardous working\nconditions at the college.  Therefore, it is unlikely that Defendants have any special need\nto test those students.  Thus, there is a fair/likely chance that the Defendantsโ drug testing\nprogram will be found to be systemically over broad as currently conceived.\nThe Defendantsโ argument that they have corrected this over breadth concern by\nallowing students to petition the President to be excused from testing for undefined\nreasons or to appeal the results is not persuasive.  Defendants have  pointed to no\nauthority that allows a state actor to impose a search on a broad population - unreasonable\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 99   Filed 11/18/11   Page 3 of 4\n\nas to some membersโ and rely on those members to โopt inโ to their Fourth Amendment\nrights. Absent some authority for this significant departure from the norm, the Court\ncannot say at this time that the Defendants will succeed on this defense.\nAccordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ Motion for Preliminary\nInjunction is GRANTED, subject to the same bond previously filed in response to the\nMotion for Temporary Restraining Order.\ns/ NANETTE K.

Linn State Technical College (โLinn Stateโ or โCollegeโ) is making news.  It is \nseeking the dubious distinction of becoming the first public college in the country to require its \nstudents, who are 18 years old or above, to submit to mandatory drug testing as a condition of \ntheir continued enrollment, despite the fact that the College has had no documented drug \nproblems over the course of its 50-year history and no reason to suspect that the students subject \nto testing have been engaged in the use or abuse of illegal drugs. \n2.  Linn State is a two-year, publicly funded college established by Missouri statute \nand governed by a Board of Regents appointed by the Governor.  \n3.  The mandatory, suspicionless drug testing required under the Collegeโs new \npolicy is a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Ordinarily, the Fourth \nAmendment prohibits such searches, with some exceptions, none of which are applicable here. \nMoreover, the College can demonstrate no legitimate special need for drug testing its students \nthat is sufficient to outweigh the studentsโ individual privacy expectations against the state.  \n4.  The implementation of this unconstitutional drug-testing program is began, and \nPlaintiffs, along with other members of the Class, will be irreparably harmed if they are forced to \nsurrender their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by submitting to a search by the \ngovernment, or by refusing to consent to such a search and thereby causing their removal from \nthe College. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 USC ยงยง 1331, 1343, 2201 and 42 USC ยง \n1983. \n6.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 USC ยง 1391(b) and L.R. 3.1(A)(2).  \nThe actions giving rise to this case are occurring in Osage County, Missouri. \n  2\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 28   Filed 09/21/11   Page 2 of 11\n\nPARTIES \n7.  Plaintiff Michael Barrett, IV, is a newly classified degree-seeking student at Linn \nState Technical College, who is enrolled for the Fall 2011 semester in the Electronics \nEngineering Technology Program.  He was required, as a condition of continued enrollment, to \nsubmit to a suspicionless drug test on or about September 13, 2011. \n8.   Plaintiff Shawn Kurgas is a newly classified degree-seeking student at Linn State \nTechnical College, who is enrolled for the Fall 2011 semester in the Electronics Engineering \nTechnology Program.  He was required, as a condition of continued enrollment, to submit to a \nsuspicionless drug test on or about September 7, 2011. \n9.  Plaintiff Jacob Curliss is a newly classified degree-seeking student at Linn State \nTechnical College, who is enrolled for the Fall 2011 semester in the Design Drafting Technology \nProgram.  He was required, as a condition of continued enrollment, to submit to a suspicionless \ndrug test on or about September 7, 2011. \n10.  Plaintiff Branden Kittle-Aikeley is a newly classified degree-seeking student at \nLinn State Technical College, who is enrolled for the Fall 2011 semester in the Heating, \nVentilation, & Air Conditioning Technology Program.  He was required, as a condition of \ncontinued enrollment, to submit to a suspicionless drug test on or about September 7, 2011. \n11.  Plaintiff John Doe is a newly classified degree-seeking student at Linn State \nTechnical College, who is enrolled for the Fall 2011 semester in the Design Drafting Technology \nProgram.  He was required, as a condition of continued enrollment, to submit to a suspicionless \ndrug test on or about September 7, 2011. \n12.  Defendant Donald M. Claycomb is the President of Linn State Technical College.  \nAs President, Claycomb is responsible for creating and implementing policies for operation and \nsupervision of the College.  He is sued in his official capacity only.  \n  3\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 28   Filed 09/21/11   Page 3 of 11\n\n13.  Defendants Toni R. Schwartz, John Klebba, Christopher T. Davidson, Diane \nBenetz, Mark J. Collom, Kenneth L. Miller, and Erick V. Kern are members of the Linn State \nTechnical College Board of Regents, which is the governing board for Linn State Technical \nCollege.  They are sued in their official capacities only. \nPLAINTIFF CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n14.     The Named Plaintiffs are members of a Class of current, and future, students of \nLinn State Technical College who are, or will be, seeking degrees or certificates at the main \ncampus of the College in Linn, Missouri, or any other Linn State Technical College location.  \n15.  The total enrollment at the College exceeds 1,100 students; thus, the number of \nindividuals in the Class of current, and future, students who are, or will be, seeking degrees or \ncertificates at the College is so numerous that joinder of all members of the Class would be \nimpracticable. \n16.  There are questions of law and fact that are common to the Class, including, but \nnot limited to, the legal questions of whether Defendantsโ drug-testing policy impermissibly \ninfringes the class membersโ Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and whether the \ngovernment can show a โspecial needโ sufficient to outweigh the Class membersโ individual \nprivacy expectations against the state. \n17.  The claims of the Named Plaintiffs that the drug-testing policy developed by the \nCollege impermissibly infringes on their rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments are \ntypical of the claims of the Class. \n18.  As current students subject to the Collegeโs new drug-testing policy, the Named \nPlaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. \n19.  Defendantsโ drug-testing policy requires Defendants to act on grounds generally \napplicable to the Class, thereby making it appropriate for this Court to grant injunctive relief, and \n  4\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 28   Filed 09/21/11   Page 4 of 11\n\nany corresponding declaratory relief, to the Class as a whole. \nFACTS \n20.   The College has been offering academic programs since 1961. \n21.  The College was established by, and continues to operate under the authority of, \nMissouri statutes. See Mo. Rev. Stat. ยง 178.631, et seq.  \n22.  The College was originally established with funding from the National Defense \nEducation Act as a post-secondary residential technical institution. \n23.  The Collegeโs founding philosophy was to provide two-year vocational and \ntechnical programs to all students who wish to prepare themselves for employment. \n24.  The College is Missouriโs only two-year public technical college with a statewide \nmission. \n25.  The College originated as Linn Technical Junior College, but in 1995, by passage \nof a statute, became a part of the public higher education system in Missouri. \n26.  The College now offers more than 35 academic programs in a wide range of \nfields, including Computer Programming, Design Drafting Technology, Automotive Technology, \nPhysical Therapy, and Electronics Engineering Technology. \n27.  Because of its range of academic offerings, as well as the paucity of other public \ntechnical colleges in the geographic area, the College provides a unique opportunity for students \nin the surrounding communities, including other nearby states. \n28.  The College has a longstanding reputation for producing graduates with valued \ntechnical and interpersonal skills. \n29.  Never in the Collegeโs 50-year history has it instituted any kind of mandatory \ndrug-testing program, nor has the College ever identified drug use among its students as a \nsignificant problem. \n  5\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 28   Filed 09/21/11   Page 5 of 11\n\n30.  Each of the Named Plaintiffs enrolled at the College for the Fall 2011 semester, \nwhich began on August 23, 2011.  \n31.  In addition to their General Education courses, the Named Plaintiffs are seeking \ndegrees in several different program areas, including Electronics Engineering Technology, \nDesign Drafting Technology, and Heating, Ventilation, & Air Conditioning Technology, none of \nwhich require the use of heavy machinery. \n32.  The College, under the direction of Defendants, adopted a drug-testing policy that \nwould require mandatory testing of all first-year degree- or certificate-seeking students at the \nCollege, as well as all degree- or certificate-seeking students returning to the College after one or \nmore semesters of non-enrollment at the Collegeโs main campus or any other Linn State \nTechnical College location.   \n33.  The new mandatory drug-testing policy was issued on or about September 6, \n2011, just prior to the commencement of the Fall 2011 semester. \n34.  On or about September 7, 2011, Linn State officials began removing students \nfrom class in small groups in order to conduct the drug screening. \n35.  Drug testing is mandatory.  Refusal to take a drug test will result in an \nadministrative or student-initiated withdrawal from the College.  \n36.  Students are charged a non-refundable $50 fee to participate in the mandatory \ndrug test.  \n37.  Students will be tested by the collection and analysis of their urine. \n38.  The analysis conducted on the studentsโ urine will be an eleven-panel test to \nidentify the following drugs: Cocaine, Amphetamines/Methamphetamines, Marijuana, Opiates, \nPhencyclidine, Benzodiazepines, Barbiturates, Methadone, Methaqualone, Propoxyphene, and \nOxycodone.  \n  6\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 28   Filed 09/21/11   Page 6 of 11\n\n39.   Students whose drug test is positive will have approximately 45 days to retest, \nwith a negative result, in order to avoid being involuntarily withdrawn from the College. They \nalso will be placed on probation, and, depending on the drug detected, will be required to \ncomplete either an online educational program at their own cost or to complete unidentified \nโappropriate activities.โ \n40.  Students who fail the second drug test will be involuntarily withdrawn from the \nCollege.   \n41.  Students who pass the initial test will not be tested again without cause at any \nother point during their enrollment at the College, unless they withdraw from the College for \nmore than one semester and subsequently re-enroll. \n42.  Students who are withdrawn because they test positive a second time will not be \nrefunded for the costs for their classes if the withdrawal occurs after the normal refund period. \n43.  According to the Collegeโs website, the College does not have any greater student \ndrug use issue than other colleges. \n44.  According to the Collegeโs website, the reason for the drug-testing policy is as \nfollows: โThe mission of [the College] is to prepare students for profitable employment and a life \nof learning.  Drug screening is becoming an increasingly important part of the world of work.  It \nis also believed it will better provide a safe, healthy, and productive environment for everyone \nwho learns and works at LSTC by detecting, preventing, and deterring drug use and abuse \namong students.โ \n45.  On August 15, 2011, the American Civil Liberties Union of Eastern Missouri \nwrote to Claycomb to โdemand that [he] suspend the policy immediately and to put [the College] \non notice that implementation of the policy will violate the clearly established constitutional \nrights of students.โ \n  7\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 28   Filed 09/21/11   Page 7 of 11\n\n \n46.  The collection of urine specimens from students began on or about September 7, \n2011.  \n47.  Each Named Plaintiff was required to, and did, provide a urine specimen pursuant \nto the challenged policy. \n48.

Linn State Technical College (โLinn Stateโ or โCollegeโ) is making news.  It is \nseeking the dubious distinction of becoming the first public college in the country to require its \nstudents, all of whom are 18 years old or above, to submit to mandatory drug testing as a \ncondition of their continued enrollment, despite the fact that the College has had no documented \ndrug problems over the course of its 50-year history and no reason to suspect that the students \nsubject to testing have been engaged in the use or abuse of illegal drugs. \n2.  Linn State is a two-year, publicly funded college established by Missouri statute \nand governed by a Board of Regents appointed by the Governor.  \n3.  The mandatory, suspicionless drug testing required under the Collegeโs new \npolicy is a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Ordinarily, the Fourth \nAmendment prohibits such searches, with some exceptions, none of which are applicable here. \nMoreover, the College can demonstrate no legitimate special need for drug testing its students \nthat is sufficient to outweigh the studentsโ individual privacy expectations against the state.  \n4.  The implementation of this unconstitutional drug-testing program is imminent, \nand Plaintiff, along with other members of the Class, will be irreparably harmed if they are \nforced to surrender their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by submitting to a search by \nthe government, or by refusing to consent to such a search and thereby causing their removal \nfrom the College. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 USC ยงยง 1331, 1343, 2201 and 42 USC ยง \n1983. \n6.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 USC ยง 1391(b) and L.R. 3.1(A)(2).  \nThe actions giving rise to this case are occurring in Osage County, Missouri. \n  2\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 1   Filed 09/14/11   Page 2 of 9\n\nPARTIES \n7.  Plaintiff Michael Barrett, IV, is a newly classified degree-seeking student at Linn \nState Technical College, who is enrolled for the Fall 2011 semester in the Electronics \nEngineering Technology Program.  He was required, as a condition of continued enrollment, to \nsubmit to a suspicionless drug test on or about September 13, 2011. \n8.   Plaintiff Shawn Kurgas is a newly classified degree-seeking student at Linn State \nTechnical College, who is enrolled for the Fall 2011 semester in the Electronics Engineering \nTechnology Program.  He was required, as a condition of continued enrollment, to submit to a \nsuspicionless drug test on or about September 7, 2011. \n9.  Plaintiff Jacob Curliss is a newly classified degree-seeking student at Linn State \nTechnical College, who is enrolled for the Fall 2011 semester in the Design Drafting Technology \nProgram.  He was required, as a condition of continued enrollment, to submit to a suspicionless \ndrug test on or about September 7, 2011. \n10.  Plaintiff Ashley Minter is a newly classified degree-seeking student at Linn State \nTechnical College, who is enrolled for the Fall 2011 semester in the Electronics Engineering \nTechnology Program.  She was required, as a condition of continued enrollment, to submit to a \nsuspicionless drug test on or about September 7, 2011. \n11.  Plaintiff Branden Kittle-Aikeley is a newly classified degree-seeking student at \nLinn State Technical College, who is enrolled for the Fall 2011 semester in the Heating, \nVentilation, & Air Conditioning Technology Program.  He was required, as a condition of \ncontinued enrollment, to submit to a suspicionless drug test on or about September 7, 2011. \n12.  Plaintiff John Doe is a newly classified degree-seeking student at Linn State \nTechnical College, who is enrolled for the Fall 2011 semester in the Design Drafting Technology \nProgram.  He was required, as a condition of continued enrollment, to submit to a suspicionless \n  3\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 1   Filed 09/14/11   Page 3 of 9\n\ndrug test on or about September 7, 2011. \n13.  Defendant Donald M. Claycomb is the President of Linn State Technical College.  \nAs President, Claycomb is responsible for creating and implementing policies for operation and \nsupervision of the College.  He is sued in his official capacity only.  \n14.  Defendants Toni R. Schwartz, John Klebba, Christopher T. Davidson, Diane \nBenetz, Mark J. Collom, Kenneth L. Miller, and Erick V. Kern are members of the Linn State \nTechnical College Board of Regents, which is the governing board for Linn State Technical \nCollege.  They are sued in their official capacities only. \nPLAINTIFF CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n15.     The Named Plaintiffs are members of a Class of current, and future, students of \nLinn State Technical College who are, or will be, seeking degrees or certificates at the main \ncampus of the College in Linn, Missouri, or any other Linn State Technical College locations.  \n16.  The total enrollment at the College exceeds 1,100 students; thus, the number of \nindividuals in the Class of current, and future, students who are, or will be, seeking degrees or \ncertificates at the College is so numerous that joinder of all members of the Class would be \nimpracticable. \n17.  There are questions of law and fact that are common to the Class, including, but \nnot limited to the legal questions of whether Defendantsโ drug-testing policy impermissibly \ninfringes the class membersโ Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and whether the \ngovernment can show a โspecial needโ sufficient to outweigh the Class membersโ individual \nprivacy expectations against the state. \n18.  The claims of the Named Plaintiffs that the drug-testing policy developed by the \nCollege impermissibly infringes on their rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments are \ntypical of the claims of the Class. \n  4\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 1   Filed 09/14/11   Page 4 of 9\n\n19.  As current students subject to the Collegeโs new drug-testing policy, the Named \nPlaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. \n20.  Defendantsโ drug-testing policy requires Defendants to act on grounds generally \napplicable to the Class, thereby making it appropriate for this Court to grant injunctive relief, and \nany corresponding declaratory relief, to the Class as a whole. \nFACTS \n21.   The College has been offering academic programs since 1961. \n22.  The College was established by, and continues to operate under the authority of, \nMissouri statutes. See Mo. Rev. Stat. ยง 178.631, et seq.  \n23.  The College was originally established with funding from the National Defense \nEducation Act as a post-secondary residential technical institution. \n24.  The Collegeโs founding philosophy was to provide two-year vocational and \ntechnical programs to all students who wish to prepare themselves for employment. \n25.  The College is Missouriโs only two-year public technical college with a statewide \nmission. \n26.  The College originated as Linn Technical Junior College, but in 1995, by passage \nof a statute, became a part of the public higher education system in Missouri. \n27.  The College now offers more than 35 academic programs in a wide range of \nfields, including Computer Programming, Design Drafting Technology, Automotive Technology, \nPhysical Therapy, and Electronics Engineering Technology. \n28.  Because of its range of academic offerings, as well as the paucity of other public \ntechnical colleges in the geographic area, the College provides a unique opportunity for students \nin the surrounding communities, including other nearby states. \n29.  The College has a longstanding reputation for producing graduates with valued \n  5\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 1   Filed 09/14/11   Page 5 of 9\n\ntechnical and interpersonal skills. \n30.  Never in the Collegeโs 50-year history has it instituted any kind of mandatory \ndrug-testing program, nor has the College ever identified drug use among its students as a \nsignificant problem. \n31.  Each of the Named Plaintiffs enrolled at the College for the Fall 2011 semester, \nwhich began on August 23, 2011.  \n32.  In addition to their General Education courses, the Named Plaintiffs are seeking \ndegrees in several different program areas, including Electronics Engineering Technology, \nDesign Drafting Technology, and Heating, Ventilation, & Air Conditioning Technology, none of \nwhich require the use of heavy machinery. \n33.  The College, under the direction of Defendants, adopted a drug-testing policy that \nwould require mandatory testing of all first-year degree- or certificate-seeking students at the \nCollege, as well as all degree- or certificate-seeking students returning to the College after one or \nmore semesters of non-enrollment at the Collegeโs main campus or any other Linn State \nTechnical College location.   \n34.  The new mandatory drug-testing policy was issued on or about September 6, \n2011, just prior to the commencement of the Fall 2011 semester. \n35.  On or about September 7, 2011, Linn State officials began removing students \nfrom class in small groups in order to conduct the drug screening. \n36.  Drug testing is mandatory.  Refusal to take a drug test will result in an \nadministrative or student-initiated withdrawal from the College.  \n37.  Students are charged a non-refundable $50 fee to participate in the mandatory \ndrug test.  \n38.  Students will be tested by the collection and analysis of their urine. \n  6\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 1   Filed 09/14/11   Page 6 of 9\n\n39.  The analysis conducted on the studentsโ urine will be an eleven-panel test to \nidentify the following drugs: Cocaine, Amphetamines/Methamphetamines, Marijuana, Opiates, \nPhencyclidine, Benzodiazepines, Barbiturates, Methadone, Methaqualone, Propoxyphene, and \nOxycodone.  \n40.   Students whose drug test is positive will have approximately 45 days to retest, \nwith a negative result, in order to avoid being involuntarily withdrawn from the College. They \nalso will be placed on probation, and, depending on the drug detected, will be required to \ncomplete either an online educational program at their own cost or to complete unidentified \nโappropriate activities.โ \n41.  Students who fail the second drug test will be involuntarily withdrawn from the \nCollege.   \n42.  Students who pass the initial test will not be tested again without cause at any \nother point during their enrollment at the College, unless they withdraw from the College for \nmore than one semester and subsequently re-enroll. \n43.  Students who are withdrawn because they test positive a second time will not be \nrefunded for the costs for their classes if the withdrawal occurs after the normal refund period. \n44.  According to the Collegeโs website, the College does not have any greater student \ndrug use issue than other college. \n45.  According to the Collegeโs website, the reason for the drug-testing policy is as \nfollows: โThe mission of [the College] is to prepare students for profitable employment and a life \nof learning.  Drug screening is becoming an increasingly important part of the world of work.  It \nis also believed it will better provide a safe, healthy, and productive environment for everyone \nwho learns and works at LSTC by detecting, preventing, and deterring drug use and abuse \namong students.โ \n  7\nCase 2:11-cv-04242-NKL   Document 1   Filed 09/14/11   Page 7 of 9\n\n46.  In developing, approving, and implementing the Collegeโs drug-testing policy, \nDefendants act under color of state law. \nCOUNT I \n \nThe Drug-Testing Policy is Unconstitutional \n Under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments \n \n47.  The Named Plaintiffs repeat, re-allege, and incorporate by reference the \nallegations in the foregoing paragraphs of this Complaint as fully set forth herein. \n48.  The Named Plaintiffs have a reasonable expectation of privacy against the state in \nthe chemical content of their urine. \n49.  Members of the Class have a reasonable expectation of privacy against the state in \nthe chemical content of their urine. \n50.  The drug tests required by Defendantsโ policy constitute a search under the Fourth \nAmendment. \n51.  The policy requires the Named Plaintiffs and members of the Class to submit to a \nsearch without any individualized suspicion.  \n52.  Defendants cannot show the presence of a special need for the drug-testing policy \nthat is sufficient to outweigh the individual privacy expectations of the Named Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the Class.   \nWHEREFORE, the Plaintiff prays this Court:  \nA.  Certify a Class of current and future students of Linn State Technical \nCollege who are, or will be, seeking degrees or certificates at the Collegeโs \nmain campus, or any Linn State Technical College location;. \nB.
