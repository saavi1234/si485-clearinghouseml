Initial status hearing scheduled for 5/19/21 at 9:15 a.m. Prior to the status hearing, the Court specifically requests that counsel consult the Court's standing order. If the parties believe the case is ready for a settlement conference, counsel should have available dates for a settlement conference for all necessary parties in advance of the status hearing, and to the extent possible, consult with opposing counsel in an attempt to identify mutually convenient and feasible dates for the settlement conference. Judge Weisman generally conducts settlement conferences Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays at either 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. or 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. Other dates and times may be available as required by the Court or the parties. If the parties do not wish to set a settlement conference at this time, the parties should be prepared to discuss discovery scheduling and related issues. Parties shall dial in using the Court's conference call-in number. The conference call- in number is 1-877-411-9748 and the passcode is 1814539. Please note that the Court's conference call-in will be used by all cases that are on the Court's calendar for the said date, therefore counsel must be in a quiet area while on the line and must have the telephone muted until your case is called by the Court. Once the Court has heard your case you shall disconnect from the conference line. Mailed notice (ao,) (Entered: 04/26/2021)"

The lawsuit alleged that the Village discriminated on the basis of disability in violation of the Fair Housing Act (FHA) when it prohibited a sober living facility from operating and refused to consider &nbsp;the facility&rsquo;s request for a reasonable accommodation to the Village&rsquo;s zoning code that would permit it to operate. The case was assigned to Judge Robert W. Gettleman.</p>\r\n<p>In its complaint, DOJ alleged that the Village of Hinsdale claimed the sober living facility was prohibited from operating, regardless of the number of residents it had, because it was a &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; land use under the Village&rsquo;s zoning code, which precluded it from operating in single family residential districts. On August 7, 2019, the facility had submitted a request for a reasonable accommodation to the zoning and land use laws under the FHA, which the Village refused to consider. Instead, the Village filed a lawsuit to evict the facility the day after the request was submitted. On November 6, 2019, the facility sued the Village for refusing to provide a reasonable accommodation in accordance with the FHA and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). That lawsuit, <em>Trinity Sober Living v. Village of Hinsdale</em> (1:19-cv-7321), was formally consolidated with this action on August 27, 2021. The Village took the position that &nbsp;group homes with three or more unrelated persons violate the Village&rsquo;s zoning code, effectively excluding most group homes for persons with disabilities. The Village also argued that it did not deny the facility its reasonable accommodation.</p>\r\n<p>In its lawsuit, DOJ argued that the sober living facility was a &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; within the meaning of the FHA and that residents of the facility qualified as individuals with disabilities for purposes of the FHA. Further, DOJ argued that by prohibiting the facility from operating and refusing to grant a reasonable accommodation, the Village discriminated against people with disabilities, in violation of the FHA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 25, 2021, the Village moved to dismiss this action. The Court denied the motion on March 18, 2021. The Village argued that the case was moot because the sober living facility voluntarily moved out of the Village before the lawsuit was filed. The court rejected this argument, however, because DOJ alleged that the sober living facility intended to return to the Village and would likely be subjected to the same kind of discrimination. The Village also argued that the case should be dismissed because it contradicted a joint statement between DOJ and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, in which the agencies described permissible land use restrictions that could be imposed on groups of unrelated individuals. The court also rejected this argument, citing the very same joint statement, which made clear that groups of individuals with disabilities had the right to seek an exception or waiver to generally applicable restrictions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the same opinion, on March 18, 2021, the court also issued a ruling on the Village&rsquo;s motion to dismiss the sober living facility&rsquo;s suit in Trinity Sober Living v. Village of Hinsdale. In that case, the Village argued that the facility failed to allege specific factual allegations to plausibly support its claims. The court rejected this argument, finding that the facility&rsquo;s allegations were sufficient to plausibly infer that the Village was determined to prevent a home for persons with disabilities from moving into the neighborhood. The Village also argued that the facility failed to allege that it asked for a reasonable accommodation and therefore was never refused. The court also rejected this argument, finding that the facility had sufficiently alleged that it requested an accommodation, and that rather than respond by telling the facility to apply for a variance or special use permit, or to attempt to negotiate a reasonable solution, the Village immediately filed suit to enforce the very zoning provision from which the facility sought an accommodation. The court held that it was reasonable for the facility to conclude that any such request was doomed from the start, and as such the court concluded that the facility had stated a claim for failing to make a reasonable accommodation. Therefore, the court denied the motion with regard to the facility&rsquo;s discrimination claims. However, the court granted the motion with regard to the facility&rsquo;s claim that the Village retaliated against it for requesting a reasonable accommodation by filing an eviction lawsuit. The court held that the facility did not sufficiently allege that the eviction lawsuit was a sham, or that the Village&rsquo;s allegations were frivolous or objectively baseless.</p>\r\n<p>The parties moved to consolidate the case brought by the sober living facility and the case brought by DOJ on August 26, 2021, which the court granted the following day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Following more than a year of discovery, the parties jointly moved for the entry of a consent decree that would resolve the entire consolidated action on February 1, 2023. The court entered the consent decree on the same day.</p>\r\n<p>The consent decree set forth the following requirements for the Village of Hinsdale: 1) repeal sections of its Business and Licensing Code regarding group homes for people with disabilities; 2) revise its Zoning Code to permit group homes serving individuals with disabilities as of right; 3) adopt a new written policy for reasonable accommodations; 4) designate a Fair Housing Compliance Officer to ensure the Village&rsquo;s compliance with the decree; 5) undergo fair-housing training; 6) submit periodic compliance reports to the Department of Justice; 7) pay $790,000 in damages, attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs to the sober living facility; and 8) pay a $10,000 civil penalty to the United States. The consent decree also specified that it would remain in effect for four years and that the court would retain jurisdiction to enforce the agreement.</p>",

The United States brings this action against the Village of Hinsdale, Illinois (the \n“Village” or “Hinsdale”) under the Fair Housing Act, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, \nas amended (“FHA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601–3619. \n2.  The Village has attempted to prohibit Trinity Sober Living, LLC (“Trinity”) from \noperating a sober living home with ten residents in recovery from drug or alcohol addiction on \nthe basis of disability.  The Village claimed that the sober home was prohibited from operating, \nregardless of the number of residents it has, because it was a “commercial” land use under the \nVillage’s zoning code.  This determination would have effectively precluded any group home or \nsupported housing for persons with disabilities from operating in single-family residential \ndistricts in the Village.  Furthermore, following opposition from neighbors opposed to the sober \nhome, the Village refused to even consider Trinity’s request for a reasonable accommodation \nunder the FHA, and instead responded by filing a lawsuit to evict the sober home the very next \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/24/20 Page 2 of 15 PageID #:2\nday.  Accordingly, the Village has discriminated on the basis of disability, including by refusing \nto provide a reasonable accommodation, in violation of the FHA, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f).  \n3.  On November 13, 2020, after learning that the United States had authorized the \nfiling of this lawsuit, the City filed a notice in Trinity Sober Living, LLC v. Village of Hinsdale, \nNo. 1:19-cv-07321 (N.D. Ill.), indicating that it was withdrawing its position that a group home \nwith three or fewer individuals is prohibited as a “commercial use” under the Village’s zoning \ncode.  See ECF No. 65, at 2.  However, the Village continues to take the position that group \nhomes with three or more unrelated persons violate the Village’s zoning code, which would \neffectively exclude most group homes for persons with disabilities.  The Village also continues \nto maintain that it did not deny Trinity a reasonable accommodation, despite failing even to \nconsider its request and responding instead with a lawsuit.      \nII. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action and may grant the relief sought herein \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1345; 42 U.S.C. § 3614(a); and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202.     \n5.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because the events or omissions giving \nrise to the claims alleged herein occurred in this district and because defendant is located there.   \nIII. \nDEFENDANT \n6.  Defendant Village of Hinsdale is a unit of local government organized under the \nConstitution and laws of the State of Illinois.  See Ill. Const. art. 7, § 1; 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/1-1-\n1 et seq.  The Village has the capacity to sue and be sued. \n \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/24/20 Page 3 of 15 PageID #:3\nIV. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Trinity Sober Living \n7.   Trinity assists persons who are in recovery from alcoholism or drug addiction to \nachieve and maintain sobriety.  It was founded in 2019 to address the lack of sufficient services \nand supports for persons recovering from alcoholism and drug addiction in Chicago’s western \nsuburbs.  Michael Owens is the founder and CEO of Trinity.  \n8.  Trinity’s office is located at 19 North Grant Street in Hinsdale’s business district. \nAt this location, Trinity provides therapy, 12-step meetings, and other outpatient and after-care \nservices.  Trinity employs a full-time clinical director and receives referrals from a number of \narea hospitals and recovery programs. \n9.  On June 16, 2019, Trinity purchased a five bedroom, 4,000 square foot home \nlocated at 111 North Grant Street in Hinsdale, a short walk from its office.  Trinity intended to \nuse this home as a sober living home for up to ten persons in recovery from alcoholism or drug \naddiction.  The home began operating on July 27, 2019 with one resident and a live-in house \nmanager.   \n10.  Sober living homes are designed to provide stable housing for persons recovering \nfrom alcoholism or drug addiction.  A sober living home is typically a single-family house whose \nlayout is intended to facilitate the development of relationships of several residents, all of whom \nare in recovery from alcoholism or drug addiction.  Through this model, residents can avoid \nfeelings of isolation and loneliness, which have been shown to contribute to relapse, by sharing \nbedrooms and having the ability to congregate and socialize in communal living spaces.  These \ncommunal living arrangements encourage residents to hold each other accountable for their \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/24/20 Page 4 of 15 PageID #:4\nactions in order to prevent relapse.  A critical mass of residents is typically necessary for this \nmodel to succeed therapeutically. \n11.  Consistent with this model, Trinity’s sober living home served between nine and \nten residents in recovery from alcoholism or drug addiction from approximately November 2019 \nuntil the end of October 2020, when Trinity sold the home in Hinsdale and moved the residents \nto another sober home in another town.  Residents shared bedrooms, cooked and ate meals \ntogether, and socialized together in the home’s common rooms.  Residents received services at \nTrinity’s office one block away, although some support meetings occurred in the home.   \n12.  Although, as of November 2020, Trinity will no longer operate a sober living \nhome at 111 North Grant Street in Hinsdale, it wishes to open another, similarly-structured sober \nliving home in Hinsdale, due in part to continued demand for Trinity’s services in Hinsdale and \nbecause Trinity’s office and therapeutic services for residents are located there. \n13.  As a result of being in recovery from alcoholism or drug abuse, Trinity’s residents \nwere substantially limited in one or more major life activities, including maintaining steady \nemployment, familial relationships, and friendships, and being able to live independently without \nsupport and assistance to maintain sobriety.   \n14.  Residents of Trinity’s sober living home were asked to make a one-month \nminimum commitment to Trinity’s recovery program.  Residents typically stayed 90 days, \nthough others stayed longer.   \n15.  Residents of Trinity’s sober living home were required to be sober upon entry, \nhad to abstain from drugs or alcohol while living there, and were required to undergo weekly \ndrug testing.  Residents participated in a three-phase recovery program, with the first phase being \nthe most restrictive.  Once residents graduated to Phases 2 and 3, they could be granted one or \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/24/20 Page 5 of 15 PageID #:5\ntwo overnight or weekend passes per month.  While at the home, residents had to be awake and \ndressed by 9:00 A.M. on weekdays and were required to adhere to a curfew.  A live-in house \nmanager administered the sober home and the rules governing residents. \n16.  Trinity’s sober living home had six off-street parking spaces.  Residents were \ninformed in advance that parking is limited and that they may not park overnight on the street, \nper Village law.  As a result, many residents either did not have a car or stored their vehicles \nelsewhere while at Trinity. \nB.  Relevant Zoning Provisions \n17.  Most of Hinsdale, including 111 North Grant Street, is zoned as single-family \nresidential.  Under Hinsdale’s zoning code, a “family” is “[o]ne or more persons related by \nblood, marriage, legal adoption, or guardianship, or not more than three (3) persons not so \nrelated, together with gratuitous guests and domestic servants, living together as a single \nhousekeeping unit.”  Hinsdale Mun. Code § 12-106, available at: \nhttps://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967. \n18.    The zoning code also allows “home occupations,” meaning in-home businesses \nconducted by the resident, in single-family residential districts.  A “home occupation” may have \none non-resident employee working on site.  Id. §§ 3-104, 9-102.  The zoning code also contains \nno restrictions on rental housing. \n19.  The zoning code does not refer to or explicitly authorize group homes for persons \nwith disabilities.  The zoning code allows “transitional service facilities,” which are “[a]n \nauthorized and licensed dwelling operated by a public or private agency duly authorized and \nlicensed by any state agency having authority to license and approve said facility that houses \nindividuals being cared for by the agency and deemed by the agency to be capable of living and \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/24/20 Page 6 of 15 PageID #:6\nfunctioning in the community and that provides continuous professional guidance.”  Id. § 12-\n106.  Such facilities are only allowed in multifamily districts and only pursuant to a special use \npermit, are limited to six residents, and are subject to a spacing rule prohibiting any such facility \nfrom being located within one-quarter mile of another such facility, including those located \noutside the Village’s boundaries.  Id. § 4-107. \n20.  The zoning code does not contain a process for granting reasonable \naccommodations to zoning and land use laws to afford persons with disabilities an equal \nopportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling pursuant to the Fair Housing Act.  See 42 U.S.C. § \n3604(f)(3)(B).  However, in August 2017, the Village received a request from a family to \nconstruct an accessible patio for their daughter, who uses a wheelchair.  Ordinarily, requests for \nexceptions to land use restrictions under the zoning code are considered by the Village’s Zoning \nBoard of Appeals (“ZBA”) for a variance or special use permit.  The Village recognized that this \nprocess would be inappropriate for reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities \nbecause the ZBA must consider “strict hardship standards,” which are inconsistent with the \nstandards for reasonable accommodations under the FHA.  Therefore, the Village waived this \nrequirement and referred the request to the Board of Trustees, which approved it unanimously \nand without a public hearing.    \n21.  In considering the reasonable accommodation request described above, the \nVillage recognized that “while the [Board of Trustees] has some flexibility in determining what \nexactly is ‘reasonable’ under ‘reasonable accommodation,’ … the spirit and intent of the law \nshould be considered and deference given to the applicant when considering the request.”   \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/24/20 Page 7 of 15 PageID #:7\nC.  The Village’s Actions with Respect to Trinity’s Sober Home \n22.  On July 13, 2019, a resident of Hinsdale e-mailed the Village President, Thomas \nCauley, stating that “men dealing with drug and alcohol addiction” would be living at 111 North \nGrant Street.  The resident informed Mr. Cauley that many of his neighbors were “very worried” \nabout “having people with these issues living as a group in our neighborhood.  Any restrictions \non this within proximity to Monroe Elementary?”   \n23.  Around this time, other neighbors approached Mr. Owens at 111 North Grant \nStreet to express their concern about persons in recovery from alcoholism and drug addiction \nliving there.  One neighbor (not the individual referenced above) accused Mr. Owens of bringing \n“addicts and alcoholics into the neighborhood” and stated that he had raised these concerns with \nMr. Cauley.  Another neighbor accused Mr. Owens of bringing “alcoholics, drug addicts, and \npedophiles into our neighborhood.”  Mr. Owens attempted to assure the neighbors that this was \nnot the case. \n24.  On July 18, 2019, Mr. Cauley wrote to Mr. Owens that “[i]t has come to my \nattention that Trinity Sober Living, LLC, has purchased property within the Village located at \n111 N. Grant Street, and intends to use it as a facility where ten (10) unrelated people will \nreside.”  This, Mr. Cauley wrote, was a “prohibited use” and would not qualify even as a special \nuse.  Mr. Cauley’s letter did not refer to the Village’s reasonable accommodation process. \n25.  Mr. Owens asked to meet with Mr. Cauley, but received no response.  However, \non July 30, 2019, Mr. Owens met with Rob McGuiness, the Village’s Planning Director, Bradley \nBloom, the Assistant Village Manager and Public Safety Director, and Lance Malina, the Village \nAttorney, at the sober home at 111 North Grant Street.  At the time, the home had only one \nresident.   \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/24/20 Page 8 of 15 PageID #:8\n26.  During the meeting, Mr. Owens gave the officials a tour of the home and then \nanswered numerous questions from the three Village officials in attendance on the sober living \nhome and how it would operate.  For example, in response to Mr. Malina’s questions, Mr. \nOwens stated that Trinity would not admit sex offenders and explained why Trinity needed to \nhave ten residents from both a therapeutic and financial perspective.  In response to Mr. Bloom, \nMr. Owens stated that Trinity would comply with the Village’s parking regulations and that \nresidents would not be allowed to stand in front of the house and smoke.  Mr. Owens further \nconfirmed that, other than weekly Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, all therapy and treatment \nwould occur at Trinity’s office and not at the home. \n27.  At the close of the meeting, Mr. Malina suggested that Trinity request a \nreasonable accommodation and referred to the Village’s reasonable accommodation process, as \nwell as the accommodation the Village granted in August 2017 and described in Paragraph 20 \nabove.  Mr. Owens agreed to do so and said that he would have his then-counsel, Steve Polin, a \nWashington, D.C.-based lawyer who specializes in representing sober homes, submit a request.  \n28.  In a follow-up email exchange with Mr. Malina, Mr. Owens inquired whether, in \nthe interim, Trinity would be complying with the zoning code if it limited itself to three \nresidents, the maximum number of unrelated persons allowed to live as a “family” under the \nzoning code, not counting domestic servants.  Mr. Malina responded as follows: \nTo begin, I do not agree that you can have any individual residents at the 111 \nGrant property that are customers of Trinity Sober Living, LLC, under \nHinsdale’s Zoning Code. This follows from the fact that the Trinity Sober \nLiving plan, to the extent you have informally described it to the Village, is a \ncommercial use.  We explained this to you at our meeting.  Commercial uses \nare not allowed in the R-4 district.  Because the residential use at 111 Grant is \nancillary to the addiction treatment that is being marketed commercially to \nthose seeking Trinity Sober Living’s product, it is a commercial use. \n \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/24/20 Page 9 of 15 PageID #:9\nHaving up to only three unrelated people residing at the property -- even \nthough you would like eleven -- does not eliminate the zoning violation \ntriggered by the commercial use of the property. This would simply avoid \nviolating yet an additional provision of the R-4 zoning requirements. \n  \nAs I explained, you must follow the Village Code requirements until you get \nproper authorization to do otherwise.  I need to know whether you will do this \nvoluntarily. I understand you are now requesting until August 7, 2019, to \nrespond.  Please do so no later than 4 p.m. Chicago Time on Wednesday, \nAugust 7th; that is the end of the business day in Washington, D.C. \n \n(Emphasis added.) \n \n29.  On August 4, 2019, the Village convened a meeting of Hinsdale residents in order \nto “share with the residents the actions that the Village has taken and intends to take with respect \nto” the sober home at 111 North Grant Street.  The Village did not invite Trinity to the meeting.  \n30.  At this meeting, the Village did not inform the residents that Trinity was expected \nto submit a request for a reasonable accommodation within the next few days or that the Board \nof Trustees would be considering this request. \n31.  On August 5, 2019, Mr. Cauley sent a letter addressed “Dear Residents” that \nstated that “the Village is prepared to take any and all actions necessary to enforce the Village’s \nzoning code, under which this proposed use is not permitted.”  The letter did not state that the \nVillage was expecting a reasonable accommodation request from Trinity in the next few days or \nthat the Board of Trustees would be considering this request.  The Village did not send this letter \nto Trinity until after Mr. Owens learned about it over a month later and asked the Village for a \ncopy. \n32.  On August 7, 2019, the deadline agreed to by the Village, Mr. Polin sent Mr. \nMalina a seven-page letter by email.  On the first page of the letter, Mr. Polin wrote, “I am \nwriting this letter to request a reasonable accommodation pursuant to the Federal Fair Housing \nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(B) on behalf of TSL [Trinity Sober Living] and its prospective \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/24/20 Page 10 of 15 PageID #:10\nresidents, the owner of the property and its residents.”  The requested accommodation was to \n“waiv[e] the number of unrelated persons that can reside together as a family, and treat the use of \n111 N. Grant Street as a single family use.”  The letter cited extensive legal authority for the \nproposition that group homes and sober living homes like Trinity were entitled to reasonable \naccommodations under the FHA, notwithstanding their “commercial” aspects.  Mr. Polin \nreceived confirmation that evening that Mr. Malina had opened Mr. Polin’s email transmitting \nthe letter. \n33.  In contravention of the Village’s reasonable accommodation process and past \npractice, the Village did not forward Trinity’s reasonable accommodation request to the Board of \nTrustees.  Instead, on August 8, 2019—the very next day—the Village filed a lawsuit against \nTrinity in the Circuit Court for DuPage County, Illinois to enforce its zoning code.   \n34.  The Village’s lawsuit claimed that, even though Trinity’s sober home had fewer \nthan three unrelated residents at the time of filing, it was nevertheless currently in violation of \nthe zoning code because it was a “commercial” use.  The lawsuit did not define what constituted \na “commercial” use under the zoning code, but alleged that the sober home’s residents “will pay \nrent, must work or enroll in school, and will be monitored 24/7 by Trinity.”   \n35.  Based on the apparent criteria used by the Village, most group homes for persons \nwith disabilities would be considered a “commercial” use, regardless of the number of residents, \nand consequently barred from operating in single-family districts.  This is because, for most \ngroup homes, the residents pay rent, the agency operating the group home receives compensation \nfor the care and services being provided at the home, most residents must attend employment or \nday services programs during the day, and residents are monitored by the provider agency. \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/24/20 Page 11 of 15 PageID #:11\n36.  The Village’s lawsuit sought a declaration that the home violated the zoning code \nand fines of $500 for “each and every day” the home was operating.  The Village also later \nmoved for a preliminary injunction “[r]equiring Defendant to cease all commercial use of the \nProperty” and “enjoining Defendant from using the Property for a commercial use, or any other \nnon-permitted use[.]” The Village voluntarily moved to dismiss this lawsuit on June 15, 2020, \nand it is no longer pending. \n37.  At no time during the state court proceedings, which lasted over ten months, did \nthe Village inform the court that it had received or intended to consider a reasonable \naccommodation request from Trinity pursuant to the Fair Housing Act, which, if granted, would \nhave mooted some or all of the Village’s claims.  To the contrary, the Village repeatedly \ndisputed the Fair Housing Act’s relevance or applicability to the Village’s enforcement of its \nzoning code. \n38.  On August 12, 2019, after the Village had filed its lawsuit in state court, Mr. \nMalina responded to Mr. Polin.  Mr. Malina requested that Trinity provide him with the home’s \n“operational plan,” leases, and “any rules in place for residents.”  At least some of the requests \nfor documents concerned topics that had been discussed during the July 30, 2019 meeting \nbetween Trinity and Village officials, including Mr. Malina.  Mr. Malina did not ask for any \ninformation about the residents’ disabilities or their need for the requested accommodation, and \ndid not explain why the information he requested was relevant to Trinity’s reasonable \naccommodation request.  Mr. Malina stated that, once he received this information, he would \n“review your request” and “respond accordingly in more detail.” \n39.  Trinity provided the requested information on October 31, 2019.  The Village, \nhowever, did not respond further, nor did it refer the request to the Board of Trustees, consistent \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/24/20 Page 12 of 15 PageID #:12\nwith the Village’s process for addressing requests for reasonable accommodations in zoning and \nland use. \n40.  On November 13, 2020, the Village stated that, in response to the United States’ \nnotice of the filing of this lawsuit, it was now changing the position it has taken for the past one \nand one-half years, and now claims that it opposes Trinity’s right to operate in a single-family \ndistrict only because it intended to serve more than three unrelated persons, and not because the \nVillage regards Trinity as a “commercial use.”  The Village made clear that it was not \nwithdrawing any of its other positions with respect to Trinity, including its refusal to consider \nTrinity’s reasonable accommodation request.  Even under this new position, the Village’s actions \nwould still preclude all but the smallest group homes from operating.  For example, under \nIllinois law, group homes for persons with mental illness or intellectual disabilities may serve up \nto eight residents.  210 Ill. Comp. Stat. § 135/3(d).  Furthermore, as stated above, sober living \nhomes typically require more than three individuals to succeed therapeutically.      \nV. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount I: Violations of the Fair Housing Act \n41.  The allegations listed above are incorporated herein by reference.  \n42.  Trinity’s sober living home was a “dwelling” within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § \n3602(b).  \n43.  The residents who lived at Trinity’s sober living home, as well as those \nindividuals who applied to live at the home, were persons with disabilities within the meaning of \n42 U.S.C. § 3602(h).1   \n                                                 \n1  Throughout this Complaint, the United States uses the term “disability” instead of \n“handicap.”  For purposes of the FHA, the terms have the same meaning.

Defendant Village of Hinsdale’s actions described above constitute:   \na.  discrimination in the sale or rental, or otherwise making unavailable or \ndenying, a dwelling because of disability, in violation of the FHA, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 3604(f)(1);  \nb.  discrimination in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a \ndwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection with such dwelling \nbecause of disability, in violation of the FHA, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(2); and \nc.  a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, \nor services when such accommodations may be necessary to afford a person an equal \nopportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling, in violation of the FHA, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 3604(f)(3)(B). \n45.  Defendants have acted intentionally, willfully, and in disregard for the rights of \nothers. \n46.  Defendant’s actions as described above constitute a pattern or practice of \nresistance to the full enjoyment of rights granted by the Fair Housing Act, or a denial of rights \nprotected by the Fair Housing Act to a group of persons, which denial raises an issue of general \npublic importance, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3614(a). \n47.

Gettleman \nVILLAGE OF HINSDALE,  ) \n) \nDefendant. \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \n \n  In these related cases, plaintiffs Trinity Sober Living LLC (“TSL”) and the United States \nof America have brought separate complaints against defendant Village of Hinsdale, challenging \nthe Village’s attempts to enforce its zoning regulations to prevent TSL from opening a group \nhome in a residential area within the Village.  TSL has brought a two count complaint alleging \ndiscrimination under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §3601 et seq. (“FHA”) in Count I, and \nunder the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et. seq. (“ADA”) in Count II.  \nThe United States’ complaint asserts one count for violating the FHA.  The Village has moved \nto dismiss each complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. for failure to state a claim.  For the reasons \ndescribed below, both motions are denied. \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 17 Filed: 03/18/21 Page 2 of 10 PageID #:230\nBACKGROUND1 \n  TSL assists persons who are in recovery from alcoholism or drug addiction to achieve \nand maintain sobriety.  It was founded in 2019 by Michael Owens, and is located on Grant \nStreet in the Village’s business district.  On June 16, 2019, TSL purchased a five bedroom, 4000 \nsquare foot house located at 111 Grant Street in the Village, a short walk from its office.  The \nintent was to use the home for a sober living facility for up to ten unrelated persons in recovery \nfrom alcoholism or drug addiction.  The home began operating on July 27, 2019, with one \nresident and a live-in house manager.  According to the government’s complaint, the home \nserved between nine and ten residents in recovery from alcoholism or drug addiction from \napproximately November 2019 until the end of October 2020, when TSL sold the house and \nmoved the residents to another sober living home in another town.  The government alleges that \nTSL wants to open another sober living facility within the Village. \n  The TSL home in Hinsdale is in an area zoned as single-family residential.  Under the \nHinsdale zoning code, “family” is defined as “one or more persons related by blood, marriage, \nlegal adoption or guardianship, or not more than three (3) persons not so related, together with \ngratuitous guests and domestic servants, living together as a single housekeeping unit.”  The \nzoning code allows “traditional service facilities” defined as an “authorized and licensed \ndwelling operated by a public or private agency duly authorized by any state agency . . . that \nhouses individuals being cared for by that agency and deemed by the agency to be capable of \nliving and functioning in the community and that provides professional guidance.”  Such \n                                                 \n1 The background facts are taken largely from the United States’ complaint, which is more detailed than TSL’s \ncomplaint.  To the extent that the difference in factual detail is relevant to the pending motions, it is addressed in \nthis opinion. \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 17 Filed: 03/18/21 Page 3 of 10 PageID #:231\nfacilities are allowed only in multi-family zoned districts, only pursuant to a special use permit, \nand are limited to six residents. \n  On July 13, 2019, a resident of Hinsdale emailed the Village President, Thomas Cauley, \nstating that “men dealing with drug and alcohol addiction” would be living at the 111 Grant \nStreet  house, and that the neighbors were worried about people with those issues living in the \nneighborhood.  Other neighbors had approached Owens at the house to express their concern, \nand at least one neighbor accused Owens of bringing “alcoholics, drug addicts, and pedophiles \ninto our neighborhood.” \n  Cauley wrote to Owens on July 18, 2019, indicating that he had learned that TSL had \npurchased the Grant Street property and intended to use it as a facility where ten unrelated people \nwould reside.  He informed Owens that such was a “prohibited use” and would not qualify as a \nspecial use.  On July 30, Owens met with the Village Planning Director, the Assistant Village \nManager, the Public Safety Director, and Lance Malina, the Village Attorney.  At that time the \nhome had only one resident.  At the close of the meeting, Malina suggested that TSL request a \nreasonable accommodation and referred to the Village’s reasonable accommodation process. \n  In a follow-up exchange email with Malina, Owens inquired whether TSL would be \ncomplying with the zoning code if it limited the house to three residents.  Malina responded that \n“commercial uses” are not permitted in the R-4 (single-family) district and that the Village \nconsidered TSL’s use of the house ancillary to its addiction treatment center located in the \nVillage’s business district being marketed commercially. \n  On August 4, 2019, the Village convened a meeting of its residents to “share with the \nresidents the actions that the Village has taken and intends to take with respect to” the home.  \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 17 Filed: 03/18/21 Page 4 of 10 PageID #:232\nTSL was not invited to the meeting.  The Village did not inform the residents that TSL was \nexpected to request a reasonable accommodation. \n  The following day, Cauley sent a letter addressed “Dear Residents” indicating that the \nVillage was “prepared to take any and all actions necessary to enforce the Village’s zoning code, \nunder which this proposed use is not permitted.”  Two days later, on August 7, Steve Polin, \nTSL’s lawyer, sent Malina a nine page email letter, requesting a reasonable accommodation \npursuant to the FHA on behalf of TSL and its prospective residents, the owner of the property, \nand its current residents.  The requested accommodation was a waiver of the number of \nunrelated persons that can reside together as a family, and to treat the use of the home as a \nsingle-family use.  The Village did not forward that request to the Board of Trustees.  Instead, \non the following day it filed a lawsuit against TSL in the state court seeking to enforce its zoning \ncode.  The lawsuit asserted that even though the home currently had fewer than three unrelated \nresidents, it was in violation of the zoning code because it was a commercial use.  The Village \nsought a declaration that the home violated the zoning code and fines for each day the home was \noperating.  The Village also moved for a preliminary injunction requiring TSL to cease all \ncommercial use of the property.   \n  On August 12, after the Village filed the state court suit, Malina responded to Polin’s \nAugust 7 letter by requesting certain information about TSL’s operations.  TSL supplied the \nrequested information by October 31, 2019, but the Village never responded further, nor did it  \nrefer the accommodation request to the Board of Trustees. \n  On November 6, 2019, TSL filed its instant action (19 c 7321).  On October 29, 2020, \nthe Village received notice that the United States was taking the position that the zoning code \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 17 Filed: 03/18/21 Page 5 of 10 PageID #:233\ndiscriminated against persons with disabilities by prohibiting homes of any size as “commercial”  \nland uses.  As a result of that letter, the Village has indicated that it was withdrawing its position \nthat TSL’s use of the home was a violation of the code as a “commercial use” regardless of the \nnumber of residents.  Its “reconsidered position” is that TSL’s use violated the zoning code \nsolely because it planned to lodge and did lodge more than three unrelated persons. \nDISCUSSION \n  The Village has moved under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) to dismiss both complaints brought \nagainst it.  To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must “state a claim \nto relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell. Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 554, 570 (2007).  \n“A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiﬀ pleads factual content that allows the court to \ndraw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft \nv. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  �at said, when considering a motion to dismiss, the court \naccepts “all well-pleaded factual allegations as true and view[s] them in the light most favorable \nto plaintiﬀ.”  Lavalais v. Vill. of Melrose Park, 734 F.3d 629, 632 (7th Cir. 2013).  At the same \ntime, “allegations in the form of legal conclusions are insuﬃcient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion.”  McReynolds v. Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., 694 F.3d 873, 885 (7th Cir. 2012) (citing \nIqbal, 556 U.S. at 678).  \n  The FHA was passed in 1968 to “provide, within constitutional limits, for fair housing \nthroughout the United States.”  42 U.S.C. § 3601.  It originally protected against discrimination \nbased on race, color, religion, or national origin only, but the Fair Housing Amendment Act of \n1988 extended its protections to persons with disabilities.  Valencia v. City of Springfield, Ill., \n883 F.3d 959, 966 (7th Cir. 2018).  The FHA makes it unlawful to “discriminate in the sale or \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 17 Filed: 03/18/21 Page 6 of 10 PageID #:234\nrental, or to otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a \n[disability].”  Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(1)).  Title II of the ADA similarly provides that \n“no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from \nparticipation in or be denied the benefits or services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or \nbe subject to discrimination by any such entity.”  Id. at 966-67 (quoting 42 U.S.C. §12132). \n  Both statutes apply to municipal zoning decisions.  Id. at 967.  A plaintiff may prove a \nviolation of the FHA or ADA by showing: 1) disparate treatment; 2) disparate impact; or 3) a \nrefusal to make a reasonable accommodation.  Id.  The analysis the same under each statute for \neach theory of liability.  Id.   \n  TSL’s complaint (19 c 7321) alleges discrimination and retaliation under the FHA (Count \nI) and discrimination under the ADA (Count II).  The Village first argues that the complaint \ncontains no specific factual allegations to plausibly support a disparate treatment claim.  In \nresponse TSl agrees that it is “not making a claim for disparate treatment based on a facially \ndiscriminatory government practice at this time.” \n  Next, the Village challenges TSL’s claim of retaliation, which is based on the Village’s \nfiling of the state court action to enforce its zoning code.  The FHA makes it “unlawful to \ncoerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any person in the exercise or enjoyment of . . . any \nright granted or protected by [the FHA].” 42 U.S.C. § 3617.  To state a claim under this section, \nTSL must allege that: 1) it is protected under the FHA; 2) it was engaged in the exercise or \nenjoyment of its fair housing rights; 3) the Village coerced, threaten, intimidated, or interfered \nwith TSL on account of its protected activity under the FHA; and 4) the Village was motivated \nby an intent to discriminate.  Bloch v. Frischolz, 587 F.3d 771, 782 (7th Cir. 2009). \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 17 Filed: 03/18/21 Page 7 of 10 PageID #:235\n  The Village argues that TSL’s complaint contains no factual allegations to support its \ngeneral claim that the Village intended to discriminate.  TSL’s complaint is not nearly as \ndetailed as the government’s complaint.  For example, TSL’s complaint lacks any of the details \nabout the residents’ complaints to the Village or to Owens.  According to the Village, all the \ncomplaint alleges is that it sued TSL to enforce a neutral zoning code provision.  Nonetheless, \nthe complaint does allege that Polin’s August 7 letter advised the Village that TSL’s residents \nwere protected under the FHA and ADA, and any attempt to enforce its zoning code against TSL \nwould be unlawful discrimination.  The Village filed suit the next day.  This allegation is \nsufficient to plausibly infer that the Village was determined to prevent a home for persons with \ndisabilities  (recovering “drug addicts” and alcoholics) from moving into the neighborhood. \n  The Village also argues that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, which protects litigation, \nlobbying, and speech, bars TSL’s retaliation claim.  See New West, L.P. v. City of Joliet, 491 \nF.3d 717, 722 (7th Cir. 2007).  Noerr-Pennington provides absolute immunity for statutory \nliability when petitioning the government for redress.  SoCal Recovery, LLC v. City of Costa \nMesa, 2019 WL 8194727 at * 12 (C.D. Cal. August 30, 2019).  There is, however, an exception \nfor conduct that is a mere sham to cover what is an attempt to interfere with a defendant’s rights.  \nId.  In the instant case, the are no allegations to suggest that the state court lawsuit was a sham, \nor that its allegations were frivolous or objectively baseless.  Id.  Consequently, the court agrees \nthat TSL’s complaint fails to state a claim for retaliation and grants the motion to dismiss that \nclaim. \n  This leads to what the court considers to be the crux of TSL’s complaint—its claim that \nthe Village failed to make a reasonable accommodation to afford TSL and its residents to an \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 17 Filed: 03/18/21 Page 8 of 10 PageID #:236\nequal opportunity to use and enjoy the home.  According to the Village, TSL has not alleged \nthat it actually made a request for an accommodation and, as a result, was never refused.  \nArguing that TSL was required to seek a special use permit or a zoning variance before it \npurchased the house or began operation, the Village relies on Schwarz v. City Treasure Island, \n544 F.3d 1201, 1219 (11th Cir. 2008), which it describes as holding that “if there is a local \nprocedure (such as a variance process) through which the plaintiffs can obtain the \naccommodations they want, they must use that procedure first and come away unsatisfied prior \nto filing suit in federal court.”  That is generally true but, as stated in U.S. v. Village of Palatine, \nIll., 37 F.3d 1230, 1234 (7th Cir. 1994) (emphasis added), “where plaintiff’s sole argument is that \nthe Village failed to make a reasonable accommodation under the Act, the Village must be \nafforded an opportunity to make such an accommodation pursuant to its own lawful \nprocedures—unless it is clear that the result of such procedures is foredoomed, . . .—before \nplaintiff will have a ripe claim.”   \n  In the instant case, TSL has alleged that it requested an accommodation, and that rather \nthan respond by telling TSL to apply for a variance or special use permit (it in fact told TSL that \nsuch a permit was not available), or to attempt to negotiate a reasonable solution, it immediately \nfiled suit to enforce the very zoning provision from which TSL sought an accommodation.  Nor \ndid the Village refer TSL’s request to the Board of Trustees as the government alleges the \nVillage has done in the past when faced with a request for an accommodation.  Under theses \ncircumstance it was reasonable for TSL to conclude that any such request was doomed from the \nstart.  Consequently, as a result, the court concludes that TSL’s complaint states a claim for \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 17 Filed: 03/18/21 Page 9 of 10 PageID #:237\nfailing to make a reasonable accommodation, and the Village’s motion to dismiss on that ground \nis denied. \n  The analysis above applies equally to the Village’s motion to dismiss the government’s \ncomplaint (20 c 6959).   The Village argues that the government’s suit is moot because TSL \nvoluntarily moved out of the Village before the suit was filed, but the government alleges that \nTSL wants to return and is likely to be subject to the same alleged discrimination.  The Village \nalso argues that the government’s position is in direct contrast to a provision is a Joint Statement \nby the United States Department of Housing and Urban development issued in November 2016 \n(State and Local Land Use Laws and Practices and the Application of the Fair Housing Act at 10 \n(Nov. 10, 2016), available at https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/912366/download (“Joint \nStatement”)) that provides that any local government: \nMay generally restrict the ability of groups of unrelated persons to \nlive together without violating the [FHA] as long as the restrictions \nare imposed on all such groups, including a group defined as a \nfamily.  Thus, if the definition of a family includes up to a certain \nnumber of unrelated individuals, an ordinance would not, on its \nface, violate the Act if a group home for persons with disabilities \nwith more than the permitted number for a family were not \nallowed to locate in a single-family-zoned neighborhood because \nany group of unrelated people without disabilities would also be \ndenied. \n \n  That same provision also provides, however, that “because the Act prohibits the denial of \nreasonable accommodations to rules and policies for persons with disabilities, a group home that \nprovides housing for a number of persons with disabilities that exceeds the number allowed \nunder the family definition has the right to seek an exception or waiver.  If the criteria for a \nreasonable accommodation are met, the permit must be given in that instance, but the ordinance \nwould not be invalid.”  Id.  \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 17 Filed: 03/18/21 Page 10 of 10 PageID #:238\n  In the instant case, both complaints allege that TSL sought a reasonable accommodation \nand rather than assess that request, or inform TSL about how to follow the Village’s procedures, \nthe Village filed suit.  The complaints allege adequately the denial of a reasonable \naccommodation.  Whether the requested accommodation was required or reasonable is a fact \nspecific inquiry not appropriate for resolution on motion to dismiss.  See Valencia, 883 F.3d at \n968.  Consequently. The Village’s motion to dismiss the government’s complaint is denied. \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons described above, the Village of Hinsdale’s motions to dismiss in cases \n19-c-7321 [Doc. 53] and 20-c-6959 [Doc. 10] are denied, with the exception of TSL’s claim for \nretaliation.  The Village of Hinsdale is directed to answer the complaints by April 15, 2019.  \nThis matter is set for a telephonic status on April 27, 2019, at 9:45 a.m.  \n \n        ENTER:   \n \n \n \n__________________________________________ \nRobert W.

(“FHA”); and the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. (“ADA”).  Plaintiff, Trinity Sober Living LLC, seeks \ndamages and injunctive relief as redress for: (1) the disparate impact visited upon them due to the \nacts and decisions of the Defendant and its subsidiary or affiliate organizations; (2) the affirmative \ndisability-based discrimination manifested in Defendant’s acts and decisions; and (3) Defendant’s \ndiscriminatory refusal and denial to provide Plaintiff a reasonable accommodation in keeping with \nFederal anti-discrimination laws. \n \n\nCase: 1:19-cv-07321 Document #: 48 Filed: 07/15/20 Page 2 of 16 PageID #:377\n  The  aforementioned  denials  of  Plaintiff’s  applications  now  threaten  residents  of  the \nPlaintiff -- who are disabled pursuant to the FHA and ADA -- with impending eviction based on \ndiscriminatory means.  To prevent such a result, Plaintiff hereby asks this Honorable Court for \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief to halt the Defendant’s discrimination against them on the basis \nof handicap or disability in violation of the FHA and ADA, respectively.  Additionally, Plaintiff \nseeks monetary damages, costs, and reasonable attorneys’ fees. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n1.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. §§1331, \n1343; 42 U.S.C. §3613; and 42 U.S.C. §12133. \n2.  Venue is proper in the United States District Court for the Northern District of \nIllinois, Eastern Division as all acts complained of occurred within this District. \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff is an Illinois limited liability company, with a principal place of business \nin Hinsdale, Illinois.  It provides affordable housing and supports individuals with disabilities \nincluding those who are recovering from substance abuse and/or alcoholism located at 111 N. \nGrant Hinsdale, Illinois (hereinafter referred to herein as the “House”). \n4.  The Defendant is a political subdivision of the State of Illinois.  The Defendant is \nresponsible for the acts of its agents and employees as well as the enactment, enforcement, and \napplication of the Village Code (“Code”) of the Village of Hinsdale. \nSTATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK \n5.  In 1988, Congress amended the FHA to extend the guarantee of fair housing to \nhandicapped individuals.  Congress also authorized the Secretary of the United States Department \nof Housing and Urban Development to promulgate regulations to implement the FHA. \n2 \n\nCase: 1:19-cv-07321 Document #: 48 Filed: 07/15/20 Page 3 of 16 PageID #:378\n6.  Under the FHA, a person is subject to a “handicap” if she or he has a “physical or \nmental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person’s major life activities, a \nrecord of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment.”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 3602(h).  The term “physical or mental impairment” includes “alcoholism” and “drug addiction \n(other than addiction caused by current, illegal use of a controlled substance).”  24 C.F.R. \n§ 100.201.  The ADA uses similar terminology to define a “disability.”  See, e.g., Tsombandis v. \nWest Haven Fire Dept., 352 F.3d 565 (2d. Cir. 2003). \n7.  Under  the  FHA,  it  is  unlawful  to  discriminate  against  or  otherwise  make \nunavailable or deny a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a handicap of that buyer, renter, \nor person residing in, or intending to reside in, that dwelling after it is sold, rented, or made \navailable.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(1). \n8.  The FHA further provides that it is unlawful to discriminate against any person in \nthe terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services \nor facilities in connection with such dwelling, based in a handicap of such person residing in or \nintending to reside in that dwelling after it is sold, rented, or otherwise made available.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 3604(f)(2). \n9.  The  federal  regulations  implementing  the  FHA  specifically  define  as \ndiscriminatory activity and prohibit the provision of municipal services in a different manner as \nbased on a handicap.  24 C.F.R. § 100.70(d)(4). \n10.  The federal regulations implementing the FHA further make it unlawful “to restrict \nor attempt to restrict the choices of a person by word or conduct in connection with seeking, \nnegotiating for, buying or renting a dwelling so as to . . . discourage or obstruct choices in a \ncommunity, neighborhood or development” because of a handicap.  24 C.F.R. § 100.70(a). \n3 \n\nCase: 1:19-cv-07321 Document #: 48 Filed: 07/15/20 Page 4 of 16 PageID #:379\n11.  The FHA also contains an Ant-Retaliation provision that makes it unlawful “to \ncoerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any person in the exercise or enjoyment of, or on \naccount of his having exercised or enjoyed, … any right granted or protected by [the FHA]. 42 \nU.S.C. § 3617. \n12.  The ADA requires that no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, program, \nor activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any municipal entity.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 12132.  \n13.  The federal  regulations implementing the  ADA  prohibit a public entity  from \nadministering a licensing program or establishing certain requirements for activities of a licensee \nin a manner that subjects qualified disabled individuals to discrimination on the basis of their \ndisability.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(6). \n14.  The federal regulations implementing the ADA also make it unlawful for a public \nentity, in determining the site or location of a facility, to make selections that have the purpose or \neffect of excluding individuals with disabilities, denying them the benefits of certain locations, or \notherwise subjecting them to discrimination.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(4)(I). \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nA.  Trinity Mission  \n15.  Plaintiff Trinity Sober Living, LLC (“TSL”) provides support to individuals who \nare recovering from substance abuse and alcoholism.  \n16.  TSL’s mission is to provide “[h]ope to young men that suffer from substance use \ndisorder…through Structure, Accountability, and Support” after their rehabilitation program ends.  \n4 \n\nCase: 1:19-cv-07321 Document #: 48 Filed: 07/15/20 Page 5 of 16 PageID #:380\n17.  For many individuals, the leap from a structured primary treatment environment to \nthe autonomy associated with returning to their former lives in the community can be too great \nwithout support.  \n18.  Once treatment ends, after-care is an essential component for increased success in \nlong-term recovery.  \n19.  According to a 2018 study commissioned by the State of Illinois, there is an \ninsufficient capacity of recovery homes to meet the need of Illinois citizens with Substance Use \nDisorder (“SUD”).  \n20.  Monitoring data estimates that nearly 45,000 people in Illinois (ages 12 and over) \nare engaged in SUD treatment on a given day, while estimates of recovery homes and halfway \nhouse beds in Illinois are 1,493 beds, or approximately 3% of those in treatment.  \n21.  In response to this shortage, TSL launched a program for sober living homes for \nrecovering alcoholics and addicts who need support transitioning from a rehabilitation program \nback into society.  \n22.  TSL’s sober living program provides daily structure, personal accountability, and \ncommunity support needed to maintain sobriety.  \nB.  Trinity House \n23.  In June 2019, TSL purchased a private residence at 111 N. Grant Street (“Trinity \nHouse”) in the Village of Hinsdale, Illinois (“Defendant” or “the Village”) for use as a sober living \nresidence.  \n24.  TSL  designed  Trinity  House  for  individuals  who  recently  completed  a \nrehabilitation treatment program.  \n5 \n\nCase: 1:19-cv-07321 Document #: 48 Filed: 07/15/20 Page 6 of 16 PageID #:381\n25.  For these individuals, Trinity House is the last step between treatment and going \nhome.  \n26.  Trinity House is staffed with a 24/7 House Manager, who has nearly a decade’s \nexperience with sobriety, a Certified Alcohol & Drug Counselor (CADC), and Peer Recovery \nCoaches.  \n27.  Trinity House is approximately 4,000 square foot and has six bedrooms.  \n28.  Trinity House is intended to house 10 residents.  \n29.  Both the inside and outside of the house are immaculate.  \n30.  The residents clean the house every day and there is a landscaping service that \nmaintains the home’s lawn.  \n31.  From the outside of the home, you would never know it is a sober living home.  \n32.  This is intentional so Trinity’s residents can learn to function, as sober individuals, \nin an actual home before they return to a household with their families.  \nC.  Trinity Residents \n33.  All past and present Trinity House residents are individuals with the disability of \nSubstance Use Disorder (“SUD”).  \n34.  SUD is a disease that affects a person's brain and behavior and leads to an inability \nto control the use of a drug or alcohol.  \n35.  Because of their disability all past and present residents of Trinity House have \ndifficulty caring for themselves and sustaining healthy relationships with friends and family.  \n36.  SUD impacts Trinity House residents’ decision-making processes, as well as their \nability to concentrate and stay on task.  \n6 \n\nCase: 1:19-cv-07321 Document #: 48 Filed: 07/15/20 Page 7 of 16 PageID #:382\n37.  Even though the Trinity House residents completed a rehabilitation treatment \nprogram prior to coming to live at Trinity House, their underlying addictions substantially limit \ntheir ability to live independently in the community without suffering a relapse.  \n38.  While  treatment  eventually  helps  to  ameliorate  the  symptoms  of  SUD,  the \nunderlying disease never goes away.  \n39.  The  relapse  rate  for  individuals  with  SUD  is  significant  without  structure, \naccountability, and support. The relapse rate after a 30-day rehabilitation program is estimated to \nbe as high as 90% within six months following the program’s end.  \nD.  Trinity House Program \n40.  In order to combat the relapse rate, Trinity House’s program relies heavily on \naccountability and support as well as both scheduled and random drug testing.  \n41.  Residents must be sober before entering Trinity House. Residents come to Trinity \nHouse after completing a treatment program. They are drug tested and breathalyzed prior to \ncoming into the home.  \n42.  The residents live at Trinity House by choice. The residents choose to live at Trinity \nHouse because they do not want to relapse into drug or alcohol use again.  \n43.  Trinity House residents live together as a family and make group decisions based \non democratic procedures.  \n44.  Trinity House residents are vital to each other’s sobriety. They eat together, go out \ntogether, attend meetings together, and learn living tools together to help them transition out of the \nsober home and back into their communities.  \n45.  The  program  is  broken  into  three  phases  with  increasing  responsibility  and \nprivileges awarded to the resident in each phase.  \n7 \n\nCase: 1:19-cv-07321 Document #: 48 Filed: 07/15/20 Page 8 of 16 PageID #:383\n46.  Trinity House’s “phase method” allows TSL to test the resident’s independence and \nprogress in a safe environment while maintaining the structure, accountability and oversight \nnecessary to prevent relapse.  \n47.  Each resident’s schedule is highly structured and contains stringent education, \ntherapy, employment, and daily chore requirements.  \n48.  Privileges are rewarded, not only by seniority, but by how much the resident is \ncontributing to the success of everyone else.  \n49.  The success of each resident is highly dependent on community, structure, and \nsupport.  \n50.  It is often critical that Trinity House residents who are in the early and middle stages \nof recovery share a bedroom with another recovering addict for mutual support and monitoring.  \n51.  The length of each resident’s stay at Trinity House is determined by the resident’s \ncontinued need for supported living. Most residents stay approximately 90 days, but some residents \nstay up to 365 days depending on their level of need.  \n52.  Trinity House enables the residents to engage in recovery from alcoholism and \nsubstance abuse at their own pace, which ameliorates the effects of the disease.  \n53.  Trinity House is not an apartment or just a bed for an addict or alcoholic. It is a vital \nstep between treatment and going back home to start living normally again. Simply put, Trinity \nHouse is a way back to life and self-sufficiency.  \n54.  The mutual emotional support and bonding exchanged between the residents is the \nequivalent of the type of love and support received in a traditional family.  \n55.  By living with nine other persons who are in recovery, the residents never have to \nface an alcoholic's or addict's deadliest enemy: loneliness and isolation.  \n8 \n\nCase: 1:19-cv-07321 Document #: 48 Filed: 07/15/20 Page 9 of 16 PageID #:384\n56.  Living in a structured, safe, and therapeutic environment is necessary to a Trinity \nHouse resident’s recovery process.  \nE.  Critical Mass \n57.  Ten residents are needed to reach a critical mass necessary for the residents to \nachieve the therapeutic benefits of Trinity House’s phasing program.  \n58.  Further, ten residents are required to prevent isolation or loneliness. Trinity House \nis 4,000 square feet. Filling the home to its critical mass of ten residents mitigates the concern that \nany particular resident will find himself at home alone and at risk of relapse.  \n59.  It costs TSL approximately $17,000.00 a month to run Trinity House. This sum \nincludes the mortgage payment, taxes, insurance, internet and cable, utilities as well as the salary \nand benefits of Trinity House’s Resident Manager and Certified Alcohol and Drug Counselor. This \nsum also includes some savings set aside each month for improvement projects and unexpected \nhome expenses.  \n60.  Each resident generates an average of $1,850.00 a month.  \n61.  Trinity House requires the occupancy of ten residents in order to achieve financial \nviability.  \nF.  Hinsdale’s Zoning Enforcement  \n62.  The Village’s Zoning Code governs zoning and land use policy in the Village of \nHinsdale. \n63.  The current version of the Code defines “family” as follows: \n“FAMILY \nOne or more persons related by blood, marriage, legal adoption, or guardianship, \nor not more than three (3) persons not so related, together with gratuitous guests \nand domestic servants, living together as a single housekeeping unit.” \n \n9 \n\nCase: 1:19-cv-07321 Document #: 48 Filed: 07/15/20 Page 10 of 16 PageID #:385\n64.  Soon after TSL purchased the House, the Village of Hinsdale became aware that \nTSL intended on operating a sober living house. \n65.  On July 18, 2019, Thomas K. Cauley, Jr. the President for the Village, wrote a letter \nto Michael Owens, the manager or TSL, telling Mr. Owens the Village received information that \nTSL intended on running \"a facility where ten unrelated people will reside.” Cauley further \nclaimed Trinity House is not a permitted use in the Village’s R-4 Single Family Zoning District in \nwhich the home is located.  \n66.  In various communications with the Village between August 1, 2019 and August \n2, 2019, the Village clarified it did not simply take issue with the number of unrelated residents at \nthe Trinity House. Rather, the Village would not allow Trinity House to operate, regardless of the \nnumber of unrelated residents, because the Village considered the home “a commercial use.”  \n67.  The Village gave TSL until August 7, 2019 to respond to its allegations.  \n68.   On August 7, 2019, TSL’s attorney advised the Village by letter that Trinity House \nresidents are a protected class of persons pursuant to the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”) and Americans \nwith Disabilities Act (“ADA”) by virtue of being in recovery from alcoholism and drug addiction. \nHe further advised that the Village's anticipated enforcement of its zoning code against TSL \noperating a '\"sober house\" constituted illegal discrimination under the FHA and ADA. TSL’s asked \nthe Village to grant a reasonable accommodation pursuant to the FHA and to treat TSL’s use of \nthe home as a single-family use.  \n69.  The August 7, 2019 letter was nine pages long and contained extensive legal \nanalysis and case citations in support of TSL’s argument that Trinity House and its residents are \nprotected under the FHA and ADA.  \n10 \n\nCase: 1:19-cv-07321 Document #: 48 Filed: 07/15/20 Page 11 of 16 PageID #:386\n70.  Instead of considering TSL’s request for a reasonable accommodation, the Village \nretaliated against TSL by filing its Verified Complaint for Injunctive Relief and Ordinance \nViolations against TSL in the Illinois Circuit Court in DuPage County (Case No. 2019 CH 916) \nthe very next day.  \n71.  Despite being on notice of the Village’s FHA and ADA violations since August \n2019, the Village’s complaint makes no mention of the FHA, the ADA, or TSL’s request for a \nreasonable accommodation.  \n72.  On October 18, 2019, the Village filed its Motion for Preliminary Injunction with \nthis Court.  \n73.  The Village’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction again omits any reference to the \nFHA, the ADA, or TSL’s repeated requests for a reasonable accommodation.  \n74.  On October 31, 2019, TSL sent the Village additional information in support of its \nprevious request for a reasonable accommodation. The Village ignored TSL’s correspondence.  \n75.  From August 2019 to June 2020, the Village pursued its frivolous lawsuit in state \ncourt and attempted to evict the Trinity House residents from their home or, at the very least, limit \nthe number of residents who could live in the home. \n76.  After nearly a year and after TSL expended significant time and resource defending \nthe frivolous suit, the Village dismissed its state lawsuit on June 2020 when it was unsuccessful in \nobtaining a preliminary injunction against Trinity House to limit the number of residents who \ncould live in the home during the pendency of the state case.  \n77.  The effect of Defendant’s actions has been to prevent TSL and residents from \nresiding at the dwelling of their choice or in any other home zoned for single family use in the \nVillage. \n11 \n\nCase: 1:19-cv-07321 Document #: 48 Filed: 07/15/20 Page 12 of 16 PageID #:387\n78.  Plaintiffs are aggrieved persons under 42 U.S.C. §§ 3602(d) and (I), who have been \ninjured by Defendant’s discriminatory conduct and have suffered damages, economic loss and a \nloss of civil rights as a result of Defendant’s conduct.  \n79.  The House is a dwelling within the meaning of § 802(b) of the FHA, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 3602(b). \n80.  The effect of Defendant’s actions is to deny needed housing opportunities to \nrecovering alcoholics and substance abusers who are disabled under the FHA within the Village \nof Hinsdale. \n81.  The Village Code of the Village of Hinsdale does not have a procedure for \nprocessing requests for a reasonable accommodation in the zoning context pursuant to the FHA. \n82.  The effect of the conduct of the Defendant is to limit the housing opportunities of \nunrelated disabled persons by denying them the right to live together as a group in any residential \nzoning district within the Village of Hinsdale. \n83.  Defendant is treating the residents of the House in a discriminatory fashion and is \nimposing far more stringent requirements on this group of unrelated disabled individuals than on \nothers. \n84.  By classifying the premises described above as a prohibited use in residential zones \nin the Village, Defendant is arbitrarily and illegally making single family housing unavailable to \ndisabled persons recovering from drugs and alcohol addiction. \n85.  Defendant has acted under color of the law of the State of Illinois enforcing the \nCode with the purpose and effect of discriminating against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s residents solely \nbecause of their handicap and disability. \n12 \n\nCase: 1:19-cv-07321 Document #: 48 Filed: 07/15/20 Page 13 of 16 PageID #:388\n86.  Plaintiff’s residents are living in fear of losing their home and are suffering anxiety, \nemotional distress, pain, setbacks in their efforts at recovery, and other irreparable harm as a result \nof Defendant’s actions.  They have no adequate remedy at law. \n87.  Defendant has denied Plaintiff’s rights to due process of law by its arbitrary \nclassification of the House. \n88.  Defendant has failed to further the objective of providing fair housing under the \nFHA in arbitrarily administering its Code. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Discrimination and Retaliation Under the FHA) \n89.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein by reference paragraphs 1 through 40 \nabove. \n90.  Defendant is violating Plaintiff’s rights under the FHA and its implementing \nregulations by: \na.  denying and otherwise making housing unavailable to Plaintiff’s residents \nbecause of their disability; \nb.   using the Zoning Code of the Village of Hinsdale as a pretext to exclude \nPlaintiff’s residents because of their disability; \nc.   enforcing discriminatory zoning rules and policies on Plaintiff and its \nresidents because of their disability; \nd.   interfering with the right of Plaintiff’s residents to live in the dwelling of \ntheir choice;  \ne.   failing to make reasonable accommodations in the Code and its application \nto afford Plaintiff and its residents an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the House; and \n13 \n\nCase: 1:19-cv-07321 Document #: 48 Filed: 07/15/20 Page 14 of 16 PageID #:389\nf.   retaliating against Plaintiff because of their exercise of their legal rights \nunder the FHA. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Discrimination Under the ADA) \n91.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein by reference paragraphs 1 through 42 \nabove. \n92.  Plaintiff TSL is involved in the process of providing housing to people with \ndisabilities as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2).  \n93.  Plaintiff’s residents are individuals with a disability, as defined in 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12102(2), living at the House.   \n94.  Defendant is a public entity, within the definition of 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1). \n95.  The actions of Defendant to exclude the residents of the House from single family \nresidential zones violate Plaintiff and its residents’ rights under the ADA and the regulations \npromulgated thereunder by: \na.  denying the individual disabled residents the opportunity to participate in or \nbenefit from the supportive housing program TSL offers; \nb.  using and administering land use ordinances with the purpose and effect of \nsubjecting Plaintiff and its residents to discrimination based on their disability; \nc.  subjecting Plaintiff and its residents to discrimination on the basis of their \ndisability; \nd.  denying disabled residents the opportunity to participate in a program in the \nmost integrated setting appropriate to their needs in a manner discriminatory against \nPlaintiff and different from the opportunities presented to non-disabled individuals; \n14 \n\nCase: 1:19-cv-07321 Document #: 48 Filed: 07/15/20 Page 15 of 16 PageID #:390\ne.  utilizing licensing and permit requirements to enforce the Code and deny \nPlaintiff’s residents’ enjoyment of rights, privileges, advantages, and opportunities enjoyed \nby non-disabled individuals in a manner that is discriminatory against Plaintiff;  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that the Court: \n1.  Enter a declaratory judgment that Defendant has illegally discriminated against \nPlaintiff in violation of the FHA and ADA by arbitrarily and capriciously applying its Code to the \noccupancy of the House by groups of disabled recovering alcoholics and addicts, thereby causing \na disparate impact upon Plaintiff use and enjoyment of a dwelling; \n2.  Provide injunctive relief restraining Defendant from discriminating against Plaintiff \nand interfering with Plaintiff’s current operation of the House as a home for disabled recovering \nalcoholics and substance abusers, and/or from interfering in Plaintiff’s residents’ rights to reside \nin the House; \n3.  Enter a declaratory judgment stating that Plaintiff’s use of the House as a “sober \nhouse” is consistent with classification of the premises as a single family dwelling, and requiring \nDefendant to apply all zoning, safety, building, and land use codes to Plaintiff’s use of the House \nin the same manner as it does to all other single family dwellings; \n4.  Award compensatory damages; \n5.  Grant an award of reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees; and, \n6.

The United States brings this action against the Village of Hinsdale, Illinois (the \n“Village” or “Hinsdale”) under the Fair Housing Act, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, \nas amended (“FHA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601–3619. \n2.  The Village has attempted to prohibit Trinity Sober Living, LLC (“Trinity”) from \noperating a sober living home with ten residents in recovery from drug or alcohol addiction on \nthe basis of disability.  The Village claimed that the sober home was prohibited from operating, \nregardless of the number of residents it has, because it was a “commercial” land use under the \nVillage’s zoning code.  This determination would have effectively precluded any group home or \nsupported housing for persons with disabilities from operating in single-family residential \ndistricts in the Village.  Furthermore, following opposition from neighbors opposed to the sober \nhome, the Village refused to even consider Trinity’s request for a reasonable accommodation \nunder the FHA, and instead responded by filing a lawsuit to evict the sober home the very next \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/24/20 Page 2 of 15 PageID #:2\nday.  Accordingly, the Village has discriminated on the basis of disability, including by refusing \nto provide a reasonable accommodation, in violation of the FHA, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f).  \n3.  On November 13, 2020, after learning that the United States had authorized the \nfiling of this lawsuit, the City filed a notice in Trinity Sober Living, LLC v. Village of Hinsdale, \nNo. 1:19-cv-07321 (N.D. Ill.), indicating that it was withdrawing its position that a group home \nwith three or fewer individuals is prohibited as a “commercial use” under the Village’s zoning \ncode.  See ECF No. 65, at 2.  However, the Village continues to take the position that group \nhomes with three or more unrelated persons violate the Village’s zoning code, which would \neffectively exclude most group homes for persons with disabilities.  The Village also continues \nto maintain that it did not deny Trinity a reasonable accommodation, despite failing even to \nconsider its request and responding instead with a lawsuit.      \nII. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action and may grant the relief sought herein \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1345; 42 U.S.C. § 3614(a); and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202.     \n5.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because the events or omissions giving \nrise to the claims alleged herein occurred in this district and because defendant is located there.   \nIII. \nDEFENDANT \n6.  Defendant Village of Hinsdale is a unit of local government organized under the \nConstitution and laws of the State of Illinois.  See Ill. Const. art. 7, § 1; 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/1-1-\n1 et seq.  The Village has the capacity to sue and be sued. \n \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/24/20 Page 3 of 15 PageID #:3\nIV. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Trinity Sober Living \n7.   Trinity assists persons who are in recovery from alcoholism or drug addiction to \nachieve and maintain sobriety.  It was founded in 2019 to address the lack of sufficient services \nand supports for persons recovering from alcoholism and drug addiction in Chicago’s western \nsuburbs.  Michael Owens is the founder and CEO of Trinity.  \n8.  Trinity’s office is located at 19 North Grant Street in Hinsdale’s business district. \nAt this location, Trinity provides therapy, 12-step meetings, and other outpatient and after-care \nservices.  Trinity employs a full-time clinical director and receives referrals from a number of \narea hospitals and recovery programs. \n9.  On June 16, 2019, Trinity purchased a five bedroom, 4,000 square foot home \nlocated at 111 North Grant Street in Hinsdale, a short walk from its office.  Trinity intended to \nuse this home as a sober living home for up to ten persons in recovery from alcoholism or drug \naddiction.  The home began operating on July 27, 2019 with one resident and a live-in house \nmanager.   \n10.  Sober living homes are designed to provide stable housing for persons recovering \nfrom alcoholism or drug addiction.  A sober living home is typically a single-family house whose \nlayout is intended to facilitate the development of relationships of several residents, all of whom \nare in recovery from alcoholism or drug addiction.  Through this model, residents can avoid \nfeelings of isolation and loneliness, which have been shown to contribute to relapse, by sharing \nbedrooms and having the ability to congregate and socialize in communal living spaces.  These \ncommunal living arrangements encourage residents to hold each other accountable for their \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/24/20 Page 4 of 15 PageID #:4\nactions in order to prevent relapse.  A critical mass of residents is typically necessary for this \nmodel to succeed therapeutically. \n11.  Consistent with this model, Trinity’s sober living home served between nine and \nten residents in recovery from alcoholism or drug addiction from approximately November 2019 \nuntil the end of October 2020, when Trinity sold the home in Hinsdale and moved the residents \nto another sober home in another town.  Residents shared bedrooms, cooked and ate meals \ntogether, and socialized together in the home’s common rooms.  Residents received services at \nTrinity’s office one block away, although some support meetings occurred in the home.   \n12.  Although, as of November 2020, Trinity will no longer operate a sober living \nhome at 111 North Grant Street in Hinsdale, it wishes to open another, similarly-structured sober \nliving home in Hinsdale, due in part to continued demand for Trinity’s services in Hinsdale and \nbecause Trinity’s office and therapeutic services for residents are located there. \n13.  As a result of being in recovery from alcoholism or drug abuse, Trinity’s residents \nwere substantially limited in one or more major life activities, including maintaining steady \nemployment, familial relationships, and friendships, and being able to live independently without \nsupport and assistance to maintain sobriety.   \n14.  Residents of Trinity’s sober living home were asked to make a one-month \nminimum commitment to Trinity’s recovery program.  Residents typically stayed 90 days, \nthough others stayed longer.   \n15.  Residents of Trinity’s sober living home were required to be sober upon entry, \nhad to abstain from drugs or alcohol while living there, and were required to undergo weekly \ndrug testing.  Residents participated in a three-phase recovery program, with the first phase being \nthe most restrictive.  Once residents graduated to Phases 2 and 3, they could be granted one or \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/24/20 Page 5 of 15 PageID #:5\ntwo overnight or weekend passes per month.  While at the home, residents had to be awake and \ndressed by 9:00 A.M. on weekdays and were required to adhere to a curfew.  A live-in house \nmanager administered the sober home and the rules governing residents. \n16.  Trinity’s sober living home had six off-street parking spaces.  Residents were \ninformed in advance that parking is limited and that they may not park overnight on the street, \nper Village law.  As a result, many residents either did not have a car or stored their vehicles \nelsewhere while at Trinity. \nB.  Relevant Zoning Provisions \n17.  Most of Hinsdale, including 111 North Grant Street, is zoned as single-family \nresidential.  Under Hinsdale’s zoning code, a “family” is “[o]ne or more persons related by \nblood, marriage, legal adoption, or guardianship, or not more than three (3) persons not so \nrelated, together with gratuitous guests and domestic servants, living together as a single \nhousekeeping unit.”  Hinsdale Mun. Code § 12-106, available at: \nhttps://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967. \n18.    The zoning code also allows “home occupations,” meaning in-home businesses \nconducted by the resident, in single-family residential districts.  A “home occupation” may have \none non-resident employee working on site.  Id. §§ 3-104, 9-102.  The zoning code also contains \nno restrictions on rental housing. \n19.  The zoning code does not refer to or explicitly authorize group homes for persons \nwith disabilities.  The zoning code allows “transitional service facilities,” which are “[a]n \nauthorized and licensed dwelling operated by a public or private agency duly authorized and \nlicensed by any state agency having authority to license and approve said facility that houses \nindividuals being cared for by the agency and deemed by the agency to be capable of living and \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/24/20 Page 6 of 15 PageID #:6\nfunctioning in the community and that provides continuous professional guidance.”  Id. § 12-\n106.  Such facilities are only allowed in multifamily districts and only pursuant to a special use \npermit, are limited to six residents, and are subject to a spacing rule prohibiting any such facility \nfrom being located within one-quarter mile of another such facility, including those located \noutside the Village’s boundaries.  Id. § 4-107. \n20.  The zoning code does not contain a process for granting reasonable \naccommodations to zoning and land use laws to afford persons with disabilities an equal \nopportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling pursuant to the Fair Housing Act.  See 42 U.S.C. § \n3604(f)(3)(B).  However, in August 2017, the Village received a request from a family to \nconstruct an accessible patio for their daughter, who uses a wheelchair.  Ordinarily, requests for \nexceptions to land use restrictions under the zoning code are considered by the Village’s Zoning \nBoard of Appeals (“ZBA”) for a variance or special use permit.  The Village recognized that this \nprocess would be inappropriate for reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities \nbecause the ZBA must consider “strict hardship standards,” which are inconsistent with the \nstandards for reasonable accommodations under the FHA.  Therefore, the Village waived this \nrequirement and referred the request to the Board of Trustees, which approved it unanimously \nand without a public hearing.    \n21.  In considering the reasonable accommodation request described above, the \nVillage recognized that “while the [Board of Trustees] has some flexibility in determining what \nexactly is ‘reasonable’ under ‘reasonable accommodation,’ … the spirit and intent of the law \nshould be considered and deference given to the applicant when considering the request.”   \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/24/20 Page 7 of 15 PageID #:7\nC.  The Village’s Actions with Respect to Trinity’s Sober Home \n22.  On July 13, 2019, a resident of Hinsdale e-mailed the Village President, Thomas \nCauley, stating that “men dealing with drug and alcohol addiction” would be living at 111 North \nGrant Street.  The resident informed Mr. Cauley that many of his neighbors were “very worried” \nabout “having people with these issues living as a group in our neighborhood.  Any restrictions \non this within proximity to Monroe Elementary?”   \n23.  Around this time, other neighbors approached Mr. Owens at 111 North Grant \nStreet to express their concern about persons in recovery from alcoholism and drug addiction \nliving there.  One neighbor (not the individual referenced above) accused Mr. Owens of bringing \n“addicts and alcoholics into the neighborhood” and stated that he had raised these concerns with \nMr. Cauley.  Another neighbor accused Mr. Owens of bringing “alcoholics, drug addicts, and \npedophiles into our neighborhood.”  Mr. Owens attempted to assure the neighbors that this was \nnot the case. \n24.  On July 18, 2019, Mr. Cauley wrote to Mr. Owens that “[i]t has come to my \nattention that Trinity Sober Living, LLC, has purchased property within the Village located at \n111 N. Grant Street, and intends to use it as a facility where ten (10) unrelated people will \nreside.”  This, Mr. Cauley wrote, was a “prohibited use” and would not qualify even as a special \nuse.  Mr. Cauley’s letter did not refer to the Village’s reasonable accommodation process. \n25.  Mr. Owens asked to meet with Mr. Cauley, but received no response.  However, \non July 30, 2019, Mr. Owens met with Rob McGuiness, the Village’s Planning Director, Bradley \nBloom, the Assistant Village Manager and Public Safety Director, and Lance Malina, the Village \nAttorney, at the sober home at 111 North Grant Street.  At the time, the home had only one \nresident.   \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/24/20 Page 8 of 15 PageID #:8\n26.  During the meeting, Mr. Owens gave the officials a tour of the home and then \nanswered numerous questions from the three Village officials in attendance on the sober living \nhome and how it would operate.  For example, in response to Mr. Malina’s questions, Mr. \nOwens stated that Trinity would not admit sex offenders and explained why Trinity needed to \nhave ten residents from both a therapeutic and financial perspective.  In response to Mr. Bloom, \nMr. Owens stated that Trinity would comply with the Village’s parking regulations and that \nresidents would not be allowed to stand in front of the house and smoke.  Mr. Owens further \nconfirmed that, other than weekly Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, all therapy and treatment \nwould occur at Trinity’s office and not at the home. \n27.  At the close of the meeting, Mr. Malina suggested that Trinity request a \nreasonable accommodation and referred to the Village’s reasonable accommodation process, as \nwell as the accommodation the Village granted in August 2017 and described in Paragraph 20 \nabove.  Mr. Owens agreed to do so and said that he would have his then-counsel, Steve Polin, a \nWashington, D.C.-based lawyer who specializes in representing sober homes, submit a request.  \n28.  In a follow-up email exchange with Mr. Malina, Mr. Owens inquired whether, in \nthe interim, Trinity would be complying with the zoning code if it limited itself to three \nresidents, the maximum number of unrelated persons allowed to live as a “family” under the \nzoning code, not counting domestic servants.  Mr. Malina responded as follows: \nTo begin, I do not agree that you can have any individual residents at the 111 \nGrant property that are customers of Trinity Sober Living, LLC, under \nHinsdale’s Zoning Code. This follows from the fact that the Trinity Sober \nLiving plan, to the extent you have informally described it to the Village, is a \ncommercial use.  We explained this to you at our meeting.  Commercial uses \nare not allowed in the R-4 district.  Because the residential use at 111 Grant is \nancillary to the addiction treatment that is being marketed commercially to \nthose seeking Trinity Sober Living’s product, it is a commercial use. \n \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/24/20 Page 9 of 15 PageID #:9\nHaving up to only three unrelated people residing at the property -- even \nthough you would like eleven -- does not eliminate the zoning violation \ntriggered by the commercial use of the property. This would simply avoid \nviolating yet an additional provision of the R-4 zoning requirements. \n  \nAs I explained, you must follow the Village Code requirements until you get \nproper authorization to do otherwise.  I need to know whether you will do this \nvoluntarily. I understand you are now requesting until August 7, 2019, to \nrespond.  Please do so no later than 4 p.m. Chicago Time on Wednesday, \nAugust 7th; that is the end of the business day in Washington, D.C. \n \n(Emphasis added.) \n \n29.  On August 4, 2019, the Village convened a meeting of Hinsdale residents in order \nto “share with the residents the actions that the Village has taken and intends to take with respect \nto” the sober home at 111 North Grant Street.  The Village did not invite Trinity to the meeting.  \n30.  At this meeting, the Village did not inform the residents that Trinity was expected \nto submit a request for a reasonable accommodation within the next few days or that the Board \nof Trustees would be considering this request. \n31.  On August 5, 2019, Mr. Cauley sent a letter addressed “Dear Residents” that \nstated that “the Village is prepared to take any and all actions necessary to enforce the Village’s \nzoning code, under which this proposed use is not permitted.”  The letter did not state that the \nVillage was expecting a reasonable accommodation request from Trinity in the next few days or \nthat the Board of Trustees would be considering this request.  The Village did not send this letter \nto Trinity until after Mr. Owens learned about it over a month later and asked the Village for a \ncopy. \n32.  On August 7, 2019, the deadline agreed to by the Village, Mr. Polin sent Mr. \nMalina a seven-page letter by email.  On the first page of the letter, Mr. Polin wrote, “I am \nwriting this letter to request a reasonable accommodation pursuant to the Federal Fair Housing \nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(B) on behalf of TSL [Trinity Sober Living] and its prospective \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/24/20 Page 10 of 15 PageID #:10\nresidents, the owner of the property and its residents.”  The requested accommodation was to \n“waiv[e] the number of unrelated persons that can reside together as a family, and treat the use of \n111 N. Grant Street as a single family use.”  The letter cited extensive legal authority for the \nproposition that group homes and sober living homes like Trinity were entitled to reasonable \naccommodations under the FHA, notwithstanding their “commercial” aspects.  Mr. Polin \nreceived confirmation that evening that Mr. Malina had opened Mr. Polin’s email transmitting \nthe letter. \n33.  In contravention of the Village’s reasonable accommodation process and past \npractice, the Village did not forward Trinity’s reasonable accommodation request to the Board of \nTrustees.  Instead, on August 8, 2019—the very next day—the Village filed a lawsuit against \nTrinity in the Circuit Court for DuPage County, Illinois to enforce its zoning code.   \n34.  The Village’s lawsuit claimed that, even though Trinity’s sober home had fewer \nthan three unrelated residents at the time of filing, it was nevertheless currently in violation of \nthe zoning code because it was a “commercial” use.  The lawsuit did not define what constituted \na “commercial” use under the zoning code, but alleged that the sober home’s residents “will pay \nrent, must work or enroll in school, and will be monitored 24/7 by Trinity.”   \n35.  Based on the apparent criteria used by the Village, most group homes for persons \nwith disabilities would be considered a “commercial” use, regardless of the number of residents, \nand consequently barred from operating in single-family districts.  This is because, for most \ngroup homes, the residents pay rent, the agency operating the group home receives compensation \nfor the care and services being provided at the home, most residents must attend employment or \nday services programs during the day, and residents are monitored by the provider agency. \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/24/20 Page 11 of 15 PageID #:11\n36.  The Village’s lawsuit sought a declaration that the home violated the zoning code \nand fines of $500 for “each and every day” the home was operating.  The Village also later \nmoved for a preliminary injunction “[r]equiring Defendant to cease all commercial use of the \nProperty” and “enjoining Defendant from using the Property for a commercial use, or any other \nnon-permitted use[.]” The Village voluntarily moved to dismiss this lawsuit on June 15, 2020, \nand it is no longer pending. \n37.  At no time during the state court proceedings, which lasted over ten months, did \nthe Village inform the court that it had received or intended to consider a reasonable \naccommodation request from Trinity pursuant to the Fair Housing Act, which, if granted, would \nhave mooted some or all of the Village’s claims.  To the contrary, the Village repeatedly \ndisputed the Fair Housing Act’s relevance or applicability to the Village’s enforcement of its \nzoning code. \n38.  On August 12, 2019, after the Village had filed its lawsuit in state court, Mr. \nMalina responded to Mr. Polin.  Mr. Malina requested that Trinity provide him with the home’s \n“operational plan,” leases, and “any rules in place for residents.”  At least some of the requests \nfor documents concerned topics that had been discussed during the July 30, 2019 meeting \nbetween Trinity and Village officials, including Mr. Malina.  Mr. Malina did not ask for any \ninformation about the residents’ disabilities or their need for the requested accommodation, and \ndid not explain why the information he requested was relevant to Trinity’s reasonable \naccommodation request.  Mr. Malina stated that, once he received this information, he would \n“review your request” and “respond accordingly in more detail.” \n39.  Trinity provided the requested information on October 31, 2019.  The Village, \nhowever, did not respond further, nor did it refer the request to the Board of Trustees, consistent \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/24/20 Page 12 of 15 PageID #:12\nwith the Village’s process for addressing requests for reasonable accommodations in zoning and \nland use. \n40.  On November 13, 2020, the Village stated that, in response to the United States’ \nnotice of the filing of this lawsuit, it was now changing the position it has taken for the past one \nand one-half years, and now claims that it opposes Trinity’s right to operate in a single-family \ndistrict only because it intended to serve more than three unrelated persons, and not because the \nVillage regards Trinity as a “commercial use.”  The Village made clear that it was not \nwithdrawing any of its other positions with respect to Trinity, including its refusal to consider \nTrinity’s reasonable accommodation request.  Even under this new position, the Village’s actions \nwould still preclude all but the smallest group homes from operating.  For example, under \nIllinois law, group homes for persons with mental illness or intellectual disabilities may serve up \nto eight residents.  210 Ill. Comp. Stat. § 135/3(d).  Furthermore, as stated above, sober living \nhomes typically require more than three individuals to succeed therapeutically.      \nV. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount I: Violations of the Fair Housing Act \n41.  The allegations listed above are incorporated herein by reference.  \n42.  Trinity’s sober living home was a “dwelling” within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § \n3602(b).  \n43.  The residents who lived at Trinity’s sober living home, as well as those \nindividuals who applied to live at the home, were persons with disabilities within the meaning of \n42 U.S.C. § 3602(h).1   \n                                                 \n1  Throughout this Complaint, the United States uses the term “disability” instead of \n“handicap.”  For purposes of the FHA, the terms have the same meaning.  See Helen L. v. \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-06959 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/24/20 Page 13 of 15 PageID #:13\n44.

Defendants have acted intentionally, willfully, and in disregard for the rights of \nothers. \n46.  Defendant’s actions as described above constitute a pattern or practice of \nresistance to the full enjoyment of rights granted by the Fair Housing Act, or a denial of rights \nprotected by the Fair Housing Act to a group of persons, which denial raises an issue of general \npublic importance, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3614(a). \n47.  Trinity Sober Living, the residents of Trinity’s sober home, and other persons \nand/or agencies who may have been the victims of Defendant’s discriminatory conduct are \n                                                 \nDiDario, 46 F.3d 325, 330 n.8 (3d Cir.)

Staubus, for its complaint \nagainst Defendant, VILLAGE OF HINSDALE, an Illinois municipal corporation (“Defendant”) \nalleges as follows: \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \nThis matter arises pursuant to the Fair Housing Act of 1968, as amended by the Fair \nHousing Amendments Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. (“FHA”); and the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. (“ADA”).  Plaintiff, Trinity Sober Living LLC, seeks \ndamages and injunctive relief as redress for: (1) the disparate impact visited upon them due to the \nacts and decisions of the Defendant and its subsidiary or affiliate organizations; (2) the affirmative \ndisability-based discrimination manifested in Defendant’s acts and decisions; and (3) Defendant’s \ndiscriminatory refusal and denial to provide Plaintiff a reasonable accommodation in keeping with \nFederal anti-discrimination laws. \n \n\nCase: 1:19-cv-07321 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/06/19 Page 2 of 11 PageID #:1\n  The  aforementioned  denials  of  Plaintiff’s  applications  now  threaten  residents  of  the \nPlaintiff -- who are disabled pursuant to the FHA and ADA -- with impending eviction based on \ndiscriminatory means.  To prevent such a result, Plaintiff hereby asks this Honorable Court for \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief to halt the Defendant’s discrimination against them on the basis \nof handicap or disability in violation of the FHA and ADA, respectively.  Additionally, Plaintiff \nseeks monetary damages, costs, and reasonable attorneys’ fees. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n1.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. §§1331, \n1343; 42 U.S.C. §3613; and 42 U.S.C. §12133. \n2.  Venue is proper in the United States District Court for the Northern District of \nIllinois, Eastern Division as all acts complained of occurred within this District. \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff is an Illinois limited liability company, with a principal place of business \nin Hinsdale, Illinois.  It provides affordable housing and supports individuals with disabilities \nincluding those who are recovering from substance abuse and/or alcoholism located at 111 N. \nGrant Hinsdale, Illinois (hereinafter referred to herein as the “House”). \n4.  The Defendant is a political subdivision of the State of Illinois.  The Defendant is \nresponsible for the acts of its agents and employees as well as the enactment, enforcement, and \napplication of the Village Code (“Code”) of the Village of Hinsdale. \nSTATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK \n5.  In 1988, Congress amended the FHA to extend the guarantee of fair housing to \nhandicapped individuals.  Congress also authorized the Secretary of the United States Department \nof Housing and Urban Development to promulgate regulations to implement the FHA. \n2 \n\nCase: 1:19-cv-07321 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/06/19 Page 3 of 11 PageID #:1\n6.  Under the FHA, a person is subject to a “handicap” if she or he has a “physical or \nmental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person’s major life activities, a \nrecord of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment.”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 3602(h).  The term “physical or mental impairment” includes “alcoholism” and “drug addiction \n(other than addiction caused by current, illegal use of a controlled substance).”  24 C.F.R. \n§ 100.201.  The ADA uses similar terminology to define a “disability.”  See, e.g., Tsombandis v. \nWest Haven Fire Dept., 352 F.3d 565 (2d. Cir. 2003). \n7.  Under  the  FHA,  it  is  unlawful  to  discriminate  against  or  otherwise  make \nunavailable or deny a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a handicap of that buyer, renter, \nor person residing in, or intending to reside in, that dwelling after it is sold, rented, or made \navailable.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(1). \n8.  The FHA further provides that it is unlawful to discriminate against any person in \nthe terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services \nor facilities in connection with such dwelling, based in a handicap of such person residing in or \nintending to reside in that dwelling after it is sold, rented, or otherwise made available.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 3604(f)(2). \n9.  The  federal  regulations  implementing  the  FHA  specifically  define  as \ndiscriminatory activity and prohibit the provision of municipal services in a different manner as \nbased on a handicap.  24 C.F.R. § 100.70(d)(4). \n10.  The federal regulations implementing the FHA further make it unlawful “to restrict \nor attempt to restrict the choices of a person by word or conduct in connection with seeking, \nnegotiating for, buying or renting a dwelling so as to . . . discourage or obstruct choices in a \ncommunity, neighborhood or development” because of a handicap.  24 C.F.R. § 100.70(a). \n3 \n\nCase: 1:19-cv-07321 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/06/19 Page 4 of 11 PageID #:1\n11.  The ADA requires that no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, program, \nor activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any municipal entity.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 12132.  \n12.  The federal  regulations implementing the  ADA  prohibit a public entity  from \nadministering a licensing program or establishing certain requirements for activities of a licensee \nin a manner that subjects qualified disabled individuals to discrimination on the basis of their \ndisability.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(6). \n13.  The federal regulations implementing the ADA also make it unlawful for a public \nentity, in determining the site or location of a facility, to make selections that have the purpose or \neffect of excluding individuals with disabilities, denying them the benefits of certain locations, or \notherwise subjecting them to discrimination.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(4)(I). \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n14.  In June 2019, TSL purchased the subject property for use as a sober house.  \n15.  All of the individuals who participate in TSL’s program and reside in the House are \nindividuals with handicap or disability by virtue of their alcohol or chemical dependency combined \nwith their completion of a substance abuse treatment program.  All participants of TSL’s program \nand residents of the House must remain drug and alcohol-free while participating in TSL’s \nprogram and residing at the House.   \n16.  At the House, TSL provides a peer-driven sober living environment designed to \nincrease self-responsibility and support for persons in recovery.  The House provides a supportive \natmosphere that is designed to increase self-responsibility and support for persons in recovery from \nalcoholism and substance abuse.  TSL does not provide a “recovery program” or services.   There \nis no counseling, or therapy offered to the residents. \n4 \n\nCase: 1:19-cv-07321 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/06/19 Page 5 of 11 PageID #:1\n17.  The residents of the House must willingly choose to participate in the TSL program \nand reside at the House.  Residents of the House live together as a family and make group decisions \nbased on democratic procedures.  The House is used as single family home with similar support \nand collaborative functions.  The residents of the House relate to each other as the functional \nequivalent of a single family. \n18.  All of the residents of the House have access to the entire house, all of the household \nfacilities and function together as a single housekeeping unit.  There are not any special locks on \nthe doors of the bedrooms or other rooms in the House.  The residents share all household \nresponsibilities, and live together to create a “family” atmosphere, where all aspects of domestic \nlife are shared by all the residents.  \n19.  Neither TSL nor the House is a substance abuse treatment center, halfway house, \nshelter, or a community care facility.  There are no treatment, counseling, therapy, or any type of \nhealth care services provided at the House or by TSL.  TSL is not licensed by the State of Illinois \nand is not required to be licensed.  There are no institutional personnel involved in the supervision \nor management of the House.   \n20.  The Code governs zoning and land use policy in the Village of Hinsdale. \n21.  The current version of the Code defines “family” as follows: \n“FAMILY \nOne or more persons related by blood, marriage, legal adoption, or guardianship, \nor not more than three (3) persons not so related, together with gratuitous guests \nand domestic servants, living together as a single housekeeping unit.” \n \n22.  Soon after TSL purchased the House, the Village of Hinsdale became aware that \nTSL intended on operating a sober living house. \n5 \n\nCase: 1:19-cv-07321 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/06/19 Page 6 of 11 PageID #:1\n23.  Therefore, on or about July 18, 2019, Thomas K. Cauley, Jr. (“Cauley”), the \nPresident for the Village of Hinsdale, wrote a letter to Michael Owens, the manager of TSL, \nwherein he advised Mr. Owens that the Village had received information that TSL intended on \nrunning “a facility where ten (10) unrelated people will reside.”  Cauley further advised TSL that \nthis facility is not a permitted use in the particular zoning district within the Village of Hinsdale. \n24.  On or about August 7, 2019, Steven G. Polin (“Polin”), an attorney for TSL, \nresponded to Cauley’s letter by sending a letter to Lance Malina, the attorney for the Village of \nHinsdale.  Polin advised Malina that the residents of the House were a protected class of persons \npursuant to the FHA and ADA by virtue of being in recovery from alcoholism and drug addiction.  \nHe further advised Malina that the Village’s anticipated enforcement of the Code against TSL for \nusing the House as a “sober house” constituted illegal discrimination under the FHA and ADA. \n25.  Polin also requested that the Village of Hinsdale make the following reasonable \naccommodations pursuant to the FHA and to treat TSL’s use of the House as a single-family use.  \n26.  In response, the Village of Hinsdale filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of \nDuPage County naming TSL as a defendant seeking to enjoin TSL’s use of the House as a sober \nliving facility. \n27.  Since the filing of the DuPage County complaint, on October 31, 2019, TSL sent \nadditional information in support of their reasonable accommodation request.   \n28.  As of the filing of this complaint, the Village of Hinsdale has not responded. \n29.  The effect of Defendant’s actions has been to prevent TSL and residents from \nresiding at the dwelling of their choice or in any other home zoned for single family use in the \nVillage. \n6 \n\nCase: 1:19-cv-07321 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/06/19 Page 7 of 11 PageID #:1\n30.  Plaintiffs are aggrieved persons under 42 U.S.C. §§ 3602(d) and (I), who have been \ninjured by Defendant’s discriminatory conduct and have suffered damages, economic loss and a \nloss of civil rights as a result of Defendant’s conduct.  \n31.  The House is a dwelling within the meaning of § 802(b) of the FHA, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 3602(b). \n32.  The effect of Defendant’s actions is to deny needed housing opportunities to \nrecovering alcoholics and substance abusers who are disabled under the FHA within the Village \nof Hinsdale. \n33.  The Village Code of the Village of Hinsdale does not have a procedure for \nprocessing requests for a reasonable accommodation in the zoning context pursuant to the FHA. \n34.  The effect of the conduct of the Defendant is to limit the housing opportunities of \nunrelated disabled persons by denying them the right to live together as a group in any residential \nzoning district within the Village of Hinsdale. \n35.  Defendant is treating the residents of the House in a discriminatory fashion and is \nimposing far more stringent requirements on this group of unrelated disabled individuals than on \nothers. \n36.  By classifying the premises described above as a prohibited use in residential zones \nin the Village, Defendant is arbitrarily and illegally making single family housing unavailable to \ndisabled persons recovering from drugs and alcohol addiction. \n37.  Defendant has acted under color of the law of the State of Illinois enforcing the \nCode with the purpose and effect of discriminating against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s residents solely \nbecause of their handicap and disability. \n7 \n\nCase: 1:19-cv-07321 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/06/19 Page 8 of 11 PageID #:1\n38.  Plaintiff’s residents are living in fear of losing their home and are suffering anxiety, \nemotional distress, pain, setbacks in their efforts at recovery, and other irreparable harm as a result \nof Defendant’s actions.  They have no adequate remedy at law. \n39.  Defendant has denied Plaintiff’s rights to due process of law by its arbitrary \nclassification of the House. \n40.  Defendant has failed to further the objective of providing fair housing under the \nFHA in arbitrarily administering its Code. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Discrimination Under the FHA) \n41.
