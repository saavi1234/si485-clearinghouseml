The State sued President Biden and the following federal offices (or officials associated with those offices) seeking declaratory relief: the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Management and Budget, the General Services Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Defense. The State challenged EO 14042 on the grounds that the vaccination requirement violated the Procurement Act, the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), and the U.S. Constitution's Spending Clause and non-delegation principle.</p>\r\n<p>On November 15, 2021, the State filed a motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) seeking to prevent enforcement of the vaccination requirement, arguing it was a violation of Texans&rsquo; constitutional rights. The court stayed the case on December 10, 2021, following a ruling from the Southern District of Georgia enacting a nationwide injunction that provided the relief Texas sought. <em><a href=\"../../../../case/18610/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Georgia v.

Subsequently, the district court in this lawsuit ordered supplemental briefing on: 1) whether this case remained a live controversy; 2) how the Eleventh Circuit&rsquo;s opinion affected the originally requested relief; and 3) what changes, if any, were appropriate to the injunctive relief Texas originally requested.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After reviewing the briefing, on October 20, 2022, the court issued an order denying the State&rsquo;s motion for a TRO. The court found that the State had not shown imminent harm stemming from the Executive Order because defendants had, one day prior, issued guidance directing agencies not to enforce the challenged vaccination requirement. Given this directive not to enforce, the court found that EO 14042 posed no threat of immediate harm to Texas, and there was no reason to grant the TRO.</p>\r\n<p>On March 6, 2023, the court held a status conference and lifted the stay.

BIDEN, et al.,  §  \n  §  \n              Defendants.  §  \n \nORDER \n \n  Before  the  court  is  the  State  of  Texas’s  motion  for  a  preliminary \ninjunction,1  filed  November  15,  2021,  seeking  to  block  enforcement  and \nimplementation  of  Executive  Order  14042  and  its  implementing \nregulations.2 Dkt. 6. The court DENIES the motion. \nThe court stayed this case on December 10, 2021, following a Georgia \ndistrict court’s nationwide injunction that provided the relief Texas sought. \nGeorgia v. Biden, 574 F. Supp. 3d 1337, 1357 (S.D. Ga. 2021). On August 26, \n \n1 Texas originally asked this court for a temporary restraining order and \npreliminary injunction. See Dkt. 6. During a telephonic hearing on November 16, \n2021, the court ruled that it would treat the motion as one for a preliminary \ninjunction only. Dkt. 18, Hrg. Tr. 29:9–11. \n2 See generally, Determination of the OMB Director Regarding the Revised \nSafer Federal Workforce Task Force Guidance for Federal Contractors and the \nRevised Economy & Efficiency Analysis, 86 Fed. Reg. 63418, 63418–25 (Nov. 16, \n2021);  COVID-19  Workplace  Safety:  Guidance  for  Federal  Contractors  and \nSubcontractors,  Safer  Federal  Workforce  Task  Force  (Nov.  10,  2021), \nhttps://perma.cc/8A7Y-ZYR5. \n1/4 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 58   Filed on 10/20/22 in TXSD   Page 2 of 4\n2022,  the  Eleventh  Circuit  narrowed  the  nationwide  injunction  to  the \noriginal parties, excluding Texas. See Georgia v. President of the United \nStates,  46  F.4th  1283,  1308  (11th  Cir.  2022).  Subsequently,  this  court \nordered  supplemental  briefing  on:  (1)  whether  this  case  remains  a  live \ncontroversy; (2) how the Eleventh Circuit’s opinion affects the originally \nrequested  relief;  and  (3)  what  changes,  if  any,  are  appropriate  to  the \ninjunctive relief Texas originally requested. Dkt. 54. \nAfter reviewing the parties’ supplemental briefing, the court finds that \nTexas  has  not  shown  imminent  harm.  The  party  seeking  a  preliminary \ninjunction  must  show  “that  the  injury  is  imminent,”  Humana,  Inc.  v. \nJacobson, 804 F.2d 1390, 1394 (5th Cir. 1986), and that the threatened \nirreparable harm is “more than mere speculation,” Janvey v. Alguire, 647 \nF.3d 585, 601 (5th Cir. 2011); see also NiGen Biotech, L.L.C. v. Paxton, 804 \nF.3d 389, 395 (5th Cir. 2015) (“[T]he Article III minimum for standing to \nrequest an injunction . . . requires ongoing harm or a threat of imminent \nharm.”) (citing City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105, 103 (1983)). \nTexas argues that because the defendants declined to enter an agreed \npreliminary  injunction  in  this  case,  it  continues  to  face  imminent  harm \nstemming from Executive Order 14042. Dkt. 55 at 2. The court disagrees. On \n2/4 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 58   Filed on 10/20/22 in TXSD   Page 3 of 4\nOctober 19, 2022,3 the body charged with implementing and enforcing EO \n14042—the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force—issued guidance directing \nagencies that:  \nDespite the [Eleventh Circuit’s] lifting of the nationwide bar to \nenforcement . . . at this time agencies should not: (1) take any \nsteps to require covered contractors and subcontractors to come \ninto compliance with previously issued Task Force guidance; or \n(2) enforce any contract clauses implementing Executive Order \n14042.”4  \n \nThe  Office  of  Management  and  Budget’s  complementary  guidance \nspecifically  directs  agencies  to  not  (1)  enforce  existing  contract  clauses \nimplementing EO 14042, (2) modify contracts to add a clause implementing \nEO 14042, or (3) include contract clauses implementing EO 14042 in any \nnew solicitations.5 Taking the defendants at their word, the court finds that \nEO 14042 poses no threat of immediate harm to Texas, and so DENIES its \nmotion for preliminary injunction.  \n \n3 Though the Task Force published the guidance after the parties submitted \nsupplemental briefing, the court takes judicial notice of it. See Ferguson v. Extraco \nMortg. Co., 264 F. App’x 351, 352 (5th Cir. 2007) (citing Taylor v. Charter Med. \nCorp., 162 F.3d 827, 829 (5th Cir.1998) (noting that courts may take judicial notice \nof facts not subject to reasonable dispute because they are “(1) generally known \nwithin the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court, or (2) capable of accurate and \nready determination by resort to resources whose accuracy cannot be questioned”). \n4  For  Federal  Contractors,  Safer  Federal  Workforce, \nhttps://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/contractors/ (October 19, 2022). \n5 OMB Guidance for Agencies_EO 14042_20221019, Office of Management \nand Budget, 2 (2022), https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/downloads/OMB \n%20Guidance%20for%20Agencies_EO%2014042_20221019.pdf \n3/4 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 58   Filed on 10/20/22 in TXSD   Page 4 of 4\nSigned on Galveston Island this 20th day of October, 2022. \n             \n \n \n___________________________ \nJEFFREY VINCENT BROWN \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n \n4/4 ",

INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Countless  Texans  and  other  Americans  are  being  forced  to  choose  between  their \nlivelihoods and their fundamental constitutional rights. The State of Texas and its officials have \nsought to protect individual rights while also encouraging and promoting effective public health \ntechniques to combat the spread of COVID-19. The federal government, however, has launched a \ncoordinated effort to decide for itself whether and when Americans must receive the vaccine, \nregardless of individual preference, healthcare needs, or religious beliefs.  \n2.  Our Constitution provides for a federal government of limited powers, and it does not and \nhas never had a general police power that would give it the right to dictate any and every facet of \nits citizens’ lives. But Defendants have no regard for the limits that the Constitution and federal \nstatutes impose upon them. Defendants’ actions are nothing short of a dramatic infringement upon \nindividual liberties, principles of federalism and separation of powers, and the rule of law.  \n3.  Even worse, the federal government’s cowardice has led it to have federal contractors do \ntheir dirty work. Rather than impose a vaccine mandate directly, Defendants are coercing federal \ncontractors into demanding that the millions of Americans they employ get vaccinated or lose their \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     2 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 3 of 34\njobs. Defendants also require contractors to dictate the lives of not only those performing work \nconnected to federal contracts, but also those employees who may not perform any federal work at \nall. Simply due to the misfortune of working for a company that may have a federal contract, an \nAmerican may be forced to receive a vaccine they do not want or else lose their job.  \n4.  The federal government’s overreach must come to an end. Defendants are using subterfuge \nto  accomplish  what  they  cannot  achieve  directly—universal  compliance  with  their  vaccine \nmandates,  regardless  of  individual  preferences,  healthcare  needs,  or  religious  beliefs.  And \nDefendants effectively claim for themselves a general police power to control American life, \ninfringing on states’ sovereignty and  usurping the powers reserved to the states under the \nConstitution. \n5.  President Biden himself has expressed little tolerance for those who do not share his views, \nas he put on public display when he announced that his “patience was wearing thin”1 with \nAmericans who choose not to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The President has further singled \nout Texas as an enemy because of its stance in favor of individual liberty. Speaking about Texas \nGovernor Greg Abbott, President Biden threatened that “[i]f they’ll not help—if these governors \nwon’t help us beat the pandemic, I’ll use my power as President to get them out of the way.”2 And \nyet, then-President-Elect Biden previously vowed not to demand any mandatory vaccinations. 3 \n \n1 Joseph Biden, Remarks by President Biden on Fighting the Covid-19 Pandemic (Sept. 9, 2021), \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/09/remarks-by-\npresident-biden-on-fighting-the-covid-19-pandemic-3/ (last visited Oct. 27, 2021). \n2 Id. \n3 Jacob Jarvis, “Fact Check: Did Joe Biden Reject Idea of Mandatory Vaccines in \nDecember  2020?,”  Newsweek  (Sept.  10,  2021),  https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check-joe-\nbiden-no-vaccines-mandatory-december-2020-1627774 (last visited Oct. 27, 2021). \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     3 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 4 of 34\n6.  Through a conflicting, vague, and confusing web of executive orders, task force directives, \nand contract requirements, Defendants have made it obvious that they will accept nothing less than \ncomplete obedience and compliance with their vision for how to fight COVID-19. Defendants \napparently have no concern for the disastrous potential effects of Defendants’ coercive tactics on \nthe economy or the erosion of Americans’ liberties. Even one American being forced by their \ngovernment to receive a vaccine that they do not want out of fear of losing their job is an irreparable \ninjury and a stain on Defendants’ records. But the broader implications of these unlawful vaccine \nmandates, if they are not stopped, portend a dark future for the economy and the American way of \nlife. \n7.  The State of Texas respectfully requests that the Court put an end to these unlawful and \ncoercive tactics and stop this pernicious erosion of fundamental rights. \nII.  PARTIES \n \n8.  Plaintiff State of Texas is a sovereign State of the United States of America and has the \nauthority and responsibility to protect its sovereign interests, its public fisc, and the health, safety, \nand individual liberties of its citizens. \n9.

This Court has jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. §§ 702 and 703 and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1346, \nand 1361, under the United States Constitution, and pursuant to the Court’s equitable powers. \n25.  The Court is authorized to award the requested declaratory and injunctive relief under \n5 U.S.C. §§ 702 and 706 and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1361, 2201, and 2202. \n26.  Venue is proper within this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because (1) Plaintiff \nis the State of Texas and no real property is involved and (2) “a substantial part of the events or \nomissions giving rise to the claim occurred” in this District. \nIV.  LEGAL BACKGROUND \n \n27.  Federal contracting and procurement is an arcane area of law that is difficult to navigate, \nand Defendants have weaponized that complexity. In attempting to impose a vaccination mandate \non their contractors, Defendants have run afoul of federal law in many respects, as described below. \nThe interlocking federal statutes and requirements at issue lead to one inescapable conclusion: the \nfederal executive branch cannot achieve its unlawful policy outcomes through clever manipulation \nof federal contracts and contractors. \nA.  The Procurement Act. \n28.  The purpose of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (“Procurement \nAct”), adopted by Congress in 1949, “is to provide the Federal Government with an economical \nand efficient system for” procurement. 40 U.S.C. § 101. “The text of the Procurement Act and \nits legislative history indicate that Congress was troubled by the absence of central management \nthat  could  coordinate  the  entire  government’s  procurement  activities  in  an  efficient  and \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     6 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 7 of 34\neconomical manner.” Chamber of Comm. of U.S. v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1333 (D.C. Cir. 1996) \n(citation omitted).  \n29.  The legislative history of the Procurement Act is replete with references to the need for an \n“efficient, businesslike system of property management.” Id. at 1333 (citation omitted). The \nProcurement Act authorizes the President to “prescribe policies and directives that the President \nconsiders necessary to carry out” the Act but requires that such policies prescribed by the \nPresident “be consistent with” the Act. 40 U.S.C. § 121(a).  \n30.  Such policies, and regulations established pursuant to them, are not valid unless there is a \n“nexus between the regulation and some delegation of the requisite legislative authority by \nCongress,” and “the reviewing court [must] reasonably be able to conclude that the grant of \nauthority contemplates the regulations issued.” Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 304, 308 \n(1979). Congress did not authorize the President to issue orders with the force or effect of law, as \nit authorized the GSA Administrator to do. Compare 40 U.S.C. § 121(a) (“prescribe polices and \ndirectives”), with id. § 121(c) (“prescribe regulations”); see also Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. \n692, 711 n.9 (2004) (“[W]hen the legislature uses certain language in one part of the statute and \ndifferent language in another, the court assumes different meanings were intended.”).  \n31.  No nexus exists when the President prescribes policies that are “too attenuated to allow a \nreviewing court to find the requisite connection between procurement costs and social objectives.” \nLiberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Friedman, 639 F.2d 164, 171 (4th Cir. 1981). Nor does a nexus exist when \nsuch  policies  are  imposed  on  subcontractors,  who  have  “no  direct  connection  to  federal \nprocurement” and do “not lie ‘reasonably within the contemplation of’ the Procurement Act.” \nId. at 171–72.   \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     7 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 8 of 34\n32.  The Procurement Act does not give the President “unlimited authority to make decisions \nhe believes will likely result in savings to the government . . . the procurement power must be \nexercised consistently with the structure and purposes of the statute that delegates that power.” \nReich, 74 F.3d 1322 at 1330–31. \nB.  The Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act. \n33.  The Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (“Procurement Policy Act”) requires that \na procurement policy, regulation, procedure, or form (including an amendment or \nmodification thereto) may not take effect until 60 days after it is published for public \ncomment in the Federal Register . . . if it—(A) relates to the expenditure of \nappropriate funds; and (B)(i) has a significant effect beyond the internal operating \nprocedures of the agency issuing the policy, regulation, procedure, or form; or (ii) \nhas a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. \n \n41 U.S.C. § 1707(a); see also 41 U.S.C. § 401 et seq.  \n34.  “[T]he language of [§ 1707] is broad” and applies not only to FAR but to all procurement \npolicies, regulations, procedures, and forms “‘down to the lowest level.’” Munitions Carriers \nConf., Inc. v. United States, 932 F. Supp. 334, 338 (D.D.C. 1996), rev’d on other grounds, 147 F.3d \n1027 (D.C. Cir. 1998).   \n35.  The  notice  requirement  may  only  be  “waived  by  the  officer  authorized  to  issue  a \nprocurement policy, regulation, procedure, or form if urgent and compelling circumstances make \ncompliance with the requirements impracticable.” 41 U.S.C. § 1707(d). And even when Section \n1707 has been waived, the Procurement Policy Act implementing regulations require that revisions \nsubject to a waiver “shall be issued on a temporary basis and shall provide for at least a 30-day \npublic comment period.” 48 C.F.R. § 1.501–3(b). \n \n \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     8 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 9 of 34\nC.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation.  \n36.  As the problems with continuity and coordination amongst the many federal agencies \nproved  problematic,  in  1979  Congress  directed  the  Office  of  Federal  Procurement  Policy \n(“OFPP”), an office within the OMB, to “issue policy directives . . . for the purpose of promoting \nthe development and implementation of [a] uniform procurement system,” with the concurrence \nof the OMB Director.4 Under the policy directive of the Administrator of the OFPP, in 1983 the \nDepartment of Defense, GSA, and NASA jointly promulgated the first version of the Federal \nAcquisition Regulation (“FAR”).5 \n37.  In 1988, Congress established the FAR Council “to assist in the direction and coordination \nof  [g]overnment-wide  procurement  policy  and  [g]overnment-wide  procurement  regulatory \nactivities in the [f]ederal government.” 41 U.S.C. § 1302(a). The FAR Council consists of the \nOFPP Administrator, the Secretary of Defense, and the Administrator of NASA, and the GSA \nAdministrator. 41 U.S.C. § 1302(b). Subject to limited exceptions, the FAR Council has the \nexclusive authority to issue “a single [g]overnment-wide procurement regulation.” 41 U.S.C. \n§ 1302(a)(1); see also 41 U.S.C. § 1303. Importantly, no other agency is authorized to issue \ngovernment-wide procurement regulations. 41 U.S.C. § 1302(a)(2).  \n38.  Within the delegated authority relating to procurement policies, Congress requires that \n“procurement policy, regulation, procedure, or form”—whether issued government-wide by the \nFAR Council or by one agency for that agency—be subject to notice and comment. 41 U.S.C. \n \n4 See Office of Federal Procurement Policy Amendments of 1979, Pub. L. No. 96-83, § 4(e), 93 \nStat. 650; see also Kate M. Manual et al., Cong. Rsch. Serv., R4286, The Federal Acquisition \nRegulation  (FAR):  Answers  to  Frequently  Asked  Questions  10  (2015), \nhttps://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R42826.pdf (last visited Oct. 28, 2021). \n5 48 Fed. Reg. 42, 102 (Sept. 19, 1983). \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     9 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 10 of 34\n§ 1707(a)-(b).  The  notice  and  comment  requirement  may  be  waived  only  if  “urgent  and \ncompelling circumstances make compliance with the requirements impracticable.” 41 U.S.C. \n§ 1707(d).  \nD.  The Major Questions Doctrine. \n39.  Courts will not assume that Congress has assigned to Executive Branch questions of “deep \neconomic and political significance” unless Congress has done so expressly. See King v. Burwell, \n576 U.S. 473, 486 (2015); FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 160 (2000). \nBy Defendants’ own estimates, the Contractor Mandate6 will affect “millions” of individuals. On \naverage, federal government spending accounts for 20% to 25% of the U.S. economy and has been \neven  higher  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  This  year  alone,  the  U.S.  Small  Business \nAdministration announced that it awarded $145.7 billion in federal contract dollars to small \nbusinesses.7 Accordingly, Defendants’ vaccine mandates will have deep economic and political \nsignificance on a substantial portion of the economy. \n40.  Defendants’  attempt to use  the Procurement  Act as justification for the  Contractor \nMandate mirrors the Defendants’ attempt to use the Public Health Safety Act to justify a far-\nreaching nationwide eviction moratorium. Determining that the CDC had exceeded its authority, \nthe Supreme Court held, “We expect Congress to speak clearly when authorizing an agency to \nexercise powers of ‘vast economic and political significance.’” Ala. Ass’n of Realtors v. Dep’t of \nHealth & Hum. Servs., 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2489 (2021) (quoting Utility Air Regulatory Grp. v. EPA, \n \n6 See Part V.B, infra. \n7 Federal Government Awards Record-Breaking $145.7 Billion in Contracting to Small Businesses, July \n28,  2021,  https://www.sba.gov/article/2021/jul/28/federal-government-awards-record-\nbreaking-1457-billion-contracting-small-businesses (last visited Oct. 2, 2021).  \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     10 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 11 of 34\n573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014)). This is particularly true when the federal government “intrudes into \nan area that is the particular domain of state law.” Id. The Supreme Court’s “precedents require \nCongress to enact exceedingly clear language if it wishes to significantly alter the balance between \nfederal and state power and the power of the Government over private property.” Id. The \nProcurement Act contains no language authorizing the President to issue and impose mandatory \nnationwide public health measures.  \nV.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n \n41.  Against the backdrop of this legal framework, Defendants have attempted to abuse the \nfederal contracting and procurement process to force potentially millions of Americans to receive \nunwanted medical treatment. These efforts are already bringing acute and irreparable harm to \ncountless Texans, with disastrous effects looming on the horizon for the State and its citizens. \n  Biden Administration Response to COVID-19. \n42.  On January 20, 2021, his first day in office, President Biden issued Executive Order \n(“EO”) 13991, 86 Fed. Reg. 7045, which established the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force \n(“Task Force”) and charged it with “provid[ing] ongoing guidance to heads of agencies on the \noperation  of  the  Federal  Government,  the  safety  of  its  employees,  and  the  continuity  of \nGovernment functions during the COVID-19 pandemic.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 7046. The Task Force \nis headed by three co-chairs, including the Director of OPM (Defendant Ahuja), the Administrator \nof GSA (Defendant Carnahan), and the COVID-19 Response Coordinator (Defendant Zients). EO \n13991 also required that the GSA “provide funding and administrative support for” the Task \nForce. Id.  \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     11 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 12 of 34\n43.  On  September  9,  2021,  President  Biden  announced  his  “new  plan  to  require  more \nAmericans to be vaccinated” by imposing “new vaccination requirements” that “require all \nemployers with 100 or more employees, that together employ over 80 million workers, to ensure \ntheir workforces are fully vaccinated or show a negative test at least once a week.”8 President Biden \nalso announced plans to “require vaccinations” of “those who work in hospitals, home healthcare \nfacilities, or other medical facilities—a total of 17 million healthcare workers.”9 He further \nannounced he would “sign an executive order that will now require all executive branch federal \nemployees to be vaccinated – all. And I’ve signed another executive order that will require federal \ncontractors to do the same.”10 Finally, President Biden announced that he would “require all of \nnearly 300,000 educators in the federal paid program, Head Start program,” to get vaccinated.11 \nIn total, President Biden’s vaccine mandates affect over 80 million Americans, a quarter of the \ntotal population of the United States, and one in three adult Americans.12  \n44.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases \nunder the Biden Administration, supports “many, many more [vaccine] mandates,”13 but last \nyear, he held an entirely different position: “You don’t want to mandate and try and force anyone \n \n8 The U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) sent \na proposed emergency regulation to the White House for review.

We’ve never done that.” He continued, “[A vaccine mandate] would be \nunenforceable and inappropriate.”14 \n45.  Similarly, before September 2021, Defendants’ consistent position had been that the \nfederal government lacks the authority Defendants are now claiming to possess. For example, on \nJuly 23, 2021, the White House acknowledged that imposing vaccine mandates is “not the role of \nthe federal government; that is the role that institutions, private-sector entities, and others may \ntake . . . . [W]e’re going to continue to work in partnership to fight misinformation. And we’re \ngoing to continue to advocate and work in partnership with local officials and – and trusted voices \nto get the word out.”15 Then President-Elect Biden made nearly identical comments in response \nto a question about whether COVID-19 vaccines should be made mandatory, stating: “[n]o, I don’t \nthink it should be mandatory. I wouldn’t demand it to be mandatory.”16   \nB.  The Contractor Mandate. \n46.  On September 9, 2021, President Biden signed EO 14042, titled Executive Order on \nEnsuring Adequate COVID Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors, attached as Exhibit A.  \n \n14  Joel  Saget,  COVID-19  vaccine  won’t  be  mandatory  in  US,  says  Fauci,  Aug.  19,  2020, \nhttps://www.yahoo.com/now/covid-19-vaccine-wont-mandatory-\n194038185.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=\nAQAAAJT4sIDp7k-\ntPsJykruGU6nB9lc4OF06tgUuLj_5yfA64cOBruF5BTeM3o75aTICcCOCjinKlMgTXWx5kptj\nbu26VeA_XOcFLsMu7WQuJ7aLGcxG57UhmBHj6Z9SDlOwbS9i6txpMthNrALU7jblr58NVy\niAZA-WXF2HZ8rfWg-9&guccounter=2 (last visited Oct. 29, 2021).  \n15 Jen Psaki, White House Press Briefing (July 23, 2021), https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-\nroom/press-briefings/2021/07/23/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-july-23-2021/ \n(last visited Oct. 27, 2021) \n16 Jacob Jarvis, “Fact Check: Did Joe Biden Reject Idea of Mandatory Vaccines in \nDecember  2020?,”  Newsweek  (Sept.  10,  2021),  https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check-joe-\nbiden-no-vaccines-mandatory-december-2020-1627774 (last visited Oct. 27, 2021) \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     13 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 14 of 34\n47.  EO 14042 purports to “promote[] economy and efficiency in Federal procurement by \nensuring that the parties that contract with the Federal Government provide adequate COVID-19 \nsafeguards to their workers.” Ex. A at 1. In EO 14042, President Biden claims “ensuring that \nFederal contractors and subcontractors are adequately protected from COVID-19 will bolster \neconomy and efficiency in Federal procurement.” Id.  \n48.  EO 14042 directs executive agencies subject to the Procurement Act to include in all \nfederal contracts and “contract-like instruments” a clause that contractors and subcontractors will \ncomply with all future guidance issued by the Task Force.  \n49.  EO 14042 requires that the Task Force establish and issue “COVID Safety Protocols” by \nSeptember 24, 2021.17 The EO did not explicitly make any provision for religious or medical \nexemptions to the “Safety Protocols.” \n50.  EO 14042 further required that the Director of OMB publish a determination in the Federal \nRegister  as  to  “whether  such  Guidance  will  promote  economy  and  efficiency  in  Federal \ncontracting if adhered to by Government contractors and subcontractors.” Ex. A at 2.  \n51.  On September 24, 2021, the Task Force released a directive to federal agencies for \nimplementing Defendants’ vaccine mandate on contractors and subcontractors (the “Task Force \nDirective”), attached as Exhibit B.18 This directive was never published to the Federal Register \nfor public comment. Among many things, the Task Force Directive included the following:  \na.  A deadline of December 8, 2021, for “covered contractor employees” to be fully \n \n17  Exec.

A definition of the term “covered contractor employee” to “include[] employees of \ncovered contractors who are not themselves working on or in connection with a covered \ncontract” if they are working at the same location, thus imposing vaccine requirements \non employees of contractors and subcontractors who are not even working on federal \ncontracts.20 \n \nc.  A requirement that the FAR Council conduct rulemaking to amend the FAR to impose \nthe Contractor Mandate.21 \n \nd.  A deadline of October 8, 2021, for the FAR Council to develop a contract clause to \nimplement the Contractor Mandate for agencies to include in contracts. The Directive \nalso instructs the FAR Council to “recommend that agencies exercise their authority \nto deviate from the FAR” and use the vaccination mandate clause in contracts even \nbefore the FAR is amended.22  \n \ne.  A deadline of October 15, 2021, for agencies to include that contractual clause in \nsolicitations.23  \n \nf.  A deadline of November 14, 2021, after which awarded contracts must include that \ncontractual  clause.  For  contracts  entered  into  between  October  15,  2021,  and \nNovember 14, 2021, and for which the solicitation was issued before October 15, 2021, \nthe guidance states that agencies are encouraged to include the clause but are not \nrequired to do so.24  \n \ng.  A requirement that for contracts awarded “prior to October 15 and where performance \nis ongoing” the vaccine mandate clause “must be incorporated at the point at which an \noption is exercised, or an extension is made.”25  \n \nh.  Requirements that the Contractor Mandate must apply even to persons who have \nalready been infected with COVID-19, workplace locations that are outdoors, and \ncontractor employees who are working remotely full time.26  \n \ni.

Under  the  Task  Force  Directive,  a  “covered  contractor  employee”  required  to  be \nvaccinated is any full-time or part-time employee “working on or in connection with a covered \ncontract; or working at a covered contractor workplace.”28 The guidance defines employees \nworking “in connection with a covered contract” as employees “who perform duties necessary to \nthe performance of the covered contract, but who are not directly engaged in performing the specific \nwork called for by the covered contract.”29 This language suggests that an employee with even a \ntangential connection to a covered contract would fall under the scope of the mandate, even if that \nemployee works in an office far from the contract work location. \n53.  Moreover, because a “covered contractor workplace” includes any location controlled by \na covered contractor where a covered contract employee is likely to be present, entire contractor \noffices could be required to be vaccinated, even if only one employee has a tangential connection \nto a covered contract. At the same time, a “covered contractor workplace” does not include the \nresidence of an individual working on a covered contract, which leads to the result that an employee \nworking remotely who works “on or in connection with” a covered contract is required to be \nvaccinated, although a family member in the same household who works for the same contractor \n(but not on a covered contract) is not. These rules and their outcomes are nonsensical and \nconfusing. Contractors who seek to comply with their obligations are left with little choice but to \n \n27 Id. at 13. \n28  COVID-19  Workplace  Safety:  Guidance  for  Federal  Contractors  and  Subcontractors, \nSeptember  24,  2021,  available  at  \nhttps://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/downloads/Draft%20contractor%20guidance%20doc_20\n210922.pdf (emphasis added) (last visited Oct. 29, 2021).   \n29 Id.

On September 28, 2021, Defendant Shalanda Young, the Acting Director of the OMB, \npublished a notice in the Federal Register30 in which Ms. Young made the conclusory statement \nthat “compliance with COVID-19 related safety protocols improves economy and efficiency by \nreducing absenteeism and decreasing labor costs for contractors and subcontractors working on or \nin connection with a Federal Government contract.” 86 Fed. Reg. 53691, 53692. Ms. Young \nprovides she had “determined that compliance by Federal contractors and subcontractors with \nCOVID-19  workplace  safety  protocols  detailed  in  the  [Task  Force]  guidance  will  improve \neconomy and efficiency by reducing absenteeism and decreasing labor costs for contractors and \nsubcontractors working on or in connection with a Federal Government contract.” 86 Fed. Reg. \n53691, 53692. OMB’s determination is attached as Exhibit C.  \n55.  Ms. Young provided no evidence or citation supporting the claims in her determination. \nMs. Young’s notice was not subject to public comment. Furthermore, Ms. Young’s determination \ndid not claim there were any urgent and compelling circumstances in this case, and her Federal \nRegister notice did not include a 41 U.S.C. § 1707(d) waiver of the Procurement Policy Act \nrequirement that a procurement policy may not take effect until 60 days after it is published for \npublic comment in the Federal Register.  \n56.  In addition, neither the Task Force Directive nor Ms. Young’s Notice addressed a host of \ncritical issues that are inextricably intertwined with Defendants’ alleged mission of providing \nadequate health safeguards during the COVID-19 pandemic. Defendants, for example, have not \naddressed—much less reasonably explained—why natural immunity should not be considered an \n \n30 86 Fed. Reg. 53691, 53692 (Sept. 28, 2021).  \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     17 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 18 of 34\nadequate alternative to vaccination. Nor would it be possible to reasonably explain away this \nomission; by all indications, natural immunity confers superior resistance to COVID-19 than any \nof the currently available vaccines, and one in three Americans had COVID by the end of 2020. 31 \nDefendants also have not addressed—much less reasonably explained—why other best practices \nin fighting the spread of COVID-19 could not be used in lieu of vaccination mandates. Nor would \nit be possible to reasonably explain away this omission; for example, testing has the advantage of \nproviding relative certainty that an individual in the workplace is not infected with COVID-19, \nwhereas vaccination does not provide that guarantee. Defendants likewise have not addressed—\nmuch  less  reasonably  explained—what  accommodations  should  be  in  place  for  contractor \nemployees regarding individual preferences, healthcare needs, or religious beliefs. \nC.  FAR Council Directive. \n57.  On September 30, 2021, the FAR Council issued Class Deviation Clause 252.223–7999 \n(the “FAR Deviation Clause”) with an accompanying memorandum providing instructions to \nimplement EO 14042, attached hereto as Exhibit D.  \n58.  The FAR Council issued these instructions and Deviation Clause to all Chief Acquisition \nOfficers, Senior Procurement Officers, the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council, and the \nCivilian Agency Acquisition Council. The memorandum stipulated that one of the stated purposes \n \n31 See, e.g., Meredith Wadman, Having SARS-CoV-2 once confers much greater immunity than a \nvaccine—but vaccination remains vital: Israelis who had an infection were more protected against the \nDelta  coronavirus  variant  than  those  who  had  an  already  highly  effective  COVID-19  vaccine, \nhttps://www.science.org/content/article/having-sars-cov-2-once-confers-much-greater-\nimmunity-vaccine-vaccination-remains-vital (last visited Oct. 29, 2021); One in Three Americans \nAlready  Had  COVID-19  by  the  End  of  2020,  https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/public-\nhealth-now/news/one-three-americans-already-had-covid-19-end-2020  (last  visited  Oct.  29, \n2021).  \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     18 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 19 of 34\nof the FAR Deviation Clause and guidance, which was published the next day, was to “maximize \nthe goal of getting more people vaccinated and decrease the spread of Covid-19.”32 \n59.  The FAR Deviation Clause is to be inserted into covered contracts and subcontracts. The \nFAR Council also issued guidance to agencies regarding the implementation of the FAR Deviation \nClause. The Deviation Clause, when inserted into covered contracts and subcontracts, imposes \nthe Task Force’s requirements and also, when inserted, imposes the requirements listed on the \nTask Force’s Frequently Asked Questions website.  \nD.  The State of Texas’s Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. \n60.  Since March 2020, Texas government officials have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic \nwith a measured and deliberate approach specific to the needs of Texas and Texans. On March 19, \n2020, Governor Abbott announced the first of many Executive Orders to control and combat the \ngrowing number of COVID-19 cases. 33 Texas has consistently sought to create a uniform response \nto the pandemic in accordance with the State’s police power to protect public health and safety \nwhile also promoting and encouraging best practices to fight the spread of COVID-19.  \n61.  As was reported nationwide throughout 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases grew, \nwaned, and then grew again as summer approached, and Americans could no longer tolerate the \nrestrictive measures many government officials had imposed. Throughout the entirety of the \n \n32 September 30, 2021 Memorandum: Issuance of Agency Deviation to Implement Executive \nOrder  14042,  https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/FAR-Council-\nGuidance-on-Agency-Issuance-of-Deviations-to-Implement-EO-14042.pdf (last visited Oct. 28, \n2021).  \n33 The Governor’s Executive Orders have the force and effect of State law and have been one of \nthe State’s primary tools in the fight against and recovery from COVID-19. See, e.g., Tex. Gov’t \nCode § 418.012. \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     19 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 20 of 34\nCOVID-19 pandemic, Texas state government has exercised and sought to maintain its exclusive \nauthority over Texas’ response to and recovery from the pandemic.34  \n62.  In April 2021, Government Abbott issued Executive Order GA-39, which in part ensured \nthat medical autonomy was up to the individual Texan by providing that no governmental entity \ncan compel any individual to receive a COVID-19 vaccine administered under the emergency use \nauthorization.35 Recognizing that Federal Government overreach was impending and that the right \nto choose whether to take the vaccine would be stripped from all Texans in some form, Governor \nAbbott issued GA-40. Signed by Governor Abbott October 11, 2021, GA-40 further protects \npersonal liberty and autonomy and makes it illegal for any entity in Texas to compel receipt of a \nCOVID-19 vaccine by any individual, including an employee or a consumer, who objects to such \nvaccination “for any reason of personal conscience, based on a religious belief, or for medical \nreasons, including prior recovery from COVID-19.”36 GA-40 protects the rights of the individual \nTexan and prohibits any entity from compelling receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine by any individual \nwho objects for any reason.37  \n63.  Governor Abbott and the State of Texas have made it clear to Texans: the decision whether \nto receive a vaccine should be free from governmental control. In response, millions of Texans \nhave enthusiastically adopted best practices for public health and safety, including widespread \n \n34 Tex. Gov’t Code § 418.002(1), (3). \n35  GA-39  is  publicly  available  at  https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/EO-GA-\n39_prohibiting_vaccine_mandates_and_vaccine_passports_IMAGE_08-25-2021.pdf  (last \nvisited Oct. 29, 2021).  \n36  GA-40  is  publicly  available  at  https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/EO-GA-\n40_prohibiting_vaccine_mandates_legislative_action_IMAGE_10-11-2021.pdf  (last  visited \nOct. 29, 2021).  \n37 Supra, n.6. \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     20 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 21 of 34\nuptake of the COVID-19 vaccine. So far in Texas, over 34 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines \nhave been administered, over 61% of Texans have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 \nvaccine, and over 53% of the total Texan population eligible for vaccines are fully vaccinated.38 \nDespite Texas’s diversity and largely rural character, Texas ranks above many states in vaccination \nrates—all without any government vaccine mandate.39 \nE.  The Effect of Defendants’ Unlawful Vaccine Mandates on Texas. \n64.  The State of Texas contracts and subcontracts with the federal government as a matter of \ncourse. In the 2020-2021 fiscal year, the State of Texas, including governmental bodies of the State, \nmaintained a total potential value of prime contracts with the federal government in excess of $7.3 \nbillion.40 In the same 2020-2021 fiscal year, the State of Texas maintained a total potential value \nof sub-contracts with the federal government in excess of $20.3 million.41 The State of Texas \nexpects to continue to pursue government contracts in the future. However, if the State of Texas \ndoes not acquiesce to the federal government’s coercion, the State of Texas stands to lose over \n$7.32 billion in future contracts.42  \n65.  Additionally, the State of Texas faces an impending labor shortage as federal labor walk-\nouts and strikes continue to occur as a result of the federal vaccine mandates—potentially leading \nto significant, concrete financial harm to the State in the form of unemployment benefits and \n \n38 Texas Coronavirus Vaccination Progress, https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-\ntracker-states/state/texas (last visited Oct. 28, 2021).  \n39 See, e.g., U.S. COVID-19 vaccine tracker, Mayo Clinic, \nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/coronavirus-covid-19/vaccine-tracker (lasted visited Oct. 29, \n2021); COVID-19 Vaccinations in the United States, CDC, https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-\ntracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total (last visited Oct. 29, 2021). \n40 USA Spending, https://www.usaspending.gov/search (last visited Oct. 28, 2021) \n41 Id.  \n42 Id. \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     21 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 22 of 34\nincreased Medicaid expenses. Effects on the Texas labor force since the September 9, 2021 federal \nvaccine mandates include:  \na.

Organizations representing nursing homes in Texas, who accept both federal Medicare \nand Medicaid funding, came out with justifiable concerns that “singling out nursing \nhome staff for required vaccinations could exacerbate an already untenable workforce \nshortage.”44 \n \nc.  Texas Tech University, a public University in the State of Texas, stands to lose over \n$7 million from federal contracts if they do not adopt the contract amendments.

The Chief Executive of Raytheon Technologies, a defense-contractor with offices in \nDallas, Texas recently announced they expect to lose “several thousand people” due \nto the vaccine mandates.

Nationally, business groups representing millions of workers have warned of “mass \nlayoffs”  and  “catastrophic”  supply  chain  disruptions  caused  by  the  vaccine \nmandates.47  \n \ng.  In Amarillo, Texas, the community has protested Defendants’ vaccine mandate being \nenforced at a Bell Helicopter facility, where workers must be fully vaccinated before \nDecember 8 or face termination. Texans were quoted as saying that “[i]t’s our choice \nas to what medical treatments we want to have and it’s not the governments choice to \npush them upon us” and that “[a] lot of us here are willing to lose our jobs over this.”48 \n \n66.  These are just a handful of examples that demonstrate the harms that Defendants’ unlawful \nand coercive tactics are already having on the State of Texas and on its citizens, businesses, and \nagencies. Upon information and belief, other federal contractors within the State have been and \nwill continue to be targeted and threatened by various federal agencies if they refuse to abide by \nDefendants’ unilateral policy impositions.  \n67.  Defendants’ ability to threaten contract termination for any contractor who fails to comply \nleaves federal contractors with no ability to stand up for themselves. In the face of Defendants’ \nunlawful overreach, contractors face the same choice that they are forced to impose on their \nemployees: accept the unlawful conditions imposed by Defendants or risk the federal contracts that \nmay form the foundation of their businesses.  \n68.  Moreover, the threat of retribution exists for even daring to resist Defendants’ cozenage \nand ruthless tactics, chilling contractors’ ability to stand up for themselves in court. Because of the \n \n47 Business group warns of mass layoffs and ‘catastrophic’ supply chain disruptions from Biden \nvaccine  mandate,  https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/22/business/vaccine-supply-chain-\nbiden/index.html (last visited Oct. 29, 2021). \n48 Taylor Mitchell, “Amarillo Bell Helicopter employees hold peaceful protest regarding COVID-\n19  vaccine  mandate,”  KFDA  (Oct.  20,  2021),  available  at \nhttps://www.newschannel10.com/2021/10/21/amarillo-bell-helicopter-employees-hold-\npeaceful-protest-regarding-covid-19-vaccine-mandate/ (last visited Oct. 29, 2021). \n \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     23 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 24 of 34\nthreat of retribution, it makes no economic or logical sense for a federal contractor to challenge \nDefendants’ actions. Even if the contractor were to succeed in Court, it would still stand to \npermanently lose federal contracts and all associated sources of revenue. That is because the \nfederal government exercises substantial discretion when it awards contracts, and any contractor \nthat  sued  the  administration  over  this  politically  charged  issue—or  any  issue  of  political \nsignificance in the future, even under a different federal administration—would risk that discretion \nbeing used against it in future bidding for contracts. Accordingly, the State itself is also a voice for \nthe  countless  Texans  who  will  have  their  liberties—or  their  livelihoods—destroyed  by \nDefendants’ illegal actions. \nVI.  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \nCOUNT 1 \nUltra Vires Acts of the President  \n \n69.  The allegations in each of the preceding paragraphs are expressly incorporated herein as if \nrestated in full.  \n70.  The purpose of the Procurement Act is to provide the Federal Government with an \n“economical and efficient system” for, among other things, procuring and supplying property and \nnonpersonal services. 40 U.S.C. § 101. The Procurement Act permits the President to prescribe \ncertain policies and directives within the scope of the Act. 40 U.S.C. § 121. The President’s power \nunder the Procurement Act must be exercised consistently with the structure and purposes of the \nstatute that delegates that power—namely, efficiency and economy in procurement. \n71.  Executive Orders issued pursuant to the President’s authority under the Procurement Act \nare subject to judicial review. Reich, 74 F.3d at 1330. The President may only issue executive orders \nthat have a nexus to the purposes of the Procurement Act. When the President exceeds his \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     24 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 25 of 34\nauthority under the Procurement Act, the President acts ultra vires and the Executive Order may \nbe deemed unconstitutional.  \n72.  There is no articulable nexus between Executive Order 14042 or the Task Force Directive \nthe Executive Order required and the Procurement Act’s purpose of providing an “economical \nand efficient system” of procurement. 40 U.S.C. § 101. In fact the Contractor Mandate will have \na deleterious effect on economy and efficiency by causing large-scale resignations or layoffs of \nunvaccinated employees of federal contractors. A mandate requiring vaccination has no direct \nconnection to federal procurement and does not lie reasonably within the contemplation of the \nProcurement Act. \n73.  Defendant’s attempt to impose sweeping controls on one-fourth of the economy via \nprocurement is a question of deep economic and political significance, and Congress did not \nintend—nor does the Procurement Act allow—the President to exercise such sweeping authority \nunder the guise of “procurement” in the absence of clear and explicit congressional authorization. \nSuch arrogation of power violates the Major Questions Doctrine.  \n74.  The President has acted ultra vires in issuing EO 14042 and imposing the Contractor \nMandate. \nCOUNT 2 \nFailure to Conduct Notice and Comment \nViolation of the Procurement Policy Act \n(OMB Rule and Task Force Directive) \n \n75.  The allegations in each of the preceding paragraphs are expressly incorporated herein as if \nrestated in full.  \n76.  Under 41 U.S.C. § 1707(a)-(b), procurement “polic[ies], regulation[s], procedure[s], or \nform[s]” must go through notice and comment if it “relates to the expenditure of appropriated \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     25 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 26 of 34\nfunds” and either “has a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency \nissuing the policy, regulation, procedure, or form” or has “a significant cost or administrative \nimpact on contractors or offerors.”  \n77.  Both the Task Force Directive and the OMB Rule adopting the Task Force Directive are \nsubject to each of these requirements. No officer authorized to issue a procurement policy, \nregulation, or procedure invoked the waiver exception codified in 41 U.S.C. § 1707(d); see also id. \n§ 1707(e) (stipulating that a procurement policy for which the requirements of subsections (a) and \n(b) have been waived is only effective on a temporary basis and the agency must provide a 30-day \npublic comment period after it becomes effective). Indeed, the government’s failure to invoke the \nwaiver exception demonstrates that there exists no reason that the requirements of notice and \ncomment were impracticable.   \n78.  The OMB Rule and Task Force Directive were issued in violation of the procedural \nrequirements of the Policy Procurement Act. \nCOUNT 3 \nArbitrary and Capricious Agency Action \n(OMB Rule) \n \n79.  The allegations in each of the preceding paragraphs are expressly incorporated herein as if \nrestated in full.  \n80.  The OMB is an agency within the Executive Office of the President.  \n81.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “arbitrary \nand capricious.” See 5 U.S.C. § 706 (2)(A). “[A]gency action” is defined as “the whole or a part \nof an agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to \nact.” Id. § 551(13). An agency “rule” is defined as “the whole or a part of an agency statement of \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     26 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 27 of 34\ngeneral or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe \nlaw or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency.” \nId. § 551(4).  \n82.  An agency action is arbitrary or capricious if it fails to “articulate a satisfactory explanation \nfor its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.” Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). \n83.  The OMB Rule contains no explanation or reasoning at all. 86 Fed. Reg. at 53,691–92. \nMere executive fiat falls well short of the requirement of a “satisfactory explanation.” \n84.  The OMB Rule is arbitrary and capricious and must be set aside.  \nCOUNT 4 \nFAR Council Directive and Deviation Clause Exceeds  \nStatutory Authority and Is Not in Accordance with Law \n \n85.  The allegations in each of the preceding paragraphs are expressly incorporated herein as if \nrestated in full.  \n86.  While the FAR Council clams to be issuing only “guidance,” the guidance is being \n“applied . . . in a way that indicates it is binding.” Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d 433, 441 (5th Cir. \n2019). Therefore, the FAR Council Guidance is an agency action subject to judicial review under \nthe APA.  \n87.  Under  the  APA, a  court  must  “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law” or “in \nexcess of statutory . . . authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” See 5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)(A), (C).  \n88.  The FAR Council exists to promulgate procurement policy. 41 U.S.C. § 1302.  \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     27 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 28 of 34\n89.  The FAR Council Guidance admits that it is issued to further the goal of the Task Force \nDirective  and  Executive  Order,  namely,  to  “get[]  more  people  vaccinated.”  FAR  Council \nGuidance at 1, 3. There is no connection between this requirement and the legitimate procurement \npolicy objectives authorized by law. \n90.  The FAR Council did not act in accordance with the law and exceeded its statutory \nauthority when it issued the Guidance and Deviation Clause creating a government-wide policy \nmandating vaccines for contractors.  \nCOUNT 5 \nFailure to Conduct Notice and Comment \n(FAR Council Guidance and Deviation Clause) \n \n91.  The allegations in each of the preceding paragraphs are expressly incorporated herein as if \nrestated in full.  \n92.  As discussed in Count 2, 41 U.S.C § 1707(a)–(b) requires procurement “polic[ies], \nregulation[s], procedure[s], or form[s]” to go through notice and comment.  \n93.  While agencies are treating the FAR Council Guidance as binding, even if it were not \nbinding, 41 U.S.C. § 1707(a)–(b) requires policies to go through notice and comment.  \n94.  A FAR deviation is a procurement policy, regulation, procedure or from that requires \nnotice and comment.  \n95.  Because the FAR Council Deviation Clause was issued without notice and comment, it is \ninvalid and must be set aside.  \n \n \n \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     28 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 29 of 34\nCOUNT 6 \nCarnahan, Nelson, and Austin Acted Ultra Vires in Promulgating  \nthe FAR Guidance and Deviation Clause. \n \n96.  The allegations in each of the preceding paragraphs are expressly incorporated herein as if \nrestated in full.  \n97.  Under 41 U.S.C. §§ 1301–1303(a), the Administrator of General Services, the Secretary \nof Defense, and the Administrator of NASA constitute the FAR Council, and the FAR Council is \nauthorized to “jointly issue and maintain . . . a single Government-wide procurement regulation, \nto be known as the Federal Acquisition Regulation.”  \n98.  The  FAR  Council  is  charged  with  “manag[ing],  coordinat[ing],  control[ing],  and \nmonitor[ing] the maintenance of, issuance of, and changes in, the [FAR].” 41 U.S.C. § 1303(d).  \n99.  As discussed in Count 4, the FAR Council did not act in accordance with the law and \nexceeded its statutory authority when it issued the Guidance and Deviation Clause creating a \ngovernment-wide policy mandating vaccines for contractors. \n100.  Defendants Carnhan, Nelson, and Austin, as the Administrator of General Services, the \nSecretary of Defense, and the Administrator of NASA, respectively, acted ultra vires and exceeded \nthe scope of their statutory authority.  \nCOUNT 7 \nViolation of the U.S. Constitution, Art. I, §1 \nUnconstitutional Delegation of Legislative Power \n \n101.  The allegations in each of the preceding paragraphs are expressly incorporated herein as if \nrestated in full.  \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     29 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 30 of 34\n102.  Pursuant to Article I, § 1 of the U.S. Constitution, “[a]ll legislative powers herein granted \nshall be vested in a Congress of the United States.” Under Article I, § 1 only Congress may engage \nin lawmaking.  \n103.  “Congress is not permitted to abdicate or to transfer to others the essential legislative \nfunctions with which it is thus vested.” A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. \n495, 529–30 (1935). \n104.  The nondelegation doctrine bars Congress from transferring its legislative power to another \nbranch of Government. \n105.  While Congress may delegate power to executive agencies, the statutory delegation must \ninclude an intelligible principle to which the delegee “is directed to conform.” J.W. Hampton, Jr., \n& Co v. U.S., 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928).   \n106.  The nondelegation doctrine is based on the principle of preserving the separation of \npowers. \n107.  The President’s delegation in EO 14042 to the OMB Director and Task Force and indirect \ndelegation to the agencies of such broad authority and discretion is not supported by a statutory \ndirective within the Procurement Act or any other federal law. The precatory statement or purpose \nin the Procurement Act is not a clear directive, and the President cannot rely on it to impose an \nintrusive and sweeping vaccine mandate. \n108.  The President’s actions lack the requisite congressional direction to support such a broad \ndelegation of power for two reasons. First, Congress’ grant of authority to the President in the \nProcurement Act does not provide any basis that authorizes the President to implement a national \nvaccination mandate scheme by executive order. Second, even if 40 U.S.C. § 121(a) could be read \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     30 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 31 of 34\nin such a way as to show that Congress had clearly authorized the President to implement a national \nvaccination mandate for federal contractors, Congress did not articulate an intelligible principle \nauthorizing the President to delegate legislative judgment to the Task Force or the OMB Director. \n109.  Without explicit congressional authorization, the President’s delegation of power in the \nExecutive Order and through the OMB Determination and the Task Force is an unconstitutional \ndelegation of legislative authority which cannot survive constitutional scrutiny.   \nCOUNT 8 \nViolation of the U.S. Constitution \nUnconstitutional Exercise of the Spending Power \n \n110.  The allegations in each of the preceding paragraphs are expressly incorporated herein as if \nrestated in full.  \n111.  EO 14042, the OMB Rule, the Task Force Directive, and the FAR Council Guidance and \nDeviation Clause are unconstitutional conditions on the State’s receipt of federal funds.  \n112.  “[I]f Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so \nunambiguously,” so “States [can] exercise their choice knowingly.” Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. \nv. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981). The executive branch cannot impose conditions on spending \nthat the Constitution would prohibit it from imposing directly, because that authority belongs to \nCongress. See id. at 17.  \n113.  Federal contracts are an exercise of the Spending Clause, yet the challenged actions ask \nTexas to agree to an ambiguous contract term—specifically, agreeing to comply with uncertain \nTask Force Directive and FAR Guidance and Deviation Clause that were not issued in accordance \nwith the law. Moreover, the Contractor Mandate could not be imposed directly by Defendants in \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     31 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 32 of 34\naccordance with the Constitution, and therefore it cannot be imposed as a condition of federal \ncontracting and procurement regulation. \n114.  The Contractor Mandate exceeds the authority granted to the federal government by the \nconstitution. \nVII.  DECLARATORY JUDGMENT  \n \n115.  The allegations in each of the preceding paragraphs are expressly incorporated herein as if \nrestated in full.  \n116.  The federal Declaratory Judgment Act authorizes federal courts to declare the rights of \nlitigants. 28 U.S.C. § 2201. The issuance of a declaratory judgment can serve as the basis for an \ninjunction to give effect to the declaratory judgment. Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 461 n. 11 \n(1974).  \n117.  For the reasons described in each of the previous counts, Texas is entitled to a declaratory \njudgment that the Defendants are violating the law and the Contractor Mandate is unlawful, \nunconstitutional, and unenforceable.  \n   \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     32 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 33 of 34\nVIII.  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \n  For these reasons, Plaintiff State of Texas respectfully requests that the Court: \ni.  Hold unlawful and set aside the Executive Order, the OMB Rule, the FAR Council \nDirective and Deviation Clause, and the Task Force Directive.  \nii.  Issue declaratory relief declaring the Defendants’ actions unlawful. \niii.  Issue preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining Defendants from enforcing the \nExecutive Order, the OMB rule, the Task Force Directive, and the FAR Council Directive \nand Deviation Clause.  \niv.  Award Plaintiff costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.  \nv.  Award such other relief as the Court deems equitable and just.  \n   \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint     33 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed on 10/29/21 in TXSD   Page 34 of 34\nRespectfully submitted.     \n               \n            KEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \n \nBRENT WEBSTER \nFirst Assistant Attorney General \n \nGRANT DORFMAN \nDeputy First Assistant Attorney General \n \nSHAWN COWLES \nDeputy Attorney General for Civil \n  Litigation \n \nTHOMAS A.
