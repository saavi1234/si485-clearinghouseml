Nos. 18, 21. Plaintiffs seek defendants' production of the administrative record by December 23, 2021, arguing that the Court must review the record in order to decide whether the rule at issue is arbitrary and capricious. Dkt. No. 18. In opposition, defendants assert that the Court should resolve the motion for preliminary injunction before requiring production of the administrative record. Dkt. No. 21 at 1. Having considered both parties' arguments and the relevant law, the Court grants the motion in part. In compliance with the dictates of Section 706, binding precedent, and persuasive authority--and because the Court finds that the administrative record will prove helpful in resolving the parties' arguments--the Court will consider the administrative record. The Court recognizes, however, the expedited briefing schedule and accelerated timeline for resolution in light of the rules impending compliance and effective dates. Thus, Defendants shall file a copy of the administrative record for the Department of Health and Human Services' November 30, 2021 interim final rule, entitled \"Vaccine and Mask Requirements to Mitigate the Spread of COVID-19 in Head Start Programs\" on or before December 27, 2021 at 3:00 p.m. CDT.

    "summary": "<p>This case concerns a legal challenge to the vaccine and masking requirements imposed in the federal educational Head Start Programs. On November 30, 2021, an Interim Final Rule with Comment, 86 Fed. Reg. 68,052 was implemented effective immediately, requiring vaccination (and, if an individual has an exemption from vaccination, a requirement of weekly testing) and universal masking for all individuals over two years old at a Head Start facility, including staff and parents. Notice-and-comment procedure was waived due to cited imminent health concerns from the COVID-19 pandemic. On December 10, 2021, the state of Texas and Lubbock Independent School District in Texas filed suit in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas, Lubbock Division against the following parties: the Secretary of Health and Human Services; the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Administration for Children and Families; the Administration for Children and Families; Deputy Assistant Secretary for Early Childhood Development, Office of Early Childhood Development; the Office of Early Childhood Development; the Director of the Office of Head Start; the Office of Head Start; and the President of the United States. Plaintiffs argued that the mandates contravene the constitutional mandate of a federal government of limited powers as the Interim Final Rule expressly preempts contrary state and local laws, such as an executive order signed by the Governor of Texas prohibiting mandatory vaccination requirements, and were created and implemented outside of statutorily mandated notice-and-comment rulemaking. Plaintiffs alleged that the Interim Final Rule would commandeer Head Start employees to federalize state and local vaccine policies, impose implementation and enforcement costs on the state, and would infringe upon state sovereignty.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs therefore set out the following claims in their complaint: (1) The Interim Final Rule is not authorized by 2 U.S.C. &sect;9836(a)(1) and not justified by pre-existing rules, as plaintiffs argue the vaccine and mask mandates are neither interpretive rules nor informal interpretations of existing rules. (2) The Interim Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious under 5 U.S.C. &sect; 706(2)(A). (3) Defendants failed to comply with requisite notice-and-comment APA rulemaking requirements (5 U.S.C. &sect; 553), the Congressional Review Act (42 U.S.C. &sect;9836a(a)(2)), or the Treasury and General Appropriations Act of 1999 in promulgating the rule. (4) The Interim Final Rule constitutes an unconstitutional exercise of Spending Power. And (5) The Interim Final Rule violates the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine and the Tenth Amendment. In connection with these claims, plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, declaring defendants&rsquo; actions unlawful, and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to enjoin enforcement. The case was assigned to District Judge James Wesley Hendrix.</p>\r\n<p>On December 14, 2021, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, arguing that nationwide injunctive relief is warranted here because plaintiffs are likely to prevail on their claims that the vaccine and mask mandate are unlawful, and the mandates would cause irreparable harm.</p>\r\n<p>On December 31, 2021, the court granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for preliminary injunction, enjoining defendants from the implementation and enforcement of the Interim Final Rule in Texas pending trial on the merits. The court found persuasive the plaintiffs&rsquo; argument that the agency acted without proper prior authorization: The court held that the Head Start Act by its plain language did not authorize the power to create and implement vaccine and mask mandates like the ones here. Further, the court held that the rule was not created with proper notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, and that there was a substantial likelihood that, in its current form, the rule is arbitrary and capricious. Finding that plaintiffs also demonstrated standing and imminent injury arising from the rule, the court held it appropriate to grant a preliminary injunction &ndash; but, after reviewing Fifth Circuit precedent on the appropriate scope of injunctive relief, limited the scope of the injunction to Texas, instead of granting the nationwide injunction plaintiffs sought. Having granted injunctive relief, the court denied plaintiffs&rsquo; request for a temporary restraining order as moot.</p>\r\n<p>In January 2023, defendants filed with the court a Notice of Final Rule Addressing Masking Requirement. In that notice, defendants informed the court that the Final Rule had been published, and that it incorporated certain changes: It removed the universal masking requirement, and required Head Start Programs to take a flexible &ldquo;evidence-based COVID-19 migration policy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>On March 31, 2023, the court granted plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for summary judgment, and denied defendants&rsquo; motion to the same. The court held that its conclusions were drawn from the same reasoning it employed in deciding plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a preliminary injunction. While the court acknowledged that defendants had modified the Final Rule before publication, it noted that the Final Rule did not address the vaccination and testing requirement at issue in the suit. The court still held that the Head Start Act did not, by its statutory language, authorize the creation of a vaccination mandate like the one at issue here; that defendants failed to follow proper rulemaking procedures in creating the mandates; and that the rule was arbitrary and capricious. As a result, the court vacated the rule. With respect to plaintiffs' other pleas for relief, the court held it denied or otherwise did not reach any other relief requested.</p>\r\n<p>On May 26, 2023, defendants filed a notice of appeal to the Fifth Circuit. On February 2, 2024, a three-judge Fifth Circuit panel comprised of the Honorable Edith H. Jones, Stephen A. Higginson, and James C. Ho denied defendants&rsquo; motion to vacate the district court judgment in an unpublished order.</p>",

Plaintiffs bring this action to challenge Defendants’ Interim Final Rule with Comment, 86 \nFed. Reg. 68,052 (November 30, 2021), entitled “Vaccine and Mask Requirements To Mitigate \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  22  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  22\nthe Spread of COVID-19 in Head Start Programs” (hereinafter “Interim Final Rule”) (attached \nas Exhibit 1).  \n2.  The Interim Final Rule imposes an unprecedented Vaccine Mandate on Head Start staff, \nvolunteers, and  contractors  throughout the nation. It also imposes an unprecedented Mask \nMandate on children two years of age and older who attend Head Start, as well as any individual in \na Head Start facility—such as parents picking up or dropping off their children. \nA.   The Head Start Program \n3.  Head Start is a federal grant program that provides funding to school districts, nonprofits, \nand other community educational providers. Head Start programs promote the school readiness \nof infants, toddlers, and preschool-aged children from low-income families. Head Start Programs, \nOffice of Head Start (Nov. 3, 2020), https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ohs/about/head-start. \n4.  Head Start programs are available at no cost to children ages birth to 5 from low-income \nfamilies. Id. Families and children experiencing homelessness, and children in the foster care \nsystem are also eligible. Id. Preschool students whose attendance is funded via Head Start grant \nfunding are often in preschool classrooms with other students whose attendance is funded by either \nstate funds, district funds, or parent tuition. See Declaration of Lubbock ISD Superintendent Dr. \nKathy Rollo, attached as Exhibit 3. \n5.  Head Start programs deliver services through 1,600 agencies in local communities, and \nprovide services to more than a million children every year, in every U.S. state and territory. Id. \n6.  The purpose of Head Start is to “promote the school readiness of low-income children by \nenhancing their cognitive, social, and emotional development—(1) in a learning environment that \nsupports children’s growth in language, literacy, mathematics, science, social and emotional \n2 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  33  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  33\nfunctioning, creative arts, physical skills, and approaches to learning; and (2) through the provision \nto low-income children and their families of health, educational, nutritional, social, and other \nservices that are determined, based on family needs assessments, to be necessary.” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 9831. \n7.  The Office of Head Start provides grants to Head Start agencies in Texas and throughout \nthe country. Head Start programs are operated by several types of entities, including independent \nschool districts. Staff employed by Head Start programs are not federal employees. \n8.  According to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’ Tracking \nAccountability in Government Grants System website, HHS awarded a total of $842,280,184 in \ngrants to Texas Head Start programs in fiscal year 2021. Exhibit 2. \nB.   The Head Start Interim Final Rule \n9.  On November 30, 2021, after months of choosing to encourage Head Start employees and \nvolunteers to receive the COVID-19 vaccination, Defendants, at the direction of President Biden, \nmoved the goalposts and issued the Interim Final Rule, which contains a Vaccine Mandate and \nMask Mandate.1 \n10.  The Vaccine Mandate forces local Head Start programs, including the programs operated \nby Texas Tech University and the Lubbock Independent School District (“LISD”), to choose \nbetween either cancelling the program or forcing their staff, contractors, and volunteers to comply \n \n1 See, e.g., “Tips for Talking to Head Start Families and Staff About the COVID-19 Vaccines” \n(dated  March  24,  2021),  https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/publication/tips-talking-head-start-\nfamilies-staff-about-covid-19-vaccines. \n3 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  44  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  44\nwith an illegal federal mandate that violates their constitutional rights, while dealing with the \ninevitable fallout from the resulting resignations that will damage the program.2  \n11.  The Mask Mandate forces Americans with children in Head Start to choose between \ncomplying with the illegal mandate and allowing staff to force their children to wear masks, or \nwithdrawing their children from the program. As Defendants admit, enforcing the Mask Mandate \non toddlers will require frequent staff physical intervention: “It should be noted that like all new \nskills, children will need to be taught the proper way to put a mask on and keep a mask on. While \nchildren are adaptable, they are still in the early stages of development and may need reminders \nand reinforcements to comply with this new practice.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,060. Time spent \nreminding and reinforcing toddlers to wear masks is time away from enhancing their cognitive, \nsocial, and emotional development— to say nothing of the detrimental effect mask wearing has on \nthat very cognitive, social, and emotional development. Presumably, head start programs will have \nto discharge toddlers who are unable or unwilling to comply with the Mask Mandate from the \nprogram or risk their continued receipt of Head Start financial assistance.  \n \n2 Declaration of Lubbock ISD Superintendent Dr. Kathy Rollo, attached as Exhibit 3 (“If LISD \ncomplies with these new requirements, it has the potential for a mass exodus of Pre K staff.”); \nDeclaration of Vice Chancellor and General Counsel of the Texas Tech University System, Eric \nBentley, attached as Exhibit 4 (“Staff must be fully vaccinated by January 2022 to remain employed \nwith the Head Start program.”); see also Elisabeth Waldon, ‘What is on your radar?’ Gov. Whitmer \nmeets with Howard City leaders to hear their thoughts, concerns, The Daily News, Dec. 7, 2021, \nhttps://www.thedailynews.cc/articles/what-is-on-your-radar/  (Michigan  Governor  Gretchen \nWhitmer stating her opposition to vaccine mandates because “I know that if that mandate \nhappens, we’re going to lose state employees. That’s why I haven’t proposed a mandate at the \nstate level. Some states have. We have not, we’re waiting to see what happens in court”); Andrea \nJohnson, Head Start must close classrooms, fire staff due to federal COVID-19 vaccine mandate, Minot \nDaily News, Dec. 10, 2021, https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2021/12/head-\nstart-must-close-classrooms-fire-staff-due-to-federal-covid-19-vaccine-mandate/.  \n4 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  55  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  55\n12.  Moreover, the Mask Mandate requires anyone at a Head Start program—including parents \nvisiting, dropping their children off, or picking them up—to wear masks.  \n13.  The Vaccine Mandate applies even if an individual has natural immunity. \n14.  The Mask Mandates applies even if an individual has natural immunity or is vaccinated. \nC.   The Biden Administration’s Infringement on State Rights \n15.  The State of Texas and the LISD have sought to protect individual rights while also \nencouraging and promoting effective public health techniques to combat the spread of COVID-19. \nDisregarding Texas’s plan to stop the spread of COVID-19, the federal government, however, has \nlaunched a coordinated effort to decide for itself whether and when Americans must receive the \nvaccine. \n16.  Instead of deferring to the States’ expertise to address the specifics of their state needs and \nunique populations, President Biden has chosen to unlawfully take matters into his own hands. In \nfact, after months of saying the federal government could not mandate vaccines, President Biden \nannounced that his “patience was wearing thin” with Americans who choose not to receive the \nCOVID-19 vaccine.3 He even went so far as to single out Texas as an obstacle to be removed \nbecause of its stance in favor of individual liberty. Speaking about Texas Governor, Greg Abbott, \nPresident Biden threatened that “[i]f they’ll not help—if these governors won’t help us beat the \n \n3 Joseph Biden, Remarks by President Biden on Fighting the Covid-19 Pandemic (Sept. 9, 2021), \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/09/remarks-by-\npresident-biden-on-fighting-the-covid-19-pandemic-3/. \n5 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  66  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  66\npandemic, I’ll use my power as President to get them out of the way.”4 And yet, then-President-\nElect Biden previously vowed not to demand any mandatory vaccinations.5 \n17.  Our Constitution provides for a federal government of limited powers. The Constitution \ndoes not grant the federal government general police powers to dictate every facet of its citizens’ \nlives. Defendants’ disregard for the limits that the Constitution and federal statutes impose is \nnothing short of a dramatic infringement upon individual liberties, principles of federalism and \nseparation of powers, and the rule of law.  \nD.   The Interim Final Rule is Irrational \n18.  The decision to mandate vaccinations for all Head Start staff, contractors, and volunteers, \nand masks for all Head Start staff, contractors, volunteers, and children was uninformed, illogical, \nand without statutory authority. Congress never authorized Defendants (under the guise of \npromulgating “program performance standards”) to mandate vaccinations for Head Start staff, \ncontractors,  and  volunteers  or  masking  for  children,  their  parents,  staff,  contractors,  and \nvolunteers. \n19.  In their rush to push out the Vaccine Mandate and the Mask Mandate, and notwithstanding \nits lack of statutory authority, Defendants failed to follow the statutorily mandated notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking procedures. \n20.  In contrast to mandating vaccinations for Head Start staff and masks for children attending \nHead Start, the President has made no effort to mandate vaccinations or masking in our nation’s \n \n4 Id. \n5 Jacob Jarvis, Fact Check: Did Joe Biden Reject Idea of Mandatory Vaccines in December 2020?, \nNewsweek,  Sept.  10,  2021,  https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check-joe-biden-no-vaccines-\nmandatory-december-2020-1627774. \n6 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  77  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  77\nK through 12 schools, even though he claims, “We know how to keep students safe in schools by \ntaking the right steps to prevent transmission—including getting all staff and eligible students \nvaccinated, implementing universal indoor masking, maintaining physical distancing, improving \nventilation, and performing regular screening testing for students and school staff.”6 Instead, he \npasses the buck and tepidly “calls for Governors to require vaccinations for teachers and school \nstaff.”7 Under the Interim Final Rule, governors do not have the same option for Head Start staff \nin their states.  \n21.  President Biden does not even enforce his own vaccine mandate for federal employees. The \nmandate required all federal employees—even those who work from home—to be vaccinated by \nNovember 22, 2021. After that date passed, the federal government “updated” its “mandate” \nand allowed federal employees an unspecified additional amount of time to “demonstrate progress \ntowards becoming vaccinated.” And added an additional out by providing that the “Operational \nneeds of agencies and the circumstances affecting a particular employee may warrant departure \nfrom these guidelines if necessary.”8 Thus, the federal government does not enforce its vaccine \nmandate  against  its  own  employees,  yet  demands  that  Head  Start  staff,  contractors,  and \nvolunteers, who are not federal employees, be vaccinated or face termination. This is arbitrary and \ncapricious. \nE.   The Biden Administration’s Other Attempts to Mandate Vaccines have Failed \n22.  Defendants’ Head Start mandate is one of several mandates President Biden has attempted \nto impose on many Americans (but not federal employees). Defendants call these mandates \n \n6 https://www.whitehouse.gov/covidplan/ (last visited Dec. 5, 2021). \n7 Id. \n8 https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/faq/vaccinations/ (last visited Dec. 5, 2021). \n7 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  88  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  88\n“elements of a national strategy to combat COVID-19.” 86 Fed.

Other “elements” \nare OSHA’s vaccine mandate to employers with 100 or more employees, CMS’s vaccine mandate \nfor workers in most health care settings that receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement, and \nthe vaccine mandate for federal contractors. Federal courts have stayed all three of these other \n“elements” as exceeding statutory authority (and should stay the Head Start mandate too). \n23.  Even one American being forced by their government to receive a vaccine that they do not \nwant out of fear of losing their job is an irreparable injury and a stain on Defendants’ records. But \nthe broader implications of these unlawful vaccine mandates, if they are not stopped, portend a \ndark future for the economy and the American way of life. \n24.  Defendants’  Vaccine  Mandate  and  Mask  Mandate  for  Head  Start  is  unlawful,  and \nDefendants should be enjoined from implementing it. \nII.  PARTIES \n25.

LEGAL BACKGROUND \nA.  Statutes \n39.  Defendants assert that the Interim Final Rule is authorized “under the authority granted \nto the Secretary by … 42 U.S.C. 9836a(a)(1)(C)–(E)), (D) and (,) [sic],” 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,052, \nwhich it also refers to as “42 U.S.C. 9836a§ 9836a(a)(1)(C),(D), (E) [sic].” 86 Fed. Reg. at \n68,053. Plaintiff assumes that the asserted statutory authority is 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(C), (D) \nand (E). \n40.  But  Defendants  have  never  before  claimed  that  these  sections  authorize  the  federal \ngovernment to interpose itself between Head Start staff and their health care decisions, much less \nto mandate vaccination for all Head Start employees. Nor have Defendants ever claimed that those \nsections authorize it to direct children who attend Head Start to wear a mask or perform any similar \nactions in the name of health. \n41.  That is for good reason: Congress has never supplied the Secretary with such sweeping \nauthority. 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(C), (D), and (E) reads: \n(a)   Standards \n(1)  Content of standards \n  The Secretary shall modify, as necessary, program performance standards by \nregulation applicable to Head Start agencies and programs under this \nsubchapter, including— \n \n(C)  administrative and financial management standards; \n \n(D)  standards relating to the condition and location of facilities (including \nindoor air quality assessment standards, where appropriate) for such \nagencies, and programs, including regulations that require that the \nfacilities used by Head Start agencies (including Early Head Start \n10 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  1111  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  1111\nagencies and any delegate agencies) for regularly scheduled center-based \nand combination program option classroom activities— \n(i)  shall meet or exceed State and local requirements concerning \nlicensing for such facilities; and \n \n(ii)  shall be accessible by State and local authorities for purposes of \nmonitoring and ensuring compliance, unless State or local laws \nprohibit such access; and \n \n(E)  such other standards as the Secretary finds to be appropriate. \n42.  If a Head Start program fails to meet statutory or regulatory standards, the Secretary of \nHHS shall require the program to correct the deficiency within 90 days, or immediately if the \nSecretary finds that the deficiency threatens the health or safety of staff or program participants, \nand to initiate proceedings to terminate program unless the it corrects the deficiency. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 9836a(e). \n43.  42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(2) places limitations on how HHS may modify program performance \nstandards. It reads: \n(2)  Considerations regarding standards \nIn developing any modifications to standards required under paragraph (1), the \nSecretary shall— \n(A)  consult with experts in the fields of child development, early childhood \neducation, child health care, family services (including linguistically and \nculturally appropriate services to non-English speaking children and their \nfamilies), administration, and financial management, and with persons \nwith experience in the operation of Head Start programs; \n \n(B)  take into consideration— \n(i)  past  experience  with  use  of  the  standards  in  effect  under  this \nsubchapter on December 12, 2007; \n \n(ii)  changes  over  the  period  since  October  27,  1998,  in  the \ncircumstances and problems typically facing children and families \nserved by Head Start agencies; \n11 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  1122  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  1122\n \n(iii)  recommendations from the study on Developmental Outcomes and \nAssessments  for  Young  Children  by  the  National  Academy  of \nSciences, consistent with section 9844(j) of this title; \n \n(iv)  developments concerning research-based practices with respect to \nearly  childhood  education  and  development,  children  with \ndisabilities, homeless children, children in foster care, and family \nservices, and best practices with respect to program administration \nand financial management; \n \n(v)  projected needs of an expanding Head Start program; \n \n(vi)  guidelines and standards that promote child health services and \nphysical development, including participation in outdoor activity \nthat supports children’s motor development and overall health and \nnutrition; \n \n(vii) changes in the characteristics of the population of children who are \neligible to participate in Head Start programs, including country of \norigin, language background, and family structure of such children, \nand changes in the population and number of such children who are \nin foster care or are homeless children; \n \n(viii) mechanisms to ensure that children participating in Head Start \nprograms  make  a  successful  transition  to  the  schools  that  the \nchildren will be attending; \n \n(ix)  the  need  for  Head  Start  agencies  to  maintain  regular \ncommunications  with  parents,  including  conducting  periodic \nmeetings to discuss the progress of individual children in Head Start \nprograms; and \n \n(x)  the unique challenges faced by individual programs, including those \nprograms that are seasonal or short term and those programs that \nserve rural populations; \n \n(C) \n(i)  review and revise as necessary the standards in effect under this \nsubsection; and \n \n(ii)  ensure that any such revisions in the standards will not result in \nthe elimination of or any reduction in quality, scope, or types of \nhealth, educational, parental involvement, nutritional, social, or \n12 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  1133  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  1133\nother services required to be provided under such standards as in \neffect on December 12, 2007; and \n \n(D)  consult with Indian tribes, including Alaska Natives, experts in Indian, \nincluding Alaska Native, early childhood education and development, \nlinguists, and the National Indian Head Start Directors Association on the \nreview and promulgation of standards under paragraph (1) (including \nstandards for language acquisition and school readiness). \nB.  Regulations \n44.  Before November 30, 2021, Head Start rules (45 C.F.R. § 1302.93) governed staff health \nonly to the following limited extent: \n§ 1302.93 Staff health and wellness. \n(a)  A program must ensure each staff member has an initial health examination and a \nperiodic re-examination as recommended by their health care provider in accordance \nwith  state,  tribal,  or  local  requirements,  that  include  screeners  or  tests  for \ncommunicable diseases, as appropriate. The program must ensure staff do not, because \nof communicable diseases, pose a significant risk to the health or safety of others in the \nprogram  that  cannot  be  eliminated  or  reduced  by  reasonable  accommodation,  in \naccordance  with  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  and  section  504  of  the \nRehabilitation Act. \n \n(b)  A  program  must  make  mental  health  and  wellness  information  available  to  staff \nregarding  health  issues  that  may affect their job performance, and must provide \nregularly scheduled opportunities to learn about mental health, wellness, and health \neducation. \n45.  The Interim Final Rule adds paragraphs (a)(1) and (2): \n(1)  All staff, and those contractors whose activities involve contact with or providing \ndirect services to children and families, must be fully vaccinated for COVID-19, \nother than those employees: \n \n(i)  For whom a vaccine is medically contraindicated; \n \n(ii)  For whom medical necessity requires a delay in vaccination; or \n \n(iii)  Who are legally entitled to an accommodation with regard to the COVID-\n19 vaccination requirements based on an applicable Federal law. \n \n13 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  1144  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  1144\n(2)  Those granted an accommodation outlined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section \nmust undergo SARS-COV-2 testing for current infection at least weekly with \nthose who have negative test results to remain in the classroom or working \ndirectly with children. Those with positive test results must be immediately \nexcluded from the facility, so they are away from children and staff until they are \ndetermined to no longer be infectious. \n86 Fed. Reg. at 68,101. \n46.  The new paragraphs require staff and contractors to be vaccinated, and to get tested weekly \nif granted an accommodation against being vaccinated. No such requirement existed in the prior \nversion. \n47.  Before November 30, 2021, Head Start rules (45 C.F.R. § 1302.94(a)) governed volunteer \nhealth only to the following limited extent: \n(a)  A  program  must  ensure  regular  volunteers  have  been  screened  for  appropriate \ncommunicable diseases in accordance with state, tribal or local laws. In the absence of \nstate, tribal or local law, the Health Services Advisory Committee must be consulted \nregarding the need for such screenings. \n48.  But now the Interim Final Rule revises paragraph (a) to read as follows: \n(a)  A program must ensure volunteers have been screened for appropriate communicable \ndiseases in accordance with state, tribal or local laws. In the absence of state, tribal, or \nlocal law, the Health Services Advisory Committee must be consulted regarding the \nneed for such screenings. \n \n(1)  All volunteers in classrooms or working directly with children other than their \nown must be fully vaccinated for COVID-19, other than those volunteers: \n \n(i)  For whom a vaccine is medically contraindicated; \n \n(ii)  For whom medical necessity requires a delay in vaccination; or \n \n(iii)  Who are legally entitled to an accommodation with regard to the COVID-\n19 vaccination requirements based on an applicable Federal law. \n \n(2)  Those granted an accommodation outlined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section \nmust undergo SARS-CoV-2 testing for current infection at least weekly with \nthose who have negative test results to remain in the classroom or work directly \nwith children.

Reg. at 68,101. \n49.  The new paragraphs require volunteers to be vaccinated, and to get tested weekly if granted \nan accommodation against being vaccinated. No such requirement existed in the prior version. \n50.  Before November 30, 2021, Head Start rules (45 C.F.R. § 1302.47(b)(5)) governed child \nsafety only to the following limited extent: \n(5)  Safety practices. All staff and consultants follow appropriate practices to keep \nchildren safe during all activities, including, at a minimum: \n \n(i)  Reporting of suspected or known child abuse and neglect, including that \nstaff comply with applicable federal, state, local, and tribal laws; \n \n(ii)  Safe sleep practices, including ensuring that all sleeping arrangements for \nchildren under 18 months of age use firm mattresses or cots, as appropriate, \nand for children under 12 months, soft bedding materials or toys must not \nbe used; \n \n(iii)  Appropriate indoor and outdoor supervision of children at all times; \n \n(iv)  Only releasing children to an authorized adult, and; \n \n(v)  All standards of conduct described in § 1302.90(c).9 \n51.  The Interim Final Rule adds paragraph (b)(5)(vi) to read as follows: \n(vi)  Masking, using masks recommended by CDC, for all individuals 2 years of \nage or older when there are two or more individuals in a vehicle owned, \nleased, or arranged by the Head Start program; indoors in a setting when \nHead  Start  services  are  provided;  and  for  those  not  fully  vaccinated, \noutdoors in crowded settings or during activities that involve sustained close \ncontact with other people, except: \n \n(A)  Children or adults when they are either eating or drinking; \n \n \n9  45  C.F.R.  § 1302.90(c)  requires  staff,  consultants,  contractors,  and  volunteers  to  address \nappropriate  implement  positive  strategies  to  support  children’s  well-being  and  prevent  and \naddress challenging behavior and to not maltreat or endanger the health or safety of children. \n15 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  1166  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  1166\n(B)  Children when they are napping; \n \n(C)  When a person cannot wear a mask, or cannot safely wear a mask, \nbecause of a disability as defined by the Americans with Disabilities \nAct; or \n \n(D)  When  a  child’s  health  care  provider  advises  an  alternative  face \ncovering to accommodate the child’s special health care needs. \n86 Fed. Reg. at 68,101. \n52.  The new paragraph requires masking. No such requirement existed in the prior version. \n53.  Paragraph (vi) applies to all “individuals 2 years of age or older” who are “indoors in a \nsetting when Head Start services are provided” and “outdoors in crowded settings or during \nactivities that involve sustained close contact with other people” According to the Interim Final \nRule, “The Office of Head Start notes that being outdoors with children inherently includes \nsustained close contact for the purposes of caring for and supervising children.” 86 Fed. Reg. at \n68,060. Thus, the Mask Mandate appears to also apply to parents who enter a Head Start facility \n(either when dropping off or picking up their child or at any other time) and to parents are outside \nwith their children (either when dropping them off, picking them up, or at any other time), since \nbeing outside with children “inherently includes sustained close contact.” \nV.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n  The Biden Administration Response to COVID-19. \n54.  As Defendants acknowledge, the Administration for Children and Families “initially \nchose, among other actions, to allow Head Start programs to decide whether or not to require staff \nvaccination rather than require vaccination.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,054. \n55.  Similarly, before September 2021, the President’s consistent position had been that the \nfederal government lacks the authority Defendants are now claiming to possess. For example, on \n16 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  1177  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  1177\nJuly 23, 2021, the White House acknowledged that imposing vaccine mandates is “not the role of \nthe federal government; that is the role that institutions, private-sector entities, and others may \ntake …. [W]e’re going to continue to work in partnership to fight misinformation. And we’re going \nto continue to advocate and work in partnership with local officials and – and trusted voices to get \nthe word out.”10 Then President-Elect Biden made nearly identical comments in response to a \nquestion about whether COVID-19 vaccines should be made mandatory, stating: “[n]o, I don’t \nthink it should be mandatory. I wouldn’t demand it to be mandatory.”11 \n56.  But on September 9, 2021, everything changed. On that date, President Biden unveiled his \n“new  plan  to  require  more  Americans  to  be  vaccinated”  by  imposing  “new  vaccination \nrequirements.”12 One such mandate would “require all employers with 100 or more employees, \nthat together employ over 80 million workers, to ensure their workforces are fully vaccinated or \nshow a negative test at least once a week.”13 Another would “require vaccinations” of “those who \nwork in hospitals, home healthcare facilities, or other medical facilities—a total of 17 million \nhealthcare workers.”14 Two others would “require all executive branch federal employees to be \nvaccinated – all” and “require federal contractors to do the same.”15 And the final one—relevant \nhere—would “require all of nearly 300,000 educators in the federal paid program, Head Start \nprogram,” to get vaccinated.16 In total, President Biden’s vaccine mandates affect over 80 million \n \n10 Jen Psaki, White House Press Briefing (July 23, 2021), https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-\nroom/press-briefings/2021/07/23/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-july-23-2021/. \n11 Supra n.5.  \n12 Supra n.3. \n13 Id. \n14 Id. \n15 Id. \n16 Id.; see also Covid-19 and the Head Start Community, https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/about-\nus/coronavirus/vaccination-head-start-staff (last visited Dec. 5, 2021). \n17 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  1188  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  1188\nAmericans,  a  quarter  of  the  total  population  of  the  United  States,  and  one  in  three  adult \nAmericans.17  \n57.  Like President Biden, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and \nInfectious Diseases under the Biden Administration, has also changed its position on vaccine \nmandates. Last year, he held an entirely different position than now: “You don’t want to mandate \nand try and force anyone to take a vaccine. We’ve never done that.” He continued, “[A vaccine \nmandate] would be unenforceable and inappropriate.”18 But now, Dr. Fauci supports “many, \nmany more [vaccine] mandates.”19  \n58.  In line with this vaccine mandate flip flopping, on September 9, 2021, President Biden \nsuddenly reversed course and announced that all Head Start employees had to be vaccinated \nagainst COVID-19.20 \n59.  In relevant part, the announcement read, “To help ensure the safety of students, families, \nand their communities, the President’s plan includes requirements that teachers and staff at Head \nStart and Early Head Start programs … get vaccinated. The Department of Health and Human \nServices (HHS) will initiate rulemaking to implement this policy for Head Start and Early Head \nStart programs, which provide comprehensive education and child development services to ensure \nthat children are well prepared for kindergarten.”21 \n \n17 Id. \n18 Joel Saget, COVID-19 vaccine won’t be mandatory in US, says Fauci, Yahoo News, Aug. 19, 2020,  \nhttps://www.yahoo.com/now/covid-19-vaccine-wont-mandatory-194038185.html. \n19 Carolyn Crist, Fauci: ‘Many, Many’ More Vaccine Mandates Needed to End Pandemic, WebMD \nNews  Brief,  Sept.  13,  2021,  https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-\nvaccine/news/20210913/fauci-many-more-vaccine-mandates-needed-to-end-pandemic. \n20  https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ohs/news/biden-administration-requires-vaccination-head-start-\nstaff (last visited Dec. 9, 2021). \n21 Supra n.6. \n18 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  1199  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  1199\n60.  On November 30, 2021, HHS issued this challenged Interim Final Rule requiring that \nHead Start staff, contractors, and volunteers get vaccinated by January 31, 2022. \n61.  Although not announced ahead of time, the Interim Final Rule also immediately required \nuniversal masking of all individuals two years of age or older.22 \n62.  The specific new rules are discussed in the Legal Background section of this Complaint. \nB.  The State of Texas’s Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic \n63.  Since March 2020, Texas government officials have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic \nwith a measured and deliberate approach specific to the needs of Texas and Texans. On March 19, \n2020, Governor Abbott announced the first of many Executive Orders to control and combat the \ngrowing number of COVID-19 cases.23 Texas has consistently sought to create a uniform response \nto the pandemic in accordance with the State’s police power to protect public health and safety \nwhile also promoting and encouraging best practices to fight the spread of COVID-19.  \n64.  As was reported nationwide throughout 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases grew, \nwaned, and then grew again as summer approached, and Americans could no longer tolerate the \nrestrictive measures many government officials had imposed. Throughout the entirety of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, Texas has exercised and sought to maintain its exclusive authority over the \nState’s response to and recovery from the pandemic.24  \n65.  In April 2021, Governor Abbott issued Executive Order GA-39, which in part ensured that \nindividual medical autonomy was protected by providing that no governmental entity (including \n \n22 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,101. \n23 The Governor’s Executive Orders have the force and effect of State law and have been one of \nthe State’s primary tools in the fight against and recovery from COVID-19. See, e.g., Tex. Gov’t \nCode § 418.012. \n24 Tex. Gov’t Code § 418.002(1), (3). \n19 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  2200  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  2200\nthe LISD) could compel any individual to receive a COVID-19 vaccine administered under the \nemergency use authorization.25 Recognizing that federal government overreach was impending \nand that the right to choose whether to take the vaccine could be stripped from all Texans, \nGovernor Abbott issued GA-40 on October 11, 2021. GA-40 further protected personal liberty and \nautonomy and made it illegal for any entity in Texas (including the LISD) to compel receipt of a \nCOVID-19 vaccine by any individual, including an employee or a consumer, who objected to such \nvaccination “for any reason of personal conscience, based on a religious belief, or for medical \nreasons, including prior recovery from COVID-19.”26  \n66.  Governor Abbott and the State of Texas have made it clear to Texans: the decision whether \nto receive a vaccine should be free from governmental control. In response, millions of Texans \nhave enthusiastically adopted best practices for public health and safety, including widespread \nuptake of the COVID-19 vaccine. So far in Texas, over 66% of the total Texan population eligible \nfor vaccines are fully vaccinated.27 Despite Texas’s diversity and largely rural character, Texas \nranks above many states in vaccination rates—all without any government vaccine mandate.28 \n67.  Nonetheless, according to the Interim Final Rule,  \nState and local laws that forbid employers in the State or locality from imposing \nvaccine requirements on employees directly conflict with this exercise of our \nstatutory authority to protect the health and safety of Head Start participants and \n \n25 GA-39  is  publicly  available  at  https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/EO-GA-\n39_prohibiting_vaccine_mandates_and_vaccine_passports_IMAGE_08-25-2021.pdf  (last \nvisited Dec. 8, 2021).  \n26 GA-40  is  publicly  available  at  https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/EO-GA-\n40_prohibiting_vaccine_mandates_legislative_action_IMAGE_10-11-2021.pdf  (last  visited \nDec. 8, 2021).  \n27 Texas Coronavirus Vaccination Progress, https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-\ntracker-states/state/texas (last visited Dec. 8, 2021).  \n28 See, e.g.,  CDC COVID Data Tracker, https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view \n(last visited Dec. 8, 2021). \n20 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  2211  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  2211\ntheir families and ensure the continuation of services by requiring vaccinations for \nstaff, certain contractors, and volunteers and universal masking. As is relevant here, \nthis [Interim Final Rule] preempts the applicability of any State or local law \nproviding for exemptions to the extent such law provides broader grounds for \nexemptions than provided for by Federal law and are inconsistent with this [Interim \nFinal  Rule].  In  these  cases,  consistent  with  the  Supremacy  Clause  of  the \nConstitution, the agency intends that this rule preempts State and local laws to the \nextent the State and local laws conflict with this rule. \n \n 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,063. \nC.   LISD’s Response to the COVID-19 pandemic \n68.  LISD safely welcomed students back into its buildings for the 2020-2021 school year. In \nline  with  Governor  Abbott’s  Executive  Order  and  TEA  Public  Health  Guidance,  LISD \nimplemented a mask mandate for all staff and for students in 4th grade and above. While younger \nstudents had the option to wear masks, LISD did not require them for multiple reasons.29  \n69.  First and foremost, masks inhibit a young child’s ability to effectively learn language and \nsocial skills. Secondly, the management of enforcing a mask mandate with young children is \nchallenging in that young children are more apt to drop them, play with them, sneeze and cough in \nthem. Lastly, the science we read indicated that younger children were at far less risk of contracting \nCOVID-19 or getting extremely sick with COVID-19. Overall, LISD believed that the negative \neffects of wearing masks in Pre K through 3rd grades were far greater than what protection they \nprovided. While LISD’s mask mandate remained in effect for the entirety of the school year, at no \ntime did LISD require students below the 4th grade to wear masks.30 \n70.  As LISD prepared for the 2021-2022 school year, LISD determined that its stance would \nbe that masks are welcome, and vaccinations are encouraged. The word “welcome” with regard \n \n29 See Declaration of LISD Superintendent Dr. Kathy Rollo, Exhibit 3, ¶ 4. \n30 Id. \n21 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  2222  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  2222\nto masks was strategically selected because LISD wanted staff, students, and families to make the \ndecision that best met their needs.31 \n71.  LISD has encouraged vaccinations since they were first made available. LISD has achieved \na high rate of staff vaccination without a mandate. In an anonymous survey conducted in August \nbefore school started, 84% of LISD’s staff reported having received at least one vaccine dose.32 \nVI.  ARGUMENT \n  Plaintiffs are harmed by the Interim Final Rule. \n72.  The Vaccine Mandate and the Mask Mandate directly injure Texas and the LISD.  \n73.  Defendants are attempting to use the Head Start program as a lever to force Americans \nwho happen to work, contract, or volunteer at a Head Start program to receive unwanted medical \ntreatment, and to compel Americans to force their children to wear masks while attending Head \nStart, in violation of foundational principles of American law. \n74.  Texas and LISD citizens participate in the Head Start program as parents, faculty, staff, \ncontractors,  and  volunteers,  and,  most  importantly,  as  students  enrolled  in  the  program.33 \nPrograms operated by state and local governments are required to impose the Head Start Vaccine \nMandate on their employees to comply with the Interim Final Rule’s burdensome requirements.  \n75.  Head Start Programs at Texas schools have district employees who monitor compliance \nwith Head  Start program requirements. The Vaccine Mandate seeks to commandeer those \nemployees to become enforcers of Defendants’ unlawful attempt to federalize state and local \n \n31 Id. at ¶ 5. \n32 Id. at ¶ 6. \n33 See Declaration of Vice Chancellor and General Counsel of Texas Tech University System, Eric \nBentley, attached as Exhibit 4.  \n22 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  2233  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  2233\nvaccine  policies  and  override  Texas’s  police  power  on  matters  of  health  and  safety  while \nsimultaneously overriding the District’s policies by executive fiat.  \n76.  By requiring Head Start  programs and  Texas public schools  to enforce  the Vaccine \nMandate, both LISD and the State of Texas will face increased implementation and enforcement \ncosts.  \n77.  Further, by requiring Head Start programs and Texas public schools to enforce the Vaccine \nMandate, that mandate directly infringes Texas’s sovereign and quasi-sovereign authority.  \n78.  Texas is injured because the Head Start Vaccine Mandate purports to preempt its state and \nlocal laws on matters of vaccines and the rights of its citizens. This violates Texas’s “sovereign \ninterest in the power to create and enforce a legal code.” Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 153 \n(5th Cir. 2015) (quotation omitted). It also violates Texas’s sovereign right to exercise its police \npower on matters such as compulsory vaccination.  \n79.  The Governor of Texas has issued an executive order prohibiting mandatory vaccination \nrequirements by entities in Texas. Texas EO GA-40 (Oct. 11, 2021). However, the Vaccine \nMandate  purports  to  “preempt[]  the  applicability  of  any  State  or  local  law  providing  for \nexemptions to the extent such law provides broader grounds for exemptions than provided for by \nFederal law and are inconsistent with the Interim Final Rule. In these cases, purportedly under the \nSupremacy Clause of the Constitution, the agency intends that this rule preempts State and local \nlaws to the extent the State and local laws conflict with this rule.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,063. \n80.  Texas will suffer other pocketbook injuries. The Vaccine Mandate requires Head Start \nprograms and  participating  Texas  public schools  to maintain  documentation  of their staff’s \n23 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  2244  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244\nvaccination status, supply masks, and cover the costs of weekly COVID-19 testing. 86 Fed. Reg. \nat 68,601.  \n81.  Texas has a quasi-sovereign and parens patriae interest in protecting the rights of its citizens \nand vindicating them in court. Texas thus may sue to challenge unlawful actions that “affect the \n[States’] public at large.” In re Debs, 158 U.S. 561, 584 (1895).  \n82.  A natural and predictable consequence of the Vaccine Mandate is that numerous Head \nStart faculty, staff, contractors, and volunteers may be fired, retire, or quit. Texas Head Start \nprograms and state schools face the Catch-22 of program closures due to staffing shortages or \nclosure due to the loss of Head Start funding. The effect on smaller communities in Texas would \nbe devastating. A recent survey found that 86% of child care centers are facing staffing shortages.34 \nAccording to the  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics, 166,900 fewer people worked in child care in \nDecember 2020 than in December 2019, when the industry employed about 1,040,400 people.35 \nIn addition, a recent survey determined that four in five child care centers in the U.S. are \nunderstaffed.36 \n83.  In addition to staffing shortages generally, a reduction of staff may result in program \nclosures. There have already been examples of this in the U.S.37 \n \n34  State  Survey  Data:  Child  Care  at  a  Time  of  Progress  and  Peril,  Sept.  2021, \nhttps://www.naeyc.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/user-\n74/statedata_july2021_gf_092321.pdf. \n35 Child Care Industry Increasingly Fragile as Programs Face Staffing Challenges, Foundations for \nFamilies,  Dec.  7,  2021,  https://foundationsforfamilies.com/child-care-industry-increasingly-\nfragile-as-programs-face-staffing-challenges/. \n36 SURVEY: Four in five childcare centers in the U.S. are understaffed, NAEYC, July 27, 2021,  \nhttps://www.naeyc.org/about-us/news/press-releases/survey-childcare-centers-understaffed. \n37 See, e.g., Stephanie Ebbert, Child-care providers are facing a staffing crisis, forcing some to close with \nlittle  notice  to  parents,    Boston  Globe,  Aug.  17,  2021, \n \n24 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  2255  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  2255\n84.  Defendants acknowledge the harm that will result from this: “[P]rogram closures [] create \ninstability and stress for children and families. They disrupt children’s opportunities for learning, \nsocialization, nutrition, and continuity and routine.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,057. The program closures \nalso harm the low-income communities Head Start programs are intended to serve. Defendants \nalso acknowledge this harm: “Balancing working from home and supporting children was the \nnumber one challenge for parents” during the pandemic. Id. “This challenge was especially acute \nfor families with multiple children in different grade levels or with one child under the age of four \nyears.” Id. Defendants describe many more harms that it contends result from program closures \nin the Interim Final Rule, such as children missing out on nutritious meals. Id. \n85.  In addition to the already-existing staffing shortage, the Vaccine Mandate now threatens to \ncause further hardship to the Head Start Programs, particularly in rural communities. Mandating \nthat state-run programs terminate staff who refuse vaccination will lead to a reduction in healthcare \nservices. 38 If these programs lose even a few staff, services will be halted, and low-income families \nwill have to attempt to find another form of child care. Low-income communities simply do not \nhave enough affordable child care programs to replace those that are currently open.  \n86.  Texas is injured because the Vaccine Mandate discriminates between citizens of Texas who \nare vaccinated and those who are not by denying the latter employment opportunities available to \nthe former. Texas has a quasi-sovereign and parens patriae interests in protecting their citizens from \n \nhttps://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/08/17/metro/child-care-providers-are-facing-staffing-\ncrisis-forcing-some-close-with-little-notice-parents/. \n38 See, e.g., Chad Frey, Vaccine mandate affecting Newton Head Start staff, the Kansas, Nov. 9, 2021, \nhttps://www.thekansan.com/story/news/2021/11/09/head-start-staff-can-pursue-religious-\nada-based-exemptions-mandate/6345213001/ (“Sara Livesay, principal at Cooper, said the [head \nstart] program could not continue if the district fired staff that have voiced protests to vaccinations. \nMore than half of the licensed teaching staff has told her they will not get vaccinated.”). \n25 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  2266  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  2266\ndiscriminatory policies.

There is also the real concern of harm to the development to children participating in the \nTexas-based  Head  Start  programs,  including  emotional,  social,  speech,  and  other  areas  of \ndevelopment.39 \n88.  In addition, the rule identifies 38% of children as dual language learners, with a language \nother than English spoken in the home (sometimes in addition to English). 86 Fed.

Declaratory  relief  announcing  that  the  Head Start  Vaccine  Mandate  is  unlawful,  an \ninjunction enjoining its enforcement, and an order setting aside the Head Start Vaccine Mandate \nwill remedy these harms to Texas’s interests. \n  The Interim Final Rule lacks statutory authority. \n90.  The Interim Final Rule was issued by the Office of Head Start, the Administration for \nChildren and Families, and HHS. 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,052. The Office of Head Start is within the \nOffice of Early Child Development, which is in the Administration for Children and Families, \nwhich is in HHS. Those entities are federal agencies, or parts of federal agencies, subject to the \nrequirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. \n91.  Under the APA, courts must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “not in \naccordance with law” or “in excess of statutory . . . authority[] or limitations, or short of statutory \nright.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C). \ni.  Congress did not authorize Defendants to mandate vaccinations or masks. \n92.

Section 9836a authorizes the Secretary to regulate “program performance standards,” it \ndoes not authorize defendants to mandate an invasive, permanent medical treatment for or mask \nmandates for Head Start program children, staff, contractors, and volunteers. Notably, it does not \nmention vaccinations or masking requirements at all. \nii.  Defendants do not have limitless authority to regulate health and safety within \nHead Start programs. \n95.

Defendants’ assertion that their authority to set appropriate health and safety standards for \nthe conditions Head Start facilities grants them unfettered authority to generally regulate the \n“health and safety” of staff, contractors, volunteers, and students is unfounded. 86 Fed.

Defendants’ assertion of authority to issue a vaccine mandate under vague statutory \nlanguage generally referencing health and safety creates a “serious danger,” if allowed to stand, \nthat Defendants will “choose to broadly exert power in a variety of contexts.” Cf.

Just this year, the Supreme Court rejected the assertion by a federal agency of such broad \nauthority based on vague statutory language. The authority granted an agency by statute is not \nbased on vague language in isolation but is informed by the context in which that language appears. \nSee Alabama Ass’n of Realtors v.

Reading both sentences together, rather than the first in isolation, it is a stretch \nto maintain that § 361(a) gives the CDC the authority to impose this eviction moratorium.”). \n29 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  3300  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  3300\n101.  Section  9836a  authorizes  Defendants  to  implement  performance  standards,  but  that \nauthority is circumscribed by the statute’s context. \n102.  “Performance standards” is not defined in § 9836a. But “performance standards” is a \nplain and unambiguous term so the ordinary definition applies. Carcieri v. Salazar, 555 U.S. 379, \n387 (2009) (“This case requires us to apply settled principles of statutory construction under \nwhich we must first determine whether the statutory text is plain and unambiguous. If it is, we \nmust apply the according to its terms.”) (cleaned up). \n103.  Ordinarily, a  “performance standard” is a threshold criterion to measure quality or \nacceptability of a required or contractual action.41 \n104.  Here, the program performance standards are standards to measure a program’s quality \nand conditions in terms of administration, facilities, and education of the Head Start programs.  See \n42 U.S.C. § 9836a (discussing performance standards concerning “service provided,” “education \nperformance standards,” “administrative and financial management standards,” and “standards \nrelating to the condition and location of facilities”).  \n \n41  See STANDARD,  Black’s  Law  Dictionary  (11th  ed.  2019)  (“2. A  criterion  for  measuring \nacceptability, quality, or accuracy <the attorney was making a nice living — even by New York \nstandards>.  — standard, adj.”); PERFORMANCE,  Black’s  Law  Dictionary  (11th  ed.  2019) \n(“performance n. (16c) 1. The successful completion of a contractual duty”); see also Developing \nPerformance  Standards  (opm.gov)  https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/performance-\nmanagement/performance-management-cycle/planning/developing-performance-\nstandards/ (“A performance standard is a management-approved expression of the performance \nthreshold(s), requirement(s), or expectation(s) that must be met to be appraised at a particular \nlevel of performance.”); see, e.g., Salmon v. Soc. Sec. Admin., 663 F.3d 1378, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2011) \n(“Performance  standard  means  the  management-approved  expression of  the  performance \nthreshold(s), requirement(s), or expectation(s) that must be met to be appraised at a particular \nlevel of performance[.]”); Wilson v. Dep't of Health & Hum. Servs., 770 F.2d 1048, 1053 (Fed. Cir. \n1985)  (“A performance standard for  this  critical  element  defines  minimally acceptable \nperformance for this activity[.]”).  \n30 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  3311  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  3311\n105.  Further, this understanding of the term “performance standards” is supported by the \npurpose of the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110–134). The \nAct  is  intended  to  improve  the  current Head Start Program  by:  (1)  increasing  competition \namong Head Start providers; (2) improving the coordination of early childhood delivery systems; \n(3) requiring stronger educational and performance standards for Head Start teachers and staff; \nand (4) requiring financial accountability to ensure that all funds are being used properly to serve \nthe educational needs of the children. 2007 U.S.C.C.A.N. S17, 2007 WL 4984163 (Leg. Hist.). \n106.  Defendants’  authority  is  circumscribed  by  the  context  of  the  statute.  “Performance \nstandards” is not a term that authorizes unlimited wishes of Defendants. “Congress . . . does not \nalter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions—it does \nnot, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.” Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, \n468 (2001). These subsections relate to “program performance standards.” Although Defendants \nattempt to cram an elephant in a mousehole with this rule, authority to implement program \nperformance standards does not extend to mandating an invasive medical procedure or mask \nmandates. \n107.  Compare if the CDC—which (unlike Defendants) has authority to “make and enforce such \nregulations … necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable \ndiseases,” Alabama Ass’n of Realtors, 141 S. Ct. at 2487 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 264(a))—cannot \nissue an eviction moratorium to control the spread of communicable diseases, id. at 2489, then \nDefendants, lacking similar authority, cannot regulate the medical treatment of staff or other \nindividuals by mandating vaccinations. \n31 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  3322  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  3322\n108.  Defendants’ read of 42 U.S.C. § 9836a and vague reference in the Interim Final Rule to \nhealth and safety, “would give [Defendants] a breathtaking amount of authority.” Id. at 2489. “It \nis hard to see what measures this interpretation would place outside [Defendants’] reach, and the \nGovernment has identified no limit in [this authority] beyond the requirement that [Defendants’] \ndeem a measure ‘necessary.’” Id. at 2489. \n109.  Defendants’ assertion of such expansive authority under 42 U.S.C. § 9836a and vague \nreference in the Interim Final Rule to “health and safety,” is unprecedented, “not in accordance \nwith the law,” “in excess of [its] statutory . . . authority,” “in excess of statutory . . . limitations,” \nand “short of [its] statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C). \niii.  Defendants do not explain how the Vaccine Mandate and the Mask Mandate \nare authorized by section 9836a. \n110.  The 49-page Interim Final Rule does not explain or even mention how the amendments to \n45 C.F.R. §§ 1302.047 (Mask Mandate), .093 (Vaccine Mandate for staff), or .094 (Vaccine \nMandate for volunteers) might be justified as a program performance standard of any kind, let \nalone  a  program  performance  standard  that  is  also  an  administrative  standard,  a  financial \nmanagement standard, or a standard relating to the location of facilities. And the amendments are \nnot in fact any of those types of standards. \n111.  The Interim Final Rule contains one sentence which is seemingly intended to explain how \nthe amendments to 45 C.F.R. §§ 1302.047, .093, and .094 announced in the Interim Final Rule \nare a “standard relating to the condition … of facilities”: “The Secretary finds it necessary and \nappropriate to set health and safety standards for the condition of Head Start facilities that ensure \nthe reduction in transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 and to avoid severe illness, hospitalization, and \ndeath among program participants.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,054. But by its terms, this sentence refers \n32 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  3333  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  3333\nto “health and safety standards,” not to a “standard relating to the condition … of facilities.” \nMoreover, health and safety requirements for employees, volunteers, and children simply are not \nstandards about the condition of facilities. They are standards about the condition of people. \n112.  Thus, the amendments to 45 C.F.R. §§ 1302.047, .093, and .094 announced in the Interim \nFinal Rule are not administrative standards, financial management standards, or standards relating \nto the condition or location of facilities—and Defendants do not even claim that they are. Thus, \nthey are not in fact justified under 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(C) or (D). \n113.  The Interim Final Rule also does not explain or even mention how the amendments to 45 \nC.F.R. §§ 1302.047, .093, or .094 might be justified as an “other standard[] as the Secretary finds \nto be appropriate” under subsection (a)(1)(E). Subsection (a)(1)(E) cannot justify the Interim \nFinal  Rule—or  anything  else—because  it  violates  the  non-delegation  doctrine.  “The \nnondelegation doctrine bars Congress from transferring its legislative power to another branch of \nGovernment.” Gundy v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 2116, 2121 (2019). “[A] nondelegation inquiry \nalways begins (and often almost ends) with statutory interpretation. The constitutional question is \nwhether Congress has supplied an intelligible principle to guide the delegee’s use of discretion.” \nId. at 2123. Subsection (a)(1)(E) does not contain such an intelligible principle. “Appropriate” is \nnot an intelligible principle. Therefore, subsection (a)(1)(E) is unconstitutional and cannot justify \nthe Interim Final Rule. \n114.  If  Defendants’  logic  is  that  the  Vaccine  Mandate  and  the  Mask  Mandate  can  be \nimplemented because the Secretary can implement “other standards as the Secretary finds to be \nappropriate” under subsection (a)(1)(E), then the same logic would support the implementation \nof any “performance standard” Defendants might wish to impose on Head Start staff and children, \n33 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  3344  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  3344\nsuch as mandating flu vaccines or weekly RSV testing. This would be limitless, unguided authority \nin violation of the non-delegation doctrine. \n115.  In addition to specifically citing 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(C), (D), and (E), Defendants also \nclaim, “There are two primary reasons that [the Administration for Children and Families] \ndecided to mandate vaccination and mask use.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,066. The first asserted \n“primary reason” will be discussed in the next section. The second asserted “primary reason” for \nthe vaccine and mask mandate is: \nSecond, as discussed in this [Interim Final Rule], being fully vaccinated for COVID-\n19 and using a mask are two of the most effective mitigation strategies available to \nreduce  transmission  of  COVID-19  [citing  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and \nPrevention, “Science Brief: COVID-19 Vaccines and Vaccination,” September 15, \n2021].  With  this  in  mind,  [the  Administration  for  Children  and  Families] \ndetermined a federal requirement is necessary. While some agencies and localities \nhave  implemented  vaccine  and  masking  requirements,  many  have  not. \nAdditionally, vaccine uptake among Head Start staff has not been as robust as hoped \nfor and has been insufficient to protect the health and safety of children and families \nreceiving Head Start services. Combined, these factors leave certain children and \nfamilies with fewer mitigation strategies in place to protect them than others. It is \nACF's responsibility to make sure the environment is as safe as possible for Head \nStart programs uniformly across all 1,600 grant recipients. \n \n86 Fed. Reg. at 68,066. \n116.  This second “primary reason” is nothing but a naked assertion that something needs to be \ndone, without any effort to justify the mandate with any statutory authority. \n117.  Although it does not say so, perhaps this second “primary reason” is supposed to be \njustified by subsection (a)(1)(E) (“such other standards as the Secretary finds to be appropriate”). \nIf so, then it cannot stand because subsection (a)(1)(E) violates the non-delegation doctrine. \n34 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  3355  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  3355\n  iv.  Congress did not authorize the scope of authority claimed by Defendants. \n118.  A vaccine mandate is distinct from requiring performance standards. It is a mandate that \nstaff,  volunteers,  and  contractors  submit  to  a  specific  medical  treatment.  Likewise,  weekly \nCOVID-19  testing  and  mask  mandates  are  distinct  from  performance  standards.  These \nrequirements are not a measure of educational quality, or even of the quality of facilities from a \nhealth and safety standpoint. Further, although Defendants can implement performance standards \nconcerning the condition of Head Start facilities, conditions of facilities are separate and distinct \nfrom conditions of individuals. Likewise, it boggles the mind to comprehend how a performance \nstandard for an individual—a measure of meeting minimum thresholds of a required action, such \nas an employee duty in an employment contract—can stretch to include minimum medical \ntreatment requirements. \n119.  As stated above, the purpose of the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act is to \n(1) increase competition among Head Start providers; (2) improve the coordination of early \nchildhood delivery systems; (3) require stronger educational and performance standards for Head \nStart teachers and staff; and (4) require financial accountability to ensure that all funds are being \nused properly to serve the educational needs of the children.42 \n120.  This is reiterated in the purpose statement of the Act: \nIt is the purpose of this subchapter to promote the school readiness of low-income \nchildren by enhancing their cognitive, social, and emotional development-- \n \n(1)  in  a  learning  environment  that  supports  children's  growth  in  language, \nliteracy, mathematics, science, social and emotional functioning, creative arts, \nphysical skills, and approaches to learning; and \n \n \n42 2007 U.S.C.C.A.N. S17, 2007 WL 4984163 (Leg. Hist.). \n35 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  3366  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  3366\n(2)  through the provision to low-income children and their families of health, \neducational, nutritional, social, and other services that are determined, based \non family needs assessments, to be necessary. \n \n42 U.S.C. § 9831. \n121.  Nowhere in the Act are Defendants authorized to mandate an invasive, permanent medical \ntreatment for staff or any individuals or mandate mask-wearing and weekly COVID-19 testing. \nThese are all medical mandates, not performance standards. \n122.  The authority Defendants rely on to implement the Interim Final Rule does not grant \nDefendants the authority sought to exercise via the Vaccine Mandate and the Mask Mandate. \n123.  “[T]he  sheer  scope  of  [Defendants]  claimed  authority  …  would  counsel  against” \nDefendants’ broad view of their own authority. Ala. Ass’n of Realtors, 141 S. Ct. at 2489. The \nSupreme Court “expect[s] Congress to speak clearly when authorizing an agency to exercise \npowers of vast economic and political significance.” Id. (quotation marks omitted) (quoting Utility \nAir Regulatory Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014)). “That is exactly the kind of power that \n[Defendants] claim[] here.” Id.  \n124.  Defendants assert that under the Head Start Vaccine Mandate, they “anticipate that the \nrequirement that all Head Start staff get fully vaccinated for COVID–19 will induce a substantial \nportion of unvaccinated staff to get fully vaccinated.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,064. Defendants also \n“estimate that the regulation will induce a similar number, but smaller share, of unvaccinated Head \nStart volunteers to get fully vaccinated. Id. \n125.  Defendants estimate that over 820,000 staff, over 637,000 volunteers, and almost 2.6 \nmillion children will fall under the mandate. 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,077, 68,094. \n36 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  3377  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  3377\n126.  Defendants estimate that the costs associated with the Head Start Vaccine Mandates will \nbe up to $71.42 million in turnover costs alone. Id. at 68,092. This does not include any costs \ntraining new volunteers, finding new contractors, or opening a new program because another shut \ndown due to the mandate. \n127.  If Defendants can mandate medical treatment for 1.45 million individuals, 86 Fed. Reg. at \n68,094,  not  including  contractors,  it  “would  give  [Defendants]  a  breathtaking  amount  of \nauthority,”  and  “[i]t  is  hard  to  see  what  measures  this  interpretation  would  place  outside \n[Defendants’] reach.” Ala. Ass’n of Realtors, 141 S. Ct. at 2489.  \n128.  Defendants’ authority does not extend to exercising powers of vast economic and political \nsignificance without limit as it attempts with the Head Start Vaccine Mandate.  \n129.   “Congress . . . does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms \nor ancillary provisions—it does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.” Whitman, 531 \nU.S. at 468. \n* * * \n130.  There is no valid statutory authority for the Interim Final Rule. Defendants are not \nauthorized to mandate vaccinations for its staff and volunteers or the wearing of masks for its staff \nand volunteers or the children and family members while they are at Head Start facilities.  \n131.  The Court should set aside the Interim Final Rule. “The reviewing court shall hold \nunlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be … not in accordance \nwith law [or] in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory \nright.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C). \n37 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  3388  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  3388\n  The Interim Final Rule is not simply an extension of preexisting regulations. \n132.  The first asserted “primary reason” for the Interim Final Rule is:  \nFirst, Head Start programs have a broad set of program performance standards that \nalready include requirements for infection control, exclusion policies, cleaning, \nsanitizing and disinfecting. The requirement for staying home when sick is part of \n§ 1302.47(b)(4)(i)(A);  hand  hygiene  (handwashing)  is  included  at \n§ 1302.47(b)(6)(i); cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting is at § 1302.47(b)(2)(i); \nand physical distancing is part of § 1302.47(b)(4)(i)(A), which [the Office of Head \nStart] sees as a strategy for a program’s infection control practices) [sic]. In \naddition, § 1302.47(b)(1)(iii) states that facilities need to be ‘free from pollutants, \nhazards and toxins that are accessible to children and could endanger children’s \nsafety,’ though it is difficult be overly prescriptive about ventilation given the range \nof facilities and spaces used by center-based and family child care programs. \n \n86 Fed. Reg. at 68,066 (unmatched right parenthesis in original). \n133.  In other words, Defendants are asserting that rules in place before the Interim Final Rule \n“already include” various requirements, and those various requirements themselves justify the \nVaccine Mandate and the Mask Mandate. This assertion would be more appropriate for an \ninterpretive rule, or an informal interpretation of Defendants’ own regulations, neither of which \nmust be formally promulgated. But the Interim Final Rule is neither, so this assertion is pointless. \n134.  Moreover, Defendants’ characterizations of the rules relied upon in the first “primary \nreason” do not match the text of those rules. \n135.  45 C.F.R. § 1302.47(b)(4)(i)(A) states: “All staff with regular child contact have initial \norientation training within three months of hire and ongoing training in all state, local, tribal, \nfederal and program-developed health, safety and child care requirements to ensure the safety of \nchildren in their care; including, at a minimum, and as appropriate based on staff roles and ages of \nchildren they work with, training in [t]he prevention and control of infectious diseases.” Contrary \n38 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  3399  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  3399\nto Defendants’ assertion, this provision does not include “[t]he requirement for staying home \nwhen sick” or “physical distancing.” This is a staff training regulation. \n136.  45 C.F.R. § 1302.47(b)(6)(i) specifies: “All staff systematically and routinely implement \nhygiene practices that at a minimum ensure [a]ppropriate toileting, hand washing, and diapering \nprocedures are followed.” Contrary to Defendants’ assertion, this is not a general “hand hygiene \n(handwashing)” requirement, but instead refers to cleaning up after urination and defecation. \n137.  45 C.F.R. § 1302.47(b)(2)(i) reads: “Indoor and outdoor play equipment, cribs, cots, \nfeeding chairs, strollers, and other equipment used in the care of enrolled children, and as \napplicable, other equipment and materials meet standards set by the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission (CPSC) or the American Society for Testing and Materials, International (ASTM). \nAll equipment and materials must at a minimum [b]e clean and safe for children’s use and are \nappropriately disinfected.” Contrary to Defendants’ assertion, this provision is not a general \n“cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting” requirement, but only requires that equipment be kept \nclean. \n138.  45 C.F.R. § 1302.47(b)(1)(iii) reads: “All facilities where children are served, including \nareas for learning, playing, sleeping, toileting, and eating are, at a minimum [f]ree from pollutants, \nhazards  and  toxins  that  are  accessible  to  children  and  could  endanger  children’s  safety.” \nDefendants comment, “it is difficult be overly prescriptive about ventilation given the range of \nfacilities and spaces used by center-based and family child care programs.” This comment shows \nthat Defendants understand this requirement to concern “ventilation.” If Defendants are trying \nto justify the vaccine and mask mandate on a theory that ventilation at Head Start facilities is \nsomehow inadequate, that will not work. This rule requires that ventilation be adequate. It does \n39 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  4400  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  4400\nnot  allow  Head  Start  facilities  to  replace  inadequate  ventilation  with  vaccine  and  mask \nrequirements. Thus, contrary to Defendants’ assertion, this rule cannot support the vaccine and \nmask mandate. \n139.  In sum, Defendants’ assertion that “Head Start programs [already] have a broad set of \nprogram performance standards that already include requirements for infection control, exclusion \npolicies, cleaning, sanitizing and disinfecting” is such an exaggeration of its legal authority that it \nis simply false. \n140.  Similarly,  Defendants  also  claim,  “The  Head  Start  Program  Performance  Standards \nrequire children to be up to date on immunizations and their state’s Early and Periodic Screening, \nDiagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) schedule (45 CFR 1302.42(b)(1)(i)). When children are \nbehind on immunizations or other care, Head Start programs are required to ensure they get on a \nschedule to catch up.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,059. This is false. 45 C.F.R. § 1302.42(b)(1)(i) actually \nstates: \n(1)  Within 90 calendar days after the child first attends the program or, for the home-\nbased  program  option,  receives  a  home  visit,  with  the  exceptions  noted  in \nparagraph (b)(3) of this section, a program must: \n \n(i)  Obtain determinations from health care and oral health care professionals \nas to whether or not the child is up-to-date on a schedule of age appropriate \npreventive and primary medical and oral health care, based on: The well-\nchild visits and dental periodicity schedules as prescribed by the Early and \nPeriodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) program of the \nMedicaid  agency  of  the  state  in  which  they  operate,  immunization \nrecommendations  issued  by  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and \nPrevention, and any additional recommendations from the local Health \nServices  Advisory  Committee  that  are  based  on  prevalent  community \nhealth problems; \n \n(ii)  Assist parents with making arrangements to bring the child up-to-date as \nquickly as possible; and, if necessary, directly facilitate provision of health \n40 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  4411  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  4411\nservices to bring the child up-to-date with parent consent as described in \n§ 1302.41(b)(1). \n141.  Thus,  Head  Start  programs  are  required  to  find  out  if  children  are  up  to  date  on \n“immunization recommendations issued by the Centers for Disease Control” and must “assist \nparents with making arrangements to bring the child up-to-date as quickly as possible,” but only \nwith parental consent. This rule does not justify requiring children to wear masks without parental \nconsent. \n142.  Moreover, even if existing regulations really did already require that children be up to date \non vaccinations, that would neither justify the Vaccine Mandate for staff, and nor would it justify \nthe Mask Mandate for children, especially for children under five who are too young to be \nvaccinated. \n143.  Defendants build on this false claim by further claiming, “It is equally important [as the \nfalse requirement that children to be up to date on immunizations] that the Head Start program \nitself  is  safe  for  all  children,  families,  and  staff.  For  this  reason,  the  Head  Start  Program \nPerformance Standards specify that the program must ensure staff do not pose a significant risk of \ncommunicable disease (45 CFR 1302.93(a)).” In fact, that rule reads,  \nA program must ensure each staff member has an initial health examination and a \nperiodic  re-examination  as  recommended  by  their  health  care  provider  in \naccordance with state, tribal, or local requirements, that include screeners or tests \nfor communicable diseases, as appropriate. The program must ensure staff do not, \nbecause of communicable diseases, pose a significant risk to the health or safety of \nothers  in  the  program  that  cannot  be  eliminated  or  reduced  by  reasonable \naccommodation,  in  accordance  with  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  and \nsection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  \n \nThe rule thus refers to staff that already have a communicable disease that constitutes a disability, \nnot to staff that might temporarily be infected by an airborne virus at some unspecified time in the \n41 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  4422  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  4422\nfuture. This rule does not allow Head Start to require that its employees get vaccinated. It does not \njustify the Vaccine Mandate. \n144.  42 U.S.C. § 9842(a)–(b) reads:  \nEach recipient of financial assistance under this subchapter shall keep such records \nas the Secretary shall prescribe, including records which fully disclose the amount \nand disposition by such recipient of the proceeds of such financial assistance, the \ntotal cost of the project or undertaking in connection with which such financial \nassistance is given or used, the amount of that portion of the cost of the project or \nundertaking supplied by other sources, and such other records as will facilitate an \neffective audit. The Secretary . . . shall have access for the purpose of audit and \nexamination to any books, documents, papers, and records of the recipients that are \npertinent to the financial assistance received under this subchapter. \n \nDefendants cites to this as a basis for requiring that head start recipients collect and store records \nrelating to the vaccination status of staff and volunteers. However, as seen by the statute’s context, \nthese provisions only authorize Defendants to collect information pertinent to auditing the amount \nand disposition of the financial assistance received by a recipient. This does not authorize the \ncollection of medical records and documentation relating to the vaccination status of staff and \nvolunteers. Whether staff are vaccinated or not is irrelevant to the amount and disposition of \nfinancial assistance proceeds received by a recipient. \n145.  In short, the Interim Final Rule cannot be justified as merely an extension of already \nexisting  regulations.  And  extending  already  existing  regulations  is  not  authority  for  a  new \nregulation.  \n  The Interim Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious.  \n146.  “Normally, an agency rule would be arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on \nfactors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important \naspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence \nbefore the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the \n42 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  4433  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  4433\nproduct of agency expertise.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. \nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). \n147.  Defendants did not engage in reasoned decision-making, but instead acted arbitrarily and \ncapriciously, in issuing the Interim Final Rule. \n148.  Defendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously by enforcing a vaccine mandate against Head \nStart staff, while there is no such mandate for staff in K through 12 schools. That decision makes \nno sense. \n149.  Defendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously by enforcing a vaccine mandate against Head \nStart staff, while the federal government does not enforce the vaccine mandate against federal \nemployees. \n150.  Defendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously by ignoring or arbitrarily rejecting the adverse \neffects resulting from resignations of unvaccinated Head Start workers who do not want to be \nvaccinated, and the withdrawal of children from families who do not want to wear masks. \n151.  Defendants  acted  arbitrarily  and  capriciously  by  ignoring  or  arbitrarily  rejecting  the \ninterests of Head Start workers who—for any number of varying personal reasons—do not want \nto take one of the currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines. \n152.  Defendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously by refusing to provide a testing option for \nHead Start employees who decline to take one of the available COVID-19 vaccines. Defendants \nknow that OSHA provided this option in its recently struck down vaccine mandate for employers, \nbut nonsensically assert:  \nWhereas OSHA allows employers to offer an option for testing and face coverings, \nthis [Interim Final Rule] does not permit a testing and face coverings option for \nindividuals  without  an  approved  vaccine  exemption.  The  rationale  for  the \ndifference is that [the Administration for Children and Families] is acting under \n43 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  4444  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  4444\nstatutory and regulatory standards that are different from OSHA’s. In general, the \nHead Start Act requires standards for a safe environment for staff, children, and \nother participants. \n \n86 Fed. Reg. at 68,061. The second sentence proves too much. Of course, they are different. But \nDefendants do not explain why the differences justify differing rules. The third sentence falsely \nsuggests that Defendants have the general power to do anything they want in the name of “safe \nenvironments,” while simultaneously falsely suggesting that OSHA has no authority over safe \nenvironments for workers. \n153.  Defendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously by refusing to provide an exemption to \npersons with natural immunity to COVID-19 because natural immunity is at least as effective as \nvaccination in preventing re-infection, transmission, and severe health outcomes. \n154.  Defendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously by basing its decision to issue the Interim \nFinal Rule under a pretextual justification. See Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, \n2575 (2019) (setting aside agency action as arbitrary and when “the evidence tells a story that does \nnot match the explanation the Secretary gave for his decision” and “unlike a typical case in which \nan agency may have both stated and unstated reasons for a decision, here the [] rationale—the sole \nstated reason—seems to have been contrived.”). The true purpose of the vaccine and mask \nmandate was a political decision and an attempt to federalize public-health issues involving \nvaccination that belong within the States’ police power. According to Defendants,  \nThe Secretary consulted with experts in child health, including pediatricians, a \npediatric infectious disease specialist, and the recommendations of the CDC and \nFDA. The Secretary considered the Office of Head Start’s past experience with the \nlongstanding health and safety Head Start Program Performance Standards that \nhave sought to protect Head Start staff and participants from communicable and \ncontagious  diseases.  The  Secretary  also  considered  the  circumstances  and \nchallenges typically facing children and families served by Head Start agencies \nincluding the disproportionate effect of COVID-19 on low-income communities \n44 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  4455  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  4455\nserved by Head Start agencies and the potential for devastating consequences for \nchildren and families of program closures and service interruptions due to SARS-\nCoV-2 exposures. The Secretary finds it necessary and appropriate to set health \nand safety standards for the condition of Head Start facilities that ensure the \nreduction  in  transmission  of  the  SARS-CoV-2  and  to  avoid  severe  illness, \nhospitalization, and death among program participants. \n \n 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,054. All these supposed reasons are pretextual. The real reason for the Interim \nFinal Rule is because President Biden ordered it. “After the President voiced his displeasure with \nthe country’s vaccination ate in September, the Administration pored over the U.S. Code in search \nof authority, or a ‘work-around,’ for imposing a national vaccine mandate.” BST Holdings, L.L.C. \nv. Occupational Safety & Health Admin., United States Dep’t of Labor, 17 F.4th 604, 612 (5th Cir. \n2021). \n155.  Defendants  acted  arbitrarily  and  capriciously  because  their  finding  that  the  vaccine \nmandate is necessary was undermined by its delay in adopting it. Vaccines have been authorized \nfor almost a year, yet Defendants did not impose this mandate until two months after it was \ninstructed to do so by the President as part of his “six-point plan” to federalize public-health \npolicy. \n156.  The Interim Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious because it mandates that if COVID-19 \nexists in some communities, then all communities where Head Start operates must continue \nuniversal masking. Staff, volunteers, and students are required to wear masks even if there are no \nCOVID-19 cases in their community. Some Texas counties, such as McMullen, Kenedy, Sterling, \nand Borden, have not had a reported COVID-19 case in weeks or months.43 The CDC considers \nthese  counties  a  “low”  risk  of  community  transmission  of  COVID-19.44  The  CDC  only \n \n43 https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view (last accessed Dec. 8, 2021).  \n44 Id. \n45 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  4466  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  4466\nrecommends that “unvaccinated people” in these counties “should wear a mask in public, indoor \nsettings.”45 The one-size-fits all interim rule requires staff, volunteers, and students to continue \nmasking regardless of the recommendations by local health officials, and likely long after COVID-\n19 is no longer present in their communities. There is no end date or criteria for ending the \nuniversal mask mandate. So, as long as COVID-19 exists somewhere in the US, everyone in Head \nStart, regardless of where they are located, their vaccination status, and the conditions on the \nground, must continue universal masking.   \n157.  The Interim Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious because Defendants do not know how \nmany staff and volunteers are already vaccinated. This cannot be overstated.  \n158.  Defendants rely on a survey of 1,456 Head Start staff (out of the estimated 820,000 staff \nand volunteers impacted by the rule), and which included none of the one million volunteers, that \nwas  conducted  between  May  and  June  2021,  and  found  that  73%  of  head  start  staff  were \nvaccinated.46 The study did not specify whether the respondents were fully or partially vaccinated. \nCritically, the study concluded that “Overall vaccine uptake among US child care providers [] was \nsignificantly higher than that of the US general adult population (65%) at the time of the survey…. \nOf those reporting having not yet received the COVID-19 vaccine, another 11.9% stated that they \nwere ‘absolutely certain’ (5.0%) or ‘very likely’ (6.9%) to get vaccinated in the future, suggesting \n \n45 Id.; but, see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/k-12-\nguidance.html (last visited on Dec. 8, 2021) (CDC recommending universal masking in k-12 \nschools regardless of vaccination status). \n46 Kavin M. Patel, M.D., et. al., COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake Among US Child Care Providers, \nPediatrics,  Nov.  1,  2021, \nhttps://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/148/5/e2021053813/181547/COVID-19-\nVaccine-Uptake-Among-US-Child-Care.  \n46 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  4477  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  4477\nthat the final vaccine uptake among child care providers may settle around 90%.”47 The study \nassumed  this  vaccination  rate  would  be  achieved  voluntarily,  without  a  vaccine  mandate. \nDefendants  ignored  the  study’s  conclusion  and  chose  to  assume  that  all  of  the  Head  Start \nrespondents in the study were only partially, and not fully, vaccinated. Defendants admit that they \nhave no other data to rely on in determining how many staff and volunteers are currently \nvaccinated. Similarly, they have no goal to achieve a sufficient number of vaccinations to protect \nthe health and safety of staff and students, short of 100%. Yet, they cite to no data showing that a \nvaccination rate of 90%—or 80% or—70%—is not sufficient to protect the health and safety of the \nstaff and students.  \n159.  Instead, Defendants extrapolated the number from the study, which showed that Head \nStart staff were 12% more likely to get vaccinated than the general public. At the time the rule was \npublished, 83.5% of adults were partially vaccinated, and 71.6% of adults were fully vaccinated.48 If \nHead Start staff are 12% more likely to get vaccinated, then seemingly when the rule was published, \napproximately 93.7% of Head Start staff are partially vaccinated and 80.2% are fully vaccinated. \nDefendants cite to no data showing that this is not a sufficiently high enough vaccination rate to \nprotect students and staff. Instead, Defendants abruptly switch the modeling criteria by factoring \nin the percentage of adults likely to get vaccinated, whereupon they concluded that 77.9% of Head \nStart staff are currently vaccinated and this number will only rise to 79.8% by March 1, 2022, \nwithout regulatory action. There is no scientific basis for this conclusion.  \n \n47 Id.

Defendants are not tracking, and do not actually know, what the vaccination rate among \nHead Start staff and volunteers. Their reliance on a single survey of 1,456 staff from June 2021 is \nwholly insufficient to support a sweeping Vaccine Mandate. Even when relying on the survey, \nDefendants ignored the study’s conclusions that 90% of child care workers would voluntarily get \nvaccinated; instead, coming up with a wholly speculative and pretextual model to achieve their \ndesired outcome. Therefore, the rule is arbitrary and capricious because it is not rationally related \nto the evidence relied upon. \n161.  The Interim Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious because Defendants failed to consider \nconflicting evidence on masking children under 5 years of age. The World Health Organization \n(WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) specifically advise that “Children \naged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks. This is based on the safety and overall \ninterest of the child and the capacity to appropriately use a mask with minimal assistance.”49 \nDefendants wholly failed to consider contrary evidence, instead solely relying on the CDC’s \nrecommendations. \n162.  Defendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously by requiring that children ages two years old \nand older wear masks outdoors. Defendants failed to consider that outdoor transmissions are \nexceedingly rare.50 Many experts believe that outdoor masking is misguided.51 When masks are \n \n49  https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/q-a-children-and-masks-\nrelated-to-covid-19 (last visited Dec. 8, 2021). \n50 Tim O'Donnell, Is the CDC exaggerating the risk of outdoor COVID-19 transmission?, Yahoo \nNews,  May  11,  2021,  https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/cdc-exaggerating-risk-outdoor-\ncovid-135958591.html?soc_src=social-sh&soc_trk=ma. \n51 Vinay Prasad, M.D., M.P.H., The Downsides of Masking Young Students Are Real, the Atlantic, \nSept.  2,  2021,  https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/school-mask-mandates-\ndownside/619952/. \n48 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  4499  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  4499\nrequired in outdoor settings, kids may experience limitations in play, exercise tolerance, and \nsocialization. In Spain, children six years of age and older are required to wear a mask at school. A \nrecent study of students in the Catalonia region found that transmission rates were lower among \nunmasked three to five-year-olds compared to masked children over six.52 \n163.  Defendants cite no scientific evidence that children under five are better protected by \nmasking. The data it relies on all involved adults and older children.  \n164.  The Interim Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious because it failed to consider evidence \nthat doesn’t support masking children between the ages of two and five, and it is arbitrary and \ncapricious because it is not rationally related to the evidence relied upon that involved adults and \nolder children. \n165.  Defendants also acted arbitrarily and capriciously by repeatedly relying on CDC guidelines \nto  justify  the  Interim  Final  Rule53  because  CDC  Guidelines  are  merely  nonbinding \nrecommendations and have never otherwise been imposed on Head Start programs. \n166.  The  Mask  Mandate  is  arbitrary  and  capricious  because  Defendants  entirely  filed  to \nconsider an important aspect of the problem—namely, that many Head Start participants go to \nschool with children who are not in Head Start. Defendants acknowledge that the majority of its \nparticipants are from poor families and are disproportionately members of minority communities. \n86 Fed. Reg. at 68,055–56. The Mask Mandate essentially means the “poor kids” in Head Start \n \n52 Alonso, Sergio PhD, et. al., Age-dependency of the Propagation Rate of Coronavirus Disease 2019 \nInside School Bubble Groups in Catalonia, Spain, The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal, Nov. \n2021,  \nhttps://journals.lww.com/pidj/Fulltext/2021/11000/Age_dependency_of_the_Propagation_R\nate_of.2.aspx. \n53 See, e.g., 86 Fed.

The Mask Mandate is arbitrary and capricious \nbecause it failed to consider these psychosocial and developmental impacts. \n167.  The Mask Mandate is arbitrary and capricious because Defendants entirely failed to \nconsider an important aspect of the problem-namely,  the effectiveness of masking in preventing \nthe spread of COVID-19 when mixing masked and unmasked children. In Texas, students who are \nnot in Head Start are not required to wear a mask. Defendants failed to consider whether masking \nis an effective method of preventing the spread of COVID-19 when masked students are mixed \nunmasked students. \n168.  Defendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously by justifying the Mask Mandate with a study \nthat does not justify the Mask Mandate. According to the Interim Final Rule, a “study found that \nimplementing and monitoring adherence to recommended mitigation strategies, such as mask use, \ncan reduce risk for SARS-COV-2 transmission in Head Start settings. It also showed that Head \nStart and Early Head Start programs that successfully implemented CDC-recommended guidance \nfor childcare programs were able to continue offering safe in-person learning.” 86 Fed. Reg. at \n68,056. But the study says: \nMultiple strategies were implemented simultaneously, including training teachers and \nencouraging caretakers to adhere to SOPs and mitigation strategies; instituting flexible \nmedical leave policies for staff members; providing and requiring use of masks for all staff \nmembers and children; and supervising handwashing and hand-sanitizing for children \n(Box). Variations regarding methods for screening the health of staff members and \nchildren were noted; among these methods, self-administered temperature checks upon \narrival  were  most  frequently  reported  for  staff  members.  Screening  for  signs  and \nsymptoms of illness upon arrival was most frequently reported for children. Mask \npolicies for children varied, and exemptions for children aged <2 years and those with \nspecial health care and education needs were allowed. All programs reported increased \n50 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  5511  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  5511\ncleaning and disinfecting or sanitizing of high-traffic areas, high-touch surfaces, and toys. \nFive programs reported increasing cleaning and disinfecting of bedding and improving \nventilation. Guidance from public health or education agencies and state or local \nmandates were the factors most commonly reported to influence decisions about SOP \nadjustments.… The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations … study \noutcomes could not be attributed to implemented mitigation strategies.54 \n \nThis study fails to show that mask use “can reduce risk for [COVID-19] transmission in Head Start \nsettings because “[m]ask policies for children varied.” The most common strategy was screening \nfor signs of illness, not mask use. Yet the Interim Final Rule does not allow screening for signs of \nillness as an alternative to masking. \n169.  Defendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously by justifying the Mask Mandate with another \nstudy that does not justify the Mask Mandate. According to the Interim Final Rule, “[C]ounties \nwithout school mask requirements experienced larger increases in pediatric COVID-19 case rates \nafter the start of school compared to counties that had school mask requirements.” 86 Fed. Reg. \nat 86,056. It cites a study55 which said, “The findings in this report are subject to at least four \nlimitations. First, this was an ecologic study, and causation cannot be inferred. Second, pediatric \nCOVID-19 case counts and rates included all cases in children and adolescents aged <18 years; \nlater analyses will focus on cases in school-age children and adolescents. Third, county-level \nteacher vaccination rate and school testing data were not controlled for in the analyses; later \nanalyses will control for these covariates. Finally, because of the small sample size of counties \n \n54 Coronado F, Blough S, Bergeron D, et al., Implementing Mitigation Strategies in Early Care and \nEducation Settings for Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission — Eight States, September–October \n2020,  MMWR  Morb  Mortal  Wkly  Rep,  Dec.  11,  2020,  DOI: \nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6949e3 (emphasis added). \n55 Budzyn SE, Panaggio MJ, Parks SE, et al., Pediatric COVID-19 Cases in Counties With and \nWithout School Mask Requirements — United States, July 1–September 4, 2021, MMWR Morb \nMortal Wkly Rep 2021, Oct. 1, 2021, DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7039e3. \n51 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  5522  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  5522\nselected for the analysis, the findings might not be generalizable.” 86 Fed.

Even if Defendants were authorized by statute or prior rules to promulgate the Interim \nFinal Rule, which they are not, the Court would still have to set it aside for being arbitrary and \ncapricious. “The reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and \nconclusions found to be arbitrary, capricious [or] an abuse of discretion.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n  The  Interim  Final  Rule  was  adopted  in  violation  of  the  notice-and-comment \nrequirement.  \n171.  Defendants must comply with the notice-and-comment requirements of 5 U.S.C. § 553 \nbefore  promulgating  a  rule.  Subject  to  certain  statutory  exceptions  not  implicated  here,  a \n“[g]eneral notice of proposed rulemaking shall be published in the Federal Register.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 553(b). “After notice required by this section, the agency shall give interested persons an \nopportunity to participate in the rule making through submission of written data, views, or \narguments.” 5 U.S.C. § 553(c). “The required publication or service of a substantive rule shall be \nmade not less than 30 days before its effective date [with inapplicable exceptions].” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 553(d). \n172.  Notice-and-comment procedures do not apply “when the agency for good cause finds (and \nincorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefor in the rules issued) that notice \nand public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” \n5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3)(B). \n173.

E.P.A., 682 F.3d 87, 89 \n(D.C. Cir. 2012). \n174.  Defendants acknowledge that the Interim Final Rule is subject to notice-and-comment \nrequirements, but assert that \na combination of factors, including but not limited to failure to achieve sufficiently \nhigh levels of vaccination based on voluntary efforts and patchwork requirements, \npotential harm to children from unvaccinated staff, continuing strain on the health \ncare system, and known efficacy and safety of available vaccines, have persuaded us \nthat a vaccine requirement for Head Start staff, certain contractors, and volunteers \nis an essential component of the nation’s COVID-19 response. Further, it would \nendanger the health and safety of staff, children and families, and be contrary to the \npublic interest to delay imposing the vaccine mandate. Therefore, we believe it \nwould be impracticable and contrary to the public interest for us to undertake \nnormal notice and comment procedures and to thereby delay the effective date of \nthis  [Interim  Final  Rule].  We  find  good  cause  to  waive  notice  of  proposed \nrulemaking under the APA. \n86 Fed. Reg. at 68,059. \n175.  Defendants cannot show that notice and comment are impracticable and contrary to the \npublic interest when it waited 82 days from the announcement of the rule on September 9, 2021, \nuntil publishing the rule on November 30, 2021. Defendants waited longer to publish the rule \nwithout comment than if it had simply noticed the rule and allowed comment.  \n176.  The vaccines have been available for nearly a year, yet until this point, Defendants have \nsought only to “encourage” vaccination, presumably accepting that not all healthcare workers \nwould choose to be vaccinated. And even when President Biden announced in September that \nDefendants needed a vaccine mandate, Defendants still waited more than sixty days before taking \nthis emergency action. “Good cause cannot arise as a result of the agency’s own delay, because \notherwise, an agency unwilling to provide notice or an opportunity to comment could simply wait \n. . . raise up the ‘good cause’ banner and promulgate rules without following APA procedures.” \n53 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  5544  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  5544\nNat. Res. Def. Council v. NHTSA, 894 F.3d 95, 114-15 (2d Cir. 2018). As the Fifth Circuit recently \nobserved with respect to OSHA’s two-month delay in issuing its vaccine mandate, “The President \nannounced his intention to impose a national vaccine mandate on September 9, 2021. OSHA \nissued the Mandate nearly two months later, on November 5, 2021, and the Mandate itself \nprominently features yet another two-month delay. One could query how an ‘emergency’ could \nprompt such a ‘deliberate’ response. BST Holdings, 17 F.4th at 612 n.11 (citation omitted). \nAlthough delay is not conclusive, an agency’s failure to act promptly is “evidence that a situation \nis not a true emergency.” Asbestos Info. Ass’n/N. Am. v. Occupational Safety & Health Admin., 727 \nF.2d 415, 423 (5th Cir. 1984). \n177.  In addition, the notice-and-comment procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act are \ndesigned to assure due deliberation. Smiley v. Citibank (S. Dakota), N.A., 517 U.S. 735, 741 (1996). \nBy alleging that notice and comment are “impracticable and contrary to the public interest,” \nDefendants essentially say that, as of November 30, 2021, there is no need for further deliberation. \nDefendants would have us believe that the science became settled on that date. Millions of \nAmericans and many Head Start programs believe otherwise, as evidenced by the over 1,000 \ncomments that Defendants have already received (but not made available to the public for \nviewing). The “impracticable and contrary to the public interest” exceptions to notice-and-\ncomment requirements do not apply to this case. \n178.  If Defendants had the authority to order Head Start staff to get certain medical care, which \nthey do not, natural immunity is one obvious example of an issue that could have benefitted from \ndeliberation. Defendants have not addressed—much less reasonably explained—why natural \nimmunity should not be considered an adequate alternative to vaccination. Nor would it be possible \n54 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  5555  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  5555\nto reasonably explain away this omission; by all indications, natural immunity confers superior \nresistance to COVID-19 than any of the currently available vaccines, and one in three Americans \nhad COVID by the end of 2020.56 \n179.  Similarly, if Defendants really had the authority they claim, another obvious issue that \nshould be deliberated is testing and other best practices apart from vaccinations. Defendants have \nnot addressed—much less reasonably explained—why other best practices in fighting the spread \nof COVID-19 could not be used in lieu of vaccination mandates. Nor would it be possible to \nreasonably explain away this omission; for example, testing has the advantage of providing relative \ncertainty that an individual in the workplace is not infected with COVID-19, whereas vaccination \ndoes not provide that guarantee. \n180.  Because Defendants did not consider these and other issues, Defendants’ error in failing to \ncomply with notice-and-comment was not harmless. “[W]hen a party’s claims were considered, \neven if notice was inadequate, the challenging party may not have been prejudiced.” United States \nv. Johnson, 632 F.3d 912, 931 (5th Cir. 2011). The flipside is that when claims are not considered, \nas in this case, prejudice is assumed. “absence of prejudice “must be clear” before applying \nharmless error. Id. at 933. \n181.  Defendants accept comments until December 30, 2021. 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,052. But “[n]or \ndoes accepting post-promulgation comments excuse compliance with APA procedures. We have \n \n56 See, e.g., Meredith Wadman, Having SARS-CoV-2 once confers much greater immunity than a \nvaccine—but vaccination remains vital: Israelis who had an infection were more protected against the \nDelta coronavirus variant than those who had an already highly effective COVID-19 vaccine, Science, \nAug. 26, 2021, https://www.science.org/content/article/having-sars-cov-2-once-confers-much-\ngreater-immunity-vaccine-vaccination-remains-vital;  One  in  Three  Americans  Already  Had \nCOVID-19 by the End of 2020, (Aug. 26, 2021), https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/public-\nhealth-now/news/one-three-americans-already-had-covid-19-end-2020. \n55 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  5566  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  5566\npreviously found that parties will have a greater opportunity for influencing agency decision \nmaking if they participate at an early stage, when the agency is more likely to give real consideration \nto alternative ideas. If we allowed post-promulgation comments to suffice in this case, we would \nmake the provisions  of  § 553 virtually unenforceable.”  Johnson, 632 F.3d at  929 (citations \nomitted). \n182.  The importance of deliberation is evidenced by the number comments submitted in \nresponse to this rule. Currently, in just the week since the rule posted, there are over 1,200 public \ncomments. A critical aspect of rulemaking is both the public and the agency being able to review \nthe public comments submitted about the rule and its impact.  \n183.  At the time of filing, these public comments are not available for the public to view. The \nreason they are not publicly available is because Head Start has not released them to the Federal \nRegister to publish. This is highly unusual. Typically, public comments are immediately available \nto  view  online  on  the  Federal  Register  website.  Perhaps  Defendants  are  deliberately  being \nsecretive, or perhaps they are merely taking their time in posting the comments. In either case, the \npublic comments are critical to the court and public in assessing the Interim Final Rule and its \nimpact. The number of comments received by Head Start in just the first week (1,000) exceeds the \ntotal number of comments received by OSHA vaccine mandate (441 to date), and vastly exceeds \nthe rate of comments received on the federal contractor vaccine mandate (1,365 to date) and CMS \nvaccine mandate (1,501 to date), both of which took weeks to reach 1,000 comments. The number \nand rate of public comments demonstrates the level of public interest and illustrates the importance \nof going through the notice and comment period before enacting rules. \n56 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  5577  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  5577\n184.  Defendants did not, and could not, demonstrate “good cause” to justify its failure to \ncomply with its notice-and-comment obligations under the APA. \n185.  For all these reasons, Defendants’ promulgation of the Head Start Vaccine Mandate \nviolated APA procedural requirements, and the Head Start Vaccine Mandate should be held \nunlawful and set aside. \n186.  Even if Defendants were authorized by statute or prior rules to make the Interim Final Rule, \nwhich they are not, the Court would still have to set it aside for failure to comply with notice-and-\ncomment requirements in 5 U.S.C. § 553 without good cause. “The reviewing court shall hold \nunlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be without observance of \nprocedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n  The  Interim  Final  Rule  is  a  major  rule  that  was  adopted  in  violation  of  the \nCongressional Review Act. \n187.  “Before a rule can take effect, the Federal agency promulgating such rule shall submit to \neach House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General a report containing (i) a copy of the \nrule; (ii) a concise general statement relating to the rule, including whether it is a major rule; and \n(iii) the proposed effective date of the rule.” 5 U.S.C. § 801(a)(1). \n188.  A “major rule” cannot take effect until at least 60 days after Congress receives the report. \n5 U.S.C. § 801(a)(3). A “major rule” is a “rule that the Administrator of the Office of Information \nand Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget finds has resulted in or is likely to \nresult in an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or more.” 5 U.S.C. § 804(2). \n189.  Defendants acknowledge that “[t]he Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the \nOffice of Management and Budget has determined that this action is a major rule because it will \nhave an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,063. \n57 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  5588  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  5588\n190.  But “[n]otwithstanding section 801[,] any rule which an agency for good cause finds (and \nincorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefor in the rule issued) that notice and \npublic procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, shall \ntake effect at such time as the Federal agency promulgating the rule determines.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 808(2). \n191.  Defendants assert that they found \ngood cause to waive notice of proposed rulemaking under the APA, 5 U.S.C. \n552(d), 553(b)(B). For those same reasons [as found to exempt the Interim Final \nRule from notice-and-comment under the APA], . . . we find it is impracticable and \ncontrary to the public interest not to waive the delay in effective date of this [Interim \nFinal Rule] under the [Congressional Review Act]. Therefore, we find there is good \ncause to waive the [Congressional Review Act’s] delay in effective date pursuant to \n5 U.S.C. § 808(2). \n \n86 Fed. Reg. at 68,059. \n \n192.  For the same reasons that good cause does not exist to exempt the Interim Final Rule from \nnotice-and-comment requirements in the APA, good cause does not exist for Defendants to evoke \n5 U.S.C. § 808(2). \n193.  For the same reasons that skipping notice-and-comment rulemaking was not harmless \nerror, skipping Congressional review was also not harmless error. \n194.  Even if Defendants were authorized by statute or prior rules to make the Interim Final Rule, \nwhich they are not, the Court would still have to set it aside for failure to comply with the \nCongressional Review Act. “The reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(D). \n58 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  5599  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  5599\n  The Interim Final Rule was adopted in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(2). \n195.  According to the Interim Final Rule, the vaccine mandate and the mask mandate are \n“program performance standards” under 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1). As explained above, they are \nnot. But even if they were, 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(2)(A) requires that, in developing program \nperformance  standards,  the  Secretary  “shall  consult  with  experts  in  the  fields  of  child \ndevelopment, early childhood education, child health care, family services (including linguistically \nand  culturally  appropriate  services  to  non-English  speaking  children  and  their  families), \nadministration, and financial management, and with persons with experience in the operation of \nHead Start programs.” \n196.  According to the Interim Final Rule, Defendants did not do that. Instead, “[t]he Secretary \nconsulted with experts in child health, including pediatricians, a pediatric infectious disease \nspecialist, and the recommendations of the CDC and FDA.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,054. \n197.  Moreover, there is no way to evaluate Defendants’ consultations because the agency did \nnot say with whom they met, when they met, for how long, or what they discussed. \n198.  In addition, 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(2)(B) requires the Secretary to take into consideration \nten factors in developing program performance standards. According to the Interim Final Rule,  \n[t]he Secretary considered the Office of Head Start’s past experience with the \nlongstanding health and safety Head Start Program Performance Standards that \nhave sought to protect Head Start staff and participants from communicable and \ncontagious  diseases.  The  Secretary  also  considered  the  circumstances  and \nchallenges typically facing children and families served by Head Start agencies \nincluding the disproportionate effect of COVID-19 on low-income communities \nserved by Head Start agencies and the potential for devastating consequences for \nchildren and families of program closures and service interruptions due to SARS-\nCoV-2 exposures. \n \n59 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  6600  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  6600\nId. None of these factors that Defendants say they considered are factors that they must consider \nunder § 9836a(a)(2)(B). \n199.  For  instance,  § 9836a(a)(2)(B)(vi)  requires  Defendants  to  consider  “guidelines  and \nstandards that promote child health services and physical development, including participation in \noutdoor activity that supports children’s motor development and overall health and nutrition.” \nThe Interim Final Rule states, “The Office of Head Start notes that being outdoors with children \ninherently  includes  sustained  close  contact  for  the  purposes  of  caring  for  and  supervising \nchildren.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,060. Thus, children “participat[ing] in outdoor activity that supports \nchildren’s motor development” will be required to wear masks. Yet the Interim Final Rule does \nnot discuss how or whether wearing masks during “caring for and supervising children” will affect \nthe beneficial aspects of such activity, in violation of § 9836a(2)(B)(vi). \n200.  Subsection  (a)(2)(C)(2)  requires  Defendants  to  “ensure  that  [the]  revisions  in  the \n[program performance] standards will not result in the elimination of or any reduction in quality, \nscope, or types of health, educational, parental involvement, nutritional, social, or other services \nrequired to be provided under such standards as in effect on December 12, 2007.” No such analysis \nappears in the Interim Final Rule. \n201.  Subsection (a)(2)(D) requires Defendants to “consult with Indian tribes, including Alaska \nNatives, experts in Indian, including Alaska Native, early childhood education and development, \nlinguists,  and  the  National  Indian  Head  Start  Directors  Association  on  the  review  and \npromulgation of [program performance] standards.” The Interim Final Rule contains a “Tribal \nConsultation Statement” which states,  \n[The Administration for Children and Families] conducts an average of five tribal \nconsultations each year for tribes operating Head Start and Early Head Start. The \n60 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  6611  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  6611\nconsultations are held in four geographic areas across the country: Southwest, \nNorthwest, Midwest (Northern and Southern), and East. The consultations are \noften held in conjunction with other tribal meetings or conferences, to ensure the \nopportunity for most of the 150 tribes that operate Head Start and Early Head Start \nprograms  to  attend  and  voice  their  concerns  regarding  service  delivery.  We \ncomplete a report after each consultation, and then we compile a final report that \nsummarizes the consultations. We submit the report to the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services (the Secretary) at the end of the year. We invite public comment \non this [Interim Final Rule] if there are concerns specific to Native communities \nand programs. \n \n86 Fed. Reg. at 68,052. In other words, Defendants state only that they meet with Indians once a \nyear. But § 9836a(a)(2)(D) requires consultation with Indians before issuing program performance \nstandards, which the Interim Final Rule supposedly contains. It is not enough that Defendants have \nannual meetings with Indians. Defendants violated 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(2)(D). \n202.  Defendants’ multiple violations of § 9836a(a)(2) require the Interim Final Rule to be set \naside. “The  reviewing court shall  hold unlawful and set aside  agency action, findings, and \nconclusions found to be without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).  \n  The  Interim  Final  Rule  was  adopted  in  violation  of  the  Treasury  and  General \nGovernment Appropriations Act of 1999. \n203.  Defendants  admit  that  Section  654  of  the  Treasury  and  General  Government \nAppropriations Act of 1999) (codified at 5 U.S.C. § 601 note) requires them to determine whether \na policy or regulation may negatively affect family well-being. 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,062. \n204.  But they summarily dismiss the need for an impact assessment, reasoning “it is not \nnecessary to prepare a family policymaking assessment … because [the rule] will not have any \nimpact on the autonomy or integrity of the family as an institution.” Id. \n205.  First, the impact analysis is mandatory. Public Law 105-277, 5 U.S.C. § 601 note (“Before \nimplementing policies and regulations that may affect family well-being, each agency shall assess \nsuch actions[.]”) (emphasis added). Congress specifically required Defendants to include an \n61 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  6622  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  6622\nimpact analysis to assess any impact on family well-being. Id. Following Defendants’ logic used in \nthis Interim Final Rule, Defendants could subjectively determine that the analysis is not required \nas they see fit to conveniently circumvent the requirement. This directly undermines the statute \nand renders the impact analysis requirement moot. \n206.  Second,  an  impact  analysis  has  specific  requirements  that  agencies  must  meet.  For \nexample, the impact analysis \nmust assess such actions with respect to whether—(1) the action strengthens or erodes the \nstability or safety of the family and, particularly, the marital commitment;(2) the action \nstrengthens or erodes the authority and rights of parents in the education, nurture, and \nsupervision of their children; (3) the action helps the family perform its functions, or \nsubstitutes governmental activity for the function; (4) the action increases or decreases \ndisposable income or poverty of families and children; (5) the proposed benefits of the \naction justify the financial impact on the family; (6) the action may be carried out by State \nor local government or by the family; and (7) the action establishes an implicit or explicit \npolicy concerning the relationship between the behavior and personal responsibility of \nyouth, and the norms of society. \n5 U.S.C. § 601 note. In addition to the other requirements concerning the impact analysis, \nDefendants wholly and completely ignored this requirement.57 \n \n57 See also 5 U.S.C. § 601 note (“(d) Governmentwide family policy coordination and review.--(1) \nCertification and rationale.--With respect to each proposed policy or regulation that may affect \nfamily well-being, the head of each agency shall--(A) submit a written certification to the Director \nof the Office of Management and Budget and to Congress that such policy or regulation has been \nassessed in accordance with this section [this note]; and (B) provide an adequate rationale for \nimplementation of each policy or regulation that may negatively affect family well-being. (2) Office \nof Management and Budget.--The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall--(A) \nensure that policies and regulations proposed by agencies are implemented consistent with this \nsection; and (B) compile, index, and submit annually to the Congress the written certifications \nreceived pursuant to paragraph (1)(A). (3) Office of Policy Development.--The Office of Policy \nDevelopment shall--(A) assess proposed policies and regulations in accordance with this section \n[this note]; (B) provide evaluations of policies and regulations that may affect family well-being to \nthe Director of the Office of Management and Budget; and (C) advise the President on policy and \nregulatory actions that may be taken to strengthen the institutions of marriage and family in the \nUnited States.”). \n62 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  6633  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  6633\n207.  Third, Defendants limit the meaning of “family well-being” in contradiction to the actual \ntext. Assessment of “family well-being” is not defined as an assessment of the impact “on \nautonomy or integrity of the family as an institution.” Instead, it is an assessment of “family well-\nbeing” and requires Defendants to assess the statutorily require factors. \n208.  Defendants failed to comply with this procedural requirement. Under the APA, a court \nmust “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is found to be “not in accordance with law” \nor “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (D). \n  The Interim Final Rule is an unconstitutional exercise of the Spending Power. \n209.  If 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1) authorized Defendants to enforce the Vaccine Mandate and the \nMask Mandate, which it does not, then it would be an unconstitutional condition on the receipt of \nfederal funds.  \n210.  “[I]f Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so \nunambiguously,” so “States [can] exercise their choice knowingly.” Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. \nv. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981). The executive branch cannot impose conditions on spending \nthat the Constitution would prohibit it from imposing directly, because that authority belongs to \nCongress. See id. at 17. Only Congress can condition the receipt of federal funds.  \n211.  42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1) does not authorize, let alone unambiguously impose, the Vaccine \nMandate or the Mask Mandate. There is no nexus between grants to Head Start and vaccine and \nmask requirements. South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987). Thus, the Vaccine Mandate and \nthe Mask Mandate are not authorized under the Spending Clause. \n63 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  6644  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  6644\n  The Interim Final Rule violates the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine. \n212.  “[T]he Federal Government may not compel the States to implement, by legislation or \nexecutive action, federal regulatory programs.” Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 925 (1997). \n213.  Even if the Vaccine Mandate and the Mask Mandate were valid, which they are not, they \nwould unconstitutionally compel LISD and others, such as Texas Tech, to administer a federal \nregulatory program by forcing them to either fire their unvaccinated employees and fire and expel \nstaff and children who do not wear mask or risk their Head Start funding.58 \n214.  Forcing Head Start programs to comply with the Vaccine Mandate and the Mask Mandate \nunder threat of the loss of all funding is unconstitutionally coercive; it is a gun to the head that \ncompels Texas and other governmental entities such as LISD operating Head Start programs to \nparticipate against its will. See Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 580 (2012). \n215.  For all these reasons, the Interim Final Rule was adopted pursuant to an unconstitutional \nexercise of authority and must be held unlawful and set aside. \n  The Interim Final Rule violates the Tenth Amendment. \n216.  The structure of the U.S. Constitution and the text of the Tenth Amendment protect \nfederalism. \n217.  The powers not delegated by the Constitution to the federal government are reserved to \nthe States. \n218.  Through the Vaccine Mandate and the Mask Mandate, the federal government seeks to \nexercise power far beyond what was delegated to the federal government under the United States \nConstitution. \n \n58 See Exhibit 4.  \n64 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  6655  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  6655\n219.  The power to impose vaccine mandates and mask mandates, to the extent that any such \npower exists, is a power reserved to the States. \n220.  “[T]he police power of a state” includes, above all, the authority to adopt regulations \nseeking to “protect the public health,” including the topic of mandatory vaccination. Jacobson v. \nMassachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 24–25 (1905). These matters “do not ordinarily concern the national \ngovernment.” Id. at 38. \n221.  By interfering with the traditional balance of power between the States and the federal \ngovernment, Defendants violated the Tenth Amendment and structural principles of federalism. \n222.  For all these reasons, the Interim Final Rule was adopted pursuant to an unconstitutional \nexercise of authority and must be held unlawful and set aside. \nVII.  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n223.  Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each paragraph of this complaint in each following \ncourt. To the extent there is any perceived inconsistency, Plaintiffs expressly pleads each count in \nthe alternative. \nCOUNT 1 \nThe Interim Final Rule Exceeds Statutory Authority \nand Is Not in Accordance with Law \n224.  The Interim Final Rule is not authorized by 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1) or any other statute. \n225.   Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law” or “in \nexcess of statutory … authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” See 5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)(A), (C).  \n226.  Defendants did not act in accordance with the law and exceeded their statutory authority \nwhen they issued the interim final rule. \n65 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  6666  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  6666\n227.  The Court must set aside the Interim Final Rule. \nCOUNT 2 \nThe Interim Final Rule is Not a \nMere Extension of Previously Existing Rules \n228.  To the extent that Defendants claim they are authorized to promulgate the vaccine \nmandate or the mask mandate by the rules in place before Defendants adopted the Interim Final \nRule, they are incorrect. \n229.  The Vaccine Mandate and the Mask Mandate are neither interpretive rules nor merely \ninformal interpretations of Defendants’ own regulations. \n230.  The Interim Final Rule is not justified by pre-existing rules. \n231.  Under  the APA, a court  must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law” or “in \nexcess  of  statutory  …  authority,  or  limitations,  or  short  of  statutory  right.”  See  5  U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A), (C). \n232.  The Court must set aside the Interim Final Rule. \nCOUNT 3 \nArbitrary and Capricious Agency Action \n233.  For the reasons described above, the Interim Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious. \n234.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “arbitrary \nand capricious.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n235.  The Interim Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious and must be set aside. \nCOUNT 4 \nFailure to Conduct Notice and Comment \n236.  As  discussed  above,  Defendants  filed  to  comply  with  the  notice-and-comment \nrequirements of the APA in promulgating the Interim Final Rule. \n66 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  6677  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  6677\n237.  The Court must set aside the Interim Final Rule for failure to comply with notice-and-\ncomment requirements in 5 U.S.C. § 553. “The reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside \nagency action, findings, and conclusions found to be without observance of procedure required by \nlaw.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \nCOUNT 5 \nFailure to Comply with the Congressional Review Act \n238.  As discussed above, Defendants failed to comply with the Congressional Review Act in \npromulgating the Interim Final Rule. \n239.  The  Court  must  set  aside  the  Interim  Final  Rule  for  failure  to  comply  with  the \nCongressional Review Act. “The reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(D). \nCOUNT 6 \nFailure to Comply with 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(2) \n240.  As discussed above, Defendants failed to comply 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(2) in promulgating \nthe Interim Final Rule.  \n241.  The Court must set aside the Interim Final Rule for failure to comply with 42 U.S.C. \n§ 9836a(a)(2). “The reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and \nconclusions found to be without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \nCOUNT 7 \nFailure to Comply with the Treasury and \nGeneral Government Appropriations Act of 1999 \n242.  As  discussed  above,  Defendants  failed  to  comply  with  the  Treasury  and  General \nAppropriations Act of 1999 in promulgating the Interim Final Rule.  \n67 \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  11      FFiilleedd  1122//1100//2211        PPaaggee  6688  ooff  7711      PPaaggeeIIDD  6688\n243.

As discussed above, the Interim Final Rule is an unconstitutional exercise of Spending \nPower. \n245.  Under  the APA, a court  must  “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law” or “in \nexcess of statutory … authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” See 5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)(A), (C). \n246.  The Court must set aside the Interim Final Rule because it is an unconstitutional exercise \nof Spending Power. 5 U.S.C. § 706(A), (c). \nCOUNT 9 \nViolation of Anti-Commandeering Doctrine \n247.  As  discussed  above,  the  Interim  Final  Rule  unconstitutionally  violates  the  Anti-\nCommandeering Doctrine. \n248.

No. 5:21-CV-300-H \nXAVIER BECERRA, Secretary of Health   \nand Human Services, et al., \n \n  Defendants.   \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \nIn response to the President’s plan to increase COVID-19 vaccinations, the Department \nof Health and Human Services created two unprecedented conditions on funding for Head \nStart programs, which provide education-related services to needy children.  The agency’s Rule \nrequires Head Start staff to be vaccinated and near-universal masking of children and adults.   \nIt is undisputed that an agency cannot act without Congressional authorization.  Thus, \nthe question here is whether Congress authorized HHS to impose these requirements.  HHS \nclaims that the mandates are authorized as “program performance standards” related to: \n“administrative and financial management,” “the condition . . . of facilities,” or “such other \nstandards” the agency “finds to be appropriate.”  Texas and the Lubbock Independent School \nDistrict argue that the Act does not authorize such mandates, that irreparable injury would \nresult from them, that HHS failed to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act in \nadopting the conditions, and that the mandates violate various Constitutional doctrines.  They \nseek an injunction to bar the mandates’ enforcement.  Because the Court concludes that there \nis a substantial likelihood that the mandates do not fit within the Head Start Act’s authorizing \ntext, that HHS failed to follow the APA in promulgating the mandates, and that the mandates \nare arbitrary and capricious, the Court preliminarily enjoins their enforcement in Texas. \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  22  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244555544\n1.  Factual and Procedural Background \nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) offers grants to schools, \nnonprofits, and other local organizations to run Head Start programs.  Those programs \n“promote the school readiness of low-income children” by creating supportive learning \nenvironments and by providing health, educational, nutritional, social, and other services to \nyoung children and their families.  42 U.S.C. § 9831.  Many Head Start programs are \noperated through local school districts, like Lubbock Independent School District (LISD), in \nthe form of pre-K classes.  See, e.g., Dkt. No. 8-3 at 3.  Texas Tech operates an Early Head \nStart program, which is offered for children under age three.  Dkt. No. 8-4 at 2; see 42 \nU.S.C. § 9840a.  In 2021, HHS awarded $842,280,184 in grants to Texas Head Start \nprograms.  Dkt. No. 8-2 at 35.  LISD and Texas Tech University received a portion of this \nfunding.  Dkt. Nos. 8-2 at 2, 9, 10, 30; 8-3 at 3; 8-4 at 2.   \nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Office of Head Start (OHS) allowed \nlocal providers to adjust their services as necessary depending community conditions and \nneeds.  Dkt. Nos. 8-5 at 2-3; 27 at 4 (listing the OHS May 2021 guidance in the \nadministrative record); 86 Fed. Reg. 68,058 n.66 (citing the guidance in the interim final \nrule).  In its May 2021 guidance, the agency recognized that “[t]o date, OHS provided \nneeded flexibilities and guidance that allowed programs to adapt services based on the \nchanging health conditions in their communities.”  Dkt. No. 8-5 at 2.  As a result, some \nHead Start programs offered virtual and remote services, but “[m]any programs continued \nto provide in-person services for children and families throughout the COVID-19 \npandemic.”  Id.  OHS knew, however, that “virtual and remote services . . . are not an \nacceptable replacement for in-person comprehensive services.”  Id. at 3.  In fact, OHS \n– 2 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  33  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244555555\nreported that “[a]lmost one third of children served in Head Start programs before the \npandemic—approximately 250,000—have not received services to date.”  Id. at 4.  Thus, \nOHS’s May 2021 guidance instructed its in-person programs “to continue serving children \nin person, as local health conditions allow.”  Id. at 2.  OHS also made clear that the virtual \nprograms “are expected to move to in-person services, as local health conditions allow.”  Id. \nat 3.  According to the CDC, OHS’s flexible approach to early childhood education during \nthe pandemic was successful: “Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, Head Start and Early \nHead Start programs successfully implemented CDC-recommended mitigation strategies \nand applied other innovative approaches to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission among \nchildren, teachers, and other staff members by allowing maximum program flexibility and \nallocating financial and human resources.”1 \nIn the 2020–21 school year, LISD implemented a mask mandate in line with \nGovernor Abbott’s Executive Order and Texas Education Agency public-health guidance.  \nDkt. 39-4 at 3.  Masks were required for students in fourth grade and above.  Id.  In the \n2021–22 school year, however, LISD decided that masks would be welcome and \nvaccinations encouraged, but neither would be mandatory.  Id. at ¶ 5–6.  Before the school \nyear began, 84% of LISD’s staff reported having received at least one vaccine dose.  Id. at \n¶ 6.  Of 1,847 active cases since August 18, 2021, 26 were pre-K students and none were pre-\nK staff.

No. 29-9). \n \n– 3 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  44  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244555566\nOn September 9, 2021, the President announced “a new plan to require more \nAmericans to be vaccinated.”2  He said that “our patience is wearing thin” with the \nunvaccinated, and “we must increase vaccinations among the unvaccinated with new \nvaccination requirements.”  Id.  Those requirements would apply to employers with 100 or \nmore employees, healthcare workers, executive branch federal employees, and “all of nearly \n300,000 educators” in the Head Start program.  Id.  The President did not hide the fact that \nhis school-related mandate “takes on elected officials and states that are undermining you \nand these lifesaving actions.”  Id.  He said that “if these governors won’t help us beat the \npandemic, I’ll use my power as President to get them out of the way.”  Id. \nOn November 30, 2021, the Administration for Children and Families (ACF)—a \ndivision of HHS—issued an Interim Final Rule with Comment (Rule) imposing mask and \nCOVID-19 vaccine mandates in Head Start programs.  See Vaccine and Mask Requirements \nto Mitigate the Spread of COVID-19 in Head Start Programs, 86 Fed. Reg. 68,052 (Nov. 30, \n2021) (to be codified at 45 C.F.R. pt. 1302).  As its name suggests, the Rule’s purpose is “to \nprotect the health and safety of Head Start staff, children, and families and to mitigate the \nspread of SARS–CoV–2 in Head Start programs.”  Id. at 68,053. \nACF promulgated the Rule by adding the mandates to existing “Head Start Program \nPerformance Standards.”  Id. at 68,052.  Specifically, the Rule requires “universal masking \n \n2 Joseph Biden, Remarks by President Biden on Fighting the COVID-19 Pandemic (Sept. 9, 2021), \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/09/remarks-by-\npresident-biden-on-fighting-the-covid-19-pandemic-3/ [https://perma.cc/VW2F-3Z47]. \n \n– 4 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  55  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244555577\nfor all individuals aged 2 years and older,” with limited exceptions,3 in all indoor settings \nwhere Head Start services are provided and in Head Start vehicles.  Id. at 68,060.  And “for \nthose not fully vaccinated,” masks are required “outdoors in crowded settings or during \nactivities that involve sustained close contact with other people.”  Id.  For purposes of the \nRule, “being outdoors with children inherently includes sustained close contact for the \npurposes of caring for and supervising children.”  Id. \nThe Rule also requires “all Head Start staff, certain contractors, and volunteers in \nclassrooms or working directly with children to be fully vaccinated,” with certain \nexemptions.4  Id.  For those granted an exemption from the vaccine requirement, weekly \nCOVID-19 testing is required.  Id. at 68,061. \nThe Rule took effect immediately—November 30, 2021—before public notice-and-\ncomment procedures were followed.  Given the threat posed by rising COVID-19 cases and \nthe hope to return fully to in-person instruction in 2022, the Secretary found that there was \n“good cause” to waive the notice-and-comment procedures normally required when an \nagency promulgates a regulation.  See id. at 68,059 (finding good cause to waive notice-and-\ncomment procedures).  The mask requirement was effective immediately, while the vaccine \nmandate requires compliance by January 31, 2022.  Id. at 68,060–62.  Under the Rule, \n \n3 “Exceptions are noted for when individuals are eating or drinking; for children when they are \nnapping; for the narrow subset of persons who cannot wear a mask, or cannot safely wear a mask, \nbecause of a disability as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), consistent with \nCDC guidance on disability exemptions; and for children with special health care needs.”  86 Fed. \nReg. at 68,060 (footnotes omitted). \n4 Exemptions are available “for those (i) for whom a vaccine is medically contraindicated, (ii) for \nwhom medical necessity requires a delay in vaccination, or (iii) who are legally entitled to an \naccommodation with regard to the COVID–19 vaccination requirement based on an applicable \nFederal law.”  Id. at 68,061 (footnotes omitted).  Accommodations based on federal law may be \ngranted for “a disability under the ADA, medical condition, or sincerely held religious beliefs, \npractice, or observance.”  Id. \n– 5 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  66  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244555588\nindividuals are deemed “fully vaccinated” two weeks after receiving the second dose in a \ntwo-dose series (i.e. Moderna and Pfizer) or a single-dose vaccine (i.e. Johnson & Johnson).  \nId. at 68,060.  But, to allow flexibility, staff and volunteers who have received their final \ndose of a COVID-19 vaccine by January 31, 2022 are “considered to have met the \nvaccination requirement, even if they have not yet completed the 14-day waiting period.”  \nId. at 68,062.  Because the Moderna vaccine requires four weeks in between doses, an \nunvaccinated person who intends to comply with the Rule by receiving the Moderna \nvaccine must receive his or her first dose by January 3, 2022.  Programs that refuse to \nimplement the Rule’s dual mandates risk losing their Head Start funding entirely.  See 42 \nU.S.C. § 9836a(e)(1)(C); 45 C.F.R. § 1304.5 (2021) (“Termination and denial of \nrefunding”). \nPlaintiffs—the State of Texas and the LISD—filed this action on December 10, 2021 \nseeking to enjoin the Rule’s enforcement.  Dkt. No. 1.  They argue that several statutory and \nconstitutional defects render the Rule procedurally and substantively invalid.  \nThe plaintiffs filed a motion seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary \ninjunction on December 14.  Dkt. Nos. 6; 8.  Two days later, the defendants5 appeared \nthrough counsel.  Dkt. No. 14.  Aware of the January 3 deadline for those who would \nobtain the Moderna vaccine, the Court set an expedited briefing schedule.  Dkt.

Biden, in his official capacity as President of the United \nStates. \n– 6 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  77  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244555599\nOn December 23, the defendants filed a response brief.  Dkt. Nos. 24; 25; 26.  Four days \nlater, they filed the administrative record.  Dkt. Nos. 27–35.  The plaintiffs then filed their \nreply on December 28.  Dkt. No. 38.   \nThe Court held a hearing to allow the parties to offer evidence and argument.  \nPlaintiffs offered 18 exhibits into evidence, while the defendants offered none.  Tr. at 10.  \nWith two exceptions, the defendants stipulated to the admissibility of plaintiffs’ exhibits.  Id. \nat 6; Dkt. No. 39.  Defendants objected to the use of the declarations attached to the \nplaintiff’s filings (Dkt. Nos. 39-3; 39-4; 39-7; 39-8; 39-9; 39-15; 39-16; 39-17) for any reason \nother than to analyze irreparable harm and the public interest.  Dkt. No. 39; Tr. at 86.  They \nalso objected in full to plaintiffs’ proposed Exhibit 14, which is a sample of public \ncomments.  Dkt. No. 39-14.  Thus, the Court admitted plaintiffs’ Exhibits 1–13 and 15–18.  \nTr. at 6, 10.  It took the admissibility of plaintiffs’ Exhibit 14 and the permissible use of the \ndeclarations under advisement. 6  Id. at 10.   \nDuring oral argument, counsel for the defendants made multiple concessions \nrelevant to the Court’s analysis.  First, she noted that the vaccine and mask mandates are \nnot “health services” within the meaning of the Head Start Act.  Id. at 40.  Second, she \nexplained that the agency does not assert that the Rule was or could be authorized under 42 \nU.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(A), which are “performance standards with respect to services required \nto be provided, including health . . . services.”  Id. at 40–41.  Third, while she continued to \nargue that the Rule could be authorized as an “administrative” standard under \nsubsection (C), she admitted that it could not qualify as a “financial management standard.”  \n \n6 Because the Court does not rely on Exhibit 14 in its analysis, nor consider the declarations outside \nof the harm and public-interest issues, the Court denies the objections as moot.   \n– 7 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  88  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244556600\nId. at 48.  And finally, she admitted that, while other health services made available to \nchildren by Head Start are “strongly encouraged,” this is the first time that Head Start has \never mandated a medical procedure as a precondition to new or ongoing employment.  Id. \nat 46–47.  The Rule is unprecedented, although counsel asserted that it is justified by an \nunprecedented pandemic.  Id. at 52, 55–58. \nCounsel for Texas likewise made an important clarification during argument.  \nRegarding Texas’s request for a nationwide injunction, he admitted that the Fifth Circuit \nrecently limited a nationwide injunction and that relevant precedent on the topic appeared \ninconsistent.  Id. at 90–91.  He agreed that the great majority of evidence before the Court \nwas limited to the mandate’s effect on Texas and school districts in Texas.  Id. at 91.  He \nexplained that Texas’s request for nationwide relief was not based on case law, but rather \nthe Administrative Procedure Act, which instructs courts to set aside unlawful agency \nactions.  Id. at 90–91. \n2.  Preliminary Injunction Standard \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a) authorizes federal courts to issue preliminary \ninjunctions.  The Court need not address Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining \nOrder under Rule 65(b) because defendants received notice, made an appearance, and the \nissues have been fully briefed and argued by the parties.   \n“A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy,” requiring a “clear showing” \nthat plaintiffs are entitled to such relief.  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22, \n24 (2008).  “In order to obtain a preliminary injunction, a movant must demonstrate (1) a \nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a substantial threat of irreparable harm if \nthe injunction does not issue; (3) that the threatened injury outweighs any harm that will \n– 8 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  99  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244556611\nresult if the injunction is granted; and (4) that the grant of an injunction is in the public \ninterest.”  Moore v. Brown, 868 F.3d 398, 402–03 (5th Cir. 2017) (citing Byrum v. Landreth, \n566 F.3d 442, 445 (5th Cir. 2009)).  “Likelihood of success and irreparable injury to the \nmovant are the most significant factors.”  Louisiana v. Becerra, --- F.4th ---, 2021 WL \n5913302, at *1 (5th Cir. Dec. 15, 2021) (citing Veasey v. Perry, 769 F.3d 890, 892 (5th Cir. \n2014)). \n3.  Analysis \nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nThe Court need not reach all of plaintiffs’ arguments to resolve their motion.  The \nCourt finds that plaintiffs’ have demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the \nmerits of four of their claims.   \ni.  Statutory Authority \nFirst, the Court finds that plaintiffs have demonstrated a substantial likelihood of \nsuccess on their claim that the Secretary issued the Rule without statutory authority.  \nA federal agency cannot act absent Congressional authorization.  La. Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. \nFCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986).  It cannot confer power upon itself.  Id.  “To permit an \nagency to expand its power in the face of a congressional limitation on its jurisdiction would \nbe to grant to the agency power to override Congress.”  Id. at 374–75.  Therefore, under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA), courts must “hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction” that is “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \nstatutory right.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C).   \nWhen reviewing an agency’s construction of a statute, courts must use the ordinary \ntools of statutory interpretation.  First, under the Chevron two-step framework, a court must \n– 9 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  1100  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244556622\nconsider “whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question as issue.”  Chevron, \nU.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984).  If Congress has directly \nspoken on the precise issue, the court “must give effect to the unambiguously expressed \nintent of Congress.”  Id. at 842–43.  But “if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to \nthe specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency’s answer is based on a \npermissible construction of the statute.”  Id. at 843.  \na.  The plain language of the statutory provisions on which the \nSecretary relies do not authorize mask and vaccine mandates. \nThe Court begins with the text of defendants’ cited authority.  HHS claims that \nsubsections 641A(a)(1)(C), (D), and (E) of the Head Start Act7 authorize the Rule.  86 Fed. \nReg. at 68,053 (citing § 9836a(a)(1)(C)–(E)).  The relevant language appears as follows: \n§ 9836a. Standards; monitoring of Head Start agencies and programs \n \n(a) Standards \n \n(1) Content of standards \n \nThe Secretary shall modify, as necessary, program \nperformance standards by regulation applicable to Head \nStart agencies and programs under this subchapter, \nincluding— \n. . .  \n \n(C) administrative and financial management standards; \n \n(D) standards relating to the condition and location of \nfacilities (including indoor air quality assessment \nstandards, where appropriate)  \n. . .  \n \n(E) such other standards as the Secretary finds to be \nappropriate. \n \n7  Defendants cite 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(C)–(E), as amended by the Improving Head Start for \nSchool Readiness Act of 2007, Pub. L. No. 110–34, § 8, 121 Stat. 1385–96 (2007).  For simplicity, \nthe Court refers to the current, amended version of this statute as the “Head Start Act.” \n– 10 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  1111  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244556633\n \n42 U.S.C. § 9836a. \nPlaintiffs argue that the Secretary’s ability to “modify” these “program performance \nstandards” does not authorize a vaccine mandate for all Head Start staff, contractors, and \nvolunteers, nor universal masking for all individuals age two and older.  Dkt. No. 8 at 19 \n(citing § 9836a(a)(1)).  The Court agrees. \nApplying Chevron’s first step, Congress has not spoken to the precise question at \nissue.  The statutory subsections on which defendants rely do not mention vaccination or \nmasking.  To some degree, this is not surprising.  The “program performance standards” in \nthe Head Start Act were last amended in 2007, when “masking” was not the common term \nit is today.  See supra note 7.  That “vaccination” or “immunization” are missing from the \nstatute is more telling.  State laws and regulations have long required that at least children \nbe vaccinated against many communicable diseases.  See, e.g., 25 Tex. Admin. Code \n§ 97.63(2)(A) (requiring that “[c]hildren enrolled in child-care facilities, pre-kindergarten, or \nearly childhood programs” be immunized against a host of diseases).   \nCongress could have spoken directly to the issue of vaccination, masking, or other \nprecautions in the last year when passing other COVID-19-related legislation, but it did not \nand has not.8  Rather than amend the Head Start Act, Congress only granted funds “for \ncarrying out” the existing “Head Start Act.”  See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, \nPub. L. No. 116–260, 134 Stat. 1181, 1583–84 (2020).  Moreover, the subsections on which \nthe defendants rely do not mention broader health and safety precautions that Head Start \n \n8 As counsel for the defendants conceded at the hearing, Congress could not have foreseen the \nCOVID-19 pandemic when it enacted the Head Start Act.  Tr. at 57–58.  That argument does not \nhelp the defendants, though.  Rather, it underscores the need to reach Chevron’s second step.     \n– 11 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  1122  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244556644\nstaff or children must take.  Subsections 641A(a)(1)(C), (D), and (E) are silent as to the \n“precise question at issue.”  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843.   \nAnd under subsection (A) of Section 641A(a)(1)—a provision the Secretary did not \ncite as authority for the Rule—Congress also did not speak to the precise question at issue, \neven though that subsection allows the Secretary to modify “program performance \nstandards” for “services required to be provided, including health.”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 9836a(a)(1)(A).  Though this provision mentions the word “health,” it concerns providing \nservices to children—not conditioning participation or employment on mask or vaccine \nrequirements.  Id.   \nTherefore, the Court must decide, under step two of the Chevron framework, whether \n“the agency’s [interpretation] is based on a permissible construction of the statute.”  467 \nU.S. at 843.  The plain language of defendants’ cited authority, the statutory context, and \nthe existing regulations all confirm that the Secretary’s interpretation of “performance \nstandards” is not a permissible construction of the statute.  The Court finds that plaintiffs are \nsubstantially likely to succeed on their claim that defendants exceeded their statutory \nauthority.   \nAs mentioned, the Secretary invokes subsections 641A(a)(1)(C), (D), and (E) of the \nHead Start Act to claim the broad authority for issuing this Rule.  86 Fed. Reg. at 68,053.  \nThose subsections authorize the Secretary to “modify, as necessary, program performance \nstandards by regulation . . . including—(C) administrative and financial management \nstandards; (D) standards relating to the condition and location of facilities (including indoor \nair quality assessment standards, where appropriate) . . . [and] (E) such other standards as \nthe Secretary finds to be appropriate.”  42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(C)–(E).   \n– 12 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  1133  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244556655\nAt the outset, Congress appears to have limited the scope of the Secretary’s power.  \nThe Secretary may only “modify” program performance standards.  Id.  This is not a broad \ngrant of rulemaking power like defendants suggest.  Rather, by enabling the Secretary to \nonly “modify” program performance standards, Congress conferred modest authority.  To \n“modify” means to “make somewhat different; to make small changes to (something) by \nway of improvement, suitability, or effectiveness . . . [t]o make more moderate or less \nsweeping; to reduce in degree or extent; to limit, qualify, or moderate.”  Modify, Black’s \nLaw Dictionary (11th ed. 2019); see also MCI Telecomm. Corp. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 512 U.S. \n218, 225 (1994) (“Virtually every dictionary we are aware of says that ‘to modify’ means to \nchange moderately or in minor fashion”). \nWith the power to “modify,” the Secretary may only make moderate changes to \nHead Start performance standards.  Against this backdrop, the Court finds that enacting \nunprecedent mask and vaccine mandates are not moderate changes to the specific standards \ndefendants try to leverage.  But even assuming “modify” does not cabin the Secretary’s \npower, the identified sources of authority cannot fairly be construed so broadly as to include \nan unprecedented, nationwide requirement of a medical procedure or universal masking.  \nThe Court addresses each of defendants’ cited provisions in turn. \nFirst, the mask and vaccine mandates are not authorized by subsection (C), which \nallows the Secretary to modify “administrative and financial management standards.”  \n§ 9836a(a)(1)(C).  “Financial management standards” plainly do not encompass mask and \nvaccine mandates—they relate to how money is handled.  Defendants admit that the \nmandates are not financial management standards.  Tr. at 48.   \n– 13 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  1144  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244556666\nLikewise, the Secretary may not impose these mandates by purporting to modify \nadministrative standards.  “Administrative” is not defined by the statute but generally refers \nto “of or relating to administration,” and “administration” is the “performance of executive \nduties: management.”  Administrative, Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed. \n2014); Administration, Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed. 2014).  By placing \nthe vaccine mandate in the “Human Resources Management” section of the regulations, \ndefendants seem to interpret “administrative” standards to include requiring its employees \nto undergo a mandatory offsite medical procedure or be fired if they are not granted an \nexemption.  See 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,060 (noting that the Rule adds four new provisions to \n“part 1302, subpart I—Human Resources Management” in 45 C.F.R. §§ 1302.93–94).  Such \na requirement would not typically be characterized as relating to executive duties or \nmanagement.  If it were, there would be no limit to the scope of administrative standards.  \nDefendants could then impose any requirement on Head Start staff, contractors, volunteers, \nand children by modifying “administrative standards.”   \nRather, the scope of “administrative standards” is informed by the term to which it is \njoined: “financial management standards.”  § 9836a(a)(1)(C).  Congress grouped the two \ntogether—not only in the same list, but in the same subsection.  See id.  Statutory terms are \noften known by the “company they keep.”  See Lagos v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 1684, 1688–\n89 (2018) (Breyer, J., writing for a unanimous Court) (citing Yates v. United States, 574 U.S. \n528, 542 (2015)) (finding “both the presence of company that suggests limitation and the \nabsence of company that suggests breadth”).  The agency concedes that the company \n“administrative” keeps—“financial management”—obviously cannot authorize the Rule.  \nTr. at 48.  Read together, the term “financial management standards” “suggests limitation” \n– 14 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  1155  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244556677\non the scope of the term “administrative standards.”  Id.  The terms appear to contemplate \nmanagement standards like those found in 45 C.F.R. § 1302.101(a)(1)—requiring programs \nto use effective “fiscal[] and human resource management structure[s]”—not mandatory \nmasking and vaccine requirements.  Given that the masking and vaccine mandates aim to \nprotect children’s health, it defies logic to assert that such standards would be characterized \nas administrative or financial.   \nSecond, the plain language of subsection (D) suggests that the Secretary may not \nimpose the mask and vaccine mandates.  Subsection (D) enables the Secretary to modify \n“standards relating to the condition and location of facilities (including indoor air quality \nassessment standards, where appropriate).”  § 9836a(a)(1)(D).  “Facility” is defined as “a \nstructure, such as a building or modular unit, appropriate for use in carrying out a Head \nStart program and used primarily to provide Head Start services.”  45 C.F.R. § 1305.2 \n(2021).  Subsection (D) specifies that the condition and location of facilities must “meet or \nexceed State and local requirements concerning licensing for such facilities” and “be \naccessible by State and local authorities for purposes of monitoring and ensuring \ncompliance.”  § 9836a(a)(1)(D)(i) & (ii).  The “condition” of facilities—as the references to \n“indoor air quality assessment standards,” licensing, and accessibility make clear—relate to \nphysical conditions of buildings and equipment—not conditions on children’s participation \nand adults’ employment or volunteer eligibility.  Mandating facility standards is a far cry \nfrom mandating a medical procedure for all staff under the threat of termination and what \nparticipants must wear.  See Texas v. Becerra, 2021 WL 5964687, at *5 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 15, \n2021) (Kacsmaryk, J.) (“Mandating facility standards is drastically different from mandating \nwho a healthcare provider hires or fires.”).  \n– 15 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  1166  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244556688\nThe Rule contains a lone sentence aimed at explaining how the mask and vaccine \nmandates are “standards relating to the condition . . . of facilities.”  § 9836a(a)(1)(D).  “The \nSecretary finds it necessary and appropriate to set health and safety standards for the \ncondition of Head Start facilities that ensure the reduction in transmission of the SARS–\nCoV–2 and to avoid severe illness, hospitalization, and death among program participants.”  \n86 Fed. Reg. at 68,054.  But the new Rule governs the conditions of people—not buildings.  \nSee Tr. at 49 (defendants acknowledging that “facilities” refer to buildings). \nThe last subsection—“such other standards as the Secretary finds to be \nappropriate”—cannot support the mask and vaccine mandates.  § 9836a(a)(1)(E).  Though \nseemingly expansive, “such other” standards fall under the banner of “performance \nstandards” and must be defined in relation to subsections (A)–(D).9  § 9836a(a)(1) (stating \nthat “[t]he Secretary shall modify, as necessary program performance standards”).  \nGenerally, “performance standards” are criteria that measure the quality of Head Start \nprograms.  See Standard, Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) (“A criterion for measuring \nacceptability, quality, or accuracy”).  Here, “quality” corresponds to Head Start programs’ \nability to achieve their purpose.  Under the Act, that purpose is to “promote the school \nreadiness of low-income children by enhancing their cognitive, social, and emotional \ndevelopment” through providing a host of services—including health services to the \nchildren and their families.  42 U.S.C. § 9831(2).   \n \n9 Plaintiffs also argue that such a broad reading of “other standards” the Secretary deems \n“appropriate” would violate the nondelegation doctrine.  Dkt. No. 8 at 25.  “The nondelegation \ndoctrine bars Congress from transferring its legislative power to another branch of Government.” \nGundy v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 2116, 2121 (2019).  But statutory delegations are permissible if \n“Congress has supplied an intelligible principle to guide the delegee’s use of discretion.”  Id. at \n2123.  Because the Court finds defendants’ broad reading impermissible, the Court need not \naddress nondelegation issues arising from the catch-all provision.  \n– 16 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  1177  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244556699\nThe vaccine mandate does not measure staff and volunteers’ ability to enhance \nchildren’s development; it determines whether they will be kept on, hired, or fired in the first \nplace.  Likewise, requiring all children ages two to five to wear masks is not a benchmark \nthat measures the quality of services provided, health-related or not.  Rather, it defines \nwhether children may receive Head Start services at all.  These mandates are prerequisites to \nperformance, not performance standards themselves.  Both set conditions for participation \nand employment.  They do not measure quality.  Defendants’ construction of their cited \nauthorities is impermissible for this fundamental reason.   \nFurthermore, if “such other performance standards” could include mask and vaccine \nmandates, there would be no genuine limiting principle to the Secretary’s authority to \nregulate in the name of “health and safety standards.”  As recently as August 2021, the \nSupreme Court invalidated a federal agency’s attempt to pass COVID-19 restrictions, and it \ndid so, in part, due to the lack of any limit to the asserted authority.  Alabama Ass’n of \nRealtors v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2489 (2021).  There, the Supreme \nCourt held that it was “virtually certain” that the CDC did not have authority to issue an \neviction moratorium based on the Surgeon General’s statutory authority to make and \nenforce regulations to prevent the spread of communicable diseases.  Id. at 2486.  The \nstatute at issue had a catch-all provision, similar to the one in this case—“other measures, as \nin his judgment may be necessary.”  Id. at 2487 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 264).  But the Court \nexplained that “the sheer scope of the CDC’s claimed authority . . . would counsel against” \nthe CDC’s interpretation, because it was “hard to see what measures [it] would place \noutside the CDC’s reach.”  Id. at 2489.   \n– 17 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  1188  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244557700\nAlthough, this case, of course, deals with different statutory language, the agency’s \nsimilar claim to expansive authority based on generalized and catch-all language \nundermines its position.  Here, defendants argue that the Secretary can leverage “such other \nstandards as the Secretary finds to be appropriate” to pass any health and safety regulation \nthat furthers the general purpose of the statute—keeping Head Start programs open to \npromote the school readiness of children.  Tr. at 51–52.  This reading appears to allow the \nSecretary to pass any health-related mandate that would reduce staff and volunteer \nabsenteeism.  Even if the plain language of “program performance standards” authorized \nthe Rule—which it does not—adopting the remote and manipulable reading urged by the \nSecretary counsels against the defendants’ interpretation.  See Alabama Ass’n of Realtors, 141 \nS. Ct. at 2489. \nb.  Other statutory provisions and existing regulations confirm \nthat the mask and vaccine mandates are unprecedented and \nunauthorized. \nCiting other provisions in the “standards” section, defendants urge a broader \nconstruction of “performance standards.”  See Dkt. No. 26 at 26–27.  Congress authorized \nthe Secretary to issue “deficiencies” when programs fail to follow “performance standards.”  \n§ 9836a(e)(1)(A).  The act defines a “deficiency” as “a systematic or substantial material \nfailure of an agency in an area of performance that the Secretary determines involves—(i) a \nthreat to the health, safety, or civil rights of children or staff; . . . [or] (iii) a failure to comply \nwith standards related to early childhood development and health services . . . .”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 9832(2)(A).  So, defendants argue, the Secretary can establish “standards related to early \nchildhood development and health services” and “the health . . . of children or staff” \nbecause he can issue deficiencies for failures to follow such standards.  Dkt. No. 26 at 26–27 \n– 18 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  1199  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244557711\n(quoting § 9832(2)(A) and citing § 9836a(e)(1)).  The argument falls short for multiple \nreasons.   \nFirst, there was never any doubt that the Secretary could establish certain \nperformance standards related to “health services.”  Subsection (A) of program performance \nstandards specifically allows the Secretary to modify “performance standards with respect to \nservices required to be provided, including health.”  § 9836(a)(1)(A).  But the Secretary did \nnot rely on this subsection as his statutory authority for the mask and vaccine mandates.  \nSubsection (A) does not appear in the Rule even once.  He instead cites subsections \n(C) (“administrative and financial”), (D) (“facilities”), and (E) (“other”) of “program \nperformance standards.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 68,052–53 (citing § 9836(a)(1)(C)–(E)).  And \ndefendants concede that mask and vaccine mandates are not health services.  Tr. at 40.  \nIndeed, they are not.  Head Start is not providing “health services” to children, nor \nestablishing related “performance standards,” by requiring universal masking and staff \nvaccination.  Current performance standards related to health services include examinations \nand screenings for children.  See 45 C.F.R. § 1302.42 (2021).  These standards even include \nassisting children in getting up to date on immunizations.  § 1302.42(b)(1).   \nBut these existing regulations differ from the mask and vaccine requirements in three \ncritical ways.  One, they do not operate as conditions to participation.  The provision of \nhealth services, like screenings and immunization assistance, for children already \nparticipating in Head Start programs promotes school readiness, but they are not required.  \nMandatory vaccines and universal masking, in contrast, present barriers to entry unlike any \nother “performance standard.”  Two, since the first of these regulations were promulgated, \nthe health services offered have always required parental consent.  See Program Performance \n– 19 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  2200  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244557722\nStandards for Operation of Head Start Programs by Grantees and Delegate Agencies, 40 \nFed. Reg. 27,562, 27,565 (June 30, 1975) (codified in 45 C.F.R. § 1304.3-3(a)) (requiring \n“advance parent or guardian authorization” for all screenings and examinations); 45 C.F.R. \n§ 1302.41 (2021) (requiring Head Start programs to “collaborate with parents as partners in \nthe health and well-being of their children” and “[a]t a minimum” to “[o]btain advance \nauthorization from the parent or other person with legal authority for all health and \ndevelopmental procedures administered through the program”); 45 C.F.R. § 1302.42(b)(ii) \n(2021) (authorizing Head Start staff to assist parents with scheduling immunizations but \nsaying nothing about enforced masking or vaccinations).  And the defendants concede that \nthe Rule at issue is the first time in Head Start’s history that a health procedure was \nmandated as a prerequisite to participation or employment.  Tr. at 47.  Three, the \nregulations on which defendants rely only require that immunizations be made available to \nchildren; they say nothing regarding staff or volunteers.  45 C.F.R. § 1302.41 (2021) (“Child \nhealth status and care”).  Here, by contrast, the vaccine and mask mandates condition \nemployment on compliance, and this is the first-ever medical procedure required of Head \nStart staff under the threat of termination.  Tr. at 47.  These distinctions again highlight why \nthe mandates are not “performance standards” in the first place. \nSecond, that the “deficiencies” for which the Secretary can impose sanctions \ncontemplate threats to “health and safety” does not widen the scope of what “performance \nstandards” comprises.  Based on the listed “performance standards” in section 9836a(a)(1), \nthe Secretary has limited power to provide for the health and safety of Head Start programs.  \nThat was never in doubt.  But again, it does not authorize the mask and vaccine mandates.  \nFor instance, Congress expressly granted the Secretary power to regulate the conditions of \n– 20 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  2211  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244557733\n“facilities.”  § 9836a(a)(1)(D).  And here, the Secretary’s own explanation of his statutory \nauthority focused on “facilities.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 68,054.  Facility conditions, such as poor \n“ventilation” systems, directly impact the health and safety of children and staff.  Id. at \n68,054, 68,066.  Thus, it is no surprise that the Secretary could issue deficiencies based on \n“threat[s] [to] the health or safety” of staff and children resulting from facility conditions.  \n§§ 9836a(a)(1)(D) & (e)(1)(B)(i).  But, as explained above, the Act says nothing about \nconditioning participation and employment eligibility on health and safety requirements as \nvast as the mask and vaccine mandates here.   \nFurthermore, that Congress mentions standards related to “health” services in \nsubsection (A), cuts against defendants’ claim that the catch-all provision in subsection (E) \nincludes any health-related standards.  Reading “other standards” as broadly as defendants \nsuggest would render subsection (A) surplusage as it pertains to “health” related standards.  \nThe catch-all provision cannot be read so broadly as to eclipse the meaning of subsections \n(A)–(D).  The Court “must give effect to every word that Congress used in the statute.”  \nLowe v. SEC, 472 U.S. 181, 207 n.53 (1985).   \nc.  Vaccination requirements for Head Start staff and volunteers \nare state government—not federal agency—matters. \nHaving already addressed the existing regulations governing children, the Court \nturns to the existing regulations governing Head Start staff and volunteers.  To the extent \nthe regulations shed light on the scope of Secretary’s authority under the statute, they do not \nauthorize this Rule’s mandates.  Rather, they imply that periodically screening or testing \nworkers may be permissible when done in “accordance with state, tribal, and local \nrequirements.”  See 45 C.F.R. §§ 1302.93–94 (2021) (requiring staff and volunteers to test for \n– 21 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  2222  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244557744\ncommunicable diseases “in accordance with state, tribal, and local” laws and \nrequirements).10  These provisions suggest two ideas, neither of which help defendants.   \nFirst, testing employees for communicable diseases may, in some circumstances, be \npermissible.  But this is not a periodic testing rule.  This is a vaccine mandate.  Nothing in \nthe regulations contemplate that the federal government can require staff and volunteers to \nbe periodically immunized.   \nSecond, testing only occurs when conducted consistent with “state, tribal, and local” \nlaws and requirements.  Id.  This confirms what the Supreme Court has recognized for over \na century.  Public health and safety regulation belongs, in the first instance, to the States.  \nJacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 25, 38 (1905) (recognizing that the “safety and the \nhealth of the people of” states are for States to “guard and protect” through their general \n“police power[s]”).  Moreover, defendants’ argument that states can require employee \nvaccination does not support their argument that a federal agency can.  Dkt. No. 26 at 36–\n37 (“Students and educators have long been subject to . . . state vaccination requirements.”) \n(emphasis added).  Rather, it supports finding that the Secretary cannot compel vaccination \nhere. \nIn this respect, defendants cause their own undoing.  They repeatedly affirm the \nnotion that “vaccine requirements have existed for centuries as a commonplace feature of \n \n10 Defendants also rely on regulations that require staff to clean play areas and wash their hands after \nrestroom use or changing diapers.  Dkt. No. 26 at 35 (citing 45 C.F.R. § 1302.47(b)(6)(i) (2021) \n(hand hygiene); 45 C.F.R. § 1302.47(b)(2)(i) (cleaning and disinfecting play areas and equipment)).  \nSuch basic hygiene practices do not come close to showing that the Head Start Act authorizes \nuniversal masking requirements for 2-year-old children or mandatory vaccination for staff, which \nresults in termination if they choose not to comply.  And the staff-training provisions defendants \ncite also refer to state and local requirements, indicating that federal rules do not solely govern.  \nDkt. No. 26 at 35 (citing 45 C.F.R. § 1302.47(b)(4)). \n– 22 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  2233  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244557755\nAmerican life, particularly in the education context.”  Dkt. No. 26 at 35 (citing Klaassen v. \nTrs. of Ind. Univ., 7 F.4th 592, 593 (7th Cir. 2021) (upholding a state university’s vaccination \nrequirement)).  Correct.  And for “centuries,” states—not federal agencies—have compelled \nvaccine requirements in the education context.  See, e.g., 25 Tex. Admin. Code § 97.63(2)(A) \n(requiring that “[c]hildren enrolled in child-care facilities, pre-kindergarten, or early \nchildhood programs” be immunized against a host of diseases); Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-702 \n(West) (outlining immunization requirements for school children).   \nThe vaccine mandate at issue here comes from a federal agency, not a state.  But \nCongress must use “exceedingly clear language if it wishes to significantly alter the balance \nbetween federal and state power.”  U.S. Forest Serv. v. Cowpasture River Pres. Ass’n, 140 S. Ct. \n1837, 1850 (2020) (citing Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991)).  Congress’s failure to \nuse “exceedingly clear language” in any part of the statute further supports what the plain \nlanguage of “performance standards” indicates: defendants do not have authority to issue \nthe mask and vaccine mandates at issue here.   \nThis conclusion is especially true if the “major questions doctrine” applied.  The \nSupreme Court recently reaffirmed that it “expect[s] Congress to speak clearly when \nauthorizing an agency to exercise powers of ‘vast economic and political significance.’”  \nAlabama Association, 141 S. Ct. at 2489 (quoting Util. Air Regul. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, \n324 (2014)).   \nSeveral factors favor applying this additional level of scrutiny.  The Office of \nManagement and Budget declared that the Rule is a “major rule” because it will “have an \nannual effect on the economy of $100 million or more.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 68,063.  In fact, \nACF awards approximately “$10 billion in grants to Head Start programs.”  Id. at 68,100.  \n– 23 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  2244  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244557766\nAnd the Rule will regulate 273,000 staff, a share of the one million volunteers who interact \nwith children in-person, and a share of the 864,000 children participating in-person.  Id. at \n68,068–69.  Plaintiffs rightly argue that these factors highlight the great economic \nsignificance of the Rule.  See Dkt. No. 8 at 28.  In addition, they argue that the federal \ngovernment’s power to require citizens to get vaccinated or wear masks is a question of \ngreat political significance. See id. at 28, 36. \nBut the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits recently held that the doctrine did not apply to \nrules with much larger economic effects and arguably equivalent political significance \nbecause the rules at issue were not “an enormous and transformative expansion in [the \nagencies’] regulatory authority.”  See In re MCP No. 165, --- F.4th ---, 2021 WL 5989357, at \n*7 (6th Cir. Dec. 17, 2021) (order dissolving the Fifth Circuit’s stay of the OSHA ETS \nmandate) (quoting Utility Air, 573 U.S. at 324); Florida v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 19 \nF.4th 1271, 1287 (11th Cir. 2021) (order denying injunction pending appeal of the CMS \nmandate) (quoting Utility Air, 573 U.S. at 324).  Delineating an “enormous and \ntransformative” unlawful expansion of regulatory authority from a regular-sized unlawful \nexpansion of regulatory authority is difficult.  But the Court in this case need not resolve \nthat question nor the more general issue of the major-questions doctrine.  Under traditional \nprinciples of statutory interpretation, and even without the major-questions doctrine’s more \nexacting standard, the defendants’ construction is impermissible.11 \n \n11 If the doctrine applied, plaintiffs would prevail even more easily because Congress has not spoken \nclearly in authorizing HHS to impose the expansive and unprecedented mandates on Head Start \nprograms. \n– 24 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  2255  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244557777\nii.  Proper Rulemaking Procedures  \na.  There is a substantial likelihood that the Secretary did not \nfollow the procedures required to modify performance \nstandards under the Head Start Act.  \nEven if the Head Start Act allowed the Secretary to impose mask and vaccine \nmandates under the guise of modifying “performance standards”—which it does not—the \nRule cannot stand for another fundamental reason.  Under the APA, the Court shall “hold \nunlawful and set aside agency action” that is “not in accordance with law” or “in excess of \nstatutory . . . limitations.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(1)(A), (C).  Here, the statute requires the \nSecretary to comply with several requirements prior to modifying “any” performance \nstandards.  42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(2)(A). \nUnder the statute, the Secretary must: \n[C]onsult with experts in the fields of child development, early childhood \neducation, child health care, family services (including linguistically and \nculturally appropriate services to non-English speaking children and their \nfamilies), administration, and financial management, and with persons with \nexperience in the operation of Head Start programs. \n \nId.  “Here, the Secretary consulted with experts in child health, including pediatricians, a \npediatric infectious disease specialist, and the recommendations of the CDC and FDA.”  86 \nFed. Reg. at 68,054.   \nThe Secretary failed, however, to consult with many of the required stakeholders.  \nNotable absentees from his list include experts in the fields of (1) “early childhood \neducation,” (2) “family services (including linguistically and culturally appropriate services \nto non-English speaking children and their families),” and (3) “administration[] and \nfinancial management.”  § 9836a(a)(2)(A).  The failure to consult with “persons with \nexperience in the operation of Head Start programs” is even more striking.  Id. \n– 25 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  2266  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244557788\nAnd defendants do not argue that the Secretary actually consulted with these \nnecessary stakeholders.  They only repeat the general assertion that the Secretary “included \nrelevant considerations” under Section 9836a(a)(2) when issuing the Rule.  Dkt. No. 26 at 57 \n(quoting 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,053–54) (emphasis added).  But the Secretary went out of his \nway to list in the Rule the experts with whom he consulted and, in doing so, he omitted \nseveral required by the statute.  The inclusion of those listed implies the exclusion of those \nnot.  Cf. Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U.S. 149, 168 (2003) (finding that the expression of \none thing implies the exclusion of others “when the items expressed are members of an \n‘associated group or series’”) (quoting United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, 65 (2002)).   \nThese requirements exist for the Secretary’s and the public’s benefit.  They are not \noptional.  They are mandatory under the statute.  Therefore, the plaintiffs have shown a \nsubstantial likelihood that the Secretary did not follow the procedures required to modify \nperformance standards. \nb.  There is a substantial likelihood that the Secretary did not \nhave good cause to issue the Rule without notice and \ncomment. \nThere is a substantial likelihood that the Rule must be set aside for another reason: \nHHS did not have “good cause” to skip the notice-and-comment procedures required by the \nAPA when it promulgated the Rule.  Courts must set aside agency action undertaken \n“without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).  Under the APA, \nan agency typically must first publish notice of a proposed rule and give the public \nopportunity to comment before adopting a final rule.  5 U.S.C. § 553(b), (c).  The agency \nalso must publish such rules at least thirty days before its effective date.  § 553(d).  These \nprocedures are “designed to assure due deliberation.”  Smiley v. Citibank (S.D.), N.A., 517 \n– 26 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  2277  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244557799\nU.S. 735, 741 (1996) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 553 and Thompson v. Clark, 741 F.2d 401, 409 (D.C. \nCir. 1984)).  But, on rare occasions, “both of these requirements may be bypassed if ‘good \ncause’ exists.”  United States v. Johnson, 632 F.3d 912, 927 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting 5 U.S.C. \n§ 553(b)(3)(B)). \nNotice-and-comment procedures do not apply “when the agency for good cause” \nfinds those procedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.”  \n5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3)(B).  Typically, the government’s “burden to show that good cause \nexists is a heavy one.”  United States v. Cain, 583 F.3d 408, 420 (6th Cir. 2009).  Indeed, the \nexception is to be “narrowly construed and only reluctantly countenanced.”  N.J., Dep’t of \nEnv’t Prot. v. EPA, 626 F.2d 1038, 1045 (D.C. Cir. 1980).  Nor can it provide agencies with \nan “‘escape clause’ from the requirements Congress prescribed.”  Johnson, 632 F.3d at 928 \n(quoting United States v. Garner, 767 F.2d 104, 120 (5th Cir. 1985)).  “Its use ‘should be \nlimited to emergency situations.’”  Util. Solid Waste Activities Grp. v. EPA, 236 F.3d 749, 754 \n(D.C. Cir. 2001) (quoting Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps. v. Block, 655 F.2d 1153, 1156 (D.C. Cir. \n1981)).  To determine whether “good cause” exists, the Court must “rely only on the ‘basis \narticulated by the agency itself’ at the time of the rulemaking.”  Johnson, 632 F.3d at 928 \n(quoting Garner, 767 F.2d at 116–17). \nDefendants first argue that the Court should not “narrowly construe” the good cause \nexception because HHS voluntarily adopted notice-and-comment procedures; Congress did \nnot require it.  Dkt. No. 26 at 54.  The APA specifically exempts matters relating to \n“grants,” and Head Start is a federal grant program.  5 U.S.C. § 553(a)(2); see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \n§ 9835 (allotment of funds).  But, in 1971, HHS adopted a policy statement requiring it to \nfollow notice-and-comment procedures.  Public Participation in Rule Making, 36 Fed. Reg. \n– 27 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  2288  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244558800\n2,532 (Jan. 28, 1971).  While defendants do not contest the binding nature of the policy \nstatement, they argue that the Congressional policy to construe the good cause exception \nnarrowly does not apply because Congress itself exempted HHS from APA procedures in \nthe grant program context.  Dkt. No. 26 at 54 (quoting Alcaraz v. Block, 746 F.2d 593, 612 \n(9th Cir. 1984) (noting that agencies “should have more latitude in determining when to \ninvoke ‘good cause’ when notice and comment requirements are self-imposed” so the \nexception should not be construed “extremely narrowly”)).   \nConstrued “extremely narrowly” or not, plaintiffs have established a substantial \nlikelihood that the Secretary did not have “good cause” to waive the APA procedures.12  \nDefendants argue that “good cause” existed to skip notice and comment, thereby delaying \nthe effective date of the Rule, because it would be “impracticable and contrary to the public \ninterest.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 68,059.  The Secretary cites several concerning factors, including \n“failure to achieve sufficiently high levels of vaccination based on voluntary efforts and \npatchwork requirements, potential harm to children from unvaccinated staff, continuing \nstrain on the health care system, and known efficacy and safety of available vaccines.”  Id.  \n \n12 Fifth Circuit “courts generally read exceptions from notice and comment narrowly.”  Baylor Univ. \nMed. Ctr. v. Heckler, 758 F.2d 1052, 1058 (5th Cir. 1985) (citations omitted).  Heckler involved an \nHHS rule for Medicare allowances to certain providers.  Id. at 1054–56.  The rule was promulgated \nbefore the HHS’s 1971 waiver of 5 U.S.C. § 553(a)(2) exemptions but before Congress prescribed \nMedicare-specific notice-and-comment procedures.  Id. at 1059 n.11; 42 U.S.C. § 1395hh(b)(1) \n(requiring 60 days’ notice and comment).  Therefore, the Heckler court ultimately concluded that \nthe 553(a)(2) “benefits” exemption applied.  Id. at 1061.  However, the Fifth Circuit stated a \ngeneral principle that all exceptions from notice and comment, including 553(b)(3)(B)’s “good \ncause” exception, will be construed “narrowly” even when faced with HHS’s voluntary 1971 \nwaiver of 5 U.S.C. § 553(a)(2) exemptions.  Id. at 1058.  Given this, it is unclear whether the Fifth \nCircuit will choose to follow the position of the Ninth Circuit in Alcaraz by extending more latitude \nin construing “good cause” where the agency voluntarily waived 553(a)(2) exemptions.  746 F.2d \n593.  Also, at the time the agency issued the Rule, it did not claim to be exempt from notice and \ncomment under 5 U.S.C. § 553(a)(2).  Rather, it expressly attempted to justify why it had “good \ncause” under the APA.  86 Fed. Reg. at 68,058–59. \n– 28 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  2299  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244558811\nSpecifically, delaying the vaccine mandate “would endanger the health and safety of staff, \nchildren, and families” as programs prepared to return to fully in-person services.  Id.  The \nCourt does not question the authenticity of these concerns.  But the only issue for the Court \nis whether HHS can show that notice and comment was “impracticable, unnecessary, or \ncontrary to the public interest.”  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3)(B).   \nAs a threshold observation, the Secretary’s specific explanation is limited to the \nvaccine mandate, which requires compliance by January 31, 2022—62 days after the \nSecretary published the Rule.  The mask mandate—which required instantaneous \ncompliance on November 30, 2021—is not mentioned.  In the “Waiver of Proposed \nRulemaking” section, the Secretary never explains why following notice-and-comment \nprocedures for the mask mandate was impracticable or contrary to the public interest.  See \n86 Fed. Reg. 68,058–59 (Section III.C “Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking”).  Because the \nCourt must “rely only on the ‘basis articulated by the agency itself’ at the time of \nrulemaking,” this omission favors finding that the Secretary likely did not have good cause \nto exclude public participation prior to issuing the Rule.  Johnson, 632 F.3d at 928 (quoting \nGarner, 767 F.2d at 116–17). \nSecond, the Secretary gave staff and volunteers 62 days to get vaccinated after the \nRule’s effective date—more than enough time to receive the vaccine.  This amount of time \nseems reasonable.  Some might say practicable.  So too, then, would notice and comment \nhave been.  Notice and comment would not have forced HHS to push back the vaccination-\ncompliance date.  Even if public participation did not affect the substance of the final rule, \nHHS could have received comment and not sacrificed even one day in addressing the real \nconcerns it outlines. \n– 29 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  3300  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244558822\nPlaintiffs argue that notice and comment were not impracticable and contrary to the \npublic interest because defendants “waited 82 days from the announcement of the rule on \nSeptember 9, 2021, until publishing the rule on November 30, 2021.”  Dkt. No. 8 at 45.  \nTherefore, defendants “waited longer to publish the rule without comment than if it had \nsimply noticed the rule and allowed comment.”  Id.  Defendants respond that during this \nperiod, “the Secretary completed a fifty-page rule, with an analysis of over 144 cited \nsources” thereby demonstrating “appropriate dispatch in the face of crisis.”  Dkt. No. 26 at \n56.   \nThe Court recognizes that “reasoned policy determination[s]” take time and do not \nnecessarily “undermine the state of emergency.”  See In re MCP, 2021 WL 5989357, at *8–9 \n(citing 29 U.S.C. § 655(c)) (assessing “emergency” not under the APA’s “good cause” \nstandard, but under the Occupational Safety and Health Act’s “emergency temporary \nstandard”); see also Florida, 19 F.4th 1271 (holding that the district court did not abuse its \ndiscretion in finding that the Secretary of HHS set forth a sufficient basis of good cause for \nwaiving notice and comment).  But the Head Start Rule, substantially shorter and less \ncomplex, was issued 25 days after the OSHA vaccine-or-test rule and the CMS vaccine \nmandate were issued.  See COVID–19 Vaccination and Testing; Emergency Temporary \nStandard, 86 Fed. Reg. 61,402 (Nov. 5, 2021) (154-page OSHA ETS mandate); Medicare \nand Medicaid Programs; Omnibus COVID–19 Health Care Staff Vaccination, 86 Fed. Reg. \n61,555 (Nov. 5, 2021) (73-page CMS rule with an analysis of over 200 cited sources).  The \nCourt does not expect agencies to issue “emergency” rules in mere days, or even a few \nweeks, after the President announces his intent to impose new rules.  But this 82-day \ntimeline, when paired with the 62-day vaccination-compliance period, disfavors finding this \n– 30 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  3311  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244558833\ndegree of federal involvement in pre-K programs to be an emergency that rendered notice \nand comment “impracticable.” \nAnd defendants’ data arguably casts further doubt on the emergency nature of their \nconcerns in this specific context.  The Secretary found that “uptake of vaccination among \nHead Start staff has not been as robust as hoped for.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 68,054.  In \ndefendants’ cited survey, however, vaccination rates among childcare providers \n“significantly exceeded [rates among] the general population.” Id. at 68,078.  Defendants \nestimate that Head Start staff are 12% more likely to be vaccinated.  Id. at 68,069.13   \nIn light of the vaccine-compliance period, defendants’ lengthy delay, and the \nrelatively high vaccination rates of their instructors, the Court finds that notice and \ncomment was not impracticable.  See Mid-Tex Elec. Coop., Inc. v. FERC, 822 F.2d 1123, 1132 \n(D.C. Cir. 1987) (recognizing that “the ‘good cause’ inquiry is inevitably fact- or context-\ndependent”).   \nRather than working against the public interest, notice and comment would have \nserved the public interest, by ensuring “due deliberation” with the important stakeholders.  \nSmiley, 517 U.S. at 741 (citing 5 U.S.C. § 553 and Thompson, 741 F.2d at 409).  “The public \ninterest prong of the good cause exception is met only in the rare circumstance when \n \n13 Plaintiffs’ declarations suggest the same, but defendants object to the Court’s consideration of \nthem outside of the irreparable-harm and public interest analyses.  Dkt. No. 39; Tr. at 6.  Because \nthe Court can resolve the notice-and-comment question without the declarations, it will not factor \nthat evidence into its analysis, findings, and conclusion.  In the interest of completeness, however, \nthe Court will summarize the evidence here.  According to the superintendent, LISD serves 540 \npre-K students receiving Head Start grants, and it employs over 150 Head Start staff.  Dkt. No. 39-\n4 ¶ 2 (Affidavit of LISD Superintendent, Dr. Kathy Rollo).  In an anonymous survey conducted \nbefore the school year in August, 84% of LISD staff reported receiving at least one vaccine dose.  \nId. ¶ 6.  Four months later, vaccination rates could be even higher.  This school year, there have \nbeen zero COVID-19 cases among pre-K staff, even though most do not wear masks.  Id. ¶¶ 5, 9. \n \n– 31 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  3322  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244558844\nordinary procedures—generally presumed to serve the public interest—would in fact harm \nthat interest.”  Mack Trucks, Inc. v. EPA, 682 F.3d 87, 95 (D.C. Cir. 2012).  Notice and \ncomment would have involved important stakeholders, many of whom were excluded from \nthe rulemaking process in violation of the Head Start Act itself.  42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(2)(A); \nsee supra Part 3.A.ii.a (outlining the Secretary’s failure to consult with experts in the fields of \nearly childhood education, family services, administration and financial management, and \npersons with experience operating Head Start programs).  The Secretary’s decision silenced \nHead Start teachers, volunteers, and parents—the people who likely understand well the \neducational, linguistic, and social-development costs and benefits of masking toddlers and \nteachers in classrooms.   \nFurthermore, public feedback seems particularly important here given the diversity of \nlocal health conditions across the country and the wide reach of the mandate.  86 Fed. Reg. \n68,058; see American Federation, 655 F.2d at 1156 (“The more expansive the regulatory \nreach . . . the greater the necessity for public comment.”).  Rather than guessing that it \nwould be burdensome for large agencies to administer different policies for areas with \ndisparate COVID-19 transmission rates, HHS could have solicited their input through \nnotice and comment. \nTo be sure, HHS is accepting comments until December 30, 2021.  86 Fed. Reg. \n68,052.  But “accepting post-promulgation comments,” after the Rule’s effective date, does \nnot “excuse compliance with APA procedures.”  Johnson, 632 F.3d at 929.  This too is not \nan escape hatch.  “Permitting the submission of views after the effective date is no substitute \nfor the right of interested persons to make their views known to the agency in time to \ninfluence the rule making process in a meaningful way.”  U.S. Steel Corp. v. EPA, 595 F.2d \n– 32 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  3333  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244558855\n207, 214 (5th Cir. 1979) (quoting City of New York v. Diamond, 379 F. Supp. 503, 517 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1974)).  To allow otherwise, would make the provisions of Section 553 “virtually \nunenforceable.”  Id. at 215. \n“The essential purpose of according § 553 notice and comment opportunities is to \nreintroduce public participation and fairness to affected parties after governmental authority \nhas been delegated to unrepresentative agencies.”  Batterton v. Marshall, 648 F.2d 694, 703 \n(D.C. Cir. 1980).  Here, the Secretary deprived the public and important stakeholders of this \nopportunity.  Whether the Court construes the good cause exception “extremely narrowly” \nor not, HHS likely did not have good cause to forgo the notice-and-comment period.   \niii.  Arbitrary and Capricious \nThe Court finds that there is a substantial likelihood that the Rule is arbitrary and \ncapricious because it is unreasonably overbroad without a reasonable explanation.  It \nimposes a one-size-fits-all approach with no end date, failing to establish a “rational \nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., \nInc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines v. \nUnited States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The lack of a reasoned explanation is especially \nconcerning given that the Rule constitutes a drastic change from Head Start’s tradition of \nlocal flexibility, CDC-reported success in navigating the pandemic through flexibility, and \nthe local programs’ reliance interest on that flexibility.  See Dkt. No. 39-19 at 1–2. \nA court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings and conclusions \nfound to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  The Supreme Court recently rearticulated what this \nstandard requires:  \n– 33 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  3344  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244558866\nThe APA’s arbitrary-and-capricious standard requires that agency action be \nreasonable and reasonably explained.  Judicial review under that standard is \ndeferential, and a court may not substitute its own policy judgment for that of \nthe agency.  A court simply ensures that the agency has acted within a zone of \nreasonableness and, in particular, has reasonably considered the relevant issues \nand reasonably explained the decision. \n \nFCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 141 S. Ct. 1150, 1158 (2021) (citing FCC v. Fox Television \nStations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 513–14 (2009) and State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43).  In applying this \nstandard, the Court is limited to “the basis articulated by the agency itself.”  State Farm, 463 \nU.S. at 50.  Accordingly, this Court’s review is deferential and limited.  But “it is by no \nmeans a rubber stamp.”  Garner, 767 F.2d at 116.   \nPlaintiffs argue that the Head Start Rule is arbitrary and capricious on more than a \ndozen grounds.  Dkt. No. 8 at 34–43.  Only a handful are particularly salient at this \npreliminary stage.   \nFirst, the Secretary made no distinctions in the Rule based on size, location, or \ntransmission rates.  The Head Start Rule’s requirements are universal.  Contra In re MCP, \n2021 WL 5989357, at *2 (upholding OSHA standard applying only to employers of a \ncertain size); Alabama Association, 141 S. Ct. at 2490 (vacating stay of CDC eviction \nmoratorium, which applied only in counties with high transmission rates).  The Secretary \nacknowledged regional differences in COVID-19 transmission14 but did not “reasonably \nexplain” his failure to accommodate such differences.  Prometheus Radio Project, 141 S. Ct. at \n1158.  The Secretary found that “cases are trending downward” in some states.  86 Fed. \nReg. at 68,058.  But “there are emerging indications of potential increase in others—\nparticularly northern states where the weather has begun to turn colder.”  Id.   \n \n14 See 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,058. \n– 34 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  3355  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244558877\nAn agency is “not required to identify the optimal threshold” of rule distinctions \nbased on size, location, or transmission rates “with pinpoint precision.”  In re MCP, 2021 \nWL 5989357, at *15.  And “[c]ourts are ‘generally unwilling to review line-drawing \nperformed by the [agency] unless a petitioner can demonstrate that lines drawn . . . are \npatently unreasonable, having no relationship to the underlying regulatory problem.”  Id. \n(alteration in original) (quoting Cassell v. FCC, 154 F.3d 478, 485 (D.C. Cir. 1998)).  But the \nRule does not account for any of the previously mentioned differences.  Without reasonably \nconsidering the relevant issues or reasonably explaining the decision, it imposed a novel, \nuniversal approach. \nContrary to this approach, Head Start has a documented history of success from \nflexible practices depending on local needs.  Dkt. Nos. 5-9 at 2-3; 27 at 4 (OHS May 2021 \nguidance listed in the administrative record); 29-9 (CDC report included in the \nadministrative record).  In its May 2021 guidance, the agency recognized that “[t]o date, \nOHS provided needed flexibilities and guidance that allowed programs to adapt services \nbased on the changing health conditions in their communities.”  Id. at 2 (emphasis added).  As a \nresult, some Head Start programs offered virtual and remote services, but “[m]any programs \ncontinued to provide in-person services for children and families throughout the COVID-19 \npandemic.”  Id.  The guidance instructed its in-person programs “to continue serving \nchildren in person, as local health conditions allow” and encouraged programs to “move to in-\nperson services, as local health conditions allow.”  Id. at 2 (emphasis added).  During the \npandemic, local programs decided to close, operate remotely or hybrid, or offer fully in-\nperson services, depending on their circumstances.  86 Fed. Reg. at 68,058.  In September \n2021, 73% of centers were open for in-person services, 14% operated in a hybrid model, and \n– 35 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  3366  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244558888\n4% were virtual.  Id.  Only 2% were entirely closed due to COVID-19.  Id.  This history \nmakes clear that defendants recognized the importance of tailoring COVID-19 policy for \nmonths and that local centers were able to navigate the pandemic successfully.   \nThere is no doubt that Head Start’s traditional local-flexibility approach worked and \nthat the data was before the agency when it nevertheless imposed the one-size-fits-all Rule.  \nA December 2020 report from the CDC studied the implementation of mitigation strategies \nin early childhood education settings.  Dkt. No. 29-9 (administrative record).  The CDC \nreported that, while “[m]ost states required all schools (K-12) to close or transition to virtual \nlearning,” the Office of Head Start “gave its local programs that remained open the \nflexibility to use CARES Act funds to implement CDC-recommended guidance.”  Id. at 1.  \nThe result?  “Head Start programs successfully implemented CDC-recommended mitigation \nstrategies and supported other practices that helped to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission \namong children and staff members.”  Id.  The CDC stressed that the flexibility provided to \nlocal Head Start programs was key to the success: “Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, \nHead Start and Early Head Start programs successfully implemented CDC-recommended \nmitigation strategies and applied other innovative approaches to limit SARS-CoV-2 \ntransmission among children, teachers, and other staff members by allowing maximum \nprogram flexibility and allocating financial and human resources.”  Id. at 3 (emphasis added).  \nThe report concludes that “[c]hild care settings should implement concurrent preventive \nmeasures and adjust these strategies based on community transmission data.”  Id. at 4.   \nDespite this tradition and success, defendants attempt to justify their new one-size-\nfits-all approach by stating that it would be “burdensome” for grant recipients that cover \nlarge geographic areas to issue different guidance to programs in different locations.  86 Fed. \n– 36 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  3377  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244558899\nReg. at 68,066.  But such a conclusory allegation constitutes willful ignorance of the facts \nand issues in a rushed attempt to achieve its goals.  Head Start agencies covered large areas \nand adjusted as necessary prior to the Rule, and defendants cite no evidence indicating that \nit was burdensome to do so then or now.15  To the contrary, ACF admits that it has “relied \non the importance of local health conditions in issuing guidance to Head Start programs” \nbefore and acknowledges the diversity in transmission rates.  Id; see also id. at 68,058.  \nMoreover, the Rule ignores CDC guidance “that localities should monitor community \ntransmission in making decisions” and the CDC’s report that Head Start had successfully \nnavigated the pandemic through “maximum program flexibility.”  Id. at 68,066; Dkt. No. \n29-9 at 3.  \nRejecting or ignoring this guidance and data—and failing to articulate why local \nconditions are no longer vital policy tools—ACF simply states that it is prioritizing an easy-\nto-follow “clear and transparent policy” and that “children benefit from routine and \npredictability.”  Id.  Again, ACF cites no evidence supporting these conclusory statements in \nrelation to the Rule and does not provide any reasonable, meaningful explanation of the \nRule.  Instead, it implements a one-size-fits-all approach without articulating “a satisfactory \nexplanation for its action including a ‘rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made.’”  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (quoting Burlington, 371 U.S. at 168).  Therefore, \nthe Court does “not defer to the agency’s conclusory or unsupported suppositions.” United \nTechs. Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., 601 F.3d 557, 562–63 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (quoting McDonnell \nDouglas Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of the Air Force, 375 F.3d 1182, 1187 (D.C. Cir. 2004)). \n \n15 Because defendants precluded pre-promulgation comment, they appear to be guessing at the exact \n“burden[]” this will cause local agencies.  Id. at 68,066.  \n– 37 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  3388  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244559900\nThe validity of this conclusion is especially apparent in light of the Rule’s drastic \nchange from past practice.  Although an agency need not always provide a detailed \nexplanation for a new policy, “[s]ometimes it must.”  Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. at \n515.  Supreme Court precedent makes clear that when a new policy “rests upon factual \nfindings that contradict those which underlay its prior policy,” or when an agency’s “prior \npolicy has engendered serious reliance interests,” it is “arbitrary or capricious to ignore such \nmatters.”  Id.  As explained above, the Rule rests on a one-size-fits-all finding that \ncontradicts its prior approach, and the agency’s prior flexibility engendered serious reliance \ninterests.  Thus, “further justification [was] demanded” but not provided, likely rendering \nthe Rule arbitrary and capricious.   \nPlaintiffs also argue that ACF’s failure to establish an end date for the masking and \ntesting requirements was arbitrary and capricious.  In the Rule, ACF offered no explanation \nfor its choice.  See 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,066.  Rather, it only “invites comment” on whether to \nestablish a “finite end date.”  Id.  Defendants argue that ACF decided to not include an end \ndate because “children benefit from routine and predictability.”  Dkt. No. 26 at 31 (quoting \n86 Fed. Reg. at 68,066).  Under a fair reading of the Rule, ACF likely did not offer that \nreason to explain its choice.  And even if it did, it would not support omitting an end date.    \nACF asserts that “children benefit from routine and predictability” not to explain its \nchoice to omit an end date, but to partially explain its decision to impose universal \nmandates without regard to regional transmission rates.  Dkt. No. 26 at 44.  And choosing \nnot to tie “predictability” to the indeterminate duration of the Rule makes sense.  If children \nbenefit from predictability, then imposing an end would serve that purpose.  They would be \nable to predict when they needed to wear a mask and when they did not.  By failing to \n– 38 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  3399  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244559911\ninclude an end date, ACF made the Rule’s duration entirely unpredictable.  Therefore, to \nthe extent ACF actually included an explanation for this choice, it was not “reasonable.”  \nSee generally Prometheus Radio Project, 141 S. Ct. at 1158.  Though this is not a stand-alone \nbasis to invalidate the Rule, when viewed together with the Rule’s overbreadth and change \nin policy, it takes the Secretary’s decision outside “the zone of reasonableness.”  Prometheus \nRadio Project, 141 S. Ct. at 1158. \nB.  Substantial Threat of Irreparable Harm \nThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs cannot show the threat of irreparable harm \nnecessary to entitle them to preliminary injunctive relief.  Dkt. No. 26 at 65.  See Winter, 555 \nU.S. at 20.  “To show irreparable injury if threatened action is not enjoined, it is not \nnecessary to demonstrate that harm is inevitable and irreparable.”  Humana, Inc. v. Jacobson, \n804 F.2d 1390, 1394 (5th Cir. 1986).  Instead, plaintiffs need only show that they are “likely \nto suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief.”  Benisek v. Lamone, 138 S. Ct. \n1942, 1944 (2018). \nThe defendants assert that plaintiffs will not suffer irreparable harm absent an \ninjunction, and due to the lack of injury, they argue in passing that Texas lacks standing.  \nDkt. No. 26 at 66–68 (“To the extent Texas seeks to litigate on its citizens’ behalf, it cannot \ndo so.”).  Regardless of whether that argument has been adequately briefed, the Court has \nan ongoing independent obligation to ensure that the plaintiffs indeed have standing to \ninvoke this Court’s jurisdiction.  E.g., Collins v. Yellen, 141 S. Ct. 1761, 1778–79 (2021); Moler \nv. Wells, 18 F.4th 162, 166 (2021).  And because the standing analysis and the irreparable-\ninjury analysis—an issue both sides fully address—are largely overlapping, the Court will \n– 39 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  4400  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244559922\nconsider together the questions of whether the plaintiffs have standing and whether they risk \nirreparable injury absent the preliminary injunctive relief they seek.   \nFederal courts have jurisdiction over cases or controversies only, and standing is “an \nessential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III.”  Lujan \nv. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992) (citing Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984)).  \n“[S]tanding is not dispensed in gross; rather, plaintiffs must demonstrate standing for each \nclaim that they press and for each form of relief that they seek (for example, injunctive relief \nand damages).”  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2208 (2021).  To demonstrate \nthat federal court is the proper forum for resolving a dispute, the party invoking the federal \nforum—here, the plaintiffs—must demonstrate that the plaintiff suffers an “injury in fact” \nthat is both “concrete and particularized” and “actual or imminent.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n560.  That injury must be “fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant.”  \nId. (alterations in original) (quoting Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rts. Org., 426 U.S. 26, 41–42 \n(1976)).  And it must be “likely”—not speculative or certain—that the injury will be \n“redressed by a favorable decision.”  Id. at 561.  Necessarily then, a plaintiff who lacks \nstanding cannot demonstrate an irreparable injury from the Court’s failure to enjoin the \nchallenged conduct.   \nThe Court takes each aspect of standing in turn. \ni.  Injury \nAn injury is “an invasion of a legally protected interest” that is both “concrete and \nparticularized” and “actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. \nRobins, 578 U.S. 330, 339 (2016) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560).  A concrete injury is one \nthat must “actually exist”—it must be “real, and not abstract.”  Id. at 340.

Ct. at 2204.   \nSimilarly, “under Article III, an injury in law is not an injury in fact.  Only those \nplaintiffs who have been concretely harmed by a defendant’s statutory violation may sue that \nprivate defendant over that violation in federal court.”  Id. at 2205.  So a plaintiff who “is \nmerely seeking to ensure a defendant’s ‘compliance with regulatory law’” does not have \n“grounds for Article III standing” absent some “physical, monetary, or cognizable \nintangible harm traditionally recognized as providing a basis for a lawsuit in American \nCourts.”  Id. at 2206 (quoting Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 345).  An increased regulatory burden \ntypically satisfies the injury-in-fact-requirement.  See Ass’n of Am. R.R.s v. Dep’t of Transp., 38 \nF.3d 582, 586 (D.C. Cir. 1994); cf. Georgia v. Biden, No. 1:21-CV-163, 2021 WL 5779939, *4, \n*11 (S.D. Ga. Dec. 7, 2021) (citing, as an irreparable injury, the administrative burden of \nmerging human-resources and medical data necessitated by an obligation to collect \nvaccination statuses of covered employees). \nBecause states are not normal litigants, see Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 518 \n(2007), the Court analyzes LISD’s and Texas’s injuries separately.   \na.  LISD \nFirst, LISD argues that it faces two forms of irreparable harm: various financial and \noperational harms and the risk of violating state law.   Dkt. No. 8 at 57–58.  Because the \nCourt concludes that the first is sufficient to justify a preliminary injunction to protect LISD, \nit declines to address the second.   \n– 41 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  4422  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244559944\nLISD argues that it will lose staff and students if the Rule goes into effect.  Id.  It \nsupports that argument with declarations from school administrators, parents, and staff.  See \nid. at 58 nn. 55–60.  Should LISD comply with the Rule, it will lose staff and students, \nimpacting its ability to provide services to Head Start students and their families.  Id. at 58; \nDkt. Nos. 8-7 (declaration of an LISD pre-K student’s mother attesting that she will \nunenroll her child); 8-8 (declaration of an LISD employee who attests that he will leave his \nemployment); 8-9 (declaration of LISD Head Start director disclosing that some staff remain \nunvaccinated).  Moreover, those losses will come at a time when the District has struggled \nto fill preexisting staff vacancies—creating new vacancies will exacerbate staff shortages and \nfurther strain resources to the detriment of students.  Dkt. Nos. 8 at 58; 8-9 (noting LISD \n“has already been challenged to secure the current staffing needs”).  And LISD stands to \nlose other funds as well: at least one parent of a non-Head Start student has indicated that \nher child will be withdrawn from LISD’s pre-K program if instructors—who teach mixed \nclassrooms of Head Start and non-Head Start students—are required to wear masks, \ndepriving the District of the tuition dollars paid by that child’s parents.  Dkt. No. 8-7.  \nLosing up to 36 unvaccinated staff16 would also jeopardize LISD’s ability to comply with \nthe staff-student ratios Head Start requires, so even if it chooses to comply with the Rule, it \nmay still lose its Head Start funding.   \nAll of this demonstrates a real and likely injury to LISD’s early education \nprogramming should it comply with the Rule.  And, as a general rule, “a regulation later \nheld invalid almost always produces the irreparable harm of nonrecoverable compliance \n \n16 Of the 152 staff surveyed, 136 responded; 20 responded that they were not vaccinated.  Dkt. No. 8-\n9 at 3.  Assuming, for worst-case-scenario purposes, that all of those who failed to respond were \nunvaccinated yields 36 unvaccinated Head Start staff members.  \n– 42 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  4433  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244559955\ncosts,” Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 433 (5th Cir. 2016) (quoting Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. \nReich, 510 U.S. 200, 220–21 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and in the judgment)), \n“because federal agencies generally enjoy sovereign immunity for any monetary damages,” \nWages & White Lion Invs., L.L.C. v. FDA, 16 F.4th 1130, 1142 (5th Cir. 2021) (citations \nomitted).  So even though LISD might be able to avoid the harms it fears through monetary \nrelief, such relief will never come.  Just as in a situation where the defendant may be \ninsolvent upon final judgment, thus precluding recovery of money damages, see, e.g., In re \nFredeman Litig., 843 F.2d 821, 826–27 (5th Cir.1988) (citations omitted), injunctive relief is \njustified where a regulated entity can never recover its compliance costs.  See LabMD, Inc. v. \nFed. Trade Comm’n, 678 F. App’x 816, 821 (11th Cir. 2016) (finding irreparable harm by \nirrecoverable compliance costs pending appeal); Georgia v. Biden, 2021 WL 5779939 at *4, \n*11 (citing overhead of collecting vaccination data from covered employees); but see Freedom \nHoldings, Inc. v. Spitzer, 408 F.3d 112, 115 (2d Cir. 2005) (“However, ordinary compliance \ncosts are typically insufficient to constitute irreparable harm.”). \nThe harm to LISD if it chooses not to comply with the Rule—if it chooses to reject \nHead Start funding altogether—would be even more serious.  Funding for at least 400 \neligible young children would be withdrawn.  See 8-9 ¶ 4.  The loss of that funding could \nresult in the loss of up to approximately 40% of LISD’s early education programming.17  \nAnd if the loss of a handful of unvaccinated staff members would be harmful, the loss of \ndozens would be catastrophic.  Indeed, the National Head Start Association sent a letter to \nSecretary Becerra on December 15—after the Rule’s promulgation—indicating that the \n \n17 According to its superintendent, LISD currently serves 1,265 children in its pre-K programs, 540 \nof whom (42%) receive Head Start funding.  Dkt. No. 8-3 at 3.   \n– 43 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  4444  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244559966\nRule’s enforcement “could result in the closing of over 1,300 Head Start classrooms” and \nthe loss of nearly “60,000 staff.”  Dkt. No 39-19 at 1, 3. \nRegardless of what LISD chooses, then, the Rule imposes an injury on its ability to \nprovide services to Head Start students.  Either through attrition or the loss of funding, \nLISD will be forced to make do for its students with less.  And, as explained above, any \nadded costs it incurs in trying to do so will be unrecoverable given the immunity enjoyed by \nthe implementing agencies.  The District has therefore shown a likelihood of irreparable \ninjury directly attributable to the Rule’s promulgation.    \nb.  Texas—Head Start Programs \nTexas claims it will suffer two injuries—one to its Head Start programs and one to its \nsovereign interests.  Dkt. No. 8 at 57–61.  Texas Tech University receives funds directly \nfrom HHS for its Early Head Start program, Dkt. No. 8-2 at 2, and therefore stands to lose \nthose funds if the Rule goes into effect and Texas Tech chooses not to comply.  When the \nfederal government’s regulation imposes costs on a State, those costs constitute an \nirreparable injury.  See Texas v. Biden, --- F.4th ---, 2021 WL 5882670, at *53 (5th Cir. Dec. \n13, 2021).  Here, the Rule imposes costs on Texas:  Texas will be obliged to either lose \nfunding for its Head Start programs or bear compliance costs.  Just as LISD faces \nirreparable harm in unrecoverable costs or the loss of funding, so too does Texas.   \nc.  Texas—Sovereign Interests \n“[S]tates have a sovereign interest in ‘the power to create and enforce a legal code.’”  \nTex. Off. of Pub. Util. Couns. v. FCC, 183 F.3d 393, 449 (5th Cir. 1999) (quoting Alfred L. Snapp \n& Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 601 (1982)).  Pursuant to that interest, \nstates may have standing based on (1) federal assertions of authority to regulate matters they \n– 44 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  4455  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244559977\nbelieve they control, (2) federal preemption of state law, and (3) federal interference with the \nenforcement of state law, at least where “the state statute at issue regulate[s] behavior or \nprovide[s] for the administration of a state program” and does not “simply purport [ ] to \nimmunize [state] citizens from federal law.”  Virginia ex rel. Cuccinelli v. Sebelius, 656 F.3d \n253, 269–70 (4th Cir. 2011); see, e.g., Wyoming ex rel. Crank v. United States, 539 F.3d 1236, \n1242 (10th Cir. 2008); Alaska v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 868 F.2d 441, 443–44 (D.C. Cir. 1989); \nOhio ex rel. Celebrezze v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 766 F.2d 228, 232–33 (6th Cir. 1985); cf. \nDiamond v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54, 62 (1986) (commenting that “a State has standing to defend \nthe constitutionality of its statute” but not relying on that principle).  Such intrusions \namount to pressure to change state law. \nAn injury to a state’s sovereign interest is “necessarily” irreparable.  See, e.g., Planned \nParenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott, 734 F.3d 406, 419 (5th Cir. 2013).  \nAnd a state’s interest “in not being pressured to change its law” is sufficiently “related to its \nsovereignty” for these purposes.  Texas v. United States, 787 F.3d 733, 752 n.38 (5th Cir. \n2015).  Indeed, irreparable harm exists when a federal regulation prevents a state from \nenforcing its duly enacted laws.  See, e.g., Abbott v. Perez, 138 S. Ct. 2305, 2324 n.17 (2018) \n(citing Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers)) (“[T]he inability \nto enforce its duly enacted plan clearly inflicts irreparable harm on the State.”); King, 567 \nU.S. at 1303 (quoting New Motor Vehicle Bd. of Cal. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 434 U.S. 1345, 1351 \n(1977) (Rehnquist, C.J., in chambers)) (“Any time [a state is blocked] from effectuating \nstatutes enacted by representatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable injury.”); \nNew Motor, 434 U.S. at 1351 (“It also seems to me that any time a State is enjoined by a \ncourt from effectuating statutes enacted by representatives of its people, it suffers a form of \n– 45 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  4466  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244559988\nirreparable injury.”).  The distinction between a statute and an executive order is, for today’s \npurposes, immaterial.  See Tex. Gov’t Code § 418.012; accord E.T. v. Paxton, --- F.4th ---, \n2021 WL 5629045, *6 (5th Cir. Dec. 1, 2021) (“While this case centers on an executive \norder issued by the Governor under his emergency authority rather than enforcement of a \nstatute enacted by the plenary legislative authority of the people, the same reasoning \napplies.”) (cleaned up). \nTexas has elected to prohibit governmental entities from requiring masks or vaccines.  \nThe clear effect of the Rule is to inhibit Texas’s sovereign policy-making and, importantly, \nenforcement powers.  Texas officials who are obliged to enforce Texas law will be forced to \ndecide whether to fine school districts and officials who choose to comply with the \nregulations simply to avoid losing Head Start funding.  The net effect of the Rule is likely to \nbe increased pressure to amend, or at least decline to enforce, Texas’s laws.  Texas therefore \nsuffers an irreparable injury to its sovereign interests by dint of the Rule’s enforcement.   \nd.  Texas—Parens Patriae \nTexas argues that it, as parens patriae for its citizens, suffers an irreparable injury from \nthe Rule’s enforcement.  “To have [parens patriae], standing the State must assert an injury to \nwhat has been characterized as a ‘quasi-sovereign’ interest, which is a judicial construct that \ndoes not lend itself to a simple or exact definition.”  Alfred L. Snapp, 458 U.S. at 601.  Three \ncases guide the Court’s understanding of a state’s parens patriae interests.    \nFirst, in Massachusetts v. Mellon, the Supreme Court made clear that states do not have \nparens patriae standing to protect their citizens from the operation of federal law.  262 U.S. \n447, 485 (1923).  Mellon involved a challenge to the Shepphard-Towner Maternity and \nInfancy Act, a federal law enacted under President Harding to reduce infant and maternal \n– 46 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  4477  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244559999\nmortality.  Id. at 479.  The Act operated by providing funds—with strings—to state health \nagencies.  Id.  States that did not restructure their operations in accordance with the federal \ngovernment’s conditions lost federal funding.  Id. at 479–82.  Massachusetts sued then-\nTreasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, the official responsible for disbursing the funds, arguing \nthat the act unconstitutionally legislated “for purposes not national, but local to the states.”  \nId. at 479.   \nThe court rejected Massachusetts’s challenge.  Id. at 488–89.  The court concluded \nthat Massachusetts sought the court’s decision as to an “abstract question[] of political \npower”—not a case or controversy.  Id. at 485.  The court also concluded that \nMassachusetts could not bring suit “as the representative of its citizens”—as parens patriae.  \nId.  Because “the citizens of Massachusetts are also citizens of the United States,” \nMassachusetts had no “duty or power to enforce their rights in respect of their relations with \nthe federal government.”  Id. at 485–86.  Instead, it was the United States—whose laws are \nsupreme under the Constitution—who was the citizens’ parens patriae.  Id. at 486.   \nSix decades later, in Alfred L. Snapp, the court refined the so-called Mellon bar.  458 \nU.S. 592.  While reaffirming Mellon’s core rule, the court restricted it:  a state does have \nstanding to assert its “quasi-sovereign interests” against the federal government.  Id. at 607–\n08, 610 n.16.  Quasi-sovereign interests defy easy exemplification, but the Court defined \nthem as a state’s interests “in the health and well-being—both physical and economic—of its \n– 47 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  4488  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244660000\nresidents in general,” as well as a state’s “interest in not being discriminatorily denied its \nrightful status within the federal system.”18  Id. at 607. \nIn 2007, the court once again took up the question of parens patriae standing.  In \nMassachusetts v. EPA, the court held that Massachusetts had standing to challenge the EPA’s \nfailure to regulate greenhouse gasses under the authority granted to it by the Clean Air Act.  \n549 U.S. at 526.  The majority stated that Mellon did not adopt a broad bar on parens patriae \nstanding because the Mellon court was not “called upon to adjudicate . . . quasi-sovereign \nrights actually invaded or threatened.”  Id. at 520 n.17 (emphasis in original).  The majority \ncontinued that there was a “critical difference between allowing a State ‘to protect her \ncitizens from the operation of federal statutes’ (which is what Mellon prohibits) and allowing \na State to assert its rights under federal law (which it has standing to do).”  Id. (citing Georgia \nv. Pa. R. Co., 324 U.S. 439, 447 (1945)).  Accordingly, the Court concluded that since \nMassachusetts sought to invoke its own rights under the Clean Air Act rather than its \ncitizens’, it had standing.  See id. at 522–23, 526. \nThe law today is clear that a state has parens patriae standing when a state “assert[s] \nits rights under federal law” but lacks standing when it seeks only to “protect her citizens \nfrom the operation of federal statutes.”  Id. at 520 n.17.  And the “rights” under federal law \na state may protect encompass two general categories of “quasi-sovereign” interests: those \n“in the health and well-being—both physical and economic—of its residents in general,” \n \n18 The Court notes, as others have, that the language in Alfred L. Snapp that “[a] State does not have \nstanding as parens patriae to bring an action against the federal government” is technically dictum \nbut, like others, takes the statement at face value for the purposes of this analysis.  458 U.S. 592 at \n610 n.16. \n– 48 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  4499  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244660011\nand those “in not being discriminatorily denied its rightful status within the federal system.”  \nAlfred L. Snapp, 548 U.S. at 607. \nWith that understanding, the Court concludes that Texas has parens patriae standing.  \nTexas alleges that the Rule’s enforcement will lead to dramatic declines in Head Start \nofferings, adversely impacting students and their families.  The plaintiffs have supported \nthese allegations with declarations from school officials in metropolitan and rural areas \nalike, along with extensive evidence of the millions of dollars in funding that are at stake in \nthe dispute.  It is difficult to imagine what could qualify as interests “in the health and well-\nbeing—both physical and economic—of its residents in general” sufficient to confer parens \npatriae standing if not the adverse impact on needy children across the state.  Id. \nThe defendants contends that the state lacks parens patriae standing to protect those \nwho might be subject to the mask and vaccine requirements.  Dkt. No. 26 at 66–68.  That \nmay be so.  It is blackletter law that states lack standing to protect their citizens from the \neffects of federal laws.  Mellon, 262 U.S. at 485.  But because the Court concludes that Texas \nhas a parens patriae interest in protecting the welfare of its neediest children, the Court need \nnot resolve the thorny issue of whether Texas has standing as parens patriae for Head Start \nstaff.   \ne.  Texas—Statutory Interests \nAlthough Texas does not raise its rights under the APA as a form of irreparable \ninjury, given the Court’s conclusions about notice and comment, the Court concludes that \nTexas suffers another form of irreparable injury by being denied its procedural right to \ncomment on the Rule.  Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d 433, 447 (5th Cir. 2019) (“A violation of \nthe APA’s notice-and-comment requirements is one example of a deprivation of a \n– 49 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  5500  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244660022\nprocedural right.”).  The Rule undercuts Texas’s interest in ensuring compliance with its \nlaws prohibiting state entities from requiring vaccines or masks; they affect Texas’s ability to \nenforce its own laws.  See supra Part 3.B.i.c.  And only by enjoining the Rule’s \nenforcement—with the expectation that the Secretary may try again, this time allowing for \nnotice and comment before promulgation—will Texas’s procedural rights under the APA be \nprotected.  Thus, the denial of Texas’s opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process \nthrough notice and comment is another form of irreparable injury.   \nii.  Traceability \nWhere “a causal relation between injury and challenged action depends upon the \ndecision of an independent third party . . . standing is not precluded, but it is ordinarily \nsubstantially more difficult to establish.”  California v. Texas, 141 S. Ct. 2104, 2117 (2021) \n(internal quotations omitted) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562 and citing Clapper v. Amnesty \nInt’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 413 (2013)).  The plaintiffs therefore must “adduce facts showing \nthat [the choices of the relevant third parties] have been or will be made in such manner as \nto produce causation.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562.   \nThat the plaintiffs have brought forth specific evidence and examples of how they \nwill be harmed by the Rule’s enforcement distinguishes this case from others where a third \nparty’s actions might have hurt the plaintiff.  See, e.g., California, 141 S. Ct. at 2118–19 (“The \nstate plaintiffs have failed to show that the challenged minimum essential coverage \nprovision, without any prospect of penalty, will harm them by leading more individuals to \nenroll in these programs.”) (emphasis added); Allen, 468 U.S. at 738 (“[I]t is entirely \nspeculative whether withdrawal of a particular school’s tax exemption would lead the \nschool to change its [racially discriminatory] policies.  It is just as speculative whether any \n– 50 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  5511  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244660033\ngiven parent of a child attending such a private school would decide to transfer the child to \npublic school as a result of any changes in educational or financial policy made by the \nprivate school once it was threatened with loss of tax-exempt status.” (citation omitted)); \nClapper, 568 U.S. at 413 (“[E]ven if respondents could show that the Government will seek \n[the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court’s] authorization to acquire the communications \nof respondents’ foreign contacts . . . respondents can only speculate as to whether [that \ncourt] will authorize such surveillance.” (emphasis added)). \nThis case, then, is akin to Department of Commerce v. New York.  139 S. Ct. 2551 \n(2019).  There, traceability turned on the guess that “third parties will likely react in \npredictable ways” to the challenged regulation.  Id. at 2566.  So too here.  Head Start \nteachers at LISD have indicated that they do not want to be vaccinated against COVID-19.  \nOne has indicated—predictably—that if put to the choice of his profession or his decision to \nremain unvaccinated, he will choose the latter.  The traceability demanded by the standing \ninquiry ask only whether an injury is “fairly traceable” to the defendant the plaintiff has \nchosen to sue.  Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 338.  That link “requires no more than de facto causality.”  \nNew York, 139 S. Ct. at 2256.  The defendant’s actions need not be the “very last step in the \nchain of causation.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997).  Thus, far from speculation \nabout nebulous future harms, the harms LISD and Texas describe are “the predictable effect \nof Government action on the decisions of third parties.”  New York, 139 S. Ct. at 2256 (citing \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 169–70).  Notwithstanding the involvement of third parties in the \nequation, traceability is satisfied.   \n– 51 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  5522  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244660044\niii.  Redressability \nRedressability requires a simple enough inquiry:  if the Court enjoins the Rule’s \nenforcement, is it likely that the harm the plaintiffs portend will come to pass?  The answer \nhere is equally straightforward:  no.  So redressability, too, is satisfied.   \nTo elaborate:  The plaintiff must show only that its injury is “likely to be redressed by \na favorable decision.”  Vill. of Arlington Heights, v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 262 \n(1977) (quoting Simon, 426 U.S. at 38).  And to redress an injury, the Court’s remedy must \n“personally . . . benefit [the plaintiff] in a tangible way.”  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 508 \n(1975).  Here, both are true of the relief the plaintiffs seek—an injunction preventing the \nenforcement of the challenged regulations.  The Rule aims to add conditions to grants given \nto Head Start providers.  If the Rule were to go into effect, the government could terminate \ngrants to providers who do not adopt the Rule’s vaccine and mask requirements.  If the \ngovernment cannot enforce the conditions, however, the participants are free to maintain \nthe status quo without jeopardizing their Head Start funding.  That would allow LISD to \ncontinue to, for example, employ in Head Start classrooms teachers who are unmasked or \nunvaccinated, thus avoiding the need to reassign or terminate employees and find \nreplacements.  An injunction barring enforcement of the challenged regulations would \ntherefore remedy the plaintiffs’ harms.   \nC.  Balance of Harms and the Public Interest \nThe third and fourth requirements for issuance of a preliminary injunction—the \nbalance of harms and whether the requested injunction will serve the public interest—\n“merge when the Government is the opposing party.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 \n(2009).  Therefore, the Court considers them together.  The Court “must balance the \n– 52 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  5533  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244660055\ncompeting claims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting or \nwithholding of the requested relief.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 24 (citing Amoco Prod. Co. v. Vill. Of \nGambell, 480 U.S. 531, 542 (1987)).  \nHere, the equities and public interest cut both ways, but ultimately favor plaintiffs.  \nThe Rule will likely cause further staff shortages to the existing hiring crisis, loss of funding, \nand program closures.  Dkt. Nos. 8-3; 8-7; 8-8; 8-9.  The Secretary recognizes these risks.  86 \nFed. Reg. 68,091 (“There are already significant challenges in recruiting and retaining staff \namong early care and education providers including Head Start and the requirements in this \nrule could exacerbate this issue.”).  As a result, children who have previously received pre-K \nHead Start services and funding will be prevented from participating in “an essential part of \npreparing children, particularly children living in poverty, for success in school and life.”  \nDkt. No. 8-3 ¶ 8; see also 86 Fed Reg. at 68,057 (outlining several other harms to children \nand families due to program closures).   \nFurthermore, local programs have serious reliance interests on preserving the status \nquo of local flexibility.  The Rule constitutes a drastic change from this “precedent.”  See \nDkt. No. 39-19 at 1.  As the National Head Start Association explained in its recent letter to \nthe Secretary, “Head Start’s strength has come from the flexibility of local practices that \nenables programs to meet community and family needs.”  Id.   \nOn the other hand, reducing the spread of COVID-19 is critical to public health.  See \n86 Fed. Reg. at 68,055.  And COVID-19 transmission could also lead to program closures. \nId. at 68,056–57.  But given the relatively high vaccination rate of staff, the risk of program \nclosures may be greater under the Rule than in its absence.   \n– 53 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  5544  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244660066\nAdditionally, the “public interest is in having governmental agencies abide by the \nfederal laws that govern their existence and operations.” Wages & White Lion, 16 F.4th at \n1143 (quoting Texas v. Biden, 10 F.4th 538, 559 (5th Cir. 2021)).  Here, the Court finds that \nthere is a substantial likelihood that the Secretary issued the Rule unlawfully.  And \ngenerally, there is “no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.”  League \nof Women Voters of the U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (citing Pursuing Am.’s \nGreatness v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 831 F.3d 500, 511 (D.C. Cir. 2016), and Gordon v. Holder, \n721 F.3d 638, 653 (D.C. Cir. 2013)). \nIn sum, the Court finds that the balance of equities and the public interest weigh in \nfavor of granting plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction. \n4.  Scope of Relief \nTexas seeks a nationwide injunction.  Dkt. No. 38 at 29.  During the hearing, \ncounsel for Texas argued that nationwide relief was necessary because the APA instructs \ncourts to “set aside” unlawful agency action.  Tr. at 90–91; see generally 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A), (C).  In light of Fifth Circuit precedent and the record before it, the Court \ndeclines to issue a nationwide injunction.  Instead, the Court will limit the scope of its \ninjunction based on the parties and evidence.  The Interim Final Rule’s implementation and \nenforcement will be enjoined in Texas. \nThe Fifth Circuit recently addressed the proper scope of injunctions when reviewing \na nationwide injunction.  Becerra, 2021 WL 5913302 at *2–3.  A district court enjoined \nnationwide the enforcement of the Secretary’s vaccination mandate for Medicare- and \nMedicaid-certified providers.  Id.  The Fifth Circuit narrowed the injunction to the 14 \nplaintiff states, reiterating that an injunction’s scope must be justified by the circumstances.  \n– 54 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  5555  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244660077\nId. at *2–3 (citing Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 188 (5th Cir. 2015), aff’d by an equally \ndivided court sub nom. United States v. Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2271, 2272 (2016)).  The panel \nexplained that “[p]rinciples of judicial restraint control here,” and noted that “[o]ther courts \nare considering these same issues, with several courts already and inconsistently ruling.”  Id. \nat *2.  And while nationwide injunctions are permissible in the immigration context due to \nthe constitutional command for uniform immigration laws and the concern that limited \nimmigration injunctions would be ineffective, that does not mean that “nationwide \ninjunctions are required or even the norm.”  Id.; see also Texas, 809 F.3d at 187–88 (affirming \nnationwide injunction of DAPA in immigration context because the Constitution requires a \nuniform rule of naturalization).   \nHere, similar circumstances counsel against a nationwide injunction.  As in Louisiana \nv. Becerra, the Court faces an issue that, unlike immigration, does not have a constitutional \ncommand for nationwide uniformity.  Moreover, as in Louisiana v. Becerra, the same issues \nare considered in two other cases, both in the Western District of Louisiana:  Louisiana v. \nBecerra, No. 3:21-CV-04370 (W.D. La.); Brick v. Biden, No. 2: 21-CV-04386 (W.D. La.).  In \nthe former case, over 20 states challenge the Head Start mandates, and the court has yet to \nissue its decision.  Louisiana v. Becerra, Dkt. No. 1, No. 3:21-CV-04370 (W.D. La.).  In \ncontrast, this Court has only two plaintiffs before it—Texas and a Texas school district, \nLISD.  Dkt. No. 1 at 1.  Furthermore, the great majority of evidence before the Court is \nlimited to harm caused to Head Start programs in Texas.  See Dkt. Nos. 8-2, 8-3, 8-4, 8-5, 8-\n6, 8-7, 8-8, and 8-9; but see, e.g., Dkt. Nos. 39-15; 39-19.  Thus, the Court concludes that the \ncircumstances do not justify or require a nationwide injunction; rather, it will follow Fifth \nCircuit precedent and limit the injunction based on the parties, issues, and evidence before \n– 55 – \n\nCCaassee  55::2211--ccvv--0000330000--HH      DDooccuummeenntt  4422      FFiilleedd  1122//3311//2211        PPaaggee  5566  ooff  5566      PPaaggeeIIDD  2244660088\nit.  Louisiana v. Becerra, 2021 WL 5913302 at *2-3; see also Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. New York, \n140 S. Ct. 599, 600 (2020) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (“Equitable remedies, like remedies in \ngeneral, are meant to redress the injuries sustained by a particular plaintiff in a particular \nlawsuit.”).  The Court’s injunction is therefore limited to Texas.   \n5.  Conclusion \nFor all the above reasons, the Court grants the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction.  The Court orders that defendants are preliminarily enjoined from implementing \nand enforcing the Interim Final Rule with Comment Period, Vaccine and Mask \nRequirements to Mitigate the Spread of COVID-19 in Head Start Programs, 86 Fed. Reg. \n68,052 (Nov. 30, 2021), in the state of Texas pending a trial on the merits of this action or \nuntil further order of this Court.  Defendants shall immediately cease all implementation or \nenforcement of the Interim Final Rule with Comment Period as to any Head Start program \nwithin the State of Texas.  Because defendants have appeared and the Court conducted a \nhearing on plaintiffs’ motion, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b) no longer applies.  See \ne.g., New England Health Care, Emps. Union, Dist. 1199, SEIU/AFL-CIO v. Rowland, 170 F. \nSupp. 2d 199, 201 n.2 (D. Conn. 2001) (denying TRO as moot in light of the hearing on the \npreliminary motion).  Therefore, the Court denies plaintiffs’ request for a temporary \nrestraining order as moot. \nThe Court further orders that no security bond shall be required under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 65(c). \nSo ordered on December 31, 2021 \n            ____________________________________ \n            JAMES WESLEY HENDRIX \n            UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n– 56 – ",

No. 5:21-CV-300-H \nXAVIER BECERRA, Secretary of Health   \nand Human Services, et al., \n \n  Defendants.   \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \nIn response to the President’s plan to increase COVID-19 vaccinations, the Department \nof Health and Human Services created two unprecedented conditions on funding for Head \nStart programs, which provide education-related services to needy children.  HHS’s new rule \nmandated COVID-19 vaccination for staff and near-universal masking.  Because there was a \nsubstantial likelihood that the agency’s action was unauthorized and procedurally improper, \nthe Court preliminarily enjoined implementation and enforcement of the rule.  HHS did not \nappeal, and it has since removed the masking requirement, but the vaccine mandate remains.  \nNow, both sides seek summary judgment.  The parties largely restate arguments made during \nthe preliminary-injunction stage, in addition to briefing the effect of Biden v. Missouri, which \nissued after the Court’s injunction and upheld HHS’s healthcare-worker vaccine mandate.  \nAfter careful consideration—and because Biden v. Missouri involved materially different \nstatutory text and context—the Court reaches the same conclusion it did earlier.  The Court \ngrants summary judgment for the plaintiffs because (1) no permissible construction of the Head \nStart Act could authorize the rule; (2) HHS failed to follow proper rulemaking procedures; and \n(3) the rule is arbitrary and capricious.  Thus, the Court vacates the rule, and binding precedent \nmakes clear that vacatur should not be limited to the parties but is rather universal.  \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 2 of 69   PageID 25328\nThe wisdom of Head Start’s rule is not before the Court—only its legality.  If the \npeople, through Congress, wish to impose a vaccine mandate on Head Start programs, they \nmay do so by passing a law.  But an agency can do only what Congress authorizes it to do.  \nRegardless of how well intentioned, HHS’s attempt here to shoehorn the vaccine mandate into \nstatutory language authorizing modification of Head Start’s administrative, financial, and \nfacility-management standards goes too far.  Equally fatal to the rule is the agency’s decision to \nimplement it without the necessary public notice and comment, consultation with \nstakeholders, and reasonable explanation.  Under these circumstances, the law requires the \nCourt to vacate the rule and remand the matter to HHS. \n1.  Factual and Procedural Background \nA.  Head Start \nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) offers grants to schools, \nnonprofits, and other local organizations to run Head Start programs.  Those programs \n“promote the school readiness of low-income children” by creating supportive learning \nenvironments and providing educational, nutritional, social, health, and other services to \nyoung children and their families.  42 U.S.C. § 9831.  Many Head Start programs are \noperated through local school districts, like Lubbock Independent School District (LISD), in \nthe form of pre-K classes.  See, e.g., Dkt. No. 1-3 at 3.  Texas Tech operates an Early Head \nStart program, which is offered for children under age three.  Dkt. No. 1-4 at 2; see 42 \nU.S.C. § 9840a.  In 2021, HHS awarded $842,280,184 in grants to Texas Head Start \nprograms.  Dkt. No. 1-2 at 35.  LISD and Texas Tech University received a portion of this \nfunding for their programs.  Id. at 2, 9–10, 17, 20, 26, 30, 33.   \n– 2 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 3 of 69   PageID 25329\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Office of Head Start (OHS) allowed \nlocal providers to adjust their services as necessary depending on community conditions and \nneeds.  Dkt. Nos. 5-9 at 2–3; 27 at 4 (listing the OHS May 2021 guidance in the \nadministrative record); 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,058 n.66 (citing the guidance in the interim final \nrule).  In its May 2021 guidance, the agency recognized that “[t]o date, OHS [has] provided \nneeded flexibilities and guidance that allowed programs to adapt services based on the \nchanging health conditions in their communities.”  Dkt. No. 56 at 91.  As a result, while \nsome Head Start programs offered virtual and remote services, “[m]any programs continued \nto provide in-person services for children and families throughout the COVID-19 \npandemic.”  Id.  OHS knew, however, that “virtual and remote services . . . are not an \nacceptable replacement for in-person comprehensive services.”  Id. at 92.  In fact, OHS \nreported that “[a]lmost one third of children served in Head Start programs before the \npandemic—approximately 250,000—ha[d] not received services to date.”  Id. at 93.  Thus, \nOHS’s May 2021 guidance instructed its in-person programs “to continue serving children \nin person, as local health conditions allow.”  Id. at 91.  OHS also made clear that the virtual \nprograms “[we]re expected to move to in-person services, as local health conditions allow.”  \nId. at 92.   \nAccording to the CDC, OHS’s flexible, community-level approach to early \nchildhood education during the pandemic was successful.  As the CDC stated in its report, \n“[s]ince the COVID-19 pandemic started, Head Start and Early Head Start programs \nsuccessfully implemented CDC-recommended mitigation strategies and applied other \ninnovative approaches to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission among children, teachers, and \n– 3 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 4 of 69   PageID 25330\nother staff members by allowing maximum program flexibility and allocating financial and \nhuman resources.”1 \nIn the 2020–21 school year, LISD implemented a mask mandate in line with \nGovernor Abbott’s Executive Order and Texas Education Agency public-health guidance.  \nDkt. 1-3 at ¶ 4.  Masks were required for students in fourth grade and above.  Id.  In the \n2021–22 school year, however, LISD decided that masks would be welcome and \nvaccinations encouraged, but neither would be mandatory.  Id. at ¶ 5–6.  Before the school \nyear began, 84% of LISD’s staff reported having received at least one vaccine dose.  Id. at \n¶ 6.  Of 1,847 active cases since August 18, 2021, 26 were pre-K students and none were pre-\nK staff.  Id. at ¶ 5. \nB.  The Vaccine Mandate   \nOn September 9, 2021, the President announced “a new plan to require more \nAmericans to be vaccinated.”2  Stating that “our patience is wearing thin” with the \nunvaccinated, the President asserted that “we must increase vaccinations among the \nunvaccinated with new vaccination requirements.”  Id.  Those requirements would apply to \nemployers with 100 or more employees, healthcare workers, executive branch federal \nemployees, and “all of nearly 300,000 educators” in the Head Start program.  Id.  The \nPresident did not hide the fact that his school-related mandate “takes on elected officials and \nstates,” explaining that “if these governors won’t help us beat the pandemic, I’ll use my \npower as President to get them out of the way.”  Id. \n \n1 CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (Dec. 11, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/ \nvolumes/69/wr/mm6949e3.htm [https://perma.cc/LY6K-ZS7Y] (available at Dkt. No. 29-9). \n2 Joseph Biden, Remarks by President Biden on Fighting the COVID-19 Pandemic (Sept. 9, 2021), \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/09/remarks-by-\npresident-biden-on-fighting-the-covid-19-pandemic-3/ [https://perma.cc/VW2F-3Z47]. \n– 4 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 5 of 69   PageID 25331\nOn November 30, 2021, the Administration for Children and Families (ACF)—a \ndivision of HHS—issued an Interim Final Rule with Comment (Rule) imposing mask and \nCOVID-19 vaccine mandates in Head Start programs.  See Vaccine and Mask Requirements \nto Mitigate the Spread of COVID-19 in Head Start Programs, 86 Fed. Reg. 68,052 (Nov. 30, \n2021) (to be codified at 45 C.F.R. pt. 1302).  As its name suggests, the Rule’s stated purpose \nis “to protect the health and safety of Head Start staff, children, and families and to mitigate \nthe spread of SARS–CoV–2 in Head Start programs.”  Id. at 68,053. \nACF promulgated the Rule by adding the mandates to existing “Head Start Program \nPerformance Standards.”  Id. at 68,052.  Specifically, the Rule required “universal masking \nfor all individuals aged 2 years and older,” with limited exceptions, in all indoor settings \nwhere Head Start services are provided and in Head Start vehicles.  Id. at 68,060.  And “for \nthose not fully vaccinated,” masks were required “outdoors in crowded settings or during \nactivities that involve sustained close contact with other people.”  Id.   \nThe Rule also requires “all Head Start staff, certain contractors, and volunteers in \nclassrooms or working directly with children to be fully vaccinated,” with certain \nexemptions.4  Id.  For those granted an exemption from the vaccine requirement, weekly \nCOVID-19 testing is required.  Id. at 68,061. \nThe Rule took effect immediately—November 30, 2021—before public notice-and-\ncomment procedures were followed.  Citing the threat posed by rising COVID-19 cases and \nthe hope to return fully to in-person instruction in 2022, the Secretary found that there was \n \n4 Exemptions are available “for those (i) for whom a vaccine is medically contraindicated, (ii) for \nwhom medical necessity requires a delay in vaccination, or (iii) who are legally entitled to an \naccommodation with regard to the COVID–19 vaccination requirement based on an applicable \nFederal law.”  Id. at 68,061 (footnotes omitted).  Accommodations based on federal law may be \ngranted for “a disability under the ADA, medical condition, or sincerely held religious beliefs, \npractice, or observance.”  Id. \n– 5 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 6 of 69   PageID 25332\n“good cause” to waive the notice-and-comment procedures normally required when an \nagency promulgates a regulation.  See id. at 68,059 (finding good cause to waive notice-and-\ncomment procedures).  The mask requirement was effective immediately, while the vaccine \nmandate required compliance by January 31, 2022.  Id. at 68,060–62.  Programs that refused \nto implement the Rule’s dual mandates risked losing their Head Start funding entirely.  See \n42 U.S.C. § 9836a(e)(1)(C); 45 C.F.R. § 1304.5 (2023) (“Termination and denial of \nrefunding”).   \nC.  This Litigation  \nPlaintiffs—the State of Texas and LISD—filed this action on December 10, 2021, \nseeking a Court order enjoining the Rule’s enforcement and setting aside the Rule.  Dkt. \nNo. 1.  The plaintiffs allege that several statutory and constitutional defects render the Rule \nprocedurally and substantively invalid.  Id.  Just a few days later, the plaintiffs filed a motion \nseeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction.  Dkt. Nos. 6; 8.  The \ndefendants then appeared through counsel.  Dkt. No. 14.  The Court set an expedited \nbriefing schedule (Dkt. No. 15) and held an evidentiary hearing to allow the parties to offer \nevidence and argument (Dkt. Nos. 40; 41).   \nDuring the evidentiary hearing, the defendants made several relevant concessions.  \nFirst, they noted that the vaccine and mask mandates are not “health services” within the \nmeaning of the Head Start Act.  Dkt. No. 41 at 40.  Second, they explained that the agency \ndid not assert that the Rule was or could be authorized under 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(A), \nwhich are “performance standards with respect to services required to be provided, \nincluding health . . . services.”  Id. at 40–41.  Third, although the defendants did argue that \nthe Rule could be authorized as an “administrative” standard under subsection (C), they \n– 6 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 7 of 69   PageID 25333\nadmitted that it could not qualify as a “financial management standard.”  Id. at 48.  And \nfinally, the defendants conceded that, while other health services made available to children \nby Head Start are “strongly encouraged,” this is the first time that Head Start has ever \nmandated a “health procedure” as a precondition to new or ongoing employment.  Id. at \n45–47.  The defendants admitted that the Rule is unprecedented, although they asserted that \nit is justified by an unprecedented pandemic.  Id. at 52, 55–58. \nFollowing the evidentiary hearing, the Court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a \npreliminary injunction in a 56-page order and preliminarily enjoined the defendants from \nimplementing and enforcing the Rule.6  Dkt. No. 42.  The Court concluded that “there is a \nsubstantial likelihood that the mandates do not fit within the Head Start Act’s authorizing \ntext, [] HHS failed to follow the APA in promulgating the mandates, and [] the mandates \nare arbitrary and capricious.”  Id. at 1.  \nNotably, the deadline to appeal the preliminary injunction came and passed, and the \ndefendants did not appeal.  Dkt. No. 45.  Thereafter, the Court ordered a joint status report \n(id.), and the parties informed the Court that they intended to forego discovery and proceed \nto the summary judgment stage (Dkt. No. 46). \nThe defendants subsequently filed a Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) (Dkt. No. 48), a Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. \nNo. 49), and their Brief in Support of Their Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, \nMotion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 52).  The defendants assert that Texas does not \nhave standing because it has not suffered an injury in fact.  Dkt. No. 52 at 24–27.  They also \n \n6 The plaintiffs’ motion for a TRO was denied as moot in light of the preliminary injunction.  Dkt. \nNo. 42 at 56. \n– 7 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 8 of 69   PageID 25334\nallege that the plaintiffs have failed to state a claim or, alternatively, that the defendants are \nentitled to summary judgment.  Id. at 27–68.  In their view, the Secretary had statutory \nauthority to issue the Rule (id. at 27–41), the Rule is not arbitrary and capricious (id. at 41–\n54), and the Secretary had good cause to issue the Rule before the typical advance notice-\nand-comment period occurred (id. at 58).  Furthermore, the defendants claim that the Rule \ndoes not violate other constitutional or statutory provisions.  Id. at 63–68.  Thus, they \nrequest that the Court “dismiss the [c]omplaint, or in the alternative, enter summary \njudgment in favor of the [d]efendants.”  Id. at 68.   \nThe plaintiffs also filed a Motion for Summary Judgment and an accompanying \nbrief.  Dkt. Nos. 54; 54-1.  They assert that the Rule lacks statutory authority and is arbitrary \nand capricious in violation of the APA.  Dkt. No. 54-1 at 11–38, 47–49.  In addition, the \nSecretary did not follow proper rulemaking procedures when promulgating the Rule.  Id. at \n38–41.  According to the plaintiffs, the Secretary did not follow the procedures set forth by \nthe Head Start Act for modifying standards.  Id.  Furthermore, because the Secretary lacked \ngood cause, the Rule was adopted in violation of the notice-and-comment requirement.  Id. \nat 41–44.  Moreover, the plaintiffs allege that the Rule violates other statutes and various \nconstitutional doctrines.  Id. at 44–47, 49–52.  For these reasons, they ask that the Court \nhold the Rule unlawful, set it aside under the APA, and enjoin enforcement of the Rule.  Id. \nat 52–53.  The motions have been fully briefed and are ripe for review.  Dkt. Nos. 58; 59; 60; \n61; 63; 64.   \nIn January 2023, however, after the motions had been filed, the defendants filed a \nNotice of Final Rule Addressing Masking Requirement, informing the Court that HHS had \npublished the Final Rule, which “modifies portions of the interim final rule challenged in \n– 8 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 9 of 69   PageID 25335\nthis litigation.”  Dkt. No. 68 at 1; see Mitigating the Spread of COVID-19 in Head Start \nPrograms, 88 Fed. Reg. 993 (Jan. 6, 2021) (to be codified at 45 C.F.R. pt. 1302).  The Final \nRule “removes the requirement for universal masking for all individuals ages 2 and older.”  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 993.  It also requires that Head Start Programs “have an evidence-based \nCOVID-19 mitigation policy” that takes “local conditions,” among other factors, into \nconsideration.  Id. at 994–95.  This “allows the rule to continue to be relevant and up to date \nas the level of COVID-19 impact in communities changes.”  Id. at 995.  Nevertheless, the \nFinal Rule does not “address the vaccination and testing requirement, which is still under \nreview.”  Id.  at 993.  And while the Final Rule discusses comments relating to the mask \nmandate, it does not address any of the comments pertaining to the vaccine requirement.  \nSee id. at 996–99. \nInstead, the Final Rule states that “[t]he vaccine requirement” imposed by the Rule \ncontinues to “remain[] in effect.”  Id. at 993, 1001; see also 45 C.F.R. §§ 1302.93, 1302.94.  \nUnder the Rule, Head Start staff continue to remain subject to the vaccine mandate, and \nprograms that do not enforce the vaccine requirement are still at risk of losing funding.  See \n86 Fed. Reg. at 68,060; 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(e)(1)(C); 45 C.F.R. § 1304.5 (2023) \n(“Termination and denial of refunding”).  The parties do not dispute that the Rule’s vaccine \nmandate remains in effect and is ripe for the Court’s decision.  See Dkt. No. 68 at 1.   \n2.  Standards of Review \nA.  12(b)(1) Motion to Dismiss \n  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), a party may file a motion \nchallenging the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction to hear a case.  Ramming v. United States, \n281 F.3d 158, 161 (5th Cir. 2001).  A court must dismiss the case if it “lacks the statutory or \n– 9 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 10 of 69   PageID 25336\nconstitutional power to adjudicate the case.” Krim v. pcOrder.com, Inc., 402 F.3d 489, 494 \n(5th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted).  Federal courts have jurisdiction over cases or \ncontroversies only, and standing is “an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-\ncontroversy requirement of Article III.”  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992) \n(citing Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984)).  “[S]tanding is not dispensed in gross; \nrather, plaintiffs must demonstrate standing for each claim that they press and for each form \nof relief that they seek.”  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2208 (2021).  To \ndemonstrate that federal court is the proper forum for resolving a dispute, the party invoking \nthe federal forum—here, the plaintiffs—must show  \n(1)  [they]  ha[ve]  suffered  an  ‘injury  in  fact’  that  is  (a)  concrete  and \nparticularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; \n(2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant[s]; and \n(3) it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed \nby a favorable decision.”  \n   \nGilbert v. Donahoe, 751 F.3d 303, 312 (5th Cir. 2014).   \n“The burden of proof for a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss is on the party asserting \njurisdiction.  Accordingly, the plaintiffs constantly bear the burden of proof that jurisdiction \ndoes in fact exist.” Ramming, 281 F.3d at 161 (internal citations omitted).  To have standing, \nthe plaintiffs need not demonstrate actual entitlement to relief; they “need only provide \nsufficient facts, which, if taken as true, establish an injury . . . that could be redressed by an \norder of th[e] court.”  Id.  The plaintiffs must “support [each element of standing] in the \nsame way as any other matter on which the plaintiff[s] bear[] the burden of proof.”  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 561.  “When a Rule 12(b)(1) motion is filed in conjunction with other Rule 12 \nmotions, the [C]ourt should consider the Rule 12(b)(1) jurisdictional attack before \n– 10 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 11 of 69   PageID 25337\naddressing any attack on the merits.”  Ramming, 281 F.3d at 161 (citing Hitt v. City of \nPasadena, 561 F.3d 606, 608 (5th Cir. 1977)). \n  B.  12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss \n  A party may also bring a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for “failure to state a claim \nupon which relief can be granted.”  “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must \ncontain sufficient factual matter which, when taken as true, states ‘a claim to relief that is \nplausible on its face.’”  Innova Hosp. San Antonio, Ltd. P’ship v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Ga., \nInc., 892 F.3d 719, 726 (5th Cir. 2018) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 \n(2007)).  Thus, the plaintiffs must plead facts “that allow[] [the] court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant[s] [are] liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. 662, 678 (2009). “Generally, a court ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion may rely on the \ncomplaint, its proper attachments, documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, \nand matters of which the court may take judicial notice.”  Innova Hosp. San Antonio, Ltd. \nP’ship, 892 F.3d at 726 (quoting Wolcott v. Sebelius, 635 F.3d 757, 763 (5th Cir. 2011)) \n(internal citations and quotation marks omitted).   \nA motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) “is viewed with disfavor and is rarely \ngranted.”  Turner v. Pleasant, 663 F.3d 770, 775 (5th Cir. 2011) (internal citation omitted).  \nThe Court must “accept all well-pled facts as true, construing all reasonable inferences in the \ncomplaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff[s].”  White v. U.S. Corrections, LLC, 996 \nF.3d 302, 306–07 (5th Cir. 2021).  Dismissing the complaint “is not appropriate unless the \nplaintiff[s’] pleadings on their face show, beyond a doubt, that the plaintiff[s] cannot prove \nany set of facts sufficient to entitle [them] to relief.”  Motient Corp. v. Dondero, 529 F.3d 532, \n535 (5th Cir. 2008).   \n– 11 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 12 of 69   PageID 25338\nC.  Summary Judgment \n“A party may move for summary judgment, identifying each claim or defense . . . on \nwhich summary judgment is sought.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  “The court shall grant \nsummary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material \nfact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Id.  Movants must support \ntheir assertion that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact by “citing to particular \nparts of materials in the record[] . . . or showing that the materials cited do not establish the \n. . . presence of a genuine dispute.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A).  Courts must consider “only \nthe cited materials [] but . . . may consider other materials in the record.”  Id.  In evaluating \na motion under Rule 56, the Court must determine whether, after considering the evidence \nin the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, a rational jury could find in favor of that \nparty.  Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007) (citing Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith \nRadio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586–87 (1986)).  \n3.  The plaintiffs have standing. \n  The defendants argue that the Court should dismiss Texas’s claims under Rule \n12(b)(1), alleging that Texas does not have standing because it has not suffered an injury in \nfact.  Dkt. No. 52 at 24–27.  The defendants, however, do not challenge LISD’s standing.  \nSee id.; see also Dkt. Nos. 59 at 8; 63 at 5–8.  This is important because only one party must \nhave standing for the Court to reach the remaining plaintiffs’ claims.  Texas v. United States, \n809 F.3d 134, 151 (5th Cir. 2015) (quoting Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. & Institutional Rights, \nInc., 547 U.S. 47, 52 n.2 (2006)).  Therefore, if LISD has standing, then the Court may reach \nTexas’s claims, too, which in any event are identical to LISD’s.  Even so, Texas has \nindependently established that it has standing because it, too, satisfies the injury-in-fact \n– 12 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 13 of 69   PageID 25339\nrequirement.  As explained below, Texas’s sovereign policy-making and enforcement \npowers have been inhibited, Texas has parens patriae standing, and Texas’s procedural rights \nhave been violated.  \nTo demonstrate that the Court has jurisdiction, the plaintiffs must demonstrate that \nthey suffered an “injury in fact.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.  An injury is “an invasion of a \nlegally protected interest” that is both “concrete and particularized” and “actual or \nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 339 (2016) \n(quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560).  A concrete injury is one that must “actually exist”—it \nmust be “real, and not abstract.”  Id. at 340 (internal quotation marks omitted).  As for \nparticularity, the plaintiff must be affected in a “personal and individual way.”  Id. at 339 \n(quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 n.1).  “Tangible” and “concrete” are not synonyms; the \nformer is broader than the latter, which encompasses intangible injuries within “injuries in \nfact.”  See TransUnion, 141 S. Ct. at 2204.   \nSimilarly, under Article III, an injury in law is not an injury in fact.  “Only those \nplaintiffs who have been concretely harmed by a defendant’s statutory violation may sue \nthat private defendant over that violation in federal court.”  Id. at 2205 (emphasis omitted).  \nTherefore, a plaintiff who “is merely seeking to ensure a defendant’s ‘compliance with \nregulatory law’” does not have “grounds for Article III standing” absent some “physical, \nmonetary, or cognizable intangible harm traditionally recognized as providing a basis for a \nlawsuit in American Courts.”  Id. at 2206 (quoting Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 345).  An increased \nregulatory burden, however, typically satisfies the injury-in-fact-requirement.  See Ass’n of \nAm. R.R.s v. Dep’t of Transp., 38 F.3d 582, 586 (D.C. Cir. 1994).   \n– 13 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 14 of 69   PageID 25340\n  A.  LISD has standing to challenge the Rule. \n  At the outset, the Court notes that the defendants do not challenge LISD’s standing.  \nSee Dkt. Nos. 52 at 24–27; 59 at 8; 63 at 5–8.  In fact, the defendants expressly state that \n“any relief granted should be limited to LISD.”  Dkt. No. 63 at 8.  And as explained in the \nCourt’s preliminary order, LISD satisfies the requirements for standing.  Dkt. No. 42 at 39–\n44, 50–52.  LISD has demonstrated that it faces various harms by complying with the Rule, \nwhich are sufficient to satisfy injury in fact.  Id. at 39–44.  LISD also satisfies the traceability \nand redressability requirements.  Id. at 50–52. \n  B.  Because LISD has standing, the Court may reach Texas’s claims. \n  Because LISD indisputably has standing, the Court may reach Texas’s claims.  As \nboth the Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit have made clear, “it is not necessary for all \n[p]laintiffs to demonstrate standing; rather ‘one party with standing is sufficient to satisfy \nArticle III’s case-or-controversy requirement.’”  Texas, 809 F.3d at 151 (quoting Rumsfeld, \n547 U.S. at 52 n.2); see also Bracken v. Haaland, 994 F.2d 249, 291 (5th Cir. 2021) (“[W]e . . . \nneed conclude only that one plaintiff in the present case satisfies standing with respect to \neach claim.”).  Because LISD has standing, Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement \nhas been satisfied, and the Court has jurisdiction to resolve Texas’s identical claims, too.  \nSee Texas, 809 F.3d at 151–62 (finding that because one of the state plaintiffs had standing, \nthe remaining state plaintiffs also had standing without additional analysis); Bracken, 994 \nF.3d at 290–97 (analyzing whether at least one plaintiff had standing for each of the claims \nthat the plaintiffs raised before moving forward to address those claims).  As a result, the \nCourt denies the defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.   \n– 14 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 15 of 69   PageID 25341\nC.  In any event, Texas has also suffered an injury in fact. \n \nIn the interest of judicial efficiency and out of an abundance of caution, the Court \nalso concludes that Texas independently satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement sufficient to \nprovide it with standing.  First, Texas’s sovereign policy-making and enforcement powers \nhave been impeded.  See supra Section 3.C.i.  Second, Texas has parens patriae standing.  See \nsupra Section 3.C.ii.  And third, Texas’s procedural rights have been violated. See supra \nSection 3.C.iii.  \n  i.  Texas has standing because the Rule inhibits Texas’s sovereign  \npolicy-making and enforcement powers. \n \nThe defendants seek dismissal because, in their view, Texas has not suffered a \nsovereign injury.  Dkt. Nos. 48; 52 at 25.  The record and binding precedent prove \notherwise. \n“[S]tates have a sovereign interest in ‘the power to create and enforce a legal code.’”  \nTex. Off. of Pub. Util. Couns. v. FCC, 183 F.3d 393, 449 (5th Cir. 1999) (quoting Alfred L. Snapp \n& Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 601 (1982)).  Pursuant to that interest, \nstates may have standing based on (1) federal assertions of authority to regulate matters they \nbelieve they control, (2) federal preemption of state law, and (3) federal interference with the \nenforcement of state law, at least where “the state statute at issue regulate[s] behavior or \nprovide[s] for the administration of a state program” and does not “simply purport [ ] to \nimmunize [state] citizens from federal law.”  Virginia ex rel. Cuccinelli v. Sebelius, 656 F.3d \n253, 269–70 (4th Cir. 2011); see, e.g., Wyoming ex rel. Crank v. United States, 539 F.3d 1236, \n1242 (10th Cir. 2008); Alaska v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 868 F.2d 441, 443–44 (D.C. Cir. 1989); \nOhio ex rel. Celebrezze v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 766 F.2d 228, 232–33 (6th Cir. 1985); cf. \nDiamond v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54, 62 (1986) (commenting that “a State has standing to defend \n– 15 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 16 of 69   PageID 25342\nthe constitutionality of its statute” but not relying on that principle).  Such intrusions \namount to pressure to change state law.  Texas, 809 F.3d at 153.  And as the Fifth Circuit \nhas repeatedly made clear, substantial pressure on states to change their laws affects those \nstates’ quasi-sovereign interests, particularly where that pressure ultimately pushes the state \n“to abandon its laws and policies.”  Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d 433, 446–47 (5th Cir. 2019); \nTexas v. United States, 787 F.3d 733, 752 n.38 (5th Cir. 2015); State v. Biden, 10 F.4th 538, 549 \n(5th Cir. 2021).   \nHere, the Rule inhibits Texas’s sovereign policy-making and enforcement powers.  \nTexas has elected to prohibit governmental entities from requiring vaccines, and it did so \nbefore issuance of the Rule.7  Texas EO GA-40 (Oct. 11, 2021).  But in light of the Rule, \nTexas officials who are obliged to enforce Texas law will be forced to decide whether to fine \nschool districts and officials who choose to deviate from state law and comply with the \nregulations simply to avoid losing Head Start funding.  This situation is analogous to Texas \nv. EEOC, where the Fifth Circuit concluded that Texas had standing to assert its claims \nagainst the EEOC, noting that the guidance at issue encouraged employers “to deviate from \nstate law when it conflict[ed] with the [g]uidance” for the purpose of avoiding liability.  933 \nF.3d at 447.   \nThe defendants’ argument that Texas’s sovereignty interests have not been invaded \nbecause the Rule is not broadly preemptive fails.  Dkt. No. 52 at 25.  As they concede, \n \n7 The distinction between a statute and an executive order is not material to this analysis.  As \nexplained in Texas Government Code § 418.012, the Governor’s “[e]xecutive orders, \nproclamations, and regulations have the force and effect of law.”  See also E.T. v. Paxton, 19 F.4th \n760, 770 (5th Cir. 2021) (“While this case centers on an executive order issued by the Governor \nunder his emergency authority rather than enforcement of a statute enacted by the plenary \nlegislative authority of the people, the same reasoning applies.”).  In any event, the defendants do \nnot argue that this distinction is material.  See Dkt. No. 52 at 25–26. \n– 16 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 17 of 69   PageID 25343\n“courts have recognized a cognizable Article III harm when a state’s own enforcement \nefforts have been hampered.”  Id. (emphasis omitted).  The net effect of the Rule is a \nsubstantial pressure upon Texas to change, or at least cease enforcing and abandon, its own \nlaws.  Texas therefore suffers an injury in fact because its sovereign policy-making and \nenforcement powers have been impeded by the Rule. \n    ii.  Texas has parens patriae standing. \nThe defendants once again challenge Texas’s assertion that it has parens patriae \nstanding (Id. at 26–27), but as the Court previously explained in its preliminary-injunction \norder (Dkt. No. 42 at 46–49), that argument fails.   \n“To have [parens patriae], standing the State must assert an injury to what has been \ncharacterized as a ‘quasi-sovereign’ interest, which is a judicial construct that does not lend \nitself to a simple or exact definition.”  Alfred L. Snapp, 458 U.S. at 601.  Three cases guide \nthe Court’s understanding of a state’s parens patriae interests.    \nFirst, in Massachusetts v. Mellon, the Supreme Court made clear that states do not have \nparens patriae standing to protect their citizens from the operation of federal law.  262 U.S. \n447, 485 (1923).  Mellon involved a challenge to the Sheppard-Towner Maternity and \nInfancy Act, a federal law enacted under President Harding to reduce infant and maternal \nmortality.  Id. at 479.  The Act operated by providing funds—with strings—to state health \nagencies.  Id.  States that did not restructure their operations in accordance with the federal \ngovernment’s conditions lost federal funding.  Id. at 479–82.  Massachusetts sued then-\nTreasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, the official responsible for disbursing the funds, arguing \nthat the Act unconstitutionally legislated “for purposes not national, but local to the states.”  \nId. at 479.  The Supreme Court rejected Massachusetts’s challenge.  Id. at 488–89.  The \n– 17 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 18 of 69   PageID 25344\ncourt concluded that Massachusetts sought the court’s decision as to an “abstract question[] \nof political power”—not a case or controversy.  Id. at 485.  The court also concluded that \nMassachusetts could not bring suit “as the representative of its citizens”—as parens patriae.  \nId.  Because “the citizens of Massachusetts are also citizens of the United States,” \nMassachusetts had no “duty or power to enforce their rights in respect of their relations with \nthe federal government.”  Id. at 485–86.  Instead, it was the United States—whose laws are \nsupreme under the Constitution—who was the citizens’ parens patriae.  Id. at 486.   \nSix decades later, in Alfred L. Snapp, the Supreme Court refined the so-called Mellon \nbar.  458 U.S. 592.  While reaffirming Mellon’s core rule, the court restricted it: a state does \nhave standing to assert its “quasi-sovereign interests” against the federal government.  Id. at \n607–08, 610 n.16.  The Court defined quasi-sovereign interests as a state’s interests “in the \nhealth and well-being—both physical and economic—of its residents in general,” as well as \na state’s “interest in not being discriminatorily denied its rightful status within the federal \nsystem.”8  Id. at 607.  The Court went on to explain that “[o]ne helpful indication in \ndetermining whether an alleged injury to the health and welfare of its citizens suffices to \ngive the State standing to sue as parens patriae is whether the injury is one that the State, if it \ncould, would likely attempt to address its sovereign lawmaking powers.”  Id. \nIn 2007, the Supreme Court once again took up the question of parens patriae \nstanding.  In Massachusetts v. EPA, it held that Massachusetts had standing to challenge the \nEPA’s failure to regulate greenhouse gasses under the authority granted to it by the Clean \n \n8 The Court notes, as others have, that the language in Alfred L. Snapp that “[a] State does not have \nstanding as parens patriae to bring an action against the federal government” is technically dictum \nbut, like others, takes the statement at face value for the purposes of this analysis.  458 U.S. at 610 \nn.16. \n– 18 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 19 of 69   PageID 25345\nAir Act.  549 U.S. 497, 526 (2007).  The majority stated that Mellon did not adopt a broad \nbar on a state’s parens patriae standing against the federal government because the Mellon \ncourt was not “called upon to adjudicate . . . quasi-sovereign rights actually invaded or \nthreatened.”  Id. at 520 n.17 (emphasis in original).  The majority continued that there was a \n“critical difference between allowing a State ‘to protect her citizens from the operation of \nfederal statutes’ (which is what Mellon prohibits) and allowing a State to assert its rights \nunder federal law (which it has standing to do).”  Id. (citing Georgia v. Pa. R. Co., 324 U.S. \n439, 447 (1945)).  Accordingly, the court concluded that since Massachusetts sought to \ninvoke its own rights under the Clean Air Act rather than its citizens’, it had standing.  See \nid. at 522–23, 526. \nThe law today is clear that a state has parens patriae standing when a state “assert[s] \nits rights under federal law” but lacks standing when it seeks only to “protect her citizens \nfrom the operation of federal statutes.”  Id. at 520 n.17.  And the “rights” under federal law \na state may protect encompass two general categories of “quasi-sovereign” interests: those \n“in the health and well-being—both physical and economic—of its residents in general,” \nand those “in not being discriminatorily denied its rightful status within the federal system.”  \nAlfred L. Snapp, 458 U.S. at 607. \nWith that understanding, the Court concludes that Texas has parens patriae standing.  \nAgain, an indicator of parens patriae standing is when a state alleges an injury to the health \nand welfare of its citizens that the “State, if it could, would likely attempt to address through \nits sovereign lawmaking powers.”  Id.  That is precisely the situation at hand.  Texas \nattempted to—and did, in fact—address this injury to its citizens.  Dkt. No. 61 at 9–10.  \nTexas issued Executive Orders GA-38, GA-39, and GA-40, which prohibit state agencies, \n– 19 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 20 of 69   PageID 25346\npolitical subdivisions, and any public or private entity in Texas from requiring a person to \nreceive a COVID-19 vaccine.  Texas EO GA-38 (July 29, 2021); Texas EO GA-39 (Aug. 25, \n2021); Texas EO GA-40 (Oct. 11, 2021) All of these were promulgated before the \ndefendants even issued the Rule.  See 86 Fed. Reg. 68,052. \nIn addition, Texas alleges that the Rule’s enforcement will lead to dramatic declines \nin Head Start offerings, adversely impacting students and their families.  Dkt. No. 1 at ¶ 81–\n85.  As the plaintiffs explain, “[a] natural and predictable consequence of the [v]accine \n[m]andate is that numerous Head Start faculty, staff, contractors, and volunteers may be \nfired, retire or quit,” which will lead to staffing shortages and even program closures.  Id. at \n¶ 82–83.  The plaintiffs support these concerns with declarations from school officials in \nmetropolitan and rural areas alike (see, e.g., Dkt. No. 1-3), along with evidence of the \nmillions of dollars in funding that are at stake in this dispute (Dkt. No. 1-2).  The Rule itself \nacknowledges that “program closures [] create instability and stress for children and \nfamilies.  They disrupt children’s opportunities for learning, socialization, nutrition, and \ncontinuity and routine.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 68057.   \nIt is difficult to imagine what could qualify as interests “in the health and well-\nbeing—both physical and economic—of its residents in general” sufficient to provide Texas \nwith parens patriae standing if not the adverse impact on needy children across the state.  See \nAlfred L. Snapp, 458 U.S. at 607.  Thus, the Court concludes it has a parens patriae interest in \nprotecting the welfare of its neediest children.  As such, the Court need not and does not \naddress the issue of whether Texas has standing as parens patriae for Head Start staff.   \n– 20 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 21 of 69   PageID 25347\n    iii.  Texas suffered injury in fact because it was denied its procedural  \nright to comment on the Rule pursuant to the APA. \n \nIn addition, Texas suffers another form of injury by being denied its procedural right \nto comment on the Rule as the APA requires.  “A plaintiff can show a cognizable injury if it \nhas been deprived of ‘a procedural right to protect [its] concrete interests.’”  EEOC, 933 F.3d \nat 447 (quoting Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 496 (2009)).  “A violation of the \nAPA’s notice-and-comment requirements is one example of a deprivation of a procedural \nright.”  Id.  In EEOC, the Fifth Circuit considered whether Texas had standing to challenge \nan agency action for violating the APA’s notice-and-comment requirement.  Id.  The Fifth \nCircuit assumed, for purposes of standing only, that Texas was correct on the merits of its \nclaim and found that Texas had standing because such a violation “undercut[] Texas’s \nconcrete interest, as a sovereign state, in maintaining compliance with its laws.”  Id. \nThe Rule here similarly undercuts Texas’s interest in ensuring compliance with its \nlaws—specifically, its laws prohibiting state entities from requiring vaccines.  See supra \nSection 3.C.i; see also Dkt. No. 1 at ¶¶ 75, 79 (noting that the “Governor of Texas has issued \nan executive order prohibiting mandatory vaccination requirements by entities in Texas” \nand that “Head Start Programs at Texas schools have district employees who monitor \ncompliance with Head Start program requirements”).  Head Start programs within Texas \nwill be encouraged to deviate from Texas’s state law, affecting Texas’s ability to enforce its \nown laws.  See Dkt. No. 1 at ¶ 78 (noting that the Rule impedes Texas’s ability to “enforce a \nlegal code” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Only by preventing the Rule’s \nenforcement—with the expectation that the Secretary may try again, this time allowing for \nnotice and comment before promulgation—will Texas’s procedural rights under the APA be \n– 21 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 22 of 69   PageID 25348\nprotected.  Thus, the denial of Texas’s opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process \nthrough notice and comment presents another form of injury in fact. \nIn sum, Texas satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement to establish standing.  \nTherefore, the Court denies the defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.9 \n4.  The Secretary issued the Rule without statutory authority. \nThe plaintiffs argue that the Secretary lacks statutory authority to impose the Rule \n(Dkt No. 54-1 at 18–38), while the plaintiffs allege that the Rule fits neatly within the Act’s \ngrant of authority (Dkt. No. 52 at 28–41).  For the reasons explained below, the Court finds \nthat the Rule exceeds statutory authority and that no permissible construction of the statute \ncould justify it.   \nA federal agency cannot act without Congressional authorization.  La. Pub. Serv. \nComm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986).  It cannot confer power upon itself.  Id.  “To \npermit an agency to expand its power in the face of a congressional limitation on its \njurisdiction would be to grant to the agency power to override Congress.”  Id. at 374–75.  \nTherefore, under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), courts must “hold unlawful and \nset aside agency action” that is “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, \nor short of statutory right.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C).   \nWhen reviewing an agency’s construction of a statute, courts must use the ordinary \ntools of statutory interpretation.  First, under the Chevron two-step framework, the Court \n \n9 Texas also asserts that it has suffered an injury in fact in the form of costs.  Specifically, the “choice \nTexas faces—either spending, at a minimum, hundreds of thousands of dollars, to absorb school \ndistricts’ loss of federal funding or changing its laws—establishes that Texas has standing to bring \nthese claims.”  Dkt. No. 61 at 11.  The defendants argue, however, that Texas itself is not a \nrecipient of Head Start grants and “fails to show how it has suffered a concrete injury from the \nRule because it has appropriated funds to an entity that also receives Head Start funds.”  Dkt. No. \n52 at 25.  Because Texas satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement on other grounds, the Court does \nnot reach this argument. \n– 22 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 23 of 69   PageID 25349\nmust consider “whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question as issue.”  \nChevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984).  If Congress has \ndirectly spoken on the precise issue, the Court “must give effect to the unambiguously \nexpressed intent of Congress.”  Id. at 842–43.  But “if the statute is silent or ambiguous with \nrespect to the specific issue, the question for the Court is whether the agency’s answer is \nbased on a permissible construction of the statute.”  Id. at 843.10 \n  A.  The plain language of the statutory provisions on which the Secretary relies  \ndoes not authorize the vaccine mandate, and the Secretary’s proposed \nconstruction is impermissible. \n \nThe Court begins with the text of the Rule’s cited authority.  HHS claims that \nSection 9836a(a)(1)(C), (D), and (E) of the Head Start Act11 authorize the Rule.  86 Fed. \nReg. at 68,053 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(C)–(E)).  The relevant language appears as \nfollows: \n \n10 The Court recognizes that the Chevron framework may have fallen out of favor.  The Supreme \nCourt recently decided two cases where Chevron could have applied, but it received no reference, let \nalone deference.  See Becerra v. Empire Health Found., for Valley Hosp. Med. Ctr., 142 S. Ct. 2354, 2362 \n(2022); Am. Hosp. Ass’n v. Becerra, 142 S. Ct. 1896, 1904 (2022).  By contrast, in another recent case, \nthe Supreme Court crystalized the long-developing major-questions doctrine.  See West Virginia. v. \nEPA, 142 S. Ct. 2587, 2607–14 (2022).  There, the majority again made no mention of Chevron.  \nHere, the Court refrains from evaluating Chevron’s vitality and applies its framework out of an \nabundance of caution and in light of fairly recent Fifth Circuit precedent applying Chevron.  See W \n& T Offshore, Inc. v. Bernhardt, 946 F.3d 227, 233–34 (5th Cir. 2019).  If Chevron’s framework did not \napply, however, the Court’s conclusions here would stand on even firmer ground.  In any event, \nHHS’s interpretation of the Head Start Act is impermissible. \n \n11 Defendants cite 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(C)–(E), as amended by the Improving Head Start for \nSchool Readiness Act of 2007, Pub. L. No. 110–34, § 8, 121 Stat. 1385–96 (2007).  For simplicity, \nthe Court refers to the current, amended version of this statute as the “Head Start Act.” \n– 23 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 24 of 69   PageID 25350\n§ 9836a. Standards; monitoring of Head Start agencies and programs \n \n(A) (a) Standards \n \n(A) (1) Content of standards \n \nThe Secretary shall modify, as necessary, program \nperformance standards by regulation applicable to Head \nStart agencies and programs under this subchapter, \nincluding— \n. . .  \n \n(C) administrative and financial management standards; \n \n(D) standards relating to the condition and location of \nfacilities (including indoor air quality assessment \nstandards, where appropriate)  \n. . .  \n \n(E) such other standards as the Secretary finds to be \nappropriate. \n \nApplying Chevron’s first step, both the plaintiffs and the defendants argue that \nCongress has spoken to the precise question at issue, but the Court disagrees.  The statutory \nsubsections on which the defendants rely do not mention “vaccinations” or \n“immunization,” which is especially telling.  See 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(C)–(E).  State laws \nand regulations have long required—and explicitly stated—that at least children be \nvaccinated against many communicable diseases.  See, e.g., 25 Tex. Admin. Code \n§ 97.63(2)(A) (requiring that “[c]hildren enrolled in child-care facilities, pre-kindergarten, or \nearly childhood programs” be immunized against a host of diseases).  But that is not the \ncase here. \n– 24 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 25 of 69   PageID 25351\nCongress could have spoken directly to the issue of vaccinations, including post-\nCOVID-19, but it did not and has not.12  Rather than amend the Head Start Act, Congress \nonly granted funds “for carrying out” the existing “Head Start Act.”  See Consolidated \nAppropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. No. 116–260, 134 Stat. 1181, 1583–84 (2020); \nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. No. 117–103, 136 Stat. 49, 458–59 (2022).  \nIn addition, the subsections on which the defendants rely do not mention broader health \nand safety precautions that Head Start staff, volunteers, and contractors must take.  See 42 \nU.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(C)–(E).  Thus, contrary to the defendants’ assertion that the provisions \nunambiguously provide statutory authority (Dkt. No. 52 at 28–31), subsections (a)(1)(C), \n(D) and (E) are silent as to the “precise question at issue.”  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843.   \nEven under subsection (A)—a provision that the Secretary did not cite as authority \nfor the Rule—Congress did not speak to the precise question at issue.  Although this \nsubsection allows the Secretary to “modify performance standards” for “services required to \nbe provided, including health,” it concerns providing services to children, including health \nservices.  42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(A).  It does not condition employment on vaccination \nrequirements.  Id.   \nFor their part, the plaintiffs argue that the silence of the provisions on the issue of \nvaccinations unambiguously shows that the defendants do not have statutory authority; \ntherefore, the Court can end its analysis at Chevron’s first step.  Dkt. No. 61 at 17–20.  The \nplaintiffs cite Texas v. United States, 497 F.3d 491, 502–03 (5th Cir. 2007), where the agency \n \n12 As counsel for the defendants conceded at the evidentiary hearing, Congress could not have \nforeseen the COVID-19 pandemic when it enacted the Head Start Act.  Dkt. No. 41 at 57–58.  \nThat argument does not help the defendants, though.  Rather, it underscores the need to reach \nChevron’s second step. \n– 25 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 26 of 69   PageID 25352\nargued that the statute’s silence granted the agency implicit authority.  Here, however, the \ndefendants do not raise a similar argument.  Rather, they argue that more general \nauthorizations justify the vaccine mandate.  See Dkt. No. 52 at 27–31.  The plaintiffs also \ncite American Bus Ass’n v. Slater, 231 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2000), but the language at issue \nthere expressly and unambiguously limited the agency’s power, which is not the case here.  \nInstead, each side points to broad statutory language that they assert supports their \nrespective positions.  See Dkt. Nos. 52 at 27–31; 54-1 at 18–21.  The Court agrees with the \nplaintiffs that the statutory language does not authorize the Rule but does so—out of an \nabundance of caution—in Chevron’s second step. \nUnder step two, the Court must decide whether “the agency’s [interpretation] is \nbased on a permissible construction of the statute.”  467 U.S. at 843.  The plain language of \nthe defendants’ cited authority, the statutory context, and the existing regulations all \nconfirm that the Secretary’s interpretation of “performance standards” is not a permissible \nconstruction.  Thus, the defendants exceeded their statutory authority.   \nAs mentioned, the Secretary invokes subsections (a)(1)(C), (D), and (E) of the Head \nStart Act to claim the broad authority for issuing this Rule.  86 Fed. Reg. at 68,052.  Those \nsubsections authorize the Secretary to “modify, as necessary, program performance \nstandards by regulation . . . including—(C) administrative and financial management \nstandards; (D) standards relating to the condition and location of facilities (including indoor \nair quality assessment standards, where appropriate) . . . [and] (E) such other standards as \nthe Secretary finds to be appropriate.”  42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(C)–(E).   \nAt the outset, Congress appears to have limited the scope of the Secretary’s power.  \nAs stated in the Act, the Secretary may only “modify” program performance standards.  Id.  \n– 26 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 27 of 69   PageID 25353\nThis is not a broad grant of rulemaking power like the defendants argue.  See Dkt. No. 52 at \n28.  Rather, by enabling the Secretary to only “modify” program performance standards, \nCongress conferred modest authority.  To “modify” means to “make somewhat different; to \nmake small changes to (something) by way of improvement, suitability, or effectiveness . . . \n[t]o make more moderate or less sweeping; to reduce in degree or extent; to limit, qualify, or \nmoderate.”  Modify, Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019); see also MCI Telecomm. Corp. v. \nAm. Tel. & Tel. Co., 512 U.S. 218, 225 (1994) (“[V]irtually every dictionary we are aware of \nsays that ‘to modify’ means to change moderately or in minor fashion.”). \nWith the power to “modify,” the Secretary may only make moderate changes to \nHead Start performance standards.  Against this backdrop, the Court finds that enacting an \nunprecedented vaccine mandate is not a moderate change to the specific standards the \ndefendants try to leverage.  Furthermore, even assuming the “modify” language within the \nAct does not cabin the Secretary’s power, the identified sources of authority cannot fairly be \nconstrued so broadly as to include an unprecedented, nationwide requirement of a medical \nprocedure.  See 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(C)–(E).  The Court addresses each of the \ndefendants’ cited provisions in turn. \nFirst, the vaccine mandate is not authorized by subsection (C), which allows the \nSecretary to modify “administrative and financial management standards.”  See \nid. § 9836a(a)(1)(C).  “Financial management standards” plainly do not encompass a \nvaccine mandate—they relate to how money is handled.  The defendants previously \nadmitted that the mandates are not financial management standards (Dkt. No. 41 at 48), \nand they do not argue otherwise here (see Dkt. No. 52 at 29).  \n– 27 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 28 of 69   PageID 25354\nLikewise, the Secretary may not impose these mandates by purporting to modify \nadministrative standards.  “Administrative” is not defined by the statute but generally refers \nto “of or relating to administration,” and “administration” is the “performance of executive \nduties: management.”  Administrative, Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed. \n2014); Administration, Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed. 2014).  By placing \nthe vaccine mandate in the “Human Resources Management” section of the regulations, the \ndefendants seem to interpret “administrative” standards to include requiring its employees \nto undergo a mandatory offsite medical procedure or be fired if they are not granted an \nexemption.  See 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,060 (noting that the Rule adds four new provisions to \n“part 1302, subpart I—Human Resources Management” in 45 C.F.R. §§ 1302.93–94).  Such \na requirement, however, would not typically be characterized as relating to executive duties \nor management.  If it were, there would be no limit to the scope of administrative standards.  \nThe defendants could then impose any requirement on Head Start staff, contractors, and \nvolunteers by modifying “administrative standards.”   \nRather, the scope of “administrative standards” is informed by the term to which it is \njoined: “financial management standards.” 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(C).  Congress grouped \nthe two together—not only in the same list, but in the same subsection.  See id.  Statutory \nterms are often known by the “company they keep.”  See Lagos v. United States, 138 S. Ct. \n1684, 1688–89 (2018) (Breyer, J., writing for a unanimous Court) (citing Yates v. United \nStates, 574 U.S. 528, 542 (2015)) (finding “both the presence of company that suggests \nlimitation and the absence of company that suggests breadth”).  The agency concedes that \nthe company that the term “administrative” keeps—“financial management”—obviously \ncannot authorize the Rule.  Dkt. No. 41 at 48.  Read together, the term “financial \n– 28 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 29 of 69   PageID 25355\nmanagement standards” “suggests limitation” on the scope of the term “administrative \nstandards.”  The terms appear to contemplate management standards like those found in \n45 C.F.R. § 1302.101(a)(1), which requires programs to use effective “fiscal[] and human \nresource management structure[s].”  Those standards are entirely different from a \nmandatory vaccine requirement.  Given that the vaccine mandate is aimed at children’s \nhealth, it defies logic to assert that such standards would be characterized as administrative \nor financial.   \nSecond, the plain language of subsection (D) suggests that the Secretary may not \nimpose the vaccine mandate.  Subsection (D) enables the Secretary to modify “standards \nrelating to the condition and location of facilities (including indoor air quality assessment \nstandards, where appropriate).”  42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(D).  “Facility” is defined as “a \nstructure, such as a building or modular unit, appropriate for use in carrying out a Head \nStart program and used primarily to provide Head Start services.”  45 C.F.R. § 1305.2 \n(2021).  Subsection (D) specifies that the condition and location of facilities must “meet or \nexceed State and local requirements concerning licensing for such facilities” and “be \naccessible by State and local authorities for purposes of monitoring and ensuring \ncompliance.”  42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(D)(i) & (ii).  The “condition” of facilities—as the \nreferences to “indoor air quality assessment standards,” licensing, and accessibility make \nclear—thus relates to the physical conditions of buildings and equipment.  The language \ndoes not refer to adults’ employment or volunteer eligibility.  Mandating facility standards is \na far cry from mandating a medical procedure for all staff under the threat of termination. \nThe Rule contains a lone sentence aimed at explaining how the mask and vaccine \nmandates are “standards relating to the condition . . . of facilities.”  42 U.S.C. \n– 29 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 30 of 69   PageID 25356\n§ 9836a(a)(1)(D).  “The Secretary finds it necessary and appropriate to set health and safety \nstandards for the condition of Head Start facilities that ensure the reduction in transmission \nof the SARS–CoV–2 and to avoid severe illness, hospitalization, and death among program \nparticipants.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 68,054.  But the Rule governs the conditions of people, not \nbuildings.  See Dkt. No. 41 at 49 (defendants acknowledging that “facilities” refer to \nbuildings). \nThe last subsection—“such other standards as the Secretary finds to be \nappropriate”—cannot support the vaccine mandate, either.  42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(E).  \nThe defendants allege that this subsection provides the Secretary with broad authority (Dkt. \nNo. 28), but they overlook how that authority has been cabined.  Though seemingly \nexpansive, “such other” standards fall under the banner of “performance standards,” so it \nmust be defined in relation to subsections (A)–(D).  42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1) (stating that \n“[t]he Secretary shall modify, as necessary program performance standards”).  Generally, \n“performance standards” are criteria that measure the quality of Head Start programs.  See \nStandard, Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) (“A criterion for measuring acceptability, \nquality, or accuracy”).  Here, “quality” corresponds to Head Start programs’ ability to \nachieve their purpose.  Under the Act, that purpose is to “promote the school readiness of \nlow-income children by enhancing their cognitive, social, and emotional development” \nthrough providing a host of services—including health services to the children and their \nfamilies.  42 U.S.C. § 9831(2).  Therefore, the Secretary may modify “such other” \nperformance standards, which are criteria that measure Head Start programs’ ability to \nachieve their purpose. \n– 30 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 31 of 69   PageID 25357\nThe vaccine mandate, however, does not measure a staff’s, volunteers’, or \ncontractors’ ability to enhance children’s development; it determines whether they will be \nhired, kept on, or fired in the first place.  The mandate does not operate as a performance \nstandard and provide a method for measuring quality.  Instead, the mandate is a \nprerequisite to performance.  As such, the defendants’ construction of their cited authorities \nis impermissible for this fundamental reason.   \nFurthermore, if “such other performance standards” could include mandates such as \nthe vaccine requirement at issue here, there would be no genuine limiting principle to the \nSecretary’s authority to regulate in the name of “health and safety standards.”   In Alabama \nAss’n of Realtors v. Department of Health and Human Services, the Supreme Court invalidated a \nfederal agency’s attempt to pass COVID-19 restrictions, and it did so, in part, due to the \nlack of any limit to the asserted authority.  141 S. Ct. 2485, 2489 (2021).  There, the \nSupreme Court held that it was “virtually certain” that the CDC did not have authority to \nissue an eviction moratorium based on the Surgeon General’s statutory authority to make \nand enforce regulations to prevent the spread of communicable diseases.  Id. at 2486.  The \nstatute at issue had a catch-all provision, similar to the one in this case—“other measures, as \nin his judgment may be necessary.”  Id. at 2487 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 264).  But the Court \nexplained that “the sheer scope of the CDC’s claimed authority . . . would counsel against” \nthe CDC’s interpretation, because it was “hard to see what measures [it] would place \noutside the CDC’s reach.”  Id. at 2489.   \nAlthough, this case, of course, deals with different statutory language, the agency’s \nsimilar claim to expansive authority based on generalized and catch-all language \nundermines its position.  See Dkt. No. 52 at 28–29.  Here, the defendants argue that the \n– 31 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 32 of 69   PageID 25358\nSecretary can leverage “such other standards as the Secretary finds to be appropriate” to \npass any health and safety regulation that furthers the general purpose of the statute—\nkeeping Head Start programs open to promote the school readiness of children.  Id.  Even \nthis reading, however, appears to allow the Secretary to pass any health-related mandate \nthat would reduce staff and volunteer absenteeism, not require Head Start staff to undergo a \nmedical procedure or face termination.  Even if the plain language of “program performance \nstandards” authorized the Rule—which it does not—adopting the remote and manipulable \nreading urged by the Secretary counsels against the defendants’ interpretation.  See Ala. Ass’n \nof Realtors, 141 S. Ct. at 2489. \nB.  Other statutory provisions and existing regulations confirm that the  \nvaccine mandate is unprecedented and unauthorized. \n \nAttempting to show that the Secretary had statutory authority to issue the mandate, \nthe defendants point to various other statutory provisions and administrative regulations \ninvolving health and safety.  Dkt. No. 52 at 31–37.  Thus, citing Biden v. Missouri, the \ndefendants claim that HHS’s history of health-and-safety regulations supports its reading of \nthe statute.  Id.  But unlike Biden v. Missouri, HHS does not have a “longstanding practice” \nof implementing its statutory authority under the Head Start Act in a way consistent with \nthe vaccine mandate here.  See 142 S. Ct. 647, 653–54 (2022).  And the Secretary expressly \ndisavowed reliance on the one statutory provision addressing health services.  Id. at 40–41. \nSpecifically, the defendants point to the Secretary’s authority to issue “deficiencies.”  \nDkt. No. 52 at 30–31.  Congress has authorized the Secretary to issue “deficiencies” when \nprograms fail to follow “performance standards.”  42 U.S.C. § 9836a(e)(1)(A).  The Act \ndefines a “deficiency” as “a systematic or substantial material failure of an agency in an area \nof performance that the Secretary determines involves—(i) a threat to the health, safety, or \n– 32 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 33 of 69   PageID 25359\ncivil rights of children or staff; . . . [or] (iii) a failure to comply with standards related to \nearly childhood development and health services . . . .”  Id. § 9832(2)(A).  The defendants \nargue that the Secretary can establish “standards related to early childhood development \nand health services” and “the health . . . of children or staff” because he can issue \ndeficiencies for failures to follow such standards, urging the Court to work backwards from \nthe definition of “deficiency.”  Dkt. No. 52 at 30 (quoting § 9832(2)(A) and citing \n§ 9836a(e)(1)).  The defendants also point previous and current standards and regulations, \nalong with other statutory provisions.  Dkt. No. 42 at 32–36.  Some center on Head Start \nstaff, contractors, and volunteers and deal with subjects such as training, professional \ndevelopment, and health screenings.  Id. (citing 42 U.S.C. §§ 9832(21)(G)(i), \n9837(C)(1)(E)(iii), 9843(b)(2)(D), (d)(1)(G); 45 C.F.R. §§ 1302.47(b)(4)(i)(A), 1302.93(a); 61 \nFed. Reg. 57,186 (Nov. 5, 1996); 81 Fed. Reg. 61,294 (Sept. 6, 2016)).  Others focus on \nparticipants and cover areas such as health screenings, medical records, and program \nassistance in arranging and facilitating health services.  Id. (citing 42 U.S.C. §§ 9835(m)(2), \n9843(a)(3)(B)(xii)(VI); 45 C.F.R. §§ 1306.35(b)(2)(ix), 1302.42(b)(1)(i)–(ii)), (e)(2), 1304.3-\n3(b)(4)–(6), (8) (1975), 1304.3-4(2) (1975); 1304.22(b), (e)(7) (2015), 1308 App’x (2015)).  \nBut the defendants’ arguments fall short.   \nFirst, the Court does not doubt that the Secretary can establish certain performance \nstandards related to “health services.”  Subsection (A) of program performance standards \nspecifically allows the Secretary to modify “performance standards with respect to services \nrequired to be provided, including health.”  42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(A).  But the Secretary \ndid not rely on this subsection as his statutory authority for the vaccine mandate.  See 86 \nFed. Reg. 68,052.  Subsection (A) does not appear in the Rule even once.  Id.  Instead, he \n– 33 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 34 of 69   PageID 25360\nrelies solely and specifically on subsections (C) (“administrative and financial”), (D) \n(“facilities”), and (E) (“other”) of “program performance standards.”  86 Fed. Reg. at \n68,052–53 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(C)–(E)).  The defendants previously conceded \nthat the vaccine mandate is not a health service (Dkt. No. 41 at 40) and do not argue \notherwise now (Dkt. No. 52 at 28–31).  \nIn any event, Head Start is not providing “health services” to children nor \nestablishing related “performance standards” by requiring that employees, volunteers, and \ncontractors get vaccinated.  Current performance standards related to health services include \nexaminations and screenings for children, for instance.  See 45 C.F.R. § 1302.42 (2021).  \nThese standards even include assisting children in getting up to date on immunizations.  Id. \n§ 1302.42(b)(1).   \nBut these existing regulations differ from the vaccine requirement in several critical \nways.  Initially, the Court notes that all of the regulations that the defendants cite regarding \nimmunization opportunities only require that they be made available to children; they say \nnothing regarding staff or volunteers.  See, e.g., id.  Moreover, since the first of these \nregulations were promulgated, they have never mandated a medical procedure; to the \ncontrary, they have always been conditioned upon parental consent.  See Program \nPerformance Standards for Operation of Head Start Programs by Grantees and Delegate \nAgencies, 40 Fed. Reg. 27,562, 27,565 (June 30, 1975) (codified in 45 C.F.R. § 1304.3-3(a)) \n(requiring “advance parent or guardian authorization” for all screenings and examinations); \n45 C.F.R. § 1302.41 (2021) (requiring Head Start programs to “collaborate with parents as \npartners in the health and well-being of their children” and “[a]t a minimum” to “[o]btain \nadvance authorization from the parent or other person with legal authority for all health and \n– 34 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 35 of 69   PageID 25361\ndevelopmental procedures administered through the program”); 45 C.F.R. § 1302.42(b)(ii) \n(2021) (authorizing Head Start staff to assist parents with scheduling immunizations but \nsaying nothing about enforced masking or vaccinations).  Additionally, as the defendants \nconcede, the vaccine mandate is the first time in Head Start’s history that such a procedure \nis mandated as a prerequisite to employment with Head Start programs.  Dkt. No. 41 at 46–\n47.  As such, staff, contractors, and volunteers have never faced the requirement of a \nvaccine under the threat of termination.  And the cited regulations applicable to staff focus \nprimarily on training and professional development or initial and periodic health \nexaminations and screenings as recommended by the staff’s health care providers.  45 \nC.F.R. §§ 1302.93(a); 1302.47(b)(4)(i)(A).  Thus, these regulations are materially different \nfrom one requiring that staff undergo an invasive, irreversible medical procedure as a \ncondition to employment or participation.  All of these distinctions highlight why the \nvaccine mandate is not a “performance standard[]” in the first place.14   \nSecond, that the “deficiencies” for which the Secretary can impose sanctions \ncontemplate threats to “health and safety” does not widen the scope of what “performance \nstandards” comprises.  Based on the listed “performance standards” in Section 9836a(a)(1), \nthe Secretary has limited power to provide for the health and safety of Head Start programs.  \nThat was never in doubt.  But again, that limited power does not authorize the vaccine \nmandate.  For instance, Congress expressly granted the Secretary authority to regulate the \n \n14 See Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Dep’t of Lab., Occupational Safety & Health Admin., 142 S. Ct. 661, 666 \n(2022) (“It is telling that OSHA, in its half century of existence, has never before adopted a broad \npublic health regulation of this kind—addressing a threat that is untethered, in any causal sense, \nfrom the workplace. This ‘lack of historical precedent,’ coupled with the breadth of authority that \nthe Secretary now claims, is a ‘telling indication’ that the mandate extends beyond the agency’s \nlegitimate reach.”). \n– 35 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 36 of 69   PageID 25362\nconditions of “facilities.”  42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(D).  And here, the Secretary’s own \nexplanation of his statutory authority focused on “facilities.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 68,054.  \nFacility conditions, such as poor “ventilation” systems, can directly impact the health and \nsafety of children and staff.  Id. at 68,054, 68,066.  Thus, it is no surprise that the Secretary \ncould issue deficiencies based on “threat[s] [to] the health or safety” of staff and children \nresulting from facility conditions.  42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(D), (e)(1)(B)(i).  But, as \nexplained above, the Act says nothing about conditioning participation and employment \neligibility on health and safety requirements as vast as the vaccine mandate here.   \nFurthermore, that Congress mentions standards related to “health” services in \nsubsection (A) cuts against the defendants’ claim that the catch-all provision in subsection \n(E) includes any health-related standards.  Reading “other standards” as broadly as the \ndefendants suggest would render subsection (A) surplusage as it pertains to “health” related \nstandards.  The catch-all provision cannot be read so broadly as to eclipse the meaning of \nsubsections (A)–(D).  The Court “must give effect to every word that Congress used in the \nstatute.”  Lowe v. SEC, 472 U.S. 181, 207 n.53 (1985).   \nThird, unlike Biden, HHS does not have a “longstanding practice . . . [of] \nimplementing the relevant statutory authorities” here similar to the vaccine mandate.  See \n142 S. Ct. at 652.  In Biden, after concluding that the CMS mandate fit within the language \nof the statute, the Supreme Court explained that the Secretary’s history of relying on the \nsame statutory language in imposing other conditions on healthcare facilities and healthcare \nworkers supported its finding.  Id. at 652–53.  Citing examples of such conditions, the Court \nstated that “the Secretary has always justified these sorts of requirements by citing his \nauthorities to protect patient health and safety.”  Id. at 653.  Here, however, although the \n– 36 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 37 of 69   PageID 25363\ndefendants cite several standards and regulations relating to health generally, the defendants \ndo not identify which, if any, rely specifically on the same statutory language—Section \n1986a.  See Dkt. No. 52 at 32–36.  Instead, the defendants broadly state that HHS has taken \nsimilar measures in the past and, over the years, has implemented regulations pertaining to \nprogram participants and staff.  Id. at 32–35.  As noted above, the Court does not doubt that \nthe Secretary can establish certain performance standards related to “health services” or that \nhe has done so before.  But unlike Biden, the defendants here fail to point to any specific \nconditions in which the Secretary relied solely and specifically on same statutory authority \nas the Rule.  See id. at 32–36.  Thus, Biden does not support the defendants’ argument.  And \nthe defendants’ admission that the vaccine mandate marks the first time that Head Start has \never mandated a health procedure as a precondition to new or ongoing employment only \ncuts against their argument that a longstanding practice exists here.  See Dkt. No. 41 at 46–\n47. \nFourth, the other statutory provisions that the defendants cite—none of which the \nSecretary cited in promulgating the Rule—only demonstrate that the Rule is unprecedented \nand unauthorized.  Several of the provisions that the plaintiffs mention focus on the training \nand professional development of Head Start staff.  Id. at 32 (citing 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 9832(21)(G)(i); 9843(b)(2)(D), (d)(1)(G)).  Others discuss providing easier access for \nstudents to attend Head Start and obtain services, such as allowing families of homeless \nchildren to apply to, enroll in, and attend Head Start so long as immunization and other \nrecords are obtained within a reasonable time frame or removing barriers so that Head Start \nparticipants in rural communities can obtain health screenings.  Id. (citing 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 9835(m)(2); 9843(a)(3)(B)(xii)(VI)).  And one provision explains that the Secretary must \n– 37 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 38 of 69   PageID 25364\nconsider the effects of any revisions on the quality, scope, or types of health services \nrequired to be provided.  Id. (citing 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(2)(C)(ii)).  Nevertheless, none of \nthese provisions discuss vaccination mandates, much less grant authority to condition \nemployment on a vaccine under the threat of termination.  In any event, the Secretary did \nnot rely on any of these in promulgating the Rule.  See 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,052.  Thus, \ncontrary to the defendants’ argument, these provisions only lend additional support to the \nCourt’s conclusion that the Rule is unprecedented and unauthorized. \nC.  Vaccination requirements for Head Start staff and volunteers involve state-  \ngovernment—not federal agency—matters. \n \nMoreover, to the extent the regulations governing Head Start staff and volunteers \nshed light on the scope of the Secretary’s authority under the statute, they do not authorize \nthis Rule’s mandate.  Rather, they imply that conducting an initial health examination and \nperiodically screening or testing workers may be permissible when done in “accordance \nwith state, tribal, or local requirements.”  See 45 C.F.R. §§ 1302.93–94 (2021) (requiring staff \nand volunteers to test for communicable diseases “in accordance with state, tribal[,] or \nlocal” laws and requirements).15  These provisions suggest two ideas, neither of which \nsupport the defendants’ arguments.   \nFirst, testing employees for communicable diseases may, in some circumstances, be \npermissible.  But the Rule does not require merely periodic testing.  It mandates a vaccine, \n \n15 The defendants also rely on regulations that require staff to clean play areas and wash their hands \nafter restroom use or changing diapers.  Dkt. No. 52 at 55 (citing 45 C.F.R. § 1302.47(b)(6)(i) (2021) \n(hand hygiene); 45 C.F.R. § 1302.47(b)(2)(i) (cleaning and disinfecting play areas and equipment)).  \nSuch basic hygiene practices fall well short of demonstrating that the Head Start Act authorizes \nmandatory vaccination for staff under a threat of termination.  And the staff-training provisions that \nthe defendants cite also refer to state and local requirements, indicating that federal rules do not \nsolely govern.  Dkt. No. 52 at 55 (citing 45 C.F.R. § 1302.47(b)(4)).  \n– 38 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 39 of 69   PageID 25365\nwhich requires an invasive medical procedure.  Nothing in the regulations contemplate that \nthe federal government can require staff, volunteers, and contractors to be immunized.   \nSecond, testing only occurs when conducted consistent with “state, tribal, and local” \nlaws and requirements.  Id.  This confirms what the Supreme Court has recognized for over \na century: public health and safety regulation belongs, in the first instance, to the States.  \nJacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 25, 38 (1905) (recognizing that the “safety and the \nhealth of the people of” states are for States to “guard and protect” through their general \n“police power[s]”).   \nIn this respect, the defendants demonstrate the shortcomings of their arguments.  \nThey repeatedly affirm the notion that vaccine requirements “have had particular \nprominence in the education context.”  Dkt. No. 52 at 40 (citing Klaassen v. Trs. Of Ind. \nUniv., 7 F.4th 592, 593 (7th Cir. 2021) (upholding a state university’s vaccination \nrequirement)).  But for “centuries,” states—not federal agencies—have compelled vaccine \nrequirements in the education context.  See, e.g., 25 Tex. Admin. Code § 97.63(2)(A) \n(requiring that “[c]hildren enrolled in child-care facilities, pre-kindergarten, or early \nchildhood programs” be immunized against a host of diseases); Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-702 \n(West) (outlining immunization requirements for school children). 16   \n \n16 The defendants also cite 42 U.S.C. § 9837(c)(1)(E)(iii), which requires that Head Start programs \ncomply with “applicable State, tribal, and local laws,” and allege that all Head Start personnel \nmust therefore meet the child-care standards of the states in which they operate.  The defendants \nthen argue that Texas’s Minimum Standards for Child-Care Centers require child-care programs to \ndevelop a policy mandating staff vaccination, meaning that all Head Start personnel should be \nvaccinated.  Dkt. No. 52 at 33 (citing 26 Tex. Admin. Code § 746.3611).  First, this argument also \nevidences that state and local requirements govern.  Second, contrary to the defendants’ assertion, \nthe language states that a child-care program must “[s]pecify any vaccines that [they] have \ndetermined an employee must have for vaccine-preventable diseases,” indicating that the program \nhas the authority to make that determination.  Admin. § 746.3611(1). \n– 39 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 40 of 69   PageID 25366\nThe vaccine mandate at issue here comes from a federal agency, not a state.  \nCongress must use “exceedingly clear language if it wishes to significantly alter the balance \nbetween federal and state power.”  U.S. Forest Serv. V. Cowpasture River Pres. Ass’n, 140 S. Ct. \n1837, 1849–50 (2020) (citing Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991)).  Congress’s \nfailure to use “exceedingly clear language” in any part of the statute further supports what \nthe plain language of “performance standards” indicates: the defendants do not have \nauthority to issue the vaccine mandate.17   \nD.  The Supreme Court addressed a different statute in Biden v. Missouri, and  \nnothing about its analysis requires a different result here. \n \n    The defendants cite Biden v. Missouri’s allowance of the Medicare and Medicaid \nvaccine mandate as support for their assertion that HHS likewise had statutory authority for \nthe Head Start mandate.  Dkt. No. 52 at 27–40.  The Court recognizes, of course, that the \nSupreme Court held in Biden v. Missouri that the Secretary did not exceed his statutory \nauthority in conditioning funding on healthcare workers receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.  \n \n17 This conclusion is especially apparent if the “major questions doctrine” applied.  The Supreme \nCourt recently reaffirmed that it “expect[s] Congress to speak clearly when authorizing an agency \nto exercise powers of ‘vast economic and political significance.’”  Ala. Ass’n of Realtors, 141 S. Ct. at \n2489 (quoting Util. Air Regul. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014)).  Several factors here favor \napplying this additional level of scrutiny, such as the Office of Management and Budget’s \ndeclaration that the Rule is a “major rule” because it will “have an annual effect on the economy of \n$100 billion or more” (86 Fed. Reg. at 68,063), the $10 billion in grants to Head Start programs” \nthat ACF awards (id. at 68,100), and the 273,000 staff and a share of the one million volunteers \nwho will be affected (id. at 68,068–69).  But at least one circuit court has recently held that the \ndoctrine did not apply to rules with much larger economic effects and arguably equivalent political \nsignificance because the rules at issue were not “an enormous and transformative expansion in [the \nagencies’] regulatory authority.”  Florida v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 19 F.4th 1271, 1287 (11th \nCir. 2021) (order denying injunction pending appeal of the CMS mandate) (quoting Utility Air, 573 \nU.S. at 324).  Nevertheless, here, the Court need not evaluate whether the major question doctrine \napplies. Under traditional principles of statutory interpretation, and even without the major-\nquestions doctrine’s more exacting standard, the defendants’ construction is impermissible.  If the \ndoctrine did apply, however, the plaintiffs would prevail even more easily because Congress has \nnot spoken clearly in authorizing HHS to impose the expansive and unprecedented mandates on \nHead Start programs. \n– 40 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 41 of 69   PageID 25367\n142 S. Ct. at 653.  And the Court understands the defendants’ attempt to leverage an \nauthorized vaccine mandate, which stems from the same agency, to justify the mandate \nhere.  See Dkt. No. 52 at 27–40.  The Court, however, is reminded of Justice Holmes’s \nfamous admonition: “We must think things not words, or at least we must constantly \ntranslate our words into the facts for which they stand, if we are to keep to the real and the \ntrue.”  Oliver W. Holmes, Law in Science and Science in Law, 12 Harv. L. Rev. 443, 460 \n(1889).  Here, Biden v. Missouri’s holding does not change the fact that the Head Start \nmandate relies on materially different statutory language for authorization, does not involve \na tradition of similar practices, and involves a materially different statutory context.  For \nthese reasons, Biden v. Missouri does not compel the Court to alter its prior analysis and \nconclude that the Head Start mandate is authorized.  \n                In Biden, the Supreme Court held that the Secretary had not exceeded his statutory \nauthority in issuing an interim final rule requiring that employees in facilities participating \nin Medicare and Medicaid be vaccinated.  142 S. Ct. at 653; see also 86 Fed. Reg. 61,555 \n(2021).  The Supreme Court relied first on the language of the statute itself, concluding that \nthe CMS mandate fit neatly within it.  Id. at 652.  The statute expressly grants the Secretary \nwith the power to impose conditions “necessary in the interest of the health and safety of \nindividuals who are furnished services.”  Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(e)(9)).  Similarly, \nthe CMS mandate states that the Secretary “concluded that a vaccine mandate is ‘necessary \nto promote and protect patient health and safety’ in the face of the ongoing pandemic.”  Id. \n(quoting 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,613).  The Supreme Court went on to discuss the longstanding \npractices of CMS that were similar to the vaccine mandate, noting that “healthcare facilities \nthat wish to participate in Medicare and Medicaid have always been obligated to satisfy a \n– 41 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 42 of 69   PageID 25368\nhost of conditions that address the safe and effective provision of healthcare” and that the \nSecretary “routinely imposes conditions of participation that relate to the qualifications and \nduties of healthcare workers themselves.”  Id. at 652–53.  And third, the Supreme Court \nrelied on the healthcare context, noting that a vaccine mandate is consistent with the \nmedical profession and its purpose of restoring patients back to health.  Id. at 652.  Here, in \ncontrast, none of those rationales support the Head Start mandate. \n                First, the healthcare-worker mandate and the Head Start mandate rest on \nmaterially different statutory language.  The CMS mandate stems from a different statute \nthan the one that the Secretary claims gave it authority here, the Head Start Act.  Id. at 650; \ncompare 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(e)(9), with 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(C)–(E).  Specifically, the \nauthorizing text for the CMS mandate provides that the Secretary may promulgate such \n“requirements as [he] finds necessary in the interest of the health and safety.”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 1395x(e)(9).  Here, however, the Secretary has expressly disclaimed any reliance on the \nHead Start Act’s subsection (A), which allows the Secretary to “modify performance \nstandards” for “services required to be provided, including health.”  Dkt. No. 41 at 40–41; \nsee also 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(1)(A).  Thus, contrary to the Secretary’s reliance on “health \nand safety” language in promulgating the CMS mandate, the Secretary argues that the Rule \nhere qualifies as an administrative standard, a standard relating to the condition of facilities, \nor “such other” similar standards.  As detailed above, however, this language cannot \nauthorize Head Start’s vaccine mandate.  See supra Section 4.A.  Thus, Biden does not \nforeclose the Court’s interpretation of the statute. \nMoreover, the CMS mandate fits naturally into the statute’s health-and-safety \nlanguage, but the Rule here does not.  See 42 CFR §§ 416.25–416.54.  As the Supreme \n– 42 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 43 of 69   PageID 25369\nCourt explained, the Secretary relied on the authority conferred upon him by 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1395x(e)(9) and other similar provisions.  Biden, 142 S. Ct. at 650, 652 (comparing Section \n1395x(e)(9) with 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,613).  Thus, in that case, the mandate “fit[] neatly \nwithin the language of the statute.”  Biden, 142 S. Ct. at 652.  Here, however, the Rule does \nnot directly fit within the non-health-related language of the Head Start Act on which the \nSecretary relied.  As previously discussed, those subsections cannot be reasonably read to \nprovide the Secretary with authority, much less explicitly spell out, that the Secretary could \npromulgate a vaccine mandate. \nSecond, unlike Biden, there is no “longstanding practice of Health and Human \nServices in implementing the relevant statutory authorities.”  Id. at 652.  As detailed above, \nthe defendants attempt to establish that various Head Start regulations support the vaccine \nmandate, but the examples miss the mark.  See supra Section 4.B.  Understandably, in the \ncontext of hospitals and the provision of healthcare, HHS has implemented health \nregulations and conditions on participation showing that the Secretary has exercised broad \nauthority in administering Medicare and Medicaid.  Biden, 142 S. Ct. at 652–53.  The same \nis not true in the realm of pre-K education for low-income children.  See supra Section 4.B. \nThird, the analysis in Biden springs from a materially different context than pre-K \neducation.  As the Supreme Court noted, “ensuring that providers take steps to avoid \ntransmitting a dangerous virus to their patients is consistent with the fundamental principle \nof the medical profession: first, do no harm.  It would be the very opposite of efficient and \neffective administration for a facility that is supposed to make people well to make them sick \nwith COVID-19.”  Biden, 142 S. Ct. at 652.  The CMS mandate governs hospitals, doctors, \nand other healthcare workers.  See id. at 652–53.  These are individuals directly concerned \n– 43 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 44 of 69   PageID 25370\nwith providing healthcare to vulnerable patients in the medical field.  Id.  Thus, the Supreme \nCourt explained that the Secretary’s “response [to COVID-19 by implementing the \nmandate] is not a surprising one” because “[v]accination requirements are a common \nfeature of the provision of healthcare in America.”  Id. At 653.  Here, in contrast, \nvaccination requirements are not a common feature of the provision of education, as the \ndefendants recognize.  See Dkt. No. 41 at 46–47 (defendants acknowledging that this is the \nfirst time that Head Start has ever mandated a medical procedure as a precondition to new \nor ongoing employment).  Head Start’s Rule applies to employees, volunteers, and \ncontractors—educators—whose main purpose is to promote the school-readiness of needy \nchildren.  See 42 U.S.C. § 9831.  Thus, the broader context—the provision healthcare in \nhospitals—lent great support for the CMS mandate, but the broader context weighs against \nthe defendants here. \n                In sum, the statutory language, related agency practices, and context all supported \nthe Secretary’s position in Biden that the CMS mandate did not lack statutory authorization.  \nBut because the same is not true here, and this Court is faced with materially different \nlanguage, practices, and context, the Court reaches the opposite conclusion.  \n5.  The Rule does not follow proper rulemaking procedures.  \nEven if the Head Start Act allowed the Secretary to impose the vaccine mandate \nunder the guise of modifying “performance standards”—which it does not—the Rule cannot \nstand for another fundamental reason: it violates proper rulemaking procedures.  Under the \nAPA, the Court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “not in accordance \nwith law,” “without observance of procedure required by law,” or “in excess of statutory . . . \nlimitations.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C)–(D).  Because the Secretary issued the Rule without \n– 44 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 45 of 69   PageID 25371\nnotice and comment in violation of the APA—and without consultation with certain \nstakeholders as required by the Head Start Act—the Rule is unlawful. \n  A.  The Secretary did not have good cause to issue the Rule without notice and  \ncomment. \n \nUnder the APA, an agency typically must first publish notice of a proposed rule and \ngive the public opportunity to comment before adopting a final rule.  5 U.S.C. § 553(b), (c).  \nThe agency also must publish such rules at least thirty days before its effective date.  \nId. § 553(d).  These procedures are “designed to assure due deliberation.”  Smiley v. Citibank \n(S.D.), N.A., 517 U.S. 735, 741 (1996) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 553 and Thompson v. Clark, 741 F.2d \n401, 409 (D.C. Cir. 1984)).  But, on rare occasions, “both of these requirements may be \nbypassed if ‘good cause’ exists.”  United States v. Johnson, 632 F.3d 912, 927 (5th Cir. 2011) \n(quoting 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3)(B)). \nNotice-and-comment procedures do not apply “when the agency for good cause” \nfinds those procedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.”  \n5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3)(B).  Typically, the government’s “burden to show that good cause \nexists is a heavy one.”  United States v. Cain, 583 F.3d 408, 420 (6th Cir. 2009).  Indeed, the \nexception is to be “narrowly construed and only reluctantly countenanced.”  N.J., Dep’t of \nEnv’t Prot. v. EPA, 626 F.2d 1038, 1045 (D.C. Cir. 1980).  Nor can it provide agencies with \nan “‘escape clause’ from the requirements Congress prescribed.”  Johnson, 632 F.3d at 928 \n(quoting United States v. Garner, 767 F.2d 104, 120 (5th Cir. 1985)).  “Its use ‘should be \nlimited to emergency situations.’”  Util. Solid Waste Activities Grp. v. EPA, 236 F.3d 749, 754 \n(D.C. Cir. 2001) (quoting Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps. v. Block, 655 F.2d 1153, 1156 (D.C. Cir. \n1981)).  To determine whether “good cause” exists, the Court must “rely only on the ‘basis \n– 45 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 46 of 69   PageID 25372\narticulated by the agency itself’ at the time of the rulemaking.”  Johnson, 632 F.3d at 928 \n(quoting Garner, 767 F.2d at 116–17). \nThe defendants argue that “good cause” existed to skip notice and comment because \nit would be “impracticable and contrary to the public interest.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 68,059.  The \nSecretary cites several concerning factors, including “failure to achieve sufficiently high \nlevels of vaccination based on voluntary efforts and patchwork requirements, potential harm \nto children from unvaccinated staff, continuing strain on the health care system, and known \nefficacy and safety of available vaccines.”  Id.  Specifically, delaying the vaccine mandate \n“would endanger the health and safety of staff, children[,] and families” as programs \nprepared to return to fully in-person services.  Id.  The Court does not question the \nauthenticity of these concerns.  The only issue for the Court is whether HHS can show that \nnotice and comment was “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.”  \n5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3)(B).  It cannot. \nFirst, the Secretary gave staff and volunteers 62 days to get vaccinated after the \nRule’s effective date, requiring compliance by January 31, 2022.  With that amount of time, \nhowever, the Court does not see how providing notice and comment was “impracticable.”  \nNotice and comment would not have forced HHS to push back the vaccination-compliance \ndate.  Even if public participation did not affect the substance of the final rule, HHS could \nhave received comment and not sacrificed even one day in addressing the concerns it \noutlines. \nThe Court recognizes that “reasoned policy determination[s]” take time and do not \nnecessarily “undermine the state of emergency.”  See Florida, 19 F.4th 1271 (holding that the \ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the Secretary of HHS set forth a \n– 46 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 47 of 69   PageID 25373\nsufficient basis of good cause for waiving notice and comment).  But the Head Start Rule, \nsubstantially shorter and less complex, was issued 25 days after the OSHA vaccine-or-test \nrule and the CMS vaccine mandate were issued.  See COVID–19 Vaccination and Testing; \nEmergency Temporary Standard, 86 Fed. Reg. 61,402 (Nov. 5, 2021) (154-page OSHA ETS \nmandate); Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Omnibus COVID–19 Health Care Staff \nVaccination, 86 Fed. Reg. 61,555 (Nov. 5, 2021) (73-page CMS rule with an analysis of over \n200 cited sources).  The Court does not expect agencies to issue “emergency” rules in mere \ndays, or even a few weeks, after the President announces his intent to impose new rules.  \nBut this 82-day timeline combined with the 62-day vaccination-compliance period strongly \ndisfavors finding this degree of federal involvement in pre-K programs to be an emergency \nthat rendered notice and comment “impracticable.” \nAnd the defendants’ data arguably casts further doubt on the emergency nature of \ntheir concerns in this specific context.  The Secretary found that “uptake of vaccination \namong Head Start staff has not been as robust as hoped for.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 68,054.  In the \ndefendants’ cited survey, however, vaccination rates among childcare providers \n“significantly exceeded [rates among] the general population.”  Id. at 68,078.  In fact, the \ndefendants themselves estimate that Head Start staff are 12% more likely to be vaccinated.  \nId. at 68,069. \nIn light of the vaccine-compliance period, the defendants’ lengthy delay, and the \nrelatively high vaccination rates of their instructors, the Court finds that notice and \ncomment was not impracticable.  See Mid-Tex Elec. Coop., Inc. v. FERC, 822 F.2d 1123, 1132 \n(D.C. Cir. 1987) (recognizing that “the ‘good cause’ inquiry is inevitably fact- or context-\ndependent”).   \n– 47 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 48 of 69   PageID 25374\nRather than working against the public interest, notice and comment would have \nserved the public interest by ensuring “due deliberation” with the important stakeholders.  \nSmiley, 517 U.S. at 741 (citing 5 U.S.C. § 553 and Thompson, 741 F.2d at 409).  “The public \ninterest prong of the good cause exception is met only in the rare circumstance when \nordinary procedures—generally presumed to serve the public interest—would in fact harm \nthat interest.”  Mack Trucks, Inc. v. EPA, 682 F.3d 87, 95 (D.C. Cir. 2012).  Notice and \ncomment would have involved important stakeholders, many of whom were excluded from \nthe rulemaking process in violation of the Head Start Act itself.  42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(2)(A); \nsee infra Section 5.B (outlining the Secretary’s failure to consult with experts in the fields of \nearly childhood education, family services, administration and financial management, and \npersons with experience operating Head Start programs).  The Secretary’s decision silenced \nHead Start teachers, contractors, and volunteers—the very people who would face the \nrequirement of an invasive medical procedure under the threat of termination. \nFurthermore, public feedback seems particularly important here given the diversity of \nlocal health conditions across the country and the wide reach of the mandate.  86 Fed. Reg. \nat 68,058; see American Federation, 655 F.2d at 1156 (“The more expansive the regulatory \nreach . . . [,] the greater the necessity for public comment.”).  Rather than guessing that it \nwould be burdensome for large agencies to administer different policies for areas with \ndisparate COVID-19 transmission rates, HHS could have solicited their input through \nnotice and comment. \nTo be sure, HHS accepted comments until December 30, 2021.  86 Fed. Reg. 68,052.  \nBut “accepting post-promulgation comments” after the Rule’s effective date does not \n“excuse compliance with APA procedures.”  Johnson, 632 F.3d at 929.  This, too, is not an \n– 48 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 49 of 69   PageID 25375\nescape hatch.  “Permitting the submission of views after the effective date is no substitute for \nthe right of interested persons to make their views known to the agency in time to influence \nthe rule making process in a meaningful way.”  U.S. Steel Corp. v. EPA, 595 F.2d 207, 214 \n(5th Cir. 1979) (quoting City of New York v. Diamond, 379 F. Supp. 503, 517 (S.D.N.Y. \n1974)).  To allow otherwise would make the provisions of Section 553 “virtually \nunenforceable.”  Id. at 215. \nAnd although the Supreme Court found that the Secretary had good cause to forego \nnotice and comment in Biden, several salient differences exist here.  See 142 S. Ct. at 654.  \nFor instance, here, the Rule was issued nearly 25 days later than the CMS mandate, was \nnearly 25 pages shorter, and was less complex.  See 86 Fed. Reg. 68,052.  In addition, the \nCMS mandate dealt with healthcare providers and patients and sought to get ahead of the \nspread of illness inside of medical facilities themselves.  See Biden, 142 S. Ct. at 651–52.  \nThat connection is direct and clear, so it is understandable that the delay that notice and \ncomment would have caused could be viewed as “impracticable” or “contrary to public \ninterest” in that situation.  See 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3)(B).  But here, the Rule applies a vaccine \nmandate to teachers, volunteers, and other staff members working in an educational \nenvironment.  42 U.S.C. § 9831.  That connection is far more attenuated, which only \nemphasizes the need for the notice-and-comment period that existed here.   \nMoreover, the defendants did not appeal the Court’s preliminary-injunction order, \nchoosing instead to allow the deadline to pass and the preliminary injunction to remain in \nplace.  See Dkt. No. 45.  The defendants’ lack of action cuts against any argument that the \ndefendants were acting in response to a state of emergency constituting good cause. \n– 49 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 50 of 69   PageID 25376\n“The essential purpose of according § 553 notice and comment opportunities is to \nreintroduce public participation and fairness to affected parties after governmental authority \nhas been delegated to unrepresentative agencies.”  Batterton v. Marshall, 648 F.2d 694, 703 \n(D.C. Cir. 1980).  Here, the Secretary deprived the public and important stakeholders of this \nopportunity.  Ultimately, HHS did not have good cause to forgo the notice-and-comment \nperiod.   \nB.  The Secretary did not follow the procedures required to modify \nperformance standards under the Head Start Act.  \nIn addition, the Secretary did not follow the procedures set forth in the Head Start \nAct.  The statute requires the Secretary to comply with several requirements prior to \nmodifying “any” performance standards.  42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(2)(A). \nUnder the statute, the Secretary must: \n[C]onsult with experts in the fields of child development, early childhood \neducation,  child  health  care,  family  services  (including  linguistically  and \nculturally  appropriate  services  to  non-English  speaking  children  and  their \nfamilies), administration, and financial management, and with persons with \nexperience in the operation of Head Start programs. \n \nId.  Here, “[t]he Secretary consulted with experts in child health, including pediatricians, a \npediatric infectious disease specialist, and the recommendations of the CDC and FDA.”  86 \nFed. Reg. at 68,054.   \nThe Secretary failed, however, to consult with many of the required stakeholders.  \nNotable absentees from his list include experts in the fields of (1) “early childhood \neducation,” (2) “family services (including linguistically and culturally appropriate services \nto non-English speaking children and their families),” and (3) “administration[] and \nfinancial management.”  42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(2)(A).  The failure to consult with “persons \nwith experience in the operation of Head Start programs” is even more striking.  Id. \n– 50 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 51 of 69   PageID 25377\nThe defendants state tha51ertifyRule “certif[ies]” that the Secretary did consult with \nthose experts, repeating the general assertion that the Secretary “included relevant \nconsiderations” under Section 9836a(a)(2) when issuing the Rule.  Dkt. No. 59 at 15 \n(quoting 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,053–54) (emphasis added).  The defendants also argue that “the \nstatutory text imposes no requirement that the Secretary document these considerations into \nthe Rule itself.”  Id.  Nevertheless, the Secretary went out of his way to list in the Rule the \nexperts with whom he consulted and, in doing so, he omitted several required by the statute.  \nThe inclusion of those listed implies the exclusion of those not.  Cf. Barnhart v. Peabody Coal \nCo., 537 U.S. 149, 168 (2003) (finding that the expression of one thing implies the exclusion \nof others “when the items expressed are members of an ‘associated group or series’”) \n(quoting United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, 65 (2002)).   \nAdditionally, the Head Start Act also requires that “the Secretary [] consult with \nIndian tribes, including Alaska natives, experts in Indian, including Alaska Native, early \nchildhood education and development, linguists, and the National Indian Head Start \nDirectors Association on the review and promulgation of [program performance \nstandards],” which the Secretary failed to do.  42 U.S.C. § 9836a(a)(2)(D).  The defendants \npoint to the Tribal Consultation Statement included in the Rule, arguing that it indicates \nthat the Secretary “did in fact consult with the tribes.”  Dkt. No. 59 at 16.   \nBut the Tribal Consultation Statement merely provides general information on tribal \nconsultations, such as the average number of tribal consultations per year, the geographic \nlocation where these consultations take place, and the process through which ACF \ncompletes reports for these consultations and submits a final report to the Secretary.  86 Fed. \nReg. at 68,052.  Nowhere does it state that the defendants did, in fact, consult with the \n– 51 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 52 of 69   PageID 25378\nproper tribes, natives, and representatives before promulgating the review, like the statute \nexplicitly requires.  See id.  Instead, the Tribal Consultation Statement merely concludes, \n“We invite public comment on this [Rule] if there are concerns specific to Native \ncommunities and programs.”  Id.  As noted above, the inclusion of specific parties that the \nSecretary actually consulted with implies the exclusion of those not listed.  See Barnhart, 537 \nU.S. at 168. \nThe defendants also claim that Biden forecloses this argument because, there, the \nSupreme Court explained that, “[c]onsistent with the existence of the good cause exception, \nwhich was properly invoked here, consultation during the deferred notice-and-comment \nperiod is permissible.”  Dkt. No. 59 at 15 (quoting Biden, 142 S. Ct. at 654).  But because the \nCourt finds that good cause did not exist to defer the notice-and-comment period (see supra \nSection 5.A), the Court finds that the Secretary was required to consult with the appropriate \nparties as required by the statute but did not. \nFurthermore, the plaintiffs argue that the Secretary also failed to follow 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1986a(a)(2)(C)(ii), which requires that he “ensure that any such revisions in the standards \nwill not result in the elimination of or any reduction in quality, scope, or types of health, \neducational, parental involvement, nutritional, social, or other services required to be \nprovided under such standards as in effect on December 12, 2007.”  In response, the \ndefendants argue that the Rule itself evidences that the Secretary made these considerations.  \nDkt. No. 59 at 15–16.  They cite a portion of the Rule which states that the Secretary \n“considered the circumstances and challenges typically facing children and families served \nby Head Start agencies including the disproportionate effect of COVID-19 on low-income \ncommunities . . . and the potential for devastating consequences for children and families of \n– 52 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 53 of 69   PageID 25379\nprogram closures and service interruptions due to SARS-CoV-2 exposures.”  Dkt. Nos. 52 at \n61–62; 59 at 15–16 (quoting 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,054).   \nNevertheless, the Head Start Act explicitly requires that the Secretary consider the \nquality, scope, and type of services required by the standards as they were in December \n2007 in ensuring that any revisions to standards—such as the Rule here—do not eliminate \nor reduce any of that quality or scope, which the Secretary did not do.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 1986(a)(2)(C)(ii).  The Rule contains no discussion comparing the quality, scope, and type \nof services required to be provided in December 2007 to the quality, scope, and type of \nservices that might result after promulgation of the Rule.  See 86 Fed. Reg. 68,052.  And the \ndefendants do not cite any other document in the administrative record showing that the \nSecretary complied with this provision.  See Dkt. Nos. 52 at 60–62; 59 at 15–16.  Thus, \nwhile the Court does not deny that the Secretary did consider the general, potential effects \nof the Rule, the defendants fail to show that the Secretary did, in fact, meet the requirement \nset forth in 42 U.S.C. § 1986a(a)(2)(C)(ii). \n*    *    * \nThe Secretary’s failure to provide a notice-and-comment period in the absence of \ngood cause and to follow the requirements set forth by the Head Start Act is not in \naccordance with the “procedure required by law” and is “in excess of statutory . . . \nlimitations.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C), (D).  Thus, the Rule violates the APA and the Head \nStart Act on these grounds. \n6.  The Rule is arbitrary and capricious. \nIn addition, the Court finds that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious because it is \nunreasonably overbroad without a reasonable explanation.  It imposes a one-size-fits-all \n– 53 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 54 of 69   PageID 25380\napproach with no end date, failing to establish a “rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. \nIns. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, \n168 (1962)).  The lack of a reasoned explanation is especially concerning given that the Rule \nconstitutes a drastic change from Head Start’s tradition of local flexibility, CDC-reported \nsuccess in navigating the pandemic through flexibility, and the local programs’ reliance \ninterest on that flexibility.  See Dkt. No. 39-19 at 1–2. \nA court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings and conclusions \nfound to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  The Supreme Court recently rearticulated what this \nstandard requires:  \nThe APA’s arbitrary-and-capricious standard requires that agency action be \nreasonable and reasonably explained.  Judicial review under that standard is \ndeferential, and a court may not substitute its own policy judgment for that of \nthe agency.  A court simply ensures that the agency has acted within a zone of \nreasonableness and, in particular, has reasonably considered the relevant issues \nand reasonably explained the decision. \n \nFCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 141 S. Ct. 1150, 1158 (2021) (citing FCC v. Fox Television \nStations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 513–14 (2009) and State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43).  “Put simply, \n[courts] must set aside any action premised on reasoning that fails to account for ‘relevant \nfactors’ or evinces ‘a clear error of judgment.’”  Wages & White Lion Invs., L.L.C. 16 F.4th \n1130, 1136 (5th Cir. 2021).  In applying this standard, the Court is limited to “the basis \narticulated by the agency itself.”  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 50.  Accordingly, this Court’s \nreview is deferential and limited., but “it is by no means a rubber stamp.”  Garner, 767 F.2d \nat 116.   \n– 54 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 55 of 69   PageID 25381\nHere, the Rule fails even under this deferential review.  First, the Secretary made no \ndistinctions in the Rule based on size, location, or transmission rates.  The Head Start \nRule’s requirements are universal.  Contra In re MCP, 21 F.4th 357, 367 (2022) (upholding \nOSHA standard applying only to employers of a certain size); Ala. Ass’n of Realtors, 141 S. \nCt. at 2490 (vacating stay of CDC eviction moratorium, which applied only in counties with \nhigh transmission rates).  Notably, the Secretary acknowledged regional differences in \nCOVID-19 transmission,21 but he did not “reasonably explain” his failure to accommodate \nsuch differences.  Prometheus Radio Project, 141 S. Ct. at 1158.  The Secretary found that \n“cases are trending downward” in some states.  86 Fed. Reg. at 68,058.  But “there are \nemerging indications of potential increase in others—particularly northern states where the \nweather has begun to turn colder.”  Id.   \nAn agency is “not required to identify the optimal threshold” of rule distinctions \nbased on size, location, or transmission rates “with pinpoint precision.”  In re MCP, 21 F.4th \nat 383.  And “[c]ourts are ‘generally unwilling to review line-drawing performed by the \n[agency] unless a petitioner can demonstrate that lines drawn . . . are patently unreasonable, \nhaving no relationship to the underlying regulatory problem.”  Id. (alteration in original) \n(quoting Cassell v. FCC, 154 F.3d 478, 485 (D.C. Cir. 1998)).  But the Rule does not account \nfor any of the previously mentioned differences.  Without reasonably considering the \nrelevant issues or reasonably explaining the decision, it imposed a novel, universal \napproach. \nContrary to this approach, Head Start has a documented history of success from \nflexible practices depending on local needs.  Dkt. Nos. 56 at 91–92; 27 at 4 (OHS May 2021 \n \n21 See 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,058. \n– 55 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 56 of 69   PageID 25382\nguidance listed in the administrative record); 29-9 (CDC report included in the \nadministrative record).  In its May 2021 guidance, the agency recognized that “[t]o date, \nOHS provided needed flexibilities and guidance that allowed programs to adapt services \nbased on the changing health conditions in their communities.”  Dkt. No. 56 at 91 (emphasis \nadded).  As a result, some Head Start programs offered virtual and remote services, but \n“[m]any programs continued to provide in-person services for children and families \nthroughout the COVID-19 pandemic.”  Id.  The guidance instructed its in-person programs \n“to continue serving children in person, as local health conditions allow” and encouraged \nprograms to “move to in-person services, as local health conditions allow.”  Id. at 91–92 \n(emphasis added).  During the pandemic, local programs decided to close, operate remotely \nor hybrid, or offer fully in-person services, depending on their circumstances.  86 Fed. Reg. \nat 68,058.  In September 2021, 73% of centers were open for in-person services, 14% \noperated in a hybrid model, and 4% were virtual.  Id.  Only 2% were entirely closed due to \nCOVID-19.  Id.  This history makes clear that the defendants recognized the importance of \ntailoring COVID-19 policy for months and that local centers were able to navigate the \npandemic successfully.   \nThere is no doubt that Head Start’s traditional local-flexibility approach worked and \nthat this data of success was before the agency when it nevertheless imposed the one-size-\nfits-all Rule.  A December 2020 report from the CDC studied the implementation of \nmitigation strategies in early childhood education settings.  Dkt. No. 29-9.  The CDC \nreported that, while “most states required all schools (K-12) to close or transition to virtual \nlearning,” the Office of Head Start “gave its local programs that remained open the \nflexibility to use CARES Act funds to implement CDC-recommended guidance.”  Id. at 1.  \n– 56 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 57 of 69   PageID 25383\nThe result?  “Head Start programs successfully implemented CDC-recommended mitigation \nstrategies and supported other practices that helped to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission \namong children and staff members.”  Id.  The CDC stressed that the flexibility provided to \nlocal Head Start programs was key to the success: “Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, \nHead Start and Early Head Start programs successfully implemented CDC-recommended \nmitigation strategies and applied other innovative approaches to limit SARS-CoV-2 \ntransmission among children, teachers, and other staff members by allowing maximum \nprogram flexibility and allocating financial and human resources.”  Id. at 3.  The report \nconcludes that “[c]hild care settings should implement concurrent preventive measures and \nadjust these strategies based on community transmission data.”  Id. at 4.   \nMost recently, the Secretary even withdrew the previously imposed, universal mask \nrequirement in favor of local flexibility.  88 Fed. Reg. at 993–94.  Initially, the Rule required \nall Head Start students and staff to wear masks in almost all situations.  The updated Final \nRule, however, explains that “[r]emoving the universal mask requirement and replacing it \nwith the requirement of an evidence-based COVID-19 mitigation strategy allows Head Start \nprograms to adapt to changing circumstances, to consider the unique challenges and needs \nfaced by individual programs, and still supports the safest environments for the workforce, \nand the children and families Head Start serves.”  Id. at 994.  The Secretary persists, \nhowever, in the Rule’s vaccine mandate—again without explanation.  See id. at 993. \nDespite the longstanding practice of local flexibility and its documented success, the \ndefendants attempt to justify their one-size-fits-all approach by stating that it would be \n“burdensome” for grant recipients that cover large geographic areas to issue different \nguidance to programs in different locations.  86 Fed. Reg. at 68,066.  But such a conclusory \n– 57 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 58 of 69   PageID 25384\nallegation constitutes willful ignorance of the facts and issues in a rushed attempt to achieve \nits goals.  Head Start agencies covered large areas and adjusted as necessary prior to the \nRule, and the defendants cite no evidence indicating that it was burdensome to do so then \nor now.22  To the contrary, ACF admits that it has “relied on the importance of local health \nconditions in issuing guidance to Head Start programs” before and acknowledges the \ndiversity in transmission rates.  Id; see also id. at 68,058.  Moreover, the Rule ignores CDC \nguidance “that localities should monitor community transmission in making decisions” and \nthe CDC’s report that Head Start had successfully navigated the pandemic through \n“maximum program flexibility.”  Id. at 68,066; Dkt. No. 29-9 at 3.  \nRejecting or ignoring this guidance and data—and failing to articulate why local \nconditions are no longer vital policy tools—ACF simply states that it is prioritizing an easy-\nto-follow “clear and transparent policy” and that “children benefit from routine and \npredictability.”  86 Fed. Reg. 68,066.  Again, ACF cites no evidence supporting these \nconclusory statements in relation to the Rule and does not provide any reasonable, \nmeaningful explanation of the Rule.  Instead, it implements a one-size-fits-all approach \nwithout articulating “a satisfactory explanation for its action including a ‘rational \nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.’”  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 \n(quoting Burlington, 371 U.S. at 168).  Therefore, the Court does “not defer to the agency’s \nconclusory or unsupported suppositions.” United Techs. Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., 601 F.3d \n557, 562–63 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (quoting McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of the Air Force, \n375 F.3d 1182, 1187 (D.C. Cir. 2004)). \n \n22 Because the defendants precluded pre-promulgation comment, they appear to be guessing at the \nexact “burden[]” this will cause local agencies.  See id. at 68,066.  \n– 58 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 59 of 69   PageID 25385\nThe validity of this conclusion is especially apparent in light of the Rule’s drastic \nchange from past practice.  Although an agency need not always provide a detailed \nexplanation for a new policy, “[s]ometimes it must.”  Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. at \n515.  Supreme Court precedent makes clear that when a new policy “rests upon factual \nfindings that contradict those which underlay its prior policy,” or when an agency’s “prior \npolicy has engendered serious reliance interests,” it is “arbitrary or capricious to ignore such \nmatters.”  Id.  As explained above, the Rule rests on a one-size-fits-all finding that \ncontradicts its prior approach, and the agency’s prior flexibility engendered serious reliance \ninterests.  Thus, “further justification [was] demanded” but not provided, rendering the Rule \narbitrary and capricious.  See id. at 516. \nThe plaintiffs also argue that ACF’s failure to establish an end date is arbitrary and \ncapricious.  Dkt. No. 54-1 at 48.  In the Rule, ACF offered no explanation for its choice.  \nSee 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,066.  Rather, it only “invites comment” on whether to establish a \n“finite end date.”  Id.  The defendants counter that ACF decided not to include an end date \nbecause “children benefit from routine and predictability.”  Dkt. No. 26 at 31 (quoting 86 \nFed. Reg. at 68,066).  Under a fair reading of the Rule, ACF likely did not offer that reason \nto explain its choice.  But even if it did, it would not support omitting an end date.    \nACF asserts that “children benefit from routine and predictability” not to explain its \nchoice to omit an end date but to partially explain its decision to impose universal mandates \nwithout regard to regional transmission rates.  Dkt. No. 52 at 48 (quoting 86 Fed. Reg. at \n68,066).  But if children benefit from predictability, then imposing an end date would serve \nthat purpose.  By failing to include an end date, ACF made the rule’s application \nunpredictable. In any event, that justification has little to no relevance upon the Head Start \n– 59 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 60 of 69   PageID 25386\nstaff members facing the vaccine mandate—a concern entirely separate from whether \nchildren have routine and predictability.  Therefore, to the extent ACF actually included an \nexplanation for this choice, it is certainly not reasonable in the context of the vaccine \nrequirement.  See generally Prometheus Radio Project, 141 S. Ct. at 1158.  Though this is not a \nstand-alone basis to invalidate the Rule, when viewed together with the Rule’s overbreadth \nand change in policy, it takes the Secretary’s decision outside “the zone of reasonableness.”  \nId. at 1160. \nAnd although the defendants point to Biden in arguing that the Rule is not arbitrary \nor capricious (Dkt. No. 52 at 42), the Supreme Court reached its conclusion regarding the \nCMS mandate on different grounds in a different context.  The rule-making record in Biden \ndemonstrated that the agency examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation.  142 S. Ct. at 653–54.  As explained above, however, the administrative record \nin this case proves the opposite.  Furthermore, Biden did not involve the Secretary’s sudden \nshift from a long-standing and successful practice of local flexibility to a one-size-fits-all \napproach, which is what occurred here.  See id.  Therefore, because the Rule is unreasonably \noverbroad without a rational explanation, Biden is distinguishable.  The Court finds that the \nRule is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA.   \nUltimately, for the reasons stated above, the Court finds that summary judgment \nshould be granted in favor of the plaintiffs.  The defendants’ motion to dismiss for failure to \n– 60 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 61 of 69   PageID 25387\nstate a claim and motion for summary judgment are denied.23  The Court now turns to the \nissue of remedy.24 \n7.  The Court sets aside the Rule and holds it unlawful. \n  The plaintiffs ask the Court to hold unlawful and set aside the Rule.25  Dkt. No. 54-1 \nat 52.  For the reasons explained below, the Court grants that relief. \n  A.  The Rule is vacated and remanded. \n  Pursuant to the APA, a court “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action” \nthat is in excess of statutory authority, arbitrary and capricious, or without observance of \nprocedure.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  Section 706(2) goes “beyond the mere non-enforcement \nremedies available to courts” and “empowers courts to set aside—i.e., formally nullify and \nrevoke—an unlawful agency action.”  Data Mktg. P’ship, LP v. U.S. Dep’t of Lab., 45 F.4th \n \n23 Where one party moves for dismissal under Rule 12 and summary judgment under Rule 56, the \nCourt may treat the “hybrid” motion as “a summary judgment motion when a district court \nconsiders materials beyond the pleadings.”  Moore v. Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company, \nNo. 21-20103, 2022 WL 16860550, at *2 (5th Cir. Nov. 11, 2022) (citing Isquith ex rel. Isquith v. \nMiddle S. Utils. Inc., 847 F.2d 186, 193–95 (5th Cir. 1988)); see also Letcher v. Turner, 968 F.2d 508, \n509 (5th Cir. 1992). \n \n24 The Court is aware that other courts have reached divergent conclusions regarding the Rule.  See \nDkt. Nos. 65; 67 (notifying the Court of supplemental authority); Livingston Educational Service \nAgency v. Becerra, 35 F.4th 489, 491–93 (6th Cir. 2022) (denying a motion for an injunction pending \nappeal based on a holding that HHS likely had statutory authority and likely did not violate the \nAPA); Louisiana v. Becerra, No. 3:21-CV-04370, 2022 WL 4370448, at *7–12 (W.D. La. Sept. 21, \n2022) (permanently enjoining the Rule in twenty-four states because the Secretary lacked statutory \nauthority).  The Court has reviewed these nonbinding cases but notes that the issues remain open \nin the Fifth Circuit.  And for the reasons previously discussed, the Court is not persuaded by a \ncontrary authority that the Rule is authorized or does not violate the APA. \n \n25 The plaintiffs also request a permanent injunction.  Dkt. No. 54-1 at 52–53.  However, they seek \nthis request based on arguments that the Court does not and need not reach.  See id.  If vacatur is \n“sufficient to redress [the plaintiffs’] injury,” an injunction is not warranted.  Monsanto Co. v. \nGeertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 165–66 (2010). \n– 61 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 62 of 69   PageID 25388\n846, 859 (5th Cir. 2022) (internal quotation marks omitted).  “Agency action” encompasses \n“an agency rule,” such as the Rule at issue here. 26  See 5 U.S.C. § 551(13).   \nWhen awarding relief under Section 706(2), the Court may fashion the remedy in \none of two ways: remand the Rule with vacatur or remand the Rule without vacatur.  See \nTexas v. United States, 50 F.4th 498, 529–30 (5th Cir. 2022).  As the Fifth Circuit has \nexplained, the default rule is to vacate and remand the unlawful agency action.  Data Mktg. \nP’ship, LP, 45 F.4th at 859.  Remand without vacatur, on the other hand, is an “exceptional \nremedy” that courts may provide in exercising their discretion.  Am. Great Lakes Ports Ass’n v. \nSchultz, 962 F.3d 510, 519 (D.C. Cir. 2020); Brown v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., No. 4:22-CV-0908, \n2022 WL 16858525, at *14 (N.D. Tex. Nov. 10, 2022).  Remand with vacatur “re-\nestablish[es] the status quo” before the unlawful agency action took place.  Texas, 40 F.4th \nat 220.  Remand without vacatur, however, “leaves the rule in place during remand.”  Am. \nForest Res. Council v. Ashe, 946 F. Supp. 2d 1, 43 (D.D.C. 2013).  Consequently, “remand \nwithout vacatur creates a risk that an agency may drag its feet and keep in place an unlawful \nagency rule.”  EME Homer City Generation, L.P. v. EPA, 795 F.3d 118, 132 (D.C. Cir. 2015).   \nAs such, remand without vacatur is appropriate only “when there is at least a serious \npossibility that the agency will be able to substantiate its decision given an opportunity to do \nso.”  State v. Biden, 10 F.4th at 560 (quoting Texas Ass’n of Mfrs. v. U.S. Consumer Prod. Safety \nComm’n, 989 F.3d 368, 389 (5th Cir. 2021)). \n  When deciding whether vacatur is appropriate, a federal court considers two factors.  \nFirst, the Court evaluates “the seriousness of the deficiencies of the action,” or in other \nwords, “how likely it is the agency will be able to justify its decision on remand.”  Texas, 50 \n \n26 The parties do not contest that the Rule constitutes “agency action.”  See Dkt. Nos. 52; 54-1.  \n– 62 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 63 of 69   PageID 25389\nF.4th at 529.  Second, the Court assesses “the disruptive consequences of the vacatur.”  Id.  \n“A strong showing of one factor may obviate the need to find a similar showing of the \nother.”  Am. Bankers Ass’n v. Nat’l Credit Union Admin., 934 F.3d 649, 674 (D.C. Cir. 2019). \n  As to the first factor, the Rule is deficient on several grounds.  As previously \ndiscussed, the Rule is not supported by statutory authority (see supra Section 4), fails to \nobserve procedural requirements (see supra Section 5), and is arbitrary and capricious (see \nsupra Section 6).  Additionally, the defendants have failed to explain how they would be \nable to substantiate the Rule if given the opportunity to do so; in fact, they make no attempt \nto address this issue in their briefing.  See Dkt. No. 59 at 22–24; see also State, 10 F.4th at 560 \n(noting that the agency had not explained, or even suggested, how it could substantiate its \ndecision in its motion or reply).  Without any such explanation, and in light of the severity \nof the Rule’s deficiencies, which weighs against remanding without vacatur, the Court finds \nit unlikely that HHS will be able to justify its decision on remand. \nThe second factor—disruptive consequences—also does not support remand without \nvacatur.  At the outset, the defendants do not raise any arguments as to this question, except \nto state that setting aside the Rule will affect other court decisions made or currently \npending across the country.  Dkt. No. 59 at 23–24.  That argument is more relevant to the \nquestion of the scope of relief, discussed in greater detail below.  See infra Section 7.B.  The \nCourt notes, however, that a preliminary injunction has been in effect in Texas since \nDecember 31, 2021.  Dkt. No. 42.  And now, the Rule has been permanently enjoined in at \nleast twenty-four other states.  Louisiana v. Becerra, No. 3:21-CV-04370, 2022 WL 4370448, \nat *14 (W.D. La Sept. 21, 2022).  Thus, any disruptive effect has already been limited by \nthese decisions.  In addition, the “uncertainty that typically attends vacatur of any rule” is \n– 63 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 64 of 69   PageID 25390\nnot sufficient for the second factor to weigh in favor of remanding without vacatur. Nat. Res. \nDefense Council v. Wheeler, 955 F.3d 68, 85 (5th Cir. 2020).  Moreover, the strong showing of \ndeficiencies noted above counsels against remanding the Rule without vacatur.  See Am. \nBankers Ass’n, 934 F.3d at 674.  Both factors, then, lead the Court to conclude that \nremanding the Rule with vacatur is appropriate.  Accordingly, the Court vacates the Rule. \n  B.  The relief granted here—vacating the Rule—cannot be limited to the  \nplaintiffs. \n  \n  The Court next considers the scope of the relief.  The defendants urge the Court to \nlimit relief, stating that the agency action should be set aside only as to the named plaintiffs.  \nDkt. No. 59 at 22–24.  The defendants assert that “the APA’s general instruction that \nunlawful agency action ‘shall’ be ‘set aside’ [] is insufficient” to vacate an agency action \nnationwide.  See id.   But they fail to point to any Supreme Court or Fifth Circuit precedent \nin support.  See Dkt. No. 59 at 22–24.  Instead, the defendants rely on cases addressing \ninjunctive relief.  See id. at 22–23 (citing Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 155 (1967); \nLouisiana v. Becerra, 20 F.4th 260, 264 (5th Cir. 2021); Texas v. United States, 14 F.4th 332, \n341 (5th Cir. 2021); and Marshall v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 554 F.2d 730, 735 (5th Cir. \n1977)).  Here, however, the Court is vacating the Rule under the APA.   \nPrecedent undermines the defendants’ position that vacatur should be limited to the \nplaintiffs.  In fact, the Supreme Court has affirmed lower court decisions universally \nvacating an agency action.  See, e.g., DHS v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1901, \n1916 & n.7 (2020).  Fifth Circuit precedent interpreting Section 706(2) also establishes a \npractice of vacating an agency action universally, not limiting vacatur to the named \nplaintiffs.  For instance, in Community Financial Services Ass’n of America, Ltd. v. Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau, two trade associations challenged a rule that the Consumer \n– 64 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 65 of 69   PageID 25391\nFinancial Protection Bureau had promulgated.  51 F.4th 616, 623 (5th Cir. 2022).  The Fifth \nCircuit concluded that the rule violated the Appropriations Clause and separation of \npowers; therefore, the rule violated the APA because the agency action was “not in \naccordance with law.”  Id. at 635–43 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)).  The Fifth Circuit \nvacated the rule universally in accordance with the APA; it did not limit the scope of the \nvacatur to the named plaintiffs in that case.  Id. at 643–44. \nLikewise, in Southwestern Electric Power Co. v. EPA, various environmental groups \nchallenged two portions of a rule that the EPA had promulgated.  920 F.3d 999, 1012 (5th \nCir. 2019).  Concluding that a portion of the rule was arbitrary and capricious, the Fifth \nCircuit vacated that portion and remanded it to the agency for reconsideration.  Id. at 1019, \n1021–22.  Again, the Fifth Circuit did not limit the remedy to the plaintiffs.  See id. \nFinally, in Texas v. United States, the Fifth Circuit conducted an extensive discussion \nof vacatur under the APA before ultimately affirming that DACA should be vacated and \nremanded.  50 F.4th at 529–30.  The Fifth Circuit also affirmed the district court’s decision \nto temporarily stay the order of immediate vacatur as to current DACA recipients pending \nthe outcome of a rulemaking proceeding, but the Fifth Circuit did not limit the scope of \nvacatur to only Texas and the other plaintiff states.  Id.27 \n \n27 Other Fifth Circuit cases demonstrate the same practice of vacating an agency action without \nlimiting the remedy to the plaintiffs.  See, e.g., Data Mktg. P’ship, LP, 45 F.4th at 859–60; Flight \nTraining Int’l, Inc. v. FAA, 58 F.4th 234, 245–46 (5th Cir. 2023); Chamber of Commerce of U.S. v. U.S. \nDep’t of Labor, 885 F.3d 360, 388 (5th Cir. 2018).  Courts across the country reach the same \nconclusion.  See, e.g., Harmon v. Thornburgh, 878 F.2d 484, 495 n.21 (D.C. Cir. 1989); Nat’l Min. \nAss’n v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 145 F.3d 1399, 1409 (D.C. Cir. 1998); Make the Rd. New York v. \nMcAleenan, 405 F. Supp. 3d 1, 66–72 (D.D.C. 2019) (Jackson, J.), rev’d and remanded on other \ngrounds, 962 F.3d 612 (D.C. Cir. 2020); New York v. Dep’t of Com., 351 F. Supp. 3d 502, 672 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2019), aff’d in part, rev’d in part on other grounds, 139 S. Ct. 2551 (2019). \n \n– 65 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 66 of 69   PageID 25392\nIn light of this precedent and the Court’s findings and conclusion, following the \nprecedent before the Court, the relief is not limited to the State of Texas and LISD.  Rather, \nthe Rule shall be universally set aside. 28 \n  C.  The entirety of the Rule is vacated. \n \n  The defendants ask the Court to apply severability principles and consider setting \naside only the portion of the Rule that violates the APA.  Dkt. No. 59 at 24.  An “[a]gency \naction” includes “the whole or a part of an agency rule.”  5 U.S.C. § 551(13).  And as \nexplained in Section 706(2), agency action that is in excess of statutory authority, is \narbitrary or capricious, or fails to follow procedural requirements must be “set aside.”  \nTherefore, a court may set aside “only the part of a rule found to be invalid.”  Franciscan \nAlliance, Inc. v. Azar, 414 F. Supp. 3d 928, 945 n.7 (N.D. Tex. Oct. 15, 2019).  Accordingly, \nin applying Section 706(2), the Fifth Circuit has previously vacated agency rules both in \nwhole and in part.  See, e.g., Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. U.S. Dep’t of Lab., 885 F.3d 360, 388 \n(5th Cir. 2018); Sw. Elec. Power Co., 920 F.3d at 1022.  A court exceeds its statutory scope of \nreview in vacating an agency rule in whole if “only a part is invalid” and “the remaining \n \n28 The Court is aware that the Supreme Court is currently considering what “set aside” under the \nAPA means.  See United States v. Texas, 143 S. Ct. 51 (2022) (granting certiorari and instructing the \nparties to address whether an immigration statute prevents courts from setting aside administrative \nguidelines under the APA); Transcript of Oral Argument at 36, United States v. Texas (No. 22-58) \n(“Your position on vacatur, that sounded to me to be fairly radical and inconsistent with, for \nexample, you know, with those of us who were on the D.C. Circuit, you know, five times before \nbreakfast, and that’s what you do in an APA case.”) (Roberts, C.J.).  In addition, there is ongoing \nscholarly debate on the subject, with some arguing that vacatur under the APA is universal and \nothers claiming that any relief should be limited in scope to only the plaintiffs.  Compare Mila \nSohoni, The Power to Vacate a Rule, 88 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1121 (2020), with John Harrison, Section \n706 of the Administrative Procedure Act Does Not Call for Universal Injunctions or Other Universal Remedies, \n37 Yale J. On Reg. Bull. 37, 41 (2020), and Samuel L. Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the \nNational Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417 (2017).  However, because the Supreme Court has not \nyet reached a decision, the Court follows Fifth Circuit precedent in vacating the Rule without \nlimitation to the named plaintiffs.  See, e.g., Sw. Elec. Power Co., 920 F.3d at 1022; Cmty. Fin. Servs. \nAss’n of Am., Ltd., 51 F.4th at 643; Texas, 50 F.4th at 529–30.  \n– 66 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 67 of 69   PageID 25393\nportion may sensibly be given independent life.”  Franciscan Alliance, Inc., 414 F. Supp. 3d at \n945 n.7.  Here, the plaintiffs challenge the Rule as a whole.  Dkt. No. 1 at 65–69.   \nAs explained in Sections 5 and 6, the Rule as a whole violates the APA because the \nSecretary did not follow proper rulemaking procedures in promulgating the Rule, and the \nRule is arbitrary and capricious.  These violations do not encompass merely portions of the \nRule.  The Rule also exceeds statutory authority. See supra Section 4.  Therefore, the entire \nrule is invalid.  See Franciscan Alliance, Inc., 414 F. Supp. 3d at 945 n.7.  In any event, the \nvaccine requirement and other portions of the Rule still in force are intertwined with and \nconnected to one another.29  86 Fed. Reg. 68,052.  Therefore, the Rule is “not amenable to \nseverance.”  Chamber of Com. of U.S., 885 F.3d 360 at 388.  Ultimately, then, the Rule in its \nentirety must be set aside. \n In an attempt to avoid this conclusion, the defendants cite a severability clause \nwithin the Rule, which states that, “[t]o the extent a court may enjoin any part of the rule, \nthe Department intends that other provisions or parts of provisions should remain in effect.”  \n86 Fed. Reg. at 68,059–60.  Nevertheless, “the ultimate determination of severability will \nrarely turn on the presence or absence of a severability clause.”  Nasdaq Stock Mkt. LLC v. \nSEC, 38 F.4th 1126, 1145 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Instead, \ncourts must look to whether any remaining valid portions can still function absent the \n \n29 The masking requirement constituted a major portion of the Rule, as well.  See 86 Fed. Reg. at \n68,058.  However, as explained above, the Secretary has since removed that requirement in its \nFinal Rule.  See supra Section 1.  The Court does not explicitly address the masking requirement \nbut notes that, in any event, it would have violated the APA, too, for reasons discussed in Sections \n4, 5, and 6. \n– 67 – \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00300-H   Document 69   Filed 03/31/23    Page 68 of 69   PageID 25394\ninvalid portions.  Id.  Here, because the Rule in its entirety violates the APA and is not \namenable to severance, the Court sets aside the Rule in whole.30 \n8.  Conclusion \nApproximately three years have passed since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in \nthe United States.  See 85 Fed. Reg. 15337 (Mar. 18, 2020).  Schools both in Texas and \nacross the country have returned to in-person classes and dropped vaccine and masking \nrequirements.31  Numerous vaccine mandates have since been repealed or removed.32  And \nPresident Biden has announced that the U.S. will be ending the COVID-19 national \nemergency and public health emergency declarations in May 2023.33  HHS has since \nremoved the Rule’s masking requirement and even implemented a local-level, COVID-19 \nmitigation strategy in its Final Rule, returning once again to community-wide flexibility.  88 \nFed. Reg. 993.  Yet, the Rule’s vaccine mandate for Head Start staff, contractors, and \nvolunteers remains in force.  Id.  And although HHS stated that the vaccine mandate was \n \n30 The Court notes that the plaintiffs are not challenging the Final Rule.  See Dkt. No. 54-1.  In any \nevent, the Final Rule clearly states that it “does not address the vaccination and testing \nrequirement, which is still under review.”  88 Fed. Reg. at 993. \n \n31 See Ariel Gilreath, For Head Start, Masks and Vaccine Mandates are Still in Place—For Now (Sept. 7, \n2022), https://hechingerreport.org/for-head-start-masks-and-vaccine-mandates-are-still-in-place-\nfor-now/ [https://perma.cc/A5C4-KZDC]; Dana Goldstein, At Head Start, Masks Remain On, \nDespite C.D.C.

Id.  \nThus, while other mandates and organizations adjust and move forward, Head Start’s \nvaccine mandate and this dispute remain. \nBecause LISD and Texas have standing, the Secretary did not have statutory \nauthority to promulgate the Rule, the Rule violates procedural requirements, and the Rule is \narbitrary and capricious, the Court grants the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment (Dkt. \nNo. 54).  The defendants’ motion to dismiss (Dkt. No. 48) and motion for summary \njudgment (Dkt. No. 49) are denied.  The Court sets aside and vacates the Interim Final \nRule.  The Court either does not reach or denies all other requested relief.  The Court will \nenter a final judgment, including a seven-day administrative stay, by separate order. \nSo ordered on March 31, 2023. \n \n            ____________________________________ \n            JAMES WESLEY HENDRIX \n            UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n– 69 – ",
