    "summary": "<p>This case concerned a Texas state agency's effort to delist the golden-cheeked warbler from the federal list of endangered species.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 12, 2022, the General Land Office of the State of Texas filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas (Waco Division) against the United States Department of the Interior (DOI) and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (Wildlife Service). The General Land Office used revenues generated from selling public school lands and leasing the mineral rights, and it put that revenue towards the Permanent School Fund. The General Land Office alleged that it was losing education funding revenue due to the Wildlife Service&rsquo;s continued denial of a petition to delist the golden-cheeked warbler from the Endangered Species List, which imposed restrictions on General Land Office&rsquo;s use of the property and lowered the property&rsquo;s market value.</p>\r\n<p>This lawsuit was a follow-up to a lawsuit over the same issue in 2017, in which the Wildlife Service denied the so-called &ldquo;delisting petition&rdquo; filed by Texans for Positive Economic Policy, Susan Combs, the Texas Public Policy Foundation, and the Reason Foundation, who sought to de-list the golden-cheeked warbler from the Endangered Species List. Ultimately, in that 2017 litigation, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the Wildlife Service&rsquo;s denial of the citizen petition violated the Endangered Species Act and was arbitrary and capricious because it applied an inappropriately stringent standard that was not authorized by the Endangered Species Act or the then-applicable regulations. The Fifth Circuit remanded the matter back to the Wildlife Service to reconsider the petition. Gen. Land Office of Tex. v. United States DOI, 947 F.3d 309 (5th Cir. 2020).</p>\r\n<p>On remand, the Wildlife Service again denied the de-listing petition for the removal of the golden-cheeked warbler from the List. This lawsuit followed that second denial.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In this lawsuit, the General Land Office challenged the second denial of the delisting petition as a violation of the Endangered Species Act and as arbitrary and capricious decision-making under the Administrative Procedures Act. First, they alleged that the Wildlife Service defied the Fifth Circuit&rsquo;s prior order by requiring an erroneously high standard for de-listing. The General Land Office alleged that the Wildlife Service applied the same incorrect standard in the second petition denial as it did in the first petition, notwithstanding the Fifth Circuit&rsquo;s rejection of that standard, and that the purported requirement that the petition offer proof of recovery of the warbler, at the 90-day petition stage, exceeded the requirements set forth in the Endangered Species Act. The General Land Office further alleged that the Wildlife Service erroneously based its denial of the petition on species recovery plans that did not have the force of law, rather than on the Act. Next, the General Land Office asserted that the Wildlife Service failed to address key information in the petition that was favorable for the removal of the warbler&rsquo;s endangered status, including the bird&rsquo;s habitat and population. Finally, the General Land Office alleged that the original listing of the warbler on the Endangered Species List was based on erroneous scientific information and that the Wildlife Service had not considered that in its denial of the delisting petition. The complaint requested injunctive and declaratory relief and litigation costs. This case was assigned to Judge Alan D. Albright.</p>\r\n<p>The Department of the Interior and the Wildlife Service filed a motion to change venue to the Austin Division of the Western District of Texas on March 15, 2022. This venue change was granted on December 20, 2022, resulting in a new docket number and reassignment to Judge Lee Yeakel.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thereafter, the General Land Office filed a motion for summary judgment on December 19, 2023, to which the Department of the Interior and the Wildlife Service responded on February 19, 2024. As of April 2024, the motion remains pending and this case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  defendants  named  above  (collectively,  the  “Federal  Defendants”  or  the \n“Service”) have disobeyed the vacatur and remand orders of the Fifth Circuit and this court by \ncontinuing to violate the Endangered Species Act (the “ESA”) and its implementing regulations.  \nOnce again, the Federal Defendants have used an impermissibly stringent standard to deny the 90-\nday Petition to remove the Golden-Cheeked Warbler (the “Warbler”) from the ESA list of \nendangered species.  Accordingly, Plaintiff General Land Office of the State of Texas (‘TXGLO”) \nfiles this Complaint seeking declaratory judgment and injunctive relief.  \nII.  PARTIES \n2.  Plaintiff TXGLO is the oldest state agency in Texas and, among other things, is \ncharged with maximizing revenues from Texas public lands dedicated to the Permanent School \nFund.  TXGLO derives those revenues by selling public school lands and leasing their mineral \nrights, which flow to the Permanent School Fund under the Texas Constitution.  See Tex. Const.  \nArt. VII § 5(g).  TXGLO also owns and maintains state veterans’ homes that provide care and \ndignity for veterans, their spouses, and Gold Star parents, as well as state veterans’ cemeteries to \nhonor those who have served.  TXGLO owns or maintains public school lands which contain \nWarbler habitat.  The federal government undermines TXGLO’s ability to maximize revenues by \nimposing restrictions due to Warbler population or habitat on TXGLO property, lowering the \nproperty’s market value and subjecting TXGLO to onerous, costly, and time-consuming ESA \nreview.  Delisting the Warbler will therefore provide immediate relief for TXGLO. \n3.  Defendant United States Department of the Interior (“Interior”) is a department-\nlevel agency of the United States.  Congress has charged Interior with administering the ESA for \nterrestrial species. \n1 \n\nCase 6:22-cv-00044   Document 1   Filed 01/12/22   Page 3 of 25\n4.  Defendant United States Fish and Wildlife Service (the “FWS” or the “Service”) is \na bureau of Interior.  The FWS has responsibility for the day-to-day administration of the ESA, \nincluding listing and delisting terrestrial species and designating their critical habitat. \n5.  Defendant Deb Haaland is the Secretary of the Interior.  She oversees Interior’s \nadministration of the ESA. \n6.  Defendant Martha Williams is the Acting Director of the FWS.  She oversees the \nService’s administration of the ESA. \n7.  Defendant Amy Lueders is the Southwest Regional Director of the FWS.  She \noversees the Service’s administration of the ESA in a region that includes the State of Texas. \nIII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.  Plaintiff brings this action under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 \nU.S.C. §§ 701-706, and the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), 16 U.S.C. §§ 1540(g)(1)(A). \n9.  This court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706 (APA); \n28 U.S.C. § 2201 (Declaratory Judgment Act); and 16 U.S.C. §§ 1540(g)(1)(A) and (C) and \n(g)(2)(A) and (B) (ESA citizen suit provisions). \n10.  Pursuant to the citizen suit provisions of ESA, Plaintiff sent a 60-day notice of \nintent (“NOI”) to sue the Federal Defendants over their respective failures to comply with the ESA \nand the orders of the Fifth Circuit and this Court.  The NOI was sent to the Federal Defendants on \nOctober 11, 2021, and was received by the last of them on October 12, 2021.  A copy of the NOI \nis included in Exhibit A.  A copy of the receipts showing delivery of the NOI is included in Exhibit \nB.  Accordingly, Plaintiff has complied with the 60-day notice requirements of the ESA. \n2 \n\nCase 6:22-cv-00044   Document 1   Filed 01/12/22   Page 4 of 25\n11.  The relief requested is authorized by 28 U.S.C. § 2201 (declaratory judgment), 28 \nU.S.C. § 2202 (injunctive relief), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706 (APA), and 16 U.S.C. § 1540(g) (ESA \ncitizen suit provision). \n12.  This Court also has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, which grants the \ndistrict courts “original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the . . . laws . . . of the United \nStates,” and 16 U.S.C. § 1533(b)(3)(C)(ii) (authorizing judicial review of negative 90-day findings \nmade under the ESA). \n13.  Venue is appropriate in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because a \nsubstantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this district, a \nsubstantial part of the property that is the subject of the action is situated in this district, or the \nplaintiff resides in this district.  In addition, venue is appropriate under 16 U.S.C. § 1540(g)(3)(A) \nbecause the violation occurred in this district. Venue is appropriate also under 5 U.S.C. § 703.   \n14.  An actual, justiciable controversy exists between the parties within the meaning of \n28 U.S.C. § 2201. \n15.  The federal Government has waived sovereign immunity in this action pursuant to \n5 U.S.C. § 702 and 16 U.S.C. § 1540. \n16.  Plaintiff  TXGLO  has  exhausted  all  administrative  remedies,  the  Federal \nDefendants’ action is final and ripe for review, and Plaintiff has standing because it is injured in \nfact because of the Federal Defendants’ denial of the 90-day Petition, which continues the burdens \nof the ESA on Plaintiff’s properties located in Texas, and this court has the power to redress that \ninjury by vacating the denial of the 90-day Petition and providing the requested declaratory and \ninjunctive relief. \n   \n3 \n\nCase 6:22-cv-00044   Document 1   Filed 01/12/22   Page 5 of 25\nIV.  LEGAL BACKGROUND \nA.  Endangered Species Act and Implementing Regulations \n17.  Congress passed the ESA to protect species vulnerable to extinction and conserve \nthe ecosystems upon which endangered and threatened species depend.  See 16 U.S.C. § 1531(b).  \nBefore a species receives full protection under the ESA, it must be listed as “threatened” or \n“endangered.”  A “threatened” species is “any species which is likely to become an endangered \nspecies within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range.”  16 U.S.C. \n§ 1532(20).  An “endangered” species is “in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant \nportion of its range.”  16 U.S.C. § 1532(6).  The government determines whether to list a species \nbased on certain factors using the “best scientific and commercial data available.”  16 U.S.C. § \n1533(b)(1)(A). \n18.  Under regulations in effect on the date the 90-day Petition was filed by the Plaintiff, \na species was to be listed if it was endangered or threatened based on any one or a combination of \nthese factors: \na.  The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its \nhabitat or range; \nb.  Overutilization  for  commercial,  recreational,  scientific,  or  educational \npurposes; \nc.  Disease or predation; \nd.  The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or \ne.  Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continuing existence.  50 \nC.F.R. § 424.11(c)(1)–(5) (2014). \n4 \n\nCase 6:22-cv-00044   Document 1   Filed 01/12/22   Page 6 of 25\n19.  Once a species is listed as “threatened” or “endangered,” the ESA protects it by \nmaking it unlawful for any person to “take” such species.  16 U.S.C. § 1538(a)(1)(B).  To “take” \nmeans to “harass, harm, hunt, pursue, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to \nengage in any such conduct.”  16 U.S.C. § 1532(19).   \n20.  Federal agencies must consult with the Secretary of the Interior if they believe their \nprojects on any property may affect endangered or threatened species.  Every five years the \nSecretary of the Interior must review each listed species to determine whether a change in the \nspecies’ listing status is warranted.  16 U.S.C. § 1533(c)(2)(A).  This includes a determination as \nto whether a species should be delisted or changed in status from endangered to threatened, or vice \nversa.  16 U.S.C. § 1533(c)(2)(B).  Under rules in effect as of the time relevant to this complaint, \nspecies may be delisted if, after review of the species, the best scientific and commercial data \nsubstantiates that the species is neither threatened nor endangered due to extinction, recovery, or \nthe original scientific or commercial data used at the time the species was classified (or the \ninterpretation of such data) were in error.  50 C.F.R. § 424.11(d)(3) (2014); see General Land \nOffice of Tex. v. United States DOI, 947 F. 3d 309, 320-21 (Fifth Cir. 2020) (holding that the \nService must apply the regulations in effect at the time the 90-day Petition was filed with the \nagency); see also 81 Fed. Reg. 7414, et seq. (February 11, 2016) (amending 50 CFR Part 424, \neffective as of March 14, 2016).  For the convenience of the Court, the codification of the \napplicable regulations in effect as of the date on which the 90-day Petition was filed is included as \nExhibit C of this complaint. \n21.  The factors considered for delisting are the same as those considered when listing \na species.  Id.   \n5 \n\nCase 6:22-cv-00044   Document 1   Filed 01/12/22   Page 7 of 25\n22.  The  government  has  a  duty  to  specify  critical  habitat  for  any  threatened  or \nendangered  species  “to  the  maximum  extent  prudent  and  determinable.”    16  U.S.C.  § \n1533(a)(3)(A)(i).  Critical habitat means “the specific areas within the geographical area occupied \nby the species . . . on which are found those physical or biological features essential to the \nconservation  of  the  species  and  which  may  require  special  management  considerations  or \nprotection,” as well as specific areas outside an endangered species’ range “upon a determination \nby the Secretary [of Commerce] that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.”  \n16 U.S.C. § 1532(5)(A)–(B) (cleaned up). \n23.  An interested person may petition the federal government to add a species to or \nremove a species from the endangered or threatened species lists (a “90-day petition”).  See 16 U.S \n§ 1533(b)(3)(A).  Within 90 days after receiving such a petition, “the Secretary shall make a \nfinding as to whether the petition presents substantial scientific or commercial information \nindicating that the petitioned action may be warranted.”  Id.  When doing so, the Secretary must \nconsider any information within the petition or attached to it that comports with certain regulatory \nrequirements in effect at the time a 90-day Petition is filed.  See 50 C.F.R. § 424.11(b) – (f) (2014).  \nIf the Secretary finds the petitioned action may be warranted, the Secretary must review the \nspecies’ endangered or threatened status.  Id.  Any negative finding on a petition is subject to \njudicial review.  16 U.S.C. § 1533(b)(3)(C)(ii). \n24.  The ESA citizen suit provision permits any person to sue on his own behalf under \nseveral circumstances, including filing a suit “against the Secretary where there is alleged failure \nof the Secretary to perform any act or duty under section 1533 of this title which is not discretionary \nwith the Secretary.”  16 U.S.C. § 1540(g)(1)(C).  This provision negates the “zone of interests” \ntest for prudential standing.  See Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 164 (1997).  The Secretary has \n6 \n\nCase 6:22-cv-00044   Document 1   Filed 01/12/22   Page 8 of 25\nno discretion to ignore or otherwise refuse to comply with federal court orders issued in connection \nwith a 90-day petition filed pursuant to 16 U.S.C. § 1533(b)(3)(A). \nB.  Administrative Procedure Act and Implementing Regulations \n25.  The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) provides a right to judicial review for \nany “person suffering legal wrong because of agency action.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  The reviewing \ncourt must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that it finds “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse \nof discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; contrary to constitutional right, power, \nprivilege, or immunity; in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \nstatutory right; [or] without observance of procedure required by law . . . .”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)–\n(D) (cleaned up). \nV.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n \nThe Golden-Cheeked Warbler: A Texas-Nesting Species \n \n26.  The Warbler is an insectivorous migratory songbird that breeds in the mixed Ashe \njuniper and deciduous woodlands of Central Texas. \n27.  The Warbler arrives in Texas from late February through April, migrating afterward \nthrough Central America in July and August. \n28.  The Warbler is the only bird species that nests entirely in the state of Texas. \nThe Federal Government Lists The Warbler As Endangered \n \n29.  The Warbler was first mentioned by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in \na Notice of Review published on December 30, 1982, as a species under consideration for addition \nto the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife.  47 Fed. Reg. 251, 58459.  At that time, the \nWarbler was categorized as a species for which the Service had information indicating that a \nproposal to list the species was “possibly appropriate, but for which substantial data are not \n7 \n\nCase 6:22-cv-00044   Document 1   Filed 01/12/22   Page 9 of 25\ncurrently available to biologically support a proposed rule.  Further biological research and field \nstudy will usually be necessary to ascertain the status of the taxa in this category, and it is likely \nthat some of the taxa will not warrant listing.”  Id. at 58454.  The Warbler remained in that category \nfor both the September 18, 1985 Review of Vertebrate Wildlife [50 Fed. Reg. 37958] and the \nJanuary 6, 1989, Animal Notice of Review [54 Fed. Reg. 554]. \n30.  On February 2, 1990, a petition was filed seeking an emergency listing for the \nWarbler, allegedly because the normal listing procedure could be “inadequate to protect the bird \nand its habitat from imminent destruction from clearing and development.”  55 Fed. Reg. 18846, \n18847. \n31.  The Service emergency-listed the Warbler on May 4, 1990, finding that “ongoing \nand imminent habitat destruction” warranted the action.  Id. at 18844. \n32.  The Service indicated in this ruling that Central Texas contained some of the best \nWarbler habitat, and that increased development in the region placed this habitat under threat.  Id. \n33.  The Service published a Final Rule listing the species on December 27, 1990.  55 \nFed. Reg. 53153. \n34.  The Final Rule estimated there to be approximately 15,000 - 17,000 Warblers and \nbetween 79,400 - 263,750 acres of available suitable habitat.  Id. at 53154. \n35.  In the Final Rule, the Service stated that the Warbler should be listed based on: \na.  the present or threatened destruction of Warbler habitat; \nb.  the possibility of nest predation by Central Texas species; \nc.  the lack of regulatory protection for Warbler habitat; and \nd.  the lack of reproduction of deciduous trees in Warbler habitat. \nId. at 53157–59. \n8 \n\nCase 6:22-cv-00044   Document 1   Filed 01/12/22   Page 10 of 25\nThe 90-day Delisting Petition \n36.  On June 29, 2015, Texans for Positive Economic Policy, Susan Combs, the Texas \nPublic Policy Foundation, and the Reason Foundation (“Petitioners”) submitted a petition to \nremove the Warbler from the endangered species list (the “90-day Petition” or the “Petition”).  The \nPetition is attached to this complaint as Exhibit D. \n37.  Among other things the Petition provided the following information to support its \ncontention that delisting the Warbler may be warranted: \na.  Warbler habitat is far larger than was known at the time the Warbler was \nlisted, see Exhibit D at 13, 18; \nb.  the Warbler population is about 19 times greater than was believed when \nthe Warbler was listed, see id. at 19; \nc.  habitat fragmentation and urbanization are not a threat to the Warbler due \nto the size and scope of its habitat and population, see id. at 28; and \nd.  many existing conservation plans and mechanisms exist for the Warbler \nsuch that the probability of its extinction over the next 100 years is low, see \nid. at 20, 23–25. \n38.  The Petition stated that application of the best available scientific and commercial \ninformation indicates that, because the Warbler does not meet the ESA’s statutory factors for \nlisting, it is “ineligible for continued listing as an endangered species.”  Id. at 14. \nThe First 90-Day Finding \n39.  On June 3, 2016, the Service made a negative 90-day finding denying the Petition \n(the “First 90-day Finding”), claiming that there continues to be “ongoing, widespread destruction \nof [Warbler] habitat” and that the Warbler is still in danger of extinction.  81 Fed. Reg. 35698, \n9 \n\nCase 6:22-cv-00044   Document 1   Filed 01/12/22   Page 11 of 25\n35700 (June 3, 2016).  For the convenience of the Court, the Service’s 2016 petition review form \nsetting forth the details of the First 90-day Finding is attached as Exhibit E. \n40.  While acknowledging that new data published since the Warbler’s listing indicate \ngrowth in the Warbler’s population and the existence of more habitat, the Service claimed this data \nrepresented “estimates rather than indicators of positive trends” and therefore, according to the \nService, do not imply recovery of the species.  81 Fed Reg. at 35700.  Although the Service noted \nthat a study published after the Service received the 90-day Petition supported the contention that \nthe exact Warbler population was uncertain, the Service falsely faulted the Petition for failing to \naddress habitat fragmentation, disease and predation.  Id. \n41.  The Service ignored or discounted without adequate explanation the Petition’s data \nshowing (a) remarkable increases in Warbler population and habitat and (b) substantial evidence \nthat neither disease nor predation significantly threaten the Warbler. Instead the Service, stated \nthat the Petition provided no “new information” indicating the Warbler should be removed from \nthe endangered species list or that the original listing was in error.  Id. at 35700.   \nThe Original Lawsuit \n42.  Plaintiff TXGLO filed suit in the Western District of Texas against the Service and \nother defendants on June 5, 2017, challenging the First 90-day Finding as in violation of the ESA \nand its implementing regulations and arbitrary and capricious.  The district court upheld the First \n90-day Finding.  See Gen. Land Office of Tex. v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serv., 2019 WL 1010688 \n(W.D. Tex. Feb. 6, 2019).  For the convenience of this Court, the 2019 district court order is set \nforth as Exhibit F. \n43.  TXGLO appealed, and the Fifth Circuit reversed the district court’s ruling, holding \nthat the First 90-day Finding violated the ESA and was arbitrary and capricious.  See Gen. Land \nOffice of Tex. v. United States Dept. of the Interior, 947 F.3d 309, 320–21 (5th Cir. 2020). \n10 \n\nCase 6:22-cv-00044   Document 1   Filed 01/12/22   Page 12 of 25\n44.  Among  other  things,  the  Fifth  Circuit  ruled  that  the  Service  applied  an \ninappropriately stringent standard of review by impermissibly requiring the Petition to present \n“new” information the Service had not considered in its five-year review.  Id. at 321. \n45.  The Fifth Circuit held that applicable regulations in effect at the time of the filing \nof the Petition required only that a petition present “that amount of information that would lead a \nreasonable person to believe that the measure proposed in the petition may be warranted.”  Id. at \n320–21. \n46.  The Fifth Circuit went on to hold that, in denying the 90-day Petition, “[t]he Service \nrecited [the correct] standard, but a careful examination of its analysis shows that the Service \napplied an inappropriately heightened one.”  Id. at 321 (emphasis in the original).  \n47.  The Fifth Circuit held that the Service’s denial of the 90-day Petition violated the \nESA and was arbitrary and capricious because it applied an inappropriately stringent standard that \nwas not authorized by the ESA or the then-applicable regulations. Id. \n48.  Accordingly, the Fifth Circuit vacated the First 90-day Finding and remanded to \nthe Service for reconsideration of the Petition, ordering the Service to use the correct legal \nstandard, as specified by the Court. Id. \n49.  On January 26, 2021, the district court awarded Plaintiff TXGLO attorney fees and \nissued its final judgment closing the case.  See Gen. Land Office of Tex. v. United States Dept. of \nthe Interior, Case No. 1:17-CV-00538-LY, Doc. No. 96.  For the convenience of this Court, the \nfinal judgment of the district court is attached to this complaint as Exhibit G. \nThe Service Defies The Fifth Circuit’s Order In Its Second 90-day Finding \n50.  On July 27, 2021, the Service published a new 90-day finding on the Petition (“the \nSecond 90-Day Finding”).  Once again, the Service found that the 90-day Petition did not present \n11 \n\nCase 6:22-cv-00044   Document 1   Filed 01/12/22   Page 13 of 25\nsubstantial scientific or commercial data indicating that delisting the Warbler may be warranted.  \n86 Fed. Reg. 40186. \n51.  The Service provided its reasoning for the Second 90-day Finding in a new petition \nreview form dated July 7, 2021.  For the convenience of this Court, the 2021 petition review form \nof the Second 90-day Finding is attached to the complaint as Exhibit H. \n52.  In the Second 90-day Finding, the Service disobeyed the Fifth Circuit’s order and \nonce again applied an impermissibly heightened standard of review to the Petition.  As in the First \n90-day Finding, in the Second 90-day Finding the Service recited the correct standard, but then \napplied an incorrect standard by stating that the Petition “does not report any new data or study \nresults . . . but summarizes readily available information about the [Warbler] and its habitat.”  See \nExhibit  H  at  Factor  A(1)(a)  (unpaginated)  (emphasis  added).    Thus,  the  Service  again \nimpermissibly required Petitioners to present new information the Service had not previously \nconsidered.  This is precisely the standard that the Fifth Circuit told the Service not to apply when \nanalyzing the 90-day Petition.  See Gen. Land Office, 947 F.3d at 321 (“[T]he Service required the \ndelisting petition to contain information the Service had not considered in its five-year review . . . \nThe Service thus based its decision to deny the delisting petition on an incorrect legal standard.”). \n53.  In addition, as shown throughout the Second 90-day Finding’s petition review form \nset forth in Exhibit H, the Service ignored or misconstrued substantial scientific information \npresented in the Petition.  It did so despite the Service’s usual practice of “accept[ing] the \npetitioner’s sources and characterizations of the information unless we [the Service] have specific \ninformation to the contrary.”  Colo. River Cutthroat Trout v. Kempthorne, 448 F. Supp. 2d 170, \n176 n.4 (D.D.C. Sept. 7, 2006). \n12 \n\nCase 6:22-cv-00044   Document 1   Filed 01/12/22   Page 14 of 25\n54.  The Service also failed to consider whether the original habitat and population data \nfor the Warbler were in error—a fundamental question the 90-Day Petition posed—and instead \nchoose to ignore this question in an oversight that defies reason.  See Exhibit D at 13, 14; see also \n50 C.F.R. § 424.11(d)(3) (2014). \n55.  The Service required the Petition to present conclusive evidence that the Warbler \nhas recovered, again applying an incorrect standard of review that led to the vacatur and remand \nof the First 90-day Finding.  Specifically, the Service’s petition review form states that the Petition \nonly provides “new estimates rather than indicators of positive trends in [Warbler] habitat and \npopulation size, and thus do not imply recovery.”  Exhibit H at Factor A(1)(a) (unpaginated) This \nCourt recently held such an approach unlawful, stating that “[t]he Service violated its regulations \nwhen it required . . . conclusive evidence [of] population trends . . . and the Service committed a \nclear error in judgment and acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and not in accordance with the law when \nit called for more evidence than the law requires.”  Am. Stewards of Liberty v. U.S. Dep’t of the \nInterior, 370 F. Supp. 3d 711, 725 (W.D. Tex. 2019) (emphasis added).  As in American Stewards, \nhere the Service again applied a higher standard of review than the law permits. \n56.  The Service acknowledged in its review form that the habitat range and population \nof the Warbler were both larger than what had been known when the Warbler was listed.  See \nExhibit H, at Petition Finding (“We acknowledge that the known potential range is more extensive \nthan when the [Warbler] was originally listed in 1990.”) (unpaginated).  Bewilderingly, however, \nthe Service ignored or discounted this information without adequate explanation. So again, in \nviolation of the specific instructions of the Fifth Circuit, the Service denied the fact that the best \nscientific data shows the Warbler may be a candidate for delisting.   \n13 \n\nCase 6:22-cv-00044   Document 1   Filed 01/12/22   Page 15 of 25\n57.  The Warbler’s population numbers in the hundreds of thousands, and the Warbler \nhas millions of acres of available habitat.  The Petition made this clear.  The Petition also showed \nthat, based on the best scientific data, neither habitat fragmentation nor disease or predation \nprovide a threat to the Warbler.  See Exhibit D at, e.g., 17, 22, 25, 27, 28.  The Service turned a \nblind eye to this information and instead falsely claimed the Petition did not address habitat \nfragmentation, disease, or predation of the Warbler. \n58.  The Service also failed to account for Dr. James Mueller’s presentation to the Texas \nChapter of the Wildlife Society on February 25, 2021 entitled Where and by How Much do Golden-\nCheeked Warbler Models Differ?  This presentation described Mueller’s study using presence-\nabsence surveys to conclude there were between 220,000 and 276,000 singing male Warblers \nthroughout the Warbler breeding range and that the species did not appear to be imminently \nthreatened with extinction.  While this study has not been published yet, the information referenced \nwould have been in the Service’s files when they issued the Second 90-day Finding. \n59.  Finally, the Service required proof of Warbler recovery as a condition precedent \nfor a positive 90-day finding.  But success at the 90-day finding stage only requires a petition to \npresent substantial information that delisting may be warranted and not that delisting is warranted.   \nThe Current Lawsuit \n60.  On October 11, 2021, pursuant to the citizen suit provision of the ESA, 16 U.S.C. \n§ 1540(g)(2), Plaintiff TXGLO provided a 60-day notice of intent to file suit against the Service \nto the Federal Defendants.  As indicated above, the 60-day notice letter is attached as Exhibit A \nand is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety in this Complaint. \n   \n14 \n\nCase 6:22-cv-00044   Document 1   Filed 01/12/22   Page 16 of 25\nVI.  PLAINTIFF’S CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \nFirst Claim For Relief \nIN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT’S REMAND ORDER, THE \nSERVICE IMPERMISSIBLY REQUIRED THE 90-DAY PETITION TO CONTAIN  \nNEW INFORMATION THAT THE SERVICE HAD NOT  \nCONSIDERED DURING IT’S PREVIOUS FIVE YEAR REVIEW \n \n(Violation of 16 U.S.C. § 1533(b)(3)(A); 50 C.F.R. § 424.14(b)(1) (2014); 50 C.F. R. § \n424.11(c)-(d) (2014); 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)) \n61.  Plaintiff  realleges  and  incorporates  by  reference  the  allegations  contained  in \nParagraphs 1 through 60 as though fully set forth herein. \n62.  Upon receipt of a delisting petition, federal law requires the Service, acting under \ndelegation from the Secretary of the Interior, to “make a finding as to whether the petition presents \nsubstantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be \nwarranted.”  16 U.S.C. § 1533(b)(3)(A) (emphasis added). \n63.  According to the ESA’s implementing regulations in effect at the time the Petition \nwas submitted, “substantial information” means “that amount of information that would lead a \nreasonable person to believe that [delisting] may be warranted.”  50 C.F.R. § 424.14(b)(1) (2014) \n(emphasis added). Nothing in those regulations required the 90-day Petition at issue here to contain \nnew information not previously considered by the Service. \n64.  After the 90-day Petition was submitted in 2015, the implementing regulations were \nrevised in 2016, providing that where a prior species status review resulted in final agency action, \na petitioned action “generally would not be considered to present substantial scientific and \ncommercial information indicating the petitioned action may be warranted unless the petition \nprovides new information not previously considered.”  50 C.F.R. 424.14(h)(iii) (2016) (emphasis \nadded). \n15 \n\nCase 6:22-cv-00044   Document 1   Filed 01/12/22   Page 17 of 25\n65.  In its First 90-day Finding, the Service impermissibly applied the 2016 revision of \nthe ESA’s implementing regulations to the 90-day Petition. \n66.  The Fifth Circuit found in the Original Lawsuit that “[t]he Service recited [the \ncorrect]  standard,  but  a  careful  review  of  its  analysis  shows  that  the  Service  applied  an \ninappropriately heightened one.”  See Gen. Land Office, 947 F.3d at 321.  Among other things, the \nCourt found that “the Service required the [Petition] to contain information the Service had not \nconsidered in its five-year review,” which was “an incorrect legal standard.”  Id.  Accordingly, the \nFifth Circuit found the Service’s First 90-day Finding unlawful, arbitrary and capricious, vacated \nthe 90-day Finding, and remanded to the Service, requiring it to apply the correct standard of \nreview. Id. \n67.  The Service defied the Fifth Circuit’s explicit instructions and impermissibly \napplied in its Second 90-day Finding the same incorrect standard it had applied in the vacated and \nremanded First 90-day Finding, requiring the Petitioners to offer “new data or study results,” while \nimproperly criticizing the 90-day Petition because it “summarizes readily available information \nabout the warbler and its habitat.”  Exhibit H at Factor A(1)(a). \n68.  The Service’s inexplicable and willful refusal to apply the correct standard of \nreview at the 90-day stage notwithstanding the order of the Fifth Circuit violated the ESA and its \nimplementing regulations applicable at the time the 90-day Petition was filed and was “arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; [or] without observance of \nprocedure required by law . . . .”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)–(D) (cleaned up). \n   \n16 \n\nCase 6:22-cv-00044   Document 1   Filed 01/12/22   Page 18 of 25\nSecond Claim For Relief \nTHE SERVICE IMPERMISSIBLY REQUIRED PETITIONERS TO SHOW  \nPROOF OF RECOVERY AT THE 90-DAY STAGE \n \n(Violation of 16 U.S.C. § 1533(b)(3)(A); 50 C.F.R. § 424.14(b)(1) (2014); 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)) \n69.  Plaintiff  realleges  and  incorporates  by  reference  the  allegations  contained  in \nParagraphs 1 through 68 as though fully set forth herein. \n70.  The Service stated in its Second 90-day Finding that the Petition’s information \npresented in favor of delisting constituted “estimates rather than indicators of positive trends in \nwarbler habitat and population size, and thus do not imply recovery.”  Exhibit H at Factor A(1)(a). \n(emphasis added) (unpaginated).  Moreover, the Service stated that “recovery criteria have not \nbeen accomplished.”  Id. (emphasis added). \n71.  The Service’s requirement that the Petitioners provide conclusive evidence at the \n90-day stage that the Warbler had recovered goes well beyond the requirements of the ESA and \nits then-applicable regulations, which simply require substantial evidence that delisting may be \nwarranted under a reasonable person standard. Accordingly, the Service’s insistence on conclusive \nproof of recovery at the 90-day stage violates the ESA and is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, \nor limitations, or short of statutory right; [or] without observance of procedure required by law . . \n. .”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) - (D). \nThird Claim For Relief \nTHE SERVICE IMPERMISSIBLY USED ITS SPECIES RECOVERY PLAN AS  \nTHE DETERMINATIVE FACTOR IN DENYING THE 90-DAY PETITION \n \n(Violation of 16 U.S.C. § 1533(b)(3)(A); 50 C.F.R. 424(b)(1) (2014); 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)) \n17 \n\nCase 6:22-cv-00044   Document 1   Filed 01/12/22   Page 19 of 25\n72.  Plaintiff  realleges  and  incorporates  by  reference  the  allegations  contained  in \nParagraphs 1 through 71 as though fully set forth herein. \n73.  At the 90-day stage, when determining whether a petition presents substantial \ninformation that may lead to delisting, the Service is bound by the ESA’s explicit criteria \nsupplemented by the criteria in its applicable implementing regulations in effect at the time a 90-\nday petition is submitted.  See 16 U.S.C. § 1533(b)(3)(A); 50 C.F.R. § 424.14(b) (2014). \n74.  Neither the ESA nor its applicable regulations authorized the Service to base its \ndecision solely or substantially on its species recovery plans when evaluating a delisting petition \nat the 90-day stage.  Courts have held that species recovery plans do not contain binding criteria \nand do not have the force of law.  Rather, it is the ESA’s statutory and regulatory criteria that bind \nthe Service’s decision-making at the 90-day stage and not the species recovery plan.   See, e.g., \nFriends of Blackwater v. Salazar, 691 F.3d 428, 434 (D.C. Cir. 2012); Fund for Animals, Inc. v. \nRice, 85 F.3d 535, 547 (11th Cir. 1996); Conservation Cong. v. Finley, 774 F.3d 611, 614 (9th Cir. \n2014) (citing Friends of Blackwater). \n75.  The Service impermissibly used its species recovery plan as the determinative \nfactor in issuing its negative 90-day Finding on the Warbler, going beyond the standard permitted \nby  law.    See  Exhibit H  at  Factor  A.1.a  (unpaginated)  (“[R]ecovery  criteria  have  not  been \naccomplished”) (citing the Service’s species recovery plan).  In doing so, the Service ignored or \nimpermissibly  discounted  substantial  scientific  and  commercial  information  in  the  Petition \nindicating the Warbler had met or exceeded the legal standard under the ESA’s then-applicable \nimplementing regulations to support a finding that delisting may be warranted.  See Exhibit D at \n12-29. \n18 \n\nCase 6:22-cv-00044   Document 1   Filed 01/12/22   Page 20 of 25\n76.  The Service’s ultra vires use of the species recovery plan as the determinative factor \nin denying the 90-day Petition, while disregarding or impermissibly discounting the Petition’s \nsubstantial evidence that delisting of the Warbler may be warranted, was a violation of the ESA \nand its then-applicable implementing regulations and was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, \nor limitations, or short of statutory right; [or] without observance of procedure required by law . . \n. .”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (D). \nFourth Claim For Relief \nTHE SERVICE IMPERMISSIBLY FAILED TO PROPERLY CONSIDER \nINFORMATION IN THE 90-DAY PETITION REGARDING HABITAT \nFRAGMENTATION, URBANIZATION, DISEASE AND PREDATION  \n \n(Violation of 16 U.S.C. § 1533(b)(3)(A); 50 C.F.R. 424.14(b)(1) (2014); 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)) \n77.  Plaintiff  realleges  and  incorporates  by  reference  the  allegations  contained  in \nParagraphs 1 through 76 as though fully set forth herein. \n78.  When determining whether a 90-day Petition presents substantial information that \nmay lead to delisting, the Service considers the factors listed in the ESA and its implementing \nregulations.  See 16 U.S.C. § 1533(b)(3)(A), 50 C.F.R. § 424.14(b) (2014), 50 C.F.R. § 424.11(c)-\n(f) (2014). \n79.  The Service falsely states in its Second 90-day Finding that the Petition failed to \nadequately address various threats to the Warbler, including those caused by habitat fragmentation, \nurbanization, disease, and predation.  See Exhibit H at Factors A(1)(a) and C (unpaginated). \n80.  In fact, the Petition includes substantial scientific and commercial information \nshowing that habitat fragmentation, urbanization, disease, and predation may not pose substantial \nthreats to the Warbler.  See Exhibit D at 17, 22, 25, 27–28.  The Service failed to properly consider \n19 \n\nCase 6:22-cv-00044   Document 1   Filed 01/12/22   Page 21 of 25\nsuch information when making the Second 90-day Finding, which requires only substantial \nevidence that delisting may be warranted under a reasonable person standard.  The Service’s failure \nto apply the correct standard when reviewing the evidence set forth in the 90-day Petition regarding \nfragmentation, urbanization, disease, and predation violated the ESA and its then-applicable \nimplementing regulations and was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not \nin accordance with law; in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \nstatutory right; [or] without observance of procedure required by law . . . .”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \n- (D). \nFifth Claim For Relief \n \nTHE SERVICE IMPERMISSIBLY FAILED TO PROPERLY CONSIDER \nSUBSTANTIAL INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THE 90-DAY PETITION \nDEMONSTRATING INCREASES IN THE  \nWARBLER’S POPULATION AND HABITAT  \n \n(Violation of 16 U.S.C. § 1533(b)(3)(A); 50 C.F.R. § 424.14(b)(2) (2014); 50 C.F.R. § \n424.11(c)-(d); 5 U.S.C. § 706 \n81.  Plaintiff  realleges  and  incorporates  by  reference  the  allegations  contained  in \nParagraphs 1 through 80 as though fully set forth herein. \n82.  When making a finding on a delisting petition under 16 U.S.C. § 1533(b)(3)(A), \nthe Service “shall consider” the criteria referenced in 50 C.F.R. § 424.14(b)(2) (2014) and 50 \nC.F.R. § 424.11(c)-(d) (2014), which include population and habitat considerations. \n83.  The 90-day Petition presented substantial scientific and commercial information \ndemonstrating remarkable increases in Warbler population and habitat since the initial listing, \nthereby  meeting  the  applicable  statutory  and  regulatory  requirements  that  delisting  may  be \nwarranted under a reasonable person standard.  See Exhibit D at 18-29.  In reviewing the 90-day \nPetition, the Federal Defendants impermissibly rebuffed and downplayed such information by \n20 \n\nCase 6:22-cv-00044   Document 1   Filed 01/12/22   Page 22 of 25\nfailing to give appropriate credence to a wealth of peer-reviewed studies supporting a finding that \ndelisting may be warranted based upon increases in Warbler population and habitat.  See Exhibit \nH at Factor A(1)(a) (unpaginated).  \n84.  The Federal Defendants’ failures to follow their statutory and regulatory duties \nunder the ESA to properly consider relevant information presented in the 90-day Petition regarding \nWarbler population and habitat violate the ESA and was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, \nor limitations, or short of statutory right; [or] without observance of procedure required by law . . \n. .”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) - (D). \nSixth Claim for Relief \nTHE SERVICE IMPERMISSIBLY IGNORED SUBSTANTIAL INFORMATION  \nSET FORTH IN THE 90-DAY PETITION SHOWING THAT THE ORIGINAL \nSCIENTIFIC OR COMMERCIAL DATA USED AT THE TIME  \nTHE WARBLER WAS LISTED WERE IN ERROR \n \n(Violation of 50 C.F. R. § 424.1(d)(3) (2014); 5 U.S.C. § 706) \n85.  Plaintiff  realleges  and  incorporates  by  reference  the  allegations  contained  in \nParagraphs 1 through 84 as though fully set forth herein. \n86.  Under rules in effect as of the time relevant to this complaint, it is appropriate for \nthe Service to make a positive 90-day finding where a delisting petition shows that the best \nscientific or commercial data available when the species was originally listed (or the interpretation \nof such data) were in error.  See 50 C.F.R. § 424.11(d)(3) (2014); see also 81 Fed. Reg. 35698, \n35700 (June 3, 2016); 81 Fed. Reg. 7414 (Feb, 11, 2016) \n87.  Here,  the  90-day  Petition  provided  substantial  scientific  or  commercial  data \nshowing that the best scientific or commercial data available when the species was originally listed \n(or the interpretation of such data) were in error.  See Exhibit D at 14-20. \n21 \n\nCase 6:22-cv-00044   Document 1   Filed 01/12/22   Page 23 of 25\n88.  The  Federal  Defendants  inexplicably  ignored  the  substantial  scientific  and \ncommercial information in the 90-day Petition showing that the best scientific or commercial data \navailable when the species was originally listed (or the interpretation of such data) were in error.  \nSee Exhibit H at Factors A, C, and D (unpaginated).  This failure to properly consider such \ninformation set forth in the 90-day Petition was in violation of the ESA and its applicable \nregulations and was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law; in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; \n[or] without observance of procedure required by law . . . .”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (D). \nVII.  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully seeks an Order of this Court: \nA.  Declaring that Federal Defendants did not follow the proper evidentiary standard \nin the Second 90-Day Finding, thereby rendering the Second 90-Day Finding ultra vires, arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; [or] without observance of \nprocedure required by law. \nB.
