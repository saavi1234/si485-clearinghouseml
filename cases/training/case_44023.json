    "summary": "<p>On September 2, 2021, twelve volunteer legal observers for the New York City Chapter of the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the City of New York, the New York Police Department (NYPD), City officials, and individual police officers in their official capacities. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, brought this action under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, the New York State Constitution, and New York state law, alleging violations of their First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The complaint sought damages and declaratory and injunctive relief; specifically, actual and punitive damages, attorney&rsquo;s fees, a declaratory judgment stating the defendants&rsquo; violations of the plaintiffs&rsquo; rights, and permanent injunctive relief to prevent future violations of the plaintiffs&rsquo; rights.</p>\r\n<p>On June 4, 2020, the plaintiffs attended the racial justice protest in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the Bronx as NLG legal observers, intending to observe and document the police response to the protest. The complaint alleged that at that protest, at around 7:45pm, the NYPD used a police maneuver known as &ldquo;kettling&rdquo; to surround peaceful protesters, including the plaintiffs, with police officers, entrap them in a small area, and arrest them. Once these protesters were kettled, police officers used their fists, batons, and bicycles to beat the protesters and sprayed them with pepper spray. NYPD officers then arrested protesters and cuffed them so tightly with flex-cuffs that some suffered injuries or long-term nerve damage. Despite all wearing neon green hats and badges that clearly identified the plaintiffs as NLG legal observers, the plaintiffs were singled out, cuffed, and subjected to processing and detention in close proximity to other arrestees for hours, heightening their risk of contracting COVID-19. NYPD officers also allegedly seized or destroyed confidential legal observer notes.</p>\r\n<p>The complaint further alleged that, despite written NYPD policies and a 1977 stipulation and order that recognized the public&rsquo;s right to record, observe, and photograph police activity in public places, the NYPD had a longstanding practice of violating the rights of observers. The complaint alleged that the City, Mayor Bill de Blasio, Police Commissioner Shea, and other supervisory members of the NYPD had knowledge of&mdash;and knowingly failed to correct&mdash;this unconstitutional practice, failed to properly train NYPD officers on observers&rsquo; right to document police activity in public places, and failed to properly supervise and discipline officers who did not respect observers&rsquo; First Amendment rights. See the complaint in related case <em><a href=\"../../../../case/44000/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gray v. City of New York</a></em> for a detailed list of instances in which the NYPD allegedly violated the press&rsquo;s First Amendment right to document police action. Finally, the complaint alleged that the City had declared NLG observers essential workers on June 1, 2020, exempting the plaintiffs from the 8 pm curfew, further undermining the basis upon which the plaintiffs had been arrested.</p>\r\n<p>On September 3, 2021, the case was referred to Judge Colleen McMahon and Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein as possibly related to the consolidated action of other police conduct-related cases arising from the 2020 racial justice protests in New York, captioned as <em><a href=\"../../../../case/18092/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In re: New York City Policing During Summer 2020 Demonstrations</a></em>. This case was accepted as related on September 27, 2021. For discovery-related filings in all cases, as well as the district court&rsquo;s decisions on consolidated motions, visit that entry in the Clearinghouse.</p>\r\n<p>On July 21, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of their acceptance of the defendants&rsquo; Rule 68 offer of judgment. The court entered the judgment on July 26, 2022. Under the judgment, each plaintiff received between $2,501 and $10,001 in damages. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the judgment.</p>\r\n<p>As of March 17, 2023, the court was waiting on fee applications from the plaintiffs and the case remained open.</p>",

On May 25, 2020, police in Minneapolis, MN, murdered George Floyd. Almost \nimmediately, mass protests against police violence and in support of police accountability began \nnationwide. These protests, including those organized by those in the Black Lives Matter \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 2 of 79\nmovement and others, spread across the United States and the world, including here in New \nYork City where thousands exercised their constitutional rights to protest. Those protests were \nmet with a prolonged crackdown in response from the New York City Police Department \n(โNYPDโ).   \n2.  On June 4, 2020, after days of sustained protests and brutal NYPD response, \nNYPD members planned and executed a violent attack on a โFTP4โ1 protest in the Mott Haven \narea of the Bronx, (the โFTP4 Protestโ or the โMott Haven Protestโ).  \n3.  On June 4, 2020, each Plaintiff was acting as a volunteer Legal Observer for the \nNational Lawyers Guild (โNLGโ) โ New York City Chapter (โNLG-NYCโ) when they were \ntargeted because of, or in spite of, their status as a NLG-NYC Legal Observer to be grabbed and \nhandcuffed, often violently, by NYPD members at the FTP4 Protest.  \n4.  Prior to the June 4, 2020 FTP4 Protest, Defendants NYPD Commissioner Dermot \nShea, NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan, NYPD Assistant Chief Kenneth Lehr, and \nother NYPD members and representatives of Defendant City who were involved in planning the \npolice response to the FTP4 Protest knew that protesters planned to gather at The Hub at 149th \nStreet and 3rd Avenue in the Bronx and march through the Mott Haven streets participating in the \nprotest. Rather than planning to escort and facilitate the FTP4 Protest, those Defendants devised, \nand Defendants Monahan, Lehr, NYPD Legal Bureau Attorney Kenneth Rice, and other NYPD \nmembers (including other Defendants) under their command executed, a brutal trap for and \nviolent assault on the FTP4 protesters. For example, upon information and belief, Defendants \nMonahan and Lehr, along with other high-level NYPD policymakers who were involved in the \n \n1 โFTPโ stands for many things, including โFree the People,โ โFeed the People,โ  and, in the context of certain anti-\npolice protests, โFuck the Police.โ \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 3 of 79\npolice response to the FTP4 Protest, planned to utilize police resources including NYPD \nStrategic Response Group (โSRGโ) members in riot gear, some of whom were on bicycles, to \ntrap, then physically brutalize and arrest, FTP4 Protest attendees, without first having given them \nnotice or an opportunity to disperse - let alone a meaningful one. \n5.  Upon information and belief, the Defendant City officials who were involved in \ndeciding how the NYPD would responds to the FTP4 Protest devised, and other NYPD members \n(including other Defendants) executed, that brutal assault based on the โanti-police rhetoricโ of \nthe FTP4 protesters. For example, at a press conference shortly before the FTP4 Protest on June \n4, 2020, Defendant Shea said that the โanti-police rhetoric disgusts me to my core.โ2 Then, over \nthe course of the next several hours after that, as described more fully below, NYPD members - \nincluding the other individual Defendants โ under the command and supervision of Defendants \nMonahan and Lehr, among other NYPD supervisors, trapped, brutalized, and arrested FTP4 \nProtest participants as well as bystanders and witnesses, including Plaintiffs.  \n6.  With an 8:00 p.m. curfew - requiring orders to disperse and opportunities to \ncomply with them before any enforcement action could be taken - in place, at around 7:45 p.m., \nNYPD members kettled and trapped Plaintiffs and other protesters with lines of police blocking \nany possible escape. The NYPD then played nominal orders to disperse for show, but refused to \nallow them to leave โ even as they chanted โlet us go.โ At around 8:00 p.m., the police then \nbegan a brutal physical assault on the protesters, beating them with fists, batons, and bicycles, \ndeploying pepper spray, and employing similar violence.  \n7.  Past there, the NYPD engaged in long-standing, unconstitutional arrest processing \ntactics, ranging from wildly overtight handcuffs, to refusing to release protesters with \n \n2 https://twitter.com/NYPDnews/status/1268660244323983361  \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 4 of 79\nsummonses on the street in order to deter further protesting. For example, NYPD members \nphysically restrained hundreds of FTP4 Protest arrestees with flex-cuffs in a way that caused \nthem unnecessary pain and suffering and, in some cases, injuries, including serious and long-\nterm nerve damage โ and refused to remove obviously overtight cuffs, or were unable to \nbecause they were not issued the proper equipment. Then, rather than releasing other arrestees \nfrom the street as the New York State Criminal Procedure Law ยง 150.20, NYPD members \nsubjected them to lengthy and unnecessary custodial arrest processing and detention that \nconfined them in dangerously close quarters for hours, all at the height of the global COVID-19 \npandemic.  \n8.  The morning after the Mott Haven Protest, Defendant Shea ratified the \nmisconduct that occurred in the NYPDโs assault on the FTP4 Protest when he said the NYPD \nโhad a plan which was executed nearly flawlessly in the Bronx.โ 3 \n9.  Similarly, Defendant de Blasio ratified the misconduct that occurred in the \nNYPDโs assault on the FTP4 Protest when he said that โwhat happened in Mott Havenโฆis \nsomething that the NYPD saw comingโ on June 5, 20204 and when he bragged on June 7, 2020 \nthat he had โapproved the broad strategiesโ that the NYPD deployed โand sometimes [their] very \nspecific choicesโ made in terms of the police responses to the Summer 2020 Protests, including \nthe FTP4 Protest.5  \n \n3 Jake Offenhartz, Nick Pinto, and Gwynne Hogan, โNYPDโs Ambush of Peaceful Bronx Protestors Was โExecuted \nNearly Flawlessly,โ City Leaders Agree,โ Gothamist, June 5, 2020, available online at \nhttps://gothamist.com/news/nypds-ambush-of-peaceful-bronx-protesters-was-executed-nearly-flawlessly-city-\nleaders-agree.  \n4 See Transcript: Mayor de Blasio Holds Media Availability, June 5, 2020, available online at \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/410-20/transcript-mayor-de-blasio-holds-media-availability. \n5 See Transcript: Mayor de Blasio Holds Media Availability, June 7, 2020, available online at \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/413-20/transcript-mayor-de-blasio-holds-media-availability. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 5 of 79\n10.  Plaintiffsโ experiences have been well documented and widely reported in the \npress, including in Gothamist and The New York Law Journal and on WNYC. Through counsel, \nPlaintiffs have complained about the brutal NYPD crackdown on the FTP4 Protest, and their \nown experiences, repeatedly in writing and, in one case, in a live exchange on The Brian Lehrer \nShow: Ask the Mayor on WNYC, to Defendants de Blasio, Shea, and Hart, among other high-\nlevel Defendant City policymaking officials. They have provided written and oral statements to \nthe New York State Office of the Attorney General (โOAGโ) and the New York City Civilian \nComplaint Review Board (โCCRBโ). Their experiences have been documented in reports by \nHuman Rights Watch and the New York City Department of Investigation (โDOIโ). The New \nYork City Bar Association issued a strong statement condemning Plaintiffsโ arrests.   \n11.  Yet, although Defendants de Blasio, Shea, and other high-ranking Defendant City \nofficials have known about Defendantsโ uses of force against, arrests of, and other violations of \nPlaintiffs and Plaintiffsโ rights since June 4, 2020, they have not meaningfully supervised, \ntrained, investigated, or disciplined Defendant Rice or the other NYPD members who ordered \nand/or participated in using force on and arresting Plaintiffs and/or searching, seizing, or \ndestroying certain Plaintiffsโ Legal Observer notes, or taken other measures to address the \nviolations of Plaintiffsโ rights or to ensure that similar violations are not repeated in the future. \n12.  Therefore, Plaintiffs now bring suit seeking money damages, attorneyโs fees, \ncosts and expenses, as well as a declaratory judgment and prospective injunctive relief to prevent \nDefendants from violating Plaintiffsโ rights, and the rights of others who wish to observe and \ndocument police activities in New York City public spaces, in the future. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 6 of 79\n13.

The National Lawyers Guild (โNLGโ) โ NYC Chapter (โNLG-NYCโ) Legal \nObserver Program. \n68.  According to its website (http://www.nlg.org), the NLG โwas founded in 1937 as \nan association of progressive lawyers and jurists who believed that they had a major role to play \nin the reconstruction of legal values to emphasize human rights over property rights. The Guild is \nthe oldest and most extensive network of public interest and human rights activists working \nwithin the legal system.โ The NLG-NYC is a local NLG chapter. \n69.  NLG-NYC Legal Observers have been observing and documenting NYPD \nresponse to protests in the City streets since the late 1960โs and are well-known to NYPD \nmembers. \n70.  The NLGโs Legal Observer program was established in 1968 in New York City in \nresponse to protests at Columbia University and city-wide antiwar and civil rights \ndemonstrations.  \n71.  NLG-NYC Legal Observers are legal workers, law students, and lawyers trained \nby the NLG-NYC to observe and document police response to protests.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 17 of 79\n72.  When a Legal Observer completes the NLG-NYCโs Legal Observer training, the \nNLG-NYC issues them a bright neon green hat, as well as a badge on a lanyard, which \nprominently feature the NLG-NYC logo and the words โLEGAL OBSERVER.โ  \n73.  These items clearly identify their wearers as NLG-NYC Legal Observers to all โ \nincluding NYPD members: \n       \n74.  The First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and the attendant \nprovisions of the New York Constitution, protect the rights to observe and document the \nactivities of uniformed police in traditional public for a such as the New York City streets, \nincluding police responses to protest, and arrest activity, subject to reasonable time, place, \nmanner restrictions.  \n75.  In derogation of those rights, the NYPD has a long history, pattern, practice, and \ncustom of unlawfully curtailing the rights of witnesses and those who seek to document such \npolice activities, including by using force on, arresting, and/or prosecuting bystanders and \nobservers, including, but not limited to, press. \n76.  In 1977, the NYPD entered into a Stipulation and Order in Black v. Codd, 73 Civ. \n5283 (JMC) (SDNY, June 1, 1977). The Black v. Codd Stipulation and Order states:  \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 18 of 79\n[I]t is the policy of the New York City Police Department and the defendants that \nwhen a person (or persons) is detained, stopped or arrested in public areas, a \nperson or persons not involved in the conduct of which the first person is stopped \nor arrested may remain in the vicinity of the stop or arrest as an onlooker or \nonlookers, subject to the safety of the person stopped, the third persons, the \ngeneral public, and officers of the Police Department, and to provisions of law \ne.g. P.L. ยง 195.05. \n77.  The Black v. Codd Stipulation and Order defines an โonlookerโ as a โperson \nremaining in the vicinity of a stop or arrestโ and states that onlookers โshall not be subject to \narrest for violation of Penal Law ยง 195.05 unless the officer has probable cause to believe a \nviolation of ยง 195.05 exists.โ  It further states that โ[t]aking photographsโ and โ[r]emaining in \nthe vicinity of the stop or arrestโ explicitly do not โconstitute[] probable cause for arrest or \ndetention of an onlooker unless safety of officers or other persons is directly endangered or the \nofficer reasonably believes they are endangered or the law is otherwise violated.โ The Black v. \nCodd Stipulation and Order also requires that the arresting officer shall โreport the actionโ of a \nbystander arrest to a supervisor at the precinct.  \n78.  The Black v. Codd Stipulation and Order has historically been ignored.  See, e.g., \nTonge v. Kelly, 19993 WL 16121 (EDNY, 1993) (โthe City failed for ten years to maintain the \nformal guidelines to which it had agreed and to inform its police recruits and officers in its Patrol \nGuide of the standards established in the Codd consent orderโ). \n79.  Relatedly, the version of the NYPD Patrol Guide (โPGโ) that was in effect in June \nof 2020 recognizes the rights of people to observe, photograph, and record police activity in \npublic places without interfering with police operations.  \n80.  For example, PG ยง 203-29 (When a Member of the Service Encounters an \nIndividual Observing, Photographing, or Recording Police Activity), issued on June 12, 2018, \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 19 of 79\nstated: โIndividuals have a right to lawfully observe and/or record police activity including, but \nnot limited to detentions, searches, arrests or uses of force.โ \n81.  PG ยง 203-29 further instructed NYPD members that they must โNOT:  \n(1) Threaten, intimidate, or otherwise discourage an observer from recording the \npolice officerโs activities; or  \n(2) Intentionally block or obstruct cameras or other recording devices when there \nis no legitimate law enforcement reason to do so; or  \n(3) Delete any pictures or recordings from observerโs recording device or order \nobserver to delete such pictures or recordings.โ \n \n82.  Additionally, PG ยง 203-29 dictated that, unless they engage in other actions that \nare independent violations of the law, โan individual CAN NOT be arrested for:  \n(1) Taking photographs, videotaping, or making a digital recording; \n(2) Requesting or making note of shield numbers or names of members of the service;  \n(3) Criticizing the police or objecting to police activity;  \n(4) Refusing to leave the area; or  \n(5) Using crude or vulgar speech.โ \n83.  Beyond that, PG ยง 203-29 included examples of the kinds of conduct that give \nrise to the sort of โ[a]ctual interference with the performance of an official functionโ that is \ntypically required to support the arrest of a person observing, photographing, or recording police \nactivity, as follows:  \nโฆactual physical force (touching or physically interfering with the officer or the \nsuspect, i.e., using a camera so close to the officerโs face that it intentionally \nobstructs his or her view), or intruding into the physical space necessary to safely \nperform police operations and refusing to obey an order to move back, or \npurposefully engaging in passive behavior that prevents an officer from taking \nenforcement action (i.e., blocking a prisoner van, etc.). \n84.  Additionally, in the event the NYPD were to arrest someone who is observing, \nphotographing, or recording police activity, PG ยง 203-29 required the NYPD members involved \nto inform a supervisor. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 20 of 79\n85.  Beyond that, with respect to the rights of Legal Observers specifically, the version \nof PG ยง 213-11 (Policing Special Events/Crowd Control) that was in effect in June of 2020 \nexplicitly permitted properly identified Legal Observers โfree access through police lines at the \nscene of any demonstrationโฆ subject only to restrictions necessitated by personal safety \nfactorsโ; requires โ[a]llโ police to โextend every courtesy and cooperation toโ them; and \ndirected: โObservers shall be permitted to remain in any area, or observe any police activity, \nsubject only to restrictions necessitated by personal safety factors, as determined by the incident \ncommander.โ  \n86.  Despite the written policies reflected in PG ยง 203-29, between the time PG ยง 203-\n29 was inaugurated in 2018 and the June 4, 2020 FTP4 Protest, NYPD members continued to \nviolate the rights of witnesses, observers, and those seeking to document uniformed police \nactivities in public places on a persistent and widespread basis, flouting the requirements of PG ยง \n203-29. \n87.  For example, the Gray complaint referred to above and incorporated by reference \nherein includes a litany of examples of such NYPD misconduct.  \n88.  And, although Defendants de Blasio, Shea, Monahan, and Hart knew or should \nhave known that NYPD members were violating the rights of witnesses, observers, and those \nseeking to document uniformed activities in public places on a persistent and widespread basis, \nincluding in connection with the Summer 2020 Protests and the FTP4 Protest, they failed to \ntrain, supervise, or discipline the responsible NYPD members, ratifying their misconduct and \nsending the clear message that NYPD and Defendant City brass endorse and support it. \nB.  Defendant de Blasio issues Curfew Orders in New York City, and the NYPD Directs \nOfficers to Implement the Curfew Orders Incorrectly and Illegally. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 21 of 79\n89.  Prior to June 4, 2020, Defendant de Blasio had issued several emergency \nexecutive orders related to โthe presence of Covid-19 in the city.โ \n90.  The first Emergency Executive Order (Executive Order No 98) was issued on \nMarch 12, 2020, and was extended by Emergency Executive Order No 112 on May 9, 2020. \n91.  On June 1, 2020, Defendant de Blasio issued Emergency Executive Order 117, \nciting an alleged escalation of protest activity to include acts of assault, vandalism, property \ndamage and/or looting (at unspecified dates, times and/or locations) and enacting a city-wide \ncurfew beginning at 11:00 p.m. on June 1, 2020 until 5:00 a.m. on June 2, 2020.14 \n92.  Then, Defendant de Blasio issued Emergency Executive Order 118, ordering a \ncity-wide curfew from 8:00 p.m. on June 2, 2020 until 5:00 a.m. on June 3, 2020.15   \n93.  And building on that, Defendant de Blasio finally issued Emergency Executive \nOrder 119, ordering a city-wide curfew from June 3, 2020 to June 8, 2020 between the hours of \n8:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. 16  \n94.  That curfew โ from 8:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. โ was in effect on June 4 when the \nFTP4 Protest took place. \n95.  Finally, Emergency Executive Order 119 contained the following exemptions for \npeople performing โEssential workโ: \nThis Order shall not apply to police officers, peace officers, firefighters, first \nresponders and emergency medical technicians, individuals travelling to and \nfrom essential work and performing essential work, people experiencing \nhomelessness and without access to a viable shelter, and individuals seeking \nmedical treatment or medical supplies. โEssential workโ is work performed by \nessential businesses or entities as defined or permitted by the Empire State \n \n14 See Emergency Executive Order No. 117, available at \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/executive-orders/2020/eeo-117.pdf. \n15 See, e.g., https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1267642422194057217?s=20; Emergency Executive Order No. \n118, available at https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/executive-orders/2020/eeo-118.pdf.  \n16 See Emergency Executive Order No. 119, available at \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/executive-orders/2020/eeo-119.pdf.  \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 22 of 79\nDevelopment Corporation. \n \n96.  The Empire State Development Corporationโs relevant guidance categorized \nโlawyersโ as people providing โ[p]rofessional services with extensive restrictionsโ and stated: \nLawyers may continue to perform all work necessary for any service so long \nas it is performed remotely. Any in-person work presence shall be limited to \nwork only in support of essential businesses or services; however, even work \nin support of an essential business or service should be conducted as remotely \nas possible.17 \n \n97.  By the terms of Emergency Executive Orders 117, 118 and 119 (collectively, the \nโCurfew Ordersโ), โa failure to comply with the Order[s] shall result in orders to disperseโ \n(emphasis added).18  \n98.  The Curfew Orders also provided that โany person who knowingly violates the \nprovisions in this Order shall be guilty of a Class B misdemeanorโ under NYC Administrative \nCode (โACโ) ยง 3-108. \n99.  AC ยง 3-108 contains a knowing intent requirement: โAny knowing violation of a \nprovision of any emergency measure established pursuant to this chapter shall be a class B \nmisdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars, or by imprisonment for \nnot more than three months, or both.โ \n100.  Under New York Penal Law (โPLโ) ยง 15.05, โA person acts knowingly with \nrespect to conduct or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he is \naware that his conduct is of such nature or that such circumstance exists.โ \n101.  As the plain text of the Curfew Orders, AC ยง 3-108, and PL ยง 15.05 make clear, a \nviolation of the Curfew Orders could not have occurred  unless the alleged violator had received \n \n17 See https://esd.ny.gov/guidance-executive-order-2026.  \n18 E.O. 117 technically had a typo, stating โ[f]ailure to comply with this Order shall result in orders to disburse.โ  \nThat typo was corrected in the subsequent Curfew Orders.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 23 of 79\nan audible order to disperse, along with an appropriate opportunity to disperse, and had refused \nto leave. \n102.  As the plain text of the Curfew Orders, AC ยง 3-108, and PL ยง 15.05 also make \nclear, there would be no probable cause to arrest an alleged violator unless the alleged violator \nhad received an audible order to disperse, along with an appropriate opportunity to disperse, and \nhad refused to leave. \n103.  The NYPD issued two official statements directing officers how to implement the \nCurfew Orders, through the FINEST message system (which sends internal messages to NYPD \nmembers). \n104.  First, on July 1, the NYPD Operations Division used the FINEST system to \ninstruct officers that โ[curfew e]nforcement will only be taken after several warnings are issued \nand the violator is refusing to complyโ (emphasis added). 19 \n105.  However, in a FINEST message sent June 3, the NYPD Operations Division \nomitted any reference to warnings or orders to disperse, directing simply that โ[i]f [members of \nthe service] observe a person violating the curfew, a C-Summons may be issued for Admin. \nCode 3-108, Violating a Mayoral Emergency Order.โ20 \n106.  Thus, at the June 4 protest, the official policy of NYPD and the City of New York \nwas that orders to disperse and opportunities to comply were not required before arrests for \nalleged Curfew Orders violations could be made โ and that the simple fact that protesters were \nout past 8:00 p.m. on June 4 at Mott Haven (having been trapped there by NYPD) was sufficient \ncause for using force on, arresting, and prosecuting them.  \n \n19 NYPD FINEST Message, City-Wide Curfew (June 1, 2020).  \n20 NYPD FINEST Message, Curfew Extension (June 3, 2020).  \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 24 of 79\nC.  Representatives of Defendants City and de Blasio Stated that Legal Observers Were \nโEssential Workersโ Under the Curfew Orders. \n107.  During the Summer 2020 Protests and including the time period in which the \nCurfew Orders were in effect, Legal Observers who observed and sought to document police \nresponse to protests in the streets, as well as legal workers and others who provided โjail \nsupportโ outside precincts and at courthouses from which arrested protesters were released after \nprocessing, performed โessential workโ that could not be performed remotely.  \n108.  For example, Legal Observers typically collect the names of arrestees at the scene \nof arrests, and try to learn from police where they will be taken for arrest processing, in order to \nprovide those names and that information to lawyers and legal workers as soon as possible after \nthe arrests occur.  \n109.  Only after NLG-NYC lawyers and legal workers confirm where police have \nbrought arrestees for arrest processing โ which often requires working with Legal Observers and \nothers who are physically present at several different locations โ can they provide police \nprocessing those arrests with written letters of representation invoking the arresteesโ rights to \ncounsel, as well as communicate with them, and clients in custody, about the clientsโ health, the \nstatus of their arrest processing, and other, similar matters.  \n110.  Beyond that, NLG-NYC lawyers and legal workers also perform โessential workโ \nwith people who provide jail support to arrestees by maintaining a physical presence wherever \narrestees are being released from police custody.  \n111.  Doing such โjail supportโ is the only way to ensure that arrestees are actually \nreleased and to connect them with further legal support, representation, and other resources in a \ntimely manner.  \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 25 of 79\n112.  Those Legal Observer, legal, and jail support activities are clearly protected under \nthe First Amendment, among other ways, and when lawyers and legal workers cannot engage in \nthem, arrestees suffer frustrations of their rights to remain silent and to legal counsel as well as \nother important constitutional and other rights. \n113.  By the time the first of the Curfew Orders was announced on June 1, 2020, the \nmass arrests the NYPD had made in the days prior, and the NYPDโs use of and adherence to \nproblematic large-scale arrest processing procedures, had already created emergency conditions \nthat severely interfered with, and in many cases prevented, Legal Observers, lawyers, and legal \nworkers from performing their essential work. For example, the NYPDโs large-scale arrest \nprocessing procedures effectively prevented arrested protesters from communicating with legal \ncounsel (or anyone else), and also prevented lawyers and legal workers for arrested protesters \nfrom communicating with police about arrested clients while they were in NYPD custody.  \n114.  In fact, those serious impediments to providing legal representation to arrested \nprotesters around the time Defendant de Blasio announced the first of the Curfew Orders had \nprompted the NLG-NYC; virtually all of New York Cityโs public defenders (The Legal Aid \nSociety, The Bronx Defenders, Brooklyn Defender Services, New York County Defenders \nServices, and Neighborhood Defender Services of Harlem); 5Boro Defenders; as well as the \nBenjamin N. Cardozo School of Law Criminal Defense Clinic and The Defenders Clinic of \nCUNY School of Law to write a joint letter dated June 3, 2020 to NYPD Defendants Shea and \nde Blasio demanding that the NYPD and the City take immediate steps to remedy what were \nthen already serious and ongoing problems. A copy of the letter is attached and incorporated by \nreference herein.21  \n \n21 A copy of the letter is also available online at https://legalaidnyc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2020-6-3-\nLetter-Re-1PP-Pre-Arraignment-Communication-Issues.pdf. On June 4, 2020, a few hours before the Mott Haven \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 26 of 79\n115.  Against that backdrop, as soon as the first of the Curfew Orders was announced, \nthose providing critical legal support to arrested protesters obtained confirmation that Defendant \nCity viewed Legal Observers, and legal workers performing jail support, as exempt โessential \nworkersโ on an emergency basis.  \n116.  For example, on June 1, 2020, Amanda Wallwin, Chief of Staff for Assemblyman \nDan Quart, e-mailed Jenny Sobelman, Chief of Staff, Mayorโs Office of State Legislative \nAffairs, asking โAre there any plans to exempt folks who are doing jail, legal and medical \nsupport for arrested protestors?โ and โ[S]o supports for arrested protestors are not exempt from \nthe curfew, correct?โ  \n117.  At 8:32pm on June 1, 2020, Ms. Sobelman responded on behalf of the Mayorโs \nOffice: โYes. They are exempt from the curfew.โ  \n118.  Additionally, in response to a separate inquiry from a separate party, Tan \nPersephone, a Legislative Representative at the Mayorโs Office of City Legislative Affairs, \nconfirmed in an e-mail sent at 9:41pm on June 1, 2020 that she had โchecked in with the \nMayorโs counsel who confirmed: yes, those lawyers are essential and can show up in person if \nthey canโt do their work remotely. Protecting oneโs liberty is about as essential as it gets. If non-\nlawyers are volunteering to provide essential support to the lawyers, they are essential as well.โ \nThat e-mail ccโd Eric Cecil Henry, General Counsel, City Legislative Affairs โ Office of the \nMayor. \n119.  Based on those confirmations from representatives of Defendant City that Legal \nObservers were โessential workersโ, the NLG-NYC drafted an โAttestation of Essential \n \nmass arrests, The City reported on the joint letter. See Rosa Goldensohn, โNYPD Shut Off George Floyd Protesters \nFrom Legal Help, Attorneys Charge,โ The City, June 4, 2020, available online at \nhttps://www.thecity.nyc/2020/6/4/21280746/nypd-shut-off-george-floyd-protesters-from-legal-help-attorneys-\ncharge.   \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 27 of 79\nServicesโ to provide to Legal Observers who would volunteer during the curfew, in order to \nprovide them some measure of protection in the event the NYPD decided to interpret Defendant \nde Blasioโs curfew differently than those Mayoral officials.  \n120.  Beginning on June 1, 2020 and throughout the time period in which the Curfew \nOrders were in effect, including on June 4, 2020, the NLG-NYC provided each LO volunteer \nwith an โAttestation of Legal Servicesโ to fill out and carry, as well as copies of the e-mails \nbetween Ms. Wallwin and Ms. Sobelman to carry. \n121.  The NLG-NYC Attestation of Essential Services was printed on NLG-NYC \nletterhead and stated: \nAttestation of Essential Services \n \nAttention: Law Enforcement Official \n \nI, ___________, attest that I am a volunteer Legal Observer with the Mass \nDefense Committee of the National Lawyers Guild โ NYC Chapter. \n \nPer order of the cityโs essential services provision, my volunteer function is \ncategorized as essential services. The Chief of Staff of Mayor De Blasio, Office \nof State Legislative Affairs, has confirmed in writing to the Chief of Staff of \nAssemblymember Dan Quart that volunteers providing โjail, legal, and medical \nsupport,โ including both lawyers and non-lawyers providing legal support to \nclients who have been arrested in connection with a protest, are exempted workers \nunder the order directing the terms of the curfew. \n \nAs a Legal Observer, I am providing legal support to arrested protestors. This \nsupport is essential in the protection of the First Amendment rights of the citizens \nof New York City, as well as for the smooth functioning of the arraignment \nprocess. As part of the legal support that I am providing, my travel throughout the \ncity constitutes โessential workโ as confirmed by the \noffice of Mayor De Blasio. \n \nThe above named individual may present identification and this letter as \ninstructed.  \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 28 of 79\n122.  The Attestation included signature and date lines for each LO to fill out. Finally, \nthe Attestation provided that, for โverification or with any questionsโ, the NYPD should contact \nthe NLG-NYC or its President, and provided phone numbers for both, so that police could verify \nthat a Legal Observer bearing a NLG-NYC Attestation of Essential Services was indeed \nvolunteering with the NLG-NYC at any time.  \nD.  Defendants City, de Blasio, Shea, Monahan, Hart, and other NYPD Members Fails \nto Train or Supervise Regarding Enforcement of the Curfew Orders, Including \nAgainst Legal Observers. \n123.   Upon information and belief, aside from the FINEST messages described above, \nDefendant City representatives failed to train or supervise NYPD members in enforcing the \nCurfew Orders, including in how to interpret and apply the exemptions contained in the Curfew \nOrders for โessential workers.โ \n124.  Upon information and belief, Defendants City, de Blasio, Shea, Monahan, Hart, \nand other NYPD members conducted no training, or inadequate training, for NYPD members \nregarding how to interpret and apply the exemptions contained in the Curfew Orders for \nโessential workersโ as to Legal Observers. \n125.  Additionally, Defendants City, de Blasio, Shea, Monahan, Hart, and other NYPD \nmembers conducted no training, or inadequate training, to Defendant Rice as to the NYPDโs \nwritten policies regarding  \n126.  And, as seen below, Defendants City, de Blasio, Shea, Monahan, Hart, Lehr, and \nother NYPD members failed to supervise, investigate, and/or discipline their subordinates in \nconnection with their roles in suppressing and brutalizing the FTP4 Protest, as well as arresting \nPlaintiffs and otherwise violating their rights. \nE.  NYPD Kettles and Suppresses the FTP4 Protest at Mott Haven. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 29 of 79\n127.  On June 4, 2020, Plaintiffs were volunteering as NLG-NYC LOs to observe \npolice response to the FTP4 Protest that began with a rally around โthe Hubโ at 3rd Avenue and \n149th Street in the Bronx. \n128.  That evening, NYPD members apparently escorted, acquiesced in, and/or \nfacilitated a demonstration and march that began around โThe Hubโ at 149th Street and 3rd \nAvenue and continued through the Mott Haven streets, eventually proceeding south on Willis \nAvenue toward the Willis Avenue Bridge. \n129.  The Hub is one of the โmost dynamic commercial centersโ in the Bronx and has \nbeen called โthe Times Square of the Bronx.โ22 The description is apt for the geographic \nconfiguration of The Hub, which is formed by the intersection of East 149th Street and Willis, \nMelrose, and Third Avenues. \n130.  Most of the protestors initially met at The Hub located at 149th Street in Bronx \nCounty, at or around 6:00 p.m. \n131.  Among the purposes of the June 4th rally were to demand racial justice and \naccountability for police violence against Black people and people of color. The protesters \nchanted โI canโt breatheโ โ the last words of George Floyd and of Eric Garner, who was killed by \nan NYPD officer โ and other messages critical of the NYPD.  \n132.  Protesters left The Hub and marched through the Mott Haven neighborhood. \n133.  In an effort to suppress the Mott Haven protestersโ message and to intimidate \nthem, Defendants orchestrated an operation to corral, or โkettle,โ the protesters, assault them, and \narrest them. \n \n22 Alison Gregor, People, Shops and Roads Converge Here, N.Y. TIMES (June 8, 2012) \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 30 of 79\n134.  Defendantsโ plan for the June 4th Mott Haven protest was to instill fear in the \nprotesters and others who might join them in future protests. \n135.  From the outset, there was a large police presence surrounding The Hub, with \nofficers placed on rooftops, near subways, and many were dressed in full riot gear, including \nKevlar vests, helmets and forearm plutes.  \n136.  As protesters began marching down Third Avenue, NYPD members accompanied \nthem and followed them the entire time. \n137.  The march itself proceeded with little or no interaction with NYPD as it made its \nway toward East 136th Street. \n138.  The march continued through the grounds of the Patterson Houses, a public \nhousing project whose residents are primarily people of color. Residents voiced their support for \nthe protestersโ message: some leaned out their windows banging pots and pans. \n139.  The march continued south on Willis Avenue, still accompanied by police. At \nvarious times, protesters chanted slogans expressing their anger over the conduct of the NYPD in \ntheir community.  \n140.  At some time before 8:00 p.m. (upon information and belief, several minutes \nbefore 7:45 p.m.), NYPD Strategic Response Group officers wearing dark padding or body \narmor and bike helmets formed a line with their bodies and NYPD bicycles at 135th Street and \nWillis Avenue, causing the protesters to turn left (east) onto 136th Street.  \n141.  At around the same time and/or as the protesters proceeded east on 136th Street, \nDefendants NYPD Members John and Jane Does 1-20 (the โBrook Avenue Line Doesโ) formed \na police blockade ahead of, and downhill from, the protesters, on 136th Street at Brook Avenue \n(the โBrook Avenue Lineโ).  \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 31 of 79\n142.  As protesters arrived on the 136th Street block between Brown Place (on the west) \nand Brook Avenue (on the east, downhill), they encountered the Brook Avenue Line. \n143.  At around the same time as the protesters encountered the Brook Avenue Line, \nDefendants NYPD Members John and Jane Does 21-40 (the โBrown Place Doesโ) formed a \nsecond police blockade on 136th Street and Brown Place (the โBrown Place Lineโ).  \n144.  Also at around the same time, a third group of Defendants NYPD Members John \nand Jane Does 41-60 (the โSidewalk Lines Doesโ) formed a third police blockade between the \n136th Street roadway and the sidewalks to the north and south of 136th Street (the โSidewalk \nLinesโ), effectively preventing people trapped on the roadway between the Brook Avenue Line \nand the Brown Place Line from going onto the sidewalk, and people trapped on the sidewalk \nfrom entering the roadway.  \n145.  The Brook Avenue Line Does, Brown Place Does, and Sidewalk Line Does \nformed a police trap or โkettleโ from which protesters, including Plaintiffs (as described in more \ndetail below) could not leave โ the โMott Haven Kettle.โ  \n146.  At no time โ from when the protesters gathered at The Hub until they were kettled \non East 136th Street โ did any NYPD officer order the protesters to disperse. \n147.  On the contrary, the police escorted the protesters on the entire march from The \nHub to East 136th Street, and stopped vehicular traffic on cross streets to permit the march to \nproceed safely. \n148.  Once the Mott Haven Kettle was formed, NYPD members did not permit those \nwithin the kettle who were not NYPD members to leave the kettle.  \n149.  As the protesters were held in the kettle, they asked NYPD officers to allow them \nto leave, and chanted โLet us go, let us go.โ   \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 32 of 79\n150.  The NYPD did not permit protesters to leave the kettle.  \n151.  With the protesters trapped, the NYPD launched the next phase of its plan. \n152.  The back and front lines of Mott Haven Kettle (that is, the Brown Place Line and \nthe Brook Avenue Line) pressed in, pushing the protesters tightly together โ condensing the \nMott Haven Kettle in space, while paradoxically demanding protesters directly in front of the \nBrook Avenue Line โmove backโ into the part of the crowd being pressed forward by the Brown \nPlace Line. \n153.  Once police formed the Mott Haven Kettle, NYPD members began to grab and \nhandcuff arrestees, in some cases shoving, grabbing, and/or beating trapped protesters. \n154.  Defendant Monahan, the NYPDโs highest-ranking uniformed member, was \npresent supervising and directing police actions at the Mott Haven Kettle scene.  \n155.  Upon information and belief, Defendant Monahan acted as NYPD โIncident \nCommanderโ within the meaning of NYPD Patrol Guide (the person โresponsible for the \ncommand, control and coordination of all incident operationsโ) with respect to, and/or otherwise \nplanned and/or supervised the deployment of, the Mott Haven Kettle. \n156.  Defendant Lehr, Commanding Officer of the Patrol Borough Bronx, was present \nsupervising and directing police actions at the Mott Haven Kettle scene. \n157.  Defendant Rice was also present giving advice related to, supervising, and \ndirecting police actions at the Mott Haven Kettle scene. \n158.  Defendants NYPD Supervisors John and Jane Does 61-80 (the โNYPD \nSupervisor Doesโ) are NYPD members of the rank Sergeant and above who were other \nsupervisors involved in planning for, deploying, and/or supervising the deployment of the Mott \nHaven Kettle. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 33 of 79\n159.  Defendants Monahan, Lehr, Rice, the NYPD Supervisor Does,  the Brook Avenue \nLine Does, Brown Place Does, Sidewalk Line Does, and other NYPD members, including the \nother NYPD members discussed or described below, detained and arrested Plaintiffs and other \narrestees in the Mott Haven Kettle on 136th Street between Brook Avenue and Brown Place.  \n160.  Additionally, upon information and belief, Defendant Monahan and other NYPD \nmembers were involved in planning for, supervising, and/or deploying the large-scale arrest \nprocessing procedures to which Plaintiffs were subjected based on their arrest at a protest, also \nmentioned below, including the decisions not to issue Plaintiffs summonses on the street and \ninstead to subject Plaintiffs to unduly lengthy, and unsafe, mass arrest processing.  \n161.  And beyond that, since June 4, 2020, Defendants de Blasio, Shea, Monahan, their \nsubordinates, and other Defendant City representatives, have failed to train, investigate, \nsupervise, or discipline any of the involved NYPD members in a meaningful way.  \n162.  To the contrary, Defendants de Blasio, Shea, and Monahan have publicly \napplauded each other in connection with, and otherwise justified and defended, the entire police \noperation. \n163.  Upon information and belief, this โkettleโ was fully formed by the Defendants at \napproximately 7:45 p.m., trapping most of the protestors inside. \n164.  Thus, protesters were unable to comply with the nominal orders to disperse the \nNYPD gave after the trap had already been sprung.  \n165.  No NYPD member had individualized probable cause to arrest any Plaintiff. \n166.  Just after 8:00, a brutal assault began.  \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 34 of 79\n167.  Police officers with batons and shields struck people at the edge of the encircled \ngroup, thrust raised bicycles into trapped protesters, and indiscriminately sprayed them with \npepper spray.  \n168.  In some instances, officers pulled down protestersโ COVID-protective face masks \nand pulled up face shields to pepper spray protesters directly in the face. \n169.  The protesters had committed no acts of violence or resistance that would justify \nthis excessive and unreasonable use of force. \n170.  Many protesters were left injured and bleeding. Some protesters fainted, or lost \nconsciousness and went into convulsions. \n171.  Defendant Monahan personally ordered the arrest of one of the organizers and \nleaders of the protest โ Shellyne Rodriguez โ who was committing no offense and was \nengaged in protected speech at the very moment he ordered officers to arrest her. \n172.  Despite their unambiguous status as essential workers exempt from the curfew, \nalong with the fact that they were carrying communications showing Defendant de Blasio had \nsaid as much, volunteer medics and National Lawyers Guild โ NYC Chapter Legal Observers \nwere arrested. \n173.  Upon information and belief, the purpose of arresting such workers was to ensure \nthat medical care was denied to injured protesters to further the deterrent effect of the \ncrackdown, and to prevent people like Plaintiffs from having documentation of exactly what \nhappened, and which officers harmed them.  \n174.  Individuals who happened to be in the vicinity of East 136th Street and Brook \nAvenue at the time of the police operation โ individuals who had not marched from The Hub and \nwere not protesting โ were also arrested. \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 35 of 79\n175.  In the next phase of the NYPDโs operation, officers began to systematically \nhandcuff the kettled protesters and subject them to lengthy large-scale arrest processing. \n176.  Many protesters, who had done nothing to the officers and were not resisting \narrest, were violently thrown to the ground before they were handcuffed. \n177.  Officers pulled protesters out of the kettle and used unnecessary force to bring \ntheir arms behind them.  \n178.  Officers systematically applied zip-tie cuffs that were cinched tighter than \nnecessary. \n179.  In some instances, officers literally lifted protesters off the ground using the zip-\ntie cuffs.  \n180.  Many protesters complained that their zip-tie cuffs were too tight and were \ncausing their hands to become numb, and many protestersโ hands turned purple. \n181.  Instead of issuing protesters summonses on the street consistent with the \nrequirements of the New York Criminal Procedure Law, the NYPD held protesters over in \noverly tight zip-tie cuffs and transported them in close quarters to a large-scale arrest processing \nfacility. \n182.  Throughout the NYPDโs June 4th operation, most of the officers did not wear face \nmasks or face shields to prevent the transmission of the coronavirus. \n183.  On June 4, 2020, New York City had suffered more than 280,000 reported cases \nof COVID-19, and over 1,000 new cases were reported that day. \n184.  Unlike the police, most of the protesters did wear masks or face shields, but in \nmany instances, officers forcibly removed protestersโ masks and face shields, further \nendangering their safety. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 36 of 79\n185.  Once arrested, people were unable to re-position their masks to cover their noses \nand mouths while they were rear-cuffed, and as a result, they were transported to the arrest \nprocessing facilities in enclosed vehicles without proper face coverings. Protesters complained \nthat their faces were left uncovered, but NYPD members did nothing to assist them. \nF.  NYPD Members, Including Defendant Rice, Target Plaintiff NLG-NYC Legal \nObservers. \n186.  As described more fully below, Defendant NYPD members, including Defendant \nRice, targeted Plaintiff NLG-NYC Legal Observers at the Mott Haven Kettle, ordering and \nassisting in using force on, arresting, and handcuffing them.  \n187.  For example, video evidence as well as witness statements show Defendant Rice \non the scene specifically singling out and targeted NLG-NYC Legal Observers who were not \nobstructing police activities or causing any safety threat to be grabbed and handcuffed, in \nviolation of their constitutional and statutory rights and the applicable NYPD Patrol Guide \nprovisions. See https://youtu.be/yuJWAEqfHO8. \n188.  The beginning of the video shows protesters and others watching Plaintiff \nJonathan Davis within the Mott Haven Kettle and being placed in handcuffs. In response, people \npoint out that he is a Legal Observer and ask, โWhy is he being arrested?โ \n189.  Defendant Rice can then be seen on the video shouting to NYPD members \npresent, โLegal Observers CAN be arrested, youโre good to go,โ pointing at some of Plaintiffs \nwho were on a nearby sidewalk. \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 37 of 79\n \n190.  After Defendant Rice gave that direction, NYPR members physically arrested a \nnumber of Plaintiffs โ in several cases, roughly or violently โ and placed in plastic flex-cuffs.  \n191.  Additionally, in several instances, NYPD members either seized, searched, or \ndestroyed confidential and privileged Legal Observer notes. \n192.  As seen below, although many Defendant City policymakers, including \nDefendants de Blasio, Shea, Monahan, and Hart, have long known that Defendant Rice and other \nDefendants and NYPD members had arrested and otherwise violated Plaintiffsโ rights, rather \nthan supervising, investigating, and disciplining them, and/or taking other remedial measures \nsuch as training, re-training, and future monitoring, they have ratified and endorsed the \nmisconduct of those who illegally used force on, arrested, handcuffed, and otherwise violated \nPlaintiffsโ rights. \nG. Allegations Specific to Each Plaintiff.  \nPlaintiff Rex Santus \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 38 of 79\n193.  Plaintiff Rex Santus is a law student at CUNY School of Law. \n194.  At all times relevant herein, Mr. Santus was clearly identified as a NLG-NYC \nLegal Observer, in that he was wearing a bright neon green hat, which prominently features the \nNLG-NYC logo and the words โLEGAL OBSERVER.โ  \n195.  At all times relevant herein, Mr. Santus had an NLG-NYC Attestation of Essential \nServices printed on NLG-NYC letterhead in his possession.  \n196.  Mr. Santus first arrived in the Mott Haven area around 6:30 p.m. \n197.  At between 6:30 and 6:45 p.m. at or around 149th Street and 3rd Avenue, \nDefendants NYPD members John Does 81-88, all male, detained Mr. Santus, searched Mr. \nSantus and seized his property, and questioned him, without consent, probable cause, or lawful \njustification. \n198.  Specifically, Defendant Does 81-88 pulled in front of Mr. Santus in a silver \nunmarked minivan, exited, and surrounded Mr. Santus on all sides with his back to a building.  \n199.  Defendant Does 81-88 blocked Mr. Santusโs path. \n200.  One of Defendant Does 81-88 held out his hand in a manner that prevented Mr. \nSantus from walking farther.  \n201.  One or more of Does 81-88 then subjected Mr. Santus to custodial questioning \nwithout any advice of rights or consent, and without allowing Mr. Santus the opportunity to \nconsult with counsel.  \n202.  None of these officers was wearing a COVID-protective face mask, nor did any of \nthem practice appropriate social distancing.  \n203.  Then, one of Does 81-88 demanded Mr. Santusโs identification.  \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 39 of 79\n204.  One of Does 81-88 also seized Mr. Santusโs Legal Observer notes, which are \nprivileged as attorney work product, and began to leaf through and read their contents.  \n205.  Does 81-88 acted as if they had no idea what they National Lawyers Guild or a \nLegal Observer was.  \n206.  But Mr. Santus overheard an officer on the radio saying, in sum and substance, โa \nlot of green hats out here tonight.โ \n207.  One of Does 81-88 accused Mr. Santus of โillegal counter-surveillance of the \nNYPD.โ \n208.  They continued to question Mr. Santus, until Mr. Santus refused to answer \nquestion without an attorney.  \n209.  One of Does 81-88, who had been reviewing Mr. Santusโs privileged notes, \nremarked that he had written down โcops with black tape,โ in noting that many officers were \ncovering their badge numbers with black tape. \n210.  That officer was wearing black tape covering his badge number. \n211.  That officer, not wearing a mask, got within 12 inches of Mr. Santusโs face and \ndemanded, โWhat do you think this tape means?โ \n212.  The officer then noticed that Mr. Santus appeared frightened, and asked about \nthat.  \n213.  Mr. Santus said, in sum and substance, โYes, I am frightened, I am alone and \nsurrounded by cops.โ \n214.  Mr. Santus then reiterated that he did not want to speak without an attorney.  \n215.  The officer said, โfine, then stop speaking.โ \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 40 of 79\n216.  Does 81-88 eventually released Mr. Santus, after one officer said, in sum and \nsubstance, โheโs clean.โ \n217.  That officer had been using a device and handling Mr. Santusโs ID. \n218.  Later that evening, after the Mott Haven Kettle was formed on 136th Street \nbetween Brown Place and Brook Avenue, as Mr. Santus attempted to perform his work as a \nLegal Observer by recording the names of arrestees, at least Defendant NYPD member John or \nJane Doe 90 grabbed Mr. Santus from behind and forced Mr. Santus down to the ground.  \n219.  An officer, NYPD Member John or Jane Doe 89, told Mr. Santus to โdo the smart \nthingโ as he was being grabbed and shoved to the ground.  \n220.  Then, one of Defendants NYPD members John or Jane Does 90-92 rear-cuffed \nMr. Santus with tight, plastic flex-cuffs.  \n221.  Defendant NYPD Member John Doe 93, a male NYPD officer, then unlawfully \nsearched Mr. Santusโs person and seized Mr. Santusโs property, including, but not limited to, Mr. \nSantusโs identification, which NYPD Member John Doe 94 or another NYPD member took a \nphotograph of and/or otherwise documented information from. \n222.  After an extended period of time, during which time Mr. Santus remained in \nhandcuffs, one of Does 94-95, or a different NYPD Member , John Doe 96, cut off the handcuffs \nand released Mr. Santus. \n223.  Mr. Santus has not acted as a Legal Observer since this incident. \nPlaintiff Krystin Hernandez \n224.  Plaintiff Krystin Hernandez is a law student at City University School of Law.  \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 41 of 79\n225.  At all times relevant herein, Mx. Hernandez was clearly identified as a NLG-NYC \nLegal Observer, in that Mx. Hernandez was wearing a bright neon green hat, as well as a badge \non a lanyard, which prominently feature the NLG-NYC logo and the words โLEGAL \nOBSERVER.โ  \n226.  At all times relevant to herein, Mx. Hernandez had an NLG-NYC Attestation of \nEssential Services printed on NLG-NYC letterhead in Claimantโs possession.  \n227.  Mx. Hernandez Legal Observed the protest along with their husband, Plaintiff \nJalen Matney. \n228.  Mx. Hernandez arrived at the protest shortly after 6:00 p.m.  \n229.  Beginning shortly after that, Mx. Hernandez partnered with Plaintiff Sarah Mills-\nDirlam to document police covering their shield numbers.  \n230.  They saw a large number of officers who had covered their shield numbers with \nblack tape or bands.  \n231.  However, when they tried to document those officers, some objected and told \nthem, in sum and substance, to โkeep movingโ or โmove along.โ \n232.  In one specific instance, Ms. Mills-Dirlam told an officer that covering his badge \nnumber was in appropriate, but he responded by saying in sum and substance to โkeep it \nmovingโ and he further covering his badge with his hand. \n233.  In response, the NYPD member told Ms. Mills-Dirlamโs in sum and substance to \nโkeep it movingโ and he further covered his badge with his hand. \n234.  And Mx. Hernandez (who was also present) asked, in sum and substance, โis it \nlegal to cover your badge number?โ that NYPD member told both of them, in effect, โyou need \nto move along.โ \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 42 of 79\n235.  After the Mott Haven Kettle was formed, Mx. Hernandez was on the south \nsidewalk between Brook Avenue and Brown Place when they saw an NYPD member grab \nPlaintiff Sarah Mills-Dirlam from the sidewalk and drag her into the street.  \n236.  Mx. Hernandez began screaming to ask Ms. Mills-Dirlam for her last name.  \n237.  However, at that time, Defendant NYPD Supervisor John Doe 97, who was \nwearing a NYPD uniform with a white shirt, grabbed Mx. Hernandez forcefully, and pulled them \ninto around the middle of the roadway, saying in sum and substance, โNo, youโre going too!โ \n238.  In the roadway, Defendant Doe 97 grabbed Mx. Hernandez on the shoulder and \narm and pushed Mx. Hernandez at a group of officers in blue shirts and riot gear helmets.  \n239.  Video if this part of Mx. Hernandezโs arrest can be viewed here: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLn2iy-ia24&t=1s and was published on June 8, 2020 by \nGothamist.  \n240.  Defendant NYPD Member John Doe 98 grabbed Mx. Hernandezโs left arm.  \n241.  Mx. Hernandez was holding the NLG-NYC Attestation of Essential Services in \ntheir right hand.  \n242.  Mx. Hernandez repeatedly informed the officers around them that they were an \nessential worker, and tried to show the officers the paperwork.  \n243.  Defendant NYPD Member John Doe 99, who seemed to be trying to knock the \npapers out of their hands, grabbed Mx. Hernandezโs right arm.  \n244.  Some of the papers dropped.  \n245.  Then, without warning, Defendant Doe 99, who had grabbed Mx. Hernandezโs \nright arm, roughly threw them from a full standing position, face-first onto the ground.  \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 43 of 79\n246.  Mx. Hernandezโs right shoulder hit the ground first, then their right arm and then \nrest of their body, causing pain and bruises on Mx. Hernandezโs right shoulder, arm, and knee. \n247.  The throw also caused some of Mx. Hernandezโs property to fall out of their \nfanny pack. \n248.  As Mx. Hernandez was face-down on the ground, Defendant Doe 98 and/or 99 \nthen placed excessively tight plastic flex-cuffs on Mx. Hernandezโs wrists, causing pain and \nbruises on Mx. Hernandezโs wrists. \n249.  Mx. Hernandez repeatedly told Defendants Does 97-99 they were an essential \nworker and attempted to show them the NLG-NYC Attestation of Essential Services they had in \ntheir hand.  \n250.  Nevertheless, Defendants Does 97-99 detained and arrested Mx. Hernandez \nwithout consent, probable cause, or lawful justification.  \n251.  After a period of time, NYPD members gathered up some of the Legal Observers \nโ eventually including Plaintiffs Hernandez, Santus, Zech, Horton, Gilbert, Mills-Dirlam, Chiel, \nand Leinbach โ that had been arrested, and placed first in a group forced to sit on the ground, \nthen in two lines facing a car and houses along Brook Avenue.  \n252.  Defendant NYPD Member Jane Doe 100 then unlawfully searched Mx. \nHernandezโs person and seized Mx. Hernandezโs property, including, but not limited to, Mx. \nHernandezโs identification, which NYPD members took a photograph of and/or otherwise \ndocumented information from.  \n253.  Defendant NYPD Supervisor John Doe 101 then told the Legal Observers, in \nsubstance, that they would be released and would have โone chanceโ to โgo home.โ  \n254.  He also said, in substance, that they would not get another chance. \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 44 of 79\n255.  Ms. Mills-Dirlam asked, in substance, โWhat if we donโt?โ \n256.  Another Legal Observer also responded with words to the effect of, โbecause you \ndonโt want us to see what youโre doing here right now?โ \n257.  Defendant NYPD Supervisor John Doe 101 replied to both of them, in substance, \nโYou know, never mind, donโt let them go.โ \n258.  After an extended period of time, during which time Mx. Hernandez remained in \nhandcuffs, Doe 101 cut off the handcuffs and released Mx. Hernandez. \n259.  At some point during Mx. Hernandezโs detention, officers removed their mask, \nand did not replace it. \n260.  NYPD Member John or Jane Doe 102 then told Mx. Hernandez words to the \neffect that they should go home and they would not get a second chance. \n261.  Defendants NYPD Strategic Response Group Officers John and/or Jane Does \n103-106 later told Mx. Hernandez to move down the block. \n262.  Mx. Hernandez continues to experience increased anxiety and fear as a result of \nthis incident. \n263.  Because of that fear and anxiety, Mx. Hernandez has acted as a Legal Observer at \nfewer protests since June 4, 2020.  \nPlaintiff Jonathan Davis \n264.  Plaintiff Jonathan Davis is a 68-year-old graduate of Rutgers Law School, who \nworks as a safety environmental consultant. \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 45 of 79\n265.  At all times relevant herein, Mr. Davis was clearly identified as an NLG-NYC \nLegal Observer, in that Mr. Davis was wearing a bright neon green hat, as well as a badge on a \nlanyard, which prominently features the NLG-NYC logo and the words โLEGAL OBSERVER.โ  \n266.  At all times relevant to herein, Mr. Davis had an NLG-NYC Attestation of \nEssential Services printed on NLG-NYC letterhead in his possession.  \n267.  Prior to 8 p.m., Mr. Davis observed NYPD members kettle protesters at Mott \nHaven.  \n268.  Mr. Davis heard a dispersal order โ after the group of protesters and legal \nobservers were fully blocked in and unable to leave โ at approximately 7:58 p.m. \n269.  Nobody could have complied with that order because of the kettle.  \n270.  Believing that police were about to make mass arrests, Mr. Davis started to write \ndown the names and birthdates of the trapped demonstrators. \n271.  As Mr. Davis attempted to perform this work as a Legal Observer, Defendants \nRabel and Does 107-108 rear-cuffed him with plastic flex-cuffs and led him to the side of 136th \nStreet near Brown Place.  \n272.  Mr. Davis was among the first five or six people near him to be placed in flex \ncuffs. \n273.  Defendants Does 107 and/or 108 unlawfully searched Mr. Davisโs person and \nbag. \n274.  Mr. Davis repeatedly told the many NYPD members near him, including \nDefendants Rabel and Does 107-108, that he was a Legal Observer, that he was an essential \nworker, and that he had documentation with him to that effect.  \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 46 of 79\n275.  About five minutes about being zip-tied and forced to stand in the street, Mr. \nDavis began to feel dizzy. \n276.  Mr. Davis continued to repeat that he was a Legal Observer and that he had \npaperwork from the National Lawyers Guild with him. \n277.  He attempted to explain this to every white-shirt that walked by for approximately \n20-30 minutes.  \n278.  After that approximately 20-30 minutes, a NYPD Deputy Chief believed to be \nJohn DโAdamo, or possibly a male NYPD Chief or Deputy Chief John Doe 109 who was \nstanding next to a NYPD supervisor in a uniform wearing a white shirt and the name \nโDโAdamoโ on his nameplate, approached Mr. Davis, who was still cuffed and in Rabelโs \ncustody, and instructed Rabel to โcut him loose.โ  \n279.  Within the hour, Defendant Doe 110 threatened Mr. Davis with re-arrest for being \npresent and continuing legal observing.  \n280.  In addition to other injuries, this experience was traumatic for Mr. Davis, and he \nnow has an increased fear of the police.  \nPlaintiff Sarah Mills-Dirlam \n281.  Plaintiff Sarah Mills-Dirlam is an attorney, who works for a continuing legal \neducation provider, where she manages all of the programming. \n282.  At all times relevant herein, Ms. Mills-Dirlam was clearly identified as an NLG-\nNYC Legal Observer, in that she was wearing a bright neon green hat, which prominently \nfeatures the NLG-NYC logo and the words โLEGAL OBSERVER.โ  \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 47 of 79\n283.  At all times relevant herein, Ms. Mills-Dirlam had an NLG-NYC Attestation of \nEssential Services printed on NLG-NYC letterhead in her possession.  \n284.  As described above, Ms. Mills-Dirlam was partnered with Mx. Hernandez prior to \nthe Mott Haven Kettle.   \n285.  Later, and after the Mott Haven Kettle was formed, as Ms. Mills-Dirlam was \nattempting to collect the names of arrestees, Defendant NYPD Supervisor John Doe 111, a \nwhite, male NYPD supervisor in an NYPD uniform with a white shirt, grabbed Ms. Mills-Dirlam \nfrom behind, hard, by her shoulders.  \n286.  He then grabbed Ms. Mills-Dirlam by the wrists and moved her off the sidewalk, \nto the center of the street.  \n287.  He then restrained Ms. Mills-Dirlamโs arms behind her back with plastic flex \ncuffs.  \n288.  Defendant Doe 111 tore Ms. Mills-Dirlamโs Legal Observer notes, which are \nprivileged under the Attorney Work Product Doctrine, from Ms. Mills-Dirlam, and threw them \non the ground.  \n289.  Ms. Mills-Dirlam said, in substance, โThatโs privileged attorney work product.โ    \n290.  Ms. Mills-Dirlamโs notes were not retrieved or returned. \n291.  Defendant Doe 111 led Ms. Mills-Dirlamโs down a hill and pushed her to her \nknees. \n292.  Defendant NYPD Member John Doe 112 later took custody of Ms. Mills-Dirlam.  \n293.  Defendant Doe 112 put Ms. Mills Dirlam in a line with a large number of other \nLegal Observers, all wearing neon green hats.   \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 48 of 79\n294.  Defendant NYPD Member Jane Doe 113, a female wearing a NYPD uniform, \nsearched and seized Ms. Mills-Dirlam and seized Ms. Mills-Dirlamโs identification, which Doe \n84 or another NYPD member took a photograph of and/or otherwise documented information \nfrom. \n295.  Defendant NYPD Supervisor John Doe 114 turned Ms. Mills-Dirlam around to \nface him when he gave the โone chanceโ warning described above.   \n296.  After an extended period of time, Defendant NYPD Member John Doe 115 \nreleased Ms. Mills-Dirlam from the flex cuffs and from police custody. \n297.  In the week following the incident, NYPD attorneys and attorneys from the Bronx \nCounty DA both visited Ms. Mills-Dirlamโs LinkedIn profile.  \n298.  Because of this incident, Ms. Mills-Dirlam has not acted as a Legal Observer \nsince and she is afraid to go to large protests. \nPlaintiff Natalie Baker  \n299.  Plaintiff Natalie Baker is a graduate of the City University of New York School of \nLaw. \n300.  Ms. Baker did not have her neon green hat that day, but did have the badge and \nlanyard clearly identifying her as a Legal Observer.  \n301.  At or around 7:16 p.m., an NYPD Community Affairs officer approached Ms. \nBaker. \n302.  The Community Affairs Officer repeatedly asked questions to the effect of, โhave \nyou advised the protesters to disperse before 8:00 p.m.?โ  \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 49 of 79\n303.  Ms. Baker informed the officer that Legal Observers do not provide legal advice, \nand their only role at a protest is to observe and document what happens. \n304.  The officer continuously repeated the same question, acting as if she had not \nheard the answers. \n305.  This repetitive questioning lasted for between 3 and 5 minutes.  \n306.  After the Mott Haven Kettle formed, Ms. Baker did not hear a dispersal order โ \nbut she could not have left if she did.  \n307.  There were no names, shields, shield numbers, or other identifying information \nMs. Baker could see on the officers blocking 136th Street. \n308.  Ms. Baker began asking those officers for their badge numbers at approximately \n8:01 p.m. \n309.  Only one officer responded at all, by saying โ323.โ \n310.  Every other officer did not even acknowledge the question โ even when Ms. \nBaker stated she was a Legal Observer and showed her badge. \n311.  Ms. Baker took notes as she observed NYPD members trap protesters, and then \npush and hit the trapped protesters, including with their batons.  \n312.  Ms. Baker was crouched down on the sidewalk attempting to write down the \nnames of some younger people who she thought might be arrested. \n313.  Without warning, Defendant NYPD Member John Doe 116, a male, uniformed \nNYPD member, grabbed Ms. Baker from behind. \n314.   Defendant Doe 116 pushed Ms. Bakerโs purple notebook in which she had been \ntaking Legal Observer notes out of her hands while pulling her arms behind her. \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 50 of 79\n315.   Defendant Doe 116 then cuffed Ms. Baker with plastic zip ties, and pushed her \ntoward a group of handcuffed arrestees.  \n316.  Defendant Doe 116 left Ms. Bakerโs notebook, in which she had been taking \nLegal Observer notes, on the ground where Doe 116 had first grabbed her.  \n317.  Ms. Baker was forced to sit in the road with other arrestees for approximately 15 \nminutes before she and the other legal observers were lined up, as described above. \n318.  NYPD Member John Doe 117 unlawfully searched Ms. Bakerโs person and seized \nmore of her property, to wit, Ms. Bakerโs identification, which NYPD members took a \nphotograph of and/or otherwise documented information from.  \n319.  At Ms. Bakerโs request, Doe 117 retrieved her notebook from the location at \nwhich Doe 82 had first grabbed her. \n320.  After an extended period of time, during which Ms. Baker remained in handcuffs, \nNYPD Member John or Jane Doe 118 cut off the handcuffs and released her. \n321.  Later, as Ms. Baker was attempting to record the names of arrestees who were \nbeing loaded into a van from a safe distance away, NYPD Member John Doe 119 shouted \nangrily, ordering Ms. Baker to โMOVE BACK!โ until she was at least 15โ away from the people \nbeing placed into the van โ a distance too far to communicate with them to get their names. \n322.  Later, NYPD Members John  and Jane Does 120-126 started instructing Ms. \nBaker and other Legal Observers to move back along the sidewalk, and then walked toward Ms. \nBaker and the other LOโs with their arms out, forcing them back as they advanced, until they \nwere so far away that they could no longer interact with the detained people. \n323.  Ms. Baker suffered worsened depression and anxiety because of this incident.  \nPlaintiff Ethan Chiel \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 51 of 79\n324.  Plaintiff Ethan Chiel is a law student at CUNY School of Law. \n \n325.  At all times relevant herein, Mr. Chiel was clearly identified as a NLG-NYC \nLegal Observer, in that he was wearing a bright neon green hat, as well as a badge on a lanyard, \nwhich prominently feature the NLG-NYC logo and the words โLEGAL OBSERVER.โ  \n326.  At all times relevant herein, Mr. Chiel had an NLG-NYC Attestation of Essential \nServices printed on NLG-NYC letterhead in Claimantโs possession. \n327.  As Mr. Chiel attempted to perform his work as a Legal Observer by recording the \nnames of arrestees, Defendant NYPD Supervisor John Doe 127, a white, male NYPD supervisor \nwith reddish hair in a NYPD uniform with a white shirt, grabbed Mr. Chielโs arm and told him to \nget back, which was not physically possible at that time.  \n328.  When Mr. Chiel responded something to the effect of, โIโm a Legal Observer,โ \nDefendant Supervisor Doe 127 began grabbing at Mr. Chielโs Legal Observer notebook, and in \nthe process tore a number of pages out, including all of Mr. Chielโs privileged work product \nnotes contained in the notebook.  \n329.  Defendant Doe 127 and at least 3 Defendant John Doe NYPD members โ Does \n128-130 โ then grabbed Mr. Chiel and began yanking him, knocking his notebook out of his \nhand. \n330.  Defendant Does 127-130 pulled Mr. Chiel towards them and through the police \nline, and threw him onto the ground, causing a 1.5-2 inch cut on Mr. Chielโs left elbow and \ninjury to his right leg.  \n331.  One of Defendant Does 127-130 rear-cuffed Mr. Chiel with tight, plastic flex-\ncuffs. \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 52 of 79\n332.  Defendant Doe 131 then unlawfully searched Mr. Chielโs person and seized \nClaimantโs property, including, but not limited to, Claimantโs identification, which Doe 131 or \nanother NYPD member took a photograph of and/or otherwise documented information from. \n333.  After an extended period of time, during which Claimant remained in handcuffs, a \nNYPD member, Defendant Doe 132, cut off the handcuffs and released Claimant.  \n334.  Defendant Doe 132 then told Mr. Chiel in sum that he should leave the area.  \n335.  Another NYPD member also told Mr. Chiel that he had to leave the area.  \n336.  Mr. Chiel walked back to where he had been arrested and found his notebook, but \nthe privileged work product notes that had been torn out were missing.  \n337.  In addition to the injuries discussed above, Mr. Chiel suffered additional injuries, \nincluding increased anxiety. \nPlaintiff Kyla Raskin \n338.  Plaintiff Kyla Raskin is a law student at the City University of New York School \nof Law. \n339.  At all times relevant herein, Ms. Raskin was clearly identified as a NLG-NYC \nLegal Observer, in that she was wearing a bright neon green hat, as well as a badge on a lanyard, \nwhich prominently feature the NLG-NYC logo and the words โLEGAL OBSERVER.โ  \n340.  At all times relevant to Ms. Raskinโs claim, she had an NLG-NYC Attestation of \nEssential Services printed on NLG-NYC letterhead in her possession.  \n341.  Earlier in the evening, an NYPD member in an unmarked vehicle put his head out \nthe car window and said in sum and substance, โLegal Observer, do you have any Molotov \ncocktails?โ \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 53 of 79\n342.  Later, NYPD members trapped Ms. Raskin in the Mott Haven Kettle, and began \nviolently arresting people near Ms. Raskin.  \n343.  As Ms. Raskin attempted to write down the names of arrestees, Defendant NYPD \nMember John Doe 133, a male officer in a blue NYPD uniform with a riot gear helmet on, and \nother NYPD members, pushed Ms. Raskin and others down the block, away from the violent \narrests.  \n344.  Ms. Raskin suffered bruising to the back of her arm from being pushed. \n345.  Because Defendant Doe 133 and NYPD members forced Ms. Raskin away from \nthe vicinity of the arrests, Ms. Raskin was hindered in her ability to perform her work as a Legal \nObserver. \n346.  This incident effected Ms. Raskinโs feelings of safety, and made it difficult to \nleave her apartment or attend protests. \nPlaintiff David Holton \n347.  Plaintiff David Holton is a law student at the City University of New York Law \nSchool. \n348.  At all times relevant herein, Mr. Holton was clearly identified as a NLG-NYC \nLegal Observer, in that he was wearing a bright neon green hat, as well as a badge on a lanyard, \nwhich prominently feature the NLG-NYC logo and the words โLEGAL OBSERVER.โ  \n349.  At all times relevant to herein, Mr. Holton had an NLG-NYC Attestation of \nEssential Services printed on NLG-NYC letterhead in Claimantโs possession.  \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 54 of 79\n350.  Once the Mott Haven Kettle formed, without warning, Defendant NYPD \nSupervisor John Doe 134 (a white-shirt, who was a white man in, upon information and belief, \nhis 40โs) grabbed Mr. Holton and pulled him into a crowd of police.  \n351.  Defendant Doe 134 put Mr. Holton into a headlock.  \n352.  Defendant Doe 134 knocked Mr. Holtonโs NLG-NYC Legal Observer hat off his \nhead. \n353.  Defendant NYPD Member John or Jane Doe 135 then put excessively tight, \nplastic handcuffs on Mr. Holton.  \n354.  Defendant NYPD Member John or Jane Doe 136 then seized Mr. Holtonโs phone \nand Legal Observer notes.  \n355.  Mr. Holtonโs phone was eventually returned. \n356.  Defendant NYPD Member John or Jane Doe 137 later came over to Mr. Holton \nand moved Mr. Holton to another location within police custody.  \n357.  Eventually, Defendant Doe 158 removed Mr. Holtonโs handcuffs and released \nhim. \n358.  Mr. Holton eventually retrieved his Legal Observer hat and notes from non-\nNYPD members who had found them. \n359.  Eventually, NYPD members told Mr. Holton that he had to leave the area.  \n360.  He was thus prevented from continuing to engage in acting as a Legal Observer.  \nPlaintiff Rafael-Lev E. Gilbert \n \n \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 55 of 79\n361.  Plaintiff Rafael-Lev E. Gilbert is a law student at the City University of New \nYork School of Law. \n362.  At all times relevant herein Mr. Gilbert was clearly identified as a NLG-NYC \nLegal Observer, in that he was wearing a bright neon green hat, as well as a badge on a lanyard, \nwhich prominently feature the NLG-NYC logo and the words โLEGAL OBSERVER.โ  \n363.  At all times relevant to herein, Mr. Gilbert had an NLG-NYC Attestation of \nEssential Services printed on NLG-NYC letterhead in Claimantโs possession.  \n364.  Mr. Gilbert was trapped in the Mott Haven Kettle.  \n365.  Around 8 p.m., Defendant NYPD Member John Doe 138, a male uniformed \nofficer, grabbed Mr. Gilbert by his right shoulder and right harm, twisted his right arm behind his \nback, shoved Mr. Gilbert hard into the side of a parked car, and held his head against the car.  \n366.  Defendant Doe 138 then applied plastic handcuffs to Mr. Gilbertโs wrists with \nextreme tightness, such that Mr. Gilbert soon lost feeling in his hands and he suffered soreness in \nhis wrists. \n367.  NYPD members took Mr. Gilbert, whose backpack was hanging from his cuffed \nhands, to an area with other arrestees, where NYPD members pushed Mr. Gilbert into a seated \nposition. \n368.  After approximately twenty minutes, NYPD members walked Mr. Gilbert away \nfrom the arrestees and held him against a parked car. \n369.  Mr. Gilbert was then taken and forced into a sitting position in the street with a \nnumber of other arrestees (including both Legal Observers and non-Legal Observers).  \n370.  At that point, an unknown officer said, in sum and substance, โis that all the green \nhats?โ \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 56 of 79\n371.  NYPD members, including Defendant Doe 139, unlawfully searched Mr. \nGilbertโs person and seized Mr. Gilbertโs property, including, but not limited to, by reaching into \nMr. Gilbertโs pants pocket and removing his identification, which NYPD members took a \nphotograph of and/or otherwise documented information from. \n372.  After an extended period of time, during which Mr. Gilbert remained in \nhandcuffs, Doe 139 cut off the handcuffs and released him. \n373.  The officers instructed Mr. Gilbert to stay away from the seated protesters โ \nmaking it impossible to properly perform the tasks he was supposed to as a Legal Observer.  \n374.  Following this incident, Mr. Gilbert had trouble sleeping and increased anxiety, \nwhich caused him to miss about one week of law school. \n375.  Mr. Gilbert has gone to far fewer protests since this incident. \nPlaintiff August Leinbach \n376.  Plaintiff August Leinbach is a law student at Columbia Law School. \n377.  At all times relevant herein, Mr. Leinbach was clearly identified as a NLG-NYC \nLegal Observer, in that he was wearing a bright neon green hat, as well as a badge on a lanyard, \nwhich prominently feature the NLG-NYC logo and the words โLEGAL OBSERVER.โ  \n378.  At all times relevant herein, Mr. Leinbach had an NLG-NYC Attestation of \nEssential Services printed on NLG-NYC letterhead in his possession.  \n379.  As Mr. Leinbach was performing his duties as a Legal Observer, Defendant \nNYPD Supervisor First Name Unknown (โFNUโ) Hyland, a white male in an NYPD uniform \nwith a white shirt, repeatedly shoved Mr. Leinbach and told him to leave.  \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 57 of 79\n380.  Defendant Hyland and/or NYPD Member John Doe 148 then pushed Mr. \nLeinbach up against a car and applied plastic handcuffs to Mr. Leinbachโs wrists with extreme \ntightness.   \n381.  In the process, Defendant Hyland and/or Doe 140 either dropped or caused Mr. \nLeinbachโs Legal Observer notes to fall to the sidewalk, and made no attempt to recover them for \nhim - though Mr. Leinbach was able to locate his notes after he was released from custody later.  \n382.  Mr. Leinbach repeatedly told the NYPD members present that he was a Legal \nObserver, and that he was an essential worker. \n383.  Eventually, Mr. Leinbach was lined up with a number of other Legal Observers, \nas described above.  \n384.  NYPD members, including Defendant Doe 141, unlawfully searched Mr. \nLeinbachโs person and seized his property, including, but not limited to, Mr. Leinbachโs \nidentification and debit card, which NYPD members took a photograph of and/or otherwise \ndocumented information from.    \n385.  After an extended period of time, during which Mr. Leinbach remained in \nhandcuffs, Defendant Doe 142 cut off the handcuffs and released him. \n386.  Mr. Leinbach know feels much more nervous around police officers, particularly \nat protests. \nPlaintiff Roxanne Zech \n387.  Plaintiff Roxanne Zech is law student at CUNY School of Law. \n388.  At all times relevant herein, Plaintiff Zech was clearly identified as a NLG-NYC \nLegal Observer, in that Plaintiff Zech was wearing a bright neon green hat, as well as a badge on \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 58 of 79\na lanyard, which prominently feature the NLG-NYC logo and the words โLEGAL \nOBSERVER.โ  \n389.  At all times relevant herein, Plaintiff Zech had an NLG-NYC Attestation of \nEssential Services printed on NLG-NYC letterhead in Claimantโs possession.  \n390.  While Defendant Doe 143 shoved Plaintiff Zechโs neck and head onto a car, \nDefendant Doe 144 roughly grabbed and twisted Plaintiff Zechโs arms. \n391.  Plaintiff Zech yelled out in pain. \n392.  An officer, upon information and belief, one of Does 144 or 145, said in sum and \nsubstance, โyour arm is being twisted, thatโs why it hurts.โ \n393.   Defendants Does 144 and 145 put Plaintiff Zechโs wrists in plastic flex-cuffs that \nwere excessively tight.  \n394.  In the course of grabbing Plaintiff Zech and shoving them against the car in that \nmanner, one or more of Defendants Does 143-145 caused Plaintiff Zechโs notebook containing \ntheir Legal Observer notes to fall to the ground.  \n395.  Plaintiff Zech attempted to tell officers that they were a Legal Observer, and that \nthe Mayor had confirmed that Legal Observers were essential workers permitted to be out past \ncurfew. \n396.  However, one officer dismissively told them, โgood for you.โ \n397.  Eventually, Plaintiff Zech was brought into the Legal Observer line-up described \nabove.  \n398.  NYPD members, including NYPD Member John or Jane Doe 146, unlawfully \nsearched Plaintiff Zechโs person and seized their property, including, but not limited to, Plaintiff \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 59 of 79\nZechโs identification, which NYPD members took a photograph of and/or otherwise documented \ninformation from.  \n399.  After an extended period of time, during which Plaintiff Zech remained in \nhandcuffs, NYPD Member John Doe 146 cut off the handcuffs and released them.  \n400.  Defendant Doe 146 told Plaintiff Zech in substance that the Legal Observers \ncould not stay there and were to walk in the opposite direction, leave the vicinity, and not come \nback. \n401.  Since this incident, Plaintiff Zechโs anxiety has greatly increased, and they \nexperienced trouble sleeping and eating. \nPlaintiff Jalen Matney \n402.  Plaintiff Jalen Matney is a graduate of โ and at the time at issue, was a law \nstudent at โ the City University of New York School of Law. \n403.  At all times relevant herein, Mr. Matney was clearly identified as a NLG-NYC \nLegal Observer, in that he was wearing a bright neon green hat, as well as a badge on a lanyard, \nwhich prominently feature the NLG-NYC logo and the words โLEGAL OBSERVER.โ  \n404.  At all times relevant to Mr. Matneyโs claim, he had an NLG-NYC Attestation of \nEssential Services printed on NLG-NYC letterhead in his possession.  \n405.  Mr. Matney was trapped in the Mott Haven kettle.  \n406.  Mr. Matney was initially grabbed without warning by a blue-uniformed NYPD \nMember , Defendant John Doe 147, and possibly another or other officers.  \n407.  Defendant Doe 147 and/or Defendants NYPD Member s John or Jane Does 148-\n149 pulled Mr. Matneyโs hands behind his back and began grabbing onto Mr. Matney. \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 60 of 79\n408.  Defendant NYPD Member John Doe 149, a blue-shirted, male officer, punched \nMr. Matney in the face as Defendants NYPD Members John Does 150, 151, and/or others threw \nMr. Matney to the ground and stomped on Mr. Matneyโs legs, calves, and back.  \n409.  In the process, Mr. Matneyโs NLG-NYC Legal Observer hat and his facemask \nwere knocked off. \n410.  One or more of Defendant Does 147-151 applied plastic handcuffs to Mr. \nMatneyโs wrists with extreme tightness, such that he felt his left hand begin to go numb after a \nfew minutes.  \n411.  One or more of Defendant Does 82-86 yelled at Mr. Matney to โget the fuck up \nright now!โ \n412.  When Mr. Matney asked, โhow?,โ one of Defendant Does 147-151 quickly jerked \nMr. Matney up by the arms and into the street, pulled Mr. Matney by the arm down the hill, and \npushed him toward the ground in an area wither other handcuffed arrestees. \n413.  Although Mr. Matney complained about the excessive tightness of the handcuffs \nto NYPD members, they did not take any steps to alleviate the excessive tightness of the \nhandcuffs until after he was forced to endure the excessively tight handcuffs for an extended \nperiod of time.   \n414.  Defendant NYPD Member John Doe 152 unlawfully searched Mr. Matneyโs \nperson and seized his property, including, but not limited to, his identification, which NYPD \nmembers took a photograph of and/or otherwise documented information from.    \n415.  After an extended period of time, during which Mr. Matney remained in \nhandcuffs, a NYPD member, Doe 153, cut off the handcuffs and released him. \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 61 of 79\n416.  After Mr. Matneyโs release, he retrieved his NLG-NYC Legal Observer hat from \nthe street.  \n417.  NYPD members continued to interfere with Mr. Matneyโs Legal Observing \nduties. \n418.  Defendant NYPD Member John or Jane Doe 154 directed Mr. Matney to step \naway from protestors that were cuffed and kneeling as he tried to lean in to get their names. \n419.   Defendant Doe 155 ordered Mr. Matney to stop his legal observing activities and \nleave because it was past curfew. \n420.   Defendants John Does 156 and 157, and possibly other NYPD members, ordered \nClaimant to walk to the end of the block away from the protestors.  \n421.  This incident traumatized Mr. Matney, who as acted as a Legal Observer far \nfewer protests afterwards. \nH. Defendantsโ de Blasioโs, Sheaโs, Monahanโs, Hartโs, and Lehrโs Ratifications of \ntheir Subordinatesโ Misconduct and Failures to Monitor, Supervise, Monitor, and \nDiscipline NYPD Members Regarding the NYPD FTP4 Protest Response and the \nLegal Observer Arrests. \n422.  Although defendants City, Shea, Monahan, Hart, Lehr and other policymakers \nactually knew, or should have known, that NYPD members were engaging in or had engaged in \nthe unconstitutional and unlawful conduct complained of herein, they failed to monitor, \nsupervise, and/or discipline NYPD members who directed, engaged, or observed such conduct.  \n423.  For example, Defendants de Blasio and Shea made public statements on social \nmedia and in the media indicating they had knowledge of events related to violence and mass \narrests at the protests as they were unfolding, and, of course, a wealth of video and other \nevidence was widely available online. \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 62 of 79\n424.  With respect to Plaintiffs in particular, images of NYPD officers arresting NLG-\nNYC Legal Observers began to circulate online almost immediately. For example, on June 5, \n2020, Gothamist published a photograph of Plaintiff Zech being shoved against a car, under \narrest, clearly wearing her bright green NLG-NYC Legal Observer hat  23  \n425.  On June 7, 2020, the NLG-NYC sent a letter regarding โLegal Observer Targeting \nand Detentionsโ to Defendant Shea, copying a number of other officials, including the \nDefendants de Blasio and Hart; the New York City Corporation Counsel; the New York City \nPublic Advocate; and the New York State Attorney General. Plaintiffs incorporate the June 7, \n2020 NLG-NYC letter by reference, and a copy is attached hereto.24   \n426.  In that June 7, 2020 letter, the NLG-NYC โcondemn[ed]โ the NYPDโs โunlawful \ntargeting and detention ofโฆtrained and clearly identifiedโ NLG-NYC Legal Observers on June \n4, 2020 in the Bronx.  \n427.  The NLG-NYC also identified the NYPD Legal Bureau attorney and described \nhow he verbally authorized the arrests of NLG-NYC Legal Observers and pointed toward NLG-\nNYC Legal Observers, after which NYPD officers grabbed and handcuffed NLG-NYC Legal \nObservers.  \n428.  Finally, the NLG-NYC letter demanded that the NYPD: โ(1) remind all NYPD \nofficers of the status and role of Legal Observers via a FINEST message and citywide \ndepartment announcements to be made at roll calls in the presence of all working officers; and \n(2) discipline those officers, including the NYPD Legal Bureau officers present, who supervised, \n \n23 See, e.g., Jake Offenhartz, Nick Pinto, and Gwynne Hogan, โNYPDโs Ambush of Peaceful Bronx Protesters Was \nโExecuted Nearly Flawlessly,โ City Leaders Agree,โ Gothamist (June 5, 2020) available online at \nhttps://gothamist.com/news/nypds-ambush-of-peaceful-bronx-protesters-was-executed-nearly-flawlessly-city-\nleaders-agree.  \n24 A copy of the letter is available online at: https://www.scribd.com/document/464875743/2020-6-7-Nlgnyc-Lo-\nLetter-Final-Ocr-730pm.   \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 63 of 79\nand were otherwise involved in, detaining and searching the LOโs and violating the \nconfidentiality of their LO notes.โ \n429.  The June 7, 2020 NLG-NYC letter resulted in press coverage by Gothamist25 and \nThe New York Law Journal26 โ but no response to the NLG-NYC from Defendants Shea, Hart, \nor anyone else.  \n430.  Upon information and belief, to this date, there has been no response from any of \nthe Defendants, or any representative of Defendant City, to the June 7, 2020 NLG-NYC letter. \n431.  On June 17, 2020, the New York City Bar Association (the โCity Barโ) issued a \nโStatement on Detention of Legal Observersโ (the โCity Bar Statementโ). A copy of the City Bar \nStatement is attached hereto and incorporated by reference.27  \n432.  In the City Bar Statement, the City Bar said it was โgravely concerned by recent \nreports in the United States of concerted efforts by police forces to target legal observersโ, \nfocusing on the facts surrounding the June 4, 2020 detentions and arrests of the NLG-NYC LOs \nin the Bronx while noting that โ[t]he targeting of legal observers by police is also occurring \noutside New Yorkโ. The City Bar Statement concluded: \nThe fact that legal observers have become targets for the police indicates that \npolicing strategies in these communities have failed. First, these attacks \n[against Legal Observers] suggest a failure to adequately train police serving \non crowd control details to identify legal observers who are monitoring \nprotests as non-targets.  Second, the systematic targeting of legal observers \ncontributes to a growing concern that recent police actions are entirely \ndisproportionate to officersโ narrow duties to maintain security while honoring \nthe First Amendment rights of protesters.  Third, and most egregiously, the \n \n25 See Jake Offenhartz, โโRound Up The Green Hatsโ: NYPD Accused Of Deliberately Targeting Legal Observers In \nBrutal Bronx Mass Arrestโ, Gothamist (June 8, 2020), available online at  https://gothamist.com/news/round-green-\nhats-nypd-accused-deliberately-targeting-legal-observers-brutal-bronx-mass-arrest. \n26 See Jane Wester, โLetter Demands NYPD Discipline After Legal Observers Were Detained, Illegally Searched \nDuring Bronx Protest,โ The New York Law Journal (June 8, 2020), available online at \nhttps://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2020/06/08/letter-demands-nypd-discipline-after-legal-observers-were-\ndetained-illegally-searched-during-bronx-protest/. \n27 A copy of the Statement on Detention of Legal Observers is also available online at \nhttps://www.nycbar.org/media-listing/media/detail/statement-on-detention-of-legal-observers.  \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 64 of 79\nreports of police warnings that legal observers are in the area, the subsequent \ntargeting and detention of those observers, and the forced disclosure of \nprivileged material indicates a startling disregard by police forces that their \nconduct is governed in our society by the rule of law. \n \nThe City Bar strongly condemns all attacks on legal observers and urges state \nand local governments, police chiefs, and police unions both to advise their \nofficers that attacks on legal observers are not tolerated, and also to swiftly \ninvestigate any incident involving the detention or use of force against a legal \nobserver, and where warranted, prosecute offenders.  As protests and other \ndemonstrations continue, the City Bar specifically calls on Mayor Bill de \nBlasio and Police Commissioner Dermot Shea to immediately investigate the \nincident in the Bronx, and for all officers in the NYPD to be made aware that \nthe consequences of any illegal targeting of legal observers by police will be \nswift and severe, including appropriate disciplinary charges and criminal \nprosecution.   \n \n433.  The June 17, 2020 City Bar Statement resulted in press coverage The New York \nLaw Journal28 but no response from Defendants Shea, Hart, or anyone else.  \n434.  Upon information and belief, to this date, there has been no response from any of \nthe Defendants, or any representative of Defendant City, to the June 17, 2020 City Bar \nStatement. \n435.  Each of the 12 Plaintiffs made written statements related to their June 4, 2020 \nexperiences, copies of which are collectively attached hereto and incorporated by reference. \n436.  Each Plaintiff provided those written statements to, and made oral statements to,  \nthe New York Civilian Complaint Review Board (โCCRBโ) and the Office of the Attorney \nGeneral (โOAGโ) as part of those agenciesโ investigations into the events of June 4, 2020 and the \nSummer 2020 Protests.   \n \n28 See Jane Wester, โCity Bar Calls For Investigation Following Arrests of Legal Observers During Bronx Protestsโ, \nThe New York Law Journal (June 17, 2020), available online at \nhttps://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2020/06/17/city-bar-calls-for-investigation-following-arrests-of-legal-\nobservers-during-bronx-protests/. \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 65 of 79\n437.  High-level policymakers for Defendant City, including Defendants de Blasio, \nShea, Monahan, and Hart, knew that those investigations were underway as early as June of 2020 \nโ yet, upon information and belief, they have not undertaken their own investigations, and have \nnot  \n438.  For example, during Defendant Sheaโs June 22, 2020 testimony in the OAGโs \ninvestigation regarding the NYPDโs policing of the Summer 2020 Protests, including the events \nof June 4, 2020, the following exchange occurred29:  \nAG James: There are also Legal Observers who were arrested as a result of this \nprotest. Is there not a directive from the mayor and or yourself to police officers \nthat legal observers and essential workers should not be arrested after the curfew? \nCommissioner Shea: Yeah, I would have to see how youโre defining Legal \nObservers, Iโm not sure what youโre referring to there.  \nAG James: There were individuals who were clearly, they had clearly marked on \ntheir caps, as well as on their shirts, that they were Legal Observers. Nonetheless \nthere is video, and some testified last week, that they were arrested, nonetheless. \nCommissioner Shea: Right, I would just point out to the board here that having a \nshirt or a hat that says Legal Observer, does not mean that person is an attorney, \ndoes that not mean [sic] that theyโre actually performing any legal function. We \ngo on the facts in front of us, and we had incidents of many people committing \ncrimes and violations, and we responded to those facts. \nAG James: So do you ever interview the individuals that you arrest to determine \nwhether or not in fact they are acting as a Legal Observer? \nCommissioner Shea: We have conversations with people literally non-stop \nthroughout the protest, and certainly during the arrest process, but thatโs after their \nrights are read to them so we will question them if itโs appropriate. \n \n29 See โAttorney General James Questions NYPD Commissioner Shea in Ongoing Investigation into Interactions \nBetween Police and the Publicโ at Minute 44:58 โ 46:30 (June 22, 2020), available online at  \nhttps://ag.ny.gov/NYPDtestimony; see also Jane Wester, โNYPD Commissioner Testifies Before AG James on \nProtest Response, Treatment of Legal Observers,โ The New York Law Journal (June 22, 2020), available online at  \nhttps://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2020/06/22/nypd-commissioner-testifies-before-ag-james-on-protest-\nresponse-treatment-of-legal-observers/. \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 66 of 79\n439.  On September 30, 2020, HRW published the HRW Report. \n440.  On October 2, 2020, Defendant de Blasio appeared on WNYCโs The Brian Lehrer \nShow: Ask the Mayor, and the following exchange occurred among Brian Lehrer, Plaintiff David \nHolton, and Defendant de Blasio: \nBrian Lehrer: David in White Plains. You're on WNYC with the mayor. Hello, \nDavid. \nDavid Holton: Hello, good morning. My name is David. I'm a law student in \nQueens. I'm a legal observer for the National Lawyers Guild. I'm calling about a \nprotest which I observed on June 4th in the Bronx when a large number of \nprotesters were arrested. Also, all the legal observers were arrested at the same \ntime. We've been calling this the Mott Haven Kettle. My question is related to the \ncurfew. At that time, you'll recall there was an 8:00 PM curfew. We, legal \nobservers, had documentation from the mayor's office, saying that we were \nessential workers. Now the NYPD is claiming that we were not essential workers \nand were thus out past curfew. My question is, who's right there? Were we \nessential workers or not? \nMayor de Blasio: Yes, you were. With all due respect to NYPD, the NYPD is \nwrong on this one. Legal observers-- Look, as someone who's protested a lot \nmyself over the years, there is a sacred role played by legal advisors. Excuse me, \nlegal observers. They need to be treated with deference. As you said, very \nimportant point you made, David. You had documentation proving you were legal \nobservers. That is an essential role. That is part of how we protect our democratic \nrights.30 \nIf someone didnโt have documentation, if their status was unclear, I can \nunderstand there could be some confusion, but a legal observer doing what a legal \nobserver is supposed to identify themselves and clarify their role, of course, \ntheyโre not supposed to be arrested. If, and God forbid someone committed a \nspecific crime, that's a different matter, obviously. If you're talking about their \nrole, observing, protecting peopleโs rights, of course, they're essential workers. Of \ncourse, they're not supposed to be arrested. \n441.

For example, according to the December 2020 DOI Report at pp. 43-44, \nDefendant Monahan stated that โthe NYPD Legal Bureauโ โ upon information and belief, \nDefendant Rice โ โmade the determination authorizing the arrests ofโ Plaintiffs and that when \nDefendant Monahan learned of the arrests, he claimed, โhe ordered their releaseโ: \nโLegal Observers, Medics, and Journalists. Numerous media reports, along with \nreports and letters from nongovernmental organizations, noted detentions and \narrests of legal observers, medical volunteers, and journalists during the Floyd \nprotests. While not the only instance of alleged interference with legal observers, \nthe NYPD response at Mott Haven resulted in the detention of legal observers, \nwho were reportedly zip tied and shoved to the street, when police executed mass \narrests for curfew violations. The Chief of Department stated during his interview \nthat staff from the NYPD Legal Bureau made the determination authorizing the \narrest of the legal observers. He also confirmed that when he learned of the arrests \nof legal observers, he ordered their release. The President of the National Lawyers \nGuild wrote letters arguing that the detention of legal observers violated the Patrol \nGuide and was contrary to assurances from City Hall staff that legal observers, as \nwell as medics, were exempt from the curfew. Elected officials also noted those \nprior assurances. In its written response, the NYPD stated that legal observers \nwere not within the scope of the Executive Orderโs โEssential Workersโ \nexemption from the curfew. Nonetheless, the purpose of legal observers is to \nmonitor protests for police activity that may infringe upon the civil rights of \nprotesters.โ31 \n443.

For example, in response to a direct question about whether Legal Observers were \nexempt from the Curfew Orders, Defendant Shea said: โI think that I think that legal observers \nwere mentioned in some of these orders. I canโt remember in what context right now. And again, \nyou know, this has caused some confusion. There are exemptions, but it does not exempt illegal \nconduct.โ33  \n445.  Then, asked whether Legal Observers โhave certain protection at protests, \nwhether or not there is a curfew,โ Defendant Shea said he โwould defer that to the lawyers, both \nin your house, City Hall, as well as our Legal Bureauโ but he could not answer the question.34 \n446.  Although he was โracking [his] brainโ he could not say whether there were any \nNYPD policies in place related to the presence of Legal Observers at events.35 \n447.  When the interviewer posed the same question another way, asking, โDoes the \nNYPD have specific protections for Legal Observers,โ Defendant Shea again did not answer the \nquestion, instead referring to some vague memory of a โsituationโ he claimed he โhad seenโ, \nstatting: โif there is a situation where they are arrested, what I have seen is, that they are \ncommitting violations under the guise of being, whether it is an essential worker or legal \nobservers or something along those lines.โ36 \n448.  According to a partial transcript of an interview Defendant Monahan gave to the \nDOI prior to December of 2020, Defendant Monahan repeatedly said that there were no NYPD \npolicies in place regarding Legal Observers and that Legal Observers โhad to obey the same laws \nthat everyone else didโ and โhad no special privilege.โ37 \n \n33 See Shea DOI Interview pp. 27-28. \n34 See Shea DOI Interview p. 35. \n35 See Shea DOI Interview p. 54. \n36 Id. \n37 See Margaret Garnett, Commissioner, The City of New York Department of Investigation, DOIโs interviews with \nNew York Police Chief of Department Terence Monahan conducted as part of DOIโs December 18, 2020, report \n68 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 69 of 79\n449.  According to Defendant Monahan's DOI testimony, โLegalโ gave the order to \nhave the Legal Observers arrested, and Plaintiffs โ who by then had been arrested and placed in \nhandcuffs - โwere going to be arrestedโ but then Defendant Monahan โmade the determination \nbased on past experience that utilizing discretion with Legal Observers would be appropriateโ so \nhe โordered that they all be released.โ38  \n450.  Additionally, Defendant Monahan testified, he โspoke to the Mayorโ at the scene \nof Plaintiffsโ arrests as well as โhisโ (Defendant de Blasioโs) โperson on the sceneโ and then told \nDefendant de Blasioโs โperson on the sceneโ that Defendant Monahan was โgoing to release all \ntheโ Legal Observers.39 \n451.  Defendantsโ June 4, 2020 mistreatment of Plaintiffs prevented them from \nperforming, and/or interfered with their abilities to perform, their functions as Legal Observers โ \nfor example, observing and documenting the police response - at the Mott Haven Protest. \n452.  Defendantsโ June 4, 2020 mistreatment of Plaintiffs prevented them from \nexercising, and/or interfered with their abilities to exercise, their rights to associate for the \npurposes of performing the functions of Legal Observers, at the Mott Haven Protest.  \n453.  And, although most Plaintiffs intend to act as volunteer Legal Observers in the \nfuture, Defendantsโ June 4, 2020 mistreatment of Plaintiffs cast and continues to cast a chill on \nPlaintiffsโ abilities and desires to act as Legal Observers in the future.  \n454.  As seen above, Defendants de Blasio, Shea, Monahan, Hart, Lehr, and other high-\nlevel NYPD policymaking officials knew about Plaintiffsโ arrests and other misconduct \ncommitted by NYPD members against Plaintiffs as part of the NYPDโs crackdown on the FTP4 \n \n(โMonahan DOI Interviewโ), available at \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doi/oignypd/response/ChiefofDepartment_TerenceMonahan.pdf, at pp. 46-47.   \n38 See Monahan DOI Interview pp. 80-83. \n39 See Monahan DOI Interview pp. 78-79. \n69 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-07406-UA   Document 1   Filed 09/02/21   Page 70 of 79\nProtest, but failed properly to train, supervise, investigate, or discipline their subordinates as a \nresult of that knowledge related to the requirements to give fair warning before taking certain \nenforcement actions such as making an arrest predicated on a purported violation of a dispersal \norder and probable cause to arrest observers, bystanders, and others who wish to see and/or \ndocument police operations in public spaces. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nUnlawful Seizure / False Arrest   \nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for Defendantsโ Violations of Plaintiffsโ Rights Under the \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution \n \n455.

In addition to being retaliatory, the restrictions Plaintiffs complained of herein \nthat Defendants imposed on Plaintiffsโ First Amendment rights to participate in, observe, and/or \nstand nearby speech, conduct, association, and/or other expressive activities protected by the \nFirst Amendment on the streets, were themselves regulations on Plaintiffsโ protected conduct \nthat: \na.
