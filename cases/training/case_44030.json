On May 7, 2021, two plaintiffs on behalf of a proposed class (every tenant in Annapolis public housing who is similarly situated), filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, with Judge Catherine C. Blake presiding. The plaintiffs sued the Housing Authority of the City of Annapolis for violations of the Housing Rights Act, Civil Rights Act, and the Equal Protection clause of the 14th Amendment. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, compensatory damages, appropriate equitable relief, and attorneys fees. The plaintiffs claimed the Housing Authority of the City of Annapolis failed to conduct routine inspections which would have uncovered the dangerous flaws in the public housing occupied by the plaintiffs. This case follows on the heels of a 2019 case (White v. City of Annapolis) in which similarly situated plaintiffs sued the city for essentially the same violations Plaintiffs proposed a class but have yet to receive the court&rsquo;s determination on class certification.</p>\r\n<p>On May 24, 2022, the City of Annapolis filed a third-party complaint against the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development alleging that all of the plaintiff's alleged complaints&ndash;if true&ndash;are the product of HUD&rsquo;s failures and not their own. The City claims HUD&rsquo;s failure to conduct proper inspections and evaluations which were required by contract and law created all of the plaintiff&rsquo;s unsafe living conditions.

Joseph Donahue and The Donahue Law \nFirm, LLC, Peter A. Holland, Emanwel J. Turnbull and the Holland Law Firm, \nP.C. hereby sue the Defendants, and as grounds therefore state as follows: \nIt is the policy of the City, in the exercise of its police \npowers for the protection of the public safety, public \nhealth,  and  general  welfare,  to  assure  equal \nopportunity to all persons to live in decent housing \nfacilities and to eliminate discrimination in all housing \naccommodations  regardless  of  race,  color,  religion, \ndisability, familial status, sexual orientation, gender \nidentity,  marital  status,  sex,  source  of  income, \nimmigration  status,  citizenship  status,  or  national \norigin, and to that end to prohibit discrimination in all \nhousing accommodations by any person. \n \nAnnapolis City Code, Chapter 11.32 (Fair Housing) § 11.32.010 A. \nNATURE OF ACTION  \nThe Named Plaintiffs file his action to vindicate their rights and the rights of \nthe putative class members under the Fair Housing Act as amended, 42 U.S.C. § \n3601, et seq., the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1982, 1983, 1985, and \n1986; and the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution, and the City of Annapolis Municipal Code, §18.08.010.  The \nalleged violations are based on the fact that during the relevant time period the City \nof  Annapolis  affirmatively  decided  not  to  inspect,  and  failed  to  inspect,  the \nproperties owned and operated by the Housing Authority of the City of Annapolis \n(the “HACA Properties”), which are occupied by tenants, over 90% of whom are \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 3 of 42\nAfrican American.  This failure to inspect as required by law (including by the City’s \nown  Code)  constitutes  discrimination  in  housing  (including  discrimination  as \ndefined by the City’s own Code). \nThis lawsuit follows and builds upon White v. City of Annapolis, Civil Action \nNo. CCB-19-1442, and this court’s ruling on the motions to dismiss in that case, \nlocated at 439 F.Supp.3d 522 (Feb. 3, 2020).  In that ruling, the court held that the \nPlaintiffs in that case stated claims for the following causes of action: \n•  disparate impact and/or disparate treatment under the Fair Housing Act; \n•  violation of the Equal Protection Clause; \n•  conspiracy to deprive Plaintiffs of their civil rights or privileges; \n•  disparate  impact  under  the  Americans  With  Disabilities  Act  and \nRehabilitation Act; \n•  breach of contract under Maryland law. \nPlaintiffs  in  this  follow  up  action  are  predominately  African  American \nresidents  of  the  housing  developments  owned  and  operated  by  the  Housing \nAuthority of the City of Annapolis (“HACA” or the “Housing Authority”).  In their \nindividual capacities and as representatives of a putative class, the Named Plaintiffs \nin this action challenge the discriminatory policies of the City of Annapolis to forego \nits statutory obligation to inspect and license the leased properties owned by the \nHousing Authority.  At its simplest level, this case seeks to vindicate the rights of \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 4 of 42\nthe approximately 1,600 residents who were not party to the White case, and to \ncompensate those individuals for the City’s blatant violations of those rights.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n1.  This civil action arises under the laws of the United States of America.  \nThis Court has original jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \n(federal question), 28 U.S.C. § 2201 (declaratory relief), and 42 U.S.C. § 3613 (Fair \nHousing Act, private right of action for damages and injunctive relief).   \n2.  Under 28 U.S.C. § 1367, this Court has supplemental jurisdiction over \nthe claims brought under Maryland law because they are related to Plaintiffs’ federal \nclaims and arise out of a common nucleus of related facts.   \n3.  Venue herein is proper under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391 (b)(1) and (2).  The \nNamed Plaintiffs resided in the City of Annapolis, Anne Arundel County, Maryland. \nDefendant City of Annapolis maintains its principal place of business in the City of \nAnnapolis, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, and the events or omissions giving rise \nto the claims occurred in this district and division. \nPARTIES \nNamed Plaintiffs \n4.  Named  Plaintiff  Tamara  Johnson  (“Ms.  Johnson”)  is  an  African \nAmerican woman.  She and her minor child live in Annapolis at 1215 Madison \nStreet, Apartment A1, an apartment in Harbour House. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 5 of 42\n5.  Ms.  Johnson  and  her  daughter  have  lived  in  their  Harbour  House \napartment since 2017.  In the time she has been there, the City has never inspected \nher home.   \n6.  Harbour House is owned by the Housing Authority of the City of \nAnnapolis (HACA). \n7.  The  City’s  failure  to  inspect  Ms.  Johnson’s  HACA-owned  rental \nproperty is in direct contrast to the City’s inspection policy of rental properties in \nAnnapolis that are not owned by HACA, and that which the City does inspect.   \n8.   The Johnson family has been forced to deal with sewage leaks from \nthe apartment above into their bathroom.  Their bathroom floor tile was cracked and \nworn out, but when the pieces broke, the floor was not repaired for months, and so \nthe family lived with the wooden plywood as their bathroom floor.   \n9.  The family has suffered through multiple rodent infestations.  They \nhave had mice in their pantry and kitchen area which are a constant concern for \ncontamination of their food. \n10.   Throughout  their  entire  period  of  residence,  the  family  has  had \npersistent mold growth throughout their apartment.  Because the City chose to \nabandon the inspections requirement, the Housing Authority has elected to simply \nwipe the mold with a rag and paint over it on multiple occasions, without ever truly \nremediating it.   \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 6 of 42\n11.  Ms. Johnson’s minor daughter suffers from respiratory issues, and the \nmold and other conditions of the home make it difficult for her to breathe, so her \ndoctor has prescribed her an inhaler. \n12.  Named  Plaintiff  Tyonna  Holliday  (“Ms.  Holliday”)  is  an  African \nAmerican woman.  She and her minor children live in Annapolis at 1132 Frederick \nDouglass Street, a town house in Eastport Terrace. \n13.  Eastport Terrace is owned by the Housing Authority of the City of \nAnnapolis (HACA). \n14.  Ms. Holliday and her children have lived in their Eastport Terrace town \nhouse since 2016.  In the time she has been there, the City has never inspected her \nhome.   \n15.  The  City’s  failure  to  inspect  Ms.  Johnson’s  HACA-owned  rental \nproperty is in direct contrast to the City’s inspection policy of rental properties in \nAnnapolis that are not owned by HACA, and that which the City does inspect. \n16.  As is the case with the Johnson family, throughout their entire period \nof residence, the Holliday family has had persistent mold growth throughout their \napartment.   \n17.  Because the City chose to abandon the inspections requirement, the \nHousing Authority has elected to simply wipe the mold with a rag and paint over it \non multiple occasions, without ever truly remediating it.   \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 7 of 42\n18.  Ms. Holliday and one of her children suffer from asthma that has been \nexacerbated by the persistent mold in their home.  As a result of the mold, she and \nher  child  have  been  treated  for  breathing  issues  and  prescribed  numerous \nmedications to assist their breathing.   \n19.  Recently, the Holliday Family was advised by HACA officials that their \napartment contains unsafe levels of lead.  HACA has known about the presence of \nlead for years, but because the HACA-owned rental properties were not inspected \nby the City, HACA was never required to provide lead certifications to the City.  The \nHolliday Family is just one of multiple families who were made aware of lead in \ntheir home and advised by HACA that their family was being forced to move to a \nnew residence.  \nDefendant \n20.  Defendant City of Annapolis is a municipal corporation in the State of \nMaryland, Anne Arundel County. \nFACTS \n21.  For the convenience of the Court and the Parties, the factual allegations \nof this Complaint are divided into two sections as follows: (1) Facts Similarly \nAlleged in the Case of White, et al. v. City of Annapolis, et al., and (2) Facts \nDiscovered  Subsequent  to  Filing  of  White,  et  al.  v.  City  of  Annapolis,  et  al.  \nFurthermore, the allegations of fact found in White, et al. v. City of Annapolis, et al., \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 8 of 42\nwhich are, or could be construed as, material to the allegations of the present \nComplaint, are hereby incorporated.   \nFacts Similarly Alleged in the Case of White, et al. v. City of Annapolis, et al.  \n \nHistorical Treatment of African Americans by the City of Annapolis \n22.  Throughout its nearly 370-year history, Annapolis has been home to \nmany people of African descent, some of them seeing it for the first time from the \nperch of the slave auction block that stained its bustling harbor.  Throughout its \nhistory, Annapolis has discriminated and continues to discriminate against African \nAmericans as it relates to residential housing.   As was alleged in White, the Plaintiffs \nallege  here  that  “the  City's  refusal  to  enforce  the  licensing  and  inspection \nrequirements  on  HACA  properties,  and  HACA's  refusal  to  follow  them,  is \ndiscriminatory.”  White v. City of Annapolis by & through City Council, 439 F. Supp. \n3d 522, 533 (D. Md. 2020).  Moreover, as was alleged in White, the Plaintiffs here \nallege that “in addition to the disparate impact, Annapolis’ history supports an \ninference of intentional discrimination.”  Id. \nThe HACA Properties \n23.  HACA manages approximately 790 apartments spread over six (6) \ndevelopments, which are home to approximately 1,600 residents: \na.  Bloomsbury Square – Rebuilt in 2003, this is HACA’s \nnewest property, and it consists of 51 units; \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 9 of 42\nb.  Harbour House – Constructed in 1964, is comprised of 273 \nunits;   \nc.  Eastport Terrace – Constructed in 1953, is HACA’s oldest \nproperty and is comprised of 84 units.  Eastport Terrace \nand Harbor House share a property line, and the residents \nshare the same recreational facilities;   \nd.  Morris H. Blum Senior Apartments – Constructed in 1976, \nare  HACA’s  only  dedicated  units  for  the  elderly  and \ndisabled, and require tenants be 55-years-old (or 50-years-\nold if disabled) to apply;   \ne.  Robinwood – Constructed in 1970 is comprised of 150 \nunits; and \nf.  Newtowne Twenty (or “Newtowne 20”) – Constructed in \n1971 was comprised of 78 units before its demolition in \n2020.  It is in the process of redevelopment. \nRental Unit License – A Requirement of the Annapolis City Code \n24.  In the early 1980s, the City of Annapolis began to place great emphasis \non licenses and inspections of its rental properties.  In fact, after the City first began \nto enforce its rental inspection regime, it faced a backlash from private property \nowners who fought the rental inspections as violative of the state constitution.  In \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 10 of 42\nresponse, the City sought and obtained emergency state legislation to remedy the \nconstitutional deficiency.  The remedy gave the City the express authority to charge \na rental dwelling license fee of all rental properties in the City.           \n25.  During the relevant time period, Chapter 17.44.010 of the City Code \nstated:  \nNo person shall let for occupancy or use any vacant single rental \ndwelling  unit,  multiple  dwelling,  bed  and  breakfast  home, \nroominghouse, or bargehouse without a current operating license \nissued by  the Department of  Planning  and Zoning,  after the \napplication for the license has been approved by the Director of \nPlanning and Zoning, with the concurrence of the Fire Chief, and \nthe County Health Officer, for the specific named unit, multiple \ndwelling, bed and breakfast home, roominghouse, or bargehouse. \n26.  During the relevant time period, Chapter 17.44.020 of the City Code \nstated:  \nNo  operating  license  shall  be  issued  or  renewed  unless  the \napplicant owner first has made application on an application \nform provided by the Director of the Department of Planning and \nZoning. The Director shall develop the forms and make them \navailable to the public. \n27.  Pursuant to this and other portions of the City Code, all rental units \nrequire a license issued by the City if they are to be legally authorized to operate.  \n28.  During the relevant time period, to obtain a license, rental units were \nrequired to be inspected and found to be in compliance with the City’s Residential \nProperty and Maintenance Code. Annapolis City Code, Chapter 17.44.010.    \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 11 of 42\n29.  During the relevant time period, HACA Properties managed solely by \nHACA were neither licensed nor inspected by the City.  These properties are the \nonly rental properties within the City that were neither licensed nor inspected.  \nThey were not licensed because HACA did not comply with the City Code by \napplying for rental licenses for its properties, and it was the City’s policy not to do \nanything about HACA’s lack of compliance with the Code. The City Code was \nsimply not enforced on the HACA Properties.  \n30.  Pursuant  to  policies  of  the  City’s  Office  of  Licenses  &  Permits \nDivision, when conditions that present a danger to health or safety are found in an \napartment that is currently occupied by tenants, a landlord is required to relocate that \ntenant, remediate the danger, request a reinspection, and provide other proof at the \nlandlord’s expense to the City Inspector demonstrating the danger is no longer \npresent. \n31.  During the relevant time period, Chapter 17.44.130 of the City Code \nstated: “Upon suspension, revocation, denial, or expiration of a license, the director \nshall have the authority to cause notices to be posted on the property which shall \nstate as follows: OCCUPANCY OF ANY DWELLING UNIT IN THIS BUILDING \nNOW  VACANT  OR  BECOMING  VACANT  IS  UNLAWFUL  UNTIL  A \nLICENSE TO OPERATE HAS BEEN OBTAINED AND IS DISPLAYED ON \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 12 of 42\nTHE PREMISES.”  During the relevant time period, no such postings were made by \nthe City on the HACA Properties.   \nThe City’s Notice of its Failure to Evenly Enforce its Code  \n32.  Rental licenses have been a requirement of prospective landlords by the \nCity since approximately 1985.  Despite the inspection requirement, the public \nhousing  units  managed  by  HACA  were  rarely,  if  ever,  subjected  to  any  City \ninspections whatsoever; but they have never been fully, finally, or properly inspected \nand licensed in accordance with the City Code.   The HACA Properties where the \nNamed Plaintiffs Johnson and Holliday live were not fully licensed and inspected at \nany time relevant to this Complaint. \n33.  Maryland  Housing  and  Community  Development  Code  §  12-403 \nstates:  \nExcept  as  provided  in  §  12-506(b)(9)  of  this  title,  all \nhousing  projects  of  an  authority  are  subject  to  the \nplanning,  zoning,  sanitary,  health,  fire,  housing, \nsubdivision, and building laws, ordinances, codes, rules, \nand regulations that apply where the housing project is \nlocated. \n34.  Maryland Housing and Community Development Code § 12-506(b)(9) \nstates:  \nTo  aid  and  cooperate  in  the  planning,  undertaking, \nconstruction,  or  operation  of  housing  projects  located \nwholly or partly in the area in which it may act, a State \npublic body, with or without consideration and on terms \nthat it determines, may … plan, replan, zone, or rezone any \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 13 of 42\npart  of  the  State  public  body,  make  exceptions  to  its \nsanitary, building, housing, fire, health, subdivision, or \nother similar laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances or \nmake any changes to its map or master plan…. \n \nRental License Application Process in the City of Annapolis \n \n35.  During the relevant time period, Chapter 17.44.060 (A) of the City \nCode stated:  \nThe operator of a multi-family dwelling consisting of fifty \nor more units who employs a full-time maintenance staff \nof three or more employees on-site shall have its license \ninitially issued or renewed for a two-year period. All other \nlicenses shall be issued or renewed on an annual basis.   \n(Emphasis added).  \n36.  All of HACA’s 790 units – including those of Ms. Johnson and Ms. \nHolliday – were required by law to be inspected and re-licensed by the City of \nAnnapolis annually.  \n37.  The Rental Operating License Application mandated by the City of \nAnnapolis states:  \nA property owner must obtain a license prior to operating a rental \nfacility within the City of Annapolis.  License application and \nrental operating license are non-transferable. Application must \ninclude fee of $100.00 per unit. Property must be inspected for \ncompliance  of  the  City’s  Code  and  International  Property \nMaintenance Code before the license will be issued.   \n \n38.  On May 1, 2016, the City began inspections of the HACA Properties.  \nThis initial round of inspections was not completed until July or August 2016.  The \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 14 of 42\nresults of the inspections were abysmal.  Of the 790 units inspected there were 2,498 \nCity Code violations uncovered by inspectors.   \n39.  Each  of  the  six  HACA  Properties  inspected  lacked  the  “Electric \nHardwired Smoke Detectors” required by City Code of all rental units.  Many of the \nbattery powered smoke detectors required of HUD’s lower inspection standard were \nnot functioning.  \n40.  Many of the City Code violations presented dangers to health and \nsafety.  Consistent with the City Code, the City should have required HACA to \nrelocate tenants pending the correction of the dangerous conditions or to reimburse \ntenants for their costs related to securing adequate substitute housing.  Even after it \nconducted the initial inspections, the City did not enforce its own Code remedies for \nnon-compliance with the City Code. Pursuant to the City Code, the City should have \nrevoked the licenses or required the vacation of the HACA Properties and relocation \nof HACA tenants while affected units were brought into compliance with the Code.  \nThe City chose to do neither. \n41.  After the initial inspection results were provided to HACA officials in \nthe summer of 2016, the Housing Authority was provided with follow-up inspection \ndates for when the City would be back out for a second round of inspections.  Some \nfollow-up inspections were conducted, but none of the six HACA Properties were \never fully and properly licensed. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 15 of 42\n42.  In  February  2018  testimony  before  the  City  Council,  then  HACA \nDirector  Beverly  Wilbourn  stated  that  “We  can’t really have  a strong housing \nauthority without the full support of the City of Annapolis.” \n43.  Director Wilbourn then spoke about the various issues faced by HACA \nwhen it came to maintenance: \nLet  me  be  clear,  I  can’t  do  maintenance.  I  can’t  get \nmaintenance to get me away clear on properties that are 40, \n50, in the case of Eastport Terrace 65 years old, and in need \nof major rehab.  That is where redevelopment comes into play.  \nAnd that is what we have RAD, that is what we have selected as \nthe redevelopment tool… But the reality is, there is only so far \nwe can get with maintenance.  At a point real estate needs some \ncapital  infusion,  some  major  system  rehabs,  changing  out, \nrenewal,  even  the  layouts  need  to  be  changed  some.  \nObsolescence comes into play.  And that’s where we are with \nprobably  about  five  of  our  developments.    And  we  are \ncommitted to taking that through so that we have in each of our \ncommunities, communities that all of us can be proud of. \n \n(Emphasis added). \n \nDemographic Context and Disparate Impact \n44.   The Housing Authority of the City of Annapolis has six low-income \nhousing  properties:  Bloomsbury  Square;  Harbour  House;  Newtowne  Twenty; \nEastport Terrace; Robinwood; and Morris H. Blum Senior Apartments.  Morris H. \nBlum Senior Apartments is restricted to older and disabled persons. \n45.  Racial composition of these low-income housing developments is not \ndirectly available from public sources, but the racial composition of the Census \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 16 of 42\nblock  (the  immediate  neighborhood)  where  each  property  is  located  can  be \ndetermined from the 2010 Census.  The Census blocks for each of the six low-\nincome housing properties are identified using the street addresses listed by the \nHousing  Authority of  the  City  of  Annapolis.   The  Census  Bureau’s  American \nFactFinder  street  address  function  identifies  Census  blocks  based  on  street \naddresses. \n46.    Five of the Housing Authority properties are located in majority Black \nCensus blocks.  Three of the Housing Authority properties (Bloomsbury Square, \nNewtowne  Twenty,  and  Robinwood)  are  in  blocks  where  more  than  90%  of \nresidents are Black.  Whites comprise 58.9% of the residents in the block where \nthe Morris H. Blum Senior Apartments is located, 16.3% of the residents are Black \nand 21.3% of the residents are Latino.1  Blum is the only Housing Authority property \ndesignated for seniors and disabled people, and it is the only Housing Authority \nproperty located in a majority White Census block. \n47.  The  six  Housing  Authority  properties  are  in  blocks  where  Blacks \ncomprise 67.5% of the residents, Whites comprise 22.6% of the residents, and \nLatinos comprise 5.7% of the residents.  In contrast, in the City of Annapolis as a \nwhole, Whites accounted for 53.5% of residents, Blacks accounted for 25.7% of \nresidents, and Latinos  accounted  for 16.8%  of  residents.   Residents of the six \n \n1 White refers to Non-Hispanic Whites. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 17 of 42\nHousing Authority properties are disproportionately Black.  The proportion of Black \nresidents  in  these  properties  is  2.6  times  greater  than  the  proportion  of  Black \nresidents in the City of Annapolis.   \n48.  The five Housing Authority properties not designated as senior and \ndisabled housing are in blocks where Blacks comprise 71.5% of the residents, \nWhites comprise 19.7% of the residents, and Latinos comprise 4.4% of the residents.  \nAs noted above, Whites accounted for 53.5% of residents in the City of Annapolis, \nBlacks accounted  for  25.7%  of  residents,  and Latinos accounted  for 16.8%  of \nresidents.  Residents of the five Housing Authority properties not designated as \nsenior housing are disproportionately Black.  The proportion of Black residents in \nthe neighborhoods where these properties are located is 2.8 times greater than the \nproportion of Black residents in the City of Annapolis.  \n49.  The City of Annapolis Five Year Consolidated Housing and Community \nDevelopment Plan Federal Fiscal Year 2015-2019 identifies the racial distribution \nof residents in the public housing properties.  Of the 831 public housing units,2 759 \n(91.3%) were identified as occupied by Blacks and 58 (7.0%) were occupied by \n \n2  This figure of 831 public housing units references the additional HACA units \nwhich are located outside of the HACA managed properties in other public/private \ndevelopments, and incipiently, are inspected by the City.  \n  \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 18 of 42\nWhites.3  A separate table reports 20 Hispanic residents.4  The race of the Hispanic \nresidents is not reported.  This report was submitted in May 2015, so these numbers \npresumably represent the public housing population in 2015.   In 2010, Whites \naccounted for 53.5% of residents in the City of Annapolis, Blacks accounted for \n25.7% of residents, and Latinos accounted for 16.8% of residents.  Based on the \nCity’s report and the 2010 Census data, the proportion of Black residents in these \nproperties is 3.6 times greater than the proportion of Black residents in the City of \nAnnapolis. \nFacts Learned Subsequent to Filing of White, et al. v. City of Annapolis, et al. \n50.  Allegations contained in the case of White, et al. v. City of Annapolis, \net al. which related to the agreement between the City and the Housing Authority to \nno longer enforce the City Code on the HACA Properties were, at the time, based \nupon information and belief.  However, upon filing of the complaint in that case, \nvarious members of the public came forward with information, including documents, \nwhich certified those allegations of agreement, policy, and conspiracy.  The present \nallegations are based upon undisputed facts.   \n \n \n3 Table 24, The City of Annapolis Five Year Consolidated Housing and Community \nDevelopment Plan Federal Fiscal Year 2015-2019. \n \n4 Table 25, The City of Annapolis Five Year Consolidated Housing and Community \nDevelopment Plan Federal Fiscal Year 2015-2019. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 19 of 42\nExecutive Director Wilbourn and Mayor Buckley Entered an Agreement to \nCease City Inspections of the HACA Properties \n \n51.  In June 2017 newly appointed Director Wilbourn issued her Executive \nDirector’s Report for June 2017.  Director Wilbourn identified the City inspections \nof the HACA Properties as a hurdle to her success in balancing the HACA budget \nstating: \nA major assumption to remain within FY 2018 budget \npertains to the City of Annapolis working with HACA \nregarding City ordered inspections, repairs and upgrades \non HACA property. HACA has experienced unsustainable \nmaintenance overtime, delays in unit turnover, defer [sic] \nmaintenance actions, imposition of fees to the City, and \nunrealistic deadlines to meet City inspection mandates. \nThe current relationship with the City cannot continue \nif HACA is to achieve its priority of maximizing housing \nopportunities. I will meet with the City Administrative \n[sic]  this  week  to  discuss  the  decreased  housing \nopportunities and increased cost overruns caused by the \nCity unfunded mandates. \n \n(emphasis added). \n \n52.  Director Wilbourn interpreted the state and city code statutes which \nrequire inspections of the HACA Properties – inspections conducted to ensure the \nhealth and safety of the occupants – by the City to be “unfunded mandates,” on the \nHousing Authority.  It was Wilbourn’s view that a major assumption of the FY 2018 \nbudget required the City of Annapolis to “work” with HACA regarding the City-\nordered inspections, repairs, and upgrades on the HACA Properties. The Executive \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 20 of 42\nDirector went so far as to say that the “current relationship” – one where the City \nconducted inspections of the HACA Properties – “cannot continue.”  \n53.  In  July  2017,  via  email,  Mary  Emrick,  a  Senior  City  Inspector, \nrequested that Director Wilbourn advise when the City might receive HACA’s next \nround of applications for license renewals, a logistical step which would have begun \nthe next round of HACA Property inspections.  Director Wilbourn forwarded that \nemail correspondence along to HACA Board Member John Dillon.  In that forward, \nshe advised that she had discussed the inspections with the City Manager Thomas \nAndrews and relayed to Dillon that her understanding from her conversation with \nthe City Manager was that the City would “work out an agreement going forward on \nthe inspections,” but that apparently because Mr. Andrews was out of town on \nvacation the inspections were being scheduled.   \n54.  In her email, Director Wilbourn advised that if the issue could not be \nworked out, she would refer the matter to HACA’s attorneys, an action which was \ninterpreted by members of the HACA Board, in a subsequent email, to mean that \nDirector Wilbourn was in favor of bringing suit against the City of Annapolis to \nprevent  inspections  of  HACA  Properties  if  the  City  insisted  on  inspecting  the \nproperties. \n55.  On approximately August 30, 2017, having apparently failed to reach \nan agreement regarding the inspections, Mary Emrick was advised by Director \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 21 of 42\nWilbourn that “the city is to not do any inspection until [Director Wilbourn] speaks \nwith the board.” \n56.  Upon receipt of that correspondence, then Mayor Pantelides countered: \n“This is not acceptable! In our meeting last week we agreed the inspections would \nmove forward.  Why is she fighting against everyone being treated the same? \nWe are trying to improve their quality of life.”  (emphasis added).  \n57.  On approximately September 8, 2017, Director Wilbourn drafted a \ndocument  titled  “Status  Report  on  Scope  of  Work  identified  in  Employment \nAgreement.”  This document reflects Director Wilbourn’s assessment of her actions \nto date as HACA Director in terms of various line items which had been included \nunder the “Scope of Work” in her Employment Contract. In response to one line \nitem in the scope of work, Director Wilbourn stated: \nUnsuccessfully worked to redefine relationship between \nHACA and Mayor’s office. Unsuccessfully sought City \nconsensus  to  move  from  City  inspections  to  REAC \ninspections,  for  sustainability,  HUD  compliance  and \navoiding unintended liabilities to HACA. \n \nIn the final line of the draft, and in response to the line item entitled, “Exercise \nauthority to function and take actions deemed necessary to execute Scope of Work,” \nDirector Wilbourn provided the following: “Executive Director’s authority is \ncontinually  undermined  by  Board  members  and  City.”  (emphasis  added).  \nDirector Wilbourn apparently believed that the City was undermining her ability to \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 22 of 42\nperform her job by enforcing the state and city code on HACA as a landlord in \nAnnapolis. \n58.  City elections were held November 7, 2017.  Mayor Pantelides, who \nhad emphasized during his reelection campaign that he was the “First Mayor to \nInspect Public Housing,” was unseated by Gavin Buckley.  However, Mr. Buckley \nwould not be sworn in as mayor until the following month. \n59.  In November 2017, Director Wilbourn was in the process of negotiating \nher contract of employment with HACA.  In response to an email regarding the \ncontract negotiation, and highlighting a lack of language within the contract, HACA \nBoard Member Kimberly Cornett pointed out the following: “Largely this looks fine \nbut [I] did want to note that it is silent on the expectations of the Executive Director \nvis a vis the City inspections which have been an issue between Beverly [Wilbourn] \nand the Board.”  With the mandated city inspections still a City requirement of the \nPantelides administration, and the apparent concern that the Board did not believe \nDirector Wilbourn would follow their decisions regarding the inspections, Board \nChairwoman Sandra Chapman responded on November 20, 2017 as follows: \nI would also like to remind you that the City not the board \ntook action on setting up the City inspections. No, it is not \na concern that Beverly isn’t going to listen to the board on \nthis matter. Her and I have spoken about improving \nrelationships with the City, and she has already met \nwith  our  incoming  Mayor  about  this  and  the \ninspections. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 23 of 42\n \n(emphasis added).  Then Mayor-elect Buckley had not yet been sworn into office on \nthe day this email was sent. Mayor-Elect Buckley and Director Wilbourn entered \ntheir agreement to stop inspections of the HACA Properties prior to Mr. Buckley \neven having taken the oath of office. \nThe Mayor, the City of Annapolis Office of Law, and the Housing Authority \nWorked Together to Try to Evict a HACA Tenant and Formalize the City’s \nPolicy of Non-Enforcement of the City Code on the HACA Properties \n \n60.  During approximately the first year and a half of Mayor Buckley’s \nadministration – December 2017 through May 2019 – the only evidence of the City’s \nnew policy of non-enforcement of the City Code on the HACA Properties were \nrepresentations to members of the public made by members of the City’s Office of \nPlanning and Zoning.  Those representations came about when HACA residents \ncalled to complain about issues related to their HACA apartments.  Representatives \nfrom that office explained that the City no longer inspected the HACA Properties.   \n61.  On March 27, 2019, HACA resident Ladawn Camp was sued by the \nHousing Authority in the case of Housing Authority of the City of Annapolis v. \nLaDawn  Camp,  Anne  Arundel  County  District  Court  Case  No.  D-071-LT-19-\n001816.  The case was filed for alleged failure to pay rent.  In her defense, she raised \nthe fact that she had paid rent and that HACA was mistaken.  However, she also \nbrought to the attention of the district court the fact that HACA was not even licensed \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 24 of 42\nby the City to rent their properties, and therefore, pursuant to Maryland law, it was \nlegally foreclosed from filing summary ejectment actions in landlord/tenant court.   \n62.  In an effort to undermine Ms. Camp’s defense, HACA and the City \nworked together to prosecute her eviction. \n63.  In an April 26, 2019 email from a HACA attorney to an Assistant City \nAttorney, HACA forwarded a draft affidavit for the signature of City Manager \nTeresa Sutherland.  HACA’s attorney went on to express that “HACA needs the \nassistance of the City, as discussed.”  To that end, HACA’s attorney stated: “It \nwould  be  terrible  for  HACA  and  the  City  if  HACA  was  prohibited  from \ncollecting rent because it has no licenses for its units.”   \n64.  On May 9, 2019, in a follow-up email from HACA’s attorney to the \nCity  Attorney,  the  HACA  attorney  explained  that  HACA  Executive  Director \nWilbourn would be calling Mayor Buckley that day to discuss with the Mayor his \npreparation of a potential witness from the City for the May 14, 2019 hearing.  That \nwitness was to be the City’s Chief of Code Enforcement.  In that email, HACA’s \nattorney also inquired further into the status of the affidavit.   \n65.  The  following  day,  May  10,  2019,  the  City  Manager  executed  an \naffidavit which reduced to writing the City’s non-inspection policy of the HACA \nProperties.  Under oath, she swore that “no City inspections or licenses are required \nfor HACA to operate its properties lawfully.”  This document reflects that as of that \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 25 of 42\ndate – May 10, 2019 – the City’s stated policy was specifically not to require \nHACA’s compliance with the City Code.  Pursuant to City policy, HACA properties \nwere not required to be inspected or licensed by the City.     \n66.  At the May 14, 2019 hearing in HACA v. Camp, the City’s Chief of \nCode Enforcement testified after his preparation by Mayor Buckley that it was in \nfact  Mayor  Buckley  who  decided  to  exempt  HACA  from  the  City’s  licensing \nrequirement.    After the hearing, HACA’s attorney emailed the City’s Chief of Code \nEnforcement to thank him for testifying on HACA’s behalf.  In that email, he copied \nthe following individuals: the City Attorney, the City Manager, Mayor Buckley, and \nExecutive Director Wilbourn. \n67.  On May 16, 2019, plaintiffs in the case of White, et al. v. City of \nAnnapolis, et al., Civil Action No. 1:19-cv-01442-CCB, filed suit in the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Maryland.  In that lawsuit plaintiffs alleged that the City had \ndiscriminated against residents of public housing through their jointly agreed upon \nnon-inspection policy as it related to the HACA Properties. \nThe City and HACA’s Joint Policy of Separate and Unequal Inspections – the \n“Shadow Policy” \n68.  Upon filing of the White lawsuit, the Mayor and City Council took swift \npublic-facing actions to correct their plainly discriminatory policy which had been \nbrought to light in the complaint.   \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 26 of 42\n69.  On June 10, 2019, less than a month after the lawsuit was filed and \nbefore it was even served on the City, the Mayor and City Council of Annapolis \nunanimously adopted R-26-19, which resolved that “the City of Annapolis [would \nonce  again]  begin  inspecting  HACA  units  under  the  City’s  rental  licensing \nprogram.”  Yet despite this resolution, the illegal and blatantly violative conduct \ncontinued.  Despite the adoption of Resolution R-26-19 and its representation that \nthe Mayor and City Council would begin to treat Housing Authority tenants equally \nwith those citizens who lived in all other rental properties in the City, both City and \nHACA  officials  continued  behind  the  scenes  to  work  together  to  discriminate \ndirectly against the tenants of the HACA Properties, including the Named Plaintiffs. \n70.  Despite  the  resolution,  officials  from  the  City  and  the  Housing \nAuthority conspired further to treat the tenants of the HACA Properties differently.  \nOn approximately June 28, 2019, the City and HACA agreed to implement a Shadow \nPolicy to conduct inspections on Housing Authority units differently than all other \nrental units throughout the City.  In an email from City Manager Teresa Sutherland \nto HACA Executive Director Beverly Wilbourn, the City Manager outlined ways in \nwhich the City would circumvent the requirements of R-26-19 through “waivers” \nand “grandfathering old violations” in the following ways: \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 27 of 42\na.  Inspections would be for life safety issues only, with the exception \nof the requirement for hard-wired smoke detectors, which the City \nagreed to waive. \nb.  Hard-wired  smoke  detectors  are  required  in  all  City  rental \nproperties.  However,  the  City  waived  this  requirement  for  the \nHACA properties. Instead, unlike all other rental properties in the \nCity, the HACA Properties would be allowed to use battery operated \nsmoke detectors. \nc.  The City and HACA agreed that the City would not deny a license \nfor a unit for deficiencies in routine maintenance, but would simply \nnote the violations, consider waivers up to one year, and issue the \nlicense despite the violations. \nd.  Disturbingly, the City and HACA agreed that the City might not \neven  withhold  a  license  for  “structural  or  mechanical  defects.” \nRather, whether structural or mechanical defects would result in \nHACA being denied a license would be decided on a case-by-case \nbasis; the City might consider waivers even for those significant \nissues. \n71.  The City and HACA’s agreement to the issuance of a one-year waiver \nfor deficiencies in routine maintenance amounted to a complete waiver of “routine \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 28 of 42\nmaintenance” violations since the term of a license was one year under the City \nCode.  In effect, this Shadow Policy gutted R-26-19, while the HACA residents and \ncitizens of Annapolis were otherwise left to believe that the City was carrying out \nthe law as represented.   \n72.  Further, the City’s 2019 and early 2020 inspections of the HACA \nProperties which were conducted under the auspices of R-26-19 failed to note many \nof the very same types of “routine maintenance” violations that had surfaced in the \n2016 inspections.  The types of items for which HACA could receive a “waiver” \nincluded, among others, the following: \na.  Chipping paint on walls \nb.  Rodent infestations  \nc.  Defective doorknobs at the entrance to apartments \nd.  Inoperable vent fans (which reduce moisture and prevent \nmold growth) \n \ne.  Broken light fixtures \nf.  Defective and broken countertops \ng.  Holes in doors and walls \nh.  Missing bathroom fixtures \ni.  Missing window screens in buildings that did not have air \nconditioning \n \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 29 of 42\n73.  In practice, the Shadow Policy agreed upon by the City and HACA \nresulted in the City’s inspectors plainly ignoring numerous routine maintenance \nfailures that would have been enforced as violations had they been encountered by \nCity inspectors at any other rental property in the City. \n74.  As a November 7, 2019 inspection report on the Morris Blum Senior \nLiving Building demonstrates, the City scheduled re-inspections only for “Life \nSafety” and “Structural and Infestation” violations. \n75.  Another inspection in January 2020 inexplicably contained only “Life \nSafety” and “Structural, Plumbing, Elec” violations and made no effort to even \nidentify the “routine maintenance” failures. \n76.  The Shadow Policy continued the City’s separate, unequal inspections \nfor Housing Authority units, treating Housing Authority tenants as second-class \ncitizens, not deserving of the same standards of housing as tenants in private rental \nproperties in the City. \n77.  The Shadow Policy allowed the City and HACA to intentionally treat \nthe tenants of the HACA Properties differently than tenants who live just across or \ndown the street from a neighbor who lives in a property that is not a HACA Property.  \nHACA not fully complying with City Code and the City applying different, lesser \nstandards to HACA properties in response, is just one further example of how the \nCity and HACA partnered to further perpetuate segregation in the City of Annapolis. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 30 of 42\nTheir partnership operated to the detriment of the Named Plaintiffs’ lives, health, \nand safety as well as the life, health, and safety of all other residents of HACA \nproperties.  \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n78.  The Named Plaintiffs file this case as a class action pursuant to FRCP \n23.  The Class is defined as: \nAll individuals now living who are or previously were \ntenants in Housing Authority properties within the two \nyears immediately preceding the filing of the complaint.  \n79.  Excluded from the class are (i) any of the individual Plaintiffs from \nWhite v. City of Annapolis, Civil Action No. CCB-19-1442; (ii) any employee or \nindependent  contractor of the Defendants; (iii)  any relative of  an  employee  or \nindependent contractor of the Defendants; (iv) any employee of the Court where this \naction  is  pending,  or  (v)  any  person  who  filed  for  bankruptcy  and  received  a \ndischarge after ceasing to be a resident in a HACA property. \n80.  The definition of the class is subject to amendment. \n81.  Ascertainability. The class members are readily ascertainable from the \nhousing records which are in the possession of the Defendant, HACA, or either of \ntheir affiliated entities and agents. \n82.  FRCP  23(a)(1).    Numerosity.  The  members  of  the  class  are  so \nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. At all material times there \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 31 of 42\nwere  approximately  790  HACA  leased  units,  housing  approximately  1,600 \nindividuals.  Defendant treated all tenants in these units similarly, in that it had a \npolicy of non-inspection or non-enforcement with respect to all Housing Authority \nunits. Therefore, all individual tenants in Housing Authority units are likely to be \nmembers of the class. \n83.  FRCP 23(a)(2).  Common Questions. There are common questions of \nfact  and  law  which  predominate  over  any  questions  affecting  only  individual \nmembers.  The common questions of law and fact include: \na.  Whether Defendant had a policy to not inspect the HACA \nProperties on the same basis as non-HACA Properties; \nb.  Whether Defendant had a policy of failing to enforce City \nhousing code violations at the HACA Properties on the \nsame basis as similar violations at non-HACA Properties; \nc.  Whether Defendant’s discriminatory policies violated the \nClass’s rights under Federal and state constitutional and \nstatutory law. \n84.  FRCP 23(a)(3).  Typicality. Plaintiffs’ claims are typical and are the \nsame or identical to the claims of individual members of the class and are based on \nthe same facts and legal theories.  The Defendant’s defenses are likely to be similar \nfor Plaintiffs as for the members of the class. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 32 of 42\n85.  FRCP 23(a)(4).   Adequacy. The  Named  Plaintiffs will  fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the class members in the prosecution of this action.  \nThey are similarly situated with, and have suffered the same harms and injury as the \nclass members that they seek to represent.   \n86.  The Named Plaintiffs have retained counsel experienced in class action \nlitigation, and specifically in the facts and law involved in this case insofar as this \ncase is a follow-on to the White case. \n87.  None of Plaintiffs’ counsel have interests which might prevent them \nfrom actively and vigorously pursuing this action. \n88.  Plaintiffs do not have any conflicts of interest that would interfere with \ntheir ability to represent the interest of the members of the class. \n89.  FRCP 23(b)(2).  The City of Annapolis has acted or refused to act on \ngrounds  that  apply  generally  to  the  class,  so  that  final  injunctive  relief  or \ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole. \n90.  FRCP 23(b)(3).  Predominance and Superiority. Questions of law or \nfact  common  to  the  class  members  predominate  over  questions  affecting  only \nindividual members.  In addition, a class action is superior to other methods of fairly \nand efficiently adjudicating this controversy, for the following reasons:  \na.  Because the basic facts and legal theories are all the same, \nthere  is  no  need  or  ability  for  each  class  member  to \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 33 of 42\nindividually control the prosecution in separate actions.  \nIndividual  litigation  of  the  claims  by  separate  class \nmembers  would  be  inefficient  and  waste  judicial \nresources,  requiring  repeated  litigation  of  the  common \nissues. \nb.  There is no existing litigation concerning the controversy \nalready begun by or against class members.  (The White \ncase (1:19-cv-01442-CCB) and the DaMon Fisher case \n(1:21-cv-01074-GLR)  do  not  involve  members  of  this \nproposed class). \nc.  Concentrating  the  litigation  in  this  forum  is  desirable \nbecause this is the home forum for both Defendant and the \nclass, and this court has the benefit of having dealt with \nthe previous individual action, White.  \nd.  Difficulties in managing the class are unlikely: the class \nconsists of a large but manageable number of individuals \nwhose  identities  are  readily  ascertainable  from  the \nHACA’s records. \n \n \n \n \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 34 of 42\nCOUNT I \n(Violation of Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq.) \n \n91.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set \nforth herein. \n92.  Defendant’s policy of non-enforcement of the City Code on the HACA \nProperties constitutes a violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §3604 et seq., \nwhich makes it unlawful to “discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, \nor privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities \nin connection therewith, because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or \nnational origin.” \n93.  Defendant’s  facially  neutral  housing  acts,  policies,  and  actions \nchallenged herein inflicted disproportionate harm on Named Plaintiffs and members \nof the class.  The disproportionate harm experienced is the direct and immediate \nconsequence of the Defendant’s policy of non-enforcement of the City Code on the \nHACA Properties. \n94.  As a result of Defendant’s acts, Named Plaintiffs and members of the \nclass were denied the opportunity to live in safe rental housing inspected by the City \nof Annapolis on an annual basis, a right they would have enjoyed if they had lived \nin any other rental property in the City that was not managed by the Housing \nAuthority. \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 35 of 42\n95.  Defendant’s acts, policies, and practices constitute discrimination in \nviolation  of  the  Fair  Housing  Act,  as  amended,  42  U.S.C.  §3604,  and  its \nimplementing regulations, in that: \na.  Defendant’s acts, policies, and practices have made and continue to \nmake housing unavailable because of race in violation of 42 U.S.C. \n§3604(a). Specifically, HUD regulations provide in pertinent part \nthat “[i]t shall be unlawful, because of race [or] national origin . . . \nto discourage or obstruct choices in a community, neighborhood or \ndevelopment.” 24 C.F.R. § 100.70(a). Such acts “include, but are \nnot  limited  to:  (1)  Discouraging  any  person  from  inspecting, \npurchasing, or renting a dwelling . . . because of the race [or] \nnational origin . . . of persons in a community, neighborhood or \ndevelopment.” 24 C.F.R. § 100.70(c)(1); and \nb.  Defendant’s acts, policies, and practices provide different terms, \nconditions, and privileges of rental housing on the basis of race, in \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(b). Specifically, HUD’s regulations \nimplementing § 3604(b) specify that “[p]rohibited actions under this \nsection  include,  but  are  not  limited  to  .  .  .  failing  or  delaying \nmaintenance or repairs of sale or rental dwellings” and “[l]imiting \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 36 of 42\nthe  use  of  privileges,  services  or  facilities  associated  with  a \ndwelling” because of race or national origin. 24 C.F.R. § 100.65. \n96.  Additionally,  Defendant’s  acts,  policies,  and  practices  perpetuate \nsegregation in violation of the  Fair Housing Act  which  is prohibited.   HUD’s \nregulations  implementing  the  Fair  Housing  Act  state  that  “[a]  practice  has  a \ndiscriminatory  effect  where  it…creates,  increases,  reinforces,  or  perpetuates \nsegregated housing patterns because of race[.]”  24 C.F.R. § 100.500(a).      \n97.  The Named Plaintiffs and members of the class are aggrieved persons \nas defined in 42 U.S.C. § 3602 (d) and (i) and have been injured by Defendants’ \ndiscriminatory conduct defined by 42 U.S.C. § 3602(f).  \n98.  As a result of these violations, the Named Plaintiffs and members of the \nclass have been injured. \nCOUNT II \n(Violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. § 1982) \n \n99.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set \nforth herein. \n100.  Defendant’s  discriminatory  practices,  made  in  reckless  or  callous \nindifference or disregard for the rights of the Named Plaintiffs and members of the \nclass deprived them of their right to purchase, lease, or otherwise hold or convey \nproperty on the basis of race, color, and national origin and thus deprive them of the \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 37 of 42\nsame such rights as are enjoyed by White persons in violation of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1866, 42 U.S.C. § 1982. \n101.  Named Plaintiff Holliday and her family as well as other members of \nthe class have been forced out of their home due to the discovery of lead in their \napartments.   \n102.  As a result of these violations, the Named Plaintiffs and members of the \nclass have been injured. \nCOUNT III \n(Violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the  \nConstitution of the United States) \n \n103.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set \nforth herein. \n104.  Defendant’s discriminatory customs, patterns, practices, and usages in \ncontravention of constitutional and federal statutory rights made in reckless or \ncallous indifference or disregard for the rights of Named Plaintiffs and members of \nthe class, did deprive them of their right of equal access to housing under color of \nlaw in violation of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and their \nrights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution with regard to housing. \n105.  As a result of these violations, the Named Plaintiffs and members of the \nclass have been injured. \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 38 of 42\nCOUNT IV \n(Violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1985 Section 3 and the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the  \nConstitution of the United States) \n \n106.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set \nforth herein. \n107.  Defendants conspired with discriminatory purpose to deprive either \ndirectly or indirectly the rights of the Named Plaintiffs and members of the class, all \nof whom are a member of a protected class, to equal protection of the laws or equal \nprivileges  and  immunities  under  the  laws,  and  one  or  more  of  the  Defendant \nconspirators  did  or caused  to  be  done  acts in  furtherance of  the object of the \nconspiracy, and the Named Plaintiffs and members of the class were injured in \nperson or property or deprived of having and exercising their rights as citizens of the \nUnited States. \n108.  As a result of these violations, the Named Plaintiffs and members of the \nclass have been injured. \nCOUNT V \n(Violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1986 and the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States) \n \n109.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set \nforth herein. \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 39 of 42\n110.  Defendant, its employees, and its agents were in a position of power \nand knowledge of the conspiracy to deprive the Named Plaintiffs and members of \nthe class of their rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1985. \n111.  Defendant was on notice through City Council meetings, both open and \nclosed to the public, as well as communications between the Mayor, City Council, \nthe  Executive  Director,  and  Housing  Authority  officials,  that  the  City  had  an \nobligation to inspect the HACA Properties and that the Housing Authority had an \nobligation to comply with those inspections.  Despite these obligations, the City and \nHousing Authority agreed to a policy not to inspect the HACA Properties to the same \nstandard  of  all  other  rental  properties  in  the  City.    In  continued  refusal  of \nenforcement of City Code, and despite notice of that obligation, Defendant failed to \nuphold their  duty to  ensure the  health  and  safety of  the Named  Plaintiffs  and \nmembers of the class, whose civil rights were violated as a result. \n112.  As a result of these violations, the Named Plaintiffs and members of the \nclass have been injured. \nCOUNT VI \n(Violation of the Maryland State Constitution – Article 24 of the Maryland \nDeclaration of Rights) \n \n113.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set \nforth herein. \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 40 of 42\n114.  The Defendant, by its acts, have acted under color of law and have \nviolated Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights of the Maryland State Constitution, \n(1) by discriminating against the Named Plaintiffs and members of the class, and (2) \nby treating them on less than equal terms as those similarly situated tenants in the \nCity of Annapolis who are not tenants of public housing. \n115.  Defendant’s discriminatory customs, patterns, practices, and usages in \ncontravention of the constitutional rights of the Named Plaintiffs and members of \nthe class made in reckless or callous indifference or disregard for the rights of them, \ndid deprive the Named Plaintiffs and members of the class of their right of equal \naccess to housing under color of law in violation of Article 24 of the Maryland \nDeclaration of Rights with regard to housing. \n116.  As a result of these violations, the Named Plaintiffs and members of the \nclass have been injured. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 1   Filed 05/07/21   Page 41 of 42\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the Named Plaintiffs pray that the Court grant them the \nfollowing relief for themselves and for members of the class: \nA.

Fisher, et. al, filed this action against the City alleging \namong other things violations of the Fair Housing Act as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 3601, et seq., the \nCivil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986; and the Equal Protection \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Plaintiffs allege that the \nproperty conditions where Mr. Fisher resided was in poor condition containing mold and require \nrepair and maintenance, and as a result, Mr. Fisher contracted pulmonary disease and died.  The \nproperties complained of are owned by the Defendant/Cross-Defendant Housing Authority of the \nCity of Annapolis (“HACA”), a public housing authority (“PHA”), who is responsible for the \nproperties’ maintenance and management.  Plaintiffs allege that the City should have discovered \nthe poor condition of the properties, but it failed to inspect the properties and failed to require \nHACA to make the required repairs.  \n HACA, like all other PHAs, operates under HUD’s control and direction.  The Housing \nAct of 1937, 42 U.S. § 1437 et seq., as amended and the Housing and Community Development \nAct of 1974 (individually and collectively “the Housing Act”), requires HUD to use its funding \nto help remedy unsafe and unsanitary housing conditions and the shortage of decent housing for \nlow-income families.  42 U.S.C. § 1437a(b) (7).  According to the Act, HUD, in addition to other \nregulations, controls PHAs through its Annual Contributions Contract (hereinafter referred to as \n“ACC”).  42 U.S.C. § 1437g.  HACA receives federal funding from HUD to maintain and \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 28   Filed 05/24/22   Page 3 of 15\nmanage its properties.  The City contends that Plaintiffs’ complained of conditions results from \nthe policies and actions of HUD and HACA in their failures to properly fund the properties and \nHACA to maintain them in a safe and sanitary condition and not because of the City.  The City \nseeks declaratory and injunctive relief because HUD actually caused all claims that Plaintiffs \nassert against the City due to its failure to act as required by applicable law, in discriminating \nagainst the City, HACA, Mr. Fisher, HACA Tenants and in its insufficient funding and its failure \nto enforce of its own maintenance requirements for HACA Tenants’ units. \nPARTIES \n1.  Defendant and Third-Party Plaintiff City of Annapolis (the “City”) is a political \nsubdivision and a municipal corporation in Maryland. \n2.  Third-Party Defendant HUD is an independent federal agency. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n3.  This Court has federal subject matter jurisdiction in this matter under 28 U.S.C. § \n1331 because Plaintiffs have asserted claims against Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff alleging \nviolations of the Fair Housing Act as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 3601, et seq., the Civil Rights Act of \n1866, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986; and the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n4.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §§ 702-703 and 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331, 1361, and 2201. \n5.  This Court is authorized to award the requested declaratory and injunctive relief \nunder 5 U.S.C. §§ 702 and 706, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1361 and 2201-2202, and its inherent equitable \npowers. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 28   Filed 05/24/22   Page 4 of 15\n6.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(2) and 1391(e).  \nDefendants are United States agencies or officers sued in their official capacities. \n7.  The Plaintiffs and the City are residents of this judicial district, and a substantial \npart of the events or omissions giving rise to this case occurred within this district. \n8.  The City brings this action to redress harm to it, Plaintiffs, and the residents of the \nCity under 5 U.S.C. § 702 due to the policies and actions of HUD. \n9.  This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s’ state law claims under \n28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). \n10.  Because these Third-Party claims arise out of a common nucleus of operative fact \nand are so related to Plaintiffs’ original claims that they form part of the same case or \ncontroversy under, this Court also has supplemental jurisdiction over Defendant/Third-Party \nPlaintiff’s claims against the Third-Party Defendant under 28 U.S.C. §1367. \nADDITIONAL FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n11.  Plaintiffs, the Estate of Damon R. Fisher, et. al, filed this action against the City \nalleging among other things violations of the Fair Housing Act as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 3601, et \nseq., the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986; and the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution \n12.  Plaintiffs allege that the property conditions where DaMon Fisher resided was in \npoor condition containing mold and require repair and maintenance, and as a result, Mr. Fisher \ncontracted pulmonary disease and died.  \n13.  Plaintiffs allege that Mr. Fisher’s residence was in the poor condition because he \nwas African American and that because of his race and the race of HACA tenants are \ndiscriminated against and forced to live in poor conditions.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 28   Filed 05/24/22   Page 5 of 15\n14.  The property where Mr. Fisher resided is owned and operated by HACA. \n15.  Plaintiffs allege that the property conditions where Mr. Fisher resided are poor \nand require repair and maintenance, and as a result, they have suffered severe health issues.  \n16.  The properties complained of are owned by the Third-Party Defendant HACA, a \nPHA, who is responsible for the properties’ maintenance and management.  \n17.  HACA had a non-delegable contractual duty to Mr. Fisher to provide “decent, \nsafe, and sanitary” housing. \n18.  Plaintiffs allege that the poor property conditions should have been discovered by \nthe City that failed to inspect the properties and require HACA to make the required repairs. \n19.  HACA, like all other PHAs, operates under HUD’s control and direction.  \n20.  The Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S. § 1437 et seq., as amended by the Act, \nprovides that HUD is to fund PHAs and political subdivisions to help remedy unsafe and \nunsanitary housing conditions and the shortage of decent housing for low-income families.  42 \nU.S.C. § 1437a(b) (7). \n21.  Pursuant to the Act, HUD, and other regulations, HUD and PHAs enter into an \nACC.  \n22.  In accord with the ACC, HACA receives federal funding for the maintenance and \nmanagement of its properties.  The City contends that the Plaintiffs complained of conditions \nresult from the policies and actions of HUD and HACA in their failures to properly fund the \nproperties and HACA to maintain them in a safe and sanitary condition and not because of the \nCity. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 28   Filed 05/24/22   Page 6 of 15\n23.  The Housing Act requires HUD to use its funding to help the “states” and cities, \nincluding Maryland and the City, to remedy unsafe and unsanitary housing conditions and the \nshortage of decent housing for low-income families.   \n24.   The Housing Act directs HUD to establish standards for PHAs’ costs of \noperation and reasonable projections of income, taking into account the character and location of \nsuch PHAs as well as the characteristics of the families served or the costs of providing \ncomparable services as determined by a formula representing the operations of a prototype well-\nmanaged PHA.  \n25.  Under the HUD’s regulations and the ACC, HUD conducts an inspection of the \nHACA properties to assure compliance with the requirements that the properties are operated in \na decent, safe, and sanitary manner.  See U.S. Housing Act. 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(f)(3); ACC ¶ 14. \n26.  The ACC defines HACA’s obligations and responsibilities under the contract.  \nThe ACC states as its Mission that: \na.  HUD shall administer its Federal public housing program for the provision of \ndecent, safe, and sanitary housing to eligible families in accordance with the CACC and all \napplicable HUD Requirements.  HUD shall provide maximum responsibility and flexibility \nto HAs in making administrative decisions within all applicable statutes, executive orders, \nregulations and this ACC.  HUD shall provide annual contributions, in the form of grants, to \nthe HA in accordance with all applicable statutes, executive orders, regulations, and the \nCACC. \n  b.  The HA shall use Program Receipts to provide decent, safe, and sanitary housing for \neligible families in compliance with the Act and all HUD requirements.  HA shall at all times \ndevelop and operate public housing projects in a manner that promotes serviceability, \neconomy, efficiency, and stability of the projects, and the economic and social well-being of \nthe tenants.     \nACC at 1 Mission. \n27.  HUD conducts annual Public Housing Assessment System (“PHAS”) evaluation \nto assess HACA’s physical conditions, financial condition, management, and capital funding.  \nSee generally 24 C.F.R. Part 902.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 28   Filed 05/24/22   Page 7 of 15\n28.  Excessive deficiencies can lead to adverse consequences ranging from more \nfrequent inspections to the appointment of a receiver for PHAs like HACA.  24 C.F.R. §§ \n902.13, 902.73, 902.75, 902.83. \n29.  Every year, HUD inspects the living conditions at HACA through PHAS \ninspections and scores them.  See generally 24 C.F.R. Part 902.  \n30.  The result of a PHAS assessment/evaluation is a “PHAS score” of up to 100 \npoints.  24 C.F.R. § 902.9.  \n31.  A PHAs overall PHAS score determines whether the housing agency will be \ndesignated as a “high performer,” a “standard performer,” a “substandard performer,” or a \n“troubled performer.” 24 C.F.R. §§ 902.9, 902.11.  \n32.  HUD gives the most weight to the physical conditions’ component of PHAS \ninspections.  24 C.F.R. § 902.9.  \n33.  “The objective of the physical condition [assessment] is to determine whether a \n[public housing agency] is meeting the standard of decent, safe, sanitary housing in good repair.” \n24 C.F.R. § 902.20(a).  \n34.  HACA has been regularly placed on HUD’s troubled property list. \n35.  Even though HACA failed HUD’s inspections, HUD allowed HACA to continue \nmaintaining the properties with unsafe, unsanitary, and in poor conditions.  \n36.  HUD maintains the power to enforce HACA’s compliance to provide safe \nhousing, including taking the HACA property and placing it under receivership management.  \nSee ACC ¶ 14. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 28   Filed 05/24/22   Page 8 of 15\n37.  HUD has the power to declare a PHA in substantial default of its ACC and take \ncontrol of the PHA under the powers granted to the HUD Secretary under 42 U.S.C. § \n1437d(j)(3)(A)(ii), (C). \n38.  Because HUD empowers HACA to rent to low-income tenants in exchange for \nHUD’s funding, the City’s inspections could not prevent HACA from operating. \n39.  HUD has the authority to appoint a receiver to take over HACA and assure that \nthe properties are properly maintained, but the City does not have the same authority.  24 C.F.R. \n§§ 902.13, 902.73, 902.75, 902.83. \n40.  HUD has failed to enforce its non-delegable duty to assure that HACA provides \nthe HACA tenants with safe and sanitary housing. \n41.  HUD has allowed HACA to operate with deficit funding and not provide \nsufficient funds for safe and sanitary housing. \n42.  HUD has not provided the City with sufficient funds to assure that the HACA \nTenants and other city residents may live in decent, safe, and sanitary housing. \n43.  Because of the race and socioeconomic status of the HACA Tenants and other \nsimilar residents of the City, HUD has acted in a discriminatory manner exacerbating a housing \ncrisis in the City. \n44.  HACA operated under the deficit funding method, and HUD refused to approve \ncertain expenses necessary for adequate and efficient, safe, and sanitary public housing in the \nCity. \n45.  HUD has allowed HACA to maintain the housing units in an unsafe and \nunsanitary manner due to a) its discriminatory practices, and b) violations of the Housing Act \nand other laws. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 28   Filed 05/24/22   Page 9 of 15\n46.   Because of the race and economic levels of the HACA Tenants, HUD allowed \nHACA to avoid enforcement of HUD’s maintenance and inspection policy. \n47.  Because of the race and economic levels of the HACA Tenants, HUD allows \nHACA to continuously place City residents in its properties that were below the City’s and \nHUD’s standards. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \nCOUNT I \nVIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1437 et seq. \n \n48.  The City repeats and realleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth \nherein. \n49.  The Housing Act requires HUD to use its funding to help remedy unsafe and \nunsanitary housing conditions and the shortage of decent housing for low-income families.  42 \nU.S.C. § 1437a(b) (7). \n50.  The Housing Act provides that HUD must provide funds to assist States, State \npolitical subdivisions, and PHAs with sufficient funds to provide decent and safe housing free \nfrom unsafe conditions. \n51.  According to the Act, HUD, in addition to other regulations, controls PHAs \nthrough the ACC. \n52.  HUD’s policies and actions have failed to provide sufficient funding to the City \nand HACA to provide the HACA Tenants and other city residents similarly situated with decent \nand safe housing.  \n53.  As a result of HUD’s policies and actions, the Mr. Fisher, HACA Tenants and \nother city residents similarly situated, HACA, and the City are continuously harmed.  \n   \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 28   Filed 05/24/22   Page 10 of 15\nCOUNT II \n(Violation of Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq.) \n \n54.  The City repeats and realleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth \nherein. \n55.  HUD’s policy of insufficiently funding HACA and the City and its non-\nenforcement of its requirements for providing decent, safe, and sanitary housing constitutes a \nviolation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §3604 et seq., which makes it unlawful to \n“discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a \ndwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of race, \ncolor, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin.” \n56.  HUD’s policy of insufficiently funding HACA and the City, and its non-\nenforcement of its requirements for providing decent, safe and sanitary housing, inflicts \ndisproportionate harm on HACA Tenants and other City residents similarly situated.   \n57.  The disproportionate harm experienced by Mr. Fisher is the direct and immediate \nconsequence of HUD’s policy of non-enforcement of HUD regulations. \n58.  As a result of HUD’s aforementioned policies, HACA Tenants and other City \nresidents similarly situated were denied the opportunity to live in decent, safe, and sanitary \nhousing.  \n59.  HUD’s acts, policies, and practices constitute discrimination in violation of the \nFair Housing Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §3604, and its implementing regulations in that: \na.  HUD’s acts, policies, and practices have made and continue to make housing \nunavailable because of race in violation of 42 U.S.C. §3604(a).  Specifically, HUD \nregulations provide in pertinent part that “[i]t shall be unlawful, because of race [or] \nnational origin . . . to discourage or obstruct choices in a community, neighborhood or \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 28   Filed 05/24/22   Page 11 of 15\ndevelopment.” 24 C.F.R. § 100.70(a).  Such acts “include but are not limited to: (1) \nDiscouraging any person from inspecting, purchasing, or renting a dwelling . . . because \nof the race [or] national origin . . . of persons in a community, neighborhood or \ndevelopment.” 24 C.F.R. § 100.70(c)(1); and \nb.  HUD’s acts, policies, and practices provide different terms, conditions, and \nprivileges of rental housing based on race, violating 42 U.S.C. § 3604(b).  Specifically, \nHUD’s regulations implementing § 3604(b) specify that “[p]rohibited actions under this \nsection include, but are not limited to . . . failing or delaying maintenance or repairs of \nsale or rental dwellings” and “[l]imiting the use of privileges, services or facilities \nassociated with a dwelling” because of race or national origin.  24 C.F.R. § 100.65. \n60.  Additionally, HUD’s acts, policies, and practices perpetuate segregation in \nviolation of the Fair Housing Act, which is prohibited.  HUD’s regulations implementing the \nFair Housing Act state that “[a] practice has a discriminatory effect where it...creates, increases, \nreinforces or perpetuates segregated housing patterns because of race[.]” 24 C.F.R. § \n100.500(a). \n61.  Plaintiffs, HACA Tenants and other City residents similarly situated and the City \nare aggrieved persons as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 3602 (d) and (i) and have been and are \ncontinuously harmed by HUDs’ discriminatory conduct defined by 42 U.S.C. § 3602(f) and \nwho have been injured by HUD’s policies and actions. \nCOUNT III \n(Violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States) \n62.  The City repeats and realleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth \nherein. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 28   Filed 05/24/22   Page 12 of 15\n63.  HUD’s discriminatory practices, made in reckless or callous indifference or \ndisregard of its statutory and regulatory mandates, have deprived the Plaintiff, HACA Tenants \nand other City residents similarly situated, HACA, and the City, based on the race and color of \nthe Plaintiffs, HACA Tenants and others, of living in decent, safe and sanitary housing as that \nenjoyed by Caucasian persons in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  As a result of HUD’s \npolicies and actions, the Plaintiffs, HACA Tenants and other City residents similarly situated, \nHACA, and the City have been continuously harmed.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, the City asks this Court to issue an order and judgment: \nA.  Declaring, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, that HUD’s policy and actions in not \nproviding sufficient funds to the City and HACA to provide decent and safe housing for the \nHACA Tenants and other City residents similarly situated violate HUD’s responsibilities under \nthe applicable law. \nB.  Declaring, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, that HUD’s policy and actions in not \nexercising its authority to inspect and enforce its requirements for HACA to provide decent and \nsafe housing and not providing sufficient funds to the City and HACA to provide decent and safe \nhousing for the HACA Tenants and other City residents similarly situated violates HUD’s \nresponsibilities under the applicable law. \nC.  Declaring, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, that HUD acts arbitrary and capriciously \nwhen it chooses not to enforce PHAs like HACA to maintain their properties in a decent and safe \ncondition.  \nD.  Declaring, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, that any injuries claimed by the HACA \nTenants are a result of HUD policies and actions and not that of the City. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 28   Filed 05/24/22   Page 13 of 15\nE.  Declaring, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, that HUD’s policies and actions \ndiscriminate against the HACA Tenants and other City residents similarly situated due to their \nrace, color, and socioeconomic status, which prevent HUD from providing sufficient funding for \nand enforcing the requirements of the law that HUD provides decent and safe housing violates \nthe Fair Housing Act;  \nF.  Declaring, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, that HUD’s policies and actions \ndiscriminate against the HACA Tenants and other City residents similarly situated due to their \nrace, color, and socioeconomic status, which prevent HUD from providing sufficient funding for \nand enforcing the requirements of the law that HUD provides decent and safe housing violates \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to \nthe Constitution of the United States; \nG.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoining HUD from discriminating against the \nHACA Tenants and other City residents similarly situated, the City and HACA due to the race \nand color of the HACA Tenants and other City residents similarly situated. \nH.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoining HUD Defendants from imposing policies \nand taking actions that prohibit it from providing sufficient funds necessary for the City and \nHACA to provide decent and safe housing for HACA Tenants and other City residents similarly \nsituated;  \nI.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoining HUD Defendants from imposing policies \nand taking actions that prohibit it from enforcing its authority to cause HACA to provide decent \nand safe housing for HACA Tenants and other City residents similarly situated; and \nJ.  Granting any and all other relief the Court deems just and proper. \nCITY OF ANNAPOLIS \nOFFICE OF LAW   \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 28   Filed 05/24/22   Page 14 of 15\n \n \n            By:    /s/         \n              D.

Civil Action No. CCB-21-1120 \nV. \nCITY OF ANNAPOLIS \nMEMORANDUM \nNow pending is a motion to dismiss (or, in the alternative, for summary judgment) in a \nclass action against the City of Annapolis (\"the City\"). 1 The case concerns a longstanding City \npolicy of not inspecting and licensing public housing in Annapolis. Johnson is a putative class \naction brought by Annapolis public housing residents who argue that the City's non-inspection \npolicy violated their civil rights and had a disparate impact on African Americans; they allege \nviolations of the Fair Housing Act, federal civil rights laws, and state constitutional rights. \nThe City moved to dismiss or for summary judgment in Johnson (ECF 8, response at \nECF 9; reply at ECF 12; surreply at ECF 18). The matter has been fully briefed, and no oral \nargument is necessary. See Local Rule 105.6 (D. Md. 2021). For the reasons discussed herein, \nthe court will deny the City's motion. \nBACKGROUND \nIn ruling on a motion to dismiss, this Court \"accept[s] as true all well-pleaded facts in a \ncomplaint and construe[ s] them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\" Wikipedia Pound v. \n1  Another case before the court, Fisher v. City ofA  nnapolis et al., CCB-21-1074, featured similar briefing and is \nbeing decided separately but with substantially similar reasoning. \n1 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 19   Filed 03/30/22   Page 2 of 15\nNal 'l Sec. Agency, 857 F .3d 193, 208 ( 4th Cir. 2017) ( citing SD3, LLC v. Black & Decker (U SJ \nInc., 801 F.3d 412, 422 (4th Cir. 2015)). \nThe Johnson lawsuit follows the events of White v. City ofA  nnapolis, No. CCB-19-1442, \na 2019 case before this court in which 52 Annapolis public housing residents sued the City and \nthe Housing Authority of the City of Annapolis (HACA) under a variety of federal and state \ncauses of action. The White plaintiffs alleged that the City's decision not to enforce inspection \nand licensing requirements on public housing disparately impacted African Americans and was \ndiscriminatory. At the case's conclusion, the parties entered into a consent decree (ECF 98 in \nCCB-19-1442) enacting a number of prospective equitable remedies intended to improve public \nhousing, as well as paying monetary damages for the plaintiffs. \nPublic Housing Licensing and Inspections in Annapolis \nThe Annapolis City Code requires rental units to have operating licenses. (Annapolis City \nCode, Chapter 17.44.010). To obtain an operating license, the rental units must be inspected and \nin compliance with the City's Residential Property and Maintenance Code. (Id.  17.44.030 et seq.; \n,r,r \nECF 1  25-28). Landlords must pay a fee to obtain a license or a license renewal. (Annapolis \n,r \nCity Code, Chapter 17.44.040(A); see ECF 1  37). For many years, however, the City did not \nrequire inspections and licensing of HACA properties; such properties were the only rental \n,r \nproperties in Annapolis that are neither licensed nor inspected. (ECF 1  29). This apparently \nwas a longstanding arrangement, as although rental licenses have been required of landlords \nsince approximately 1985, HACA housing units had \"have never all been fully, finally, or \nproperly inspected and licensed in accordance with the City Code.\" (ECF 1 ,r 32). \nAccording to the plaintiffs, Annapolis has a troubled history of racism against African \nAmericans and people of African descent, including through discriminatory residential housing \n,r \npolicies. (ECF 1  22). The Johnson plaintiffs allege that the City's policies around licensing and \n2 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 19   Filed 03/30/22   Page 3 of 15\ninspecting Annapolis public housing is an instance of that discrimination and has a disparate \nimpact on African Americans. (ECF 1 ,i 22). HACA manages about 790 units housing about \n1,600 residents, spread ov~r six public housing developments. (ECF 1 ,i 22). Named plaintiff \nTamara Johnson lived in Harbor House, and fellow named plaintiff Tyonna Holliday lived in \nEastport Terrace. (ECF 1 ,i,i 4, 12) .. Census data suggest that these developments ( except for one \ndesignated for seniors and people with disabilities) house a significant-majority African \nAmerican population. (ECF 1 ,i,i 44-49). \nThe Annapolis City Code requires that rental units be licensed annually by the City, and \nunits must be inspected and found compliant with the City's maintenance code to obtain a \nlicense. (ECF 1 ,i,i 25-28; 35-37). When an inspector finds conditions dangerous to health or \nsafety, the landlord must relocate the tenant, remediate the danger, request a reinspection, and \nprovide other proof to the City inspector that the danger is no longer present. (ECF 1 ,i 30). \nAnnapolis has, since the early 1980s, emphasized the-important of licenses and inspections and \nwent so far as to obtain emergency state legislation to protect its regime from challengers who \nwished to evade the requirements. (ECF 1 ,i 24). \nBut leading up to the White suit, HACA properties managed solely by HACA were \nunique among Annapolis rentals in that they were neither licensed nor inspected by the City. \n(ECF 1 ,i 29). HACA did not apply for licenses in compliance with the City Code, and the City \ndid not act on this non-compliance. (ECF 1 ,i 29). State law also required that a housing \nauthority's housing projects are subject to the regulations applicable in that location, except that \na State public body may make exceptions to those regulations for a housing authority. (ECF 1 ,i,i \n33-34). \n3 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 19   Filed 03/30/22   Page 4 of 15\n2016 first inspections, 2017 non-inspection regime, 2019 Shadow Policy \nOn May 1, 2016, under Mayor Mike Pantelides, the City began an initial round of \ninspections of the HACA properties, revealing 2,498 City Code violations, many of which \npresented dangers to health and safety and should have required relocation. (ECF 1 ,i,i 38-:4-0). \nAfter that summer, the City conducted some follow-up inspections, but no HACA property was \nfully and properly licensed. (ECF 1 ,i 41 ). In 2017, newly appointed HACA Director Beverly \nWilbourn identified City inspections as a hurdle to her success in balancing the HACA budget \nand interpreted the City's inspection requirements as \"unfunded mandates.\" (ECF 1 ,i,i 51-52). \nIn summer 2017, Wilbourn advised a HACA board member that she had reached an \nunderstanding with the City Manager that the City would work out an alternative agreement on \ninspections, ultimately ordering a halt of all inspections starting in late August 2017. (ECF 1 ,i \n5 3 ). Then-Mayor Pan tel ides, an advocate of inspecting public housing, expressed frustration at \nHACA's resistance to treating public housing properties the same as private rental units. (ECF 1 \ni! 56). \nBut Annapolis would soon return to not inspecting public housing. Mayor Pantelides was \ndefeated a few months later in the November 2017 city election; even before new Mayor Gavin \nBuckley was seated, Wilbourn had discussed the inspection issue with him, with the City and \nHACA agreeing to stop inspections of HACA properties. (ECF 1 ,i 59). The only public evidence \nof the December 2017-May 2019 return to a non-inspection regime came w.hen HACA residents \ncalled the City to complain about issues in their apartments, and representatives explained that \nthe City no longer inspected the HACA properties. (ECF I ,r 60). In mid-May 2019, HACA and \nthe City were involved in a lawsuit against a HACA tenant, and at a hearing in the case, a city \ninspection worker testified that Mayor Buckley had decided to exempt HACA from the City's \nlicensing requirement; afterward, HACA's attorney sent an email thanking that employee for his \n4 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 19   Filed 03/30/22   Page 5 of 15\ntestimony on HACA's behalf and copying city officials, Mayor Buckley, and HACA Director \n,r \nWilbourn. (ECF 1  66). \nTwo days later, the White plaintiffs filed their suit, triggering swift, public-facing \ncommitments from the City government to adopt a June 2019 resolution that would restart \n,r \nHACA inspections and licensing. (ECF 1  67-68). Despite this resolution, HACA and City \nofficials together developed a policy - called the \"Shadow Policy\" by the Johnson plaintiffs -\nto conduct HACA inspections and licensing differently from other Annapolis rentals, for \nexample: awarding waivers and grandfathering old violations; inspecting for life safety issues \n,r \nonly; not denying licenses for deficiencies in routine maintenance. (ECF 1  69). The plaintiffs \nallege that this gutted the June 2019 City resolution restarting inspections and allowed the City \nand HACA to intentionally treat HACA tenants differently from similarly situated non-HACA \nAnnapolis renters, perpetuating segregation and hurting the plaintiffs' life, health, and safety \n,r \n(ECF 1  72, 76, 77). \nJohnson \n· The Johnson suit is a. putative class action suit defining the class as \"[a  ]11 individuals riow \nliving or who are or previously were tenants in Housing Authority properties within the two \n,r,r \nyears\" after May 7, 2019, excluding the White plaintiffs and a few other categories. (ECF 1 \n78, 79). \nThe first named plaintiff, Tamara Johnson, is an African American woman who lives in \nHarbour House with her children; her home had never beeri inspected between her 2017 move-in \n,r,r \nand the 2021 filing of the lawsuit. (ECF 1  4-5). The Johnsons deal with sewage leaks, \nwooden plywood floors in the bathroom after the tile cracked, rodent infestations, and mold \n,r,r \ngrowth; Johnson's daughter suffers from respiratory issues. (ECF I  5- 11 ). \n5 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 19   Filed 03/30/22   Page 6 of 15\nThe second named plaintiff, Tyonna Holliday, is an African American woman who lives \nin Eastport Terrace with her children. (ECF 1 ,r 12). Her unit has never been inspected during \n,r \nher residence there, from 2016 until at least the filing of the lawsuit. (ECF 1  14). The Holliday \nunit likewise suffers with mold growth, which HACA dealt with by wiping it with a rag and \npainting over it. (ECF 1 ,r 17). Holliday and one of her children suffer from asthma and \nbreathing issues worsened by the mold. (ECF 1 ,r 18). HACA officials also told Holliday that \n,r \nher apartment contains unsafe levels of lead. (ECF 1  19). \nThe suit brings the following counts against the City: \n,r,r \n•  Count I: Violation of Fair Housing Act (ECF 1  91-98) \n,r,r \n•  Count II: Violation of Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. § 1982 (ECF 1  99- 102) \n•  Count III: Violation of Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States \n,r,r \n(ECF 1  103-05) \n•  Count IV: Violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1985 Section 3, and the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United \n,r,r \nStates (ECF 1  106-08) \n•  Count V: Violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1986, and the Equal \n,r,r \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (ECF 1  109-12) \n•  Count VI: Violation of the Maryland State Constitution - Article 24 of the Maryland \n,r,r \nDeclaration of Rights (ECF 1  113- 16) \nLEGAL STANDARD \nTo survive a motion to dismiss, the factual allegations of a complaint \"must be enough to \nraise a right to relief above the speculative level on the assumption that all the allegations in the \ncomplaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\" Bell Atlantic Corp. v, Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 \n(2007) (internal citations omitted). \"To satisfy this standard, a plaintiff need not 'forecast' \nevidence sufficient to prove the elements of the claim. However, the complaint must allege \nsufficient facts to establish those elements.\" Walters v. McMahen, 684 F.3d 435,439 (4th Cir. \n2012) ( citation omitted). \"Thus, while a plaintiff does not need to demonstrate in a complaint \nthat the right to relief is 'probable,' the complaint must advance the plaintiffs claim 'across the \n6 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 19   Filed 03/30/22   Page 7 of 15\nline from conceivable to plausible.\"' Id.  (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Additionally, \nalthough courts \"must view the facts alleged in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,\" they \n\"will not accept 'legal conclusions couched as facts or unwarranted inferences, unreasonable \nconclusions, or arguments\"' in deciding whether a case should survive a motion to dismiss. US. \nex rel. Nathan v. Takeda Pharm. North Am., Inc., 707 F.3d 451,455 (4th Cir. 2013) \n(quoting Wag More Dogs, LLC v. Cozart, 680 F.3d 359, 365 (4th Cir. 2012)). \nANALYSIS \nThe City makes three arguments in its motion to dismiss Johnson. First, the City argues \nthat the Johnson class's claims are precluded as res judicata. Second, the City argues that the \nJohnson suit fails to include indispensable parties, including the White plaintiffs, plaintiffs' \ncounsel, HACA, and the federal housing department. Finally, the City argues that these suits are \nimpermissible collateral attacks on the White consent decree. In addition to these three main \narguments, the City accuses plaintiffs' counsel of unethical conduct, accusations this court \ndeclines to entertain because they are meritless.2 All arguments fail, and the City's motion to \ndismiss the Johnson suit will be denied. \nI.  Res Judicata \nThe Fourth Circuit has laid out the law of claim preclusion as follows: \n\"Under the doctrine of res judicata, or claim preclusion, '[a] final \njudgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their \nprivies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised \nin that action.\"' Pueschel v. United States, 369 F.3d 345, 354 (4th \nCir.2004) (quoting Federated Dep't Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S. \n394, 398 (1981)). Three elements must be satisfied for resjudicata \nto apply. \"[T]here must be: (1) a final judgment on the merits in a \nprior suit; (2) an identity of the cause of action in both the earlier \nand the later suit; and (3) an identity of parties or their privies in the \ntwo suits.\" Id. at 354-55. Along with these \"three formal elements\" \nof res judicata, \"two practical considerations should be taken into \n2  The City also threatened to file a third-party complaint against each of the 52 White plaintiffs and their attorney \n(who is also counsel in this case). This threat is wholly unjustified, and the court declines to consider it further. \n7 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 19   Filed 03/30/22   Page 8 of 15\naccount.\" Grausz v.  Englander, 321 F.3d 467, 473 (4th Cir.2003). \nFirst, we consider whether the party or its privy knew or should have \nknown of its claims at the time of the first action. See id. at 473-74. \nSecond, we ask whether the court that ruled in the first suit was an \neffective forum to litigate the relevant claims. See id. at 474. \nProvidence Hall Associates Limited Partnership v. Wells Fargo Bank, N A., 816 F.3d 273, 276 \n(4th Cir. 2016). \nThe City's argument as to claim preclusion is meritless. While the Johnson plaintiffs \nbenefit from the prospective injunctive relief laid out in the White Consent Decree, they did not \nreceive a single cent of the $900,000 in compensatory damages awarded to the White plaintiffs. \nNor were the White plaintiffs obligated to share those damages with any of the Johnson \nplaintiffs; those damages went specifically to the White plaintiffs in exchange for their release of \ntheir claims. White Consent Decree, No. l 9-cv-1442, ECF 98 ,i 42. The White plaintiffs were not \nin privity with the Johnson plaintiffs, and the White suit was not a class action with all the \nattendant class certification procedural safeguards. \nThe City also looks to the text of the consent decree, arguing that it covers \"The \nPlaintiffs, past and present residents of public housing\" and therefore that the Johnson plaintiffs \nhave no standing to bring their own claims but instead may only seek enforcement of the \nConsent Decree. White Consent Decree, No. l 9-cv-1442 at I. The City seems to read this quote \nas \"the plaintiffs and all past and present residents of public housing,\" but it is properly read as \n\"the plaintiffs, who are all past and present residents of public housing.\" The fact that the \nsentence from the Consent Decree continues \" ... initiated this action ...\"  raises questions as to \nthe support for the City's argument. \nFinally, the City invokes the Fourth Circuit's doctrine of virtual representation to argue \nthat the Johnson plaintiffs' interests were adequately represented by the White plaintiffs. See \nKlugh v.  United States, 818 F.2d 294,300 (4th Cir. 1987). The fact that these new plaintiffs seek \n8 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 19   Filed 03/30/22   Page 9 of 15\nmonetary damages neither sought nor awarded in the White suit belies the City's puzzling \nargument. \nIn sum: The Johnson plaintiffs were not parties to the White suit, nor were they and the \nWhite plaintiffs in privity. The City has offered no convincing legal theory under which the \nWhite plaintiffs could have released the City from the claims of non-parties without safeguards \nlike those offered by class actions. The Johnson claims are not precluded as res judicata. \nII.  Indispensable pa·rties \nThe City next contends that under Rule 12(b)(7) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \nthe Johnson plaintiffs have failed to join as indispensable parties the White plaintiffs, White \nplaintiffs' counsel, HACA, and the federal housing department. \nRule 12(b)(7) allows a court to dismiss an action for failure to join a party in accordance \nwith Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19. The court's analysis under a Rule 12(b)(7) motion to \ndismiss involves a two-step inquiry, of which only the first step is relevant in this case.3 Owens-\nIllinois, Inc. v. Meade, 186 F.3d 435, 440 ( 4th Cir. 1999). The court must determine whether the \nparty is necessary to the action. Id. Under Rule l 9(a), a party is necessary if \"in that person's \nabsence, the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties,\" or \"the person claims \nan interest relating to the subject of the action\" such that a disposition of the action in the \nperson's absence may \"(i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's. ability to protect \nthat interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of \nincurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the claimed \ninterest.\" Fed R. Civ. P.  l 9(a). \n3  The second step, analyzed only when a necessary party cannot be joined because its presence would destroy \ndiversity, asks whether the proceeding can continue in the absence of the necessary party or whether that party is \nindispensable pursuant to Rule l 9(b) and the action must therefore be dismissed. Owens-Illinois, Inc., 186 F.3d at \n440. This case does not rely on diversity jurisdiction. \n9 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 19   Filed 03/30/22   Page 10 of 15\n\"The inquiry contemplated by Rule 19(a) is a practical one, and is addressed to the sound \ndiscretion of the court.\" Heinrich v.  Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 532 F. Supp. 1348, 1359 (D. \nMd. 1982) ( citing Coastal Modular Corp. v. Laminators, Inc., 635 F.2d 1102, 1108 ( 4th Cir. \n1980)). \"Courts are loath to dismiss cases based on nonjoinder of a party, so dismissal will be \nordered only when the resulting defect cannot be remedied and prejudice or inefficiency will \ncertainly result.\" Owens-Illinois, Inc., 186 F.3d at 441. \nThe White plaintiffs are not necessary to this action, and the City's arguments are wholly \nwithout merit. When the White plaintiffs signed the consent decree in their case, they warranted \nthat they were \"entitled to enforce and settle the aforesaid claim and to give a full and complete \nrelease therefrom on behalf of herself and all interested parties.\" White Consent Decree, No. 19-\ncv-1442, ECF 98, 55. The City thinks that this means they were entitled to enforce and settle the \ncase on behalf of themselves and all interested parties, including non-parties not involved in the \nsuit. The City argues that when the White plaintiffs covenanted not to sue the city based on pre \nconsent-decree events, they were somehow also signing away the legal rights of any other non \nparty who might later come forward. Further, the City argues, because the 52 White plaintiffs \nrecovered financially for their damages, they are necessary parties - presumably as co \ndefendants - in the Johnson defendants' suit to recover for their own damages. These \narguments have no basis in the law. The court is capable of according complete relief for the \nJohnson plaintiffs' alleged damages even without the White plaintiffs' presence, and there is no \nrisk of duplicative or inconsistent damages where any monetary damages awarded would go only \nto the suits' plaintiffs for their damages. \nNor is it necessary to have as a party the White plaintiffs' counsel, P. Joseph Donahue, \nwho is also plaintiffs' counsel in the Johnson suit. In the City's understanding, when the White \nplaintiffs' attorney signed the consent decree in the course of his representation of the White \n10 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 19   Filed 03/30/22   Page 11 of 15\nplaintiffs, he was promising that he would also not serve as counsel in any future suits against the \nCity arising from these events. Mr. Donahue was not a party to the White lawsuit or consent \ndecree, and he is not a necessary party in either of these lawsuits. \nNor are HUD and HACA necessary parties. The White plaintiffs dropped HACA as a \n· defendant with their amended complaint, but they were still able to litigate the suit to resolution. \nSee White, No. 19-cv-1442, Am. Compl., ECF 8-1 at 3. And HUD never was a party to the White \nsuit. If the City wishes to join HACA and HUD as cross-defendants, the City remains free to file \nappropriate motions. But the plaintiffs - especially against the backdrop of the successful White \nconsent decree - could quite plausibly achieve complete relief in the form of monetary damages \neven in HACA's absence. The suits need not be dismissed as violating Rule 19. \nIII.  Impermissible collateral attack \nThe City argues that the suit is an impermissible collateral attack on the White Consent \nDecree, which would heed to be reassessed to provide relief (for example, monetary damages) to \nthe Johnson plaintiffs. This is incorrect, and Johnson is not an attempt to appeal from or appeal \nthe consent decree. The City does not point to any plausible language in the consent decree that \nbinds nonparties from suing for damages. \nFurther, the City argues that the Johnson plaintiffs were obligated to intervene in White. \nOnce again, the Johnson plaintiffs were not privy to the White record and were under no \nobligation to intervene, even if that intervention would have been by right. White was not a class \naction; the White moqetary payments went only to the White plaintiffs, and that settlement is not \nunder attack in Johnson. Johnson need not be thrown out as impermissible collateral attacks. \n11 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 19   Filed 03/30/22   Page 12 of 15\nIV.  Statute of Limitations \nThe City's reply (ECF 12) raises the issue of statutes oflimitations to argue that claims in \nJohnson cannot be based on the City's actions before the White Consent Decree. (ECF 12 at 13-\n14). These claims will not be dismissed as untimely at this stage oflitigation. \nThe § 1986 action.f or neglect to prevent a civil rights conspiracy requires a wrongful act \nafter May 1, 2020 ( one year); the Fair Housing Act claim requires a wrongful act after May 1, \n2019 (two years); and the rest of the claims require a wrongful act after May 1, 2018 (three \nyears). The City argues that Johnson moved into her apartment (which had never been inspected \nduring her tenancy) in 2017, and 2017 was more than three years before the lawsuit was filed -\nmeaning that the May 2021 suit is untimely. \nAt issue here is which of three ways this court will understand the factual predicates \nunderlying the suit: as continuing effects of an initial violation; as a continuing violation that is \npart of a single, ongoing pattern of discrimination and allows consideration of otherwise time \nbarred events; or as a discrete act of discrimination that starts the clock anew. The \"continuing \nharm\" or \"continuing violation\" doctrine tolls the statute of limitations. Litz v. Maryland Dept. of \nEnv't, 76 A.3d 1076, 1089 (Md. 2013). This allows the consideration of facts that are outside the \nstrict statute of limitations period before the filing of the lawsuit, because the continuing \nwrongful act within the period is an extension of the wrong outside the period. But if only the \ncontinuing ill effects of prior tortious acts - rather than new or continuing tortious acts - occur \nwithin the limitations period, then the case presents not a continuing violation but rather a \n\"continuing effect\" or \"continuing injury,\" which does not toll the statute oflimitations.4 \n4  Recovery would be limited to damages incurred within the statute of limitations period. ''Although an action for a \ncontinuing tort may not be barred by the statute of limitations, damages for such causes of action are limited to \nthose occurring within the three year period prior to the filing of the action.\" Litz, 76 A.3d at 1089 (internal quotes \nomitted). \n12 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 19   Filed 03/30/22   Page 13 of 15\nMacBride v. Pishvaian, 937 A.2d 233, 240 (Md. 2007) abrogated in part by Litz, 76 A.3d at \n1076. Finally, the court might understand the events at issue as a discrete and independently \ndiscriminatory act. \"When an individual engages in a series of acts each of which is intentionally \ndiscriminatory, then a fresh violation takes place when each act is committed ... [and] each \ndiscriminatory act starts a new clock for filing charges alleging that act[.]\" Hill v. Hampstead \nLester Morton Court Partners LP, 581 Fed. App'x 178, 180-81 (4th Cir. 2014) (cleaned up) \n(finding that the most recent denial of a request for a disability accommodation was its own \ndiscrete act of discrimination allowing for a timely suit, even though the first denials of requests \nfor that same accommodation occurred outside the limitations period). Even if the plaintiff \nrenews a request for a previously denied action, that plaintiff may sue based on the new \"discrete \nact\" of discrimination if the defendant again denies the request. Id.  at 181. \nThe City's briefing on the statute of limitations issue (ECF 12 at 13- 14) is thin, as is the \nplaintiffs' surreply on the issue (ECF 18 at 4-5). The City has raised no arguments challenging \nthe effects of the original non-inspection policy or the Shadow Policy on the named plaintiffs, \ninstead arguing that the only violation possible was in 2017, when Johnson moved into Harbor \nHouse. The plaintiffs allege that the Shadow Policy was in effect as of the May 2021 filing of \nJohnson; regardless, neither named plaintiffs unit had been inspected as of that date. This court \nwill not find that the non-inspection policy and the Shadow Policy (two forms of an allegedly \ndiscriminatory City policy that allegedly resulting in the non-inspection of the plaintiffs' homes) \nwere mere continuing effects of one single 2017 violation. \"While facts may arise at a later stage \nthat indicate\" otherwise, it is not apparent on the face of the Complaint that the action is barred \nby the statute oflimitations. Litz, 76 A.3d at 1091-92, 1090 (noting that the \"case has not yet \nbeen presented to a trier of fact to determine whether the only [w  rongful acts happened within \nthe statute of limitations period], and the fact-finder has not had an opportunity to determine if \n13 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 19   Filed 03/30/22   Page 14 of 15\nthe wrongful acts] were ongoing\"). At this stage, the federal and state civil rights claims will not \nbe dismissed as untimely. \nThe two-year-limited FHA claim (Count I) deserves special consideration. The FHA \nexpressly announces that the period commences \"after the occurrence of termination of an \nalleged discriminatory housing practice.\" 42 U.S.C. 3613(a)(l). Noting that the policy reasons \nfor limiting the time to sue over discrete acts of discrimination are different from those \nchallenging ongoing housing practices, the Supreme Court remarked: \"we .. . conclude that \nwhere a plaintiff, pursuant to the Fair Housing Act, challenges not just one incident of conduct \nviolative of the Act, but an unlawful practice that continues into the limitations period, the \ncomplaint is timely when it is filed within [two years] of the last asserted occurrence of that \npractice.\" Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 380-81 (1982) (modified to update \nstatute of limitations after change from 180 days to two years); see, e.g., National Fair Housing \nAlliance v. Bank ofA  merica, NA., 401 F. Supp. 3d 619, 629-30 (D. Md. 2019). The original \nnon-inspection policy continued until June 2019, less than two years before the May 2021 filing \nof this suit. The FHA claim is therefore timely. \nV.  Local Government Tort Claims Act \nFinally, the City's reply (ECF 12) argues that because the White Consent Decree's \ndamages payouts exceeded the Local Government Tort Claims Act's (LGTCA's) damages cap,5 \n\"there can be no further damages arising out of the City or HACA's tortious conduct related to \nthe same operative facts as White under Maryland law.\" (ECF 12 at 14-15). The plaintiffs, \nmeanwhile, argue that the LGTCA does not apply to federal civil rights claims, particularly \nbecause a state tort damages cap operates via sovereign immunity, which it cannot assert against \n5  The cap is $400,000 per individual claim, and $800,000 per total claims arising \"from the same occurrence for \ndamages resulting from tortious acts or omissions.\" Md. Code Ann., CJP § 5-303(a)(1) (West 2022). \n14 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01120-CCB   Document 19   Filed 03/30/22   Page 15 of 15\nfederal claims. (ECF 18 at 5). Local governments lack immunity from tort liability for violations \nof federal constitutional or statutory rights. Housing Authority ofB  altimore City v. Bennett, 754 \nA.2d 367, 369 (Md. 2000) (citing DiPino v. Davis, 729 A.2d 354, 368-69 (Md. 1999)), rev 'din \npart on other grounds, Espina v. Jackson, 112 A.3d 442, 453-54 (Md. 2015) (noting 2001 state \nlegislation responding to Bennett and declining to distinguish between state constitutional tort \nclaims and state non-constitutional tort claims in the applicability of the LGTCA damages cap). \nThe LGTCA cap will therefore apply only to the Johnson class's state law claim (count VI) but \nnot to the federal claims ( counts I-V). The interaction of the White Consent Decree and the \nLGTCA's damages cap need not be determined at this time. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons discussed herein, the City's motion to dismiss will be denied. A separate \nOrder follows. \n{'cf> \nCatherine C. Blake \nUnited States District Judge \n15 ",
