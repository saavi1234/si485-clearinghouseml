    "summary": "<p>On February 19, 2020, the main plaintiff filed a complaint against the city of San Jose in the US Court for the Northern District of California alleging that the City failed to build sufficient curb ramps for people with mobility disabilities. Plaintiff is a wheelchair user who has lived in San Jose all his life, and has encountered numerous obstacles in moving around the city, including a non-flush transition at the bottom of a curb ramp in 2017 that caused his wheelchair to tip over and for him to lie on the street for ten minutes. He argued that the city's failure to build sufficient curb ramps at city sidewalks and other pedestrian infrastructure in the city violated Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and California state statutes that were analogous with the latter, namely California Government Code &sect; 11135 and California Civil Code &sect; 54. Plaintiff sought to represent a class of people with mobility disabilities who use or will use the pedestrian right of way in the city. He sought a permanent injunction requiring the City to take remedial measures to repair and maintain curb ramps, and to ensure that all new construction is in accordance with ADA requirements. The case was assigned to US Magistrate Judge Nathaniel Cousins.</p>\r\n<p>On April 21, 2020, the parties jointly filed a motion for approval of a settlement agreement. The settlement proposed a settlement class of all persons (including residents of and/or visitors to the City of San Jose) with any mobility disability who, at any time prior to the Court granting final approval of the Consent Decree, had been denied full and equal access to the City&rsquo;s pedestrian right of way due to the lack of a curb ramp or a curb ramp that was damaged, in need of repair, or otherwise in a condition not suitable or sufficient for use. Per the agreement, the City agreed to commit 13 million dollars each year to the construction of new curb ramps&nbsp; and maintenance of the old ones, as well as to institute a system through which mobility impaired citizens could request the construction of new curb ramps or the remediation of existing ramps. Finally, the proposed settlement also included a mandatory reporting period through at least 2038. The settlement also included a damages payment to the main plaintiff of $50,000.</p>\r\n<p>On May 27, 2020, US Magistrate Judge Nathaniel Cousins issued an order certifying the settlement class without modifications and approving the settlement agreement. The court also approved the payment of attorneys' fees.</p>\r\n<p>The case was closed on September 2, 2020.</p>",

The parties entered into settlement negotiations and concluded them quickly, issuing a motion for settlement to the judge on April 21, 2020. The settlement was mostly injunctive in nature, assigning 13 million USD per year to the maintenance of existing curb ramps and the construction of new ones, but did include attorney's fees for Lashbrook and a damages payment. The judge approved the conditions of the settlement on May 27, 2020, and the case was officially closed on September 2, 2020.",

Plaintiff Artie Lashbrook, on behalf of himself and all other persons similarly situated, \n2  complains of Defendant City of San Jose (“Defendant” or “the City”) and alleges as follows: \n3  INTRODUCTION \n4  2.  Plaintiff brings this lawsuit against the City to redress its systemic and ongoing failure \n5  to provide full and equal access to its pedestrian right of way to Plaintiff and similarly situated \n6  individuals with mobility disabilities.  As alleged further below, the City has failed and continues to \n7  fail to construct and maintain curb ramps that are necessary to make its pedestrian right of way readily \n8  accessible to people with mobility disabilities, and to comply with its obligation to construct and/or \n9  remediate curb ramps when it engages in alterations or new construction of streets, roadways, \n10  sidewalks, and other pedestrian walkways.  A substantial number of the street crossings within the \n11  City’s pedestrian right of way do not comply with applicable state and federal regulations addressing \n12  accessibility for people with mobility disabilities because, for example, they lack curb ramps entirely, \n13  have curb ramps that are not contained within crosswalks, or have curb ramps that are too narrow, \n14  steep, cracked, broken, or uplifted to be used by people with mobility disabilities. \n15  3.  The City’s pedestrian right of way is a fundamental public program, service, and/or \n16  activity that the City provides for the benefit of its residents and visitors.  Accessible curb ramps are \n17  necessary to permit people with mobility disabilities to access the City’s pedestrian right of way.  \n18  Because the City’s pedestrian right of way constitutes a core mode of transportation, the absence of \n19  accessible curb ramps prevents people with mobility disabilities from independently, fully, and \n20  meaningfully participating in all aspects of society, including employment, housing, education, \n21  transportation, public accommodations, and recreation, among others.  Accordingly, an accessible \n22  pedestrian right of way is essential to realizing the integration mandate of disability non-discrimination \n23  laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq.; Section 504 \n24  of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, et seq., California Government Code § 11135 \n25  (“Section 11135”), and California Civil Code § 54 (“Disabled Persons Act” or “DPA”). \n26  4.  Plaintiff Artie Lashbrook is an individual with a mobility disability who brings this \n27  action on behalf of himself and all persons with mobility disabilities who, like Plaintiff, live in, work \n28  in, or visit San Jose.  Plaintiff, and other similarly situated persons with mobility disabilities, are being \n  1 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - CASE NO. 5:20-CV-1236  \n753 916.14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 1   Filed 02/19/20   Page 3 of 25\n \n1  denied full and equal access to the City’s pedestrian right of way and subjected to unlawful or \n2  hazardous conditions due to the absence of accessible curb ramps within the City’s pedestrian right of \n3  way. \n4  5.  Federal and state disability access laws were enacted to provide persons with disabilities \n5  an equal opportunity to participate fully in civic life.  See 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7) (ADA); 29 U.S.C. \n6  § 794 (Section 504); Section 11135; Cal. Civil Code § 54.  Under the ADA and Section 504, a public \n7  entity’s sidewalks, crosswalks, and paved paths—collectively referred to as a public entity’s \n8  “pedestrian right of way”—are a “program,” “service,” or “activity” that must be readily accessible to \n9  persons with mobility disabilities.  Barden v. City of Sacramento, 292 F.3d 1073, 1076 (9th Cir. 2002).  \n10  As detailed further below, Defendant has excluded Plaintiff and all other similarly situated individuals \n11  with mobility disabilities from participation in or the benefits of Defendant’s pedestrian right of way \n12  program, service, or activity, or subjected them to discrimination by:  a) failing to construct and \n13  remediate curb ramps (i) in newly-constructed or altered portions of the City’s pedestrian right of way, \n14  and (ii) at crossings adjacent to newly constructed or altered roadways; and, b) failing to construct, \n15  remediate and maintain curb ramps where necessary to provide people with mobility disabilities \n16  meaningful access to (i) the City’s pedestrian right of way, when viewed in its entirety, and (ii) \n17  facilities in which City programs, services, and activities are made available to the public. \n18  6.  The ADA (since January 27, 1992), Section 504 (since June 3, 1977), and Section \n19  11135 (since June 24, 1980) have all mandated that whenever a government entity newly constructs or \n20  alters streets, roads, or highways, it must construct curb ramps at any intersection having curbs or other \n21  barriers to entry from a street level pedestrian walkway, to ensure that newly constructed or altered \n22  pedestrian right of way programs and facilities are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with \n23  disabilities.  28 C.F.R. § 35.151(a)(1), (b)(1), (b)(4)(i)(1), (b)(4)(i)(2); 28 C.F.R. pt. 36, app. D § \n24  10.2.1; 45 C.F.R. § 84.23(b); 36 C.F.R. pt. 1191, app. D § 810.2.3; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2 §§ 11197 & \n25  11198.  The ADA, Section 504, and Section 11135 also mandate that a public entity operate each \n26  program, service, or activity so that the program, service, or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is \n27  readily accessible to and usable by individuals with mobility disabilities.  28 C.F.R. § 35.150(a), \n28  (b)(1); 45 C.F.R. § 84.22(a), (b); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2 § 11191(a).  To the extent structural changes \n  2 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - CASE NO. 5:20-CV-1236  \n753 916.14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 1   Filed 02/19/20   Page 4 of 25\n \n1  were necessary to achieve this “program access” mandate with respect to facilities existing as of the \n2  effective date of the ADA, Section 504, or Section 11135, such changes were to have been made by no \n3  later than January 26, 1995 under the ADA, no later than June 3, 1980 under Section 504, and no later \n4  than June 24, 1983 under Section 11135.  28 C.F.R. § 35.150(c); 45 C.F.R. § 84.22(d); Cal. Code \n5  Regs. tit. 2 § 11194. \n6  7.  The City’s pedestrian right of way, when viewed in its entirety, is not readily accessible \n7  to and usable by persons with mobility disabilities due to the City’s failure to construct and maintain \n8  accessible curb ramps.  The City has also failed to construct and maintain accessible curb ramps \n9  necessary to allow persons with mobility disabilities to access facilities where City programs, services, \n10  and activities are provided to the public.  In addition, the City has failed to construct accessible curb \n11  ramps or remediate existing curb ramps as part of new construction or alterations of its pedestrian \n12  walkways, streets, roadways, and highways.  As a result, Plaintiff and other persons with mobility \n13  disabilities must forgo participation in daily activities — including visiting public facilities, places of \n14  public accommodation, or friends — or risk injury to themselves and/or damage to their mobility \n15  devices by traveling on or around inaccessible portions of the pedestrian right of way.  At times, \n16  Plaintiff and other individuals with mobility disabilities are able to use the pedestrian right of way, but \n17  only by taking circuitous routes to avoid barriers to accessibility, which wastes their time and energy.  \n18  As a result of the many missing and noncompliant curb ramps in the City, people with mobility \n19  disabilities do not have full and equal access to the pedestrian right of way. \n20  8.  The denial of meaningful, equal, and safe access to the City’s pedestrian right of way \n21  for persons with mobility disabilities complained of herein is the direct result of Defendant’s policies, \n22  procedures, and practices with regard to pedestrian walkways and disability access, including, but not \n23  limited to the following: \n24  a.  The failure to construct accessible curb ramps at locations where no curb ramps \n25  exist, or where inaccessible curb ramps exist, within the time required by applicable state and federal \n26  disability access laws or on any other reasonable schedule; \n27 \n28 \n  3 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - CASE NO. 5:20-CV-1236  \n753 916.14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 1   Filed 02/19/20   Page 5 of 25\n \n1  b.  The failure to construct accessible curb ramps, or remediate existing \n2  noncompliant curb ramps, at street corners or sidewalks that are newly constructed, resurfaced or \n3  otherwise altered; \n4  c.  The failure to construct accessible curb ramps at intersections in the City that are \n5  necessary to provide meaningful, equal, and safe access to the pedestrian right of way; \n6  d.  The failure to develop and implement a process for identifying intersections and \n7  corners throughout the City at which curb ramps are necessary to provide meaningful, equal, and safe \n8  access to the pedestrian right of way; \n9  e.  The failure to adopt and utilize or require and enforce the utilization of curb \n10  ramp designs that comply with applicable federal and state design standards or guidelines; \n11  f.  The failure to construct accessible curb ramps within a reasonable time frame \n12  after receiving a request to do so or otherwise being notified of the need for an accessible curb ramp at \n13  a particular location; \n14  g.  The failure to adopt or implement reasonable administrative methods, policies, \n15  and procedures for inspecting, repairing, and maintaining the pedestrian right of way, including curb \n16  ramps, as required by Title II of the ADA and its implementing regulations such as 28 C.F.R. § 35.133 \n17  (maintenance of accessible features); \n18  h.  The failure to remediate corners with no curb ramps or with curb ramps that are \n19  not properly positioned such that they require pedestrians with mobility disabilities to travel outside of \n20  crosswalks or designated pedestrian street crossings in order to access pedestrian rights of way; \n21  i.  The failure to remediate curb ramps that are designed and/or constructed in a \n22  noncompliant manner such that people with mobility disabilities are denied meaningful access to the \n23  pedestrian right of way as a whole.  These deficiencies often include one or more of the following: \n24  i.  Running, cross, and side slopes of curb ramps that are excessively steep; \n25  ii.  Ramps that are too narrow to accommodate wheelchairs or scooters; \n26  iii.  Landings at the top of curb ramps that do not provide enough space for a \n27  wheelchair to maneuver onto or off the ramp, forcing persons with mobility disabilities to use the \n28  much steeper side flares or roll off the sidewalk entirely; \n  4 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - CASE NO. 5:20-CV-1236  \n753 916.14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 1   Filed 02/19/20   Page 6 of 25\n \n1  iv.  Excessive counter slopes at the bottoms of curb ramps.  The combination \n2  of excessive curb ramp slopes and/or gutter pan counter slopes often forces wheelchair users to scrape \n3  the paving with their foot rests and can bring a wheelchair or scooter to a full stop, creating risks of \n4  falling and injury; \n5  v.  Lips at the bottom of curb ramps where the ramp meets the gutter.  Such \n6  non-flush transitions create additional risks of scraping the pavement and/or sudden stops and possible \n7  falls and injury.  Federal disability access standards have required smooth transitions at the base of \n8  curb ramps for several decades; and \n9  vi.  Obstacles in the path of curb ramps, such as utility and traffic signal \n10  poles, which prevent the curb ramps from being accessed.  \n11  9.  These administrative methods, policies, and practices, or lack thereof, discriminate \n12  against persons with mobility disabilities by denying them access to the City’s pedestrian right of way \n13  in its entirety, as well as facilities in which City programs, services, and activities are made available to \n14  the public.  As of January 2019, 21,068 curb ramps, or 88% of all curb ramp within the City, were non-\n15  compliant with applicable standards.  Moreover, 6,772 locations within the City where curb ramps are \n16  required lack curb ramps. \n17  10.  For decades, Defendant has failed to meet ADA, Section 504, and California state \n18  accessibility requirements, and failed to adopt and implement systemic efforts to ensure that the City’s \n19  pedestrian right of way is readily accessible to and useable by persons with mobility disabilities.  The \n20  City failed to do a comprehensive survey and self-evaluation of its curb ramps and was not following \n21  its Transition Plan regarding curb ramps.  This lawsuit seeks a court order requiring the City to finally \n22  comply with these laws and to provide people with mobility disabilities meaningful access to the \n23  City’s pedestrian right of way over 25 years after the enactment of the ADA, over 40 years after \n24  enactment of Section 504’s disability rights protections, and nearly 40 years after the enactment of \n25  California’s disability rights protections. \n26  11.  Plaintiff thus brings this action to remedy violations of Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § \n27  12131, et seq., and its accompanying regulations, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § \n28  794, et seq. and its accompanying regulations, California Government Code § 11135, et seq. and its \n  5 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - CASE NO. 5:20-CV-1236  \n753 916.14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 1   Filed 02/19/20   Page 7 of 25\n \n1  accompanying regulations.  Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief pursuant to the above statutes and an award \n2  of reasonable attorneys’ fees, expenses, and costs under applicable law. \n3  12.  On February 24, 2014, Plaintiff approached the City to resolve this dispute through \n4  structured negotiations, rather than litigation.  On March 28, 2014, the parties entered into an \n5  agreement to toll the statute of limitations while the parties engaged in structured negotiations.   \n6  13.  On February 1, 2017, the parties entered into an Interim Settlement Agreement that set \n7  forth certain preliminary obligations that the parties fulfilled while they continued to negotiate toward \n8  a full resolution of this dispute.  The Interim Settlement Agreement required the City to complete a \n9  survey of all curb ramps and corners of sidewalk segments at pedestrian crossings within the City’s \n10  pedestrian right of way for compliance with applicable federal and state disability access standards. \n11  14.  Following the completion of the comprehensive curb ramp survey, the parties \n12  negotiated and finalized a Consent Decree that fully resolves Plaintiff’s class claims for injunctive \n13  relief.  Accordingly, Plaintiff files this action with the intention of submitting the proposed Consent \n14  Decree to the Court for preliminary approval, seeking authorization from the Court to provide notice of \n15  the class action settlement to the class, and then requesting an order from the Court granting final \n16  approval to the proposed Consent Decree. \n17  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n18  15.  This is an action for injunctive relief, brought pursuant to Title II of the ADA, 42 \n19  U.S.C. §§ 12101 to 12213, Section 504, 29 U.S.C. § 794, et seq., California Government Code § \n20  11135, et seq., and California Civil Code § 54, et seq., to redress systemic civil rights violations \n21  against individuals with mobility disabilities by the City of San Jose. \n22  16.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 for \n23  claims arising under the ADA and Section 504. \n24  17.  This Court has jurisdiction to issue injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and \n25  2202, and Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n26  18.  Under the doctrines of pendent and supplemental jurisdiction, this Court has jurisdiction \n27  over the claims arising under California’s Section 11135 and the Disabled Person’s Act.  28 U.S.C. § \n28  1367. \n  6 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - CASE NO. 5:20-CV-1236  \n753 916.14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 1   Filed 02/19/20   Page 8 of 25\n \n1  19.  Venue over Plaintiff’s claims is proper in the Northern District of California, San Jose \n2  Division because Defendant resides in the Northern District of California within the meaning of 28 \n3  U.S.C. § 1391, and because the events, acts, and omissions giving rise to Plaintiff’s claims occurred in \n4  the San Jose Division of the Northern District of California. \n5  PARTIES \n6  20.  Named Plaintiff Artie Lashbrook is a resident of the City of San Jose.  Plaintiff \n7  Lashbrook has a mobility disability and uses a wheelchair for mobility.  Plaintiff Lashbrook is a \n8  “qualified person with a disability” and a person with “a disability” within the meaning of all \n9  applicable statutes and regulations including 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2), 28 C.F.R. § 35.104, 29 U.S.C. § \n10  705(20)(B), and California Government Code § 12926. \n11  21.  The Plaintiff class consists of all persons with mobility disabilities who use or will use \n12  the pedestrian right of way in the City of San Jose through the date of judgment in this action. \n13  22.  Hereafter, references in this document to “Plaintiff” shall be deemed to include the \n14  Named Plaintiff and each member of the class, unless otherwise indicated. \n15  23.  Presently, and at all times relevant to this complaint, Defendant City of San Jose has \n16  been a public entity within the meaning of Title II of the ADA, has received federal financial \n17  assistance within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 sufficient to invoke its coverage, and \n18  has received state financial assistance within the meaning of California Government Code § 11135. \n19  24.  The City is a local government entity with the responsibility of providing Plaintiff with \n20  access to its public facilities, programs, services, and activities.  The City is responsible for \n21  constructing, maintaining, repairing, and regulating its pedestrian right of way. \n22  FACTS APPLICABLE TO ALL CLAIMS \n23  25.  As a result of Defendant’s policies and practices with regard to curb ramps in the City’s \n24  pedestrian right of way, people with mobility disabilities have been discriminated against and denied \n25  full and equal access to the benefits of the City’s pedestrian right of way program or service, and to \n26  facilities in which City programs, services, and activities are made available to the public. \n27  26.  Hereafter, an “Inaccessible” curb ramp shall refer to a curb ramp that did not comply \n28  with applicable standards for accessible design (i.e., the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards \n  7 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - CASE NO. 5:20-CV-1236  \n753 916.14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 1   Filed 02/19/20   Page 9 of 25\n \n1  (“UFAS”), 1991 ADA Standards for Accessible Design (“ADAAG”), the 2010 ADA Standards for \n2  Accessible Design (“2010 ADAS”), or the applicable version of the California Building Code \n3  (“CBC”)), at the time it was constructed or altered. \n4  27.  Across the City, there are thousands of locations where curb ramps are required but are \n5  missing.  And even where curb ramps exist, many are improperly constructed and/or maintained, lack a \n6  flush transition to the street, have excessively steep running, cross, and side slopes, are too narrow, \n7  lack required clear space and top and bottom landings, and/or are otherwise noncompliant.  Many other \n8  curb ramps are not maintained; they are broken, cracked, crumbled, sunken, and/or caved. \n9  28.  As a result of Defendant’s policies and practices with regard to curb ramps, large \n10  segments of the City’s pedestrian right of way do not comply with disability access requirements for \n11  new construction or alterations.  For example, prior to 2006, the City consistently failed to construct \n12  curb ramps and remediate existing curb ramps when it altered or constructed sidewalks and streets. \n13  29.  Defendant has failed to construct, remediate, repair, and maintain curb ramps as \n14  required by law.  From approximately January 2017 through March 2018, the City conducted a \n15  comprehensive survey of existing curb ramps and curb ramp locations within the City.  The survey was \n16  the result of the parties’ structured negotiation and required by the Parties’ Interim Settlement \n17  Agreement.  The survey revealed that there are 23,990 existing curb ramps within the City.  As of \n18  January 2019, 21,068 curb ramps, or 88% of all curb ramps within the City, were non-compliant with \n19  applicable standards.  14,611 of those non-compliant curb ramps contain “High Priority Curb Ramps \n20  Barriers.”  “High Priority Curb Ramps Barriers” include the following: 1) missing curb ramps; 2) curb \n21  ramps with less than 32 inches clear width; 3) curb ramps with running slows exceeding 10%; 4) curb \n22  ramps with cross slopes exceeding 4%; 5) curb ramps with non-flush transitions; 6) curb ramps with \n23  counter slopes exceeding 10%; 7) curb ramps with side flare slopes exceeding 12.5%; 8) curb ramps \n24  with side flare slopes exceeding 10% where top landings are not provided; 9) curb ramps with gaps or \n25  vertical edges greater than 1 inch; 10) parallel curb ramps with bottom landings that have slopes \n26  exceeding 4%; 11) parallel curb ramps with top landings that have slopes exceeding 4%; 12) parallel \n27  curb ramps with top landings that have running slopes exceeding 10%; 13) curb ramps with a \n28  combination of non-compliant running slopes, counter slopes, and non-flush transitions.  There were \n  8 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - CASE NO. 5:20-CV-1236  \n753 916.14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 1   Filed 02/19/20   Page 10 of 25\n \n1  an additional 6,457 curb ramps within the City that do not comply with federal and state accessibility \n2  standards, but are not defined as “High Priority Curb Ramps Barriers.”  Moreover, there were 6,772 \n3  locations within the City where curb ramps are required but are missing. \n4  30.  As a result of the many missing and noncompliant curb ramps at intersections \n5  throughout the City, the pedestrian right of way, viewed in its entirety, is inaccessible to persons with \n6  mobility disabilities.  Plaintiffs and others with mobility disabilities are denied meaningful access to \n7  the City’s pedestrian right of way, public buildings, parks, transportation, places of employment, \n8  and/or other facilities in which City programs, services, and activities are made available to the public, \n9  either through complete denials of access or through delay of travel or unsafe conditions. \n10  31.  This lack of accessible curb ramps is not isolated or limited.  Rather, these barriers to \n11  full and equal access to the pedestrian right of way exist throughout the City, thus denying individuals \n12  with mobility disabilities full, equal, and meaningful access to the pedestrian right of way City-wide.  \n13  Persons with mobility disabilities encounter missing or Inaccessible curb ramps throughout the City, \n14  including, among others, in the areas surrounding Mt. Pleasant High School, Lynbrook High School, \n15  Booksin Elementary School, Almaden Elementary, Calabazas Branch Library, Stratford School, and \n16  Stevens Creek Blvd and S. Monroe Street neighborhoods.  As a result, persons with mobility \n17  disabilities have been denied access to the accommodations and services available to the general \n18  public.  Furthermore, these barriers deter persons with mobility disabilities from exploring or visiting \n19  areas of the City.  Missing and Inaccessible curb ramps also delay travel and cause persons with \n20  mobility disabilities to fear for their safety, as these conditions often create dangerous situations. \n21  32.  Defendant has not provided and does not provide persons with mobility disabilities with \n22  any map (whether paper or electronic), signage, or other form of notice of any routes, or parts of \n23  routes, in the City’s pedestrian right of way that are accessible to persons with mobility disabilities.  \n24  Notice of completed accessibility improvements and plans for scheduled accessibility improvements \n25  are not posted on the City website, and notice of such information is not made otherwise available to \n26  persons with mobility disabilities.  As a result of the lack of any notice, maps, or signage regarding the \n27  location of accessible routes within the City’s pedestrian right of way, persons with mobility \n28  disabilities have been and continue to be deterred from and impeded in travelling to various parts of \n  9 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - CASE NO. 5:20-CV-1236  \n753 916.14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 1   Filed 02/19/20   Page 11 of 25\n \n1  the City, thus denying them meaningful and equal access to the City’s pedestrian right of way and its \n2  other facilities, programs, services, and activities. \n3  33.  Defendant failed to prepare and implement a compliant Transition Plan relating to the \n4  construction and maintenance of curb ramps in the pedestrian right of way as required by federal and \n5  California law.  State law incorporates as a minimum standard the protections and prohibitions \n6  contained in Section 202 of the ADA (42 U.S.C. § 12132) and the federal rules and regulations \n7  adopted in implementation thereof.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2 §§ 11188 and 11195.  The federal \n8  regulations implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act required public entities that receive \n9  federal financial assistance to create Transition Plans by June 3, 1978.  45 C.F.R. § 84.22(e).  The \n10  regulations implementing Title II of the ADA required local governmental entities to create Transition \n11  Plans by July 26, 1992.  28 C.F.R. § 35.150(d).  The regulations implementing California Government \n12  Code § 11135 were promulgated on June 24, 1980, and required local governmental entities to \n13  complete self-evaluations within one year and implement a Transition Plan within three years.  A \n14  Transition Plan must include, among other things, an up-to-date schedule for providing curb ramps or \n15  other sloped areas where the pedestrian right of way crosses streets.  See 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(d)(3); 45 \n16  C.F.R. § 84.22(e); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2 § 11195.  The City developed an ADA Transition Plan in \n17  1994 and updated its Transition Plan in 2008 and again in 2010.  The Transition Plan, however, does \n18  not include a schedule for the construction of curb ramps or locations, nor does it identify the steps \n19  necessary to achieve program access—the Plan states simply that curb ramp project “Needs Study.”  \n20  Additionally, the Transition Plan was incomplete in that it was not based on a comprehensive “Self-\n21  Evaluation,” or survey of the City’s curb ramps and other facilities where City programs, services and \n22  activities are carried out. \n23  34.  Defendant’s failure to conduct a timely Self Evaluation and prepare and implement a \n24  compliant Transition Plan relating to the pedestrian right of way, including curb ramps, as required by \n25  Section 504, the ADA, and analogous state law, is further evidence of Defendant’s failure to comply \n26  with the “program access” requirements of the statutes. \n27 \n28 \n  10 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - CASE NO. 5:20-CV-1236  \n753 916.14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 1   Filed 02/19/20   Page 12 of 25\n \n1  35.  This discrimination and continuing systemic inaccessibility cause a real and immediate \n2  threat of current and continuing harm to persons with mobility disabilities within the City as \n3  represented by the experiences of the Named Plaintiff. \n4  FACTS APPLICABLE TO PLAINTIFF \n5  36.  Plaintiff Artie Lashbrook has lived in the City of San Jose since the late 1960s, and has \n6  used a wheelchair since approximately 2011.  Plaintiff experienced numerous barriers to access and \n7  unsafe conditions while attempting to use curb ramps within the City of San Jose, including missing \n8  and non-compliant curb ramps. \n9  37.  Over the years, Plaintiff has encountered hundreds of locations in various \n10  neighborhoods where curb ramps in the City’s pedestrian right of way are either missing or \n11  inaccessible.  Plaintiff Lashbrook resided for several years near the intersection of Monterey Road and \n12  Edenview Drive.  Plaintiff’s ability to navigate the pedestrian right of way in his own neighborhood \n13  was severely hampered by the lack of accessible curb ramps throughout the pedestrian right of way, \n14  including three non-compliant curb ramps at the northeast, southeast, and southwest corners of the \n15  intersection of Monterey Road and Edenview Drive.  He also encountered a non-compliant curb ramp \n16  at the southeast corner of Monterey Road and Roeder Road.  Given that these non-compliant curb \n17  ramps were adjacent to Mr. Lashbrook’s home, he had no option but to encounter these ramps when he \n18  left his home to engage in his community. \n19  38.  Since August 2017, Plaintiff has lived in the Mt. Pleasant neighborhood.  There, he \n20  encountered two missing curb ramps at the intersection of Mt. Palomar Drive and Mt. Vista Drive, and \n21  two missing curb ramps at the intersection of Mt. Vista Drive and Mt. Herman Drive.  Those corners \n22  lacked curb ramps until approximately June 2018.  Plaintiff continues to encounter missing curb ramps \n23  at the intersections of Mt. Palomar Drive and Mt. Hood Way, Mr. Palomar Drive and Mt. McKinley \n24  Drive, and Mt. McKinley Drive and White Road. \n25  39.  In addition, on three specific occasions, inaccessible curb ramps have caused Plaintiff \n26  significant personal injuries.  In November 2014, Plaintiff was injured attempting to use the non-\n27  compliant curb ramp at the intersection of Monterey Road and Roeder Road discussed above.  As he \n28  descended the curb ramp, the wheel of Plaintiff’s wheelchair became lodged in a large surface gap at \n  11 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - CASE NO. 5:20-CV-1236  \n753 916.14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 1   Filed 02/19/20   Page 13 of 25\n \n1  the bottom of the curb ramp.  As a result, he was thrown out of his wheelchair and into the direct path \n2  of oncoming traffic.  Plaintiff remained lying in the street unable to move.  During that time, Plaintiff \n3  feared for his safety, frightened by the possibility of being struck by a vehicle.  After approximately \n4  five minutes, two uniformed police officers observed him in distress and blocked traffic while helping \n5  him back into his chair. \n6  40.  In March 2015, Plaintiff experienced a similar incident at the intersection of North \n7  Market Street and West Santa Clara Street.  Like the first incident, one of the front wheels on his \n8  wheelchair struck a surface gap as he descended the curb ramp located on the northwest corner of the \n9  intersection.  He was thrown out of his wheelchair into the crosswalk and required help from \n10  bystanders to get back into his wheelchair.  The other incident occurred at the intersection of Cottle \n11  Road and Beswick Drive in January 2017.  There, Plaintiff encountered a non-flush transition at the \n12  bottom of the curb ramp located on the northwest corner of this major intersection.  Plaintiff’s \n13  wheelchair tipped over, causing him to fall into the channelized right-turn lane.  He remained there for \n14  approximately ten minutes, again fearful, anxious, and concerned for his safety, until the driver of \n15  passing truck stopped and helped him back into his wheelchair. \n16  41.  These experiences are typical of those experienced by persons with mobility disabilities \n17  in the City and demonstrate the inaccessibility, fear, humiliation, and isolation that people with \n18  mobility disabilities experience while trying to navigate the City’s pedestrian right of way. \n19  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n20  42.  Plaintiff brings this action individually, and on behalf of all persons with mobility \n21  disabilities who use or will use the pedestrian right of way in the City of San Jose, as a class action \n22  under Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n23  43.  Each member of the class is a “qualified person with a disability” and/or a person with a \n24  “disability” pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2); Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, \n25  et seq., and 2 C.C.R. § 11187.  The persons in the class are so numerous that the joinder of all such \n26  persons is impracticable and that the disposition of their claims in a class action rather than in \n27  individual actions will benefit the parties and the Court.  The class consists of tens of thousands of \n28  persons with mobility disabilities. \n  12 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - CASE NO. 5:20-CV-1236  \n753 916.14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 1   Filed 02/19/20   Page 14 of 25\n \n1  44.  Defendant has failed and continues to fail to comply with the ADA, Section 504, and \n2  analogous state law in its implementation of the City’s administrative methods, policies, procedures, \n3  and practices with regard to the construction, remediation, and maintenance of curb ramps that provide \n4  access to the City’s pedestrian right of way. \n5  45.  Defendant has not adopted and does not enforce appropriate administrative methods, \n6  policies, procedures, and/or practices to ensure that it is in compliance with the ADA, Section 504, and \n7  analogous state law, and to ensure nondiscrimination against persons with mobility disabilities and \n8  equal access to facilities, programs, services, and activities for persons with mobility disabilities. \n9  46.  The violations of the ADA, Section 504, and related California state statutes set forth in \n10  detail herein have injured all members of the proposed class and violated their rights in a similar way. \n11  47.  Defendant has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, \n12  thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief with respect to the class as a whole.  Class claims are \n13  brought for the purposes of obtaining injunctive relief only. \n14  48.  The claims of the Named Plaintiff are typical of those of the class in that they arise from \n15  the same course of conduct engaged in by Defendant.  The relief sought herein will benefit all class \n16  members alike. \n17  49.  Named Plaintiff will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class.  He has no \n18  interests adverse to the interests of other members of the class and has retained counsel who are \n19  competent and experienced in litigating complex class actions, including large-scale disability rights \n20  class action cases involving the accessibility of municipal pedestrian rights of way for classes of \n21  individuals with mobility disabilities. \n22  50.  The requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are met with \n23  regard to the proposed class in that: \n24  a.  The class is so numerous that it would be impractical to bring all class members \n25  before the Court;  \n26  b.  There are questions of law and fact which are common to the class; \n27  c.  The Named Plaintiff’s claims for injunctive relief are typical of the claims of the \n28  class; \n  13 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - CASE NO. 5:20-CV-1236  \n753 916.14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 1   Filed 02/19/20   Page 15 of 25\n \n1  d.  The Named Plaintiff will fairly and adequately represent common class interests \n2  and is represented by counsel who are experienced in law reform class actions and the disability rights \n3  issues in this case; and \n4  e.  Defendant has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the \n5  class. \n6  51.  The common questions of law and fact, shared by the Named Plaintiff and all class \n7  members, include but are not limited to: \n8  a.  Whether Defendant is violating Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131, et seq., \n9  by failing to construct or remediate curb ramps that make the City’s pedestrian right of way program, \n10  service, or activity accessible to and useable by persons with mobility disabilities, and otherwise \n11  discriminating against persons with mobility disabilities, as set forth above; \n12  b.  Whether Defendant is violating Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131, et seq., \n13  by failing to construct or remediate curb ramps that make facilities in which City programs, services, \n14  or activities are made available to the public accessible to and useable by persons with mobility \n15  disabilities, and otherwise discriminating against persons with mobility disabilities, as set forth above; \n16  c.  Whether Defendant is violating Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \n17  section 794 et seq., by failing to construct or remediate curb ramps that make the City’s pedestrian \n18  right of way program, service, or activity accessible to and useable by persons with mobility \n19  disabilities, and otherwise discriminating against people with mobility disabilities, as set forth above; \n20  d.  Whether Defendant is violating Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \n21  section 794 et seq., by failing to construct or remediate curb ramps that make facilities in which City \n22  programs, services, or activities are made available to the public accessible to and useable by persons \n23  with mobility disabilities, and otherwise discriminating against persons with mobility disabilities, as \n24  set forth above; \n25  e.  Whether Defendant is violating California Government Code § 11135, et seq., \n26  by failing to construct or remediate curb ramps that make the City’s pedestrian right of way program, \n27  service, or activity accessible to and useable by persons with mobility disabilities, and otherwise \n28  discriminating against people with mobility disabilities, as set forth above; \n  14 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - CASE NO. 5:20-CV-1236  \n753 916.14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 1   Filed 02/19/20   Page 16 of 25\n \n1  f.  Whether Defendant is violating California Government Code § 11135, et seq., \n2  by failing to construct or remediate curb ramps that make facilities in which City programs, services, \n3  or activities are made available to the public accessible to and useable by persons with mobility \n4  disabilities, and otherwise discriminating against persons with mobility disabilities, as set forth above; \n5  g.  Whether Defendant has performed “new construction” and/or “alterations” to \n6  the City’s pedestrian right of way within the meaning of 28 C.F.R. § 35.151, triggering an obligation to \n7  construct or retrofit curb ramps to be compliant with UFAS, 1991 ADAAG or 2010 ADAS; \n8  h.  Whether Defendant has performed “new construction” and/or “alterations” to \n9  the City’s pedestrian right of way within the meaning of 45 C.F.R. § 84.23, triggering an obligation to \n10  construct or retrofit curb ramps to be compliant with UFAS, 1991 ADAAG, or 2010 ADAS; \n11  i.  Whether Defendant has performed “new construction” and/or “alterations” to \n12  the City’s pedestrian right of way within the meaning of Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2 §§ 11197 & 11198, \n13  triggering an obligation to construct or retrofit curb ramps to be complaint with the CBC; \n14  j.  Whether Defendant, by its actions and omissions alleged herein, has engaged in \n15  a pattern or practice of discriminating against Plaintiff and other persons with mobility disabilities in \n16  violation of applicable federal and state disability access laws. \n17  FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990  \n18  42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. \n19  52.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in the foregoing \n20  paragraphs. \n21  53.  Title II of the ADA provides in pertinent part: “[N]o qualified individual with a \n22  disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits \n23  of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such \n24  entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n25  54.  At all times relevant to this action, the City was and is a “public entity” within the \n26  meaning of Title II of the ADA and provides a pedestrian right of way program, service, or activity to \n27  the general public. \n28 \n  15 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - CASE NO. 5:20-CV-1236  \n753 916.14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 1   Filed 02/19/20   Page 17 of 25\n \n1  55.  At all times relevant to this action, Plaintiff was and is a qualified individual with a \n2  disability within the meaning of Title II of the ADA and meets the essential eligibility requirements for \n3  the receipt of the services, programs, or activities of the City.  42 U.S.C. § 12131. \n4  56.  Defendant is mandated to operate each program, service, or activity “so that, when \n5  viewed in its entirety, it is readily accessible to and useable by individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. \n6  § 35.150; see also 28 C.F.R. § 35.149.  This requirement applies to all programs, services, and \n7  activities that a public entity offers, whether or not they are carried out in facilities that have been \n8  constructed or altered since January 26, 1992.  Pedestrian rights of way themselves constitute a vital \n9  public program, service, or activity under Title II of the ADA.  28 C.F.R. § 35.104; Barden v. City of \n10  Sacramento, 292 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir. 2002). \n11  57.  Furthermore, the regulations implementing Title II of the ADA specifically provide that \n12  a public entity must construct curb ramps at intersections whenever it newly constructs or alters \n13  sidewalks, streets, roads, and/or highways at any time after January 26, 1992 and must comply with \n14  UFAS, ADAAG, or 2010 ADAS depending on the date of construction or alteration.  28 C.F.R. \n15  § 35.151.  Kirola v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 860 F.3d 1164, 1176 (9th Cir. 2018).   A street \n16  resurfacing project by a public entity is one example of an alteration under the meaning of the \n17  regulation.  Kinney v. Yersalim, 9 F.3d 1067, 1073-74 (3rd Cir. 1993); Lonberg v. City of Riverside, \n18  No. 97-CV-0237, 2007 WL 2005177, at * 6 (C.D. Cal. 2007). \n19  58.  The regulations implementing Title II of the ADA provide that a public entity must \n20  maintain the features of all facilities required to be accessible by the ADA.  28 C.F.R. § 35.133.  \n21  Facilities required to be accessible include roads, walks, and passageways.  28 C.F.R. § 35.104. \n22  59.  Due to the lack of accessible curb ramps as alleged above, as well as Defendant’s \n23  failure to conduct a timely Self Evaluation and implement a compliant Transition Plan for the \n24  pedestrian right of way, the City’s pedestrian right of way is not fully, equally, or meaningfully \n25  accessible to Plaintiff when viewed in its entirety.  Nor are the facilities in which City programs, \n26  services, and activities are made available to the public.  Defendant has therefore violated the “program \n27  access” obligation applicable to pedestrian right of way facilities that have not been newly constructed \n28  or altered since January 26, 1992. \n  16 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - CASE NO. 5:20-CV-1236  \n753 916.14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 1   Filed 02/19/20   Page 18 of 25\n \n1  60.  Additionally, the sidewalks, cross walks, and other walkways at issue constitute \n2  facilities within the meaning of ADA and its implementing regulations.  Plaintiff is informed, believes, \n3  and thereon alleges that since January 26, 1992, Defendant has constructed, altered, or repaired parts of \n4  these facilities within the meaning of the ADA and its implementing regulations, and that Defendant, \n5  through its administrative methods, policies, and practices, has failed to make such facilities readily \n6  accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities through the construction and retrofit of curb ramps \n7  as required under federal accessibility standards and guidelines. \n8  61.  Plaintiff is informed, believes, and thereon alleges that since March 15, 2012 (the \n9  effective date of the 2010 Standards for Accessible Design), Defendant has constructed, altered, or \n10  repaired parts of these facilities within the meaning of the ADAAG and the UFAS, and that Defendant, \n11  through its administrative methods, policies, and practices, has failed to make such facilities readily \n12  accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities through the construction and retrofit of curb ramps \n13  that comply with the 2010 ADAS, as required under 28 C.F.R. 35.151(c)(5). \n14  62.  Plaintiff is informed, believes, and thereon alleges that Defendant and its agents and \n15  employees have violated and continue to violate Title II of the ADA by failing to maintain the features \n16  of the City’s curb ramps that are required to be accessible. \n17  63.  Plaintiff is informed, believes, and thereon alleges that Defendant and its agents and \n18  employees have violated and continue to violate Title II of the ADA by failing to timely respond to and \n19  remedy complaints regarding the lack of accessible curb ramps necessary to ensure access to the City’s \n20  pedestrian right of way. \n21  64.  The ADA’s regulations at 43 C.F.R. § 17.550(a)(3) prevent public entities from refusing \n22  to comply with their obligations to provide persons with disabilities meaningful access to their \n23  services, programs and activities in or comprised of facilities existing as of the ADA’s effective date \n24  by claiming that doing so would impose an undue financial or administrative burden, unless such a \n25  determination is made by an agency head or his or her designee after consulting all agency resources \n26  available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and the \n27  determination is accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion.  On \n28  information and belief, the City, through its agency heads and/or designees, has failed to make such a \n  17 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - CASE NO. 5:20-CV-1236  \n753 916.14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 1   Filed 02/19/20   Page 19 of 25\n \n1  determination accompanied by the required written statement and has, therefore, failed to demonstrate \n2  that providing the access Plaintiff seeks to its pedestrian right of way would impose an undue financial \n3  or administrative burden. \n4  65.  As a direct and proximate result of the aforementioned acts, Plaintiff has suffered and \n5  continues to suffer difficulty, hardship, anxiety, and danger due to Defendant’s failure to remediate \n6  missing, defective, and/or Inaccessible curb ramps throughout the City’s pedestrian right of way.  \n7  These failures have denied and continue to deny Plaintiff the full, equal, and meaningful access to the \n8  pedestrian right of way that the ADA requires. \n9  66.  Because Defendant’s discriminatory conduct presents a real and immediate threat of \n10  current and continuing future violations, injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy. \n11  67.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 12133 and 12205, Plaintiff is entitled to injunctive relief as \n12  well as reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert expenses, and costs incurred in bringing this action. \n13  SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \n14  29 U.S.C. § 794 et seq. \n15  68.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in the foregoing \n16  paragraphs. \n17  69.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provides in pertinent part: “[N]o \n18  otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \n19  excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under \n20  any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance . . .”  29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n21  70.  Plaintiff is otherwise qualified to participate in the services, programs, or activities that \n22  are provided to individuals in the City.  See 29 U.S.C. § 794(b).  \n23  71.  The City is a direct recipient of federal financial assistance sufficient to invoke the \n24  coverage of Section 504 and has received such federal financial assistance at all times relevant to the \n25  claims asserted in this Complaint. \n26  72.  Defendant and its agents and employees have violated and continue to violate the \n27  Rehabilitation Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by excluding Plaintiff from \n28  participation in, denying Plaintiff the benefits of, and subjecting Plaintiff based solely by reason of his \n  18 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - CASE NO. 5:20-CV-1236  \n753 916.14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 1   Filed 02/19/20   Page 20 of 25\n \n1  disability to, discrimination in the benefits and services of the City’s pedestrian right of way and for \n2  the reasons set forth above. \n3  73.  Additionally, under Section 504, a recipient of federal financial assistance must \n4  construct ADAS-, ADAAG- or UFAS-compliant curb ramps at intersections whenever it newly \n5  constructs or alters sidewalks, streets, roads, and/or highways at any time after June 3, 1977.  Willits v. \n6  City of Los Angeles, 925 F. Supp. 2d. 1089, 1094 (C.D. Cal. 2013).  Defendant has violated Section \n7  504 by failing to construct such compliant curb ramps at intersections throughout the City where it has \n8  newly constructed sidewalks or newly constructed or altered streets, roads, and/or highways since June \n9  3, 1977. \n10  74.  As a direct and proximate result of the aforementioned acts, Plaintiff suffered and \n11  continues to suffer discrimination, difficulty, hardship, anxiety, and danger due to Defendant’s failure \n12  to remediate missing, defective, and/or Inaccessible curb ramps throughout the City’s pedestrian right \n13  of way.  These failures have denied Plaintiff the full, equal, and meaningful access to the pedestrian \n14  right of way that Section 504 requires. \n15  75.  Because Defendant’s discriminatory conduct presents a real and immediate threat of \n16  current and continuing violations, injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy. \n17  76.  Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), Plaintiff is entitled to injunctive relief, and to recover \n18  from Defendant the reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in bringing this action.   \n19  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nCalifornia Government Code § 11135 \n20 \n21  77.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in the foregoing \n22  paragraphs. \n23  78.  Section 11135(a) of the California Code provides in pertinent part: “No person in the \n24  State of California shall, on the basis of . . . disability, be unlawfully denied the benefits of, or be \n25  unlawfully subjected to discrimination under, any program or activity that is funded by the state or \n26  receives any financial assistance from the state.” \n27  79.  The City is funded directly by the State of California and receives financial assistance \n28  from the State of California sufficient to invoke the coverage of Section 11135.  The City has received \n  19 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - CASE NO. 5:20-CV-1236  \n753 916.14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 1   Filed 02/19/20   Page 21 of 25\n \n1  such funding and financial assistance each year going back at least several decades, and at all times \n2  relevant to the claims asserted in this Complaint.  Section 11135(b) incorporates the protections and \n3  prohibitions contained in the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and its implementing \n4  regulations.  Section 11135 (b) states in pertinent part, that: \n5  With respect to discrimination on the basis of disability, programs and \nactivities  subject  to  subdivision  (a)  shall  meet  the  Americans  with \n6  Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. § 12132), and the federal rules and \nregulations adopted in implementation thereof, except that if the laws of \n7  this state prescribe stronger protections and prohibitions, the programs and \nactivities subject to subdivision (a) shall be subject to stronger protections \n8  and prohibitions. \n \n9  80.  For all of the reasons outlined above, Defendant has violated and continues to violate \n10  the Americans with Disabilities Act and therefore has violated and continues to violate California \n11  Government Code § 11135(b). \n12  81.  In addition, Defendant and its agents and employees have and continue to violate \n13  Section 11135 and the regulations promulgated thereunder by excluding Plaintiff from participation in, \n14  denying Plaintiff the benefits of, and subjecting Plaintiff based solely by reason of his disability to, \n15  discrimination in the benefits and services of the City’s pedestrian right of way for the reasons set forth \n16  above. \n17  82.  Additionally, under Section 11135, a recipient of state financial assistance must newly \n18  construct or alter pedestrian facilities in compliance with applicable state accessibility standards.  Cal. \n19  Code Regs. tit. 2 § 11199.  Defendant has violated Section 11135 by failing to construct or alter curb \n20  ramps in compliance with state accessibility standards since June 24, 1980. \n21  83.  Defendant has refused and failed to provide Plaintiff with full and equal access to its \n22  facilities, programs, services and activities as required by Section 11135 through its policies and \n23  practices with regard to the City’s pedestrian rights of way and disability access. \n24  84.  As a direct and proximate result of the aforementioned acts, Plaintiff has suffered and \n25  continues to suffer difficulty, hardship and danger, due to Defendant’s failure to provide access to the \n26  City’s pedestrian rights of way. \n27 \n28 \n  20 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - CASE NO. 5:20-CV-1236  \n753 916.14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 1   Filed 02/19/20   Page 22 of 25\n \n1  85.  Because Defendant’s discriminatory conduct is ongoing, declaratory and injunctive \n2  relief are appropriate remedies. \n3  86.  Plaintiff is also entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs in filing this action. \n4  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for relief as set forth below. \n5  FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nDisabled Persons Act \n6  California Civil Code § 54 \n7  87.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in the foregoing \n8  paragraphs. \n9  88.  Plaintiff asserts this cause of action for injunctive relief on behalf of the class but seeks \n10  damages pursuant to the California Disabled Persons Act (“DPA”) on an individual basis only. \n11  89.  The DPA provides that “[i]ndividuals with disabilities or medical conditions have the \n12  same rights as the general public to the full and free use of streets, highways, sidewalks, walkways, \n13  public buildings, medical facilities, including hospitals, clinics, and physicians’ offices, public \n14  facilities, and other public places.” Cal. Civ. Code § 54(a). \n15  90.  Plaintiff is a person with a disability within the meaning of California Civil Code § \n16  54(b) and California Government Code § 12926. \n17  91.  By failing to provide reasonable and equal accommodations to Plaintiff in light of, and \n18  based upon, Plaintiff’s disability, Defendant has deprived Plaintiff of his right to full and free use of \n19  public facilities, including streets, highways, sidewalks, walkways, and public buildings, and therefore \n20  violates California Civil Code § 54. \n21  92.  Under California Civil Code § 54(c), a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n22  also constitutes a violation of California Civil Code § 54 et seq. \n23  93.  For all the reasons outlined above, Defendants violated the rights of Plaintiff under the \n24  Americans with Disabilities Act, and therefore violated California Code § 54. \n25  94.  Under California Civil Code § 55, any person who is aggrieved or potentially aggrieved \n26  by a violation of California Civil Code § 54 may bring an action to enjoin the violation.  Plaintiff \n27  therefore seeks injunctive relief on behalf of himself and the class to enjoin Defendant’s violation of \n28  Civil Code § 54 as set forth in detail in the above paragraphs. \n  21 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - CASE NO. 5:20-CV-1236  \n753 916.14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 1   Filed 02/19/20   Page 23 of 25\n \n1  95.  The DPA also provides that “[a]ny person or persons, firm or corporation who denies or \n2  interferes with the rights of an individual with a disability under Sections 54, 54.1, and 54.2 is liable \n3  for each offense for the actual damages and any amount as may be determined by a jury, or the court \n4  sitting without a jury, up to a maximum of three times the amount of actual damages but in no case less \n5  than one thousand dollars ($1,000), and attorney’s fees as may be determined by the court in addition \n6  thereto, suffered by any person denied any of the rights provided in Sections 54, 54.1, and 54.2.” Cal. \n7  Civ. Code § 54.3(a). \n8  96.  As a direct and proximate result of the aforementioned acts, Plaintiff Lashbrook has \n9  suffered and continues to suffer difficulty, discomfort, and embarrassment. \n10  97.  Plaintiff Lashbrook seeks an award of damages on behalf of himself on an individual \n11  basis.  Plaintiff is entitled to actual and statutory damages in an amount up to a maximum of three \n12  times the amount of his actual damages. Cal. Civ. Code § 54.3.   \n13  98.  Under California Civil Code § 54 et seq., Plaintiff is entitled to attorneys’ fees and \n14  costs. \n15  99.  Under the California Government Claims Act, no person may sue a government entity \n16  for “money or damages” unless that person presents a claim to the government entity within six \n17  months of accrual, which is then rejected by the government entity.  Cal. Gov’t. Code §§ 905, 911.2, \n18  945.4.  The requirements of the California Government Claims Act must be satisfied by the aggrieved \n19  party, or waived by the government entity, in order for such a claim to be actionable. \n20  100.  The City has waived the claim presentation requirements of the California Government \n21  Claims Act as they relate to Plaintiff Lashbrook.  Moreover, Plaintiff’s claims are timely as they are \n22  subject to a statute of limitations tolling agreement that took effect on March 28, 2014.    \n23  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for relief as set forth below.   \n24  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n25  THEREFORE, Plaintiff requests judgment as follows: \n26  1.  Certification of Plaintiff’s claims as a Class Action and certification of Plaintiff as Class \n27  Representative and his counsel as Class Counsel. \n28 \n  22 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - CASE NO. 5:20-CV-1236  \n753 916.14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 1   Filed 02/19/20   Page 24 of 25\n \n1  2.  Issuance of a permanent injunction requiring Defendant to undertake remedial measures \n2  to mitigate the effects of Defendant’s past and ongoing violations of Title II of the ADA, Section 504 \n3  of the Rehabilitation Act, California Government Code § 11135, California Civil Code § 54, and any \n4  regulations promulgated under those statutes.  At a minimum, Defendant must be enjoined to take the \n5  following actions: \n6  a.  Ensure that the City constructs, remediates, repairs, and maintains curb ramps \n7  such that, when viewed in its entirety, the City’s pedestrian right of way is readily accessible to and \n8  useable by individuals with mobility disabilities; \n9  b.  Ensure that the City constructs, remediates, repairs, and maintains curb ramps \n10  such that facilities in which City programs, services, and activities are made available to the public are \n11  readily accessible to and useable by individuals with mobility disabilities; \n12  c.  Ensure prompt remedial measures to cure past violations of the City’s duty to \n13  construct or alter curb ramps as required by the new construction and alteration obligations of Title II \n14  of the ADA, 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(a), (b), (c) or (i), and Section 504, 45 C.F.R. § 84.22, and the curb \n15  ramp design standards in effect at the time of such new construction or alterations; \n16  d.  Ensure that all future new construction and alterations to the City’s curb ramps \n17  fully comply with the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design, or other federal and state disability \n18  access design standards, whichever is most stringent in its disability access requirements; \n19  e.  Ensure that Defendant adopts and implements administrative methods, policies, \n20  and practices to maintain accessible curb ramps; and  \n21  f.  Remain under this Court’s jurisdiction until Defendant fully complies with the \n22  Orders of this Court; \n23  3.  Reasonable attorneys’ fees, expenses, and costs, as provided by law;  \n24  4.  Monetary relief to Plaintiff Lashbrook, including an award of damages pursuant to Cal. \n25  Civil Code § 54.3; \n26  5.  Such other relief as the Court finds just and proper. \n27   \n28 \n  23 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - CASE NO. 5:20-CV-1236  \n753 916.14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 1   Filed 02/19/20   Page 25 of 25\n \n1  Dated:  February 19, 2020  Respectfully submitted, \n \n2 \nGOLDSTEIN, BORGEN, DARDARIAN & HO \n3 \n \n \n4 \n  s/Andrew P.

INTRODUCTION \n2  Plaintiff Artie Lashbrook (“Plaintiff” or “Plaintiff Lashbrook”) and Defendant City of San Jose \n3  (“Defendant” or “City”) seek preliminary approval of a proposed Consent Decree that requires the City to \n4  construct and remediate 27,621 curb ramps on City streets by the end of 2038, and to appropriate in excess \n5  of $130 million over the term of the Consent Decree to fund this curb ramp work.  Settlement Class \n6  Members will have the opportunity to request curb ramp construction and remediation at specific locations.  \n7  The City is obligated to use best efforts to resolve these requests within 120 days.  The Consent Decree also \n8  includes effective mechanisms for reporting, monitoring, and dispute resolution to ensure that the parties \n9  comply with their obligations to the Settlement Class throughout the term of the Consent Decree.  Balanced \n10  against the cost, delay, and risks of further litigation, the injunctive relief provided by the Consent Decree is \n11  fair, reasonable, and adequate within the meaning of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e) and satisfies all \n12  of the criteria for preliminary settlement approval.  Accordingly, the parties respectfully request that the \n13  Court: (i) preliminarily approve the settlement; (ii) certify the proposed Settlement Class and appoint the \n14  Plaintiff Lashbrook as Settlement Class Representative and Plaintiff’s attorneys as Class Counsel; (iii) \n15  approve the proposed form of the class notice and distribution plan; and (iv) set a fairness hearing. \n16  II.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n17  Plaintiff and proposed Settlement Class representative Artie Lashbrook is a life-long resident of the \n18  City of San Jose and a person with a mobility disability who uses a wheelchair for mobility.  Declaration of \n19  Artie Lashbrook (“Lashbrook Decl.”) ¶ 2.  Plaintiff Lashbrook does not own an automobile and relies on \n20  public transportation and the pedestrian right of way to get around the City.  Id. ¶ 3.  Plaintiff, however, has \n21  encountered numerous barriers to access while attempting to use curb ramps within the City of San Jose, \n22  including non-compliant, missing, and unsafe curb ramps.  Id. ¶ 4.  From September 2013 to the present—\n23  the period during which Plaintiff Lashbrook’s claims have been tolled by agreement of the parties—he \n24  estimates having over three thousand separate encounters with non-compliant curb ramps.  Id. ¶ 5.  The \n25  majority of these non-compliant curb ramps were located along routes connecting his residences to bus \n26  stops and grocery stores, and therefore could not be avoided. \n27  For example, in November 2014, the front wheel of Plaintiff’s wheelchair became lodged in a large \n28 \n1 \n \nPLS.’ MEM.

Id. ¶ 8. \n2  As a result, he was thrown out of his wheelchair and onto the pavement of that busy thoroughfare.  Id.  \n3  Plaintiff Lashbrook remained lying in the street unable to move.  Id.  He feared for his safety, frightened by \n4  the possibility of being struck by a vehicle.  Id.  After approximately five minutes, two uniformed police \n5  officers observed him in distress and blocked traffic while helping him back into his chair.  Id.  In March \n6  2015, Plaintiff was similarly thrown out of his wheelchair while descending a curb ramp at the intersection \n7  of North Market Street and West Santa Clara Street in downtown San Jose, and required assistance from \n8  bystanders to get back into his wheelchair.  Id.  And in January 2017, Plaintiff’s wheelchair tipped over and \n9  he fell into a channelized right-turn lane after encountering a non-flush transition at the bottom of the curb \n10  ramp located at the intersection of Cottle Road and Beswick Drive.  Id.  He remained in the street for \n11  approximately ten minutes until the driver of a passing truck helped him back into his wheelchair.  Id. \n12  The conditions described above occur throughout the City’s pedestrian right of way and similarly \n13  affect all of the City’s residents and visitors who have mobility disabilities and use wheelchairs, scooters \n14  and other mobility devices.  Declaration of Linda M. Dardarian (“Dardarian Decl.”) ¶ 2. \n15  On February 24, 2014, Class Counsel sent a letter to the City of San Jose asserting that Plaintiff and \n16  other City residents and visitors with mobility disabilities have been denied access to the City’s pedestrian \n17  right of way because of a lack of accessible curb ramps throughout the City.  Dardarian Decl. ¶ 5.  \n18  Plaintiff’s letter highlighted the inaccessibility of the City’s pedestrian right of way, and proposed that the \n19  parties work cooperatively to resolve Plaintiff’s claims through structured negotiations rather than \n20  litigation.  Id.  The City agreed, and in August 2014, the parties entered into an agreement that tolled the \n21  statute of limitations on Plaintiff’s claims and identified the issues that would be addressed through \n22  structured negotiations.  Id.  Over the next two and a half years, the parties exchanged information \n23  regarding the status of existing curb ramps in the City’s pedestrian right of way, the City’s past and present \n24  policies concerning curb ramp construction and remediation, the legal obligations created by disability non-\n25  discrimination laws, and the parties’ settlement positions.  Id. \n26  In November 2016, the parties finalized an Interim Settlement Agreement that set forth certain \n27  preliminary obligations while they continued to negotiate a full resolution of Plaintiff’s claims.

The Interim Settlement Agreement required the City to spend up to $500,000 to hire a consultant \n2  to perform a complete survey of the City’s curb ramps to identify all locations that were missing curb \n3  ramps and assess existing curb ramps for compliance with applicable federal and state accessibility \n4  standards.  Id.  The curb ramp survey was divided into two phases: automated and manual.  Id.  The \n5  automated portion of the survey was performed using specialized optical equipment to determine the \n6  presence or absence of curb ramps at required curb ramp locations.  Id.  The manual portion of the survey \n7  involved on-site inspections of existing curb ramps to determine compliance with slope, surface, and other \n8  dimensional requirements.  Id.  The Interim Settlement Agreement also required the City to construct \n9  approximately 2,700 curb ramps over a two-year period and resolve curb ramp requests within one-\n10  hundred twenty (120) days of submission.  Id. \n11  The City completed its curb ramp survey in April 2018.  Dardarian Decl. ¶ 7.  It revealed that there \n12  were 22,885 existing curb ramps within the City.  Id.  20,849 curb ramps, or 91% of all curb ramps within \n13  the City, were non-compliant with applicable disability access standards set forth in the 2010 Americans \n14  with Disabilities Act Access Standards (“2010 ADAS”) or Title 24 of the California Building Code (“Title \n15  24” or “CBC”).  Id.  The survey found that 6,772 curb ramps were missing from locations where they are \n16  required, and 14,611 existing non-compliant curb ramps contained “High Priority Curb Ramps Barriers.” 1  \n17  Id.  Another 6,238 curb ramps did not comply with federal and state accessibility standards, but were not \n18  defined as “High Priority Curb Ramps Barriers.”  Id. \n19  With the survey completed, the parties proceeded to negotiate the Consent Decree that is presently \n20  before the Court.

The City has \n5  likewise concluded that settlement of this matter is desirable to avoid the time, risk, and expense of \n6  defending protracted litigation, to fulfill its long-standing obligations to residents and visitors with mobility \n7  disabilities, and to resolve the claims of the Plaintiff and Settlement Class.  Id.  \n8  III.  SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT \n9  The Consent Decree, attached in full as Exhibit B to the Dardarian Declaration, filed in conjunction \n10  herewith, includes the following negotiated and agreed-upon terms: \n11  A.  The Settlement Class \n12  The Settlement Class, as set forth in the Consent Decree, is defined as follows: all persons \n13  (including residents of and/or visitors to the City of San Jose) with any Mobility Disability,2 who, at any \n14  time prior to the Court granting final approval of the Consent Decree, have been denied full and equal \n15  access to the City’s pedestrian right of way due to the lack of a curb ramp or a curb ramp that was \n16  damaged, in need of repair, or otherwise in a condition not suitable or sufficient for use.  Consent Decree \n17  § 2.19; Dardarian Decl. ¶ 12.  The Settlement Class seeks injunctive relief only.  It does not seek damages. \n18  B.  Injunctive Relief \n19  1.  Installation and Remediation of Curb Ramps \n20  The Consent Decree ensures that the City will remediate all missing and non-compliant curb ramps \n21  by 2038.  It requires the City to construct 6,772 missing curb ramps and remediate 14,611 High Priority \n22  curb ramps by the end of 2030.  The remaining 6,238 non-compliant curb ramps that are not High Priority \n23  will be remediated by 2038 (collectively “Curb Ramp Construction Commitment”).  Consent Decree § 4.3.  \n24  On average, the City will construct or remediate 1,944 High Priority curb ramps per year (more than three \n25  times the average rate of construction before the parties commenced negotiations) between the effective \n26  date and 2030, and 807 Low Priority curb ramps per year between the years 2031 and 2038.

All curb ramp construction and remediation will be performed in compliance with federal \n2  and state disability access standards,3 and will count towards the Curb Ramp Construction Commitment.  \n3  See 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.150(a), 35.151(a), (b). \n4  In order to ensure that the City meets the Curb Ramp Construction Commitment, the Consent \n5  Decree also requires the City to appropriate thirteen million dollars ($13,000,000.00) each fiscal year \n6  (“Annual Monetary Commitment”) toward the construction and remediation of curb ramps within the City \n7  until 2030.  Consent Decree § 5.1.  After 2030, the City is required to appropriate a minimum of ten (10) \n8  percent of the City’s pavement budget toward the construction and remediation of curb ramps until the City \n9  fulfills its obligations under the Consent Decree.  Id. \n10  The Curb Ramp Construction Commitment and Annual Monetary Commitment are concurrent \n11  obligations that must each be met during the term of the Consent Decree.  Consent Decree §§ 4 & 5.  In \n12  other words, the Consent Decree requires that the City appropriate the Annual Monetary Commitment each \n13  year and meet the milestones established by the Curb Ramp Construction Commitment.  The City, \n14  however, retains some flexibility in how it will remediate the curb ramp barriers identified through the \n15  survey.  For example, if the City is unable to appropriate the Annual Monetary Commitment due to a \n16  recession, it will remain compliant with the Consent Decree so long as it maintains an average rate of curb \n17  ramp construction and remediation of at least 1,944 high priority curb ramps between the Effective Date \n18  through 2030 or 807 low priority curb ramps per year between 2031 and 2038.  Id. § 5.2.  The City will \n19  also remain compliant if it demonstrates that the sum of the appropriations for the two previous fiscal years \n20  plus the fiscal year with appropriations below the Annual Monetary Commitment is equal to three times the \n21  Annual Monetary Commitment.  Id.  Finally, the City will also remain compliant if it agrees to an \n22  additional appropriation over the next two fiscal years that is the equivalent of the difference between the \n23 \n \n24 \n3 The only exceptions arise where installation or upgrade is structurally impracticable, in conjunction \n25  with new construction, see 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(a)(2), or technically infeasible, in conjunction with \nalteration of an existing facility, see 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(b)(2).  If the City determines that installation \n26  or remediation of a curb ramp at a particular location is structurally impracticable or technically \ninfeasible, the City will ensure that any ramp that is constructed or remediated complies with \n27  accessibility standards to the maximum extent feasible.  Determinations of structural impracticability \nor technical infeasibility will be supported by adequate documentation.  The City is not required to \n28  install curb ramps where sidewalks do not exist or on corners where there is no legal crossing. \n5 \n \nPLS.’ MEM. OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF MOT.

Id. \n2  Additionally, the Consent Decree outlines procedures to address the elimination of two funding \n3  sources, Measure B – City of San Jose – Sales Tax, or the Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017 (SB \n4  1 – 2017-18 California legislative session) by local or statewide ballot measure, an act of the California \n5  State Legislature, or court order.  Consent Decree § 27.  This includes the City providing prompt notice to \n6  Class Counsel regarding funding status, using best efforts to find alternate funding sources to fulfill the \n7  Annual Monetary Commitment, and the parties’ resorting to a thorough Dispute Resolution process.  Id. § \n8  27.1-27.3.  If that process is not successful, Plaintiff is entitled to discovery regarding the City’s financial \n9  status and ability to appropriate the Annual Monetary Commitment and may file a motion with the District \n10  Court to enforce or modify the Consent Decree.  Id. § 27.4.  Plaintiff may also seek court approval to \n11  terminate the Consent Decree and litigate Plaintiff’s claims on behalf of himself and the Class.  Id.   \n12  2.  Prioritization and Transition Plan \n13  Curb ramps constructed or remediated pursuant to the City’s program access obligation (which \n14  covers locations that are not subject to new construction or alteration) will be prioritized pursuant to two \n15  sets of factors.  First, to the extent possible, the City will prioritize the remediation of High Priority Curb \n16  Ramp Barriers.  Consent Decree § 8.1.  Program Access improvements will also be prioritized consistent \n17  with ADA regulations.  See 28 C.F.R. § 35.150; Consent Decree § 8.1. \n18  The prioritization of curb ramp construction will be set forth in the City’s updated ADA Transition \n19  Plan, which, within two years of the effective date of the Decree, will be formally amended in compliance \n20  with 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(d) and 45 C.F.R. § 84.22(e), and with input from Class Counsel.  Id. § 2.24, \n21  §§10.1-10.3. \n22  3.  Curb Ramp Request Program \n23  The Consent Decree also requires the City to maintain a program through which people with \n24  mobility disabilities may submit requests for the construction or remediation of curb ramps in specific \n25  locations throughout the City.  Consent Decree § 11.1.  Curb Ramp Requests can be made through an \n26  easily locatable form on the City’s website that complies with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \n27  (WCAG), telephone, electronic mail, standard mail, and other non-onerous methods for making requests.  \n28 \n6 \n \nPLS.’ MEM.

Significantly, in addition to notifying requestors of the status of their request, the City must use \n2  best efforts to investigate each request within thirty (30) days and construct or remediate each requested \n3  curb ramp within one-hundred twenty (120) days of submission of the request.  Id. § 11.4.  If the City is \n4  unable to fulfill the Curb Ramp Request by the estimated date, the City must notify the requestor and \n5  provide a revised estimated date by which the Accessible Curb Ramp will be constructed, remediated, or \n6  maintained.  Id. § 11.3.  Individual requests that exceed $100,000 in estimated costs will be exempt from \n7  the 120-day deadline.  Id. § 11.4. \n8  4.  Maintenance \n9  The Consent Decree requires the City to maintain all Accessible Pedestrian Facilities over which it \n10  has responsibility, ownership or control so that those facilities are readily accessible to and usable by \n11  persons with Mobility Disabilities, except for isolated or temporary interruptions in access due to \n12  maintenance or repairs.  Consent Decree § 12.  If Accessible Curb Ramps are not available due to \n13  maintenance or repairs, the City must provide an alternative accessible route.  Id.  The City must identify \n14  the alternative route through signage at the subject location.  Id. \n15  5.  Reporting \n16  The Consent Decree also requires the City to provide Plaintiff with a written report (“Annual \n17  Report”) regarding the status of the City’s compliance with the Consent Decree, including the number of \n18  curb ramps constructed and remediated and their locations, and the number and locations of curb ramps \n19  constructed and remediated via the curb ramp request program described above.  If applicable to the \n20  reporting period, the report will also include: (1) dollars appropriated and expended for Accessible Curb \n21  Ramps during the reporting period; (2) the number of missing curb ramps constructed, and High and Low \n22  Priority Curb Ramps remediated during the reporting period; (3) the status of all pending Curb Ramp \n23  Requests received by the City during the reporting period, including applicable response times; and (4) the \n24  number of non-compliant curb ramps constructed to the maximum extent feasible, or not constructed, due \n25  to Technical Infeasibility or Structural Impracticability.  Id. § 13.1. \n26  The City will also ensure that Plaintiff has access to the City’s GIS Database or equivalent \n27  databases upon Plaintiff’s reasonable request throughout the term of the Decree.

Consent Decree § \n5  14.  Plaintiff and Class Counsel may inspect newly constructed or altered curb ramps in order to monitor \n6  compliance with the Consent Decree.  Id.  Plaintiff and Class Counsel are also entitled to review the City’s \n7  survey database and curb ramp construction database.  Id. \n8  7.  Dispute Resolution \n9  The Court will retain jurisdiction to enforce the Consent Decree.  If either party believes that a \n10  dispute exists relating to any violation of or failure to perform any of the provisions, that party will first \n11  provide a written statement describing the alleged violation or failure with particularity, after which the \n12  other party will have deadlines to provide a written response and cure the alleged violation or failure to \n13  perform.  Consent Decree § 16.1.  If the violation or failure is not cured within that time frame, the parties \n14  will meet and confer in person or by telephone, and attempt to resolve the dispute on an informal basis for a \n15  period of at least thirty (30) days.  Id.  If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute informally, they will \n16  try to resolve it through mediation.  Id. § 16.2.  If mediation fails, then either party may file a motion with \n17  the Court to enforce the Consent Decree.  Id. § 16.3. \n18  8.  Release of Class Claims \n19  In exchange for the injunctive relief proposed in the Consent Decree, Plaintiff and members of the \n20  settlement class shall release any injunctive, declaratory, or non-monetary claims against the City that were \n21  brought, could have been brought, or could be brought now or in the future by the Settlement Class relating \n22  to or arising from any of the City’s alleged actions, omissions, incidents, or conduct related to the \n23  installation, remediation, repair or maintenance of curb ramps in the City’s pedestrian right of way at any \n24  time prior to the effective date of the Consent Decree through the end of the Term.  Consent Decree § 18.  \n25  The release excludes claims for monetary damages, personal injuries or property damage with respect to \n26  unnamed Settlement Class Members.  Id.

Payments to Plaintiff Lashbrook \n2  Subject to Court approval, the City will pay Plaintiff Lashbrook $5,000 in recognition of the \n3  services he rendered to the Settlement Class.  Consent Decree § 17.  Class Counsel will file a separate \n4  motion for approval of the proposed $5,000 service award along with their motion for reasonable attorneys’ \n5  fees, expenses, and costs.  Id. § 15.5.

Consent Decree § \n11  20.  Plaintiff will seek reasonable attorneys’ fees pursuant to the “lodestar” method.  See, e.g., In re \n12  Hyundai and Kia Fuel Econ.

Plaintiff will also seek reimbursement for costs of \n14  $12,300, which includes all costs incurred to date as well as additional costs that will be incurred between \n15  now and the effective date of the Consent Decree.  Consent Decree § 20. \n16  Finally, the City will pay Plaintiff’s reasonable attorneys’ fees, expenses, and costs for work done \n17  in connection with monitoring the Decree, subject to limitations specified in the Decree, including caps of \n18  $75,000 per year for years 2020 through 2022, and $50,000 per year for years 2023 through the Term of \n19  the Decree.  Consent Decree § 21.1.  The Decree also provides compensation to the prevailing party for \n20  dispute resolution under civil rights law.  Id. § 21.4. \n21  IV.  LEGAL ARGUMENT \n22  A.  The Settlement Class Merits Class Certification. \n23 \n1.  Plaintiff’s Claims Are Inherently Systemic and Therefore Appropriate for Class-\nWide Resolution. \n24 \n25  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 was designed for civil rights cases such as this one.  The Ninth \n26  Circuit has explained that cases like this that allege systemic non-compliance with Title II of the Americans \n27  with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section 504”) are well-\n28 \n9 \n \nPLS.’ MEM.

See Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, \n3  868-70 (9th Cir. 2001).  Similarly, where the plaintiff alleges widespread barriers that are the result of \n4  system-wide policy failures, courts favor certification because they can assess the public entity’s liability \n5  without having to separately adjudicate the effect of each alleged barrier on individual class members.  See, \n6  e.g., Californians for Disability Rights, Inc. v. Cal. Dept. of Transp., 249 F.R.D. 334, 345-46 (N.D. Cal. \n7  2008) (“Caltrans”). \n8  Accordingly, in cases such as this one, where the Plaintiff alleges widespread physical access \n9  barriers resulting from a public entity’s system-wide policy failures, federal courts have repeatedly and \n10  routinely certified classes of persons with mobility impairments affected by such barriers.  Indeed, every \n11  Judge in this Circuit that has addressed class certification in the context of contested allegations involving \n12  system-wide barriers on a public entity’s pedestrian rights of way has certified the proposed class.  See, e.g., \n13  Barden v. City of Sacramento, 292 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir. 2002); Kirola v. City and County of San Francisco, \n14  No. C 07-03685 SBA (N.D. Cal. June 7, 2010) (ECF No. 285); Caltrans, 249 F.R.D. at 345; Willits v. City \n15  of L.A., No. CV 10-05782 CBM (RZx), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155103, at *n.5 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 3, 2011); \n16  Ochoa, et al. v. City of Long Beach, No. 2:14-cv-04307-DSF-FFM (C.D. Cal. Sept. 15, 2015) (ECF No. \n17  90).  In short, it is highly likely that Plaintiff’s claims would be certified irrespective of settlement.   \n18  2.  Legal Standard \n19  In accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a), class certification is proper if: (1) the \n20  class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact \n21  common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or \n22  defenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \n23  class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  In addition, the proposed class must be certifiable under one of the three sub-\n24  provisions of Rule 23(b).  Here, the parties seek certification under Rule 23(b)(2), pursuant to which class \n25  certification is proper if “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply \n26  generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate to the \n27  class as a whole.”  Fed.

The Requirements of Rule 23(a) Are Met.  \n2  a.  The Settlement Class Is Sufficiently Numerous. \n3  Numerosity demands that a class be large enough that joinder of all members would be \n4  impracticable.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  In this district, courts have routinely found that 40 class members \n5  is sufficient to meet the numerosity requirement.  Villalpando v. Exel Direct Inc., 303 F.R.D. 588, 605-06 \n6  (N.D. Cal. 2014); see also Rannis v. Recchia, 380 F. App’x 646, 651 (9th Cir. 2010) (“Although the 20–\n7  member class in this case could be considered ‘a jurisprudential rarity,’ [] the small class size does not \n8  preclude a finding that the numerosity requirement is met.”). \n9  There are approximately 156,778 individuals residing in the San Jose Census County Division \n10  who have a mobility disability.  See U.S. Census Bureau, American Fact Finder, Table B99185, \n11  Allocation of Ambulatory Difficulty for the Civilian Non-institutionalized Population 5 Years and \n12  Over; Dardarian Decl. ¶ 52.  Such evidence is sufficient to establish numerosity.  See Caltrans, 249 F.R.D. \n13  at 347; Willits, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155103, at *8.  Thousands more individuals with mobility \n14  disabilities likely travel through San Jose each year due to its status as a major technology hub and tourist \n15  destination.  Accordingly, the Settlement Class likely numbers in the hundreds of thousands, making \n16  joinder highly impracticable.  As such, the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a) is satisfied. \n17  b.  There Are Questions of Law and Fact Common to the Class. \n18  The commonality prerequisite concerns the existence of questions of law and/or fact common to the \n19  class and is “construed permissively.”  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 1998).  To \n20  satisfy commonality, at least one common contention must be capable of classwide resolution.  Wal-Mart \n21  Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011).  “[T]he key inquiry is not whether the plaintiffs have raised \n22  common questions, . . . but rather, whether class treatment will ‘generate common answers apt to drive the \n23  resolution of the litigation.’”  Abdullah v. U.S. Sec. Assoc., Inc., 731 F.3d 952, 957 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting \n24  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 351). \n25  Plaintiff’s claims, as set forth in the Complaint, raise several common issues of law and fact, \n26  including the following:  \n27 \n28 \n11 \n \nPLS.’ MEM.

Whether Defendant, by its actions and omissions alleged herein, has had a policy of \n17  discriminating against Plaintiff and other persons with mobility disabilities in violation of applicable federal \n18  and state disability access laws.  \n19  These common questions of law and fact rely on common contentions that are not affected by the \n20  circumstances of any individual class member.  Such questions are therefore capable of generating \n21  common answers and thus are appropriate for class-wide resolution.  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 351. \n22  4.  Plaintiff’s Claims Are Typical of the Class. \n23  The typicality prerequisite of Rule 23(a)(3) is met if Plaintiff’s claims “are reasonably co-extensive \n24  with those of absent class members; they need not be substantially identical.”  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020.  \n25  Like all members of the Settlement Class, Plaintiff has a mobility disability.

Plaintiff Is an Adequate Class Representative. \n6  The adequacy prerequisite of Rule 23(a) requires that the “representative parties will fairly and \n7  adequately protect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  Proposed class representatives and \n8  their counsel may not have conflicts of interest with the class and must vigorously prosecute the action on \n9  behalf of the class.  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020.  Here, the interests of the Plaintiff and putative class \n10  members are aligned.  The harm that Plaintiff alleges and the injunctive relief that he requests is \n11  generalizable to the entire Settlement Class.  Additionally, Plaintiff is committed to improving access for \n12  persons with mobility disabilities, has acted vigorously to pursue injunctive relief on behalf of the entire \n13  Settlement Class over a six-year period, and will monitor implementation of the Consent Decree if it is \n14  approved.  Lashbrook Decl. ¶¶ 10-14.  He is not aware of any conflicts of interest that would affect his \n15  ability to fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Settlement Class.  Id.; Caltrans, 249 F.R.D. at \n16  348; Willits, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155103, at **13-14.   \n17 \n6.  Plaintiff’s Counsel Are Adequate to Represent the Class and Satisfy the Requirements \nof Rule 23(g). \n18 \n19  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(g)(1)(A), the court must assess four factors in \n20  appointing class counsel: “(i) the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential claims in \n21  the action; (ii) counsel’s experience in handling class actions, other complex litigation, and the types of \n22  claims asserted in the action; (iii) counsel’s knowledge of the applicable law; and (iv) the resources that \n23  counsel will commit to representing the class.”  Here, all four factors weigh in favor of appointing \n24  Goldstein Borgen Dardarian & Ho (“GBDH”) and the Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center \n25  (“CREEC”) as class counsel.   \n26  First, the work performed by Class Counsel has resulted in a complete understanding of the class \n27  claims resolved by the Consent Decree.  During the structured negotiations process, Class Counsel received \n28 \n13 \n \nPLS.’ MEM. OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF MOT. FOR PRELIM.

Moreover, the curb ramp survey required by the parties’ Interim Settlement \n4  Agreement produced comprehensive information that the parties shared regarding the presence and \n5  condition of curb ramps within the City.  Id. ¶ 7.  With that information in hand, the parties were able to \n6  negotiate a settlement that will bring the City into compliance with applicable disability access laws on a \n7  realistic schedule.  In short, proposed Class Counsel have fully vetted the claims subject to the Consent \n8  Decree. \n9  Second, GBDH and CREEC have extensive experience in handling class actions and complex \n10  litigation generally, and systemic disability access cases specifically.  GBDH is a plaintiffs’ civil rights, \n11  employment discrimination, and wage and hour class action law firm specializing in class actions and \n12  complex litigation.  Dardarian Decl. ¶ 29.  Led by partner Linda M. Dardarian, GBDH’s disability rights \n13  practice has enforced compliance with the ADA, Section 504, and state disability rights laws and achieved \n14  access for persons with disabilities to the services, privileges and advantages provided by public and private \n15  entities nationwide.  Id.  GBDH currently serves as class counsel in Willits v. City of Los Angeles, No. CV \n16  10-05782 CBM RZX, and Ochoa v. City of Long Beach, No. CV 14-04307 DSF FFM, certified class \n17  actions alleging that the defendant entities have unlawfully failed to make their pedestrian rights of way, \n18  including curb ramps, crosswalks, and sidewalks, accessible to persons with mobility impairments, in \n19  violation of Title II of the ADA and Section 504.  Id. ¶¶ 35-37.  Both of those matters settled on a class \n20  basis with Consent Decrees that provide extensive improvements to the pedestrian rights of way in the \n21  cities of Los Angeles and Long Beach, California.  The Willits matter in particular is historic in its reach, \n22  securing approximately $1.4 billion in improvements to existing pedestrian facilities, as well as unlimited \n23  amounts on newly constructed and altered facilities.  Id. ¶ 37.  In addition, GBDH and co-counsel CREEC \n24  are actively monitoring class action settlements that they reached with the City of Seattle in Reynoldson v. \n25  City of Seattle, No. CV 15-01608 BJR, which provides for the installation and remediation of 22,500 curb \n26  ramps in the Seattle pedestrian right of way at a rate of 1,250 curb ramps each year for an 18-year period; \n27  and Hines v.

Declaration of Tim Fox (“Fox Decl.”) ¶ 2.  CREEC \n6  was founded by Tim Fox and Amy Robertson in 2013.  Id.  Mr. Fox and Ms. Robertson had previously \n7  been shareholders in the for-profit law firm of Fox & Robertson.  Id.  Fox & Robertson and CREEC have \n8  successfully litigated numerous disability rights cases, including more than 15 class actions under state and \n9  federal disability rights laws.  Id. ¶ 3.  In addition to Reynoldson and Hines, described above, CREEC is \n10  class counsel in Denny v. City and County of Denver, Case Number 2016CV030247 (Denver District \n11  Court), which involves alleged widespread violations of curb ramp requirements in Denver.  Id. ¶ 6.  After \n12  two years of negotiation, the parties reached a settlement requiring the City to, among other things, conduct \n13  a complete survey of Denver street corners and curb ramps, and to bring those corners and curb ramps into \n14  compliance with federal law.  Id.  In addition, CREEC is class counsel in King v. City of Colorado Springs, \n15  No. 1:19-cv-00829-JLK (D. Colo. Oct. 1, 2019), which involved missing and noncompliant curb ramps in \n16  Colorado Springs.  The parties ultimately reached a settlement requiring the City to construct a minimum \n17  of 1,100 compliant curb ramps each year until at least 15,400 curb ramps are constructed.  Id. ¶ 4. \n18  Third, proposed Class Counsel are highly knowledgeable regarding disability access laws.  GBDH \n19  and CREEC have years of experience litigating under federal and state disability access laws, and in \n20  particular prosecuting claims against government entities pursuant to Title II of the ADA and Section 504.  \n21  Dardarian Decl. ¶¶ 32-38; Fox Decl. ¶¶ 3-8.  \n22  Fourth, proposed Class Counsel have committed significant resources to this matter.  Dardarian \n23  Decl. ¶ 50; Fox Decl. ¶ 12.  Over the past six years, they have pursued this action vigorously on behalf of \n24  the Settlement Class without any compensation.

Dardarian Decl. ¶ 51; Fox Decl. ¶ 11.   \n4  7.  The Requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) Are Satisfied. \n5  A class action may be certified under Rule 23(b)(2) where “the party opposing the class has acted \n6  or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding \n7  declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  “[T]he primary \n8  role of this provision has always been the certification of civil rights class actions.”  Parsons v. Ryan, 754 \n9  F.3d 657, 686 (9th Cir. 2014); see also Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 614 (1997).  For a \n10  class to be certified under Rule 23(b)(2), “it is sufficient if class members complain of a pattern or practice \n11  that is generally applicable to the class,” even if not all class members have been injured by the challenged \n12  practice.  Walters v. Reno, 145 F. 3d 1032, 1047 (9th Cir. 1988).  The requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) are \n13  “almost automatically satisfied in actions primarily seeking injunctive relief.”  Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, \n14  58 (3d Cir. 1994).  \n15  The claims brought in this case are precisely the type of claims that Rule 23(b)(2) was intended to \n16  cover.  Here, Plaintiff seeks broad declaratory and injunctive relief—system-wide improvements in the \n17  City’s pedestrian rights of way—on behalf of a large class of all City residents and visitors with mobility \n18  disabilities who are being denied access due to alleged deficiencies in Defendants’ policies and practices.  \n19  Additionally, the Settlement Class seeks only class-wide injunctive relief to address the alleged \n20  deficiencies, and does not seek any damages.  \n21  Similar cases alleging that state or local governments violated the ADA and/or Section 504 by \n22  failing to provide access to the pedestrian right of way for persons with mobility disabilities have been \n23  certified for class treatment under Rule 23(b)(2), either through the parties’ stipulation or court \n24  adjudication.

Plaintiff should also be \n7  appointed Settlement Class Representative, and Plaintiff’s counsel should be appointed Settlement Class \n8  Counsel pursuant to Rule 23(g). \n9  B.  The Consent Decree Is Fair, Reasonable, and Adequate, and Should Be Approved. \n10  Pursuant to Rule 23, a class action may only be settled with court approval.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e).  \n11  Rule 23(e) makes clear that preliminary approval should be granted only upon a showing that the court will \n12  likely approve the settlement as “fair, reasonable, and adequate” under Rule 23(e)(2).  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n13  23(e)(1)(B)(i).  Rule 23(e)(2) requires courts to examine whether (1) the class representatives and class \n14  counsel have adequately represented the class; (2) the proposal was negotiated at arm’s length; (3) the relief \n15  provided for the class is adequate; and (4) the proposal treats class members equitably relative to each \n16  other.  These factors support preliminary approval here. \n17  1.  Class Counsel Have Adequately Represented the Settlement Class. \n18  The first factor assesses whether “the class representatives and class counsel have adequately \n19  represented the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(A).  As discussed in Section IV.A.5-6, Plaintiff Lashbrook \n20  and proposed Class Counsel are adequate representatives because they have no conflicts of interest with the \n21  Settlement Class and have vigorously advanced the interests of the Settlement Class throughout nearly six \n22  years of structured negotiations that resulted in a settlement that requires an accessible curb ramp at every \n23  corner of the City’s pedestrian right of way.  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020.  Accordingly, this factor weighs in \n24  favor of preliminary approval.  \n25  2.  The Consent Decree Was Negotiated at Arm’s Length. \n26  The second factor assesses whether the proposed settlement was negotiated at arm’s length.  Fed. R. \n27  Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(B).  Here, the negotiations were adversarial and at arm’s length at all times.  At the outset \n28 \n17 \n \nPLS.’ MEM. OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF MOT. FOR PRELIM. APPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT \nCASE NO. 20-CV-01236-NC \n765 328.25 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 10   Filed 04/21/20   Page 26 of 33\n \n1  of the negotiations, the City took the position that Plaintiff’s claims were barred by the statute of \n2  limitations.  The City agreed to negotiate only after Plaintiff provided significant authority demonstrating \n3  that his claims are viable.  Settlement discussions were then conducted pursuant to a formal agreement that \n4  preserved the rights of all parties during the pendency of the negotiations and clearly identified the topics \n5  that would be addressed through structured negotiations.  The Consent Decree was negotiated over a period \n6  of nearly six years and finalized only after the City had performed a comprehensive survey of its curb \n7  ramps.  This demonstrates that the negotiations were fully informed and not rushed in any way.  See \n8  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1027 (“There is no evidence to suggest that the settlement was negotiated in haste or in \n9  the absence of information illuminating the value of plaintiffs’ claims.”). \n10  Moreover, the Consent Decree withstands the heightened level of scrutiny applicable to pre-\n11  certification class action settlements.  Class settlements reached prior to formal class certification must be \n12  examined for “evidence of collusion or other conflicts of interest.”  In re Bluetooth Headset Prods. Liab. \n13  Litig., 654 F.3d 935, 946-47 (9th Cir. 2011).  The Ninth Circuit has identified three “subtle signs” that may \n14  indicate collusion: “(1) when counsel receive a disproportionate distribution of the settlement, or when the \n15  class receives no monetary distribution but class counsel are amply rewarded; (2) when the parties \n16  negotiate a ‘clear sailing’ arrangement providing for the payment of attorneys’ fees separate and apart from \n17  class funds . . . ; and (3) when the parties arrange for fees not awarded to revert to defendants rather than be \n18  added to the class fund.”  Id. \n19  The mere presence of Bluetooth indicia does not foreclose settlement approval.  Where “the fee \n20  award is clearly reasonable as viewed through the appropriate application of either the lodestar or \n21  percentage-of-recovery methods, the chance of collusion narrows to a slim possibility.”  Laguna v. \n22  Coverall N. Am., Inc., 753 F.3d 918, 925 (9th Cir. 2014) (vacated after appeal dismissed).  Moreover, “it is \n23  sufficient that a district court recognizes and balances potentially collusive provisions … against the other \n24  terms of the settlement agreement.”  Id.  “It is the settlement taken as a whole, rather than the individual \n25  component parts, that must be examined for overall fairness.”  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1026.   \n26  Here, the Consent Decree provides the class with injunctive relief only.  The Decree neither creates \n27  a settlement fund, nor releases class damages claims.  The class wide injunctive relief is substantial, and \n28 \n18 \n \nPLS.’ MEM.

Accordingly, Class Counsel will not receive a disproportionate amount \n2  of any monetary settlement and the amount of attorneys’ fees awarded by the Court will have no impact on \n3  the relief provided to the Settlement Class.  The first and third Bluetooth indicia are not applicable to the \n4  present matter.   \n5  The second Bluetooth indicia—a “clear sailing” provision—is present in the Consent Decree.  \n6  Although the City has agreed to pay up to $734,627.50 to resolve Plaintiff’s claim for reasonable attorneys’ \n7  fees and costs, there is nothing collusive about this arrangement.  First, the parties did not negotiate \n8  attorneys’ fees and costs until after all relief issues had been resolved.  Dardarian Decl. ¶ 10.  Thus, there \n9  was no opportunity for Class Counsel to “pursu[e] their self-interest to the detriment of the class’s interest.”  \n10  Laguna, 753 F.3d at 925.  Second, the amount of agreed-upon attorneys’ fees and costs are amply justified \n11  under the lodestar method.  Plaintiff’s reasonable attorneys’ fees are supported by detailed, \n12  contemporaneous billing records documenting the work performed by Class Counsel on behalf of the \n13  Class.  Finally, the Consent Decree represents an outstanding result for the Settlement Class, including \n14  extensive injunctive relief valued at over $130 million.  When the clear sailing provision is viewed within \n15  the context of the Consent Decree as a whole, it becomes obvious that this provision is not collusive.  Put \n16  differently, the substantial benefits of the Consent Decree demonstrate that the interests of Class Counsel \n17  did not “infect the negotiations.”  In re Bluetooth Headset Prods. Liab. Litig., 654 F.3d at 947. \n18  3.  The Consent Decree Represents an Outstanding Result for the Settlement Class. \n19  The third factor assesses whether “the relief provided for the class is adequate, taking into account: \n20  (i) the costs, risks, and delay of trial and appeal; (ii) the effectiveness of any proposed method of \n21  distributing relief to the class, including the method of processing class-member claims; (iii) the terms of \n22  any proposed award of attorney’s fees, including timing of payment; and (iv) any agreement required to be \n23  identified under Rule 23(e)(3).”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(C).  “This inquiry focuses on ‘substantive fairness \n24  and adequacy,’ and evaluates ‘plaintiffs’ expected recovery balanced against the value of the settlement \n25  offer.’”  In re MyFord Touch Consumer Litig., No. 13-cv-03072-EMC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53356, at \n26  **26-27 (citing In re Tableware Antitrust Litig., 484 F. Supp. 2d at 1080.). \n27  The Consent Decree provides a significant benefit to Settlement Class Members.

Dardarian Decl. ¶ 3.  Moreover, the City \n3  constructed or remediated approximately 600 curb ramps per year based on annual expenditures of \n4  approximately $1.25 and $1.75 million dollars.  Id. ¶ 4.  At the City’s previous pace of construction, it \n5  would have taken the City approximately 46 years to construct and remediate the 27,621 curb ramps \n6  identified as missing or non-compliant through the City’s curb ramp survey.  Id. \n7  In contrast, the Consent Decree requires the City to be fully ramped within 18 years.  It requires the \n8  City to construct or remediate 1,944 high priority curb ramps per year between the Decree’s effective date \n9  and 2030, and 807 low priority curb ramps per year between the years 2031 and 2038.  Consent Decree § \n10  5.2.  It also requires the City to appropriate thirteen million dollars ($13 million) each fiscal year for curb \n11  ramp construction and remediation until 2030.  Id. ¶ 5.1.  Thereafter, the City must allocate a minimum of \n12  ten (10) percent of the City’s pavement budget toward the construction and remediation of curb ramps until \n13  the City fulfills its obligations under the Consent Decree.  Id.  The Consent Decree also improves the City’s \n14  curb ramp request system, requiring enhanced notice to requestors and reducing wait time for curb ramp \n15  fulfillment from approximately one year to 120 days.  Id. ¶ 11.4.  Class Counsel are confident that the curb \n16  ramp work required by the Consent Decree is sufficient to provide for a system of curb ramps that, when \n17  viewed in its entirety, will be readily accessible to persons with mobility disabilities.  Dardarian Decl. ¶ 11; \n18  Fox Decl. ¶ 13.  This is an excellent result for the Settlement Class, and it is unlikely that a court would \n19  order greater relief.  Id.  The Consent Decree provides Plaintiff and the Settlement Class full relief for the \n20  class’ claims.  Dardarian Decl. ¶ 12. \n21  The adequacy of the relief obtained through settlement is further supported by the potential costs, \n22  risks, and delay of trial and appeal.  See, e.g., Castaneda v.

Id.  \n4  The parties propounded and responded to hundreds of discovery requests, exchanged over 30,000 pages of \n5  documents, and conducted twenty-four depositions.  Id.  Similarly, in Willits v. City of Los Angeles, Case \n6  No. CV 10-05782 CBM (C.D. Cal.), the parties engaged in several years of extremely contentious litigation \n7  that involved proceedings in state and federal court at the trial and appellate court levels.  Id.  Before \n8  reaching a settlement, the parties propounded and responded to hundreds of discovery requests, exchanged \n9  over 4 million pages of documents, and conducted thirty-four depositions.  Id.  Litigation of this matter \n10  would be similarly protracted and costly. \n11  The method of providing relief to the Settlement Class is also fair, reasonable, and adequate.  As \n12  discussed above, curb ramp construction and remediation will be prioritized so that the most severe curb \n13  ramp barriers will be removed first.  All High Priority Curb Ramp Barriers will be addressed by 2030.  \n14  Less severe curb ramp barriers will be addressed by 2038.  Also, all program access improvements will be \n15  performed in a way that gives preference to curb ramps that serve areas prioritized in 28 C.F.R. § 35.150 \n16  (i.e. government offices and facilities, transportation corridors, hospitals, areas of employment, and finally \n17  residential areas). \n18  Finally, the parties’ agreement regarding attorneys’ fees supports adequacy.  The City has agreed \n19  not to oppose Plaintiff’s modest request of $734,627.50 in reasonable attorneys’ fees, expenses, and costs.  \n20  Plaintiff will file a motion demonstrating the reasonableness of the requested attorneys’ fees pursuant to \n21  the “lodestar” method, which is the appropriate method for determining attorneys’ fees in civil rights cases.  \n22  Muniz v. UPS, 738 F.3d 214, 222 (9th Cir. 2013).  Moreover, Plaintiff intends to file this motion thirty-\n23  five (35) days prior to the objection deadline so that Settlement Class Members will have ample \n24  opportunity to review Plaintiff’s request for attorneys’ fees, expenses, and costs. \n25  Thus, the adequacy of the relief supports preliminary approval.5 \n26   \n4 GBDH served as class counsel in both the Ochoa and Willits matters. \n27 \n5 The final factor set forth in Rule 23(e)(2)(C) is not applicable here as all agreements made by the \n28  parties are set forth in the Consent Decree. \n21 \n \nPLS.’ MEM.

The Consent Decree Treats Class Members Equitably Relative to Each Other. \n2  The Consent Decree does not provide preferential treatment to any subset of the Settlement Class.  \n3  All Settlement Class Members will share equally in the City-wide removal of curb ramp barriers.  Once a \n4  particular curb ramp barrier is removed, Settlement Class Members will benefit equally from the improved \n5  access at that location.  In addition, all Settlement Class Members will have an equal opportunity to avail \n6  themselves of the improved curb ramp request system. \n7  Plaintiff Lashbrook’s proposed service award and damages payment do not make the Consent \n8  Decree inequitable.  In the Ninth Circuit, service awards are routinely awarded and do not render class \n9  action settlements unfair.  Staton v. Boeing Co., 327 F.3d 938, 976 (9th Cir. 2003).  Moreover, $5,000 \n10  service awards are considered “presumptively reasonable” in the Northern District of California.  Dyer v. \n11  Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 303 F.R.D. 326, 335 (N.D. Cal. 2014).  Similarly, there is nothing unfair about \n12  Plaintiff’s $50,000 individual payment.  The Consent Decree does not release damages claims for \n13  Settlement Class Members, and thus they may still pursue such claims against the City.  Moreover, large \n14  disparities in the amount of damage awards between the named an unnamed class members are reasonable \n15  if justified by the record.  Staton, 327 F.3d at 978; In re MyFord Touch Consumer Litig., No. 13-cv-03072-\n16  EMC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53356, at *36 (N.D. Cal. March 28, 2019).  Here, Plaintiff Lashbrook \n17  encountered thousands of curb ramp barriers in the City, and was thrown out of his wheelchair and left \n18  lying in the street on three occasions while descending non-compliant curb ramps.  Lashbrook Decl. ¶ 8. \n19  In sum, all relevant factors set forth in Rule 23(e)(2) support approval of the Consent Decree, and \n20  Plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to obtain final approval of the proposed settlement. \n21  C.  The Proposed Notice Satisfies Due Process and Should Be Approved. \n22  Under Rule 23(e)(1), the “court must direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class members who \n23  would be bound by the proposal” if justified by the parties’ showing.  Due process requires that interested \n24  parties be provided with notice reasonably calculated under the circumstances to apprise them of the \n25  pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.  See Mullane v. Cent. \n26  Hanover Bank & Tr. Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950).  Notice is satisfactory “if it ‘generally describes the \n27  terms of the settlement in sufficient detail to alert those with adverse viewpoints to investigate and to come \n28 \n22 \n \nPLS.’ MEM.

Additionally, notice must be reasonably calculated to \n3  reach interested parties.  Mullane, 339 U.S. at 318. \n4  The notice standard is satisfied here.  Within thirty (30) days after issuance of the Preliminary \n5  Approval Order, the City will cause notice of the settlement to be published once each week for four (4) \n6  consecutive weeks in The San Jose Mercury News, a paper of general circulation.  Consent Decree § 15.4.  \n7  Such Notice will include: (i) a brief statement describing this action, the settlement embodied in the \n8  Consent Decree, and the claims released by the Settlement Class; (ii) the date and time of the Fairness \n9  Hearing and/or Final Approval Hearing of the proposed Consent Decree; (iii) the deadline for submitting \n10  objections to the proposed Consent Decree; and (iv) the web page, address, and telephone and fax numbers \n11  that may be used to obtain a copy of the Notice of Settlement (substantially in the form attached to the \n12  Consent Decree as Exhibit B).

Id.  The list of organizations is Exhibit E to the Consent Decree. \n22  The parties have developed this proposed plan for distribution of the Notice taking into account the \n23  breadth and magnitude of the Settlement Class.  Distribution of the Notice through publication in a local \n24  newspaper and posting on multiple accessible websites, coupled with facilitating the direct mailing or \n25  emailing of the notice to organizations that serve Settlement Class Members, will ensure that the notice \n26  reaches the maximum number of members of the Settlement Class in the most efficient and cost-effective \n27  manner.

The Court Should Approve the Proposed Scheduling Order, Including Setting a Date for the \nFairness Hearing. \n5 \n6  Once a court grants preliminary approval and notice is provided, the court conducts a “fairness \n7  hearing,” at which all interested parties have an opportunity to be heard.  At such a hearing, the court \n8  conducts a substantive evaluation of the proposed settlement to determine whether it is “fundamentally fair, \n9  adequate, and reasonable.”  See Officers for Justice v.

Nos. 20, 21, 22 \n sir\netattsiD 16       \nS \n n\ndr 17  The Parties have applied to the Court for an order finally approving the settlement \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  of this action in accord with the Proposed Consent Decree (“Decree”), which sets forth the \nN\n19  terms and conditions of a proposed settlement and dismissal of the action with prejudice, \n20  with the Court retaining jurisdiction to enforce the Decree throughout its term.  Plaintiff \n21  Artie Lashbrook also moves for an award of attorneys’ fees and a service award pursuant \n22  to the parties’ Decree.  Having read the papers submitted and carefully considered the \n23  arguments and relevant legal authority, and good cause appearing, the Court GRANTS the \n24  Parties’ Joint Motion for Final Approval of Class Action Settlement, Lashbrook’s Motion \n25  for Service Award and Motion for Attorneys’ Fees. \n26  NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED: \n27  1.  On September 2, 2020, the Court conducted a final hearing to approve the \n28  Decree. \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 25   Filed 09/02/20   Page 2 of 8\n \n1  2.  The Court finds that the parties provided notice to the Class in substantially \n2  the manner and form preliminarily approved by the Court.  See Dkt. No. 14.  The \n3  Settlement Notice, as ordered and implemented, was reasonably calculated under the \n4  circumstances to apprise the Settlement Class Members of the pendency of this action, all \n5  material elements of the proposed Settlement, and their opportunity (a) to submit written \n6  objections to the Settlement, and (b) to appear at the Fairness Hearing to object to or \n7  comment on the Settlement.  The Settlement Notice was reasonable and the best notice \n8  practicable to all Settlement Class Members and complied with the Federal Rules of Civil \n9  Procedure, due process, and all other applicable laws and rules.  A full and fair opportunity \n10  has been afforded to the members of the Settlement Class to participate during the Fairness \n11  Hearing, and all other persons wishing to be heard have been heard. \na  12  3.  On May 27, 2020, this Court granted the Parties’ Joint Motion for Class \ntr in\nur\noo 13  Certification, preliminarily certifying a class for declaratory and injunctive relief.  See Dkt. \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  Nos. 10, 14.  The Court found, for purposes of settlement only, that the requirements of \nrts fo\niD tc 15  Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are met by the Settlement Class: (a) \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  joinder of all Settlement Class Members in a single proceeding would be impracticable, if \nS \n n\ndr 17  not impossible, because of their numbers and dispersion; (b) there are questions of law and \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  fact common to the Settlement Class; (c) Lashbrook’s claims are typical of the claims of \nN\n19  the Settlement Class that he seeks to represent for purposes of settlement; (d) Lashbrook \n20  has fairly and adequately represented the interests of the Settlement Class and will \n21  continue to do so; (e) Lashbrook and the Settlement Class are represented by qualified, \n22  reputable counsel who are experienced in preparing and prosecuting class actions, \n23  including those involving the allegations made in the Complaint; and (f) the City acted or \n24  refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the Settlement Class, so that final \n25  declaratory and injunctive relief is appropriate to the Settlement Class.  Accordingly, the \n26  Court preliminarily certified the following Settlement Class pursuant to Federal Rule of \n27  Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2):  \n28  All persons (including residents of and/or visitors to the City of San Jose) \n  2 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 25   Filed 09/02/20   Page 3 of 8\n \n1  with any Mobility Disability, who, at any time prior to the Court granting \n2  final approval of the Consent Decree, have been denied full and equal access \n3  to the City’s pedestrian right of way due to the lack of a curb ramp or a curb \n4  ramp that was damaged, in need of repair, or otherwise in a condition not \n5  suitable or sufficient for use. \n6  Pursuant to Federal Rule Civil Procedure 23(c)(1)(B), the Court also appointed \n7  Lashbrook and his counsel as representatives of the Settlement Class. \n8  4.  For the reasons stated above, the Court finds that class certification is \n9  therefore an appropriate method for protecting the interests of the Settlement Class and \n10  resolving the common issues of fact and law arising out of the Lashbrook’s claims while \n11  also eliminating the risk of duplicative litigation.  Accordingly, the Court hereby makes \na  12  final its earlier provisional certification of the Settlement Class and further confirms the \ntr in\nur\noo 13  appointment of the Class Representative and Class Counsel to represent the Settlement \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  Class, as set forth above. \nrts fo\niD tc 15  5.  The Court grants final approval of the Settlement set forth in the Consent \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Decree and finds, after considering all of the factors set forth in Federal Rule of Civil \nS \n n\ndr 17  Procedure 23(e)(2), that it is fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the best interests of the \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  Settlement Class as a whole.  The Settlement, which was negotiated at arm’s length, offers \nN\n19  Settlement Class members comprehensive injunctive relief regarding all of the claims in \n20  Lashbrook’s Complaint, and treats Settlement Class members equitably relative to each \n21  other.  The Court grants final approval of the release of the City from the Released Claims \n22  as set forth in the Consent Decree. \n23  6.  To summarize, the Decree requires the City of San Jose to remediate all \n24  missing and non-compliant curb ramps by 2038.  It requires the City to allocate a \n25  minimum amount of money per year towards its construction and remediation obligations, \n26  while reaching certain milestones in ramp construction and remediation.  In the event the \n27  City is unable to appropriate the required annual monetary commitment, the Decree \n28  requires the City to make up the shortfall in subsequent years, preempt the shortfall in \n  3 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 25   Filed 09/02/20   Page 4 of 8\n \n1  previous years, or maintain an agreed-upon average rate of ramp construction and \n2  remediation.  The City is also required to maintain a Curb Ramp Request Program and \n3  comply with reporting and monitoring requirements.  In exchange, Lashbrook and \n4  members of the Class agree to release all injunctive, declaratory, or non-monetary claims \n5  related to the City’s alleged actions or omissions relating to the remediation or \n6  construction of curb ramps.  However, unnamed members of the Class do not release \n7  claims for monetary damages, personal injuries, or property damages.  Lashbrook releases \n8  all of his monetary claims related to his personal encounters with non-compliant curb \n9  ramps in exchange for a damages payment of $50,000. \n10  7.  The Court finds that the Decree is fair, adequate and reasonable to all \n11  potential Class Members.  The Parties have conducted an extensive evaluation of the \na  12  merits such that Counsel for both Parties are able to reasonably evaluate their respective \ntr in\nur\noo 13  positions.  Settlement will also avoid substantial additional costs to all Parties, as well as \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  avoid the delay and the risks presented by further prosecution of issues either in the current \nrts fo\niD tc 15  or separate litigation proceedings which are addressed by the Decree.  The results achieved \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  by the Decree are also in line with approved consent decrees in similar cases.  See, e.g., \nS \n n\ndr 17  Dkt. No. 10-1 (“Dardarian Decl.”), Ex. 8 (order granting preliminary approval of consent \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  decree in Hines v. City of Portland, Case No. 3:18-cv-00869-HZ (D. Or. June 4, 2019)).  \nN\n19  8.  The Court also finds that the Decree has been reached as the result of good \n20  faith, prolonged, serious, and non-collusive arms-length negotiations.  The Parties reached \n21  the Decree after six years of out-of-court negotiations.  At the preliminary approval \n22  hearing, the parties represented that they contested the merits of the class claims and \n23  engaged in extensive discovery and information sharing over the six-year period before \n24  reaching the Decree. \n25  9.  The Court further finds that the City’s Annual Commitment, which requires \n26  the installation or remediation of 27,621 Non-Compliant Curb Ramps by the end of 2038, \n27  as set forth in the Consent Decree is proper and reasonably calculated based on the \n28  available information to ensure and maintain accessibility of the pedestrian right of way \n  4 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 25   Filed 09/02/20   Page 5 of 8\n \n1  located in the City of San Jose to persons with Mobility Disabilities.  Accordingly, the \n2  Settlement shall be consummated in accordance with the terms and conditions of the \n3  Consent Decree \n4  10.  No Class Member has objected to the Settlement.  The absence of any \n5  objections further supports the Settlement’s final approval. \n6  11.  Lashbrook and all Settlement Class Members (and their respective heirs, \n7  assigns, successors, executors, administrators, agents and representatives) are conclusively \n8  deemed to have released and forever discharged the City from all Released Claims as set \n9  forth in the Consent Decree.  Specifically, Lashbrook and members of the Class agree to \n10  release all injunctive, declaratory, or non-monetary claims related to the City’s alleged \n11  actions or omissions relating to the remediation or construction of curb ramps.  Unnamed \na  12  members of the Class do not release claims for monetary damages, personal injuries, or \ntr in\nur\noo 13  property damages.  See Dkt. No. 22-1, Ex. 1 §§ 18, 19.  Lashbrook and all Settlement \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  Class Members are bound by this Judgment. \nrts fo\niD tc 15  12.  The benefits described in the Consent Decree are the only consideration, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  fees, costs and expenses that the City shall be obligated to give to any party or entity, \nS \n n\ndr 17  including without limitation the Class Representative, Settlement Class Members, and \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  Class Counsel in connection with the claims released in the Consent Decree and/or the \nN\n19  payment of attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses in this action. \n20  13.  The Consent Decree and this Judgment are not admissions of liability or fault \n21  by the City, or a finding of the validity of any claims in this action or of any wrongdoing or \n22  violation of law by the City.  The Consent Decree is not a concession by the Parties and, to \n23  the fullest extent permitted by law, neither this Judgment, nor any of its terms or \n24  provisions, nor any of the negotiations connected with it, shall be offered as evidence or \n25  received in evidence in any pending or future civil, criminal, or administrative action or \n26  proceeding to establish any liability of, or admission by the City. \n27  14.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Judgment shall be interpreted \n28  to prohibit the use of this Judgment to consummate or enforce the Consent Decree or \n  5 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-01236-NC   Document 25   Filed 09/02/20   Page 6 of 8\n \n1  Judgment, or to defend against the assertion of Released Claims in any other proceeding, \n2  or as otherwise required by law. \n3  15.  The Court approves Lashbrook’s requested service award of $5,000.  The \n4  Court finds that the requested award of $5,000 is reasonable and appropriate compensation \n5  for the work and risk undertaken by spearheading this litigation as the class representative. \n6  See, e.g., In re Mego Fin. Corp. Sec. Litig., 213 F.3d 454, 463 (9th Cir. 2000) (approving \n7  $5,000 to two plaintiff representatives of 5,400 potential class members in $1.75 million \n8  settlement); Hopson v.
