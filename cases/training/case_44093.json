Given the substantial overlap between the factual allegations and the legal contentions in the instant complaint and the issues to be resolved in the appeal of the Agnew case, Agnew v. Dist. of Columbia, No.15-0340, 2017 WL 2773517 (D.D.C. June 26, 2017), and the fact that an opinion by the D.C. Circuit in the Agnew case could control the outcome of aspects of the instant case, the Court finds that it will be much more efficient and will conserve both judicial resources and the resources of the parties to exercise the Court's discretion to stay this case pending the outcome of the appeal. Therefore, defendant's 16 motion for extension of time to respond to plaintiff's complaint is DENIED AS MOOT, and the case is stayed pending further order of the Court. SO ORDERED.

Dist. of Columbia, No.15-0340, 2017 WL 2773517 (D.D.C. June 26, 2017), given the fact that Claim 2 alleges in paragraph 215 that \"the incommoding statute is vague under the second prong of the vagueness doctrine, the arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement prong\" because \"the statute authorizes and even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement,\" see para. 216, and that is the very issue ruled on in Agnew, a case filed on behalf of the same putative class. Counsel should also take note that Claim 3 alleges that the statute is void for vagueness under \"the first prong of the vagueness doctrine,\" see para. 222, since it fails to put people on notice of what is prohibited, see para. 223-24, but paragraph 222 erroneously identifies the \"first prong\" as the \"arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement prong\" as well.

    "summary": "<p>This case concerns a public obstruction statute and police practices in the District of Columbia. On August 8, 2015, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (&ldquo;MPD&rdquo;) arrested a young Black man under D.C. Code &sect; 22-1307 (&ldquo;Statute&rdquo;). The Statute criminalizes &ldquo;crowding, obstructing, or incommoding&rdquo; public streets and sidewalks.</p>\r\n<p><br />On September 14, 2017, a young Black male individual brought a class action suit against the District of Columbia under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. He alleged that the MPD violated the Fourth Amendment by arresting him and having him prosecuted without probable cause. He also claimed the Statute was unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Fifth Amendment&rsquo;s Due Process Clause because it encouraged arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement and did not place ordinary people on notice of what it criminalized. The named plaintiff sought class certification, injunctive and declaratory relief, damages, and attorneys&rsquo; fees. He filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The case was assigned to District Judge Amy Berman Jackson.</p>\r\n<p><br />On September 15, 2017, Judge Jackson issued a notice of a related class action suit involving the Statute, <em>Agnew</em> <em>v. Gov&rsquo;t of District of Columbia</em>, 263 F. Supp. 3d 89 (D.D.C. 2017). The plaintiffs in <em>Agnew</em> appealed the District Court&rsquo;s judgment against them on July 27, 2017. Given the similar factual circumstances and legal questions in <em>Agnew</em>, Judge Jackson stayed the litigation in this case pending the outcome of the <em>Agnew</em> appeal. After the <em>Agnew</em> plaintiffs lost their appeal, Judge Jackson ordered the named plaintiff in this case to file an amended complaint that eliminated the claims now barred by the <em>Agnew</em> decision.</p>\r\n<p><br />The named plaintiff filed an amended complaint on July 8, 2019, which added a claim that the District of Columbia had violated the Fifth Amendment&rsquo;s equal protection provision by enforcing the Statute in a racially discriminatory manner. The District of Columbia moved to dismiss the amended complaint on August 23, 2019. Judge Jackson dismissed the challenges under the discriminatory enforcement and due process prongs of the vagueness doctrine &nbsp;on July 1, 2020, holding that the D.C. Circuit&rsquo;s decision in Agnew barred any vagueness claims against the Statute. The Fourth Amendment and equal protection claims remained intact.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />On January 18, 2022, Judge Jackson stayed the litigation and referred the case to mediation. She extended the mediation period several times, and the parties filed more than ten joint status reports throughout 2022. The parties jointly moved for preliminary approval of a settlement agreement on December 9, 2022. The proposed settlement agreement provided that the named plaintiff would permanently dismiss his claims and allocated $290,000 for the class fund (with the named plaintiff receiving an additional $5,000), $130,000 for attorneys&rsquo; fees, and $25,000 for the cost of administering the funds. The court preliminarily approved this agreement on December 23, 2022.</p>\r\n<p><br />The parties jointly moved to modify the preliminary approval order on February 22, 2023. The court issued an amended preliminary approval order on February 23, which preliminarily approved the class certification and the terms of the settlement agreement. The court issued final approval of the class action settlement on July 24, 2023, and directed the Clerk of the Court to close the case. The Class Administrator made the last payment to class members on September 6, 2023. As of October 31, 2023, the case was closed.</p>",

    "summary_short": "A young Black male individual who was arrested under the District of Columbiaโs anti-โcrowding, obstructing, or incommodingโ statute brought a class action suit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against the District of Columbia. He alleged that the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department violated the Fourth Amendment by arresting him and having him prosecuted without probable cause and that the statute was unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Fifth Amendmentโs Due Process Clause. He filed the lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on September 14, 2017. The court stayed the litigation pending the resolution of the appeal in a related class action case, Agnew v. Gov't of District of Columbia, 263 F. Supp. 3d 89 (D.D.C. 2017), on February 14, 2018. When the Agnew plaintiffs lost their appeal, the court ordered the plaintiff in this case to file an amended complaint on May 16, 2019. The plaintiff did so on July 8, 2019, adding a racial discrimination claim under the Fifth Amendmentโs equal protection provision. The District moved to dismiss the amended complaint on August 23, 2019. The court dismissed the constitutional challenges to the Statute on July 1, 2020, holding that the Agnew decision barred those claims. On January 18, 2022, the court stayed the litigation and referred the case to mediation. The parties submitted a proposed settlement agreement to the court on December 9, 2022, which the court preliminarily approved on December 23, 2022. The court issued an amended preliminary approval order on February 23, 2023, which preliminarily approved the class certification and the terms of the settlement agreement. On July 24, 2023, the court finally approved the class action settlement, which provided that the named plaintiff would permanently dismiss his claims, and allocated $290,000 for the class fund, $130,000 for attorneysโ fees, and $25,000 for administration costs. The case is now closed.",

[t]he use of any street, avenue, alley, road, highway, or sidewalk.โ  \nD.C. Code ยง 22-1307.  He has filed a lawsuit against the District alleging that he was falsely \narrested in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and he has included claims on behalf of a proposed \nclass of individuals charged with the same offense alleging that the law is unconstitutionally vague \nand that it is being enforced by the police in a discriminatory manner in violation of the Fifth \nAmendment.  See Am. Compl. [Dkt. # 21].   \nOn August 23, 2019, defendant moved to dismiss plaintiffโs amended complaint, arguing \nthat he had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  Def.โs Mot. to Dismiss \n[Dkt. # 24] (โDef.โs Mot.โ); Def.โs Mem. of P. & A. in Supp. of Def.โs Mot. [Dkt. # 24-1] (โDef.โs \nMem.โ).  Plaintiff opposed the motion.  Pl.โs Opp. to Def.โs Mot. [Dkt. # 29] (โPl.โs Opp.โ).  For \nthe reasons stated below, defendantโs motion will be granted in part and denied in part.  Plaintiffโs \nclaims about the deficiencies of the statute merely repackage arguments that have already been \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 2 of 28\nrejected by this Court and the D.C. Circuit, and Claims 2 and 3 will be dismissed.  To the extent \nthat plaintiff seeks to predicate municipal liability for an allegedly unconstitutional arrest on a \nvicarious liability theory or a failure to supervise the arresting officer, his claims will be dismissed. \nBut if one resolves all inferences in favor of the plaintiff, as one is required to do at this stage, the \nclaim of false arrest in Claim 1 must go forward, and plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts in support \nof Claim 4 to survive a motion to dismiss his claim that the District is liable based on its failure to \nact in response to a pattern of unconstitutional arrests that have become a matter of custom.  The \nCourt expresses no view as to whether plaintiff will ultimately be able to succeed on these claims, \nbut it would be premature to dispose of them at this time. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  Factual Background \nOn Saturday, August 8, 2015, at about 5:30 pm, plaintiff was standing in an alley that \nintersects with Benning Road in Northeast, Washington, D.C.  Am. Compl. ยถยถ 25, 27.  The alley \ncomes to an end at a wide sidewalk where a popular convenience store and pay phone were located.  \nId. ยถยถ 27โ33.  Plaintiff states that he moved from the alley to the โintersection of the alley and the \nsidewalkโ when Officer Frederick Onoja, a member of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, \narrived on the scene.  Id. ยถ 35.  The complaint alleges that plaintiff was not blocking passage or \npresenting an obstacle to pedestrian traffic on the sidewalk; others were able to walk past him, \nincluding a woman walking two dogs.  Id. ยถ 37.  Officer Onoja approached plaintiff and told him \nto leave the area.  Id. ยถ 38.  Plaintiff alleges that โhe did leave the area but over the next five \nminutes, [he] walked up and down the sidewalk a few times.โ  Id. ยถ 39.  Officer Onoja called for \nbackup and soon, three officers arrived.  Id. ยถ 40.  They all stood by the alley while plaintiff came \nback down the sidewalk towards them.  Id.  When plaintiff passed Officer Onoja, the officer \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 3 of 28\ngrabbed him from behind, and the other officers converged on plaintiff and handcuffed him.  Id. \nยถยถ 41โ43.  Plaintiff was arrested for a violation of D.C. Code ยง 22-1307, and transported to the \nFifth District Police Station, where he was approved for release on citation.  Id. ยถยถ 44โ45.  The \nD.C. Office of the Attorney General then โno-paperedโ โ or declined to prosecute โ the case.  \nId. ยถ 46.   \nD.C. Code ยง 22-1307 states:  โ[i]t is unlawful for a person, alone or in concert with \nothers . . . [t]o crowd, obstruct, or incommode . . .  [t]he use of any street, avenue, alley, road, \nhighway, or sidewalk[.]โ  D.C. Code ยง 22-1307(a) (the โincommoding statuteโ).  Plaintiff contends \nthat  he  was  not  in  violation  of  the  statute  because  he  was  not  crowding,  obstructing,  or \nincommoding anyoneโs passage through the sidewalk.  Am. Compl. ยถ 49.  He also alleges that the \nstatute is โemployed especially against young African American men in the community most \nfrequently near areas such as the Trinidad area.โ  Id. ยถ 104; see also id. ยถ 196.  Plaintiff names \nother neighborhoods where the law has been heavily enforced, id. ยถยถ 115โ27, and he details several \nother instances in which African American individuals were arrested for a violation of the \nincommoding statute.  Id. ยถยถ 128โ85.   \nThe complaint goes into some detail about the history of the provision, which is one of \nseveral disorderly conduct provisions in the District, and circumstances that allegedly brought \nflaws in its enforcement to the Districtโs attention.  In 2010, the Council for Court Excellence \n(โCCEโ), with other groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (โACLUโ), the Office of \nthe Attorney General (โOAGโ), the District of Columbia U.S. Attorneyโs Office (โUSAOโ), and \nthe District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department (โMPDโ), issued a report regarding the \ndisorderly conduct statute, see D.C. Code ยง 22-1307, which included โincommodingโ at that time.  \nAm. Compl. ยถยถ 66โ67.  According to the complaint, the report recounted concerns expressed about \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 4 of 28\nthe vagueness of the law, and the CCEโs suggestion that the word โblockingโ be substituted for \nโobstructing,โ โcrowding,โ or โincommoding.โ  Id. ยถ 68.  The OAG, USAO, and MPD disagreed, \nalthough they proposed that a mens rea requirement be added to the statute as well as a requirement \nthat an officer issue a โstop blockingโ order before making an arrest.  Id. ยถ 71.  Despite the concerns \nraised in the CCE report, the D.C. Council enacted the statute as it reads now, without โblockingโ \nlanguage, a mens rea requirement, or a โstop blockingโ order requirement.  Id. ยถยถ 76โ77.   \nIn 2011, a journalist was videotaping police officers on a sidewalk in Northwest D.C., and \nthe  police  officers  ordered  him  to  leave,  stating  that  he  was  blocking  the  sidewalk.    Am. \nCompl. ยถยถ 80, 81.  The sidewalk was approximately twenty feet in width.  Id. ยถ 83.  The incident \ngained widespread attention because, as plaintiff puts it, it was evident that ordering the journalist \nto move was โpretext to get him to stop videotapingโ the police officers.  Id. ยถ 81.  The event led \nto an investigation into the issue of whether the statute was being enforced in an arbitrary or \ndiscriminatory manner.  Id. ยถยถ 87โ89.  Plaintiff alleges that during that investigation, D.C. Council \nMember Mary Cheh wrote a letter to the Council stating that the MPD was enforcing the law \narbitrarily.  Id. ยถ 89.  Plaintiff alleges that the D.C. Council did not take any steps to amend the \nstatute or address the issue of arbitrary enforcement.  Id. ยถ 91. \nOn February 1, 2012, the D.C. Council Committee on the Judiciary held a hearing on the \ninvestigation and heard testimony from the ACLU.  Am. Compl. ยถ 95.  At the hearing, the MPD \nDirector of Strategic Change testified that the Department had developed โa written directive \nexplaining the law and an online training session that could be delivered to all members of the \nMPD.  Id. ยถ 97.  All members were required to certify that they had reviewed the directive and \ntaken and passed the online training.โ  Id.  Plaintiff contends that โneither the written directive nor \nthe online training session addressed the issue of whether partial blocking was sufficient to justify \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 5 of 28\nan arrest.โ  Id. ยถ 98.  The D.C. Council recognized that additional training may be necessary, id. \nยถ 99, but none was instituted.  Id. ยถ 216.    \nPlaintiff also alleges that the MPD has received numerous complaints regarding the \nenforcement of the incommoding statute.  From 2013 to 2017, the Police Complaints Board \n(โPCBโ), which is the governing body of the Office of Police Complaints (โOPCโ), received \nfourteen complaints alleging that officers had improperly issued โmove alongโ orders or made \nunlawful arrests for violations of the incommoding statute.  Id. ยถ 187.  In a report submitted on \nMay 22, 2017 to D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, the PCB noted that a majority of individuals who \nfiled complaints were African American.  According to plaintiff, โ[t]he PCB is concerned that \nMPD officers[โ] use of the Blocking Passage statute is disproportionately discriminating against \nthese specific groups of people.โ  Id. ยถยถ 189โ90.  Plaintiff alleges that the District has not taken \nany steps to remediate the issues identified in this report.  See id. ยถยถ 214โ17.   \nII.  Procedural Background & the Agnew Litigation  \nOn June 26, 2017, the Court issued its decision in Agnew v. District of Columbia, 263 F. \nSupp. 3d 89 (D.D.C. 2017).  In that case, plaintiffs Daryl Thomas Agnew, Rashad Bugg Bey, Alex \nDennis, and Rayneka Williamson filed a complaint against the District of Columbia alleging that \ntheir constitutional rights had been violated when they were arrested and prosecuted pursuant to \nthe incommoding statute.  Id. at 91โ92.  They challenged the statute on its face on the grounds that \nit was unconstitutionally vague; the lawsuit centered around the allegation that the provision \nviolated the Fifth Amendment because it encouraged arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  \nThe Court found that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague, and because plaintiffs had failed \nto state a predicate constitutional violation, their 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 claim failed as well.  The \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 6 of 28\nplaintiffs appealed the decision on July 25, 2017.  See Notice of Appeal [Dkt. # 44], Agnew v. \nDistrict of Columbia, Civ. A. No. 15-0340 (D.D.C. July 25, 2017).     \nWhile the Agnew appeal was pending, plaintiff filed this case against the District of \nColumbia and Officer Onoja,1 Compl. [Dkt. # 1], including the following claims: \nClaim 1:  False arrest in violation of the Fourth Amendment, Compl. \nยถยถ 209โ12; \nClaim 2:  Arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the incommoding \nstatute, resulting in unlawful arrests, in violation of the Fifth Amendment, \nCompl. ยถยถ 213โ20; \nClaim 3:  Lack of fair notice, resulting in unlawful arrests, in violation of \nthe Fifth Amendment, Compl. ยถยถ 221โ27; and \nClaim 4:  Unlawful prosecutions, in violation of the Fourth and Fifth \nAmendment, Compl. ยถยถ 228โ31.   \nOn December 1, 2017, the Court ordered plaintiff to state his position on whether the case should \nbe stayed pending the appeal of Agnew v. District of Columbia, Civ. A. No. 15-0340, โgiven the \nfact that Claim 2 alleges . . . that the incommoding statute is vague under the second prong of the \nvagueness doctrine, the arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement prong, because the statute \nauthorizes and even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement and that is the very issue \nruled on in Agnew, a case filed on behalf of the same putative class.โ  Min. Order (Dec. 1, 2017).    \nAfter the parties briefed the issue, the Court issued a stay โ[g]iven the substantial overlap between \nthe factual allegations and the legal contentions in the instant complaint and the issues to be \nresolved in the appeal of the Agnew case.โ  Min. Order (Feb. 14, 2018).   \nOn April 5, 2019, the D.C. Circuit issued its decision in Agnew v. District of Columbia, \n920 F.3d 49 (D.C. Cir. 2019).  It affirmed the Courtโs ruling, finding that โit is readily apparent \nthat the terms โto crowd, obstruct, or incommodeโ the use of public ways mean to block or hinder \n                                                           \n1   On December 25, 2017, plaintiff voluntarily dismissed defendant Onoja from the case.  \nNotice [Dkt. # 11].   \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 7 of 28\nother peopleโs ability to pass through or use a common space,โ and that therefore, โthe anti-\nobstructing statute is not unconstitutionally vague on its face.โ  Id. at 56.   \nAfter  the  Court  of  Appeals  issued  its  ruling,  the  Court  ordered  the  parties  to  file \nsubmissions addressing the impact of the Agnew decision on this case.  Min. Order (Apr. 9, 2019).  \nPlaintiff notified the Court that the decision barred his facial challenge to the incommoding statute \nbased upon the arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement prong of the vagueness doctrine.  Notice \n[Dkt. # 18].  The Court ordered plaintiff to file an amended complaint eliminating those allegations.  \nMin. Order (May 16, 2019).    \nPlaintiffโs compliance with that directive was spotty.  He filed what he entitled an amended \ncomplaint, but the first three claims under 42 U.S.C. ยง1983 remained unchanged.  Compare \nCompl. ยถยถ 209โ27, with Am. Compl. ยถยถ 235โ54.  The fourth claim was amended to state a violation \nof the equal protection clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Am. Compl. ยถยถ 255โ57.   \nDefendant filed a motion to dismiss on August 23, 2019, arguing that plaintiff has failed to \nput forward sufficient facts to allege a constitutional violation or to give rise to municipal liability \nfor any constitutional violation under section 1983.  Def.โs Mem.   \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nโTo survive a [Rule 12(b)(6)] motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual \nmatter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.โ  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009), quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  In Iqbal, \nthe Supreme Court reiterated the two principles underlying its decision in Twombly:  โFirst, the \ntenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable \nto legal conclusions.โ  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  And โ[s]econd, only a complaint that states a \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 8 of 28\nplausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss.โ  Id. at 679, citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at \n556. \n  A claim is facially plausible when the pleaded factual content โallows the court to draw the \nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.โ  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at \n678.  โThe plausibility standard is not akin to a โprobability requirement,โ but it asks for more than \na sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.โ  Id.  A pleading must offer more than \nโlabels and conclusionsโ or a โformulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action,โ id., \nquoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, and โ[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, \nsupported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.โ  Id.   \n  In evaluating a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a court must โtreat the complaintโs \nfactual allegations as true and must grant plaintiff โthe benefit of all inferences that can be derived \nfrom the facts alleged.โโ  Sparrow v. United Air Lines, Inc., 216 F.3d 1111, 1113 (D.C. Cir. 2000) \n(internal citation omitted), quoting Schuler v. United States, 617 F.2d 605, 608 (D.C. Cir. 1979); \nsee also Am. Natโl Ins. Co. v. FDIC, 642 F.3d 1137, 1139 (D.C. Cir. 2011), quoting Thomas v. \nPrincipi, 394 F.3d 970, 972 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  Therefore, when considering a motion to dismiss, a \ncourt must construe a complaint liberally in the plaintiffโs favor.  Kowal v. MCI Commcโns Corp., \n16 F.3d 1271, 1276 (D.C. Cir. 1994).   \n  Nevertheless, the court need not accept inferences drawn by the plaintiff if those inferences \nare unsupported by facts alleged in the complaint, nor must the court accept plaintiffโs legal \nconclusions.  Id.; see also Browning v. Clinton, 292 F.3d 235, 242 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  In ruling upon \na motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a court may ordinarily consider only โthe facts \nalleged in the complaint, documents attached as exhibits or incorporated by reference in the \ncomplaint, and matters about which the Court may take judicial notice.โ  Gustave-Schmidt v. Chao, \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 9 of 28\n226 F. Supp. 2d 191, 196 (D.D.C. 2002), citing EEOC v. St. Francis Xavier Parochial Sch., 117 \nF.3d 621, 624โ25 (D.C. Cir. 1997). \nANALYSIS \nPlaintiff brings four claims alleging violations of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against the District of \nColumbia.  The statute creates a cause of action against โ[e]very person who, under color of any \nstatute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage . . . subjects . . . any citizen . . . to the deprivation \nof any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.โ  42 U.S.C. \nยง 1983; see Pitt v. District of Columbia, 491 F.3d 494, 510 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  The term โpersonโ \nin section 1983 includes municipalities, such as the District of Columbia, but a municipality cannot \nbe held liable under section 1983 โsolely because it employs a tortfeasorโin other words, a \nmunicipality cannot be held liable under ยง 1983 on a respondeat superior theory.โ  Monell v. Depโt \nof Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 691 (1978).  To maintain a section 1983 action against the District of \nColumbia, the Court must first โdetermine whether the complaint states a claim for a predicate \nconstitutional violation,โ and โthen the court must determine whether the complaint states a claim \nthat a custom or policy of the municipality caused the violation.โ  Baker v. District of Columbia, \n326 F.3d 1302, 1306 (D.C. Cir. 2003), citing City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 389 (1989). \nIn assessing the first prong, the Court addresses whether plaintiff has stated a claim for a \nconstitutional violation.  โIn order to establish this predicate violation, neither District of Columbia \npolicy makers nor employees need be implicated. All that is being established at this stage is that \nthere is some constitutional harm suffered by the plaintiff, not whether the municipality is liable \nfor that harm.โ  Baker, 326 F.3d at 1306โ07. \nUnder the second prong, the Court must go on to determine whether the โcomplaint states \na claim that a policy or custom of the District of Columbia caused the constitutional violation \nalleged under the first prong.โ  Id., citing Monell, 436 U.S. at 694.  โThe court must determine \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 10 of 28\nwhether the plaintiff has alleged an โaffirmative link,โ such that a municipal policy was the \nโmoving forceโ behind the constitutional violation.โ  Id. (internal citations omitted).   \nThere are several ways in which a plaintiff may successfully allege the existence of the \nnecessary municipal policy or custom:   \nSpecifically, []he may point to (1) โthe explicit setting of a policy by the \ngovernment that violates the Constitution,โ (2) โthe action of a policy maker \nwithin the government,โ (3) โthe adoption through a knowing failure to act \nby a policy maker of actions by his subordinates that are so consistent that \nthey have become โcustom,โโ or (4) โthe failure of the government to \nrespond to a need (for example, training of employees) in such a manner as \nto show โdeliberate indifferenceโ to the risk that not addressing the need will \nresult in constitutional violations.โ \n \nBlue v. District of Columbia, 811 F.3d 14, 18โ19 (D.C. Cir. 2015), quoting Baker, 326 F.3d at \n1306.  \nI.  The Court will not dismiss Claim 1 because the amended complaint sufficiently \nalleges a constitutional violation and that the District of Columbia was the cause of \nthat violation.   \nIn Claim 1, plaintiff alleges that Officer Onoja violated his Fourth Amendment rights \nbecause he was not blocking the sidewalk when he was apprehended, and that the District of \nColumbia is liable for the unlawful action because it has a policy and practice โof encouraging and \nacquiescingโ in its officersโ use of the statute to โclear the sidewalks of young African American \nmen by arresting them for incommoding without probable cause.โ  Am. Compl. ยถยถ 236, 237.  In \naddition, plaintiff alleges the District is liable for the unconstitutional arrest โbecause the District \nand its policymakers and the MPD knew or should have known that [Officer] Onoja had a history \nof making illegal arrests . . . and the District acquiesced in his conduct by failing to discipline \nhim.โ  Id. ยถ 238.   \nDefendant argues first that the claim should be dismissed because plaintiff has failed to \nallege sufficient facts to establish that Officer Onoja acted without probable cause, and so the \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 11 of 28\ncomplaint lacks the required constitutional violation.  Def.โs Mem. at 8โ9.  Defendant also argues \nthat has plaintiff has failed to identify a district policy that caused his arrest.  Id. at 10.   \nThe Court finds that plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that his constitutional rights were \nviolated.  To state a claim for false arrest under the Fourth Amendment, a plaintiff must allege that \nhe โwas arrested against his will and that the arrest was unlawful.โ  McCarthy v. Kleindienst, 741 \nF.2d 1406, 1413 (D.C. Cir. 1984).  An arrest is unlawful if it was conducted without probable \ncause, and โโ[g]enerally, probable cause exists where the facts and circumstances within the \narresting officerโs knowledge, of which he had reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient \nin  themselves  to  warrant  a  reasonable  belief  that  an  offense  has  been  or  is  being \ncommitted.โโ  Amobi v. D.C. Depโt of Corr., 755 F.3d 980, 990 (D.C. Cir. 2014), quoting Rucker \nv. United States, 455 A.2d 889, 891 (D.C. 1983).   \nHere, plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that the officer lacked probable cause when he made \nthe arrest.  He explicitly states that at the time he was apprehended, he was walking on the \nsidewalk, and not โcrowding,โ โincommoding,โ or โobstructingโ it.  Am. Compl. ยถยถ 40, 41.  He \nalso states that he was not blocking passage or posing any obstacle to pedestrian traffic.  Id. ยถ 37.  \nHe maintains that the sidewalk is wide enough for people to stop and talk with each other and still \nleave room for other people to walk by.  Id. ยถ 29.  Resolving all inferences in plaintiffโs favor, \nthese facts, taken together, are sufficient to give rise to a plausible claim of a constitutional \nviolation.   \nAccording to the District, plaintiff admitted he was violating the statute because he stated \nin the amended complaint that he was โstanding at the intersectionโ and the photographs in the \ncomplaint show that he was standing in the sidewalk, and thus, โOfficer Onoja could have \nreasonably determined that he was โcrowd[ing], obstruct[ing], or incommod[ing] . . . [a] sidewalk.โ  \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 12 of 28\nDef.โs Mem. at 9โ10.  But merely standing on a public sidewalk is not the same as crowding, \nobstructing, or incommoding.  See Agnew, 920 F.3d at 58 (โThe statute does not apply to minor \ninconveniences or merely subjective annoyance, but only to observed obstacles or blockages.โ).  \nIn addition, plaintiff alleges that when he was arrested, he was not standing on the sidewalk:  he \nwas walking on it, and that is not prohibited by the statute.  Am. Compl. ยถยถ 40โ41.  Thus, the claim \nwill not be dismissed for lack of an alleged predicate constitutional violation.   \nTo sue the District, though, plaintiff must also allege that a custom or policy of the \nmunicipality was the moving force behind the constitutional violation. This requires the plaintiff \nto plead โthe elements of the relevant type of municipal policyโ and โindicate[ ] the contoursโ of \nthe policy.  Blue, 811 F.3d at 20.  Plaintiff alleges three bases for municipal liability:  (1) โa \npolicymaker knowingly ignored a practice that was consistent enough to create a custom,โ (2) โthe \nDistrict failed to respond to a need . . . in such a manner as to show deliberate indifference to the \nrisk that not addressing the need will result in constitutional violationsโ; and (3) the District \nknowingly ignored Officer Onojaโs practice of arresting people without probable cause.  Pl.โs Opp. \nat 5โ7; see Am. Compl. ยถยถ 237โ38.   \nA plaintiff sufficiently pleads a section 1983 custom or policy claim when the complaint \nrefers to specific incidents that plausibly show a custom or pattern of behavior.  See Warren v. \nDistrict of Columbia, 353 F.3d 36, 40 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (finding that the allegation that a prison \nofficial โstuck the same needles in everybodyโs arms to draw bloodโ was sufficient to allege a \ncustom or policy of prisoner mistreatment); see also Singh v. District of Columbia, 881 F. Supp. \n2d 76, 87 (D.D.C. 2012) (where the plaintiff was issued three traffic tickets over the span of \neighteen days, and he reported the harassment on five separate occasions, he stated a claim for a \nsection 1983 custom or policy claim); Trimble v. District of Columbia, 779 F. Supp. 2d 54, 59 \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 13 of 28\n(D.D.C. 2011) (โ[M]erely speculating that an unidentified policy and uncorroborated practice or \ncustom exists without providing any factual heft to support the allegation is insufficient to state a \nclaim under section 1983.โ)  \nHere, the amended complaint โ if taken as true on its face โ contains sufficient information \nto give rise to a plausible inference that numerous similar false arrests under this statute have been \nbrought to the Districtโs attention, and that there is a custom or pattern of behavior that can be \nattributed to the District.  Thus, the complaint has sufficiently alleged municipal liability under the \nthird prong of the Baker test:  โthe adoption through a knowing failure to act by a policy maker of \nactions by his subordinates that are so consistent that they have become โcustom.โโ  Baker, 811 \nF.3d at 1306. \nPlaintiff alleges that a number of individuals have been falsely arrested pursuant to this \nstatute, including Bugg Bey, Agnew, Dennis, and Williamson.  Am. Compl. ยถยถ 128โ85.  But that \nis not the sole basis for his claim.  He also alleges that the District has long been aware of the \nissues associated with enforcing the statute.  The complaint states that in 2011, the D.C. Council \nrecognized that the incommoding statute was being invoked even when the personโs conduct โdid \nnot interfere with other pedestriansโ free passage on the sidewalk,โ Am. Compl. ยถ 87, and the D.C. \nCouncil held hearings on the issue.  Id. ยถ 88.  But, the District did not take any action to address \nthe issues at the time.  Id. ยถ 91.  The complaint also alleges that the District of Columbia Police \nComplaints Board (โPCBโ) issued a report on May 22, 2017, stating that fourteen complaints \nbetween the period of 2013 to 2017 alleged that officers had inappropriately issued โmove onโ \norders or arrested individuals under the incommoding statute.  Am. Compl. ยถยถ 186โ87.  The PCB \nallegedly reported that during the investigation of one complaint, a police officer testified that he \napproaches โpeople who are standing still on the sidewalk in order to warn them or cite them for \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 14 of 28\nblocking passage, . . . regardless of whether they are presenting an obstacle to pedestrian traffic.โ  \nId. ยถ 193.  Several of the complaints, plaintiff contends, โhave led to sustained allegations against \nMPD officersโ and there are โcomplaints currently under investigation.โ  Id. ยถ 188.   \nAssuming the truth of these allegations and drawing all inferences in favor of plaintiff, as \nthe Court is required to do at this stage, the Court finds that these actions support a plausible \ninference that the District of Columbia caused plaintiffโs unconstitutional arrest by adopting as \npolicy, through its inaction, a known customary practice of making questionable arrests under the \nincommoding provision.  Thus, plaintiff has stated a claim under section 1983 under the third \nBaker prong, and Claim 1 will move forward.   \nPlaintiff also alleges that the District is liable for his arrest under the fourth Baker prong:  \nthat the District failed to respond to a need, such as training, in such a manner as to show deliberate \nindifference to the risk that not addressing the need will result in constitutional violations.  Baker, \n326 F.3d at 1306.  He alleges that the District was aware that the statute was being enforced \nunconstitutionally, and it was aware that its officers needed additional training, but that it failed to \ntake any steps to improve the training program.  Am. Compl. ยถยถ 8, 78, 94, 96, 97โ99, 216โ17.  \nPlaintiff also alleges that the District failed to respond to Officer Onojaโs practice of arresting \npeople without probable cause.  Id. ยถยถ 219โ34.   \nThe Supreme Court has recognized that a municipalityโs failure to train its officers can \nform the basis of a section 1983 claim against it, but โonly where the failure to train amounts to \ndeliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the police come into contact.โ  City of \nCanton, 489 U.S. at 388.  In some circumstances, โthe need for more or different training is so \nobvious, and the inadequacy so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights, that the \npolicymakers of the city can reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.โ  \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 15 of 28\nId. at 390.  Thus, a municipality may be deemed deliberately indifferent when โcity policymakers \nare on actual or constructive notice that a particular omission in their training program causes city \nemployees to violate citizensโ constitutional rights, . . . [and] policymakers choose to retain that \nprogram.โ  Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. 51, 61 (2011), citing Bd. of Cty. Commโrs v. Brown, \n520 U.S. 397, 407 (1997); see Baker, 326 F.3d at 1307 (โDeliberate indifference is determined by \nanalyzing whether the municipality knew or should have known of the risk of constitutional \nviolations, an objective standard.โ).  A municipality can likewise be liable for inadequately \nsupervising  its  employees  if  it  was  deliberately  indifferent  to  an  obvious  need  for  greater \nsupervision.  See, e.g., Colbert v. District of Columbia, 5 F. Supp. 3d 44, 60 (D.D.C. 2013). \nBut โ[d]eliberate indifference is a stringent standard of fault . . . .โ  Connick, 563 U.S. at \n61, quoting Brown, 520 U.S. at 410 (internal quotation marks omitted).  โA pattern of similar \nconstitutional  violations  by  untrained  employees  is  โordinarily  necessaryโ  to  demonstrate \ndeliberate indifference for purposes of failure to train.โ  Id. at 62, quoting Brown, 520 U.S. at 409.  \nIn other words, the determination is necessarily fact based.  \nHere, there is significant overlap in the allegations supporting municipal liability under the \nthird and fourth Baker prongs.  As stated above, plaintiff points to a number of circumstances in \nwhich individuals were either falsely arrested or improperly threatened with arrest under the \nincommoding statute by various MPD officers.  Am. Compl. ยถยถ 138, 153, 167, 185 (detailing \nincidents in which Officers Norris, Onoja, and Amos conducted false arrests); id. ยถยถ 79โ85 (where \na journalist attempted to record an encounter between a homeless man and the police, Officers \nReynolds and Akhtar ordered the journalist to leave the area and improperly threatened to arrest \nhim for incommoding).  He also details events that later became the subject of police complaints, \nin which officers were found to be using the statute improperly.  Id. ยถยถ 192, 195 (alleging that the \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 16 of 28\nOffice of Police Complaints investigated two complaints and found that the โofficer[s] improperly \nharassed the complainantโ).  Finally, plaintiff alleges that at least two police officers are known to \nmisuse the statute.  Id. ยถ 148 (โOfficer Norris is known to have arrested several other young African \nAmerican men in the area for incommoding who were not incommoding or blocking the way.โ); \nid. ยถ 219 (โDefendant Onoja is an open and notorious violator of civil rights of the people in the \nDistrict of Columbia whom he polices.โ).  \nFurthermore, plaintiff alleges that the District knew that officers were misusing the law \nand that there were likely deficiencies in its training program on the law for police officers, but it \ndid not take any action.  For example, after the report from the CCE came out in 2011 and the D.C. \nCouncil held hearings about possibly amending the law, the Council heard testimony detailing \nincidents in which police officers issued โmove alongโ orders to individuals who were not \nincommoding or blocking passage, thereby showing that the District was aware of the need to \nfurther train officers on when the law could be invoked.  Id. ยถ 75.  Plaintiff also alleges that because \nvarious groups had recommended changing the text of the law, the District was on notice that the \nโstatute had the potential to be abused, and that its administration should be carefully monitored \nand officers needed training and constant reinforcement training.โ  Id. ยถ 78.  Furthermore, in 2012, \nthe D.C. Council held hearings on the improper use of this statute, and one of the councilmembers \nโsuggested that training may be . . . important,โ and that โan intensive refresher training may be \nneededโ even though some online trainings had already been instituted.  Id. ยถยถ 95โ100.  After this \nhearing, the District did not โprovide updated training or written directives,โ nor did it โprovide \nroll call training or other training on how the statute applies when no other people are around.โ  Id. \nยถยถ 216โ17.    \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 17 of 28\nWhile the allegations in the complaint are somewhat conclusory, and they will need to be \nproven in the next stage of litigation, it would be inappropriate for the Court to cut off the inquiry \nbefore it begins.  The allegations taken together state a claim for a pattern of similar constitutional \nviolations such that the city was deliberately indifferent to a need, in particular, a deficiency in its \ntraining program.  In light of that, and given the Courtโs finding that Claim 1 was going forward \nanyway, and the fact that discovery on the two theories will be largely the same, the Court finds \nthat the claim for municipal liability under Bakerโs fourth prong should go forward as well.    \nII.  The Claim 2 challenge to the statute under the discriminatory enforcement prong of \nthe void for vagueness doctrine must be dismissed in accordance with the D.C. \nCircuitโs binding opinion in Agnew. \nIn Claim 2, plaintiff alleges that the incommoding statute is unconstitutional because it \nauthorizes and encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  Am. Compl. ยถ 242.  This \ntype of challenge invokes the โvoid-for-vaguenessโ doctrine, which arises under the right to due \nprocess guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.  United States v. Bronstein, 849 F.3d 1101, 1106 \n(D.C. Cir. 2017).   \nThe Due Process Clause protects individuals from laws that are so vague \nthat they cannot be understood with reasonable consistencyโwhether by \nthe people who must obey the law or the officials charged with applying it.  \nA law may be unconstitutionally vague either because it โfail[s] to provide \nthe kind of notice that will enable ordinary people to understand what \nconduct it prohibits,โ or because it โauthorize[s] and even encourage[s] \narbitrary and discriminatory enforcement,โ or both. \n \nAgnew, 920 F.3d at 55, quoting City of Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 56 (1999).   \nIn Agnew, the plaintiff challenged the provision at issue here under the second prong of the \ndoctrine.  The Court of Appeals held that the incommoding statute was not unconstitutionally \nvague on its face โ[b]ecause it is readily apparent that the terms โto crowd, obstruct, or incommodeโ \nthe use of public ways mean to block or hinder other peopleโs ability to pass through or use a \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 18 of 28\ncommon space.โ  Id. at 56.  The Court found that the text of the statute clearly did โnot punish \nconduct that has no effect on other members of the public; it is violated only by actual or imminent \nobstruction of another person[,]โ and that if the statute is โread with a dose of common sense, [it] \nconfirms that a violation occurs only when a person effectively appropriates more than his fair \nshare of a public area or walk, in conflict with the prerogatives of other people also seeking to use \nthat space.โ  Id. at 58.  While the Court recognized that โ[t]he facts of the plaintiffsโ arrests as they \nallege them are troubling,โ the plaintiffs had not brought a claim of racially discriminatory \nprosecution, and โidentified instances of a statuteโs misapplication do not tell us whether the law \nis unconstitutional in every application.โ  Id. at 60.   \nThe Agnew case expressly challenged the statute on its face.  Id. at 51.  But here, plaintiff \nAlexander, represented by the same lawyer, has characterized his claim in Claim 2 as an โas-\nappliedโ  challenge.    Am.  Compl.  ยถ  242.    A  facial  challenge  seeks  a  ruling  that  a  law  is \nunconstitutional in all of its applications.  United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987) (โA \nfacial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, \nsince the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would \nbe valid.โ).  โAn ordinary as-applied challenge, by contrast, asks a court to assess a statuteโs \nconstitutionality with respect to the particular set of facts before it.โ  Hodge v. Talkin, 799 F.3d \n1145, 1156 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  The distinction between the two challenges โgoes to the breadth of \nthe remedy employed by the Court.โ  Citizens United v. Fed. Election Commโn, 558 U.S. 310, 331 \n(2010).   \nIt is important to note, though, that โ[t]he substantive rule of law is the same for both \nchallenges.โ  Edwards v. District of Columbia, 755 F.3d 996, 1001 (D.C. Cir. 2014), citing Legal \nAid Servs. of Or. v. Legal Servs. Corp., 608 F.3d 1084, 1096 (9th Cir. 2010).  While rejection of a \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 19 of 28\nfacial challenge does not โnecessarily preclude the possibility of a successful as-applied challenge \n. . . โa plaintiff cannot successfully bring an as-applied challenge to a statutory provision based on \nthe same factual and legal arguments the . . . Court expressly considered when rejecting a facial \nchallenge to that provision.  Doing so is not so much an as-applied challenge as it is an argument \nfor overruling a precedent.โโ  Republican Party of Louisiana v. Fed. Election Commโn, 219 F. \nSupp. 3d 86, 95โ96 (D.D.C. 2016), affโd sub nom. Republican Party of Louisiana v. Fed. Election \nCommโn, 137 S. Ct. 2178 (2017), quoting Republican Natโl Comm. v. Fed. Election Commโn, 698 \nF. Supp. 2d 150, 157 (D.D.C. 2010), affโd, 561 U.S. 1040 (2010). \nHere, plaintiff has failed to amend his complaint so that it would do anything other than \nrecapitulate the Agnew allegations. He alleges that the statuteโs vagueness โauthorizes and even \nencourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement,โ see, e.g., Am. Compl. ยถยถ 242โ43, and he \nargues in opposition to the motion to dismiss that the law is unconstitutional โas-applied to people \nlike [him]โ because โit leaves speculative the tests for ascertaining the line separating guilty from \ninnocent acts.โ  Pl.โs Opp. at 36, quoting Ricks v. District of Columbia, 414 F.2d 1097, 1101 (D.C. \nCir. 1968).  This is exactly why the plaintiffs in Agnew claimed the provision was unconstitutional \non its face.  920 F.3d at 51.  The Court in Agnew firmly rejected that argument, finding that \nmeaning of the statute was apparent from its text.  Id. at 56.   \nPlaintiff also argues that the statute is unlawfully applied to โAfrican Americans as though \nit were a loitering statute.โ  Pl.โs Opp. at 36.  But in Agnew, the plaintiffs similarly argued that the \nlaw was being enforced in a racially discriminatory and harassing manner, and the Court pointed \nout that this was not relevant to a vagueness challenge.  920 F.3d at 60 (noting that plaintiffs had \nnot brought a claim for discriminatory prosecution), citing United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. \n456, 463โ66 (1996).   \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 20 of 28\nSince Claim 2 is based upon the same factual and legal arguments that were made in \nAgnew, it is precluded by Agnew, and the Court will grant defendantโs motion to dismiss the claim.       \nIII.  The Claim 3 due process challenge to the statute on the grounds that it is too vague to \nput the public on notice must also be dismissed in light of Agnew. \nPlaintiff also alleges that the statute is unduly vague under the first prong of the void-for-\nvagueness doctrine because it does not give โfair noticeโ of the prohibited conduct.  Am. Compl. \nยถ 249.  Claim 3 asserts both a facial and an as-applied challenge on this basis.  Id. ยถ 249.  Defendant \nargues that the facial challenge must be dismissed because plaintiff lacks standing to bring it.  \nDef.โs Mem. at 21โ23.  It also argues that plaintiff has failed to state a claim for a Fifth Amendment \nviolation: it submits that he has not alleged sufficient facts to show that the constitutional infirmity \ncaused his arrest, and that the Agnew decision precludes this claim as well.  Id. at 21โ26.   \nA.  Standing \nโTo state a case or controversy under Article III, a plaintiff must establish standing.โ  Ariz. \nChristian Sch. Tuition Org. v. Winn, 563 U.S. 125, 133 (2011); accord Lujan v. Defenders of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992) (holding that โstanding is an essential and unchanging part of \nthe case-or-controversy requirement of Article IIIโ).  Standing is a โnecessary โpredicate to any \nexerciseโโ of federal jurisdiction; if it is lacking, the dispute is not a proper case or controversy \nunder Article III, and federal courts have no subject matter jurisdiction to decide the case.  \nDominguez v. UAL Corp., 666 F.3d 1359, 1361 (D.C. Cir. 2012), quoting Fla. Audubon Socโy v. \nBentsen, 94 F.3d 658, 663 (D.C. Cir. 1996). \nTo establish constitutional standing, plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) that he has suffered a \nconcrete,  particularized,  and  actual  or  imminent  โinjury  in  factโ;  (2)  that  the  injury  is \nโfairly . . . trace[able]โ to the challenged action of the defendant; and (3) that it is โlikely, as \nopposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.โ  Lujan, \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 21 of 28\n504 U.S. at 560โ61, quoting Simon v.

Id. at 561.  โ[A] plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each \nform of relief sought.โ  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. \n167, 185 (2000), citing City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 109 (1983) (notwithstanding \nthe fact that plaintiff had standing to pursue damages, he lacked standing to pursue injunctive \nrelief); see also Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 358, n. 6 (1996) (โ[S]tanding is not dispensed in \ngross.โ). \nWhere a plaintiff โseeks prospective declaratory and injunctive relief, he must establish an \nongoing or future injury that is โcertainly impendingโ; he may not rest on past injury.โ  Arpaio v. \nObama, 797 F.3d 11, 19 (D.C. Cir. 2015), quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Intโl USA, 568 U.S. 398, \n401  (2013).    Defendant  argues  that  because  plaintiffโs  facial  challenge  seeks  โprospective \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief,โ including a declaratory judgment that the incommoding statute \nis unconstitutional and an injunction prohibiting its enforcement, plaintiff โmust establish ongoing \nor future injury that is โcertainly impendingโ and cannot rest on past injuries.โ  Def.โs Mem. at 22, \nquoting Williams v. Lew, 819 F.3d 466, 472 (D.C. Cir. 2016).   \nBut plaintiff does allege a current and ongoing injury.  In his complaint, he states that he is \nseeking an injunction โin the form of sealing . . . arrest records for incommodingโ and a declaration \nthat โthe arrests [are] a nullity.โ  Am. Compl. at 47โ48; see Pl.โs Opp. at 38 (arguing that he has \nstanding to seek expungement of his arrest record).  Plaintiffโs ongoing injury, therefore, is his \ncurrent arrest record.  The D.C. Circuit has recognized that the consequences of a criminal record \nis a cognizable legal injury, see Menard v. Saxbe, 498 F.2d 1017, 1023 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (โAlthough \n[plaintiff] cannot point with mathematical certainty to the exact consequences of his criminal file, \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 22 of 28\nwe think it clear that he has alleged a โcognizable legal injury.โโ), and that the sealing of an arrest \nrecord is an โappropriate remedy in the wake of police action in violation of constitutional rights.โ  \nSullivan v. Murphy, 478 F.2d 938, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (โThe principle is well established that a \ncourt may order the expungement of records, including arrest records, when that remedy is \nnecessary and appropriate in order to preserve basic legal rights.โ).  Furthermore, the Court of \nAppeals has held โthat unlawful maintenance of records of arrest results in โinjuries and dangersโ \nthat are โplain enoughโ and that โthis threat is not dissipated, or rendered insubstantial or illusory, \nby the fact that the arrest was not followed by a prosecution.โโ   Menard, 498 F.2d at 1023, quoting \nSullivan, 478 F.2d at 962.   \nThus, plaintiff has standing to challenge the law on its face, and the Court may go on to \naddress the merits of the claim.   \nB.  Failure to State a Claim  \n โThe void-for-vagueness doctrine, as [the Supreme Court] ha[s] called it, guarantees that \nordinary people have โfair noticeโโ of the conduct a statute proscribes.  Sessions v. Dimaya, 138 S. \nCt. 1204, 1212 (2018), quoting Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 162 (1972).  To \nprovide โfair notice,โ โ[g]enerally, a legislature need do nothing more than enact and publish the \nlaw, and afford the citizenry a reasonable opportunity to familiarize itself with its terms and to \ncomply.โ  Texaco, Inc. v. Short, 454 U.S. 516, 532 (1982).   \nThe D.C. Circuit has elaborated further on what โfair noticeโ entails: \n[A] statutory term is not rendered unconstitutionally vague because it do[es] \nnot mean the same thing to all people, all the time, everywhere.  When \ninterpreting a statutory term, we are not concerned with vagueness in the \nsense that the term requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise \nbut  comprehensible  normative  standard,  whose  satisfaction  may  vary \ndepending upon whom you ask.  Rather, a statute is unconstitutionally \nvague  if,  applying  the  rules  for  interpreting  legal  texts,  its  meaning \nspecifie[s] no standard of conduct . . . at all. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 23 of 28\n \nBronstein, 849 F.3d at 1107โ08 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).   \nPlaintiff alleges that โ[t]he ordinance is not clear and it does not provide fair notice as to \nwhat conduct is deemed likely to cause a crowding, obstructing, or incommoding problem.โ  Am. \nCompl. ยถ 250.  He also contends that it also does not โplace reasonable individuals on notice as to \nwhether they must merely โcease crowding, obstructing, or incommodingโ or whether they must \nleave the area, and if so, how far must they go, and how long must they stay.โ  Id. ยถ 251.   \nWhile the plaintiffs in the Agnew case did not bring a โlack of fair noticeโ void-for-\nvagueness claim, the D.C. Circuitโs opinion dispensed with the arguments that plaintiff makes \nhere.  The Court examined the use of the word โincommodeโ together with โcrowdโ and โobstructโ \nand found that โthe three words read together in context are plainly concerned with impediment or \nhindrance.โ  920 F.3d at 57.  It found that โthe statute is not impermissibly vague just because the \nterm incommode โmay not roll off the average personโs tongue today,โ and does โnot mean the \nsame thing to all people, all the time.โโ  Id. at 57, citing Bronstein, 849 F.3d at 1107โ08, and \nquoting Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 491 (1957).  It went on to state that โ[t]he statutory \ntext, read with a dose of common sense, confirms that a violation occurs only when a person \neffectively appropriates more than his fair share of a public area or walk, in conflict with the \nprerogatives of other people also seeking to use that space, id. at 58, and the law โdoes not apply \nto  minor  inconveniences  or  merely  subjective  annoyance,  but  only  observed  obstacles  or \nblockages.โ  Id.  Finally, the Court also held that โโhow farโ and โhow longโ are self-defining under \nthe statute:  Individuals need not vacate the public space altogether, they must simply stop blocking \nthe use of the way or place at issue.  Because the statute vests no banishment power in police, it \ncan suffer no defect on that account.โ  Id. at 60.   \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 24 of 28\nIn other words, this Court is bound by Circuit precedent to find that the statute is not \nimpermissibly vague as to the kind of conduct it prohibits, and it places individuals on notice as to \nhow to cease violating the law.  Thus, Claim 3 will be dismissed.   \nIV.  The Court will not dismiss Claim 4 because the amended complaint sufficiently \nalleges a constitutional violation and that the District of Columbia was the cause of \nthat violation.  \n \nIn Claim 4, plaintiff asserts a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, alleging that the \nDistrict is liable โfor intentionally enforcing the statute in a racially discriminatory manner by \nmaking arrests and issuing citations under the statute and issuing move on orders under the statute \nvirtually exclusively against African Americans.โ  Am. Compl. ยถ 256.   \nThe Equal Protection Clause, which applies to the District of Columbia via the Fifth \nAmendment, see Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 (1954) (applying Fourteenth Amendmentโs \nEqual Protection Clause to D.C. through Fifth Amendmentโs Due Process Clause); see also Dixon \nv. District of Columbia, 666 F.3d 1337, 1339 (D.C. Cir. 2011), requires state actors to treat \nsimilarly situated persons alike.  See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, \n439 (1985).  The clause protects against intentional and arbitrary discrimination, โwhether by \nexpress terms of a statute or by its improper execution through duly constituted agents.โ  Sunday \nLake Iron Co. v. Twp. of Wakefield, 247 U.S. 350, 352 (1918).   \nTo  succeed  on  an  equal  protection  claim,  plaintiff  must  show  that  โ[he]  has  been \nintentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for \nthe difference in treatment.โ  Vill. of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 564 (2000) (citations \nomitted). The Supreme Court has โmade clear that proof of [ ] discriminatory intent or purpose is \nrequired to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.โ  City of Cuyahoga Falls v. Buckeye \nCmty. Hope Found., 538 U.S. 188, 194 (2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 25 of 28\nSnowden v. Hughes, 321 U.S. 1, 8 (1944) (โThe unlawful administration by [government] officers \nof a [law] fair on its face, resulting in its unequal application to those who are entitled to be treated \nalike, is . . . a denial of equal protection [only if] there is shown to be present in it an element of \nintentional or purposeful discrimination.โ). \nApplying those precedents, defendant argues that the claim must be dismissed because \nplaintiff โdoes not allege facts showing he was treated differently, or that those who are treated \ndifferently, if any exist, are similarly-situated to him.โ  Def.โs Mem. at 28.  At this stage, the Court \nmust treat all the allegations in the complaint as true and draw all inferences in favor of the plaintiff.  \nSparrow, 216 F.3d at 1113.  And, taken together, plaintiffโs allegations support a plausible \ninference that as an African American man, Am. Compl. ยถ 48, plaintiff was treated differently than \nindividuals of other races using the Districtโs sidewalks in a similar manner.  See, e.g., id. ยถยถ 22, \n47, 104.  He alleges that Caucasian or Asian individuals engage in the same conduct, but no \nCaucasian or Asian individuals get arrested for it.  Id. ยถยถ 23, 198.  For example, the complaint \nincludes a photograph of mostly Caucasian individuals waiting in a long line on the narrow \nsidewalks circling a renowned bakery in Georgetown.  According to plaintiff, no one is arrested \nfor standing outside of this Caucasian-owned store.  Id. ยถ 198.   \nPlaintiff alleges that โ[a]fter years of investigation, the only Caucasian person the MPD \nhas issued a move on order to under the incommoding statute was the photojournalist who tried to \nrecord an MPD interaction with a homeless man.โ  Am. Compl. ยถ 197.  And, the PCB report issued \nin May of 2017 detailed fourteen complaints received between 2013 and 2017 regarding improper \nuse of the incommoding statute.  Id. ยถยถ 186โ87.  In particular, the organization โnoticed that a \nmajority of the individuals who filed a complaint with the agency belong[ed] to a specific racial \ngroup (African Americans),โ id. ยถ 189, and that it was โconcerned that MPD officers use of \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 26 of 28\nthe . . . statute  is  disproportionately  discriminating  against  these  specific  groups  of  people.โ  \nId. ยถ 190.   \nPlaintiff also alleges that African Americans are intentionally targeted by the Metropolitan \npolice.  Am. Compl. ยถยถ 104, 105, 110.  He claims that an MPD detective has acknowledged the \nheavy police presence in a predominantly black neighborhood, and the fact that the officers do not \nโdiscriminate between the bad and the good people.โ  Id. ยถยถ 108โ12.  Plaintiff alleges that the \ndetective stated that he believes that โundesirables congregateโ in this neighborhood, and that the \npolice โtake a zero[-]tolerance approach to quality of life crimes because they depress property \nvalues.โ  Id. ยถยถ 110โ11.  Plaintiff alleges that the MPD uses the incommoding statute to clear the \nstreets โof the traditionally African American residents.โ  Id. ยถ 105.   \nThese  factual  allegations,  taken  together,  state  a  claim  for  a  violation  of  the  Equal \nProtection Clause that is plausible on its face.   See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678; see Grissom v. District \nof Columbia, 853 F. Supp. 2d 118, 126 (D.D.C. 2012); Cf. Atherton v. District of Columbia Office \nof Mayor, 567 F.3d 672, 688 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (dismissing equal protection claim based on race \ndiscrimination in jury service when a juror was excused because he had alleged only that he was \nhalf Mexican and that he had openly thanked a witness in Spanish).   \nThe Court must now consider whether plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that the District of \nColumbia was the โmoving forceโ behind the constitutional violation.  See Baker, 326 F.3d at \n1306.  Defendant argues that plaintiffโs allegations regarding the existence of a policy, Am. Compl. \nยถยถ 2, 20, 45, 194, 198, fall short because they are conclusory, and in any event, โplaintiff also fails \nto tie any policy or custom to his arrest such that it was the moving force.โ  Def.โs Mem. at 28. \nPlaintiff states that he relies on two theories for municipal liability:  (1) โa policymaker \nknowingly ignored a practice that was consistent enough to create a custom,โ and/or (2) โthe \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 27 of 28\nDistrict failed to respond to a need . . . in such a manner as to show deliberate indifference to the \nrisk that not addressing the need will result in constitutional violations.โ  Pl.โs Opp. at 5 (citation \nomitted).   \nThe report issued in May of 2017 by the PCB supports plaintiffโs claim for municipal \nliability.  See Am. Compl. ยถ 186.  As detailed above, the report conveyed the PCBโs concern that \nthe statute was being disproportionately used on African Americans.  Id. ยถ 189.  Plaintiff further \nalleges that the District has not intervened in response to the problem, and it has not undertaken \nan analysis of the arrest narratives or provided updated training or written directives.  Id. ยถยถ 214โ\n17.  These allegations are sufficient to support a claim for municipal liability.   See, e.g., Byrd v. \nDist. of Columbia, 297 F. Supp. 2d 136, 139 (D.D.C. 2003) (stating deliberate indifference is \nโdetermined objectively, by analyzing whether the municipality knew or should have known of \nthe risk of . . . violations, and yet failed to respond as necessaryโ) (citations omitted)  \nAnd,  plaintiff  has  alleged  multiple  instances  where  African  Americans  were \ninappropriately  arrested  under  the  statute,  and  he  alleges  that  African  Americans  are \ndisproportionately arrested under this statute, Am. Compl. ยถ 197, even though there are Caucasian \nand Asian individuals who engage in similar conduct.  See id. ยถ 198.  These allegations, taken \ntogether, are sufficient to show a pattern of behavior that is consistent enough to become a custom.  \nSee M.J. v. District of Columbia, 401 F. Supp. 3d 1, 15 (D.D.C. 2019) (finding that plaintiffs have \nstated a section 1983 municipal liability claim where the complaint identified numerous occasions \nof constitutional violations).   \nAccordingly, plaintiff has stated a claim for municipal liability under section 1983, and the \nCourt will deny defendantโs motion to dismiss on this issue. The Court cautions, though, that \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 35   Filed 07/01/20   Page 28 of 28\nplaintiff has a long way to go to prove these claims, and that he will need to back up his largely \nconclusory allegations with facts to survive a motion for summary judgment at a later date. \nCONCLUSION \n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant defendantโs motion to dismiss in part and \ndismiss Claims 2 and 3, and it will deny it in part with respect to Claims 1 and 4.   \n  A separate order will issue.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAMY BERMAN JACKSON \nUnited States District Judge \n \nDATE:  July 1, 2020 \n28 \n ",

Named plaintiff and Class Representative Joseph Alexander and defendant District \nof Columbia entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release on December 9, 2022 (โSettlementโ \nor โSettlement Agreementโ) [Dkt # 62-2], which, together with the exhibits attached thereto, sets \nforth the terms and conditions for a proposed global resolution of this litigation and for its dismissal \nwith prejudice. \n2.  The  parties  have  moved  the  Court  for  an  order  preliminarily  approving  the \nSettlement under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, certifying a Class for purposes of settlement, \nand approving notice to the Class as described below.  The Court is familiar with and has reviewed \nthe record, the Settlement Agreement and its exhibits, the Memorandum in Support of the Joint \nMotion  for  an  Order  Granting  Preliminary  Approval  of  Class  Action  Settlement,  and  the \nsupporting affidavit, and it finds that there is good cause to enter this Order.1 \n \n \n1   Unless otherwise specified, all capitalized terms used herein have the same meanings \nascribed to them in the Settlement Agreement. \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 64   Filed 12/23/22   Page 2 of 11\nSchedule of Settlement-Related Events \n3.  Based on the findings in this Order and the proposal by the parties, the Court enters \nthe following schedule:  \nEvent  Date \nDefendant  shall  provide  the  Settlement  Agreement  January 9, 2023 \nDatabase to Class Counsel and Class Administrator \nDefendant  shall  wire  $25,000.00  to  the  Class  January 23, 2023 \nAdministrator  \nClass Administrator to establish website and mail  February 6, 2023 \nNotice and Claim and Release Forms \nPlaintiff must file his motion for final approval of the  February 21, 2023  \nSettlement and any motions for attorneysโ fees and \nexpenses and for incentive awards for the Named \nPlaintiff.  The motion must include updated \ninformation specifying the number of class members. \nDeadline for Class Members to submit any objections  April 12, 2023 \nto the proposed Settlement in accordance with this \norder \nDeadline for Class Members to opt out of the Class  March 8, 2023 \nDeadline for any opposition or response to objections,  April 27, 2023 \nincluding objections to award of attorneysโ fees and \ncosts \nFinal Approval and Fairness Hearing  May 12, 2023 \nFinal date for submission of claims  June 6, 2023 \n \nSettlement Class Certification \n4.  The Court finds, upon preliminary evaluation and for purposes of the Settlement \nonly, that it will likely be able to certify the following Class pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23: \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 64   Filed 12/23/22   Page 3 of 11\nIndividuals who (i) were arrested solely for incommoding under D.C. Code ยง 22-1307; \n(ii) on or after September 18, 2014; and (iii) either were released without charges being \nfiled or had any charges dismissed nolle prosequi. \n5.  The  Court  preliminarily  finds,  for  purposes  of  the  Settlement  only,  that  the \nrequirements of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(3) are likely to be satisfied for the \nClass.  In support of this conclusion, the Court provisionally finds as follows: \na.  The number of Class Members is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable.  The parties have agreed to this preliminary finding and according to the complaint \nin this case, the number of persons who were arrested, prosecuted, or who โposted and forfeitedโ \nfor incommoding each year through 2016 is at least 50.    \nb.  Questions of law and fact common to the Class predominate over individualized \nquestions.  The common questions include (i)  whether the Districtโs alleged false arrests violate \nthe Fourth Amendment, and (ii)  whether the Districtโs enforcement of the incommoding statute \nviolated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment.   \nc.  The Class Representativeโs claims are typical of the claims of the Class.  Each of \nthe claims arises from the enforcement of D.C. Code ยง 22-1307 and asserts the same theories of \nliability. \nd.  The proposed Class Representative, Joseph Alexander, will fairly and adequately \nrepresent the rights and interests of the Class.  Accordingly, the Court hereby appoints him to serve \nas Class Representative.  Additionally, the Court hereby appoints William Claiborne as Class \nCounsel.  Mr. Claiborne has significant experiencing litigating federal civil rights class actions \nagainst the federal government and has committed the necessary resources to represent the Class.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 64   Filed 12/23/22   Page 4 of 11\nThe Court accordingly appoints Mr. Claiborne as Class Counsel under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(g). \nPreliminary Approval of the Settlement \n6.  The Settlement is the product of non-collusive armโs-length negotiations, including \nmediation, among experienced counsel who were thoroughly informed of the strengths and \nweaknesses of the Action, including through informal discovery, motion practice, and a contested \nappeal.    The  Settlement  confers  substantial  benefits  upon  the  Class  and  avoids  the  costs, \nuncertainty, delays, and other risks associated with continued litigation, trial, and/or appeal.  The \nSettlement falls within the range of possible recovery for the Class, compares favorably with the \npotential recovery as balanced against the risks of continued litigation, does not grant preferential \ntreatment to Named Plaintiff or his counsel, and has no obvious deficiencies. \n7.  The Court hereby preliminarily approves the Settlement, as memorialized in the \nSettlement Agreement and its Exhibits, as fair, reasonable, and adequate, and in the best interest \nof Named Plaintiff and Class Members, subject to further consideration at the Fairness Hearing to \nbe conducted as described below.  \n8.  All funds should be deposited and released in accordance with the timing and \nschedule detailed in the Settlement Agreement.  \nManner and Form of Notice \n9.  The Court approves, as to form and content, the Notice and the Claim Form,2 \nattached to the Settlement Agreement as Exhibits A and B to Attachment 1 [Dkt. # 62-2], and it \nfinds that the Notice Plan set forth in the Settlement Agreement as Attachment 1 [Dkt. # 62-2] \n \n2  The parties must revise the Notice, Exhibit A to Attachment 1 [Dkt. # 62-2], to state that a \nclass member may enter an appearance through an attorney if the member so desires as required \nby Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(2)(B)(iv).      \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 64   Filed 12/23/22   Page 5 of 11\nmeets the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, due process, and all other applicable \nlaw and rules; constitutes the best notice practicable under the circumstances; and will provide due \nand sufficient notice to all individuals entitled thereto.  The Notice Plan provides for direct notice \nvia First Class mail to all Class Members and reasonable efforts to determine the current address \nof Class Members who fail to respond to initial notice or whose initial notice by First Class mail \nis returned to sender by the United States Postal Service.  The plan also provides for a Settlement \nWebsite containing information regarding the Settlement, links to the Notice and other relevant \ncase documents, and online submission of Claim Forms.  This plan and the Notice are reasonably \ncalculated under the circumstances to apprise Class Members of the pendency and nature of the \nAction, the definition of the class certified, the effect of the proposed Settlement, and the Class \nMembersโ rights to participate in, opt out of, or object to any aspect of the proposed Settlement.   \nThe date and time of the Fairness Hearing shall be included in the Notice before its dissemination \nand posting. \n10.  The Court hereby appoints JND Legal Administration (JND) to serve as the Claims \nAdministrator, as defined in the Settlement Agreement, to supervise and administer the notice \nprocedures, establish and operate a settlement website (the โWebsiteโ) and a toll-free number, \nadminister the claims processes, distribute cash payments according to the processes and criteria \nset forth in the Settlement Agreement, and perform any other duties of the Claims Administrator \nthat are reasonably necessary and/or provided for in the Settlement Agreement. \n11.  Implementation costs incurred in identifying and notifying Class Members, and in \nadministering the Settlement Fund, shall be paid as set forth in the Settlement Agreement.  \nDefendant will take the measures required, including paying the $25,000 set forth in the Settlement \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 64   Filed 12/23/22   Page 6 of 11\nAgreement at 5, to ensure that an amount sufficient to fund the Notice campaign, is disbursed to \nthe Claims Administrator by January 23, 2023.   \n12.  As  soon  as  practicable,  and  no  later  than  February  6,  2023,  the  Claims \nAdministrator must establish the Website and post the Notice and Claim Form thereon. \n13.  No later than February 6, 2023, the Claims Administrator shall (i) mail the Notice, \nsubstantially in the form annexed to the Settlement Agreement, in accordance with the Settlement \nNotice Plan and (ii) cause publication of the Notice to occur, as detailed in the Joint Motion for \nPreliminary Approval of Class Action Settlement, and the Notice campaign will continue for \nseveral weeks thereafter. \n14.  Class Members who wish to make a claim to recover out of the Settlement Fund \nmust complete and submit a Claim Form no later than June 6, 2023, in accordance with the \ninstructions  contained  on  the  Claim  Form.

The Court intends to consider the petition for an award of attorneysโ fees, expenses, \nand costs and for incentive awards at the Fairness Hearing, but it may determine at or in advance \nof the hearing that the application is to be considered separately from the fairness, reasonableness, \nand adequacy of the remainder of the Settlement.  If it does so, any appeal from an order relating \nsolely to the petition for an award of attorneysโ fees, costs, and expenses, and/or for incentive \nawards, or any reversal or modification of any such order, shall not operate to terminate or cancel \nthe Settlement or to affect or delay the judgment finally approving the Settlement.   \n18.

No person will be \nentitled to contest the approval of the Settlement, the entry of a final judgment dismissing the \naction and releasing Class Member claims, or the petition for an award of attorneysโ fees, costs, \nand expenses and for incentive awards, unless they have submitted an objection by April 12, 2023 \n(the โObjection Deadlineโ).   Any objections must be submitted to the Claims Administrator, class \ncounsel, and defense counsel, in writing, by mail, and postmarked by the Objection Deadline, or \nthey will not be considered.

By objecting, or otherwise \nrequesting to be heard at the Fairness Hearing, a person shall be deemed to have submitted to the \njurisdiction of the Court with respect to the objection or request to be heard and to the subject \nmatter of the Settlement, including enforcement of its terms. \n20.  To be considered by the Court, an objection must include the name of the case and \nthe case number; the objectorโs name, address, and telephone number; the signature of the Class \nMember, attorney, guardian or representative, and, in the case of a guardian or representative, \nproof of the personโs status as such; a statement setting forth the specific reason(s), if any, for the \nobjection; and a statement as to whether the objector intends to appear at the Fairness Hearing.

The Court may require that an objector provide \nadditional evidence of class membership to establish standing to object. \n21.  Attendance at the Fairness Hearing is not necessary in order to have an objection \nbe considered by the Court.  However, anyone who is requesting to be heard orally at the hearing \nin opposition to approval of the Settlement or the petition for an award of attorneysโ fees, costs, \nand expenses and for incentive awards must include that request in their written objection.  Persons \nwho intend to object to the Settlement or the application for attorneysโ fees, costs, and expenses \nand for incentive awards, and who wish to present evidence at the Fairness Hearing, must include \nin their written objection(s) the identity of any witness(es) they may call to testify and copies of \nany exhibit(s) they intend to offer at the hearing.

Any requests for exclusion from the Class are due no later than March 8, 2023 (the \nโOpt-Out Deadlineโ).  Any person who would otherwise be a member of the Class who wishes to \nbe excluded from the Class must notify the Claims Administrator in writing of that intent by first-\nclass mail postmarked no later than the Opt-Out Deadline.  The written notification of opt-out must \ninclude the name of the case and the case number, along with a statement that the person wishes \nto opt out of the Settlement.  In addition, to be valid, the written notification of opt-out must \ninclude: (a) the personโs full name and signature, (b) address, and (c) telephone number. \n23.  Any individuals who submit valid and timely notifications of exclusion in the \nmanner set forth in this paragraph shall have no rights under the Settlement Agreement, shall not \nshare in the monetary relief provided by the Settlement, and shall not be bound by the Settlement \nAgreement or any Orders or final judgment of the Court. \n24.  The Claims Administrator will compile a list of valid opt-outs for submission to the \nCourt.  Any member of the Class who does not notify the Claims Administrator of their intent to \nopt out from the Class in the manner stated herein shall be deemed to have waived his or her right \nto opt out from the Class.  If the Court approves the Settlement, any such person shall forever be \nbarred from requesting exclusion from the Class in this or any other proceeding, and shall be bound \nby the Settlement and the judgment, including the Release of Claims provided for in the Settlement \nAgreement and the Final Approval Order and Judgment. \nTermination of the Settlement \n25.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n  \n20.  _โ_โIn  other words,  life  happens  on  the  sidewalks  of the  District of Columbia  all  the  time. \n21.  The  ncommoding  statute,  because  of the  extremely broad  scope  of innocent behavior  it \ncovers,  authorizes  arrest in  each  one  of these  situations  -  in  the  police  officerโs  discretion. \n22.  But,  unless  they  are  African American  or  homeless,  MPD  officers  do  not arrest them. \n23.  No  one  has  ever been  arrested  for  crowding,  obstructing,  or  incommoding in  Georgetown \nwhile  waiting to  buy  cupcakes  at  Georgetown  Cupcake. \nDetails  of Named Plaintiff Joseph Alexanderโs Arrest on  Bladensburg Road,  NE,  and his \nRelease  on  Citation \n24.  Like  other Washingtonians,  Mr.  Alexander likes  to  be  outside with  other people  when  the \nweather is  fine. \n25.  On  Saturday August 8,  2015,  about 5:30  pm,  it was  partly sunny  and  86  degrees. \nPAGE  6  OF 49 \nAMENDED  COMPLAINT  *  ALEXANDER V.  DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA\n26.  Like  people  all  across  the  City,  Mr.  Alexander was  outside  enjoying the  fine  weather  and \nthe  company  of friends  and  neighbors. \n27.  Mr.  Alexander was  standing in  the  alley where  it touches  Benning  Road,  N.E.  next to  the \nโStantonโ  store,  Figure  5,  at  1044  Bladensburg Road,  NE  in Washington,  DC,  a popular \nneighborhood  convenience  store  where  people  gather  and  buy  snacks  and  drinks. \n  \nGoogle  . \n28.  The  entire  episode  was  captured  on  โvideoโ  (or  some  type  of electronic  imaging)  because \nthe  store  has  cameras  in  the  alley which  runs  alongside  the  store  which  capture  the  alley,  and \ncameras  in  front of the  store  which  capture  the  sidewalk in  front of the  store. \n29.  The  sidewalk in  front of the  store  is  easily wide  enough  for  people  to  chat with  each  other \non  the  sidewalk and  still  allow other  people  to  walk  or  bicycle  up  or  down  the  sidewalk. \n30.  At that time  there  was  even  a public  pay phone  in  front of the  store  and  plenty  of room  for \npeople  to  use  it. \nPAGE  7  OF 49 \nAMENDED  COMPLAINT  *  ALEXANDER V.  DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA\n31.  For  example,  people,  including  Officer  Onoja,  ride  their  bikes  on  the  sidewalk in  front of \nthe  store,  and  every few minutes  someone  nides  a bicycle  up  or  down  the  sidewalk past the  store. \n  \n32. \n33.  People  also  walk up  and  down  the  street with  their  dogs. \n  \nPAGE  8  OF 49 \nAMENDED  COMPLAINT  *  ALEXANDER V.  DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA\n  \n34. \n35.  Mr.  Alexander was  standing  at the  intersection  of the  alley  and  the  sidewalk in  the  alley \nwhen  Officer  Onoja arrived,  having arrived  by walking through the  alley alongside  of the  store \nabout a minute  before  Officer  Onoja  arrived. \nPAGE 9  oF 49 \nAMENDED  COMPLAINT  *  ALEXANDER V.  DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n     \n2015-08-08  PM  05:26:34 \n  \n  \n36. \nMr.  Alexander  is  walking  ahead  of the  man  in  the  striped  shirt. \n37.  Mr.  Alexander was  not blocking passage  nor was  he  presenting an  obstacle  to  pedestrian \ntraffic.  Pedestrians,  even  a pedestrian with two  dogs  on a  leash,  were  able  to  saunter past,  as  the \npicture  shows  (Mr.  Alexander is  out of the  frame  in  the  alley behind the  young man  in  the  white \ntee  shirt).  See  picture  above  with woman walking two  dogs. \nPAGE  10  OF 49 \nAMENDED  COMPLAINT  *  ALEXANDER V.  DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA\n38.  Officer  Onoja told  Mr.  Alexander  (Mr.  Alexander  is  in  the  tee  shirt with white  and  black \nsneakers)  to  leave  the  area when  Officer  Onoja rode  up  and  saw Mr.  Alexander  standing there. \n  \n  \n39.  Mr.  Alexander  did  leave  the  area but over  the  next five  mmutes  Mr.  Alexander walked  up \nand  down  the  sidewalk  a few times. \nPAGE  11  OF 49 \nAMENDED  COMPLAINT  *  ALEXANDER V.  DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA\nAQ.  Officer  Onoja radioed  for  back up  and  three  officers  arrived  and  stood  in  the  sidewalk \nnear  the  alley for  a mmute  before  Mr.  Alexander  came  back  down  the  street. \n  \nAl.  As  Mr.  Alexander walked  down  the  sidewalk and  as  he  passed  the  alley  Officer  Onoja let \nhim  pass  and  then  grabbed  him  from behind. \n  \nA2. \nPAGE  12  OF 49 \nAMENDED  COMPLAINT  *  ALEXANDER V.  DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA\n43.  Several  officers  then  converged  on  Mr.  Alexander  and  they hand  cuffed  him  and  arrested \nhim. \n  \n  \nMr.  Alexander at the  Station,  released  on citation;  case  no-papered. \n4A,  After  Mr.  Alexander was  arrested  MPD  officers  transported  him  to  the  5th  District station. \n45.  He  was  approved  for  citation  release  and  he  was  released  on  citation. \n46.  The  OAG  โno-paperedโ  his  case. \nMr.  Alexanderโ  arrest illustrates  how the  incommoding statute  is  unconstitutional vague  and how \nthe  MPD  enforce  it mainly against African Americans  in arbitrary and  discriminatory manner \n47.  Mr.  Alexanderโ  arrest and  prosecution  pursuant to  the  incommoding  statute  illustrates  how \nthe  statute  is  unconstitutional vague  and  how the  MPD  enforce  it mainly  against African Americans \nin  arbitrary  and  discriminatory manner. \nA8.  First,  he  is  African American. \n49.  Next,  he  was  not  โcrowding,  obstructing,  or  incommodingโ  anyoneโs  passage  on  the \nsidewalk.  Rather,  he  was  using the  sidewalk as  intended. \nPAGE  13  OF 49 \nAMENDED  COMPLAINT  *  ALEXANDER V.  DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n111.  So  the  police  now take  a zero  tolerance  approach  to  quality  of life  crrmes  because  they \ndepress  property values. \n112.  The  detective  explained that when the  police  went to  Starburst Plaza they did  not \ndiscriminate  between  the  bad  and  the  good  people  and  the  police just make  the  long-time  residents \nleave  or  disperse  or  arrest them  because  congregating is  bad  for  the  community. \n113.  The  Detective  told  Mr. Junes  that the  neighborhood is  changing and people  have  to  act in \na more  civilized way. \n114.  The  Detective  told  Mr. Junes  that the  City has  big plans  for the  neighborhood. \nArrest of Young African American  Man  in  Starburst Intersection Plaza \n115.  The  Starburst Intersection  Plaza is  a broad  plaza with  broad walkways  and  the  District \ninstalled  benches  and  chess  tables  and  chairs  and  other furniture which  invite  people  to  sit and \nspend  time  in  the  park. \n2K]  Wins \nSen  Vy \nMPS \nKO  A \now  GON \noA \nSo โi  He  y  4 Dd \n  \nTop:  Current  engineering  sketches  for the  Starburst  intersection.

But,  the  way was  clear  for pedestrians  to  come  and  go  around  them  and  many people  were \nin  fact coming  and  going  around  them  because  it was  Christmas  Eve. \n147.  Suddenly the  pleasant  scene  was  shattered when  Officer Vincent Norris  rolled  up  in  his \npolice  cruiser  and  in  a furious  manner yelled  at Mr.  Agnew  and  the  others  to  leave. \n148.  Officer Norris  is  known  to  have  arrested  several  other young African American  men  in  the \narea for ncommoding who were  not incommoding or blocking the  way. \n149.  Mr.  Agnew explained  that they were  simply taking the  air  and  smoking  outside  because  his \ndaughter  had  asthma  and  he  did  not  smoke  around  her. \n150.  He  explained  that the  mother  lived  there  and  they had  every right to  be  there. \n151.  Enraged,  Officer  Norris  screamed  at Mr.  Agnew and the  others  to  leave  because,  as  he \nsaid,  they were  โblocking passage.โ \nPAGE  28  OF 49 \nAMENDED  COMPLAINT  ยข  ALEXANDER V.

No  other person was  in  sight. \n160.  If someone  had  come  by,  Mr.  Dennis  would  have  moved. \n161.  The  police  report does  not mention  anyone  who  could  not get past him. \n162.  That holiday  spirit vanished when  Officer Vincent Norris  rolled  up  in  his  police  cruiser \nand  in  a furious  manner yelled  at Mr.  Dennis  and  another  man  to  leave. \n163.  Mr.  Dennis  refused  to  move  because,  as  he  explained,  he  was  simply  standing in  front of \nhis  home. \nPAGE  30  OF 49 \nAMENDED  COMPLAINT  *  ALEXANDER V.

Officer Amosโ  report does  not  state  that he  observed  any people  at all who  were  present at \nthe  location  when  he  observed  Ms.  Williamson. \n174.  Ms.  Williamson was  standing  on  the  sidewalk  and  walking  on  the  sidewalk when  she  was \nobserved  by  Officer Amos. \n175.  |The  way was  clear  for  pedestrians  to  come  and  go. \n176.  No  one  was  trying to  walk  on  the  sidewalk where  Ms.  Williamson was. \n177.  She  was  not blocking the  passage  or  even  obstructing it. \n178.  Ifsomeone  had  come  by,  Ms.  Williamson would  have  moved  as  needed. \n179.  The  police  report does  not mention  anyone  who  could  not get past her  during his  initial \nencounter with  her. \n180.  Officer Amos  ordered  Ms.  Williamson  to  leave  about 3:30  pm. \n181.  Ms.  Williamson  continued walking and  standing in  the  area but always  allowing other \npeople  enjoying the  area with  her  to  have  free  passage  on  the  sidewalk. \nPAGE  32  OF 49 \nAMENDED  COMPLAINT  *  ALEXANDER V.

After years  of investigation  the  only  Caucasian person  the  MPD  have  issued  a move  on \norder to  under the  incommoding  statute  was  the  photojournalist who  tried  to  record  an  MPD \ninteraction with  a homeless  man  described  above. \n198.  The  police  never  arrested  any  Caucasian  or Asian  pedestrian  standing on  the  sidewalk \noutside  the  cupcake  store  in  Georgetown  at 3301  M  Street,  N.W.  which  is  a  Caucasian  owned \nbusiness \n  \n199. \n200.

      "text": "Case 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 79   Filed 07/24/23   Page 1 of 7\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n____________________________________ \n) \nJOSEPH ALEXANDER,  ) \n) \nPlaintiff,  ) \n)   \nv.  )  Civil Action No. 17-1885 (ABJ) \n) \nGOVERNMENT OF   ) \nTHE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,  ) \n) \nDefendant.  ) \n____________________________________) \n \nFINAL ORDER OF APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT \n \nIn accordance with this Courtโs Preliminary Approval Order [Dkt. # 64], as amended \n[Dkt. # 71], and after Notice was provided to the class as specified in the Preliminary Approval \nOrder, the Court held a Fairness Hearing on July 20, 2023.  After consideration of plaintiffโs \nConsent Motion for Final Approval [Dkt. # 74], in the absence of any objection by Class \nMembers to the proposed settlement, and for the reasons set forth on the record at the Fairness \nHearing, the Court finds that there is good cause for the entry of this Final Order of Approval \nof Settlement and no just reasons for delay.  Therefore, the settlement will be approved, and it \nis hereby ORDERED: \n1.  This  Order  (the  โFinal  Approval  Orderโ)  incorporates  by  reference  the \ndefinitions in the Settlement Agreement, and all capitalized terms shall have the same meanings \nset forth in the Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement was approved by the Courtโs \nPreliminary Approval Order [Dkt. # 64], entered on December 23, 2022, and as amended in the \nAmended Preliminary Approval Order [Dkt. # 71], entered on February 23, 2023. As used herein \nreferences to the Courtโs Preliminary Approval Order mean the Courtโs Preliminary Approval \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 79   Filed 07/24/23   Page 2 of 7\nOrder as amended. \n2.  The terms of this Courtโs Preliminary Approval Order are incorporated by \nreference in this Order. \n3.  The Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of the Lawsuit, the Parties, and \nall members of the Class. \n4.  Class Counsel adequately represented the Class for the purpose of entering into \nand implementing the Settlement Agreement. Class counsel has made reasonable efforts to \nconsult with members of the class. \nClass Certified Under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) \n \n5.  This  Court  found,  in  its  Preliminary  Order  of  Approval  and  Amended \nPreliminary Approval Order, that for purposes of the settlement, all prerequisites for the \nmaintenance of a class action under Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 23(a) and 23(b)(3) were satisfied, and  that \nClass Members had the right to opt-out.  For the reasons set forth on the record at the Fairness \nHearing, the Court hereby reaffirms its findings certifying the class.  \nSettlement Agreement is Fair, Adequate, and Reasonable \n \n6.  The  Court  finds  that  the  Settlement  Agreement  (including  its  exhibits  and \nattachments) and the settlement contemplated thereby are the product of armโs length, good faith \nsettlement negotiations between the Defendant and Class Counsel. \n7.  For reasons set forth on the record at the Fairness Hearing, the Settlement \nAgreement [Dkt. # 62-2] and the settlement set forth therein are hereby approved and found to \nbe fair, adequate, and reasonable, in the best interest of the Class as a whole, and in satisfaction \nof Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and due process requirements. \n8.  The Court hereby finds and concludes that class notice was disseminated to \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 79   Filed 07/24/23   Page 3 of 7\nmembers of the Class in accordance with the terms set forth in the Settlement Agreement and in \ncompliance  with  this  Courtโs  Preliminary  Approval  Order.  The  Court  further  finds  and \nconcludes that the notice fully satisfied Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the \nrequirements of due process, was the best notice practicable under the circumstances, and \nsupports the Courtโs exercise of jurisdiction over the Class as contemplated by the Settlement \nAgreement and this Order. \n9.  The Court hereby finally approves the Settlement Agreement and the settlement \ncontemplated thereby. It finds that the terms constitute, in all respects, a fair, reasonable, and \nadequate settlement in accordance with Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and directs \nconsummation  of  the  settlement  pursuant  to  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Settlement \nAgreement. The Court finds the financial terms of the settlement favorable to class members. \n10.  The fairness and adequacy of the settlement is reflected in the Classโs satisfaction \nwith the settlement. There were approximately 157 identified potential Class Members who were \nmailed Notice and Claim Forms. About 34 Notices were returned as undeliverable. After re- \nresearching  addresses  for  returned  mailings,  and  after  additional  research  into  addresses \nconducted by the District, at least 25 additional Notices were re-mailed. \n11.  As of July 18, 2023, the Class Administrator had received and processed a total \nof 25 Claim Forms. The reaction rate is very favorable compared to other similar class actions \nespecially given the challenges posed by identifying class members in the first instance and by \nthe nature of the class such as the transient nature of the Class Members. The reaction rate and \nclaims rate will likely go up because the Claims Administrator is still mailing Notices and the \nclaims period is not yet over so likely more claims will be received. The last day for class \nmembers to file a Claim Form is July 25, 2023 (postmarked). There was not a single objection and \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 79   Filed 07/24/23   Page 4 of 7\nno class member opted out. Thus, not a single class member expressed any type of dissatisfaction \nwith any aspect of the Settlement. This is a highly favorable reaction by the class to the \nsettlement. See, e.g., Vista Healthplan, Inc. v. Warner Holdings Co. III, Ltd., 246 F.R.D. 349, \n362 (D.D.C. 2007) (50 opt outs and one objection out of 41,561 notices sent; the few number of \nopt outs and โexistence of even a relatively few objections certainly counsels in favor of \napprovalโ); In re Lorazepam & Clorazepate Antitrust Litig., 205 F.R.D. 369, 398-99 (D.D.C. \n2002) (13 objectors and 14 opt outs from class in which over 13,000 copies of the class notice \nwere sent; โ[t]he fact that such an overwhelming majority of class members elected to stay in \nthe class evidences a favorable reaction by the class to the settlementโ and objections were not \nwell taken and relatively low in numbers). These indicia of the approval of the class of the terms \nof the settlement support a finding of fairness under Rule 23 under any measure. \nNotice \n \n12.  As required by the Court in its Preliminary Approval Order: \n \n(a) Class and Settlement Notice were mailed to all potential class members or \ntheir representatives whose addresses could be obtained with reasonable diligence; and \n(b) Class Settlement and Notice were published as provided for in the Settlement \nAgreement and Preliminary Approval Order. \n13.  The Notice given to the class is hereby determined to be fully in compliance with \nboth the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and due process. The \nNotice given is further found to be the best notice practicable under the circumstances and, \ntherefore, constitutes due and sufficient notice to all parties. Class Counsel circulated copies of \nthe Notice and Claim forms among the Superior Court Trial Lawyers Association. \n14.  Due and adequate notice of the proceedings having been given to the Class and \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 79   Filed 07/24/23   Page 5 of 7\na full opportunity having been offered to the Class to participate in the hearing, it is hereby \ndetermined that all Class Members are bound by this Final Order of Approval of Settlement. \nClass Counsel \n15.  The Court reaffirms appointment of William Claiborne as Class Counsel. \n \nAppointment of Class Administrator \n \n16.  Pursuant to the Preliminary Approval Order, JND Class Action Administration \n(โJNDโ) was appointed to be the Class Administrator. The Court approves and affirms that \nappointment,  finds  that  the  Class  Administrator  was  qualified,  and  has  discharged  its \nresponsibilities as the Class Administrator. The Class Administrator, to the extent its duties are \nnot yet completed, is authorized by this Order to complete those duties. \nGeneral Provisions \n \n17.  Claim Forms not received or post-marked by July 25, 2023, shall not be paid, \nalthough such persons shall nonetheless be bound by this Order. \n18.  All Class Members shall be bound by this Order. \n \n19.  Except as provided by this Order, each party shall bear its own expenses and \nattorneyโs fees. \n20.  At the conclusion of the Class Distribution and no later than August 30, 2023, \nthe Class Administrator shall submit a report to the Court and the parties summarizing the \npayments made to the class, and seeking any final administrative costs to be approved. \nFinal Approval of Settlement \n \n21.  The  Court  incorporates  herein  by  reference  and  ratifies  its  prior  order \npreliminarily approving the settlement [Dkt. # 71] (โPreliminary Approval Orderโ). \n22.  The Court finds that the parties satisfied the notice provisions set forth in \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 79   Filed 07/24/23   Page 6 of 7\nthe Preliminary Approval Order. \n23.  The settlement received a favorable reaction from the class. The reaction rate for \nthe class is in line with this type of case. There were no objections or opt-outs. \n24.  The Court finds that an award of fees as negotiated and set forth in the Settlement \nAgreement is fair and reasonable and awards such fees and expenses. \n25.  The Court finally approves the Settlement Class Definitions as follows: \n \nIndividuals who (i) were arrested solely for incommoding under D.C. Code \nยง 22- 1307; (ii) on or after September 18, 2014; and (iii) either were released \nwithout charges being filed or had any charges dismissed nolle prosequi. \n \nPayments \n \n26.  The Court approves payments to be disbursed as follows, in the timing and \nmanner set forth in the Settlement Agreement ($450,000 total), as amended, by this Final \nApproval Order: \nโบ  $5,000 to the Class Representative as an incentive award; \n \nโบ  $130,000 for Attorneyโs Fees and Costs; \n \nโบ  Up to $35,000.00 for Administrative Expenses; 1 \n \nโบ  $280,000.00 for  the Class Fund, for  payment of  Verified  Claims \nto Class Members. \n27.  Any amounts remaining in the Class Settlement Fund 60 days after the Class \nAdministrator has issued all payments to eligible claimants, including funds from any uncashed \nchecks that are no longer negotiable, will revert to the District of Columbia General Fund. \n \n1   The Class Administrator has advised that the actual administrative expenses are likely to \ntotal approximately $35,000, rather than the $25,000 initially contemplated in the Settlement \nAgreement, and it will provide an invoice with the total amount by August 30, 2023. As provided \nin the Settlement Agreement,  the  excess  cost  will  be  paid  from  the  Class  Fund  and  the \nClass  Fund  has accordingly been adjusted.   \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 79   Filed 07/24/23   Page 7 of 7\n28.  The Court hereby dismisses this Lawsuit, with prejudice, and without fees or \ncosts to any party except as otherwise expressly provided by the Settlement Agreement. \n29.  This Order shall constitute a final order and have res judicata and collateral effect \nagainst all class members meeting the definition(s) above. \nAttorneyโs Fees and Expenses \n \n30.  Upon consideration of Plaintiffโs Consent Motion for Final Approval of Class \nAction Settlement which included an unopposed Request for an Award of Attorneyโs Fees \nand Expenses in the amount of $130,000 [Dkt. # 74], the Settlement Agreement, and the record \nof this case, the attorneyโs fees and expenses sought by Plaintiff are reasonable. \n31.  The awarded attorneyโs fees and expenses shall be allocated from the Settlement \nAmount that shall be remitted by the District of Columbia by wire to Class Counsel William \nClaiborne within 45 days of entry of this order to an account designated by Class Counsel. \n32.  The Court orders that Class Counsel is awarded attorneyโs fees and expenses of \n$130,000.00 for the work performed for this case.  \nSO ORDERED. \n \n \n \n \nAMY BERMAN JACKSON \nUnited States District Judge \n \nDATE:  July 24, 2023 \n7 \n ",

Under \nsuch circumstances, and where such Class Memberโs current address is discernible, the Class \nAdministrator shall additionally send a copy of the Notice and Claim Form by First Class mail to \nthe current address of such Class Member. \n5.

Civil Action No. 17-1885 (ABJ) \n      \nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,        \n         \n                       Defendant.   \n \nAMENDED PRELIMINARY APPROVAL ORDER \n \n1.  Named plaintiff and Class Representative Joseph Alexander and defendant District \nof Columbia entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release on December 9, 2022 (โSettlementโ \nor โSettlement Agreementโ) [Dkt # 62-2], which, together with the exhibits attached thereto and \nthe exhibits attached to the Partiesโ Joint Motion for Modification of Notice and Preliminary \nApproval Order, sets forth the terms and conditions for a proposed global resolution of this litigation \nand for its dismissal with prejudice. \n2.  The  parties  have  moved  the  Court  for  an  order  preliminarily  approving  the \nSettlement under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, certifying a Class for purposes of settlement, \nand approving notice to the Class as described below. The Court is familiar with and has reviewed \nthe record, the Settlement Agreement and its exhibits, the Memorandum in Support of the Joint \nMotion  for  an  Order  Granting  Preliminary  Approval  of  Class  Action  Settlement,  and  the \nsupporting affidavit, and it finds that there is good cause to enter this Order.1 \n \n \n \n1  Unless otherwise specified, all capitalized terms used herein have the same meanings \nascribed to them in the Settlement Agreement. \n\n \nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 71   Filed 02/23/23   Page 2 of 10\nSchedule of Settlement-Related Events \n \n3.  Based on the findings in this Order and the proposal by the parties, the Court enters \nthe following schedule: \nEvent  Date \n \nDefendant shall provide the Settlement Agreement \nFebruary 27, 2023  \nDatabase to Class Counsel and Class Administrator \n  \n \nDefendant  shall  wire  $25,000.00  to  the  Class \nMarch 13, 2023  \nAdministrator \n \n \nClass Administrator to establish website and mail \nMarch 27, 2023  \nNotice and Claim and Release Forms \n \n \nPlaintiff must file his motion for final approval of the \nApril 11, 2023  \nSettlement and any motions for attorneysโ fees and \n \nexpenses and for incentive awards for the Named \nPlaintiff. The motion must include updated \ninformation specifying the number of class members. \n \nDeadline for Class Members to submit any objections \n  June 14, 2023  \nto the proposed Settlement in accordance with this \norder   \n \nDeadline for Class Members to opt out of the Class \nApril 26, 2023  \n \n \nDeadline for any opposition or response to objections, \n  June 29, 2023  \nincluding objections to award of attorneysโ fees and \ncosts   \n  July 14, 2023, at 2:00 p.m.  \nFinal Approval and Fairness Hearing \n \n  July 25, 2023  \nFinal date for submission of claims \n \nSettlement Class Certification \n \n4.  The Court finds, upon preliminary evaluation and for purposes of the Settlement \nonly, that it will likely be able to certify the following Class pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23: \n  2 \n\n \nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 71   Filed 02/23/23   Page 3 of 10\nIndividuals who (i) were arrested solely for incommoding under D.C. Code ยง 22-1307; \n \n(ii) on or after September 18, 2014; and (iii) either were released without charges being \nfiled or had any charges dismissed nolle prosequi. \n5.  The  Court  preliminarily  finds,  for  purposes  of  the  Settlement  only,  that  the \nrequirements of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(3) are likely to be satisfied for the \nClass. In support of this conclusion, the Court provisionally finds as follows: \na.  The number of Class Members is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable. The parties have agreed to this preliminary finding and according to the complaint \nin this case, the number of persons who were arrested, prosecuted, or who โposted and forfeitedโ \nfor incommoding each year through 2016 is at least 50. \nb.  Questions of law and fact common to the Class predominate over individualized \nquestions. The common questions include (i) whether the Districtโs alleged false arrests violate \nthe Fourth Amendment, and (ii)  whether the Districtโs enforcement of the incommoding statute \nviolated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. \nc.  The Class Representativeโs claims are typical of the claims of the Class. Each of \nthe claims arises from the enforcement of D.C. Code ยง 22-1307 and asserts the same theories of \nliability. \nd.  The proposed Class Representative, Joseph Alexander, will fairly and adequately \nrepresent the rights and interests of the Class. Accordingly, the Court hereby appoints him to serve \nas Class Representative.  Additionally, the Court hereby appoints William Claiborne as Class \nCounsel.  Mr. Claiborne has significant experiencing litigating federal civil rights class actions \nagainst the federal government and has committed the necessary resources to represent the Class. \n  3 \n\n \nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 71   Filed 02/23/23   Page 4 of 10\nThe Court accordingly appoints Mr. Claiborne as Class Counsel under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(g). \nPreliminary Approval of the Settlement \n \n6.  The Settlement is the product of non-collusive armโs-length negotiations, including \nmediation, among experienced counsel who were thoroughly informed of the strengths and \nweaknesses of the Action, including through informal discovery, motion practice, and a contested \nappeal.  The  Settlement  confers  substantial  benefits  upon  the  Class  and  avoids  the  costs, \nuncertainty, delays, and other risks associated with continued litigation, trial, and/or appeal. The \nSettlement falls within the range of possible recovery for the Class, compares favorably with the \npotential recovery as balanced against the risks of continued litigation, does not grant preferential \ntreatment to Named Plaintiff or his counsel, and has no obvious deficiencies. \n7.  The Court hereby preliminarily approves the Settlement, as memorialized in the \nSettlement Agreement and its Exhibits, as fair, reasonable, and adequate, and in the best interest \nof Named Plaintiff and Class Members, subject to further consideration at the Fairness Hearing to \nbe conducted as described below. \n8.  All funds should be deposited and released in accordance with the timing and \nschedule detailed in the Settlement Agreement. \nManner and Form of Notice \n \n9.  The Court approves, as to form and content, the Notice and the Claim Form, \nattached to the Joint Motion for Modification of Notice and Preliminary Approval Order, and it \nfinds that the Notice Plan set forth in the Settlement Agreement as Attachment 1 [Dkt. # 62-2] \nand as modified in the Joint Motion for Modification of Notice and Preliminary Approval Order \nmeets the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, due process, and all other applicable \nlaw and rules; constitutes the best notice practicable under the circumstances; and will provide due \n  4 \n\n \nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 71   Filed 02/23/23   Page 5 of 10\nand sufficient notice to all individuals entitled thereto. The Notice Plan provides for direct notice \nvia First Class mail to all Class Members and reasonable efforts to determine the current address \nof Class Members who fail to respond to initial notice or whose initial notice by First Class mail \nis returned to sender by the United States Postal Service. The plan also provides for a Settlement \nWebsite containing information regarding the Settlement and links to the Notice and other relevant \ncase documents.  This plan and the Notice are reasonably calculated under the circumstances to \napprise Class Members of the pendency and nature of the Action, the definition of the class \ncertified, the effect of the proposed Settlement, and the Class Membersโ rights to participate in, \nopt out of, or object to any aspect of the proposed Settlement. The date and time of the Fairness \nHearing  shall  be  included  in  the  Notice  before  its  dissemination  and  posting.  The  Claims \nAdministrator is authorized to make non-substantive formatting changes to the Notice and Claim \nForm that do not substantially change the content therein. \n10.  The Court hereby appoints JND Legal Administration (JND) to serve as the Claims \nAdministrator, as defined in the Settlement Agreement, to supervise and administer the notice \nprocedures, establish and operate a settlement website (the โWebsiteโ) and a toll-free number, \nadminister the claims processes, distribute cash payments according to the processes and criteria \nset forth in the Settlement Agreement, and perform any other duties of the Claims Administrator \nthat are reasonably necessary and/or provided for in the Settlement Agreement. \n11.  Implementation costs incurred in identifying and notifying Class Members, and in \nadministering the Settlement Fund, shall be paid as set forth in the Settlement Agreement. \nDefendant will take the measures required, including paying the $25,000 set forth in the Settlement \nAgreement at II(A)(4) and II(B)(2) and as modified by the Joint Motion to Modify the Notice and \nPreliminary Approval Order, to ensure that an amount sufficient to fund the Notice campaign, is \ndisbursed to the Claims Administrator by March 13, 2023. \n  5 \n\n \nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 71   Filed 02/23/23   Page 6 of 10\n12.  As soon as practicable, and no later than March 27, 2023, the Claims Administrator \nmust establish the Website and post the Notice and Claim Form thereon. \n13.  No later than March 27, 2023, the Claims Administrator shall (i) mail the Notice, \nsubstantially in the form annexed to the Settlement Agreement, in accordance with the Settlement \nNotice Plan and (ii) cause publication of the Notice to occur, as detailed in the Joint Motion for \nPreliminary Approval of Class Action Settlement, and the Notice campaign will continue for \nseveral weeks thereafter. \n14.  Class Members who wish to make a claim to recover out of the Settlement Fund \nmust complete and submit a Claim Form no later than July 25, 2023, in accordance with the \ninstructions contained on the Claim Form. The Claims Administrator shall determine the eligibility \nof claims and, upon the Effective Date, distribute the Settlement Fund in accordance with the \nSettlement Agreement. \n15.  The dates established herein may be extended by Order of the Court, for good cause \n \nshown. \n \nThe Fairness Hearing \n16.  The Court will hold a Fairness Hearing on  July 14, 2023, at 2:00 p.m., in \nCourtroom 3 of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 333 Constitution \nAve.,  N.W.,  Washington,  D.C.  20001,  for  the  following  purposes:  (i)  to  make  the  final \ndetermination as to whether the Class satisfies the applicable requirements for certification under \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(3); (ii) to determine whether the Settlement \nshould be approved as fair, reasonable, and adequate; and (iii) to consider any other matters that \nmay properly be brought before the Court in connection with the Settlement. \n17.  The Court intends to consider the petition for an award of attorneysโ fees, expenses, \nand costs and for incentive awards at the Fairness Hearing, but it may determine at or in advance \n  6 \n\n \nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 71   Filed 02/23/23   Page 7 of 10\nof the hearing that the application is to be considered separately from the fairness, reasonableness, \nand adequacy of the remainder of the Settlement. If it does so, any appeal from an order relating \nsolely to the petition for an award of attorneysโ fees, costs, and expenses, and/or for incentive \nawards, or any reversal or modification of any such order, shall not operate to terminate or cancel \nthe Settlement or to affect or delay the judgment finally approving the Settlement. \n18.  Motions in support of final approval of the Settlement and of the petition for \nattorneysโ fees, expenses, and costs and for incentive awards must be filed no later than April 11, \n2023.  Any oppositions must be filed no later than June 29, 2023 in compliance with the next \nsection of this Order. \nObjections and Appearances at the Fairness Hearing \n19.  Any member of the Class may appear at the Fairness Hearing and show cause why \nthe proposed Settlement should or should not be approved as fair, reasonable, and adequate, or \nwhy judgment should or should not be entered, or to present opposition to the petition for attorneysโ \nfees, costs, and expenses, or to the application for incentive awards. No person will be entitled to \ncontest the approval of the Settlement, the entry of a final judgment dismissing the action and \nreleasing Class Member claims, or the petition for an award of attorneysโ fees, costs, and expenses \nand for incentive awards, unless they have submitted an objection by June 14, 2023 (the โObjection \nDeadlineโ).  Any objections must be submitted to the Claims Administrator, class counsel, and \ndefense counsel, in writing, by mail, and postmarked by the Objection Deadline, or they will not \nbe considered.  The parties must submit all objections to the Court by June 29, 2023. Any Class \nMember who does not make their objection in the time and manner provided for herein shall  be \ndeemed to have waived any objection and shall forever be barred from making any  \nobjection to the fairness, reasonableness, or adequacy of the proposed Settlement, or to the petition \nfor attorneysโ fees, costs, and expenses and for incentive awards.  By objecting, or otherwise \n  7 \n\n \nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 71   Filed 02/23/23   Page 8 of 10\nrequesting to be heard at the Fairness Hearing, a person shall be deemed to have submitted to the \njurisdiction of the Court with respect to the objection or request to be heard and to the subject matter \nof the Settlement, including enforcement of its terms. \n20.  To be considered by the Court, an objection must include the name of the case and \nthe case number; the objectorโs name, address, and telephone number; the signature of the Class \nMember, attorney, guardian or representative, and, in the case of a guardian or representative, \nproof of the personโs status as such; a statement setting forth the specific reason(s), if any, for the \nobjection; and a statement as to whether the objector intends to appear at the Fairness Hearing. In \naddition,  for  his  or  her  objection  to  be  valid,  an  objector  also  must  provide  a  statement \ndemonstrating that the objector is a Class Member. The Court may require that an objector provide \nadditional evidence of class membership to establish standing to object. \n21.  Attendance at the Fairness Hearing is not necessary in order to have an objection \nbe considered by the Court. However, anyone who is requesting to be heard orally at the hearing \nin opposition to approval of the Settlement or the petition for an award of attorneysโ fees, costs, \nand expenses and for incentive awards must include that request in their written objection. Persons \nwho intend to object to the Settlement or the application for attorneysโ fees, costs, and expenses \nand for incentive awards, and who wish to present evidence at the Fairness Hearing, must include \nin their written objection(s) the identity of any witness(es) they may call to testify and copies of \nany exhibit(s) they intend to offer at the hearing. If an objector hires an attorney to represent them \nfor the purposes of making an objection, the attorney must file a notice of appearance with the \nCourt by the Objection Deadline.  The Court will make the determination as to whether any individual \nobjector will have the opportunity to speak or to present evidence in its discretion. \nExclusion from the Class \n \n22.  Any requests for exclusion from the Class are due no later than April 26, 2023 (the \n  8 \n\n \nCase 1:17-cv-01885-ABJ   Document 71   Filed 02/23/23   Page 9 of 10\nโOpt-Out Deadlineโ).

The Claims Administrator will compile a list of valid opt-outs for submission to the \nCourt. Any member of the Class who does not notify the Claims Administrator of their intent to \nopt out from the Class in the manner stated herein shall be deemed to have waived his or her right \nto opt out from the Class. If the Court approves the Settlement, any such person shall forever be \nbarred from requesting exclusion from the Class in this or any other proceeding, and shall be bound \nby the Settlement and the judgment, including the Release of Claims provided for in the Settlement \nAgreement and the Final Approval Order and Judgment. \nTermination of the Settlement \n25.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 2 of 45\n1.  Joseph Alexander on behalf of himself and the Arrest Class and the Prosecution Class \n(both defined below) brings this action against the Government of the District of Columbia (the \nโDistrictโ or the โDistrict of Columbiaโ) for injuries he and the other members of the classes \nsuffered during the Class Period because the D.C. Council enacted an โincommodingโ or \nโblocking passageโ statute which is so vague that it encourages arbitrary and discriminatory \nenforcement, and it fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes fails to \ndefine the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what \nconduct is prohibited so  they cannot know what they must do to conform their conduct to the \nstatute. D.C. Code ยง 22-1307 (revised1 in 2011).  \n2.  Moreover, the District through its MPD (defined below) enforces the statute in an arbitrary \nand discriminatory manner because the MPD enforces the โincommodingโ statute almost \nexclusively against African Americans, especially in predominantly or traditionally African \nAmerican areas of the City. The statute delegates to the officer on the beat unfettered discretion to \ndefine โcrowding, obstructing, or incommoding.โ MPD officers approach African Americans who \nare standing still on the sidewalk in order to warn or cite them for blocking passage, regardless of \nthe number of persons and regardless of whether they are presenting an obstacle to pedestrian \ntraffic, \"only at the whim of any police officer.\" \n3.  The District has allowed its officers to expand the โstop blockingโ element of the law which \nmakes it a criminal offense โto continue or resume the crowding, obstructing, or incommoding \nafter being instructed by a law enforcement officer to cease the crowding, obstructing, or \n                                              \n1 The provision was enacted in its current form in 2011. D.C. Act 18-693, ยง 302 (a), 58 D.C. \nReg. 640, 644 (2011) (emergency legislation); D.C. Act 19-45, ยง 302 (a), 58 D.C. Reg. 3701, \n3705 (2011) (second emergency legislation); D.C. Act 18-699, ยง 2 (a), 58 D.C. Reg. 731 (2011) \n(permanent legislation). \n   PAGE 2 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 3 of 45\nincommodingโ into a โmove onโ provision which authorizes the MPD to, in their unlimited \ndiscretion, to banish someone from an area. The OAG has endorsed the MPDโs expansion of the \nโtop blockingโ provision. As enforced by the MPD with the approval of the Attorney General, the \nstatute reads: โit is unlawful for any person to stand or loiter upon any sidewalk of the city after \nhaving been requested by any police officer to move on.\" \n4.  The Attorney General of the District of Columbia (the โOAGโ) (directly and through the \nUS Attorney acting with the consent of the OAG pursuant to D.C. Code ยง 23-101(d) and (e)) \nprosecutes mainly African Americans except in the protestor context. 2 \n5.  As a result of the vagueness of D.C. Code ยง 22-1307, alone or in combination with the lack \nof MPD training and supervision, and the failure of the D.C. Council to clarify the law, this \nprovision has come to be used as an unconstitutional anti-loitering statute and one of the preferred \nstatutes for law enforcement officers to use in lieu of the disorderly conduct statute as the favored \nโcontempt of copโ charge. \n6.  The class period in this case runs from three years from the date of filing of the original \ncomplaint in Agnew, et al, v. Government of the District of Columbia, 15-349 (ABJ), which was \nfiled on 3/09/15. That case (dismissed on 6/26/17; appeal noted) employed the same class \ndefinitions in this case and so it tolled the statute of limitations for class members in both cases.   \n                                              \n2 The penalty for a violation of D.C. Code ยง 22-1307 is a fine of $500 or 90 days in jail. The Office \nof the Attorney General of the District of Columbia (\"OAG\") is the proper authority to prosecute \nalleged violations of the incommoding statute. D.C. Code ยง 23-101(b). However, the US Attorney \nmay also prosecute cases under the incommoding statute if the Attorney General of the District of \nColumbia consents. D.C. Code ยง 23-101(d) and (e). \n   PAGE 3 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 4 of 45\nJurisdiction and Venue \n7.  This Court has original jurisdiction over plaintiffsโ ยง 1983 claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง \n1331 and 28 U.S.C. ยง 1343(a)(3).  \n8.  Venue is appropriate in this District. Each of the claims for relief arose in this judicial \ndistrict and all events described herein occurred in the District of Columbia.  \nParties \n9.  Mr. Alexander is an adult. \n10.  Mr. Alexander is a young African American man. \n11.  Officer Onoja is a member of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department \n(sometimes โMPDโ). He is not named as a party but he played a prominent role in Mr. \nAlexanderโs arrest and the arrest of others for crowding, obstructing, or incommoding under D.C. \nCode ยง 22-1307 during the Class Period. \n12.  The District is a municipal corporation capable of being sued under D.C. Code ยง 1-102. \n13.  During all events described herein, all police officers referred to herein, named or \nunnamed, unless otherwise specified, were police officers of the District of Columbia Metropolitan \nPolice Department acting within the scope of that employment, in furtherance of the interests of \nthe District of Columbia, and under color of the statutes, ordinances, rules, customs, and usage of \nthe District of Columbia. \nSidewalk Use \n   PAGE 4 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 5 of 45\n14.  People use sidewalks as a gathering place where they can socialize, shop, and enjoy the \ntheatre of life, and not just as paths like the people-movers that connect terminals in airports. As \nAristotle says, โPeople are by nature urban creatures.โ Politics Book I (1253a1-18). \n \n15.  Figure 1, people lined up along 33d Street, NW in Georgetown waiting to buy cupcakes at \nGeorgetown Cupcake. \n16.  They stop, shake hands, and chat, and, invariably, as part of human nature when they stop \nand chat they stop in the middle of the sidewalk.  \n17.  Elderly people use walkers on the sidewalk.  \n18.   \n   PAGE 5 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 6 of 45\n19.  Figure 2, elderly resident uses walker on sidewalk in Southeast. \n20.  They push large baby carriages up narrow, tree-lined, leaf covered sidewalks and they stop \nand visit with neighbors standing there or passing by.  \n21.    \n22.  Figure 3, young mom pushing a large baby buggy on a narrow sidewalk unwittingly \nโcrowds, obstructs, and incommodesโ a sidewalk in the District of Columbia. \n23.  They queue up on the sidewalk to catch the Metrobus and get into the theatre.  \n24.  They sit on the steps of the Smithsonian to enjoy the weather. They sit outside at outdoor \ncafes.  \n   PAGE 6 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 7 of 45\n \n25.  They stand in groups on the sidewalk after services and talk after leaving their churches, \ntemples, and mosques, and other places of worship.  \n26.  They completely clog the sidewalks after sporting events and concerts at venues like the \nVerizon Center. \n27.  And young guys have always liked to hang on the corners.\n \n   PAGE 7 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 8 of 45\n28.  People do it all over the world. \n \n29.  They hang out on the streets and corners, especially in the poorer neighborhoods, where \nthere are no theatres, museums, or outdoor cafes, and the government has not sponsored \nredevelopment zones. \n30.  In other words, life happens on the sidewalks of the District of Columbia all the time.  \n31.  The incommoding statute, because of the extremely broad scope of innocent behavior it \ncovers, authorizes arrest in each one of these situations - in the police officerโs discretion. \n32.  But, unless they are African American or homeless, MPD officers do not arrest them.  \n33.  No one has ever been arrested for crowding, obstructing, or incommoding in Georgetown \nwhile waiting to buy cupcakes at Georgetown Cupcake \nDetails of Named Plaintiff Joseph Alexanderโs Arrest on Bladensburg Road, NE, and his \nRelease on Citation \n   PAGE 8 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 9 of 45\n34.  Like other Washingtonians, Mr. Alexander likes to be outside with other people when the \nweather is fine.   \n35.  On Saturday August 8, 2015, about 5:30 pm, it was partly sunny and 86 degrees. \n36.  Like people all across the City, Mr. Alexander was outside enjoying the fine weather and \nthe company of friends and neighbors. \n37.  Mr. Alexander was standing in the alley where it touches Benning Road, N.E. next to the \nโStantonโ store, Figure 5, at 1044 Bladensburg Road, NE in Washington, DC, a popular \nneighborhood convenience store where people gather and buy snacks and drinks.\n \n38.  The entire episode was captured on โvideoโ (or some type of electronic imaging) because \nthe store has cameras in the alley which runs alongside the store which capture the alley, and \ncameras in front of the store which capture the sidewalk in front of the store. \n39.  The sidewalk in front of the store is easily wide enough for people to chat with each other \non the sidewalk and still allow other people to walk or bicycle up or down the sidewalk. \n   PAGE 9 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 10 of 45\n40.  At that time there was even a public pay phone in front of the store and plenty of room for \npeople to use it. \n41.  For example, people, including Officer Onoja, ride their bikes on the sidewalk in front of \nthe store, and every few minutes someone rides a bicycle up or down the sidewalk past the store.  \n42.   \n43.   \n44.  People also walk up and down the street with their dogs. \n \n   PAGE 10 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 11 of 45\n  \n \n45.    \n46.  Mr. Alexander was standing at the intersection of the alley and the sidewalk in the alley \nwhen Officer Onoja arrived, having arrived by walking through the alley alongside of the store \nabout a minute before Officer Onoja arrived. \n   PAGE 11 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 12 of 45\n47. \nMr. Alexander is walking ahead of the man in the striped shirt. \n48.  Mr. Alexander was not blocking passage nor was he presenting an obstacle to pedestrian \ntraffic. Pedestrians, even a pedestrian with two dogs on a leash, were able to saunter past, as the \npicture shows (Mr. Alexander is out of the frame in the alley behind the young man in the white \ntee shirt). See picture above with woman walking two dogs. \n   PAGE 12 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 13 of 45\n49.  Officer Onoja told Mr. Alexander (Mr. Alexander is in the tee shirt with white and black \nsneakers) to leave the area when Officer Onoja rode up and saw Mr. Alexander standing there.\n  \n50.  Mr. Alexander did leave the area but over the next five minutes Mr. Alexander walked up \nand down the sidewalk a few times. \n   PAGE 13 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 14 of 45\n51.  Officer Onoja radioed for back up and three officers arrived and stood in the sidewalk \nnear the alley for a minute before Mr. Alexander came back down the street. \n \n52.  As Mr. Alexander walked down the sidewalk and as he passed the alley Officer Onoja let \nhim pass and then grabbed him from behind. \n53. \n  \n   PAGE 14 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 15 of 45\n54.  Several officers then converged on Mr. Alexander and they hand cuffed him and arrested \nhim. \n \nMr. Alexander at the Station, released on citation; case no-papered \n55.  After Mr. Alexander was arrested MPD officers transported him to the 5th District station. \n56.  He was approved for citation release and he was released on citation.  \n57.  The OAG โno-paperedโ his case. \nMr. Alexanderโ arrest illustrates how the incommoding statute is unconstitutional vague and how \nthe MPD enforce it mainly against African Americans in arbitrary and discriminatory manner \n58.  Mr. Alexanderโ arrest and prosecution pursuant to the incommoding statute illustrates how \nthe statute is unconstitutional vague and how the MPD enforce it mainly against African Americans \nin arbitrary and discriminatory manner. \n   PAGE 15 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 16 of 45\n59.  First, he is African American. \n60.  Next, he was not โcrowding, obstructing, or incommodingโ anyoneโs passage on the \nsidewalk. Rather, he was using the sidewalk as intended. \n61.  He was in an alley off the sidewalk against the wall. \n62.  He had no intention to block โ fully or even partially - anyone elseโs use of the sidewalk.  \n63.  Nor did he. \n64.  His arrest illustrates that the MPD apply the statute even to someone standing alone or \nwith one or two or a few other people on the sidewalk even when there is plenty of room on the \nsidewalk for other people to get by or walk around on the sidewalk. \n65.  Instead of simply instructing Mr. Alexander to โcease the crowding, obstructing, or \nincommodingโ as the statute provides Officer Onoja instead issued a โdispersal orderโ or โmove \non orderโ and ordered Mr. Alexander to leave the area. \n66.  The practice of Officer Onoja in this case and the practice of other MPD officers is to treat \nthe โcease the crowding, obstructing, or incommodingโ prong as authority to issue โmove onโ or \nโdispersalโ orders and the practice of the MPD is the order persons to leave the area, not just \nโโcease the crowding, obstructing, or incommoding.โ \n67.  The OAG takes the position that the โcease the crowding, obstructing, or incommodingโ \nprong authorizes an officer to order a person to leave the area. The OAG contends that the \noperative element of the offense is โa person must have disregarded a law enforcement officerโs \ninstruction to move.โ \n   PAGE 16 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 17 of 45\n68.  Next, at the point he was arrested he was by himself and he was not engaging in conduct \nwhich interfered with other pedestriansโ free passage on the sidewalk. He had left the area and he \nwas walking back down Bladensburg Road.  \n69.  In fact, as he came walking down the street three MPD officers were standing right in the \nmiddle of the sidewalk and he was able to walk past them. \n70.  The statute did not give him reasonable notice that his conduct was in violation of the \nstatute. The statute informs people to โcease crowding, obstructing, or incommodingโ when \ninstructed to do so by a law enforcement officer and that is exactly what he did. \nThe text of the incommoding statute as amended in 2011 \n71.  The D.C. Council made revisions to the incommoding statute in 2010 which became \neffective in 2011. \n72.  The previous version of ยง 22-1307 provided,  \nIt shall not be lawful for any person or persons within the District of Columbia to \ncongregate and assemble in any street . . . or any park or reservation . . . and engage \nin loud and boisterous talking or other disorderly conduct, or to insult or make \nrude or obscene gestures or comments or observations on persons passing by, or in \ntheir hearing, or to crowd, obstruct, or incommode the free use of such street . . . .  \n \n73.  The District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals had glossed a breach of the peace mens \nrea requirement into the previous version of the statute in 1969 to prevent punishment of persons \nwho innocently obstructed use of a sidewalk by congregating on it. Adams v. United States, 256 \nA.2d 563, 564-565 (D.C. 1969).  \n   PAGE 17 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 18 of 45\n74.  The D.C. Council made five major changes to the statute which rendered it \nunconstitutionally vague under the second prong of the vagueness doctrine: (1) the Council \neliminated any scienter element by consciously deciding not to include the โbreach of peaceโ \nscienter element which the Court of Appeals had added by gloss to the previous version of the \nstatute to make the statute Constitutional or any other scienter element; (2) the Council eliminated \nthe โassemblyโ element of the statute by reducing the number of people required for a violation \nfrom three to one, thereby greatly expanding the type of innocent conduct subject to the statute \nand also thereby eliminating any common law mens rea requirement imported into the statute \nfrom the common law offense of unlawful assembly; (3) the Council retained the terms โcrowd,โ \nโobstruct,โ and โincommodeโ without providing any definitions or limiting criteria in the \nincommoding statute; (4) the Council refused to replace these vague and archaic terms with a \nclearly understood term such as โblock passage;โ and (5) the Council substituted a โdispersal \norderโ or โmove on orderโ for the mens rea requirement (while rejecting any narrowing \nqualifications such as duration qualifications on the dispersal order). \n75.  In pertinent part, the โincommodingโ statute as amended in 2011 reads: \nIt is unlawful, alone or in concert with others, to [A] crowd, obstruct, or \nincommode [1] the use of any street, avenue, alley, road, highway, or sidewalk, or \n[2] the entrance of any public or private building or enclosure or [3] the use of or \npassage through any public conveyance, and [B] to continue or resume the \ncrowding, obstructing, or incommoding after being instructed by a law enforcement \nofficer to cease the crowding, obstructing, or incommoding. \nD.C. Code ยง 22-1307(a) (D.C. 2014). \n   PAGE 18 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 19 of 45\n76.  As enacted the statute can be enforced against a single person acting alone even when that \npersonโs conduct did not interfere with other pedestriansโ free passage on the sidewalk, and even \nwhen no one else is on the sidewalk. \n77.  The MPD frequently arrests or orders to โmove onโ a single person on the sidewalk even \nwhen no one else is around. Arrests of Mr. Bey, Mr. Agnew, Mr. Dennis, and Ms. Williamspn, all \ndescribed below. \n78.  In fact, on occasion the MPD arrests people or orders them to leave for crowding, \nobstructing, or incommoding even when they are not even on the sidewalk but next to it. Arrest of \nMr. Bey, described below.  \n79.  And the statute does not have any appropriate mens rea requirement. \nThe Council Received Warnings Before and After Enacting the Revised Incommoding Statute \nThat Could Be and In Fact Was Being Used As A Loitering Statute but the Council Enacted the \nStatute Anyway and The Counsel has Taken No Steps to Correct It \nThe D.C. Council enacted the unconstitutional incommoding statute in its current form despite \nbeing advised not to by the Council for Court Excellence, the ACLU, the US Attorney, and the \nMPD, and the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless   \n80.  The incommoding statute is one of the many โquality of lifeโ statutes that Officer Onoja \nand other officers of the MPD use and have used to clear the streets of persons they consider \nundesirables. \n81.  In 2010, the Council for Court Excellence (CCE) (acting with the ACLU, the US Attorney, \nthe OAG, the MPD, and other concerned groups, issued a report entitled, โRevising the District of \n   PAGE 19 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V.

At that time โincommodingโ was part of the disorderly conduct statute. D.C. Code ยง 22-\n1307. \n83.  The CCE report contained proposed legislation that prohibited โblockingโ but not \nโincommoding,โ โobstructingโ or โcrowdingโ because the CCE report concluded that the then-\nexisting lawโs prohibition on โcrowdingโ was deemed to be too vague, and because the CCE \nrecognized the dangers in drafting the statute so broadly that it could be used as an anti-loitering \nstatute. \n84.  But, the D.C. Office of the Attorney General, MPD, and the U.S. Attorneyโs Office \ndissented from the CCE proposed legislation, in part, because they believed that โblockingโ was \nlikely to be construed more narrowly than โcrowding, obstructing, or incommoding.โ \n85.   However, the dissenters still recognized the danger that a law prohibiting crowding, \nobstructing, or incommoding the free use of sidewalks and entrances could be used as a subterfuge \nfor an unconstitutional loitering law.   \n86.  So, the MPD and OAG and the United States Attorneyโs Office proposed language for \nโblockingโ sidewalks which included a mens rea element and a โstop blockingโ order.  \n87.  The ACLU also warned the Council that the proposed language for โblockingโ sidewalks \nshould include a mens rea element as well as a โstop blockingโ order. \n88.  The Model Penal Code version of an \"obstructing the sidewalk\" statute has a \"purposely or \nrecklessly\" mens rea requirement, but a person commits a misdemeanor only if they โpersistโ after \n   PAGE 20 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 21 of 45\na law enforcement officerโs warning. Model Penal Code ยง 250.7. The Model Penal Code does not \nhave a \"move on\" element except for โgatherings.โ Id. ยง 250.7.  \n89.  The D.C. Council subsequently took up consideration of the โDisorderly Conduct \nAmendment Act of 2010,โ Bill 18-425.  \n90.  The Council received written testimony about this bill from Ann Marie Staudenmaier, a \nstaff attorney at the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless, who testified that police told \nโmanyโ individuals to โmove alongโ rather than to โstop blockingโ in situations which could not \npossibly be interpreted as incommoding.  \n91.  Despite the concerns raised by the CCE report and the Washington Legal Clinic for the \nHomeless, and the suggestions of the MPD and OAG and the United States Attorneyโs Office, the \nCouncil enacted D.C. Code ยง 22-1307 with language that prohibits โcrowd[ing], obstruct[ing], or \nincommod[ing]โ and made the statute applicable to one personโs conduct instead of three persons \nas the previous version had. \n92.  Also, the Council disregarded the advice of OAG, MPD, and the United States Attorneyโs \nOffice and ACLU and deleted any โscienterโ element such as requiring that the conduct \nprohibited by the statute be committed โintentionallyโ or โrecklessly.โ   \n93.  The District thus was on notice, as a result of the CCE report and testimony from the \nWashington Legal Clinic for the Homeless, and their proposals and (the MPD and OAGโs) and \nthe United States Attorneyโs Officeโs, and the ACLUโs and the history of unfounded arrests for \noffenses such as disorderly conduct and POCA that the statute had the potential to be abused, and \nthat its administration should be carefully monitored and officers needed training and constant \nreinforcement training.  \n   PAGE 21 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 22 of 45\nProblems with the statute became apparent to the District shortly after it became effective and put \nthe District on notice that the statute is vague and that it encourages arbitrary and discriminatory \nenforcement \n94.  Shortly after the amendments became effective the D.C. Council learned that the \nincommoding statute was being enforced in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner. \n95.  It was being used as a loitering statute because it was being used against a single person \nacting alone even when that personโs conduct did not interfere with other pedestriansโ free passage \non the sidewalk. \n96.  The D.C. Council held hearings to investigate the problem. \n97.  Moreover, in a letter to then-Attorney General Irv Nathan, Council Member Mary Cheh \ninformed the Council that that the MPD were enforcing the incommoding statute in an arbitrary \nand discriminatory manner.  \n98.  Council Member Mary Cheh recognized that the dispersal / move-on element meant giving \npolice the right to banish anyone from a public space whenever they wanted. \n99.  But, the D.C. Council did not take any steps to amend the statute to fix the problem of \narbitrary and discriminatory enforcement caused by the vagueness described herein. \nWitnesses told the Council in hearings that the newly amended statute was being enforced against \na single person who was not blocking passage on the sidewalks but the Council decided not to \namend the language of the statute \n   PAGE 22 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 23 of 45\n100.  For example, in 2011, Bill Hassay, Jr., a solo musician performing at the corner of \nWisconsin and M St., NW, was threatened by an MPD police officer with arrest for blocking a \nsidewalk. The officer told Mr. Hassay that โpedestrians need the full widthโ of the sidewalk. \n101.  Following the incident involving Hassay, the ACLU pointed out to high-ranking officials at \nMPD Headquarters and Second District that the officer had misinterpreted the law.  \n102.  The incident involving Hassay and the communication from the ACLU put the District on \nnotice that without proper training and supervision, officers could and would apply the statute in a \nway that violated citizensโ rights.  \n103.  On February 1, 2012, the D.C. Council, Committee on the Judiciary, held a hearing \nregarding the 2011 revisions to the disorderly conduct statute and heard testimony from the ACLU \non the Hassay incident.  \n104.  ACLU testimony again put the District on notice that without proper training and \nsupervision, officers could and would apply the statute in a way that violated citizensโ rights. By \nreferring to the problems reported from homeless advocates, Mr. Mulhauser put the District on \nnotice that the incident involving Hassay was not an isolated or one-time problem.  \n105.  Kelly OโMeara, Director of the Office of Strategic Change, MPD also testified at the \nFebruary 1, 2012 hearing. Ms. OโMeara testified that after the enactment of the changes to the \nDistrictโs disorderly conduct law, MPD developed a written directive explaining the law and an \nonline training session that could be delivered to all members of the MPD. All members were \nrequired to certify that they had reviewed the directive and taken and passed the online training.  \n   PAGE 23 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 24 of 45\n106.  However, neither the written directive nor the online training session addressed the issue of \nwhether partial blocking was sufficient to justify an arrest, nor covered using the incommoding \nstatute as a way for the MPD to control the streets without supervision of prosecutors or the courts.  \n107.  Councilmember Mendelson explained to the MPD that disorderly conduct offenses can be \neasily misunderstood and suggested that training may be as important, or more important, than the \nclarity that the Council thought it brought to the law. He pointed out that an intensive refresher \ntraining may be needed, not doing it once. Councilmember Mendelson asked Ms. OโMeara to get \nback to him on what MPD will do on intensive refresher training and how often. \n108.  When asked by Councilmember Mendelson about ACLUโs proposed amendment to the \ndisorderly conduct statute, Ms. OโMeara noted that the issue was discussed at length by the \nCouncil for Court Excellence and that the term โincommodingโ was added to ensure the statute \nreached more than โfull blocking,โ such as situations where an individual was controlling the entire \nspace. \nPolice Complaints Board Releases Report on MPDโs Enforcement of Blocking Passage Law \n109.  More recently, on May 22, 2017, the District of Columbiaโs Police Complaints Board \n(PCB), the governing body of the Office of Police Complaints (OPC), issued a report to Mayor \nMuriel Bowser, the Council of the District of Columbia and Metropolitan Police Department \n(MPD) Chief Peter Newsham regarding concerns about MPDโs enforcement of the โBlocking \nPassageโ law. \n110.  Since passage of the law, OPC has received 14 complaints alleging officers have improperly \nissued individuals โmove alongโ orders for blocking passage or citations. Several of these \n   PAGE 24 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 25 of 45\ncomplaints have led to sustained allegations against MPD officers. There are also complaints \ncurrently under investigation with OPC that involve blocking passage allegations. \n111.  In addition, OPC noticed that a majority of the individuals who filed a complaint with the \nagency belong to a specific racial group (African Americans) and some identified as homeless.  \n112.  The PCB is concerned that MPD officers use of the Blocking Passage statute is \ndisproportionally discriminating against these specific groups of people. \n113.  One example happened when the complainant left the Congress Heights metro station and \nwalked towards her car where she met up with her children. The complainant and her children \nwere standing on the sidewalk on 13th Street, S.E., near Alabama Avenue, when the subject officer \nyelled at them to โGet off the sidewalk!โ twice, and then said, โIโm going to leave and come back, if \nyouโre still over there, itโll be a problem.โ The subject officer then left, returned, and continued \nyelling, โI said, get off the sidewalk!โ As the complainant and her children walked away, the subject \nofficer followed them, โyellingโ at them as they walked down the street. \n114.  The OPC conducted a complete investigation of the complaint, and issued a Report of \nInvestigation (ROI) finding that the officer improperly harassed the complainant when he \nrepeatedly instructed the complainant and her children to โ[g]et off the sidewalkโ and then \nfollowed them down the street, among other allegations in the original complaint.  \n115.  This finding was partially based on statements from the subject and witness officer, who \nsaid that in general, they approach people who are standing still on the sidewalk in order to warn \nor cite them for blocking passage, regardless of the number of persons and regardless of whether \nthey are presenting an obstacle to pedestrian traffic. The subject officer also stated that he had \nmade โnumerousโ arrests for blocking passage. The allegation of harassment was sustained in a \n   PAGE 25 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 26 of 45\nmerits determination by a Complaint Examiner, finding that there was no evidence that the \ncomplainant had actually been blocking passage, when in fact she was merely standing on the \nsidewalk talking to her children. \n116.  In another case, an MPD Officer observed two complainants on the sidewalk in front of \nthe home where they resided. One complainant was holding onto the fence that surrounded his \nhome, and the other complainant was leaning against his car parked on the street in front of his \nhome. The subject officer used the loudspeaker of his MPD vehicle to tell the complainants to \nleave the premises. The complainants separately shouted back that they lived there. The subject \nofficer then exited his vehicle and told the complainants to move along and that they were blocking \npassage. The complainants refused, and the subject officer issued them both separate 61D \ncitations. When the complainant asked why they were receiving citations the subject officer said โI \ncan do what I want and write what I want on the ticket.โ  \n117.  The OPC also conducted a complete investigation of this complaint, and issued a ROI \nfinding that the officer improperly harassed the complainants when he ordered them to โmove \nalongโ and by unlawfully issuing 61D citations for โblocking passage.โ \nThe MPD and the Prosecutors Have Enforced the Statute as a General Loitering Statute and the \nDistrict Knew or Should Have Known of the Practice and the District Acquiesced in the Practice \nThe Incommoding Statute is employed especially against African Americans in neighborhoods \nsuch as the Trinidad area and the H Street โ Bladensburg Road area \n118.  The incommoding statute is employed especially against young African American men in \nthe community most frequently in and near areas such as the Trinidad area, โWhere the Sidewalk \n   PAGE 26 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V.

These areas are in the process of gentrification and both the area and the streets there are \nbeing cleared of the traditionally African American residents. \nOne detective in Detective the 5th District explains the MPDโs philosophy of quality of life policing \n120.  On January 13, 2016 about 8:00 pm Mr. Junes, a long-time resident of the Bladensburg \nRoad area, was riding his bicycle through the alley behind Roses Liquor at 830 Bladensburg Road, \nNE, Washington, DC. when he stopped to fix his gloves and his bike. \n121.  Officer Onoja sprayed pepper spray in Mr. Junesโ face and arrested him for POCA under \nD.C. Code ยง 25-1001(a) (possession of an open container of alcohol) and Mr. Junes was \ntransported to the station. \n122.  After arriving at the station Mr. Junes was taken into an interview room where a Detective \nexplained the MPDโs current philosophy of quality of life policing to Mr. Junes during a video-\ntaped re-education session. \n123.  The Detective explained to Mr. Junes that the neighborhood around Starburst Plaza (at the \nintersection of H street and Bladensburg Road, NE) and the โBladensburg Road corridorโ is \nchanging with homes now worth up to $600,000.  \n124.  The Detective explained to Mr. Junes that 5th District officers believe that undesirables \ncongregate at Starburst Plaza so the police heavily patrol the area. \n   PAGE 27 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 28 of 45\n125.  So the police now take a zero tolerance approach to quality of life crimes because they \ndepress property values. \n126.  The detective explained that when the police went to Starburst Plaza they did not \ndiscriminate between the bad and the good people and the police just make the long-time residents \nleave or disperse or arrest them them because congregating is bad for the community. \n127.  The Detective told Mr. Junes that the neighborhood is changing and people have to act in \na more civilized way.  \n128.  The Detective told Mr. Junes that the City has big plans for the neighborhood. \nArrest of Young African American Man in Starburst Intersection Plaza \n129.  The Starburst Intersection Plaza is a broad plaza with broad walkways and the District \ninstalled benches and chess tables and chairs and other furniture which invite people to sit and \nspend time in the park. \n \n   PAGE 28 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 29 of 45\n130.  Figure 4 is Starburst Plaza is at the intersection of H Street, NE and Bladensburg Road, NE \nWashington, DC 20002.  \n131.  It is administered by the District of Columbia Department of Transportation so there is no \ncurfew. \n132.  On about 9/4/2014 several African American men were in the Starburst Intersection Plaza \nat 1550 Maryland Ave NE, Washington, DC 20002 during normal park hours at night using it as \nthe District intended by sitting down and chatting. \n133.  Many other people were enjoying the park as invited, some sitting down and others \nwalking. \n134.  There is a late-night bus stop at one end of the park which serves several bus lines.  \n135.  The young men were sitting at the edge of a broad walkway. They were not blocking the \npassage of anyone. \n136.  Suddenly several carloads of MPD officers stormed into the park like an occupying army \nand ordered everyone to leave even though by law the park was open. \n137.  The police were successful in clearing the park of people they deemed undesirables โ \nalmost. \n138.  All but one of the young men left. \n139.  That one young man protested and exercised his First Amendment rights to complain to a \npolice officer about his treatment. \n140.  The MPD arrested him for incommoding. \n141.  The OAG prosecuted him for incommoding in a bench trial but he was acquitted by the \nCourt on a defense motion for judgment of acquittal.  \n   PAGE 29 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 30 of 45\nMr. Bugg Beyโs Arrest by Officer Onoja  \n142.  On about Friday, May 9, 2014 between 3 and 5 pm Mr. Bugg Bey was leaning against a \nfence in front of 1607 Levis Street, NE, with the permission of the owner in the Trinidad area \nchatting with about eight other friends and neighbors. \n143.  The fence was on a strip of private property between the sidewalk and the fence in the yard \nof the house. \n144.  Officer Onoja, the arresting officer, knew before he arrested Mr. Bugg Bey that that strip of \ngrass in the yard between the sidewalk and the fence is private property. \n145.  None of the group was standing in the sidewalk. \n146.  None of the group was blocking passage along the sidewalk and no pedestrians were trying \nto walk along the sidewalk at this time. \n147.  But, had any pedestrians happened along, Mr. Bugg Bey and his friends would have gladly \nmade way for them to pass if needed. \n148.  According to Mr. Bugg Bey, Officer Onoja โpretty much -- he told us that we had to leave \nfrom where we was at. That we had to move.โ  \n149.  The group did leave. \n150.  About an hour later Officer Onoja and Officer Slopac returned and saw Mr. Bugg Bey and \ntwo or three members of the group again chatting in basically the same place. \n151.  Officer Onoja immediately arrested Mr. Bugg Bey for โblocking passageโ under D.C. \nCode ยง 22-1307 as soon as he saw him. \n152.  Mr. Bugg Bey was transported to the 5th District station and to Central Cellblock where he \nwas held overnight.  \n   PAGE 30 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V.

The next morning Mr. Bugg Bey was presented in Superior Court but he was released \nbecause his case was โno-papered.โ  \nMr. Agnewโs Arrest on Christmas Eve \n154.  Mr. Agnew was arrested on Christmas Eve when he and the mother of his child and a \nfriend were enjoying the evening air on the stoop of his childโs motherโs building at 3146 Buena \nVista Terrace, SE in Washington, DC. \n155.   \n156.  But, the way was clear for pedestrians to come and go around them and many people were \nin fact coming and going around them because it was Christmas Eve.    \n157.  Suddenly the pleasant scene was shattered when Officer Vincent Norris rolled up in his \npolice cruiser and in a furious manner yelled at Mr. Agnew and the others to leave. \n   PAGE 31 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 32 of 45\n158.  Officer Norris is known to have arrested several other young African American men in the \narea for incommoding. \n159.  Mr. Agnew explained that they were simply taking the air and smoking outside because his \ndaughter had asthma and he did not smoke around her. \n160.  He explained that the mother lived there and they had every right to be there.   \n161.  Enraged, Officer Norris screamed at Mr. Agnew and the others to leave because, as he \nsaid, they were โblocking passage.โ \n162.  The police report in Mr. Agnewโs case which Officer Norrisโ partner authored has the \nsame operative language as the Gerstein in Mr. Dennisโs case (below) which Officer Norris also \nauthored, namely, โBoth of the males were standing in a manner that would cause a citizen or \ncitizens trying to utilize the walkway to deviate from their path of walking.โ \n163.  Officer Norrisโ partner then arrested Mr. Agnew for incommoding. \n164.  Mr. Agnew spent the night and jail and after a few court appearances the government \ndismissed his case. \nMr. Dennisโ Arrest on Thanksgiving Eve \n165.  Mr. Dennis was arrested on Thanksgiving Eve, 11/26/2014, when and his family were \npreparing their Thanksgiving celebration on Thanksgiving Eve, at their home at 3130 Buena Vista \nTerrace, SE in Washington, DC.  \n166.  Mr. Dennis had stepped outside for a moment and he was standing in the yard on a ramp a \nfew feet in front of the porch to his apartment building getting a breath of evening air, taking a \nbreak from the cooking. \n   PAGE 32 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 33 of 45\n167.   \n168.  The way on the ramp was clear for pedestrians to come and go. \n169.  No one was trying to come up the ramp.  \n170.  If someone had come by, Mr. Dennis would have moved.  \n171.  The police report does not mention anyone who could not get past him.    \n172.  That holiday spirit vanished when Officer Vincent Norris rolled up in his police cruiser \nand in a furious manner yelled at Mr. Dennis and another man to leave. \n173.  Mr. Dennis refused to move because, as he explained, he was simply standing in front of \nhis home.  \n   PAGE 33 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 34 of 45\n174.  The ramp is wide enough to allow two or three people to walk on it. \n175.   โHow can you tell me to move from the place where I live at?โ Mr. Dennis asked Officer \nNorris. \n176.  Because the statute vests unlimited discretion in law enforcement officers to determine \nwhether a person on the sidewalk or in a doorway is โcrowding, obstructing, or incommodingโ and \nOfficer Norris exercised his discretion to classify Mr. Dennis as โcrowding, obstructing, or \nincommodingโ.  \n177.  When Mr. Dennis refused to move, Officer Norris arrested him and put him into a van.  \n178.  The Gerstein in Mr. Dennisโs case authored by Officer Norris has the same operative \nlanguage as the police report in Mr. Agnewโs case which Officer Norrisโ partner authored, namely, \nโBoth of the males were standing in a manner that would cause a citizen or citizens trying to utilize \nthe walkway to deviate from their path of walking.โ \n179.  Mr. Dennis spent the night and jail and after a few court appearances the government \ndismissed his case. \nMs. Williamsonโs Arrest \n180.  Ms. Williamsonโs contact with MPD began about 3:50 pm on 2/4/2015 on a commercial \nstreet at 2403 Martin Luther King, Jr. Ave., S.E.  \n181.  Officer Richardo Amos told Ms. Williamson to move from where she was standing on the \nsidewalk at 2403 Martin Luther King, Jr. Ave., S.E. because, as his police report reads, he \nobserved her standing in front of the location โdisrupting the smooth flow of pedestrian traffic.โ \n   PAGE 34 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V.

Officer Amosโ report does not state that he observed any people at all who were present at \nthe location when he observed Ms. Williamson. \n184.  Ms. Williamson was standing on the sidewalk and walking on the sidewalk when she was \nobserved by Officer Amos. \n185.  The way was clear for pedestrians to come and go. \n186.  No one was trying to walk on the sidewalk where Ms. Williamson was. \n187.  She was not blocking the passage or even obstructing it.  \n188.  If someone had come by, Ms. Williamson would have moved as needed.  \n189.  The police report does not mention anyone who could not get past her during his initial \nencounter with her.    \n190.  Officer Amos ordered Ms. Williamson to leave about 3:30 pm. \n191.  Ms. Williamson continued walking and standing in the area but always allowing other \npeople enjoying the area with her to have free passage on the sidewalk.  \n   PAGE 35 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V.

Officer Amos came back about half an hour later arrested Ms. Williamson because, as his \nreport states, โhe observed pedestrians having to maneuver around her to get by on the sidewalk, \nand because merchants were complaining about her in the area.โ  \n193.  Ms. Williamson tried explained to Officer Amos why she was doing nothing wrong and did \nnot have to leave. \n194.  Because the statute vests unlimited discretion in law enforcement officers to determine \nwhether a person on the sidewalk or in a doorway is โcrowding, obstructing, or incommodingโ and \nOfficer Amos exercised his discretion to classify Ms. Williamson as โcrowding, obstructing, or \nincommodingโ the statute applied to Ms. Williamson.  \n195.  Officer Amos arrested her for crowding, obstructing, or incommoding. Ms. Williamson \nspent the night and jail and after a few court appearances the government dismissed his case. \nDefendant Onoja is an open and notorious violator of civil rights. \n196.  Defendant Onoja is an open and notorious violator of civil rights of the people in the \nDistrict of Columbia whom he polices. \n197.  His arrest of Mr. Alexander in this case, and Mr. Bey, are typical of the arrests that he \nmakes and made for crowding, obstructing, or incommoding and other MPD officers make and \nmade for crowding, obstructing, or incommoding. \n198.  Officer Onoja has arrested several other young African American men and juveniles in the \narea.  \n199.

The incommoding statute purports to criminalize conduct when it results in โcrowding, \nobstructing, or incommodingโ the sidewalk or entrances to public or private buildings, and the \nperson refuses to move on when so ordered. D.C. Code ยง 22-1307(a).  \n202.  Defendant Onoja used the statute to clear the sidewalks in his patrol area of young African \nAmerican men who have done nothing wrong. \n203.  Officer Onoja makes most of his arrests on the ยผ mile strip of Bladensburg Rd NE, \nWashington, DC 20002 starting from the intersection of H Street, NE and Bladensburg Rd, NE. \n204.  This area has been a hot bed of gentrification in the last ten years. \n205.  It appears that Officer Onoja is motivated at least in part in assisting developers wishing to \nexclude long-time residents from the area. \n206.  Officer Onoja has assaulted and trumped up charges against other people in the area and \ntrumped up false charges against other people in the area on quality of life charges such as POCA \nand incommoding (23 D.C. Code ยง 1307) to clear the areaโs long-time residents from the area as \npart of the gentrification process.  \nThe MPD has not meaningfully disciplined Defendant Onoja.  \n207.  The MPD has not disciplined Defendant Onoja by placing him into non-contact status. \n208.  Nor has the District meaningfully disciplined Defendant Onoja in any other way. \nSubstantive Allegations for Claims \n   PAGE 37 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 38 of 45\nClaim 1  \nยง 1983 Liability of the District of Columbia and Officer Onoja for false arrest under the Fourth \nAmendment \n209.  Mr. Alexander adopts by reference the contents of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set \nforth herein. \n210.  Officer Onoja violated Mr. Alexanderโs Fourth Amendment rights by arresting him for \nincommoding without probable cause pursuant to a policy and practice of the District of using the \nincommoding statute to clear the sidewalks of young African American men by arresting them for \nincommoding without probable cause. \n211.  The District of Columbia is also liable because the District of Columbia has a policy and \npractice of encouraging and acquiescing in its officersโ using the incommoding statute to clear the \nsidewalks of African Americas by arresting them for crowding, obstructing, or incommoding \nwithout probable cause, and because MPD officers approach African American who are standing \nstill on the sidewalk in order to warn or cite them for blocking passage, regardless of the number of \npersons and regardless of whether they are presenting an obstacle to pedestrian traffic. \n212.  Accordingly, Mr. Alexander and the other members of the Arrest Class are entitled to \ndamages and other relief as set forth below. \nClaim 2  \nยง 1983 Liability of District of Columbia under the Fifth Amendment for unlawful arrests for \narbitrary and discriminatory enforcement \n   PAGE 38 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 39 of 45\n213.  Mr. Alexander adopts by reference the contents of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set \nforth herein. \n214.  The D.C. Council amended the incommoding statute effective 2011. \n215.  The incommoding statute is vague under the second prong of the vagueness doctrine, the \narbitrary and discriminatory enforcement prong. \n216.  The statute authorizes and even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  \n217.  The D.C. Council established minimal guidelines in the statute to govern law enforcement  \nand thus the D.C. Council necessarily entrusted lawmaking to the moment-to-moment judgment of \nthe policeman on his beat. \n218.  The MPD enforce it mainly against African Americans. \n219.  Mr. Alexander and the other members of the Arrest Class were arrested when the District \nenforced the unconstitutional incommoding statute against them by arresting them. \n220.  Accordingly, Mr. Alexander and the other members of the Arrest Class are entitled to \ndamages and other relief as set forth below. \nClaim 3  \nยง 1983 Liability of District of Columbia under the Fifth Amendment for unlawful arrests for lack \nof notice \n221.  Mr. Alexander adopts by reference the contents of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set \nforth herein. \n222.  The incommoding statute is vague under the first prong of the vagueness doctrine, the \narbitrary and discriminatory enforcement prong. \n   PAGE 39 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 40 of 45\n223.  The statute fails to place reasonable individuals on notice as to what type of conduct \nconstitutes โcrowding, obstructing, or incommodingโ under the statute or what individuals must do \nto comply with a โcease crowding, obstructing, or incommodingโ warning under the statute. \n224.  For example, the statute fails to place reasonable individuals on notice as to whether they \nmust merely โcease crowding, obstructing, or incommodingโ or whether they must leave the area, \nand if so, how far must they go, and how long must they remain away.   \n225.  The MPD enforce it mainly against African Americans. \n226.  Mr. Alexander and the other members of the Arrest Class were arrested when the District \nenforced the unconstitutional incommoding statute against them by arresting them. \n227.  Accordingly, the Named Plaintiffs and the other members of the Arrest Class are entitled \nto damages and other relief as set forth below. \nClaim 4 \nยง 1983 Liability of District of Columbia under the Fourth and Fifth Amendment for unlawful \nprosecutions \n228.  Mr. Alexander adopts by reference the contents of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set \nforth herein. \n229.  The incommoding statute is unconstitutional under the second prong of the vagueness \ndoctrine, the arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement prong, in violation of the Fifth Amendment \nbut still the District through its Attorney Generalโs Office prosecuted Mr. Alexander and the other \nmembers of the Prosecution Class under the incommoding statute. \n230.  The prosecutions are without probable cause because the arrests lack probable cause. \n   PAGE 40 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 41 of 45\n231.  Accordingly, Mr. Alexander and the other members of the Prosecution Class are entitled \nto damages and other relief as set forth below.   \nRule 23 Class Allegations \n232.  Mr. Alexander on behalf of himself and the Arrest Class brings this action under Rules \n23(a), 23(b) (2) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of a class consisting \nof each person who: (i) during the Class Period in the period beginning three years before the date \nof filing of the original complaint in this case and going forward until the case is terminated; (ii) was \narrested for  violation of the incommoding statute. \n233.  Mr. Alexander on behalf of himself and the other members of the Prosecution Class brings \nthis action under Rules 23(a), 23(b) (2) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on \nbehalf of a class consisting of each person who: (i) in the period beginning three years before the \ndate of filing of the original complaint in this case and going forward until the case is terminated; \n(ii) was prosecuted for a violation of the incommoding statute by the Attorney General of the \nDistrict of Columbia or with his consent. \n234.  Certification of these classes under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is appropriate, \nbecause the District of Columbia has a policy, pattern, and practice for each claim that has \nuniformly affected all members the class, and injunctive relief and declaratory judgment and a \njudgment against the District will benefit each and every plaintiff and class member. \n235.  The classes are entitled to injunctive relief including an injunction prohibiting enforcement \nof the incommoding statute and sealing of the arrest records of class members for their arrests \nunder the incommoding statute. \n   PAGE 41 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 42 of 45\n236.  Mr. Alexander and the classes are entitled to declaratory judgment against the District that \nD.C. Code ยง 22-1307 is unconstitutional and that their arrests and prosecutions on those charges \nare a nullity. \n237.  Certification of these classes under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is also \nappropriate, in that common questions of law and fact predominate over any individual questions, \nand class action treatment is superior for the fair and efficient adjudication of these class claims as \ndetailed below.  \n238.  These classes are entitled to monetary relief. \n239.  Regarding Mr. Alexander and these classes, there are no individual questions on the issue \nof liability, because all members of these classes are injured by the same policy and practices. \n240.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the classes are: \na)  whether the incommoding statute D.C. Code ยง 22-1307 is unconstitutional because \nit violates the first prong of the vagueness doctrine under the Fifth Amendment, the failure \nto provide notice prong; \nb)  whether the incommoding statute D.C. Code ยง 22-1307 is unconstitutional because \nit violates the second prong of the vagueness doctrine under the Fifth Amendment, the \narbitrary and discriminatory enforcement prong; \nc)  whether the District of Columbia violates the Fifth Amendment by enforcing its \nincommoding statute in an arbitrary and discriminatory almost exclusively (outside the \nprotestor context) against African Americans; \nd)  Whether Mr. Alexander and the members of the classes and future members are \nentitled to equitable relief, and, if so, what is the nature of that relief. \n   PAGE 42 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 43 of 45\n241.  Each of the Arrest Class and the Prosecution Class is so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers is impracticable.  The exact number of the members Arrest Class and the Prosecution \nClass members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time but the number of persons who were arrested, \nprosecuted or who โposted and forfeitedโ for incommoding each year through 2016 numbers at \nleast 50. \n242.  Mr. Alexanderโs arrest claims are typical of the claims of the other members of the Arrest \nClass, because Mr. Alexander and all other members of the Arrest Class were injured by exactly \nthe same means, unconstitutionality of the incommoding statute. \n243.  Mr. Alexander on behalf of himself and the other members of the Arrest Class and the \nProsecution Class will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the members of the Classes and \nthey have retained counsel who are competent and experienced in complex federal civil rights class \naction litigation. \n244.  Mr. Alexander on behalf of himself and the Arrest Class and the Prosecution Class has no \ninterests that are contrary to or in conflict with those of the Classes. \nClass Relief Demands \nMr. Alexander on behalf of themselves and all other members of the Arrest Class and the \nProsecution Class respectfully request that this Court grant the following relief: \nA.  Enter judgment in their favor on all of their claims; \nB.  Declare the incommoding statute under D.C. Code ยง 22-1307 unconstitutionally \nvague under the Fifth Amendment and enjoin the District from implementing any provision of \nD.C. Code ยง 22-1307.  \n   PAGE 43 OF 45 \nCOMPLAINT โข ALEXANDER V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01885   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 44 of 45\nC.  Award Mr. Alexander and the putative class membersโ nominal damages in \nconnection with any declaration that D.C. Code ยง 22-1307 is unconstitutional or applied \nunconstitutionally. \nD.  Grant a jury trial on all claims so triable. \nE.  Declare that this action may be maintained as a class action pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) and Rule 23(b)(3) and certifying the Arrest Class and the \nProsecution Class, and designating Mr. Alexander  as the proper representatives of the Arrest \nClass, and designating Mr. Alexander as the proper representatives of the Prosecution Class, and \nappointing William Claiborne and Michael Bruckheim and Lynn Cunningham as class counsel of \nboth classes. \nF.  Declare that this action may be maintained as a class action pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23(a), 23(b) (2) and 23(b)(3).  \nG.  Award all the Arrest Class and the Prosecution Class plaintiffs and class \nmembers injunctive relief in the form of sealing their arrest records for incommoding and \ndeclaring the arrests a nullity; \nH.  Award all plaintiffs and class members compensatory and consequential \ndamages in an amount to be determined at trial; \nI.  Award plaintiffs attorneys' fees and costs incurred in bringing this action under \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 or as determined under the โcommon fundโ rule; and \nJ.
