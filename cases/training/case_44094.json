Three Black individuals who were stopped and frisked by the GRU brought a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on April 30, 2020. They sued the District of Columbia under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs alleged that the GRU violated the Fourth Amendment by stopping, frisking, arresting, and detaining individuals without reasonable suspicion or probable cause; fabricated facts to retroactively justify reasonable suspicion; and specifically targeted Black individuals for searches in violation of the Fifth Amendment&rsquo;s Equal Protection provision. The plaintiffs requested damages for injuries suffered by the named plaintiffs and members of the class, injunctive and declaratory relief, and attorneys&rsquo; fees. The case was assigned to District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on September 30, 2020, which added a fourth named plaintiff and alleged that the defendant failed to adequately screen, train, supervise, and discipline MPD officers. The amended complaint also added nine individual MPD officers as defendants (in their individual and official capacities) and requested punitive damages from each of them.</p>\r\n<p>On November 16, 2020, the District of Columbia moved to dismiss the amended complaint.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Chutkan denied the District of Columbia's motion to dismiss on March 29, 2023. The court held that the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that the GRU officers acted with racially discriminatory intent and lacked the requisite reasonable suspicion to stop and search named plaintiffs. Judge Chutkan also held that the MPD officers were not entitled to qualified immunity because a reasonable police officer would understand that stopping and searching someone without reasonable suspicion or probable cause is unlawful. Lastly, the court found that the plaintiffs sufficiently established the District of Columbia's municipal liability.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 31, 2024, the parties filed a joint motion for a referral to a magistrate judge for mediation; the parties also moved to stay. Judge Tanya Chutkan granted the joint motion on February 6, 2024, and the case was referred to Magistrate Judge Moxila Upadhyaya for mediation. All deadlines were stayed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 5, the parties reached a settlement. The terms of the settlement are unknown to the Clearinghouse at this time. Judge Chutkan ordered the parties to file a stipulation of dismissal or joint status report on or before July 8, 2024. The case was dismissed on June 24, 2024.&nbsp;</p>",

Dalonta Crudup, Dontrey Bell, and David Burns (sometimes the โNamed \nPlaintiffsโ), on behalf of themselves and the classes defined below, bring this action against the \nGovernment of the District of Columbia (the โDistrictโ or the โDistrict of Columbiaโ) under 42 \nU.S.C.A. ยง 1983 for injuries they suffered during the Class Period because the District, through its \npolicy of stopping, frisking and searching African American people (especially young African \nAmerican men) looking for guns without reasonable suspicion or probable cause, fabricating facts \nto justify the stops, frisks and searches, and intentionally discriminating on the basis of race through \nits Gun Recovery, violated their Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights. \nJurisdiction and Venue \n2.  This Court has jurisdiction over the Named Plaintiffsโ ยง 1983 claims under 28 \nU.S.C.A. ยง1331 and 28 U.S.C.A. ยง1343(3)-(4). \n3.  Venue is proper in this jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.CA. ยง1391(b) because the \nevents or omissions underlying the claims occurred in this judicial district.  \nParties \n4.   Named Plaintiffs and the members of the proposed classes are African American \npersons who were stopped, frisked and searched for guns by the Districtโs Gun Recovery Unit \nwithout reasonable suspicion or probable cause, some of whom were arrested, charged or arrested \nand charged, and detained, and prosecuted in violation of their Second, Fourth, and Fifth \nAmendment rights. \n5.  Defendant the Government of the District of Columbia is a municipal corporation \ncapable of being sued under D.C. Code ยง 1-102. \nPage 2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 3 of 28\n6.  Chief Peter Newsham is not a defendant in this lawsuit, but Chief Peter Newsham is the \npolicymaker for the District of Columbiaโs MPD (Metropolitan Police Department (โMPDโ), a \ndepartment of the government of the District of Columbia. Mayor Muriel Bowser appointed Chief \nNewsham Interim Chief of Police on September 15, 2016; he was named Chief of the \nMetropolitan Police Department on February 23, 2017 and sworn in on May 2, 2017. Chief Peter \nNewsham is not a defendant in this lawsuit. \n7.  The Gun Recovery Unit is not a defendant but the Gun Recovery Unit is a special MPD \npolice unit that focuses on the interdiction and recovery of illegal firearms, and the apprehension \nof individuals involved in illegal gun crime. The Gun Recovery Unit focuses its efforts almost \nexclusively on African Americans. \nFactual Allegations \nThe District and its War on Guns and Young African American Men Who Might Carry Them   \n8.  In the hope of ending violent crime, the District of Columbia declared war on guns by \nenacting some of the strictest gun control measures in the country. Under this policy the Districtโs \ngun control measures amounted to a total ban on the ownership by everyone except law \nenforcement officers. But, in 2007 the Supreme Court invalidated the Districtโs approach by \nholding that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to keep and bear arms and that \nthe core of the right is the right to self-defense. The District continued to deny handguns to people \nwithin its borders. In 2014 a district court Judge declared the Districtโs gun laws a total ban on \ncarrying guns outside the home and thus unconstitutional under the Second Amendment. The \nD.C. Council replaced the total ban with another total ban on carrying guns outside the home \nwhich the D.C. Circuit struck down in 2017. Disregarding these changes in the law the District \nthrough its Gun Recovery Unit has continued its practice and custom of treating African American \npeople as though they all carry illegal handguns.   \nPage 3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 4 of 28\n9.  Despite its laudable mission of ending gun violence, the District through its Gun Recovery \nUnit has taken a meat axe to a problem that calls for a scalpel because in its zeal to find and \nconfiscate illegal guns the Gun Recovery Unit has declared war on the African American citizens in \nthe District, especially young African American men.  \n10.  Moreover, the Gun Recovery Unit refuses to accept that changes in the law required by the \nSupreme Court and it continues to treat gun possession โ especially gun possession by African \nAmericans โ as presumptively illegal. \n11.  The District's Gun Recovery Unit relies on the latitude afforded by voluntary consent to \nfacilitate both suspicionless \"consented\" searches and Terry seizures premised on purportedly \nreasonable suspicions. But in the particulars of its application, the District's policy perverts the logic \nunderlying Terry. \n12.  Moreover, the Gun Recovery Unit also carries out its mission by fabricating the reasonable \nsuspicion or probable cause required by the Constitution to stop and frisk or search people whom \nthe Gun Recovery Unit encounters. \n13.  Because the Gun Recovery Unit operates mainly in African American areas and \nneighborhood the people whom the Gun Recovery Unit encounters are almost always African \nAmerican and the people it stop and frisks or searches are almost 80% African American.   \nGun Recovery Unit \n14.  The Gun Recovery Unit is a special MPD police unit that focuses on the interdiction and \nrecovery of illegal firearms, and the apprehension of individuals involved in illegal gun crime. The \nGun Recovery Unitโs stated mission is to remove firearms from the streets of the District of \nColumbia, before they can be used in a violent crime.  \n15.  The Gun Recovery Unit consists at any one time of twenty to thirty officers and one or \nmore detectives and about three sergeants.  \nPage 4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 5 of 28\n16.  The Unit patrols seven days a week, 24 hours a day.  \n17.  The GRU reports to the Narcotics and Special Investigations Division. NSID falls under \nthe Investigative Services Bureau which was headed by Chief Peter Newsham when he was \nAssistant Chief.  \n18.  The GRU completes a nightly report that documents all activity from the shift. The GRU \nalso completes a monthly report documenting all activities for the month.  \n19.  The GRU patrol in โtacticalโ gear as the pictures show. \n \n \n \n \n20.  The Gun Recovery Unit patrols the predominately African American areas of the District \nquestioning people they encounter โ virtually all of whom are African Americans - about whether \nthey are carrying firearms, even though the Second Amendment and the laws of the District allow \npeople to carry concealed handguns outside the home. \n21.  One Gun Recovery Unit officer, Officer Katz, testifying in a motions hearing in Superior \nCourt, described the job as being \"about observations,\" specifically \"how people react to [the Gun \nPage 5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 6 of 28\nRecovery Unit].\" In particular, \"[w]hen [Officer Katz] ask[s] people if they have a gun, [he is] \nlooking for a reaction โ based on [their] movements after that question.\" \n22.  According to Officer Katz, โwe ask everybody if they have a gun.\" \n23.  In the absence of any particularized reports, evidence, or suspicions, the Gun Recovery \nUnit patrolling officers simply question every person they encounter who fits their โprofileโ of \nlikely to carry a gun. They \"employ[] a simple technique: they ask[] any individual they encounter[] \nif he or she ha[s] a gun and then watch[] to see if that individual engage[s] in what the officers \nperceive[] to be suspicious behavior.\"  If consent to question or search is refused, officers \nfrequently construe citizens' varied reactions to their probes as rationalizing a Terry stop.  \n24.  The Gun Recovery Unit exploit the technical doctrine that police are free to engage \ncitizens in consensual stops, ask them questions in consensual conversations, and make consensual \nsearches of their persons and belongings.  \n25.  The District of Columbia Court of Appeals expressed concern that Officer Katz's mission \nmay have clouded his perception of what they see.  \n26.  Officer Katz and his team were out looking for guns. To that end, Officer \nKatz asked everyone if they had a gun, and he looked for a \"reaction โ based on \nmovements\" after that question, and then he evaluated the physical response to that \nquestion to determine whether to investigate further. As noted in the recent stop \nand frisk civil litigation in New York City, \"[r]ecent psychological research has . . . \nprovided evidence that officers may be more likely to perceive a movement as \nindicative of criminality if the officer has been primed to look for signs that 'crime is \nafoot.'\" \"'[G]iven the nature of their work on patrol, officers may have a systematic \ntendency to see and report furtive movements where none objectively exist.'\"  \n \nRobinson v. United States, 76 A.3d 329, 339 (D.C. 2013)(internal citations omitted). \n27.  Having once stopped a person, and then having convinced themselves that the personโs \nreaction to the encounter is โsuspicious,โ the Gun Recovery Unit then bootstraps the โsuspiciousโ \nbehavior into a Terry โfriskโ for weapons ostensibly for โthe officersโ safety.โ \nPage 6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 7 of 28\n28.  The Gun Recovery Unit's officers have all but candidly recognized that their policy \namounts to statistical gamesmanship. In a prior case involving the same policy, Officer Katz, for \nexample, noted that the unit's officers targeted a particular \"high crime\" area for patrols because it \n\"was one of [the officer's] top-yielding gun areas as far as recovering firearms off of people\" and \nstopped an individual for questioning without \"any discussion among\" the officers about the \nrationale for the stop, where neither Officer Katz nor the other officers \"[saw] anything, initially, \nabout him\" to suggest he had a gun.  \n29.  As the D.C. Superior Court noted, like all officers in the District's Gun Recovery Unit, \n\"[Officer Katz] asked [the individual] whether he had a weapon, not because he had any suspicion \nthat he did, but because that's his job. He's a gun recover[er]โand he asks everyone. Apparently, \nhe goes down the street asking everyone, do you have a gun.\" \n30.  What these descriptions fail to mention is that almost all of the โeveryonesโ the Gun \nRecovery Unit ask about weapons are African Americans, because the Gun Recovery Unit patrols \nalmost exclusively in predominately African American neighborhoods. \n31.  Members of the Gun Recovery Unit also have a practice of stopping people and then \nfrisking them or searching them or their belongings without reasonable suspicion and without any \nobjective facts indicating a person is armed. \n32.  The Gun Recovery Unit also has a pattern or custom of stopping, frisking and searching \npeople, especially young, African American men, without reasonable suspicion or probable cause \nand fabricating facts to justify the stops and frisks and searches. If the police find an illegal gun they \narrest the person and fabricate facts in their โGersteinsโ to justify the stop and frisks. \nThe Gun Recovery Unitโs operation in Deanwood on June 13, 2018 illustrates the Unitโs practices \n33.  An illustrative example of Gun Recovery Unitโs modus operandi of stop and frisk is the \nGun Recovery Unitโs operation in Deanwood on June 13, 2018. \nPage 7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 8 of 28\n34.  Several Gun Recovery Unit officers arrived in tactical gear in front of a barbershop where \nseveral African American men were sitting outside.  \n35.  As the officers got out of their vehicles, they told the men that they were interested in a car \nparked out front because it had overly tinted windows.  \n36.  But in fact, the officers staged a fake search and find operation. They searched a man who \nwas ostensibly a member of the group but was in fact a โplant,โ put there by the Gun Recovery \nUnit so they could find a gun and thus manufacture reasonable suspicion to search the other men. \nVideo posted in the Washington Post and online shows the ugly angry exchange that followed. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_tWbmfGEhE&t=360s \n37.  The Gun Recovery Unit also stop and frisk African American men and simply lie about \nthe facts justifying the stop and frisks. The Gun Recovery Unitโs stop and frisk of Mr. Crudup and \nthe other Named plaintiffs falls into this category.  \n38.  Data released by the MPD indicate that about 80% of all stops made by the MPD are of \nAfrican Americans.  \n39.  The Gun Recovery Unit of the D.C. police has a practice of subjecting individuals โwho fit \na certain statistical profileโ to โintrusive searches unless they can prove their innocenceโ โ[d]espite \nlacking any semblance of particularized suspicion when the initial contact is made.โ \n40.  In its efforts to ferret out illegal firearms the District has implemented a \"rolling roadblock.\" \nOfficers randomly trawl โhigh crimeโ neighborhoods which are almost always African American \nneighborhoods asking occupants who fit a certain statistical profileโmostly males in their late teens \nto early fortiesโif they possess contraband.  \n41.  Despite lacking any semblance of particularized suspicion when the initial contact is made, \nthe police subject these individuals to intrusive searches unless they can prove their innocence. \nDistrictโs gun control regime  \nPage 8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 9 of 28\n42.  The District of Columbia Court of Appeals, the highest โstateโ court in the District of \nColumbia, continues to hold that \"there is no Second Amendment right to carry a concealed \nfirearm in public.\" Dubose v. United States, 213 A.3d 599, 604 (D.C. 2019). \n43.  The Districtโs gun control regime rests on three primary statutes, (1) CPWL (carrying a \npistol without a licenses); (2) UF (possessing a firearm without a license); and (3) UA ((possessing a \nfirearm without a license). \nCPWL - total ban on the โopen carryโ of a hand gun outside of a personโs homes or places of \nbusiness  \n44.  The Districtโs gun control regime currently allows people to obtain a license to carry a \nconcealed handgun outside of their homes and places of business with some restrictions. D.C. \nCode ยง 22-4504(a). \n45.  But, the Districtโs gun control regime imposes a total ban on the โopen carryโ of a hand \ngun outside of a personโs homes or places of business because the District will not issue licenses \nfor โopen carry.โ \n46.  Thus, a person with a license may walk down the street carrying a loaded handgun \nproviding no one can see it but the same person may not โopen carryโ a loaded handgun โoutside \n[their] pants for all the honest world to feel.โ  \nUF/ UA  \n47.  The โUFโ statute provides that \"[N]o person . . . in the District shall possess or control any \nfirearm, unless the person . . . holds a valid registration certificate for the firearm.\" D.C. Code ยง 7-\n2502.01(a) (2015 Supp.).  \n48.  The โUAโ statute provides that, โFurthermore, no person shall possess ammunition in the \nDistrict unless he has a valid registration certificate for a firearm.โ D.C. Code ยง 7-2506.01(a)(3) \n(2015 Supp.). \nPage 9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 10 of 28\nTotal ban on carrying handguns in a vehicle  \n49.   The Districtโs statute effectively imposes a total ban on carrying handguns in a vehicle. \nReciprocity in Washington DC \n50.  The District of Columbia does not have any reciprocity agreements with other states and \ncurrently will not honor any other states concealed carry license.  \n51.  Twenty one states honor a District of Columbia license to carry a handgun: Alabama, \nAlaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, \nMissouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, \nVermont, and Virginia. \n52.  Many people arrested for gun offenses in the District have licenses in other states or come \nfrom states which do not require licenses. \nNamed Plaintiffsโ Stop and Frisks and Prosecutions \nThe stops and frisks of Messrs Cudrup, Bell, and Burns typify the stop and frisks made by the \nGun Recovery Unit  \n53.  The stops and frisks of Messrs Cudrup, Bell, and Burns typify the stop and frisks made by \nthe Gun Recovery Unit. \n54.  Each is a young African American men, each was stopped by the Gun Recovery Unit when \nhe was doing nothing more than walking down the street or sitting in a car, and in each case the \nGun Recovery Unit attributed sinister dangerous significance to jittery nerves caused by fear of \nbeing accosted by numerous aggressive officers in tactical gear, and in each case the Gun Recovery \nUnit fabricated facts in a sworn narrative to justify the stop, frisk and searches and arrests knowing \nthe narratives would be relied on by AUSAs making charging decisions and Judges making release/ \ndetention decisions. \nPage 10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 11 of 28\nStop and frisk of Mr. Crudup \n55.    On Sunday January 12, 2020 at about 11:30 p.m. the then twenty four year old African \nAmerican Dalonta Crudup was walking down the street in an African American area characterized \nby the Gun Recovery Unit as a high crimearea (walking southwest on the 2400 block of 14th Street \nin the District) where by definition the need for self-defense is greatest.  \n56.  A recent spate of shootings as well as a homicide had occurred in the area. \n57.  Mr. Crudup had a virtually non-existent criminal history. He was on a scholarship  at a \ncollege in Kentucky. He lived with his mother in Silver Spring, Maryland while in the District of \nColumbia. Mr. Crudup had a concealed carry permit from Kentucky. \n58.  Officer Choi and three other officers of the Gun Recovery Unit (Officer Minzak, Officer \nJoseph and Officer Laury) were cruising the streets in a vehicle when they turned into the 2400 \nblock of 14th Street and they observed Mr. Crudup walking on the sidewalk with a black backpack \nin his right hand.  \n59.  Officer Choy testified under oath in a hearing in Superior Court that what drew the \nofficersโ suspicion was that Mr. Crudup was holding the backpack with his right hand, to his waist, \nbut when Mr. Crudup observed the police, he looked over his shoulders, and then he put the \nbackpack on both of his shoulders. \n60.  According to the Gerstein1, Officer Laury got out of vehicle to talk to Mr. Crudup. Officer \nLaury identified herself to Mr. Crudup, asked Mr. Crudup whether he had any weapons on him, \nand Mr. Crudup replied \"no\". Officer Laury then asked if there was anything in Mr. Crudupโs \nbackpack.  \n                                                 \n1 A โGersteinโ is a statement of facts intended to support probable cause for an arrest \nsworn to by the arresting officer under penalty of perjury. The purpose of a Gerstein is to support \na prosecutorโs request for a hold under D.C. Code ยง 23-1322(b) and (d);D.C. Code ยง 23-\n1331(3)(A). \nPage 11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 12 of 28\n61.  According to officersโ sworn testimony, Mr. Crudup then took his backpack off and \ncontinued repeating \"I don't have no weapons\" and then shook his backpack a few times. When \nMr. Crudup shook his backpack, officers said they could hear what seemed to be a hard object. \nMr. Crudup then stated it was his phone that made the sound in his backpack. Officer Laury then \ntold Mr. Crudup that she just saw Mr. Crudup with his phone in his hand and Mr. Crudup never \nplaced the phone back in his backpack. Mr. Crudup then took his phone out of his front jacket \npocket, not his backpack, and began calling for help. \n62.  Officer Choy then tried to grab the bag from Mr. Crudupโs immediate possession based, \nhe swore, on safety concerns.  \n63.  Officer Choy touched the exterior part of the bag and immediately felt what he claimed he \nrecognized to be more than two ounces of marijuana.  \n64.  When Officer Choy tried to remove the backpack from Mr. Crudup, Mr. Crudup \nimmediately clenched onto the top hook part of the backpack as tightly as possible and would not \nlet go.  \n65.  Officer Choy then further searched the backpack and observed a black in color pistol. \n66.  Mr. Crudup was presented in Superior Court on January 13, 2020. Mr. Crudup was \npreventively detained pursuant to D.C. Code ยง 23-1322(b) on the basis of the probable cause \nstatement in Officer Choyโs Gerstein pending a preventive detention hearing.  \n67.  The Judge released Mr. Crudup into High Intensity Supervision custody placed on GPS \nmonitoring. Mr. Crudup remained on GPS monitoring with HISP conditions of release until \nMarch 3, 2020 when the government dismissed the case. \n68.  But the Gun Recovery Unitโs version of events set forth in the Gerstein and Officer Choyโs \ntestimony at the Superior Court hearing was fabricated to freate justification for the stop, frisk and \nsearch. \nPage 12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 13 of 28\n69.  The government indicted Mr. Crudup and an AUSA contacted Mr. Crudupโs counsel with \na plea offer. Mr. Crudupโs counsel responded with an email rejecting the offer because of defects \nin the stop as shown on the BWC. Fifteen minutes later the AUSA emailed back saying the \ngovernment was dismissing the case. \n70.  These facts and the narrative the officers wove from them in sworn statements and sworn \ntestimony are fabrications. \n71.  In fact, a large group of officers just walked up to Mr. Crudup and one asked him if he had \nany weapons. \n72.  Mr. Crudup lifts his shirt to show his waistband to show he has nothing stuck in his pants. \n73.  The officers back him up against a fence and then tell him itโs suspicious the way heโs \nstanding against the fence. \n74.  The officer then touches the bag and claims to feel what he claims is more than two ounces \nof marihuana (possession of two ounces is legal under District law). \n75.  Mr. Crudup had admitted to smoking marijuana but that is not a crime. \n76.  One of the officers claimed to hear a hard object rattling inside. \n77.  Mr. Crudup yells โillegal searchโ and the officers pull the bag away from him.  \nStop and frisk of Mr. Bell \n78.  On Monday, April 29th, 2019, at approximately 10:00 p.m. Dontrey Bell was in a parking \nlot at the 1500 block of Butler Street, S.E. in the District. \n79.  Meanwhile, some of the same members of the Gun Recovery Unit (including Officer Choi) \nwere patrolling in the 7th District when they turned into a parking lot of the 1500 block of Butler \nStreet, S.E., when they saw a group of African American young men hanging out in front of 1558 \nButler Street SE.  \nPage 13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 14 of 28\n80.  According to the Gerstein, four of the officers - Officer Choy, Officer Minzak, Officer \nAnderson and Officer Rogers -got out of their vehicle to make contact with the group, and, \nAccording to the Gerstein, Mr. Bell โtook unprovoked flight up the stairs of 1558 Butler Street \nS.E. \n81.  According to the Gerstein, Officers gave chase and Defendant Bell was stopped on the top \nfloor of the apartment building. Officer Anderson then asked Defendant Bell if he had any \nweapons on him at which time Defendant Bell dropped his hands to his sides. Defendant Bell was \nalso looking down and taking deep breaths with a blank stare on his face while Officer Anderson \nwas talking to him. Based on Defendant Bell's nervousness and actions, a pat down for weapons \nwas conducted. Officer Anderson felt a hard metal object in Defendant Bell's back left pants \npocket which he immediately recognized to be a firearm. \n82.  But, these facts are a fabrication. \n83.  There was no crowd. The Gun Recovery Unit officers jumped out of their vehicle to run \nup the steps, and then the Gun Recovery Unit officers stopped, grabbed and searched Mr. Bell \nwithout Mr. Bellโs saying a word. \n84.  The officers say they found a gun on Mr. Bell. \n85.  On April 30, 2019 Mr. Bell was presented on a charge of CPWL in Superior Court.  \n86.  Mr. Bell was preventively detained pursuant to D.C. Code ยง 23-1322(b) on the basis of the \nprobable cause statement in Officer Minzakโs Gerstein pending a preventive detention hearing. \n87.  The Judge found probable cause at the hearing based on the officersโ fabricated testimony \nbut the Judge released Mr. Bell into High Intensity Supervision custody and placed him on GPS \nmonitoring pending the action of the Grand Jury.  \n88.  A docket entry on 9/11/2019 reads: โCounsel represented that upon further review of the \nBody Worn Camera Video he noted some issues that could prove to be dispositive.โ \nPage 14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 15 of 28\n89.  On 10/3/2019 the Judge granted the governmentโs motion to dismiss without prejudice. \nStop and Frisk of David Burns \n90.  According to the Gerstein, on February 12, 2018 at about 10:30 p.m. the then 26 year old \nAfrican American David Burns was sitting in a car with his girlfriend (also African American) in the \nrear parking lot of 2660 Douglas Pl S.E. in the District smoking a cigarette when several Gun \nRecovery Unit members in three separate cars (Officer Anderson driver, Officer Henderson front \nseat passenger, and Officer Joseph Officer Wright driver, Officer Ashley front seat passenger, \nOfficer Hiller and Detective Del Po) rolled into the lot. \n91.  According to the Gerstein, Officer Joseph approached the passenger side of the vehicle \nand started talking to Mr. Burns. He asked the Mr. Burns and his girlfriend whether they had any \nweapons, to which they said no. Officer Joseph then asked if he could take thirty seconds of their \ntime to check and make sure, and asked to see their waistbands. Another officer, Officer Wright, \nthen approached the vehicle and asked Mr. Burns if he could talk to him and asked him to step \nout of the car. \n92.  According to the Gerstein, because Mr. Burns looked nervous and puzzled, Officers \nJoseph and Wright escorted him out of the vehicle by controlling both hands believing that he \nmight be armed, and Officer Wright patted him down and felt what he believed was a firearm on \nhis right thigh. \n93.  On February 2, 2018 Mr. Burns was presented on a charge of CPWL in Superior Court. \nMr. Burns was preventively detained pursuant to D.C. Code ยง 23-1322(b) on the basis of the \nprobable cause statement in Officer Shermanโs Gerstein pending a preventive detention hearing. \nMr. Burns waived the preliminary hearing and the Judge released Mr. Burns pending the action of \nthe Grand Jury. Eventually after Mr. Burns filed a motion to suppress the government moved to \ndismiss the indictment which the Judge granted on April 8, 2018.   \nPage 15 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 16 of 28\n94.  The facts present by the officers are a fabricated over-exaggeration. Mr. Burnsโ behavior \nwas typical of an African American man whose vehicle was swarmed by several police vehicles \nblocking his vehicle in, who jumped out of their vehicles and swarmed Mr. Burns and his lady \ncompanion,  approached by officers who swarmed the car and questioned him and his \ncompanion. \nMPD mounted almost insurmountable barriers to obtaining data about stop and frisks \n95.  In March 2016, the District of Columbia enacted the Neighborhood Engagement Achieves \nResults (NEAR) Act of 2016.  \n96.  One of its key provisions required the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) to \ncollect detailed and comprehensive data about stops and frisks the police carry out on the streets of \nthe District. The stop-and-frisk data collection provision called for police officers to collect 14 \ncategories of data for every stop in D.C. including reason for stop, duration for stop, whether stop \nresulted in arrest, and race and/ or ethnicity of person stopped, and whether the stop resulted in a \nsearch. \n97.  The D.C. Council allocated funding for data collection to begin in October 2016. \n98.  The collection of this data is crucial to ensuring that the police do not unfairly and \nunconstitutionally focus on people of color when conducting these stops.  \n99.  But, FOIA requests filed by local watchdog groups in 2017 showed that the data collection \nrequirement had not yet been implemented and so the District and the MPD was not collecting \nthe data about stops and frisks the MPD carry out on the streets of the District.  \n100.  Over the following year, officials from Mayor Bowserโs office and MPD responded to \noversight inquiries by the D.C. Council with a shifting and contradictory parade of excuses, the \nrelease of recycled and incomplete pre-NEAR data, and even a false claim that the NEAR Act had \nbeen โfully implemented.โ  \nPage 16 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 17 of 28\n101.  In fact, in early 2018, the mayorโs office released a report stating the NEAR Act had been \nโfully implementedโ when it had not. \n102.  In fact, based on Council testimony by top D.C. officials in February 2018 and press \nstatements from MPD in March 2018, it became clear that, two years on, the NEAR Act Stop & \nFrisk Data collection requirement still had not been implemented, that the District had not \ntouched the money the Council allocated for implementation of the NEAR Act Stop & Frisk Data \ncollection requirement, and the District was no closer to collecting the NEAR Act Stop & Frisk \nData than when the Act was passed. \nTraffic Arrest Patterns Raise Particularly Serious Questions about Racial Bias \n103.  Meanwhile, the need for the data points required by the NEAR Act has remained acute.  \n104.  Although African Americans make up forty-seven percent of D.C.โs population, they \nremain the subjects of the vast majority of all stops, frisks, and uses of force in the District.  \n105.  A February 2018 investigative report from WUSA9 analyzed pre-NEAR Act data and \nfound that approximately eighty percent of the stops involved a black subject.  \n106.  In the meantime the data points that the MPD should have been collecting pursuant to the \nstop-and-frisk data collection provision of the Near Act was being lost because MPD refused to \ncollect it as required. \n107.  Some of the data points were available in other media such as in the narrative section in the \nMPDโs databases and in BWC footage. \n108.  But, efforts by the ACLU to harvest BWC footage to collect data points about race in stop \nand frisks revealed the MPD was erecting bureaucratic and financial barriers to citizensโ obtaining \nthe data. \nPage 17 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 18 of 28\n109.  โEven if we had the capacity to review 31,000 body-worn camera videos, and even if every \ntraffic stop is just five minutes, thatโs more than 2,600 hours of footage to get information that \ncould have easily been indicated with a checkbox on a form,โ an ACLU lawyer said. \n110.  The MPD, although willing to produce some of the data points in response to FOIA \nrequests for BWC footage, imposed charges which made obtaining the data points from BWC \nfootage an illusory remedy. \n111.  โOver the past three years, an untold amount of information about how policing is \nconducted in the District has been lost due to the Districtโs stubborn disregard for a law that passed \nunanimously in the Council,โ said Nassim Moshiree, Policy Director, ACLU-DC. โOne monthโs \nworth of data has shown a stark racial disparity in who is being stopped in the District.โ  \n112.  Finally in September 2019 the MPD released NEAR Act Stop & Frisk Data which was \ncollected for a four-week period from July 22 to August 18, 2019. \n113.  The data indicated that during the period MPD officers conducted 11,600 stops across the \ncity, both of motorists and others. For every 100 stops conducted, the department reported that \n60% resulted in a traffic ticket and 20% led to an arrest. The remaining 20% were said to have \nbeen stopped as part of an investigation, which can range from someone acting erratically to \nsomeone matching the description of a criminal suspect. \n114.  Of all stops recorded in the four-week period, 70% were of African Americans, 15% of \nwhites and 7% of Hispanics. African Americans currently make up just under half of the cityโs \npopulation. \n115.  The average duration of non-ticket stops (20.7 minutes) was almost twice as high as the \nduration of ticket stops.  \nPage 18 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 19 of 28\n116.  The ACLU found similar racial disparities in arrest data (including certain types of stops \nresulting in โcitationsโ) for the years 2013 to 2017 it obtained from MPD through an open records \nrequest.  \n117.  From 2013 to 2017, African American individuals composed 47% of D.C.โs population but \n86% of its arrestees. During this time, African American people were arrested at 10 times the rate \nof white people. searches were more likely to be conducted in the police districts encompassing \nWards 7 and 8 than anywhere else in the city โ 20% and 35% the Sixth and Seventh Districts, \ncompared to 17% in the Fifth District (which includes Ward 5) and 4% in the Second District \n(which includes largely white Wards 2 and 3.)  \n118.  African American people are disproportionately arrested in over 90% of the Districtโs \ncensus tracts, including the whitest parts of the city.  \n119.  Seventy-eight percent of all people arrested for driving without a permit were African \nAmerican. That statistic is notable because in many cases, officers have no way of knowing whether \na driver possesses a valid permit at the time they order the driver to pull over. As a result, the \nsignificant disparity in arrests for this offense may indicate a racial disparity in traffic stops. \nSubstantive Allegations for Claims \nClaim 1 \nFourth Amendment Illegal Stop and Frisk Claim  \n120.  Named Plaintiffs adopt by reference the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  \n121.  The Districtโs Gun Recovery Unit during the Class Period had a pattern and practice of \nstopping and frisking African American people, especially young African American men, and then \nsearching them, to recover guns, without reasonable suspicion or probable cause to justify the stops \nor frisks or searches. \nPage 19 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 20 of 28\n122.  Named Plaintiffs were stop and frisked and searched without reasonable suspicion or \nprobable cause to justify the stops or frisks or searches because Gun Recovery Unit had a pattern \nand practice or custom of stopping, frisking and searching people it encountered without \nreasonable suspicion or probable cause to justify the stops or frisks or searches and the Chief of \nPolice knowlingly acquiesced in the stops, frisks and searches.  \n123.  Stopping, frisking and searching Named Plaintiffsโ and the other Stop and Frisk Class \nmembers pursuant to its pattern or custom violated their 4th Amendment rights because the stops, \nfrisks and searches were without reasonable suspicion of probable cause. \n124.  The moving force of the constitutional violations was the Gun Recovery Unitโs pattern and \npractice or custom.  \n125.  Named Plaintiffs and the other Stop and Frisk Class members suffered humiliation, \nemotional distress, physical harm, loss of earnings, general damages, and legal expenses that \nresulted from being stopped, frisked and searched without justification.    \n126.  The District is liable for the conduct of the Gun Recovery Unit because the Chief of \nPolice, policymaker for the MPD, knew about and encouraged the Gun Recovery Unit to make \nthe stops, frisks and searches without justification and either knew about and encouraged or \nacquiesced in the Gun Recovery Unitโs fabrication of facts to justify the stops, frisks and searches \n(actually made without justification).    \n127.  Alternatively, the Chief of Police, policymaker for the MPD, knowingly ignored a practice \non the part of the Gun Recovery Unit described herein that was consistent enough to create a \ncustom.  \n128.  Alternatively, the fact that the government of the District of Columbia failed to \"respond to \na need . . . in such a manner as to show 'deliberate indifference' to the risk that not addressing the \nPage 20 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 21 of 28\nneed will result in constitutional violations\" was the moving force behind the Gun Recovery Unitโs \nconduct described herein. \n129.  Named Plaintiffs and the other class members are therefore entitled to the relief described \nherein. \nClaim 2 \nFifth Amendment claim against defendant for fabrication of evidence \n130.  Named Plaintiffs adopt by reference the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n131.  Members of the Gun Recovery Unit have a custom and pattern and practice of fabricating \nfacts to justify the stops, frisks and searches of African American people, especially young African \nAmerican men, to frisk and search them for guns. \n132.  Members of the Gun Recovery Unit have a custom and pattern and practice of fabricating \nfacts in Gersteins to justify the stops, frisks and searches of African American people, especially \nyoung African American men, to frisk and search them for guns, and to induce prosecutors to \ncharge and detain and to prosecute them for gun offenses in the District of Columbia Superior \nCourt. \n133.  Members of the Gun Recovery Unit have a custom and pattern and practice of fabricating \nfacts in oral statements to prosecutors in papering conferences to justify the stops, frisks and \nsearches of African American people, especially young African American men, to frisk and search \nthem for guns, and to induce prosecutors to charge and detain and to prosecute them for gun \noffenses in the District of Columbia Superior Court. \n134.  Members of the Gun Recovery Unit know the prosecutors will rely on these fabricated \nfacts have a custom and pattern and practice of fabricating facts. \n135.  The District is liable for the conduct of the Gun Recovery Unit because the Chief of \nPolice, policymaker for the MPD, knew about and encouraged the Gun Recovery Unit to make \nPage 21 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 22 of 28\nthe stops, frisks and searches without justification and either knew about and encouraged or \nacquiesced in the Gun Recovery Unitโs fabrication of facts to justify the stops, frisks and searches \n(actually made without justification).    \n136.  Alternatively, the Chief of Police, policymaker for the MPD, knowingly ignored a practice \non the part of the Gun Recovery Unit described herein of fabricating facts to justify the stops, frisks \nand searches that was consistent enough to create a custom.  \n137.  Alternatively, the fact that the government of the District of Columbia failed to \"respond to \na need . . . in such a manner as to show 'deliberate indifference' to the risk that not addressing the \nneed will result in constitutional violations\" was the moving force behind the Gun Recovery Unitโs \nconduct described herein. \n138.  As a direct and proximate result of this conduct, Named plaintiffs and absent class \nmembers suffered loss of liberty and physical injuries and emotional distress. \n139.  Named Plaintiffs and the other class members are therefore entitled to the relief described \nherein. \nClaim 3 \nยง 1983 Liability of District of Columbia under the equal protection clause for the Gun Recovery \nUnitโs stopping, frisking and searching African American people in a racially discriminatory \nmanner \n140.  Named Plaintiffs adopt by reference the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n141.  The District is liable under the Equal Protection Clause for its policy through the Gun \nRecovery Unit of intentionally stopping, frisking and searching African American people in a \nracially discriminatory manner. \n142.  Accordingly, Named plaintiffs Class are entitled to damages and other relief as set forth \nbelow.   \nPage 22 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 23 of 28\n143.  The District is liable for the conduct of the Gun Recovery Unit because the Chief of \nPolice, policymaker for the MPD, knew about and encouraged the Gun Recovery Unit to make \nthe stops, frisks and searches without justification and either knew about and encouraged or \nacquiesced in the Gun Recovery Unitโs fabrication of facts to justify the stops, frisks and searches \n(actually made without justification).    \n144.  Alternatively, the Chief of Police, policymaker for the MPD, knowingly ignored a practice \non the part of the Gun Recovery Unit described herein of fabricating facts to justify the stops, frisks \nand searches that was consistent enough to create a custom.  \n145.  Alternatively, the fact that the government of the District of Columbia failed to \"respond to \na need . . . in such a manner as to show 'deliberate indifference' to the risk that not addressing the \nneed will result in constitutional violations\" was the moving force behind the Gun Recovery Unitโs \nconduct described herein. \n146.  As a direct and proximate result of this conduct, Named plaintiffs and absent class \nmembers suffered loss of liberty and physical injuries and emotional distress. \n147.  Named Plaintiffs and the other class members are therefore entitled to the relief described \nherein. \nRULE 23 ALLEGATIONS \n148.  Named Plaintiffs  on behalf of themselves and the classes defined below bring this action \nunder Rules 23(a) and 23(b)2) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of \nthe following three classes:  \nFourth Amendment Stop, Frisk and Search Class: Each person who: (1) in the period \nbeginning three years before the date of filing of the original complaint in this case and going \nforward until the date this case is terminated; (2) was stopped, frisked, and searched in the District \nof Columbia for violation of any of the Districtโs gun control regime; (3) by the Districtโs Gun \nPage 23 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 24 of 28\nRecovery Unit ; (4) for conduct involving any of, or any combination of, carrying or possessing a \npistol or unlicensed firearm or unlicensed ammunition outside their home or place of business; (5) \nincluding but not limited to such persons who were also arrested and/or arrested and detained \n(including subjected to conditions of release). \nFabrication Stop, Frisk and Search Class: Each person who: (1) in the period beginning \nthree years before the date of filing of the original complaint in this case and going forward until \nthe date this case is terminated; (2) was stopped, frisked, and searched in the District of Columbia \nfor violation of any of the Districtโs gun control regime; (3) by the Districtโs Gun Recovery Unit ; \n(4) for conduct involving any of, or any combination of, carrying or possessing a pistol or \nunlicensed firearm or unlicensed ammunition outside their home or place of business; (5) \nincluding but not limited to such persons who were also arrested and/or arrested and detained \n(including subjected to conditions of release). \nEqual Protection Stop, Frisk and Search Class: Each African American person who: (1) in \nthe period beginning three years before the date of filing of the original complaint in this case and \ngoing forward until the date this case is terminated; (2) was stopped, frisked, and/or searched in the \nDistrict of Columbia for violation of any of the Districtโs gun control regime; (3) by the Districtโs \nGun Recovery Unit ; (4) for conduct involving any of, or any combination of, carrying or \npossessing a pistol or unlicensed firearm or unlicensed ammunition outside their home or place of \nbusiness; (5) including but not limited to such persons who were also arrested and/or arrested and \ndetained (including subjected to conditions of release). \n149.  Certification of these classes under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is appropriate, \nbecause the District of Columbia has a policy, pattern, and practice for each claim that has \nuniformly affected all members the class, and injunctive relief and declaratory judgment and a \njudgment against the District will benefit each and every plaintiff and class member. \nPage 24 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 25 of 28\n150.  The classes are entitled to injunctive relief including sealing of their stop, arrest and \nprosecution records and declaring their arrests as legal nullities and the return of their property. \n151.  The classes are also entitled to injunctive relief including but not limited to appointment of \nan outside monitor to monitor the conduct of the Gun Recovery Unit to ensure compliance with \nthe Constitutional provisions on which Plaintiffs base their claims. \n152.  Certification of the classes under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is also \nappropriate, in that common questions of law and fact predominate over any individual questions, \nand class action treatment is superior for the fair and efficient adjudication of these class claims as \ndetailed below.  \n153.  The classes are entitled to monetary relief. \n154.  Regarding Named Plaintiffs and the other members of the classes defined above, there are \nno individual questions on the issue of liability, because all members of each of the classes were \ninjured by the same policy and practices. \n155.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the classes are: \n1)  Whether the Districtโs practices and customs decribed herein violate the Constitution; \n2)  whether Named Plaintiffs and the members of the classes are entitled to equitable relief, \nand, if so, what is the nature of that relief; and \n3)  whether a jury can determine the general damages for an entire class using a damages \nmatrix on the basis of a trial using a sample of the class members. \n \n156.  Each of the classes is both so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. The \nexact number of the classes members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time, but the MPDโs website \nand its arrest booking database District of Columbia Superior Courtโs website show that hundreds \nand thousands of persons were stop, frisk and searched each year and the and online docketing \nsystem, CourtView, shows that each year over the last 3 years hundreds of people were arrested \nand prosecuted for violations of the Districtโs gun control regime. The NEAR Act data from about \nPage 25 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 26 of 28\nJuly 22 to August 18, 2019 provides further data about the Gun Recovery Unitโs stop, frisk and \nsearches of African Americans. \n157.  Mr. Crudup, Mr. Bell, and Mr. Burnsโ claims are typical of the claims of the other \nmembers of the classes of which they are members and all other members of the classes were \ninjured by exactly the same means, that is, by Districtโs enforcement of its unconstitutional gun \ncontrol regime. \n158.  Mr. Crudup, Mr. Bell, and Mr. Burns on behalf of themselves and each of the classes of \nwhich they are members will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the members of the \nclasses and have retained counsel who are competent and experienced in complex federal civil \nrights class action litigation and criminal defense law including the Districtโs unconstitutional gun \ncontrol regime. \n159.  Mr. Crudup, Mr. Bell, and Mr. Burns on behalf of themselves and each of the classes of \nwhich they are members have no interests that are contrary to or in conflict with those of the \nmembers of each of the classes of which they are members.  \nCLASS RELIEF DEMANDS \nMr. Crudup, Mr. Bell, and Mr. Burns as Named Plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and all \nother members of the classes of which they are members respectfully request that this Court grant \nthe following relief: \nA.  Enter judgment in their favor on all of their claims; \nB.

Plaintiffs, who are all Black males, seek to hold the MPD \nofficers individually liable, and the District municipally liable, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, for \nviolating Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights and for alleged injuries from the Districtโs so-called \nโstop and friskโ policy of searching young Black males for guns, without reasonable suspicion or \nprobable cause.  Defendants have moved to dismiss all claims.  Defs. Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. \n22.  For reasons set forth below, Defendantsโ motion to dismiss will be DENIED. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs claim that MPDโs Gun Recovery Unit (GRU), tasked with recovery of illegal \nfirearms and apprehending individuals involved in gun related crime, unlawfully targets \npredominately Black neighborhoods and young Black males specifically.  See Am. Compl. ยถยถ \nPage 1 of 25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 28   Filed 03/29/23   Page 2 of 25\n16โ19, 23, 27โ28, ECF No. 14.  They claim that the District has โestablished practices and \nprocedures of several armed officers surrounding Black suspects without reasonable suspicion of \na crimeโ to โintimidate suspects into consenting to a search that otherwise lacks reasonable \nsuspicion for a stop.โ  Id. ยถยถ 20โ21 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Plaintiffs further accuse \nthe GRU of โfabricating the reasonable suspicion or probable causeโ required to conduct a search \nor seizure.  Id. ยถ 22. \nPlaintiffs claim the GRU consists of twenty to thirty officers, one or more detectives, and \nthree sergeants, who report to the Narcotics and Special Investigations Division (NSID), which \nwas headed by former MPD Chief Peter Newsham when he was Assistant Chief.  Id. ยถยถ 5, 25โ\n26.  Plaintiffs allege that GRU officers are โhighly aggressiveโ and forceful in their policing \napproach and are โdeployed in a manner calculated to convey force and authority well beyond \nthat of an ordinary officer deployed in uniform.โ  Id. ยถยถ 33โ34.  GRU deploys โwith numerosity \nof force,โ they wear โtactical gearโ instead of a โstandard uniform,โ their โ[w]eapons are on \ndisplayโ when they engage with civilians, and they use โjump outsโ to convey force.  Id. ยถยถ 35โ\n38.  The GRU banner and flag displays an image of skull and crossbones with a โbullet hole \nquite literally, dead-center in the forehead of the skull, with two handguns and two handcuffs on \neither side above the head,โ and a ribbon that says, โVEST UP ONE IN THE CHAMBER.โ  Id. \nยถยถ 41โ48.  These images depict the GRUโs intentionally cultivated image, designed to โinflict \nterror on low-income communities of color,โ especially Black communities.  Id. ยถ 50.  The GRU \nofficers โcelebrate their abusive authority over young [B]lack men,โ as depicted by a MPD \nofficer t-shirt that says, in part, โLet me see that waistband joโ and has a Sun Cross, โa racist hate \nsymbol.โ  Id. ยถยถ 63โ69.  \nPage 2 of 25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 28   Filed 03/29/23   Page 3 of 25\nPlaintiffs allege that โ[a]s a matter of policy and practice, the GRU does not require its \nofficers to possess reasonable articulable suspicion in order to approach and engage civilians,โ \nand the policy is so โovert that it has been repeatedly acknowledged by District of Columbia \nCourts.โ  Id. ยถยถ 53โ58 (citing United States v. Gross, 784 F.3d 784, 789 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (J. \nBrown concurring); Robinson v. United States, 76 A.3d 329 (D.C. 2013)).  To the extent that \nofficers bother to โformulate a request for a search in words nominally providing cover as a \nconsensual request,โ suspects have โlittle choiceโ but to comply.  Am. Compl. ยถยถ 62, 70.  \nRefusing an officer can lead to โdangerous or forceful consequences,โ and ultimately the GRU \nโwill compel the search anyways justifying the compelled search based on natural reactions to \nthe aggressive officer approach or based on fabrications.โ  Id. ยถยถ 73โ74. \nPlaintiffs claim that in testimony before the D.C. Council on January 16, 2020, MPD \nSergeant Charlotte Djossou confirmed MPDโs policy, practice, or custom of racially targeting \nBlack men.  Id. ยถยถ 82, 84.  Sergeant Djossou testified that she reported NSIDโs โillegal tacticsโ to \nher supervisorsโincluding that officers were โviolating 4th Amendment rightsโโand was met \nwith retaliation.  Id. ยถ 85.  In June 2018, she escalated her complaints to then Assistant Chief \nRobert Contee, who also retaliated against her.  Id. ยถ 86.   \nPlaintiffs further claim that a June 13, 2018 GRU operation in the Deanwood \nneighborhood is an โillustrative exampleโ of the GRUโs โmodus operandi of stop and frisk.โ  Id. \nยถ 88.  They contend that on that day, the GRU โstaged a fake search and find operationโ on a \ngroup of Black men who were sitting outside a barbershop.  Id. ยถยถ 89, 91.  GRU officers \nsearched a man โwho was ostensibly a member of the group but was in fact a plant . . . so they \ncould find a gun and thus manufacture reasonable suspicion to search the other men.โ  Id. ยถ 91.   \nPage 3 of 25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 28   Filed 03/29/23   Page 4 of 25\nPlaintiffs allege that despite the fact that from 2013 to 2017 forty-seven percent of D.C.โs \npopulation was Black, Black individuals made up eighty-six percent of total arrestees, seventy-\neight percent of arrestees for driving without a permit, were arrested at ten times the rate of \nWhite individuals, and disproportionately arrested in over ninety percent of census tracts.  Id. ยถยถ \n120โ22.  Plaintiffs encountered difficulty ascertaining stop and frisk data because โMPD has \nsought to avoid disclosure even of basic statisticsโ regarding its stop and frisk practices, but โ[a]s \nadditional data has been produced from the Neighborhood Engagement Achieves Results \n(โNEARโ) Act of 2016, the racial disparity is clear.โ  Id. ยถยถ 95, 123.  Plaintiffs contend that the \nNEAR Act requires MPD to โcollect detailed and comprehensive data about stops and frisks the \npolice carry out on the streets of the District,โ including fourteen categories of data for every \nstop.  Id. ยถยถ 96โ98.  And they allege that to the extent NEAR Act data is available, it confirms \nโextraordinary racial disparities in the MPDโs stop and frisk practices,โ id. ยถ 110:  \nโข  From July 22, 2019 to August 18, 2019, ninety-three percent of frisks and eighty-seven \npercent of non-ticket (i.e., non-traffic) stops were conducted on Black individuals.  Id. ยถยถ \n113โ14.  \n \nโข  From July 22, 2019 to December 31, 2019, two White individuals were stopped and \nfrisked daily compared to forty-five Black individuals.  However, police discovered a gun \nin two percent of searches, and the gun recovery rate was the same regardless of whether \nthe individual being searched was Black or White.  Id. ยถ 123. \n \nโข  From August 1, 2019 to January 31, 2020, eighty-eight percent of documentable stops \nand ninety-four percent of documentable searches were of Black individuals.  Id. ยถ 115.  \n \nPlaintiffs also claim that television station WUSA9 and the American Civil Liberties Union have \nconducted their own analysis of NEAR Act data and/or body worn camera footage and โfound \nsimilar racial disparities in arrest dataโ going back as far as 2013.  Id. ยถยถ 117โ19.  On \ninformation and belief, Plaintiffs allege that โthe statistics for the GRUโs reported stops and frisk \nare even more extreme than the Department generally.โ  Id. ยถ 127. \nPage 4 of 25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 28   Filed 03/29/23   Page 5 of 25\nA.  Dalonta Crudup  \nPlaintiffs claim that on January 12, 2020, at around 11:30 p.m., Crudup was โwalking \naloneโ in the 2400 block of 14th Street, N.E., wearing a coat, a hooded sweatshirt, and a \nbackpack with one strap over his shoulder.  Id. ยถยถ 131, 133โ35.  Officers Choi, Minzak, Joseph, \nand Laury were driving an unmarked Chevy Malibu and approached Crudup from behind.  Id. ยถยถ \n136โ39.  The officers were not responding to a call but claim they were โseeking to match an \nindividual with a recently reported crimeโ when, after observing Crudup for only a โmoment,โ \nthey drove up behind him and โjumped out of their vehicle,โ dressed in โtactical gear and \ndisplay[ing] firearms and handcuffs.โ  Id. ยถยถ 140โ42, 144โ46. \nPlaintiffs claim that Crudup lifted โhis shirt and show[ed] his waistbandโ because Black \nmen in his neighborhood have no other choice when approached by GRU officers.  Id. ยถ148.  \nLaury asked Crudup, โโyou donโt got no weapons on you?โโ  Id. ยถ 149.  Crudup did not respond \nbut submitted to a visual search and noticed that the officers had โformed a semi-circle in front \nand around him.โ  Id. ยถยถ 149โ53.  Laury asked Crudup, โโNothing in your bag?โโ to which \nCrudup responded, โweed,โ and refused to give Laury permission to search his bag.  Id. ยถยถ 154โ\n57.  At this point, Crudup was no longer โfree to leave,โ but he nonetheless โpivoted and took \nsteps slowly backwards on the sidewalk away from the officers that were in the way of his path.โ  \nId. ยถยถ 158โ59.  Choi then โextended his arm to blockโ Crudupโs movement and continued to \nโintimidate[e]โ Crudup.  Id. ยถยถ 160โ61.  Choi asked if the officers could check for weapons and \nCrudup refused, but Laury โ[m]anufactur[ed] a basis to justifyโ a search and said, โโYou see the \nway you are acting is real strange, the way you are bent back across the fence back here.โโ  Id. ยถยถ \n163, 165.  \nHaving surrounded Crudup with โno objectively reasonable basis to suspect [he] was in \npossession of contraband,โ Officer Choi told Crudup that his backpack looked heavy.  Id. ยถยถ 166, \nPage 5 of 25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 28   Filed 03/29/23   Page 6 of 25\n168, 170.  Crudup responded by shaking his bag, and Choi said, โโI heard an object insideโโ and \nโtook the backpack and conducted an illegal search, a pat down of the exterior of the bag.โ  Id. \nยถยถ 170โ72.  Choi claimed to have felt more than two ounces of marijuana, searched the bag \nfurther, and found a pistol.  Id. ยถยถ 173โ75.   \nCrudup was presented in D.C. Superior Court on January 13, 2020, preventively \ndetained, and then released on High Intensity Supervision with GPS monitoring until March 3, \n2020, when the government dismissed the case.  Id. ยถยถ 176โ77.   \nPlaintiffs claim that the โfacts and the narrative the officers wove . . . in sworn statements \nand sworn testimony are fabrications.โ  Id. ยถ 179.  These allegedly false statements include \nChoiโs testimony at Crudupโs preliminary hearing that Crudupโs โactions in switching his \nbackpack to both shoulders was suspiciousโ and Choiโs Gerstein statement1 asserting that \nCrudupโs โactions in backing up to the fence was a cause of concern for the officers because he \nwas trying to hide his backpack.โ  Id. ยถยถ 182โ83.  \nB.  Dontrey Bell \nAccording to the Amended Complaint, at approximately 10:00 p.m. on April 29, 2019, \nOfficers Choi, Minzak, Anderson, and Rogers were driving, pulled into a parking lot at the 1500 \nblock of Butler Street, S.E., and saw a group of Black men standing in front of a building.  Id. ยถยถ \n190โ91. \nPlaintiffs reference the Gerstein in Bellโs case for the arresting officerโs version of \nevents: The officers got out of the car to โmake contact with the group,โ Bell โtook unprovoked \nflight up the stairsโ of the building and stopped at the top of the stairs.  Id. ยถยถ 192โ93.  Anderson \n \n1 Gerstein statements are usually prepared by an officer for use in pretrial detention decisions \nprior to a preliminary hearing.  Pretrial detention โtraditionally ha[s] been decided by a \nmagistrate in a non-adversary proceeding on hearsay and written testimonyโ using โinformal \nmodes of proof.โ  Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 120 (1975). \nPage 6 of 25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 28   Filed 03/29/23   Page 7 of 25\nasked him if he had any weapons, and officers then conducted a โpat down for weaponsโ because \nof Bellโs โnervousness.โ  Id. ยถยถ 193โ95.  During the pat down, Anderson โfelt a hard metal \nobjectโ in Bellโs pants pocket and recognized it as a firearm.  Id. ยถ 196.   \nPlaintiffs allege that the Gerstein is false and that there was no crowd when the officers \nexited their car, and Bell was โnowhere in sight.โ  Id. ยถยถ 197โ99.  Instead, when โGRU officers \nentered the building and ran up the steps,โ Bell was โat the top of the steps.โ  Id. ยถยถ 200โ01.  โHe \nwasnโt doing anything other than standing there,โ the โGRU officers surrounded himโ and \nโsearched him without his consent.โ  Id. ยถยถ 201โ03.   \nOn April 30, 2019, Bell was presented in D.C. Superior Court on a carrying a pistol \nwithout a license (โCPWLโ) charge, preventively detained based on Minzakโs Gerstein and \nreleased on High Intensity Supervision pending grand jury action.  Id. ยถยถ 205โ07.  The charges \nagainst him were dismissed on government motion on October 2, 2019.  Id. ยถ 209. \nC.  David Burns \nPlaintiffs claim that on February 12, 2018, at about 10:30 p.m., Burns and his girlfriend \nwere sitting in a car in a parking lot at the 2600 block of Douglas Pl., S.E.  Id. ยถ 210.  Burns was \nsmoking a cigarette when Officers Anderson, Henderson, Joseph, Wright, Ashley, and Hiller and \nDetective Del Po, driving in three cars, pulled into the lot.  Id. ยถ 212. \nPlaintiffs claim that Joseph approached the passenger side of Burnsโ car and โasked to see \ntheir waistbands.โ  Id.  ยถยถ 213โ15.  Before Burns or his girlfriend answered, Wright ordered \nBurns to step out of the car and opened the door.  Id.  ยถ 216.  โBurns reacted with puzzlement,โ \nand the officers concluded that they had a basis to seize Burns based on his โobvious \nnervousness and puzzlement,โ and Joseph and Wright โpulledโ Burns out of the car, searched \nhim, and recovered a firearm.

Superior Court on a CPWL charge, โpreventively detained . \n. . on the basis of the probable cause statement in the Gerstein,โ and the government dismissed \nthe indictment on April 8, 2018, after Burns filed a motion to suppress the firearm.  Id. ยถยถ 221โ\n23.  \nD.  Joevantae Ramsey \nPlaintiffs claim that on June 4, 2019, at around 2:00 p.m., Ramsey was standing on the \nsidewalk outside his home on Douglas Street N.E., talking on the phone.  Id. ยถยถ 230, 232.  \nOfficers Wright, Torres, and Tariq pulled up in front of his house in a white Chevy Impala, and \nan officer asked Ramsey โโWhatโs going on?โโ  Id. ยถยถ 233, 235.  Ramsey responded, โโNothing, I \nam going in the house.โโ  Id. ยถ 236.  As Ramsey walked into his house, the officers (in full \ntactical gear) exited their car and โrushedโ toward him, but he was able to enter his home and \nclose the door.  Id. ยถยถ 238โ39, 241.  The officers pushed the door open, forced themselves into \nthe home, discovered a firearm, and arrested Ramsey.  Id. ยถยถ 242โ45.   \nPlaintiffs claim the Gerstein falsely states that officers were pursuing a SUV with \nindividuals believed to have firearms, lost sight of the vehicle but believed โRamsey was one of \nthe individualsโ for whom they were searching.  Id. ยถยถ 256โ59.  Plaintiffs allege that the officers \nโforced their way into his house without a warrant and without any suspicion of a crimeโ based \non their โprior knowledgeโ of Ramsey.  Id. ยถยถ 260โ67.   \nRamsey was presented in D.C. Superior Court on June 5, 2019 and held without bond.  \nId. ยถยถ 247โ48.  He was ordered detained following a preliminary hearing on June 7, 2019 and \nPage 8 of 25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 28   Filed 03/29/23   Page 9 of 25\nwas indicted on September 25, 2019.  Id. ยถยถ 250, 252.  The government moved to dismiss the \nindictment on October 2, 2019, and Ramsey was released the same day.  Id. ยถยถ 254โ55.  He had \nbeen held for 119 days.  Id. ยถ 269.  \nPlaintiffs allege that in each of their cases, the GRUโs actions were โdone in accordance \nwith the custom, policy and procedures of MPD to manufacture suspicion and arrests of Black \nmen who otherwise were not engaged in suspicious activity.โ  Id. ยถยถ 189, 209, 229, 270.  \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nA motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) โtests the legal \nsufficiency of a complaint.โ  Browning v. Clinton, 292 F.3d 235, 242 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  To \nsurvive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain factual allegations that are โenough to \nraise a right to relief above the speculative level,โ and must โstate a claim to relief that is \nplausible on its face.โ  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 570 (2007).  The \nโplausibility standard is not akin to a โprobability requirement,โ but it asks for more than a sheer \npossibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.โ  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  \nWhen considering a motion under Rule 12(b)(6), a court must construe the complaint in the light \nmost favorable to the plaintiffs and โmust assume the truth of all well-pleaded allegations.โ  \nWarren v. District of Columbia, 353 F.3d 36, 39 (D.C. Cir. 2004).   \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nA.  Defendantsโ Exhibits \nIn considering a motion to dismiss, a court โmay consider only the facts alleged in the \ncomplaint, any documents either attached to or incorporated in the complaint and matters of \nwhich we may take judicial notice.โ  E.E.O.C. v. St. Francis Xavier Parochial Sch., 117 F.3d \n621, 624 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  โ[T]o go beyond testing the adequacy of the allegations of the \ncomplaint, a district court must follow the procedures for converting a motion to dismiss into one \nPage 9 of 25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 28   Filed 03/29/23   Page 10 of 25\nfor summary judgment.โ  Hurd v. District of Columbia, Govโt, 864 F.3d 671, 686โ87 (D.C. Cir. \n2017).  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(d) states:  \nIf, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are \npresented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one \nfor summary judgment under Rule 56.  All parties must be given a reasonable \nopportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.   \nThe D.C. Circuit has warned โthat the conversion by the district judgeโ of a 12(b)(6) motion to \none for summary judgment โshould be exercised with great caution and attention to the partiesโ \nprocedural rights.โ  Hurd, 864 F.3d at 687 (citation omitted).  \n  Defendants have attached three exhibits to their motion to dismiss: (1) the Gerstein \nstatement for Crudup signed by Choi, Defs. Ex. 1, ECF No. 22-2; (2) the Gerstein statement for \nBell signed by Minzak, Defs. Ex. 2, ECF No. 22-3; and (3) the Gerstein statement for Burns \nsigned by Anderson, Defs. Ex. 3, ECF No. 22-4.  Although Plaintiffs did not attach the Gersteins \nas exhibits to their Complaint, they allege that the facts attested to in the Gersteins for each \nPlaintiff are false.  See Am. Compl. ยถยถ 179, 197, 224, 260.  Defendants suggest that the court can \nconsider their exhibitsโwithout converting their 12(b)(6) motion into a summary judgment \nmotionโbecause their authenticity is not disputed, they are โofficial public records,โ they are \nโcentralโ to Plaintiffsโ claims, and they are โsufficiently referred to in the complaint.โ  Defs. \nMem. at 9, ECF No. 22-1 (quoting Newman v. Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc., 901 F.3d 19, 25 (1st \nCir. 2018)).  Plaintiffs counter that the court ought not consider Defendantsโ extrinsic evidence \non a motion to dismiss.  They argue that although they referenced the Gersteins in their \nAmended Complaint, the Gersteins were not โcentral to their claims or as presenting the truth.โ  \nPls. Oppโn at 4, ECF No. 24.  They referenced the Gersteins merely to โdraw attention to the \nfalse statements . . . and in doing so, ple[a]d the averments therein to be disputed.โ  Id. at 4.  \nPage 10 of 25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 28   Filed 03/29/23   Page 11 of 25\nThe court agrees with Plaintiffs and will not consider Defendantsโ exhibits in assessing \nthe sufficiency of the allegations in the Amended Complaint.  See Menoken v. Dhillon, 975 F.3d \n1, 8 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (finding that the district court โerred by relying on two documents outside \nthe complaint as dispositive evidence of the nature of [plaintiffโs] accommodation request.โ); see \nalso Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc., 899 F.3d 988, 1003 (9th Cir. 2018) (holding that โit is \nimproper to assume the truth of an incorporated document if such assertions only serve to dispute \nfacts stated in a well-pleaded complaintโ).  Even were the court to consider the proffered \nexhibits, the courtโs ruling would remain unchanged.  Plaintiffs have alleged that these \nstatements are false, and in considering a motion to dismiss, the court accepts Plaintiffsโ factual \nallegations as true.  See Menoken, 975 F.3d at 8.  \nB.  Individual Fourth Amendment Claims  \nThe Fourth Amendment protects โ[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, \nhouses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.โ  U.S. Const. amend IV.  \nAlthough warrantless searches are presumptively unreasonable, see Katz v. United States, 389 \nU.S. 347, 357 (1967), a police officer may briefly stop someone to investigate if the officer \nโobserves unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that \ncriminal activity may be afoot,โ Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 30 (1968).  Terry stops must be based \non โreasonable suspicionโ that is a โparticularized and objective basis for suspecting the \nparticular person stopped of breaking the law.โ  Heien v. North Carolina, 574 U.S. 54, 60 (2014) \n(quotation marks and citation omitted); see United States v. Abdus-Price, 518 F.3d 926, 929 \n(D.C. Cir. 2008).  An officer may โconduct a patdown to find weapons that he reasonably \nbelieves or suspects are then in the possession of the person he has accostedโ for โhis own \nprotection and safety,โ but he may not conduct โa generalized cursory search for weapons.โ  \nYbarra v. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85, 93โ94 (1979) (quotation marks and citation omitted).   \nPage 11 of 25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 28   Filed 03/29/23   Page 12 of 25\nPlaintiffs claim the individual Defendants violated Plaintiffsโ Fourth Amendment rights \nto be free from unreasonable searches or seizures by stopping and searching them without \nreasonable suspicion and acting with deliberate indifference.  See Am. Compl. ยถยถ 308, 310, 315, \n317, 322, 324, 329, 331.   \n1.  Claim III: Crudupโs Claims Against Officers Choi, Joseph, Laury, and \nMinzak  \nDefendants argue that the MPD officers had reasonable suspicion to search Crudup \nbecause (1) he was in a โhigh crime area,โ (2) he admitted that he had marijuana in his backpack, \nand (3) Choi could tell there was a heavy object inside the bag when Crudup shook it.  Defs. \nMem. at 12โ14.2 \nThe Supreme Court has held that mere presence in a high crime neighborhood, without \nmore, cannot establish reasonable suspicion to conduct a Terry stop.  See Brown v. Texas, 443 \nU.S. 47, 52 (1979).  And under D.C. law it is legal for anyone older than twenty-one to possess \nup to two ounces of marijuana for personal use.  See D.C. Code ยง 48-904.01.  Accordingly, the \nfacts allegedโthat Crudup was in a high crime neighborhood, admitted to having marijuana in \nhis bag, and an object inside his bag made a soundโcannot form the basis for reasonable \nsuspicion that Crudup was involved in criminal activity.  C.f., Gordon v. United States, 120 A.3d \n73, 83 (D.C. 2015) (explaining that โthe government implicitly acknowledgesโ that the smell of \nburnt marijuana in a high crime area, coupled with loitering in an area in which the defendant did \nnot live, is not enough to provide reasonable suspicion of criminal activity in the District of \n \n2 Several of Defendantsโ arguments are based on information in their exhibits.  See e.g., Defs. \nMem at 12 (citing Defs. Ex. 1 at 1 (alleging that Crudup โswitched the location of his backpack \nfrom the front of his body to over both of his shouldersโ)).  Because the court accepts, for \npurposes of this motion, the allegations pleaded in the Complaint as true and will not consider \nDefendantsโ exhibits, see Supra Section III.A, it likewise will not consider Defendantsโ \narguments that are based solely on their own exhibits.  \nPage 12 of 25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 28   Filed 03/29/23   Page 13 of 25\nColumbia).  Consequently, Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded that Defendants did not have \nreasonable suspicion to stop and search Crudup.  \n2.  Claim IV: Bellโs Claims Against Officers Choi, Anderson, Rogers, and \nMinzak \nDefendants argue that they were justified in stopping and searching Bell because of his \nunprovoked flight up the stairs, see Defs. Mem. at 16, but Plaintiffs plead that the officersโ sworn \nstatements that Bell fled up the stairs are โfabrications,โ Am. Compl. ยถยถ 192โ97.  \nPlaintiffs claim Bell was already at the top of the stairs of the Butler Street building when \nofficers approached, and โwasnโt doing anything other than standing there.โ  Id. ยถ 201.  They \nallege that the officers โsurroundedโ Bell, โbacked him against the wall,โ and then โsearched him \nwithout his consent.โ  Id. ยถยถ 202โ03.  Assuming the truth of these allegations, as the court must, \nDefendants did not have reasonable suspicion that Bell was engaged in criminal activity, nor did \nthey have a reasonable basis to be concerned for their safety.  Consequently, Plaintiffs have \npleaded sufficient facts to establish that Bell was unlawfully stopped and searched.  \n3.  Claim V: Burnsโ Claims Against Officers Joseph and Wright \nAgain citing only to facts provided in their exhibits, Defendants argue that โ[w]hen \nexamined in totality, Burnsโ actions gave the officers sufficient suspicion to stop and search him \nfor weapons.โ  Defs. Mem. at 16โ17 (citing Defs. Ex. 3).  But on a motion to dismiss, the court \nassesses only whether the plaintiff has pleaded sufficient facts to state a claim, and Plaintiffs \nclaim that Burns was merely sitting in a car with his girlfriend smoking a cigarette when Joseph \napproached the passenger side of the vehicle and asked if there were weapons inside.  See Am. \nCompl. ยถยถ 210โ14.  Wright then approached the car, ordered Burns to step out, and proceeded to \nopen the door.  See id. ยถยถ 216โ17.  Plaintiffs allege that at this point, Burns reacted with \nโpuzzlement.โ Id. ยถ 218.   \nPage 13 of 25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 28   Filed 03/29/23   Page 14 of 25\nDefendants argue that โwhen the officers askedโ Burns if he โwould mind if they checked \nthe carโ he โbecame visibly nervous,โ which justified the stop under Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 \nU.S. 119, 125 (2000).  Defs. Mem. at 16.  But in Wardlow, the Supreme Court found that โit was \nnot merely respondentโs presence in an area of heavy narcotics trafficking that aroused the \nofficersโ suspicion, but his unprovoked flight upon noticing the police. . . . [N]ervous, evasive \nbehavior is a pertinent factor in determining reasonable suspicion.  Headlong flightโwherever it \noccursโis the consummate act of evasion.โ  Id. at 124 (internal citations omitted).  There is no \nallegation that Burns was in a high drug trafficking area, he did not flee upon seeing the officers, \nand while his โpuzzledโ reaction may be a pertinent factorโthough he may well have been \npuzzled upon being told to exit his vehicle under those circumstancesโit was not, without more, \nenough to constitute reasonable suspicion that he was engaged in criminal activity.  Plaintiffs \nhave therefore pleaded sufficient facts to establish that Defendants did not have reasonable \nsuspicion to stop and search Burns.   \n4.  Claim VI: Ramseyโs Fourth Amendment Claim Against Wright, Torres, and \nTariq \nDefendants, relying almost exclusively on Tariqโs Gerstein, argue that the officers were \nsearching for individuals with weapons who had been in an SUV, and that โRamseyโs actions \ngave the officers sufficient suspicion to stop and search him.โ  Defs. Mem. at 17.  But, as noted \nabove, the court cannot consider Defendantsโ proffered Gerstein statements.  Defendants also \nargue that exigent circumstances allowed them to enter Ramseyโs home without a warrant \nbecause โofficers could reasonably believe that if they did not pursue Ramsey into the home and \nsearch him, Ramsey could destroy evidence.โ  Defs. Mem. at 18 (citing United States v. Johnson, \n802 F. 2d 1459, 1462 (D.C. Cir. 1986)).  This argument presupposes that the officers had \nPage 14 of 25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 28   Filed 03/29/23   Page 15 of 25\nreasonable suspicion that Ramsey was one of the individuals for whom they were searching, but, \nassuming the truth of the facts alleged in the Complaint, the court cannot draw this inference. \nIn Johnson, the D.C. Circuit reaffirmed that โ[w]arrantless entry of premises is justified \nonly when exigent circumstances make an immediate search imperative,โ and in determining if \nthose circumstances exist, the court must consider โwhether the police had an urgent need or an \nimmediate major crisis in the performance of duty affording neither time nor opportunity to \napply to a magistrate.โ  802 F.2d at 1461 (internal quotations marks and citations omitted).  In \nJohnson, the Court found exigent circumstances where the police were searching for narcotics, \nthe defendant was observed dropping a brown paper bag from an apartment window to a lower \nportion of the roof, then went inside and closed the window despite the officerโs order not to \nmove.  Id.  Thus, the officers had a reasonable, โcommon senseโ belief that the defendant might \ndestroy evidence.  Id.  Here, Plaintiffs allege that Ramsey was merely present outside his \nresidence and decided that he did not want to engage with the police officers; there were no \nexigent circumstances to justify forcibly entering his home and searching him.  Consequently, \nPlaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to establish that Ramseyโs Fourth Amendment rights were \nviolated. \n5.  Qualified Immunity on Individual Claims  \nThe Civil Rights Act of 1871 provides: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or \nusage, of any State or Territory, or the District of Columbia, subjects or causes \nto be subjected, any citizen of the United States . . . to the deprivation of any \nrights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, be liable \nto the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding \nfor redress. \n42. U.S.C. ยง 1983.  Although Section 1983, on its face, does not provide government officials \nimmunity, the Supreme Court has held that โcertain government officialsโ have โeither absolute \nPage 15 of 25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 28   Filed 03/29/23   Page 16 of 25\nor qualified immunity from suit.โ  Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U.S. 158, 163 (1992).  Qualified immunity \nprotects โall but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the lawโ from Section \n1983 claims.  City of Tahlequah, Oklahoma v. Bond, 142 S. Ct. 9, 11 (2021) (quoting District of \nColumbia v. Wesby, 138 S. Ct. 577, 589 (2018)).  In determining if officials are protected by \nqualified immunity, the court looks to: (1) whether the officials โviolated a federal statutory or \nconstitutional right,โ and (2) whether โthe unlawfulness of their conduct was clearly established \nat the time.โ  Wesby, 138 S. Ct. at 589 (quotation marks and citation omitted).  A clearly \nestablished right is one that is โsufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have \nunderstood that what he is doing violates that right.โ  Reichle v. Howards, 566 U.S. 658, 664 \n(2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Once a defendant asserts a qualified immunity \ndefense, the plaintiff โhas the โburden to show that the particular right in question was clearly \nestablishedโโ at the time of the violation.  Daugherty v. Sheer, 891 F.3d 386, 390 (D.C. Cir. \n2018) (quoting Dukore v. District of Columbia, 799 F.3d 1137, 1145 (D.C. Cir. 2015)). \nShowing that the unlawfulness of an officerโs actions is clearly established โdoes not \nโrequire a case directly on point.โโ  Id. (quoting Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 741 (2011)).  \nโRegardless of whether a court expressly has declared certain conduct unlawful, a government \nofficial is not entitled to qualified immunity where every reasonable official would have \nunderstood that what he is doing violates the right.โ  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted).  Indeed, the Supreme Court has acknowledged that โthere can be the rare โobvious \ncase,โ where the unlawfulness of the officerโs conduct is sufficiently clear even though existing \nprecedent does not address similar circumstances.โ  Wesby, 138 S. Ct. at 590 (quoting Brosseau \nv. Haugen, 543 U.S. 194, 199 (2004) (per curiam)).   \nPage 16 of 25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 28   Filed 03/29/23   Page 17 of 25\nDefendants argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity because the unlawfulness of \ntheir actions is not clearly established, see Defs. Mem. at 38โ40, and because Plaintiffs did not \nrespond to their qualified immunity argument, see Defs. Reply at 20โ21, ECF No. 25.  The court \ndisagrees.  \nPlaintiffs allege that they were minding their own business and not engaging in any \nconduct that would give rise to suspicion of criminal activity, see supra Section III.B.1โ4, and \nthe individual Defendants nonetheless stopped them, searched them, and prepared false Gersteins \nto cover up the unlawful stops and searches.  These allegations set forth the kind of conduct \nagainst which the Fourth Amendment protects: a โgeneralized cursory search for weaponsโ \nwhere no probable cause exists.  Ybarra, 444 U.S. at 93โ96 (quotation marks and citation \nomitted).  In Ybarra, the officers had a warrant to search a tavern and the tavern bartender for \nnarcotics.  Id. at 88.  Operating under an Illinois statute authorizing officers to โdetain and search \nany person found on premises being searched pursuant to a search warrant,โ the officers twice \nsearched Ybarra, who โmade no gestures indicative of criminal conduct, made no movements \nthat might suggest an attempt to conceal contraband, and said nothing of a suspicious nature.โ  \nId. at 87, 91.  Ultimately, the Supreme Court held that the search of Ybarra was unconstitutional \nbecause the officers had no reasonable suspicion that โhe was armed and presently dangerous,โ \nnor probable cause that he was committing a crime.  Id. at 92โ93. \nHere, as in Ybarra, there were no โarticulable factsโ arousing suspicion โthat criminal \nactivity [was] afoot.โ  Terry, 392 U.S. at 21, 30.  Although Plaintiffs do not cite any precedent \nsquarely demonstrating that the unlawfulness of individual Defendantsโ conduct was clearly \nestablished, it defies credulity that a law enforcement officer would not know that stopping and \nsearching a citizen with no reasonable articulable suspicion or probable cause was plainly \nPage 17 of 25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 28   Filed 03/29/23   Page 18 of 25\nunlawful.  Moreover, Plaintiffsโ allegation that the officers then swore to Gersteins they knew \nwere false supports the inference that the officers were aware that they had violated a clearly \nestablished right.  Under the circumstances Plaintiffs allege, the โlaw [is] sufficiently clear that \nevery reasonable official would understand that what he is doing is unlawful,โ Wesby, 138 S. Ct. \nat 589 (quotation marks and citation omitted), and consequently the officers are not entitled to \nqualified immunity. \nC.  Municipal Liability \n1.  Claim I: Fourth Amendment Violations  \nMunicipal liability on a Section 1983 claim is only appropriate where a plaintiff can \ndemonstrate that a government policy or custom was the โmoving forceโ behind the alleged \nconstitutional injury.  Monell v. Depโt of Soc. Servs. of City of N.Y., 436 U.S. 658, 690โ91, 694 \n(1978).  To state a claim for municipal liability, plaintiffs must state (1) โa predicate \nconstitutional violationโ and (2) โthat a custom or policy of the municipality caused the \nviolation.โ  Baker v. District of Columbia, 326 F.3d 1302, 1306 (D.C. Cir. 2003).  There are four \nways to identify an official municipal policy: (1) โthe explicit setting of a policy by the \ngovernment,โ (2) โthe action of a policy maker within the government,โ (3) โadoption through a \nknowing failure to act by a policy maker of actions by his subordinates that are so consistent that \nthey have become โcustom,โโ and (4) โfailure of the government to respond to a need (for \nexample, training of employees) in such a manner as to show โdeliberate indifferenceโ to the risk \nthat not addressing the need will result in constitutional violations.โ  Id. (internal citations \nomitted).  Each theory has its โown elementsโ which must be established by plaintiffโs \nallegations.  Blue v. District of Columbia, 811 F.3d 14, 20 (D.C. Cir. 2015), cert. denied, 137 S. \nCt. 77 (2016).  \nPage 18 of 25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 28   Filed 03/29/23   Page 19 of 25\nDefendants argue that Plaintiffsโ Claim I does not satisfy any of the four Baker prongs, \nand Plaintiffs respond that they have adequately pleaded at least three.  The court finds that \nPlaintiffs have at least pleaded Baker prongs three and four.  Accordingly, the court need not \naddress whether Plaintiffs have satisfied the elements of alternative municipal liability theories.  \nSee Goodwin v. District of Columbia, 579 F. Supp. 3d 159, 168 (D.D.C. 2022) (โA showing \nunder any of these four theories suffices to sustain a claim on Monell liability.โ (citation \nomitted)).  \ni.  Knowing Failure to Act \nTo establish a knowing failure to act by a policy maker, Plaintiffs must show that a \nโDistrict policymakerโs ignoring of a practice was โconsistent enough to constitute custom.โโ \nHarvey v. District of Columbia, 798 F.3d 1042, 1052โ53 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting Warren v. \nDistrict of Columbia, 353 F.3d 36, 39 (D.C. Cir. 2004)).  To clear this high hurdle, plaintiffs \nordinarily base โcustom or practiceโ liability on allegations of โpractices so persistent and \nwidespread as to practically have the force of law.โ  Page v. Mancuso, 999 F. Supp. 2d 269, 284 \n(D.D.C. 2013) (quoting Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. 51, 61 (2011)).  Plaintiffs must also \nshow that the policymaker at least had constructive knowledge of the alleged constitutional \nviolations, see Baker, 326 F.3d at 1306โ07, and officers acted pursuant to the custom or policy, \nsee Page, 999 F. Supp. 2d at 284.  \nPlaintiffs plead numerous facts asserting that District policymakers either knew or should \nhave known that the GRU was engaged in widespread Fourth Amendment violations.  Plaintiffs \nallege that MPD Sergeant Djossou complained to her command staff that โNSID officers at roll \ncall were openly conversing about ways to violate [body worn camera] orders/directives,โ and \ntestified at a January 16, 2020 D.C. Council hearing that NSID used โillegal tacticsโ and was \nviolating individualsโ Fourth Amendment rights, and that then Assistant Chief Contee retaliated \nPage 19 of 25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 28   Filed 03/29/23   Page 20 of 25\nagainst her for reporting that โlarge groups of peopleโ were being targeted โwithout probable \ncause.โ  Am. Compl. ยถยถ 82โ89.  Moreover, Plaintiffs point to the D.C. Court of Appealsโ \ndecision in Robinson v. United States, 76 A.3d 329 (D.C. 2013) (internal citations omitted), as \nproviding notice to Defendants that at least one GRU officer had targeted civilians for unlawful \nsearches without reasonable articulable suspicion.  Am. Compl. ยถยถ 57, 76, 78.  In Robinson, \nwhich also involved the GRU, the D.C. Court of Appeals found that  \nOfficer Katz admitted he and his colleagues had no particularized information that \nMr. Robinson might be carrying a gun when they entered the area, and Officer Katz \ndeveloped no such thought until after he asked if Mr. Robinson had a gun and he \nobserved  Mr.  Robinson  engage  in  conduct[โback  and  forth  or  side  to  side \nmovement on the outside of Robinsonโs jacket in front of his chest areaโ]which, \nas we have explained, did not give rise to reasonable, articulable suspicion that Mr. \nRobinson was armed and dangerous. \n76 A.3d at 340.  Furthermore, Plaintiffs claim the GRU openly displayed flags, banners, and t-\nshirts, depicting or alluding to their reputation for stopping and searching residents of the areas in \nwhich they operated, see Am. Compl. ยถยถ 41โ43, 51, 64 (showing photographs of these items), \nwhich would establish that policymakers were aware of their practices.  Lastly, Plaintiffs have \nalleged causal links between the GRUโs unconstitutional practices and the injuries Plaintiffs \nsuffered from their interactions with the individual Defendants.  See Am. Compl. ยถยถ 189, 209, \n229, 270.  \nii.  Failure to Train as to Show Deliberate Indifference \nA municipality can be held liable for its โdecision not to train certain employees about \ntheir legal duty to avoid violating citizensโ rights.โ  Connick, 563 U.S. at 61.  To establish \nliability, a plaintiff must show that โin light of the duties assigned to specific officers or \nemployees the need for more or different training is so obvious, and the inadequacy so likely to \nresult in the violation of constitutional rights, that the policymakers of the city can reasonably be \nsaid to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.โ  City of Canton, Ohio v. Harris, 489 U.S. \nPage 20 of 25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 28   Filed 03/29/23   Page 21 of 25\n378, 390 (1989).  Because a โmunicipalityโs culpability for a deprivation of rights is at its most \ntenuous where a claim turns on a failure to train,โ a plaintiff needs to show โpractices so \npersistent and widespread as to practically have the force of law.โ  Connick, 563 U.S. at 61 \n(citation omitted).  At the motion to dismiss stage, a plaintiff must allege specific facts that \nwould show deliberate indifference toward constitutional violations on the part of the municipal \nofficers responsible for the policy, ordinance, custom, decision, or absence of policy.  See Bd. of \nCty. Commโrs of Bryan Cty., Okl. v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 411 (1997).  โDeliberate indifference \nis determined by analyzing whether the municipality knew or should have known of the risk of \nconstitutional violations, an objective standard.โ  Baker, 326 F.3d at 1307 (citing Farmer v. \nBrennan, 511 U.S. 825, 841 (1994)).  \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot proceed on their failure to train theory because \nthey have not shown: โ(1) a pattern of similar constitutional violations, (2) that the final \npolicymaker was aware of the pattern of similar constitutional violations, and (3) that the final \npolicymaker failed to properly train employees despite awareness of the constitutional \nviolations.โ  Defs. Mem. at 32.  This argument is unavailing in light of โ[P]laintiffsโ many well-\npleaded allegations supporting their assertion of municipal liability against the District.โ  \nGoodwin, 579 F. Supp. 3d at 169. \nThe court has found that Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that policymakers either knew \nor should have known of the GRUโs unconstitutional โstop and friskโ practices.  See Supra \nSection III.C.1.i.  Plaintiffs also claim that they were searched by GRU officers without \nreasonable suspicion, that the District provided โinadequate screening, training and supervision \nof the GRU,โ and that their injuries are a direct result of that failure to train.  Am. Compl. ยถยถ \n274โ79.  Because Plaintiffs have stated predicate Fourth Amendment violations, see supra \nPage 21 of 25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 28   Filed 03/29/23   Page 22 of 25\nSection III. B., and pleaded sufficient facts to establish that the District knew or should have \nknown that GRU officers routinely violated citizensโ Fourth Amendment rights, Plaintiffs have \nmade out a claim for municipal liability based on failure to train.  Therefore, Defendantsโ motion \nto dismiss as to Claim I is denied.  See Matthews v. District of Columbia, 730 F. Supp. 2d 33, 38 \n(D.D.C. 2010) (holding that โgiven the variety of abuses, the number of officers, and time period \nduring which these abuses allegedly took place, plaintiffs have raised an inference that the \ncombination of these factors can demonstrate that the District of Columbia was deliberately \nindifferent to plaintiff's constitutional rights.โ (internal punctuation and citation omitted)); \nMoreno v. District of Columbia, 925 F. Supp. 2d 93, 101 (D.D.C. 2013) (holding that plaintiff \nstated a failure to train claim where the District failed to address plaintiffโs โspecific \nallegationsโ).   \n2.  Claim II: Equal Protection and Due Process Violations \nThe Equal Protection Clause applies to the District of Columbia via the Fifth \nAmendment, see Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 (1954), and requires state actors to treat \nsimilarly situated persons alike, see City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, \n439 (1985).  โThe central purpose of the Equal Protection Clause . . . is the prevention of official \nconduct discriminating on the basis of race.โ  Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239 (1976).  \nWhen legislation or official action explicitly draws classifications on the basis of race, โno \ninquiry into legislative purpose is necessary,โ and strict scrutiny applies.  Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 \nU.S. 541, 546 (1999).  However, when the official action is facially neutral, a trial court must \nโperform a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be \navailable.โ  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \nTo prevail on an equal protection claim, a plaintiff must allege more than โracially \ndisproportionate impactโโโ[p]roof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required.โ  \nPage 22 of 25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 28   Filed 03/29/23   Page 23 of 25\nVill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265 (1977).  A plaintiff can \nshow discriminatory intent or purpose by presenting โevidence of discriminatory intent in the \npolic[yโs] enactmentโ or โa current pattern of disparate outcomes from which unconstitutional \ndiscriminatory intent could be inferred.โ  In re Navy Chaplaincy, 738 F.3d 425, 429 (D.C. Cir. \n2013).  But โ[a]bsent a pattern as stark as that in Gomillion or Yick Wo, impact alone is not \ndeterminative.โ  Id. (quoting Vill. of Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266); see Gomillion v. \nLightfoot, 364 U.S. 339 (1960); Yick Wo. v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 373โ74 (1886). \nIn Yick Wo, the Supreme Court held that a facially neutral law granting a board of \nsupervisors โnaked and arbitrary powerโ to determine who could operate certain laundry \nbusinesses violated the Equal Protection Clause because its effect was to prevent 200 Chinese \npersons from obtaining necessary permits, while eighty non-Chinese individuals were able to \nobtain permits.  118 U.S. at 366, 373โ74.  Similarly, in Gomillion, the Supreme Court held that \nplaintiffs had properly stated a claim where the challenged redistricting law had the effect of \nremoving all but four or five of 400 Black voters from Tuskegeeโs city boundaries โwhile not \nremoving a single [W]hite voter or resident.โ  364 U.S. at 341โ42.  \nPlaintiffs argue that they have sufficiently alleged discriminatory intent by offering \nstatistical comparisons of the rates of stops and arrests for Black individuals versus White \nindividuals in the District.  See Pls.โ Oppโn at 39 (citing Marshall v. Columbia Lea Regโl Hosp., \n345 F.3d 1157, 1168 (10th Cir. 2003)).   \nIn Marshall, the Tenth Circuit explained that Section 1983 claims are often โbased on \nstatistical comparisons between the number of black or other minority Americans stopped or \narrested and their percentage in some measure of the relevant population.โ  345 F.3d at 1168.  It \nnoted that reliance on statistical evidence to show discriminatory intent โrequires a reliable \nPage 23 of 25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 28   Filed 03/29/23   Page 24 of 25\nmeasure of the demographics of the relevant population, a means of telling whether the data \nrepresent similarly situated individuals, and a point of comparison to the actual incidence of \ncrime among different racial or ethnic segments of the population.โ  Id. (citing United States v. \nArmstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 469โ70 (1996); Chavez v. Illinois State Police, 251 F.3d 612, 640โ45 \n(7th Cir. 2001)).  \nHere, Plaintiffs have alleged statistics of the type described in Marshall, showing the \ndisparities between MPDโs arrest and stop rates of White individuals versus Black individuals.  \nThey allege that ninety-three percent of stop and frisks and eighty-seven percent of non-traffic \nstops were of Black individuals, Black individuals were disproportionately arrested in ninety \npercent of census tracts and were arrested at ten times the rate of White individuals, and MPD \nsearches were more likely to be conducted in Wards 7 and 8.  See Am. Compl. ยถยถ 110, 113โ14, \n120โ21.  Moreover, Plaintiffs have alleged that the GRU โis not deployed generally throughout \nall neighborhoods of Washington, D.C., which has a population that is approximately 43% \nWhite.  The GRU is mainly deployed in Black or African-American neighborhoods.โ  Id. ยถ 17.  \nThese statistics demonstrate a pattern of behavior from which an unconstitutional policy of \ndiscriminatory intent or purpose can be inferred. \nIn Smith v. Henderson, 982 F. Supp. 2d 32, 50 (D.D.C. 2013), the court examined \ncircumstances similar to those alleged here and found that the plaintiff had properly alleged an \nequal protection claim because the โlegal and factual allegations [] track the holdings of Yick Wo \nand Gomillion.โ  Smith involved the closure of fifteen public schools in the District, all of them \nin โmajority-minority neighborhoods east of Rock Creek Park,โ where โresidents are generally \npoorer and overwhelmingly black and Hispanic.โ  Id. at 39.  Plaintiff also alleged that no schools \nin majority-White parts of the city were closed.  See id.  \nPage 24 of 25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 28   Filed 03/29/23   Page 25 of 25\nHere too, Plaintiffs have pleaded โa pattern as stark as that in Gomillion or Yick Wo;โ \nconsequently, their equal protection claim survives.  In re Navy Chaplaincy, 738 F.3d at 429; see \nSmith, 982 F. Supp. 2d 32, 50 (D.D.C. 2013).   \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nHaving found that Plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts at this juncture to state their \nclaims, the court will therefore DENY Defendantsโ Motion to Dismiss: ECF No. 22.  \n \nDated: March 29, 2023 \n \nTanya S.

The MPDโs Gun Recovery Unit (GRU) operates with an asserted purpose of removing \nillegal firearms from the streets of the District of Columbia. \n17.  The GRU, however, is not  deployed generally throughout  all neighborhoods of \nWashington, D.C., which has a residential population that is approximately 43% White. The \nGRU is mainly deployed in Black or African-American neighborhoods. \n18.  While communities in D.C., understandably seek relief and protection from gun \nrelated  violence,  the  predominantly  Black  neighborhoods  targeted  by  the  GRU  find \nthemselves burdened by another armed force operating lawlessly and terrorizing civilians, the \nMPDโs own Gun Recovery Unit. \n19.  The District, through the GRU and in its zeal to find and confiscate illegal guns, has \nprosecuted a war on the African American citizens in the District, especially young African \nAmerican men. \n20.  The District, through the GRU, established practices and procedures of several armed \nofficers surrounding African American suspects without reasonable suspicion of a crime.   \n21.  This illegal policy attempts to intimidate suspects into โconsentingโ to a search that otherwise \n \n5 \n\n \nCa se 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 6 of 46\nlacks reasonable suspicion for a stop. \n22.  Moreover, the GRU also carries out its mission by fabricating the reasonable suspicion \nor probable cause required by the Constitution to stop and frisk or search people whom the \nGRU encounters. \nGUN RECOVERY UNIT \n23.  The GRU is a special MPD police unit that focuses on the interdiction and recovery \nof illegal firearms, and the apprehension of individuals involved in illegal gun crime. The \nGRUโs stated mission is to remove firearms from the streets of the District of Columbia, \nbefore they can be used in a violent crime. \n24.  As detailed herein, its approaches to citizens are aggressive. \n25.  The GRU consists at any one time of twenty to thirty officers and one or more \ndetectives and about three sergeants. \n26.  The GRU reports to the Narcotics and Special Investigations Division (NSID). NSID \nfalls under the Investigative Services Bureau which was headed by Chief Peter Newsham \nwhen he was Assistant Chief. \n27.  The  District  of  Columbia  does  not  deploy  the  GRU  uniformly  across  the \nneighborhoods of the District of Columbia. \n28.  As a matter of policy, practice and/or custom, the GRU discriminatorily targets \nneighborhoods in which African-Americans or persons of color predominantly reside. \n29.  In a related matter, in connection with โFelon In Possessionโ gun prosecutions, \nMayor Muriel E. Bowser and D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham working with then U.S. \nAttorney for the District of Columbia jointly rolled out an initiative in February, 2019, to \nprosecute certain gun offenses in federal court, which would subject defendants to much \n \n6 \n\n \nCa se 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 7 of 46\nmore severe penalties than if prosecuted in local courts. As it turns out, the โcitywideโ \ninitiative, by design, targeted only predominantly Black neighborhoods (i.e., Police District \n5, 6, or 7). This targeting was nominally justified by federal authorities as โfocusing on the \nMPD districts that had the highest incidents of violent crime.โ Declaration of John Crabb, \nJr. at 4, United States v. John Victor Reed, No. 19-cr-00093 (D.D.C. July 3, 2020), ECF No. \n48-3. In reality, this was a race-based discriminatory deployment of law enforcement \nresources. \n30.  District of Columbia officials, after over a year of such prosecutions now assert that \nthey  are  shocked  to  learn  that  communities  of  color  were  discriminatorily  targeted. \nCritically, however, they do now acknowledge that such targeting of law enforcement \nresources - - even nominally focused on high crime areas - - is discriminatory. D.C. Attorney \nGeneral Karl Racine in a statement stated โOur office was not consulted on this policy before \nit was rolled out and did not learn about its discriminatory application until the USAOโs \n[recent] public court filing.โ D.C. Council member Charles Allen has also acknowledged \nthat the application of law enforcement resources in such a manner โexclusively and, now \nwe know, by design โ targets District residents of color via specific police districts.โ  \n31.  GRU officers, likewise, are deployed in a targeted and discriminatory manner, in \nneighborhoods of color. \n32.  The GRU further refines the civilians it targets, โmostly males in their late teens to \nearly forties.โ See, e.g., United States v. Gross, 784 F.3d 784, 789 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Brown, \nJ., concurring). \n33.  The manner of GRU officersโ deployment and approach to targeted civilians is \nhighly aggressive and forceful. \n \n7 \n\n \nCa se 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 8 of 46\n34.  The GRU are deployed in a manner calculated to convey force and authority well \nbeyond that of an ordinary officer deployed in uniform, with a sidearm, and potentially \nwith a similarly presented partner. \n35.  When engaging civilians, GRU officers typically deploy with numerosity of force, \nwith several officers. \n36.  Rather than patrolling in a standard uniform, the GRU patrols in โtacticalโ gear as \nreflected in the following the pictures.  \n \n \n \n \n \n37.  Weapons are on display when GRU officers approach and engage civilians. \n38.  The GRUโs forceful and aggressive use of โjump outsโ is widely known. \n39.  The GRU goes far beyond mere assertive police tactics to convey its force and \nauthority. \n40.   The GRU has cultivated and developed itself as an aggressive force to which \n \n8 \n\n \nCa se 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 9 of 46\ncompliance is required upon question or request. \n41.  The photo below depicts members of the Gun Recovery Unit posing, in what appears \nto be a station house, proudly gathered around the GRUโs flag. \n \n42.  The banner flag of the GRU reflects the intentionally cultivated image of their \nauthority that they project to the Black community. \n43.  The following image depicts the GRUโs banner and message: \n \n9 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 10 of 46\n \n44.  This is the message the GRU sends to the community at large. The flag includes \nprominent identification of the NSID and the โGun Recovery Unitโ of โWashington, D.C.โ \n45.  The centerpiece of the GRUโs logo is a skull and crossbones, also known as the \nโDeathโs Headโ symbol. The Deathโs Head symbol has historically been used to convey \ndeath, danger and lawless piracy. Military units have adopted the image as a logo to denote \ntheir ferocity and ruthlessness. \n46.  The GRUโs logo has modified the traditional Deathโs Head by adding a bullet hole, \nquite literally, dead-center in the forehead of the skull. \n47.  Above the skullโs head are two handguns and handcuffs on either side, depicting the \nweapons and restraints used by the GRU against civilians. \n48.  The ribbon displays the slogan, โVEST UP ONE IN THE CHAMBER,โ a rallying \ncry to GRU officers to have their weapons readied for a swift killing. \n49.  The MPD admitted in a statement that the above-referenced photo was publicly \nposted to a Twitter account by a GRU officer.  \n50.  Law for Black Lives, the community group that filed a complaint about the GRU \n \n10 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 11 of 46\nposted a petition that stated โThe use of this logo is part of a broader campaign designed to \ninflict terror on low-income communities of color. For the longest, community members \nhave voiced their fear of the Gun Recovery Unit and concern with their policing tactics.โ  \n51.  This is the well-known and apparently sanctioned reputation of the GRU, which is \nunderstood and implicitly conveyed every time a GRU member approaches a citizen.  \n52.  Their aggressively forceful reputation is, similarly, advanced through community \nknowledge of their sheer aggressiveness, including their jump outs. \n53.  As a matter of policy and practice, the GRU does not require its officers to possess \nreasonable articulable suspicion in order to approach and engage civilians. \n54.  The policy is so overt that it has been repeatedly acknowledged by District of \nColumbia courts. \n55.  In United States v. Gross, 784 F.3d 784 (D.C. Cir. 2015), D.C. Circuit Judge Janice \nRogers Brown accurately described the GRUโs practice. โOfficers randomly trawl high \ncrime neighborhoods asking occupants who fit a certain statistical profileโmostly males in \ntheir late teens to early fortiesโif they possess contraband. Despite lacking any semblance \nof  particularized  suspicion  when  the  initial  contact  is  made,  the  police  subject  these \nindividuals to intrusive searches unless they can prove their innocence.โ 784 F.3d at 789 (J. \nBrown, concurring). \n56.  The GRUโs racial profiling and tactics reflect a systematic devaluation of Black lives \nand experiences. As Judge Brown wrote, โAs a thought experiment, try to imagine this scene \nin Georgetown. Would residents of that neighborhood maintain there was no pressure to \ncomply, if the District's police officers patrolled Prospect Street in tactical gear, questioning \neach person they encountered about whether they were carrying an illegal firearm?โ 784 \n \n11 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 12 of 46\nF.3d at 790. \n57.  The GRU is boldly overt that they do not require reasonable articulable suspicion \nbefore targeting a civilian. In another reported case, GRU officer Jordan Katz attested that \nhe and other GRU officers had targeted a neighborhood ostensibly because it was high crime. \nKatz stopped an individual and demanded โdo you have a gun?โ Katz acknowledged that he \nhad not seen โanything that would make me think that [the individual] had a gun.โ As the \nD.C. Superior Court noted, like all officers in the District's GRU, \"[Officer Katz] asked [the \nindividual] whether he had a weapon, not because he had any suspicion that he did, but because \nthat's his job. He's a gun recover[er]โand he asks everyone. Apparently, he goes down the \nstreet asking everyone, do you have a gun.\" See Robinson v. United States, 76 A.3d 329 (D.C. \n2013).  \n58.  In court filings, the District of Columbia claims that the GRUโs policy, practice and \ncustom of engaging targeted civilians in the absence of reasonable articulable suspicion is \npermissible under a narrow constitutional doctrine authorizing voluntary consent by an \nindividual to be questioned. \n59.  In application, the GRUโs practices go far beyond what is permissible within the \nexisting legal Fourth Amendment framework. \n60.  The  GRU  has  a  pattern  or  custom  of  stopping,  frisking  and  searching  people, \nespecially young, African American men, without reasonable suspicion or probable cause. \n61.  The GRUโs tactic of demanding that young men of color submit to a search is so \npervasive that many persons know they must raise their shirts upon approach so GRU officers \ncan visually search their bodies. \n62.  Officers themselves know that even if nominally permissive words may be used to \n \n12 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 13 of 46\nโaskโ if someone is carrying a gun or to โconsentโ a search, there is little choice in the matter. \n63.  Officers celebrate their abusive authority over young black men. \n64.  The following is a photograph of a t-shirt worn by an MPD officer working the \nSeventh District. \n \n65.  โLet me see that waistband joโ are the words on this officerโs t-shirt, referencing a \nformulation of officerโs pervasive โrequestโ for a โconsensualโ search. The letters jo are an \nabbreviation for โjump out,โ one means among many by which officers convey that any \nappearance of โchoiceโ in the matter is mere window-dressing. \n66.  The remainder of the image on this 7D officerโs t-shirt includes a grim reaper wearing \nan MPD badge while holding an assault rifle. The letter โOโ in the word โpowershiftโ has \nbeen replaced by a Sun Cross, a racist hate symbol.  \n67.  D.C.โs Seventh District is 92% Black/African American.  \n \n13 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 14 of 46\n68.  The picture of the officer was taken at D.C. Superior Court in June, 2017, at which \nthe officer reportedly brazenly wore this t-shirt in his official capacity on at least three \nobserved occasions. On information and belief, he consorted with other MPD officers \nwearing this shirt and none filed a complaint. The representations in the shirt are, in fact, a \nreflection of normal police operations, including in particular those of the GRU. \n69.  The t-shirt reflects how openly and notoriously and well-known it is that when the \nMPD asks a young Black man to show his waistband, or whether he possesses guns and would \nhe mind if officers searched him, there is no real choice in the matter.  \n70.  While officers may formulate a request for a search in words nominally providing \ncover as a consensual request, the GRU is a police force to which a person cannot say no. \n71.  As  Judge  Brown  wrote,  โviewing  such  an  encounter  as  consensual  is  roughly \nequivalent to finding the latest Sasquatch sighting credible.โ Gross, 784 F.3d at 790. \n72.  It is a fact of life, a pervasive reality of existence, for young men of color in the \nneighborhoods targeted by the GRU that they or those whom they know will inevitably be \nsubjected to such demands by the GRU. \n73.  A reasonable person, particularly a person of color, innocent of any crime, knows \ncompliance with any โrequestโ of a GRU member may be compelled, with dangerous or \nforceful consequences. \n74.  If a civilian refuses to be questioned or searched, the GRU will compel the search \nanyways justifying the compelled search based on natural reactions to the aggressive officer \napproach or based on fabrications. \n75.   In this way, GRU officers bootstrap the โsuspiciousโ behavior into a Terry โfriskโ for \nweapons ostensibly for โthe officersโ safety.โ \n \n14 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 15 of 46\n76.  The GRU candidly acknowledges their tactics. GRU Officer Katz testified that the \nGRUโs  approach  is  โabout  observations,โ  specifically  โhow  people  react  to  [the  Gun \nRecovery Unit].โ In particular, โ[w]hen [Officer Katz] ask[s] people if they have a gun, [he \nis] looking for a reaction โ based on [their] movements after that question.โ Robinson, 76 \nA.3d at 332. \n77.  Members of the GRU also have a practice of stopping people and then frisking them \nor searching them or their belongings without reasonable suspicion and without any objective \nfacts indicating a person is armed. \n78.  The District of Columbia Court of Appeals expressed concern that this approach - - \neven as benignly described by GRU Officer Katz - - may be rife with bias that causes \nconstitutional rights violations. \nOfficer Katz and his team were out looking for guns. To that end, Officer Katz \nasked everyone if they had a gun, and he looked for a \"reaction โ based on \nmovements\" after that question, and then he evaluated the physical response to \nthat question to determine whether to investigate further. As noted in the recent \nstop and frisk civil litigation in New York City, \"[r]ecent psychological research \nhas . . . provided evidence that officers may be more likely to perceive a \nmovement as indicative of criminality if the officer has been primed to look for \nsigns that 'crime is afoot.'\" \"'[G]iven the nature of their work on patrol, officers \nmay have a systematic tendency to see and report furtive movements where none \nobjectively exist.'\" \nRobinson v. United States, 76 A.3d 329, 339 (D.C. 2013)(internal citations omitted). \n \n79.  Sometimes the best evidence of a GRU officerโs approach, the stop and request for a \nsearch, is from body worn camera (BWC) footage. \n80.  BWC is preserved and retained in the event of an arrest.  \n81.  If police categorize an encounter as involving โvoluntary cooperativeness of an \nindividualโ not only will the BWC not be marked and preserved, but under MPD General \nOrders it is optional for the officer to even document the encounter. \n \n15 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 16 of 46\n82.  Whistleblower  and  MPD  Sergeant  Charlotte  Djossou,  in  fact,  complained  to \ncommand staff that NSID officers at roll call were openly conversing about ways to violate \nBWC orders/directives. \n83.  Djossou is a 15-year veteran of the MPD, previously honored for her service by Chief \nNewsham. \n84.  Djossou attested to the policy, practice, or custom of racially targeting Black men in \nJanuary 16, 2020, testimony before the D.C. Council.   \n85.  Djossou told the Council that when she was assigned to  the Narcotics Special \nInvestigation  Division  (NSID),  she  complained  and  โreported  its  illegal  tacticsโ  to \nsupervisors, including that they were โviolating 4th Amendment rights.โ She was met with \nretaliation.  \n86.  Djossou then escalated her complaints and in June, 2018, later met with Assistant \nChief Robert Contee and told him and other command officials that during roll-call and \nelsewhere, NSID Officers were being instructed to โtargetโ large groups of people โwithout \nprobable cause.โ She attested that she was, thereafter, subject to further retaliation, including \nby Chief Contee himself.  \n87.  Contee is the Assistant Chief of the MPDโs Investigative Services Bureau which \noversees and includes the NSID. \nThe  GRUโs operation in Deanwood on June 13, 2018 illustrates the Unitโs practices \n \n88.  An illustrative example of GRUโs modus operandi of stop and frisk is the GRUโs \noperation in Deanwood on June 13, 2018. \n89.  Several GRU officers arrived in tactical gear in front of a barbershop where several \nAfrican American men were sitting outside. \n \n16 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 17 of 46\n90.  As the officers got out of their vehicles, they told the men that they were interested in \na car parked out front because it had overly tinted windows. \n91.  But in fact, the officers staged a fake search and find operation. They searched a man \nwho was ostensibly a member of the group but was in fact a โplant,โ put there by the GRU \nso they could find a gun and thus manufacture reasonable suspicion to search the other men.  \n92.  Reflecting widespread knowledge of the GRUโs aggressive and unlawful stop and \nfrisk or search tactics, as well as notice to municipality, on June 24, 2018, Advisory \nNeighborhood Commissioner Anthony Lorenzo Green sent a complaint to Police Chief \nNewsham and to Mayor Bowser decrying the incident, the GRUโs stop and frisk tactics, and \nmaking clear that these tactics were viewed as racially discriminatory. \n93.  The GRUโs stop and frisk tactics are perhaps the most notorious owing to that unitโs \naggressiveness and their pervasive presence intentionally targeting Black neighborhoods. \n94.  The MPD, department-wide, engages in racially discriminatory practices regarding \nstops and frisks. \nMPD mounted almost insurmountable barriers to obtaining data about stop and \nfrisks \n \n95.  With consciousness of its guilt and manifesting grossly negligent supervision of its \npolice force in terms of the racially discriminatory and disparate practices department-wide \nfor stops and frisks, the MPD has sought to avoid disclosure even of basic statistics regarding \nits practices.  \n96.  In March 2016, the District of Columbia enacted the Neighborhood Engagement \nAchieves Results (NEAR) Act of 2016. \n97.  One of its key provisions required the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) \nto collect detailed and comprehensive data about stops and frisks the police carry out on the \n \n17 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 18 of 46\nstreets of the District. \n98.  The stop-and-frisk data collection provision called for police officers to collect 14 \ncategories of data for every stop in D.C. including reason for stop, duration for stop, whether \nstop resulted in arrest, and race and/ or ethnicity of person stopped, and whether the stop \nresulted in a search. \n99.  The D.C. Council allocated funding for data collection to begin in October 2016, \nfunding the endeavor at one hundred percent (100%) of the MPDโs own projected cost for \nthe data collection. \n100.  The collection and disclosure of this data is crucial to ensuring that the police do not \nunfairly and unconstitutionally focus on people of color when conducting these stops. \n101.  But, FOIA requests filed by local watchdog groups in 2017 showed that the data \ncollection requirement had not yet been implemented. \n102.  The District and the MPD were not collecting the data about stops and frisks carried \nout by MPD in the District. \n103.  Over the following year, officials from Mayor Bowserโs office and MPD responded \nto oversight inquiries by the D.C. Council with a shifting and contradictory parade of excuses \nand the release of recycled and incomplete pre-NEAR data. \n104.  MPD promulgated a false claim that the NEAR Act had been โfully implemented.โ \n105.  In early 2018, the mayorโs office released a report stating the NEAR Act had been \nโfully implementedโ when it had not. \n106.  Based on Council testimony by top D.C. officials in February 2018 and press \nstatements from MPD in March 2018, it became clear that, two years on, the NEAR Act Stop \n& Frisk Data collection requirement still had not been implemented. \n107.  As of March, 2018, the District had not touched the money the Council allocated for \n \n18 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 19 of 46\nimplementation of the NEAR Act Stop & Frisk Data collection requirement. \n108.  As of March, 2018, the District was no closer to collecting the NEAR Act Stop & \nFrisk Data than when the Act was passed. \n109.  Pressed at a D.C. Council oversight hearing on March, 29, 2018, Police Chief \nNewsham admitted that the MPD was โguiltyโ of not undertaking the data collection mandate \nof the NEAR Act. In Newshamโs words, โ[T]o the extent there has been a delay to this data \npiece and not a complete understanding of the necessary infrastructure changes that would be \nrequired, um, weโre guilty.โ  \n110.  As data has dripped out, it has confirmed the extraordinary racial disparities in the \nMPDโs stop and frisk practices. \n111.  It has also established that the District and the MPD have been misrepresenting and/or \nunderreporting the vast extent of its stop and frisk operations. In February, 2019, testifying \nregarding the failure to comply with the NEAR Act, Chief Newsham attested that based on a \none-year study, the MPD was conducting approximately 1,000 stop and frisks per year. \n112.  Finally, in September, 2019, the District released some data encompassing the period \nof July 22, 2019 through August 18, 2019. During that period the MPD conducted 1,470 \nfrisks or protective pat downs. Extrapolating that figure annually, the MPD is reporting the \nconduct of approximately 19,000 stop and frisk per year (approximately an 1800% increase \nfrom the annual number referenced in Chief Newshamโs testimony from seven months prior). \n113.  A staggering ninety-three percent (93%) of the frisks were conducted on Black \npersons.  \n114.  During that same period, of the 4,278 non-ticket (i.e., non-traffic) stops conducted, \neighty-seven percent (87%) were conducted on Black individuals. Id. \n115.  The reported data for stops by the NSID, generally, during the period of August 1, \n \n19 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 20 of 46\n2019 through January 31, 2020, is even higher, with 88% of persons in documentable stops \nbeing Black and 94% of persons with documentable searches being Black. As per MPDโs \nreporting requirements, no data is required to be recorded for โfield contactsโ that are \ncategorized by officers as through voluntary cooperation. \n116.  Meanwhile, the need for the data points required by the NEAR Act has remained acute. \nThe data produced from the MPD for that one period confirmed and, indeed, was worse that \nwhat local watchdogs had discerned from best effort analysis with available limited data. \n117.  A February 2018 investigative report from WUSA9 analyzed pre-NEAR Act data \nand found that approximately eighty percent of the stops involved a black subject. \n118.  The local ACLU, which sought to construct an analysis through a time-consuming \nreview of body worn camera footage in the absence of data collection and reporting by the \nMPD, was advised by the District that it would impose financial charges for the video that \nmade obtaining the data points from BWC footage an illusory remedy. \n119.  The ACLU found similar racial disparities in arrest data (including certain types of \nstops resulting in โcitationsโ) for the years 2013 to 2017 it obtained from MPD through an open \nrecords request. \n120.  From 2013 to 2017, African American individuals composed 47% of D.C.โs population \nbut 86% of its arrestees. During this time, African American people were arrested at 10 times \nthe rate of white people. searches were more likely to be conducted in the police districts \nencompassing Wards 7 and 8 than anywhere else in the city โ 20% and 35% the Sixth and \nSeventh Districts, compared to 17% in the Fifth District (which includes Ward 5) and 4% in \nthe Second District (which includes largely white Wards 2 and 3.) \n121.  African American people are disproportionately arrested in over 90% of the \nDistrictโs census tracts, including the whitest parts of the city. \n \n20 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 21 of 46\n122.  Seventy-eight percent of all people arrested for driving without a permit were African \nAmerican. That statistic is notable because in many cases, officers have no way of knowing \nwhether a driver possesses a valid permit at the time they order the driver to pull over. As a \nresult, the significant disparity in arrests for this offense may indicate racial discrimination even \nin traffic stops. \n123.  As additional data has been produced from the NEAR Act, the racial disparity is clear. \nDuring the period of July 22, 2019 to December 31, 2019, 8,036 reported stop and frisks were \ndone over that five month period. Every day in the District of Columbia, two (2) White persons \nare stopped and frisk on average. On average, forty-five (45) Black persons are stopped and \nfrisked every day in D.C. Just two percent (2%) of the searches or frisks turned up a gun or \nother weapon. Police found weapons on Black persons at about the same rate as White.  \n124.  The District of Columbia acting through the Mayorโs office and the MPD, having been \nforced to finally disclose stop and frisk data required by the NEAR Act in September, 2019, \npledged at that time to hire outside and independent researchers to conduct scientifically valid \nanalysis of the NEAR Act data using โmethodologies for discerning racial discrimination in \npolicing.โ  \n125.  Reflecting continued failure to supervise, they have yet to do so. \n126.  Department-wide discriminatory outcomes permeate all aspects of law enforcement \nby the MPD. While studies show that marijuana use is equally prevalent among Whites and \nBlacks, a recent analysis by The Washington Post found that โAfrican Americans still account \nfor just under 90 percent of those arrested on all pot-related chargesโฆ even as they make up \n45 percent of the cityโs population.โ Paul Schwartzman and John D. Harden, D.C. Legalized \nMarijuana, But One Thing Didnโt Change: Almost Everyone Arrested on Pot Charges is \nBlack, The Washington Post, Sept. 15, 2020. \n \n21 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 22 of 46\n127.  Given  the  sharply  and  discriminatorily  targeted  enforcement  of  the  GRU,  on \ninformation and belief, the statistics for the GRUโs reported stops and frisk are even more \nextreme than the Department generally. That is, presuming, that the GRU is in fact reporting \nits sweeping practices of stopping Black persons in a manner consistent with reporting \nrequirements. \n128.  As discussed herein, the GRUโs practices are to stop and frisk unlawfully, in the \nabsence of reasonable articulable suspicion, including stops and frisks on the discriminatory \nbasis of color or race. \nNamed Plaintiffsโ Stop and Frisks and Prosecutions \n \nThe stops and frisks of Messrs Crudup, Bell, Burns, and Ramsey typify the stop and frisks \nmade by the GRU \n \n129.  The stops and frisks of Messrs Crudup, Bell, Burns, and Ramsey typify the stop and \nfrisks made by the GRU. \n130.  Each is a young African American man, each was stopped by the GRU when he was \ndoing nothing more than walking down the street or sitting in a car, and in each case the GRU \nfabricated facts in a sworn narrative to justify the stop, frisk and searches and arrests knowing \nthe narratives would be relied on by AUSAs making charging decisions and Judges making \nrelease/ detention decisions. \nStop and frisk of Dalonta Crudup \n \n131.  On Sunday January 12, 2020 at about 11:30 p.m. Dalonta Crudup was walking alone \nin the 2400 block of 14th Street, NE in Washington, DC.  \n132.  This area is an African-American neighborhood that has been dubbed a โhigh crime areaโ by MPD. \n133.  Mr. Crudup is an African-American male, 23 year of age at the time. \n134.  He was wearing a coat, appropriate for the evening and a hooded sweatshirt.   \n \n22 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 23 of 46\n135.  Mr. Crudup was wearing a backpack with one strap over his shoulder. \n136.  Officer Choi and three other officers of the GRU (Officer Minzak, Officer Joseph and \nOfficer Laury) were cruising the streets in a vehicle when they turned into the 2400 block of \n14th Street. \n137.  The vehicle officers were using was an unmarked vehicle, that is, it was not a police \ncruiser and did not display logos, signs or insignias announcing that it was a police vehicle. \nNor did the vehicle have emergency equipment and lights distinguishing it as a police vehicle. \nThe vehicle was a Chevy Malibu. \n138.  The officersโ vehicle approached Mr. Crudup from behind him. \n139.  Mr. Crudup was walking on the sidewalk. To his left were apartment buildings with \na waist-high fence on the property line at the edge of the sidewalk. \n140.  Officers were not responding to any call for service. \n141.  Officers did not have a lookout and were seeking to match an individual with a \nrecently reported crime. \n142.  Officers  in  the  approaching  and  moving  vehicle,  collectively,  only  had  the \nopportunity to view Mr. Crudup for just a moment. \n143.  Officers had, in fact, just entered the block, the 2400 block of 14th Street, when they \nobserved Mr. Crudup walking. \n144.  The officers drove up and stopped just behind Crudup. \n145.  All four officers jumped out of their vehicle.  \n146.  Each of the officers was dressed in full tactical gear and displayed firearms and \nhandcuffs. \n147.  As he was the only person walking on the sidewalk, and given the jumping out of four \nofficers of the GRU jumping out to target him, Mr. Crudup knew what he had to do. \n \n23 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 24 of 46\n148.  It is well known in the neighborhoods that they patrol, that when the GRU jumps out a \nyoung Black man needs to lift up his shirt and show his waistband. There is not a choice in the \nmatter. \n149.  At the same time Officer Laury says to him, โIโm Officer Lyon, you donโt got no \nweapons on you?โ Mr. Crudup lifted his waistband to submit to the visual search by GRU that \nis a standard part of growing up Black in the neighborhoods in which the GRU patrol. \n150.  That did not satisfy the GRU. \n151.  Mr. Crudup was now stopped, and he turned to his right.  \n152.  Mr. Crudup was standing with the fence blocking movement to his rear. \n153.  The four officers formed a semi-circle in front and around him. \n154.  Office Laury asked Mr. Crudup, โNothing in your bag?โ to which he responded, โweed.โ \n155.  Officer Laury asked if he would mind if she checked his bag, and Mr. Crudup refused \nconsent for the bag search. \n156.  Officer Laury then asked โYou said what?โ To which Mr. Crudup responded, โCanโt \ncheck it.โ \n157.  Officer Laury then insisted, โwould you mind just opening it?โ \n158.  Mr. Crudup was not free to leave.  \n159.  After officers pressed him verbally further, Mr. Crudup pivoted and took steps slowly \nbackwards on the sidewalk away from the officers that were in the way of his path. \n160.  As Mr. Crudup stepped backwards slowly, Officer Choi extended his arm to block his \nmovement, touching him to further physically convey that he was not free to leave. \n161.  The officers were physically and intentionally intimidating, pressing Mr. Crudup \nwith his back up against the fence. \n \n24 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 25 of 46\n162.  As a โrequestโ from the GRU to โconsentโ to a search is not a request at all, \nnotwithstanding Mr. Crudupโs clear statement that he did not consent to a backpack search, \nthe officers persisted and insisted in an effort to intimidate verbal consent. \n163.  Officer Choi said again, โyou mind if we check for weapons?โ Mr. Crudup shook his \nhead no and said โI donโt have no weapons. Canโt check it.โ \n164.  At this point, officers have surrounded Mr. Crudup and are about or less than an \narmโs length distant at most. Mr. Crudup, is now backed against the fence, with his hands on \neither side of him holding the top rail of the fence as officer encroach closer and closer. \n165.  Manufacturing a basis to โjustifyโ a compelled search, Officer Laury then says, โYou \nsee the way you are acting is real strange, the way you are bent back across the fence back \nhere.โ \n166.  Officers  are  now  perhaps  one  foot  away  from  Mr.  Crudup,  officers  use  their \nnumerosity to surrounded him on all sides (left, front and right).  \n167.  Mr. Crudup is not only not free to leave, but officers intimidatingly encroach even \ncloser. \n168.  There was no objectively reasonable basis to suspect Mr. Crudup was in possession \nof contraband. Indeed, Officer Choi testified at the preliminary hearing and admitted that, \nupon observation and approach, officers did not see a bulge or anything illegal on Mr. \nCrudup. \n169.  Mr. Crudup repeated his refusal: โYou all canโt check me, you canโt check my \nbackpack.โ \n170.  Officer Choi told Mr. Crudup his backpack looks heavy. Mr. Crudup shook it with \nboth hands to show its not really that heavy. \n \n25 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 26 of 46\n171.  Officer Choi then stated โI heard an object inside.โ  \n172.  Having conducted an illegal stop, Officer Choi then took the backpack and conducted \nan illegal search, a pat down of the exterior of the bag. \n173.  Officer Choi then claimed that he felt more than two ounces of marijuana through \nthe fabric of the backpack. \n174.  When Officer Choi tried to remove the backpack from Mr. Crudup, Mr. Crudup \nimmediately clenched onto the top hook part of the backpack as tightly as possible and would \nnot let go. \n175.  Officer Choi then further searched the backpack and observed a black in color pistol. \n \n176.  Mr. Crudup was presented in Superior Court on January 13, 2020. Mr. Crudup \nwas preventively detained pursuant to D.C. Code ยง 23-1322(b) on the basis of the \nprobable cause statement in Officer Choiโs Gerstein pending a preventive detention \nhearing. \n177.  The Judge released Mr. Crudup into High Intensity Supervision custody placed on \nGPS monitoring. Mr. Crudup remained on GPS monitoring with HISP conditions of release \nuntil March 3, 2020 when the government dismissed the case. \n178.  The government indicted Mr. Crudup and an AUSA contacted Mr. Crudupโs counsel \nwith a plea offer. Mr. Crudupโs counsel responded with an email rejecting the offer because of \ndefects in the stop as shown on the BWC. Fifteen minutes later the AUSA emailed back saying \nthe government was dismissing the case. \n179.  These facts and the narrative the officers wove from them in sworn statements and \nsworn testimony are fabrications. \n180.  A Gerstein is a statement of probable cause, sworn under oath. \n \n26 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 27 of 46\n181.  At a preliminary hearing, witnesses testify under oath as to probable cause for the \ncharged offense. \n182.  Officer Choi swore under oath at the preliminary hearing that Mr. Crudupโs actions \nin switching his backpack to both shoulders was suspicious.  This statement was fabricated. \n183.  Officer Choi swore in his Gerstein that Mr. Crudupโs actions in backing up to the \nfence was a cause of โconcernโ for the officers because he was trying to hide his backpack.  \nThis statement was fabricated.   \n184.  In fact, the officer exited their vehicle and all approached Mr. Crudup at the same \ntime. \n185.  The officers backed Mr. Crudup up against the fence. \n186.  Officer Choi then swore under oath that Mr. Crudupโs actions were โsuspicious.โ \n187.  Mr. Crudup did not consent to the encounter with the officers. \n188.  The officers surrounded Mr. Crudup without reasonable suspicion of a crime, and then \ngrabbed his bag to search it without consent.   \n189.  The actions by the GRU were done in accordance with the custom, policy and \nprocedures of MPD to  manufacture suspicion  and arrests of African American men who \notherwise were not engaged in suspicious activity.   \nStop and frisk of Dontrey Bell \n \n190.  On Monday, April 29th, 2019, at approximately 10:00 p.m. Dontrey Bell was in a \nparking lot at the 1500 block of Butler Street, S.E. in the District.  Dontrey Bell is an African-\nAmerican male. \n191.  Meanwhile, some of the same members of the GRU (including Officers Choi and \nMinzak) were patrolling in the 7th District when they turned into a parking lot of the 1500 \nblock of Butler Street, S.E., when they saw a group of African American men in front of 1558 \n \n27 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 28 of 46\nButler Street SE. \n192.  According to the Gerstein, four officers - Officer Choi, Officer Minzak, Officer \n \nAnderson and Officer Rogers -got out of their vehicle to make contact with the group.  Mr. Bell \ntook unprovoked flight up the stairs of 1558 Butler Street, NE.     \n193.  According to the Gerstein, Officers gave chase and Mr. Bell was stopped on the top \n \nfloor of the apartment building. Officer Anderson then asked Mr. Bell if he had any weapons \non him at which time Mr. Bell dropped his hands to his sides.  \n194.  Based on Mr. Bell's โnervousnessโ and actions, a pat down for weapons was \nconducted.  \n195.  Mr. Bell did not consent to any search or patdown. \n196.  Officer Anderson felt a hard metal object in Mr. Bell's back left pants pocket which \nhe immediately recognized to be a firearm. \n197.  These facts, as sworn in the Gerstein, are fabrications. \n \n198.  When the GRU officers exited their vehicle, there was no crowd. \n199.  When the GRU officers, exited their vehicle, Mr. Bell was nowhere in sight. \n200.  The GRU officers entered a building and ran up the steps. \n201.  Mr. Bell was at the top of the steps.  He wasnโt doing anything other than standing \nthere. \n202.  The GRU officers surrounded him and backed him against the wall.   \n203.  The GRU officers grabbed Mr. Bell and searched him without his consent. \n204.  The officers say they found a gun on Mr. Bell. \n \n205.  On April 30, 2019 Mr. Bell was presented on a charge of CPWL in Superior Court. \n \n206.  Mr. Bell was preventively detained pursuant to D.C. Code ยง 23-1322(b) on the basis of \n \n28 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 29 of 46\nthe probable cause statement in Officer Minzakโs Gerstein pending a preventive detention \nhearing. \n207.  The Judge found probable cause at the hearing based on the officersโ fabricated \ntestimony but the Judge released Mr. Bell into High Intensity Supervision custody and placed \nhim on GPS monitoring pending the action of the Grand Jury. \n208.  On 10/3/2019 the Judge granted the governmentโs motion to dismiss without prejudice. \n209.  The actions by the GRU were done in accordance with the custom, policy and procedures \nof MPD to manufacture suspicion and arrests of African American men who otherwise were not \nengaged in suspicious activity.   \nStop and Frisk of David Burns \n \n210.  On February 12, 2018 at about 10:30 p.m, David Burns was sitting in a car with his \ngirlfriend in the rear parking lot of 2660 Douglas Pl S.E. in the District. \n211.  Mr. Burns and his girlfriend are American-American. \n212.   Mr. Burns was smoking a cigarette when several GRU members in three separate cars \n(Officer Anderson driver, Officer Henderson front seat passenger, and Officer Joseph Officer \nWright driver, Officer Ashley front seat passenger, Officer Hiller and Detective Del Po) rolled \ninto the lot. \n213.  According to the Gerstein, Officer Joseph approached the passenger side of the vehicle \n \nand started talking to Mr. Burns.  \n214.  He asked Mr. Burns and his girlfriend whether they had any weapons, to which they \nsaid no.  \n215.  Officer Joseph then asked if he could take thirty seconds of their time to check and \n \n29 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 30 of 46\nmake sure, and asked to see their waistbands.  \n216.  Before they could answer, Officer Wright, then approached the vehicle and ordered \nMr. Burns to step out of the car. \n217.  The officer then physically opened the vehicle door. Burns reacted with puzzlement, \nasking why he was doing that. \n218.  Responding to Mr. Burnsโ obvious nervousness and puzzlement at being accosted by \narmed police officers for no reason, the officers concluded that they had a basis to seize Mr. \nBurns. \n219.  Officers Joseph and Wright pulled Mr. Burns out of the vehicle. \n220.  The officers discovered a firearm on Mr. Burnsโ person. \n221.   On February 2, 2018 Mr. Burns was presented on a charge of CPWL in Superior Court. \n \nMr. Burns was preventively detained pursuant to D.C. Code ยง 23-1322(b) on the basis of \nthe probable cause statement in the Gerstein pending a preventive detention hearing. \n222.  Mr. Burns waived the preliminary hearing and the Judge released Mr. Burns pending \nthe action of the Grand Jury.  \n223.  After Mr. Burns filed a motion to suppress evidence, the government moved to \ndismiss the indictment which the Judge granted on April 8, 2018. \n224.  The facts that were sworn to under oath in the Gerstein were fabricated. \n225.  Mr. Burns was not engaged in any activity that would generate a reasonable \nsuspicion of a crime. \n226.  The officers had no basis to suspect him of a crime. \n227.  All the officers were armed and in uniform. \n228.  The officers manufactured the โnervousnessโ of Mr. Burns by surrounding Mr. \n \n30 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 31 of 46\nBurnsโ vehicle for no reason, and ordering him to exit. \n229.  The actions by the GRU were done in accordance with the custom, policy and \nprocedures of MPD to manufacture suspicion and arrests of African American men who \notherwise were not engaged in suspicious activity.   \nStop and Frisk of Joevantae Ramsey \n230.  On June 4, 2019, Mr. Ramsey was standing on the sidewalk outside of his home at \nthe time, which was 4505 Douglas Street, NE Washington, DC. \n231.  Mr. Ramsey is an African-American male. \n232.  Around 2:00 p.m. on that day, he was talking on the phone with a friend. \n233.  Police officers from the GRU and other MPD units pulled up in front of his house \nin a white Impala.  These MPD officers were Wright, Torres and Tariq. \n234.  At this time, Mr. Ramsey was approximately 7-8 feet from his front door. \n235.  The police were still inside their vehicle when one officer asked โWhatโs going \non?โ \n236.  Not wishing to engage in a consensual encounter with these officers, Mr. Ramsey \nresponded, โNothing, I am going in the house.โ \n237.  There was no further communication between the officers and Mr. Ramsey. \n238.  Mr. Ramsey walked toward his house with his back to the officers.  The officers \nexited their vehicle and rushed toward Mr. Ramsey. \n239.  The officers were armed and dressed in full tactical gear. \n240.  At this time, there was no reasonable suspicion that Mr. Ramsey had committed a \ncrime. \n \n31 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 32 of 46\n241.  Mr. Ramsey entered his house and closed the front door. \n242.  The officersโฆwithout a warrantโฆpushed the front door open. \n243.  Mr. Ramsey attempted to lock the door, but the officers forced their way through \nthe door and seized Mr. Ramsey. \n244.  The police officers did not yell โpoliceโ or โstopโ prior to forcing themselves into \nMr. Ramseyโs home. \n245.  Following the warrantless seizure inside Mr. Ramseyโs home, they discovered a \nfirearm and placed him under arrest. \n246.  Based upon this unconstitutional seizure of Mr. Ramsey, these officers applied for \na search warrant of Mr. Ramseyโs home, which uncovered more contraband. \n247.  On June 5, 2019, Mr. Ramsey was presented in courtroom C10 in the District of \nColumbia Superior Court. \n248.  The government presented the Gerstein to the presiding judge, and asked for a hold.  \nThe judge granted a hold based upon the alleged facts in the Gerstein. \n249.  Many facts in the Gerstein were fabricated. \n250.  Mr. Ramsey was detained following his preliminary hearing on June 7, 2019. \n251.  Mr. Ramseyโs attorney filed a motion to suppress evidence, which was opposed by \nthe government. \n252.  Mr. Ramsey was indicted on three counts on September 25, 2019. \n253.  Mr. Ramseyโs trial date was set for October 7, 2019. \n254.  On October 2, 2019, the government filed a motion to dismiss the indictment. \n255.  Mr. Ramsey was released on October 2, 2019 after being incarcerated for 119 days. \n \n32 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 33 of 46\n256.  In the Gerstein, Officer Tariq swore under oath that the officers were looking for a \nvehicle with individuals believed to be in possession of firearms. \n257.  Officer Tariq described an SUV that was believed to contain the individuals. \n258.  The officers pursued the SUV but lost sight of it. \n259.  The officers then observed Mr. Ramsey.  Officer Tariq swore that Mr. Ramsey was \nโone of the individuals Officers were looking for.โ \n260.  This statement was a fabrication. \n261.  There was no SUV near Mr. Ramsey when officers encountered him. \n262.  There was no description of the occupants of the vehicle. \n263.  There was no description of an individual matching Mr. Ramseyโs description. \n264.  Mr. Ramseyโs name was not broadcast as a suspect or person of interest. \n265.  Mr. Ramsey was not observed in possession of any firearms prior to the officersโ \nsearch for the mysterious SUV. \n266.  The officers had no evidence whatsoever that tied Mr. Ramsey to the SUV. \n267.  Based upon the officersโ prior knowledge of Mr. Ramsey, they forced their way \ninto his house without a warrant and without any suspicion of a crime. \n268.  Officer Tariq fabricated Mr. Ramseyโs status as a โsuspectโ to justify the officersโ \nillegal entry into his home and to ensure that probable cause would be found and that Mr. \nRamsey would be incarcerated. \n269.  Due to the officersโ fabrications under oath and unconstitutional actions, Mr. \nRamsey was incarcerated for 119 days. \n270.  The actions by the GRU and MPD officers against Mr. Ramsey were done in \n \n33 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 34 of 46\naccordance with the custom, policy and procedures of MPD to manufacture suspicion and \narrests of African American men who otherwise were not engaged in suspicious activity. \nUnconstitutional Policies of the MPD \n271.  The  Fourth  Amendment  prohibits  officers  from  conducting  stops  and  frisks \nwithout a reasonable articulable suspicion of criminal conduct; frisking persons without a \nreasonable belief that they are armed or presently dangerous; and searching and seizing \npersons without probable cause. Constitutional principles of equal protection of the law, \nas applied within the District of Columbia including through the Due Process Clause of the \nFifth Amendment, bars police officers from targeting persons for stops and frisks on the \nbasis of race or color. \n272.  The MPDโs Gun Recovery Unit (GRU) maintains a policy, practice and/or custom \nof conducting stops and frisks in the absence of reasonable articulable suspicion of criminal \nconduct, including engaging in racial profiling and/or targeting on the basis of race and/or \ncolor. \n273.  The GRU also has a policy, practice and/or custom of coercive and aggressive \ntactics and shows of authority that render meaningless in application the possibility of \nvoluntary consent by those targeted by the unit for approach and/or โvoluntaryโ consent to \nbe stopped or frisked. \n274.  The municipality and Chief Newsham have failed to adequately and properly \nscreen, train, supervise, monitor and/or discipline GRU officers and have encouraged or \nsanctioned or failed to rectify the MPD and GRUโs custom and practice of unconstitutional \nstops and frisks. \n275.  The degree of failure to properly supervise the conduct of stops and frisks is so \n \n34 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 35 of 46\nsevere that, even at the grossest level, the municipality and Chief Newsham have falsely \nreported or underreported the annual quantity of stops and frisks by a factor of 1,800 \npercent. \n276.  For circumstances described above, the municipality and its Police Chief have \nknown or should have known of the pervasive unconstitutional and racially discriminatory \npractices with respect to the GRUโs stop and frisk activities. \n277.  The inadequate screening, training and supervision of the GRU is a direct and \nproximate cause of its unconstitutional stop and frisk practices. \n278.  By failing to properly screen, train, and supervise GRU officers the District and \nPolice Chief Newsham have acted recklessly and with deliberate indifference to the \nconstitutional rights of those who would come into contact with the GRU. \n279.  By failing to properly train and supervise MPD officers, department-wide, in the \nconduct of lawful stop and frisks, the District and Chief Newsham have acted recklessly \nand with deliberate indifference of the constitutional rights of those who would come into \ncontact with the GRU, among the most aggressive units in the MPD. \nRULE 23 ALLEGATIONS \n \n280.  Named Plaintiffs  on behalf of themselves and the classes defined below bring this \naction under Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \non behalf of the following two classes: \nInjunctive Relief Class: Each person who has been or will be subjected by GRU \nofficers to the policy, practice and/or custom of illegally stopping and/or frisking \npersons: (a) in the absence of the reasonable articulable suspicion of criminal \nactivity that is required by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, \n \n35 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 36 of 46\nincluding but not limited to those persons who have been stopped, or stopped and \nfrisked, (b) in a manner that discriminates on the basis of race and/or color in \nviolation of the equal protection of the law. \nDamages Class: Each person within the injunctive relief class definition who has \nbeen subjected to such violations as set forth in the injunctive relief class definition \nin the period beginning three years before the date of filing of the original complaint \nin this case and going forward until the date this case is terminated.  \n281.  Certification of these classes under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is \nappropriate, because the District of Columbia has a policy, pattern, and practice for each \nclaim  that  has  uniformly  affected  all  members  the  class,  and  injunctive  relief  and \ndeclaratory judgment and a judgment against the District will benefit each and every \nplaintiff and class member. \n282.  Certification of the classes under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is also \nappropriate, in that common questions of law and fact predominate over any individual \nquestions, and class action treatment is superior for the fair and efficient adjudication of these \nclass claims. \n283.  Regarding Named Plaintiffs and the other members of the classes defined above, there \nare no individual questions on the issue of liability, because all members of each of the classes \nwere injured by the same policy and practices. \n284.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the classes are: \n \n \n1)  Whether the GRU engages in a policy, practice and/or custom of conducting \nstops and frisks in the absence of reasonable articulable suspicion of criminal \nconduct; \n2)  Whether the GRU engages in profiling or discrimination on the basis of race or \ncolor in targeting the individuals or groups it stops and frisks; \n3)  Whether the GRU, incidental to such stops and frisks and in general, acts in a \n \n36 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 37 of 46\nmanner that undermines voluntary consent; \n4)  Whether the District of Columbia and Chief Newsham have failed to adequately \nand properly screen, train, supervise, monitor or discipline GRU officers or the \nGRU, and whether those failures have caused the constitutional violations \nagainst class members; \n5)  Whether the District of Columbia and Chief Newsham have failed to adequately \nand properly screen, train, supervise, or monitor the conduct of stop and frisk \nactivities by the MPD department-wide or the GRU in particular, and whether \nthose failures have caused the constitutional violations against class members; \n6)  Whether  the  District  of  Columbia  and  Chief  Newsham  have  encouraged \n,sanctioned, and/or failed to rectify the unconstitutional stops and frisks by \nmembers of the GRU or the Department in general, and whether such acts and \nomissions have caused the constitutional violations against class members. \n \n285.      Each of the classes is both so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. The \nexact number of the classes members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time. NEAR Act data \nindicates, District-wide, there are approximately 19,000 stop and frisks per year, a substantial \nportion of which occur within the police districts focused on by the GRU. Given the size of the \nGRU, twenty to thirty officers at any time, and their practices, sufficient numerosity exists. \n286.  Plaintiffs, including  those within the  class, as  well as the Black  residents  of the \nneighborhoods targeted by the GRU, continue to face the imminent likelihood of being subject \nto the GRUโs unconstitutional stop and frisk practices. \n287.  Mr. Crudup, Mr. Bell, Mr. Burns and Mr. Ramseyโs claims are typical of the \nclaims of the other members of the classes of which they are members and all other \nmembers of the classes were injured by exactly the same means, that is, by the challenged \nstop and frisk practices. \n288.  Mr. Crudup, Mr. Bell, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Ramsey on behalf of themselves and each \nof the classes of which they are members will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \nthe members of the classes and have retained counsel who are competent and experienced \nin complex federal civil rights class action litigation and criminal defense law. \n \n37 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 38 of 46\n289.  Mr. Crudup, Mr. Bell, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Ramsey on behalf of themselves and each \nof the classes of which they are members have no interests that are contrary to or in conflict \nwith those of the members of each of the classes of which they are members. \nSubstantive Allegations for Claims \n \nClaim 1 \nFourth Amendment Illegal Stop and Frisk Claim \n(Class Claims Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 Against the District of Columbia for \nViolations of the Fourth Amendment) \n \n290.  Plaintiffs adopt by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1 - 289 as if fully set forth herein. \n \n291.  The Districtโs GRU has and does maintain a policy, practice and/or custom of illegally \nstopping and frisking or searching persons (or their possessions) in the absence of reasonable articulable \nsuspicion of criminal activity, as required by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, including \nbut not limited to persons who have been stopped, or stopped and frisked, on the basis of race and/or color in \nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause, the Due Process Clause, and equal protection of the law. \n292.  The District  and its Chief of Police have had notice of this practice and have \nknowingly ignored this practice, which is consistent enough as to constitute custom. \n293.  The District and its Chief of Police have failed to respond to the need for oversight of \nthe Districtโs and the GRUโs stop and frisk practices in such a manner as to constitute \ndeliberate indifference to the risk that constitutional violations will result. \n294.  As a consequence, GRU officers have violated the constitutional rights of the class \nmembers by subjecting each to stops and/or frisks in the absence of reasonable articulable \nsuspicion in violation of the Fourth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n295.  Named Plaintiffs and the other Class members suffered humiliation, emotional \ndistress, physical harm, loss of earnings, general damages, and legal expenses that \nresulted from being stopped, frisked and searched without justification. \n \n38 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 39 of 46\n296.  Named Plaintiffs and the other class members are therefore entitled to the relief \ndescribed herein. \nClaim 2 \nStop and Frisks on the Basis of Race and/or Color \n(Class Claims Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 Against the District of Columbia for \nViolations of the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause) \n \n297.

The District  and its Chief of Police have had notice of this practice and have \nknowingly ignored this practice, which is consistent enough as to constitute custom. \n300.  The District and its Chief of Police have failed to respond to the need for oversight of \nthe Districtโs and the GRUโs stop and frisk practices in such a manner as to constitute \ndeliberate indifference to the risk that constitutional violations will result. \n301.  As a consequence, GRU officers have violated the constitutional rights of the class \nmembers by subjecting each to stops and/or frisks in the absence of reasonable articulable \nsuspicion in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, the Due Process Clause, and 42 U.S.C. \nยง 1983. \n302.  Named Plaintiffs and the other Class members suffered humiliation, emotional \ndistress, physical harm, loss of earnings, general damages, and legal expenses that \nresulted from being stopped, frisked and searched without justification. \n \n39 \n\n \nCas e 1:20-cv-01135-TSC   Document 14   Filed 09/30/20   Page 40 of 46\n303.  Named Plaintiffs and the other class members are therefore entitled to the relief \ndescribed herein. \nClaim 3 \nIndividual Claims of Dalonta Crudup pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against Officers \nChoi, Joseph, Laury, and Minzak in their individual and official capacities \n \n304.
