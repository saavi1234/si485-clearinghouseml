    "summary": "<p>On October 31, 2011, a group of individuals who gathered to protest the disparities in wealth and power in the United States filed this lawsuit against various Tennessee state officials in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The plaintiffs sued pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, alleging violations of their First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution, as well as their rights under the Constitution of the State of Tennessee. They alleged that they were unlawfully arrested for protesting in Nashville&rsquo;s Legislative Plaza and sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages, and attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs.</p>\r\n<p>That same day, the plaintiffs moved for, and the district court granted, a temporary restraining order to enjoin the defendants from enforcing the &ldquo;Legislative Plaza, War Memorial Courtyard and Capitol Grounds Use Policy&rdquo; (&ldquo;Use Policy&rdquo;) issued by the Tennessee Department of General Services. The plaintiffs alleged that, prior to the Occupy Nashville protest, the rules governing the use of the Plaza were understood to contain no limitation on hours and had been interpreted by the State to allow for use of the Plaza without needing to obtain a permit. However, on October 27, 2011, the rules were amended&mdash;without notice, comment, approval, and publication&mdash;to limit public access to the Plaza. According to the complaint, at around 3 a.m. on October 28, 2011, Tennessee Highway Patrol officers ordered protesters encamped in the Plaza to clear the Plaza immediately. Officers proceeded to arrest protesters who refused the order and transported them by bus to the Davidson County Sheriff&rsquo;s Criminal Justice Center. The plaintiffs alleged that, upon arrival at the jail, a Judicial Commissioner declined to find probable cause for the arrests and ordered the protesters released, but they were held for approximately five more hours and were only released after being cited with trespassing, a class &ldquo;C&rdquo; misdemeanor. The plaintiffs further alleged that the following night, October 29, 72 Highway Patrol officers arrested roughly two dozen peaceful protesters, as well as a reporter covering the protest.</p>\r\n<p>On November 16, 2011, the parties agreed to the entry of a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from enforcing the Use Policy pending further order of the court.</p>\r\n<p>On January 5, 2012, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding an additional named plaintiff who was not arrested, but alleged that her speech and political activities were curtailed out of fear of being arrested. The plaintiffs also officially added unnamed Tennessee Highway Patrol officers as defendants. The amended complaint also alleged that the defendants engaged in illegal surveillance by attempting to infiltrate an Occupy Nashville chat room, that the defendants acted with reckless and/or callous indifference to the plaintiffs&rsquo; First Amendment rights by enacting the Use Policy and that the enactment of the Use Policy and arrest of the plaintiffs each constituted retaliation against the plaintiffs for exercising their First Amendment rights. The amended complaint also sought punitive damages against certain defendants. While the plaintiffs requested class relief, it appears they never officially moved for class certification.</p>\r\n<p>In early February of 2012, the parties asked the court to stay the case so they could engage in settlement talks. On February 6, 2012, the court referred the case to Magistrate Judge Joe B. Brown for a judicial settlement conference. The parties participated in a settlement conference on April 9, 2012, but were unable to reach an agreement. The court subsequently set the case for trial.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, with the occupation of the Plaza ongoing, in March 2012, the Tennessee legislature enacted a statute banning camping on state-owned land not designated for that purpose. On April 27, 2012, the State withdrew the Use Policy and replaced it with new rules effective November 20, 2012. Throughout 2012 and into the beginning of 2013, the parties engaged in discovery.</p>\r\n<p>On March 22, 2013, both parties moved for summary judgment. On June 12, 2013, the district court granted in part and denied in part the defendants&rsquo; and plaintiffs&rsquo; respective motions for summary judgment. First, the court found that two of the defendants&mdash;the Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Safety and the Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of General Services&mdash;were not entitled to qualified immunity against the plaintiffs&rsquo; individual capacity claims, finding that enforcement of the policy, which resulted in protesters&rsquo; arrests, violated the protesters&rsquo; clearly established rights to free speech and assembly. Next, the court dismissed with prejudice the following claims against all the defendants: claims against the unnamed officers, claims under the Fifth Amendment, claims under the Tennessee Constitution and the Tennessee Uniform Administrative Procedures Act (UAPA), the selective enforcement claim, the unlawful seizure of personal property claim, the retaliation claim, the individual capacity claims by one of the named plaintiffs, and the claims for false arrest by another named plaintiff. 949 F.Supp.2d 777.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court explained that the plaintiffs had alleged several claims or demands for relief in their complaints that they had since abandoned. For instance, the plaintiffs sued unnamed officers, but they never identified them and did not dispute that the claims against those officers were no longer viable. Additionally, the court found&mdash;and the plaintiffs did not dispute&mdash;that the Fifth Amendment claim was not applicable given that the defendants were not federal officials. The plaintiffs also did not contest that the claims for monetary damages for violations of the Tennessee Constitution and the UAPA, as well as the claims for the return of personal property, were subject to dismissal. The court also reasoned that, for both the selective enforcement and retaliation claims, the plaintiffs had failed to show that their speech activities motivated the defendants&rsquo; actions. 949 F.Supp.2d 777.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Regarding the false arrest claim, the court found that the Use Policy never had any legal effect, so the plaintiffs who were arrested pursuant to it were arrested unlawfully. With respect to liability, the court granted summary judgment to all but one of the plaintiffs as to the First Amendment freedom of speech and assembly and Fourteenth Amendment due process claims, and granted summary judgment to all but two of the plaintiffs as to the unlawful arrest claims. Lastly, the court found that the plaintiffs had prevailed on their demands for injunctive relief against the individual defendants. However, noting that the plaintiffs had already successfully opposed enforcement of the Use Policy&mdash;which had since been rescinded&mdash;the court granted no further injunctive relief. The court reserved entry of final judgment until issues of damages were resolved. 949 F.Supp.2d 777.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Later that month, the defendants filed an interlocutory appeal regarding the district court&rsquo;s ruling that the defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity and were personally liable for damages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 8, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the district court&rsquo;s order denying qualified immunity and granting partial summary judgment of liability. The Sixth Circuit held that the state officials were protected by qualified immunity against the individual capacity claims. The three-judge panel agreed with the state officials that the plaintiffs&rsquo; claimed right must be defined as &ldquo;indefinite occupation of a public park,&rdquo; and found that that right, if it existed, &ldquo;certainly was not, and is not, clearly established.&rdquo; Noting that liability issues and qualified immunity are &ldquo;inextricably intertwined,&rdquo; the court explained that its ruling on qualified immunity necessarily resolved the appeal in its entirety. The Sixth Circuit remanded with instructions to enter judgment for the state officials, but declined to analyze whether a constitutional violation had in fact occurred. 769 F.3d 434.</p>\r\n<p>On January 15, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a motion for fees. On August 10, 2015, the district court granted in part and denied in part the motion for fees, awarding the plaintiffs $35,075 in fees relating to their official capacity claims only. The court first wrestled with whether the plaintiffs were in fact a prevailing party. Relying on Sixth Circuit precedent, the court concluded that they were. The court reasoned that the injunction it granted was &ldquo;&lsquo;preliminary&rsquo; in name but not in substance&rdquo;; that the court would have made the injunction permanent or entered judgment for the plaintiffs had they requested judgment before the Use Policy was rescinded; and that it would be unfair to penalize the plaintiffs for not seeking a permanent injunction while the preliminary injunction was in place, the case was stayed, and the parties were engaged in settlement negotiations.</p>\r\n<p>This case is now closed.</p>",

    "summary_short": "On October 31, 2011, a group of individuals who gathered to protest the disparities in wealth and power in the United States filed this lawsuit against various Tennessee state officials in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, alleging unlawful arrest while protesting, as well as violations of their First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution and their rights under the Constitution of the State of Tennessee. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages, and attorneysโ fees and costs. The court granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of the โLegislative Plaza, War Memorial Courtyard and Capitol Grounds Use Policyโ used to justify the arrests. In April 2012, the State rescinded the Use Policy. After competing motions for summary judgment, the court dismissed most of the plaintiffsโ claims, but with respect to liability, granted summary judgment to most of the plaintiffs on their freedom of speech and assembly, due process, and unlawful arrest claims. On interlocutory appeal, a Sixth Circuit panel held that the state official defendants in their individual capacities were entitled to qualified immunity, and vacated the lower courtโs rulings on the individual capacity claims. On August 10, 2015, the district court determined that the plaintiffs qualified as a โprevailing partyโ and granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffsโ motion for attorneysโ fees, awarding the plaintiffs $35,075 in fees relating to their official capacity claims only.

For the reasons stated herein, the motion will be granted and the \ncourt will award the plaintiffs $35,075 in fees relating to their official capacity claims only. \nBACKGROUND \n  This court and the Sixth Circuit on appeal have detailed the facts and procedural \ncircumstances of this case in previous opinions, familiarity with which is assumed.  (Docket Nos. \n88 and 92.)  Briefly, this case concerned the governmentโs October 2011 response to the \n1 \n \n\nโOccupy Nashvilleโ protests on state property located in Nashville, Tennessee, including the \nmass arrests and attempted detention of protesters on successive nights. \nI.   The Arrests, the Verified Complaint, and the TRO \nAs detailed in the courtโs earlier opinion, the incidents at issue began when, without \nutilizing available administrative procedures and notice provisions, Governor Haslamโs \nadministration unilaterally changed the rules (the โOld Policyโ) governing use of Legislative \nPlaza effective October 27, 2011.  The change was made in response to the ongoing Occupy \nNashville protests and was, by all accounts, designed to eliminate the protestersโ overnight \noccupation of the Plaza, among other things.  On the morning of October 28, 2011, law \nenforcement officers enforced the new policy (the โUse Policyโ) and arrested all of the protesters \nwho refused to leave the Plaza, thereby ending the demonstration.1  After the Night Court judge \nrefused to hear the charges, officers released the protesters several hours later.  Many of those \nprotesters (among other people) returned to protest on the Plaza again the next day.  Shortly after \nmidnight, law enforcement officers again arrested protesters who refused to leave the Plaza, and \nthe Night Court judge again ordered that the government release them. \nOn the morning of Monday, October 31, 2011 โ the first court day after the second round \nof arrests under the Use Policy โ the plaintiffs filed a Verified Complaint (Docket No. 1) and an \naccompanying Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (Docket No. 9).  In the Verified \n                                                           \n1 The parties disputed whether the Use Policy constituted a โpolicyโ or a โruleโ under the \nTennessee Administrative Procedures Act (โTAPAโ).  The court concluded that the enactment \nwas a โruleโ that should have been promulgated under TAPA.  On appeal, the Sixth Circuit \nstated that it was unnecessary to address whether this courtโs conclusion was correct but referred \nto the enactment as a โUse Policyโ for ease of reference.  The court will similarly refer to it as \nthe โUse Policy,โ although the court continues to regard it as a โruleโ subject to TAPA \nrulemaking procedures.  \n2 \n \n\nComplaint, the plaintiffs asserted claims against Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam, \nCommissioner of the Tennessee Department of Safety Williams L. Gibbons, and Commissioner \nof the Tennessee Department of General Services Steven G. Cates, including state and federal \nconstitutional claims relating to violations of the plaintiffsโ rights to free speech, freedom of \nassembly, freedom from unlawful search and seizure of property, and freedom from unlawful \narrest.  The Verified Complaint, which was supported by affidavits from seven named plaintiffs, \nsought a declaration that the Use Policy was unenforceable, an injunction against continued \nenforcement of the Use Policy, the return of all seized items, monetary damages for unlawful \ndetention, and attorneyโs fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988.  In the Motion for Temporary \nRestraining Order, the plaintiffs asked the court immediately to enjoin enforcement of the Use \nPolicy. \nThat afternoon, the court held a hearing concerning the request for injunctive relief.  In \nadvance of the hearing, the parties submitted a joint proposed Temporary Restraining Order \nagainst enforcement of the Use Policy.  At the hearing, the court indicated that it would enter the \nproposed order.  The court also stated on the record that it would have granted temporary relief \nin any case, because (1) the Use Policy constituted a set of โrulesโ that should have been, but \nwere not, promulgated under the Tennessee Administrative Procedures Act, (2) the Legislative \nPlaza was a โquintessential public forum,โ and (3) the Use Policy imposed a โclear prior restraint \nof free speech rights.โ  (Docket No. 13 at 3:1-13.)  The court also expressed that it was โgratified \nand not too surprised . . . that the State is taking the position that itโs taking[.]โ  (Id. at 3:14-17.)  \nFollowing the hearing, the court entered the joint proposed Temporary Restraining Order \n(Docket No. 11), which enjoined the defendants from enforcing the Use Policy, did not require \nthe plaintiffs to post a bond, and otherwise permitted the government to enforce existing valid \n3 \n \n\ncriminal and civil laws.  With the partiesโ agreement, the court set a hearing to convert the TRO \nto a preliminary injunction for November 21, 2011.  (Id.)   \nII. The Preliminary Injunction  \nOn November 16, 2011 (five days before the hearing date), the parties filed a joint \nproposed Agreed Order Establishing Preliminary Injunction.  (Docket No. 14.)  On November \n17, 2011, the court entered the agreed order (hereinafter, the โPreliminary Injunctionโ), which \n(1) converted the TRO into a preliminary injunction, (2) enjoined the defendants from enforcing \nthe Use Policy against the plaintiffs and against anyone else, pending further order of the court, \nand (3) permitted the injunction to remain unsecured.  The order also stated that the preliminary \ninjunction โshall remain in effect until such time as the Court specifically orders otherwise,โ that \nit did not preclude either party from moving to modify the injunction or to move for permanent \ninjunctive relief, and that it did not preclude the government from subsequent rulemaking \nconcerning the use of the Plaza and the other public forums at issue (the War Memorial and the \nCapitol Grounds).  In a June 12, 2013 opinion, this court stated that, โ[i]n essence, the \nPreliminary Injunction converted the TRO into an indefinite injunction against enforcement of \nthe Use Policy without a bond requirement.โ  (Docket No. 88 at p. 4.)  As the Sixth Circuit later \nagreed on appeal, effective November 17, 2011, the Use Policy was no longer in effect. \nIII.   The Amended Complaint, Settlement Discussions, and Rule Changes \nOn January 5, 2012, the plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint that added class claims, \nclaims against unnamed โJohn Doeโ officers, and a First Amendment retaliation claim.  The \n4 \n \n\nAmended Complaint otherwise included substantially the same official capacity claims as the \nVerified Complaint.2   \nOn February 3, 2012, the court held an initial case management conference, at which the \ndefendants informed the court that the legislature was working on a law that would address the \nongoing protests on the Plaza.  In the partiesโ proposed case management order (Docket No. 21), \nthe defendants took the position that the plaintiffs should not be entitled โto any further \ninjunctive relief, declaratory relief, or money damages.โ  (Docket No. 21 at p. 2 (emphasis \nadded).)   By agreement, the parties also asked the court to stay the case to permit them to \nconduct judicially supervised settlement discussions.  On February 6, 2012, the court entered an \nOrder referring the case to Magistrate Judge Brown to oversee settlement discussions.  (Docket \nNo. 22.)  Despite multiple conferences with the Magistrate Judge (Docket Nos. 23, 25, 26, 27, \nand 28), the parties were unable to reach a settlement.     \nWhile the stay was in place and the parties were attempting to negotiate a settlement, the \ncourtโs understanding is that (1) the uninterrupted โoccupationโ of the Plaza continued, and (2) \nthe State of Tennessee attempted to revise the laws (using appropriate procedures) to forbid \ncontinuous occupation of the Plaza.  In March 2012, Tennessee enacted a statute that banned \ncamping on state-owned land not designated for that purpose.  On April 27, 2012, the \nDepartment of General Services withdrew the Use Policy entirely and replaced it with a different \nset of rules (the โCurrent Rulesโ), which became effective November 20, 2012.  See Tenn. \nComp. R. &. Regs. 0690-06-01-.01 to .04.   \nOn April 11, 2012, in light of the failure of the partiesโ settlement discussions, the district \ncourt withdrew the referral to the Magistrate Judge and set a case management conference to \n                                                           \n2 The plaintiffs never pursued the class action claims or the John Doe claims. \n5 \n \n\ntake place in May 2012.  (Docket No. 29.)  After a conference on May 21, 2012, the court \nentered a Case Management Order in substantially the same form as the earlier proposed order \n(resetting the deadlines accordingly).  (Docket No. 37.) \nIV.   Rule 56 Motions and the Defendantsโ Appeal of Money Damages Ruling \n  The parties continued to litigate the money damages claims.  In March 2013, following \ndiscovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment (Docket Nos. 67 (defendants) \nand 72 (plaintiffs).)  On June 12, 2013, the court granted the motions in part and denied them in \npart.  (Docket No. 89.)   \nIn the courtโs opinion on the summary judgment motions, the court rejected the \ndefendantsโ contention that the plaintiffs had โabandonedโ their demand for injunctive relief, \nfinding that the plaintiffs had โalready prevailed on their demand for injunctive relief against \nenforcement of the Use Policy.โ  (Docket No. 88 at p. 14.)  The court stated that โthe plaintiffs \ndo not presently need declaratory or injunctive relief because they already successfully opposed \nenforcement of the Use Policy, which the DGS rescinded in April 2012 and formally replaced \nwith the Current Rules on November 20, 2012.โ  (Id.)  In a footnote, the court also indicated that, \nโif the defendants had continued to seek to enforce the Use Policy through the present date, the \ncourt undoubtedly would have issued a declaratory judgment that the Use Policy was not a valid \nlaw and that it would have been unconstitutional to enforce it in any respect.โ  (Id. at p. 15 n.13.)  \nThe court further stated that โonly claims seeking money damages relief remain for the courtโs \nresolution at this stageโ and that, โ[p]ut another way, the plaintiffs have already prevailed on \ntheir official capacity claims and now seek money damages against the defendants in their \nindividual capacities.โ  (Id.)  In two footnotes, the court presaged the motion at issue, noting that \nthe partiesโ briefs did not address the issue of whether plaintiffs would seek to recover either \n6 \n \n\npunitive damages or attorneyโs fees โwith respect to their successful claims for injunctive relief, \nlet alone what fees would reasonably be attributable to those claims.โ  (Id. at p. 15 n.13; see also \nid. at p. 17 n.16.)   \nAs to the money damages claims, the court found that that the plaintiffsโ constitutional \nrights were violated and that Commissioners Cates and Gibbons were not entitled to qualified \nimmunity as to three of the plaintiffsโ claims.  The court therefore granted judgment to the \nplaintiffs on liability.  In its Order on the motions, the court accordingly held, in most relevant \npart, that (1) Commissioners Cates and Gibbons were personally liable to certain plaintiffs on \nthree claims, and (2) with respect to the official capacity claims, โ[a]lthough no further equitable \nrelief is required from the court, the plaintiffs have prevailed on their official capacity claims \nagainst Governor Haslam, Commissioner Cates, and Commissioner Gibbons.โ  (Docket No. 89 \n(emphasis added).)   The Order also set a deadline for the parties to submit a joint statement as to \nwhether any further proceedings would be necessary relative to damages and fee-shifting.   \nOn June 27, 2013, before the joint statement deadline concerning damages and fees, \nGibbons and Cates filed an interlocutory appeal of the courtโs ruling denying qualified immunity \nand its related findings in favor of the plaintiffs concerning the individual capacity claims against \nCates and Gibbons.  (Docket No. 90.)  On October 8, 2014, the Sixth Circuit reversed, finding \nthat Gibbons and Cates were entitled to qualified immunity (Docket No. 92).  The Sixth Circuit \nheld that Cates and Gibbons were entitled to qualified immunity because the constitutional right \nat issue โ the right to โindefinite occupation of a public parkโ โ was not clearly established by \nSupreme Court precedent.  See Occupy Nashville v. Haslam, 769 F.3d 434 (6th Cir. 2014).  The \nSixth Circuitโs opinion explicitly did not analyze whether a constitutional violation had occurred \nin the first place.  The Sixth Circuit also took no position on whether the district court had \n7 \n \n\ncorrectly concluded that (1) the Use Policy had been implemented in derogation of the TAPA \nand (2) the failure to comply with TAPA contributed to the asserted constitutional violations.3 \nOn remand, the district court vacated the June 12, 2013 judgment against Gibbons and \nCates only as it related to the individual capacity claims.  (Docket No. 94.) \nV.  Motion for Fees \n  On January 15, 2015, the plaintiffs filed the instant Motion for Fees (Docket No. 100), in \nsupport of which they filed a Memorandum of Law (Docket No. 101) and declarations from \nthree attorneys who worked on the case.  (Docket Nos. 102 (Declaration of C. David Briley), 103 \n(Declaration of Tricia Herzfeld), and 104 (Declaration of Patrick Frogge).)  The defendants filed \na Response in opposition (Docket No. 105), which attached the Declaration of Dawn Jordan (id., \nAttach. No. 1.)  The plaintiffs filed a Reply (Docket No. 107), in support of which they filed \ndeclarations from two outside attorneys concerning the reasonableness of the fees requested by \nMs. Herzfeld, Mr. Briley, and Mr. Frogge.  (Docket Nos. 108 (Declaration of William L. \nHarbison) and 109 (Declaration of Kyle Mothershead).)    \nANALYSIS \nI.  Are the Plaintiffs โPrevailing Partiesโ under ยง 1988? \nA.  Legal Standard \n  Under ยง 1988(b), โthe court, in its discretion, may award the prevailing party . . . a \nreasonable attorneyโs fee as part of the costs[.]โ  As construed by the Supreme Court, the \n                                                           \n3 Because Commissioner Gibbons is the husband of Sixth Circuit Judge Julia Gibbons, all of the \nSixth Circuit judges recused themselves from hearing the appeal.  The Committee on Intercircuit \nAssignments of the Judicial Conference of the United States assigned a special panel of three \njudges from other circuits to hear the appeal.  Under the circumstances, the panel understandably \nproceeded with caution as โguests of the Sixth Circuitโ (769 F.3d at 444 n.19), limiting its \nfindings only to those necessary to resolve the appeal.  \n8 \n \n\nstatutory presumption is that the court โmustโ award fees to โprevailingโ plaintiffs.  Hensley v. \nEckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 429 (1983).  In Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Depโt of \nHealth & Human Res., 532 U.S. 598, 602 (2001), the Supreme Court observed that a party can \nโprevailโ by receiving a judgment on the merits or by entering into a settlement agreement made \nenforceable through a consent decree.  Buckhannon did not address whether a plaintiff may also \nโprevailโ under other circumstances, such as prevailing on a Rule 65 motion for injunctive relief.  \nIn Sole v. Wyner, 551 U.S. 74, 86 (2007), the Court held that a plaintiff does not establish \nprevailing party status if a preliminary injunction is later โreversed, dissolved, or otherwise \nundone by the final decision in the same case,โ because ยง 1988 requires lasting relief, not the \ntemporary, โfleeting successโ that the injunction represented in that case.  Sole explicitly left \nopen โwhether, in the absence of a final decision on the merits . . . , success in gaining a \npreliminary injunction may sometimes warrant an award of counsel fees.โ  Id. at 86.  \n  Although neither party references the case here, in McQueary v. Conway, 614 F.3d 591 \n(6th Cir. 2010), the Sixth Circuit explicitly addressed the issue left open in Buckhannon and Sole.  \nIn McQueary, the plaintiff challenged the constitutional validity of a Kentucky law that limited \nhis ability to protest at military funerals, claiming that the law violated his rights under the First \nand the Fourteenth Amendments.  Id. at 595.  Upon motion by the plaintiff, the court \npreliminarily enjoined Kentucky from enforcing two subsections of the law.  Id. at 596.  Six \nmonths later, the Kentucky legislature repealed these two subsections, and the court \nconsequently dismissed the action as moot.  Id.  The district court denied McQuearyโs request for \nfees under ยง 1988.  Id.  On appeal, the Sixth Circuit considered the specific question of โwhether \nor when the winner of a preliminary injunction may be treated as a โprevailing partyโ entitled to \nattorneyโs feesโ under ยง 1988.  Id. at 596.   \n9 \n \n\nThe Sixth Circuit reasoned from basic principles.  First, it observed that, โto be a \nprevailing party, the plaintiff must obtain a material change in the legal relationship between \nhimself and the defendant,โ which change must โdirectly benefit the plaintiff by modifying the \ndefendantโs behavior toward him,โ as opposed to a โsymbolic victoryโ that is not compensable.  \nId. at 598 (internal brackets and citations omitted).  Second, ยง 1988 is designed to award fees to \ndeserving parties, not to generate satellite litigation over fees.  Id. at 598.  Turning to the possible \nrules for fee-shifting as it relates to injunctive relief, the Sixth Circuit explicitly rejected a bright-\nline rule that procuring injunctive relief alone never suffices under ยง 1988.  \n[T]his approach fails to account for fact patterns in which the claimant receives \neverything it asked for in the lawsuit, and all that moots the case is court-ordered \nsuccess and the passage of time.  When protesters seek an injunction to exercise \ntheir First Amendment rights at a specific time and placeโsay to demonstrate at a \nSaturday paradeโa preliminary injunction will give them all the court-ordered \nrelief they need and the end of the parade will moot the case.  In what way are \nsuch claimants not prevailing parties?  We think that they are.  The same is true of \na government employee who seeks to exclude an unconstitutionally obtained \nreport from an administrative hearing and obtains a preliminary injunction that \nirrevocably excludes the report. \n \nNot all preliminary injunctions, as these examples show, have merely a catalytic \neffect.  The defendants in these cases did not voluntarily change their conduct.  \nAn immediately enforceable preliminary injunction compelled them to.  And in \neach instance, the plaintiffs obtained all of the relief they requested once the \npreliminary injunction served its purpose. \n \nThe plaintiffs in all of these cases, it is true, might have avoided the โpreliminaryโ \nlabel attached to their victories by asking the courts to convert their motions for a \npreliminary injunction into motions for a final injunction.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n65(a)(2).  Yet Rule 65 is not the Rosetta Stone to prevailing-party inquiries.  A \ndistrict court may, but it does not have to, grant Rule 65 requests, and nothing \nabout the nature of the prevailing party inquiry suggests that it should turn on \nwhether a district court happens to embrace this administrative streamlining \ndevice.  In the final analysis, the preliminary nature of the relief does not by itself \nprovide a ground for never granting fees. \n \n10 \n \n\nId. at 599 (citations omitted).  The court also rejected a per se rule that preliminary injunction \nwinners always are eligible for fees, given that โ[s]ome preliminary injunctions have nothing to \ndo with the merits, offering no insight into whether one party or the other will prevail at the end \nof the case,โ such as โstay-put or status quo injunctionsโ that โturn more on the graveness of \nirreparable harm to one party or to the public interest than on the legal virtues of the partiesโ \npositions.โ  Id. at 600. \n  In light of these considerations, the Sixth Circuit indicated that, in determining whether to \naward fees to a preliminary injunction winner, a district court should make a โcontextual and \ncase-specific inquiry.โ  Id. at 601.  The Sixth Circuit also cautioned that, โ[i]n the aftermath of \nBuckhannon and Sole, however, we can say that the โpreliminaryโ nature of the relief together \nwith the requirement that a prevailing-party victory must create a lasting change in the legal \nrelationship between the parties and not merely โcatalyzeโ the defendant to voluntary actionโ\nwill generally counsel against fees in the context of preliminary injunctions.โ  Id. \n  Turning to the case before it, the Sixth Circuit rejected the district courtโs justifications \nfor denying fees to the plaintiff.  The Sixth Circuit found that McQueary had directly benefited \nfrom the preliminary injunction, which permitted him to protest at military funerals without fear \nof prosecution under the challenged Kentucky laws.  Id. at 601-02.  The Sixth Circuit also found \nthat it made no difference whether the plaintiff prevailed on a facial challenge (overbreadth) or \non an โas-appliedโ challenge.  Id. at 602.  As the court observed, one of the justifications for ยง \n1988 is that it allows individual citizens to act as private attorneys general, โmaking it odd to say \nthat the litigant who truly acts on behalf of other citizens by bringing an overbreadth challenge is \nnot entitled to fees.โ  Id.  Despite these findings, the Sixth Circuit held that the question of \nwhether McQueary should collect fees was for the district court in the first instance: \n11 \n \n\nThat question is for the district court, which had a ring-side view of the \nunderlying proceedings, which is in the best position to make an initial cut at \nwhether [the plaintiff] deserves fees for this preliminary injunction and which is \ngiven considerable deference over most aspects of the fees inquiry.  Buckhannon, \nSole, and Dubuc make clear, we think, that, when a claimaint wins a preliminary \ninjunction and nothing more, that usually will not suffice to obtain fees under \nยง 1988.  What remains unclear is when the occasional exceptions to that rule \nshould apply, a contextual and case-specific inquiry that we ask the district court \nto undertake in the first instance. \n \nId. at 604.4 \nB.  Application \nThe State argues that the April 2012 withdrawal of the Use Policy foreclosed the \nplaintiffs from recovering fees on their official capacity claims.     \nAs the court stated multiple times in its June 2013 opinion, the court viewed (and \ncontinues to view) the plaintiffs as having prevailed on their official capacity claims.  The state \njointly agreed to the TRO and jointly agreed to the Preliminary Injunction, which effectively \nconverted the TRO into an indefinite injunction.  Not surprisingly, the government never \n                                                           \n4 Incidentally, the district court on remand again held that the plaintiff was not entitled to fees, \nSee McQueary v. Conway, 2012 WL 3149344 (E.D. Ky. Aug. 1, 2012).  That decision is \ndistinguishable for multiple reasons.  First, the district court construed the Sixth Circuit decision \nas precluding relief except where, after the passage of a defined event, a preliminary injunction \ncan no longer be revoked.  Here, as explained herein, the court does not read the initial Sixth \nCircuit decision in McQueary so narrowly.  Second, in McQueary, it does not appear that the \nplaintiff sought to protest at a specific place at a specific point in time; he sought the right to \nprotest at military funerals in general, whenever they may have occurred in the future.  By \ncontrast, as explained in the next section of this courtโs opinion, the Occupy Nashville protesters \nsought and obtained immediate relief to protest at a specific place (the Legislative Plaza) at a \nspecific point in time (i.e., to continue their ongoing protests into November 2011 and \nthereafter).  At any rate, reviewing only for โclear error,โ the Sixth Court held in an unpublished \nper curiam opinion that the district courtโs decision to deny fees to McQueary was not clearly \nerroneous.  McQueary v. Conway, 508 F. Appโx 522 (6th Cir. 2012).  For all of these reasons, \nthe later proceedings in McQueary do not dictate a result in favor of the defendants here. \n12 \n \n\nindicated to the court or to the plaintiffs that it would seek to challenge the preliminary \ninjunction.  Indeed, as the court expressed at the initial TRO hearing and again in its June 2013 \nopinion, it believed that the Use Policy was patently unconstitutional and unenforceable, it \nviewed the plaintiffsโ official capacity claims as meritorious, and it โundoubtedlyโ would have \nmade the injunction permanent or entered judgment for the plaintiffs if they had sought judgment \nbefore the Use Policy was rescinded in April 2012.   \nThe TRO and the Preliminary Injunction directly benefitted the plaintiffs and the other \nprotesters, who resumed the protests without fear of arrest.  The possibility of arrest was not an \nidle threat: on two successive nights preceding this lawsuit, law enforcement officers arrested \nnumerous protesters, removed them from the Plaza, charged them with crimes, and temporarily \ndetained them.  Had the plaintiffs not sought and obtained relief from the court, the government \npresumably would have continued to arrest the plaintiffs and other protesters on the Plaza who \ndefied the Use Policy.  The entry of injunctive relief by the court (through the TRO and the \nPreliminary Injunction) gave the plaintiffs the immediate relief that they sought: the right to \ncontinue protesting on Legislative Plaza.  Indeed, it appears that they continued their protests for \nmonths thereafter, until the government passed a new law in the Spring of 2012. \nThe court interprets the Sixth Circuitโs well-reasoned opinion in McQueary to stand for \nthe proposition that, in evaluating whether a plaintiff who obtains Rule 65 relief should be \nconsidered a โprevailing party,โ the court should not elevate form over substance.  Here, it would \nbe the epitome of form over substance to conclude that the protesters did not โprevailโ on their \nofficial capacity claims.  The defendants agreed to enjoin enforcement of the Use Policy in \nresponse to this lawsuit, and the court at the TRO hearing and again in its June 2013 opinion \n13 \n \n\nmade clear that the official capacity claims were meritorious.  The relief entered by the court was \nโpreliminaryโ in name but not in substance.   \nThe plaintiffs cannot be faulted for not seeking permanent or dispositive relief before \nApril 2012.  First, as a procedural matter, the court requires parties to request leave before \nmoving for interim dispositive relief, and the court generally does not allow early motions for \npartial summary judgment, absent special circumstances.  Indeed, in this case, the court denied \nthe defendantsโ pre-discovery request for leave to file a motion for partial summary judgment.  \n(See Docket No. 36.)  Second, by agreement with the defendants, the plaintiffs agreed to stay the \ncase to discuss settlement between February 2012 and April 2012.  Under the circumstances, it \nwould be unfair to hold it against the plaintiffs that they declined to move for permanent relief or \nfor an early judgment on the official capacity claims where (1) there was no need to do so (the \ngovernment effectively conceded injunctive relief was appropriate and would continue \nindefinitely), (2) the courtโs merits decision on the official capacity claims was a fait accompli, \n(3) the parties were attempting to reach a settlement without the further expense of time and \nresources, and (4) for purposes of judicial economy and procedural fairness, the district court \ngenerally discourages parties from filing early Rule 56 motions.     \nMore broadly, denying fees here would not serve the policy interests behind ยง 1988, \nwhich is designed to permit parties who bring meritorious constitutional claims to recover their \nattorneyโs fees.  The statute empowers individuals to enforce their constitutional rights and to \nprevent enforcement of unconstitutional laws, regardless of whether they can pay for an attorney \nout-of-pocket.  The statute also incentivizes quality attorneys (such as the plaintiffsโ attorneys \nhere) to take on meritorious constitutional cases.  Here, those interests would be violated if the \n14 \n \n\ncourt refused to grant the plaintiffs any fees relative to the official capacity claims on which they \nprevailed. \nThe plaintiffs contend that they should receive their fees through April 2012, when the \nUse Policy was revoked.  However, the court agrees with the defendants that the plaintiffs should \nnot receive fees for work performed after November 17, 2011, the date on which the court \nentered the Preliminary Injunction.  The plaintiffs have not shown โ nor do the billing records \nreflect โ that work performed after that date was specific to the terms of the Preliminary \nInjunction or the substance of the official capacity claims. \nFor these contextual and case-specific reasons, the court finds that the plaintiffs prevailed \non their official capacity claims for purposes of ยง 1988 and that the plaintiffs are entitled to their \nreasonable fees and expenses through November 17, 2011, to the extent that those fees are \nreasonably attributable to the official capacity claims. \nII. Calculation of Fees \nA.  Legal Standard \nThe party seeking an attorney's fee award pursuant to a statute has two main obligations: \n(1) to provide the court with โevidence supporting the hours worked and rates claimedโ and (2) \nto demonstrate that the requested fee award is โreasonable.โ  Building Service Local 47 v. \nGrandview Raceway, 46 F.3d 1392, 1402 (6th Cir. 1995); U.S. Structures v. J.P. Structures, 130 \nF.3d 1185, 1193 (6th Cir. 1997).  Here, the plaintiffs have provided declarations that attach \nitemized time records and task descriptions for the attorneys (and their associated support staff) \nwho performed work for the plaintiffs in this case.  These records provide the court โevidence \nsupporting the hours worked and rates claimed.โ  The remaining question is whether, in light of \nall of the circumstances of this case, the fee award sought is โreasonable.โ \n15 \n \n\nThe starting point for determining the reasonableness of a requested fee is the โlodestarโ \nanalysis, whereby the requested fee is compared with the amount generated by multiplying the \nnumber of hours reasonably worked on the litigation by the reasonable hourly rate.  U.S. \nStructures, 130 F.3d at 1193.  A reasonable hourly rate is determined by considering the skill, \nexperience, and reputation of the attorneys involved and the market in which they practice. \nAdcockโLadd v. Secโy of Treasury, 227 F.3d 343, 350 (6th Cir. 2000).  If the requested fee is \nessentially in line with the โlodestar,โ then there is a strong presumption that the requested fee is \nreasonable and recoverable.  Id. \nIn addition to the lodestar analysis, the court should also consider any relevant \nโJohnsonโ factors and whether some adjustment to the award is required under those factors. \nSee Reed v. Rhodes, 179 F.3d 453, 471 (6th Cir. 1999) (citing Johnson v. Ga. Highway Express, \nInc., 488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1974)).  These factors are: (1) the time and labor required by a given \ncase; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions presented; (3) the skill needed to perform the \nlegal service properly; (4) the preclusion of employment by the attorney due to acceptance of the \ncase; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations \nimposed by the client or the circumstances; (8) the amount involved and the results obtained; (9) \nthe experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the โundesirabilityโ of the case; (11) \nthe nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar \ncases.  Id.  The Sixth Circuit has recognized that, often, these factors are naturally blended into \nthe reasonableness analysis.  Paschal v. Flagstar Bank, 297 F.3d 431, 435 (6th Cir. 2002). \nB.  Lodestar Analysis \n1.  The Attorneys and Their Respective Billing Rates \n16 \n \n\nAttorney Briley requests $395 per hour for his services.  Mr. Briley has worked for \nthirteen years at the law firm of Bone McAlester Norton PLLC, handling a variety of civil \nlitigation matters including corporate litigation, general civil litigation, personal injury, workers \ncompensation and class action litigation.  He represents that the rates billed in this case are those \nbilled to paying clients for the work performed.  His affidavit attaches itemized billing records \nthat reflect the date of each task, the work performed, the hours spent on each task, and the total \nbilled amount.  His billing records reflect 55.65 hours of work performed through November 17, \n2011.5 \nAttorney Patrick Frogge is a partner at the law firm of Bell, Tennent & Frogge.  He has \npracticed law for fourteen years, including two years as judicial clerk, two years as a staff \nattorney for the Metro Nashville Public Defenderโs Office, two years as a solo practitioner, and \nthe past eight years at his current firm.  Although his primary practice is criminal law, he has \nhandled โnumerousโ civil rights cases in state and federal court.6  His affidavit attaches itemized \nbilling records that reflect the work performed on particular dates and the hours expended on \neach task.  The records reflect 38 hours billed through November 17, 2011.  He seeks $300 per \nhour for his time spent on the case.   \n                                                           \n5 A paralegal also performed work on the case at a rate of $150 per hour.  However, all of the \nparalegal time entries are for tasks performed after November 17, 2011, so the court need not \nmake findings as to the reasonableness of this rate or the time expended. \n6 Although not referenced by Frogge in his affidavit, a review of this courtโs docket validates \nFroggeโs assertion that he has handled several civil rights cases.  See, e.g., Keeton v. Metro Govโt \nof Nashville, Davidson Cnty., No. 3:06-cv-0431 (M.D. Tenn. removed April 28, 2006); Bilyeu v. \nMetro Govโt of Nashvlle/Davidson Cnty., Docket No. 3:06-cv-0718 (M.D. Tenn. removed July \n25, 2006); and Simpson v. Metro Govโt of Nashville & Davidson Cnty., No. 3:08-cv-0089 (M.D. \nTenn. removed Jan. 28, 2008). \n17 \n \n\nAttorney Tricia Herzfeld has practiced law for 13 years, including three years as an \nassistant public defender in the Miami Defenders Office, two years handling mainly insurance \ndefense claims at a law firm in West Virginia, five years litigating constitutional matters as a \nstaff attorney and Legal Director for the ACLU Foundation of Tennessee, and most recently as a \nSenior Counsel at Ozment Law.  She seeks $350 per hour for her time and $105 per hour for \ntime spent by Paralegals.7  Her declaration attaches itemized billing records reflecting the tasks \nperformed on a given date and the person performing the task.  Her billing records reflect 42.1 \nhours expended by Ms. Herzfeld through November 17, 2011 and 5.0 hours expended by a \nparalegal.  Many of the entries appear to be 0.1 hour entries for sending and receiving emails. \nAttorneys Bill Harbison and Kyle Mothershead, both of whom are well known to the \ncourt, have filed affidavits attesting to the reasonableness of the rates sought by Briley, Frogge, \nand Herzfeld.  Harbisonโs Declaration is especially persuasive, as Mr. Harbison is the current \nPresident of the Tennessee Bar Association, a member of the Tennessee Supreme Court Board of \nLaw Examiners, and a past President of the Nashville Bar Association, with over three decades \nof litigation experience, including civil rights work in the Nashville area.  He avers that attorneys \nHerzfeld, Briley, and Frogge have excellent reputations and that the rates they each seek are at \nleast commensurate with the rates of attorneys of similar ability, skill, and reputation.  He avers \nthat the rates sought actually reflect a discount from the market rates that they could have \ndemanded.  Mothershead, likewise, is complimentary of plaintiffsโ counsel: โI am astonished the \nPlaintiffsโ attorneys were able to produce such high-quality work product given the hours \nexpended.โ  (Docket No. 109 at p. 3.) \n                                                           \n7 Her firm also seeks $125 per hour for time spent by Law Clerks, but the billing records do not \nreflect any work performed by a Law Clerk through November 17, 2011. \n18 \n \n\nThe court finds that all of the attorney rates sought are reasonable.  The court also finds \nthat the paralegal rate sought by Ms. Herzfeldโs firm ($105 per hour) is reasonable. \n2.  Reasonableness of Time Expended \nThe defendants raise two types of challenges to the reasonableness of the time charges.   \nFirst, the defendants contend that all three attorneys seek recovery for time spent on \nissues other than the official capacity claims, such as the class action claims, the money damages \nclaims, and separate criminal proceedings concerning certain protesters.  Specifically, they argue \nthat 24.65 of Mr. Brileyโs 55.65 hours, 12.8 of Mr. Froggeโs 38 hours, and 6.1 of Ms. Herzfeldโs \n42.1 hours through November 17, 2011 should be disallowed on this basis.  The court agrees \nwith the defendants that most of these hours should be disallowed because they either explicitly \nrelate to non-compensable issues or, in some instances, because the plaintiffs have not \ndemonstrated that the charges are sufficiently related to the official capacity claims to justify fee-\nshifting.  For example, with respect to Mr. Briley, multiple entries reference work concerning \nโabstentionโ and โcriminal matters,โ neither of which concern the official capacity claims.  Of \nthe hours challenged on this basis, the court will allow only 3 of the 24.65 hours challenged \nrelative to Mr. Briley (i.e., excluding 21.65 hours), only 3.2 of the 12.8 hours challenged relative \nto Mr. Frogge (i.e., excluding 9.6 hours),8 and none of the 6.1 hours challenged relative to Ms. \nHerzfeld. \n                                                           \n8 With respect to the entry for 1.5 hours concerning phone calls from protesters and the \narguments to the Night Court judge, the court finds that the entry is reasonably related to the \nofficial capacity claims because the unlawful arrest and detention of the protesters was the \nnecessary predicate for this lawsuit.  The court also finds that at least 1.7 additional challenged \nhours were reasonably related to the official capacity claims. \n19 \n \n\nSecond, the defendants argue that it was unreasonable for all three attorneys to have \nbilled significant hours on October 29 and 30, 2011 (totaling 21 hours by Briley, 20.5 hours by \nFrogge, and 8 hours by Herzfeld).  The defendants argue that the work performed by these three \nattorneys on those days was redundant and unnecessary.  Although the billing on these dates \ndoes reflect joint efforts by all three attorneys, sometimes on similar tasks, the efforts were made \nunder the inordinate press of working together during the two weekend days preceding the filing \nof the Verified Complaint on Monday, October 31, 2011.  Law enforcement officials had just \narrested scores of protesters on two successive nights, and it is not surprising that it took some \ntime to (1) interview the potential plaintiffs and witnesses, (2) identify and research the various \nlegal issues, including sensitive First Amendment and Due Process claims, (3) draft a detailed, \nsworn Verified Complaint that included a robust description of the background facts and that \nasserted state and federal claims against multiple defendants, and (4) draft a Motion for \nTemporary Restraining Order with supporting legal arguments.  Under the circumstances, it is \nunderstandable that it took a โteam effortโ to accomplish these and other tasks in a short time \nframe.  The court therefore finds these challenged hours to be reasonable. \nIn sum, the court finds that Mr. Briley reasonably expended 34 hours (55.65 hours \nsought, less 21.65 disallowed hours), Mr. Frogge reasonably expended 28.4 hours (38 hours \nsought, less 9.6 disallowed hours), and Ms. Herzfeld reasonably expended 36 hours (42.1 hours \nsought, less 6.1 disallowed hours) on the official capacity claims through November 17, 2011.  \nThe defendants do not challenge the 5.0 hour time entry for paralegal services performed by Ms. \nHerzfeldโs firm.  The court finds the time spent on the listed tasks performed on October 30, \n2011 (drafting declarations and speaking with the plaintiffs) to be reasonable. \nThus, the individual lodestar amounts are as follows: \n20 \n \n\nโข  Mr. Briley: 34 hours X $395 per hour = $13,430 \nโข  Mr. Frogge: 28.4 hours X $300 per hour = $8,520 \nโข  Ms. Herzfeld: 36.0 hours X $350 per hour = $12,600, plus 5.0 paralegal hours X \n$105 per hour = $525. \n \nIn sum, the total lodestar amount is $35,075.  \nC.  Johnson Factors \nThe plaintiffs argue that the court should depart upward from the lodestar because of the \nundesirability of the case.  To justify an enhancement, the plaintiffs must present โspecific \nevidenceโ supporting an upward departure.  The plaintiffs have not pointed to any specific \nevidence showing that an enhancement is warranted.  Indeed, in response to this argument, the \ndefendants have produced news clippings in which the plaintiffsโ attorneys made statements to \nthe media following the arrests, and there is no indication that the plaintiffs had difficulty \nattracting capable attorneys who, in the eyes of many, were heroes. \nFor their part, the defendants argue that a downward departure from the lodestar is \nwarranted because the plaintiffs had only limited success.  The court has already limited the \nscope of the award only to expenses related to the official capacity claims through November 17, \n2011.  Therefore, no further adjustment to account for the โscope of successโ is necessary or \nwarranted. \nIII.   Expenses \nThe plaintiffs appear to seek to recover $190 for a court reporter in the state criminal \nproceeding.  That charge is not related to the official capacity claims and will be disallowed.  \nThe plaintiffs have not requested any other expenses. \nCONCLUSION \n21 \n \n\nFor the reasons stated herein, the plaintiffsโ Motion for Fees will be granted in part and \ndenied in part.  Under ยง 1988, the court will award the plaintiffs fees of $35,075 relative to the \nofficial capacity claims. \nAn appropriate order will enter. \n_____________________________ \nALETA A.

This is an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for declaratory and injunctive relief \nand monetary damages to redress an unconstitutional denial of the Plaintiffsโ right of free speech, \nexpression and assembly guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution \nof the United States and Article 1, ยง 19 and ยง 23 of the Constitution of the State of Tennessee. \n \n{CDB0003.4}\nCase 3:11-cv-01037   Document 18   Filed 01/05/12   Page 1 of 24 PageID #: 76\n\nPARTIES \n  2.  Plaintiff Occupy Nashville is an unincorporated organization that seeks to bring \nattention to the imbalance in our financial and economic system, to ensure that elected leaders \nare as concerned about and responsive to citizens of our country without means or with moderate \nmeans as they are to those with the most and to eliminate the excessive, unwarranted influence of \nmoney and corporations in political decision making.  It maintains a website to view its live-\nstreaming activities at: http://occupynashville.org/streaming-video/  It communicates with its \nmembers  and  the  public  through  http://www.facebook.com/OccupyNashville  and \nhttp://twitter.com/#!/OccupyNashville.  \n  3.  Plaintiff Paula Elaine Painter, 55, is a citizen of the United States of America and \nresident of the State of Tennessee who was unlawfully arrested at Legislative Plaza in Nashville, \nTennessee, in the early morning of October 28, 2011, and then again early in the morning of \nOctober 29, 2011.  Ms. Painter has been as a librarian for more than twenty (20) years during her \nprofessional career.  After recently  losing her job as a librarian, she has been taking care of her \nelderly father.   \n  4.  Plaintiff Malina Chavez Shannon, 34, is a citizen of the United States of America \nand  resident  of  the  State  of  Tennessee  and  a  college  student.    She  also  is  training  as  a \nphotographer.    In  the  early  morning  of  October  29,  2011,  Ms.  Shannon  was  travelling  to \nLegislative Plaza on foot after parking her car.  Before she reached the plaza, while she was on \nthe sidewalk, she was detained and arrested by members of the Tennessee Highway Patrol \n(โTHPโ).  She was handcuffed by one of the unnamed members of the THP so tightly that a \nnurse at the Metro jail had to cut the handcuffs off her with surgical scissors.  Days after her \narrest she still has numbness in one of her hands from being handcuffed.  Additionally, her \nphotographic equipment was damaged by the Highway Patrol in the course of her arrest.   \n {CDB0003.4} \nCase 3:11-cv-01037   Document 18   Fil2e d 01/05/12   Page 2 of 24 PageID #: 77\n\n  5.  Plaintiff Lauren Marie Plummer, 24, is a citizen of the United States of America \nand resident of the State of Tennessee  and an early childhood educator who lives in Nashville. \nShe has participated as a member of Occupy Nashville since October 7, 2011.  She was arrested \non  both  October  28  and  29,  2011.    Ms.  Plummer  has  occupied  Legislative  Plaza  for \napproximately six (6) nights prior to her arrests.  Ms. Plummer participated in other acts of \npublic protest in the past, including protesting the lack of low income housing and the conditions \nat Nashvilleโs tent city.   \n  6.  Plaintiff Adam Kenneth Knight is a citizen of the United States of America and \nresident of the State of Tennessee.  Mr. Knight is an eighth grade teacher at a middle school in \nthe Nashville area.  He was arrested with other peacefully protesting citizens on the early \nmorning of October 28, 2011.  The night before his arrest one of Mr. Knightโs students attended \nthe Occupy Nashville protest with his father.  When it became clear that arrests would take place, \nthe father thanked Mr. Knight for teaching his son to stand up for what is right.   \n  7.  Plaintiff William W. Howell, 64, is a citizen of the United States of America and \nresident of the State of Tennessee.  Mr. Howell is a long time advocate for fair taxation at the \nState Legislature.  His involvement in public protests of the action of his elected representatives \ndates back to the Vietnam War.  After being warned by the State to leave Legislative Plaza on \nthe morning of October 28, 2011, Mr. Howell read the Declaration of Independence for all to \nhear. The Tennessee Highway Patrol waited for him to finish its reading; then, ignoring the \nimport of what had been read, arrested Mr. Howell along with 28 other peaceful protesters.   \n  8.  Plaintiff Darria Janรฉy Hudson is a citizen of the United States of America and \nresident  of  the  State  of  Tennessee  and  a  23-year-old  candidate  for  Masters  of  Divinity  at \nVanderbilt University, a part-time employee of Vanderbilt Sarratt Center, a licensed minister at \n {CDB0003.4} \nCase 3:11-cv-01037   Document 18   Fil3e d 01/05/12   Page 3 of 24 PageID #: 78\n\nthe Metropolitan interdenominational church and a former student minister at Fisk University. \nShe was arrested in the early morning hours of October 28, 2011.  Ms. Hudson has studied with \nJames  Morris  Lawson,  Jr.,  a  leading  theoretician  and  tactician  of  nonviolence  within  the \nAmerican Civil Rights Movement.  She believes that Occupy Nashville is a continuation of civil \ndisobedience seeking social justice dating back to the sit-ins in Nashville in 1960.   \n  9.  Plaintiffs  Hudson,  Howell,  Knight,  Plummer,  Shannon  and  Painter  are \ncollectively referred to herein as the โArrested Plaintiffs.โ   \n  10.  Plaintiff Katy Savage is a citizen of the United States of America and resident of \nthe State of Tennessee.  Ms. Savage has a B.A. in English and Philosophy and an M.A. in \nEnvironmental Humanities.  She attended the first Occupy Nashville rally on October 6, 2011, \nand began sleeping there October 12.  She has spent around 10 - 15 nights there.  She works with \nthe Facilitation Committee of Occupy Nashville to create a process for meetings that is fair and \ndemocratic, and according to the ideals of consensus. On the first night of arrests, she was \nintending to stay on the Plaza, but left when the State Troopers arrived and gave a ten-minute \nwarning.  She was not arrested at the Plaza either night but curtailed her speech and political \nactivities at the Plaza out of fear of being arrested by the State Troopers.   \n  11.  Plaintiff Savage is referred to herein as the โNon-Arrested Plaintiff.โ \n  12.  Defendant William Edward \"Bill\" Haslam (โHaslamโ) is the Governor of the \nState of Tennessee.  He is sued in his official capacity. \n  13.  Defendant Steven G. Cates (โCatesโ) is the Commissioner of the Department of \nGeneral Services for the State of Tennessee.  He is sued in his official and individual capacities.   \n {CDB0003.4} \nCase 3:11-cv-01037   Document 18   Fil4e d 01/05/12   Page 4 of 24 PageID #: 79\n\n  14.  Defendant  William  L.  Gibbons  (โGibbonsโ)  is  the  Commissioner  of  the \nDepartment of Safety for the State of Tennessee.  He is sued in his official and individual \ncapacities.   \n  15.  Defendant Tennessee Highway Patrol Officer Does 1-100 (โOfficer Does 100โ) \nare officers with the Tennessee Highway Patrol.  The names of Officer Does 1-100 are not \nknown at this time; however, they are sued in their official and individual capacities.  Officer \nDoes 1-100 arrested the Arrested Plaintiffs on October 28, 2011, without probable cause or \nreasonable suspicion that a crime had been committed.   \n  16.  Defendant Tennessee Highway Patrol Officer Does 101-110 (โOfficer Does 101-\n110โ) are officers with the Tennessee Highway Patrol.  The names of Officer Does 101-110 are \nnot known at this time; however, they are sued in their official and individual capacities.  Officer \nDoes 101-110 detained the Arrested Plaintiffs on October 28, 2011, for several hours without \nprobable cause or reasonable suspicion that a crime had been committed even after the Davidson \nCounty Magistrate had ordered the Arrested Plaintiffs released.   \n  17.  Defendant Tennessee Highway Patrol Officer Does 111-210 (โOfficer Does 111-\n210โ) are officers with the Tennessee Highway Patrol.  The names of Officer Does 111-210 are \nnot known at this time, however they are sued in their official and individual capacities.  Officer \nDoes 111-210 arrested the Arrested Plaintiffs on October 29, 2011, without probable cause or \nreasonable suspicion that a crime had been committed.   \n  18.  Defendants, at all relevant times and as to all relevant actions described herein, \nwere acting under the color of state law. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n  19.  This suit is for injunctive relief, declaratory relief, nominal and actual damages.  \nThe causes of action for injunctive relief, nominal and actual damages are provided by 42 U.S.C. \n {CDB0003.4} \nCase 3:11-cv-01037   Document 18   Fil5e d 01/05/12   Page 5 of 24 PageID #: 80\n\nยง 1983, which permits actions at law and suits in equity against any person, who under color of a \nstate law, causes injury to another in violation of the Constitution of the United States.  The \ncause of action for declaratory relief arises under 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201, which permits a court to \ndeclare the rights of any interested party in a case of actual controversy. \n  20.  This suit presents questions that arise under the Constitution of the United States.  \nAccordingly, jurisdiction is provided by 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331, 1343(a)(3), and 2201. \n  21.  Venue is proper in the Court under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391, as Defendants may be \nfound in this district. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n  22.  The individual Plaintiffs bring this action individually and as a class action for \ndamages pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, on behalf of all holders of individuals \narrested on October 28 and 29, 2011, at Legislative Plaza pursuant to the New Rules.  \n  23.  This action is properly maintainable as a class action. \n  24.  The Class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  At least 49 \nindividuals were arrested on the nights in question.   \n  25.  Questions of law and fact exist that are common to the Class, including, among \nothers: \n(a)  The arrests were in violation of the United States Constitution; \n(b)  whether the Defendants were acting under the color of state law; \n(c)  whether the defense of qualified immunity is available to the Defendants; and  \n(d)  whether Plaintiffs were damaged by the conduct of the Defendants. \n {CDB0003.4} \nCase 3:11-cv-01037   Document 18   Fil6e d 01/05/12   Page 6 of 24 PageID #: 81\n\n  26.  Plaintiffs are committed to prosecuting this action and have retained competent \ncounsel experienced in litigation of this nature.  Accordingly, individual Plaintiffs are adequate \nrepresentatives of the Class and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. \n  27.  Individual Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of the other members of the \nClass and individual Plaintiffs have the same interests as the other members of the Class. \n  28.  The prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the Class would \ncreate the risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the \nClass, which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for Defendants, or adjudications \nwith  respect  to  individual  members  of  the  Class  which  would,  as  a  practical  matter,  be \ndispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the adjudications or substantially \nimpair or impede their ability to protect their interests. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nTHE PROTEST \n  29.  Occupy Nashville is an outgrowth of the โOccupy Wall Streetโ movement that \nbegan approximately one and a half months ago.  The Occupy Nashville movement seeks to \nbring attention to the imbalance in our financial system and to ensure that politicians are as \nconcerned about and responsive to citizens of our country without means or with moderate \nmeans as they are to corporations and those who benefit the most from the current imbalance. \n  30.  Legislative Plaza (โPlazaโ) is located between Union Street and Charlotte Pike, \nfacing 6th Avenue North in front of War Memorial Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee, directly \nacross the street from the Statehouse. The location of the Plaza makes it an appropriate and \neffective public forum at which Occupy Nashville can convey its message, meet in a peaceable \nmanner for their common good, instruct their representatives and apply to those invested with the \npowers of government for redress of their grievances.   \n {CDB0003.4} \nCase 3:11-cv-01037   Document 18   Fil7e d 01/05/12   Page 7 of 24 PageID #: 82\n\n  31.  The Plaza was first know as War Memorial Square. \n \nIt was completed in 1925. The building was recognized with a Gold Medal Award by the \nAmerican Institute of Architecture (AIA) in 1925, the highest honor that the AIA can bestow. \n  32.  The design of the Plaza has changed much since 1925 to accommodate larger \ncrowds and more frequent public events.   \n \n  33.  The Plaza is large open pedestrian space.  The War Memorial Amphitheatre is \nentered by steps leading off of the Plaza.  These steps are used as part of many public gatherings.    \n {CDB0003.4} \nCase 3:11-cv-01037   Document 18   Fil8e d 01/05/12   Page 8 of 24 PageID #: 83\n\n  34.  For  many  years,  the  Plaza  has  been  used  for  political,  social  and  labor \ndemonstrations. Often it is used for the overflow of demonstrations directly in front of the State \nCapitol. It is also used by demonstrators who simply wish to be visible across the street from the \nState Capitol rather than directly on its doorstep.  It is routinely used for the inauguration of the \nGovernor.  \n  35.  On April 26, 2008, a local group held a demonstration on the Plaza. Prior to their \ndemonstration, this group was informed by the State that there was no permit requirement, and \nno rules or regulations governing the use of the Plaza.   Specifically on March 4, 2008, the State \ninformed them, โany person or organization is free to engage in any activity protected by the \nConstitution on the War Memorial Plaza without having to provide the State of Tennessee \nadvance notice, obtain liability insurance or pay event and security fees.โ  (See, Exhibit 1, \nโMarch 4, 2008, Letterโ ) \n  36.  Occupy Nashville began its speech activities at the plaza on October 9, 2011.  The \ngroups in the โOccupyโ movement typically encompass a continuous presence at a location. \nOccupy Nashville participants are not normally sleeping at the Plaza but, rather, maintain a \ncontinuous around-the-clock presence by rotating participants.  At any one time, there have been \nas few as two (2) participants or as many as three hundred (300) participants.  Occupy Nashville \nparticipants have mainly located themselves and their property right near the northwest corner of \nthe Plaza, on a seating section of the stepped-seating, or at a section of one of the ledges.  \nParticipants positioned themselves and their property so as not to obstruct other pedestriansโ \nusage of or passage through the Plaza.   \n  37.  Some Occupy Nashville participants brought with them coolers of food, drinks or \nmedical supplies for use if needed during their speech activities.  They also brought political \n {CDB0003.4} \nCase 3:11-cv-01037   Document 18   Fil9e d 01/05/12   Page 9 of 24 PageID #: 84\n\nsigns.  Some had small tents.  They brought tarps to cover items when it began raining.  A few \nbrought small collapsible chairs to sit in or small single-person tables upon which to place their \ncomputer to engage in real-time live chat from the โoccupationโ site.  Again, given the size of \nthe Plaza and of the pedestrian walkways, none of the activities engaged in by Occupy Nashville, \neven at their peak of participation, obstructed the use of the Plaza by other persons.   \n  38.  Recently, the Southern Festival of Books and Occupy Nashville used the Plaza at \nthe same time without incident or complication.  \n New Rules Are Promulgated by Fiat of the Commissioner  \n  39.  Pursuant  to  the  act  of  the  General  Assembly,  the  Tennessee  Department  of \nGeneral Services is authorized and obligated by statute to make rules for the use of the Plaza.  \nTenn. Code Ann. ยงยง  4-3-1105, 4-4-103; 4-8-101, 103 & 104, 4-3-1103 &1105 and 4-3-2206. \n  40.  Prior  to  Occupy  Nashvilleโs  protest  commencing  at  Legislative  Plaza,  the \nDepartment of General Services had adopted a set of limitations on the Plazaโs use.  (Exhibit 2) \n(the โOld Rulesโ).  It is unknown when or how these Old Rules were adopted; however, it is \nclear that they placed no limitation on the hours of use and had been interpreted by the State to \nallow non-exclusive use of the Plaza without seeking a permit.  (March 8, 2008, Letter) \n  41.  On  October  27,  2011,  the  Old  Rules  were  amended  by  fiat  without  notice, \ncomment or approval by the Attorney General and Reporter or publication by the Secretary of \nState.  (the New Rules, Exhibit 3).  These New Rules, which purport to be of immediate \napplicability, were posted on the Plaza in the afternoon of October 27, 2011.  These new rules \nwere then enforced on October 28, 2011.  No emergency requiring the promulgation of new rules \nexisted.   \n {CDB0003.4} \nCase 3:11-cv-01037   Document 18   Fil1e0d  01/05/12   Page 10 of 24 PageID #: 85\n\n  42.  These  New  Rules  unconstitutionally  limit  access  by  the  public  to  a  forum \nuniversally accepted to be an area protected for the speech of the governed.   \nFirst Night of Arrests  \n  43.  Despite receiving notification of the New Rules, Occupy Nashville protesters, \nrelying on historic policy of the Plaza, continued their occupation of the Plaza.  \n  44.  On Friday, October 28, 2011, at approximately 3:00 a.m., the Occupy Nashville \nprotesters were told by the Tennessee Highway Patrol that they had ten (10) minutes to leave the \nPlaza. While some protesters left the Plaza, many did not leave and instead sat in the middle of \nthe Plaza, peacefully singing and listening to a recitation of the Declaration of Independence.  \n  45.  Just as the warning time had run out, approximately 75 THP officers converged \non  the Plaza. The State Troopers arrested the remaining protesters, bound their hands with \"zip \nties,\" and loaded them onto a waiting prison bus, which took them to jail. \n \n {CDB0003.4} \nCase 3:11-cv-01037   Document 18   Fil1e1d  01/05/12   Page 11 of 24 PageID #: 86\n\n  46.  All of the Arrested Plaintiffsโ seized items were placed into a truck and were \ndriven away.  Upon information and belief, the property was placed into the possession of the \nState Police. \n  47.  The  Non-Arrested  Plaintiff  fled  the  Plaza  under  the  threat  of  arrest,  stopped \nengaging in the political speech in which they had been engaged in which they intended to \ncontinue.  The continued enforcement of the New Rules will materially limit their ability to seek \nredress from their government, express their political views and peacefully assemble.  The Non-\nArrested  Plaintiff  intends  to  continue  to  seek  redress  from  their  government,  express  their \npolitical views and peacefully assemble at the Plaza. \nCriminal Proceedings \n  48.  Upon arrival at the Davidson County Sheriff's Criminal Justice Center, Officers \nDoes 1-100 sought to have their actions ratified by a Judicial Commissioner as required by state \nlaw.  The Commissioner denied the request, refusing to find probable cause and effectively \nordering the protestersโ release.   \n  49.  Despite  this  ruling,  however,  Defendant  Officers  Does  101-110  continued  to \ndetain Plaintiffs until approximately 8:45 a.m., approximately five (5) hours after Commissioner \nNelsonโs Order finding no probable cause and ordering their release.  The Arrested Plaintiffsโ \nrelease  occurred  only  after  Defendant  Officers  Does  101-110  issued  citations  to  appear  in \nGeneral Sessions Court to address the same charges for which the Judicial Commissioner had \njust refused to issue an arrest warrant.   \n  50.  These illegal citations were dismissed and expunged by the General Sessions \nCourt on Monday, November 14, 2011. \n {CDB0003.4} \nCase 3:11-cv-01037   Document 18   Fil1e2d  01/05/12   Page 12 of 24 PageID #: 87\n\nSeizure of Their Property \n  51.  Plaintiffsโ counsel was informed by Defendantsโ counsel (General Counsel of the \nDepartment of General Services) that Arrested Plaintiffs would need to obtain their own truck to \ncarry items seized by THP and that these items were stored in a dry garbage bin in the Plaza \ngarage. \n  52.  Plaintiffsโ counsel has been advised by an official in charge of the Plaza that some \nof the property has been destroyed. \nSecond Night of Arrests \n  53.  On Friday, October 28, 2011, the Arrested Plaintiffs were again threatened with \narrest, even though the Defendants knew that the arrests were illegal.  At least one (1) Tennessee \nState Trooper suggested that the Defendants consult with the Tennessee Attorney General and \nReporter prior to the second night of arrests.   \n  54.   Plaintiff Malina Chavez Shannon was not part of the protest, but was taking \nphotographs on the sidewalk.  She was arrested while on the sidewalk abutting 6th Avenue. \n  55.  In an overwhelming show of force, on October 28, 2011, shortly before midnight, \nmore than two dozen peacefully assembled Occupy Nashville protestors were arrested by 72 \nTennessee Highway Patrol Officers, including the Arrested Plaintiffs identified above.  The \narrestees also included a reporter with the Nashville Scene, Jonathan Meador, who was covering \nthe event.  \n  56.  Again the Non-Arrested Plaintiff fled the Plaza under the threat of arrest, stopped \nengaging in the political speech in which she had been engaged in which she intended to \ncontinue.  The continued enforcement of the New Rules will materially limit her ability to seek \nredress from her government, express her political views and peacefully assemble.  The Non-\n {CDB0003.4} \nCase 3:11-cv-01037   Document 18   Fil1e3d  01/05/12   Page 13 of 24 PageID #: 88\n\nArrested Plaintiff intends to continue to seek redress from her government, express her political \nviews and peacefully assemble at the Plaza. \n \nIllegal Surveillance  \n  57.  The Defendants conspired to infiltrate, observe, record, and disseminate false \ninformation gathered on lawful speech activities the Plaintiffs. \n  58.  Specifically,  the  Defendants  attempted  to  access  the  chat  room  of  Occupy \nNashville utilizing a false username and password, used undercover Troopers to observe and \nmonitor the activities of the Plaintiffs, and stated falsely that Occupy Nashville and its members \nwere engaged in illegal and unsafe conduct.   \n  59.  Defendants had no reasonable suspicion that criminal conduct was ongoing at \nLegislative Plaza when they infiltrated, observed and recorded Occupy Nashville, and then made \nfalse statements about the conduct of the Plaintiffs.   \n {CDB0003.4} \nCase 3:11-cv-01037   Document 18   Fil1e4d  01/05/12   Page 14 of 24 PageID #: 89\n\nFuture Plans \n  60.  Plaintiffs (both Arrested and Non-Arrested) continue to use the Plaza for their free \nspeech activities, albeit they have been hindered (including in the conveyance of their message) \nby the restrictions placed upon them.  Plaintiffs intend to continue to engage in free speech \nactivities at the Plaza (and to generally enjoy the use of the Plaza) now and in the future for an \nindefinite period of time.  They wish to do so without being subjected to the invalid, unlawful \nprohibitions and restrictions imposed upon them by Defendants Haslam, Cates and Gibbons. \nReckless and/or Callous Indifference to Plaintiffsโ   \nFederally Protected First Amendment Rights  \n \n  61.  In  enacting  the  New  Rules,  retaliating  against,  infiltrating,  detaining  without \nprobable cause and generally harassing the Plaintiffs, Defendants acted with a with reckless \nand/or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of the Plaintiffs. \n  62.  Specifically, the Defendants: \n  a)  enacted the New Rules directed specifically at the speech of the Plaintiffs; \n  b)  enacted the New Rules that ignored all legal precedent on the First Amendment \nwithout public hearing or comment; \n  c)  enacted  the  New  Rules  without  consolation  with  the  Attorney  General  and \nReporter;  \n  d)  deceived the Plaintiffs about their intent to enforce the regulations; \n  e)  infiltrated, observed and monitored the Plaintiffs, even though the Defendants had \nno reasonable suspicion that a crime had been committed.   \n  f)  knew or should have (and easily could have) known that the New Rules exceeded \ntheir ability to regulate speech at the Plaza. \n {CDB0003.4} \nCase 3:11-cv-01037   Document 18   Fil1e5d  01/05/12   Page 15 of 24 PageID #: 90\n\nCOUNT I \nVIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS TO FREE SPEECH & ASSEMBLY  \n(42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) NEW POLICY IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL ON ITS FACE \n \n  63.  Plaintiffs re-allege and re-aver all of the allegations contained in the previous \nparagraphs. \n  64.  Plaintiffsโ past and proposed activity constitutes political speech and association \nin a public forum and, therefore, is expressive activity entitled to the highest degree of protection \nunder the First Amendment.  \n  65.  The Stateโs New Rules violate Occupy Nashvilleโs and the individual Plaintiffsโ \nFirst Amendment rights in the following ways: \na.  They constitute an impermissible prior restraint on Occupy Nashvilleโs speech. \nb.  They constitute a content-based regulation of Occupy Nashvilleโs speech. \nc.  They  embody  the  exercise  of  excessive  and  unfettered  arbitrary  discretion, \n  ungoverned by objective standards, by the officers, employees or agents of the \n  state who are charged with reviewing Occupy Nashvilleโs request to hold its \n  march.  \nd.  They  constitute  an  arbitrary  and  standard-less  tax  or  financial  burden  on \n  plaintiffsโ  speech,  and  impose  arbitrary  requirements  on  Occupy  Nashvilleโs \n  attempt to exercise its expressive rights.  \ne.  They are unconstitutionally vague.  \nf.  They are unconstitutionally overbroad. \ng.  They  discriminate  against  Occupy  Nashville  in  that  they  chill  or  eviscerate \n  Occupy Nashvilleโs First Amendment rights on the basis of its financial status \n  and its inability to pay the fees imposed by the state on expressive activity in \n  public forums.  \n  66.  As  a  proximate  result  of  the  Defendantsโ  actions,  the  Plaintiffs  have  been \ndeprived of their rights under the First Amendment and have suffered immediate and irreparable \nharm.  \n  67.
