    "summary": "<p>This case arose out of the Minnesota Department of Human Services&rsquo; alleged failure to transfer civilly committed inmates to a state-operated treatment facility within the timeframe prescribed by state law. On January 23, 2024, a person who was civilly committed while in state custody filed this lawsuit in Minnesota&rsquo;s Fourth Judicial District (Hennepin County). The case was ultimately removed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. The plaintiff sued the Minnesota Department of Human Services and its Commissioner under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, the Minnesota Constitution, and state tort law. Represented by the private counsel, the plaintiff sought class certification, a writ of mandamus, declaratory relief, injunctive relief, damages, and attorney&rsquo;s fees. The case was assigned to District Judge G Eric C. Tostrud and Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Cowan Wright.</p>\r\n<p>After the case was removed to federal court, a second plaintiff joined and filed an amended complaint on March 7, 2023. In their amended complaint, the plaintiffs noted that Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.10, subdiv. 1(b) provided certain procedural requirements when a person was civilly committed. Specifically, the statute requires that &ldquo;[p]atients [who qualify under the statute] must be admitted to a state-operated treatment program within 48 hours.&rdquo; Despite this 48-hour requirement, the complaint alleged that there were more than 60 inmates who had &ldquo;waited weeks or months&rdquo; before being transferred to a state-run treatment facility.</p>\r\n<p>The original plaintiff, a Minnesota resident, was initially incarcerated at the Ramsey County Adult Detention Center. In October 2022, the plaintiff was civilly committed as a person who posed a risk of harm due to his mental illness and chemical dependence. But the plaintiff was not transferred to a state-run facility within 48 hours of his civil commitment; instead, he remained at the Hennepin County Jail until December 2022. During that time, the plaintiff was denied his mental health medications and kept in a suicide unit where he was rarely let out of his cell.</p>\r\n<p>The amended complaint alleged eight counts against the defendants, who were required to comply with Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.10. First, the defendants deprived the plaintiffs of their substantive due process rights under the U.S. Constitution by failing to transfer them to a state-operated treatment facility. Second, the defendants violated the plaintiffs&rsquo; procedural due process rights by failing to provide the plaintiffs with notice or an opportunity to be heard. Third, the defendants violated the plaintiffs&rsquo; due process rights in the Minnesota Constitution. Fifth, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants are liable for negligence, false imprisonment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought class certification on behalf of (1) all persons who were detained in any jail or prison for more than 48 hours but were since admitted to a state-run treatment facility; and (2) all persons who were still detained in any jail or prison for more than 48 hours after having been ordered civilly committed. The complaint also sought a writ of mandamus that &ldquo;compels Defendants to comply with the law and awards [the plaintiffs and proposed class members] any damages resulting from Defendants&rsquo; failure to do so.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>On April 10, 2023, the defendants filed their motion to dismiss. Before the court ruled on the motion, the plaintiffs voluntarily withdrew their motion for class certification. On August 16, 2023, a related case concerning the 48-hour rule was re-assigned to Judge Tostrud. <em>See</em> <em>Dalen v. Harpstead</em>, No. 34-cv-1877.</p>\r\n<p>On August 16, 2023, Judge Tostrud partially granted and partially denied the defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss. <em>See</em> 2023 WL 598425. Specifically, the court denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; substantive due process claim, as the plaintiff did not show that the 48-hour rule was &ldquo;deeply rooted in this Nation&rsquo;s history and tradition,&rdquo; and the alleged conduct was not &ldquo;conscience-shocking.&rdquo; In its opinion, the court noted that the state tort law claims were &ldquo;legally implausible.&rdquo; &nbsp;The court further added that the plaintiffs could not seek damages against the Commissioner, as the complaint did not explain the Commissioner&rsquo;s individual involvement in the deprivation of the plaintiffs&rsquo; constitutional rights. However, the court concluded that the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged a procedural due process claim, although it was &ldquo;difficult to envision what available equitable relief or remedies might redress Plaintiffs&rsquo; procedural injuries.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>After the defendants filed their answer to the complaint, one of the two plaintiffs stipulated to dismiss their claims without prejudice. The parties proceeded to file motions related to discovery. In January 2024, the court issued an order in <em>Dalen v. Harpstead</em>, the related case concerning the 48-hour rule. There, the court dismissed all of the plaintiff&rsquo;s federal claims against the Commissioner and denied the plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for a preliminary injunction. <em>See</em> 2024 WL 169109. The court directed the parties in this case to meet and confer about how the order in <em>Dalen</em> affected the parties&rsquo; positions. The parties submitted an update to the court via e-mail. The case is ongoing.</p>",

    "summary_short": "This case arose out of the Minnesota Department of Human Services’ alleged failure to transfer civilly committed inmates to a state-operated treatment facility within the 48-hour timeframe prescribed by state law. The plaintiff sued the Minnesota Department of Human Services and its Commissioner under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Minnesota Constitution, and state tort law. The plaintiff sought class certification, a writ of mandamus, declaratory relief, injunctive relief, damages, and attorney’s fees. On the defendants' motion, the court dismissed a majority of the plaintiff's claims, but permitted the plaintiff's procedural due process claim for equitable relief to proceed. The case is ongoing.",

      "text": "27-CV-23-960\nFiled in District Court\nState of Minnesota\n1/23/2023 9:40 AM\nSTATE OF MINNESOTA  DISTRICT COURT \nCOUNTY OF HENNEPIN  FOURTH JUDICIAL DISTRICT \n  Case Type: Other Civil \nO’Shea Chairse, on behalf of himself    Civil File No. ____________________ \nand all others similarly situated, \n  \nPlaintiff, \nvs. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \nState of Minnesota Department of \nJURY TRIAL DEMANDED \nHuman Services and Minnesota \nCommissioner of Human Services Jodi   \nHarpstead, in her official and \nindividual capacities, \nDefendants. \n \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  This suit challenges the failure of the State of Minnesota Department \nof Human Services (“DHS”) to comply with Minn. Stat. § 253B.10, subd. \n1(b), which requires DHS to transfer civilly committed inmates to a \nstate-operated treatment facility within 48 hours of their civil \ncommitment.  \n2.  There are more than 60 inmates who have been waiting weeks or even \nmonths to be transferred to a state-run treatment facility following \ntheir civil commitment. Additional individuals were previously harmed \nand/or will be harmed in the future by DHS’s failure to transfer them to \na state-operated treatment facility within 48 hours of their civil \ncommitment. \n3.  A 2016 report from the Office of the Legislative Auditor warned about \nviolations of Minn. Stat. § 253B.10. The report found the availability of \n“secure inpatient beds” was “inadequate” to meet demand in 2016. \n\n27-CV-23-960\nFiled in District Court\nState of Minnesota\n1/23/2023 9:40 AM\n4.  The same report stated that “delays in placing individuals into \ntreatment . . . may have increased county jails’ risks, potentially \naffecting the health or safety of the patient, fellow jail inmates, and jail \nstaff.” \n5.  In September 2022, Scott County Judge Christopher Wilton said, \nreferring to Minn. Stat. § 253B.10, “I’ve never seen a statute where \nthere’s just overt failure to comply, and it’s not even close.” \n6.  In an October 26, 2022 order, Scott County Judge Colleen King \nconcluded that the “law requires that within 48-hours of commitment, \nthe committed person must be placed by the Commissioner of Human \nServices in a state-operated treatment facility.”  \n7.  Judge King stated: “The Commissioner of Human Services has violated \nthe 48-hour rule in Scott County cases since at least the spring of 2021 . \n. . . Since that time, at least 4 individuals have been committed in Scott \nCounty under circumstances where the 48-hour rule would apply, and \nin each of those cases, the committed person was not transferred out of \nthe jail for treatment within, or even close to, 48-hours.” \n8.  Judge King stated: “The Scott County Jail is not a treatment facility.” \n9.  Judge King stated: “Petitioner has been denied necessary care for his \nmental illness while in the jail. The petitioner has thus been denied due \nprocess under the United States and Minnesota Constitutions.” \n10. Judge King stated: “The Commissioner of Human Services has failed to \ncomply with a duty imposed by law necessitating judicial intervention \nand oversight. The 48-hour rule found in M.S.A. §253B.10, subd. 1 \ncreates a clear and unequivocal legal duty for the Commissioner to \nplace the Petitioner in a state-operated treatment program within 48-\n2 \n \n\n27-CV-23-960\nFiled in District Court\nState of Minnesota\n1/23/2023 9:40 AM\nhours of his commitment . . . . There is no exception [to] that 48-hour \nrule under Minnesota law.” \n11. Judge King stated: “The Commissioner has been aware that compliance \nwith the 48-hour rule is required and has had ample time to comply \ngiven that this issue was identified in 2016 in a report from the Office \nof the Legislative Auditor.” \n12. In November 2022, Scott County Judge Colleen King said, “There are \ncountless . . . individuals who are languishing in jails because the issue \nhas not been addressed. Wrongful incarceration is not the United \nStates of America.” \n13. The situation in Scott County described by Judge King is not unique to \nScott County, but reflects a pattern occurring throughout the State of \nMinnesota.  \n14. In a December 21, 2022 order, Scott County Judge Christian Wilton \ncommanded Minnesota Commissioner of Human Services Jodi \nHarpstead “to provide the Court with 30-day reports concerning all \ncases in the State of Minnesota to which the 48-hour rule applies, \nidentifying the originating County and the time and date that the 48-\nhour period would have expired for each patient.” \n15. DHS appealed Judge Wilton’s December 21, 2022 order, arguing that \nJudge Wilton does not have the authority to require Commissioner Jodi \nHarpstead to submit monthly reports about her efforts to comply with \nMinn. Stat. § 253B.10. \n16. On behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated persons, Plaintiff \nO’Shea Chairse files this action for injunctive and/or monetary relief \nunder 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, and under the common law of the \nState of Minnesota. \n3 \n \n\n27-CV-23-960\nFiled in District Court\nState of Minnesota\n1/23/2023 9:40 AM\nPARTIES \n17. Plaintiff O’Shea Chairse (“Plaintiff”) is a resident of Minnesota. \n18. Defendant DHS is an agency of the State of Minnesota that has failed \nand continues to fail to comply with Minn. Stat. § 253B.10.   \n19. Defendant Jodi Harpstead is a resident of Minnesota. Harpstead serves \nas the Minnesota Commissioner of Human Services, and was at all \ntimes material herein responsible for DHS’s compliance with \nMinnesota law, including Minn. Stat. § 253B.10. Plaintiff is suing \nHarpstead in her official and individual capacities. \nJURISDICTION \n20. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Minn. Stat. § \n484.01 et seq. Venue lies properly in Hennepin County, Minnesota \npursuant to Minn. Stat. § 542.01 et seq., as the events giving rise to \nthis action occurred in Hennepin County. \nBACKGROUND \n21. On October 17, 2022, Plaintiff was civilly committed as a person who \nposed a risk of harm due to a mental illness and a chemically \ndependent person to the Commissioner of Human Services. \n22. However, the Commissioner of Human Services did not transfer \nPlaintiff to a state-run facility within 48 hours of his civil commitment \non October 17, 2022. \n23. Instead, he remained in the Hennepin County Jail until December 5, \n2022 when his caseworker was able to have him admitted into New \nWay Treatment Center.  During his time in Hennepin County Jail, he \nwas denied his mental health medications and was kept in a suicide \nunit where he was only allowed out of his cell for short periods to \nshower or use the telephone. \n4 \n \n\n27-CV-23-960\nFiled in District Court\nState of Minnesota\n1/23/2023 9:40 AM\n24. Plaintiff and others similarly situated suffered unlawful incarceration, \nlack of access to mental health therapy and treatment, use of force, \ndiminished quality and enjoyment of life, and psychological trauma and \ndistress. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n25. Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of himself and all others similarly \nsituated, pursuant to Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure 23. \n26. Plaintiff seeks to represent a class defined as: all past, current, and \nfuture civilly committed inmates in Minnesota who DHS failed to \ntransfer to a state-operated treatment facility within 48 hours of their \ncivil commitment under Minn. Stat. § 253B.10. \n27. The proposed class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable. \n28. There are questions of law and fact common to members of the plaintiff \nclass. These questions include, but are not limited to, the following: \n  Whether Minn. Stat. § 253B.10 (“Patients described in this \nparagraph must be admitted to a state-operated treatment \nprogram within 48 hours.”) requires DHS to transfer a civilly \ncommitted inmate within 48 hours of their civil commitment; \n  Whether Minn. Stat. § 253B.10 creates a liberty interest for \npeople who are incarcerated in Minnesota; and \n  Whether Defendants’ policy, practice, or custom of routinely not \ntransferring civilly committed inmates to a state-operated \ntreatment program within 48 hours of their civil commitment \nviolates due process under the United States Constitution. \n29. The claims of the representative party, the named plaintiff O’Shea \nChairse, are typical of the claims of the members of the class. \n5 \n \n\n27-CV-23-960\nFiled in District Court\nState of Minnesota\n1/23/2023 9:40 AM\n30. The representative party, the named plaintiff O’Shea Chairse, will \nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \n31. Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally \napplicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive \nand/or monetary relief with respect to the class as a whole.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT 1 \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 – Fourteenth Amendment Substantive Due Process \nViolations Against Both Defendants \n \n32. Plaintiff and class members restate the allegations contained in the \nprevious paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  \n33. Based on the above factual allegations, Defendants, through their \nactions, acting under the color of state law, violated Plaintiff’s and class \nmembers’ constitutional right to substantive due process under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by failing to \ntransfer Plaintiff and class members to a state-operated treatment \nfacility within 48 hours of their civil commitment. See, e.g., Hall v. \nLombardi, 996 F.2d 954, 958 (8th Cir. 1993) (“There are many Supreme \nCourt and Eighth Circuit cases that support the ‘general, well-\ndeveloped legal principle’ that regulations which contain ‘particularized \nsubstantive standards or criteria that guide the exercise of discretion . . \n. create a protectible liberty interest.  . . .  Moreover, when these \nregulations contain language of a mandatory nature (shall, will, must), \nthey are interpreted as creating a protectible liberty interest.”). \n34. As a result of this due process violation, Plaintiff and class members \nsuffered damages. \n \n \n \n6 \n \n\n27-CV-23-960\nFiled in District Court\nState of Minnesota\n1/23/2023 9:40 AM\nCOUNT 2 \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 – Fourteenth Amendment Procedural Due Process \nViolations Against Both Defendants \n \n35. Plaintiff restates the allegations contained in the previous paragraphs \nas if fully set forth herein. \n36. Based on the above factual allegations, Defendants, through their \nactions, acting under the color of state law, violated Plaintiff’s and class \nmembers’ constitutional right to procedural due process under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by failing to \nprovide notice or an opportunity to be heard regarding their decision \nnot to transfer Plaintiff and class members to a state-operated \ntreatment facility within 48 hours of their civil commitment. \n37. As a result of this due process violation, Plaintiff and class members \nsuffered damages. \nCOUNT 3 \nNegligence and Negligence Per Se Against Both Defendants \n \n38. Plaintiff and class members restate the allegations contained in the \nprevious paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n39. Based on the above factual allegations, Defendants owed Plaintiff and \nclass members a duty of care to follow Minnesota state law.  \n40. Defendants breached this duty of care by failing to transfer Plaintiff \nand class members to state-operated treatment facilities within 48 \nhours of their civil commitment. \n41. DHS is vicariously liable to Plaintiff and class members for the \nnegligence of its employees, including but not limited to Defendant \nHarpstead.  \n42. As a direct and proximate result of this negligence, Plaintiff and class \nmembers suffered damages. \n7 \n \n\n27-CV-23-960\nFiled in District Court\nState of Minnesota\n1/23/2023 9:40 AM\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiff requests that the Court: \n1.  Certify this matter as a class action under Minnesota Rules of Civil \nProcedure Rule 23.03; \n2.  Define the certified class as “all past, current, and future civilly \ncommitted inmates in Minnesota who DHS failed to transfer to a state-\noperated treatment facility within 48 hours of their civil commitment.” \n3.  Issue a judgment declaring that Defendants violated and continue to \nviolate the right to due process enshrined in the Minnesota and United \nStates Constitutions when they fail to transfer civilly committed \ninmates to state-operated treatment facilities withing 48 hours of their \ncivil commitment. \n4.  Appoint Zorislav Leyderman and Tim Phillips as class counsel \npursuant to Minnesota Rule of Civil Procedure 23.07; \n5.  Schedule a jury trial on the claims of Plaintiff and class members; \n6.  Award injunctive relief and/or damages compensating Plaintiff and \nclass members for the harm they have suffered against each Defendant, \njointly and severally, in an amount greater than $50,000; \n7.  Award punitive damages against Defendant Jodi Harpstead pursuant \nto Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30 (1983); \n8.  Award prejudgment interest; \n9.  Award reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § \n1988; and \n10. Provide any additional relief the Court deems just and proper. \nJURY DEMAND \nPlaintiff and class members request a jury trial for all matters so \ntriable by a jury. \n \n8 \n \n\n27-CV-23-960\nFiled in District Court\nState of Minnesota\n1/23/2023 9:40 AM\n  THE LAW OFFICE OF ZORISLAV R.

This suit challenges the failure of the State of Minnesota Department \nof Human Services (“DHS”) to comply with Minn. Stat. § 253B.10, subd. \n1(b), which requires DHS to transfer civilly committed inmates to a \nstate-operated treatment facility within 48 hours of their civil \ncommitment.  \n2.  There are more than 60 inmates who have been waiting weeks or even \nmonths to be transferred to a state-run treatment facility following \ntheir civil commitment. Additional individuals were previously harmed \nand/or will be harmed in the future by DHS’s failure to transfer them to \na state-operated treatment facility within 48 hours of their civil \ncommitment. \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 12   Filed 03/07/23   Page 2 of 16\n3.  A 2016 report from the Office of the Legislative Auditor warned about \nviolations of Minn. Stat. § 253B.10. The report found the availability of \n“secure inpatient beds” was “inadequate” to meet demand in 2016. \n4.  The same report stated that “delays in placing individuals into \ntreatment . . . may have increased county jails’ risks, potentially \naffecting the health or safety of the patient, fellow jail inmates, and jail \nstaff.” \n5.  In September 2022, Scott County Judge Christopher Wilton said, \nreferring to Minn. Stat. § 253B.10, “I’ve never seen a statute where \nthere’s just overt failure to comply, and it’s not even close.” \n6.  In an October 26, 2022 order, Scott County Judge Colleen King \nconcluded that the “law requires that within 48-hours of commitment, \nthe committed person must be placed by the Commissioner of Human \nServices in a state-operated treatment facility.”  \n7.  Judge King stated: “The Commissioner of Human Services has violated \nthe 48-hour rule in Scott County cases since at least the spring of 2021 . \n. . . Since that time, at least 4 individuals have been committed in Scott \nCounty under circumstances where the 48-hour rule would apply, and \nin each of those cases, the committed person was not transferred out of \nthe jail for treatment within, or even close to, 48-hours.” \n8.  Judge King stated: “The Scott County Jail is not a treatment facility.” \n9.  Judge King stated: “Petitioner has been denied necessary care for his \nmental illness while in the jail. The petitioner has thus been denied due \nprocess under the United States and Minnesota Constitutions.” \n10. Judge King stated: “The Commissioner of Human Services has failed to \ncomply with a duty imposed by law necessitating judicial intervention \nand oversight. The 48-hour rule found in M.S.A. §253B.10, subd. 1 \n2 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 12   Filed 03/07/23   Page 3 of 16\ncreates a clear and unequivocal legal duty for the Commissioner to \nplace the Petitioner in a state-operated treatment program within 48-\nhours of his commitment . . . . There is no exception [to] that 48-hour \nrule under Minnesota law.” \n11. Judge King stated: “The Commissioner has been aware that compliance \nwith the 48-hour rule is required and has had ample time to comply \ngiven that this issue was identified in 2016 in a report from the Office \nof the Legislative Auditor.” \n12. In November 2022, Scott County Judge Colleen King said, “There are \ncountless . . . individuals who are languishing in jails because the issue \nhas not been addressed. Wrongful incarceration is not the United \nStates of America.” \n13. The situation in Scott County described by Judge King is not unique to \nScott County, but reflects a pattern occurring throughout the State of \nMinnesota.  \n14. In a December 21, 2022 order, Scott County Judge Christian Wilton \ncommanded Minnesota Commissioner of Human Services Jodi \nHarpstead “to provide the Court with 30-day reports concerning all \ncases in the State of Minnesota to which the 48-hour rule applies, \nidentifying the originating County and the time and date that the 48-\nhour period would have expired for each patient.” \n15. DHS appealed Judge Wilton’s December 21, 2022 order, arguing that \nJudge Wilton does not have the authority to require Commissioner Jodi \nHarpstead to submit monthly reports about her efforts to comply with \nMinn. Stat. § 253B.10. \n16. On behalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated persons, \nPlaintiffs O’Shea Chairse and Sean Burgess file this action for \n3 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 12   Filed 03/07/23   Page 4 of 16\ninjunctive and/or monetary relief under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, \nthe Minnesota Constitution, and the common law of Minnesota. \nPlaintiffs seek an immediate writ of mandamus to compel Defendants’ \ncompliance with the law and for damages. \nPARTIES \n17. Plaintiff O’Shea Chairse (“Plaintiff”) is a resident of Minnesota. \n18. Plaintiff Sean Burgess is incarcerated at the Ramsey County Adult \nDetention Center. \n19. Defendant DHS is an agency of the State of Minnesota that has failed \nand continues to fail to comply with Minn. Stat. § 253B.10.   \n20. Defendant Jodi Harpstead is a resident of Minnesota. Harpstead serves \nas the Minnesota Commissioner of Human Services, and was at all \ntimes material herein responsible for DHS’s compliance with \nMinnesota law, including Minn. Stat. § 253B.10. Plaintiff is suing \nHarpstead in her official and individual capacities. \nJURISDICTION \n21. This is an action for injunctive and/or monetary relief under 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 1983 and 1988, the Minnesota Constitution, and the common law of \nMinnesota. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1343(a)(3), 1331, and 1367. Venue lies properly in this \nDistrict pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391, as the events giving rise to this \naction occurred in this District and, on information and belief, \nDefendants reside in this District. \nBACKGROUND \n22. On or about October 17, 2022, Plaintiff Chairse was civilly committed \nas a person who posed a risk of harm due to a mental illness and a \nchemically dependent person to the Commissioner of Human Services. \n4 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 12   Filed 03/07/23   Page 5 of 16\n23. However, the Commissioner of Human Services did not transfer \nPlaintiff Chairse to a state-run facility within 48 hours of his civil \ncommitment on or about October 17, 2022. \n24. Instead, he remained in the Hennepin County Jail until December 5, \n2022, when his caseworker was able to have him admitted into New \nWay Treatment Center. During his time in Hennepin County Jail, he \nwas denied his mental health medications and was kept in a suicide \nunit where he was only allowed out of his cell for short periods to \nshower or use the telephone. \n25. On or about November 9, 2022, Plaintiff Burgess was civilly committed. \n26. However, the Commissioner of Human Services did not transfer \nPlaintiff Burgess to a state-run facility within 48 hours of his civil \ncommitment on or about November 9, 2022. \n27. Instead, he remained in the Ramsey County Adult Detention Center \nuntil early February 2023, when he was admitted into a drug \ntreatment center. However, Plaintiff Burgess became sick with COVID-\n19 while at the drug treatment center and was removed from the center \nfor related reasons, and later returned to the Ramsey County Adult \nDetention Center, where he has been incarcerated (and not transferred \nto a state-run facility) for weeks.   \n28. Plaintiffs and others similarly situated suffered unlawful incarceration, \nlack of access to mental health therapy and treatment, use of force, \ndiminished quality and enjoyment of life, and psychological trauma and \ndistress due to Defendants’ actions and omissions discussed in this \nComplaint. \n \n \n5 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 12   Filed 03/07/23   Page 6 of 16\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n29. Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and all others \nsimilarly situated pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. \n30. Plaintiffs seek to represent two classes defined as: (1) all persons who \nhave been detained in any jail or prison for more than 48 hours after \nhaving been ordered civilly committed under circumstances described \nin any of the four sub-paragraphs of Minn. Stat. § 253B.10, subd. 1(b), \nbut have since been admitted to a state-run treatment facility (the \n“Delayed Admission Class”); and (2) all persons who have been \ndetained in any jail or prison for more than 48 hours after having been \nordered civilly committed under circumstances described in any of the \nfour sub-paragraphs of Minn. Stat. § 253B.10, subd. 1(b), and have not \nyet been admitted or re-admitted (the “Awaiting Admission Class”). \n31. The proposed classes are so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable. The Delayed Admission Class would extend back to the \napplicable statute of limitations, meaning it is likely that the Delayed \nAdmission Class alone would contain hundreds of members. \n32. There are questions of law and fact common to members of the \nproposed classes. These questions predominate over any questions \nunique to any individual class member and include, but are not limited \nto, the following: \n  Whether Minn. Stat. § 253B.10 (“Patients described in this \nparagraph must be admitted to a state-operated treatment \nprogram within 48 hours.”) requires DHS to transfer a civilly \ncommitted inmate within 48 hours of their civil commitment; \n  Whether the liberty interest Plaintiffs and class members have in \nbeing transferred to a state-operated treatment programs within \n6 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 12   Filed 03/07/23   Page 7 of 16\n48 hours of being civilly committed has been or is being violated \nby Defendants; and \n  Whether Defendant’s violation of the 48-hour rule discussed in \nthis Complaint violates Plaintiffs’ and class members’ \nindependent due process right to adequate medical care; \n  Whether Defendants’ conduct violates procedural and/or \nsubstantive due process under the Minnesota or U.S. \nConstitution; \n  Whether Defendants’ conduct constitutes false imprisonment; \nand \n  Plaintiffs’ and class members’ damages. \n33. The claims of the representative parties, the named plaintiffs, are \ntypical of the claims of the members of the class. \n34. The representative parties, the named plaintiffs, will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of their respective classes. Plaintiffs \nand class members have not interests adverse to the interests of their \nrespective classes. Plaintiff are committed to prosecuting this action to \nfinal resolution and have retained competent counsel with experience \nin class action and civil rights litigation who will vigorously pursue this \nlitigation on behalf of the classes. \n35. A class action is superior to other methods of adjudicating this \ncontroversy. \n36. The prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the \nclasses would create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications, \nestablishing incompatible standards of conduct for Defendants. \n7 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 12   Filed 03/07/23   Page 8 of 16\n37. Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally \napplicable to the classes, thereby making appropriate final injunctive \nand/or monetary relief with respect to the classes as a whole.  \n38. The identity of class members would be easily ascertainable from \nDefendants’ records. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT 1 \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 – Fourteenth Amendment Substantive Due Process \nViolations Against Both Defendants \n \n39. Plaintiff and class members restate the allegations contained in the \nprevious paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  \n40. Based on the above factual allegations, Defendants, through their \nactions, acting under the color of state law, violated Plaintiff’s and class \nmembers’ constitutional right to substantive due process under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by failing to \ntransfer Plaintiff and class members to a state-operated treatment \nfacility within 48 hours of their civil commitment. See, e.g., Hall v. \nLombardi, 996 F.2d 954, 958 (8th Cir. 1993) (“There are many Supreme \nCourt and Eighth Circuit cases that support the ‘general, well-\ndeveloped legal principle’ that regulations which contain ‘particularized \nsubstantive standards or criteria that guide the exercise of discretion . . \n. create a protectible liberty interest.  . . .  Moreover, when these \nregulations contain language of a mandatory nature (shall, will, must), \nthey are interpreted as creating a protectible liberty interest.”). \n41. As a result of this due process violation, Plaintiff and class members \nsuffered damages. \n \n \n \n8 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 12   Filed 03/07/23   Page 9 of 16\nCOUNT 2 \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 – Fourteenth Amendment Procedural Due Process \nViolations Against Both Defendants \n \n42. Plaintiff restates the allegations contained in the previous paragraphs \nas if fully set forth herein. \n43. Based on the above factual allegations, Defendants, through their \nactions, acting under the color of state law, violated Plaintiff’s and class \nmembers’ constitutional right to procedural due process under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by failing to \nprovide notice or an opportunity to be heard regarding their decision \nnot to transfer Plaintiff and class members to a state-operated \ntreatment facility within 48 hours of their civil commitment. \n44. As a result of this due process violation, Plaintiff and class members \nsuffered damages. \nCOUNT 3 \nNegligence and Negligence Per Se Against Both Defendants \n \n45. Plaintiff and class members restate the allegations contained in the \nprevious paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n46. Based on the above factual allegations, Defendants owed Plaintiff and \nclass members a duty of care to follow Minnesota state law.  \n47. Defendants breached this duty of care by failing to transfer Plaintiff \nand class members to state-operated treatment facilities within 48 \nhours of their civil commitment. \n48. DHS is vicariously liable to Plaintiff and class members for the \nnegligence of its employees, including but not limited to Defendant \nHarpstead.  \n49. As a direct and proximate result of this negligence, Plaintiff and class \nmembers suffered damages. \n9 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 12   Filed 03/07/23   Page 10 of 16\nCOUNT 4 \nSubstantive Due Process Under the Minnesota Constitution Against Both \nDefendants \n50. Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Classes restate and reallege the previous \nparagraphs above.  \n51. The Due Process protections guaranteed by the Minnesota Constitution \nare coextensive with those guaranteed by the United States \nConstitution. State v. Holloway, 916 N.W.2d 338, 344 (Minn. 2018).  \n52.  Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Classes had a liberty interest in freedom \nfrom incarceration and punishment – or incarceration and punishment \ngreater than the term to which they were sentenced, if any – that is \nentitled to Substantive Due Process protection.  \n53. Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Classes are members of particularly \nvulnerable community in need of special care and consideration \nbecause they are least able to assure the protection of their rights and \nneeds. Prolonged confinement in jailhouse or prison conditions is \npunitively detrimental to the health and wellbeing of those with severe \nmental impairments.  \n54. Defendants’ conduct directly led to the prolonged confinement of \nsociety’s most vulnerable members. Defendant’s systematic and \nongoing disregard for the safety and active sabotage of the wellbeing of \nPlaintiffs and the Plaintiff Classes evinces deliberate injurious intent, \nshocks the conscience, and interferes with rights implicit in the concept \nof ordered liberty. This incarceration is punishment that is prohibited \nunder the Minnesota Constitution absent a criminal conviction.  \n \n \n10 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 12   Filed 03/07/23   Page 11 of 16\nCount 5 \nProcedural Due Process Under the Minnesota Constitution Against Both \nDefendants \n55. Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Classes restate and reallege all previous \nparagraphs of this Complaint. \n56. The Due Process protections guaranteed by the Minnesota Constitution \nare coextensive with those guaranteed by the United States \nConstitution. State v. Holloway, 916 N.W.2d 338, 344 (Minn. 2018). \n57. Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Classes have a liberty interest to be \nadmitted to a state-operated treatment program within 48 hours of \ntheir commitment. The 48-hour rule is not discretionary. The statutory \nlanguage is clear and unambiguous. The statute at issue mandates that \nPlaintiffs and the Plaintiff Classes, by falling within the ambit of civil \ncommitments subject to the 48-hour rule, had a concrete expectation \nthat they would be released from jail and admitted into treatment \nwithin 48 hours. \n58. Defendants’ conduct constitutes a substantial deprivation of liberty. \nUnder the statute at issue, persons who are committed are not only \nentitled to proper mental health treatment, but a host of other services \nand liberties not otherwise afforded to jail detainees or prisoners. \nDespite being found in substantial need of commitment, Defendants’ \nconduct directly caused Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Classes to be held in \njail or prison for weeks or months. \n59. Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Classes’ liberty interest is entitled to Due \nProcess protection, which Defendants violated by refusing to admit \nthem to a state-operated treatment program within 48 hours of their \ncommitment. \n11 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 12   Filed 03/07/23   Page 12 of 16\n60. Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Classes had a separate and independent \nDue Process right to adequate medical care while in state custody. \n61. The medical needs of Plaintiff Burgess and the Awaiting Admission \nClass are unquestionably serious and apparent, as those needs were \nfound by courts to be serious enough to warrant competency \nexamination and treatment. \n62. Defendants conduct, by failing to admit these individuals within the \nrequired 48 hours after a court order committing them to Defendants’ \ncustody, was and continues to be deliberately indifferent to these \nserious medical needs by continuously denying and delaying Plaintiff \nBurgess’s and the Awaiting Admission Class’s access to treatment they \nneeded. \n63. Similarly, the medical needs of Plaintiff Chairse and the Delayed \nAdmission Class were unquestionably serious and apparent, as those \nneeds were found by courts to be serious enough to warrant competency \nexamination and treatment. \n64. Defendants, by failing to timely admit these individuals after a court \norder committing them to Defendants’ care, were deliberately \nindifferent to these serious medical needs by delaying Plaintiff \nChairse’s and the Delayed Admission Class’s access to treatment they \nneeded. \nCount 6 \nFalse Imprisonment Under Minnesota Common Law Against Both \nDefendants \n65. Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Classes restate and reallege the previous \nparagraphs above.  \n12 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 12   Filed 03/07/23   Page 13 of 16\n66. Defendants acted intentionally to confine Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff \nClasses and caused such confinement to continue, which caused \nPlaintiffs and the class members harm. Defendants did so within the \nscope of Defendants’ office or employment.  \n67. A private person who confined Plaintiffs and the class members under \nthe circumstances alleged herein would be civilly liable to Plaintiffs and \nthe class members for false imprisonment.  \n68. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ conduct, Plaintiffs and \nthe class members sustained damages for which Defendants are liable, \nin an amount to be established at trial.  \n69. Defendants had knowledge of and intentionally disregarded facts that \ncreate a high probability of injury to the rights and safety of Plaintiffs \nand the class members, and acted in conscious and intentional \ndisregard of that probability of injury.  \nCount 7 \nIntentional Infliction of Emotional Distress Under Minnesota Common \nLaw Against Both Defendants  \n70. Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Classes restate and reallege all previous \nparagraphs above.  \n71. Defendants’ intentional conduct as alleged herein is extreme and \noutrageous, in that it passes the boundaries of decency and is utterly \nintolerable to the civilized community.  \n72. Defendants’ conduct caused severe emotional distress to Plaintiffs and \nthe Classes.  \n73. A private person who acted in the way Defendants did under the \ncircumstances alleged herein would be civilly liable to Plaintiffs and the \nclass members for intentional infliction of emotional distress.  \n13 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 12   Filed 03/07/23   Page 14 of 16\n74. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ conduct, Plaintiffs and \nthe Classes sustained damages for which Defendants are liable, in an \namount to be established at trial.  \n75. Defendants had knowledge of and intentionally disregarded facts that \ncreate a high probability of injury to the rights and safety of Plaintiffs \nand the Classes and acted in conscious and intentional disregard of \nthat probability of injury.   \nCount 8 \nPetition for Alternative Writ of Mandamus \n76. Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Classes restate and reallege all previous \nparagraphs above.  \n77. Defendants’ refusal to admit Plaintiff Burgess and the Awaiting \nAdmission Class Members to state-operated treatment facilities as \nrequired by Minn. Stat. § 253B.10, subd. 1(b) entitles Plaintiff Burgess \nand the Awaiting Admission Class Members to issuance of an \nalternative writ of mandamus that compels Defendants to comply with \nthe law and awards Plaintiff Burgess and the Awaiting Admission \nClass members any damages resulting from Defendants’ failure to do so  \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiff requests that the Court: \n1.  Certify this matter as a class action under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure Rule 23; \n2.  Define the certified classes as (1) all persons who have been detained in \nany jail or prison for more than 48 hours after having been ordered \ncivilly committed under circumstances described in any of the four sub-\nparagraphs of Minn. Stat. § 253B.10, subd. 1(b), but have since been \n14 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 12   Filed 03/07/23   Page 15 of 16\nadmitted to a state-run treatment facility (the “Delayed Admission \nClass”); and (2) all persons who have been detained in any jail or prison \nfor more than 48 hours after having been ordered civilly committed \nunder circumstances described in any of the four sub-paragraphs of \nMinn. Stat. § 253B.10, subd. 1(b), and have not yet been admitted or re-\nadmitted (the “Awaiting Admission Class”). \n3.  Issue a judgment declaring that Defendants violated and continue to \nviolate the right to due process enshrined in the Minnesota and United \nStates Constitutions when they fail to transfer civilly committed \ninmates to state-operated treatment facilities withing 48 hours of their \ncivil commitment, and an order permanently enjoining Defendants \nfrom depriving Plaintiffs and the class members of their constitutional \nrights. \n4.  Appoint Plaintiffs and their counsel to represent the classes pursuant \nto Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23; \n5.  Issue a writ of mandamus compelling Defendants’ compliance with \nMinn. Stat. § 253B.10(b); \n6.  Schedule a jury trial on the claims of Plaintiffs and class members; \n7.  Award injunctive relief and/or damages to Plaintiffs and class members \nfor the harm they have suffered against each Defendant, jointly and \nseverally, including but not limited to compensatory, pecuniary, and \nmedical expense damages; \n8.  Award punitive damages against Defendant Jodi Harpstead pursuant \nto Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30 (1983); \n9.  Award pre- and post-judgment interest, to the extent allowable; \n10.

OPINION AND ORDER \n \nState of Minnesota Department of Human   \nServices and Jodi Harpstead, Minnesota \nCommissioner of Human Services, in her \nofficial and individual capacities, \nDefendants. \n \n \nZorislav R. Leyderman, The Law Office of Zorislav R. Leyderman, Minneapolis, MN, and \nTimothy M. Phillips, Law Office of Time Phillips, Minneapolis, MN, for Plaintiffs O’Shea \nChairse and Sean Burgess, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated. \n \nSarah Doktori, Aaron Winter, Brandon L. Boese, Scott H. Ikeda, and Sparrowleaf Dilts \nMcGregor, Office of the Minnesota Attorney General, St. Paul, MN, for Defendants State \nof  Minnesota  Department  of  Human  Services  and  Jodi  Harpstead,  Minnesota \nCommissioner of Human Services, in her official and individual capacities. \n \n \nPlaintiffs O’Shea Chairse and Sean Burgess were civilly committed while each was \nin the custody of a Minnesota county jail under criminal charges.  They claim that a \nMinnesota statute, Minn. Stat. § 253B.10, subdiv. 1(b), required their admission to a state-\noperated treatment program within 48 hours of their civil commitments.  Their admissions \nwere delayed well beyond that 48-hour period. \nIn this case, Mr. Chairse and Mr. Burgess have sued the Minnesota Department of \nHuman Services (“Department”) and its Commissioner, Jodi Harpstead, alleging that their \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 47   Filed 09/14/23   Page 2 of 23\n \nfailure to comply with this statutory requirement violated Mr. Chairse and Mr. Burgess’s \ndue process rights under the United States and Minnesota Constitutions, amounted to \nnegligence, false imprisonment, and the intentional infliction of emotional distress under \nMinnesota common law, and warrants the issuance of a writ of mandamus. \nDefendants seek dismissal of Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint under Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6), and the motion will be granted for the most part.  Plaintiffs’ \nsubstantive-due-process and tort claims, and their request for a writ of mandamus, will be \ndismissed.  Plaintiffs’ procedural-due-process claims are plausible.  The case’s posture \ntogether with recent amendments to § 253B.10 raise doubts regarding the availability of a \nremedy that might redress Plaintiffs’ procedural injuries.  Regardless, that issue will be left \nto address as the parties think appropriate. \nMinn. Stat. § 253B.10, subdiv. 1(b) \nThe statute is central to Plaintiffs’ claims, and it helps to describe it up front.  Section \n253B.10 generally describes procedures to be followed when a person is civilly committed.  \nAs relevant here, the statute requires that civilly committed persons who are in a jail or \ncorrectional institution receive priority admission to a state-operated treatment program: \n(b)  The  commissioner  shall  prioritize  patients  being \nadmitted from jail or a correctional institution who are: \n \n(1)  ordered  confined  in  a  state-operated  treatment \nprogram  for  an  examination  under  Minnesota  Rules  of \nCriminal Procedure, rules 20.01, subdivision 4, paragraph (a), \nand 20.02, subdivision 2; \n \n(2) under civil commitment for competency treatment \nand continuing supervision under Minnesota Rules of Criminal \nProcedure, rule 20.01, subdivision 7; \n2 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 47   Filed 09/14/23   Page 3 of 23\n \n \n(3) found not guilty by reason of mental illness under \nMinnesota  Rules  of  Criminal  Procedure,  rule  20.02, \nsubdivision 8, and under civil commitment or are ordered to be \ndetained  in  a  state-operated  treatment  program  pending \ncompletion of the civil commitment proceedings; or \n \n(4) committed under this chapter to the commissioner \nafter dismissal of the patient's criminal charges. \n \nPatients described in this paragraph must be admitted to a state-\noperated treatment program within 48 hours. The commitment \nmust be ordered by the court as provided in section 253B.09, \nsubdivision 1, paragraph (d). \nMinn. Stat. § 253B.10, subdiv. 1(b).  Section 253B.09, subdiv. 1(d) reads, in relevant part: \n“If a person is committed to a state-operated treatment program . . ., the court shall order \nthe commitment to the commissioner.  The commissioner shall designate the placement of \nthe person to the court.”   \nThe parties disagree regarding when the 48-hour admission deadline begins to run.  \nPlaintiffs argue that the entry of a commitment order triggers the deadline.  See Pls.’ Mem. \nin Opp’n [ECF No. 38] at 1.  Defendants argue that the 48-hour admission deadline begins \nto run “from the time at which a medically-appropriate bed is available.”  Defs.’ Mem. in \nSupp. [ECF No. 28] at 6 n.3.   \nFor essentially three reasons, this order will assume without deciding that Plaintiffs’ \ninterpretation of the 48-hour rule is correct.  (1) This question did not receive primary or \nextensive discussion in the parties’ briefs.  Defendants defended their interpretation first \nand only in connection with Plaintiffs’ alternative request for a writ of mandamus, and then \nmerely to argue that “[b]ecause the statutory duty is not sufficiently clear, Plaintiffs’ \n3 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 47   Filed 09/14/23   Page 4 of 23\n \nmandamus petition must be dismissed as a matter of law.”  Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. at 29 \n(emphasis  added);  see  id.  at  25–29.    Plaintiffs  did  not  specifically  defend  their \ninterpretation.  See generally Pls.’ Mem. in Opp’n.  Plaintiffs cited to authorities endorsing \ntheir interpretation, but Plaintiffs’ citations lack the specificity necessary to assess the \nweight to be given those authorities.  (2)  During the 2023 regular session, the legislature \namended the statute to explicitly incorporate Defendants’ interpretation.  As amended, the \nstatute includes a new subsection (e) that reads: “Patients described in paragraph (b) must \nbe admitted to a state-operated treatment program within 48 hours of the Office of Medical \nDirector, under section 246.018, or a designee determining that a medically appropriate \nbed is available. This paragraph expires on June 30, 2025.”  Act of May 24, 2023, ch. 61, \n2023 Minn. Laws.  The amendment was “effective the day following final enactment.”  \nId.  Final enactment “means the date and time of day the governor signed the bill.”  Minn. \nStat. § 645.01, subdiv. 2.  The governor signed the bill, S.F. No. 2934, on May 24, 2023.  \nAct of May 24, 2023, ch. 61, 2023 Minn. Laws.  The amendment thus was effective May \n25, 2023.  The parties did not address the effect of this amendment on Plaintiffs’ claims.  \nNotably, Defendants did not argue that the amended statute applies retroactively.  See, e.g., \nNegri v. Patton-Minder, No. A22-0658, 2022 WL 17574697, at ** 5–6 (Minn. Ct. App. \nDec. 12, 2022).  The absence of this argument implies that Defendants may not believe that \nthe amendment was enacted to clarify the prior version, but this question deserves to be \naddressed specifically.  (3) The 48-hour rule is the subject of a related case assigned to me \nand  scheduled  to  be  heard—on  a  motion  to  dismiss  and  a  competing  motion  for  a \npreliminary injunction—on October 23, 2023.  See Dalen v. Harpstead, No. 23-cv-1877.  \n4 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 47   Filed 09/14/23   Page 5 of 23\n \nI anticipate that the statutory interpretation issue may receive further helpful attention or \nclarification in that context. \nRelevant Facts \n“On or about October 17, 2022, [Mr.] Chairse was civilly committed as a person \nwho posed a risk of harm due to mental illness and a chemically dependent person to the \nCommissioner of Human Services.”  Am. Compl. [ECF No. 12] ¶ 22.  Though the \nAmended Complaint is not explicit, it pretty clearly implies that Mr. Chairse was in the \ncustody of the Hennepin County Jail on the date he was civilly committed.  See id. ¶¶ 22–\n24.  Mr. Chairse “remained in the Hennepin County Jail until December 5, 2022, when his \ncaseworker was able to have him admitted into New Way Treatment Center.”  Id. ¶ 24.  \n“During his time in Hennepin County Jail, [Mr. Chairse] was denied his mental health \nmedications and was kept in a suicide unit where he was allowed out of his cell for short \nperiods to shower or use the telephone.”  Id.  “On or about November 9, 2022, [Mr.] \nBurgess was civilly committed.”  Id. ¶ 25.  The Amended Complaint implies that Mr. \nBurgess was in custody at the Ramsey County Adult Detention Center on the date he was \ncivilly committed.  See id. ¶¶ 25–27.  Mr. Burgess “remained in the Ramsey County Adult \nDetention Center until early February 2023, when he was admitted into a drug treatment \ncenter.”  Id. ¶ 27.  “However, [Mr.] Burgess became sick with COVID-19 while at the drug \ntreatment center and was removed from the center for related reasons[.]”  Id.  He “was \nreturned to the Ramsey County Adult Detention Center,” where he remained incarcerated \nup to the filing of this case.  Id. ¶ 27. \n   \n5 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 47   Filed 09/14/23   Page 6 of 23\n \nThis Case \nPlaintiffs filed their original Complaint in Minnesota’s Fourth Judicial District \n(Hennepin County) on January 23, 2023.  Notice of Removal [ECF No. 1] ¶ 1.  Defendants \nremoved the case to this court, id., and filed a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ \noriginal Complaint soon after, see Motion [ECF No. 5].  Plaintiffs responded by filing their \nAmended Complaint.  Defendants then moved (again) to dismiss the Amended Complaint \nunder Rule 12(b)(6).  Motion [ECF No. 26].  Plaintiffs assert six claims in their Amended \nComplaint: (1) a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging that Defendants failure to comply \nwith Minn. Stat. § 253B.10 violated Plaintiffs’ substantive-due-process rights under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 39–41; (2) a § \n1983 claim alleging that Defendants failure to comply with Minn. Stat. § 253B.10 violated \nPlaintiffs’ procedural-due-process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates  Constitution,  Am.  Compl.  ¶¶  42–44;  (3)  a  negligence  claim  under  Minnesota \ncommon law; (4) a substantive-due-process claim under the Minnesota Constitution; (5) a \nprocedural-due-process claim under the Minnesota constitution; (6) a false-imprisonment \nclaim under Minnesota common law; (7) a claim for intentional infliction of emotional \ndistress under Minnesota common law; and (8) alternatively, a petition for a writ of \nmandamus that would require Defendants to comply with Minn. Stat. § 253B.10, subdiv. \n1(b).1 \n \n1   Plaintiffs filed, but then withdrew, a motion for class certification.  See Motion [ECF \nNo. 19]; Letter [ECF No. 39]. \n6 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 47   Filed 09/14/23   Page 7 of 23\n \nRule 12(b)(6) Standards \nIn reviewing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), a \ncourt must accept as true all of the factual allegations in the complaint and draw all \nreasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor.  Gorog v. Best Buy Co., 760 F.3d 787, 792 \n(8th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted).  Although the factual allegations need not be detailed, \nthey must be sufficient to “raise a right to relief above the speculative level.”  Bell Atl. \nCorp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  The complaint must “state a claim to relief \nthat is plausible on its face.”  Id. at 570.  “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff \npleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009). \n§ 1983 – Fourteenth Amendment Substantive Due Process \nAs the Eighth Circuit has explained:  \nIn  addition  to  its  procedural  protections,  the  Due  Process \nClause protects individual liberties from government action \n“regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement \nthem.”  Mills v. City of Grand Forks, 614 F.3d 495, 498 (8th \nCir.  2010)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).    To  state \na substantive due process claim  against  a  state  official,  a \nplaintiff  must  demonstrate  that  a  fundamental  right  was \nviolated and that the official’s conduct shocks the conscience.  \nFolkerts v. City of Waverly, 707 F.3d 975, 980 (8th Cir. 2013).  \nWhether conduct shocks the conscience is a question of law.  \nId.  Conscience shocking conduct only includes “the most \nsevere violations of individual rights that result from the brutal \nand inhumane abuse of official power.”  White v. Smith, 696 \nF.3d 740, 757–58 (8th Cir. 2012) (quotation marks omitted).  \n“Only a purpose to cause harm unrelated to the legitimate \nobject of the government action in question will satisfy the \nelement  of  arbitrary  conduct  shocking  to  the  conscience, \n7 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 47   Filed 09/14/23   Page 8 of 23\n \nnecessary for a due process violation.”  Folkerts, 707 F.3d at \n981 (cleaned up). \n \nMitchell v. Dakota Cnty. Soc. Servs., 959 F.3d 887, 898 (8th Cir. 2020).  A fundamental \nright is one that is “objectively, ‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.’”  \nWashington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720–21 (1997) (quoting Moore v. City of East \nCleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503 (1977)). \nHere, the Amended Complaint does not allege facts plausibly showing the violation \nof a fundamental right or conscience-shocking conduct.  (1) The Amended Complaint \nalleges no facts addressing whether the 48-hour rule of Minn. Stat. § 253B.10, subdiv. 1(b) \nis “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.”  Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 720–21.  \nThe proposition seems dubious.  And the cases Plaintiffs cite to support this point are off \ntopic.  See Pls.’ Mem. in Opp’n at 7–12.  Some cases address incarceration generally, and \nthus are not directed to the 48-hour rule.  Other cases concern whether a protected liberty \ninterest exists for purposes of a procedural-due-process claim, but that is a different issue.  \n(2) It is not difficult to accept the notion that a hypothetical failure to comply with the 48-\nhour rule might plausibly be conscience-shocking depending on the failure’s duration and \nperhaps  other  considerations.    But  the  Amended  Complaint  does  not  reflect  an \nindividualized  theory.    The  Amended  Complaint’s  theory  is  that  every  48-hour-rule \nviolation  is  conscience-shocking.    No  allegations  plausibly  support  that  categorical \nassertion.2 \n \n2   To be clear, I do not understand the Amended Complaint to allege either a claim \nthat Plaintiffs received constitutionally inadequate medical care or that Plaintiffs were \nsubjected to punitive conditions of confinement.  See Karsjens v. Lourey, 988 F.3d 1047, \n8 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 47   Filed 09/14/23   Page 9 of 23\n \n§ 1983 – Fourteenth Amendment Procedural Due Process \n“As for the Due Process Clause, standard analysis under that provision proceeds in \ntwo steps: We ask first whether there exists a liberty or property interest of which a person \nhas been deprived, and if so we ask whether the procedures followed by the State were \nconstitutionally sufficient.”  Swarthout v. Cooke, 562 U.S. 216, 219 (2011). \nIf the plaintiff cannot identify any protected liberty or property interest of which he \nwas deprived, “any procedural due process claim necessarily fails.”  Beaulieu v. Ludeman, \n690 F.3d 1017, 1047 (8th Cir. 2012); see Senty-Haugen v. Goodno, 462 F.3d 876, 886 (8th \nCir. 2006) (explaining that courts do not consider what process is due unless a plaintiff has \na protected liberty or property interest).  The United States Supreme Court has identified \nand  applied  several  rules  to  determine  whether  state  law  creates  a  constitutionally \nenforceable liberty interest.  “A state-created liberty interest arises when a state imposes \n‘substantive limitations on official discretion.’”  Forrester v. Bass, 397 F.3d 1047, 1055 \n(8th Cir. 2005) (quoting Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U.S. 238, 249 (1983)).  To answer \nwhether a state law creates an enforceable liberty interest, a court must “‘examine[] closely \nthe language of the relevant statutes and regulations.’”  Id. (quoting Ky. Dep’t of Corr. v. \nThompson, 490 U.S. 454, 461 (1989)).  “‘[T]he most common manner in which a State \ncreates a liberty interest is by establishing ‘substantive predicates’ to govern official \ndecision-making, and, further, by mandating the outcome to be reached upon a finding that \n \n1051–53 (8th Cir. 2021).  Either theory would require individualized allegations not \nadvanced in the Amended Complaint, presumably because Plaintiffs rely only on the 48-\nhour rule and its general purpose to support their substantive-due-process claim.    \n9 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 47   Filed 09/14/23   Page 10 of 23\n \nthe relevant criteria have been met.”  Id. (quoting Thompson, 490 U.S. at 462).  In \nThompson, the Supreme Court “articulated a requirement that statutes and regulations must \ncontain ‘explicitly mandatory language, i.e., specific directives to the decisionmaker that \nif the regulations’ substantive predicates are present, a particular outcome must follow, in \norder to create a liberty interest.’”  Id. (quoting Thompson, 490 U.S. at 463). \nJudged against these rules, the 48-hour rule in Minn. Stat. § 253B.10, subdiv. 1(b) \ncreates a constitutionally enforceable liberty interest.  A close examination of the statute \nshows that it establishes substantive predicates that, if met, mandate a specific outcome.  If \na person who is civilly committed (a) is “being admitted from jail or a correctional \ninstitution” and (b) falls within one (or more) of the four categories described in § 253B.10, \nsubdiv. 1(b)(1) through (4), then (c) that person “must be admitted to a state-operated \ntreatment program within 48 hours.”  Minn. Stat. § 253B.10, subdiv. 1(b).  To phrase this \nif-then statutory regime in the Supreme Court and Eighth Circuit’s cases’ terms, the \nsubstantive  predicates  (the  “ifs”)  are  whether  the  civilly  committed  person  is  being \nadmitted from a jail or correctional institution and whether the person falls within one of \nthe four specified categories, and the mandated outcome (the “then”) is that person’s \nadmission “to a state-operated treatment program within 48 hours.”  Id. \nDefendants’ arguments that Minn. Stat. § 253B.10, subdiv. 1(b) does not create an \nenforceable liberty interest are not persuasive.  Defendants address this specific question \nin a footnote.  See Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. at 12 n.6.  They argue that the statute mandates \nno particular outcome because it “does not specify when the referenced forty-eight hours \nshould start running.”  Id.  The decision to assume (without deciding) that Plaintiffs’ \n10 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 47   Filed 09/14/23   Page 11 of 23\n \ninterpretation of the 48-hour rule is correct addresses this contention.  In the same footnote, \nDefendants cite Williams v. Nix, 1 F.3d 712 (8th Cir. 1993).  There, the court determined \nthat  a  prison  policy  regarding  transferring  inmates  to  other  institutions  created  no \nenforceable liberty interest for purposes of a Fourteenth Amendment procedural-due-\nprocess claim because the policy did not limit prison officials’ discretion and did not \n“command a particular outcome or response when certain conditions are found to exist.”  \nId. at 717–18.  As explained in the preceding paragraph, Minn. Stat. § 253B.10, subdiv. \n1(b) is materially different.  It limits officials’ discretion and commands a specific outcome. \nConsider next whether the State’s procedures were “constitutionally adequate.”  \nParrish v. Mallinger, 133 F.3d 612, 615 (8th Cir. 1998).  “This inquiry examines ‘the \nprocedural safeguards built into the statutory or administrative procedure of effecting the \ndeprivation, and any remedies for erroneous deprivations provided by statute or tort \nlaw.’”  Id. (quoting Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 126 (1990)).  “Relevant factors \ninclude the affected private interest, the risk of an erroneous deprivation, the probable value \nof additional procedural safeguards, and the government’s interest, including burdens that \nadditional safeguards would entail.”  Id. (citing Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335 \n(1976)). \nThe better answer is that this aspect of Plaintiffs’ claim is sufficient.  Plaintiffs’ \nprimary  point  appears  to  be  that  no  procedures  exist  to  ensure  the  commissioner’s \ncompliance with the 48-hour rule.  In other words, once a person is civilly committed, \nMinn. Stat. § 253B.10, subdiv. 1(b) authorizes the Commissioner to determine whether \nthat person is in one of the four categories of persons whose admission to a state-operated \n11 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 47   Filed 09/14/23   Page 12 of 23\n \ntreatment program must occur within 48 hours.  The statute, however, establishes no \nprocess by which a civilly committed person might seek to show that he or she is within \none of these four priority categories—or to challenge a decision that he or she is not.  Nor \ndoes the statute establish any process by which a civilly committed person might seek to \nshow that he or she is at risk of not being—or was not—admitted to a state-operated \ntreatment program within 48 hours.  As Plaintiffs’ counsel observed at the hearing, there \nare no procedural safeguards governing the 48-hour rule.3 \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs’ claim “is not a claim about denial of process.”  \nDefs.’ Mem. in Supp. at 11.  In Defendants’ understanding of the Amended Compliant, \nPlaintiffs “are not seeking a hearing or opportunity to be heard on whether they are entitled \nto admission to a state-operated treatment facility within 48 hours from civil commitment.”  \nId. at 11–12.  Defendants argue that “[n]o amount of procedure – notices, hearings, process \n– would change [Plaintiffs’] claim that they are entitled to this substantive outcome.”  Id. \nat 12.     \nThough there is room for misunderstanding, I do not think this line of argument \nfairly characterizes Plaintiffs’ procedural-due-process claim.  For this claim’s purposes, \nPlaintiffs allege, not merely that their prolonged jailing following their civil commitments \nviolated the 48-hour rule, but also that these violations resulted from the absence of \navailable procedures through which Plaintiffs might have raised their prioritized admission \n \n3   The parties have not addressed whether, beyond Minn. Stat. § 253B.10, a procedure \nmight be available to challenge an adverse determination, or whether the availability of \nsuch a procedure might remedy the absence of procedures in § 253B.10. \n12 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 47   Filed 09/14/23   Page 13 of 23\n \nstatus and challenged their prolonged jailing.  It would require construing the Amended \nComplaint’s allegations in Defendants’ favor (and thus run counter to the controlling Rule \n12(b)(6) standards) to say, as Defendants suggest, that any procedures would have made \nno difference.  The two Eighth Circuit cases Defendants cite to support this argument—\nBagley v. Rogerson, 5 F.3d 325 (8th Cir. 1993), and Meis v. Gunter, 906 F.2d 364 (8th Cir. \n1990)—do not cast doubt on the plausibility of Plaintiffs’ procedural-due-process claims.  \nThis is because the cases did not address procedural-due-process claims; in each, the court \nrejected a substantive-due-process claim premised only on an alleged violation of a state \nstatute.  Bagley, 5 F.3d at 328–29; Meis, 906 F.2d at 368–69. \nMinnesota Constitution \nThe parties agree that Plaintiffs’ substantive and procedural-due-process claims \nunder the Minnesota Constitution are coextensive with their claims under the federal \nConstitution.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 51, 56; Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. at 5 n.2.  For this reason, \nPlaintiffs’  substantive-due-process  claim  under  the  Minnesota  Constitution  will  be \ndismissed.  Were this the only question concerning the viability of Plaintiffs’ procedural-\ndue-process  claim  under  the  Minnesota  Constitution,  it  would  survive  against  both \nDefendants intact.  It is not. \nThe  parties  disagree  whether  Plaintiffs  have  alleged  facts  plausibly  showing \nCommissioner Harpstead’s individual-capacity liability.  “To establish personal liability of \nthe  supervisory  defendants,  [the  plaintiff]  must  allege  specific  facts  of  personal \ninvolvement in, or direct responsibility for, a deprivation of his constitutional rights.”  \nMayorga v. Missouri, 442 F.3d 1128, 1132 (8th Cir. 2006); see Greiger v. Minn. Dep’t of \n13 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 47   Filed 09/14/23   Page 14 of 23\n \nHum. Servs., No. 13-cv-2140 (JRT/LIB), 2013 WL 5596599, at *3 (D. Minn. Oct. 11, \n2013) (“In a civil rights action, the ‘plaintiff must plead that each Government-official \ndefendant through the official’s own individual actions, has violated the Constitution.’”  \n(quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 676)).  Alleging that a defendant has general responsibility for \nsupervising the operations of a department is insufficient to establish personal involvement.  \nOuzts v. Cummins, 825 F.2d 1276, 1277 (8th Cir. 1987).  A director may be sufficiently \ninvolved,  however,  if  she  makes  policy  decisions  that  directly  result  in  the  alleged \nunconstitutional conditions.  Id.; Beck v. LaFleur, 257 F.3d 764, 766 (8th Cir. 2001) \n(dismissing  complaint  where  it  failed  to  identify  specific  policies  instituted  by  the \ncommissioner).  A supervisor may also be liable if she “fail[ed] to train or supervise the \noffending actor [who] caused the deprivation.”  Parrish v. Ball, 594 F.3d 993, 1001 (8th \nCir. 2010). \nPlaintiffs  do  not  allege  facts  plausibly  showing  Commissioner  Harpstead’s \nindividual involvement in the deprivation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.  The Amended \nComplaint mentions Commissioner Harpstead in just five of its more than 80 paragraphs.  \nIt alleges that a Scott County District Court Judge ordered Commissioner Harpstead to \nprovide reports regarding compliance with the 48-hour rule and that the Department \nappealed this order.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 14–15.  It alleges that Commissioner Harpstead “was \nat all times material herein responsible for [the Department’s] compliance with Minnesota \nlaw, including Minn. Stat. § 253B.10.”  Id. ¶ 20.  It alleges that the Department “is \nvicariously liable to Plaintiff[s] and class members for the negligence of its employees, \nincluding but not limited to Defendant Harpstead.”  Id. ¶ 48.  And it requests an award of \n14 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 47   Filed 09/14/23   Page 15 of 23\n \npunitive  damages  against  her.    Id.  at  15.    At  most,  these  paragraphs  allege  that \nCommissioner Harpstead possesses general supervisory responsibility, not personal or \ndirect involvement in Plaintiffs’ procedural deprivations. \nPlaintiffs  acknowledge  that  they  “do  not  allege  that  Commissioner  Harpstead \npersonally interfered with or denied their timely transfers,” but argue that the Amended \nComplaint’s allegations show that she “has personally chosen the option of inaction despite \nbeing put on notice of the growing civil commitment crisis.”  Pls.’ Mem. in Opp’n at 20.  \nThis is not convincing.  The Amended Complaint does not allege facts suggesting that \n“inaction” with respect to the 48-hour rule was Commissioner Harpstead’s choice.  If it \ndid, that allegation says nothing about what role Commissioner Harpstead played, if any, \nin the absence of procedures directed to the 48-hour rule.  Plaintiffs’ individual-capacity \nclaims against Commissioner Harpstead will be dismissed.  The dismissal of Plaintiffs’ \nindividual-capacity  claims  against  Commissioner  Harpstead  on  this  basis  makes  it \nunnecessary to address the Commissioner’s alternative qualified-immunity argument.  See \nDefs.’ Mem. in Supp. at 15–16. \nDefendants argue that damages are not available under the Minnesota Constitution \nbecause Minnesota does not have a § 1983 analog.  Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. at 16.  “Minnesota \ncourts  explicitly  refuse  to  find  causes  of  action  for  damages  under  the  Minnesota \nConstitution on their own unless the Minnesota Supreme Court has recognized the cause \nof action.”  Riehm v. Engelking, 538 F.3d 952, 969 (8th Cir. 2008) (citing Mitchell v. \nSteffen, 487 N.W.2d 896, 905 (Minn. Ct. App. 1992), aff’d on other grounds, 504 N.W.2d \n198 (Minn. 1993); and Bird v. State, Dep't of Pub. Safety, 375 N.W.2d 36, 40 (Minn. Ct. \n15 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 47   Filed 09/14/23   Page 16 of 23\n \nApp.  1985));  see  also  Smith  v.  Youngbird,  No.  21-cv-2249  (DSD/ECW),  2022  WL \n3648700, at *9 (D. Minn. July 29, 2022), report and recommendation accepted,  2022 WL \n3647862 (Aug. 24, 2022).  Plaintiffs did not respond to this argument, meaning they have \nwaived their right to oppose it.  See Doe v. Mayorkas, No. 22-cv-00752 (ECT/DTS), 2022 \nWL 4450272, at *2 (D. Minn. Sept. 23, 2022) (citing Espey v. Nationstar Mortg., LLC, No. \n13-cv-2979 (ADM/JSM), 2014 WL 2818657, at *11 (D. Minn. June 19, 2014)). \n* \n“[N]either a State nor its officials acting in their official capacities are ‘persons’ \nunder § 1983.”  Will v. Mich. Dep’t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989).  For this reason, \nthe dismissal of Plaintiffs’ individual-capacity claims against Commissioner Harpstead \nmeans  Plaintiffs  cannot  recover  damages  in  connection  with  their  §  1983  claims.  \nOrdinarily, injunctive relief may be sought.  Id. at 71 n.10.  And, as just noted, damages \nare not available in connection with Plaintiffs’ procedural-due-process claim under the \nMinnesota Constitution.  Considered in light of the recent amendment to Minn. Stat. § \n253B.10, subdiv. 1, the unavailability of a damages remedy for Plaintiffs’ procedural-due-\nprocess claim makes it difficult to envision what available equitable remedy or remedies \nmight redress Plaintiffs’ procedural injuries.  The parties have not addressed this question. \nNegligence \nTo plead a negligence claim, a plaintiff must allege facts plausibly showing (1) the \nexistence of a duty of care; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) an injury; and (4) the breach of \nthe duty was the proximate cause of the injury.  Lubbers v. Anderson, 539 N.W.2d 398, \n401 (Minn. 1995).  A statute establishes a standard of care “where an underlying common \n16 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 47   Filed 09/14/23   Page 17 of 23\n \nlaw cause of action exists[.]”  Bruegger v. Faribault Cnty. Sheriff’s Dep’t, 497 N.W.2d \n260, 262 (Minn. 1993). \nHere, Plaintiffs identify no underlying common law cause of action.  They argue \nonly that § 253B.10, subdiv. 1(b) creates a statutory duty and the Department’s violation \nof that duty is negligence per se.  Pls.’ Mem. in Opp’n at 15.  To support this legal \ncontention, Plaintiffs cite Alderman’s Inc. v. Shanks, 536 N.W.2d 4 (Minn. 1995).  There, \nthe Minnesota Supreme Court explained: “It is well settled under Minnesota law that \nbreach of a statute gives rise to negligence per se if the persons harmed by that violation \nare within the intended protection of the statute and the harm suffered is of the type the \nlegislation was intended to prevent.”  Id. at 8 (quotation omitted). \nIn Bruegger, the plaintiffs advanced essentially this same theory, arguing that a \nMinnesota statute, the Crime Victims Reparations Act (“CVRA”), Minn. Stat. § 611A.66, \nimposed a duty on law enforcement agencies to inform crime victims of their right to seek \nreparations and that a violation of the statute gave rise to a common-law negligence claim.  \nBruegger, 497 N.W.2d at 260–61.  The Minnesota Supreme Court rejected this argument.  \nThe court explained: \nAppellants argue that “[a]n unexcused violation of a statute \nthat establishes a standard of care is negligence, and liability is \nthe  consequence  if  proximate  causation  is  proved,”  citing \nLorshbough v. Township of Buzzle, 258 N.W.2d 96, 98 (Minn. \n1977). \n  \nIn Lorshbough, Beltrami County, while required by statute to \nenforce  state  pollution  control  regulations  regarding  solid \nwaste  disposal,  knowingly  failed  to  comply  with  the \nregulations and failed to abate a known fire hazard.  As a result, \nthe disposal site caught fire and caused a forest fire which \n17 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 47   Filed 09/14/23   Page 18 of 23\n \ndestroyed  real  and  personal  property  of  the  neighboring \nplaintiffs.  Id. at 97.  The plaintiffs sued the county, arguing \nthat the county failed to uphold its statutory duty to maintain \nthe disposal site in a safe condition.  This court ruled that a \nstatute could establish a standard of care, breach of which \ncould give rise to liability in tort.  Id. at 102.  Appellants argue \nthat our holding in Lorshbough is controlling in this case.  We \ndisagree, because we read Lorshbough as stating that where an \nunderlying common law cause of action exists, a statutory \nenactment could establish a standard of care in a negligence \naction. \n \nIn Lorshbough, absent the statute, Beltrami County would still \nhave been subject to suit in common law negligence because \nof its failure to properly maintain the dump, thereby allowing \nthe forest fire to develop.  Instead of creating a new cause of \naction for improper maintenance of public property causing \ndamage  to  neighboring  plaintiffs,  the  statute  merely \nestablished the standard of care to be applied for public bodies \ncharged with the duty of maintaining township dumps. \n \nBruegger, 497 N.W.2d at 261–62 (footnote omitted).  Applying this rule, the court in \nBruegger  affirmed  the  case’s  dismissal  because  “no  common  law  duty  required  the \nsheriff’s department to inform the Brueggers of their potential rights of recovery under the \nCVRA.  The requirement to inform did not arise until the enactment of the CVRA.”  Id. at \n262.  The court also noted “that the CVRA does not provide for civil liability for a law \nenforcement agency’s failure to inform citizens of their potential rights to recover under \nthe act.”  Id. \nWe have just that situation here.  Plaintiffs identify no common law duty that might \nhave  required  the  Department  to  prioritize  their  transfer  from  a  jail  or  correctional \ninstitution to a state-operated or similar treatment program.  See Pls.’ Mem. in Opp’n at \n15–16.  The prioritization and transfer requirement, and the 48-hour rule, did not arise until \n18 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 47   Filed 09/14/23   Page 19 of 23\n \nenactment of Minn. Stat. § 253B.10, subdiv. 1(b).  And the statute provides no private right \nof action for the Department’s failure to comply with the 48-hour rule.  Adhering to \nBruegger, Plaintiffs’ negligence claim is legally implausible and must be dismissed. \nFalse Imprisonment \nFalse imprisonment is an intentional tort.  Wild v. Rarig, 234 N.W.2d 775, 792 \n(Minn. 1975).  A claim for false imprisonment requires: “(1) words or acts intended to \nconfine, (2) actual confinement, and (3) awareness by the plaintiff that he is confined.”  \nBlaz v. Molin Concrete Prod. Co., 244 N.W.2d 277, 279 (Minn. 1976).  The first element \nis generally understood to require an affirmative act.  See Heilman v. Courtney for Minn. \nDep’t of Corrs., No. A17-0863, 2019 WL 4008097, at *2 (Minn. Ct. App. Aug. 26, 2019) \n(“Minnesota draws on the Restatement (Second) of Torts to define false imprisonment, \nunder  which  false  imprisonment  requires  an  ‘act’  intended  to  confine  another.”); \nPalmentere v. Campbell, 344 F.2d 234, 238 (8th Cir. 1965) (“An affirmative act is \nnecessary to render one liable for false imprisonment.  Consent to or acquiescence in the \nacts of another for which one is not otherwise responsible cannot be used as the basis of \nthe imposition of liability for false imprisonment.”); Davis v. Weil Clothing Co., 367 \nS.W.2d 19, 23 (Mo. Ct. App. 1963) (“A cause of action for false imprisonment cannot be \nbased upon a mere negation or failure to speak or act, but can only be based upon some \naffirmative act instigating thereto.” (quotation omitted)).  In Heilman, the Minnesota Court \nof  Appeals  held  that  the  “affirmative  act”  requirement  is  not  satisfied  if  the  false \nimprisonment “claim is premised on a failure to conduct an official inspection based on a \n‘risk’ of [a prisoner’s] over-incarceration.”  2019 WL 4008097, at *2. \n19 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 47   Filed 09/14/23   Page 20 of 23\n \nPlaintiffs’ false imprisonment claim is not plausible.  (1) Plaintiffs do not allege that \ntheir  initial  imprisonments  were  unlawful  or  improper  for  any  reason.    Regardless, \nPlaintiffs  do  not  allege  that  the  Department  had  anything  to  do  with  their  initial \nimprisonments.  (2) Nor do Plaintiffs allege that the Department acted intentionally and \naffirmatively to imprison them.  Plaintiffs’ theory is that the Department “fail[ed] to \ntransfer them to a state-operated treatment facility” in compliance with the 48-hour rule.  \nAm. Compl. ¶ 2.  But as the cases cited in the preceding paragraph make clear, a failure to \nact does not generally trigger liability for false imprisonment.  (3) Plaintiffs plausibly allege \nthat their confinement conditions changed, or would have changed, on transfer to a state-\noperated treatment program.  But it is difficult to understand how a failure to change \nconfinement conditions can be false imprisonment.  Plaintiffs were imprisoned in the \nrelevant sense whether they were in jail or civilly committed to a state-operated treatment \nprogram.  Either way, Plaintiffs were “confined against [their] will.”  Gleason v. Metro. \nCouncil Transit Operations, 563 N.W.2d 309, 319 (Minn. Ct. App. 1997).  (4) Plaintiffs \ncite no case or other authority suggesting that a false imprisonment claim might be \nplausible on these or similar facts. \nIntentional Infliction of Emotional Distress \nTo plead a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress under Minnesota \nlaw, Plaintiffs must allege facts plausibly showing “(1) the conduct was extreme and \noutrageous; (2) the conduct was intentional or reckless; (3) [the conduct] caused emotional \ndistress; and (4) the distress was severe.”  K.A.C. v. Benson, 527 N.W.2d 553, 560 (Minn. \n1995) (citation omitted); see also Hubbard v. United Press Int’l, Inc., 330 N.W.2d 428, \n20 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 47   Filed 09/14/23   Page 21 of 23\n \n438–39 (Minn. 1983).  To be “extreme and outrageous,” conduct must be “so atrocious \nthat  it  passes  the  boundaries  of  decency  and  is  utterly  intolerable  to  the  civilized \ncommunity.”  Hubbard, 330 N.W.2d at 439.  “Severe emotional distress” occurs when “the \ndistress inflicted is so severe that no reasonable man could be expected to endure it.”  Id.  \n“The operation of this tort is sharply limited to cases involving particularly egregious \nfacts.”  Id. \nPlaintiffs’  intentional-infliction-of-emotional-distress  claim  is  not  plausible.  \nPlaintiffs have not alleged facts suggesting that Defendants’ conduct was extreme and \noutrageous.  Plaintiffs do not allege that the Department’s failure to admit them to a state-\noperated treatment program was extreme and outrageous in the abstract.  Their claim \ndepends entirely on the alleged violation of the 48-hour rule in Minn. Stat. § 253B.10, \nsubdiv. 1(b).  It is difficult to understand how the admission delays Plaintiffs allege—even \nif violations of the statute—might be “utterly intolerable to the civilized community,” \nHubbard, 330 N.W.2d at 439, when the legislature might reasonably have chosen any \nnumber of ways to address this issue.  Plaintiffs do not argue, for example, that the recent \namendment to § 253B.10, which will lengthen admission delays, creates an atrocious or \nintolerable regime.  Again, Plaintiffs cite no factually similar case or authority that might \nsupport this claim given Plaintiffs’ theory.  \nWrit of Mandamus \nThe Amended Complaint is not specific regarding the authority for this claim.  \nPresumably, because Plaintiffs brought their case originally in Minnesota state court, they \nintended to rely on Minnesota law.  If that remains the case, I do not think the writ is \n21 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 47   Filed 09/14/23   Page 22 of 23\n \navailable.    Under  Minnesota  law,  “‘[t]he  authority  to  issue  a  writ  of  mandamus  is \nstatutory.’”  Mendota Golf, LLP v. City of Mendota Heights, 708 N.W.2d 162, 171 (Minn. \n2006) (quoting State v. Wilson, 632 N.W.2d 225, 227 (Minn. 2001)); see Minn. Stat. §§ \n586.01–586.12.  With exceptions not relevant here, the statute vests Minnesota state district \ncourts with “exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases of mandamus[.]”  Minn. Stat. § \n586.11.  The parties have not addressed, and I doubt based on its text, that a federal district \ncourt has power to issue a writ of mandamus under the Minnesota mandamus statute.  \nPerhaps Plaintiffs intended to rely on federal law for their request, but that relief is \nunavailable too.  A federal district court possesses jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus \n“to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a \nduty owed to the plaintiff.”  28 U.S.C. § 1361.  The statute does not give a district court \njurisdiction “to issue a writ of mandamus compelling a state actor to act.”  Herbert v. \nWinona Cnty., 111 F. Supp. 3d 970, 975 (D. Minn. 2015); see also Rivera v. State of \nMinnesota, No. 22-cv-1129 (KMM/BRT), 2022 WL 4298745, at *1 (D. Minn. Sept. 19, \n2022) (same).4 \n \n4   Defendants argue that they possess statutory immunity under Minn. Stat. § 253B.23, \nsubdiv. 4.  The availability of this immunity depends on finding that Defendants’ actions \nwere “in good faith, upon either actual knowledge or information thought by them to be \nreliable[.]”  Id.  For two reasons, the case will not be dismissed on this basis.  First, \nDefendants have not shown that the immunity created by § 253B.23, subdiv. 4, applies to \nPlaintiffs’ procedural-due-process claim.  Second, regardless, the requisite “good faith” \nfinding would necessitate inquiring beyond the Amended Complaint’s allegations and \nconstruing those facts favorably to Defendants.  That would be inappropriate at the motion-\nto-dismiss stage on this record.  \n22 \n \n\nCASE 0:23-cv-00355-ECT-ECW   Doc. 47   Filed 09/14/23   Page 23 of 23\n \nORDER \nBased on the foregoing, and on all the files, records, and proceedings herein, IT IS \nORDERED THAT Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss [ECF No. 26] is GRANTED IN \nPART and DENIED IN PART as follows: \n1.
