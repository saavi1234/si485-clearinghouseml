See Bridgeman v. District Attorney for the \nSuffolk Dist., 476 Mass. 298, 319 n.18, 67 N.E.3d 673 (2017). \n \n2  We acknowledge the amicus brief submitted by the Committee for Public Counsel Services and Massachusetts \n  Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the amicus letter submitted by the Registry of Motor Vehicles. \n \n3  The defendant had been convicted of OUI in New York in 2006. \n \n \n4  The facts concerning the structure and operation of OAT, set forth in the judge’s decision on the defendant’s motion \n  to withdraw, are based on his findings in two memoranda of decision in the Ananias litigation as well as the joint \nstipulations of facts in that case, and the proceedings at the hearing on the defendant’s motion to withdraw. After \nremand by this court in Commonwealth v. Camblin, 471 Mass. 639, 640, 31 N.E.3d 1102 (2015), for evidentiary \nhearings and fact finding, this judge was appointed to preside over the consolidated Ananias litigation. The judge’s \nfindings in the Ananias litigation, following extensive evidentiary hearings involving approximately 600 defendants, \nare set forth in full in Ananias I and Ananias II. \n \n5  Melissa O’Meara became the supervising scientist at OAT in June 2011. In that role, she was responsible for the \n  day-to-day operation of the State police crime laboratory (crime lab), as well as for establishing policies and \nprocedures for breath test administration and training in accordance with the promulgated regulations. \n \n6  These incomplete worksheets were known as “failed worksheets.” \n \n \n7  The crime lab maintains a written policy, first promulgated on July 24, 2015, regarding discovery requests. At all \n  times relevant here, the policy indicated that all requests, whether through court orders, public records requests, or \nfrom prosecutors’ offices, were to be received, reviewed, and fulfilled by the crime lab’s case management unit \n(CMU). The CMU employed five full-time staff members who provided comprehensive records relating to firearms, \ndeoxyribonucleic acid, trace evidence, and other laboratory functions. The one exception to the policy was that OAT \nhandled its own discovery responses, without any assistance from the CMU. \n \n8  The possible categories of documents that could be requested were the “90-24 Record” (breath test data for \n  defendant); “Periodic Test Record” (test data from standard calibration tests initiated prior to defendant’s breath \ntest); “Calibration and Verification Records” (OAT testing data); and “Certification Summary” (containing OAT \ncertification, expiration date, and certifying chemist). \n  13 \n \n\n \n9  OAT employees, however, routinely appeared as witnesses in specific, more complex cases involving issues of blood \n  serum analysis and retrograde extrapolation (a mathematical calculation used to estimate a person’s BAC at a \nparticular point in time by working backward from the time the BAC was tested and factoring in rates of absorption \nand excretion). See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Colturi, 448 Mass. 809, 811, 864 N.E.2d 498 (2007); Commonwealth v. \nDouglas, 75 Mass. App. Ct. 643, 646, 915 N.E.2d 1111 (2009). These cases are rare and represent only a small \nfraction of prosecutions involving breath testing. \n \n10  As stated, the Camblin defendants challenged the technology used in the Alcotest 7110 MK III-C breathalyzer. See \n  Camblin, 471 Mass. at 640, 31 N.E.3d 1102. In Ananias I, the court expanded the scope of the reliability challenge \npermitted in Camblin to include the newest device, the Alcotest 9510, which began replacing the Alcotest 7110 in \nJune 2011. See Ananias I, supra. \n \n11  Ananias I originally stated that the Alcotest 9510 device was first used in June 2012, and therefore, the presumption \n  for tests began in June 2012. A subsequent order was issued to correct the findings of fact to reflect that the \nAlcotest 9510 device was in use beginning in June 2011. The parties have agreed that, consistent with the court’s \nreasoning, the presumption applies to tests performed starting in June 2011. \n \n12  When O’Meara was interviewed in conjunction with the EOPSS investigation, she explained that she considered \n  failed certification worksheets to be “data not reported” and, therefore, under OAT policy, not subject to discovery. \nShe also commented that, in her view, because no motorist had been subjected to breath testing with an instrument \nthat was put in the field without having been calibrated successfully, the failed calibration attempts had no \nprobative value, and thus appropriately were excluded from consideration in the certification analysis. \n \n13  American National Standards Institute – American Society for Quality. \n \n \n14  The parties agreed that the Commonwealth could seek to do so on a case-by-case basis for cases involving motor \n  vehicle homicide by OUI, G. L. c. 90, § 24G; OUI causing serious bodily injury, G. L. c. 90, § 24L; manslaughter by \nmotor vehicle, G. L. c. 265, § 13 1/2; and OUI as a fifth or greater offense, G. L. c. 90, § 24 (1) (a) (1). \n \n15  Because of the result we reach, we need not address the defendant’s arguments with respect to judicial estoppel \n  and waiver. \n \n16  The sentencing guidelines also note that a conviction of OUI, second offense, in violation of G. L. c. 90, § 24 (1) (a) \n  (1),  carries  a  mandatory  minimum  sentence  of  thirty  days  of  confinement.
