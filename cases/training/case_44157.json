    "summary": "<p>This case concerns allegations that the State of Montana&rsquo;s fossil fuel-based energy system caused and contributed to climate change in violation of the plaintiffs&rsquo; constitutional rights. On March 13, 2020, sixteen young people from Montana filed this lawsuit in Montana&rsquo;s First Judicial District Court of Lewis and Clark County. They sued the State of Montana, the Montana Governor, the Montana Department of Environmental Quality, the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, the Montana Department of Transportation, and the Montana Public Service Commission. Represented by Our Children&rsquo;s Trust, the Western Environmental Law Center, and private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief recognizing the unconstitutionality of the fossil fuel-based provisions of Montana&rsquo;s State Energy Policy, the aggregate actions taken by the defendants to support a fossil fuel-based energy system, and a provision of the Montana Environmental Policy Act that had been interpreted to mean that the state cannot consider climate change in any MEPA environmental reviews (MEPA Limitation). The plaintiffs also sought declaration that their constitutional right to a &ldquo;clean and healthful environment&rdquo; under the Montana state constitution included the right to a stable climate and was violated by the defendants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief enjoining the defendants from subjecting plaintiffs to these policies and ordering the defendants to prepare a statewide greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting and develop statewide GHG emission reduction plan. They also sought costs and reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees. The plaintiffs asserted that, by supporting a fossil fuel-based energy system through the above-mentioned laws and policies, the defendants violated their constitutional rights and the Public Trust Doctrine. The case was assigned to Judge Kathy Seeley.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants moved to dismiss the case on April 24, 2020. Judge Seeley granted in part and denied in part the defendants&rsquo; motion on August 4, 2021. The judge determined that the plaintiffs&rsquo; request for the court to order the defendants to develop a remedial plan, retain jurisdiction until the plan was completed, and appoint a special master if necessary to help review the plan exceeded the court&rsquo;s authority under the political question doctrine. However, Judge Seeley allowed the plaintiffs&rsquo; remaining requests to go forward.</p>\r\n<p>For the next year and a half, the parties engaged in discovery. On February 1, 2023, the defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. In the following months, actions taken by the Montana legislature shook things up in court. On March 16, 2023, the state legislature repealed the Montana State Energy Policy. The defendants subsequently filed a motion to partially dismiss the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims regarding the Montana State Energy Policy for mootness on March 31, 2023. On May 10, 2023, the state legislature clarified the MEPA Limitation as explicitly prohibiting state agencies from considering GHG emissions and corresponding climate change impacts in MEPA reviews. Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 75-1-201(2)(a). On May 18, 2023, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the MEPA claims based on this clarification. The next day, the state legislature enacted a new MEPA provision eliminating any preventative or equitable remedies for MEPA litigants who raise GHG or climate change issues. Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 75-1-201(6)(a)(ii).</p>\r\n<p><br />On May 23, 2023, Judge Seeley granted the defendants&rsquo; motion to partially dismiss the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims involving the State Energy Policy due to mootness. However, she denied the defendants&rsquo; motion for summary judgment and their motion to dismiss the plaintiffs&rsquo; MEPA claims. The case then made history when the trial began on June 12, 2023, as the first climate litigation to reach trial.</p>\r\n<p>In a landmark opinion issued on August 14, 2023, Judge Seeley ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on all remaining claims. Judge Seeley held that the plaintiffs have a fundamental constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment, &ldquo;which includes climate as part of the environmental life-support system.&rdquo; Further, Judge Seeley permanently enjoined and invalidated as unconstitutional the MEPA Limitation and equitable relief restriction. Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 75-1-201(2)(a), (6)(a)(ii). Judge Seeley reasoned that by prohibiting analysis of GHG emissions, corresponding climate impacts, and how additional GHG emissions will contribute to climate change or be consistent with the Montana Constitution, the MEPA Limitation violated the plaintiffs&rsquo; constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment. The plaintiffs were also awarded costs and attorney fees.</p>\r\n<p>On October 2, 2023, the defendants filed a notice of appeal in the Montana Supreme Court. On January 16, 2024, the Montana Supreme Court denied the defendants&rsquo; request to stay Judge Seeley&rsquo;s ruling while the Court considered the merits of the defendants&rsquo; appeal. The plaintiffs&rsquo; briefs were due on March 14, 2024. As of April 2, 2024, the defendants&rsquo; appeal was ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "On March 13, 2020, sixteen young people from Montana filed suit against the State of Montana and several state agencies (“defendants”) in state court.

In a landmark decision issued on August 14, 2023, Judge Kathy Seeley determined that the plaintiffs had a fundamental right to a stable climate under the Montana Constitution.

Youth Plaintiffs, Rikki Held; Lander B., by and through his guardian Sara Busse; Badge \n3  B., by and through his guardian Sara Busse; Sariel S., by and through her guardian Cristen \n4  Twoteeth; Kian T., by and through his guardian Todd Tanner; Georgianna F., by and \n5  through her guardian Douglas Fisher; Kathryn Grace S., by and through her guardian Erik \n6  Gibson-Snyder; Eva L., by and through her guardian Mark Lighthiser; Mika K., by and \n7  through his guardian Rachel Kantor; Olivia V., by and through her guardian Lynn Purl; \n8  Jeffrey K., by and through his guardian Laura King; Nathaniel K., by and through his \n9  guardian Laura King; Claire V., by and through her guardian Michael Vlases; Ruby D., by \n10  and through her guardian Shane Doyle; Lilian D., by and through her guardian Shane \n11  Doyle; and Taleah H., by and through her guardian Cesar Hernández, (collectively, “Youth \n12  Plaintiffs”), bring this action against Defendants, State of Montana, Governor Steve \n13  Bullock, Montana Department of Environmental Quality, Montana Department of Natural \n14  Resources and Conservation, Montana Department of Transportation, and Montana Public \n15  Service  Commission  (collectively  “Defendants”)  in  their  official  capacities,  and \n16  respectfully allege as follows:  \n17  NATURE OF THE ACTION \n18  2.  The Youth Plaintiffs to this proceeding are children and youth in Montana, between the \n19  ages of two (2) and eighteen (18), who have been and will continue to be harmed by the \n20  dangerous impacts of fossil fuels and the climate crisis. Children are uniquely vulnerable \n21  to the consequences of the climate crisis, which harms Youth Plaintiffs’ physical and \n22  psychological  health  and  safety,  interferes  with  family  and  cultural  foundations  and \n23  integrity, and causes economic deprivations. The climate crisis is degrading and depleting \n  1 \n\n \n1  Montana’s unique and precious environment and natural resources, which the Youth \n2  Plaintiffs depend on for their safety and survival. Because of their unique vulnerabilities \n3  and age, Youth Plaintiffs are disproportionately harmed by the climate crisis and face life-\n4  long hardships. Instead of using governmental authority to exacerbate the existing dangers \n5  and risks of harm to these children, Defendants must use their existing authorities to take \n6  science-based actions to reduce their risk of harm.  \n7  3.  Defendants are governmental entities that have created and implemented a long-standing \n8  fossil-fuel based state energy system that contributes to dangerous climate disruption in \n9  violation of Youth Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights as guaranteed under Article II, Section \n10  3; Article II, Section 4; Article II, Section 15; Article II, Section 17; Article IX, Section 1; \n11  Article IX, Section 3 of the Montana Constitution; and the Public Trust Doctrine.  \n12  4.  Youth Plaintiffs bring this case to challenge the constitutionality of Montana’s fossil-fuel \n13  based State Energy Policy, which is codified in law, Mont. Code Ann. § 90-4-1001(c)-(g) \n14  (“State  Energy  Policy”),  as  well  as  the  Climate  Change  Exception  in  the  Montana \n15  Environmental  Policy  Act  (“MEPA”),  Mont.  Code  Ann.  §  75-1-201(2)(a)  (“Climate \n16  Change Exception”). A controversy lies in the ongoing implementation of the State Energy \n17  Policy and the Climate Change Exception to MEPA, which are harming these Youth \n18  Plaintiffs and infringing on their constitutional rights. \n19  5.  The purpose of the Montana Constitution, as set out in its Preamble, is not just to benefit \n20  Montana’s present generations of children and youth, but future generations as well:  \n21  We the people of Montana grateful to God for the quiet beauty of our state, \nthe grandeur of our mountains, the vastness of our rolling plains, and \n22  desiring to improve the quality of life, equality of opportunity and to secure \nthe blessings of liberty for this and future generations do ordain and \n23  establish this constitution. \n  Montana Constitution, Preamble (emphasis added). \n  2 \n\n \n1  6.  Moreover,  the  Constitution,  through  Article  II,  Section  15,  explicitly  extends  all \n2  constitutional rights to children and youth.  \n3  7.  The  threats  posed  by  fossil  fuels  and  the  climate  crisis  are  existential.  Science  is \n4  unequivocal that dangerous climate change is upon us and is occurring due to human \n5  activities, primarily from the extraction and burning of fossil fuels. Additionally, while \n6  forests have the potential to sequester significant amounts of carbon dioxide (“CO ”), \n2\n7  current forestry practices and activities are not maximizing the sequestration potential of \n8  forests and are resulting in significant greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. The release of \n9  anthropogenic  GHGs  into  the  atmosphere  is  already  triggering  a  host  of  adverse \n10  consequences  in  Montana,  including  dangerously  increasing  temperatures,  changing \n11  precipitation patterns, increasing droughts and extreme weather events, increasing the \n12  frequency and severity of wildfires, increasing glacial melt, and causing numerous adverse \n13  health risks, especially to children.  \n14  8.  Although Defendants know that Youth Plaintiffs are living under dangerous climatic \n15  conditions that create an unreasonable risk of harm, they continue to act affirmatively to \n16  exacerbate the climate crisis. Youth Plaintiffs, most of whom cannot vote, therefore seek \n17  this  Court’s  judgment  and  redress.  Youth  Plaintiffs  first  seek  a  declaration  of  their \n18  constitutional rights, the constitutionality of the State Energy Policy and the Climate \n19  Change Exception to MEPA, and the liability and duties of the government Defendants. If \n20  awarded declaratory relief, these children seek an equitable order directing Defendants to \n21  cease  and  reform  their  unconstitutional  conduct  and  prepare  a  remedial  plan  of  the \n22  government’s own devising, consistent with its authorities and the Court’s declaration of \n23  law, to bring the state energy system into constitutional compliance. Where the political \n  3 \n\n \n1  majority places these children in harm’s way and at substantial risk to their lives and \n2  security, Youth Plaintiffs are dependent on the judiciary to vindicate and protect their \n3  fundamental and inalienable constitutional rights. \n4  9.  Some of this State’s and the nation’s landmark constitutional rulings have approved \n5  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief,  including  remedial  plans,  to  remedy  systemic \n6  constitutional  violations  like  those  at  issue  here.  For  example,  in  Columbia  Falls \n7  Elementary School Dist. No. 6 v. State, 2005 MT 69, 326 Mont. 304, 109 P.3d 257, schools \n8  on behalf of children called upon the courts to reform pervasive deficiencies in Montana’s \n9  system of funding public elementary and secondary schools. See also Helena Elementary \n10  School Dist. No. 1 v. State, (1989), 236 Mont. 44, 769 P.2d 684. Similarly, federal courts \n11  have declared unconstitutional systemic racial injustice in school systems, Brown v. Bd. of \n12  Educ., 349 U.S. 294 (1955), government-sanctioned segregated public housing systems, \n13  Hills  v.  Gautreaux,  425  U.S.  284  (1976),  and  cruel  and  unusual  conditions  across \n14  California’s state prison system, Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493 (2011).  \n15  10. Here too, because Defendants have used their governmental authority to create a state \n16  energy system that causes unparalleled harms to Montana’s children and youth, it is \n17  incumbent on the courts to bring that system into constitutional compliance. As Delegate \n18  Aronow stated during Montana’s 1972 constitutional convention: “The Constitution is, true \n19  enough, the framework of government, but on the other hand, it is a last bulwark and \n20  protection that the people have.”1   \n21 \n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n1  Montana  Constitutional  Convention  1971-1972  Verbatim  Transcript  Vol.  IV,  at  1069  (Mar.  1,  1972), \nhttps://courts.mt.gov/portals/189/library/mt_cons_convention/vol4.pdf. \n  4 \n\n \n1  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2  11. This Court has original jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Article II, Section 16, and \n3  Article VII, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution and pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. § 3-\n4  5-302.   \n5  12. This Court has jurisdiction to grant declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to the \n6  Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, Mont. Code Ann. §§ 27-8-101, et seq. (“UDJA”) and \n7  §§ 27-19-101, et seq., as well as the general equitable powers of this Court. Pursuant to the \n8  UDJA, this Court “shall have power to declare rights, status, and other legal relations” and \n9  this is “whether or not further relief is or could be claimed” in this action. Mont. Code Ann. \n10  § 27-8-201. \n11  13. Venue in this action is proper in this Court pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. § 25-2-126(1) and \n12  § 25-2-117. This is an action against the State of Montana, against officers and agencies of \n13  the state in their official capacities, and one or more of the Youth Plaintiffs reside in Lewis \n14  and Clark County. \n15  PARTIES \n16  PLAINTIFFS \n17  14. Plaintiff Rikki Held is 18 years old and is from Broadus, Montana where she lives with \n18  her family on their 7,000 acre-ranch. Her family’s livelihood largely depends upon the \n19  cattle they raise on the ranch and sell, as well as growing and harvesting a variety of crops. \n20  Rikki’s access to and enjoyment of the outdoors, including camping and backpacking, are \n21  central  to  her  health  and  foundational  to  her  family.  Climate  disruption  is  already \n22  threatening Rikki’s home, family, community, and way of life.  \n23  15. The Powder River runs through Rikki’s family ranch and Rikki’s family has water rights \nto the river. Due to changes in the climate there is increased variability in the water levels \n  5 \n\n \n1  in the river. In 2007 the river dried up. In the spring of 2017, abnormally high temperatures \n2  linked to the climate crisis caused the frozen river to melt at a rapid rate and flood. The \n3  water flooded Rikki’s family property and nearly flooded her house. Approximately 20 \n4  feet of river bank was lost in the overflow and more has eroded since then. In 2011, a few \n5  young bulls on the ranch were stranded at a bend in the river on a piece of ice when a \n6  channel flooded. The young bulls were unable to cross to safe land, and one bull died. \n7  Rikki’s father operated a log skidder to wade through 4-feet of water and help provide \n8  alfalfa to save the cattle, placing his own life at risk.    \n9  16. Rikki and her family depend upon an abundant snowfall in the winter, which melts and \n10  fills up the reservoirs on the ranch to water the cattle all summer. However, due to climate \n11  disruption, the snow does not last throughout the winter. The lack of snow means there is \n12  no spring runoff that Rikki’s family can rely on to water their livestock. The variant \n13  temperatures and rapidly melting snow quickly freeze and Rikki’s fields are then covered \n14  in ice. The ice is incredibly dangerous; cattle slip and fall on the ice, breaking their hips or \n15  aborting  their  calves.  These  injuries  to  cattle  greatly  affect  Rikki  and  her  family’s \n16  livelihood because they lose profits when any calf, cow, or bull is injured or dies. Rikki’s \n17  family has already experienced a loss in profits and Rikki is afraid of the worsening \n18  economic hardship her family will face if the climate crisis is not addressed.   \n19  17. Climate change has intensified extreme weather events in the Powder River County area. \n20  For example, a severe hail storm in or around July 2019 destroyed parts of Rikki’s ranch, \n21  including her home, and the second cutting of the alfalfa crop was devastated.  \n22  18. Rikki’s family hunts deer and elk on the ranch, which they freeze and eat throughout the \n23  year. Due to rising temperatures and drought conditions, elk range and herd behaviors have \n  6 \n\n \n1  changed and it has become more difficult for Rikki’s family to hunt deer and elk on the \n2  ranch. Elk herd ranges now extend past the outskirts of the ranch, causing significant \n3  damage to the interior ranch, including fences and hay crops. The elk migrate down to the \n4  meadows earlier in the year because the grass dries in the hills, and the elk then compete \n5  with the cattle and destroy crops on Rikki’s ranch. The rising temperatures in Montana \n6  have caused an increase in Bluetongue Virus, a viral disease of ruminants transmitted by \n7  small biting midges, or Culicoides. The first severe frost of the year destroys the biting \n8  midges and abruptly ends the spread of disease for the year; however, such disease-carrying \n9  insects are surviving due to warmer winters. Rikki and her family frequently find diseased \n10  white-tailed deer and carcasses on her ranch due to Bluetongue, which could be transmitted \n11  if eaten. Likewise, white pine weevils are surviving in the warmer temperatures and are \n12  killing the pine trees on Rikki’s ranch.  \n13  19. There have been a number of wildfires on the ranch. In or around the summer of 2012, a \n14  large wildfire swept the ranch and burned approximately 70 miles of area powerlines \n15  causing Rikki and her family lost electricity and power for approximately one month. Rikki \n16  and her family’s cattle suffered because of the fire; many lost a significant amount of \n17  weight and several starved to death, causing Rikki’s family financial losses that year. The \n18  smoke was particularly bad, and Rikki was forced to remain inside. Broadus has recorded \n19  some of the worst air quality in Montana, as well as the nation, in significant part due to \n20  the  fossil  fuels  development  and  combustion  that  happens  in  the  areas  surrounding \n21  Broadus. \n22  20. Rikki feels a heavy burden as a result of the climate crisis. She experiences stress and \n23  despair when thinking about how the State of Montana has known about climate disruption \n  7 \n\n \n1  for decades and yet has chosen to continue to act in a way that threatens her home and \n2  property, her family’s livelihood, and infringes upon her constitutional rights and future.  \n3  21. Plaintiffs Lander B. and Badge B. are 15 and 12 years old, respectively, and live in \n4  Kalispell, Montana. Hunting and fishing are an integral part of Lander and Badge’s cultural \n5  heritage and community, as well as an important food source – Lander, Badge, and their \n6  family depend on the food they hunt and fish for as their source of meat and protein. Their \n7  access to an important food source, and a cultural and familial tradition, is inhibited due to \n8  the climate crisis.  \n9  22. Lander and Badge are also avid fishermen and catch cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, bull \n10  trout, and other fish in Montana. Their ability to fish is adversely impacted as the climate \n11  crisis causes abnormally low instream water levels and high water temperatures, which \n12  harm fish and decrease their population. Climate disruption has also caused the closure of \n13  certain fisheries; Lander and Badge recall closures on the Flathead River and Blackfoot \n14  River, among others, which have prohibited them from fishing. Their ability to raft on \n15  rivers, including the Flathead, Blackfoot, and Smith Rivers, has also been restricted, and \n16  in some cases made impossible, due to low instream water levels.  \n17  23. Hunting is an important part of Lander and Badge’s family life, identity, and culture. \n18  Lander hunts for antelope, deer, birds, and other small and large wild game animals. \n19  However, the increasing heat, as well as the dry and smoke-filled air in the summer and \n20  fall, as a result of climate disruption, have diminished his opportunities to hunt in Montana. \n21  The extreme temperatures and smoke make hunting unbearable for Lander. The heat and \n22  drought conditions pose challenges for wildlife and alters their normal range, behavior, and \n23  populations, which makes hunting even more challenging. Badge hunts for upland birds, \n  8 \n\n \n1  which are a food source for him and his family. However, as climate disruption increases \n2  the frequency of extreme weather events and drought conditions, the birds are experiencing \n3  increased mortality rates, which limits Badge’s ability to hunt and cuts off a natural food \n4  source.   \n5  24. During the summer of 2018, a wildfire near Lander and Badge’s home forced their family \n6  to prepare to evacuate. While the wildfire ultimately spared their property, Lander and \n7  Badge fear that, as climate destabilization makes wildfires more frequent and destructive, \n8  their home could be damaged or destroyed, further threatening their safety and security. \n9  Due to climate change, the wildfire smoke in Kalispell, and in other parts of Montana where \n10  Badge recreates, makes it difficult for Badge to breath, triggers a cough, and irritates his \n11  eyes, which negatively impacts his health and well-being. Lander has seasonal pollen \n12  allergies, which will worsen with the increased pollen count and a changing climate.  \n13  25. Badge is named after Badger-Two Medicine, an area where he frequently recreates and \n14  fishes,  and  feels  strongly  connected  to.  Severe  wildfires  in  Badger-Two  Medicine \n15  destroyed ancient White Pines and degraded areas significant to Badge and where he likes \n16  to visit and recreate. The devastation of Badger-Two Medicine, Badge’s namesake, was \n17  particularly distressing and had a profound emotional impact on Badge. Badge’s ability to \n18  enjoy and recreate in and around Montana’s forests, which is important for his health and \n19  foundational to his family, has been diminished as pine beetles infest and kill trees, \n20  decimating forests. Badge has even seen pine beetles on the trees while hiking in Montana’s \n21  forests. \n22  26. Lander cares deeply about protecting Montana’s environment, which is an integral part of \n23  his family traditions, culture, and identity. Witnessing the current impacts of the climate \n  9 \n\n \n1  crisis in Montana and in other parts of the world is traumatic for Lander. Badge is anxious \n2  when he thinks about the future that he, and his potential children, will inherit. Both Lander \n3  and Badge were plaintiffs in a 2011 constitutional climate case against the State of \n4  Montana, which was filed directly with the Montana Supreme Court. Following the \n5  Supreme Court’s directive, they are filing this case in the district court.2  \n6  27. Plaintiff Sariel S. is 17 years old and lives on the Flathead Indian Reservation. Sariel is a \n7  member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. Sariel’s family and community \n8  have a deep connection to the natural world, and have a body of knowledge about the \n9  environment  closely  tied  to  the  seasons,  locations,  and  environment.  This  body  of \n10  knowledge, as well as cultural practices and traditions, are passed on by Elders and family \n11  to Sariel so that her generation and future generations can continue her community’s \n12  spiritual, cultural, and familial traditions and ways of life.  \n13  28. Climate change is threatening Sariel’s culture, which is already in jeopardy and at risk of \n14  being lost. The environment is one of the remaining connections Sariel and her community \n15  have to their culture; Sariel is worried that her and her community’s activities, practices, \n16  and beliefs of cultural significance will be entirely lost if climate change continues. The \n17  threat of losing her community’s important connection to the environment and losing her \n18  culture because of climate change is extremely stressful on Sariel and her community.  \n19  29. The lack of winter snowpack in recent years, due to climate disruption, has harmed Sariel \n20  and her community on the Flathead Reservation. The Flathead Lake depends on the runoff \n21  from the snow but the lack of snow creates low water levels, which impacts Sariel’s \n22  aesthetic and recreational opportunities, and impacts her community’s ability to fish for \n23 \n                                                 \n2 Barhaugh et al., v. State of Montana, No. OP 11-0258 (June 15, 2011). \n  10 \n\n \n1  bull trout and rainbow trout. Snow is also a necessary component of certain traditional \n2  ceremonies, like Coyote Stories and Creation Stories. Sariel’s Elders are only able to share \n3  these stories when there is snow on the ground, but this winter season, and in recent winters, \n4  the snow has melted too quickly and this oral history thus cannot be shared with Sariel and \n5  the community. Climate change is impacting Sariel’s ability to partake in cultural and \n6  spiritual activities, central to her individual dignity.  \n7  30. There has been an increase in wildfires on the Flathead Reservation where Sariel lives, and \n8  she is forced to remain indoors when the smoke is concentrated in the area to preserve her \n9  overall health and safety.  \n10  31. Sariel’s family members hunt wild game on the Flathead Reservation, including bison. \n11  Sariel and her family rely on this food source for the rest of the year. Bison in particular, \n12  are a central part of her Salish and Kootenai cultural heritage and also a critical food source \n13  for Sariel and her community. Sariel and her family pick huckleberries, which they dry, \n14  freeze, and make into jam, syrup, and other foods, such as cheesecake for Sariel’s birthday. \n15  However, Sariel has to travel farther to pick huckleberries, and the huckleberry picking \n16  season has been pushed later into the year because the berries are not ripe due to fluctuating \n17  and extreme temperatures. Sariel is concerned that as the climate crisis worsens, traditional \n18  food sources and cultural practices may be lost with the declining access to bison, berries, \n19  and other foods.  \n20  32. Climate disruption has made it difficult for Sariel to learn and engage in traditional and \n21  cultural practices and customs that have been passed down for generations. The passing on \n22  of cultural knowledge is incredibly important to Sariel, and she is increasingly worried that \n23  the impacts of climate change are threatening her opportunity and right to learn these \n  11 \n\n \n1  practices so that she might carry them on. The climate crisis has a profound emotional and \n2  psychological impact on Sariel, who stresses about the impacts her community is facing \n3  and will face in the near future. Sariel is distraught when thinking about her future and if \n4  she will have one.  \n5  33. Plaintiff Kian T. is 14 years old and lives with his family on 27 acres in Bigfork, Montana. \n6  As the climate crisis causes warmer winters and increased insect activity, trees on his \n7  family’s property—including birch, spruce, aspen, cottonwood, and fir of various age \n8  classes—are dying with heightened frequency. Kian likes to recreate on the creek to which \n9  he and his family own water rights, and which borders his family’s property. The creek is \n10  primarily fed by snowmelt, but due to human-caused climate disruption there is earlier \n11  spring snowmelt in the surrounding mountains, which threatens the creek’s water supply \n12  in the summer and fall. Kian’s family property, where he lives and recreates, is directly \n13  harmed as a result of the climate crisis.  \n14  34. Kian is a passionate fly fisher; he has been fishing Montana’s lakes, ponds, and rivers since \n15  he was four years old. Fly fishing is a part of Kian’s cultural heritage and family traditions; \n16  his father has been fishing for over 50 years and Kian hopes that he will be able to preserve \n17  this tradition and fish for the next 50 years or more. However, such fishing opportunities \n18  are already diminishing. Kian especially enjoys fishing the Flathead and Missouri Rivers, \n19  where he catches rainbow and cutthroat trout. He was featured fishing in the 2019 fishing \n20  and hunting documentary, “In the Heart of the Rockies” on the Sportsman Channel. The \n21  warmer water temperatures, lower oxygen levels, and declining in-stream flows due to \n22  climate disruption are harming Montana’s rivers and fish. These climate impacts have \n23  decreased fishing opportunities for Kian as the rivers become warmer and hold less water \n  12 \n\n \n1  in the summer. He has had to cancel fishing trips due to warm water temperatures and low \n2  flows. Climate destabilization is thus restricting and infringing on Kian’s ability to fish.  \n3  35. Kian lives near Glacier National Park, which he enjoys visiting. Kian hopes to continue \n4  recreating in Glacier National Park, a place of significance to him, but the dead and dying \n5  forests,  melting  glaciers,  and  declining  snowpack  diminishes  these  experiences  and \n6  recreational opportunities. He is distressed that he will never be able to see the natural \n7  glaciers as they have historically existed, and as other generations experienced.  \n8  36. Increased smoke in the summer has impacted Kian’s ability to play soccer, fish, hike, camp, \n9  and otherwise recreate outside, activities which are central to his health and foundational \n10  to his family. The smoke makes Kian feel sick, and he is forced to seek refuge inside. \n11  During the summer of 2017, his family had to cancel a camping trip because the smoke \n12  conditions were so oppressive and dangerous.  \n13  37. Kian has a black belt in taekwondo, which is a discipline and practice he has trained in \n14  since the age of five. Kian is inspired and strives to live by the five taekwondo principles: \n15  courtesy,  integrity,  perseverance,  self-control,  and  indomitable  spirit—principles  that \n16  encourage him to be conscientious about the impact he has in the world. He has taken \n17  numerous steps in his personal life to conserve energy and natural resources in order to \n18  protect the planet for both his generation and future generations.  \n19  38. Plaintiff Georgianna F. (“Georgi”) is 17 years old and lives in Bozeman, Montana. Georgi \n20  is a competitive Nordic skier and she trains 11 months of the year and practices 15 hours \n21  each week, 7 days a week. She primarily trains for her competitions in Montana and has \n22  competed in Junior National competitions for the past three years.  \n23 \n  13 \n\n \n1  39. Georgi’s ability to compete and participate in Nordic skiing has been directly impacted by \n2  climate disruption. With less snowfall in the winter, and the snow melting at rapid rates, \n3  Georgi’s training season is curtailed and has overall shortened in length. In recent years \n4  there has not been enough snow to groom trails or create tracks in the snow to Nordic ski \n5  race until January, although historically tracks were created in November. The lack of snow \n6  has inhibited Georgi’s ability to complete all her necessary and appropriate training and \n7  hinders her ability to continue to compete at a high level, which adversely impacts her \n8  health and mental well-being.    \n9  40. In the summer, when Georgi trains for Nordic skiing and winter competition, the wildfire \n10  smoke limits her ability to train outdoors, which is important for the sport. Practices in the \n11  summer have been cancelled or curtailed due to smoke from wildfires in Montana. The \n12  smoke makes it so Georgi cannot fully breathe or train at a high intensity level; she is \n13  increasingly worried about the long-term effects that the exposure to heavy smoke while \n14  training has on her health and respiratory system. In or around August 2017, while training \n15  in Canmore, Alberta, Canada, Georgi had to wear a mask to protect herself from the ash \n16  that fell from the sky.  \n17  41. Georgi  also  enjoys  paddleboarding,  backpacking,  hiking,  and  other  activities  in  the \n18  outdoors. She has noticed that there is less flow in the local rivers, in particular the Smith, \n19  Flathead, and Missouri Rivers, and at times these rivers have been closed due to low water \n20  levels,  which  inhibits  her  access  and  restricts  activities  important  to  her  health  and \n21  foundational to her family life. Additionally, due to less water flows, the season for \n22  recreating on the river is shortened and it is increasingly difficult for Georgi and her family \n23  to receive a permit to recreate on the Smith River, further inhibiting access. At times, even \n  14 \n\n \n1  with a permit, Georgi and her family have been forced to cancel float trips on the river \n2  because there is not enough water due to climate disruption, thus impacting important \n3  familial activities.   \n4  42. Georgi sometimes has feelings of despair and hopelessness; she has invested years into a \n5  snow-based sport, but understands that snow and the sport may not exist in her future.  \n6  43. Plaintiff Kathryn Grace S. (“Grace”) is 16 years old and resides in Missoula, Montana. \n7  Grace and her family kayak and recreate on the Clark Fork River, which is near her house, \n8  and other nearby rivers and creeks. However, due to higher temperatures, decreasing \n9  snowpack, and drought, the water level in the river is sometimes so low during the summer \n10  months that it is impossible to float on the river. During the summer of 2013, Grace and \n11  her family had to drag her raft down the river because it ran aground due to low water \n12  levels. Grace’s access to the river is also impeded when the water level rises too high, \n13  which can occur when unusually warm springs cause rapid snowmelt, because rafting, \n14  kayaking, floating, and other activities become too dangerous. Flood warnings have \n15  become more common due to the dangerously high water levels in the spring, caused by \n16  unusually warm weather causing rapid snowmelt. Because of the climate crisis, Grace’s \n17  access to the Clark Fork River for recreational activities has been increasingly limited and \n18  impaired, thus limiting her ability to enjoy activities important to her health and family.  \n19  44. In the summers of 2017 and 2018, the smoke from wildfires impacted Grace’s ability to go \n20  outside and enjoy outdoor activities, and placed her safety, health, and well-being at risk. \n21  The smoke triggered coughing, as well as throat irritation. The extreme heat and wildfire \n22  smoke adversely impact Grace’s ability to play competitive soccer and has led to fewer \n23  soccer practices. \n  15 \n\n \n1  45. Witnessing climate change impacts occur around her is devastating emotionally to Grace \n2  and she is anxious about her future and fearful that her generation may not survive the \n3  climate crisis. Grace has doubts about whether she would want to have her own children \n4  given her anxieties about the future. Grace participates in Students Against Violating the \n5  Environment (“SAVE”), a school club, and participated in a campaign to eliminate single-\n6  use plastic from the cafeteria at her school. Grace also launched and led a service project \n7  in her community to eliminate disposable containers at restaurants. Grace feels that she \n8  must do these activities to protect her environment but knows that her state government \n9  also needs to stop its actions that are perpetuating the use of fossil fuels.  \n10  46. Plaintiff Eva L. is 14 years old and is based in Livingston, Montana, just north of \n11  Yellowstone National Park. Eva enjoys learning about nature and travels with her family, \n12  exploring national parks and public lands. Eva enjoys many activities outdoors, which are \n13  central to her health and foundational to her family, including backpacking, climbing, and \n14  riding bikes; she also enjoys swimming and rafting on the Yellowstone River. \n15  47. In the summer of 2017, wildfire smoke from several fires in Montana created very poor air \n16  quality in Livingston, harming Eva’s health and security. During that time, from June to \n17  October,  Eva  was  unable  to  enjoy  the  high-intensity  activities  she  normally  enjoys \n18  outdoors, which are an integral part of her lifestyle and family life. Eva often felt ill that \n19  summer, as the thick layer of smoke lingered in Livingston. She suffered from eye and \n20  nose irritation, a sore throat, and headaches.  \n21  48. In or around September 2017, Eva and her family traveled to Glacier National Park for a \n22  family vacation. Eva and her family were unable to hike as planned or enjoy the park due \n23  to the thick smoke that permeated the area. The smoke was so bad that the glaciers were \n  16 \n\n \n1  not visible, even from just a few hundred yards away. Eva found it difficult to breathe while \n2  at Glacier National Park and she and her family ended the trip early to escape the smoke \n3  and protect their health and safety.  \n4  49. In May 2018, all of the rivers, tributaries, and streams near Eva’s home flooded when \n5  higher than average temperatures rapidly melted the snowpack – an event that was called \n6  “the Tsunami of 2018.” The Shields River in Shields Valley flooded and the bridge that \n7  crosses the Shields River near Eva’s house was severely damaged. Ultimately, the local \n8  government declared the bridge unsafe for vehicle use and condemned it, even though it \n9  was Eva and her family’s primary route from their home to the city of Livingston. Eva and \n10  her family would drive one car to the bridge from their home, walk across the bridge, and \n11  then drive their other car parked on the other side of the river into town. When the fuel had \n12  run out in their vehicle, Eva and her family biked across the bridge to their home, which \n13  was an approximately 2-mile bike ride. Park County built a temporary bridge for the \n14  residents to use during construction of the new bridge, which was expected to be completed \n15  before spring runoff in May 2019. Unexpected, early season snow melt in March of 2019, \n16  due  to  abnormally  warm  temperatures,  completely  destroyed  the  temporary  bridge, \n17  washing the bridge planks downriver. Eva and her family were forced to drive an additional \n18  45 minutes around the river to get to town each day. This period of time was incredibly \n19  stressful on Eva and her family. Because of their inability to access the bridge and town, \n20  and increased hardship and stress in their everyday life, Eva and her family made the \n21  decision to relocate; they sold their home and moved in with Eva’s grandparents in \n22  Livingston. Eva is anxious about how, as the climate crisis impacts worsen, her family and \n23  community will be able to adapt to the devastation of public resources and infrastructure.  \n  17 \n\n \n1  50. During the summer of 2016 abnormally high air temperatures and historically low flows \n2  allowed a parasite to grow in the Yellowstone River, which caused kidney disease in \n3  Yellowstone cutthroat and rainbow trout and other fish, and killed tens of thousands of \n4  fish. Over 180 miles of the Yellowstone River were closed for several weeks, prohibiting \n5  Eva and her family from accessing the river to swim, float, raft, or let her dog play near the \n6  river. These are traditional activities for Eva, her friends, and her family, central to her \n7  identity, well-being, and family foundations.  \n8  51. Eva is increasingly anxious about the climate change impacts she and her family are \n9  experiencing.  She  is  distressed  that  the  climate  crisis  will  worsen  if  action  is  not \n10  immediately taken.  \n11  52. Plaintiff Mica K. is 11 years old and resides in Missoula, Montana. Mica has experienced \n12  stress over the impacts of the climate crisis since he was three, when he saw the film \n13  Chasing Ice. Mica participates in climate strikes on most Fridays, writes to elected \n14  officials, and participates in other acts of civic engagement because he knows Montana \n15  must stop promoting fossil fuel projects and address the climate crisis.  \n16  53. Rising temperatures due to climate disruption have made it difficult for Mica to recreate \n17  outdoors and participate in the activities that he enjoys, which are important to his health \n18  and development, and overall well-being. Mica suffers from headaches, fatigue, and eye \n19  irritation because of the increase in wildfires and smoke, direct impacts to his physical \n20  health and safety, as well as the indirect psychological impacts, and behavioral issues when \n21  he is required to stay indoors during the summer. Wildfires and smoke during the summer \n22  of 2017 forced him to stay inside for six weeks in August and September. The lengthening \n23  wildfire season and the resulting smoke have caused Mica’s school to cancel recess for \n  18 \n\n \n1  approximately three weeks in 2017, forcing Mica and his classmates to remain inside due \n2  to dangerous levels of smoke and pollution. Because of where Mica lives, in a valley, the \n3  airshed is particularly susceptible to air pollution such as smoke, thus further exacerbating \n4  the harm to Mica from wildfire smoke.  \n5  54. On August 1, 2019, a forest fire started approximately one mile away from Mica’s house. \n6  Mica watched the helicopters and firefighters work to prevent the fire from spreading. The \n7  event was distressing to Mica and he feared that the fire would destroy his home. Mica is \n8  anxious that, as the climate crisis worsens he will lose his family home to climate \n9  disruption.   \n10  55. Mica trains for and runs half marathons in the spring and summer months in Montana with \n11  his family. The wildfire smoke makes Mica feel sick when he runs outside, and he becomes \n12  lethargic and suffers from headaches. During a trail running class in the summer of 2017, \n13  Mica became ill due to the smoke and he could not participate in the remainder of the \n14  classes for that season. Mica and his family used to go backpacking and camping in late \n15  summer, recreational activities that are foundational to their family and lifestyle, but now \n16  avoid camping or other outdoor activities in August and September because of the smoke \n17  and its negative effect on Mica’s health and safety.  \n18  56. Mica and his dad and brother fish in the Blackfoot river and catch cutthroat, rainbow, and \n19  brown trout. In the spring, the Blackfoot, Clark Fork, and Bitterroot Rivers now regularly \n20  flood at frequencies not historically seen due to the abnormally warm spring temperatures \n21  and increased spring rainfall, causing rapid snowmelt and increased runoff. This prevents \n22  Mica and his family from fishing and obstructs their access of the river. Fishing restrictions \n23  in middle-late summer limit the hours during the day that Mica is able to fish due to the \n  19 \n\n \n1  low water levels and warm water temperatures, which deprive the fish of needed oxygen, \n2  putting them under stress, resulting in an increase in fish mortality.  \n3  57. Mica has seen how the glaciers and lakes have been impacted by climate disruption first \n4  hand in Glacier National Park and this has a profound emotional impact on Mica. This \n5  summer he is planning a backpacking trip to Glacier National Park in order to hike up to a \n6  glacier and see one up close before it melts further and eventually disappears. Mica’s \n7  favorite animal is the pika; however, as the number of pikas continue to decline, it will be \n8  increasing difficult for Mica to see or hear pikas while recreating outdoors. \n9  58. Plaintiff Olivia V. is 16 years old and lives in Missoula, Montana. Olivia takes numerous \n10  steps to minimize her impact on the environment. She has been actively involved with the \n11  local Sunrise Movement and helped organize a climate strike in Missoula in or around \n12  September 2019. \n13  59. The summers in Missoula are increasingly hot and smoky. Olivia has exercise induced \n14  asthma, which she was diagnosed with at the age of 13. Olivia is particularly vulnerable to \n15  the smoke-filled air because of her asthma. When the air is filled with wildfire smoke, \n16  Olivia feels like she is suffocating if she spends more than five minutes outside. Olivia’s \n17  throat and lungs are irritated by the smoke, and she often suffers from a cough during these \n18  conditions. Olivia feels as if her lungs are closing up. The higher temperatures and smoke \n19  have had an impact on her asthma. Olivia was prescribed an inhaler at the age of 13 but, \n20  over the years, her asthma attacks have become more frequent and severe. Due to the \n21  smoke, Olivia is forced to stay inside and has had to eliminate and reduce outdoor activities \n22  that she enjoys, such as hiking, biking, and swimming. Missoula has particularly poor air \n23  quality, which only exacerbates Olivia’s respiratory health issues. Because of the smoke-\n  20 \n\n \n1  filled air and her asthma, Olivia has been forced to leave Montana entirely in past summers, \n2  most recently in 2018, in search of cleaner air.  \n3  60. Olivia also suffers from spring pollen allergies which has caused her eyes to swell shut, \n4  and her eyes are in pain for weeks at a time. Allergies first impacted Olivia at or around \n5  the age of 14, but have become progressively worse in recent years.  \n6  61. Olivia is profoundly impacted by the climate crisis emotionally and psychologically. She \n7  experiences bouts of depression when she thinks about the dire projections of the future, \n8  and doubts whether society and civilization will even exist. Olivia values her family and \n9  would like to have and raise children of her own, but she questions whether this is even an \n10  option in a world devastated by the climate crisis. She fears that if she has children they, \n11  or their children, would suffer or starve. Imagining the future that she will inherit, or that \n12  her children would live in, and the current suffering that the climate crisis is already causing \n13  her and others is a heavy burden for her to carry, and Olivia feels heartbroken and \n14  desperate.   \n15  62. Plaintiffs Jeffrey K. and Nathaniel (“Nate”) K. live in Montana City, Montana. Jeffrey is \n16  six years old and Nate is two years old. Jeffrey has a pulmonary sequestration. As a result, \n17  Jeffrey is uniquely susceptible to respiratory complications, such as infections. Nate also \n18  has respiratory issues and, at the age of two, is sick frequently. Nate has gone to the \n19  emergency room twice due to difficulty breathing. Both Jeffrey and Nate, given their \n20  unique lung and health conditions, are especially vulnerable to poor air quality, such as \n21  smoke-filled air caused by wildfires. Climate disruption is increasing the length and \n22  severity of Montana’s wildfire season which poses a threat to Jeffrey and Nate’s health, \n23  especially given their young age and respiratory health conditions.  \n  21 \n\n \n1  63. As a result of Jeffrey and Nate’s unique vulnerabilities and sensitivities to poor air quality \n2  and wildfire smoke, their family has been forced to make changes in their daily activities. \n3  Jeffrey and Nate are kept indoors when the air is filled with wildfire smoke and they are \n4  unable to go hiking, camping, or participate in other outdoor activities that are central to \n5  their lifestyle, family, and overall well-being. This is difficult because Jeffrey and Nate \n6  both enjoy playing outside and being in Montana’s beautiful natural environment. \n7  64. Plaintiff Claire V. is 17 years old and lives in Bozeman, Montana. Claire is very active in \n8  her community and has worked on a number of projects to promote reliable and clean \n9  energy. For example, in middle school Claire raised $120,000 to put solar panels on her \n10  school and other municipal buildings in Bozeman and she is the president of her high \n11  school’s Solar Club. Claire is also on the Bozeman Climate Team, where she is working \n12  with stakeholders develop a climate plan for the city.  \n13  65. Claire works as a ski instructor at Big Sky Resort. However, her ability to earn money is \n14  jeopardized by climate disruption, which is causing a decrease in Montana’s winter \n15  snowpack and, consequently, fewer visitors and decreased opportunities for work. If there \n16  is not enough snow and too few visitors, Claire is sent home without working her scheduled \n17  shift.  \n18  66. Claire is an avid road cyclist and enjoys participating in long distance bike rides across the \n19  country. In the summer of 2017, she cycled around Montana and in 2018 rode her bike \n20  across the United States. Claire has biked through Glacier National Park, where she was \n21  dismayed  to  see  firsthand  the  receding  glaciers.  The  extreme  heat  and  increasing \n22  temperatures in the summer makes it harder for Claire to bike, especially long distances. \n23  Claire recalls that, in one instance while cycling, the extreme heat melted the asphalt. \n  22 \n\n \n1  67. Claire is on her school’s cross-country team and trains year-round. As a result of climate \n2  destabilization, the increasing heat and smoke from wildfires in the summer and fall, have \n3  altered her training schedule – some of her practices have been cancelled while others have \n4  been moved entirely indoors. The heat and smoke make it harder for Claire to train and \n5  compete at a high level.  \n6  68. Bozeman Creek, which Claire’s family has water rights to, runs through Claire’s property \n7  and is Claire and her family’s water source. She feels threatened and is concerned that with \n8  melting glaciers, declining snowpack, and increasing summer drought conditions—all as a \n9  result of climate disruption—water scarcity will impact her and her family in the future.  \n10  69. Despite Claire’s work to raise money to install solar panels on her school, Montana law \n11  limits the size of solar panel arrays. Consequently, Claire’s school is forced to continue to \n12  buy energy instead of using the cheaper energy generated by solar panels on site. As a \n13  result, her school has fewer financial resources to spend on programs, teachers, and \n14  facilities  and,  therefore,  Claire’s  educational  opportunities  have  been  diminished  by \n15  Montana’s efforts to hinder large-scale solar arrays and instead, promote fossil fuels as an \n16  energy source. \n17  70. Plaintiff Ruby D. is 11 years old, and Plaintiff Lilian D. is 9 years old. Ruby and Lilian \n18  reside in Bozeman, Montana. Ruby and Lilian are of Crow descent and a member of the \n19  Crow Tribe of Montana—Ruby’s Crow name is Biachəgata, which means “pretty girl,” \n20  and Lilian’s Crow name is Malesch, which means “loved by many.” Many of Ruby and \n21  Lilian’s family members live on the Crow Reservation, where they visit during the summer \n22  and for special occasions and celebrations.  \n23 \n  23 \n\n \n1  71. Each year in August, Ruby, Lilian, and their family travel to Crow, Montana for Crow Fair, \n2  during which they engage in a number of traditional cultural and spiritual activities and \n3  practices, including Pow Wows, toymaking, horse-riding, dancing, story-telling, playing \n4  games, sleeping in a tipi, and eating traditional foods. Ruby is a jingle dress dancer and \n5  often dances at Crow Fair, and travels to jingle dress dance at different Pow Wows in the \n6  region. Lilian is a fancy shawl dancer and dances at Crow Fair and competes at different \n7  Pow Wows in the region. The past two Fairs have been abnormally wet, cold, and muddy, \n8  which makes it difficult to complete the dances and other events as planned—events and \n9  cultural practices that are central to their spirituality and individual dignity.  \n10  72. Ruby and Lilian pick wild chokecherries, and use the berries to make syrup. They also pick \n11  wild huckleberries, raspberries, Oregon grapes, and other wild fruits. They pick the berries \n12  before Crow Fair; however, recently they have experienced abnormal weather conditions \n13  and the berries and other fruits are not ripe. The increase in wildfires in Montana has \n14  restricted access to certain areas where they used to pick berries.  \n15  73. Ruby was diagnosed with asthma in 2015. She has had multiple asthma attacks since her \n16  diagnosis and has been prescribed an inhaler. As a result of her asthma, Ruby is uniquely \n17  vulnerable to the increased wildfire smoke in Montana due to climate change, which \n18  irritates her lungs and makes it more difficult for her to breathe and partake in physical \n19  activities such as sports, impacting her overall health and safety. \n20  74. Increasingly frequent and destructive wildfires have also diminished Lilian and Ruby’s \n21  ability to recreate in and enjoy Montana’s forests. Seeing dead and degraded forests, both \n22  due to wildfires and pine beetles, is distressing to Ruby. Wildfires also making it more \n23  difficult to engage in cultural practices, including building the tipis that are an integral part \n  24 \n\n \n1  of Ruby and Lilian’s experience at Crow Fair. The tipis can only be built out of lodgepole \n2  pine. However, once lodgepole pine trees have been exposed to heat from a wildfire it is \n3  no longer possible to peel the bark off the tree, which is necessary for constructing the tipi \n4  and to avoid damaging the tipi. As wildfires are increasingly common in Montana, it is \n5  becoming difficult to find lodgepole to build tipis and for Ruby and Lilian to engage in this \n6  cultural practice.  \n7  75. One of Ruby and Lilian’s favorite rivers is the Madison River, where they like to go rafting. \n8  At times, however, low water levels due to climate disruption cause her raft to get stuck \n9  and otherwise make rafting more challenging. Lilian and Ruby used to enjoy outdoor ice \n10  skating but, as a result of Montana’s warmer winters, the outdoor ice-skating rink has been \n11  closed more frequently because it is too warm for the ice to form.  \n12  76. Ruby and Lilian are aware that their cultural practices and individual dignity are worthy of \n13  protection. They advocate for their rights and for the environment by selling toys that they \n14  make,  and  donating  the  proceeds  to  support  different  advocacy  campaigns  and \n15  organizations that they care about but they know that they alone cannot protect their future \n16  and Lilian and Ruby need support from their state government.  \n17  77. Plaintiff Taleah H. is 16 years old and lives in Polson, Montana, on the Flathead Indian \n18  Reservation. Taleah enjoys ice skating on Flathead Lake; however, in 2019, she could not \n19  ice skate on the lake because rising temperatures due to climate destabilization prohibited \n20  a sufficient amount of ice from forming. The increase in wildfires near Taleah’s home, due \n21  to rising temperatures and an increase in drought conditions, has prohibited Taleah from \n22  recreating outdoors, including hiking and paddle boarding, and forced her to remain inside \n23 \n  25 \n\n \n1  for long periods of time during the summer due to poor air quality and to preserve her \n2  health.  \n3  78. Taleah and her mother participate in an annual Mother’s Day bike ride on Going-to-the-\n4  Sun Road in Glacier National Park. Taleah’s recreational, aesthetic, and family interests \n5  are being harmed as glaciers in the park recede, and are at risk of being lost forever due to \n6  climate change, which would fundamentally alter the nature of this annual bike ride.  \n7  79. Taleah lives on the Flathead Indian Reservation, near a bison range. Taleah fears that, as \n8  the climate crisis worsens, the increase in transmittable diseases between other wildlife and \n9  bison will increase and this resource, which she cares deeply about, will be lost. Taleah’s \n10  father hunts deer and elk, which is an important food source for Taleah and her family. As \n11  temperatures increase and viral diseases are more easily transmitted, this food source will \n12  be impacted.  \n13  80. Taleah’s ancestry is Taíno (an Indigenous Puerto Rican group). Taleah has plans to visit \n14  her father’s family in Puerto Rico, and immerse herself in her cultural and familial \n15  traditions. Taleah’s family, however, was impacted by Hurricane Maria, and Taleah \n16  experiences stress when thinking about their future and her ability to visit her family, which \n17  is important for her cultural and individual dignity.   \n18  81. All Youth Plaintiffs are adversely affected by the Defendants’ conduct in perpetuating a \n19  fossil fuel-based energy system that is disproportionately impacting children. \n20  DEFENDANTS \n21  82. Defendant State of Montana is the sovereign trustee over the Public Trust Resources \n22  within its domain, including the atmosphere (air), water, public lands, and fish and wildlife. \n23  As  a  sovereign  trustee,  Defendant  Montana  is  charged  with  protecting  Public  Trust \nResources from substantial impairment and alienation for the benefit of present and future \n  26 \n\n \n1  Montanans. Defendant Montana has a constitutional duty to maintain and improve a clean \n2  and healthful environment for present and future generations. The State of Montana, \n3  through its legislature and governor, enacted Montana’s State Energy Policy and MEPA \n4  Climate Change Exception. \n5  83. Defendant Governor Steve Bullock is sued in his official capacity as Governor of the State \n6  of Montana. Pursuant to the Montana Constitution, “the executive power is vested in the \n7  governor who shall see that the laws are faithfully executed.” Mont. Const. art. VI, § 4. \n8  Defendant  Bullock  has  supervisory  authority  over  the  principal  departments  of  the \n9  executive branch, which include all allocated executive and administrative offices, boards, \n10  bureaus, commissions, agencies and instrumentalities of the executive branch.3 Defendant \n11  Bullock directs departments’ implementation of policies and procedures to meet the \n12  objectives of the State Energy Policy. Mont. Const. art. VI, § 8.  \n13  84. Defendant  Bullock  holds  cabinet  meetings,  communicates  with  other  state  officers, \n14  oversees budget expenditures, and has authority to issue executive orders. By and through \n15  his actions, Defendant Bullock implements and directs implementation of the State Energy \n16  Policy.   \n17  85. Defendant Bullock has used the authority of his office, and has directed the Defendants, to \n18  facilitate, and authorize activities resulting in dangerous levels of CO  and GHGs, thus \n2\n19  causing, contributing to, and exacerbating the climate crisis and infringing on Youth \n20  Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. He has taken these actions while acknowledging the \n21  dangers of climate change, simultaneously telling the public that “climate change poses a \n22  serious threat” to Montana and that the “irreversible impacts of a changing climate require \n23 \n                                                 \n3 Mont. Const. art. VI, § 7 (“except for the office of the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, attorney \ngeneral, superintendent of public instruction, and auditor”). \n  27 \n\n \n1  an urgent effort to reduce emissions and build resilience for communities.”4 A declaration \n2  of the constitutional parameters of the Governor’s conduct in this time of climate crisis will \n3  assist his office in ensuring that it is not infringing on the rights of citizens, like these \n4  children, when carrying out state laws.  \n5  86. Defendant Montana Department of Environmental Quality (“DEQ”) is a department of \n6  the State of Montana created by Chapter 418, Laws of 1995. \n7  87. Defendant DEQ has a constitutional duty to maintain and improve a clean and healthful \n8  environment for present and future generations. Defendant DEQ also has broad statutory \n9  authority to protect, sustain, and improve a clean and healthful environment to benefit \n10  present and future generations5 but has used its authority in a manner that has resulted in \n11  dangerous levels of GHG emissions.  \n12  88. Defendant DEQ, as the primary administrator of Montana’s environmental regulatory, \n13  environmental  cleanup,  environmental  monitoring,  pollution  prevention,  and  energy \n14  conservation laws, has implemented its authority in a manner that has contributed to the \n15  constitutional violations described herein.6 Defendant DEQ’s actions, pursuant to and in \n16  furtherance of the State Energy Policy, have contributed to dangerous levels of GHG \n17  emissions.7   \n18  89. Defendant DEQ is mandated to ensure that all projects and activities for which it issues \n19  permits, licenses, authorizations or other approvals comply with Montana’s environmental \n20  laws  and  rules  (including  the  MEPA)  to  protect  the  quality  of  Montana’s  natural \n21 \n                                                 \n22  4 Executive Order Creating the Montana Climate Solutions Council and Joining the State of Montana to the U.S. \nClimate Alliance, Mont.

Defendant DEQ issues air quality permits to facilities that emit GHG emissions, including \n4  but not limited to coal mining operations, energy power plants, and oil and gas refineries. \n5  Through its Board of Environmental Review,9 which adopts rules and determines appeals \n6  under regulatory statutes, Defendant DEQ has broad statutory authority to set and enforce \n7  a quantitative limit for emissions as necessary to prevent or control air pollution.10 \n8  91. Defendant DEQ authorizes the construction, operation, and maintenance of interstate \n9  pipelines under the Major Facility Siting Act, Mont. Code Ann. § 75-20-101, et seq. \n10  Pursuant to the Major Facility Siting Act, Defendant DEQ certifies all pipeline facilities \n11  that are constructed or operated in Montana. See Mont. Code Ann. § 75-20-102(4).  \n12  92. Defendant DEQ has permitted strip and underground coal mining operations and mining \n13  and prospecting activities that are causing dangerous amounts of GHG emissions.11 DEQ \n14  has  issued  permits  for  surface  coal  mining  in  Montana  on  state  and  federal  land.12 \n15  Defendant DEQ actively works with coal mining companies in Montana to implement the \n16  State Energy Policy.13 In approving such activities, DEQ has repeatedly refused to disclose \n17  the significant harms to human health and the environment from its decisions. \n18 \n                                                 \n8 Clean Air Act of Montana, Mont.

DEQ has authorized, permitted, and encouraged fossil fuel extraction, transportation, and \n2  combustion, which activities generate dangerous levels of GHG emissions, contribute to \n3  the climate crisis, and harm Youth Plaintiffs.  \n4  94. Defendant Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (“DNRC”) is \n5  charged with “help[ing] ensure Montana’s land and water resources provide benefits for \n6  present and future generations.”14 Defendant DNRC has a constitutional duty to maintain \n7  and improve a clean and healthful environment for present and future generations. In \n8  accordance with the State Energy Policy, the DNRC regulates, permits, and authorizes \n9  activities that result in significant emissions of GHGs in Montana. \n10  95. Defendant DNRC manages all the resources of the state trust lands through the State Board \n11  of Land Commissioners (“Land Board”).15 The Land Board is bound by the public trust to \n12  permit only those activities on state land that are in the best interests of the state.16 To \n13  comply with its constitutional and statutory public trust mandate, the Land Board is \n14  required to manage Montana resources in a manner that is not detrimental to public welfare \n15  or the environment.  \n16  96. Defendant DNRC issues leases, permits, and licenses for all uses of state land.17 Pursuant \n17  to the State Energy Policy, Defendant DNRC has authority to pursue energy development \n18  on  state  land.  DNRC  issues  licenses  for  exploration  and  leases  for  production  and \n19 \n                                                 \n14 See Organization of Department, Mont. Admin. R. 36.1.101 (2019). \n20 \n15 The state trust lands total 5.2 million surface acres and 6.2 subsurface acres, which includes 8,935 agriculture and \ngrazing leases; 1,486 oil and gas leases; and 137 commercial real estate leases. The state trust lands gross revenue \n21 \nfrom all activities was $87.4 million in 2019.

Defendant DNRC \n3  has exercised its authority to grant easements for the operational right-of-way for interstate \n4  pipelines, with the approval of the Land Board, and issue land use licenses for the \n5  construction  right-of-way  and  other  activities  on  state  lands  and  waterways  for  the \n6  construction and operation of interstate pipelines, which are used to transport fossil fuels. \n7  In approving such activities, DNRC has repeatedly failed to disclose the significant harms \n8  to human health and the environment from its decisions. \n9  97. Defendant  DNRC,  through  its  Forestry  Division,  is  responsible  for  planning  and \n10  implementing  forestry  and  fire  management  programs,  as  well  as  authorizing  and \n11  permitting commercial timber sales on public trust lands.18 Although only 4% of Montana’s \n12  forests are within state trust lands, activity on this acreage accounted for nearly 25% of \n13  Montana’s total timber volume sold in 2017.19  \n14  98. As of 2018, Defendant DNRC managed 9,714 acres of leased riverbed and island tracts, in \n15  part to facilitate the development of oil and gas resources.20 The leased tracts provided the \n16  State of Montana with $914,373 in oil and gas revenues in 2018, which is less than 1% of \n17  the amount of money the state spent fighting wildfires in 2018 (which was $95 million).21  \n18 \n                                                 \n18  Montana  Department  of  Natural  Resources  &  Conservation,  Timber  Permit  Information, \n19  http://dnrc.mt.gov/divisions/trust/forest-management/timber-permit-information (last visited Feb. 5, 2020).  \n19 2019 Report to the Montana Legislature, supra note 15, at 7.  \n20See Navigable Waterways, Mont.

The DNRC, through the Montana Board of Oil and Gas Conservation, administers all oil \n2  and gas conservation laws and issues licenses for exploration and leases for production \n3  and extraction of oil and gas in Montana, and permits for drilling in Montana pursuant to \n4  and in furtherance of the State Energy Policy. Mont. Code Ann. § 90-4-1001(1)(e).  \n5  100.  Defendant DNRC has authorized, permitted, licensed, and encouraged fossil fuel \n6  exploitation, extraction, and production, and forestry practices and activities that have \n7  caused and contributed to dangerous concentrations of atmospheric GHGs and the climate \n8  crisis and harmed Youth Plaintiffs.  \n9  101.  Defendant Montana Department of Transportation (“MDT”) is responsible for \n10  the planning, authorization, and operation of programs for the construction, maintenance, \n11  and  monitoring  of  Montana’s  transportation  infrastructure  and  operations,  including \n12  Montana’s highway network, railroads, and airports.22 Defendant MDT is responsible for \n13  state planning in the transportation sector and is charged with collecting and enforcing fuel \n14  taxes.23  \n15  102.  Defendant Montana Public Service Commission (“PSC”) regulates, supervises, \n16  and controls public utilities, common carriers, railroads, and pipelines. Mont. Code Ann. § \n17  69-3-102. Defendant PSC is responsible for reviewing standard-offer contracts and utility \n18  rates, as well as prescribing suitable commercial units of product or service for each kind \n19  of public utility. Mont. Code Ann. § 69-3-108. \n20 \n                                                 \n21  22  See  Montana  Department  of  Transportation,  2019  About  MDT:  Moving  Montana  Forward  (2019), \nhttps://www.mdt.mt.gov/mdt/docs/about-mdt.pdf.  \n22  23  Montana  Department  of  Transportation,  Plan  Summary,  TranPlanMT  (Nov.  2017), \nhttps://www.mdt.mt.gov/tranplan/docs/TPMT-SUMMARY.pdf. Montana’s transportation system is mainly funded \nthrough a combination of federal and state funding sources. Of the total transportation revenue, approximately 60% is \n23 \ngenerated  from  federal  sources  and  40%  is  received  from  state  sources.  See  also  Montana  Department  of \nTransportation,  Volume  IV  Transportation  Management,  TranPlanMT,  11  (Nov.  2017), \nhttps://www.mdt.mt.gov/tranplan/docs/TPMT-MANAGEMENT.pdf.  \n  32 \n\n \n1  103.  Defendant PSC is specifically authorized to adopt rules to implement renewable \n2  energy sources for utilities, Mont. Code Ann. § 69-3-2006, because “utilities should \n3  support expanded development of these resources to meet the state’s electricity demand \n4  and stabilize electricity prices.” Mont. Code Ann. § 69-3-2002. However, Defendant PSC \n5  continues to certify energy projects and utilities that rely on fossil fuels.  \n6  104.  Defendant PSC is responsible for the safety of interstate pipelines (such as gas \n7  pipelines that cross state borders) as well as all liquid lines, including crude oil or petroleum \n8  products, that operate within or through Montana.24 Defendant PSC has exercised its \n9  authority over pipelines in a manner that perpetuates the use of fossil fuels by locking in \n10  infrastructure that will result in GHG emissions for decades. \n11  105.  In sum, through the State Energy Policy, and the actions taken pursuant to and in \n12  furtherance of the Policy, Defendants have taken affirmative actions to authorize, permit, \n13  and encourage fossil fuel extraction, transportation, and combustion resulting in dangerous \n14  levels  of  GHG  emissions  and  contributing  to  climate  destabilization.  Defendants \n15  affirmative actions have degraded and depleted Montana’s environment, are causing \n16  substantial impairment to Montana’s Public Trust Resources, and are causing substantial \n17  harm to Youth Plaintiffs in violation of their constitutional rights.  \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n                                                 \n24 U.S. Department of Trans.

Carbon dioxide is the GHG that is most responsible for trapping excess heat within \n5  Earth’s atmosphere. Excess CO2 and other GHGs from human activity create an “energy \n6  imbalance” that drives warming temperatures and climate disruption. A substantial portion \n7  of every ton of CO2 emitted by human activity persists in the atmosphere for as long as a \n8  millennium or more. As a result, CO2 steadily accumulates in the atmosphere. It is the \n9  cumulative effect of GHG emissions that causes climate disruption. The Earth will continue \n10  to heat up even as more emissions of today and tomorrow continue to increase atmospheric \n11  concentrations of GHGs.  \n12  107.  This  means  that  the  harm  from  present  day  GHG  emissions  will  be \n13  disproportionately borne by today’s children and future generations, including the Youth \n14  Plaintiffs. This scientific concept has been well understood by the Defendants for decades. \n15  108.  Notwithstanding  their  longstanding  knowledge  of  the  dangers  that  climate \n16  disruption and GHG emissions pose, more particularly described below, Defendants have \n17  developed and implemented a State Energy Policy in Montana for decades, which involves \n18  systemic authorization, permitting, encouragement, and facilitation of activities promoting \n19  fossil fuels and resulting in dangerous levels of GHG emissions, without regard to climate \n20  change impacts or the fundamental rights of Youth Plaintiffs and future generations of \n21  Montanans. Mont. Code Ann. § 90-4-1001(c)-(g), State Energy Policy. Moreover, pursuant \n22  to  the  Climate  Change  Exception  to  MEPA,  Mont.  Code  Ann.  §  75-1-201(2)(a), \n23  Defendants have deliberately ignored the dangerous impacts of the climate crisis. \n  34 \n\n \n1  A. Defendants’ State Energy Policy Perpetuates a Fossil-Fuel Based Energy System that \nCauses and Contributes to the Climate Crisis and Youth Plaintiffs’ Injuries \n2 \n109.  The  State  of  Montana  has  a  stated  policy  to  “promote  energy  efficiency, \n3 \nconservation, production, and consumption of a reliable and efficient mix of energy sources \n4 \nthat represent the least social, environmental, and economic costs and the greatest long-\n5 \nterm benefits to Montana citizens.” Mont. Code Ann. § 90-4-1001(a). \n6 \n110.  Contrary to this policy, Montana’s State Energy Policy explicitly promotes the use \n7 \nof dangerous fossil fuels that cause numerous social, environmental, and economic costs \n8 \nand harms to the short- and long-term detriment of Montana citizens. Fossil fuel energy is \n9 \nthe least efficient form of energy available to the State of Montana. The provisions of the \n10 \nState Energy Policy that promote fossil fuels and that Youth Plaintiffs challenge the \n11 \nconstitutionality of in this action state that it is the policy of Montana to:  \n12 \n(c) promote development of projects using advanced technologies that convert coal \n13  into electricity, synthetic petroleum products, hydrogen, methane, natural gas, and \nchemical feedstocks; \n14   \n(d) increase utilization of Montana’s vast coal reserves in an environmentally sound \n15  manner that includes the mitigation of greenhouse gas and other emissions; \n \n16  (e) increase local oil and gas exploration and development to provide high-paying \njobs and to strengthen Montana’s economy; \n17   \n(f)  expand  exploration  and  technological  innovation,  including  using  carbon \n18  dioxide for enhanced oil recovery in declining oil fields to increase output;  \n \n19  (g) expand Montana’s petroleum refining industry as a significant contributor to \nMontana’s manufacturing sector in supplying the transportation energy needs of \n20  Montana and the region;  \n \n21  Mont. Code Ann. § 90-4-1001(c)-(g). \n22  111.  Additionally, the Climate Change Exception to MEPA states:  \n23  Except as provided in subsection (2)(b), an environmental review conducted pursuant to \nsubsection (1) may not include a review of actual or potential impacts beyond Montana's \n  35 \n\n \n1  borders. It may not include actual or potential impacts that are regional, national, or \nglobal in nature. \n2   \nMont. Code Ann. § 75-1-201(2)(a).  \n3 \nThis has been interpreted to mean that Defendants cannot consider the impacts of climate \n4 \nchange in their environmental reviews. \n5 \n112.  Montana’s fossil fuel-based energy system is the result of Montana’s State Energy \n6 \nPolicy, and actions taken pursuant to that policy, which defines Montana’s energy policies, \n7 \ngoals, and development process and explicitly calls for the use of dangerous fossil fuels. \n8 \nThe State Energy Policy has existed for decades and is now codified in law. Mont. Code \n9 \nAnn. § 90-4-1001(c)-(g).  \n10 \n113.  According to Senator Jackson, who sponsored amendments to the State Energy \n11 \nPolicy in 2011, the “State Energy Policy will guide Montana’s energy production.”25 The \n12 \npurpose of the State Energy Policy is to ensure an adequate supply of energy and avoid a \n13 \nhigh cost of energy.26 Those purposes are readily achievable without perpetuating a form \n14 \nof energy that is known to cause dangerous climate change, cause harm to children, and \n15 \nresult in a myriad of other adverse impacts to humans and the environment.  \n16 \n114.  During a hearing before the full Montana Senate on the 2011 amendments to the \n17 \nState Energy Policy, Senator Ron Erickson, in encouraging a no vote on the bill, stated \n18 \n“above all . . . this is a bill that leaves out the major context of our time, it leaves out the \n19 \nfact that global climate change is occurring and that we ought to be a part of the solution \n20 \n21 \n                                                 \n22  25 Senate Energy and Telecommunications: Hearing on SB 305 Revise Energy Policy Before the Senate Energy and \nTelecomm.

I would doubt if there is another nation in the world that would \n2  talk about an energy policy without mentioning that we should be a part of the solution to \n3  climate change.”27  \n4  115.  Despite opposition to the 2011 amendments to the State Energy Policy, the bill \n5  passed and thus Montana’s State Energy Policy, which implicitly promoted fossil fuels for \n6  decades,  was  amended  to  explicitly  promote  fossil  fuels  and  to  expand  the  already \n7  substantial extraction and use of fossil fuels in Montana.  \n8  116.  Montana’s State Energy Policy, and the actions taken pursuant to and in furtherance \n9  of the Policy, leads to fossil fuel development, extraction, transport, and combustion and \n10  other activities that promote fossil fuels and cause emissions of dangerous and substantial \n11  levels of GHG pollution into the atmosphere within Montana and outside of its borders and \n12  contributes to climate destabilization. \n13  117.  Just as invidious majoritarian state policies that segregated children on the basis of \n14  race  or  failed  to  adequately  fund  schools  would  be  unconstitutional  and  undermine \n15  fundamental rights, so too, Montana’s State Energy Policy, which explicitly promotes the \n16  use  of  dangerous  fossil  fuel-based  energy  and  endangers  children,  violates  Youth \n17  Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.  \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n                                                 \n23 \n27 Senate Floor Session: Hearing on SB 305 Revise Energy Policy, 62nd Cong. 492, 13:10:12 – 13:11:03 (Feb. 22, \n2011),  http://sg001-harmony.sliq.net/00309/Harmony/en/PowerBrowser/PowerBrowserV2/20170221/-\n1/21606?agendaId=98099. \n  37 \n\n \n1  B.  Defendants’ Aggregate Acts Pursuant to and in Furtherance of the State Energy \nPolicy Demonstrate an Unconstitutional Systemic Course of Conduct and Cause \n2  Dangerous Levels of GHG Pollution and Climate Destabilization \n3  118.  Despite  Defendants’  knowledge  of  climate  change  dangers  and  Defendants’ \n4  rhetoric on the importance of reducing GHG emissions and the “profound consequences”28 \n5  of climate change, Defendants, pursuant to and in furtherance of the State Energy Policy, \n6  have taken, and continue to take, affirmative actions to authorize, implement, and promote \n7  projects,  activities,  and  plans  (hereinafter,  “aggregate  acts”)  that  cause  emissions  of \n8  dangerous levels of GHG pollution into the atmosphere. For example: \n9  a.  Defendants authorize and certify energy projects and facilities within the State of \n10  Montana that emit substantial levels of GHG pollution, including, but not limited \n11  to, projects that burn and promote the use of fossil fuels.  \n12  b.  Defendant PSC significantly cut utility contract lengths and rates for NorthWestern \n13  Energy in June 2017 demonstrating biased decisions obstructing solar projects.29 \n14  Defendant PSC was found to have violated solar companies’ due process rights by \n15  making decisions based on bias and policy preferences.30 \n16  c.  Defendant PSC exercises its authority to obstruct solar projects.31 The public \n17  service commissioners have publicly expressed their affinity for coal power and \n18  publicly  disparaged  renewable  energy  sources.

Defendant PSC affirmatively acts to promote public utilities reliant on fossil fuels \n4  and against the public safety in the face of dangerous climatic changes.  \n5  e.  Defendants engage in a systemic pattern and practice of issuing permits, licenses, \n6  and leases that result in GHG emissions without considering how the additional \n7  GHG emissions will contribute to the climate crisis.  \n8  f.  Defendants authorize four private coal plants to operate in the state, and these coal \n9  plants are responsible for 30% of Montana’s energy production.  \n10  g.  Defendants continue to permit surface coal mining and reclamation in Montana, \n11  which results in substantial GHG emissions. Defendant DEQ approved the AM4 \n12  expansion of the Rosebud Strip Mine in December 2015. Defendant DEQ issued a \n13  permit to expand the coal mining operation and reclamation plan at Bull Mountain \n14  Mine in July 2016.33 Pursuant to the Climate Change Exception to MEPA, DEQ \n15  refused to analyze how these decisions would aggravate the impacts of climate \n16  change. \n17  h.  In 2018, Defendant DEQ, pursuant to the Climate Change Exception to MEPA, \n18  refused to analyze or discuss any climate change impacts from the TR3 expansion \n19  of the Decker Mine, which allowed the coal company to strip-mine 23 million tons \n20 \n                                                 \n21  32 A tape recording was released by local media, in which Commissioner Lake is recorded admitting to PSC staff that \nthe rates would effectively kill small projects: “[t]he 20 year might do it if the price doesn't, and honestly at this low \n22  price I can't imagine anyone going to get into it, so it becomes a totally moot point because just dropping the rate that \nmuch probably took care of the whole thing.” Catherine Morehouse, supra note 29.  \n33 Montana Department of Environmental Quality, Signal Peak Energy LLC Letter of Approval, Amendment 3, (July \n23 \n6, 2016), \nhttps://deq.mt.gov/Portals/112/Land/CoalUranium/Documents/SPE%20AM3/Approval%20Letter%20July%202016\n.pdf.  \n  39 \n\n \n1  of coal, which will lead to nearly 50 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions when \n2  burned, aggravating the impacts of climate change including causing negative \n3  socioeconomic impacts to Montanans. \n4  i.  In 2020, Defendant DEQ is preparing to revise its permit to Spring Creek Mine, the \n5  largest coal producer in the state. The proposed revision would add 977 acres of \n6  new mining disturbance to recover approximately 72 million tons of coal. In August \n7  2019, Defendant DEQ, pursuant to the Climate Change Exception to MEPA, \n8  refused to analyze impacts on the social cost of carbon and the economic impacts \n9  from climate change in its draft environmental impact statement for the Spring \n10  Creek  Mine.  Although  public  comments  urged  Defendants  to  consider  these \n11  impacts in the DEQ analysis, Defendants did not review how their decision would \n12  aggravate impacts of climate change, and the substantial socioeconomic impacts on \n13  Montanans. \n14  j.  Defendant DEQ authorizes the operation of the Colstrip Steam Electric Station, \n15  which produced 13.2 million metric tons of CO , 38,015 metric tons of methane, \n2e\n16  and 65,919 metric tons of nitrous oxide in 2018.34  \n17  k.  Defendant DEQ granted the Bull Mountain Mine an air quality permit in January \n18  2016, authorizing Bull Mountain Mine to produce 15 million tons of coal during \n19  any rolling 12-month period.35 Pursuant to the Climate Change Exception to \n20 \n                                                 \n21  34 See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Facility Level Information on Greenhouse Gases Tool, Colstrip, \nhttps://ghgdata.epa.gov/ghgp/service/facilityDetail/2018?id=1001020&ds=E&et=&popup=true.

Defendant DEQ issued a certificate of compliance for the Keystone XL Pipeline in \n4  March 2012, which authorized the construction, operation, and maintenance of the \n5  Montana portion of the pipeline that would result in substantial GHG emissions. \n6  Defendant DNRC leased public land for the easement for the operational right-of-\n7  way, with the approval of the Land Board, and issued a land use license for the \n8  construction right-of-way and other activities on state lands and waterways.36  \n9  m. Defendants  DEQ  and  DNRC  issued  permits,  licenses,  and  leases  for  the \n10  construction, operation, and maintenance of the Keystone XL Pipeline project in \n11  Montana, which would transport Canadian tar sands crude oil, the most greenhouse \n12  gas intense source of petroleum in the world. Pursuant to the Climate Change \n13  Exception to MEPA, neither DEQ nor DNRC disclosed to the public the health or \n14  climate consequences of these decisions.37  \n15  n.  Defendants authorize, through licenses and leases, the exploration and extraction \n16  of oil and gas in Montana.  \n17  o.  Defendants have adopted and enforced GHG emissions standards for petroleum \n18  refineries that authorize dangerous levels of GHG emissions. Secondary emissions \n19  are not considered by Defendants in determining potential to emit.38 \n20 \n                                                 \n21  36 Montana Department of Environmental Quality, In the Matter of the Application of TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, \nLP (Keystone) for a Certificate of Compliance under the Major Facility Siting Act: Findings Necessary for \n22  Certification  and  Determination,  4  (March  30,  2012), \nhttp://deq.mt.gov/Portals/112/DEQAdmin/MFS/Documents/KXL_Cert_Final_Signed.PDF.   \n37 Id.  \n23 \n38 Montana Department of Environmental Quality, Instructions for Registering, Updating, or Deregistering an Oil or \nGas  Well  Facility  (June  6,  2018), \nhttp://deq.mt.gov/Portals/112/Air/AirQuality/Documents/forms/InstructionsMTOGRegistration-01.pdf.  \n  41 \n\n \n1  p.  Defendants  continue  to  certify  and  authorize  four  petroleum  refineries—\n2  Exxon/Mobil, Phillips 66, CHS Laurel, and Calumet Refining—in the State of \n3  Montana. In 2016, these refineries exported 66.5 million barrels of crude oil. The \n4  four refineries combined released 2.0 million metric tons of CO  in 2018.39 \n2e\n5  Pursuant to the Climate Change Exception to MEPA, Defendants have failed to \n6  disclose to the public the health or climate consequences of these decisions. \n7  q.  Defendants have explicitly adopted and endorsed fuel and fuel tax requirements for \n8  vehicles, commercial carriers, and aviation that lock in dangerous levels of GHG \n9  emissions from the transportation sector.40   \n10  r.  Defendants have exempted certain facilities that burn fossil fuels from present and \n11  future compliance with GHG emission standards.  \n12  s.  Defendants continue to finance, incentivize, and subsidize fossil fuel infrastructure \n13  and energy and transportation systems that are endangering Youth Plaintiffs, while \n14  refusing to harness Montana’s potential for wind energy.  \n15  t.  Defendants continue to aggressively pursue expansion of the fossil fuel industry in \n16  Montana, particularly the expansion of coal and mining development, as well as oil \n17  and gas development.  \n18  u.  Defendant Bullock has stated that “[] coal will continue to be a critical part of the \n19  nation’s energy portfolio for years to come, and increasing electricity demand will \n20 \n21 \n22 \n                                                 \n23 \n39 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2018 Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Large Facilities, Facility Level \nInformation on Greenhouse Gases Tool (“Flight”) (last updated Aug. 4, 2019), https://bit.ly/2HqZvMM.  \n40 2019 About MDT: Moving Montana Forward, supra note 22, at 2-3, 8, 13.  \n  42 \n\n \n1  ensure that we will need both carbon-based and renewable sources of energy, and \n2  not enough is done in this country to advance clean-coal technologies.”41  \n3  v.  Defendant Bullock continues to support policies that incentivize technologies for \n4  coal,  including  but  not  limited  to:  (1)  providing  favorable  tax  treatment  for \n5  investments in carbon capture, sequestration, and transportation; and (2) calling for \n6  stronger policies and incentives to advance enhanced oil recovery and CO  capture \n2\n7  at power plants and other industrial sources; both of which directly authorize GHG \n8  emissions to continue at dangerous levels in Montana. \n9  w. Defendants continue to “safeguard existing economic and energy assets”42 by \n10  authorizing  Montana  fossil  fuel  extraction,  production,  consumption, \n11  transportation, and exportation. \n12  119.  Defendants’ aggregate acts described herein, taken pursuant to and in furtherance \n13  of the State Energy Policy, continue to be executed by Defendants and their agents and \n14  employees in their official capacities, and such actions are causing and contributing to the \n15  ongoing deprivation of Youth Plaintiffs’ fundamental rights secured by the Montana \n16  Constitution. \n17  120.  Given that Defendants have persisted in, and continue to persist in, a wrongful and \n18  unconstitutional systemic course of conduct affirmatively authorizing, permitting, and \n19  promoting fossil fuels and dangerous GHG emissions, with knowledge of the dangers of \n20  climate change since at least the 1960s, there is substantial likelihood that Defendants’ \n21  State Energy Policy, and aggregate acts taken pursuant to the State Energy Policy, will \n22 \n                                                 \n41 Amended Executive Order Establishing an Interim Montana Clean Power Plan Advisory Council, Exec.

Order No. 8-2019, 3 (July 1, 2019).  \n  43 \n\n \n1  continue and will, inter alia, further deprive Youth Plaintiffs of their constitutional rights. \n2  This evidence demonstrates that similar illegal conduct will continue in the future absent \n3  judicial intervention.  \n4  DEFENDANTS’ STATE ENERGY POLICY HAS RESULTED IN DANGEROUS \nAMOUNTS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN MONTANA \n5 \n121.  As a result of Defendant’s State Energy Policy, and actions taken consistent with \n6 \nthat policy, Defendants are responsible for dangerous amounts of GHG emissions from \n7 \nMontana – both cumulative emissions and ongoing emissions, which in turn causes and \n8 \ncontributes to the Youth Plaintiffs’ injuries.  \n9 \n122.  According to U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) data, in 2017, 30.5 \n10 \nmillion metric tons of CO  were emitted in Montana from fossil fuel consumption, or \n2\n11 \nemissions that result from burning fossil fuels within the boundaries of the State of \n12 \nMontana.43 Of that amount, 14.9 million metric tons of CO was attributable to coal \n2 \n13 \nconsumption, 11.2 million metric tons of CO from the consumption of petroleum products; \n2 \n14 \nand 4.4 million metric tons of CO  from natural gas consumption.44  \n2\n15 \n123.  According to EIA data, Montana’s 2017 CO  emissions have increased by 56% \n2\n16 \nfrom 1980, when Montana emitted 19.5 million metric tons of CO , and increased by 13% \n2\n17 \ncompared to 1990 levels, which were 27.0 million metric tons of CO .45 \n2\n18 \n124.  The  above  emissions  data  significantly  underestimates  total  greenhouse  gas \n19 \nemissions attributable to Montana. The EIA inventory only reports CO  emissions from \n2\n20 \nfossil fuel consumption in Montana. It does not include: (a) GHG emissions from the \n21 \n                                                 \n22  43 These numbers include CO emissions for all electricity generation in Montana, including the electricity that is \n2 \neventually sent to other states.  \n44 U.S. Energy Information Admin. (EIA) State Carbon Dioxide Emissions Data, Montana Carbon Dioxide Emissions \n23 \nfrom Fossil Fuel Consumption (1980-2017), https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/state/excel/montana.xlsx \n(last updated Oct. 23, 2019). \n45 Id.  \n  44 \n\n \n1  combustion of fossil fuels extracted in Montana and then exported and combusted out of \n2  state; (b) non-CO  emissions (methane and nitrous oxide, for example) resulting from fossil \n2\n3  fuel extraction and combustion; (c) GHG emissions from non-energy sources (land use, \n4  agriculture, forestry, and process emissions from cement manufacture, for example); (d) \n5  GHG emissions resulting from the extraction and out of state transport of imported fossil \n6  fuels; or (e) embedded GHG emissions—those emissions resulting from the production \n7  and transportation of goods and energy produced outside of Montana but ultimately \n8  consumed in Montana. Consequently, the EIA data significantly underestimates GHG \n9  emissions attributable to Montana. For sense of scale, if we look at the U.S. as a whole, \n10  CO  emissions from fossil fuel consumption in 2017 are only 76% of U.S. territorial carbon \n2\n11  dioxide equivalent (“CO e”) emissions.46  \n2\n12  125.  The most complete (albeit outdated) data for GHG emissions that result from \n13  Montana’s State Energy Policy47 is from a 2007 report, Montana Climate Change Action \n14  Plan, a report of the Governor’s Climate Change Advisory Committee (“CCAC”).48 \n15  According to this report, Montana’s GHG emissions were 39.2 million metric tons of CO e \n2\n16  in 1990; 43.7 million metric tons of CO e in 2000; and were projected to be 50.0 million \n2\n17  metric tons of CO e in 2010 and 54.6 million metric tons of CO e in 2020.49 This data is \n2 2\n18  outdated and so significantly underestimates the GHG emissions attributable to Montana \n19 \n                                                 \n46 U.S. Energy Information Admin. (EIA), Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990 – 2017 \n20 \n(2019). \n47  GHG  emissions  include  emissions  from  carbon  dioxide,  methane,  nitrous  oxide,  hydrofluorocarbons, \n21 \nperfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.  \n48 This November 2007 report was prepared with input from the Montana Department of Environmental Quality and \n22  the Center for Climate Strategies and relied heavily on in the September 2007 report titled Montana GHG Emissions \nInventory and Reference Case Projections, 1990-2020, for Montana’s GHG inventory and projections. The September \n2007 report was presented to the CCAC, which unanimously approved it.    \n23 \n49 Montana Climate Change Action Plan: Final Report of the Governor’s Climate Change Advisory Committee, supra \nnote 28, at 1-9. These emissions numbers include emissions from agriculture and from the generation of electricity \nsent out of state. They do not include emissions sinks, such as forestry and soil sinks. Id.  \n  45 \n\n \n1  because it excludes emissions from fossil fuels extracted in Montana but exported and \n2  combusted out of state as well as embedded emissions. The lack of transparency regarding \n3  these emissions is due in part to Defendants ongoing and systemic refusal, pursuant to the \n4  Climate Change Exception to MEPA, to disclose the climate change impacts of their \n5  actions. Since 2011, the Montana legislature has barred state agencies from considering \n6  climate change under MEPA. Mont. Code Ann. § 75-1-201(2)(a).  \n7  126.  Nevertheless,  despite  having  the  authority  to  do  so,  Defendants  have  never \n8  completed a comprehensive accounting and inventory that accounts for all of Montana’s \n9  GHG emissions, including emissions from fossil fuels extracted in Montana but exported \n10  and combusted out of state and embedded emissions. As such, Defendants failed to disclose \n11  to the public the danger caused by its implementation of its State Energy Policy. \n12  127.  Based  on  EIA  data,  in  2017,  Montana’s  electrical  power  sector,  over  which \n13  Defendants exercise regulatory control, was responsible for 15.5 million metric tons of \n14  CO emissions, 51% of statewide emissions. The next largest source of CO  emissions in \n2  2\n15  2017 was the transportation sector, which accounted for 8.0 million metric tons of CO  in \n2\n16  2017, 26% of Montana’s emissions. The industrial sector accounted for 3.8 million metric \n17  tons  of  CO in  2017,  12.5%  of  Montana’s  emissions.  Finally,  the  residential  sector \n2 \n18  accounted  for  1.7  million  metric  tons  of  CO in  2017,  5.6%  of  emissions,  and  the \n2 \n19  commercial sector accounted for 1.5 million metric tons of CO , or 4.9% of emissions.50  \n2\n20  128.  In 2017, Montana consumed 156.1 trillion Btu of coal, 83.3 trillion Btu of natural \n21  gas, 60.8 trillion Btu of motor gasoline (excluding ethanol), 51.9 trillion Btu of distillate \n22  fuel oil, 44.5 trillion Btu of other petroleum products, 100.9 trillion Btu of hydroelectric \n23 \n                                                 \n50 Montana Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Fossil Fuel Consumption (1980-2017), supra note 44. \n  46 \n\n \n1  power, 20.5 trillion Btu of other renewables (excluding biomass), and 19 trillion Btu of \n2  biomass.51  \n3  129.  Montana’s per capita energy consumption is among the top one-third of all states, \n4  ranking 12th highest energy use per capita in 2017.52  \n5  130.  Coal-fired  power \n6  plants, which are authorized to \n7  operate  by  Defendants, \n8  provide  the  largest  share  of \n9  Montana’s  electricity \n10  generation,  roughly  47%  in \n11  2018 (see Figure 153). Besides \n12  coal, Montana gets about 40%  Figure 1: Electricity sources in Montana. \n13  of its electricity from hydroelectric power plants and 8% from wind power. Natural gas \n14  and oil each currently represent almost 2% of electric power generation.54 Roughly half of \n15  the electricity generated in Montana is used in-state while the other half is sent to other \n16  states via high-voltage transmission lines. \n17  131.  In September 2019, Montana, pursuant to its State Energy Policy, generated 1,383 \n18  thousand MWh of electricity from coal; 49 thousand MWh of electricity from natural gas; \n19  543 thousand MWh of electricity from hydroelectric power plants; and 186 thousand MWh \n20 \n21                                                   \n51 U.S. Energy Information Admin., Montana State Energy Profile, https://www.eia.gov/state/print.php?sid=MT (last \n22  updated Jan. 16, 2020). \n52 U.S. Energy Information Admin, Table C13.

Montana produced nearly six times as much energy from fossil fuel as \n3  it produced from renewables. In other words, only 14.6% of the energy produced in \n4  Montana is from renewable sources.  Defendants—who manage, operate, and regulate the \n5  energy sector by and through the State Energy Policy—have the authority to produce \n6  renewable energy sources. Nevertheless, Defendants are manifestly indifferent to Youth \n7  Plaintiffs’ injuries and continue to authorize energy from fossil fuels as opposed to \n8  renewables.  \n9  134.  Montana has six coal mines (see Figure 358), all of which Defendants authorize to \n10  operate, and the Nation’s largest estimated recoverable coal reserves, accounting for nearly \n11  one-third of the Nation’s recoverable coal reserves, and is a substantial supplier of coal for \n12  the rest of the country.59 Between 1960 and 2017 over 1.63 billion short tons of coal were \n13  mined in Montana,60 with authorization from Defendants, releasing 3,073 million metric \n14  tons of CO  emissions once combusted. In 2018, over 38 million short tons of coal were \n2\n15  mined from Montana, with authorization from Defendants, making it the sixth largest coal \n16  producer in the United States.61 Once combusted, that 38 million short tons of coal is \n17  equivalent to approximately 72.8 million metric tons CO  emissions.

Pursuant to its State Energy Policy, Montana produces 1 in every 200 barrels of \n15  U.S. oil. In 2018, Montana’s oil production rose to 59,000 barrels per day and there were \n16  over 4,600 producing oil wells as of 2017 (see Figure 4).63 With the authorization of \n17  Defendants, Montana produced 20,706,000 barrels of crude oil in 2017 alone that, once \n18  combusted, resulted in 8,948,719 metric tons CO . As of March 2019, Montana’s monthly \n2\n19  crude oil production was 62,000 barrels per day.64 Between 1960 and 2017, Defendants \n20 \n                                                 \n62  U.S.  Energy  Information  Admin.,  Profile  Analysis,  Montana  State  Profile  and  Energy  Estimates \n21 \nhttps://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=MT (last updated Jan. 16, 2020); Understanding Energy in Montana \n2018, supra note 34.  \n22  63 Montana Department of Environmental Quality, Petroleum Tables Workbook – 2019 Update, Table P3 (2019), \nhttp://deq.mt.gov/Portals/112/Energy/Documents/Energy_Statistics/PetroleumTables2019.xlsx;  see  also  Montana \nState Energy Profile, supra note 51.  \n23 \n64  U.S.  Energy  Information  Admin.,  Montana  Supply  Data  and  Map, \nhttps://www.eia.gov/beta/states/states/mt/data/dashboard/production-capacity-generation  (last  accessed  Dec.  24, \n2019). \n  50 \n\n \n1  authorized the production of 1.59 billion barrels of crude oil that, once combusted, resulted \n2  in 689 million metric tons of CO .

There are four state-authorized oil refineries in Montana with a combined oil \n14 \nprocessing capacity of roughly 205,000 barrels per day. The refineries process crude oil \n15 \nlargely from Canada and Wyoming and distribute the refined product by railroad and \n16 \npipeline throughout Montana and to nearby states.  \n17 \n137.  According  to  EIA  data,  there  were  over  7,400  state-authorized  natural  gas \n18 \nproducing wells in 2018 and Montana’s monthly natural gas production was approximately \n19 \n4,000 million cubic feet as of September 2019.65 Total gas production in 2017 was 46,090 \n20 \nmillion cubic feet that, once burned resulted in 2,509,139 metric tons of CO . Between \n21  2\n1960 and 2017, 3.26 trillion cubic feet of gas were produced in Montana, resulting in 177.7 \n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n65  U.S.  Energy  Information  Admin.,  Montana  Natural  Gas  Data  and  Map, \nhttps://www.eia.gov/beta/states/states/mt/data/dashboard/natural-gas (last visited Dec. 24, 2019). \n  51 \n\n \n1  million metric tons of CO . Pursuant to its State Energy Policy, Montana consumes more \n2\n2  natural gas than it produces, making it a net gas importer.66 \n3  138.  In 2017, almost one-fifth of all U.S. natural gas imports from Canada entered the \n4  United States by pipelines that go through Montana and are authorized by Defendants. \n5  Roughly 95% of the natural gas that enters Montana passes right through the state to other \n6  states.  \n7  139.  Montana’s lands contain a significant quantity of fossil fuels yet to be extracted, \n8  but that can be extracted under the State’s Energy Policy. According to EIA data, as of \n9  2018 there were over 817 million short tons of recoverable coal at producing mines.67 If \n10  burned, this would release some 1,541 million metric tons of CO . The state also contains \n2\n11  279 million barrels of proven crude oil reserves68 that, if combusted, would release 121 \n12  million metric tons of CO . Almost 600 billion cubic feet dry natural gas reserves are \n2\n13  contained within Montana’s borders69 that, if combusted, would release 32 million metric \n14  tons of CO . Pursuant to and in further of the State Energy Policy, Defendants continue to \n2\n15  permit, promote, authorize, and encourage fossil fuel use and production in Montana and \n16  other activities resulting in dangerous levels of GHG emissions.  \n17  140.  In sum, between 1960 and 2017, the coal, oil, and gas extracted from Montana, with \n18  state authorization, resulted in 3,940 million metric tons of CO  emissions once combusted. \n2\n19  For perspective, that is roughly equivalent to 80% of all energy-related U.S. CO  emissions \n2\n20 \n21 \n                                                 \n22  66 Montana State Energy Profile, supra note 51. \n67  U.S.  Energy  Information  Admin.,  Montana  Coal  Data  and  Map, \nhttps://www.eia.gov/beta/states/states/mt/data/dashboard/coal (last visited Dec. 24, 2019). \n23 \nU.S.  Energy  Information  Admin.,  Montana  Crude  Oil  and  Petroleum  Products  Data  and  Map \nhttps://www.eia.gov/beta/states/states/mt/data/dashboard/crude-oil-petroleum (last visited Dec. 24, 2019). \n69 Montana Natural Gas Data and Map, supra note 65.  \n  52 \n\n \n1  for 2018.70 This amount of cumulative emissions would rank as the third largest when \n2  compared to the annual emissions of countries (behind China and the United States, using \n3  2018 emissions data).71 \n4  141.  Additionally, between 1980 and 2017, a cumulative 1,083 million metric tons of \n5  CO  were emitted from fossil fuel consumption in Montana.72 Compared to the emissions \n2\n6  of all countries around the world in 2018, that quantity of emissions would rank sixth in \n7  the world.73 \n8  142.  Whether looking at a particular year or Montana’s historical and cumulative GHG \n9  emissions, the state, as a result of actions taken pursuant to and in furtherance of the State \n10  Energy Policy, is responsible for a significant and dangerous quantity of GHG emissions \n11  that have contributed to dangerous climate change and infringed the constitutional rights \n12  of Youth Plaintiffs. The GHG emissions have continued, and only grown, notwithstanding \n13  the passage of the 1972 Montana Constitution, MEPA, and Defendants’ longstanding \n14  knowledge of the dangers posed by fossil fuels and the climate crisis. \n15  ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE DESTABILIZATION IS ALREADY CAUSING \nDANGEROUS IMPACTS IN MONTANA \n16 \n143.  There  is  an  overwhelming  scientific  consensus  that  human-caused  climate \n17 \ndisruption is occurring and is dangerous to humans and other life and ecosystems on which \n18 \nhumans depend. The present rate of global heating and ocean acidification is a result of \n19 \nanthropogenic GHG emissions, primarily CO  emissions, from the combustion of fossil \n2\n20 \nfuels. This release of GHG emissions into the atmosphere, combined with carbon released \n21 \n22                                                   \n70 U.S. Energy Information Admin., U.S. Energy-Related CO2 Emissions Increased in 2018 but Will Likely Fall in \n2019 and 2020, Today in Energy (Jan. 28, 2019), https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=38133. \n23 \n71 Global Carbon Atlas, CO  Emissions (2019), http://www.globalcarbonatlas.org/en/CO2-emissions.  \n2\n72 Montana Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Fossil Fuel Consumption (1980-2017), supra note 44.  \n73 Global Carbon Atlas, supra note 71.  \n  53 \n\n \n1  through deforestation and soil degradation, has disrupted Earth’s energy balance, thereby \n2  changing Earth’s climate, resulting in climate disruption globally and in Montana. \n3  A. Anthropogenic Climate Disruption and the Dangers of Increased Global Warming \n4  144.  The global annual average atmospheric CO2 concentration for 2019 was 411.4 ppm \n5  compared  to  the  pre-industrial  concentration  of  280  ppm.74  The  atmospheric  CO2 \n6  concentration has been increasing, and continues to increase, as a direct result of human \n7  combustion of fossil fuels (see Figures 5 and 6).75 Current atmospheric CO2 concentrations \n8  are higher than levels in millions of years. Atmospheric CO2 is the primary forcer of climate \n9  change. \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n \n17  Figure 5: Atmospheric CO  concentration over past 800,000 years.

The  atmosphere  and  water  are  inextricably  linked  and  there  is  a  continuous \n11  movement of water between the earth and atmosphere.76 Almost all of the water in the \n12 \natmosphere is from evaporation from water bodies or evapotranspiration by plants and \n13 \nvegetation.  Subsequent  precipitation  adds  water  back  into  land-based  hydrological \n14  systems.77 Thus, there is both a functional and physical connection between the land-based \n15 \nwater and the atmosphere. The atmosphere contains more freshwater than the rivers and \n16 \nlakes of Montana and indeed contains atmospheric rivers that provide precipitation for \n17 \nMontana. The atmosphere, the oceans, other freshwater resources, and the biosphere are \n18 \nall interconnected.  \n19 \n146.  For the first time in the measurable paleoclimatic record, CO levels have risen by \n2 \n20 \n130 ppm within only 150 years, a rate 100 times faster than the natural increase in carbon \n21 \n                                                 \n22  76  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA),  Water  Cycle,  Education, \nhttps://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/freshwater-education-resources/water-cycle (last updated Feb. \n2019). \n23 \n77 United States Geological Survey (USGS), A Comprehensive Study of the Natural Water Cycle, Water Science \nSchool,  https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/a-comprehensive-study-natural-water-\ncycle?qt-science_center_objects=0#Condensation (last visited Feb. 20, 2020).  \n  55 \n\n \n1  dioxide from 180 to 280 ppm following the last ice age, which ended some 12,000 years \n2  ago.  \n3  147.  The concentrations of other GHGs in the atmosphere have also increased. For \n4  example, the concentration of methane, a GHG that is 86 times78 more potent than carbon \n5  dioxide, has increased approximately 250% since the mid 1800s. \n6  148.  GHGs in the atmosphere act like a blanket over Earth to trap the heat received from \n7  the sun (see Figure 7).79 Without this greenhouse effect, the Earth’s average surface \n8  temperature would be 0° F (-18° C) instead of 59° F (15° C). Scientists have understood \n9  this basic mechanism of global heating since at least the late-nineteenth century. More \n10  GHGs in the atmosphere means that more heat is being retained on Earth, with less heat \n11  radiating back out into space, causing a disruption in Earth’s energy balance.  \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n \n19 \nFigure 7: While greenhouse gases, like CO  normally trap some of the sun’s heat, which \n2\n20  prevents the planet from freezing (left side), with increasing atmospheric \nconcentrations of GHGs, the planet is now experiencing an energy imbalance and is \n21  warming at an unprecedented rate (right side). \n22                                                   \n78 Gunnar Myhre et al., Chapter 8: Anthropogenic and Natural Radiative Forcing: Climate Change 2013: The \nPhysical  Science  Basis,  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC),  714  (2013), \n23 \nhttp://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_Chapter08_FINAL.pdf. \n79 Will Elder, What is Climate Change?, U.S. National Park Service, https://www.nps.gov/goga/learn/nature/climate-\nchange-causes.htm (last updated Sep. 13, 2019). \n  56 \n\n \n1  149.  A substantial portion of every ton of CO  emitted by humans persists in the \n2\n2  atmosphere for as long as a millennium or more. As a result, CO steadily accumulates in \n2 \n3  the  atmosphere.  The  Earth  will  continue  to  warm  in  response  to  the  atmospheric \n4  concentrations of GHGs caused by past emissions, as well as future emissions; therefore, \n5  the impacts associated with the CO  emissions of today will be mostly borne by Youth \n2\n6  Plaintiffs, other youth, and future generations.  \n7  150.  Unless GHGs are reduced to meet science-based targets, climatic tipping points, \n8  such as massive species extinction and rapid ice sheet disintegration, will be reached and \n9  the Earth will cross a point of no return after which catastrophic climate change impacts \n10  will be unavoidable and irreversible. The continued GHG emissions from fossil fuels will \n11  further disrupt Earth’s climate system and that, in turn, will impose profound and mounting \n12  risks of ecological, economic, and social collapse. \n13  B.  The Impacts of Climate Disruption in Montana are Pervasive \n14  151.  One key observable change in the climate system, and in Montana, is the rapid \n15  increase in recorded global surface temperatures. The last decade, 2010-2019, was the \n16  warmest on record. The increased concentrations of GHGs in our atmosphere have raised \n17  average global surface temperature by more than 1° C (over 2.0° F) from 1880 to 2019.80 \n18  This is well above the maximum warming of the Holocene era, the ~12,000 year epoch of \n19  relatively stable climate, which allowed human civilization to develop. \n20  152.  The impacts of climate disruption in Montana are pervasive. Annual average \n21  temperatures  across  Montana  have  risen  significantly  more  than  the  global  average, \n22 \n                                                 \n23 \n80 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 2019 was 2nd hottest year on record for Earth say \nNOAA, NASA (January 15, 2020), https://www.noaa.gov/news/2019-was-2nd-hottest-year-on-record-for-earth-say-\nnoaa-nasa. \n  57 \n\n \n1  between 2° and 3° F between 1950 and 2015.81 It is as if the Earth has a constant fever, and \n2  just as in the human body, even a slight rise in temperature weakens the organism, increases \n3  the vulnerability of the organism, and can have dangerous long-term effects on the system. \n4  By mid-century, when the Youth Plaintiffs will be adults, models project that the annual \n5  average daily maximum temperature in Montana will increase by approximately 4.5-6.0° \n6  F, a temperature increase that would imperil human civilization (see Figure 8). By the end \n7  of the century, models predict that the annual average daily maximum temperature in \n8  Montana will increase by approximately 5-10° F.82 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n \n18 \nFigure 8: Projected increase in annual average daily maximum temperature (°F) in \nMontana for mid-century (2049-2069) and end-of-century (2070-2099) under two \n19 \ndifferent GHG emission pathways.

Montana has warmed more than most of the contiguous United States because \n2  northern latitudes heat more quickly.84 As a result of the average temperature increase, heat \n3  waves are becoming more common and snow is melting earlier in the spring season.

Climate disruption in Montana—specifically, temperature rises resulting in warmer \n13 \nsprings and the delay of frost in the fall—will have a significant economic impact on \n14 \nMontana’s two primary agricultural sectors. The economic impact is projected as a 20% \n15 \ndecline in rangeland cattle production and 25% reduction in grain production.87 The \n16 \neconomic losses associated with this aspect of climate disruption would be the loss of about \n17 \n25,000 jobs and $736 million in labor earnings by 2055.88 As a result of the impacts to the \n18 \nagricultural sector, food shortages that lead to higher food prices will also be borne by \n19 \nfuture Montana consumers and Youth Plaintiffs.89 Such losses would be particularly \n20 \nharmful to Montana’s family ranchers and farmers, including Youth Plaintiff Rikki. \n21 \n22                                                   \n87 Thomas Michael Power, et al., The Impact of Climate Change on Montana’s Agriculture Economy, Montana \nFarmers  Union,  16  (2016),  https://montanafarmersunion.com/wp-\n23 \ncontent/uploads/2016/02/FINAL_Impact_Climate_Change_MT_Ag_Econ_Power_Consulting_2-24-2016.pdf.  \n88 Id. at 18.   \n89 Expert Report of Joseph E.

While Montana’s growing season has lengthened with warming temperatures, \n2  future climate changes will become increasingly disruptive to Montana’s agricultural \n3  sectors. For example, reduced irrigation capacity from decreasing mountain snowpack is \n4  projected to impact hay, sugar beet, malt barley, market garden, and potato production.90 \n5  In addition, warmer winter temperatures will lead to increased winter annual weeds, which \n6  are projected to decrease crop yields and forage productivity.91 \n7  156.  The longer growing seasons also allows trees, grasses, and other plants to produce \n8  pollen for a longer period, resulting in aggravated and prolonged allergies for millions of \n9  Americans, including Youth Plaintiffs Lander and Olivia.  \n10  157.  Montana encompasses part of the northern Rocky Mountain region. The northern \n11  Rocky Mountains are a headwaters region, including the Missouri river system to the East \n12  and the Columbia River system to the West, where most of the water originates as snow.92 \n13  Due to the warming climate, the water cycle in the atmosphere is disrupted and less \n14  precipitation falls as snow, and more snow melts during winter.93 Consequently, Montana’s \n15  snowpack  has  been  decreasing  and  is  likely  to  continue  decreasing  with  warming \n16  temperatures (see Figure 11).94 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n                                                 \n22  90 Cathy Whitlock et al., supra note 81, at 198.  \n91 Id. at 199.  \n92 Gregory T.

The  reduced  snowpack  corresponds  to  shortened  ski  seasons  and  negatively \n16 \nimpacts other forms of winter tourism and recreation activities in Montana.95 A number of \n17 \nYouth Plaintiffs, including Georgi and Claire, have been harmed by the reduced snowpack \n18 \nand impacts to winter tourism. Changes in snowpack and runoff timing will likely increase \n19 \ndrought  conditions,  which  will  be  exacerbated  by  the  rising  temperatures.96  While \n20 \nprecipitation is expected to increase in winter, spring, and fall, it is projected to decrease \n21 \n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n95 What Climate Change Means for Montana, supra note 84.  \n96 Cathy Whitlock et al., supra note 81, at 123. \n  62 \n\n \n1  in summer.97 Demand for groundwater will likely grow with temperature increases and \n2  changes in availability of surface water sources.98 \n3  159.  Glacier National Park is a world-renowned landmark, major driver of the regional \n4  economy, and source of fresh water for countless communities.99 In Glacier National Park, \n5  the effects of climate disruption are dramatic as the glaciers are rapidly retreating (see \n6  Figure 12100).101 Glaciers retreat when melting outpaces accumulation of new snow.102 \n7  Scientific surveys of Glacier National Park have observed that “all glaciers have been \n8  reduced in area since 1966 with some glaciers having been reduced by as much as 85% by \n9  2015.”103 Specifically, the glaciers in the Blackfoot-Jackson Glacier Basin of Glacier \n10  National Park decreased in area from 21.6 square kilometers (“km2”) in 1850 to 7.4 km2 in \n11  1979.104 Of the approximately 150 glaciers present in the park in 1850, only 26 glaciers \n12  (larger than 25 acres) remained in 2015. As Dr. Eric Rignot, an expert in glaciology and \n13  climate change, has stated: “Glacier National Park will soon have no glaciers left. Most of \n14  the glaciers in that park no longer qualify as glaciers per my definition of what a glacier is, \n15  which is an entity of ice thick enough to deform under its own weight, which requires ice \n16  to be at least 100 m thick.”105 \n17   \n                                                 \n18 \n97 Id. at 10.  \n98 Id. at 114.  \n19  99 D.B.

Youth Plaintiffs, including Kian, Eva, Mica, and Claire, are losing their ability to \n22 \naccess and recreate near and around glaciers. The loss of glaciers, which are also important \n23 \nwater sources, has significant consequences for the surrounding ecosystems as well as \n  64 \n\n \n1  impacting landscape aesthetics valued by visitors to the national parks.106 Seasonal snow \n2  accumulation does not function the same as glacial melt, as it melts early in the summer \n3  season. Glaciers, instead, “act as a ‘bank’ of water (stored as ice) whose continual melt \n4  helps regulate stream temperatures and maintains streamflow during late summer and \n5  drought  periods  when  other  sources  are  depleted.”107  Without  glacial  melt,  stream \n6  temperatures will likely increase, which may have detrimental effects for temperature \n7  sensitive aquatic insects, thereby disrupting the aquatic food chain.108 Warming stream \n8  temperatures have led to a reduction in native fish growth, and an increase in nonnative \n9  fish growth.109 The impact of the melting glaciers in Glacier National Park is having an \n10  effect on the downstream watershed, Montana’s economy, and the livelihoods of many \n11  Montanans.  \n12  161.  Montana’s rivers are already experiencing the impacts of climate disruption as the \n13  water levels are decreasing and temperatures are increasing. As shown in Figure 13, the \n14  snow water equivalent (“SWE”), or the amount of water contained in the snow, for the \n15  river basins for the Clark Fork, Missouri, and Yellowstone Rivers, rivers Youth Plaintiffs, \n16  including Kian, Georgi, Grace, Mica, and Eva, fish and recreate in, are expected to continue \n17  to decline significantly in the coming decades, which will result in lower instream flows.110 \n18  At the same time, as Figure 14 shows, the summer water temperatures for Montana’s rivers \n19  are expected to continue to rise.111  \n20 \n21                                                   \n106 Retreat of Glaciers in Glacier National Park, supra note 101.  \n22  107 Id.  \n108 Id.  \n109 Andrew J.

As a result of ecosystem disruption, including drought conditions and wildfires, \n16 \nboating and fishing are being adversely impacted and certain rivers, or stretches of rivers, \n17  and fisheries have been closed.112 Montana has adopted a drought fishing closure policy to \n18  determine when closures are necessary.113 Low river flows and high water temperatures, \n19 \nboth directly linked to climate disruption, are conditions that lead to closures. As a result \n20 \nof impacts to Montana’s wildlife and outdoor economy, approximately 11,000 jobs and \n21 \n$281 million in income is threatened due to stream closures, lost hunting opportunities, \n22 \n                                                 \n23 \n112 Retreat of Glaciers in Glacier National Park, supra note 101. \n113  Montana  Fish,  Wildlife  &  Parks,  Drought  Fishing  Closure  Policy, \nhttp://fwp.mt.gov/news/drought/closurepolicy.html (last visited Feb. 21, 2020).  \n  67 \n\n \n1  wildfires, and reduced snowpack.114 Youth Plaintiffs’ ability to fish and access rivers has \n2  been impaired due to river and fishery closures due to climate disruptions. For example, \n3  Youth Plaintiffs Mica, Kian, Lander, and Badge have all had their ability to fish limited, \n4  or completely foreclosed in some instanced, due to fishery closures as a result of the \n5  conditions in Montana rivers. Other Youth Plaintiffs, including Eva, Georgi, Lander, and \n6  Badge, have had their access to rivers limited for other recreational activities.   \n7  163.  Yellowstone and Glacier National Park are economic powerhouses for Montana. \n8  Together, the parks receive a combined five million visitor days per year.115 Yellowstone \n9  National Park, the world’s first National Park, spreads into southeastern Montana. In \n10  addition to providing a tourism-based economy, Yellowstone National Park is the heart of \n11  the  Greater  Yellowstone  Ecosystem.116  Ongoing  and  anticipated  impacts  of  climate \n12  disruption on Yellowstone National Park include more extreme hot and cold days, change \n13  to the composition of flora and fauna in the park, and increasing fire frequency, all of which \n14  threatens the continued viability of this national treasure and the ability of Youth Plaintiffs, \n15  including Eva, to continue to access for recreational activities.117 \n16  164.  As Montana temperatures increase, ski areas will have to compete for water rights \n17  or use energy to make snow. The ski season will be shorter and skiers will likely have to \n18  travel farther for snow. Lack of precipitation and declines in snowpack will reduce the ski \n19  and snow mobile industry by an estimated 1,500 jobs and $37 million.118 The rising \n20 \n                                                 \n21  114 Thomas Michael Power, et al., The Impact of Climate Change on Montana’s Outdoor Economy, Montana Wildlife \nFederation, 29 (Dec. 2015), https://montanawildlife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Impact-of-Climate-Change-on-\n22  the-Montana-Outdoor-Economy-Dec-2015-Final-Report.pdf. \n115 Id. at iii. \n116 Andrew J.

Climate disruption is harming Montana’s wildlife. As many as one in six species \n5  are threatened with extinction due to climate disruption. Many more species that do not \n6  face extinction will face changes in abundance, distributions, and species interactions that \n7  cause adverse impacts for ecosystems and humans. Almost two-thirds of common plants \n8  and half of all animals are projected to decline dramatically in population this century as a \n9  result of climate disruption, absent science-based GHG reductions. This has an impact for \n10  wildlife viewing and hunting, and dramatically disrupts the ecology of the state. These \n11  cascading effects of climate disruption will affect children and youth in Montana, including \n12  Youth Plaintiffs. For example, opportunities to view certain animals, like wolverines, may \n13  be lost forever. Pikas are another animal that Youth Plaintiffs, including Mica, enjoy seeing \n14  in the wild that are being adversely impacted by rising temperatures, declining snowpack, \n15  and other climate impacts. Likewise, the ability of Youth Plaintiffs to inherit hunting and \n16  wildlife knowledge from their parents, and to pass that knowledge on to their children is \n17  threatened to be lost forever due to climate disruption.119 \n18  166.  The climate crisis is also having an impact on Montana’s hunting heritage. As \n19  Montana warms, big game, including elk, bighorn sheep, and mountain goats, are moving \n20  to  higher  country,  increasing  difficulty  for  hunters.  Additional,  certain  bird  species, \n21  including grouse, are shifting their ranges north, impacting hunters. Montana’s wildlife is \n22  also adversely impacted by climate impacts such as rising temperatures, drought, increased \n23 \n                                                 \n119 The Impact of Climate Change on Montana’s Outdoor Economy, supra note 114.  \n  69 \n\n \n1  wildfire activity, loss of forest and grassland habitat, declining snowpack, and other climate \n2  impacts. Climate disruption is decreasing the productivity and range of big game and bird \n3  hunting, has led to the closure of public lands previously available for hunting, and leads \n4  to an overall deterioration in the quality of the hunting experience, including for Youth \n5  Plaintiffs Lander and Badge. In turn, the decrease in hunting is resulting in job losses, \n6  costing the state millions, and undermining an important way of life and cultural heritage \n7  for Montanans.120 \n8  167.  These changes are also having an effect on the health of Montana’s fisheries and \n9  relatedly, the angling and sportfishing industries. Estimates include a loss of one-third of \n10  angling days, resulting in a loss of about 1,800 jobs and $49 million to the Montana \n11  economy.121 \n12  168.  Climate disruption is already having a significant impact on Montana’s natural \n13  environment and, as a result, the state’s recreation and tourism industry. Not only does this \n14  effect Youth Plaintiffs’ ability to use and enjoy Montana’s Public Trust Resources, it also \n15  carries implications for the future of the Montana economy as the recreation and tourism \n16  industry  in  Montana  is  responsible  for  between  34,000  (nonresident)  and  89,000 \n17  (nonresident  and  resident)  jobs.  The  tourism  industry  brings  in  between  $1  billion \n18  (nonresident) and $2.3 billion (nonresident and resident) per year to Montana.122  \n19  169.  Rising temperatures and increased droughts in Montana have dried out the forests \n20  and soil, killing trees, increasing the risk of forest fires, and enabling outbreaks of forest \n21  insects.123  \n22 \n                                                 \n120 Id.   \n23 \n121 Id. at vii.  \n122 Id. at v. \n123 What Climate Change Means for Montana, supra note 84.  \n  70 \n\n \n1  170.  Rising temperatures due to climate disruption in Montana disturb the life cycle of \n2  the bark beetle, an insect which kills trees.124 With rising winter temperatures and fewer \n3  freezing days that would normally kill off beetle larva, the bark beetle are living longer, \n4  reproducing faster, and accessing trees at higher elevations that had formerly been resistant \n5  due to the cold temperatures. In Helena, for example, the winters were, on average, 2.6° F \n6  warmer in 2019 than in 1970.125 Since 2000, bark beetles have decimated more than 85,000 \n7  square miles of forest in the western United States—their rapid advance fueled by climate \n8  disruption—with  Montana  experiencing  some  of  the  worst  impacts.126  The  forest \n9  decimation  by  the  bark  beetle  has  massive  impacts  on  Montana’s  logging  industry, \n10  including deterioration in quality of logging products, as well as impacting wildlife habitat, \n11  hunting, and recreation. Youth Plaintiffs Kian, Lander, and Badge have been directly \n12  impacted by pine beetles, which have killed trees on their property and in places they \n13  recreate. \n14  171.  The whitebark pine is an example of an important tree threatened by mountain pine \n15  beetles. The seeds of whitebark pine are an important food for grizzly bears, birds, and \n16  other animals. The whitebark pine is dying out across much of Montana, with the most \n17  serious declines in and near Glacier National Park and the Blackfeet Indian Reservation \n18  and Yellowstone National Park.127 \n19 \n20 \n                                                 \n124  Zeoann  Murphy  &  Chris  Mooney,  Gone  in  A  Generation,  Washington  Post  (Jan.  29,  2019), \n21 \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/gone-in-a-generation/forest-climate-change.html  (updated \nSept. 26, 2019).  \n22  125 Applied Climate Information System, Helena Airport Association Weather Station, http://scacis.rcc-acis.org/; \nZeoann Murphy & Chris Mooney, supra note 124. \n126 Cheryl Katz, Small Pests, Big Problems: The Global Spread of Bark Beetles, Yale Environment 360 (Sept. 21, \n23 \n2017), https://e360.yale.edu/features/small-pests-big-problems-the-global-spread-of-bark-beetles. \n127  Laura  Roady,  Whitebark  Pine,  Montana  Outdoors  (Sept.  2010), \nhttp://fwp.mt.gov/mtoutdoors/HTML/articles/portraits/whitebarkpine.htm. \n  71 \n\n \n1  172.  Montana’s trees provide the crucial function of acting as a “carbon sink,” pulling \n2  CO  from the atmosphere. In the 1990s, Montana’s forests pulled around 20 million tons \n2\n3  of CO  from the atmosphere per year. With the decimation of forests due to the combination \n2\n4  of drought, pest infestations, and wildfires, forests that have been a sink for GHGs may no \n5  longer be able to store as much carbon.128   \n6  173.  Higher temperatures are leading to increased severity, frequency, and extent of \n7  wildfires (see Figure 15).129 Wildfires are expected to get significantly worse in the coming \n8  years without immediate steps to limit global heating (see Figure 16).130 According to \n9  experts, the wildfire season in the western United States is at least 87 days longer than it \n10  was in the 1980s.131 Additionally, the number of large fires (over 1000 acres) has increased \n11  four times and the number of acres burned has increased six times. Aside from the danger \n12  posed to residents–including Youth Plaintiffs–wildfires also impact ecosystems, property, \n13  and livelihoods.132 Increases in fire risk is expected due to prolonged fire seasons from \n14  warmer  temperatures  and  increased  fuel  load.133  In  2017—Montana’s  worst  wildfire \n15  season in more than 100 years in terms of number of acres burned—wildfires cost the state \n16  approximately $70 million.134 In 2018 wildfires cost the state more than $95 million.135 \n17 \n                                                 \n128 Cathy Whitlock et al., supra note 81, at 170. \n18 \n129 Figure prepared with historical incident data from the Northern Rockies Coordination Center, National Interagency \nFire Center, https://gacc.nifc.gov/nrcc/predictive/intelligence/ytd_historical/ytd_historical.htm. \n19  130 National Research Council, Climate Stabilization Targets: Emissions, Concentrations, and Impacts over Decades \nto Millennia 180 (2011). \n131 Expert Report of Steve W.

Numerous Youth Plaintiffs have been directly impacted by the increase in wildfires \n19 \nin Montana. A wildfire near the home of Youth Plaintiffs Lander and Badge forced them \n20 \nto prepare to evacuate, while Youth Plaintiff Rikki’s ranch has been damaged from \n21 \nwildfires, causing economic loses. The smoke from wildfires has limited the ability of \n22 \nYouth Plaintiffs Mica, Georgi, Grace, and Claire to train and compete in sports at a high \n23 \nlevel.  Additionally,  Youth  Plaintiffs  with  asthma  and  other  respiratory  conditions, \n  74 \n\n \n1  including Ruby, Jeffrey, Nate, and Olivia have to limit outdoor activities when it is smoky \n2  as they are uniquely vulnerable to the smoky conditions.  \n3  175.  Fossil fuel extraction and combustion and the resulting climate crisis harms public \n4  health  and  welfare  and  is  already  contributing  to  an  increase  in  asthma,  cancer, \n5  cardiovascular disease, stroke, heat-related morbidity and mortality, food-borne diseases, \n6  and neurological diseases and disorders. Climate disruption also increases occurrence of \n7  infectious diseases, including those spread by mosquitos, ticks, and other pests. Doctors \n8  and  leading  medical  institutions  are  recognizing  the  climate  crisis  as  a  “health \n9  emergency.”138  \n10  176.  There is further risk that as the climate and land use pattern changes, disease vectors \n11  may also move north from southern tropical climates. This could lead to increases in public \n12  health costs, specifically in terms of vaccinations and treatments. Furthermore, Youth \n13  Plaintiffs will be at risk of enduring one or more of these increased health concerns or \n14  diseases, and only a portion of the associated health costs may be picked up by insurance \n15  or  public  assistance.  The  economic  impacts  of  climate  disruption  will  also  lead  to \n16  increasing inequality, as those with financial means are more able to privately bear the \n17  costs of disasters, such as floods and wildfires, while those without financial means will \n18  not. This will impose a greater burden on those less able to pay for the direct, local \n19  consequences of climate disruption.139  \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n138 Caren G.

Children are the Most Vulnerable to the Climate Crisis and Its Dangerous Impacts \n2  177.  All children, even those without pre-existing illness, are considered a “sensitive \n3  population” to the effects of the climate crisis because their bodies are still developing.140 \n4  Air pollution poses severe health risks for Montana’s youth and is shown to impede their \n5  physical  development.  Montana’s  persistent  drought  conditions  and  record  wildfire \n6  seasons have doubled respiratory-related emergency room visits.141 As illustrated in Figure \n7  17, panel (a) below, Montana, in particular western Montana, already experiences some of \n8  the worst wildfire smoke conditions in the United States.142 Unless the climate crisis is \n9  addressed, the smoke conditions in Montana will get significantly worse, with much of \n10  western Montana facing the highest risk factor (Figure 17, panel (b)).   \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n                                                 \n21  140 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency et al., Wildfire Smoke A Guide for Public Health Officials, Montana \nDepartment  of  Environmental  Quality  (revised  May  2016), \n22  http://deq.mt.gov/Portals/112/Air/FireUpdates/Documents/wildfire_may2016.pdf.  \n141 Phil Drake, Gov.

The psychological harms from the climate crisis are acute and chronic and they \n19 \naccrue from impacts such as heat waves, drought conditions, wildfires, air pollution, \n20 \nviolent storms, the loss of wildlife, watching glaciers melt, and the loss of familial and \n21 \ncultural foundations and traditions. Many children, including Youth Plaintiffs Olivia and \n22 \nGrace, experience psychological impacts and are distressed from day to day conditions, \n23 \n  77 \n\n \n1  anxious about the climate crisis, and are unable to alleviate their concerns.143 Youth \n2  Plaintiffs are acutely aware that the window to avoid locking in irreversible climate change \n3  impacts is closing. As climate disruption transforms communities, Youth Plaintiffs and \n4  children are likely to experience a feeling that they are losing a place that is important to \n5  them, which is a phenomenon called solastalgia.144 Solastalgia describes the gripping sense \n6  of existential loss when treasured places are irreparably damaged or destroyed as a result \n7  of human carelessness or willful disregard for them, and can cause profound distress.145 \n8  This captures the way Youth Plaintiff Badge feels when knowing that the area he was \n9  named after is being damaged and degraded due to climate disruption.  \n10  179.  The psychological health effects include elevated levels of anxiety, depression, \n11  post-traumatic stress disorder, increased incidences of suicide, substance abuse, social \n12  disruptions like increased violence, and a distressing sense of loss. The psychological \n13  harms caused by the climate crisis can result in a lifetime of hardships for children. \n14  180.  Importantly,  there  can  be  prompt  redress  for  Youth  Plaintiffs’  psychological \n15  injuries with declaratory and/or injunctive relief. If the Court granted declaratory relief, it \n16  would help redress Youth Plaintiffs psychological injuries by making it clear that their \n17  fears were understood by the judiciary and by restoring their confidence that there is \n18  recourse for government conduct that violates their constitutional rights—it would give \n19  them hope and restore their confidence in their government. Injunctive relief would also \n20  provide redress for Youth Plaintiffs psychological injuries because they would then know \n21 \n22 \n                                                 \n143 Expert Report of Lise Van Susteren, Juliana v.

The physiological features of children make them disproportionately vulnerable to \n4  the impacts of the climate crisis and air pollution. Perhaps most important, their organs, \n5  such as lungs and brain, are still developing, which makes youth more vulnerable to \n6  environmental stresses, pollution, and injuries. Children breathe in more air per unit time \n7  than adults and consume more food and water proportional to their body weight, making \n8  them more susceptible to polluted or contaminated air, water, or food.146 The behavior of \n9  children, which includes spending more time recreating outside and having a harder time \n10  self-regulating, also makes them more vulnerable to excess heat, poor air quality, and other \n11  climate impacts. Childhood exposure to climate disruptions and air pollution can result in \n12  impaired physical and cognitive development with life-long consequences.  \n13  182.  Children are particularly vulnerable to climate change-related diseases. The vast \n14  majority (approximately 88%) of current sufferers of diseases due to climate disruption are \n15  children.147  Allergies  are  highly  prevalent  among  children  and  climate  disruption \n16  exacerbates allergy symptoms, including asthma. An increase in these symptoms can affect \n17  children’s  physical  and  psychological  health  by  interfering  with  sleep,  play,  school \n18  attendance, and performance. Certain categories of children are especially vulnerable to \n19  climate change impacts and air pollution, for example, children that have pre-existing \n20  medical conditions, such as Youth Plaintiffs Jeffrey and Nate, as well as children that are \n21  economically disadvantaged or from minority populations, including indigenous peoples. \n22 \n                                                 \n23 \n146 Wildfire Smoke A Guide for Public Health Officials, supra note 140.  \n147 World Health Organization (WHO), Quantitative Risk Assessment of the Effects of Climate Change on Selected \nCauses of Death, 2030s and 2050s, 48 (Simon Hales, et al., eds., 2014). \n  79 \n\n \n1  183.  The adverse impacts of the climate crisis and air pollution on the physical and \n2  mental health of children can result in life-long challenges and consequences (see Figure \n3  18).148 The climate crisis is limiting children’s potential for development and inhibiting \n4  their opportunity to engage in Montana’s most important institutions and heritage.  \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16   \nFigure 18: The adverse impacts of climate disruption on children start before they are \n17 \nborn and have lifelong impacts. \n \n18 \n184.  Children also face barriers to family formation as a result of the climate crisis. For \n19 \nexample, increasingly children, including Youth Plaintiffs Olivia and Grace, are expressing \n20 \nthat they do not want to have children of their own because they fear the world that their \n21 \nchildren would grow up in. Children, including Youth Plaintiffs Rikki and Kian, also face \n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n148 Susan E.

Other  children  are  experiencing  forced  re-\n3  location and the loss of ties to the land, including Youth Plaintiffs Eva, Lander, and Badge. \n4  All of these impacts disproportionately impact children, are the consequence of matters \n5  beyond their control that they are not responsible for causing, and will impose a lifetime \n6  of hardships.    \n7  DEFENDANTS’ LONGSTANDING KNOWLEDGE  \nOF THE DANGERS OF AIR POLLUTION AND CLIMATE DISRUPTION AND \n8  AUTHORITY TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS \n9  185.  Montana has known of, but refused to act on, the dangerous impacts of air pollution \n10  and climate disruption for over 50 years. In 1968, the Montana Department of Health held \n11  the conference “A Montana Strategy for a Livable Environment” at the Montana House of \n12  Representatives, during which state representatives and agencies, professors, and scientists \n13  explicitly  warned  of  the  impacts  of  air  pollution  and  GHG  emissions  into  the \n14  atmosphere.149 The findings expressed at the conference were to serve as a guide to state \n15  agencies.  \n16  186.  The state conference proceedings produced a report on its findings, which found \n17  that— \n18  [d]ue to excessive combustion not being counterbalanced by vegetational \ncarbon fixation, it is estimated that by the year 2,000 our atmosphere will \n19  contain 50% more CO2 than at present. The new total seems insignificant. \nHowever,  the  temperature  regulating  effect  of  CO   is  tremendous. \n2\n20  Conceivably then, our world will be warmer. This sounds enticing at first \nglance, but from a biological equilibrium standpoint it could spell disaster. \n21  As we realize, the ideal endpoint of complete combustion is CO2 + water. \nThus it is predictable that if CO  production increases at present rates, we \n2\n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n149 Montana Department of Health, A Montana Strategy for a Livable Environment: Conference Proceedings, 1 (Sep. \n15, 1969), https://ia800907.us.archive.org/15/items/montanastrategyf1968mont/montanastrategyf1968mont.pdf. \n  81 \n\n \n1  will encounter a WATER problem resulting from enough glacial melting to \neven inundate some coastal cities—like smoggy Los Angeles.150  \n2   \nThe state report determined that waste is produced faster than can be recycled and that \n3 \n“our atmosphere is a prime receptacle for much of this waste,” and found that, although \n4 \nair is “mandatory for the life process,” our “air resource is finite.” \n5 \n187.  In 1972, the State of Montana held a Constitutional Convention, during which \n6 \ndelegates  placed  significant  emphasis  on  adding  a  natural  resources  article  to  the \n7 \nConstitution that would protect and improve the environment of Montana. In introducing \n8 \nthe  majority  committee  report  of  the  Natural  Resources  Committee  of  the  1972 \n9 \nConstitutional Convention, Delegate C.B. McNeil stated: \n10 \n[t]he committee recommends the strongest environmental section of any \n11  state constitution. It is the only constitutional provision with an affirmative \nduty  to  enhance  the  environment  [.  .  .]  It  provides  that  the  term \n12  environmental life-support system is all encompassing, including but not \nlimited to air, water and land. And whatever interpretation is afforded this \n13  phrase by the legislature and the courts, there is no question that it cannot \nbe degraded.151 \n14   \nLikewise, aware of the dangers of air pollution, Delegate Harper testified: \n15   \nI do not believe that we are in a time when business as usual will get the job \n16  done. I do not subscribe to the theory that everything is going along just fine \nand if we do not change any present laws or present attitudes or present \n17  actions, that everything is going to turn out all right [. . .] every intelligent \ncitizen  is  alarmed,  and  duly  alarmed,  at  what  is  happening  to  the \n18  environmental life system in this world today. 152  \n \n19  188.  As  evidenced  by  its  transcripts,  it  was  the  intention  of  the  Constitutional \n20  Convention to adopt the strongest constitutional environmental provisions because the \n21  delegates were concerned of the irreparable harm of continued pollution and degradation \n22 \n                                                 \n150 Id. at 15. \n23 \n151 Montana Constitutional Convention 1971-1972 Verbatim Transcript Vol. IV, supra note 1 at 1200.  \n152  Montana  Constitutional  Convention  1971-1972  Verbatim  Transcript  Vol.  V,  at  1217  (Mar.  1,  1972), \nhttps://courts.mt.gov/portals/189/library/mt_cons_convention/vol5.pdf. \n  82 \n\n \n1  of the Montana environment, including the atmosphere, waters, and lands.153 Delegate \n2  Burkhardt noted, “[n]othing is as important that we will do here as guarantee the future of \n3  our citizens, and those who come from all over this country and the world, to enjoy the \n4  sense of cleanliness and the health of our environment in Montana.”154  \n5  189.  The  1972  Constitutional  Convention  also  made  clear  that  the  delegates  were \n6  concerned about protecting Montana’s natural environment for their children and future \n7  generations. For example, Delegate Champoux stated, “I love Montana; this is why I’m \n8  here. And I hope it remains the way it is today, because I want it to be like this for my \n9  children.”155 Delegate Bugbee added, “[a]nd I’d just like each of you to question yourselves \n10  about your own children, your own grandchildren, and your own great-grandchildren, and \n11  I submit to you that we are using something right now that belongs to them. We’re using \n12  their land, and we’re using their air, and we’re using their water; and we have no right to \n13  do this. We have no right to take it from them . . . .”156 \n14  190.  In 1989, Montana Senator Max Baucus157 testified before the federal Senate on the \n15  perils of “global climate change.”158 Referring to the available climate science, he warned \n16  that “we can probably not afford to wait until all of the uncertainties have been resolved \n17  before we do act. Time will not make the problem go away.”159 Senator Baucus urged that \n18  prudent steps be taken to address climate change, and criticized the federal government’s \n19  failure to act on climate, as well as for altering James Hansen’s congressional testimony \n20 \n                                                 \n153 Montana Constitutional Convention 1971-1972 Verbatim Transcript Vol. IV, supra note 1 at 1200.

In 2005, then-Governor Brian Schweitzer directed Defendant DEQ to establish a \n6  Climate Change Advisory Committee (“CCAC”). The then-DEQ director Richard Opper \n7  appointed 18 Montana citizens to the CCAC, which was also supported by scientific \n8  experts, technical and policy experts, and DEQ staff.161  \n9  192.  As part of the CCAC initiative, Montana’s GHG emissions were inventoried in \n10  2007, at which time inventories were estimated for each year from 2007 to 1990.162 \n11  Defendant DEQ published the GHG inventory report in 2007.163  \n12  193.  In 2007, the final report of the Governor’s Climate Change Advisory Committee \n13  was  released,  which  included  Montana’  GHG  emissions  inventory  and  54  policy \n14  recommendations that were designed to reduce Montana’s GHG emissions to 1990 levels \n15  by 2020.164  \n16  194.  In 2007, the Montana legislature commissioned the Environmental Quality Council \n17  to produce a report on climate change in Montana, which it published in 2008.165 The report \n18 \n19                                                   \n160 Id. \n161 Montana Climate Change Action Plan: Final Report of the Governor’s Climate Change Advisory Committee, supra \n20 \nnote 28 at EX-1. \n162 Id.  \n21  163 See generally Alison Bailie, et al., Montana Greenhouse Gas Inventory and Reference Case Projections 1990-\n2020,  Center  for  Climate  Strategies  (CCS)  (Sep.  2007), \n22  https://deq.mt.gov/Portals/112/Energy/ClimateChange/Documents/GreenhouseGasInventory.pdf.  \n164 Montana Climate Change Action Plan: Final Report of the Governor’s Climate Change Advisory Committee, supra \nnote 28 at EX-1. \n23 \n165 Sonja Nowakowski, An Analysis of Climate Change Policy Issues in Montana: A Report to the 61st Legislature, \nEnvironmental  Quality  Council  (EQC)  (2008), \nhttps://leg.mt.gov/content/Publications/Environmental/2008climatechange.pdf.  \n  84 \n\n \n1  suggests the early adoption of cost-effective measures to reduce Montana’s greenhouse gas \n2  emissions.166 These included, but are not limited to, laws to increase building energy \n3  efficiency standards, programs to incentivize weatherization and energy efficiency for low-\n4  income Montanans, and laws to promote Montana’s local economy.167 \n5  195.  These  reports  make  clear  that  Defendants  have  been  aware  of  Montana’s \n6  contributions to anthropogenic climate change for decades and of readily available options \n7  to reduce the State’s reliance on fossil fuels and GHG emissions. \n8  196.  Despite knowledge of the dangers posed by fossil fuels and climate disruption and \n9  the readily available policies to reduce the State’s reliance on fossil fuels, in 2011, \n10  Montana’s State Energy Policy was amended to explicitly promote fossil fuels as an energy \n11  source for Montana.  \n12  197.  Testimony by Senator Ron Erickson regarding the State Energy Policy reveals that \n13  the dangers of climate change were specifically raised as reasons for not to amending the \n14  State Energy Policy to call for the explicit promotion of fossil fuels. Senator Erickson stated \n15  before the full Senate that the bill ignored the fact that global climate change is occurring \n16  and that “[Montana] ought to be a part of the solution as this nation moves ahead.”168 \n17  Notwithstanding concerns raised about climate change, and the available of reliable and \n18  cheap sources of renewable energy, the State Energy Policy was amended in 2011 to \n19  explicitly promote fossil fuels as an energy source for Montana.  \n20 \n21 \n22                                                   \n166 Id. at 1.  \n167 Id.  \n23 \n168 Senate Floor Session: Hearing on SB 305 Revise Energy Policy, 62nd Cong. 492, 13:10:12 – 13:11:03 (Feb. 22, \n2011),  http://sg001-harmony.sliq.net/00309/Harmony/en/PowerBrowser/PowerBrowserV2/20170221/-\n1/21606?agendaId=98099. \n  85 \n\n \n1  198.  Conversely, numerous efforts to pass climate change related legislation in Montana \n2  have failed, with the legislation never making it out of committee.169  \n3  199.  State government officials continue to be aware of the perils of runaway climate \n4  change. Governor Bullock recently issued an executive order creating a Montana Climate \n5  Solutions Council (“Council’) to prepare the state for the impacts of climate change.170 \n6  According to the executive order, “[c]limate change poses a serious threat to Montana’s \n7  natural resources, public health, communities, and economy.” However, the executive \n8  order neither directs any state agencies to actually reduce GHG emissions, nor does it direct \n9  the Council to tailor its plan to the best available climate science. Moreover, the executive \n10  order explicitly states that the Council should consider ways to safeguard existing energy \n11  assets (which are primarily fossil fuel based). There is no indication that the executive order \n12  will  actually  lead  to  any  reduction  in  Montana’s  GHG  emissions,  which  is  further \n13  supported by the fact that the Council should cease to exist by August 1, 2020.  \n14  200.  On February 11, 2020, the Council released the Montana Climate Solutions Plan: \n15  Preliminary Recommendation and Key Questions, which once again simply includes a \n16  series  of  “recommendations”  to  address  climate  change  adaptation  and  reducing \n17  GHG  emissions.171  Even  assuming  arguendo  all  the  “recommendations”  were  fully \n18  implemented, which the Governor’s Executive Order does not require, the preliminary plan \n19  fails to delineate how much Montana’s GHG emissions would be reduced, let alone \n20  demonstrate that it would bring the State Energy Policy into constitutional compliance. \n21 \n                                                 \n22  169 See, e.g., H.J. 60, 60th Leg.

The  best  available  science  today  prescribes  that  global  atmospheric  CO  \n2\n3 \nconcentrations must be restored to no more than 350 ppm by 2100 (with further reductions \n4 \nthereafter) in order to stabilize Earth’s energy balance and restore the climate system on \n5 \nwhich human life depends. A global emission reduction and sequestration pathway back to \n6 \n350 ppm by 2100 would stabilize long-term global heating at no more than 1° C above pre-\n7 \nindustrial temperatures, with a short-term peak of approximately 1.3° C as a global average. \n8 \nEach government has an obligation to contribute to the requisite CO  emission reductions \n2\n9 \nand CO  sequestration. \n2\n10 \n202.  More than 45 eminent scientists from over 40 different institutions have published \n11 \nin peer-reviewed journals finding that the maximum level of atmospheric CO  consistent \n2\n12 \nwith  protecting  humanity  and  other  species  is  350  ppm  and  no  one,  including  the \n13 \nIntergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (“IPCC”),  has  published  any  scientific \n14 \nevidence to counter that 350 ppm is the maximum safe concentration of CO .172 \n2\n15 \n203.  Two steps are required to reduce the atmospheric CO  concentration to 350 ppm by \n2\n16 \n2100:  (1)  reducing  CO   emissions;  and  (2)  sequestering  excess  CO   already  in  the \n2 2\n17 \natmosphere. There are various pathways to reduce the atmospheric CO  concentration to \n2\n18 \n350 ppm by 2100. For example, if CO  emissions were reduced globally, on average, by \n2\n19 \n20 \n                                                 \n172 James Hansen et al., Target Atmospheric CO : Where Should Humanity Aim?, 2 The Open Atmospheric Science \n2\n21 \nJournal 217 (2008); James Hansen et al., Assessing “Dangerous Climate Change”: Required Reduction of Carbon \nEmissions to Protect Young People, Future Generations and Nature, 8 PloS one e81648 (2013); James Hansen et al., \n22  Ice Melt, Sea Level Rise and Superstorms: Evidence From Paleoclimate Data, Climate Modeling, and Modern \nObservations That 2ºC Global Warming Could Be Dangerous, 16 Atmospheric Chemistry 3761 (2016); James Hansen \net al., Young People’s Burden: Requirement of Negative CO  Emissions, 8 Earth Syst. Dynam. 577 (2017); J.E.N. \n23  2\nVeron. et al., The Coral Reef Crisis: The Critical Importance of <350 ppm CO , 58 Marine Pollution Bulletin 1428 \n2\n(2009); K. Frieler, et al., Limiting global warming to 2 ◦C is unlikely to save most coral reefs, 3 Nature Climate Change \n165 (2013). \n  87 \n\n \n1  10.9% per year, beginning in 2020, 100 gigatons (equivalent to 100 billion metric tons) of \n2  CO would need to be sequestered globally by 2100 through improved land management \n2 \n3  practices and protection of forests and soils. Alternatively, if CO  emission reductions of \n2\n4  6% per year began in 2021, 153 gigatons of CO  would need to be sequestered globally by \n2\n5  2100 through improved land management practices and protection of forests and soils to \n6  reach 350 ppm by 2100.  \n7  204.  Importantly, for every additional year of delay, it becomes that much more difficult \n8  to reach 350 ppm by 2100. Research indicates 153 gigatons of CO  is approaching the \n2\n9  upper limit of natural carbon sequestration potential globally, meaning if global emissions \n10  peak after 2021, achieving 350 ppm by 2100 will almost certainly require extremely \n11  expensive  technological  methods  of  carbon  sequestration.  At  some  point  in  time, \n12  governments’  ability  to  return  to  safe  CO   concentrations  will  become  physically \n2\n13  impossible for hundreds of years to come.  \n14  205.  These emission reduction pathways reflect the global average emission reductions \n15  required to remedy the current climate emergency and stabilize the climate system. While \n16  Montana  cannot  on  its  own  achieve  the  GHG  emission  reduction  and  sequestration \n17  measures needed to restore the entirety of Earth’s energy imbalance and stop dangerous \n18  climate disruption entirely, there are multiple feasible pathways to reduce Montana’s \n19  emissions in line with what is required to protect Youth Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. If \n20  Montana acts to reduce emissions and enhance natural sequestration, it will at minimum \n21  reduce the risks of harm to these children by slowing the ongoing heating. Action to reduce \n22  emissions today also keeps the achievement of long-term safety a realistic possibility. \n23  Regardless of the pathway Defendants choose to reduce emissions, emission reductions \n  88 \n\n \n1  should be consistent with the global average emission reductions required to return the \n2  global atmospheric CO  concentration to 350 ppm by the end of the century.  \n2\n3  206.  Critically,  non-fossil  fuel-based  energy  systems  across  all  sectors,  including \n4  electricity generation and transportation systems, are currently economically feasible and \n5  technologically available to employ in Montana.173  \n6  207.  Experts have already concluded the feasibility of, and prepared a roadmap for, the \n7  transition  of  Montana’s  all-purpose  energy  systems  (for  electricity,  transportation, \n8  heating/cooling, and industry) to a 100% renewable portfolio by 2050, which, in addition \n9  to direct climate benefits, will create jobs, reduce air pollution, and save lives and costs \n10  associated with air pollution. \n11  208.  Opportunities  to  sequester  carbon  through  improved  land  use  practices  are \n12  technically and economically feasible. For example, improved forestry and agricultural \n13  practices, such as improved stand management, avoiding tillage with no-till technology, \n14  adding winter cover crops to avoid bare soil, diversifying crop rotation, growing perennial \n15  grasses or trees on degraded soils, and increasing plant productivity on pastures and \n16  rangeland, can provide a net drawdown of atmospheric CO , helping to return to safe levels \n2\n17  of atmospheric CO or preventing the additional accumulation of dangerous CO . \n2  2\n18  209.  Any reduction in GHG emissions that results from a declaration that Montana’s \n19  fossil fuel-based energy system is unconstitutional and an order directing Defendants to \n20  bring  the  energy  system  into  constitutional  compliance  would  help  redress  Youth \n21 \n22                                                   \n173 See, e.g., Clean Energy Transition Institute, Meeting the Challenge of Our Time: Pathways to a Clean Energy \nFuture for the Northwest: An Economy-Wide Deep Decarbonization Pathways Study (2019); Evolved Energy \n23 \nResearch, Northwest Deep Decarbonization Study (2019); Mark Z. Jacobson, et al., 100% Clean and Renewable Wind, \nWater, and Sunlight (WWS) All-Sector Energy Roadmaps for the 50 United States, 8 Energy & Environmental Science \n2093, 2111 (2015). \n  89 \n\n \n1  Plaintiffs’ injuries because the amount of additional GHG emissions emitted into the \n2  climate system in the near-term will dictate the severity of the heating, the severity of Youth \n3  Plaintiffs injuries, and whether Youth Plaintiffs and future generations can survive. The \n4  theory of “perfect substitution” or “leakage” under which it is assumed that limiting \n5  production of fossil fuels in one place will never limit consumption or affect emissions \n6  because another source somewhere else will always step in to substitute for the missing \n7  production, has been shown to be false and contrary to basic supply and demand economic \n8  principles.  \n9  210.  Protecting Youth Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights and Montana’s environment and \n10  natural resources from the climate crisis would save billions of dollars in costs to be borne \n11  by Montanans both now and in the future. The costs of climate change mitigation are far \n12  smaller than the costs of the damage that climate change could inflict. Renewable energy \n13  systems are readily available and feasible to employ in Montana and are already cost-\n14  competitive with all fossil fuel energy sources and significantly cheaper than coal. As \n15  renewable energy technologies continue to improve and the efficiency increases, renewable \n16  energy sources will be significantly cheaper than fossil fuel energy sources in the coming \n17  years. If fossil fuel externalities (i.e., the costs of their pollution that are borne by the public) \n18  are included in the cost of electricity from coal and gas, the cost of renewable energy is \n19  orders of magnitude cheaper.  \n20  CLAIMS \n21  COUNT I—RIGHT TO CLEAN AND HEALTHFUL ENVIRONMENT,  \nINCLUDING THE RIGHT TO A STABLE CLIMATE SYSTEM \n22  (Mont. Const. Art. II, § 3, § 15, § 17, Art. IX, § 1) \n23  211.  Youth Plaintiffs hereby reallege all paragraphs above as if set forth fully herein. \n  90 \n\n \n1  212.  The Montana Constitution provides that, “All persons are born free and have certain \n2  inalienable rights. They include the right to a clean and healthful environment . . . .”  Mont. \n3  Const. Art. II, § 3. Moreover, “In enjoying these rights, all persons recognize corresponding \n4  responsibilities.” Id. Consistent with the provision of these rights and responsibilities the \n5  Montana Constitution further provides that, “The state and each person shall maintain and \n6  improve a clean and healthful environment in Montana for present and future generations.”  \n7  Mont. Const. Art. IX, § 1. As cogently articulated by the Montana Supreme Court: \n8  We conclude, based on the eloquent record of the Montana Constitutional \nConvention that to give effect to the rights guaranteed by Article II, Section \n9  3 and Article IX, Section 1 of the Montana Constitution they must be read \ntogether and consideration given to all of the provisions of Article IX, \n10  Section 1 as well as the preamble to the Montana Constitution. In doing so, \nwe conclude that the delegates’ intention was to provide language and \n11  protections which are both anticipatory and preventative. The delegates did \nnot intend to merely prohibit that degree of environmental degradation \n12  which can be conclusively linked to ill health or physical endangerment. \nOur constitution does not require that dead fish float on the surface of our \n13  state’s rivers and streams before its farsighted environmental protections \ncan be invoked.  \n14   \nMontana Envtl. Info. Ctr. v. Dep’t of Envtl. Quality, 1999 MT 248, ¶ 77, 296 Mont. 207, \n15 \n230, 988 P.2d 1236, 1249. \n16 \n213.  Moreover, eliminating any doubt that these farsighted anticipatory and preventative \n17 \nprovisions can be invoked by the Youth Plaintiffs, the Montana Constitution further \n18 \nprovides that, “The rights of persons under 18 years of age shall include, but not be limited \n19 \nto, all the fundamental rights of this Article unless specifically precluded by laws which \n20 \nenhance the protection of such persons.” Mont. Const. Art. II, § 15.   \n21 \n214.  At its most fundamental level, a clean and healthful environment includes and \n22 \nrequires a stable climate system capable of sustaining human life and liberties. The “quality \n23 \nof life, equality of opportunity and the blessings of liberty for this and future generations,” \n  91 \n\n \n1  which the Montana Constitution enshrines all, depend upon a stable climate system. \n2  Without a stable climate system there is no clean and healthful environment—and Montana \n3  as we know it would cease to exist. \n4  215.  Montana’s clean and healthful environment provides an essential life support \n5  system and is necessary in order for Youth Plaintiffs to be able to enjoy their lives and \n6  liberties. A clean and healthful environment is one that is free from dangerous levels of \n7  anthropogenic CO  and other GHG emissions. Montana’s constitutional right to a clean \n2\n8  and healthful environment prohibits environmental degradation that causes ill health or \n9  physical endangerment and unreasonable depletion or degradation of the state’s natural \n10  resources. \n11  216.  Defendants, by and through their implementation of the State Energy Policy, Mont. \n12  Code  Ann.  §  90-4-1001(c)-(g),  including  the  aggregate  acts  of  Defendants  that \n13  affirmatively authorize fossil fuel production, consumption, and combustion resulting in \n14  dangerous levels of GHGs described herein, and MEPA’s Climate Change Exception, are \n15  unconstitutionally depleting and degrading Montana’s environment and natural resources \n16  and causing and contributing to the dangerous destabilization of the climate system, \n17  thereby depriving the Youth Plaintiffs of their constitutionally guaranteed rights under the \n18  Montana Constitution Article II, Sections 3, 15, 17, and Article IX, Section 1. \n19  217.  Regarding the Youth Plaintiffs’ right to a clean and healthful environment, the \n20  Montana Supreme Court has further instructed that “as to any statute or rule which \n21  implicates that right must be strictly scrutinized and can only survive scrutiny if the State \n22  establishes a compelling state interest and that its action is closely tailored to effectuate \n23  that interest and is the least onerous path that can be taken to achieve the State’s objective.”  \n  92 \n\n \n1  Montana Envtl. Info. Ctr. v. Dep’t of Envtl. Quality, 1999 MT 248, ¶ 63. There is no \n2  interest, compelling or otherwise, that justifies Defendants’ deprivation of Youth Plaintiffs’ \n3  fundamental  right  to  a  clean  and  healthful  environment  “for  present  and  future \n4  generations,” including a stable climate system. Nor is Defendants’ conduct narrowly \n5  tailored to effectuate any such interest. \n6  218.  Youth Plaintiffs have no adequate and speedy remedy to obtain full legal redress \n7  other than to seek declaratory and injunctive relief in this Court. Youth Plaintiffs lack non-\n8  equitable remedies to restrain Defendants from acting in a manner that violates Youth \n9  Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights under Article II, Sections 3, 15, and 17, and Article IX, \n10  Section 1, of the Montana Constitution.  \n11  COUNT II—RIGHT TO SEEK SAFETY, HEALTH, AND HAPPINESS \n(Mont. Const. Art. II, § 3, § 15, § 17, Art. IX, § 1) \n12 \n219.  Youth Plaintiffs hereby reallege all paragraphs above as if set forth fully herein. \n13 \n220.  Article II, Section 3 of the Montana Constitution guarantees the rights to seek \n14 \nsafety, health, and happiness in all lawful ways to all persons. Article II, Section 17 \n15 \nprovides, “No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of \n16 \nlaw.” Article II, Section 15 specifically extends these rights to persons under 18 years of \n17 \nage. \n18 \n221.  Despite Defendants’ longstanding knowledge of the dangers of fossil fuels and \n19 \nGHG emissions, Defendants continue to perpetuate a State Energy Policy, Mont. Code \n20 \nAnn.  §  90-4-1001(c)-(g),  and  implement  actions  thereunder,  that  unconstitutionally \n21 \ninterfere with Youth Plaintiffs safety, health, and happiness. Furthermore, under the \n22 \nClimate Change Exception to MEPA, Mont. Code Ann. § 75-1-201(2)(a), Defendants have \n23 \n  93 \n\n \n1  failed to disclose the climate impacts of their state-sponsored projects and state actions \n2  including climate impacts to children’s safety, health, and happiness.   \n3  222.  Defendants’ conduct dangerously deprives the Youth Plaintiffs of their rights under \n4  Article  II,  Section  3  to  seek  safety,  health,  and  happiness  because  it  exposes  these \n5  vulnerable children to physical injury and disease; serious psychological, social, and \n6  spiritual harm and trauma; interferes with their capacity for growth and development; and \n7  threatens their personal security and family life, all in violation of Youth Plaintiffs rights \n8  under Article II, Section 17. \n9  223.  Pursuant to and in furtherance of Defendants’ State Energy Policy, Defendants have \n10  acted,  and  continue  to  act,  affirmatively  to  place  Youth  Plaintiffs  in  a  position  of \n11  foreseeable danger, with deliberate indifference to their safety, health, and happiness.  \n12  224.  Defendants’ continue to place Youth Plaintiffs in a position of danger, violating \n13  their rights to seek safety, health, and happiness, by failing to implement readily available \n14  laws, policies, plans, and laws for climate stabilization, or any other comprehensive \n15  remedial measures that would protect Youth Plaintiffs’ safety, health, and happiness. \n16  Although Defendants have longstanding, actual knowledge of the substantial risk of harm \n17  to Youth Plaintiffs, Defendants have not taken necessary or feasible steps to address, \n18  ameliorate, and/or reduce the risk of such harm.   \n19  225.  There is no interest, compelling or otherwise, that justifies Defendants’ deprivation \n20  of Youth Plaintiffs’ fundamental rights to due process and to seek safety, health, and \n21  happiness in all lawful ways. Nor is Defendants’ conduct narrowly tailored to effectuate \n22  any such interest. \n23 \n  94 \n\n \n1  226.  Youth Plaintiffs have no adequate speedy remedy to obtain full legal redress other \n2  than to seek declaratory and injunctive relief in this Court. Youth Plaintiffs lack non-\n3  equitable remedies to restrain Defendants from acting in a manner that violates Youth \n4  Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights under Article II, Sections 3, 15, and 17, and Article IX, \n5  Section 1 of the Montana Constitution.  \n6  COUNT III—INDIVIDUAL DIGNITY AND EQUAL PROTECTION  \n(Mont. Const. Art. II, § 4, § 15) \n7 \n227.  Youth Plaintiffs hereby reallege all paragraphs above as if set forth fully herein. \n8 \n228.  The dignity clause of Article II, Section 4 commands that, “The dignity of the \n9 \nhuman being is inviolable. No person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws.” As \n10 \nthe Montana Supreme Court has instructed:  \n11 \nArticle II, Section 15 provides: ‘Rights of persons not adults. The rights of \n12  persons under 18 years of age shall include, but not be limited to, all the \nfundamental rights of this Article unless specifically precluded by laws \n13  which enhance the protections of such persons.’ This section must be read \nin conjunction with the guarantee of equal protection found in Article II, \n14  Section 4. The report of the Bill of Rights Committee of the Constitutional \nConvention indicates that one of the primary purposes of Article II, Section \n15  15 was to remedy the fact that minors had not been accorded full recognition \nunder the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution.  \n16   \nMatter of S.L.M., 287 Mont. 23, 951 P.2d 1365 (1997) (citing Montana Constitutional \n17 \nConvention, Vol. II at 635–36). \n18 \n229.  The State Energy Policy, Mont. Code Ann. § 90-4-1001(c)-(g), the MEPA Climate \n19 \nChange Exception, and aggregate acts taken by Defendants described herein, have violated \n20 \nand continue to violate the fundamental rights of Youth Plaintiffs to individual dignity \n21 \nunder Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution. Defendants’ conduct deprives \n22 \nYouth  Plaintiffs  of  “the  moral  right  and  moral  responsibility  to  confront  the  most \n23 \nfundamental questions about the meaning and value of their own lives and the intrinsic \n  95 \n\n \n1  value of life in general, answering to their own consciences and convictions,” which the \n2  Montana Supreme Court has described as the hallmark of individual dignity. Armstrong v. \n3  State, 1999 MT 261 ¶ 72, 296 Mont. 361, 989 P.2d 364 (1999). \n4  230.  The Defendants have demeaned the “worth and [] basic humanity” of Youth \n5  Plaintiffs by infringing on their ability to freely and meaningfully practice their cultural \n6  and spiritual beliefs.  \n7  231.  Children and youth hold the same constitutional rights as adults yet their political \n8  powerlessness,  unique  physiological  characteristics  and  vulnerabilities,  and  lack  of \n9  autonomy and dependency on caregivers render children and youth more vulnerable to \n10  rights violations. Children and youth are at a critical development stage in life, as their \n11  capacities evolve and their physiological and psychological maturity develops more rapidly \n12  than at any other time in life.  \n13  232.  These immutable characteristics of children and youth place Youth Plaintiffs in a \n14  separate suspect, or quasi-suspect, class in need of extraordinary protection pursuant to the \n15  principles of equal protection.  \n16  233.  Children  and  youth,  as  a  suspect  class,  historically  are  saddled  with  such \n17  disabilities, subjected to purposeful unequal treatment, and relegated to such position of \n18  political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from majoritarian political \n19  process.  \n20  234.  For purposes of the present action, Youth Plaintiffs should be treated as a protected \n21  class. Youth Plaintiffs will continue to disproportionately experience the catastrophic \n22  impacts of a destabilized climate. Adults will not experience the harms to the extent \n23  experienced by Youth Plaintiffs because youth are disproportionately vulnerable to the \n  96 \n\n \n1  irreversible impacts of the climate crisis and the worst impacts of climate disruption caused \n2  by Defendants’ aggregate acts today will occur in the future. Youth Plaintiffs are the living \n3  generation that will be most affected by the actions of Defendants. \n4  235.  Defendants’ State Energy Policy also discriminates against Youth Plaintiffs’ in the \n5  exercise of their fundamental and inalienable constitutional rights to a clean and healthful \n6  environment; safety, health, and happiness; individual dignity; and Public Trust Resources. \n7  Defendants’ continue to materially cause and contribute to irreversible climate damage, \n8  infringing  on  Youth  Plaintiffs  fundamental  rights  and  abridging  central  precepts  of \n9  equality. As a result, the harm caused by Defendants has denied Youth Plaintiffs the same \n10  protection of fundamental rights afforded to prior and present generations of adult citizens. \n11  The imposition of this disability serves only to disadvantage and subordinate Youth \n12  Plaintiffs as members of the class of youth and children.  \n13  236.  Defendants’ aggregate acts in perpetuation of the State Energy Policy and the \n14  Climate Change Exception to MEPA reflect a short-term policy to favor the present \n15  generation’s interests to the long-term detriment to Youth Plaintiffs. Montana’s tri-partite \n16  constitutional democratic system of government is designed to check such a dysfunctional \n17  majoritarian outcome and to protect those that are in the minority or are politically \n18  powerless, such as the Youth Plaintiffs who cannot vote, from the tyranny of the majority. \n19  Here,  this  check  is  especially  appropriate  because  irreparable  harm  is  imminent  if \n20  Defendants are not restrained, and Youth Plaintiffs will no longer be able to secure equal \n21  protection of the laws.  \n22  237.  Defendants’ State Energy Policy and the Climate Change Exception to MEPA \n23  discriminate against Youth Plaintiffs as members of the protected class of children and \n  97 \n\n \n1  with respect to Youth Plaintiffs’ fundamental rights, and are not narrowly tailored to serve \n2  a compelling state interest. Similarly, Defendants cannot satisfy intermediate scrutiny or \n3  rational basis review.  \n4  238.  As a result of Defendants’ unlawful State Energy Policy and the Climate Change \n5  Exception to MEPA, Youth Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief in this Court. \n6  Youth  Plaintiffs  suffer  and  will  continue  to  suffer  injury  due  to  Defendants’ \n7  implementation and enforcement of the State Energy Policy, and until Defendants are \n8  restrained.  \n9  COUNT IV—PROTECTION OF MONTANA’S CLEAN AND HEALTHFUL \nENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC TRUST RESOURCES FOR PRESENT AND FUTURE \n10  GENERATIONS \n(Mont. Const. Art. IX, § 1, § 3) \n11 \n239.  Youth  Plaintiffs  hereby  re-allege  and  incorporate  by  reference  each  of  the \n12 \nallegations set forth above. \n13 \n240.  The rights of the public and future generations as beneficiaries under the Public \n14 \nTrust Doctrine are an attribute of sovereignty that predate Montana’s Constitution, they are \n15 \nsecured by the Constitution, and they cannot be abrogated. Montana Coalition for Stream \n16 \nAccess v. Curran, 210 Mont. 38, 682 P.2d 163 (1984); Montana Coalition for Stream \n17 \nAccess v. Hildreth, 211 Mont. 29, 684 P. 2d 1088 (1984). \n18 \n241.  Under Article IX, Section 1(1), “The state and each person shall maintain and \n19 \nimprove a clean and healthful environment in Montana for present and future generations.” \n20 \nLikewise reflecting public trust principles, the Preamble to Montana’s Constitution states \n21 \nthat the Constitution was ordained and established for “this and future generations.” \n22 \n242.  Article IX, Section 1(3) mandates that, “The legislature shall provide adequate \n23 \nremedies for the protection of the environmental life support system from degradation and \n  98 \n\n \n1  provide adequate remedies to prevent unreasonable depletion and degradation of natural \n2  resources.”  At  the  1972  Montana  Constitutional  Convention,  Delegate  C.B.  McNeil \n3  emphasized that: \n4  Subsection 3 mandates the Legislature to provide adequate remedies to \nprotect  the  environmental  life-support  system  from  degradation.  The \n5  committee intentionally avoided definitions, to preclude being restrictive. \nAnd the term ‘environmental life-support system’ is all-encompassing, \n6  including but not limited to air, water and land; and whatever interpretation \nis afforded this phrase by the Legislature and courts, there is no question \n7  that it cannot be degraded.174 \n \n8  243.  Under Article IX, section 3(3), “All surface, underground, flood, and atmospheric \n9  waters within the boundaries of the state are the property of the state for the use of its \n10  people and are subject to appropriation for beneficial uses as provided by law” (emphasis \n11  added). The Montana Supreme Court has recognized this provision as an underpinning of \n12  the  Public  Trust  Doctrine  for  water  rights,  including  atmospheric  waters,  under  the \n13  Montana Constitution. Galt v. Montana, 225 Mont. 142, 731 P.2d 912, 914-15 (1987); see \n14  also, Montana Trout Unlimited v. Beaverhead Water Co., 2011 MT 151, ¶¶ 29, 30, 361 \n15  Mont. 77, 255 P.3d 179. \n16  244.  The nature of the environmental rights and responsibilities provided for by Articles \n17  II and IX cannot be interpreted separately and are applied in tandem.175 Thus, state action \n18  that implicates either will be strictly scrutinized.176 Moreover, Articles II and IX, taken \n19  together  with  Montana’s  common  law,  provide  a  compelling  basis  for  the  Courts’ \n20  recognition of the Public Trust Doctrine over the atmosphere in Montana.  \n21 \n                                                 \n22  174 Larry M. Elison & Fritz Snyder, The Montana State Constitution: A Reference Guide 168 \n(Greenwood Press 2001) (emphasis added); see also Montana Constitutional Convention Proceedings \nvol. 4, 1201 (Mont. Legis. & Legis. Council 1972), http://courts.mt.govlibrary/montanalaws. \n23 \nmcpx. \n175 Montana Envtl. Info. Ctr. v. Dep't of Envtl. Quality, 1999 MT 248, ¶ 77, 296 Mont. 207, 230, 988 P.2d 1236, 1249. \n176 Id.  \n  99 \n\n \n1  245.  Montana’s  Public  Trust  Resources  also  include  those  other  essential  natural \n2  resources  that  are  of  vital  public  concern  to  the  citizens  of  Montana,  including  the \n3  atmosphere (air), fish and wildlife, wetlands, public lands, submerged lands, and the banks \n4  of waters to the high water mark. Public Trust rights, secured by the Public Trust Doctrine, \n5  include the rights of present and future generations to access, use, and enjoy these essential \n6  resources that are protected by Montana’s Public Trust Doctrine. The public’s interest in \n7  using and accessing such vital natural resources includes the rights of navigation, fishing, \n8  hunting, commerce, and recreational uses. The atmosphere is indistinguishably interrelated \n9  with water and there is always water in the atmosphere. Harm to the atmosphere negatively \n10  affects waters, fish and wildlife, wetlands, and public lands.  \n11  246.  The  Public  Trust  Doctrine  requires  all  sovereign  governments,  including \n12  Defendants as trustees, to maintain control, protect, preserve, and prevent substantial \n13  impairment to and waste of Public Trust Resources for the benefit of all Montanans, \n14  including Youth Plaintiffs and future generations of Montanans. Defendants, as trustees, \n15  also have an obligation to refrain from acting in a manner that abdicates control of Public \n16  Trust Resources. \n17  247.  Defendants,  as  trustees,  have  a  duty  to  administer  and  manage  Public  Trust \n18  Resources with loyalty to and in the interest of trust beneficiaries—all present and future \n19  generations of Montanans, including Youth Plaintiffs. As trustees, Defendants have a duty \n20  of impartiality prohibiting them from favoring one class or generation of beneficiaries over \n21  another in the management of Public Trust Resources. Present and future generations are \n22  equally protected classes of beneficiaries under Montana’s Constitution. Defendants have \n23 \n  100 \n\n \n1  a duty of care to exercise appropriate skill, prudence, and caution in managing Public Trust \n2  Resources. \n3  248.  By and through Defendants’ State Energy Policy, Mont. Code Ann. § 90-4-1001(c)-\n4  (g), and the Climate Change Exception to MEPA, as evidenced by and implemented \n5  through  Defendants’  affirmative  aggregate  and  systemic  actions,  Defendants  have \n6  unconstitutionally caused, and continue to cause, the substantial impairment to, and waste \n7  of, Public Trust Resources, including the atmosphere, waters of Montana, fish and wildlife, \n8  and other Public Trust Resources. The dangerous levels of greenhouse gas emissions that \n9  Defendants  have  authorized  to  be  emitted  into  the  atmosphere  have  a  scientifically \n10  demonstrable effect on the Youth Plaintiffs’ ability to use, access, enjoy and navigate the \n11  state’s waters and other Public Trust Resources.  \n12  249.  By and through Defendants’ State Energy Policy, Mont. Code Ann. § 90-4-1001(c)-\n13  (g), and the Climate Change Exception to MEPA, as evidenced by their affirmative \n14  aggregate and systemic actions, Defendants have abdicated control over and alienated \n15  substantial portions and capacities of Public Trust Resources in favor of the short-term \n16  interests of private parties, authorizing those private parties to treat our atmosphere as a \n17  dump for their carbon emissions and profit off of developing Montana’s fossil fuel \n18  resources to the detriment of Youth Plaintiffs and future generations of Montanans. Such \n19  policies, practices, and customs prejudice the Public Trust rights and interests of Youth \n20  Plaintiffs and future generations of beneficiaries in violation of Defendants’ duties of \n21  loyalty, impartiality, and prudence.  \n22  250.  By and through Defendants’ State Energy Policy, Mont. Code Ann. § 90-4-1001(c)-\n23  (g), and the Climate Change Exception to MEPA, as evidenced by their affirmative \n  101 \n\n \n1  aggregate and systemic actions, Defendants have breached their affirmative duty to protect \n2  and improve a clean and healthful environment in Montana—which includes the protection \n3  and improvement of the atmosphere (air) and all essential natural Public Trust Resources—\n4  for  present  and  future  generations  under  Article  IX,  Section  1(1)  of  the  Montana \n5  Constitution.  \n6  251.  As a result of Defendants’ unlawful State Energy Policy, Youth Plaintiffs seek \n7  declaratory and injunctive relief in this Court. Youth Plaintiffs suffer and will continue to \n8  suffer injury due to Defendants’ implementation and enforcement of the State Energy \n9  Policy and the Climate Change Exception to MEPA until Defendants are restrained. \n10  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n11  WHEREFORE, Youth Plaintiffs respectfully requests that this Court grant the following \n12  relief: \n13  1.  Adjudge and declare that the State Energy Policy, Mont. Code Ann. § 90-4-1001(c)-(g), \n14  the aggregate affirmative acts, policies, and conditions taken thereunder, and the Climate \n15  Change Exception to MEPA, Mont. Code Ann. § 75-1-201(2)(a), are in violation of the \n16  following Articles of the Montana Constitution: Article II, Section 3; Article II, Section 4; \n17  Article II, Section 17; Article IX, Section 1; Article IX, Section 3; and the Public Trust \n18  Doctrine; \n19  2.  Adjudge and declare that the State Energy Policy, Mont. Code Ann. § 90-4-1001(c)-(g), is \n20  facially unconstitutional; \n21  3.  Adjudge and declare that the Climate Change Exception to MEPA, Mont. Code Ann. § 75-\n22  1-201(2)(a), is facially unconstitutional;   \n23 \n  102 \n\n \n1  4.  Adjudge and declare that Youth Plaintiffs’ fundamental constitutional right to a clean and \n2  healthful environment includes a stable climate system that sustains human lives and \n3  liberties and that said right is being violated; \n4  If awarded declaratory relief, Youth Plaintiffs respectfully request the Court fashion an \n5  equitable remedy that it deems just and proper, including granting the following equitable \n6  relief: \n7  5.  Permanently enjoin Defendants, their agents, employees and all persons acting in concert \n8  with them, from subjecting Youth Plaintiffs to the State’s Energy Policy, Mont. Code Ann. \n9  § 90-4-1001(c)-(g), the aggregate affirmative acts, policies, and conditions described \n10  herein, and the Climate Change Exception to MEPA, Mont. Code Ann. § 75-1-201(2)(a); \n11  6.  An order requiring Defendants to prepare a complete and accurate accounting of Montana’s \n12  GHG emissions, including those emissions caused by the consumption of fossil fuels \n13  extracted in Montana and consumed out of state, and Montana’s embedded emissions; \n14  7.  An  order  requiring  Defendants  to  develop  a  remedial  plan  or  policies  to  effectuate \n15  reductions of GHG emissions in Montana consistent with the best available science and \n16  reductions  necessary  to  protect  Youth  Plaintiffs’  constitutional  rights  from  further \n17  infringement by Defendants, and to reduce the cumulative risk of harm to those rights; to \n18  submit the remedial plan to the Court by a date certain; and to implement the plan; \n19  8.  An order that, if necessary, a special master or equivalent, with appropriate expertise, be \n20  appointed to assist the Court in reviewing the remedial plan for efficacy;   \n21  9.  An order retaining jurisdiction over this action until such time as Defendants have fully \n22  complied with the orders of this Court, or there are adequate assurances that Defendants \n23  will continue to comply in the future absent continuing jurisdiction; \n  103 \n\n \n1  10. An order awarding Youth Plaintiffs their reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs; and \n2  11. Such further or alternative relief as the Court deems just and equitable. \n3   \n4  Respectfully submitted this 13th day of March, 2020, \n5 \n/s/ Shiloh S. Hernandez \n6  Shiloh S.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, \nAND ORDER \n13 \nSTATE OF MONTANA, et al., \n14 \nDefendant. \n15 \n16 \n17  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n18  On March 13, 2020, sixteen Montana youth (collectively Plaintiffs \n19  or Youth Plaintiffs) filed a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n20  (Doc. 1) against the State of Montana, the Governor, Montana Department of \n21  Environmental Quality, Montana Department of Natural Resources and \n22  Conservation, Montana Department of Transportation, and Montana Public \n23  Service Commission (collectively Defendants or State). Plaintiffs' Complaint \nI \n24  challenged the constitutionality of the State's fossil fuel-based state energy \n25  dystem, which they allege causes and contributes to climate change in violation \n\n1  of their constitutional rights guaranteed under Article II, Section 3; Article II, \n2  Section 4; Article II, Section 15; Article II, Section 17; Article IX, Section 1; \n3  Article IX, Section 3 of the Montana Constitution; and the Public Trust Doctrine. \n4  (Doc. 1 ~~ 3-4). \n5  Specifically, the Complaint challenged the constitutionality of \n6  fossil fuel-based provisions of Montana's State Energy Policy Act, Mont. Code \n7  Ann.§ 90-4-l00l(l)(c)-(g); a provision of the Montana Environmental Policy \n8  Act (MEPA), Mont. Code Ann.§ 75-1-201(2)(a) (MEPA Limitation), which \n9  forbids the State and its agents from considering the impacts of greenhouse gas \n10  (GHG) emissions or climate change in their environmental reviews; and the \n11  4ggregate acts the State has taken to implement and perpetuate a fossil fuel-based \n12  ~nergy system pursuant to these two statutory provisions. \n13  ~Doc. 1 ~~ 4, 105, 108, 118). \nI \n14  I  Youth Plaintiffs asked the Court for a declaration of law \n' \n15  ~onceming their constitutional rights; a declaration of law that the fossil fuel-\n16  based provisions of Montana's State Energy Policy, Mont. Code Ann. \n17  § 90-4-l00l(l)(c)-(g), are unconstitutional; a declaration of law that the MEPA \n18  Limitation is unconstitutional; and a declaration oflaw that Defendants' past and \nI \n19  ongoing affirmative aggregate actions to implement a fossil fuel-based energy \n20  system-carried out in furtherance of the State Energy Policy and perpetuated \n21  through the MEPA   Limitation-are unconstitutional. (Doc. 1, Requests for Relief \n22  # 1-5). The Complaint further requested injunctive relief to enjoin Defendants \n23  from subjecting Plaintiffs to the fossil fuel-based State Energy Policy, Mont. \nI \n24  <Code Ann.§ 90-4-l00l(l)(c)-(g), the MEPA Limitation, and aggregate acts; \n25  drder Defendants to prepare a statewide GHG accounting; order \nI \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 2 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  Defendants to develop a remedial plan to reduce statewide GHG emissions; \n2  retain jurisdiction until Defendants have fully complied with the Court's orders; \n3  and, if necessary, appoint a special master to review the remedial plan for \n4  efficacy. (Doc. 1, Requests for Relief# 6-9). Plaintiffs also requested an order \n5  awarding Youth Plaintiffs their reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, and any \n6  such further or alternative relief as the Court deems just and equitable. (Doc. 1, \n7  Requests for Relief# 10-11). \n8  On April 24, 2020, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant \n9  t,o Mont. R. Civ. P. 12(6)(1), 12(6)(6), and 12(h)(3). (Doc. 11). After briefing and \n10  oral argument, the Court issued an Order on Motion to Dismiss on August 4, \ni \n11  2021, (Doc. 46), partially granting and partially denying Defendants' motion to \n12  dismiss. \n13  The Court found that Plaintiffs' requests for the Court to order \n14  Defendants to develop a remedial plan, to retain jurisdiction over the matter until \n15  Defendants complied with the remedial plan, and, if necessary, appoint a special \n' \n16  master to assist the Court in reviewing the remedial plan exceeded the Court's \n17  authority under the political question doctrine. (Doc. 46 at 21). Nevertheless, the \n18  Court held that prudential standing considerations did not merit dismissal \n19  because the Court \"may grant declaratory relief regardless of injunctive relief. \n20  The court possesses the authority to grant declaratory or injunctive relief, or \n21  both.\" (Doc. 46 at 22). \n22  i  Finally, the Court declined to dismiss Plaintiffs' challenge to \n23  MEPA   for want of administrative exhaustion, finding that \"Youth Plaintiffs \n24  Jroperly brought this action in district court rather than through the \n25  ddministrative review process.\" (Doc. 46 at 24). The Order granted Defendants' \nI \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 3 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  motion with respect to Plaintiffs' Requests for Relief# 6, 7, 8, and 9, and denied \n2  Defendants' motion with respect to Plaintiffs' Requests for Relief# 1, 2, 3, 4, \n3  and 5. \n4  Defendants filed their Answer on September 17, 2021, (Doc. 53), \n5  denying virtually all allegations in the Complaint and raising several affirmative \n6  defenses. \n7  Pursuant to the December 27, 2021, Scheduling Order (Doc. 61), \n8  the parties engaged in discovery throughout 2022. \n9  On May 6, 2022, Defendants filed a Motion for Clarification of \n10  Order on State's Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 60(a), Mont. R. Civ. P. \n11  (Doc. 84), seeking clarification on whether Plaintiffs' Request for Relief# 5 had \n12  been dismissed by the August 04, 2021, Order on Motion to Dismiss. Plaintiffs \n13  filed a Response in Opposition on May 20, 2022. (Doc. 102). \n14  On June 10, 2022, Defendants filed a Petition for Writ of \n15  Supervisory Control (OP 22-0315), requesting the Montana Supreme Court \n16  exercise supervisory control and \"dismiss Request for Relief 5 from this case.\" \n17  On June 14, 2022, the Supreme Court denied the Petition. (OP 22-0315). \n18  On June 15, 2022, the Court issued an Order Partially Granting \n19  Defendants' Motion to Modify Scheduling Order and Setting Scheduling \n20  Conference. (Doc. 145) (Modified Scheduling Order). The Modified \n21  s'cheduling Order governed the timeline thereafter. Pursuant to the Modified \n22  Scheduling Order, the parties engaged in discovery through January 9, 2023 -\n23  including disclosing expert witnesses (Docs. 222, 227), rebuttal expert \nI \n24  Jitnesses (Docs. 240, 242), and conducting dozens of depositions. \n25  Ill// \nI \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 4 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  On June 30, 2022, the Court issued an Order on Defendants' Rule \n2  60(a) Motion for Clarification (Doc. 158), clarifying that \"requests for injunctive \n3  relief contained in the complaint were dismissed, except for Request for Relief \n4  5.\" (Doc. 158 at 3). \n5  On July 19, 2022, Defendants filed a Motion for Independent \n6  Medical Examination, or, in the Alternative, Motion to Strike Opinions and \n7  Testimony of Plaintiffs' Expert Dr. Lise Van Susteren Pursuant to Rule 35(a), \n8  Mont. R. Civ. P. (Doc. 163), alleging that Plaintiffs' allegations of mental health \n9  impacts as a result of climate change had placed their mental health at issue. \n10  (Doc. 163 at 2). On October 14, 2022, the Court issued an Order denying \n11  Defendants' motion (Doc. 225), ruling that IMEs were unwarranted because \n12  \"Plaintiffs have not placed their mental health at the center of this case, nor is it \n13  r,eally and genuinely in controversy,\" (Doc. 225 at 6), and because \"Defendants \n14  Jave not established good cause for the requested examinations.\" (Doc. 225 at 7). \n15  ]  On July 20, 2022, Defendants filed a Second Motion for \n16  Clarification of Order on State's Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 60(a), \n17  Mont. R. Civ. P. (Doc. 167). Defendants' second motion for clarification sought \n18  clarification from the Court as to why Plaintiffs' Requests for Relief# 1, 2, 3, 4, \n19  and 5 \"don't violate the political question doctrine.\" (Doc. 167 at 3). On \n20  September 22, 2022, the Court issued an Order (Doc. 217), denying Defendants' \n21  Second Rule 60(a) Motion for Clarification of Order on State's Motion to \n22  Dismiss. \nI \n23  ]  On September 30, 2022, pursuant to the Modified Scheduling \n24  Qrder, Plaintiffs disclosed their expert witnesses and expert disclosures. (Doc. \n25  222). On October 31, 2022, Defendants disclosed their expert witnesses and \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 5 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  expert disclosures. (Doc. 227). On November 30, 2022, the parties exchanged \n2  rebuttal expert disclosures. (Docs. 239, 242). \n3  Discovery closed on January 9, 2023. Between the parties, \ni \n4  1iscovery included the completion of thirty-six depositions, the exchange of \n5  twenty-two expert reports, the exchange of over 50,000 pages of documents, and \n6  responses to dozens of interrogatories. \n7  On February 1, 2023, Plaintiffs and Defendants file motions in \n8  limine. Plaintiffs filed seven motions in limine (Docs. 260, 262, 264, 266, 268, \n9  270, 272) and Defendants filed seven motions in limine (Docs. 284, 286, 288). \n10  On February 1, 2023, Defendants filed a Motion for Summary \n11  Judgment pursuant to Mont. R. Civ. P. 56. (Doc. 290). On February 14, 2023, \n12  Plaintiffs filed a response brief opposing summary judgment. (Doc. 299). \n13  Plaintiffs filed sixteen declarations from Plaintiffs, experts, and counsel in \n14  support of their response brief. (Docs. 300-315). On February 28, 2023, \n15  Defendants filed a reply. (Doc. 332). \n16  On March 16, 2023, Governor Greg Gianforte signed House Bill \n17  170 into law, repealing the Montana State Energy Policy, Mont. Code Ann. \n18  § 90-4-1001. \n19  On March 31, 2023, Defendants filed a Motion to Partially Dismiss \n20  for Mootness pursuant to Mont. R. Civ. P. 12(6)(1), 12(6)(6), and 12(h)(3). \n21  (Doc. 339). Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims premised on the \n22 \nMontana State Energy Policy Act, Mont. Code Ann. § 90-4-1001, on the ground \n: \n23  that the repeal of Mont. Code Ann.§ 90-4-1001 (HB 170) mooted claims \nI  .  h \n24  concemmg t  e statute. \nI \n25  //Ill \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 6 \nCDV-2020-307 \nI \n\n1  On April 14, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Response Brief in Opposition \n2  to Defendants' Motion to Partially Dismiss for Mootness. (Doc. 354). Plaintiffs \n3  filed nine declarations from experts in support of their response. (Docs. 355-363). \n4  On April 26, 2023, unable to reach agreement on a joint proposed \n5  Pre-Trial Order, the parties submitted separate proposed pre-trial orders. (Docs. \n6  366, 367). On April 27, 2023, a Final Pre-Trial Conference was held with the \n7  Court. \n8  In response to Judge Moses' April 6, 2023, Order on Summary \n9  Judgment in MEIC, et al. v.  DEQ, et al., Yellowstone County Cause No. \n10  DV-56-2021-1307, the Montana Legislature adopted House Bill 971, an \n11  amendment to clarify the MEPA Limitation. On May 10, 2023, Governor Greg \n12  Gianforte signed into law HB 971, which clarified Mont. Code Ann. \n13  § 75-1-201(2)(a). The clarifications in HB 971 explicitly prohibit Montana's \n14  agencies from considering \"an evaluation of greenhouse gas emissions and \n15  corresponding impacts to the climate in the state or beyond the state's borders\" in \n16  their MEPA   reviews. \nI \n17  On May 12, 2023, the Court heard oral argument on Defendants' \n18  I\\fotions for Summary Judgment, Motion to Partially Dismiss for Mootness, and \n19  Motion to Stay Proceedings. \n20  I  On May 18, 2023, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss MEPA   \n21  Claims based on the enactment ofHB 971. (Doc. 376). On June 1, 2023, \n22  Plaintiffs filed a response brief opposing Defendant's motion to dismiss the \n23  claims. (Doc. 382). Defendants filed a reply and request for oral argument on \n24  June 9, 2023. (Doc. 385). \nI \n25  Ill// \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 7 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  On May 19, 2023, Governor Gianforte signed into law Senate Bill \n2  557, amending several provisions ofMEPA, Mont. Code Ann.§ 75-1-201. \n3  On May 23, 2023, the Court issued an Order on Defendants' \n4  Motions to Partially Dismiss for Mootness and For Summary Judgment. (Doc. \n5  379). As to Defendants' Motion to Partially Dismiss for Mootness (Doc. 343), \n6  the Court granted Defendants' motion and dismissed without prejudice Plaintiffs' \n7  claims involving the State Energy Policy and Defendants' aggregate acts taken \n8  pursuant to and in furtherance of the State Energy Policy on redressability and \n9  prudential standing grounds. (Doc. 379 at 3-4). The Court denied Defendants' \n10  motion for summary judgment and allowed Plaintiffs' MEP A claims to proceed \n11  to trial. (Doc. 379 at 20-26). \n12  On June 1, 2023, the Court issued an order on the remaining \n13  rpotions in limine. (Doc. 381).  The Court granted Plaintiffs' motion# 2; granted \n14  ih part and denied in part Plaintiffs' motions# 3 and 5; and denied Plaintiffs' \n15  motions# 4, 6, and 7.

Dr. Steven Running is a University Regents Professor \n21  Emeritus of Global Ecology in the College of Forestry and Conservation at the \n22  University of Montana. [SR-2]. Dr. Running currently co-chairs the standing \n23  Committee for Earth Science and Application from Space of the National \n24  ~cademy of Science. In 2007, Dr. Running shared the honor of the Nobel Peace \n25  Ptze as a chapter Lead Author for the 4th Assessment Report of the \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 17 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). [Pl93]. Dr. Running \n2  provided expert testimony in the general areas of the climate system, including \n3  the energy balance and imbalance, the physics of GHG emissions that are driving \n4  climate change, the global carbon cycle, the global hydrologic cycle, how they \n5  control this energy imbalance, and then how human caused fossil fuel \n6  development is harming Montana's ecosystems and hydrology. Dr. Running is a \n7  well-qualified expert, and the Court found his testimony informative and \n8  credible. \n9  66.  Dr. Cathy Whitlock is Regents Professor Emerita of Earth \n10  Sciences and a Fellow of the Montana Institute on Ecosystems at Montana State \n11  University (MSU). Dr. Whitlock was lead author of the 2017 Montana Climate \n12  Assessment, and in 2020 co-authored a state-level Montana Climate Solutions \n13  Plan and a 2021 special report of the Montana Climate Assessment entitled \n14  Climate Change and Human Health in Montana. Dr. Whitlock was also co-lead \n15  author of the 2021 Greater Yellowstone Climate Assessment. Dr. Whitlock \n16  provided expert testimony explaining how human-caused fossil fuel development \n17  ahd the resulting release of CO into the atmosphere are harming Montana's \n2 \nI \n18  e'cosystems, water supplies, communities, and the Plaintiffs themselves. Dr. \nI \n19  Whitlock also discussed recent trends and future projections in temperature, \n20  Jrecipitation, snow accumulation and snowmelt, and stream runoff in Montana \n21  ~nd explained how they affect terrestrial ecosystems, communities, and the \n22  livelihoods of people that depend on these ecosystem services. Dr. Whitlock's \nI \n23  testimony included projections for Montana's future based on continuing or \n24  ihcreasing the present rate ofGHG emissions. Dr. Whitlock's testimony \nI \n25  I! ,I II  \nI \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 18 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  primarily focused on the effect GHG emissions in Montana. Dr. Whitlock is a \n2  well-qualified expert, and the Court found her testimony informative and \n3  credible. \n4  67.  There is overwhelming scientific consensus that Earth is \n5  wanning as a direct result of human GHG emissions, primarily from the burning \n6  of fossil fuels. [SR 102:10-103:9, 125:11-22, 141:18-20; CW 257:14-25; P6, P13, \n7  P23, P34, P223, Pl43; SR-22]. \n8  68.  Fossil fuels include coal, crude oil or its derivatives (such as \n9  gasoline or jet fuel), and natural gas. [PE 901 :24-902:8]. \n10  69.  While several GHGs are emitted from the burning of fossil \n11  fuels, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the GHG most responsible for trapping excess heat \n12  within Earth's atmosphere. [SR 114:20-116:10]. \n13 \n70.  Science is unequivocal that dangerous impacts to the climate \n14 \ni:ire occurring due to human activities, primarily from the extraction and burning \n15 \ndffossil fuels. [SR 103:5-9; P6, P23, P34, P223, Pl43; SR-46, SR-47]. \n' \n16  71.  A substantial portion of every ton of CO2 emitted by human \nI \n17 \nactivities persists in the atmosphere for as long as hundreds of years or millennia. \n18 \nAs a result, CO2 steadily accumulates in the atmosphere. [SR 166:2-10, 168:2-10; \n19  cw 279:14-20, 314:20-315:8, 318:2-5]. \n20 \n72.  The cumulative effect of GHG emissions causes the impacts \n21  fo the climate being experienced today. [SR 168:2-16]. Human activity and the \n22 \niurning of fossil fuels have accelerated the accumulation of CO2 to the point that \n23  I \n42% of the total accumulation of CO2 emissions has happened in the last thirty \nI \n24  years. [SR 141:16-142:2; SR-42]. \n25  /1111 \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 19 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  73.  It has long been understood that certain GHGs, including \n2  CO2 and methane (CH4), trap heat in the atmosphere, causing the Earth to warm. \ni \n3  [SR 107: 16-25]. An American, Eunice Newton Foote, was one of the first \nI \n4  ~cientists to research and write about the ability of atmospheric carbon dioxide to \n5  1ffect solar heating in the 1850s. [SR 108:22-109:3; SR-14]. \n' \n6  74.  In 1896, Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish chemist, wrote that \n7  the practice of burning fossil fuels emitting CO2 could one day warm the planet. \n8  [SR 108:1-8]. Arrhenius, and other early climate scientists, understood that the \n9  more CO2 that was added to the atmosphere, the more the surface of the Earth \n10  would warm. [SR 108:8-13]. At the time of Arrhenius's work, atmospheric CO2 \n11  levels were approximately 295 parts per million (ppm).  Pre-industrial levels \n12  were approximately 280 ppm. [SR 109:22-25; SR-14]. \n13  75.  In 1958, Dr. David Keeling began the modern monitoring of \n14  atmospheric CO2 at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, a remote location not near any local \nI \n15  CO2 sources. [SR 111: 12-21]. Keeling's data, now replicated at dozens of \n! \n16  stations worldwide, proved that CO2 has continued to rise every year from 1958 \n17  to the present from an initial concentration of 315-316 ppm in 195 8, to an annual \n18  mean level of around 424 ppm today. [SR 112:22-113:4, 113:16-114:8]. The \n19  lurve showing a long-term increase in CO2 concentrations has become known as \n20  ~he \"Keeling Curve.\" [SR 110 :22-111 : 11, 113 :20]. \n21  76.  Between 1960 and 2000, CO2 levels rose at about \n22  2 ppm per year, but since approximately 2000, CO2 levels are rising at about \nI \n23  3 ppm per year, primarily from fossil fuel emissions.

[SR 119:20-121: 11; SR-19]. \n17  78.  The continuous rise in atmospheric CO2 has caused global, \n18  national, and Montana air temperatures to rise, as measured by meteorological \n19  Jtations. Total global temperature rise over the last 120 years is on average 2.2°F, \nI \n20  9r about l.2°C. [SR 132:19-22; SR-38; CW 262:4-21; CW-18, CW-19, CW-20]. \nI \n21  79.  Montana is heating faster than the global average because \nI \n22  higher latitudes are heating more quickly. [CW 263 :20-264:7]. \n23  80.

The Earth has warmed by 1.3 to 2.2°F in only the last thirty \n2  five years, as atmospheric CO concentrations have risen from 350 ppm to over \n2 \nI \n3  420 ppm today. [SR 130:14-18; SR-35, SR-64]. It previously took 140 years for \nI \n4  the Earth to warm by 0.9°F. [SR-35]. The Earth is heating more quickly now. \nI \n5  2020 was the second warmest year on record, and land areas were record warm. \nI \n6  The ten warmest years on record have occurred since 2005, and since 1981, a \n7  dew global temperature record has been set every three years. Since 1980, the \nI \n8  ~arth has not experienced a single year with below long-term average \nI \n9  teI mperatures. [SE 131:20-132:10; SR-37]. \ni \n10  I  82.  The Earth's energy imbalance (the difference in energy from \n11  sun arriving at the Earth and the amount radiated back to space) is what climate \nI  • \n12  sbientists describe as the most critical metric for determining the amount of \n13  diobal heating and climate change we have already experienced and \nI \n14  will experience as long as the Earth's energy imbalance exists. [SR 122:1-15, \n15  f29: 17-20; SR-34].  Scientists measure and calculate how much extra energy, or \nI \n16  heat, is being retained in Earth's systems, like oceans, ice, air, and land surface, \n17  sompared to what Earth's natural balance would be if more heat escaped our \n18  atmosphere. [SR 122:1-15, 129:21-130:4]. \n19  83.  The Earth's energy imbalance is currently significant and is \nI \n20  due to accumulation of energy within Earth's oceans, ice, land, and air, with the \n21  ~nergy measured in joules and the rate of additional energy measured in watts per \n22  s~uare meter. [SR 124:14-125: 18]. A watt is the addition of one joule of energy \n23  ih one second, which is then averaged by the area of the Earth to yield watts per \n24  s~uare meter. From 1971 to 2018, the Earth gained about 360 zeta joules of heat \n(h \n25  zeta is a unit with 21 zeros; a trillion has 12 zeros). [SR-29]. Adding this much \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 22 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  energy over forty-eight years yields an energy imbalance of about 0.5 W m-2• \n2  However, the rate of energy addition has continued to increase due to increasing \n3  GHG emissions and the Earth's energy imbalance for 2010 to 2018 is about 0.9 \nI \n4  W m-2 [SR 122:14-24; SR-29; P79]. \n• \n5  84.  358 zeta joules are enough energy to bring Flathead Lake to \n6  ~oil 40,000 times over. [SR 125:3-6; SR-30]. \n7  !  85.  As long as there is an energy imbalance, the Earth will \n8  continue to heat, ice will continue to melt, and weather patterns will become \n9  1111ore extreme. [SR 127:7-22, 131:9-15, 137:6-9, 149:2-14]. If more GHGs are \n10  · idded to the atmosphere and more incoming energy received from the sun is \n' \n11  trapped as thermal energy, the Earth's climate system will continue to heat up. \nI \n12  [SR 125:7-22]. \n13  I  86.  The scientific consensus is that CO from fossil fuel \n2 \n14  11ollution is the primary driver of Earth's energy imbalance. [SR 117:21-118: 12; \nI \n15  1?5: 11-22]. Due to the buildup of CO from about 280 ppm to 419 ppm in the \n2 \n16  !~st 140 years (and to a lesser extent other GHGs), more solar energy is now \nI \n17  retained on Earth and less energy is released back to space. [SR 130:8-14; P20, \n18  P22, P79; SR-14]. \n19  :  87.  The buildup of CO2 and the current Earth energy imbalance \n20  ii due to anthropogenic changes in the environment, not natural variability. [SR \nI \n21  1\\03:5-9, 121:7-11]. \nI \n22  I  88.  Approximately 89% of annual anthropogenic CO2 \nI \n23  emissions, or 35 gigatons of CO is attributable to burning fossil fuels. [SR \n2, \n24  115 :9-1 7; SR-20]. Approximately 11 % of annual anthropogenic CO is from land \n2 \n25  use change, which includes wildfires, agricultural burning, and deforestation. \n1\nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 23 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  [SR 115: 18-22, 116:7-15; SR-20]. This means that fossil fuel use is around 10 \n2  times as large as other sources of emissions due to human management. [SR \n3  115: 15-21). In terms of the CO humans emit each year, approximately 48% of \n2 \n4  these emissions end up in the atmosphere, 29% are absorbed in back up in the \n5  biosphere, and 26% are absorbed by the oceans. [SR 115:7-117:10; SR-20]. \n6  89.  Until atmospheric GHG concentrations are reduced, extreme \n7  weather events and other climactic events such as droughts and heatwaves will \n8  occur more frequently and in greater magnitude, and Plaintiffs will be unable to \n9  live clean and healthy lives in Montana.

The yearly days in Montana with extreme heat, meaning \n9  temperatures over 90 degrees, is expected to increase by 11 - 30 days by \n10  midcentury, and by as much as two months by the end of the century. \n11  [CW 273:6-20; CW-24, CW-28]. At the same time, the number of days above \n12  freezing will increase by weeks to months in the future. [CW 273:6-20, \n13  275:21-276:7; CW-27; P222]. \nI \n14  97.

Six million children in the U.S. ages 0-17 \n23  have asthma, which translates to approximately one in every twelve children. \n! \n24  [LB 485:7-8, 503:1-14, 505:4-25; LB-26, LB-30]. \n25  /Ill/ \nI \ni \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 32 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  128.  Children who have pre-existing respiratory conditions, \n2  including asthma, are especially vulnerable to climate impacts, including \n3  increasing air pollution and rising temperatures. Wildfire smoke has harmed the \n4  health of Plaintiffs Olivia, Jeffrey, and Nate, all who have pre-existing health \n5  conditions, and other Plaintiffs, including Badge and Eva. [LB 505: 12-506:20, \n6  508:23-509:1; LB-28]. \n7  129.  Plaintiffs Olivia and Grace are distressed by feeling forced \n8  to consider foregoing a family because they fear the world that their children \n9  would grow up in. [LB 497:4-21; LVS 1214:21-1215:1, 1221:19-1222:5; GGS \n10  208:3-22]. \n11  130.

Extreme heat threatens the health of competitive athletes, \n15  including Kian, Georgi, Claire, and Grace. [LB 490:6-491 :15; LB-18]. \n16  132.  For indigenous youth, like Ruby, Lilian, and Sariel, extreme \n17  weather harms their ability to participate in cultural practices and access \n18  traditional food sources, which is particularly harmful to indigenous youth with \n\\ \n19  their place-based cultures and traditions. [LB 491:23-493:9; MDJ 579:19-580:9]. \n20  133.  Because of their unique vulnerabilities, their stages of \n21  development as youth, and their average longevity on the planet in the future, \n22 \nJ;>laintiffs face lifelong hardships resulting from climate change.

Youth are more vulnerable to the mental health impacts of \n2  climate change because younger people are more likely to be affected by the \n3  cumulative toll of stress and have more adverse childhood experiences (ACEs ). \n4  ACEs increase the likelihood of cumulative trauma that leads to mental and \n5  physical illness, as well as an increased risk of early death. [LB 521: 14-16, \n6  5236-15; LVS 1210:2-1211:2; LB-33; LVS-31]. \n7  135.  ACEs can cause prolonged fear, anxiety, and stress, \n8  cognitive impairments, and unhealthy risk behaviors. ACEs can also cause long \n9  term health impacts including increased risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, \n10  depression, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and broken bones. \n11  [LB 516:3-20, 519:16-520:4, 522:17-523:2; LB-34]. \n12  136.

CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALREADY ADVERSELY AFFECTING \n2  MONTANA'S NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. \n3  140.  Anthropogenic climate change is impacting, degrading, and \n4  depleting Montana's environment and natural resources, including through \n5  increasing temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, increasing droughts and \n6  aridification, increasing extreme weather events, increasing severity and intensity \n7  of wildfires, and increasing glacial melt and loss. [JS 655:2-658:10, 659:6-\n8  660:11; see generally SR, CW, DF; CW-56; DF-20]. \n9  141.  Climate change impacts result in hardship to every sector of \n10  Montana's economy, including recreation, agriculture, and tourism. For example, \n11  private water supplies will be harmed. [SR 144:13-145: 17; CW-52]. \n12  142.  Montana has already warmed significantly more than the \n13  global average. [CW 263:12-17, 263:20-264:7; CW-18, CW-19]. \n14  143.  All parts of Montana have seen a long-term trend of \n15  increasing mean annual temperatures since 1950. Winter and spring have warmed \n16  the most [CW 267:18-268:20; CW-21; P6]. \n17  144.  There is a scientific consensus that rising temperatures in \n18  Montana are due to rising GHG concentrations, primarily CO [SR 103:5-9, \n2• \ncw \n19  117:25-118: 12;  269:18-25]. \n20  145.  Montana's snowpack has been decreasing and is likely to \n21  continue decreasing with warmer temperatures, as a long-term trend caused by \n22  i_mpacts to the climate. [CW 283:11-19; CW-33, CW-35, CW-55; DF 421 :12-23]. \n23  fill \n24  Ill// \n! \n25  Ill// \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 35 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  146.  Montana's April 1, Snow Water Equivalent, which is an \n2  important metric for how much water will be available during the dry summer \n3  months in Montana, has been declining since the 1930s. [CW 284:23-286:15; \n4  CW-34]. \n5  147.  The decline in snowpack is directly attributed to elevated \n6  temperatures due to high levels of GHG emissions. [CW 283: 11-19, 288:3-1 0]. \n7  148.  Warming temperatures in Montana are resulting in more \n8  precipitation falling as rain instead of snow, particularly in western Montana. \n9  This results in reduced snowpack and shorter snowpack runoff duration in the \n10  spring and summer. Warming temperatures and rapid snowmelt and rain-on \n11  snow events have been a major cause of spring flooding in Montana. [CW \n12  291:17-292:20]. \n13  149.  Extreme spring flooding events are consistent with climate \n14  change, including more spring precipitation, which can cause flash flooding \n15  when rain falls on snow. [SR 144:24-145:8; SR-44]. Spring flooding is expected \n16  to increase in frequency with increased climate change. [CW 291:15-292:20]. \n17  150.  The 2018 Shields River flooding and the 2022 Yellowstone \n18  River flooding event are examples of rain on snow and heavy precipitation events \n19  that will be more frequent with climate change. [CW 291: 15-292:20]. \n20  151.  Dr. Dan Fagre holds a Ph.D. from the University of \n21  California, Davis. He joined the National Park Service as a research scientist in \n22  1989 and, in 1991, he became the Climate Change Research Coordinator at \n23  Glacier National Park as part of the nationwide United States Global Change \nI \n24  Research Program. His position was transferred to the United States Geological \nI \n25  Survey (USGS), where he served until his retirement in 2020, after which he has \nI \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 36 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  continued as Scientist Emeritus. At Glacier National Park, Dr. Fagre helped \n2  develop a national climate change research program within the National Park \n3  Service, coordinating with other scientists at national parks from Florida to \n4  Alaska. He built a research program centered on Glacier Park as a representative \n5  mountain ecosystem, engaging faculty and scientists from Montana universities \n6  and across the U.S. [Pl90]. Dr. Fagre is a well-qualified expert, and his \n7  testimony was informative and credible. \n8  152.  Glacier National Park is a major driver of the regional \n9  economy and a source of fresh water for countless communities. [Def. Answer, \n10  Doc. 54, 159; DF 404:10-406:10, 407:1-3, 408:11-25, 426:2-17; DF-13]. \n11  153.  The glaciers in Glacier National Park were an early focus of \n12  the U.S. Geological Survey climate change research because they are excellent \n13  indicators of impacts to the climate. Located above the rest of the mountain \n14  ecosystem, glaciers respond only to climatic forces that affect summer \n15  temperatures that melt ice and snow and winter snow accumulation (i.e., \n16  snowpack). [DF 394:15-396:1, 396:25-397:17]. \n17  154.  Of the approximately 146 glaciers present in Glacier \n18  National Park in 1850, only twenty-six glaciers larger than twenty-five acres \n19  remained in 2015. 82% of Glacier Park's glaciers are gone and there has been a \n20  70% loss of area of all glaciers. [DF 418: 1-8, 422:25-424:4; DF-17, DF-20]. \n21  155.  Since 1900, glaciers in Glacier Park lost 66% of their area, \n22  making Montana the largest region for glacier loss in the U.S. lower forty-eight. \ni \n23  tgassiz Glacier, Grinnell Glacier, Jackson Glacier, Sperry Glacier, and \n24  /!Ill \n25  Ill// \nI \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 37 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  Thunderbird Glacier have all experienced significant retreat.

The scientific consensus is that the retreat of Glacier Park's \n5  glaciers over the past century is due to human GHG emissions (mainly CO from \n2 \n6  fossil fuel burning). [DF 409:24-410:1,9, 416:21-417:15, 422:8-19, 424:5-11, \n7  428: 13-24]. \n8  157.  The cmTent ice retreat of Glacier Park's glaciers is in \n9  response to modem, human-caused warming of the region, [DF 428:13-24]. \n10  158.  Computer models project the loss of Glacier Park's glaciers \n11  if fossil fuel emissions continue to rise, [DF 425:9-23]. \n12  159.  The loss of Glacier National Park's glaciers will affect the \n13  rater sources of many communities, stream and river hydrology, local \n14  economies, and the recreational opportunities of several Plaintiffs because they \n+ill \n15  be denied access to natural resources enjoyed by previous generations of \n16  fontanans. [DF 404:10-406: 10, 407:1-3, 408:11-25, 426:2-17; DF-13]. \n17  160.  IfGHG emissions are reduced glaciers would slow their \n18  iµelting, eventually stabilize, and then begin to grow again. [DF 428: 1-12]. \n19  161.  Climate change results in water levels in Montana's rivers \n20  and lakes that are routinely well below normal levels in summer and fall months \n21  ~nd water temperatures that are well above historical levels. [JS 686: 18-687:4, \n22  690:7-17, 692:22-25, 693:2-7; JS-25]. \n23  /  162.  Dr. Jack Stanford received his Ph.D. in Freshwater Ecology \n24  at the University of Utah. [JS-2]. He is Professor Emeritus at the Flathead Lake \ni \n25  ];3iologica! Station (FLBS) of the University of Montana. He was the Director and \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 38 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  Bierman Professor of Ecology at the University of Montana (1980-2016). His \n2  primary area of research is aquatic ecosystem processes, including influences of \n3  human activities. He has published over 220 scientific papers and books on \n4  aquatic ecosystem processes, including influences of human activities. [P194]. \n5  Dr. Stanford is a well-qualified expert, and his testimony was informative and \n6  credible. \n7  163.  Montana is part of the northern Rocky Mountain region. The \n8  northern Rocky Mountains are a headwaters region, including for the Missouri \nI \n9  River system to the East and the Columbia River System to the West, where most \n,r \n10  of the water originates as snow. [Def. Answer, Doc. 54  157]. \n11  164.  Montana is a key \"water tower\" of the Continent. Water that \n12  drains from the Rocky Mountains feeds three of the great rivers of North \n' \n13  ,i\\merica: the Columbia, the Saskatchewan, and the Missouri-Mississippi. Snow \n14  at high elevations provides eighty-five percent of the fresh water that people use \n15  in Montana. [DF 405:22-406:10, 407:16-409:1; DF-13; JS 656:21-657:7]. \n! \n16  165.  The accumulation of winter snowpack in the mountains \n17  naturally acts as a reservoir for the hotter, drier months, gradually melting with \n18  hnset of spring, and in summer providing continuous flow downstream, which is \nI \n19  critical in the period of less precipitation and warmer temperatures. [SR \n20  152:2-18]. Some accumulations are held in mountain glaciers which add \n21  meltwaters to the flow paths. [DF 407:16-409:1; DF-13]. \ni \n22  I  166.  Precipitation also is retained in lakes and wetlands where a \n23  large share of runoff penetrates into the ground, feeding aquifers that store water \nbr \n24  augment river and stream flows. [JS 655:20-24, 657: 13-17, \nI \n25  660: 12-661 :7; JS-4]. \n! \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 39 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  167.  Montana's river and lake ecosystems are interconnected \n2  with each other and with aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems beyond Montana's \n3  borders. [JS 646:2-647:2]. The interconnectivity of Montana's river and lake \n4  ecosystems includes being connected with groundwater and atmospheric waters. \n5  [JS 661:8-12; JS-4, JS-8, JS-9; P82]. \n6  168.  The rivers of Montana are interlinked and their flows and \n7  the quantity of materials (e.g., sediments) that they naturally transport are now, \n8  without functioning glaciers, increasingly dependent on seasonal rain and \n9  Snow. These river networks transport and deliver the water and materials that \n10  ~ustain the natural and cultural (human) elements of Montana's ecosystems. \n11  [JS 661:8-664:18, 646:2-647:2; JS-4; DF-19]. \n' \n12  169.  Montana's water resources are critically important to Youth \n' \n13  Plaintiffs and all Montana citizens and to many people beyond the State's \n14  bI orders. Montanans must have a dependable supply of clean freshwater. [JS \n15  659:6-19; JS-25]. \n16  I  170.  Anthropogenic climate change is disrupting the natural \n17  range of variation in the flow paths of Montana's river systems. Compared to the \nI \n18  1960s, the summer streamflow in Montana's rivers has decreased by \nI \nI \n19  ~pproximately 20% and stream temperatures have increased between 1-2°C. \n20  [JS 666:15-667:20; JS-10, JS-25]. \n21  171.  As a result of anthropogenic climate change: \n22  a.  Surface temperatures in Flathead Lake are too warm \n' \n' \nI \n23  for bull and cutthroat trout to sustain their historic populations.

One impact of anthropogenic climate change to Montana's \n5  aquatic ecosystems is that runoff (spring spate) from snowmelt is days to weeks \n6  earlier. Loss of snowpack also accelerates warming and water loss owing to \n7  reduced reflection than would occur if the snowpack was sustained. [JS 670:20-\n8  671 :2]. \n9  173.  Low water levels and abn01mally warm water temperatures \n10  create harmful conditions for fish and other aquatic organisms. [JS 671 :3-17]. \n11  174.  Access to boating and fishing on certain rivers and lakes in \n12  Montana has been limited, and in some instance completely foreclosed, because \n13  oflow river flows or high-water temperatures. These changes limit the ability of \n14  some Plaintiffs to fish and access the State's rivers and lakes for sport or \n15  recreation. [SR 152:25-153:9, 153:10-13; JS 679:7-15]. \n16  175.  Wildfires resulting from climate change have caused \n17  nitrogen levels in Montana's lakes to increase. This has caused nutrient \n18  i~balances that threaten the plant and animal life in the lakes. [JS 683:1-684:4]. \n19  I  176.  If GHG emissions continue to rise, impacts to the climate \n20  will further harm Montana's wildlife and fisheries, and the ability of Plaintiffs to \n21  hunt and fish. [JS 679:7-15; 687:8-14]. \n22  177.  The western United States, including Montana, has \n23  eJperienced a trend of increased drought and heat stress from climate change, \nI \n24  II/// \nI \n25  11/11 \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 42 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  which has killed trees and altered ecosystem dynamics, and this trend toward \n2  hotter and drier summers will continue in the future. [SR 106:1-18, 146:18-21, \n3  156:2-17; CW 258:24-259:8, 283:3-10; CW-44]. \n4  178.  Droughts in Montana are more expansive and longer term \n5  which negatively affects stream systems: aquifer systems become depleted due to \n6  reduced infiltration of streamflow and rainfall.  Where aquifers contribute \n7  significantly to base flow maintenance in Montana streams, the outcome is even \n8  more extreme and with sustained drying. [JS 677:7-678:1]. \n9  179.  Anthropogenic climate change is producing a shift from \n10  snow to rain earlier in the year, and flooding from intense but extreme, short \n11  duration flooding is more commonly occurring today than in the past ( especially \n12  in the spring).  That ultimately means less water is retained in the drainage \n13  network. [JS 676: 12-25]. \n14  180.  Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of \n15  d1'ought and heat stress associated with climate change are fundamentally altering \nI \n16  tKe composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in Montana. [SR 106: \n17  1-14]. There is already evidence of accelerating forest mortality in western \n18  forests, and this acceleration is clearly tied to increasing temperatures and plant \n19  water stress. [SR 156:2-17, 163:9-164:2]. \n20  181.  Montana's forests are being drastically altered due to the \n21  c~mbination of drought, pest infestations, and wildfires. [SR 156: 12-157: 15]. \n22  182.  Climate scientists have long known that increasing \ni \n23  temperatures intensify drought conditions, and the combination of drier and \n24  hJtter weather leads to larger, more frequent, and severe wildfires.

The wildfire season in Montana is two months longer than it \n2  was in 1980s. (SR 159:7-13]. The lengthening of the fire season is largely due to \nI \n3  declining mountain snowpack, earlier spring snowmelt, decreased summer \n4  precipitation, and warmer summer temperatures leading to deficits in soil and \nI \n5  fµel moisture-which are all due to increasing GHG emissions. [SR 106: 1-14, \n6  156:24-157:13, 159:18-160:6, 160:22-24; SR-54; CW 305:3-24; CW-47]. \n7  184.  The extent of area burned in the U.S. each year has \n8  increased since the 1980s. According to National Interagency Fire Center data, of \n' \n9  the ten years with the largest acreage burned, all have occurred since 2004, \n10  including the peak year of 2021. This period coincides with many of the warmest \n11  y~ars on record nationwide. (SR 158:4-11; SR-52]. \n12  185.

For example, the American pika and Snowshoe hares are considered \n: \n21  highly sensitive to climate change due in large part to their dependence on \nI \n22  s4balpine habitat and snow cover, which is also projected to decline.

[CW 273:6-20, \n6  275:18-276:7; P6; CW-24, CW-27]. \n7  189.  There will be increasing seasonal variation in Montana's \n8  precipitation, with more precipitation falling in the spring and fall and less in the \n' \n9  winter and summer. The change in precipitation timing and a decrease in \n10  p~ecipitation during the summer months, combined with increasing summer \n11  tJmperatures, will contribute to increasing risk of summer drought conditions in \n12  parts of Montana and more precipitation falling as rain as opposed to snow. [CW \n13  281:4-21; CW-30, CW-35; P6, P34]. \n' \n14  190.  Increasing temperature will offset small increases in \n15  ptecipitation by increasing rates of evaporation and transpiration and will make \n16  l~te-summer and fall droughts highly likely and increasingly severe. [CW 283: \n17  3-1 OJ. \n18  191.  The current decline in Montana snowpack and snow \n19  accumulation is projected to continue. The loss of snowpack and snow \n20  accumulation is primarily driven by increasing temperatures, which are caused by \n21  adthropogenic GHG emissions.

Plaintiff Rikki Held lives on her family's ranch twenty miles \ni \n17  01,1tside of Broadus, Montana. Broadus is a ranching community in Southeastern \nI \n18  l\\iontana, with a population of approximately 450 people in the town and \n19  aJproximately 2000 in Powder River County. \n20  a.  Rikki has experienced climate change-related harms \n21  to herself and her family ranch, including harms from flooding, severe storms, \n22  wildfires, and drought. \n23  b.  The Powder River runs through Rikki's ranch. The \n24  ranch includes five pivot fields and pine-covered hills. Rikki and her family have \n! \n25  raised cattle on the ranch, grew crops to feed cattle, and owned horses. \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 46 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  C.  Rikki started riding horses and herding livestock when \n2  sjle was four. Rikki grew up involved in ranching activities, working with \nI \n3  livestock, haying, and fixing fences. \n4  d.  Rikki's grandparents are from Broadus and her dad \n5  g~ew up in Broadus. \nI \n6  I  e.  Rikki and her family run a motel that rents rooms to \n' \n7  t\\avelers. Rikki often works for the family motel business. The primary source of \n8  Rlikki's family's income is the ranch (currently leased) and motel business. Loss \n! \n9  of this income affects Rikki personally. \n10  f.  Impacts to the climate are already harming Rikki's \nI \n11  hbme, family, community, income, and way of life. \n12  g.  Rikki was often required to work outside on the ranch \nj \n13  rJgardless of the temperatures or air quality. Rikki's physical well-being has been \nI \n14  h~rmed by wildfires and wildfire smoke, as well as extreme heat. \n15  h.  In 2012, the Ash Creek fire burned seventy miles of \n16  power poles, causing the loss of electricity on Rikki's ranch for a month. \nI \n17  Electricity is required to access water for both cattle and Rikki's house on the \n! \n18  dnch, so the loss of electricity harmed both cattle and Rikki. \nI \n19  Climate change has impacted the snowpack on the \n20  ranch in recent years, with snow typically not lasting through the winter. \n21  R~duced winter snowpack means less natural water available for cattle. As a \nI \nI \n22  result, the cattle must rely on water tanks, which are far apart and expensive to \n! \n23  install. With less water, there is also less grass available for the cattle to eat. \nI \n24  !IHI \nI \n25  I/Ill \nI \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 47 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  J- With less water and grasses, cattle travel further for \n2  water and food, and lose weight. This means the cattle are not as valuable and the \n3  r1nch profits and income declined. \n4  k.  Wildfires have closed roads around Broadus limiting \n5  the number of people that can reach Rikki's family motel business, causing lost \n6  income for Rikki and her family. \n7  I.  Climate change has caused increased variability in \n8  water levels in the Powder River. Rikki's family relies on the river to water their \n9  livestock. Increasingly, the river levels are extremely low while at other times the \n10  river floods. \n11  m.  In 2017, the Powder River flooded and eroded the \n12  riverbank on Rikki's ranch, undercutting a fifty-year-old fence. Since then, \n13  continued flooding has eroded about fifty feet of riverbank, with floodwaters that \n14  nearly reach Rikki's home. \n15  I  n.  Rikki experiences stress and despair from how climate \n16  change impacts her well-being, the well-being of her family, and the well-being \n17  of other Montanans. Montana is Rikki's home and seeing how climate change is \n18  impacting Montana and her family ranch is a heavy emotional burden for Rikki. \n19  0.  Rikki faces economic harm, including barriers to \n20  keeping family wealth and property intact and decreased future economic \n21  opportunities. \n22  196.  Plaintiffs Lander Busse and Badge B. are brothers, living in \n23  Kalispell, Montana. \nI \n24  a.  Lander and Badge enjoy hunting and fishing. \nI \n' \n' \n25  Ill// \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 48 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  b.  Lander and Badge hunt with their parents and \n2  grandparents. Hunting is an important family activity. \n3  C.  Lander and Badge's ability to hunt and fish is \n4  inhibited due to climate change consequences, including extreme heat and \n5  wildfires. \n6  d.  Climate change has adversely impacted Lander and \n7  Badge's ability to fish by rendering certain waterways impassible by raft due to \n8  low instream levels or too-warm water temperatures, which harm fish and \n9  decrease their populations. \n10  e.  Lander and Badge have had their ability to fish \nI \n11  liinited or foreclosed due to fishery closures as a result of climate change-induced \n12  conditions in Montana's rivers. Lander and Badge have also had their access to \n13  rivers limited for other recreational activities. \n14  f.  The extreme temperatures and smoke have at times \n15  made hunting unbearable and impossible for Lander and Badge. Smoky \nI \n16  conditions have also impacted their fishing activities. \n17  g.  Due to climate change, the wildfire smoke in \n18  Kalispell, and in other parts of Montana where Badge recreates, makes it difficult \n19  for Badge to breathe and triggers a cough, which negatively impacts his health \n20  and well-being. \n21  h.  In 2018, a wildfire near the Busse' s home forced their \n22  family to prepare to evacuate. Preparing to evacuate was a traumatic experience \n23  fo,r Lander and Badge. Badge is worried that wildfires will continue to threaten \nI \n24  his home. \n25  Ill// \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 49 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  I.  Lander has seasonal pollen allergies, which are \n2  worsening due to the increased pollen count and a changing climate. \n3  J.  Lander is an accomplished musician and theater \n4  performer and often performs outdoors. Climate change and wildfires have \n5  hampered his ability to perform music and theater at a high level and have \n6  negatively impacted his physical well-being. \n' \n7  k.  Badge is named after the Badger-Two Medicine, an \n8  Jea where he frequently recreates and fishes. Wildfires in the Badger-Two \n9  ~edicine have destroyed trees and have degraded areas important to Badge and \n10  Jhere he enjoys visiting and recreating, which has had a powerful emotional \n11  ihipact on Badge. Badge experiences a sense of loss and distress knowing that the \n12  area is being damaged and degraded due to climate change. Badge feels as if a \n13  part of him were lost in the Badger Two-Medicine fire. \nI \n14  I.  Badge is passionate about skiing and has skied for as \n15  lbng as he can remember. Climate change is reducing Badge's ability to \n16  rlarticipate in this important recreational activity. \nI \n' \n17  m.  Badge is anxious when he thinks about the future that \n18  he, and his potential children, will inherit. \n19  n.  Lander and Badge care deeply about protecting \n20  Montana's environment, which is an integral part of their family traditions, \n21  culture, and identity. Witnessing the current impacts of climate change in \n22  Montana is traumatic for both Lander and Badge. \n23  0.  Lander and Badge are experiencing the loss of ties to \nI \n24  the land in Montana. \n25  I/Ill \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 50 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  197.  Plaintiff Sariel Sandoval is a member of the Confederated \n2  Salish and Kootenai Tribes and is from Ronan, Montana. \n3  a.  Sariel and her family have a deep connection to the \n4  natural world, and have a unique connection to the land, the natural environment, \n5  and the seasons. Climate change is harming Sariel's culture and tribal practices. \n6  Sariel went to a Salish language immersion school called Nkwusm in Arlee. At \n7  school, Sariel was taught her native language and learned about the Salish \n8  culture. \n9  b.  Sariel was excited to receive her Salish name, which \n10  means \"Person Who Brings the Cedar.\" Cedar has important cultural significance \nI \n11  because it provides a connection through the land to the Creator. \n12  C.  Sariel feels a strong sense of connection to her \n13  community. She believes that carrying on her community's traditions is \n14  important because it is their way of life and reflects their connection to the land. \n15  d.  Gathering and using sweet grass and bear root is \n16  important to Sariel culturally and spiritually. \n17  e.  Sariel is concerned about how climate change affects \n18  the seasons because her culture is very ingrained with the land and the seasons. It \n19  also affects plants and foods her tribe needs to survive, and she is concerned that \n20 \nthese changes will change the community itself. Because of earlier-than-normal \n21  snowmelt and the consequent drying of mountain streams as a result of climate \n22 \nchange, plants used in Salish and Kootenai medicines are becoming scarcer and \n23  more difficult for tribe members to gather. \nI \n24 \nf.  Coyote Stories are a culturally important type of \n25 \nCreation Story that can only be told when there is snow on the ground. Sariel is \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 51 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  concerned because the snow is not staying on the ground as long, and she does \n2  not know what will happen to the stories when there is no more snow. \n3  g.  Climate change impacts Sariel's ability to partake in \n4  cultural and spiritual activities and traditions, which are central to her individual \n5  dignity. Climate change has disrupted tribal spiritual practices and longstanding \n6  rhythms of tribal life by changing the timing of natural events like bird \n7  migrations. \n8  h.  Sariel worked at Blue Bay Campground the summer \n9  after she graduated high school. Sariel lost a few weeks of work and income due \n10  to the nearby Finley Point fire (also known as the Boulder 2700 Fire) in 2021. \n11  The fire also led to the road being shut down, homes being lost, and people being \n12  evacuated. \n13  1.  Sariel is often unable to see the mountains near her \n14  home due to wildfire smoke. \n15  J.  Berry picking is a staple cultural activity for Sariel \n16  and her family. Some huckleberry bushes are not producing fruit because of \n17  drought and Sariel must travel higher up into the mountains to find healthy \n18  huckleberries. \n19  k.  Climate change has a profound emotional impact on \n20  Sariel, who experiences stress and despair about the impacts her community is \n21  facing due to climate change. \n22  I.  Sariel was greatly distressed when she learned that \n23  MI  ontana was almost at the point of no return with respect to climate change. \n24  198.  PlaintiffKian Tanner lives on his family's property in \n25  Bigfork, Montana. \nI \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 52 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  a.  Kian's property has been degraded by wildfire smoke. \n2  b.  Kian is a passionate fly fisher and has fished with his \n3  dad since he was about four years old. Kian hopes he will be able to preserve this \n4  tradition and fish for the next fifty years or more. \n5  C.  The warmer water temperatures, lower oxygen levels, \n6  and declining instream flows due to climate disruption are harming Montana's \n7  rivers and fish. These climate impacts have decreased fishing opportunities for \n8  Kian as he has had to cancel fishing trips due to wildfires. Not being able to fish \n9  is devastating for Kian. \n10  d.  Kian lives near and enjoys visiting and recreating in \n11  Glacier National Park, which is a very special place for Kian. He is distressed he \n12  will never be able to see the natural glaciers as they have historically existed, and \n13  as other generations experienced them. \n14  e.  Kian enjoys downhill and cross-country skiing, which \n15  is an activity he does with his mom, who taught him to ski. Kian cross-county \n16  skis on his family's property. Impacts to the climate have reduced his \n17  opportunities to downhill and cross-country ski. \n18  f.  Increased smoke in the summer has harmed Kian's \n19 \nability to play soccer, fish, and otherwise recreate outside, activities which are \n20 \ncrucial for his emotional health and foundational to his family. Kian's soccer \n21  practices have been cancelled due to heat and wildfire smoke. \n22 \ng.  The smoke often forces Kian to seek refuge indoors, \n23 \nlhich makes him feel very claustrophobic. \n24  I/Ill \n25  I/Ill \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 53 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  h.  Kian's fears about impacts to the climate take an \n2  emotional toll on him and he feels a heavy burden to carry the mantel of the \n3  generation that must address climate change. \n4  199.  Plaintiff Georgianna Fischer ( Georgi) is from Bozeman, \n5  Montana. \n6  a.  Georgi's family has lived in Montana for generations. \n7  Goergi's great grandmother, Mary \"Polly\" Wisner Renne, is someone that Georgi \n8  admires because of her work to protect Montana's environment.  Renne was a \n9  key figure in establishing protections for the Lee Metcalf Wilderness Area. \n10  b.  Georgi is a competitive Nordic skier. She has \n11  competed on the national level, including Junior National Championships, U.S. \n12  National Championships, and the 2021 NCAA competition. She trains eleven \n13  months of the year, six days a week. Georgi's ability to compete and participate \n14  in Nordic skiing has been directly impacted by climate disruption. Declining \n15  winter snowpack has inhibited Georgi's ability to complete necessary and \n16  appropriate training and hinders her ability to continue to compete at a high level, \n17 \nwhich adversely impacts her health and mental well-being. \n18 \nC.  In recent years there has not been enough snow to \n19  groom trails or create tracks in the snow to Nordic ski race until January, \n20  although historically tracks were created in November. \n21  d.  Georgi's  summer  Nordic  skiing  training  has  been \n22 \nimpacted  by  wildfires  and  wildfire  smoke.  Practices  have  been  cancelled  or \n23 \nclrtailed due to smoke and the smoke prevents Georgi from training at a high \n24  iltensity. Georgi is increasingly worried about the long-term effects that the \n25 \nelposure to heavy wildfire smoke while training has on her health and respiratory \nI \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 54 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  system. Extreme heat also harms Georgi and her ability to recreate and train \n2  outdoors. The heat has caused her to feel dizzy, nauseous, generally unwell, and \n3  has caused persistent nosebleeds that led Georgi to seek medical attention. \n4  e.  Georgi enjoys paddleboarding, rafting, backpacking, \n5  hiking, and other outdoor activities. Georgi's recreation on Montana's rivers has \n6  been impaired due to low water levels and stream flows. Georgi and her family \n7  have had to cancel river rafting trips, including one on the Smith River, due to \n8  low stream flow. \n9  f.  Georgi experiences feelings of despair and \n10  hopelessness because of the declining winter snowpack and what that trend \n11  entails for her snow-based sport. \n12  200.  Kathryn Gibson-Snyder (Grace) is from Missoula, Montana. \n13  a.  Grace's recreation on Montana's rivers and streams \n14  has been affected due to both low water levels and flooding conditions. Because \n15  of climate change, Grace's access to the Clark Fork River for recreational \n16  activities has been increasingly impaired, limiting her ability to enjoy activities \n17  important to her health and family. \n18  b.  Grace enjoys many outdoor activities, including long-\n19  distance biking, hiking, soccer, and kayaking. \n20  C.  Grace has been harmed by wildfire smoke and \n21  extreme heat; which have adversely impacted her ability to play competitive \n22  soccer. Smoke and heat have led to fewer soccer practices and the cancellation of \n23  games. Wildfires have impacted Grace's ability to go outside, enjoy outdoor \n24  ~ctivities, and have placed her safety, health, and well-being at risk. \nI \nIr!/ \n25 \nI \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 55 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  d.  One of Grace's environmental community education \n2  events was cancelled due to wildfire smoke. \n3  e.  Grace has had hiking activities impacted by wildfire \n4  smoke. \n5  f.  Grace experiences psychological harms, is distressed \n6  from day-to-day climate conditions, and is anxious about climate change. It is \n7  devastating for Grace to think that Montana's special landscapes, like Glacier \n8  National Park's glaciers, will not exist as they have in the past, or at all, when she \n9  is older. \n10  g.  Even though Grace would like to raise children in \n11  Montana, she questions whether she can morally bring children into the world, \n12  because of her knowledge and fear of the world that her children would grow up \n13  in if climate change is not ameliorated. \n14  201.  Plaintiff Olivia Vesovich is from Missoula, Montana. \n15  a.  Olivia has exercise-induced asthma and is therefore \n16  particularly vulnerable to smoke-filled air. In smoky conditions, Olivia feels she \n17  is suffocating if she spends more than thirty minutes outdoors. During smoky \n18  conditions, Olivia is forced to stay inside and reduce or eliminate the outdoor \n19  activities she enjoys. Olivia has been forced to spend recent summers away from \n20  Montana due to the smoke-filled air and her asthma. \n21  b.  Olivia suffers from spring pollen allergies, which \n1 \n' \n22  force her to stay indoors and prevent her from engaging in the recreational \n23  dctivities she enjoys. Olivia's spring allergies cause her eyes to swell shut and \n24  Jan cause eye pain for weeks at a time. Olivia's allergies have become \nI \nI  •  1  . \n25  progressive y worse m recent years. \nI \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 56 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  C.  Olivia is affected emotionally and psychologically by \n2  climate change, and experiences bouts of depression when she thinks about the \n3  dire projections of the future. Olivia would like to have children of her own, but \n4  she questions whether this is an option in a world devastated by the effects of \nI \n5  c:limate change. \nI \n6  !  d.  Olivia experiences psychological harms and is \n7  distressed from day-to-day climate conditions and is anxious about climate \n8  change. There are days when Olivia feels paralyzed by the impacts and threats of \n9  climate change and she fears that it is too late to address climate change. \n10  e.  For Olivia, climate anxiety is like an elephant sitting \n11  ~n her chest and it feels like a crushing weight. This climate anxiety makes it \n12  Hard for her to breathe. \n13  202.  Plaintiff Claire Vlases is from Bozeman, Montana. \n14  a.  Claire works as a ski instructor at Big Sky Resort, and \n15  lier ability to earn money is hanned by climate disruption, which is decreasing \n16  Jiontana's winter snowpack and the number of days Claire can work. Claire has \n17  been sent home from her job as a ski instructor without working her scheduled \n18  shift, and without pay, because of insufficient snow. Claire relies on her income \n19  as a ski instructor, so the lost income is a financial hardship for her. \n20  b.  Claire regularly visits Glacier National Park where \nI \nI \n21  she loves to hike. Seeing the loss of glaciers in Glacier National Park is terrifying \nI \n22  for Claire and reduces her enjoyment of the park. Claire's ability to enjoy hiking \nih \n23  Glacier National Park has also been diminished due to increasing wildfire \n24  sboke, which obstructs the beautiful views and is harmful to her health. \nI \n25  Ill!! \ni \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 57 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  C.  Claire has been harmed by the reduced snowpack in \n2  Montana and the related impacts to winter sports and tourism. \n' \n3  I  d.  Claire's ability to run cross-country has been harmed \n4  by extreme heat and wildfire smoke. Claire has had cross-country practices \n5  cancelled due to dangerously smoky air quality conditions. The heat and smoke \n6  1:1ake it difficult for Claire to train and compete. \n7  e.  Claire's family has water rights to Bozeman Creek. \n8  Claire and her family use the water for drinking, plumbing, watering their garden, \n9  and all other water needs at their home. \n10  f.  Claire's water security is threatened by Montana's \n11  melting glaciers, declining snowpack, and increasing summer drought conditions, \n12  \\1/hich lead to water scarcity and low water levels in Bozeman Creek. \n13  g.  As an individual born with a disability, Claire relies \n14  on the outdoors for recreational therapy to replace the physical therapy her \n15  i~surance stopped providing when she was ten years old. The outdoors helped \n16  G:laire to grow strong and she continues to rely on activities like skiing, biking, \n17  hiking, and running to maintain her physical health.

A temporary bridge was also washed away due to \n2  extreme flooding. Eva's family eventually decided to relocate because of this \n3  hardship. Being cut off from town was very stressful for Eva and her family. \n4  e.  Eva moved to Livingston and now lives near the \n5  Yellowstone River. Eva feels a strong connection to the river. In 2022, there was \n6  major flooding along the Yellowstone River, including in Livingston. [CW-41; \n7  JS-I l]. Eva helped fill sandbags to hold back the flood waters. [PI08, Pl09]. A \n8  park near Eva's home was underwater. [P 11 O]. Eva saw her community and close \n9  friends lose property due to flooding. \n10  f.  The 2022 flooding in Livingston caused Eva acute \n' \n11  emotional distress, panic, and dread. Parks and other public places she often \n12  visits were significantly damaged, preventing her enjoyment of them. \n13  g.  Eva's access to the Yellowstone River in summer \n14  2016 was significantly curtailed, as a 180-mile portion of the river was closed for \n15  several weeks due to a parasite growth in cutthroat and rainbow trout perpetuated \n16  by abnormally high air temperatures and historically low river flows. \n17  h.  Eva has experienced forced relocation and the loss of \n18  ties to the land. \n19  1.  Eva has had her ability to access Montana's rivers for \n20  other recreational activities limited due to river conditions. \n21  j.  Wildfire smoke has impacted Eva's ability to hike and \n22  s~end time outdoors with her family. \n23  k.  Eva is anxious about how she, her family and \n24  community can adapt to the devastation of public resources and infrastructure as \nI \ntlie \n25  impacts of climate change worsen. Eva is increasingly anxious about the \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 60 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  climate change impacts she and her family are experiencing. She is distressed \n2  that climate change will worsen if action is not immediately taken. \n3  205.  Plaintiff Mica K. is from Missoula, Montana. \n4  a.  Rising temperatures and wildfires resulting from \n5  climate change make it difficult for Mica to recreate outdoors and participate in \n6  activities he loves, and which are important to his health and well-being. \n7  b.  Mica has been forced to spend extended periods of \n8  time indoors and has lost school recess time because of wildfire smoke. In 2019, \n9  a forest fire started approximately one mile from Mica's home, and Mica is \n10  anxious that, as climate change worsens, he may lose his family home. \n11  C.  Wildfire smoke has impacted Mica's training as a \n12  long-distance runner. Mica is an avid runner, running his first half-marathon \n13  when he was nine. He runs regularly with his dad. Running is a way for Mica to \n14  be in nature and relieve stress. Running in smoke makes Mica feel sick, so he \n15  cannot run as much due to increasingly smoky summers in Missoula. Smoke has \nI \n16  liinited Mica's ability to train and compete in sports. \n17  d.  Mica gets frustrated when he is required to stay \n18  indoors during the summer because of wildfire smoke. \n19  e.  Mica's family now avoids camping and other outdoor \n20  activities in August and September due to wildfire smoke and its negative effect \n21  on Mica's health. \n22  f.  Mica was recently diagnosed with exercise-induced \nI \nI \n23  asthma, which puts him at greater risk for respiratory hardship when the air is \n' \n24  smoky. \n25 \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 61 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  g.  Mica's favorite animal is the pika. Mica understands \n2  the pika is uniquely vulnerable to climate impacts, and its survival is in jeopardy \nI \n3  due to climate change. \n4  h.  Mica's outdoor recreation activities such as enjoying \n5  the views of glaciers in Glacier National Park are disrupted by climate change. \n6  Seeing the glaciers recede in Glacier National Park is depressing for Mica. \n7  Climate change causes Mica to feel anxious, stressed, \n1. \nI \n8  apd depressed, and makes it hard for him to sleep at times. \n9  206.  Plaintiffs Jeffrey K. and Nathaniel K. are brothers who grew \n10  up in Montana City, Montana. \n11  a.  Jeffrey K. has pulmonary sequestration and is \n12  uniquely susceptible to respiratory complications, such as infections. Nathaniel \nI \n13  K. also has respiratory issues. Both Jeffrey and Nate are therefore especially \nI \n14  v11lnerable to poor air quality, such as smoke-filled air caused by wildfires. [LB \n' \n15  {87:21-488:11, 505:4-25]. \n16  1  b.  The increasing length and severity of the wildfire \n17  season harms Jeffrey's and Nathaniel's health, especially given their young age \nI \n18  ahd pre-existing respiratory health conditions.  It has forced their family to make \nI \n19  changes in daily activities. [LB 487:21-488:11, 505:4-25]. \n20  207.  Plaintiffs Ruby D. and Lilian D. are from Bozeman, \n21  Montana. Shane Doyle is their father and he testified on their behalf. \n22  I  a.  Ruby and Lilian are members of the Crow Nation. \n23  ~uby and Lilian regularly travel to the Crow Reservation to visit family members \n24  anI  d engage m.   trad  1't 1' 0na1   cu1 t ura1   actl.v 1.t 1. es. \nI \n25  !!Ill \n' \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 62 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  b.  Ruby's Crow name is Biach;igata, which means \n2  \"Pretty Woman.\" Lilian's Crow name is Malesch, which means \"Loved by \n3  Many.\" \ni \n' \n4  C.  Abnormal and extreme weather conditions caused by \n5  climate change have impacted Ruby's and Lilian's ability to engage and \n6  otherwise partake in cultural practices that are central to their spirituality and \n7  individual dignity. \nI \n8  d.  Ruby and Lilian visit their family on the Crow \n9  Reservation several times a year. Ruby and Lilian attend Crow Fair on the Crow \n10  Reservation every year. Crow Fair takes place each August and is a large \nI \n! \n11  gathering to celebrate cultural activities and events. Many people, including \n12  Ruby and Lilian, stay in teepees. Attending Crow Fair is a highlight for Ruby and \n' \n13  IJilian. Ruby and Lilian love dancing at Crow Fair, and enjoy the parades, the \ni \n14  rodeo, and doing family events. \ni \n15  e.  In recent years, increasing temperatures at Crow Fair \nI \n16  have made it hard to wear traditional regalia and participate in cultural activities \nI \n17  because it is dangerously hot, sometimes over 100 degrees. \n18  f.  Wildfire smoke has also made it difficult for Ruby \n19  and Lilian to enjoy the Crow Fair. \n20  g.  It is a huge disappointment to Ruby and Lilian when \n21  they are unable to dance or participate in other events at the Crow Fair due to \n22  heat or smoke. \n23  h.  Crow Fair used to coincide with when chokecherries \n24  were ripe, which was important because many meals eaten at Crow Fair involved \nI \n25  II/II \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 63 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\nI  9hokecherries. In recent years chokecherry harvest has become much harder to \n2  predict, and drought has meant there are less chokecherries available for the \nI \n3  festival. \n4  Ruby and Lilian pick chokecherries with their family \n5  as part of the Crow tradition. They enjoy participating in the process of picking \n6  the berries, processing them into syrup, and eating them. But due to drought and \nI \n7  heat, fewer chokecherries are available and some stands that usually have berries \n8  ~ad none. Increased wildfire frequency has impacted the ability of Ruby and \n9  Lilian to participate in these traditional cultural practices. \n10  J.  Ruby was diagnosed with asthma when she was eight \nII  years old and had an acute form of pneumonia. As a result, Ruby stays inside \n12  when it is smoky, and Lilian often stays inside too. This is a disappointment for \n13  ~uby and Lilian. \n14  I  k.  During the Bridger fire, which burned near Bozeman \n15  i4 2020, Ruby and Lilian were worried to see a fire so close to their home and it \nI \n16  brought up concerns about whether they were safe. \n17  I  I.  Climate disruption has impacted Ruby and Lilian's \ni \n18  01.Jtdoor recreation activities, such as rafting, swimming, and floating. Drought \nI \n19  has created low river conditions that have impacted Ruby and Lilian's ability to \n20  enjoy recreating on the river because it has such low flow. \nI \n21  m.  Ruby and Lilian believe that protecting Montana's \ni \n22  environment and natural resources is important because in their culture taking \n23  care of the Earth is their responsibility. \nI \n24  208. The testimony of the Youth Plaintiffs and their guardian was \n1 \n25  cr~dible and was undisputed. \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 64 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\nI \nVI. \n1  DEFENDANTS' ACTIONS CONTRIBUTE TO CLIMATE \n2  CHANGE AND HARM PLAINTIFFS. \n3  209.  Anne Hedges received a B.S. in environmental policy \n4  analysis and planning from the University of California at Davis in 1988 and a \n5  Master of Environmental Law, magna cum laude, from Vermont Law School in \n6  1993. She is Co-Director and Director of Policy and Legislative Affairs at the \n7  r-.Jontana Environmental Information Center (MEIC). She directs MEIC's \n8  ptogram work, including its legislative, regulatory, policy, and legal \n9  activities. She has worked at MEIC since 1993, and her work is focused on \n10  pollution-related policy issues in Montana, with a primary emphasis on impacts \nI \n11  to air, water, landscapes, and climate from fossil fuels. Ms. Hedges is a well-\n12  qualified expert, and the Court found her testimony informative and credible. \n13  210.  Peter Erickson received a bachelor's degree in Geology in \n14  1998 at Carleton College, Minnesota, as well as coursework in intermediate \n' \nI \n15  microeconomics and macroeconomics at the University of Washington. Mr. \n16  E~ickson has worked as an environmental and climate policy and technical \n17  al}alyst in greenhouse gas emission accounting, most recently with the Stockholm \n18  Ehvironment Institute, an international research institution providing, in part, \nI \n19  technical analysis to government and NGOs on the details of climate policy and \n1\n20  emissions accounting. Mr. Erickson has served on both national and international \n21  cJmmittees devoted to GHG emissions accounting: one convened by the \n22  International Council of Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) to create a U.S. \n' \n23  Cbmmunity-scale GHG Emissions Accounting and Reporting Standard, and one \nI \n24  convened by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol to create the Greenhouse Gas \n25  Mitigation Goals Standard. [P192]. Mr. Erickson testified about Montana's fossil \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 65 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  fµel consumption, extraction, and infrastructure, focusing on three categories: \n2  (1) extraction of fossil fuels; (2) processing and transportation of fossil fuels; and \n3  (3) consumption of fossil fuels by end users. For each of these categories, Mr. \n4  Erickson quantified the amount of coal, oil, and gas and translated that in units of \nI \n5  carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions released from the fuels once they are combusted. \n6  Mr. Erickson added up all the coal, oil, and gas to determine the emissions \n7  associated with the extraction, consumption, and transportation of those fuels. In \n8  his opinion, emissions from Montana's fossil fuel consumption, extraction, and \n9  infrastructure are globally significant quantities. Mr. Erickson is a well-qualified \n10  expert, and the Court found his testimony informative and credible. \n11  211.  Defendants offered the testimony of Dr. Terry Anderson as \n12  an expert economist. Purporting to be based on data from the Energy Information \n13  Agency (EIA), Dr. Anderson provided extremely limited testimony in response \n14  to three questions: (1) the total greenhouse gas emissions for the world; (2) the \nI \n15  2920 greenhouse gas consumption emissions for the state of Montana; and (3) the \ni \n16  2022 greenhouse gas consumption emissions for the state of Montana. Dr. \nI \n17  Anderson's testimony was not well-supported, contained errors, and was not \n18  given weight by the Court. \n19  212.  Defendants permit three types of fossil fuel-related \nI \n20  ac;tivities: (1) extraction of fossil fuels; (2) processing and transportation of fossil \n21  fuels; and (3) consumption of fossil fuels by end users. [PE 914:12-915:3; PE-9]. \ni \n22  213.  Fossil fuel consumption includes any combustion, or \n23  burning, of these fuels, primarily for energy. Fossil fuel extraction is mining, \n24  pJmping, drilling, or otherwise taking fossil fuels out of the ground for purposes \n''  \n25  of making fuels. Fossil fuel processing and transportation are activities that occur \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 66 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  between that initial extraction and combustion by the end user, such as refining, \n2  or moving the fuels in bulk from one place to another. [PE 914: 14-21; PE-11]. \n3  I  214.  It is possible to calculate the amount of CO and GHG \n2 \nI \n4  epiissions that results from fossil fuel extraction, processing and transportation, \n5  and consumption activities that are authorized by Defendants. [PE 915:13-21; \n6  P311; PE-10]. \n7  215.  Data indicates that in 2019, the total annual fossil fuels \nI \n8  e~tracted in Montana led to about 70 million tons of CO being released into the \n2 \n9  atmosphere once the fuels were combusted, which is higher than many other \n10  countries, including Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Spain, or the United Kingdom. \n11  [PE 922:23-923:3, 928:18-929:11, 950:13-14; PE-17]. \n12  216.  Data indicates that in 2019, total annual fossil fuels \n13  c~nsumed in Montana led to about 32 million tons of CO being released into the \n2 \n14  Atmosphere. \n15  217.  In 2019, total annual fossil fuels transported and processed \ni \n16  iI\\ and through Montana led to at least 80 million tons of CO being released into \n2 \n17  the atmosphere once those fuels were combusted. [PE 923:19-924:4, 950:14-15]. \n18  That is equivalent to all the GHG emissions from Columbia, which has 50 times \n19  tJe population of Montana. [PE 930: 11-23; PE-17, PE-20]. \n20  218.  Accounting for overlap among fossil fuels extracted, \n21  cJnsumed, processed, and transported in Montana, the total CO emissions due to \n2 \n22  Montana's fossil fuel-based economy is about 166 million tons CO [PE 924:5-\n2• \n23  18, 950:16-18; PE-18]. This is a conservative estimate and does not include all \nI \n24  the GHG emissions, including methane, for which Montana is responsible. \n25  [PE 928:5-9; PE-17]. \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 67 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  219.  The 166 million tons CO2 due to Montana's fossil fuel-based \n2  e'conomy is equivalent to the emissions from Argentina (with forty-seven million \n3  r1sidents), the Netherlands (with eighteen million residents), or Pakistan (with \nI \n4  2·43 million residents). [PE 931 :22-932:9; PE-22]. \n5  220.  In terms of per capita emissions, Montana's consumption of \n6  fossil fuels is disproportionately large and only five states have greater per capita \n7  emissions. [PE 930:19-23, 938:23-25; PE-25]. \n8  iI   221.  The cumulative CO2 emissions from all fossil fuels extracted \n9  in Montana since 1960 is 3.7 billion metric tons of CO2. [PE 941 :9-19; PE-26]. \n10  222.  Montana is a major emitter ofGHG emissions in the world \nI \n11  in absolute terms, in per person terms, and historically. [PE 930: 19-23]. \n12  223.  Montana has six coal mines that Defendants authorize: \n13  sbring Creek Mine, Rosebud Mine, Decker Mine, Absaloka, Bull Mountain, and \n14  S~vage Mine. [PE 942: 16-943 :5]. Montana also has the largest estimated \n15  recoverable coal reserves in the U.S., and Montana is a substantial exporter of \n16  c6al. [AH 791:1-25; AH-7-AH-13; PE 946:1-3]. \nI \n17  ,  224.  Montana's annual coal production is 34 million short tons of \n18  c~al. [PE 946:5-22]. Montana's coal reserves, as of 2019, are 707 million short \nI \n19  toIn  s. [PE 945:21-25; PE-37]. \n20  225.  Montana is a substantial producer of oil and gas in the U.S. \n21  Dbfendants authorize the drilling and production of oil and gas in Montana. [PE \nI \n22  932:18-933:5, 949:7-15]. \n23  226.  Montana has approximately 4,000 oil producing wells with \n24  an annual oil production of twenty-three million barrels. As of 2019, Montana's \n25  oil reserves were 298 million barrels. [PE 946:23-947:8; PE-36, PE-37]. \n' \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 68 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  227.  Montana has approximately 5,000 gas producing wells with \n2  an annual oil production of forty-three billion cubic feet. As of 2019, Montana's \n3  gas reserves were 613 billion cubic feet. [PE 947:14-19; PE-36, PE-37]. \n4  228.  Between 1960 and 2019 the fastest growing category of \n5  fossil fuel consumption in Montana has been gas. [PE 942: 11-12]. \n6  229.  Montana is home to four state-authorized oil refineries. [PE \n7  948:22-24, 949:10-15]. Montana's refineries process crude oil largely from \n8  Canada and Wyoming and distribute the refined product by railroad and pipeline \n9  throughout Montana and to nearby states. [PE 948: 17-949:23; PE-38]. \n' \n10  230.  Montana's land contains a significant quantity of fossil fuels \nI \n11  yet to be extracted. [Def. Answer, Doc. 54 ,i 139; PE 945:21-946:4, 947:16-19, \nI \n12  945:1-25]. \n13  \\  231.  Montana's GHG emissions have grown significantly since \n14  the passage of the 1972 Montana Constitution. [AH 940: 15-941 :2; PE-27, \nI \n15  PE-28]. \n16  I  232.  Defendants continue to approve permits and licenses for \n17  new fossil fuel activities. (AH 862:1-5; SN 1354:12-16]. \n18  233.  Defendants have authorized fossil fuel extraction, \n19  transportation, and combustion resulting in high levels of GHG emissions that \n20  cdntribute to climate change. [AH 831 :22-832: 1, 846:25-847: 11, 845: 14-846:3; \nI \n21  AH-50-AH-61; PE 932:18-933:5]. \nI \n22  !  234.  In taking action to authorize fossil fuel extraction, since \n23  2011 Defendants have not considered or disclosed GHG or climate \ni \n24  ch,ange impacts in their environmental reviews because they were statutorily \nI \n25  precluded from doing so. (AH 836:2-13, 845:14-846:3; AH-50-AH-61]. \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 69 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  235.  DEQ issues air quality permits to facilities that emit GHG \n,r \n2  emissions. [AH 788:13-23; Def. Answer, Doc. 11  90]. \n3  236.  DEQ has authorized fossil fuel extraction, transportation, \n4  and combustion, which generate GHG emissions, contribute to climate change, \n5  and harm Plaintiffs. [AH 845:14-846:24; AH-50-AH-61]. \n6  237.  What happens in Montana has a real impact on fossil fuel \n7  energy systems, CO emissions, and global warming. [PE 976:8-24; PE-40]. \n2 \n8  VII.  THE MEPA LIMITATION AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION. \n9  238.  The 2011 MEPA Limitation provided in pertinent part: \n10  (2)(a) Except as provided in subsection (2)(6),  an environmental \nreview  conducted  pursuant  to  subsection  (1)  may  not  include  a \n11 \nreview of actual or potential impacts beyond Montana's borders. It \n12  may  not  include  actual  or  potential  impacts  that  are  regional, \nnational, or global in nature. \n13 \n14  239.  While this case has been pending, Judge Moses held in \n15  MEICv.DEQ: \n16  Here, the plain language of MCA 75-1-201(2)(a) precludes agency \nMEPA review of environmental impacts that are 'beyond Montana's \n17 \nborders,'  but it does not absolve DEQ of its  MEPA obligation to \n18  evaluate  a project's  environmental  impacts  within Montana.  DEQ \nmisinterprets  the  statute.  They  must  take  a  hard  look  at  the \n19 \ngreenhouse  gas  effects  of this  project  as  it relates  to  the  impacts \n20  within the Montana borders. \n21 \nOrder on Summary Judgment at 29:3-9, MEIC v. DEQ, No. DV-56-2021-1307 \n22  (Thirteenth Dist. Ct., April 6, 2023). \n23  240.  Eight days after Judge Moses' ruling, on April 14, 2023, HB 971 \n24  tas introduced in the Montana Legislature. HB 971 was passed, sent to enrolling \n25  !Ill/ \nI \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 70 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  on May 1 and signed by the Governor on May 10, 2023. HB 971 clarifies the \n2  MEP A Limitation to say: \n3  (2)(a) Except as provided in subsection (2)(b), an environmental \nreview conducted pursuant to subsection (1) may not include an \n4 \nevaluation of greenhouse gas emissions and corresponding impacts \n5  to the climate in the state or beyond the state's borders. \n(b) An environmental review conducted pursuant to subsection (1) \n6 \nmay include an evaluation if: \n7  (i) conducted jointly by a state agency and a federal agency to the \nextent the review is required by the federal agency; or \n8 \n(ii) the United States congress amends the federal Clean Air Act to \n9  include carbon dioxide emissions as a regulated pollutant. \n10 \nMont. Code Ann.§ 75-l-201(2)(a) (enacted May 10, 2023) (new language \n11  underlined). \n12  241.  On May 19, 2023, various provisions of MEPA   that pertain \n13  to legal challenges to MEP A environmental reviews were amended when the \n14  Governor signed SB 557 into law. SB 557 created Mont. Code Ann. \n15  § 75-l-201(6)(a)(ii), which states: \n16  (ii) An action alleging noncompliance or inadequate compliance with \na requirement of parts 1 through 3, including a challenge to an \n17 \nagency's decision that an environmental review is not required or a \n18  claim that the environmental review was inadequate based in whole or \nin part upon greenhouse gas emissions and impacts to the climate in \n19 \nMontana or beyond Montana's borders, cannot vacate, void, or delay \n20  a lease, permit, license, certificate, authorization, or other entitlement \nor authority unless the review is required by a federal agency or the \n21 \nUnited States congress amends the federal Clean Air Act to include \n22 \ncarbon dioxide as a regulated pollutant. \n23 \nM'  ont. Code Ann.§ 75-l-201(6)(a)(ii) (enacted by SB 557, 68th Legislature \nI \n24  ~2023)) (signed May 19, 2023). \n! \n25  I!!!!! \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 71 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  242.  Other components of SB 557 limit who can challenge an \n2  agency's final decision, the scope of the challenge, and require challengers to pay \n3  a fee to compile and submit a certified record to the reviewing court. [AH 825:4-\n4  826:18; AH-45]. \n5  243.  Both the 2011 and 2023 versions of the MEPA Limitation \n6  allowed Projects to be permitted without consideration of their impacts that \n7  increase emissions of greenhouse gases. [AH 851:9-852:23; AH-51-AH-60]. \n8  244.  The State has known of the dangerous impacts ofGHG \n9  emissions and climate change for at least the last thirty years. [CW 256:6-15; AH \n10  802:13-18; AH-25, AH-26; P17, P19]. \n11  245.  State government and scientists have known about the \n12  international scientific consensus of the dangers posed by climate change since at \n13  least the 1990s when the IPCC started issuing climate assessment reports. The \n14  State also had access to the congressionally mandated national climate \n15  assessments undertaken in 2000, 2009, 2014, and 2017. [SR 139: 12-140: 1; \n16  AH 797:5-798:6, 802:13-18; CW 256:9-24; AH-32, AH-33, AH-34; P28, P262, \n17  P263]. \n18  246.  In 2007, Defendants DNRC, DEQ, and the Office of the \n19  Governor were made aware of the issues concerning the impacts of climate \n20  change in Montana, including rising temperatures, accelerating warming, and \n21  ~educed snowpack, and the need for Montana to reduce its GHG emissions, as a \n22  result of the 2007 Montana Climate Change Action Plan and the 2007 Montana \n23  yreenhouse Gas Inventory and Reference Case Projections 1990-2020. [CW \nI \n24  f43:14-244:3, 256:19-24; CW-12, CW-13, CW-14; AH 806:17-807:20; AH-35, \n25  tH-36, AH-37; P2, Pl8]. \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 72 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  247.  In 2017, Defendants DNRC, DEQ, and the Office of the \n2  Governor were again informed by the 2017 Montana Climate Assessment of the \n3  issues concerning the impacts of climate change in Montana. [CW 243: 14-244:3; \n4  AH 832:12-24; AH-49; P6]. \n5  248.  In 2019, when then Governor Steve Bullock promulgated \n6  Executive Order No. 8-2019 creating the Montana Climate Solutions Council, \n7  Defendants knew that \"climate change poses a serious threat to Montana's \n8  natural resources, public health, communities, and economy,\" and \"Montanans \n9  understand that climate change is occurring and are concerned about the impacts \n10  it will have on current and future generations.\" [AH 832:25-833:6; AH-49; PIO]. \n11  249.  In August 2020, when the Montana Climate Solutions \n12  Council released its final report, the Montana Climate Solutions Plan (Climate \n13  Solutions Plan), the State knew how climate change was already harming \n14  Montana and its residents, through rising temperatures, early snowmelt, earlier \n15  spring runoff, flooding, changes in water availability and stream temperatures, \n16  increase in forest mortality due to insects, and increasing wildfires. [CW 244: \n17  7-22; AH 833:7-835:10; AH-49; P36]. \n18  250.  The Cl_imate Solutions Plan included thirty-seven \n19  recommendations and strategies to reduce Montana's GHG emissions. [AH \n20  833:7-835:10; AH-49; P36]. Defendants have not implemented the \n21  recommendations. [AH 835:8-10]. \n22  251.  In 2021, the report Climate Change and Human Health in \n23  Montana was distributed to State officials. [CW 245:2-246-1]. \n' \nI \n24  252.  Prior to 2011, Defendants were quantifying and disclosing \nI \n25  GHG emissions and climate impacts from fossil fuel projects, including, for \nI \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 73 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  example, the Silver Bow Generation Project, the Roundup Power Project (Bull \n2  Mountain), and the Highwood Generating Station. [AH 808:10-19, 808:20-\n3  809: 18, 809: 19-810:24, 811 :8-24, 813 :6-23; AH-38, AH-39, AH-40; P23 l, P224, \n4  P232,P225,P226,P229,P237]. \n5  253.  Since 2011, because of the MEP A Limitation, Defendants \n6  have been statutorily prevented from considering climate change impacts and \n7  GHG emissions when conducting environmental reviews. [AH 814:6-21, \n8  816:17-817:14, 818:11-819:10; SN 1361:6-9; AH-42]. \n9  254.  The MEPA Limitation explicitly prohibits state agencies \n10  from considering the impacts of climate change and GHG emissions in \n11  ~nvironmental reviews under MEPA. [AH 814:22-815:9, 816: 17-817: 14, \nI \n12  818:11-819:10; SN 1361:6-9; AH-42]. \n13  255.  Pursuant to the MEPA Limitation, the State has ignored \nI \n14  GHG emissions and climate impacts when authorizing fossil fuels activities. [A  H \n' \n15  814:22-815 :9, 816: 17-817: 14, 818: 11-819: 10 ; AH-51-AH-60]. \n16  256.  The MEPA Limitation constrains Defendants from making \n17  fully informed decisions through their environmental analysis about the scope \n18  and scale of the impacts to the environment and Montana's children and youth \n19  when conducting environmental reviews. Mont. Code Ann. § 75-l-201(6)(a)(ii) \n20  attempts to constrain the authority of courts when reviewing agency permitting \n21  decisions and MEPA   analyses. \n22  257.  If the MEP A Limitation is declared unconstitutional, state \n23  Jgencies will be capable of considering GHG emissions and the impacts of \n24  Jrojects on climate change. [AH 807:23-808:19, 821:16-25; SN 1437:4-8; P231, \n7I \n25  224,P232,P225,P226,P229,P237]. \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 74 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  258.  Montana's river and lake ecosystems are interconnected \n2  with each other, as well as aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems beyond Montana's \n3  borders. Because of this interconnectivity to ecosystems both within and beyond \n4  Montana's borders, any prohibition on the consideration of either impacts within \n5  Montana or regional impacts of climate change, is not scientifically supported. \n6  [JS 642:23-15, 646:2-647:2]. \n7  259.  Defendants' application of the l'vIEPA Limitation during \n8  environmental review of fossil fuel and GHQ-emitting projects, prevents the \n9  availability of vital information that would allow Defendants to comply with the \n10  Montana Constitution and prevent the infringement of Plaintiffs' rights. [AH \n11  810:13-24, 816:9-16, 820:16-821:11, 822:1-823:10; AH-51-AH-60]. \n12  260.  The State authorizes energy projects and facilities within \n13  Montana that emit substantial levels of GHG pollution, including, but not limited \n14  to, projects that burn and promote the use of fossil fuels, but pursuant to the \n15  MEP A Limitation, Defendants do not consider climate change and GHG \n16  emissions and measure those individual and cumulative emissions against the \n17  standards the Montana Constitution imposes on the State to protect people's \n18  rights, before authorizing energy projects and facilities. [AH 818:25-819:10, \n19  824:8-825 :3; AH-51-AH-60]. \n20  261.  The State issues permits, licenses, and leases that result in \n21  GHG emissions without considering how the additional GHG emissions will \n22  contribute to climate change or be consistent with the standards the Montana \n23  Constitution imposes on the State to protect people's rights. [AH 832:2-11, \nI \n24  841:23-844:9, 843:1-844:5, 844:19-846:3; AH-51-AH-60]. \nI \n25  I/Ill \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 75 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  262.  The State authorizes four private coal power plants to \n2  operate in the State, which generate 30% of Montana's energy production, \n3  without considering how the additional GHG emissions will contribute to climate \n4  change or be consistent with the standards the Montana Constitution imposes on \n5  the State to protect people's rights. [AH 792:1-21]. \n6  263.  The State continues to permit surface coal mining and \n7  \\eclamation in Montana, which results in substantial GHG emissions, without \n8  considering how the additional GHG emissions will contribute to climate change \n9  or be consistent with the standards the Montana Constitution imposes on the \n10  State to protect people's rights. [AH 836: 16-846:3; PE 934:14-15]. \nI \n11  I  264.  The State authorizes, through licenses and leases, the \n12  exploration for and extraction of oil and gas in Montana, without considering \n' \nI \n13  how the additional GHG emissions will contribute to climate change or be \n14  consistent with the standards the Montana Constitution imposes on the State to \n15  protect people's rights. [AH 793 :6-18, 845 :20-846:9]. \n16  265.  Defendants have and continue to authorize projects, \n17  activities, and plans that cause emissions of GHG pollution into the atmosphere, \n18  all while ignoring the impacts of climate change and GHG emissions due to the \n19  MEPA Limitation. [AH 836:16-846:3; AH-51-AH-60; PE 932:18-933:5]. For \n20  example: \n21  a.  Defendants authorize and certify energy projects and \n22  facilities within the State of Montana that emit substantial levels of GHG \n23  pollution, including, but not limited to, projects that bum and promote the use of \nI \n24  fossil fuels.

DEQ approved the AM4 expansion of Rosebud Strip \n2  Mine in December 2015, a 12.1-million-ton coal mine expansion. Pursuant to the \n3  MEPA   Limitation, DEQ refused to analyze how that decision would aggravate \n4  climate impacts. [AH 836:16-837:12; P259, P260, P277; AH-51]. \n5  C.  DEQ issued a MSUMRA permit to Bull Mountain \n6  Mine in January 2016, authorizing Bull Mountain Mine to produce 176 million \n7  t,ons of coal per year. DEQ refused, pursuant to the MEPA Limitation, to analyze \n8  how the decision would aggravate climate impacts. [AH 837:14-838: 16; P243, \n9  P264; AH-52]. \n10  d.  Between 2002 and 2014, DEQ issued twelve different \n11  permits for Signal Peak Energy to operate the Bull Mountain Mine. Since 2011, \n12  pursuant to the MEPA   Limitation, DEQ refused, in its environmental \n' \n13  assessments to consider how those GHG emissions would contribute to climate \n14  change or adversely impact Montana's environment and natural resources. [P245, \n15  P247,P256]. \n16  e.  DEQ approved the TR3 expansion of Decker Mine in \n17  2018, allowing for strip-mining of twenty-three million tons of coal. DEQ \n18  refused, pursuant to the MEPA   Limitation, to analyze how that decision would \n19  aggravate climate impacts. [P236, P238, P250, P252, P257-258]. \n20  f.  In 2020, DEQ approved revision to Spring Creek \n21  Mine, the largest coal mine in the State, allowing for recovery of additional \n22  seventy-two million tons of coal. In August 2019, DEQ refused, pursuant to the \n23  ~pA  Limitation, to analyze impacts on the social cost of carbon and economic \n24  impacts from climate change in its EIS.

THE MEPA LIMITATION PREVENTS FULL REVIEW OF THE \n5  TECHNOLOGICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY AVAILABLE \n6  ALTERNATIVES TO FOSSIL FUEL ENERGY IN MONTANA. \n7  269.  Dr. Mark Jacobson obtained a M.S. in Environmental \n8  Engineering, from Stanford University. Dr. Jacobson also obtained both a M.S. \n9  and later a Ph.D. in Atmospheric Sciences from UCLA. In 1994, Dr. Jacobson \n10  became an Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil & Environmental \n' \n11  Engineering at Stanford. Since 2007, he has been a full professor in that \n12  Department. Dr. Jacobson was a co-founder and is Director of Stanford's \n13  Atmosphere/Energy Program, as well as a Senior Fellow at Stanford's Precourt \n14  Institute for Energy, and Stanford's Woods Institute for the Environment. Since \n15  2008, Dr. Jacobson has been Director and Co-founder of The Solutions Project, \n16  an organization that utilizes the combined efforts of individuals in the fields of \n17  science, business, and culture to accelerate the transition to 100% renewable \n18  energy use in the United States. Starting in 1999, Dr. Jacobson began examining \n19  clean, renewable energy solutions. In 2015, this research culminated in the \n20  development ofroadmaps to transition the all-sector energy infrastructures of \n21  each of the fifty United States to 100% clean, renewable energy by 2050, which \n22  Dr. Jacobson updated in 2022. Dr. Jacobson has published six textbooks of two \n23  editions each and over 175 peer-reviewed journal articles. Dr. Jacobson's career \n24  has focused on understanding air pollution and global warming problems and \n1 \n25  c;!eveloping large-scale clean, renewable energy solutions to those problems. In \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 80 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  this case, Dr Jacobson summarized his research related to Montana and the \n2  feasibility of transitioning Montana swiftly from fossil fuels to clean and \n3  renewable energy in all sectors by mid-century, where all energy sectors include \n4  electricity, transportation, heating/cooling, and industry. Dr. Jacobson is a well \n5  qualified expert, and his testimony was informative and credible. \n6  270.  The MEPA Limitation causes the State to ignore renewable \n7  energy alternatives to fossil fuels. [MJ 1030:7-1032:24, 1035:9-23, 1069:18-\n8  1071:8, 1066:6-17, 1067:10-20; MJ-15, MJ-62, MJ-63; AH 823:15-825:3; P312]. \n9  271.  Non-fossil fuel-based energy systems across all sectors, \n10  including electricity, transportation, heating/cooling, and industry, are currently \n11  economically feasible and technologically available to employ in Montana. \n12  Experts have already prepared a roadmap for the transition of Montana's all \n13  purpose energy systems (for electricity, transportation, heating/cooling, and \n14  industry) to a 100% renewable portfolio by 2050, which, in addition to direct \n15  climate benefits, will create jobs, reduce air pollution, and save lives and costs \n16  associated with air pollution. [MJ 1030:7-1032:24, 1035:9-23, 1069:18-1071:8, \n17  1066:6-17, 1067:10-20; P312; MJ-15, MJ-62, MJ-63]. \n18  272.  It is technically and economically feasible for Montana to \n19  replace 80% of existing fossil fuel energy by 203 0 and 100% by no later than \n20  2050, but as early as 2035. [MJ 1072:4-23, 1100:9-1101 :4; P312; MJ-62, MJ-63]. \n21  A number of countries around the world with populations far larger than \n22  Montana's relied on >95% wind, water, and sunlight (WWS) to power their \n23  Jlectricity sectors in 2021. [MJ-44]. \n24  !  273.  To replace fossil fuel energy, Montana would need to \nI \n25  electrify all energy sectors with existing or near-existing appliances and \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 81 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  machines, and then generate the electricity for all sectors with 100% WWS, \n2  namely onshore wind, utility-scale photovoltaics (PV), rooftop PV, geothermal \n3  power, and hydroelectric power. [MJ 1043:9-1045:8, 1045:15-1047:10; P312; \n4  MJ-12, MJ-15, MJ-18, MJ-19, MJ-20, MJ-29]. \n5  274.  All-purpose Montana energy in 2050 can be met, for \n6  example, in one scenario, with 4.5 gigawatts (GW) of onshore wind, 3 GW of \n7  rooftop PV, 2.9 GW of utility-scale PV, 0.17 GW of geothermal electricity, and \n8  2.7 GW ofhydropower (which already exists). [MJ 1057:2-1058:15; MJ-29]. \n9  ,  275.  Converting from fossil fuel energy to renewable energy \n10  lould eliminate another $21 billion in climate costs in 2050 to Montana and the \nI \n11  world. Most noticeable to those in Montana, converting to wind, water, and solar \nI \n' \n12  energy would reduce annual total energy costs for Montanans from $9.1 to $2.8 \n13  billion per year, or by $6.3 billion per year (69.6% savings). [MJ-39]. The total \n14  energy, health, plus climate cost savings, therefore, will be a combined $29 \n15  billion per year (decreasing from $32 to $2.8 billion per year), or by 91 %. \n16  [MJ 1061:20-1063:24; MJ-15, MJ-39, MJ-40, MJ-41, MJ-42]. \n17  276.  Wind, water, and solar are the cheapest and most efficient \n18  form of energy. Cost per unit of energy in a 100% WWS system in Montana \n19  would be about 15% lower than a business-as-usual case by 2050, even when \n20  including increased costs for energy storage. New wind and solar are the lowest \n21  cost new forms of electric power in the United States, on the order of about half \n22  ~he cost of natural gas and even cheaper compared to coal. [MJ 1045 :9-104 7: 10, \n23  1062:8-1063:24; MJ-20]. \nI \n24  NIii \nI \n25  NIii \n! \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 82 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  277.  According to a 2018 Montana DEQ report, Understanding \n2  Energy in Montana, Montana has significant solar energy potential, comparable \n3  to many other U.S. cities. [MJ 1086:21-1087:4; P9; MJ-50]. \n4  278.  The new footprint over land required to implement a 100% \n5  renewable energy system in Montana would be only about 0.06% of Montana's \n6  land. Utility scale solar would occupy 0.01 % of Montana's land (fourteen square \n7  miles), while new wind turbines, including the land around those turbines, which \n8  could be used for agriculture, open space, or more solar panels, would occupy \n9  about 0.05% (seventy-one square miles) of Montana's land. In comparison, \n10  Montana's oil and gas wells and associated infrastructure already occupy about \n11  304 square miles of land (0.21 % of Montana land area). [MJ 1079:25-1082:3; \n12  MJ-46]. \n13  279.  There is an abundant supply of renewable energy and four \n14  ways to store renewable energy: heat storage (in water), cold storage (as ice), \n15  electricity storage (pumped hydropower, batteries, hydrogen fuel cells), and \n16  hydrogen as a form of storage (for use in long distance transportation and steel \n17  production). [MJ 1057:2-15, 1058:5-15, 1072:24-1073:7, 1076:9-1077:22, \n18  1079:22-1082:8; MJ-15, MJ-19, MJ-45, MJ-62]. \n19  280.  Montana's energy needs in 2050 under a 100% WWS \n20  roadmap would decline significantly (over fifty percent) as compared to a \n21  business-as-usual energy system due to a mix of gains in energy efficiency in \n22  vehicles and appliances, and through eliminating the significant amounts of \n23  energy required to extract, transport, and refine fossil fuels.

Transitioning to WWS will keep Montana's lights on while \n2  saving money, lives, and cleaning up the air and the environment, and ultimately \n3  using less of Montana's land resources. [MJ 1061 :4-1062: 12, 1066:6-17, \n4  1066:18-1067:20, 1079:22-1082:8; MJ-15, MJ-20-MJ-30, MJ-39, MJ-41, MJ-42, \n5  MJ-46, MJ-56, MJ-57, MJ-58, MJ-62]. \n6  282.  The current barriers to implementing renewable energy \n7  systems are not technical or economic, but social and political. Such barriers \n8  primarily result from government policies that slow down and inhibit the \n9  transition to renewables, and laws that allow utilization of fossil fuel \n10  development and preclude a faster transition to a clean, renewable energy system. \n11  [MJ 1042:15-1043:2, 1059:9-1061:3, 1100:9-1101:4, 1103:11-1104:24; MJ-15, \n12  MJ-19, MJ-20, MJ-33, MJ-35, MJ-36, MJ-38, MJ-62, MJ-63]. \n13  283.

Ms. Ellingson's testimony was informative and \n20  provided useful context, including on the compilation of the records of the \n21  Constitutional Convention proceedings on which Montana courts regularly rely. \n22  Ms. Ellingson was elected to the Constitutional Convention as a delegate from \n23  Missoula County. \nI \n24  Ill// \nI \n25  Ill!! \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 84 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  285.  The first \"delegate proposal\" advanced during the \n2  Constitutional Convention was for a constitutional provision on environmental \n3  quality. \n4  286.  Article IX, Section 1 of the Constitution states that \"[t]he \n5  state and each person shall maintain and improve a clean and healthful \n6  environment in Montana for present and future generations.\" This provision came \n7  about after long debate to strengthen the environmental article recommended by \n8  the Natural Resources Committee by including the words \"clean\" and \n9  \"healthful.\" \n10  287.  As reflected in the Constitutional Convention Transcripts \n11  (March 1, 1972, Vol. V 1230), Ms. Ellingson suggested the \"legislature shall \nI \n12  provide adequate remedies to prevent\" language of Article IX, Section 1 to assure \n13  1reater protections of the current environment.  She believed that if you are \nI \n14  trying to protect the environment, you need the ability to sue or seek injunctive \n' \n15  t'eliefbefore the environmental damage is done--paying someone monetary \n16  damages after the harm is done does little good. This position was complemented \n17  by including the right to a clean and healthful environment in the Declaration of \n18  Rights in Article II, Sec. 3 of the Montana Constitution. The decision to include \n19  the right to a clean and healthful environment as one of the unalienable rights \n20  included in the Bill of Rights passed by a large majority. \n21  288.  During the Constitutional Convention, there were concerns \ni \n22  ~mong the delegates over the constitutional rights for people under the age of \n23  Jighteen, and Article II, Section 15 in the Declaration of Rights was included to \n24  lnsure that Montana's youth have the same fundamental rights as adults. This \n25  Jection was adopted with broad support. \n! \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 85 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  289.  Delegates to the 1972 Constitutional Convention intended to \n2  adopt the strongest preventative and anticipatory constitutional environmental \n3  provisions possible to protect Montana's air, water, and lands for present and \n4  future generations. \n5  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n6  1.  To the extent that any of the foregoing Findings of Fact \n7  incorporate Conclusions of Law or the application of law to fact, they are \n8  incorporated herein as Conclusions of Law. \n9  2.  This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and subject \ni  .  th\" \n10  matter m  1s case. \nI \n11  3.  The Conclusions of Law are conformed to the evidence \n12  presented at trial by both parties. Mont. R. Civ. P. 15(6)(2). The Court will \n13  address the constitutionality of Mont. Code Ann.§ 75-l-201(6)(a)(ii), which was \n14  enacted by SB 557 and addressed by both parties during trial and in trial briefing. \n15  See, e.g., Docs. 390, 402. \n16  I.  PLAINTIFFS HAV  E PROVEN STANDING. \n17  A.  Plaintiffs Have Proven Injury. \n18  4.  As described in the Findings of Fact, Youth Plaintiffs have \n19  experienced past and ongoing injuries resulting from the State's failure to \n20  consider GHGs and climate change, including injuries to their physical and \n21  mental health, homes and property, recreational, spiritual, and aesthetic interests, \nI \n22  t~ibal and cultural traditions, economic security, and happiness. \n23  5.  Plaintiffs' mental health injuries directly resulting from State \n24  inaction or counterproductive action on climate change, on their own, do not \n25  Jstablish a cognizable injury. Steel Co.  v.  Citizens for a Better Envt., 523 U.S. 83, \nI \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order -page 86 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  107 (1998). However, Plaintiffs' mental health injuries stemming from the \n2  effects of climate change on Montana's environment, feelings like loss, despair, \n3  and anxiety, are cognizable injuries. \n4  6.  Every additional ton of GHG emissions exacerbates \n5  Plaintiffs' injuries and risks locking in irreversible climate injuries. \n6  7.  Plaintiffs' injuries will grow increasingly severe and \n7  irreversible without science-based actions to address climate change. \n8  8.  Plaintiffs have proven that as children and youth, they are \n9  disproportionately harmed by fossil fuel pollution and climate impacts. \n10  9.  Plaintiffs have proven that they have suffered injuries that \n11  are concrete, particularized, and distinguishable from the public generally. \n12  10.  Plaintiffs suffer and will continue to suffer injuries due to \n13  the State's statutorily mandated disregard of climate change and GHG emissions \n14  in the MEPA Limitation, and due to SB 557's removal ofMEPA's preventative \n15  equitable remedies with Mont. Code Ann.§ 75-1-201(6)(a)(ii). \n16  B.  Plaintiffs Have Proven Causation at Trial. \n17  11.  The PSC is exempted from MEPA as a matter of law. Mont. \n18  Code Ann.§ 75-1-201(3).2 \n19  12. ·  There is a fairly traceable connection between the MEPA \n20  Limitation and the State's allowance of resulting fossil fuel GHG emissions, \n21  which contribute to and exacerbate Plaintiffs' injuries. \n22  13.  There is a fairly traceable connection between the State's \nI \n23  disregard of GHG emissions and climate change, pursuant to the MEPA   \nI \n24  Limitation, GHG emissions over which the State has control, climate change \n25  impacts, and Plaintiffs' proven injuries. Unlike in Bitterrooters Inc., the causal \n! \n2 Hereinafter, when the Court refers to Defendants or the State, the PSC is excluded. \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 87 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  relationship between the permitted activities and the resulting environmental \n2  harms is reasonably close. Bitterrooters for Planning, Inc. v. Mont. Dep 't of \n3  Envtl. Quality, 2017 MT 222, ,i 25,401 P.3d 712. The State authorizes fossil fuel \n4  activities without analyzing GHGs or climate impacts, which result in GHG \n5  emissions in Montana and abroad that have caused and continue to exacerbate \n6  anthropogenic climate change. \n7  14.  The Defendants have the authority under the statutes by \n8  1\"hich they operate to protect Montana's environment and natural resources, \n' \n9  protect the health and safety of Montana's youth, and alleviate and avoid climate \n10  impacts by limiting fossil fuel activities that occur in Montana when the MEPA   \n11  analysis shows that those activities are resulting in degradation or other harms \n12  which violate the Montana Constitution. \n13  15.  Montana's contributions to GHG emissions can be measured \n14  incrementally and cumulatively both in terms of immediate local effects and by \n15  mixing in the atmosphere and contributing to global climate change and an \n16  already destabilized climate system. \n17  16.  Montana's GHG contributions are not de minimis but are \n18  nationally and globally significant. Montana's GHG emissions cause and \n19  contribute to climate change and Plaintiffs' injuries and reduce the opportunity to \n20  alleviate Plaintiffs' injuries. \n21  C.  Plaintiffs Have Proven Redressability at Trial. \n22  17.  The psychological satisfaction of prevailing in this lawsuit \nI \n23  does not establish redressability. Steel Co.  at 107. \n24  18.  Defendants can alleviate the harmful environmental effects \n25  c:ifMontana's fossil fuel activities through the lawful exercise of their authority if \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 88 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  they are allowed to consider GHG emissions and climate change during MEP A \n2  review, which would provide the clear information needed to conform their \n3  decision-making to the best science and their constitutional duties and \n4  constraints, and give them the necessary information to deny permits for fossil \n5  fuel activities when inconsistent with protecting Plaintiffs' constitutional rights. \n6  ,  19.  Montana's land contains a significant quantity of fossil fuels \n7  ~et to be extracted. The State and its agents could consider GHG emissions and \n8  6limate impacts and reject projects that would lead to unreasonable degradation \n9  of Montana's environment. \n10  20.  A reduction in Montana's GHG emissions that results from a \nI \n11  declaration that Montana's MEPA Limitation is unconstitutional would provide \nI \n12  partial redress of Plaintiffs' injuries because the amount of additional GHG \nI \n' \n13  emissions emitted into the climate system today and in the coming decade will \n14  impact the long-term severity of the heating and the severity of Plaintiffs' \n15  mJunes. \n16  21.  It is possible to affect future degradation to Montana's \n17  environment and natural resources and injuries to these Plaintiffs. \n18  22.  Permitting statutes give the State and its agents discretion to \n19  deny permits for fossil fuel activities. See, e.g., Mont. Code Ann. §§ 75-2-203 \n20  and -204 (discretion under Clean Air Act of Montana to prohibit facilities that \n21  cause air pollution); § 75-2-211(2)(a) (DEQ to provide rules governing \n22  suspension or revocation of air quality permits); § 75-2-218(2) (DEQ has \nI \n23  discretion to deny air quality permits);§ 75-2-217(1) (DEQ to provide rules \n24  1oveming suspension or revocation of operating permits); 75-20-301 (DEQ can \n25  ~nly approve permits for Major Facility Siting Act facilities after considering \nI \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 89 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  numerous discretionary factors, including environmental impacts and public \n2  health, welfare, and safety); § 77-3-301 (state lands \"may\" be leased for coal if \n3  \"in the best interests of the state\");§ 77-3-401 (state lands \"may\" be leased for \n4  oil and gas if consistent with the Constitution);§ 82-4-102(3)(a) (stating purpose \n5  of surface and underground mining and reclamation laws to vest DEQ with \n6  rulemaking authority to \"either approve or disapprove\" new strip mines or new \n7  underground mines); § 82-4-227 (DEQ has wide discretion to refuse mining \n8  permits). \n9  23.  The State must either: 1) have discretion to deny permits for \n10  fossil fuel activities when the activities would result in GHG emissions that cause \n11  unconstitutional degradation and depletion of Montana's environment and natural \n12  resources, or infringement of the constitutional rights of Montana's children and \nI \n13  ~outh; or 2) the permitting statutes themselves must be unconstitutional. \n14  24.  \"[C]ourts should avoid constitutional issues whenever \n15  possible.\" Park Cnty. Envtl. Council v. Mont. Dep 't ofE nvtl. Quality, \n16  2020 MT 303, ,r 54, 477 P.3d 288 (citing Sunburst Sch. Dist. No. 2 v.  Texaco, \n17  Inc., 2007 MT 183, ,r 62, 165 P.3d 1079). Under the doctrine of constitutional \n18  avoidance, this Court clarifies that Defendants do have discretion to deny permits \n19  for fossil fuel activities that would result in unconstitutional levels of GHG \n20  emissions, unconstitutional degradation and depletion of Montana's environment \n21  and natural resources, or infringement of the constitutional rights of Montanans \n22  and Youth Plaintiffs. \n23  Ill// \ni \n24  /!Ill \nI \n25  Ill// \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 90 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  II.  MONT. CODE ANN.§ 75-1-201(6)(a)(ii) IS NOT A BARRIER TO \n2  REDRESSABILITY BECAUSE IT IS FACIALLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL \n3  UNDER PARK COUNTY. \n4  25.  Mont. Code Ann.§ 75-l-201(6)(a)(ii) eliminates the \n5  preventative remedies available to MEPA litigants: vacatur and injunction. The \n6  State raised Mont. Code Ann.§ 75-l-201(6)(a)(ii) during trial as a barrier to \n7  redressability in this case, bringing it before the Court and making the issue \n8  1;1navoidable. \n9  26.  The Legislature is obligated under Article IX, \nI \n10  ~ec. 1(3) to provide \"adequate remedies for the protection of the environmental \n11  life support system from degradation\" and \"to prevent unreasonable depletion \n12  and degradation of natural resources.\" Mont. Const. Art. IX, Sec. 1(3). \n13  27.  \"MEPA is an essential aspect of the State's efforts to meet \n14  its constitutional obligations, as are the equitable remedies without which MEPA   \n,r \n15  is rendered meaningless.\" Park Cnty.  89. \n16  28.  In Park Cnty, a unanimous Court reasoned: \n17  Montanans'  right  to  a  clean  and  healthful  environment  is \ncomplemented by an affirmative duty upon their government to take \n18 \nactive steps to realize this right. Article IX, § 1, Subsections 1 and 2 \n19  of the  Montana  Constitution  command  that the Legislature  'shall \nprovide for the administration and enforcement' of measures to meet \n20 \nthe  State's obligation to  'maintain and  improve'  the  environment. \n21  Critically, Subsection 3 explicitly directs the Legislature to 'provide \nadequate  remedies  to  prevent  unreasonable  depletion  and \n22 \ndegradation of natural resources ... \n23 \nWithout a mechanism to prevent a project from going forward until \n24 \na MEPA violation has been addressed, MEPA's role in meeting the \n25  State's 'anticipat01y and preventative' constitutional obligations is \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 91 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  negated. Whatever interest might be served by a statute that instructs \nan agency to forecast and consider the environmental implications of \n2 \na  project  that  is  already  underway-perhaps  analogous  to  a \n3  mandatory  aircraft  inspection  after  takeoff-the  constitutional \nobligation to  prevent certain environmental  harms  from  arising  is \n4 \ncertainly not one of them. \n5 \n,r,r \nId.  63, 72. \n6 \n7  29.  Pursuant to the Court's decision in Park Cnty., Mont. Code \ni \n8  Ann.§ 75-1-201(6)(a)(ii) is facially unconstitutional because it eliminates MEPA \nI \n9  litigants' remedies that prevent irreversible degradation of the environment, and \n10  it fails to further a compelling state interest. Park Cnty. ,r,r 63, 69-72. \n11  III.  ALL PLAINTIFFS' CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS ARE \n12  PREDICATED ON DEGRADATION OF MONTANA'S CLEAN AND \n13  HEALTHFUL ENVIRONMENT. \n14  ,  30.  All of Plaintiffs' claims hinge on whether the MEPA \nI \n15  Limitation and Mont. Code Ann.§ 75-l-201(6)(a)(ii) violate Mont. Const. Art. \n16  II, Sec. 3 and Art. IX, Sec. 1. \n17  a.  The Public Trust Doctrine is already codified in the \n18  Montana Constitution in Art. IX, Sec. 3. Galt v. State, 225 Mont. 142, 144, 146, \n19  731 P.2d 912, 913, 914 (1987) (citing Mont. Coal. for Stream Access v.  Curran, \n20  210 Mont. 38, 682 P.2d 163 (1984) and Mont. Const. Art. IX, Sec. 3(3)). \n21  b.  Except for Plaintiffs' mental health injuries resulting \n22  from government inaction on climate change, the alleged equal protection, \n23  dignity, liberty, and health and safety violations all stem from harm to Montana's \nI  . \n24  environment. \nI \n25  !(Ill \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 92 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  c.  Plaintiffs' mental health injuries resulting from \n2  government inaction alone do not establish a cognizable, redressable injury. \n3  d.  It would be impossible for the Court to find that the \n4  MI  EPA Limitation and Mont. Code Ann.§ 75-l-201(6)(a)(ii) do not violate Art. \n5  I~, Sec. 3 and Art. IX, Sec. 1, and then find that the statutes violate the Public \n6  Trust Doctrine or the rights to equal protection, dignity, liberty, or health and \nI \n7  safety. \ni \n8  IV.  DETERMINING WHETHER THE CONSTITUTIONAL \nI \n9  PROVISIONS AT ISSUE ARE SELF-EXECUTING IS UNECESSARY TO \n: \n10  RESOLVE THIS CONTROVERSY. \n11  31.  It is possible to resolve this case without determining \n12  ~hether Art. II, Sec. 3 and Art. IX, Sec. 1 are self-executing. \n13  j  32.  A determination that a right is non-self-executing \"does not \n14  end the inquiry. As here, (1) once the Legislature has acted, or 'executed,' a \nI \n15  provision (2) that implicates individual constitutional rights, courts can determine \ni \n16  -,:vhether that enactment fulfills the Legislature's constitutional responsibility.\" \n'  ,r \n17  Columbia Falls Elem. Sch. Dist. No.  6 v. State, 2005 MT 69,  17, 109 P.3d 257 \nI \n18  ~citing City ofB  oerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997)). \nI \n19  33. \n20  \"Provisions  that  directly  implicate  rights  guaranteed  to \nindividuals under our Constitution are in a category of their own. \n21 \nThat is, although the provision may be non-self-executing, \n22  thus  requiring  initial  legislative  action,  the  courts,  as  final \ninterpreters  of the  Constitution,  have  the  final  'obligation  to \n23 \nguard, enforce, and protect every right granted or secured by the \n24  Constitution .... \"' \n25 \n,r \nBrown v.  Gianforte, 2021 MT 149,  23,488 P.3d 548 (citing Columbia \n,r \nFalls Elem. Sch. Dist.,  18 (quoting Robb v.  Connolly, 111 U.S. 624, 637 \n(1884))). \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 93 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  34.  Like in Park Cnty., the question presented to the Court by \n2  this case \"is straightforward: has the Legislature met its obligation to provide \n3  adequate remedies with which to prevent potential future environmental harms \n' \n4  when it removes what appears to be the only available legal relief positioned to \n5  do so?\" Park Cnty. ,i 78. The MEPA Limitation, especially in conjunction with \n6  J,ront. Code Ann.§ 75-l-201(6)(a)(ii), removes the only preventative equitable \n! \n7  r_elief available to the public and MEPA   litigants concerned about GHGs and \nI \n8  climate change, which are degrading Montana's environment. \nI \ny. \n9  THE MEPA LIMITATION IS SUBJECT TO STRICT SCRUTINY. \n10  i  35.  Any statute, policy, or rule which implicates a fundamental \n11  Jight must be strictly scrutinized and can only survive scrutiny if the State \nI \n12  establishes a compelling state interest and that the action is nanowly tailored to \n13  Jffectuate that interest. Park Cnty. ,i 84. \nI \n14  36.  The MEPA Limitation is subject to strict scrutiny because it \n15  implicates Plaintiffs' fundamental right to a clean and healthful environment. \nI \nI \n16  VI.  THE MEPA LIMITATION VIOLATES THE MONTANA \n17  CONSTITUTION. \n18  A.  MEP A Limitation violates Plaintiffs' Right to a Clean and \n19  Healthful Environment - Mont. Const. Art. II, Sec. 3, 15; Art. IX, Sec. 1. \n20  37.  Montana's Constitution provides: \"All persons are born free \n21  Jnd have certain inalienable rights. They include the right to a clean and healthful \n22  environment ....\"  Mont. Const. Art. II, Sec. 3. Consistent with the provision of \n23  these rights and responsibilities, the Montana Constitution further provides: \"The \nI \n24  I/Ill \n' \n25  (Ill/ \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 94 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  state and each person shall maintain and improve a clean and healthful \n2  environment in Montana for present and future generations.\" Mont. Const. \n3  trt. IX, Sec. 1(1). \n4  ·  38.  Article II, Sec. 3 and Article IX, Sec. 1 are to be read \n,r,r \n5  together, along with the Preamble to Montana's Constitution. MEIC I,  65, 77. \nI \n6  39.  The right to a clean and healthful environment is a \n1 \n7  fundamental right protected by Mont. Const. Art. II, Sec. 3 and Art. IX, Sec. 1(1). \nI \n,r \n8  MEIC I,  64. \n9  40.  Montana's children under age eighteen, have a fundamental \n10  right to a clean and healthful environment. Mont. Const. Art. II, Sec. 15. The \n11  )ight to a clean and healthful environment is intended to protect Montana's \ni \n12  children and future generations. \n13  41.  During Montana's 1972 Constitutional Convention, \n14  c;!elegates placed significant emphasis on protecting natural resources and \nI \n15  improving Montana's environment. The Montana Supreme Court has recognized \nI \n16  t,hat \"it was agreed by both sides of the debate that it was the convention's \nI \n17  intention to adopt whatever the convention could agree was the stronger \nI \nI \n18  language.\" MEIC I, ,r 75 (citing Convention Transcripts, Vol. IV at 1209, Mar. 1, \nI \nI \n19  1972). The Montana Supreme Court has repeatedly found that the Framers \n20  intended the state constitution contain \"the strongest environmental protection \n21  provision found in any state constitution.\" Park Cnty., ,r 61. \n22  42.  The Constitutional Framers \"did not intend to merely \n23  Jrohibit that degree of environmental degradation which can be conclusively \nI \n24  linked to ill health or physical endangerment.\" MEJC I,  ,r 77. As Delegate Foster \nI \nI \n25  noted: \"[I]fwe put in the Constitution that the only line of defense is a healthful \n! \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 95 \nCDV-2020-307 \ni \n\n1  environment and that I have to show, in fact, that my health is being damaged in \n2  order to find some relief, then we've lost the battle.\" MEIC I, ,i 74 (citing \n3  Convention Transcripts, Vol.Vat 1243-44, Mar. 1, 1972). \n4  43.  The right to a clean and healthful environment language in \n5  Montana's Constitution is \"forward-looking and preventative language\" which \n6  \"clearly indicates that Montanans have a right not only to reactive measures after \n7  a constitutionally-proscribed environmental harm has occurred, but to be free of \n8  ils occurrence in the first place.\" Park Cnty., ,i 62. \n9  [  44.  The right to a clean and healthful environment requires \n10  enhancement of Montana's environment. According to the Constitutional \n' \nI \n11  !Delegates, \"our intention was to permit no degradation from the present \n12  ~nvironment and affirmatively require enhancement of what we have now.\" \nI \n13  JorfEIC I, ,i 69 (quoting Convention Transcripts, Vol. IV at 1205, Mar. 1, 1972) \n14  (emphasis in original). \n15  45.  Montanans' right to a clean and healthful environment is \nI \n16  complemented by an affirmative duty upon their government to take active steps \n17  to realize this right. Article IX, Sec. 1(1) and (2) of the Montana Constitution \n18  command that the Legislature \"shall provide for the administration and \n19  enforcement\" of measures to meet the State's obligation to \"maintain and \n20  improve\" the environment. Critically, Subsection 3 explicitly directs the \n21  Legislature to \"provide adequate remedies to prevent unreasonable depletion and \n22  degradation of natural resources.\" Mont. Const. Art. IX, Sec. 1(3); Park Cnty., \n23  iJ 63. \n24  I/Ill \n25  /Ill/ \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 96 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  46.  The obligations of the Legislature found in Article IX, \n2  Sec. 1 include providing \"adequate remedies for the protection of the \n3  dnvironmental life support system from degradation.\" Mont. Const. Art. IX, \nI \nI \n4  Sec. 1(3). \n5  ,  47.  According to Delegate McNeil, \"the term 'environmental \nI \n6  life support system' is all-encompassing, including but not limited to air, water, \n7  and land; and whatever interpretation is afforded this phrase by the Legislature \n,r \n8  and courts, there is no question that it cannot be degraded.\" MEIC I,  67 (citing \n9  Convention Transcripts, Vol. IV at 1201, Mar. 1, 1972) (emphasis in original). \n10  48.  Montana's constitutional right to a clean and healthful \n11  Jnvironment prohibits environmental degradation that causes ill health or \nI \n12  physical endangerment and unreasonable depletion or degradation of Montana' \n13  Aatural resources for this and future generations: \nI \n14  Our conclusions in MEIC I  are consistent with the constitutional \ntext's unambiguous reliance on preventative measures to ensure that \n15 \nMontanans' inalienable right to a 'clean and healthful environment' \n16  is  as  evident in  the  air,  water,  and  soil  of Montana as  in  its  law \nbooks. Article IX, Section 1, of the Montana Constitution describes \n17 \nthe  environmental  rights  of 'future  generations,'  while  requiring \n18  'protection'  of  the  environmental  life  support  system  'from \ndegradation'  and  'prevent[ion  of]  unreasonable  depletion  and \n19 \ndegradation'  of the state's natural  resources.  This  forward-looking \n20  and preventative language clearly indicates that Montanans have a \nright not only to reactive measures after a constitutionally-proscribed \n21 \nenvironmental hann has occurred, but to be free of its occurrence in \n22 \nthe first place. \nI  ,r \n23  Park Cnty.,  62. \n24  49.  Based on the plain language of the implicated constitutional \n25  provisions, the intent of the Framers, and Montana Supreme Court precedent, \n' \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 97 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  climate is included in the \"clean and healthful environment\" and \"environmental \n2  life support system.\" Mont. Const. Art. II, Sec. 3; Art. IX, Sec. 1. \n3  50.  Montana's climate, environment, and natural resources are \n4  unconstitutionally degraded and depleted due to the current atmospheric \n5  doncentration of GHGs and climate change. \nI \n6  51.  The right to a clean and healthful environment allows \n' \n7  plaintiffs to obtain equitable relief before harm occurs. According to the Supreme \n8  Court: \n9  When considering which remedies are  'adequate' in this context, \nwe note that equitable relief,  unlike monetary damages,  can avert \n10 \nharms  that would have  otherwise arisen.  It follows  that equitable \n11  relief must  play  a  role  in  the  constitutional  directive  to  ensure \nremedies that are adequate to prevent the potential degradation that \n12 \ncould infringe upon the environmental rights of present and future \n13  generations. We are not alone in this conclusion. As Delegate Mae \nNan  Robinson  pointed  out  during  the  1972  Constitutional \n14 \nConvention: if you're really trying to protect the environment, you'd \n15  better have something whereby you can sue or seek injunctive relief \nbefore the environmental damage has been done; it does very little \n16 \ngood to pay someone monetary damages because the air has been \n17  polluted or because the stream has been polluted if you can't change \nthe condition of the environment once it has been destroyed. \n18 \n19  fark Cnty. ,r 64 (citing MEIC I,r 71). \n20  52.  \"The essential purpose ofMEPA is to aid in the agency \nI \n21  decision-making process otherwise provided by law by informing the agency and \nI \n22 \nthe interested public of environmental impacts that will likely result from agency \nI \n23  actions or decisions.\" Bitterrooters Inc. ,r 18. \n24  I  53.  \"MEPA is an essential aspect of the State's efforts to meet \n25  iIt s constitutional obligations.\" Park Cnty., ,r 89; § 75-1-102, MCA. \nI \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 98 \nCDV-2020-307 \n' \nI \n\n1  54.  The stated policy ofMEPA makes clear that the State should \n2  use \"all practicable means\" \"so that the state may: (a) fulfill the responsibilities \n3  df each generation as trustee of the environment for succeeding generations; (b) \nI \n4  ensure for all Montanans safe, healthful, productive, and aesthetically and \n5  culturally pleasing surroundings; (c) attain the widest range of beneficial uses of \n6  the environment without degradation, risk to health or safety, or other undesirable \n7  and unintended consequences ....\" § 75-1-103, MCA. \n8  55.  By enacting and enforcing the MEPA Limitation, the State \n9  is failing to meet their affirmative duty to protect Plaintiffs' right to a clean and \n10  healthful environment, and to protect Montana's natural resources from \n11  unreasonable depletion. \n' \n12  56.  The MEPA Limitation categorically limits what the \n13  agencies, officials, and agencies tasked with protecting Montana's clean and \n14  Jealthful environment can consider. The MEPA   Limitation conflicts with the \n15  very purpose ofMEPA, which is to aid the State in meeting its constitutional \n1\n16  oJbligation to prevent degradation by \"informing the agency and the interested \n17  public of environmental impacts that will likely result\" from State actions. \nI \n,r \n18  4itterrooters Inc.  18; § 75-1-102(1), MCA (\"The legislature, mindful of its \n19  constitutional obligations under Article II, section 3, and Article IX of the \nI \n20  Montana constitution, has enacted the Montana Environmental Policy Act ... \n21  [to] provide for the adequate review of state actions in order to ensure that: (a) \nI \n22  ehvironmental attributes are fully considered ....\" ). \n\\ \n23  //Ill \nI \n24  //Ill \n25  II(!! \nI \nI \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order - page 99 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  57.  The plain language of the MEPA Limitation bars agencies \n2  from considering GHG emissions and climate impacts for any project or \n3  Jroposal, even to assess whether the project complies with the Montana \n4  Constitution. \n5  58.  The MEPA Limitation is unconstitutionally contributing to \n6  the depletion and degradation of Montana's environment and natural resources \n7  and contributing to Plaintiffs' injuries. The MEPA Limitation deprives Plaintiffs \n8  dftheir constitutionally guaranteed rights under Mont. Const. Art. II, Sec. 3, and \nI \n9  Art. IX, Sec. 1. \n10  I  59.  By prohibiting consideration of climate change, GHG \nI \n11  emissions, and how additional GHG emissions will contribute to climate change \n12  dr be consistent with the Montana Constitution, the MEPA   Limitation violates \n' \n13  Plaintiffs' right to a clean and healthful environment and is facially \nI \n14  ~nconstitutional. \n15  /  B.  The MEP A Limitation Does Not Pass Strict Scrutiny. \n16  I  60.  The MEPA Limitation infringes on fundamental rights and \n17  must pass strict scrutiny. Mont.  Cannabis Indus. Ass 'n v.

The State did not put forward any evidence of a compelling \n2  governmental interest for the MEPA   Limitation. \n3  !  64.  Undisputed testimony established that Defendants could \n4  evaluate \"greenhouse gas emissions and corresponding impacts to the climate in \n5  the state or beyond the state's borders\" when evaluating fossil fuel activities. \n6  Indeed, Defendants have performed such evaluations in the past. \n7  I  65.  Undisputed testimony established that clean renewable \n8  ~nergy is technically feasible and economically beneficial in Montana. \n9  66.  Even if the State had established a compelling interest for \n10  the statute, the MEPA Limitation is not narrowly tailored to serve any interest. \nI \n11  I  67.  The MEPA Limitation neither serves a compelling state \n12  interest nor is narrowly tailored and fails strict scrutiny. \n13  ORDER \n14  I  1.  Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions \n15  of Law the Court determines and declares that: \nI \n16  i  2.  The Youth Plaintiffs have standing to bring the claims \n17  addressed herein. \n18  3.  Montana's GHG emissions have been proven to be fairly \n19  traceable to the MEPA   Limitation. \n20  4.  Montana's GHG emissions and climate change have been \n21  proven to be a substantial factor in causing climate impacts to Montana's \n22  bnvironment and harm and injury to the Youth Plaintiffs. \nI \n23  y111 \n24  y111 \nf \n25  11/ \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order-page 101 \nCDV-2020-307 \n\n1  5.  This judgment will influence the State's conduct by \n2  invalidating statutes prohibiting analysis and remedies based on GHG emissions \n3  Jnd climate impacts, alleviating Youth Plaintiffs' injuries and preventing further \n4  IIlJUry. \n5  I  6.  By prohibiting analysis of GHG emissions and \n6  corresponding impacts to the climate, as well as how additional GHG emissions \nJill \n7  contribute to climate change or be consistent with the Montana Constitution, \nI \n8  tµe MEPA   Limitation violates Youth Plaintiffs' right to a clean and healthful \n9  ~nvironment and is unconstitutional on its face. \nI \n10  7.  Plaintiffs have a fundamental constitutional right to a clean \nI \n11  Jnd healthful environment, which includes climate as part of the environmental \nI \n12  life-support system. \n' \n13  /  8.  The 2023 version of the MEPA Limitation, Mont. Code \n14  Ann.§ 75-1-201(2)(a), enacted into law by HB 971, is hereby declared \n15  Jnconstitutional and is permanently enjoined. \nI \n16  9.  Mont.

In addition to the findings, conclusions, and declarations set \n21  forth above, injunctive relief is appropriate, prohibiting Defendants from acting \nI \n22 \nin accordance with the statutes declared unconstitutional. \n23 \n11.
