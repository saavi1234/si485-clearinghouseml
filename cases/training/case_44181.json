    "summary": "<p>This putative class-action lawsuit on behalf of more than 5,800 youths was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on May 25, 2023 against the governor of California, the California Department of Social Services (\"CDSS\"), San Bernadino County, its Board of Supervisors, and the San Bernardino County Children and Family Services (\"CFS\"). The complaint alleged that CFS failed to protect those under its care. The plaintiffs, represented by A Better Childhood and private counsel, sued under 42 USC &sect; 1983, alleging violations of substantive due process rights (under the Fourteenth Amendment), and the right to family association (under the First and Ninth Amendments). They also brought claims under the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and California law. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys' fees. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong was assigned to the case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In December 2022, the San Bernardino Civil Grand Jury tasked with investigating CFS determined that the San Bernardino child welfare system is &ldquo;too broken to fix&rdquo; and should be &ldquo;abolished.&rdquo; According to the complaint, CFS has failed to meet its affirmative duties under United States and California Constitutions and federal and state laws to provide foster children with necessary services to ensure their wellbeing. The putative class included all children for whom CFS has or will have legal responsibility and who are or will be in CFS&rsquo;s legal and physical custody; it also included a subclass of all children who are or will be in CFS&rsquo;s custody and have physical, cognitive, and/or psychiatric disabilities.</p>\r\n<p>The complaint alleged that CFS did not adequately vet foster homes, monitor child placements with comprehensive home visits, provide timely health or dental assessments, or place foster children in permanent placements. CFS also had limited short-term emergency placements, leaving children in care to sleep on office floors &mdash; which lacked appropriate beds, bathrooms and kitchens &mdash; for days before finding appropriate placements. In addition, the plaintiffs alleged that CFS allowed caseworkers to oversee an inordinate number of caseloads and did not provide effective services to children with disabilities. Due to these deficiencies, the complaint alleged that CFS was leaving children at risk of substantial harm.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 9, 2023, various defendants filed motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and/or failure to state a claim. On September 30, 2024, the Court largely denied the motions, though it dismissed some claims against individual defendants, including all claims against the Governor of California and against some individual officials (for failure to state a claim), &sect; 1983 claims against redundant County defendants, and &sect; 1983 claims against CDSS (based on sovereign immunity). 2024 WL 4354697.</p>\r\n<p>Subsequently, San Bernardino County asked the court to allow an immediate interlocutory appeal on the denial of its motion to dismiss.

The complaint alleged that CFS failed to protect those under its care. The plaintiffs sued under 42 USC § 1983, alleging violations of substantive due process rights (under the Fourteenth Amendment), and the right to family association (under the First and Ninth Amendments). They also brought claims under the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and California law. The court largely denied the defendants' motions to dismiss on September 30, 2024. As of March 2025, the case is ongoing.",

For more than a decade, Defendants have been in the spotlight for \n3  operating a foster care system in San Bernardino County (“County”) that fails to \n4  protect the foster children whose lives and wellbeing depend on it. \n5  2.  Foster  children  are  being  abused  under  the  supervision  of  San \n6  Bernardino’s Child and Family Services (“CFS”), which runs the County’s foster \n7  care system. In December 2022, the San Bernardino Civil Grand Jury (“Grand Jury”) \n8  investigating CFS concluded that the San Bernardino child welfare system is so \n9  “complicated, secretive, and inefficient” that it is “too broken to fix” and should be \n10  “abolished.” \n11  3.  The United States and California Constitutions and federal and state \n12  statutes impose affirmative duties on CFS and those charged with overseeing it that \n13  Defendants  have  systematically  failed  to  meet  in  operating  and  overseeing  the \n14  County’s foster care system. \n15  4.  Specifically, Defendants must protect foster children in CFS’s custody \n16  from harm and provide them with services necessary to ensure their wellbeing in the \n17  least restrictive environment.  \n18  5.  This requires Defendants to provide foster children with appropriate \n19  placements that conform to nationally recommended professional standards and \n20  adequately monitor and support foster children after placement.  \n21  6.  Defendants must also timely develop, regularly update, and effectively \n22  implement a written case plan for each foster child in CFS’s custody and identify an \n23  appropriate  permanent  home  for  foster  children  within  a  reasonable  period, \n24  including  by  petitioning  for  termination  of  parental  rights  within  a  statutorily-\n25  mandated timeframe. \n26  7.  State and federal laws also require that Defendants provide effective \n27  services  to  foster  children  with  disabilities  to  ensure  they  are  afforded  equal \n28 \n \n-6-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 7 of 68   Page ID #:7\n \n1  opportunity and have access to the least restrictive and integrated setting appropriate \n2  to their needs. \n3  8.  Despite these clear constitutional and statutory mandates, Defendants \n4  have systematically failed to protect foster children in CFS’s custody from harm or \n5  provide them with services necessary under the law to ensure their wellbeing in the \n6  least restrictive environment.  \n7  9.  On Defendants’ watch, Plaintiffs—foster children in the custody of \n8  CFS—as  well  as  thousands  of  other  children  in  the  County  have  been  put  in \n9  inadequate and often dangerous placements, left without necessary services, and \n10  forced to languish unnecessarily in foster care for years.  \n11  10.  CFS has operated and continues to operate without regard to reasonable \n12  professional standards and has exhibited deliberate indifference to the ongoing harm \n13  it inflicts on foster children. \n14  11.  The named Plaintiffs—Gary G., Xander B., Francesca B., Delilah B., \n15  Teddy H., Kevin E., Sam E., Henry P., David O., Greg R., and Arnold O.—are all \n16  children in CFS’s custody who have suffered harm at the hands of CFS. They bring \n17  this lawsuit on behalf of all children who are now, or will be, in the custody of CFS. \n18  12.  Plaintiffs’  injuries  were  caused,  and  are  being  caused,  by  CFS’s \n19  numerous policies and practices that violate the rights of foster children protected \n20  by state and federal statutes and safeguarded by the United States and California \n21  Constitutions. \n22  13.  For example, CFS does not adequately vet foster homes before placing \n23  children, such as Plaintiffs, in them. In fact, CFS even lacks proper procedures and \n24  practices to screen out known abusers from serving as foster parents. \n25  14.  Once  CFS  places  foster  children  in  foster  homes,  it  also  fails  to \n26  adequately monitor the foster children to ensure their safety. Caseworkers fail to \n27  make enough home visits to determine whether foster children are safe in their \n28 \n \n-7-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 8 of 68   Page ID #:8\n \n1  placements, as they must under federal and state laws. Moreover, the home visits \n2  that do occur are often perfunctory and do not include separate interviews with the \n3  children in line with professional standards. \n4  15.  CFS also does not provide adequate case planning for Plaintiffs or the \n5  other foster children in its custody. CFS does not conduct timely Child and Family \n6  Team (“CFT”) meetings or provide children, foster parents, and family members \n7  with individualized case plans, as expressly required under federal and state laws. \n8  16.  CFS also lacks adequate short-term emergency placements for foster \n9  children who need them. When children like Plaintiffs enter CFS’s custody, they are \n10  often  forced  to  sleep  on  floors  in  CFS’s  office  for  days  on  end  while  their \n11  caseworkers scramble to find appropriate placements. CFS often ends up placing \n12  foster children with families who do not speak the same language. \n13  17.  Defendants further permit CFS’s caseworkers to carry caseloads that \n14  are too high to possibly meet the standards they must satisfy under the law. In fact, \n15  CFS’s caseworkers often carry caseloads five or six times higher than national \n16  professional standards recommend. Caseworkers with such high caseloads cannot \n17  adequately document and implement each foster child’s case plan as mandated by \n18  federal and state laws.  \n19  18.  CFS also does not provide Plaintiffs or other foster children in its \n20  custody with timely health or dental assessments. When CFS moves foster children \n21  between placements, the new foster parents often do not receive their new foster \n22  child’s health files or documentation regarding their medical and psychological \n23  needs. As a result, foster children fall behind on necessary services and treatments, \n24  sometimes left without required medication or essential therapy necessary to address \n25  their traumas and needs. \n26  19.  CFS’s systemic deficiencies expose Plaintiffs, and all foster children in \n27  the County, to a severe risk of maltreatment and future harm. \n28 \n \n-8-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 9 of 68   Page ID #:9\n \n1  20.  CFS’s policies and practices disproportionately harm foster children \n2  with  disabilities,  who  are  entitled  to  reasonable  accommodations  under  the \n3  Americans with Disabilities Act and related federal and state statutes. \n4  21.  Fully aware of CFS’s systematic failings, the California Department of \n5  Social Services (“CDSS”) and the other Defendants named in this Complaint have \n6  stood by and failed to exercise appropriate oversight, despite their legal obligation \n7  to do so. \n8  22.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief against Defendants to \n9  end  the  ongoing  harm  and  severe  risk  of  future  harm  to  which  Plaintiffs  and \n10  thousands of other children in San Bernardino County are subjected on a daily basis. \n11  This lawsuit aims to reform CFS and provide the County’s vulnerable foster children \n12  with the protection, oversight, and services they are entitled to under federal and \n13  state laws. \n14  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n15  23.  This action arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States, \n16  including 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The Court has jurisdiction over the federal claims under \n17  28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a). The Court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction \n18  over the claims based on California law under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). \n19  24.  This Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory and injunctive relief \n20  under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil \n21  Procedure. \n22  25.  Venue  in  this  district  is  proper  under  28  U.S.C.  §  1391(b).  The \n23  divisional venue is appropriate in the Riverside Division because a substantial part \n24  of the acts, events, or omissions giving rise to the claims outlined in the Complaint \n25  occurred in the Eastern Division. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n-9-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 10 of 68   Page ID #:10\n \n1  PARTIES \n2  I.

THE UNITED STATES AND CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTIONS \n23  IMPOSE ADDITIONAL AFFIRMATIVE DUTIES ON \n24  DEFENDANTS \n25  52.  The  Fourteenth  Amendment  of  the  United  States  Constitution \n26  guarantees to each child in state custody substantive due process rights and requires \n27  state and local child welfare officials to: \n28 \n \n-17-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 18 of 68   Page ID #:18\n \n1  a)  ensure that each child placed in foster care is free from the \n2  foreseeable risk of physical, mental, and emotional harm; \n3  b)  ensure that each child placed in foster care receives the services \n4  necessary  to  ensure  their  physical,  mental,  intellectual,  and \n5  emotional wellbeing in the least restrictive environment; \n6  c)  provide  each  child  placed  in  foster  care  with  conditions, \n7  treatment, and care consistent with the purpose and assumption \n8  of custody; \n9  d)  ensure that each child placed in foster care is not maintained in \n10  custody longer than is necessary to accomplish the purpose of \n11  custody; and \n12  e)  provide each child placed in foster care with reasonable efforts \n13  to obtain an appropriate permanent home and family within a \n14  reasonable period. \n15  53.  The First Amendment’s right of association and right to a permanent \n16  family, along with the Ninth Amendment’s reservation of rights to the people, and \n17  the Fourteenth Amendment’s right to due process require state and local child \n18  welfare officials to: \n19  a)  provide  reasonable  efforts  to  obtain  a  permanent  home  and \n20  family. \n21  54.  Article I, Section 7(a) of the California Constitution guarantees that: \n22  a)  a “person may not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without \n23  due process of law.” The protections of substantive due process \n24  under California law have at least the same scope and purposes \n25  as those under the United States Constitution. \n26   \n27 \n28 \n \n-18-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 19 of 68   Page ID #:19\n \n1  FACTS \n2  I.  CFS ENGAGES IN NUMEROUS POLICIES AND/OR PRACTICES \n3  THAT VIOLATE THE RIGHTS OF FOSTER CHILDREN IN SAN \n4  BERNARDINO COUNTY AND EXPOSE THEM TO A SEVERE \n5  RISK OF FUTURE HARM \n6  A.  CFS Has Spent the Last Decade Embroiled in Controversy \n7  55.  The San Bernardino Grand Jury “is an independent civil watchdog \n8  agency that investigates County agencies, towns and cities, and special districts \n9  within San Bernardino County,” in line with California Penal Code, section 925. \n10  56.  For most of the past decade, the Grand Jury has investigated CFS, and \n11  each year it has done so “it has discovered problems and issues.” For example, the \n12  Grand Jury concluded in 2016 that CFS caseworkers have “heavy caseloads” and \n13  “tremendous turnover.” \n14  57.  In 2017, the Grand Jury noted that caseloads remained “excessively \n15  high, especially in the High Desert.” In 2019, the Grand Jury further reiterated that \n16  “[e]xtremely heavy caseloads are especially a problem because of under-staffing and \n17  an increase in growth of the San Bernardino County’s population.” The 2016 and \n18  2019 reports also noted high caseworker turnover. \n19  58.  During that period, CFS was made further aware of these problems \n20  through litigation and investigative reporting. In fact, Fox News aired a multi-part \n21  exposé on CFS titled “The Children are Dying” in 2015. \n22  59.  In 2022, the Grand Jury found that the average caseworker caseload is \n23  around 70 to 90 cases per worker, that “substantiated foster children abuse cases \n24  have  increased  every  year  from  2019  through  2021,” and  that  the  number  “of \n25  substantiated sexual abuse and physical abuse cases is eye-opening.” \n26  60.  The Grand Jury concluded that CFS is so “complicated, secretive, and \n27  inefficient” that it is “too broken to fix” and should be “abolished.” \n28 \n \n-19-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 20 of 68   Page ID #:20\n \n1  61.  The Grand Jury’s reports are only the latest in a series of investigations \n2  into Defendants’ long-standing failure to operate a foster care system that protects \n3  the foster children whose lives and wellbeing depend on it. The California Attorney \n4  General has investigated “potential systemic breakdowns.” Investigative journalists \n5  have also revealed that foster children have been abused under CFS’s supervision. \n6  Former caseworkers have even reported that CFS has placed foster children with \n7  known sexual predators.  \n8  B.  CFS  Fails  to  Adequately  Vet  Foster  Homes  or  Monitor  Foster \n9  Children Once Placed \n10  62.  When  CFS  assumes  legal  custody  of  children,  CFS  is  required  to \n11  monitor them to properly ensure their safety and wellbeing. \n12  63.  Part of this responsibility involves properly vetting foster parents, foster \n13  homes, and their inhabitants before entrusting foster children to their care. However, \n14  the Grand Jury has found that “CFS has no comprehensive and complete background \n15  check/vetting  system  for”  foster  parents  and  foster  homes.  As  a  result, \n16  “[b]ackground  checks  of  [foster  homes]  often  miss  unknown  or  undisclosed \n17  boyfriends or relatives who visit the home.” In extreme cases, CFS has even placed \n18  children  with  known,  registered  sex  offenders.  The  Grand  Jury  found  these \n19  procedures “subject foster children to abusive settings.” \n20  64.  Another  part  of  this  responsibility  requires  CFS’s  caseworkers  to \n21  regularly—and thoroughly—visit foster homes to ensure the foster children living \n22  there are safe.  In fact, caseworkers must visit foster children face-to-face at least \n23  once per month, and more than half of these visits should occur at the foster home. \n24  And, during these visits, foster children must receive personalized attention from \n25  their caseworker. If this does not happen, foster parents can “hide abuse problems,” \n26  leading to “substantiated sexual and physical abuses to foster children.” \n27 \n28 \n \n-20-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 21 of 68   Page ID #:21\n \n1  65.  Despite these risks, the Grand Jury has found that caseworkers “do not \n2  visit  all  children  monthly  .  .  .  and  there  are  insufficient  and  inadequate  home \n3  inspections during visits.” Indeed, caseworkers often conduct “fly-by” visits without \n4  “interview[ing] the child or look[ing] into rooms or closets.” The Grand Jury found \n5  “that these brief interviews [] led to substantiated abuse cases.” \n6  66.  CFS’s lack of adequate vetting procedures for foster homes and failure \n7  to ensure caseworkers conduct appropriate visits to children in their placements \n8  leave foster children at substantial risk of experiencing harm and maltreatment in \n9  care. \n10  C.  CFS Does Not Provide Adequate Case Planning \n11  67.  Federal law requires CFS to provide foster children with a detailed, \n12  individualized case plan. These plans are necessary to effectively engage family \n13  members and tailor services to adequately address their needs and the needs of their \n14  children. CFS must also periodically review these case plans—at least once every \n15  six months—until a child’s case is resolved and the child has been discharged from \n16  custody.  \n17  68.  Federal and state law require that “[a] written case plan [] be completed \n18  within a maximum of 60 days of the initial removal of the child.” The case plan must \n19  include,  among  other  things,  “[b]ehaviorally  specific  goals  and  objectives  and \n20  services that will help the parents achieve a safe home for the child,” a “[s]chedule \n21  of  the  social  worker  (SW)  contacts  with  the  child,  family,  and  caregivers,” \n22  “[p]ermanency plans,” and “[a]ssurances of educational stability while the child is \n23  in out-of-home care.” \n24  69.  State law further requires that foster children over 12 years old “be \n25  given the opportunity to participate in the development of his/her case plan, review, \n26  sign and receive a copy of the case plan.” \n27 \n28 \n \n-21-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 22 of 68   Page ID #:22\n \n1  70.  CFS’s own internal policy handbook adds that the caseworker “should \n2  involve  the  parent(s),  child  and/or  additional  family  and  community  resource \n3  persons in the development of the case plan.” This policy emphasizes a shift “from \n4  the [caseworker] dictating the case plan to the parents and/or children to a more \n5  collaborative effort where the [caseworker] encourages their participation in the \n6  development of the case plan.” \n7  71.  CFT meetings represent one tool for caseworkers to collaborate with \n8  parents and children in case planning. CFT meetings should include foster children, \n9  their  family  members,  professionals,  natural  community  supports,  and  other \n10  individuals invested in the child’s success. \n11  72.  These meetings must occur within 60 days of a child’s entry into foster \n12  care, at least once every six months thereafter for children not receiving specialized \n13  mental health services, and at least once every 90 days for children receiving such \n14  specialized care. \n15  73.  All available evidence indicates that, despite statutory requirements, \n16  CFS’s caseworkers do not complete case plans on time or with all the required \n17  information,  and  CFT  meetings  do  not  occur  on  time  with  all  the  necessary \n18  stakeholders. \n19  74.  In a 2017 County Self-Assessment, CFS observed that families’ “voices \n20  are not being heard.” In essence, case plans are “cookie cutter,” “not update[d] . . . \n21  [to reflect the child’s] progress and new needs,” and “not tailored to the family and \n22  child’s needs.” At the same time, CFS reflected on a “[n]eed for more CFTs—\n23  routinely.” Above all, CFS noted that caseworkers’ lack of engagement stemmed \n24  from high caseloads, which inhibited caseworkers’ “ability to engage in ongoing \n25  assessment[s].” \n26  75.  Many foster parents, family members, and foster children have never \n27  seen the foster child’s case plan. \n28 \n \n-22-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 23 of 68   Page ID #:23\n \n1  76.  What  is  more,  CFS  caseworkers  are  not  conducting  timely  CFT \n2  meetings. And, when they do, caseworkers do not show or discuss the foster child’s \n3  case plan with the attendees. \n4  77.  Finally,  CFS  has  observed  several  other  issues  interfering  with its \n5  caseworkers’ ability to connect with foster children and their biological and foster \n6  families. First, CFS’s caseworkers often “do not speak the same language as the \n7  family.” Second, CFS noticed its caseworkers “were quick to label parent[s] as \n8  ‘resistant.’”  And  third,  CFS  found  that  its  caseworkers  were  “missing  cultural \n9  humility and trauma-informed components to providing services.” \n10  78.  CFS’s lack of timely, appropriate case planning, by itself, places foster \n11  children at risk of serious and ongoing harm. This serious risk is aggravated by the \n12  fact that CFS does not regularly include all required stakeholders, such as relatives, \n13  foster parents, and family friends in the case planning process. At bottom, these \n14  issues prevent CFS from evaluating foster children’s service needs and effectively \n15  planning for permanency as the law requires. \n16  D.  CFS Lacks Short-Term Emergency Placements \n17  79.  Federal law and widely accepted professional standards require CFS to \n18  place each foster child in the most appropriate and least restrictive placement that \n19  best  suits  the  child’s  needs.  See  42  U.S.C.  §  622(b)(8)(A)(iii);  42  U.S.C.  § \n20  675(5)(A). Extensive child welfare literature also emphasizes the need to choose \n21  each child’s placement based on all information available about the child and the \n22  need to consider all available information carefully. \n23  80.  This means that CFS must have an adequate array of placements to \n24  properly  accommodate  foster  children  with  varying  levels  of  needs.  And,  by \n25  extension, CFS must properly assess each foster child’s needs before placing them \n26  with a foster family or facility, matching them with particular homes and facilities \n27  based on fit rather than availability. \n28 \n \n-23-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 24 of 68   Page ID #:24\n \n1  81.  Despite these requirements, CFS lacks adequate short-term emergency \n2  placements for children, so when children first enter care, CFS often has no other \n3  placement for them than a local CFS office. The Grand Jury found that foster \n4  children remain in these offices for “days or weeks at a time.” \n5  82.  CFS recently acknowledged that “[a] certain number of children and \n6  youth, particularly those with complex needs and significant behavioral/emotional \n7  problems, spend nights in [CFS] offices.” \n8  83.  These  offices  lack  essentials  such  as  proper  beds,  bathrooms,  and \n9  kitchens. Consequently, children “sleep on the floor, cots, and other locations” and \n10  eat from “fast food restaurants” that lack nutritional value. What is more, children \n11  with special needs often cannot receive any of their medication or other necessary \n12  services. \n13  84.  These offices also lack basic safety features. There are issues with theft \n14  and assault. And, presumably due to inadequate supervision, foster children often \n15  rifle through caseworkers’ desks to see other children’s confidential materials. \n16  85.  CFS’s placement of foster children in its offices because of a lack of \n17  short-term  emergency  placements  puts  these  children  at  substantial  risk  of \n18  experiencing maltreatment in care. As the Grand Jury concluded, these offices are \n19  “unsafe, unsanitary, and unacceptable.” \n20  E.  CFS Does Not Provide Necessary Health Assessments or Health \n21  Services to Children \n22  86.  Federal and state laws require CFS to provide foster children, along \n23  with their families, adequate services so they can be successfully reunified with their \n24  families or placed in another permanent family. Failure to provide necessary services \n25  to foster children often leads to escalating behavioral problems, failed placements, \n26  and permanent harm to foster children. \n27 \n28 \n \n-24-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 25 of 68   Page ID #:25\n \n1  87.  To provide adequate services to foster children, federal and state laws \n2  require CFS to provide adequate and timely medical, dental, and psychological \n3  assessments to diagnose what services they need. However, CFS is persistently \n4  failing  to  provide  these  assessments.  In  December  2022,  only  48.8%  of  foster \n5  children received timely medical examinations, and only 50.4% received timely \n6  dental examinations. \n7  88.  The  Grand  Jury  also  found  foster  children  are  not,  as  required, \n8  “medically and behaviorally examined before every placement in a [new foster \n9  home].” Instead, foster children “are only medically and behaviorally assessed when \n10  the [caseworker] determines that [it] is necessary.” \n11  89.  And, for foster children placed in FFAs, CFS does not share critical \n12  medical information, including Medi-Cal cards, “in a timely manner.” As a result, \n13  the FFA foster homes often cannot schedule initial medical visits within the first 30 \n14  days of placement, as required by law. \n15  90.  What  is  more,  the  Grand  Jury  also  concluded  that  CFS  provides \n16  “[i]nadequate medical and mental health services,” such that “the current level of \n17  mental health services for foster children is severely lacking.” \n18  91.  CFS lacks “evaluation tools, assessment guidelines, therapy services \n19  and experienced mental health professionals,” particularly those who “specialize in \n20  helping  traumatized  foster  children.”  Additionally,  “CFS  lacks  sufficient \n21  community-based mental health resources.” \n22  92.  CFS is aware these issues result from its other failed policies and \n23  practices.  Indeed,  CFS  has  acknowledged  that  “[c]aseload  size  impact[ed] \n24  [caseworkers’] ability to engage in on-going assessment[s] of child/parents’ progress \n25  in services.” \n26  93.  The lack of timely and adequate assessments and services results from \n27  CFS’s long-standing actions and inactions. Indeed, CFS knows that some of its \n28 \n \n-25-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 26 of 68   Page ID #:26\n \n1  policies and practices, such as allowing high caseworker caseloads, expose foster \n2  children to a substantial risk of future harm. \n3  F.  CFS Fails to Protect Foster Children From Maltreatment in Care \n4  94.  Foster care is supposed to protect children who have already suffered \n5  trauma at home from further harm. However foster children in San Bernardino \n6  County experience high rates of maltreatment in care. \n7  95.  Indeed, the Grand Jury found that “substantiated foster children abuse \n8  cases have increased every year from 2019 through 2021,” including “significant \n9  amounts of substantiated sexual abuse and physical abuse.” And available data \n10  shows that in 2022, CFS’s foster children experienced maltreatment at a rate of 12.40 \n11  victimizations per 100,000 days in care, which is far higher than California (7.42, \n12  2022) and national (9.07, 2020) averages. \n13  96.  Unsurprisingly, San Bernardino County recently ranked second-worst \n14  out of 58 counties in California. And if San Bernardino County were a state, it would \n15  rank 12th worst in the United States, based on 2019 data. \n16  97.  Despite these alarming figures, the Grand Jury found that CFS has “no \n17  proactive measures to keep foster children from entering abusive” homes and has \n18  engaged  in  “very  little  proactive  efficient  monitoring  of  these  homes  once  the \n19  placement has been made.” \n20  98.  The high rate of maltreatment of foster children in CFS’s custody is a \n21  direct result of CFS’s deficient policies and practices, particularly CFS’s inadequate \n22  vetting and monitoring of foster homes and foster parents. As the data show, these \n23  policies and practices expose foster children to a substantial risk of future harm. \n24  G.  CFS Fails to Place Foster Children Into Permanent Placements \n25  99.  Foster care is intended to be temporary. Research has shown that the \n26  longer a child remains in foster care, the less likely it is they will be reunified or \n27  adopted. In turn, the longer a child waits for a permanent placement, the less likely \n28 \n \n-26-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 27 of 68   Page ID #:27\n \n1  they  are  to  complete  their  education  or  form  healthy  relationships.  Prompt \n2  permanency planning, thus, ensures that children leave foster care as quickly as \n3  possible and are placed in stable, permanent homes. \n4  100.  Federal law, in turn, requires CFS to expeditiously place foster children \n5  in permanent homes. Indeed, when children have been in foster care for 15 of the \n6  last 22 months, CFS is required by law to petition to terminate the parental rights of \n7  the child’s parents so that the child can be adopted, unless the child’s case plan \n8  documents compelling reasons why termination would not be in the child’s best \n9  interests or the child’s case qualifies for a statutory exemption. \n10  101.  Available data, however, shows that foster children in CFS’s custody \n11  languish in foster care for much longer than federal law permits. Children in the \n12  County spend an average of 551 days in custody, 104 days longer than the national \n13  average. \n14  102.  CFS has itself admitted that “[p]ermanency is not being addressed” and \n15  “performance has gotten worse since 2012.” Whereas 35.4% of the children entering \n16  foster care in 2012 achieved permanency within 12 months, only 29.1% of children \n17  entering foster care in 2016 achieved permanency within that timeframe. \n18  103.  These figures have continued to deteriorate. By 2019, only 23.9% of \n19  children entering care achieved permanency within 12 months, compared to around \n20  38.3% for foster children nationally. \n21  104.  Moreover, children in CFS’s custody are about 50% more likely to “age \n22  out” of foster care, without ever receiving a permanent home, than other foster \n23  children around the country (14.9% compared to 9% nationally, based on 2021 data). \n24  105.  CFS has recognized that “[a] crucial step in reunifying children within \n25  12 months of foster care entry is early engagement of parents,” which CFS is failing \n26  to adequately do. In other words, CFS’s policies and practices, particularly its lack \n27  of  adequate  case  planning  and  failure  to  conduct  timely  and  appropriate  CFT \n28 \n \n-27-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 28 of 68   Page ID #:28\n \n1  meetings, are directly contributing to its failure to attain permanency for the foster \n2  children in its custody. \n3  106.  The  lack  of  permanency  outcomes  for  foster  children,  which  arise \n4  because of CFS’s deficient policies and practices, expose foster children in the \n5  County to a substantial risk of future harm. \n6  H.  CFS  Permits  Its  Caseworkers  to  Carry  Dangerously  High \n7  Caseloads \n8  107.  CFS  has  a  constitutional  duty  to  adequately  supervise  the  foster \n9  children in its custody to ensure they are safe and receive necessary services. To do \n10  this, CFS must recruit and retain enough caseworkers to maintain caseloads that \n11  enable caseworkers to do their job. \n12  108.   The Child Welfare League of America (“CWLA”), a national coalition \n13  of  agencies  that  develops  child  welfare  policies,  recommends  that  caseworkers \n14  maintain caseloads of between 12 and 15 children in out-of-home care. Similarly, \n15  the  Council  on  Accreditation  (“COA”),  a  national  professional  licensing \n16  organization, also recommends that caseworkers maintain caseloads between 12 and \n17  15 children. \n18  109.  In the County, however, CFS permits its caseworkers to carry caseloads \n19  that far exceed these recommended standards. In 2022, the Grand Jury found that \n20  CFS allows average caseloads of around 70 to 90 children per caseworker.  \n21  110.  CFS did not refute or deny those figures in its response to the Grand \n22  Jury. In 2019, CFS acknowledged that its caseworkers had an average caseload of \n23  42 foster children. Caseloads are likely even higher in remote regions, such as the \n24  High Desert. \n25  111.  These  average  caseload  figures  include  recently  hired  caseworkers \n26  who, under recognized professional standards, should carry only lighter caseloads. \n27  In fact, it takes up to two years to train a new caseworker, during which experienced \n28 \n \n-28-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 29 of 68   Page ID #:29\n \n1  caseworkers often must shoulder higher caseloads. As the Grand Jury explained, \n2  field offices with many newly hired caseworkers are often forced to transfer cases \n3  to neighboring offices with more experienced workers, and consequently, more \n4  experienced caseworkers must maintain caseloads far higher than average. \n5  112.  Making matters worse, caseworkers spend an average of five working \n6  days per month on purely administrative tasks, leaving only 15 working days to \n7  actively supervise, plan for, and ensure services for the foster children in their care. \n8  113.  A major reason for these high caseloads is that CFS is experiencing “a \n9  high  turnover  rate  among  [caseworkers]”  while  struggling  to  recruit  new \n10  caseworkers,  who  are  deterred  by  “long  commutes,  poor  training,  and  poor \n11  supervision.” As a result, several of CFS’s field offices are “sparsely populated in \n12  terms of personnel” and do “not have enough workers to keep up with workload \n13  demands.”  In  fact,  CFS  has  “[i]nsufficient  staffing  levels  to  provide  quality \n14  services.” \n15  114.  Ultimately,  the  Grand  Jury  concluded  that  it  is  “impossible”  for \n16  caseworkers to monitor so many children properly, finding that CFS’s “mission . . . \n17  has been unsuccessful . . . primarily due to personnel issues and large caseloads.”  \n18  115.  High caseloads prevent CFS’s caseworkers from adequately assessing \n19  a  child’s  safety  or  wellbeing,  developing  individualized  case  plans,  facilitating \n20  reunification services, placing children in appropriate placements, or deciding when \n21  to petition to terminate parental rights, all of which are required under state and \n22  federal laws. Manageable caseloads can exist only when an agency develops and \n23  maintains  an  adequately-funded  and  well-planned  child  welfare  system  that \n24  aggressively recruits, trains, and retains caseworkers. \n25  116.  Defendants, by contrast, have consistently failed to develop such a \n26  system, contributing to child maltreatment in care, lack of adequate services, and \n27 \n28 \n \n-29-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 30 of 68   Page ID #:30\n \n1  inadequate permanency planning, thereby exposing foster children in the County to \n2  a substantial risk of future harm. \n3  I.  CFS  Fails  to  Provide  Effective  Services  to  Children  with \n4  Disabilities \n5  117.  CFS’s  illegal  policies  and  practices  disproportionately  harm  foster \n6  children with disabilities. In particular, CFS’s lack of adequate case planning and its \n7  untimely and inadequate provision of services prevent children with disabilities from \n8  receiving the specialized care they need to succeed in foster care. \n9  118.   For instance, CFS’s failure to conduct timely health assessments—\n10  especially those related to mental health—delays the prompt identification of a \n11  child’s disability. Making matters worse, CFS does not ensure foster children are \n12  medically and behaviorally assessed before it places them in new foster homes. \n13  119.  Meanwhile,  CFS’s  failure  to  provide  necessary  services,  including \n14  “therapy services and experienced mental health professionals,” prevents disabled \n15  children from receiving adequate treatment. Delays in passing along Medi-Cal cards \n16  between  placements  further  prevent  disabled  children  from  receiving  timely \n17  services, even if such services would otherwise be available. \n18  120.  CFS’s failure to provide health assessments and services is made even \n19  worse  by  its  inadequate  case  planning  practices,  including  its  deficient  CFT \n20  meetings, which do not adequately track disabled children’s needs and progress. \n21  Indeed, foster parents sometimes receive foster children who have disabilities and \n22  need specialized care without having ever seen the child’s case plan or medical files. \n23  121.  CFS’s lack of assessments, services, and case planning is compounded \n24  by its other systemic deficiencies—high caseworker caseloads, a lack of short-term \n25  emergency  placements,  inadequate  vetting  of  foster  homes,  and  monitoring  of \n26  children later placed in those foster homes all disproportionately expose foster \n27  children with disabilities to severe risk of future harm. \n28 \n \n-30-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 31 of 68   Page ID #:31\n \n1  122.  These  failings  are  particularly  alarming  considering  the  general \n2  recognition by public health authorities, such as the Centers for Disease Control and \n3  Prevention, that providing timely interventions to children with disabilities “can \n4  change a child’s developmental path and improve outcomes for children, families, \n5  and communities.” \n6  123.  By failing to safely plan with the parents, foster parents, and/or loved \n7  ones of foster children with disabilities, or to make reasonable modifications to their \n8  case planning procedures and practices, CFS unnecessarily prevents children with \n9  disabilities  from  experiencing  foster  care  in  a  way  that  federal  and  state  law \n10  requires—in the least-restrictive, most family-like setting, with adequate services. \n11  II.  THE REMAINING DEFENDANTS HAVE VIOLATED THE RIGHTS \n12  OF FOSTER CHILDREN IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY AND \n13  EXPOSED THEM TO A SEVERE RISK OF FUTURE HARM BY \n14  FAILING TO EXERCISE ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT OVER CFS \n15  A.  The  County  Defendants  Have  Failed  to  Exercise  Adequate \n16  Oversight \n17  124.  Defendant  San  Bernardino  County  is  specifically  tasked  with \n18  overseeing and monitoring CFS. \n19  125.  Defendant Members of the Board of Supervisors are responsible for \n20  overseeing  the  County’s  policies,  practices,  and  operations,  appointing  and \n21  supervising the director of CFS, and ensuring that the County complies with all \n22  applicable federal and state laws. \n23  126.  Defendant Jeany Zepeda is the Director of CFS and oversees CFS’s \n24  policies, practices, and operations. She is responsible for ensuring that CFS complies \n25  with  all  applicable  federal  and  state  laws.  Defendants  San  Bernardino  County, \n26  Members of the Board of Supervisors, and Jeany Zepeda, together with CFS, are \n27  referred to as the “County Defendants.” \n28 \n \n-31-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 32 of 68   Page ID #:32\n \n1  127.  The County Defendants have failed to exercise adequate oversight and \n2  ensure that CFS’s practices and procedures comply with federal and state laws, \n3  exposing foster children in San Bernardino County to a severe risk of future harm. \n4  B.  The State Defendants Have Failed to Exercise Adequate Oversight \n5  128.  Defendant CDSS is specifically tasked with overseeing all county-run \n6  child welfare agencies in California. CDSS “oversees the efforts of counties to \n7  protect California children from abuse and neglect.” The CDSS services division \n8  “provides  leadership  and  oversight  of  county  and  community  agencies  in  the \n9  implementation of child welfare services programs through regulations, training, \n10  technical  assistance,  incentives,  and  program  evaluations.”  At  the  same  time, \n11  CDSS’s licensing division oversees and regulates all foster and group homes in \n12  California. \n13  129.  One of CDSS’s specific oversight responsibilities is to ensure that \n14  counties place foster children in the least restrictive, most family-like environment, \n15  in line with federal law. \n16  130.  Defendant  Kimberly  Johnson  is  the  Director  of  CDSS  and  is \n17  responsible  for  overseeing  CDSS’s  policies,  practices,  and  operations.  She  is \n18  specifically charged with ensuring that CFS complies with all applicable federal and \n19  state laws. \n20  131.  Defendant  Gavin  Newsom  is  the  Governor  and  chief  executive  of \n21  California and is charged with faithfully executing the laws of the state and federal \n22  governments. Together, CDSS, Kimberly Johnson, and Gavin Newsom are referred \n23  as the “State Defendants.” \n24  132.  The State Defendants have violated federal and state mandates. \n25  133.  CDSS has faced scrutiny from state auditors. For example, in 2011, the \n26  California State Auditor noted that CDSS was not adequately preventing registered \n27 \n28 \n \n-32-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 33 of 68   Page ID #:33\n \n1  sex offenders from “inappropriately living or working in its licensed facilities or in \n2  the homes of foster children.” \n3  134.  In  2015,  auditors  again  found  deficiencies  in  CDSS’s  process  for \n4  preventing sex offenders from living in licensed facilities or homes. In 2017, auditors \n5  also  concluded  that  CDSS  was  not  “obtain[ing]  or  review[ing]  all  appropriate \n6  information before allowing individuals access to facilities.” \n7  135.  When  the  Grand  Jury  recommended  that  CFS  implement  an \n8  independent oversight committee, CFS responded that such a request would be \n9  “redundant” because CDSS “is tasked with the responsibility of monitoring and \n10  providing objective recommendations to county child welfare agencies.” Indeed, \n11  CFS claims it “implements any recommendations that CDSS may have in this \n12  regard.” \n13  136.  The State Defendants are not taking the necessary steps to oversee and \n14  rein in CFS to protect foster children.  The Grand Jury noted in 2022 that “CFS has \n15  no  local  accountability,  which  allows  them  to  operate  behind  an  air  of \n16  confidentiality, [which makes] any accountability for their actions [] extremely \n17  difficult.” \n18  III.  THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS ARE AT SEVERE RISK OF FUTURE \n19  HARM AS A RESULT OF CFS’S ILLEGAL PRACTICES AND \n20  PROCEDURES AND THE STATE AND COUNTY DEFENDANTS’ \n21  FAILURE TO EXERCISE ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT \n22  137.  The  following  named  Plaintiffs’  cases  illustrate  how  Defendants’ \n23  collective failures expose foster children in CFS’s custody to a substantial risk of \n24  harm and actual harm. \n25  A.  Gary G. \n26  138.  Gary G. was born on December 8, 2021, and immediately placed in a \n27  Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (“NICU”), where he remained for about two weeks. \n28 \n \n-33-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 34 of 68   Page ID #:34\n \n1  He was connected to a ventilator due to his low Apgar score, difficulty breathing, \n2  syphilis exposure, and potential marijuana exposure. \n3  139.  Gary G.’s biological mother is incarcerated in Texas, and his biological \n4  father, who served 20 years in prison for aggravated robbery, is homeless and \n5  unemployed, residing in California. On December 24, 2021, Gary G. entered CFS’s \n6  custody. CFS then placed him with his current foster mother, who has an FFA-\n7  licensed foster home in Hesperia, California. \n8  140.  Gary G’s medical needs are complex and require ongoing treatment. \n9  He has an undersized head and vision issues, likely due to testing positive for syphilis \n10  at birth. To manage his condition, his foster mother takes him to Loma Linda \n11  University Medical Center every month for treatment. He has blood tests every two \n12  months, has had a preventive MRI, and has received an electroencephalogram. He \n13  needs ongoing treatment from a neurology specialist and an eye specialist. \n14  141.  Gary  G.  also  experiences  delayed  language  and  motor  skills \n15  development and suffers from muscle stiffness. He cannot yet wave or point, has \n16  delayed  babbling,  and  previously  wore  leg  braces  to  treat  tip-toe  walking.  He \n17  requires infant speech, occupational, and physical therapy to aid his development. \n18  142.  Still, Gary G. has faced difficulty obtaining these necessary health \n19  services. His foster mother must travel up to two hours, multiple times per week, to \n20  take him to appointments with doctors and therapists. And Gary G. has been unable \n21  to receive occupational and physical therapy simultaneously. \n22  143.  In addition to these challenges, CFS has failed to adequately monitor \n23  Gary G.  In just over a year, CFS has assigned Gary G. five different caseworkers, \n24  with none lasting for more than two months. \n25  144.  Together, those caseworkers have made only six in-home visits, with \n26  the last in October 2022. All other visits occurred at CFS’s offices. CFS has not held \n27  a single CFT meeting for Gary G., and Gary G.’s caseworkers have failed to learn \n28 \n \n-34-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 35 of 68   Page ID #:35\n \n1  about his case plan or provide a copy to his foster mother despite her repeated \n2  requests. \n3  145.  In February 2022, clinicians recommended referring Gary G. to Inland \n4  Regional Center (“IRC”) to improve healthcare quality and reduce travel time for \n5  treatment.  Gary  G.’s  caseworkers  still  have  not  facilitated  the  referral,  despite \n6  repeated requests from his foster mother. \n7  146.  Gary G.’s caseworkers have ignored his foster mother’s calls, texts, and \n8  emails, and one caseworker failed to submit her IRC referral request. In March 2023, \n9  IRC placed George’s case on “inactive status” after never receiving a response from \n10  his caseworker. \n11  147.  Gary G.’s permanency goal is reunification with his father, who is \n12  homeless, unemployed, and on probation for domestic violence charges. Despite \n13  this, CFS maintains that Gary G.’s father poses no safety risk to him. CFS also does \n14  not have a concurrent plan for him, as federal law requires. \n15  148.   Gary G.’s father does not appear to be following the requirements of \n16  his  reunification  plan.  He  has  not  provided  proof  of  completing  the  required \n17  parenting and domestic violence classes that his case plan requires and has not \n18  submitted proof for all the necessary drug tests. And, he has attended only 40 out of \n19  92 scheduled visits. \n20  149.  Gary G.’s father often exhibits erratic behavior during those visits and \n21  smells like marijuana. Gary G., in turn, has often appeared noticeably stressed while \n22  visiting his father. During one visit, he covered Gary G.’s head with a blanket, which \n23  caused Gary G. to suffer a head injury and visit Urgent Care. Gary G.’s foster mother \n24  has often warned CFS about these issues, but only once did CFS send a caseworker \n25  to supervise a visit with Gary G.’s father. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n-35-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 36 of 68   Page ID #:36\n \n1  150.  Indeed, Gary G. will likely need significant services for the next several \n2  years as healthcare providers monitor his improvement in areas such as head size, \n3  language and motor skills, and muscular development. \n4  151.  Gary G. needs a stable, permanent home, but CFS is not working to \n5  achieve that goal as required by state and federal law. CFS is not working with Gary \n6  G.’s father to determine whether he can provide a home for Gary G., nor is it working \n7  to develop an alternative concurrent plan, as federal law requires. \n8  B.  Xander B., Francesca B., and Delilah B. \n9  152.  Xander B. (born August 26, 2010), Francesca B. (born on August 4, \n10  2012), and Delilah B. (born on April 10, 2014) have been in and out of foster care \n11  since 2014 and continually in CFS’s custody since early 2016. All three children are \n12  siblings. Their mother died of a suspected drug overdose around May 2015. Around \n13  that same time, their father began sexually abusing Francesca B. and Delilah B., and \n14  possibly Xander B. as well. \n15  i.  2016 through July 2020: early placements. \n16  Xander B. \n17  153.  CFS placed Xander B. in three or four foster homes during his first few \n18  months in care. Each of these placements failed because CFS failed to identify foster \n19  parents who were prepared to care for Xander B.’s needs. In late 2016, CFS placed \n20  Xander B. in a group home in Desert Hot Springs, California, where he remained \n21  until 2020. \n22  154.  During the time Xander B. was at the group home, CFS assigned him \n23  four different caseworkers. These caseworkers rarely visited him in person and \n24  instead checked in with him over the phone roughly once per month. Xander B. had \n25  only one CFT meeting during his four years at the group home. \n26  155.  Moreover, the group home where CFS placed Xander B. was neither \n27  clean nor safe. Children wore dirty clothes, while the beds appeared to have bedbugs. \n28 \n \n-36-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 37 of 68   Page ID #:37\n \n1  Physical altercations were common among the children. And, Xander B. had many \n2  of his belongings stolen. \n3  156.  Around that period, doctors discovered that Xander B. suffers from \n4  Nephrotic syndrome, a type of kidney disease requiring daily medication and a low-\n5  sodium diet. From 2018 to 2020, he was hospitalized three times for this condition. \n6  157.   In the years since, Xander B. has also been diagnosed with a host of \n7  different  behavioral  conditions,  including  Intermittent  Explosive  Disorder, \n8  Oppositional  Defiance  Disorder  (“ODD”),  Post  Traumatic  Stress  Disorder \n9  (“PTSD”),  Attention  Deficit  Hyperactivity  Disorder  (“ADHD”),  and  Major \n10  Depressive Disorder. \n11  158.  The group home where CFS placed Xander B. did not properly treat his \n12  ailments. They did not accommodate his dietary needs and required him to buy \n13  supplemental food using the allowance the group home gave him. Further, neither \n14  CFS nor the group home has secured an Individualized Education Plan (“IEP”) or \n15  any other educational aid for him. \n16  Francesca B. and Delilah B. \n17  159.  Between 2016 and 2020, CFS placed Francesca B. in at least 8 and \n18  potentially up to 12 different foster homes. During that same period, CFS placed \n19  Delilah B. in at least 7 and potentially up to 11 different foster homes. While CFS \n20  sometimes placed the sisters together, it often separated them. \n21  160.  Between 2016 and 2020, Francesca B. and Delilah B. had at least four \n22  caseworkers. Those caseworkers collectively held only two CFT meetings in four \n23  years and failed to ensure that the girls had ongoing visits with each other (when \n24  apart) or with their brother. \n25  161.  At one point, CFS placed Francesca B. and Delilah B. with foster \n26  parents  who  repeatedly  beat  the  girls  and  held  their  heads  underwater.  In  one \n27  altercation, the foster parents threw Delilah B. against a wall. As a result of this \n28 \n \n-37-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 38 of 68   Page ID #:38\n \n1  incident, Delilah B. suffered blunt force trauma to her head and left side, had cuts \n2  all over her head and neck, and broke a bone in her hand. \n3  162.  The abuses by their foster parents continued for months before the girls’ \n4  caseworker finally intervened. When Delilah B. did, eventually, visit the hospital, \n5  the doctor recommended a follow-up visit within 30 days to ensure proper healing, \n6  but the caseworker never brought her back. As a result, Delilah B. still walks with a \n7  limp and favors her non-broken hand. \n8  163.  Because of the abuse by their foster parents, both girls have lasting \n9  psychological injuries, and Delilah B. still struggles with water-related activities \n10  such as showering. In addition, the girls have ongoing trauma from their father’s \n11  sexual abuse. CFS has not provided them with the necessary services to deal with \n12  the traumas they have experienced. \n13  i.  July 2020 through December 2022: placement with the \n14  Stronas. \n15  164.  Colleen  Strona  and  Thomas  Strona,  the  children’s  aunt  and  uncle, \n16  sought to care for them as early as 2018, but CFS took over two years to complete \n17  the necessary paperwork. In July 2020, CFS finally placed all three children with the \n18  Stronas in Texas. The caseworkers provided the Stronas with incomplete health and \n19  education information and did not provide them with any of the children’s case \n20  plans. \n21  165.  While  in  the  Stronas’  care,  all  three  children  required  substantial \n22  medical, behavioral, and educational services. Xander B. struggled in school and \n23  exhibited frequent anger outbursts. At one point, Xander B. also acted out sexually \n24  toward his younger sisters. A psychiatrist eventually prescribed him medication for \n25  ADHD. In addition, he requires medication and a specialized diet for his Nephrotic \n26  syndrome. \n27 \n28 \n \n-38-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 39 of 68   Page ID #:39\n \n1  166.  Francesca B. also struggled academically and socially.  She had trouble \n2  discussing her feelings and would often shut down completely. She would also lie \n3  and steal. A psychiatrist diagnosed her with PTSD because of her past traumas. \n4  167.  Delilah B. also struggled academically, eventually having to repeat the \n5  first grade. She also had behavioral outbursts in which she would break objects. A \n6  psychiatrist diagnosed her with dyslexia, ODD, ADHD, and PTSD. \n7  168.  Around mid-2022, Delilah B. received a brain scan, which detected that \n8  she  was  experiencing  brain  tremors.  Her  psychiatrist  prescribed  anti-seizure \n9  medication  and  recommended  continued  evaluations.  She  also  concluded  that \n10  Delilah B. would require elevated care and likely need a caretaker for the rest of her \n11  life. \n12  169.  During this time, the children had infrequent contact with their two \n13  different CFS caseworkers. Caseworker visits occurred monthly over the telephone \n14  and lasted 10 to 15 minutes. During these calls, the caseworkers often forgot the \n15  children’s names and repeatedly asked about their biological parents, despite several \n16  reminders that their father was a sexual predator and their mother was dead. \n17  170.  Apart from these phone visits, caseworkers never provided the Stronas \n18  with the children’s case plans and never held a single CFT meeting for either Xander \n19  B. or the girls. CFS’s caseworkers were uncommunicative and did little to help the \n20  children obtain services. \n21  171.  Caseworkers also often ignored the Stronas’ calls, including warnings \n22  that  Xander  B.  had  stolen  alcohol  and  had  made  a  suicidal  gesture.  CFS’s \n23  caseworkers  also  never  provided  Delilah  B.’s  psychiatrist  with  the  necessary \n24  medical records and neglected to file the required paperwork for Delilah B. to \n25  receive her ADHD and anti-seizure medication. \n26  172.  Without adequate help from CFS, the Stronas decided that they could \n27  not  continue  caring  for  the  three  siblings.  In  December  2022,  CFS  transferred \n28 \n \n-39-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 40 of 68   Page ID #:40\n \n1  Xander B. to a group home in Chino County, California, and placed Delilah B. and \n2  Francesca B. in an FFA-foster home in Victorville, California. \n3  iii.  December 2022 through the present: recent placements. \n4  173.  The Stronas provided CFS with detailed medical information for all \n5  three children before releasing them. Despite this, Xander B. spent his first 30 days \n6  in his current home without his Nephrotic syndrome medication and is still not \n7  receiving medication for ADHD. \n8  174.  Francesca B. and Delilah B.’s placement in a foster home in Victorville \n9  was disrupted when the foster family’s dog attacked Delilah B., requiring six stitches \n10  on her face. CFS kept the girls in that home for three more weeks before moving \n11  them.  The  girls  currently  reside  in  an  FFA-foster  home  in  Covina,  California.  \n12  Although Ms. Strona sent CFS all of their paperwork, CFS has yet to forward any of \n13  it to the new foster parents. \n14  175.  CFS  has  not  developed  a  permanent  or  concurrent  plan  for  these \n15  children, despite being required to do so by federal law. In addition, CFS is not \n16  providing all of the ongoing services Xander B. requires, which include a specialized \n17  diet  and  medication  for  his  nephrotic  syndrome,  medication  for  ADHD,  and \n18  therapeutic services for various behavioral issues. Both girls also require substantial \n19  ongoing services, which they are not receiving, and Delilah B. needs medication for \n20  seizures and medication. \n21  C.  Teddy H. \n22  176.  Teddy H. was born on March 5, 2019, and has been in CFS’s custody \n23  since April 2022 after police raided his mother’s home and found methamphetamine \n24  within close reach of him. He lives in a County-licensed foster family home in the \n25  County. Teddy H.’s biological father also has an extensive criminal history. \n26  177.  CFS  first  placed  Teddy  H.  with  a  foster  family  in  Victorville, \n27  California. About two weeks later, CFS moved Teddy H. to live with an adult cousin. \n28 \n \n-40-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 41 of 68   Page ID #:41\n \n1  At that placement, Teddy H. received a referral to IRC for speech therapy. After \n2  three  months  in  that  placement,  CFS  placed  Teddy  H.  with  his  stepmother  in \n3  Palmdale, marking his third placement in just four months. \n4  178.  Teddy H.’s stepmother had cared for him for most of his life before he \n5  entered foster care. Even so, Teddy H.’s stepmother could not follow up on the IRC \n6  referral because she was not his educational rights holder.2 As a result, Teddy H. \n7  could not receive the speech therapy he required. \n8  179.  In March 2023, CFS removed Teddy H. from his stepmother’s home \n9  and placed him with another family in Victorville. As a result of CFS’s actions, \n10  Teddy H. has lost contact with his stepmother, who had been his primary caregiver \n11  for most of his life. \n12  180.  The caseworkers that CFS has assigned to Teddy H. have failed to \n13  adequately monitor his placements or engage in effective case planning. They have \n14  not held any CFT meetings for Teddy H., have never shown or discussed his case \n15  plan with any of his foster parents, and the current caseworker has not properly \n16  supervised Teddy H.’s visits with his parents. As a result of the failings of CFS and \n17  its caseworkers, on one occasion, Teddy H.’s father walked out of the CFS office \n18  with him. \n19  181.  What is more, CFS has not properly managed either Teddy H.’s service \n20  needs or permanency needs. CFS has provided no services to address Teddy H.’s \n21  delayed speech issues. And, CFS has failed to help Teddy H.’s father with his \n22  reunification plan. \n23 \n \n24  2 Under California law, “[p]arents generally have the right to make educational \ndecisions for their children unless their child is in a legal guardianship, their child \n25 \nhas been freed for adoption (parental rights have been terminated), or the juvenile \n26  court has limited their educational rights.”  California Foster Care Education Law \nFact Sheets, California Foster Youth Education Task Force (February 2014) at 9, \n27 \nhttps://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/BTB_23_5O_11.pdf. \n28 \n \n-41-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 42 of 68   Page ID #:42\n \n1  182.  In short, Teddy H. needs a stable, permanent home along with services \n2  to treat his delayed speech. But, CFS is not working with him, his relatives, or his \n3  caregivers to ensure that he receives the care that he needs. \n4  D.  Kevin E. and Sam E. \n5  183.  Kevin E. and Sam E. are twins born on January 20, 2010. They have \n6  been in CFS’s custody since 2017 due to their biological parents’ drug use. Their \n7  father is incarcerated. CFS has shuffled Kevin E. and Sam E. through several foster \n8  homes since they entered foster care. They have been in their current foster home \n9  since November 2022. \n10  184.  Kevin E. and Sam E.’s current foster parents have severely restricted \n11  the boys’ ability to communicate with friends and family. At the urging of CFS, they \n12  have not allowed the boys to have cell phones or use social media, and they took \n13  away Kevin E.’s tablet. They have instructed Kevin E. to avoid contacting Ms. \n14  Fromm, their next friend and someone with ongoing concerns about the boys’ safety \n15  and wellbeing. \n16  185.  CFS has also limited Kevin E. and Sam E.’s ability to visit friends and \n17  family outside their foster parents’ presence. At one CFT meeting, their caseworker \n18  told Ms. Fromm that Ms. Fromm’s daughter could only visit Kevin E. and Sam. E. \n19  in the presence of their foster parents. The boys’ grandparents are also only allowed \n20  to have supervised visits. \n21  186.  Kevin E. and Sam E. have had at least two caseworkers in the past six \n22  months,  both  of  whom  appeared  to  be  newly  hired  and  unable  to  adequately \n23  supervise or manage the boys. \n24  187.  Ms. Fromm has observed that the boys may require mental health \n25  services. For instance, Sam E. engages in attention-seeking and defiant behaviors, \n26  while Kevin E. behaves in a withdrawn manner and has made depressive statements \n27  such as “KMS” (“kill myself”). \n28 \n \n-42-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 43 of 68   Page ID #:43\n \n1  188.  And after six years in foster care, CFS has never shown Kevin E. or \n2  Sam E. their case plan or done anything to recognize the teenage boys’ own needs \n3  and preferences, as California law requires. Meanwhile, CFT meetings, when they \n4  have occurred, have failed to include all necessary parties. \n5  189.  One virtual CFT meeting proceeded without a representative from the \n6  boy’s  FFA,  the  boys’  grandparents  (who  were  not  even  invited),  or  the  boys \n7  themselves. And, during that meeting, the caseworker never brought up the boys’ \n8  case plan or permanency plans. \n9  190.  In another instance, the caseworker questioned whether Ms. Fromm \n10  should be allowed to attend CFT meetings even after Kevin E. specifically requested \n11  that she be included. \n12  191.  Kevin E. and Sam E. have expressed to Ms. Fromm that, after six years \n13  in foster care, they are losing hope and feel like no one cares about them. These boys \n14  are legally entitled to a clear permanency plan developed with their preferences in \n15  mind, a concurrent plan, and any necessary treatment to address their psychological \n16  issues. \n17  E.  Henry P. \n18  192.  Henry P. was born on July 13, 2007, and has been in CFS’s custody \n19  since December 2019. He lives in an FFA-licensed foster home in Huntington \n20  Beach, California. His biological father is incarcerated, and he has little contact with \n21  his biological mother. \n22  193.  When Henry P. and his siblings first entered foster care, CFS had them \n23  spend several days at a CFS office sleeping on cots. CFS then separated the siblings, \n24  sending Henry P., his biological brother, and his step-brother to one foster family \n25  home and his sisters to another. The placement quickly ended because CFS placed \n26  Henry P. with foster parents who spoke only Spanish and with whom Henry P. could \n27  not communicate. \n28 \n \n-43-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 44 of 68   Page ID #:44\n \n1  194.  Soon after, around February 2020, CFS moved Henry P., along with his \n2  biological  brother,  sister,  and  step-brother,  to  a  foster  parent  who  was  his \n3  stepmother’s friend. Henry P. struggled in this placement. He and his siblings were \n4  underfed and forced to spend most of the day outside, while the foster parent’s \n5  children had ample food and freedom to move about the house. \n6  195.  CFS eventually moved Henry P. to a group home in July 2021 after his \n7  previous foster parent claimed he was bullying his younger siblings. Those siblings \n8  remain in the last placement. \n9  196.  Henry  P.  had  a  “terrible”  experience  at  the  group  home.  The \n10  environment was unstable, and there was not adequate food for residents. Henry P. \n11  often ate only peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for days on end. CFS’s caseworkers \n12  visited him only four or five times during the 14 months he spent in that group home. \n13  197.  CFS  transferred  Henry  P.  to  a  foster  home  in  Huntington  Beach, \n14  California in September 2022 after that foster family took an interest in him through \n15  a mutual acquaintance. This family has done its best to care for Henry P. but has \n16  been consistently hampered by CFS. \n17  198.  CFS did not inspect the foster home before placing Henry P. there and \n18  did not timely transfer his files, leaving his foster parents unable to request medical \n19  assessments for weeks. \n20  199.  What  is  more,  Henry  P.  shows  signs  of  potentially  undiagnosed \n21  behavioral  issues,  but  CFS  has  not  identified  any  service  needs  or  provided \n22  information  on  prior  assessments.  His  foster  parents  have  requested  behavioral \n23  assessments, but CFS has made no referrals. \n24  200.  Nor  has  CFS  provided  Henry  P.’s  foster  parents  with  any  clear \n25  permanency goal, even though there is an open inter-state compact request to send \n26  him to live with an aunt in New York that has been pending for two years. Henry \n27 \n28 \n \n-44-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 45 of 68   Page ID #:45\n \n1  P.’s  foster  parents  have  repeatedly  requested  updates  and  details,  but  CFS  has \n2  provided none. \n3  201.  CFS’s caseworkers also do not visit Henry P. regularly. Henry P.’s \n4  previous caseworker contacted him only twice in seven months, and one of these \n5  meetings occurred on a video call. And the caseworker has not conducted any CFT \n6  meetings in his current foster home. \n7  202.  Nor has CFS facilitated any visits with Henry P.’s father or siblings, \n8  despite Henry P.’s repeated requests. In September 2022, his foster parents began \n9  requesting visits for Henry P. with his father, whom he has not seen since November \n10  2021. CFS only recently approved the visitation request in March 2023 but has not \n11  yet scheduled a visit. Henry P. has also not seen either of his brothers since July \n12  2021. \n13  203.  As of May 2023, Henry P. has no assigned caseworker. His previous \n14  caseworker appears to have been terminated for taking inappropriate photographs of \n15  children in his care. \n16  204.  As a result of CFS’s failures, Henry P.’s life is defined by uncertainty. \n17  Even though he is doing well in his current placement and receiving decent grades \n18  at his high school, he feels tremendous anxiety not knowing where he will be living \n19  or attending school next year. And, he does not have a meaningful connection with \n20  any of his prior caseworkers or anyone else at CFS to help guide him. \n21  205.  Henry P., at 15 years old, is at a critical juncture in his life where he \n22  needs structure and stability. His lack of caseworker visits and family visits, along \n23  with inadequate permanency and concurrent planning, expose him to a substantial \n24  risk of harm. \n25  F.  David O., Greg R., and Arnold O.  \n26  206.  David O. (born on August 15, 2009), Greg R. (born September 27, \n27  2018), and Arnold O. (born March 6, 2021) are siblings who have been in CFS’s \n28 \n \n-45-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 46 of 68   Page ID #:46\n \n1  custody since March 2021. The children still have a relationship with their mother, \n2  who struggles with mental health-related issues, and each has varying degrees of \n3  contact with their fathers. \n4  207.  CFS placed the boys in four foster homes during their first two months \n5  in care. CFS later separated David O. from his brothers, eventually shuffling him \n6  through five more placements. As a result, David O. has had nine placements in just \n7  two years. Greg R. and Arnold O. each remain at their fourth placement. \n8  208.  Though the children have a Latinx heritage, they speak only English. \n9  Despite  this,  CFS  has  repeatedly  placed  them  in  Spanish-only  speaking  foster \n10  homes. In their first two placements, the foster parents spoke no English at all; in \n11  their third placement, only one family member spoke English. In Greg R. and Arnold \n12  O.’s current placement, only the older children speak English. \n13  209.  CFS has also failed to provide David O., Greg R., and Arnold O. with \n14  adequate planning and services and has assigned them five caseworkers in the past \n15  two years. These caseworkers have held only two CFT meetings in that time. Since \n16  separating David O. from his siblings, CFS has allowed only three visits among the \n17  brothers. Because of CFS’s failures in this regard, at one point, David O. went 14 \n18  months without seeing his brothers. \n19  i.  David O. \n20  210.  CFS moved David O. to his fifth placement after he complained that \n21  his prior foster parents’ adult child slapped him. Once again, CFS moved him to a \n22  foster home where the foster parents spoke only Spanish. These foster parents \n23  expected David O. to handle all his laundry, cleaning, and cooking. As a result, \n24  David O. went weeks without clean clothes and suffered recurrent bowel problems \n25  from his poor diet. \n26  211.  Soon after, CFS placed David O. in yet another foster home. There, \n27  without proper vetting or monitoring by CFS’s caseworkers, the foster parents would \n28 \n \n-46-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 47 of 68   Page ID #:47\n \n1  verbally berate him. David O. reported the abuse to his grandmother, who relayed it \n2  to his caseworker. David O.’s caseworker never responded to this report of oral \n3  abuse, and soon after, the foster parent barred the grandmother from visiting David \n4  O. \n5  212.  In February 2023, CFS abruptly removed David O. from that placement \n6  and transferred him to a youth shelter that lacked adequate supervision. On David \n7  O.’s first night, he left with a 17-year-old boy who had stolen a car. After he was \n8  caught, police returned him to the shelter. On another occasion, a young woman \n9  brought a knife into the facility, assaulted David O., and stabbed another resident. \n10  213.  While David O. was at the shelter, his caseworker never provided him \n11  with necessary clothing, ensured he was enrolled in school, or arranged family visits. \n12  David O. could not even get a haircut because he lacked funds in his account. \n13  214.  In  February  2023,  CFS  moved  David  O.  to  his  ninth  and  current \n14  placement at a group home in Oakland, California. The group home is several \n15  hundred  miles  from  his  younger  brothers  and  nearly  1,000  miles  from  his \n16  grandmother’s home in Colorado. \n17  215.  David O. has many service needs. He was recently diagnosed with \n18  ADHD and PTSD and has a history of gastrointestinal issues. He also has untreated \n19  dental  problems,  requires  updated  corrective  lenses,  and  requires  additional \n20  psychological and medical services. \n21  ii.  Greg R. and Arnold O.  \n22  216.  CFS has not provided Greg R. and Arnold O.’s foster parents with any \n23  information about either of the boys’ medical needs. Greg R. is behind on his \n24  ongoing mental and physical health assessments, is overdue for dental follow-ups, \n25  and has untreated cavities. Moreover, he has food allergies and requires a special \n26  diet, which the current foster family does not provide. As a result, he has had trouble \n27  gaining weight. \n28 \n \n-47-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 48 of 68   Page ID #:48\n \n1  217.  Greg R. is not yet toilet-trained at four years old, and, lacking adequate \n2  supervision or guidance from CFS, his foster family has made no efforts to address \n3  this issue. As a result, he is not yet eligible for preschool, and his social skills are \n4  falling behind. \n5  218.  Arnold  O.  is  non-verbal,  has  delayed  motor  skills,  and  requires \n6  specialized  care,  including  occupational  therapy,  physical  therapy,  and  speech \n7  therapy. CFS has failed to provide him with timely mental health, physical health, \n8  and dental assessments and services. Arnold O. also exhibits behavioral issues, such \n9  as pulling his brother’s hair, biting, scratching, and throwing tantrums. \n10  219.  Greg  R.  and  Arnold  O.  needs  medical,  behavioral,  dental,  and \n11  educational services that CFS is not providing. They also require placement in a \n12  home equipped to communicate with them properly. \n13  220.  David O., Greg R., and Arnold O. all need and are legally entitled to a \n14  permanent plan that will provide them with a permanent family and an appropriate, \n15  individualized concurrent plan and the services necessary to ensure such a placement \n16  will likely succeed. \n17  * * * \n18  221.  Defendants’ policies, patterns, practices, or customs have violated and \n19  will  continue  to  violate  these  children’s  rights  under  state  and  federal  laws. \n20  Inadequate  staffing,  for  instance,  prevents  CFS  caseworkers  from  adequately \n21  supervising  the  children  and  supporting  their  families  or  foster  parents.  And \n22  Defendants  are  keeping  these  children  in  unsuitable  homes  without  providing \n23  adequate case planning to ensure each child has both a clear permanent plan and \n24  alternate concurrent plan, as well as the necessary services that state and federal laws \n25  require. These children thus have all been harmed and all remain at risk of continuing \n26  suffering and irreparable harm. \n27  / / / \n28 \n \n-48-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 49 of 68   Page ID #:49\n \n1  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n2  222.  This action is proper as a class action under Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2) \n3  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n4  223.  This action consists of one general class and one subclass: \n5  a)  all children for whom CFS has or will have legal responsibility \n6  and who are or will be in CFS’s legal and physical custody (“General Class”); \n7  b)  all  children  who  are  or  will  be  in  CFS’s  custody  and  have \n8  physical, cognitive, and/or psychiatric disabilities (“ADA Subclass”). \n9  224.  Each class is numerous enough to make joinder impracticable: \n10  a)  The  General  Class  consists  of  around  5,771  children  who \n11  currently are in or will enter CFS’s custody; \n12  b)  The  ADA  Subclass  consists  of  hundreds  of  children  with \n13  disabilities who are already in or will enter CFS’s custody. \n14  225.  The questions of fact and law that the Plaintiffs raise are common to \n15  and typical of those of each putative member of the General Class and ADA Subclass \n16  whom they seek to represent. \n17  226.  The  named  Plaintiffs  rely  on  the  State  Defendants  and  County \n18  Defendants for foster care services in San Bernardino County and wholly depend on \n19  them to provide those services. \n20  227.  Defendants’ long-standing and well-documented actions and inactions \n21  substantially  depart  from  accepted  professional  judgment  and  standards  and \n22  constitute deliberate indifference to the harm and risk of harm to and violations of \n23  the Plaintiffs and their legal rights and those of the General Class and ADA Subclass \n24  they represent. \n25  228.  Common questions of fact to the General Class and ADA Subclass \n26  include: \n27 \n28 \n \n-49-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 50 of 68   Page ID #:50\n \n1  a)  whether the State Defendants and County Defendants fail to \n2  protect the General Class from physical and psychological harm and risk of \n3  harm; \n4  b)  whether the State Defendants and County Defendants provide \n5  adequate caseworker resources to ensure that members of the General Class \n6  and ADA Subclass routinely meet with caseworkers face-to-face, receive \n7  individualized case plans, and receive all necessary services to enable the \n8  General Class and ADA Subclass to avoid harm and the risk of harm; \n9  c)  whether the County Defendants take steps required to initiate \n10  termination of parental rights proceedings for all children who have been in \n11  foster care for 15 out of the last 22 months unless there is a compelling reason \n12  why that would not be in the child’s best interests as documented in the record, \n13  or the child is otherwise eligible for a statutory exception; and \n14  d)  whether the State Defendants and County Defendants operate a \n15  system  that  adequately  tailors  appropriate  placements,  treatments,  and \n16  supports to the individual needs of the members of the General Class and \n17  ADA Subclass; \n18  e)  whether the State Defendants and County Defendants operate a \n19  system that provides an adequate number and diversity of placements to \n20  permit the members of the General Class and ADA Subclass to reside in the \n21  least restrictive and most family-like environment; \n22  f)  whether the State Defendants and County Defendants operate a \n23  system  that  promptly  and  adequately  assesses  the  individual  needs  of \n24  members of the General Class and ADA Subclass; \n25  g)  whether the State Defendants and County Defendants deprive \n26  members of the ADA Subclass necessary and appropriate services to ensure \n27 \n28 \n \n-50-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 51 of 68   Page ID #:51\n \n1  access to home and community-based placements and supports so that they \n2  can fully benefit from foster care services. \n3  229.  Common questions of law to the General Class and ADA Subclass \n4  include: \n5  a)  whether the State Defendants and County Defendants’ systemic \n6  failures violate Plaintiffs’ rights under the Adoption Assistance and Child \n7  Welfare Act, as amended by the Adoption and Safe Families Act, including \n8  their right to placement in the least restrictive, most family-like setting, closest \n9  to their home community that conforms to professional standards, placement \n10  with relatives whenever possible, access to necessary services to protect their \n11  safety and health, and comprehensive written case plans, along with a case \n12  review system ensuring those case plans are in place and are updated, and \n13  their right to permanency by seeking the termination of parental rights after \n14  they have been in custody for 15 out of the last 22 months, subject to certain \n15  exceptions; \n16  b)  whether  the  County  Defendants’  systemic  failures  violate \n17  Plaintiffs’ rights under the California Welfare and Institutions Code, including \n18  their right to comprehensive written case plans, along with a case review \n19  system ensuring those case plans are in place and are updated; and  \n20  c)  whether the State Defendants and County Defendants’ systemic \n21  failures violate Plaintiffs’ substantive rights under the Due Process Clause of \n22  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  including \n23  exposing  children  to  neglect,  abuse,  trauma,  harmful  and  inadequate \n24  placements, lack of necessary services, and lack of permanency planning; \n25  d)  whether  the  County  Defendants’  systemic  failures  violate \n26  Plaintiffs’ substantive rights under Article I of the California Constitution, \n27 \n28 \n \n-51-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 52 of 68   Page ID #:52\n \n1  including exposing children to neglect, abuse, trauma, harmful and inadequate \n2  placements, lack of necessary services, and lack of permanency planning; \n3  e)  whether the State Defendants and County Defendants’ systemic \n4  failures  violate  Plaintiffs’  rights  under  the  First  Amendment’s  right  of \n5  association  and  right  to  a  permanent  family,  along  with  the  Ninth \n6  Amendment’s  reservation  of  rights  to  the  people,  and  the  Fourteenth \n7  Amendment’s right to due process; \n8  f)  whether the State Defendants and County Defendants’ systemic \n9  failures violate the ADA Subclass Plaintiffs’ rights under (1) the Americans \n10  with Disabilities Act; (2) the Rehabilitation Act; and (3) all regulations issued \n11  to implement the above laws; \n12  g)  whether the County Defendants’ systemic failures violate the \n13  ADA Subclass Plaintiffs’ rights under the California Government Code. \n14  230.  The violations of law and resulting harms that Plaintiffs allege are \n15  typical of the legal violations and harms or risk of harm that all children in the \n16  General Class and ADA Subclass experience. \n17  231.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly protect the interests of the General \n18  Class and ADA Subclass they seek to represent. \n19  232.  Defendants have acted or failed to act on grounds generally applicable \n20  to all members of the General Class or, where appropriate, ADA Subclass, requiring \n21  class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief. \n22  233.  Counsel for Plaintiffs know of no conflict among the class members. \n23  234.

Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate each allegation in this Complaint. \n11 \n236.  Federal law gives Plaintiffs specific rights under the AACWA. \n12 \n237.  Defendants’ foregoing policies, patterns, practices, or customs deprive \n13 \nPlaintiffs of their rights under the AACWA, as amended by the ASFA, to: \n14 \na)  placement in the least restrictive and most family-like setting, \n15 \nclosest to their home community that conforms to nationally recommended \n16 \nprofessional standards, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(5)(A); \n17 \nb)  access to quality services to protect their safety and health, 42 \n18 \nU.S.C. § 671(a)(22); \n19 \nc)  a  written  case  plan  that  includes  a  plan  to  provide  safe, \n20 \nappropriate, and stable placements, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(A); \n21 \nd)  a written case plan that ensures that they receive safe and proper \n22 \ncare  while  in  foster  care  and  implementation  of  that  plan,  42  U.S.C. \n23 \n§§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(B); \n24 \ne)  a  written  case  plan  that  ensures  the  provision  of  services  to \n25 \nthemselves, their parents, and their foster parents to facilitate reunification, or \n26 \nwhere that is not practicable, their permanent placement and implementation \n27 \nof that case plan, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(B);  \n28 \n \n-53-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 54 of 68   Page ID #:54\n \n1  f)  a case review system in which each Plaintiff has a case plan \n2  designed to achieve safe and appropriate foster care placements in the least \n3  restrictive and most family-like setting, close to their home community, 42 \n4  U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(5)(A); and \n5  g)  the right to have a petition to terminate parental rights filed if the \n6  Plaintiff has been in foster care for 15 out of the last 22 months unless doing \n7  so would be against their best interest as documented in the case record or a \n8  statutory exemption applies. 42 U.S.C. § 675(5)(E). \n9  238.  These provisions are intended to benefit Plaintiffs and members of the \n10  General Class and ADA Subclass. The rights conferred by these provisions are \n11  neither vague nor amorphous, such as to strain judicial competence, and the statute \n12  imposes a binding obligation on the states. 42 U.S.C. § 1983; see also Henry A. v. \n13  Willden, 678 F.3d 991, 1008–09 (9th Cir. 2012). \n14  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nCal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 16501.1, 16503(a), et seq.–State Statutory Rights (On \n15 \nBehalf of the General Class Against County Defendants) \n16 \n239.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate each allegation in this Complaint. \n17 \n240.  The California Government Code imposes liability on public entities \n18 \nfor  injuries  proximately  caused  by  their  failure  to  discharge  a  mandatory  duty \n19 \n“unless  the  public  entity  establishes  that  it  exercised  reasonable  diligence  to \n20 \ndischarge the duty.” Cal. Gov’t Code § 815.6. \n21 \n241.  State law imposes specific mandatory duties on the County Defendants \n22 \nunder the California Welfare and Institutions Code. \n23 \n242.  The  County  Defendants’  foregoing  policies,  patterns,  practices,  or \n24 \ncustoms deprive Plaintiffs of their rights in the California Welfare and Institutions \n25 \nCode, including: \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n-54-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 55 of 68   Page ID #:55\n \n1  a)  the right to have “[a] written case plan . . . completed within a \n2  maximum of 60 days of the initial removal of the child,” Cal. Welf. & Inst. \n3  Code § 16501.1(e); \n4  b)  the right to have the case plan updated “no less frequently than \n5  once every six months,” and for “[e]ach updated case plan [to] include a \n6  description of the services that have been provided to the child under the plan \n7  and an evaluation of the appropriateness and effectiveness of those services,” \n8  id.; \n9  c)  the right to have the case plan “identify specific goals and the \n10  appropriateness of the planned services in meeting those goals,” Cal. Welf. & \n11  Inst. Code § 16501.1(g)(2); \n12  d)  the  right  to  have  the  case  plan  “include  provisions  for  the \n13  development and maintenance of sibling relationships,” Cal. Welf. & Inst. \n14  Code § 16501.1(g)(6); \n15  e)  the right to have the case plan “ensure the educational stability \n16  of the child while in foster care,” Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 16501.1(g)(8); \n17  f)  if the child’s permanency goal is reunification, the right to have \n18  the case plan “describe the services to be provided to assist in reunification,” \n19  Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 16501.1(g)(10); \n20  g)  if the child’s permanency goal is not reunification, the right to \n21  have the case plan “include a statement of the child’s wishes regarding their \n22  permanent placement plan and an assessment of those stated wishes” Cal. \n23  Welf. & Inst. Code § 16501.1(g)(15); \n24  h)  the right to have “the agency responsible for placement and care \n25  of a minor . . . ensure that a child in foster care . . . receive[s] administrative \n26  reviews periodically but no less frequently than once every six months,” Cal. \n27  Welf. & Inst.

Welf. \n5  & Inst. Code § 16503(a). \n6  243.  These provisions are intended to benefit Plaintiffs and the classes they \n7  represent. The rights they confer are neither vague nor amorphous, such as to strain \n8  judicial competence, and the statute imposes a binding obligation on the states. \n9  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n42 U.S.C. § 1983–Federal Right to Substantive Due Process (On Behalf of the \n10 \nGeneral Class Against State Defendants and County Defendants) \n11 \n244.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate each allegation in this Complaint. \n12 \n245.  States  and  municipal  entities  assume  affirmative  duties  under  the \n13 \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution to provide reasonable care \n14 \nand protect from harm any child with whom they have formed a special relationship, \n15 \nsuch as children in foster care. \n16 \n246.  These substantive due process rights include, but are not limited to: \n17 \na)  the right to freedom from the foreseeable risk of maltreatment \n18 \nwhile under the protective supervision of the State; \n19 \nb)  the  right  to  protection  from  unnecessary  intrusions  into  the \n20 \nchild’s  emotional  wellbeing  once  the  State  has  established  a  special \n21 \nrelationship with that child; \n22 \nc)  the right to services necessary to prevent unreasonable risk of \n23 \nharm in the least restrictive environment; \n24 \nd)  the right to conditions and duration of foster care reasonably \n25 \nrelated to the purpose and assumption of government custody; \n26 \ne)  the right to treatment and care consistent with the purpose and \n27 \nassumptions of government custody; \n28 \n \n-56-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 57 of 68   Page ID #:57\n \n1  f)  the right not to be maintained in custody longer than is necessary \n2  to accomplish the purpose to be served by taking a child into government \n3  custody; and \n4  g)  the right to receive or be reunited with an appropriate permanent \n5  home and family within a reasonable period. \n6  247.  Defendants  have  developed  and  maintained  policies,  patterns, \n7  practices,  or  customs  that  represent  a  substantial  departure  from  accepted \n8  professional judgment and standards and deprive all members of the General Class \n9  their constitutionally-protected rights. \n10  248.  Defendants know that these policies, patterns, practices, or customs \n11  exist and harm these class members, yet are deliberately indifferent to the harm they \n12  cause. As a result, all the members of the General Class have been, and are at \n13  substantial risk of being, deprived of their constitutional rights. \n14  FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nArt. I, §7(a) Cal. Const.–State Right to Substantive Due Process (On Behalf of \n15 \nthe General Class Against County Defendants) \n16 \n249.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate each allegation in this Complaint. \n17 \n250.  Municipal entities assume affirmative duties under Article I of the \n18 \nCalifornia Constitution to provide care and protect from reasonable harm any child \n19 \nwith whom it has formed a special relationship, such as those in foster care. \n20 \n251.  County Defendants have developed and maintained policies, patterns, \n21 \npractices, or customs that substantially depart from accepted professional judgment \n22 \nand deprive all members of the General Class of their constitutionally-protected \n23 \nrights. \n24 \n252.  Defendants know that these policies, patterns, practices, or customs \n25 \nexist and harm these class members, yet are deliberately indifferent to them. As a \n26 \nresult, all the members of the General Class have been, and are at substantial risk of \n27 \nbeing, deprived of their constitutional rights. \n28 \n \n-57-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 58 of 68   Page ID #:58\n \n1  FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n42 U.S.C. § 1983–Federal Right to Family Association (On Behalf of the \n2 \nGeneral Class Against State Defendants and County Defendants) \n3 \n253.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate each allegation in this Complaint. \n4 \n254.  The First Amendment’s right of association and right to a permanent \n5 \nfamily, along with the Ninth Amendment’s reservation of rights to the people, and \n6 \nthe  Fourteenth  Amendment’s  right  to  due  process,  impose  on  states  and \n7 \nmunicipalities affirmative duties to provide reasonable efforts to obtain a permanent \n8 \nhome and family. \n9 \n255.  The General Class members are in Defendants’ custody or guardianship \n10 \nand depend on Defendants to provide for their basic physical, psychological, and \n11 \nemotional needs and to protect them from physical, psychological, and emotional \n12 \nharm. \n13 \n256.  These  class  members  frequently  and  foreseeably  suffer  physical, \n14 \npsychological,  and  emotional  harm  in  CFS’s  custody.  This  harm  occurs  partly \n15 \nbecause these class members are continually shuttled between temporary and often \n16 \nnon-familial custodial arrangements. \n17 \n257.  Therefore, professional judgment and standards of conduct require the \n18 \nDefendants to make reasonable efforts toward placing children in their custody in \n19 \nstable, permanent families. \n20 \n258.  Defendants  know  the  General  Class  members  have  a  right  to  a \n21 \npermanent home and family yet have failed to make reasonable efforts to achieve \n22 \nthis. \n23 \n259.  Defendants’  foregoing  policies,  patterns,  practices,  or  customs \n24 \nrepresent  a  substantial  departure  from  professional  judgment  and  deliberate \n25 \nindifference to the General Class members’ constitutional rights. \n26 \n260.  As a result, the General Class members of the General Class have been, \n27 \nand are at risk of being, deprived of their right to familial association and reasonable \n28 \n \n-58-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 59 of 68   Page ID #:59\n \n1  protection from physical, psychological, and emotional harm while in Defendants’ \n2  custody. This violates the First Amendment’s freedom of association, the Ninth \n3  Amendment’s reservation of rights to the people, and the Fourteenth Amendment’s \n4  substantive due process protections. \n5  SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq. –The Americans with Disabilities Act  \n6 \n(On Behalf of the ADA Subclass Against State Defendants and County \n7  Defendants) \n8 \n261.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate each allegation in this Complaint. \n9 \n262.  Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131,  et seq., and its enabling \n10 \nregulations,  28  C.F.R.  35.101  et  seq.  (2022),  prohibit  public  entities  from \n11 \ndiscriminating against individuals with disabilities because of their disability. \n12 \n263.  Specifically, “[n]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason \n13 \nof such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the \n14 \nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination \n15 \nby any such entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n16 \n264.  Members of the ADA Subclass experience physical, cognitive, and \n17 \npsychiatric disabilities that qualify them as individuals with disabilities under the \n18 \nADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2). \n19 \n265.  Defendants are public entities and public officials of those entities, and \n20 \nall are subject to the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1)(A)–(B). \n21 \n266.  Under the regulations implementing the ADA, public entities may not, \n22 \ndirectly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, do any of the \n23 \nfollowing based on an individual’s disability: \n24 \na)  “[d]eny a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to \n25 \nparticipate  in  or  benefit  from  aid,  benefit,  or  service,”  28  C.F.R.  § \n26 \n35.130(b)(1)(i); \n27 \n28 \n \n-59-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 60 of 68   Page ID #:60\n \n1  b)  “[a]fford a qualified individual with a disability an opportunity \n2  to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to \n3  that afforded others,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(ii); \n4  c)  “[p]rovide a qualified individual with a disability with an aid, \n5  benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to \n6  obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of \n7  achievement as that provided to others,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(iii); \n8  d)  “[a]id or perpetuate discrimination against a qualified individual \n9  with  a  disability  by  providing  significant  assistance  to  an  agency, \n10  organization,  or  person  that  discriminates  on  the  basis  of  disability  in \n11  providing any aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries of the public entity’s \n12  program,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(v); or \n13  e)  “[o]therwise limit a qualified individual with a disability in the \n14  enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others \n15  receiving the aid, benefit, or service,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(1)(vii). \n16  267.  A public entity also may not use criteria or methods of administration \n17  that: \n18  a)  “have  the  effect  of  subjecting  qualified  individuals  with \n19  disabilities to discrimination based on disability,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(i); \n20  b)  “have  the  purpose  or  effect  of  defeating  or  substantially \n21  impairing the accomplishments of the objectives of the public entity's program \n22  with respect to individuals with disabilities,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(ii); or \n23  c)  “perpetuate the discrimination of another public entity if both \n24  public entities are subject to common administrative control or are agencies \n25  of the same State,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(iii). \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n-60-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 61 of 68   Page ID #:61\n \n1  268.  Instead, the public entity is required to “make reasonable modifications \n2  in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid \n3  discrimination on the basis of disability[.]” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7)(i). \n4  269.  Defendants,  however,  through  their  foregoing  policies,  patterns, \n5  practices, or customs, have discriminated against the members of the ADA Subclass \n6  based on their disabilities in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n7  270.  As a result, the ADA Subclass members have suffered injuries, are at \n8  risk of suffering injuries, and will continue to be at risk of suffering further injuries \n9  unless Defendants are required to comply with applicable law. \n10  SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n29 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.–The Rehabilitation Act \n11 \n(On Behalf of the ADA Subclass Against State Defendants and County \n12  Defendants) \n13 \n271.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate each allegation in this Complaint. \n14 \n272.  Like the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act and its implementing regulations \n15 \nprohibit  entities  receiving  federal  funding  from  excluding  individuals  with \n16 \ndisabilities or from discriminating against individuals because of their disabilities. \n17 \n29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n18 \n273.  Under the regulations implementing the Rehabilitation Act, covered \n19 \nentities may not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, \n20 \ndo any of the following based on disability: \n21 \na)  “[d]eny a qualified [individual with a disability] the opportunity \n22 \nto  participate  in  or  benefit  from  aid,  benefit,  or  service,”  45  C.F.R.  § \n23 \n84.4(b)(1)(i); see also 45 C.F.R. §84.52(a)(1); \n24 \nb)  “[a]fford a qualified [individual with a disability] an opportunity \n25 \nto participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to \n26 \nthat  afforded  others,”  28  C.F.R.  §  84.4(b)(1)(ii);  see  also  45  C.F.R. \n27 \n§84.52(a)(2); \n28 \n \n-61-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 62 of 68   Page ID #:62\n \n1  c)  “[p]rovide a qualified [individual with a disability] with an aid, \n2  benefit, or service that is not as effective as that provided to others,” 28 C.F.R. \n3  § 84.4(b)(1)(iii), (2); see also 45 C.F.R. §84.52(a)(3); \n4  d)  “[p]rovide benefits or services in a manner that limits or has the \n5  effect of limiting the participation of qualified [individuals with disabilities],” \n6  45 C.F.R. §84.52(a)(4); \n7  e)  “[a]id or perpetuate discrimination against a qualified [individual \n8  with  a  disability]  by  providing  significant  assistance  to  an  agency, \n9  organization,  or  person  that  discriminates  on  the  basis  of  [disability]  in \n10  providing any aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries of the [covered entity’s] \n11  program,” 28 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(1)(v); or \n12  f)  “[o]therwise limit a qualified [individual with a disability] in the \n13  enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others \n14  receiving an aid, benefit, or service.” 28 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(1)(vii). \n15  274.  A public entity also may not use criteria or methods of administration \n16  that: \n17  a)  “have  the  effect  of  subjecting  qualified  [individuals  with \n18  disabilities]  to  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  [disability],”  28  C.F.R.  § \n19  84.4(b)(4)(i); \n20  b)  “have  the  purpose  or  effect  of  defeating  or  substantially \n21  impairing  accomplishments  of  the  objectives  of  the  [covered  entity’s] \n22  program or activity with respect to [individuals with disabilities],” 28 C.F.R. \n23  § 84.4(b)(ii); or \n24  c)  “perpetuate the discrimination of another [covered entity] if both \n25  public entities are subject to common administrative control or are agencies \n26  of the same State,” 28 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(iii). \n27 \n28 \n \n-62-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 63 of 68   Page ID #:63\n \n1  275.  Members  of  the  ADA  Subclass  have  physical,  cognitive,  and \n2  psychological  disabilities  that  make  them  qualified  individuals  with  disabilities \n3  under the Rehabilitation Act. 29 U.S.C. § 705(20). \n4  276.  The  Defendants  receive  substantial  federal  funding  to  operate  the \n5  statewide foster care system, and CDSS and CFS’s operations constitute a “program \n6  or activity” under the Rehabilitation Act. 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), (b)(1)(A). \n7  277.  For  all  the  reasons  set  forth  above,  Defendants  have  violated  the \n8  Rehabilitation Act by failing to provide foster children with disabilities an equal \n9  opportunity to participate in foster care services detailed above. \n10  278.  As  a  result  of  Defendants’  past  and  ongoing  violations  of  the \n11  Rehabilitation Act, the ADA Subclass members have suffered injuries, are at risk of \n12  suffering injury, and will continue to be at risk of suffering further injuries unless \n13  Defendants are required to comply with applicable law. \n14  EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nCal. Gov’t Code § 11135 et seq., Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2 § 11140 et seq.–State \n15 \nRight Against Unlawful State Discrimination (On Behalf of the ADA Subclass \n16  Against County Defendants) \n17 \n279.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate each allegation in this Complaint. \n18 \n280.  The  County  Defendants  have  discriminated  against  Plaintiffs  and \n19 \nmembers of the ADA Subclass by failing to make reasonable modifications in their \n20 \npolicies, patterns, practices, or customs that would allow them to participate in and \n21 \nbenefit from the County Defendants’ foster care and health services. \n22 \n281.  Reasonable  modification  of  County  Defendants’  policies,  patterns, \n23 \npractices, or customs would not fundamentally alter the nature of their services, \n24 \nprograms, or activities but would further their stated goals. \n25 \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n26 \nWHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs request that this Honorable Court: \n27 \nI.  Assert jurisdiction over this action. \n28 \n \n-63-   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/23   Page 64 of 68   Page ID #:64\n \n1  II.

County Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ rights under the California \n8  Welfare and Institutions Code;  \n9  c.  Defendants’  violation  of  Plaintiffs’  rights  under  the  Fourteenth \n10  Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; \n11  d.

Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ rights under the First, Ninth, and \n14  Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; \n15  f.  Defendants’ violation of ADA Subclass Plaintiffs’ rights under the \n16  ADA; \n17  g.  Defendants’ violation of ADA Subclass Plaintiffs’ rights under the \n18  Rehabilitation Act; \n19  h.  County Defendants’ violation of ADA Subclass Plaintiffs’ rights under \n20  the California Government Code. \n21  IV.

\n8  d.  requiring the County Defendants to describe, in each child’s written \n9  case plan, steps for reunification with the child’s parents, adoption, or \n10  another permanent, family-like setting;  \n11  e.  requiring the County Defendants to describe, in each child’s written \n12  case  plan,  any  interim  placements  appropriate  for  the  child  before \n13  obtaining a permanent home-like setting; \n14  f.  requiring the County Defendants to describe, in each child’s written \n15  case plan, the steps needed to keep the child safe during the child’s time \n16  in Defendants’ custody; \n17  g.  requiring the County Defendants to ensure that all children whose case \n18  plan identifies a need for services or treatment timely receive those \n19  services or treatment;

\n10  m.  requiring  the  State  Defendants  and  County  Defendants  to  conduct \n11  annual  case  record  reviews  of  a  statistically  significant  sample  of \n12  children in CFS’s custody to measure how likely children in CFS’s \n13  custody are to receive timely permanence under federal law, how often \n14  they are maltreated in care, and how placement stability is maintained \n15  for these children; \n16  n.  requiring the County Defendants to file and proceed with a timely \n17  petition to free a child for adoption when the child’s permanency plan \n18  is adoption unless the child’s case plan documents that doing so is not \n19  in the child’s best interest or that the child has a statutory exemption \n20  from this requirement;

\n8  r.  requiring the County Defendants to provide all necessary services to \n9  each child who enters foster care, including essential services to the \n10  child’s parents to ensure a speedy reunification for as long as the child’s \n11  permanency plan remains reunification;

Factual Allegations1 \n3  A.  The Parties \n4  1.  The Plaintiffs \n5  Plaintiffs Gary G., Xander B., Francesca B., Delilah B., Teddy H., Lori Newels, Kevin E. \n6  and Sam E., Henry P., David O. and Arnold O., and Greg R. (“Plaintiffs”) are foster children ranging \n7  from the ages of 15 months to 15 years and under the custody of Defendant San Bernardino Child \n8  and Family Services (“CFS”). See generally FAC. All are being represented by “next friends” who \n9  are familiar with their history and dedicated to their best interests. Id. \n10  2.  The Defendants \n11  Defendant California Department of Social Services (“CDSS”) is a state agency that has \n12  general oversight of county-run child welfare agencies. FAC ¶ 41. Defendant Kimberley Johnson is \n13  the Director of CDSS (collectively with CDSS, the “CDSS Defendants”). Defendant Gavin Newsom \n14  is the Governor of the State of California. Id. ¶ 40.2 \n15  Defendant San Bernardino County (the “County”) is a local government entity that oversees \n16  and monitors CFS. Id. ¶ 43. Defendant Members of the San Bernardino County Board of \n17  Supervisors (the “Board of Supervisors”) are responsible for overseeing the County’s polices, \n18  practices, and operations, and appointing and supervising the CFS director. Id. ¶ 44. CFS is a County \n19  agency responsible for the safety and welfare of foster children in the County. Id. ¶ 45. Defendant \n20  Jeany Zepeda is the Director of CFS. Id. ¶ 46.3  \n21  B.  The Conduct \n22  The San Bernardino Grand Jury, an “independent civil watchdog agency,” has investigated \n23  CFS and has concluded that it is so “complicated, secretive, and inefficient” that it is “too broken to \n24 \n \n25 \n1 The following factual background is derived from the allegations in Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint, \nECF No. 34 (“FAC”), except where otherwise indicated. For the purposes of this Motion, the Court treats \n26 \nthese factual allegations as true, but at this stage of the litigation, the Court makes no finding on the truth of \nthese allegations, and is therefore not—at this stage—finding that they are true. \n27 \n2 The Court will refer to CDSS, Johnson, and Newsom collectively as the “State Defendants.” \n28 \n3 The Court will refer to the County, the Board of Supervisors, CFS, and Zepeda as the “County Defendants.” \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 3 of 29   Page ID\n#:1887\n \n1  fix” and should be “abolished.” Id. ¶ 60. Other investigations have also revealed abuse of foster \n2  children under CFS’s supervision. Id. ¶ 61.  \n3  CFS fails to adequately vet foster homes or monitor them once foster children are placed, \n4  leaving the foster children at substantial risk of experiencing harm and maltreatment in care. Id. ¶ 66. \n5  Foster children in the County experience high rates of maltreatment in care. Id. ¶ 94. This high rate \n6  of maltreatment is a direct result of CFS’s deficient policies and practices, particularly CFS’s \n7  inadequate vetting and monitoring of foster homes and foster parents. Id. ¶ 98. \n8  CFS is required by law to provide foster children with a detailed, individualized case plan \n9  within certain time periods, and have meetings to collaborate with children and relevant adults in the \n10  case planning. Id. ¶¶ 67–72. CFS’s caseworkers do not complete plans on time or with all required \n11  information, nor do CFS meetings occur on time with all necessary stakeholders. Id. ¶ 73. These \n12  deficiencies in case planning also places foster children at risk of harm. Id. ¶ 78. \n13  CFS is also required by law to place each foster child in the most appropriate and least \n14  restrictive placement that best suits the child’s needs. Id. ¶ 79. However, CFS lacks adequate short-\n15  term emergency placements for children, so when children first enter care, CFS often has no other \n16  placement for them than a local CFS office. Id. ¶ 81. The CFS offices lack essential living elements \n17  and basic safety features such that children are at substantial risk of experiencing maltreatment in \n18  care. Id. ¶¶ 83–85. \n19  To adequately serve foster children, CFS is required to provide adequate and timely health \n20  assessments. Id. ¶ 87. However, there is a lack of timely and adequate assessments. Id. ¶ 93.  \n21  As foster care is intended to be temporary, CFS is required to expeditiously place foster \n22  children in permanent homes. Id. ¶¶ 99–100. However, children in the County spend an average of \n23  551 days in custody, 104 days longer than the national average—and these figures continue to \n24  deteriorate. Id. ¶¶ 101–103. Children in CFS’s custody are about 50% more likely to “age out” in \n25  foster care than others around the country. Id. ¶ 104. \n26  National organizations recommend that caseworkers maintain caseloads of between 12 and \n27  15 children in out-of-home care. Id. ¶ 108. However, CFS permits its caseworkers to carry caseloads \n28  of 70 to 90 children per caseworker. Id. ¶ 109. Such high caseloads prevent caseworkers from \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 4 of 29   Page ID\n#:1888\n \n1  adequately assessing a child’s safety or wellbeing, developing individualized case plans, facilitating \n2  reunification services, placing children appropriately, or deciding when to petition to terminate \n3  parental rights. Id. ¶ 115. \n4  These deficiencies in CFS’s practices and policies disproportionately harm foster children \n5  with disabilities. Id. ¶ 117.  \n6  There exists a lack of oversight by the State Defendants and the other County Defendants. Id. \n7  ¶¶ 124–136. \n8  II.  Procedural History \n9  On May 25, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a class action complaint for injunctive and declarative relief \n10  against Defendants. ECF No. 1 (“Complaint”). On August 14, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the operative \n11  amended complaint. ECF No. 34 (“FAC”). Plaintiffs allege eight causes of action: violations \n12  pursuant to (1) the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act (“AACWA”); (2) California Welfare \n13  and Institutions Code Sections 16501.1, 16503(a), et seq. (against County Defendants only), (3) 42 \n14  U.S.C. Section 1983 (“Section 1983”) based on due process; (4) California Constitution Article I, \n15  Section 7(a) based on due process (against County Defendants only); (5) Section 1983 based on \n16  family association; (6) Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”); (7) Section 504 of \n17  the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“RA”)); and (8) California Government Code Section 11135, et seq. \n18  (against County Defendants only). See generally FAC.  \n19  On October 9, 2023, the CDSS Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss. ECF No. 42 (“CDSS \n20  Motion”). On the same day, Newsom also filed a Motion to Dismiss. ECF No. 43 (“Newsom \n21  Motion”). On December 7, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their opposition to the State Defendants’ Motions. \n22  ECF No. 56 (“State Opp.”). On January 16, 2024, the State Defendants filed their replies. ECF No. \n23  58 (“CDSS Reply”); ECF No. 59 (“Newsom Reply”). \n24  On October 9, 2023, the County Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss for lack of subject \n25  matter jurisdiction. ECF No. 44 (“SMJ Motion”). On December 7, 2023, Plaintiffs filed an \n26  opposition. ECF No. 53 (“SMJ Opp.”). On January 16, 2024, the County Defendants filed their \n27  reply. ECF No. 60 (“SMJ Reply”). \n28 \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 5 of 29   Page ID\n#:1889\n \n1  On October 9, 2023, the County filed a Motion to Dismiss, to which the remaining County \n2  Defendants joined in its entirety. ECF No. 45 (the “County Motion”); ECF No. 46 (“Joinder”). The \n3  County Motion also included a Request for Judicial Notice. ECF No. 45-2 (“RJN”). The remaining \n4  County Defendants (CFS, the Board of Supervisors, and Zepeda) filed a separate Motion to Dismiss. \n5  ECF No. 47 (“CFS Motion”). On December 7, 2023, Plaintiffs filed an opposition to both the \n6  County Motion and the CFS Motion. ECF No. 55 (“County Opp.”). On January 16, 2024, the \n7  County Defendants filed their replies. ECF No. 61 (“County Reply”); ECF No. 62 (“CFS Reply”). \n8  COUNTY DEFENDANTS’ SMJ MOTION TO DISMISS (ECF NO. 44) \n9  I.  Applicable Law \n10  “Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,” and can only hear cases where there is a \n11  valid basis for federal jurisdiction. Richardson v. United States, 943 F.2d 1107, 1112 (9th Cir. 1991). \n12  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) authorizes a party to seek dismissal of an action for lack of \n13  subject-matter jurisdiction or standing. “The jurisdiction of federal courts is defined and limited by \n14  Article III of the Constitution.” Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 94 (1968). Under Article III, federal \n15  courts “may act only in the context of a justiciable case or controversy.” Sec. & Exch. Comm’n v. \n16  Med. Comm. for Hum. Rts., 404 U.S. 403, 407 (1972). This requirement of a case or controversy \n17  “limit[s] the business of federal courts to questions presented in an adversary context and in a form \n18  historically viewed as capable of resolution through the judicial process.” Flast, 392 U.S. at 95 \n19  (1968). The plaintiff bears the burden of proving jurisdiction. DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 \n20  U.S. 332, 342 at n.3 (2006). \n21  II.  Discussion \n22  For the reasons discussed below, the Court finds that this case is properly before it. \n23  Accordingly, the Court DENIES the SMJ Motion.  \n24   \n25   \n26   \n27  / / / \n28  / / / \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 6 of 29   Page ID\n#:1890\n \n1  A.  Plaintiffs have standing to bring their claims before this Court. \n2  The County Defendants first contend that this case lacks standing because Plaintiffs’ claims \n3  are not redressable by relief from this Court.4 SMJ Motion at 11. In particular, the County \n4  Defendants characterize Plaintiffs’ claims as “generalized grievances” about the County’s foster care \n5  system, and argue that the relief sought would violate the principles of federalism. Id. at 12. \n6  However, at this stage, the Court finds both that the remedies sought by Plaintiffs sufficiently relate \n7  to the injuries alleged, and do not necessarily rise to the level of broad injunctive relief that is \n8  beyond this Court’s power to issue.  \n9  To establish redressability, “a plaintiff must show that it is ‘likely, as opposed to merely \n10  speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.” M.S., 902 F.3d at 1083. “A \n11  plaintiff’s burden to demonstrate redressability is ‘relatively modest.’” Id. Here, Plaintiffs have \n12  alleged numerous concrete injuries that arise from Defendants’ conduct, which the Court finds likely \n13  to be addressed by the relief sought. For example, Plaintiffs allege harm stemming from inadequate \n14  placement and monitoring, inadequate case planning, and inadequate provision of medical services. \n15  See, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 142 (alleging difficulty by Gary G. to obtain necessary health services), 174 \n16  (alleging that Xander B. is still not receiving certain medication), 180 (failure to adequately monitor \n17  placements or engage in case planning for Teddy H.), 211 (placement of David O. into a foster home \n18  that was not properly vetted). And, these harms would likely be remedied if CFS had enough \n19  caseworkers to adequately place and monitor children, conduct case planning, and ensure provision \n20  of medical services. The Court finds this sufficient to show standing at the pleadings stage. See \n21  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992) (“At the pleading stage, general factual \n22  allegations of injury resulting from the defendant’s conduct may suffice . . .”).5 \n23 \n \n24 \n4 To establish standing, a plaintiff must show that he “(1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable \nto the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial \n25 \ndecision.” M.S. v. Brown, 902 F.3d 1076, 1083 (9th Cir. 2018).  \n26  5 At the hearing, the County Defendants emphasized the points raised in their briefing that a plaintiff must \nestablish standing on a claim-by-claim basis. See SMJ Reply at 3. However, it is the County Defendants who \n27  are characterizing Plaintiffs’ claims as “broad and generalized grievances” that a federal court cannot redress. \nSMJ Motion at 12. As just listed by the Court, Plaintiffs have alleged specific injuries, and Defendants have \n28 \n \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 7 of 29   Page ID\n#:1891\n \n1  The thrust of the County Defendants’ arguments though, are directed towards whether this \n2  Court would have the power to issue the remedies sought. The County Defendants point to cases \n3  where the Supreme Court rejected a federal court’s interference with local government. For example, \n4  they cite Rizzo v. Goode, where the Supreme Court found problematic a district court’s injunctive \n5  order that “significantly revis[ed] the internal procedures of the Philadelphia police department.” 423 \n6  U.S. 362, 379 (1976). They also point to Lewis v. Casey, where the district court adopted a 25-page \n7  injunctive order that “mandated sweeping changes” to the Arizona prison system in “minute detail” \n8  that was not tailored to the inadequacies identified in the underlying litigation. 518 U.S. 343, 347 \n9  (1996) (noting that the two identified “instances were a patently inadequate basis for a conclusion of \n10  systemwide violation and imposition of systemwide relief”). However, no Supreme Court case cited \n11  affirmatively states that a district court cannot, as a matter of law, grant injunctive relief against a \n12  state or local defendant. The cases merely emphasize that appropriate consideration should be given \n13  to the “federal-state relationships underlying” the case.” Rizzo, 423 U.S. at 380. The County \n14  Defendants have not affirmatively shown that the Court lacks the power to issue the relief sought.  \n15  Moreover, it is not clear that Plaintiffs inappropriately seek to micromanage CFS’s internal \n16  procedures in a way that is not already mandated by applicable state and federal laws. For example, \n17  one form of relief sought by Plaintiffs is to ensure that all foster children receive an adequate written \n18  case plan within 60 days of entering care. FAC at 65. But, this is already mandated by California \n19  statute. Id. ¶ 50; see also Cal. Welf. & Ins. Code § 16501(a)(2) (“The case plan shall be developed \n20  within a maximum of 60 days of the initial removal of the child . . .”).  \n21  The County Defendants rely on Juliana, where plaintiffs sought to enjoin the government \n22  from activities that would promote the use of fossil fuels. Juliana v. U.S., 947 F.3d 1159 (9th Cir. \n23  2020). Juliana is distinguishable in multiple ways. First, the case was at the summary judgment \n24 \n \n25 \nnot shown that these injuries could not be remedied by the various forms of relief sought. At the motion to \ndismiss stage, the Court draws all inferences in favor of Plaintiffs and finds that Plaintiffs’ injuries could \n26 \npotentially be redressed by the relief they are seeking. See Oregon v. Legal Services Corp., 552 F.3d 965, 969 \n(9th Cir. 2009) (“Plaintiff bears the burden of proof to establish standing ‘with the manner and degree of \n27 \nevidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.’”). To the extent that further evidence develops in \nthis case showing Plaintiffs’ injuries are unrelated to or would not be redressed by the twenty-plus specific \n28 \nremedies Plaintiffs seek (see FAC at Prayer for Relief), the County Defendants may re-raise this issue. \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 8 of 29   Page ID\n#:1892\n \n1  stage, where the plaintiffs had “compiled an extensive record.” Id. at 1166. Moreover, as part of this \n2  record, the plaintiffs’ own experts had opined that such an injunction would not “suffice to stop \n3  catastrophic climate change or even ameliorate [the plaintiffs’] injuries.” Id. at 1170. Here, Plaintiffs \n4  have identified a host of relief sought that would appear to redress the injuries alleged in their eight \n5  causes of action. See Compl. at Prayer for Relief. Although the County Defendants emphasize that \n6  Plaintiffs appear to be seeking reform of the foster system as a whole, this is not mutually exclusive \n7  to relief sought to redress Plaintiffs’ own alleged harms.  \n8  The requested relief also does not appear to seek to interfere with the funding of the foster \n9  care system directly. Cf. Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, 455 (2009) (taking issue with requiring a \n10  state to take action through “a particular funding mechanism”). To the extent that Plaintiffs are \n11  claiming that CFS fails to meet applicable constitutional standards, the Court does not find that an \n12  order seeking to enforce them to do so would be inappropriate as a matter of law. See Melendres v. \n13  Maricopa County, 897 F.3d 1217, 1219 (9th Cir.) (affirming district court injunction that ordered a \n14  county’s sheriff’s office to take various remedial measures); see also M.D. by Stukenberg v. Abbott, \n15  907 F.3d 237 (5th Cir. 2018) (affirming certain injunctive provisions related to caseload \n16  management and monitoring and oversight of violations within foster care system).  \n17  The County Defendants cite numerous times to Connor B., an out-of-state district case to \n18  support their argument that the relief sought here is “rightfully the province of the legislature.” \n19  Connor B. ex rel. Vigurs v. Patrick, 985 F. Supp. 2d 129, 157 (D. Mass. 2013). But, they ignore that \n20  the case in Connor B. proceeded to a bench trial, and that the court recognized its role “to adjudicate \n21  the claims before it,” regardless of the concerns of imposing institutional reform through injunctive \n22  or declaratory relief. Id. At the hearing, the County Defendants emphasized one concern the Connor \n23  B. court raised—that any relief sought would require resources (or the reallocation thereof) that \n24  Defendants simply do not have. But, at this stage, the Court cannot presume this to be the truth, and \n25  that such relief may be costly is not a reason to find lack of standing. See Watson v. City of Memphis, \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 9 of 29   Page ID\n#:1893\n \n1  373 U.S. 526, 537 (1963) (noting that “it is obvious that vindication of conceded constitutional rights \n2  cannot be made dependent up on any theory that it is less expensive to deny than to afford them”).6  \n3  While the Court acknowledges the concerns with overreaching injunctive relief, the County \n4  Defendants have not identified any specific provisions of relief sought by Plaintiffs that would \n5  provide a proper basis for dismissal of the whole complaint at this stage. See Melendres v. Maricopa \n6  County, 897 F.3d 1217, 1222 (9th Cir. 2018) (rejecting that an injunction violated federalism \n7  principles where the defendant failed to articulate why any provisions were overbroad). Given that \n8  the Court finds that the allegations sufficiently identify redressable injuries, the Court finds that the \n9  FAC adequately pleads standing for Plaintiffs to bring their claims. Accordingly, the Court DENIES \n10  the SMJ Motion on this basis. \n11  B.  The Younger abstention doctrine does not apply.   \n12  The County Defendants argue that because Plaintiffs have ongoing juvenile court actions, \n13  this Court must abstain from adjudicating this case. SMJ Motion at 17. The Younger abstention \n14  doctrine requires federal courts to abstain from certain cases “under the principles of federalism.” \n15  Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 481 U.S. 1, 10 (1987); see also Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971). \n16  Federal courts should not enjoin state criminal prosecutions and should not intervene in civil state \n17  court proceedings “if the State’s interests in the proceeding are so important that exercise of the \n18  federal judicial power would disregard the comity between the States and the National Government.” \n19  Pennzoil Co., 481 U.S. at 11. Abstention is appropriate when four requirements are met: (1) “there is \n20  an ongoing state judicial proceeding;” (2) “those proceedings implicate important state interests; (3) \n21  “there is an adequate opportunity in the state proceedings to raise constitutional challenges;” and (4) \n22  the “requested relief must seek to enjoin—or have the practical effect of enjoining—ongoing state \n23   \n24  6 At the hearing, counsel for the County Defendants described Connor B. as a “cautionary tale,” arguing that \nin the case, the court “realize[d] in hindsight there was nothing it could actually do via a federal injunction to \n25 \nbring about the kind of reform that Article III allows.” ECF No. 72 at 7:7-14. But, that is not what happened \nin the case. Rather, the court in Connor B. did not reach the question of what remedy was appropriate because \n26 \nit found that the plaintiffs there had not substantively proven their claims. See Connor B. ex rel. Vigurs v. \nPatrick, 774 F.3d 45, 48 (1st Cir. 2014) (noting that the plaintiffs had “not established, based on the facts, that \n27 \nthere have been constitutional violations as to the class of foster children, so they are not entitled to an \ninjunction or federal court oversight”). That Plaintiffs may or may not be able to ultimately prove their claims \n28 \nis not a basis to deny them the ability to pursue their claims now.  \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 10 of 29   Page\nID #:1894\n \n1  proceedings.” ReadyLink Healthcare, Inc. v. State Comp. Ins. Fund, 754 F.3d 754, 758 (9th Cir. \n2  2014); see also Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass’n., 457 U.S. 423 (1982).  \n3  The Supreme Court has since reaffirmed the scope of Younger abstention and the three \n4  “exceptional circumstances” that “justify a federal court’s refusal to decide a case in deference” to a \n5  state: (1) ongoing state criminal prosecutions, (2) civil enforcement proceedings, and (3) pending \n6  civil proceedings involving certain orders “uniquely in furtherance of the state courts’ ability to \n7  perform their judicial functions.” Sprint Communications, Inc. v. Jacobs, 571 U.S. 69, 78 (2013). As \n8  the Supreme Court reminded in Sprint, “abstention from the exercise of federal jurisdiction is the \n9  ‘exception, not the rule.’” Id. at 82. “The pendency of an action in a state court is no bar to \n10  proceedings concerning the same matter in the Federal court having jurisdiction.” Id. at 73. The \n11  Court finds that Plaintiffs’ dependency proceedings do not fall under the category of exceptional \n12  circumstances to which Younger abstention applies, and therefore not need to reach the Middlesex \n13  factors. Id. at 82 (affirming that “Younger extends to the ‘three exceptional circumstances’” but no \n14  further and that the Middlesex factors are not “dispositive” but rather “additional factors \n15  appropriately considered [] before invoking Younger”).  \n16  Here, the County Defendants appear to argue that the Plaintiffs’ dependency proceedings fall \n17  into the second category of civil enforcement actions which are “quasi-criminal” in nature. Reply at \n18  6.7 But, the term “quasi-criminal” as used in Sprint makes clear that the proceedings at issue here are \n19  not. In particular, the Supreme Court noted that the proceeding in Middlesex, a case where the \n20  Supreme Court did find abstention appropriate, was “akin to a criminal proceeding.” Sprint, 571 \n21  U.S. at 81; see also Middlesex, 457 U.S. at 432 (abstention is appropriate where “noncriminal \n22  proceedings bear a close relationship to proceedings criminal in nature”). The “purpose of the \n23  hearing was to determine whether the lawyer should be disciplined”—thus, the Middlesex \n24  proceeding was found to be “quasi-criminal” in nature. Id. There is no dispute that Plaintiffs’ \n25  dependency proceedings are not punitive nor criminal, but rather are proceedings for their benefit \n26 \n \n27 \n7 It does not appear in dispute that the proceedings at issue fall into the first or third categories. See New \nOrleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council of City of New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 368 (1989) (citing as examples \n28 \nfor the third category as a civil contempt order and the requirement for the posting of bond pending appeal).  \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 11 of 29   Page\nID #:1895\n \n1  and protection. Therefore, the Court does not find that their cases appropriately fall under the quasi-\n2  criminal category that Younger abstention apply to. \n3  The County Defendants rely on Moore v. Sims—a case decided well before Sprint—where \n4  the Supreme Court found that a state proceeding involving the “temporary removal of a child in a \n5  child-abuse context” was subject to abstention. 442 U.S. 415, 423 (1979). But the basis for \n6  abstention in Moore was that the proceedings involved the state’s initial and temporary removal of \n7  the child, which was determined to be a quasi-criminal proceeding. The Supreme Court explained \n8  that “the temporary removal of a child in a child-abuse context is, like the public nuisance statute \n9  involved in [another case], ‘in aid of and closely related to criminal statutes.’” Id. at 423. The \n10  Supreme Court did not so hold regarding ongoing dependency proceedings. Here, even if the \n11  Plaintiffs’ dependency proceedings were initiated similarly,8 the posture of Plaintiffs’ dependency \n12  proceedings now are markedly different—the issues Plaintiffs raise are not with the initial removal, \n13  they are with the eventual case planning, review and approval of placements, and delivery of \n14  services for the whole period that they are in the State’s custody. See FAC. The County Defendants \n15  argue that the removal proceedings and the following dependency proceedings are one and the same, \n16  as they “are governed by a single, unitary statutory scheme.” Reply at 8. However, this Court must \n17  follow the analysis dictated by Sprint and ask whether the nature of the proceeding was “initiated to \n18  sanction the federal plaintiff [] for some wrongful act,” not merely ask what statutory scheme the \n19  proceeding falls under. Sprint, 571 U.S. at 79. This makes sense, as in the context of a removal \n20  proceeding, the State can be construed as “enforcing” certain laws against parents. In contrast, the \n21  State is not similarly engaged in enforcement in ongoing dependency proceedings such that it would \n22  make sense for these to fall into the second category of civil enforcement proceedings. \n23  The Ninth Circuit has not spoken to the issue of whether Younger abstention applies in the \n24  context of ongoing dependency proceedings (as opposed to the removal proceeding), but the Court \n25  notes that other circuits have taken diverging approaches. Compare Ashley W. v. Holcomb, 34 F.4th \n26 \n \n27 \n8 The Court notes that the specific status and circumstance of each named Plaintiffs’ dependency proceeding \nis not clear from the record, but it appears undisputed that the dependency proceedings at issue were initiated \n28 \nby the state to bring them into state custody. See SMJ Opp. at 3; SMJ Reply at 8.  \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 12 of 29   Page\nID #:1896\n \n1  588 (7th Cir. 2022) with Jonathan R. by Dixon v. Justice, 41 F.4th 316 (4th Cir. 2022).9 The Court \n2  finds the reasoning of the Fourth Circuit in Jonathan R. persuasive. Jonathan R., 41 F.4th at 320–21. \n3  There, the Fourth Circuit dealt with a similar case brought by a class of foster children that \n4  challenged the state’s administration of child welfare services, and found that “principles of \n5  federalism not only do not preclude federal intervention, they compel it.” Id. In particular, the Fourth \n6  Circuit held that the periodic dependency hearings did not “require the district court to stand aside” \n7  because the “ongoing individual hearings [] serve to protect the children who would be plaintiffs in \n8  federal court,” as opposed to the initial removal in Moore which was focused on taking away \n9  parental rights from purportedly abusive parents in an enforcement-like proceeding. Id. at 329–30. \n10  This aligns with the scope of Younger abstention as set forth by the Supreme Court in Sprint. See \n11  Sprint, 571 U.S. at 73 (“We have cautioned, however, that federal courts should entertain and \n12  resolve on the merits an action within the scope of a jurisdictional grant, and should not ‘refuse to \n13  decide a case in deference to the States.’”).  \n14  Accordingly, the Court does not find that abstention applies in this case and DENIES the \n15  SMJ Motion on this basis.  \n16  / / / \n17  / / / \n18 \n \n19 \n9 The Seventh Circuit did not discuss the applicability of Younger at great length, focusing primarily on the \n20 \ninadequacy of the district court’s reasons for failing to apply Younger. Ashley W., 34 F.4th at 593. It did not \naddress this question of initial removal versus ongoing dependency proceedings, stating that Younger “applies \n21 \nto state-initiated child-welfare litigation” due to the holding in Moore, as well as two prior Seventh Circuit \ncases. Id. at 592. However, these two cases were about child custody, not about the proceedings that happen \n22 \nafter a child is already in state custody. See Brunken v. Lance, 807 F.2d 1325 (7th Cir. 1986); Milchtein v. \nChisholm, 880 F.3d 895, 898 (7th Cir. 2018). Moreover, in Brunken, the Seventh Circuit’s determination that \n23 \nYounger applied focused specifically on the state’s “strong interest in the health and welfare of the child” \n(Brunken, 807 F.2d at 1330)—but Sprint, which was decided after Brunken, has clarified that the state interest \n24 \nfactor is not reached if the proceeding itself does not fall into one of the three categories identified in Sprint.  \n25 \nThe Court further notes that both the Tenth and Eleventh Circuit cases cited by the County Defendants that \napplied Younger abstention in similar situations were decided prior to Sprint, and relied on a pure application \n26 \nof the Middlesex factors. See 31 Foster Children v. Bush, 329 F.3d 1255, 1274 (11th Cir. 2003); Joseph A. ex \nrel. Corrine Wolfe v. Ingram, 275 F.3d 1253, 1267 (10th Cir. 2002). Moreover, the Eighth Circuit cases cited \n27 \nby the County Defendants were in the context of removal proceedings similar to Moore. Oglala Sioux Tribe v. \nFleming, 904 F.3d 603, 610 (8th Cir. 2018) (plaintiffs were challenging “procedures used in proceedings \n28 \nbrought by the State to remove children temporarily from their homes in exigent circumstances”).  \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 13 of 29   Page\nID #:1897\n \n1  C.  The Rooker–Feldman doctrine does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction.  \n2  Finally, the County Defendants argue that Rooker–Feldman doctrine deprives the Court of \n3  jurisdiction. “Under Rooker–Feldman, a federal district court does not have subject matter \n4  jurisdiction to hear a direct appeal from the final judgment of a state court.” Noel v. Hall, 341 F.3d \n5  1148, 1154 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing Rooker v. Fid. Tr. Co., 263 U.S. 413 (1923); D.C. Ct. of Appeals \n6  v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462 (1983)). This applies to not just actual appeals of state court judgments, \n7  but also to the “de facto equivalent” of appeals of such judgment, “when a losing plaintiff in state \n8  court brings a suit in federal district court asserting as legal wrongs the allegedly erroneous legal \n9  rulings of the state court and seeks to vacate or set aside the judgment of that court.” Id. at 1155–56.  \n10  Here, neither the FAC nor the County Defendants identify any specific judgment from a \n11  juvenile proceeding that has been challenged. Although the County Defendants argue that juvenile \n12  courts have already made certain determinations as to Plaintiffs’ cases, it is not clear that these \n13  determinations align with Plaintiffs’ particular allegations here. Nowhere in the FAC do Plaintiffs \n14  state that any of their circumstances that they now complain of arose out of a court order. The Court \n15  also does not interpret Plaintiffs to be seeking review of the juvenile courts’ determinations, whether \n16  related to case plans or otherwise. Plaintiffs’ quarrels are not with the juvenile courts, but with the \n17  agency’s ability to provide the required resources and services to foster children under its care. \n18  Therefore, the Court does not find that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine is a bar to jurisdiction here. \n19  Accordingly, the Court DENIES the SMJ Motion on this basis. \n20  COUNTY’S REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE (ECF NO. 45-2) \n21  I.

Discussion \n13  For the reasons discussed below, the Court DENIES the County Motion and GRANTS the \n14  CFS Motion WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. \n15  A.  Plaintiffs Sufficiently Allege Municipal Liability. \n16  The County first moves on Plaintiffs three Section 1983 claims (First, Third, and Fifth \n17  Causes of Action), arguing that Plaintiffs fail to meet the standard for municipal liability. County \n18  Motion at 12. To assert a Section 1983 claim against a municipality, a plaintiff must plead that (1) he \n19  was deprived of a constitutional right, (2) the defendant had a policy or custom, (3) the policy or \n20  custom amounted to deliberate indifference to the plaintiff’s constitutional right, and (4) the policy \n21  or custom was the moving force behind the constitutional violation. Mabe v. San Bernardino \n22  County, 237 F.3d 1101, 1110–11 (9th Cir. 2001).  \n23  1.  Plaintiffs sufficiently allege a violation of their rights. \n24  The Court analyzes whether the FAC alleges a violation of Plaintiffs’ rights under the three \n25  causes of action at issue. \n26  a.  AACWA \n27  To enforce federal statutes under Section 1983, a plaintiff “must assert a violation of a \n28  federal right, not merely a violation of federal law.” Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340 \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 16 of 29   Page\nID #:1900\n \n1  (1997). There are three factors courts consider to determine when a statutory provision gives rise to a \n2  federal right: (1) Congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff, (2) \n3  the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by the statute is not so ‘vague and \n4  amorphous’ that its enforcement would strain judicial competence, and (3) the statute must impose a \n5  mandatory obligation on the state. Id. Meeting the Blessing factors creates a presumption that the \n6  right is enforceable, which can be rebutted if the defendant shows that Congress explicitly or \n7  impliedly “create[ed] a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual \n8  enforcement under § 1983.” Id. at 341. \n9  The FAC identifies seven different rights that Plaintiffs allege they have been deprived of by \n10  Defendants under the AACWA, which the Court categorizes into four categories: (1) right to a \n11  certain standard of placement, (2) access to quality services to protect safety and health, (3) right to \n12  case plans and case review system, and (4) right to have a petition to terminate parental rights in \n13  certain conditions. FAC ¶ 237. The County only takes issue with the second and third categories. See \n14  County Motion at 13.11  \n15  As to this third category, the Ninth Circuit has affirmatively held that “case plan provisions \n16  are enforceable through § 1983,” in addition to provisions related to providing a case review system. \n17  Henry A. v. Willden, 678 F.3d 991, 1006 (9th Cir. 2012).12 The County argues that Plaintiffs \n18  themselves have not sufficiently alleged that their case plans are inadequate, because half the \n19  Plaintiffs admit they have a case plan, and the others do not mention case plans at all. County \n20  Motion at 13. However, drawing all inferences in favor of Plaintiffs, the allegations support that the \n21 \n22 \n23 \n \n24 \n11 On reply, the County argues that it did not address any others because case plans are the only “cognizable” \n25  AACWA right pleaded. County Reply at 2. It is unclear whether the County means cognizable under the law \nor under the facts pleaded by Plaintiffs. Regardless, as the County could have raised this issue in its moving \n26  papers, the Court declines to reach issues first raised on reply. \n12 The CDSS Defendants make the argument that the rights to case plans held by the Ninth Circuit in Henry A. \n27 \nwere limited to the textual nature of Section 671(a)(16). CDSS Reply at 9. However, the Ninth Circuit clearly \nalso included the language of Section 675(1) in its contemplation of what case plan provisions are \n28 \nenforceable. Henry A., 678 F.3d at 1006. \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 17 of 29   Page\nID #:1901\n \n1  case plans are inadequate. FAC ¶ 221 (alleging that Plaintiffs are being kept “in unsuitable homes \n2  without providing adequate case planning”).13 The Court finds this sufficient. \n3  As to the second category, the County relies on non-binding authority that there is no private \n4  right of action under 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(22). See Clark K. v. Guinn, 2007 WL 1435428, at *10 (D. \n5  Nev. May 14, 2007). But, even assuming there is no private right of action, this does not mean that \n6  the provision cannot create a federal right for purposes of Section 1983.14 Blessing, 520 U.S. at 346–\n7  48 (leaving “open the possibility that Title IV-D may give rise to some individually enforceable \n8  rights,” even though the statute “contains no private remedy—either judicial or administrative—\n9  through which aggrieved persons can seek redress”).  \n10  Nevertheless, the Court finds that the Blessing factors do not support a finding of an \n11  enforceable right to access certain types of services as to Section 671(a)(22). In determining that the \n12  provision of case provision plans met the Blessing test, the Ninth Circuit emphasized that the \n13  statutory language references “each child,” focusing it “squarely on the protected individual, rather \n14  than an aggregate interest or a regulated entity.” Henry A., 678 F.3d at 1007. Here, Section \n15  671(a)(22), which is part of the same statute, does not contain such language. 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(22) \n16  (states shall ensure “that children in foster care placements” are provided services “that protect the \n17  safety and health of children”). Moreover, the Ninth Circuit found that the second factor of the \n18  Blessing test was met because the definitions provided in the statute described “exactly what a case \n19  plan must include,” so there is no ambiguity for what a state need do. Henry A., 678 F.3d at 1007. \n20  Here, the only unambiguous thing that the provision sets forth is that the state “shall develop and \n21 \n \n22 \n13 This allegation is supported by other specific, factual allegations that Plaintiffs have not seen their case \nplans, that their caseworkers did not hold required planning meetings, and that Plaintiffs have had multiple \n23 \nfailed placements. See FAC ¶¶ 144, 152–175, 180, 183, 188, 192–205, 206–207, 209. \n24  14 Plaintiffs also rely on non-binding authority where a federal right from Section 671(a)(22) was found after \napplying the Blessing factors. Kenny A. ex rel. Winn v. Perdue, 218 F.R.D. 277, 294 (N.D. Ga. 2003). \n25 \nOn reply, the County states that Kenny A. is “bad law” because another district court criticized the Kenny A. \n26  court’s analysis of a different section of the opinion. County Reply at 4 (citing Melvin H. v. Atlanta Indep. \nSch. Dist., 2008 WL 11342510, at *19 (N.D. Ga July 10, 2008). The County appears to be conflating the \n27  standard for finding a federal right with the standard that creates a private right of action. \nAs discussed in Blessing, the determination of whether a statute creates a private right of action is distinct \n28 \nfrom the determination of whether it creates a federal right for purposes of Section 1983. \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 18 of 29   Page\nID #:1902\n \n1  implement standards to ensure that children . . . are provided quality services.” 42 U.S.C. § \n2  671(a)(22) (emphasis added). But, Plaintiffs’ alleged right is the right to access quality services. This \n3  is not aligned with any right actually provided by the provision itself.  \n4  Accordingly, while the Court finds the FAC sufficiently pleads a violation of enforceable \n5  rights under the AACWA as to the case plan provisions, the Court does not find an enforceable right \n6  as to access to quality services.  \n7  b.  Substantive Due Process \n8  Once a state takes a child into its custody, “the state owes the child, as part of that person’s \n9  protected liberty interest, reasonable safety and minimally adequate care and treatment appropriate \n10  to the age and circumstance of the child.” Lipscomb By and Through DeFehr v. Simmons, 962 F.2d \n11  1374, 1379 (9th Cir. 1992). The County argues that the seven rights that Plaintiffs identify under this \n12  cause of action are not cognizable rights. County Motion at 14.15 First, the County argues that “risk \n13  of maltreatment” cannot give standing. Id. But, the Court finds that the risk of maltreatment is \n14  properly pleaded as a violation of the right to reasonable safety, which is a cognizable right. \n15  Moreover, Plaintiffs do allege that they are currently being mistreated or face imminent risk of \n16  mistreatment. See, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 175 (alleging that Francesca and Delilah B. “require substantial \n17  ongoing services, which they are not receiving”), 205 (alleging lack of caseworker visits and \n18  inadequate planning as to Henry P. exposes him “to a substantial risk of harm”). The County cites no \n19  binding authority that the harms alleged by Plaintiffs, as a matter of law, are insufficient to be \n20  construed as violations of their due process interests in reasonable safety and minimally adequate \n21  care and treatment.  \n22 \n23   \n24  15 The alleged rights are as follows: (1) the right to freedom from the foreseeable risk of maltreatment while \nunder the protective supervision of the State; (2) the right to protection from unnecessary intrusions into the \n25 \nchild’s emotional wellbeing once the State has established a special relationship with that child; (3) the right \nto services necessary to prevent unreasonable risk of harm in the least restrictive environment; (4) the right to \n26 \nconditions and duration of foster care reasonably related to the purpose and assumption of government \ncustody; (5) the right to treatment and care consistent with the purpose and assumptions of government \n27 \ncustody; (6) the right not to be maintained in custody longer than is necessary to accomplish the purpose to be \nserved by taking a child into government custody; and (7) the right to receive or be reunited with an \n28 \nappropriate permanent home and family within a reasonable period. FAC ¶ 246. \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 19 of 29   Page\nID #:1903\n \n1  The County Defendants similarly cite various non-binding cases for the proposition that the \n2  Fourteenth Amendment does not provide Plaintiffs with the remaining rights alleged, but \n3  mischaracterize the rights Plaintiffs are actually claiming. Even these cited cases acknowledge that \n4  some form of these rights may exist for children under a state’s custody. See M.D. by Stukenberg, \n5  907 F.3d at 250 (noting that the Fifth Circuit has held that children enjoy “a right to personal \n6  security and reasonably safe living conditions,” and that while the “precise contours” of these rights \n7  “have yet to be fleshed-out at length, it is clear that foster children are, at minimum, entitled to \n8  protection from physical abuse and violations of bodily integrity”). While the Fifth Circuit held that \n9  children do not have a right to be free from “any and all psychological harm,” or to “receive optimal \n10  treatment and services,” Plaintiffs do not claim such rights. See FAC ¶ 246 (alleging that Plaintiffs \n11  are due protection from “unnecessary intrusions” into a child’s emotional wellbeing and the right to \n12  “services necessary to prevent unreasonable risk of harm”) (emphasis added).  \n13  As to the claimed rights to the duration of foster care and custody, as well as the right to \n14  reunification, the County Defendants cite a few district cases that solely cite each other, and the \n15  proposition appears to arise ultimately from dicta that does not actually contradict the existence of \n16  Plaintiffs’ asserted rights.16 Similarly, the case cited by the County Defendants does not actually \n17  contradict Plaintiffs’ claimed right to treatment and care consistent with the purpose of custody. See \n18  DeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty. Dep.’t of Soc. Servs., 812 F.2d 298, 304 (7th Cir. 1987). On the other \n19  hand, Plaintiffs have cited a number of non-binding cases from which courts have recognized similar \n20  rights. Opposition at 9–10. The Court does not find it necessary at this stage to determine the \n21  existence of every specific right alleged, given that it finds Plaintiffs to have adequately pleaded the \n22 \n23 \n \n24 \n16 Wyatt B. by McAllister v. Brown, 2021 WL 4434011, at *9 (D. Or. Sept. 27, 2021) cites Clark K. v. Guinn, \n25 \n2007 WL 1435428, at *15 (D. Nev. May 14, 2007) and Charlie H. v. Whitman, 83 F. Supp. 2d 476 (D.N.J. \n2000). Clark K. cites Charlie H. and Baby Neal v. Casey, 821 F. Supp. 320, 335 (E.D. Penn. 1993). Charlie \n26 \nH. cites to Baby Neal for the proposition that a child does not have right to “remain in state custody \nunnecessarily.” Charlie H., 83 F. Supp. 2d at 507. However, Baby Neal actually only states in dicta that a \n27 \nchild’s “constitutional right to be free from harm while in foster care does not entitle them to the right to \npermanent placements or placement in preadoptive homes.” Baby Neal, 821 F. Supp. 320 at 335. But, this \n28 \nstrays from the actual rights claimed by Plaintiffs in this case. \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 20 of 29   Page\nID #:1904\n1  existence of at least one substantive due process right that they allege to be violated to support this \n2  cause of action.  \n3  Accordingly, drawing all inferences in favor of the Plaintiffs, the Court finds that the \n4  allegations are sufficient to allege a violation of Plaintiffs’ due process rights.   \n5  c. Familial Association\n6  Plaintiffs allege that the First Amendment provides a “right of association and right to a \n7  permanent family,” which, combined with “the Ninth Amendment’s reservation of rights to the \n8  people, and the Fourteenth Amendment’s right to due process,” creates an “affirmative duty” on \n9  states “to provide reasonable efforts to obtain a permanent home and family.” FAC ¶ 254. Plaintiffs \n10  appear to interpret this statement from Stanley v. Illinois, where the Supreme Court stated that “[t]he \n11  integrity of the family unit has found protection” in these three amendments.17 405 U.S. 645, 651 \n12  (1972). However, Stanley discusses “the rights to conceive and raise one’s children” and “the \n13  integrity of the family unit.” Id. The Court does not find that the constitutional rights to family \n14  association creates a duty for the government to help people create a family. Nevertheless, the \n15  County does not dispute that there can be a violation of the right to familial association “where a \n16  state actor unlawfully interferes with the parent-child relationship.” County Motion at 16; Grae-El v. \n17  City of Seattle, 2022 WL 16758473, at *5 (W.D. Wa. Nov. 8, 2022), citing Keates v. Koile, 883 F.3d \n18  1228, 1238 (9th Cir. 2018). Plaintiffs point to allegations that visitation with their parents have been \n19  improperly denied. FAC ¶ 179 (alleging that because of CFS’s actions, Teddy H. lost contact with \n20  his stepmother, who was his primary caregiver), 202 (alleging that despite visitation requests since \n21  September 2022, CFS did not approve one until March 2023, and has still not scheduled the visit). \n22  Drawing all inferences in favor of Plaintiffs, the Court finds the allegations sufficient to plead a \n23  violation of the right to familial association.18   \n24 \n25 \n26 \n17 See County Opp. at 11. \n27 \n18 The parties dispute whether the right extends to siblings. Neither party cites binding authority on the issue, \nand the Court does not find it necessary to reach this question at this stage in light of its other findings and \n28 \ndeterminations. \n20 \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 21 of 29   Page\nID #:1905\n \n1  Accordingly, the Court finds that the FAC sufficiently pleads a violation of Plaintiffs’ \n2  constitutional rights to family association.  \n3  2.  Plaintiffs sufficiently allege policies, practices, and customs that were the \n4  moving force behind the violations at issue. \n5  Two other elements of Monell liability require the Plaintiffs sufficiently allege that the \n6  County had a policy or custom that was the moving force behind the alleged violations. The Court \n7  finds these two prongs satisfied. Drawing all inferences in favor of Plaintiffs, the Court finds that the \n8  FAC alleges various and significant systematic failures of the County’s foster care system. FAC ¶¶ \n9  55–123; see Trevino v. Gates, 99 F.3d 911, 918 (9th Cir. 1996) (explaining that “[a]bsent a formal \n10  governmental policy,” a plaintiff can show a custom that is “so ‘persistent and widespread’ that it \n11  constitutes ‘permanent and well settled [] policy’”). Here, Plaintiffs allege practices and customs that \n12  appear to have gone on for years. See, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 55–61. Moreover, drawing all inferences in favor \n13  of Plaintiffs, these systematic failures are the cause of the harm Plaintiffs allege.   \n14  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs sufficiently allege policies, practices, and/or \n15  customs that are the driving force of the violations for purposes of Monell liability at this stage. \n16  3.  Plaintiffs sufficiently allege deliberate indifference. \n17  The final element of a Monell claim is a showing of deliberate indifference. In the foster care \n18  context, a plaintiff can show that a government entity acted with deliberate indifference through two \n19  exceptions—the special relationship exception or the state-created danger exception. Momox-Caselis \n20  v. Donohue, 987 F.3d 835, 845 (9th Cir. 2021). The special relationship exception applies when the \n21  state assumes responsibility for a child. Id. The Ninth Circuit has explained that the “deliberate \n22  indifference standard, as applied to foster children, requires a showing of an objectively substantial \n23  risk of harm and a showing that the officials were subjectively aware of facts” from which they drew \n24  or reasonably should have drawn the conclusion that the risk existed. Henry A., 678 F.3d at 1001. \n25  There is also an exception where a state “affirmatively places the plaintiff in danger by acting with \n26  ‘deliberate indifference’ to a ‘known and obvious danger.’” Id. at 998. This exception applies where \n27  a state’s affirmative act places an individual in obvious or known danger that they otherwise would \n28  not have faced, and the state acted with deliberate indifference to that danger. Id. at 1002. Here, the \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 22 of 29   Page\nID #:1906\n \n1  Court finds sufficient allegations in the FAC to plead deliberate indifference as to both the special \n2  relationship and state-created danger exception.19 While the County argues that there are insufficient \n3  allegations that this is a “deliberate choice” sufficient to rise to the level of deliberate indifference, \n4  the Court finds this is a reasonable inference which must be drawn in favor of Plaintiffs at this stage \n5  of the case. County Motion at 21.  \n6  The allegations, taken as true, show that a foster child under the care of CFS is objectively \n7  likely to suffer harm from CFS’s lack of adequate case planning, monitoring, and provision of \n8  services, and the caseworkers’ high caseload. The allegations also show that CFS is aware of this \n9  significant likelihood of harm but has taken no steps to address it.20 This is sufficient to allege that \n10  CFS has violated the due process of the foster children under its care because these children do not \n11  have their “basic human needs,” including “food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and reasonable \n12  safety” provided for. Henry A., 678 F.3d at 1000. For example, the FAC alleges that CFS “does not \n13  provide Plaintiffs or other foster children in its custody with timely health or dental assessments.” \n14  FAC ¶ 18. Drawing all inferences in favor of Plaintiffs, a lack of timely medical treatment creates an \n15  objective risk of harm that CFS either would or should subjectively know creates this risk, and the \n16  Court finds it a plausible inference at this stage that CFS has the ability to address these issues. \n17  There are also allegations that satisfy a state-created danger exception—for example, using \n18  CFS offices that lack basic living essentials and safety features as living quarters for children. FAC \n19  ¶¶ 81–84. This is an affirmative act that places the child in known or obvious danger. Moreover, the \n20  allegations show this act is taken with deliberate indifference to the risk, as CFS is alleged to have \n21  acknowledged that children with significant behavioral and emotional problems spend nights in CFS \n22  offices. Id. ¶ 82. At this stage, the Court finds the allegations sufficient to support a claim of \n23  deliberate indifference.  \n24 \n25   \n26  19 The County Defendants noted at the hearing that the state-created danger exception was not raised in \nPlaintiffs’ opposition. The Court addresses this exception here as it was argued by the State Defendants in \n27  their motion, but given that the Court finds that both exceptions apply, the Court does not find it necessary for \nthe County Defendants to further brief the issue.  \n28 \n20 The allegations also sufficiently show awareness by the CDSS Defendants. FAC ¶¶ 21, 136. \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 23 of 29   Page\nID #:1907\n \n1  Accordingly, the Court finds Plaintiffs adequately plead a Monell claim and DENIES the \n2  County Motion on this basis.  \n3  B.  Substantive Due Process Claim Under State Law (Fourth Cause of Action) \n4  The County moves on Plaintiffs’ claim for violation of substantive due process based on \n5  California’s Constitution on the same grounds as the due process claim under the Fourteenth \n6  Amendment. Accordingly, the Court’s reasoning above applies equally to these claims and the Court \n7  DENIES the County Motion on this basis.  \n8  C.  Plaintiffs Adequately Plead Violations of the WIC (Second Cause of Action) \n9  The County argues that Plaintiffs fail to plead sufficient facts to state a violation of WIC \n10  Sections 16501.1 or 16503. County Motion at 26. These WIC provisions mandate specific \n11  requirements for case plans. The Court finds that Plaintiffs sufficiently allege at this stage that CFS \n12  does not provide adequate or timely case planning. See, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 73 (“All available evidence \n13  indicates that [] CFS’s caseworkers do note complete case plans on time or with all required \n14  stakeholders . . .”), 74 (alleging CFS acknowledges that its case plans are “cookie cutter” and not \n15  made with input from the family), 75 (alleging many foster parents, family members, and foster \n16  children never see the plan).  \n17  Accordingly, the Court DENIES the County Motion on this basis. \n18  D.  Plaintiffs Adequately Plead Claims under the ADA, RA, and Section 11135 \n19  (Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Causes of Action) \n20  To plead a public program violation under the ADA, a plaintiff must show that: (1) he is a \n21  qualified individual with a disability, (2) he was either excluded from participation in or denied the \n22  benefits of a public entity’s services, programs, or activities, or was otherwise discriminated against \n23  by the public entity; and (3) such exclusion, denial of benefits, or discrimination was by reason of \n24  his disability. Duvall v. County of Kitsap, 260 F.3d 1124, 1135 (9th Cir. 2001). A plaintiff may show \n25  disability discrimination based on “disparate treatment, disparate impact, or failure to make a \n26  reasonable accommodation.” Payan v. Los Angeles Community College Dist., 11 F.4th 729, 738 (9th \n27  Cir. 2021) (“To assert a disparate impact claim, a plaintiff must allege that a facially neutral \n28  government policy or practice has the ‘effect of denying meaningful access to public services’ to \n \n23 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 24 of 29   Page\nID #:1908\n \n1  people with disabilities.’”). Drawing all inferences in favor of the Plaintiffs, the Court finds these \n2  elements adequately alleged. Several Plaintiffs are alleged to have qualifying disabilities. FAC ¶¶ \n3  141, 157, 166, 167, 218. The FAC alleges that CFS’s policies and practices “disproportionately harm \n4  foster children with disabilities.” Id. ¶ 117. For example, “CFS’s failure to conduct timely health \n5  assessments—especially those related to mental health” plausibly leads to a disparate impact on \n6  children with disabilities because of the obvious implications that the absence of assessments has on \n7  identifying and meeting these children’s unique needs. Id. ¶ 120. \n8  Accordingly, the Court DENIES the County Motion on this basis. \n9  E.  There are insufficient facts stated against the Individual Defendants. \n10    Separately from the County, the Board Members and Zepeda (the “Individual Defendants”) \n11  move to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims against them arguing that there is a lack of facts against them. \n12  CFS Motion at 8. Plaintiffs appear to concede that the only claims against the Individual Defendants \n13  go towards explaining their general role with relation to CFS and the County. County Opp. at 19. \n14  However, the Court finds this insufficient to plead any actual awareness or knowledge of the \n15  deficiencies alleged of the CFS beyond mere speculation.  \n16    Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the CFS Motion as to the Individual Defendants with leave \n17  to amend. \n18  F.  Section 1983 Claims Against Remaining County Defendants are Redundant. \n19  CFS and the Individual Defendants also argue that the Section 1983 claims against them \n20  should be dismissed because they are redundant with the ones brought against the County. CFS \n21  Motion at 11. Plaintiffs do not dispute the redundancy, nor identify any specific remedies that they \n22  would not be able to seek if CFS and the Individual Defendants were so dismissed. See Kentucky v. \n23  Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 166 (1985) (explaining that “a plaintiff seeking to recover on a damages \n24  judgment in an official-capacity suit must look to the government entity itself”). Rather, Plaintiffs \n25  merely argue that the Court is not “required” to dismiss redundant claims at this time. County Opp. \n26  at 19. Nevertheless, the Court finds no reason not to deal with the redundancy at an early stage given \n27  the scope of this case.  \n28 \n \n24 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 25 of 29   Page\nID #:1909\n \n1  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the CFS Motion on this basis and DISMISSES the \n2  Individual Defendants and CFS as to the First, Third, and Fifth Causes of Action. \n3  STATE DEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS TO DISMISS (ECF NOS. 42, 43) \n4  I.  Applicable Law \n5  The State Defendants also move to dismiss the FAC under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n6  12(b)(6), for which the standard the Court has laid out previously. \n7  II.  Discussion \n8  For the reasons discussed below, the Court GRANTS IN PART the CDSS Motion and \n9  GRANTS the Newsom Motion without leave to amend.   \n10  A.  The Court finds no grounds for dismissal under Rule 17. \n11  The CDSS Defendants first seek dismissal on the basis of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12  17(c)(2) (“Rule 17”). Rule 17 requires that a minor who does not have a duly appointed \n13  representative may sue “by a next friend or by a guardian ad litem.” Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 17(c)(2). A \n14  court must appoint a guardian ad litem, or issue another appropriate order, to protect a minor “who is \n15  unrepresented in an action.” Id. However, that is what has been done in this case—Plaintiffs are \n16  minors who are bringing suit by next friends. As such, Plaintiffs are represented parties, so the latter \n17  part of Rule 17 does not apply. The CDSS Defendants point to no binding authority that requires the \n18  Court to “evaluate the propriety of the purported ‘next friends’” based on the record before it. \n19  Moreover, the Ninth Circuit has instructed that Rule 17 does not provide grounds for dismissal of the \n20  case. Davis v. Walker, 745 F.3d 1303, 1310 (9th Cir. 2014) (explaining that “the court may not use \n21  [Rule 17] as a vehicle for dismissing claims or for allowing the interests of an incompetent litigant to \n22  go completely unprotected”).21  \n23  Accordingly, the Court does not find that Rule 17 provides any basis for granting the CDSS \n24  Motion. \n25  / / / \n26 \n \n27 \n21 On reply, the CDSS Defendants do not rebut this point, and instead state that a stay would suffice. CDSS \nReply at 3. While the Court does not find an order under Rule 17 required under these circumstances, this \n28 \nargument is irrelevant to the merits of the motion to dismiss.  \n \n25 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 26 of 29   Page\nID #:1910\n \n1  B.  Eleventh Amendment immunity is applicable to CDSS on some claims. \n2  CDSS individually argues that dismissal against it is warranted because it is immune under \n3  the Eleventh Amendment. CDSS Motion at 10. “The Eleventh Amendment prohibits federal courts \n4  from hearing suits brought against an unconsenting state,” including state agencies and departments. \n5  Brooks v. Sulphur Springs Valley Elec. Co-op., 951 F.2d 1050, 1053 (9th Cir. 1991). Plaintiffs do \n6  not dispute that facially, CDSS is covered under this immunity. Genevier v. U.S. Citizenship & \n7  Immigr. Servs., 144 Fed. App’x 586, 587 (9th Cir. 2005). Instead, Plaintiffs argue that there are two \n8  exceptions that are applicable here. CDSS Opp. at 6. However, these exceptions are only argued as \n9  to the ADA claim and the RA. Id. Plaintiffs make no arguments that there are any applicable \n10  exceptions to the remaining claims asserted against CDSS, so the Court finds that the immunity \n11  applies to the AACWA and Section 1983 claims. See Dittman v. Cal., 191 F.3d 1020, 1025–26 (9th \n12  Cir. 1999) (“The State of California has not waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity with respect \n13  to claims brought under § 1983 in federal court, and the Supreme Court has held that ‘§ 1983 was \n14  note intended to abrogate a State’s Eleventh Amendment immunity.’”) (internal citations omitted). \n15  As to the ADA and RA claims, the Court finds both that Congress has abrogated any state \n16  immunity, and that California has waived its immunity by accepting federal funding. See Clark v. \n17  Cal. Dep’t. of Corrections, 123 F.3d 1267, 1269 (9th Cir. 1997) (“Congress can . . . abrogate a \n18  state’s immunity to suit, or the state can waive it.”). Specifically, the Ninth Circuit has held that the \n19  RA “manifests a clear intent to condition a state’s participation on its consent to waive its Eleventh \n20  Amendment immunity.” Id. at 1271. Moreover, “Congress has unequivocally expressed its intent to \n21  abrogate the State’s immunity under both the ADA and the [RA].” Id. at 1269. Therefore, there is no \n22  state immunity as to Plaintiffs’ RA and ADA claims as a matter of law. \n23  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS IN PART the CDSS Motion and DISMISSES the claims \n24  against CDSS only as to Plaintiffs’ Section 1983 claims (First, Third, and Fifth Causes of Action) \n25  without leave to amend. \n26  C.  There are sufficient facts stated against the CDSS Defendants. \n27  The CDSS Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ allegations in the FAC regarding their liability \n28  are based only on a few conclusory allegations related to their general oversight over CFS, which are \n \n26 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 27 of 29   Page\nID #:1911\n \n1  insufficient to meet the plausibility requirement set forth by Iqbal and Twombly. CDSS Motion at 9. \n2  The CDSS Defendants argue that to establish such supervisory liability, Plaintiffs must show either a \n3  “personal involvement in the constitutional deprivation” or “a sufficient causal connection between \n4  the supervisor’s wrongful conduct and the constitutional violation.” Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, \n5  1207 (9th Cir. 2011).22  \n6  The FAC alleges that CDSS “has failed to take the necessary steps to ensure that CFS \n7  protects [] children,” “has not taken actions to stop these illegal activities,” and that CDSS is “fully \n8  aware of CFS’s systematic failings.” FAC ¶¶ 10, 12, 21, 136. The Court finds this sufficient to \n9  establish a causal connection at this stage. That statutory provisions do impose affirmative duties on \n10  the CDSS, which is a specific basis to establish a causal connection between the CDSS Defendants \n11  and the harm alleged. FAC ¶ 3.23 See Starr, 652 F.3d at 1207–08 (explaining that the “requisite \n12  causal connection can be established” by knowingly refusing to stop actions which one “knew or \n13  reasonably should have known would cause others to inflict” an injury). Plaintiffs have sufficiently \n14  alleged the CDSS Defendants’ knowledge of CFS’s deficiencies in addition to a lack of action on \n15  their part in violation of their obligations, which plausibly lead to the harm identified.24  \n16  Accordingly, the Court DENIES the CDSS Motion on this basis. \n17  D.  There are insufficient allegations against Newsom. \n18  Newsom separately argues that there are insufficient allegations against him, in particular \n19  because “a generalized duty to enforce state law or general supervisory power over the persons \n20  responsible for enforcing the challenged provision will not subject an official to suit.” Snoeck v. \n21 \n \n22 \n22 The Court notes that this standard is specific to Section 1983 claims, but it appears that both parties are \n23  using this standard as to all claims moved on. Accordingly, the Court addresses the arguments as to all \nrelevant claims, including the ADA and RA claims, based on this standard.  \n24 \n23 The Court notes that it does not appear that the specific statutory provisions that impose these duties, which \n25  Plaintiffs raise in their opposition, are specifically identified in the FAC. CDSS Opp. at 8–9. Nevertheless, at \nthis stage, the Court finds that the description of CDSS’s responsibilities and obligations in the FAC is \n26  sufficient to give the CDSS Defendants fair notice of the claims, especially given that there is no heightened \npleading standard for the claims at issue. See, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 128–136. \n27 \n24 At the hearing, counsel for the State Defendants emphasized that certain claims should fail against Director \nJohnson specifically, but as the State Defendants did not distinguish their arguments as to the CDSS and \n28 \nDirector Johnson in their motion, the Court does not consider these arguments.  \n \n27 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 28 of 29   Page\nID #:1912\n \n1  Brussa, 153 F.3d 984, 986 (9th Cir. 1998). Plaintiffs do not dispute this.25 Plaintiffs appear to argue \n2  that suit against Newsom is proper here because he (1) receives regular reporting directly from \n3  CDSS, (2) he is solely responsible for appointing the CDSS director, and (3) he is responsible for \n4  proposing the total statewide budget for child welfare programs in California. Newsom Opp. at 11. \n5  However, the Ninth Circuit previously considered the same types of powers insufficient to tie a \n6  governor to a claim. See Los Angeles Branch NAACP v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist., 714 F.2d \n7  946, 953 (9th Cir. 1983) (finding an insufficient connection where “the Governor’s powers in th[e] \n8  area are limited to making general policy and budget recommendations, as well as administrative \n9  appointments”). Plaintiffs have simply failed to make specific allegations against the Governor that \n10  tie him to their claims. \n11  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the Newsom Motion WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND, as \n12  the deficiency cannot be adequately remedied through amendment.  \n13  E.  Plaintiffs adequately plead causes of action against the CDSS Defendants. \n14  The CDSS Defendants next move on the adequacy of Plaintiffs’ First, Third, Fifth, Sixth, and \n15  Seventh Causes of Action.26 The Court finds the arguments made by the CDSS Defendants to be \n16  largely duplicative of the ones made by the County in the County Motion.27 Accordingly, the Court \n17  incorporates its findings on the County Motion as to these causes of action here. Moreover, since the \n18  Court finds supervisory liability is sufficiently alleged as to the CDSS Defendants, any allegations \n19  that support a cause of action as to the County and CFS would similarly subject the CDSS \n20  Defendants to liability.  \n21  Accordingly, the Court DENIES the CDSS Motion on these grounds. \n22  *** \n23 \n \n24 \n25 Plaintiffs only argue that “courts routinely allow lawsuits to proceed against governors” in the child welfare \n25  context. Newsom Opp. at 11. However, Plaintiffs cite only non-binding, out-of-state cases. Id. \n26  26 While the Court addresses the CDSS Defendants together in this section for consistency, the Court notes \nthat for the Section 1983 causes of action, the only defendant is Johnson giving the Court’s previous finding \n27  that CDSS is immune to such claims.  \n27 The Court has addressed the specific arguments made by the CDSS Defendants in footnotes in its analysis \n28 \nof the County Motion. \n \n28 \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 78     Filed 09/30/24     Page 29 of 29   Page\nID #:1913\n1  III.

ECF No. 80. For the reasons stated herein, the Court DENIES the Motion.  \n24   \n25   \n26   \n27  / / / \n28  / / /   \n \n  1 \n \n    \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 100     Filed 02/12/25     Page 2 of 7   Page ID\n#:2265\n \n1  I.  Background \n2  The relevant factual background to this case is laid out in the Court’s prior Order Granting in \n3  Part Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, where the Court denied Defendant San Bernardino County’s \n4  (the “County”) motion to dismiss on the basis of subject matter jurisdiction. ECF No. 78 (“MTD \n5  Order”). On October 11, 2024, the County moved to certify the issue for appeal. ECF No. 80 (the \n6  “Motion”). On January 7, 2025, Plaintiffs filed their opposition. ECF No. 94 (“Opposition”). On \n7  January 14, 2025, the County filed its reply. ECF No. 98 (“Reply”).  \n8  II.  Applicable Law \n9  A district court may certify an order for interlocutory appeal when the certification \n10  requirements of 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) have been met—namely “(1) that there be a controlling \n11  question of law, (2) that there be substantial grounds for difference of opinion, and (3) that an \n12  immediate appeal may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.” In re Cement \n13  Antitrust Litig., 673 F.2d 1020, 1026 (9th Cir. 1981). “[T]he legislative history of 1292(b) indicates \n14  that this section was to be used only in exceptional situations in which allowing an interlocutory \n15  appeal would avoid protracted and expensive litigation.” Id. Indeed, § 1292(b) embodies a “narrow \n16  exception to the final judgment rule.” Couch v. Telescope Inc., 611 F.3d 629, 633 (9th Cir. 2010). \n17  The party pursuing the interlocutory appeal bears the burden of demonstrating that the requirements \n18  established by § 1292(b) are satisfied. Id.  \n19  III.  Discussion \n20  The County previously moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, in part \n21  arguing that the Court should abstain from hearing this action under Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 \n22  (1971).1 See ECF No. 44-1 (“MTD”). In Sprint Commc’ns, Inc. v. Jacobs, the Supreme Court \n23  explained that there are three “exceptional circumstances” that “justify a federal court’s refusal to \n24  decide a case in deference” to: (1) ongoing state criminal prosecutions, (2) certain civil enforcement \n25  proceedings, and (3) pending civil proceedings involving certain orders “uniquely in furtherance of \n26 \n \n27 \n1 The County also contended that Plaintiffs’ claims are not redressable by federal injunction, and that the \nRooker-Feldman doctrine deprives the Court of jurisdiction. The Motion does not concern the Court’s ruling \n28 \non these other grounds.   \n \n  2 \n \n    \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 100     Filed 02/12/25     Page 3 of 7   Page ID\n#:2266\n \n1  the state courts’ ability to perform their judicial functions.” 571 U.S. 69, 78 (2013). Where there is \n2  such an exceptional case, courts should still analyze additional factors2 to determine whether \n3  abstention is appropriate. Id. at 81 (explaining that the Middlesex factors are not “dispositive” but \n4  rather “additional factors appropriately considered . . . before invoking Younger”). While the County \n5  contended that Plaintiffs’ ongoing dependency proceedings in state court fall under the second \n6  category of civil enforcement proceedings, the Court found that they did not—and accordingly, there \n7  was no basis to abstain under Younger. MTD Order at 12. As explained next, the Court finds that \n8  while there is a controlling question of law at issue, there are no substantial grounds for difference of \n9  opinion under Ninth Circuit law.   \n10  A.  There is a Controlling Question of Law at Issue \n11  First, the Court finds that the issue the County seeks certification of is a question of law. \n12  Although Plaintiffs dispute that the question of Younger abstention is a “pure” question of law, they \n13  cite no binding authority that states that only “pure” questions of law, as opposed to mixed questions \n14  of law and fact, can be certified for appeal. Opposition at 7–8.3 Regardless, even if there were \n15  hypothetical scenarios that could make the abstention analysis fact-intensive, here, the Court did not \n16  rely on any factual basis in making its finding—rather, its analysis focused on the applicable case \n17  law. See MTD Order at 11–12; cf. ICTSI Or., Inc. v. Int’l Longshore & Warehouse Union, 22 F.4th \n18  1125, 1132 (9th Cir. 2022) (finding the dispute a question of fact where “the district court primarily \n19  relied on facts from the record”). Significantly, the issue of abstention is consistently reviewed de \n20 \n \n21 \n2 In particular, abstention is appropriate where (1) “there is an ongoing state judicial proceeding,” (2) “those \n22 \nproceedings implicate important state interests,” (3) “there is adequate opportunity in the state proceedings to \nraise constitutional challenges,” and (4) the “requested relief must seek to enjoin—or have the practical effect \n23 \nof enjoining—ongoing state proceedings.” ReadyLink Healthcare, Inc. v. State Comp. Ins. Fund, 754 F.3d \n754, 758 (9th Cir. 2014). These factors are known as the Middlesex factors. See Middlesex Cnty. Ethics \n24 \nComm. v. Garden State Bar Ass’n, 457 U.S. 423 (1982).   \n25  3 Plaintiffs cite to a district court case, TCL Communs. Tech. Holdings, Ltd. v. Telefonaktenbologet LM \nEricsson, for this proposition. 2014 WL 12588293 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 30, 2014). However, this language \n26 \nactually appears to stem from a Seventh Circuit Case, where the court explained that a “pure question of law” \nwas “something the court of appeals could decide quickly and cleanly without having to study the record.” \n27 \nAhrenholz v. Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ill., 219 F.3d 674, 677 (7th Cir. 2000). The Seventh Circuit did not say \nmixed questions of fact and law could never be certified, but merely distinguished between an “abstract legal \n28 \nissue” and the “issue of whether summary judgment should be granted.” Id. at 677. \n \n  3 \n \n    \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 100     Filed 02/12/25     Page 4 of 7   Page ID\n#:2267\n \n1  novo as a question of law on appeals, even in contexts where the Ninth Circuit has decided there is a \n2  mixed question of fact and law. See Commc’ns Telesystems Int’l v. Cal. Public Utility Comm’n, 196 \n3  F.3d 1011, 1015 (9th Cir. 1999) (“We review a decision to abstain under Younger as a question of \n4  law.”); Fresh Int’l Corp. v. Agric. Labor Relations Bd., 805 F.2d 1353, 1356 (9th Cir. 1986) (noting \n5  that while the abstention inquiry, including the actual application of the Middlesex factors, “is a \n6  mixed question of fact and law . . . we review de novo a district court’s refusal to abstain under \n7  Younger”). Accordingly, the Court finds the issue to be a question of law.  \n8  The Court also finds that this question of law is controlling. The Ninth Circuit has explained \n9  that “all that must be shown in order for a question to be ‘controlling’ is that resolution of the appeal \n10  could materially affect the outcome of litigation in the district court.” In re Cement, 673 F.2d at \n11  1026. A question of jurisdiction undoubtedly materially affects the outcome of this litigation, as the \n12  lack thereof precludes the Court from hearing the case in its entirety. See id. at 1026–27 (noting that \n13  a question of privilege “involves nothing as fundamental as the determination as . . . whether a court \n14  . . . has jurisdiction”). Therefore, the Court finds the first requirement of certification met.  \n15  B.  The Court Does Not Find a Substantial Grounds for Difference of Opinion \n16  “To determine if a ‘substantial ground for difference of opinion’ exists under § 1292(b), \n17  courts must examine to what extent the controlling law is unclear.” Couch v. Telescope Inc., 611 \n18  F.3d 629, 633 (9th Cir. 2010). “Courts traditionally will find that a substantial ground for difference \n19  of opinion exists where ‘the circuits are in dispute on the question and the court of appeals of the \n20  circuit has not spoken on the point . . .’” Id. The Court acknowledged in its prior ruling that there \n21  was a circuit split on “whether Younger abstention applies in the context of ongoing dependency \n22  proceedings” and that the Ninth Circuit has not spoken on this issue. MTD Order at 11–12. \n23  However, the Court does not find that the circuit split alone provides substantial grounds for a \n24  difference of opinion when considering the existing Ninth Circuit precedent.4  \n25   \n26  4 Although the County contends that “[t]wo district judges within the Ninth Circuit have found that reasonable \njurists could reach different conclusions on this exact issue,” it is worth noting that these judges actually made \n27  a finding on this issue consistent with this Court’s, reflecting no substantial difference of opinion within this \ncircuit. Reply at 6; see Jeremiah M. v. Crum, 695 F. Supp. 3d 1060, 1079 (D. Alaska 2023) (finding ongoing \n28 \n \n \n  4 \n \n    \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 100     Filed 02/12/25     Page 5 of 7   Page ID\n#:2268\n \n1  First, the Court notes that the Ninth Circuit has explicitly emphasized the parts of Sprint \n2  Communications that this Court relied on in its analysis in ReadyLink Healthcare. In particular, the \n3  Ninth Circuit explained that Sprint “squarely [held] that Younger abstention is limited to the ‘three \n4  exceptional categories’ of cases identified . . .” ReadyLink Healthcare, Inc., 754 F.3d 754, 759 (9th \n5  Cir. 2014). The Ninth Circuit also emphasized that “[f]or civil enforcement actions that are akin to \n6  criminal proceedings . . . the proceedings are characteristically initiated to sanction the federal \n7  plaintiff . . . for some wrongful act, and investigations are commonly involved, often culminating in \n8  the filing of a formal complaint or charges.” Id. (internal quotations omitted). As the Court noted in \n9  its analysis, the dependency proceedings at issue “are not punitive nor criminal.” MTD Order at 10. \n10  Therefore, finding that the dependency proceedings do not fall under the category of civil \n11  enforcement proceedings is consistent with the precedent as reemphasized by the Ninth Circuit. \n12  Moreover, the Court notes that the only binding authority cited by the County that supported \n13  finding otherwise was in the Supreme Court’s decision in Moore v. Sims, 442 U.S. 415, 423 (1979). \n14  See ECF No. 44-1 at 17–18. The Court acknowledged that in Moore, the Supreme Court did find a \n15  state proceeding involving the temporary removal of a child subject to abstention as a quasi-criminal \n16  proceeding. MTD Order at 11. However, the Court distinguished Moore through its interpretation of \n17  Sprint and found that the ongoing dependency proceedings are not analogous to the proceedings at \n18  issue in Moore, which were about the initial removal. Id. To the extent that Moore provided any \n19  grounds for disagreement with the Court’s holding, the Court finds that the Ninth Circuit’s holding \n20  in L.H. v. Jamieson forecloses these grounds. 643 F.2d 1351 (9th Cir. 1981).5 Although L.H. did not \n21  specifically address the issue of whether dependency proceedings should be considered quasi-\n22   \n23  dependency proceedings “not quasi-criminal proceedings under Younger”); Ocean S. v. Los Angeles County, \n2024 WL 3973047, at *8 (C.D. Cal. June 11, 2024) (“That an initial removal hearing necessarily precedes \n24  hearings in a juvenile court proceeding does not compel the conclusion that the entire dependency proceeding \nis a quasi-criminal action.”).  \n25 \nFurther, in Crum, although the district court certified the Younger abstention question for interlocutory \n26  appeal, the Ninth Circuit ultimately denied the Defendants permission to appeal. See Jeremiah M. v. Kovol, \nCase No. 23-2726, ECF No. 11.1 (9th Cir. Dec. 18, 2023). There is no reason to believe that a request to \n27  appeal here would yield a different result given the similarity of the questions and the applicable standard. \n5 Although the County states that Plaintiffs did not cite L.H. in its opposition to the motion to dismiss, the \n28 \nCourt notes Plaintiffs did cite it. See ECF No. 53 at 8, 11.   \n \n  5 \n \n    \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 100     Filed 02/12/25     Page 6 of 7   Page ID\n#:2269\n \n1  criminal civil enforcement proceedings and cannot be binding on this point, significantly, L.H. was \n2  decide two years after Moore. Therefore, the Ninth Circuit in L.H. did not find Moore to be a bar in \n3  finding that Younger abstention did not apply to ongoing dependency proceedings.6 Id. at 1352 \n4  (reversing district court finding that “the state courts’ continuing jurisdiction over [dependent \n5  children after an initial placement has been made] caused the case to fall within [Younger]”).7 \n6  Regardless of the fact that L.H. did not apply the post-Sprint analysis of Younger abstention, at a \n7  minimum, L.H. has the effect of limiting any precedential value Moore has on this issue.  \n8  As a result, although the County contends that there is a circuit split as to the scope and \n9  impact of Moore, the Ninth Circuit has specifically not interpreted Moore “to require federal courts \n10  to abstain from any federal action seeking to bring about foster care reform.” See Motion at 12. The \n11  remaining binding authority on this issue as set forth by Sprint and reiterated by the Ninth Circuit \n12  make clear that to be considered a quasi-criminal proceeding, the proceeding must be “akin” to a \n13  criminal one. Here, there is no substantial grounds for dispute that the dependency proceedings at \n14  issue are not akin to criminal proceedings. Accordingly, the Court does not find the second \n15  requirement for certification met.  \n16  C.  An Appeal May or May Not Advance the Ultimate Termination of the Litigation \n17  The final prong of certification “is satisfied when the resolution of the question ‘may \n18  appreciably shorten the time, effort, or expense of conducting’ the district court proceedings.” ICTSI \n19 \n \n20  6 The County attempts to distinguish L.H. because it involved the role of Arizona state courts and the Ninth \nCircuit noted that the “state court has completed its work once it has made its initial placement decision” in its \n21 \nopinion. Id. at 1354. However, the Ninth Circuit was clear that the Arizona courts “retain jurisdiction over \ndelinquent and dependent children after an initial placement has been made.” Id. at 1352 (emphasis added).  \n22 \n7 While the Court did not find it necessary to reach the Middlesex factors given its finding that the dependency \n23  proceedings were not the type of case to which Younger abstention applied, to the extent that the Ninth \nCircuit reversed this decision, the Middlesex factors must still be satisfied in order to find abstention \n24  appropriate. Here, it is worth noting that while L.H.’s analysis was limited to the case law at that time \nsurrounding Younger abstention, its analysis is still precedential to the extent that it aligns with what the \n25 \nMiddlesex factors are today. In particular, whether there is an ongoing state proceeding, whether there is an \nadequate opportunity to raise the challenges in the underlying proceeding, and whether the requested relief \n26 \neffectively seeks to enjoin the state proceeding—all factors discussed in L.H.—are still relevant to the current \nMiddlesex factors. Moreover, as the County would have to show that all the Middlesex factors are met in \n27 \norder for a court to find abstention, L.H.’s finding that some of these factors are not met with regards to \nongoing dependency proceedings indicates that the outcome here would not be changed even if the Ninth \n28 \nCircuit held that the proceedings qualify as quasi-criminal civil enforcement actions.  \n \n  6 \n \n    \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 100     Filed 02/12/25     Page 7 of 7   Page ID\n#:2270\n1  Or., Inc., 22 F.4th at 1131. Here, it is true that if the Ninth Circuit were to find ongoing dependency \n2  proceedings a category of cases subject to Younger abstention, and if the Ninth Circuit or this Court \n3  were to reach the Middlesex factors and find abstention warranted, the case would terminate.8\n4  However, to the extent that the Ninth Circuit were to find otherwise, this appeal does not advance \n5  the termination of the case in any way, and in fact significantly delays the ultimate resolution of this \n6  case. Any order related to a finding of subject matter jurisdiction would ultimately shorten the time, \n7  effort, or expense of conducting the proceeding, but the County cites no authority requiring the \n8  automatic certification of a jurisdictional issue. And, even if the Court were to find this final \n9  requirement for certification met, it is insufficient to find certification proper where the Court has not \n10  found a substantial grounds for difference of opinion.  \n11  IV. Conclusion \n12  Having reviewed all the factors, the Court in its discretion denies certification of its MTD \n13  Order for appeal. Accordingly, the Court hereby DENIES the Motion to Certify. ECF No. 80. \n14 \n15    IT IS SO ORDERED.     \n16 \n17  Dated: February 12, 2025  ___________________________________ \n18    HON. MAAME EWUSI-MENSAH FRIMPONG \n19    United States District Judge \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n8 But the fact that the Ninth Circuit in Crum denied permission to appeal on this precise question suggests that \nperhaps the Ninth Circuit did not find any difference in opinion substantial enough to warrant granting \n28 \npermission and that this outcome is unlikely.  \n7 \n  ",

For more than a decade, Defendants have been in the spotlight for \n3  operating a foster care system in San Bernardino County (“County”) that fails to \n4  protect the foster children whose lives and wellbeing depend on it. \n5  2.  Foster  children  are  being  abused  under  the  supervision  of  San \n6  Bernardino’s Child and Family Services (“CFS”), which runs the County’s foster \n7  care system. In December 2022, the San Bernardino Civil Grand Jury (“Grand Jury”) \n8  investigating CFS concluded that the San Bernardino child welfare system is so \n9  “complicated, secretive, and inefficient” that it is “too broken to fix” and should be \n10  “abolished.” \n11  3.  The United States and California Constitutions and federal and state \n12  statutes impose affirmative duties on CFS and the California Department of Social \n13  Services  (“CDSS”),  the  state  agency  responsible  for  overseeing  CFS,  which \n14  Defendants have systematically failed  to meet in operating and  overseeing the \n15  County’s foster care system. \n16  4.  Specifically, Defendants must protect foster children in CFS’s custody \n17  from harm and provide them with services necessary to ensure their wellbeing in the \n18  least restrictive environment.  \n19  5.  This requires Defendants to provide foster children with appropriate \n20  placements that conform to nationally recommended professional standards and \n21  adequately monitor and support foster children after placement.  \n22  6.  Defendants must also timely develop, regularly update, and effectively \n23  implement a written case plan for each foster child in CFS’s custody and identify an \n24  appropriate  permanent  home  for  foster  children  within  a  reasonable  period, \n25  including  by  petitioning  for termination  of  parental  rights  within  a  statutorily-\n26  mandated timeframe. \n27 \n28 \n  -6-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 7 of 69   Page ID\n#:152\n \n1  7.  State and federal laws also require that Defendants provide effective \n2  services  to  foster  children  with  disabilities  to  ensure  they  are  afforded  equal \n3  opportunity and have access to the least restrictive and integrated setting appropriate \n4  to their needs. \n5  8.  Despite  these  clear  constitutional  and  statutory  mandates,  all \n6  Defendants, including CDSS,  have systematically failed to protect foster children \n7  in  San  Bernardino  from  harm  or  ensure  that  they  are  provided  with  services \n8  necessary under the law to ensure their wellbeing in the least restrictive environment.  \n9  9.  On Defendants’ watch, Plaintiffs—foster children in the custody of \n10  CFS—have been put in inadequate and often dangerous placements, left without \n11  necessary services, and forced to languish unnecessarily in foster care for years.  \n12  10.  CFS has operated and continues to operate without regard to reasonable \n13  professional standards and has exhibited deliberate indifference to the ongoing harm \n14  it inflicts on foster children. CDSS has failed to take the necessary steps to ensure \n15  that CFS protects these children. \n16  11.  The named Plaintiffs—Gary G., Xander B., Francesca B., Delilah B., \n17  Teddy H., Kevin E., Sam E., Henry P., David O., Greg R., and Arnold O.—are all \n18  children in CFS’s custody who have suffered harm at the hands of CFS. They bring \n19  this lawsuit on behalf of all children who are now, or will be, in the custody of CFS. \n20  12.  Plaintiffs’  injuries  were  caused,  and  are  being  caused,  by  CFS’s \n21  numerous policies and practices that violate the rights of foster children protected \n22  by state and federal statutes and safeguarded by the United States and California \n23  Constitutions. CDSS has not taken actions to stop these illegal activities.  \n24  13.  For example, CFS does not adequately vet foster homes before placing \n25  children, such as Plaintiffs, in them. In fact, CFS even lacks proper procedures and \n26  practices to screen out known abusers from serving as foster parents. \n27 \n28 \n  -7-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 8 of 69   Page ID\n#:153\n \n1  14.  Once  CFS  places  foster  children  in  foster  homes,  it  also  fails  to \n2  adequately monitor the foster children to ensure their safety. Caseworkers fail to \n3  make enough home visits to determine whether foster children are safe in their \n4  placements, as they must under federal and state laws. Moreover, the home visits \n5  that do occur are often perfunctory and do not include separate interviews with the \n6  children in line with professional standards. \n7  15.  CFS also does not provide adequate case planning for Plaintiffs or the \n8  other foster children in its custody. CFS does not conduct timely Child and Family \n9  Team (“CFT”) meetings or provide children, foster parents, and family members \n10  with individualized case plans, as expressly required under federal and state laws. \n11  16.  CFS also lacks adequate short-term emergency placements for foster \n12  children who need them. When children like Plaintiffs enter CFS’s custody, they are \n13  often  forced  to  sleep  on  floors  in  CFS’s  office  for  days  on  end  while  their \n14  caseworkers scramble to find appropriate placements. CFS often ends up placing \n15  foster children with families who do not speak the same language. \n16  17.  Defendants further permit CFS’s caseworkers to carry caseloads that \n17  are too high to possibly meet the standards they must satisfy under the law. In fact, \n18  CFS’s caseworkers often carry caseloads five or six times higher than national \n19  professional standards recommend. Caseworkers with such high caseloads cannot \n20  adequately document and implement each foster child’s case plan as mandated by \n21  federal and state laws.  \n22  18.  CFS also does not provide Plaintiffs  or other foster children in its \n23  custody with timely health or dental assessments. When CFS moves foster children \n24  between placements, the new foster parents often do not receive their new foster \n25  child’s health files or documentation regarding their medical and psychological \n26  needs. As a result, foster children fall behind on necessary services and treatments, \n27 \n28 \n  -8-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 9 of 69   Page ID\n#:154\n \n1  sometimes left without required medication or essential therapy necessary to address \n2  their traumas and needs. \n3  19.  CFS’s systemic deficiencies expose Plaintiffs, and all foster children in \n4  the County, to a severe risk of maltreatment and future harm. \n5  20.  CFS’s policies and practices disproportionately harm foster children \n6  with  disabilities,  who  are  entitled  to  reasonable  accommodations  under  the \n7  Americans with Disabilities Act and related federal and state statutes. \n8  21.  Fully  aware  of  CFS’s  systematic  failings,  CDSS  and  the  other \n9  Defendants named in this First Amended Complaint have stood by and failed to \n10  exercise appropriate oversight, despite their legal obligation to do so. \n11  22.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief against Defendants to \n12  end  the  ongoing  harm  and  severe  risk  of future  harm  to  which  Plaintiffs  and \n13  thousands of other children in San Bernardino County are subjected on a daily basis. \n14  This lawsuit aims to reform CFS and provide the County’s vulnerable foster children \n15  with the protection, oversight, and services they are entitled to under federal and \n16  state laws. \n17  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n18  23.  This action arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States, \n19  including 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The Court has jurisdiction over the federal claims under \n20  28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a). The Court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction \n21  over the claims based on California law under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). \n22  24.  This Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory and injunctive relief \n23  under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil \n24  Procedure. \n25  25.  Venue  in  this  district  is  proper  under  28  U.S.C.  §  1391(b).  The \n26  divisional venue is appropriate in the Riverside Division because a substantial part \n27 \n28 \n  -9-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 10 of 69   Page\nID #:155\n \n1  of the acts, events, or omissions giving rise to the claims  outlined in the First \n2  Amended Complaint occurred in the Riverside Division. \n3  PARTIES \n4  I.

THE UNITED STATES AND CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTIONS \n23  IMPOSE ADDITIONAL AFFIRMATIVE DUTIES ON \n24  DEFENDANTS \n25  52.  The  Fourteenth  Amendment  of  the  United  States  Constitution \n26  guarantees to each child in state custody substantive due process rights and requires \n27  state and local child welfare officials to: \n28 \n  -17-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 18 of 69   Page\nID #:163\n \n1  a)  ensure that each  child placed in foster care  is free from the \n2  foreseeable risk of physical, mental, and emotional harm; \n3  b)  ensure that each child placed in foster care receives the services \n4  necessary  to  ensure  their  physical,  mental,  intellectual,  and \n5  emotional wellbeing in the least restrictive environment; \n6  c)  provide  each  child  placed  in  foster  care  with  conditions, \n7  treatment, and care consistent with the purpose and assumption \n8  of custody; \n9  d)  ensure that each child placed in foster care is not maintained in \n10  custody longer than is necessary to accomplish the purpose of \n11  custody; and \n12  e)  provide each child placed in foster care with reasonable efforts \n13  to obtain an appropriate permanent home and family within a \n14  reasonable period. \n15  53.  The First Amendment’s right of association and right to a permanent \n16  family, along with the Ninth Amendment’s reservation of rights to the people, and \n17  the  Fourteenth Amendment’s right to due process require  state and local child \n18  welfare officials to: \n19  a)  provide  reasonable  efforts  to  obtain  a  permanent  home  and \n20  family. \n21  54.  Article I, Section 7(a) of the California Constitution guarantees that: \n22  a)  a “person may not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without \n23  due process of law.” The protections of substantive due process \n24  under California law have at least the same scope and purposes \n25  as those under the United States Constitution. \n26   \n27 \n28 \n  -18-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 19 of 69   Page\nID #:164\n \n1  FACTS \n2  I.  CFS ENGAGES IN NUMEROUS POLICIES AND/OR PRACTICES \n3  THAT VIOLATE THE RIGHTS OF FOSTER CHILDREN IN SAN \n4  BERNARDINO COUNTY AND EXPOSE THEM TO A SEVERE \n5  RISK OF FUTURE HARM \n6  A.  CFS Has Spent the Last Decade Embroiled in Controversy \n7  55.  The San Bernardino Grand Jury “is an independent civil watchdog \n8  agency that investigates County agencies, towns and cities, and special districts \n9  within San Bernardino County,” in line with California Penal Code, section 925. \n10  56.  For most of the past decade, the Grand Jury has investigated CFS, and \n11  each year it has done so “it has discovered problems and issues.” For example, the \n12  Grand Jury concluded in 2016 that CFS caseworkers have “heavy caseloads” and \n13  “tremendous turnover.” \n14  57.  In 2017, the Grand Jury noted that caseloads remained “excessively \n15  high, especially in the High Desert.” In 2019, the Grand Jury further reiterated that \n16  “[e]xtremely heavy caseloads are especially a problem because of under-staffing and \n17  an increase in growth of the San Bernardino County’s population.” The 2016 and \n18  2019 reports also noted high caseworker turnover. \n19  58.  During that period, CFS was made further aware of these problems \n20  through litigation and investigative reporting. In fact, Fox News aired a multi-part \n21  exposé on CFS titled “The Children are Dying” in 2015. \n22  59.  In 2022, the Grand Jury found that the average caseworker caseload is \n23  around 70 to 90 cases per worker, that “substantiated foster children abuse cases \n24  have increased  every year from 2019  through 2021,”  and  that the  number “of \n25  substantiated sexual abuse and physical abuse cases is eye-opening.” \n26  60.  The Grand Jury concluded that CFS is so “complicated, secretive, and \n27  inefficient” that it is “too broken to fix” and should be “abolished.” \n28 \n  -19-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 20 of 69   Page\nID #:165\n \n1  61.  The Grand Jury’s reports are only the latest in a series of investigations \n2  into Defendants’ long-standing failure to operate a foster care system that protects \n3  the foster children whose lives and wellbeing depend on it. The California Attorney \n4  General has investigated “potential systemic breakdowns.” Investigative journalists \n5  have also revealed that foster children have been abused under CFS’s supervision. \n6  Former caseworkers have even reported that CFS has placed foster children with \n7  known sexual predators.  \n8  B.  CFS Fails  to Adequately Vet Foster Homes or  Monitor  Foster \n9  Children Once Placed \n10  62.  When  CFS  assumes legal  custody  of  children,  CFS  is  required  to \n11  monitor them to properly ensure their safety and wellbeing. \n12  63.  Part of this responsibility involves properly vetting foster parents, foster \n13  homes, and their inhabitants before entrusting foster children to their care. However, \n14  the Grand Jury has found that “CFS has no comprehensive and complete background \n15  check/vetting  system  for”  foster  parents  and  foster  homes.  As  a  result, \n16  “[b]ackground  checks  of  [foster  homes]  often  miss  unknown  or  undisclosed \n17  boyfriends or relatives who visit the home.” In extreme cases, CFS has even placed \n18  children  with  known,  registered  sex  offenders.  The  Grand  Jury  found  these \n19  procedures “subject foster children to abusive settings.” \n20  64.  Another  part  of  this  responsibility  requires  CFS’s  caseworkers  to \n21  regularly—and thoroughly—visit foster homes to ensure the foster children living \n22  there are safe.  In fact, caseworkers must visit foster children face-to-face at least \n23  once per month, and more than half of these visits should occur at the foster home. \n24  And, during these visits, foster children must receive personalized attention from \n25  their caseworker. If this does not happen, foster parents can “hide abuse problems,” \n26  leading to “substantiated sexual and physical abuses to foster children.” \n27 \n28 \n  -20-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 21 of 69   Page\nID #:166\n \n1  65.  Despite these risks, the Grand Jury has found that caseworkers “do not \n2  visit all children  monthly . . . and  there  are  insufficient and  inadequate  home \n3  inspections during visits.” Indeed, caseworkers often conduct “fly-by” visits without \n4  “interview[ing] the child or look[ing] into rooms or closets.” The Grand Jury found \n5  “that these brief interviews [] led to substantiated abuse cases.” \n6  66.  CFS’s lack of adequate vetting procedures for foster homes and failure \n7  to ensure caseworkers conduct appropriate visits to children in their placements \n8  leave foster children at substantial risk of experiencing harm and maltreatment in \n9  care. \n10  C.  CFS Does Not Provide Adequate Case Planning \n11  67.  Federal law requires CFS to provide foster children with a detailed, \n12  individualized case plan. These plans are necessary to effectively engage family \n13  members and tailor services to adequately address their needs and the needs of their \n14  children. CFS must also periodically review these case plans—at least once every \n15  six months—until a child’s case is resolved and the child has been discharged from \n16  custody.  \n17  68.  Federal and state law require that “[a] written case plan [] be completed \n18  within a maximum of 60 days of the initial removal of the child.” The case plan must \n19  include,  among  other  things,  “[b]ehaviorally  specific  goals  and  objectives  and \n20  services that will help the parents achieve a safe home for the child,” a “[s]chedule \n21  of  the  social  worker  (SW)  contacts  with  the  child,  family,  and  caregivers,” \n22  “[p]ermanency plans,” and “[a]ssurances of educational stability while the child is \n23  in out-of-home care.” \n24  69.  State law further requires that foster children over 12 years old “be \n25  given the opportunity to participate in the development of his/her case plan, review, \n26  sign and receive a copy of the case plan.” \n27 \n28 \n  -21-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 22 of 69   Page\nID #:167\n \n1  70.  CFS’s own internal policy handbook adds that the caseworker “should \n2  involve  the  parent(s),  child  and/or  additional  family  and  community  resource \n3  persons in the development of the case plan.” This policy emphasizes a shift “from \n4  the [caseworker] dictating the case plan to the parents and/or children to a more \n5  collaborative effort where the [caseworker] encourages their participation in the \n6  development of the case plan.” \n7  71.  CFT meetings represent one tool for caseworkers to collaborate with \n8  parents and children in case planning. CFT meetings should include foster children, \n9  their  family  members,  professionals,  natural  community  supports,  and  other \n10  individuals invested in the child’s success. \n11  72.  These meetings must occur within 60 days of a child’s entry into foster \n12  care, at least once every six months thereafter for children not receiving specialized \n13  mental health services, and at least once every 90 days for children receiving such \n14  specialized care. \n15  73.  All available evidence indicates that, despite statutory requirements, \n16  CFS’s caseworkers do not complete case plans on time or with all the required \n17  information,  and  CFT  meetings  do  not  occur  on  time  with  all  the  necessary \n18  stakeholders. \n19  74.  In a 2017 County Self-Assessment, CFS observed that families’ “voices \n20  are not being heard.” In essence, case plans are “cookie cutter,” “not update[d] . . . \n21  [to reflect the child’s] progress and new needs,” and “not tailored to the family and \n22  child’s needs.” At the same time, CFS reflected on a “[n]eed for more CFTs—\n23  routinely.” Above all, CFS noted that caseworkers’ lack of engagement stemmed \n24  from high caseloads, which inhibited caseworkers’ “ability to engage in ongoing \n25  assessment[s].” \n26  75.  Many foster parents, family members, and foster children have never \n27  seen the foster child’s case plan. \n28 \n  -22-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 23 of 69   Page\nID #:168\n \n1  76.  What  is  more,  CFS  caseworkers  are  not  conducting  timely  CFT \n2  meetings. And, when they do, caseworkers do not show or discuss the foster child’s \n3  case plan with the attendees. \n4  77.  Finally,  CFS  has  observed  several  other issues  interfering  with  its \n5  caseworkers’ ability to connect with foster children and their biological and foster \n6  families. First, CFS’s caseworkers often “do not speak the same language as the \n7  family.” Second, CFS noticed its caseworkers “were quick to label parent[s] as \n8  ‘resistant.’”  And  third,  CFS  found  that  its  caseworkers  were “missing  cultural \n9  humility and trauma-informed components to providing services.” \n10  78.  CFS’s lack of timely, appropriate case planning, by itself, places foster \n11  children at risk of serious and ongoing harm. This serious risk is aggravated by the \n12  fact that CFS does not regularly include all required stakeholders, such as relatives, \n13  foster parents, and family friends in the case planning process. At bottom, these \n14  issues prevent CFS from evaluating foster children’s service needs and effectively \n15  planning for permanency as the law requires. \n16  D.  CFS Lacks Short-Term Emergency Placements \n17  79.  Federal law and widely accepted professional standards require CFS to \n18  place each foster child in the most appropriate and least restrictive placement that \n19  best  suits  the  child’s  needs.  See  42  U.S.C.  §  622(b)(8)(A)(iii);  42  U.S.C.  § \n20  675(5)(A). Extensive child welfare literature also emphasizes the need to choose \n21  each child’s placement based on all information available about the child and the \n22  need to consider all available information carefully. \n23  80.  This means that CFS must have an adequate array of placements to \n24  properly  accommodate  foster  children  with  varying  levels  of  needs.  And,  by \n25  extension, CFS must properly assess each foster child’s needs before placing them \n26  with a foster family or facility, matching them with particular homes and facilities \n27  based on fit rather than availability. \n28 \n  -23-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 24 of 69   Page\nID #:169\n \n1  81.  Despite these requirements, CFS lacks adequate short-term emergency \n2  placements for children, so when children first enter care, CFS often has no other \n3  placement for them than a local CFS office. The Grand Jury found that foster \n4  children remain in these offices for “days or weeks at a time.” \n5  82.  CFS recently acknowledged that “[a] certain number of children and \n6  youth, particularly those with complex needs and significant behavioral/emotional \n7  problems, spend nights in [CFS] offices.” \n8  83.  These  offices  lack  essentials  such  as  proper  beds,  bathrooms,  and \n9  kitchens. Consequently, children “sleep on the floor, cots, and other locations” and \n10  eat from “fast food restaurants” that lack nutritional value. What is more, children \n11  with special needs often cannot receive any of their medication or other necessary \n12  services. \n13  84.  These offices also lack basic safety features. There are issues with theft \n14  and assault. And, presumably due to inadequate supervision, foster children often \n15  rifle through caseworkers’ desks to see other children’s confidential materials. \n16  85.  CFS’s placement of foster children in its offices because of a lack of \n17  short-term  emergency  placements  puts  these  children  at  substantial  risk  of \n18  experiencing maltreatment in care. As the Grand Jury concluded, these offices are \n19  “unsafe, unsanitary, and unacceptable.” \n20  E.  CFS Does Not Provide Necessary Health Assessments or Health \n21  Services to Children \n22  86.  Federal and state laws require CFS to provide foster children, along \n23  with their families, adequate services so they can be successfully reunified with their \n24  families or placed in another permanent family. Failure to provide necessary services \n25  to foster children often leads to escalating behavioral problems, failed placements, \n26  and permanent harm to foster children. \n27 \n28 \n  -24-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 25 of 69   Page\nID #:170\n \n1  87.  To provide adequate services to foster children, federal and state laws \n2  require CFS to provide adequate and timely medical, dental, and psychological \n3  assessments to diagnose what services they need. However, CFS is persistently \n4  failing to provide  these  assessments.  In  December  2022, only  48.8% of  foster \n5  children received timely medical examinations, and only 50.4% received timely \n6  dental examinations. \n7  88.  The  Grand  Jury  also  found  foster  children  are  not,  as  required, \n8  “medically and behaviorally examined before every placement in a  [new foster \n9  home].” Instead, foster children “are only medically and behaviorally assessed when \n10  the [caseworker] determines that [it] is necessary.” \n11  89.  And, for foster children placed in FFAs, CFS does not share critical \n12  medical information, including Medi-Cal cards, “in a timely manner.” As a result, \n13  the FFA foster homes often cannot schedule initial medical visits within the first 30 \n14  days of placement, as required by law. \n15  90.  What  is  more,  the  Grand  Jury  also  concluded  that  CFS  provides \n16  “[i]nadequate medical and mental health services,” such that “the current level of \n17  mental health services for foster children is severely lacking.” \n18  91.  CFS lacks “evaluation tools, assessment guidelines, therapy services \n19  and experienced mental health professionals,” particularly those who “specialize in \n20  helping  traumatized  foster  children.”  Additionally,  “CFS  lacks  sufficient \n21  community-based mental health resources.” \n22  92.  CFS is aware these issues result from its other failed  policies and \n23  practices.  Indeed,  CFS  has  acknowledged  that  “[c]aseload  size  impact[ed] \n24  [caseworkers’] ability to engage in on-going assessment[s] of child/parents’ progress \n25  in services.” \n26  93.  The lack of timely and adequate assessments and services results from \n27  CFS’s long-standing actions and inactions. Indeed, CFS knows that some of its \n28 \n  -25-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 26 of 69   Page\nID #:171\n \n1  policies and practices, such as allowing high caseworker caseloads, expose foster \n2  children to a substantial risk of future harm. \n3  F.  CFS Fails to Protect Foster Children From Maltreatment in Care \n4  94.  Foster care is supposed to protect children who have already suffered \n5  trauma at home from further harm. However foster children in San Bernardino \n6  County experience high rates of maltreatment in care. \n7  95.  Indeed, the Grand Jury found that “substantiated foster children abuse \n8  cases have increased every year from 2019 through 2021,” including “significant \n9  amounts of substantiated sexual abuse and physical abuse.” And available data \n10  shows that in 2022, CFS’s foster children experienced maltreatment at a rate of 12.40 \n11  victimizations per 100,000 days in care, which is far higher than California (7.42, \n12  2022) and national (9.07, 2020) averages. \n13  96.  Unsurprisingly, San Bernardino County recently ranked second-worst \n14  out of 58 counties in California. And if San Bernardino County were a state, it would \n15  rank 12th worst in the United States, based on 2019 data. \n16  97.  Despite these alarming figures, the Grand Jury found that CFS has “no \n17  proactive measures to keep foster children from entering abusive” homes and has \n18  engaged  in “very little  proactive  efficient monitoring of these  homes once the \n19  placement has been made.” \n20  98.  The high rate of maltreatment of foster children in CFS’s custody is a \n21  direct result of CFS’s deficient policies and practices, particularly CFS’s inadequate \n22  vetting and monitoring of foster homes and foster parents. As the data show, these \n23  policies and practices expose foster children to a substantial risk of future harm. \n24  G.  CFS Fails to Place Foster Children Into Permanent Placements \n25  99.  Foster care is intended to be temporary. Research has shown that the \n26  longer a child remains in foster care, the less likely it is they will be reunified or \n27  adopted. In turn, the longer a child waits for a permanent placement, the less likely \n28 \n  -26-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 27 of 69   Page\nID #:172\n \n1  they  are  to  complete  their  education  or  form  healthy  relationships.  Prompt \n2  permanency planning, thus, ensures that children leave foster care as quickly as \n3  possible and are placed in stable, permanent homes. \n4  100.  Federal law, in turn, requires CFS to expeditiously place foster children \n5  in permanent homes. Indeed, when children have been in foster care for 15 of the \n6  last 22 months, CFS is required by law to petition to terminate the parental rights of \n7  the child’s parents so that the child can be adopted, unless the child’s case plan \n8  documents compelling reasons why termination would not be in the child’s best \n9  interests or the child’s case qualifies for a statutory exemption. \n10  101.  Available data, however, shows that foster children in CFS’s custody \n11  languish in foster care for much longer than federal law permits. Children in the \n12  County spend an average of 551 days in custody, 104 days longer than the national \n13  average. \n14  102.  CFS has itself admitted that “[p]ermanency is not being addressed” and \n15  “performance has gotten worse since 2012.” Whereas 35.4% of the children entering \n16  foster care in 2012 achieved permanency within 12 months, only 29.1% of children \n17  entering foster care in 2016 achieved permanency within that timeframe. \n18  103.  These figures have continued to deteriorate. By 2019, only 23.9% of \n19  children entering care achieved permanency within 12 months, compared to around \n20  38.3% for foster children nationally. \n21  104.  Moreover, children in CFS’s custody are about 50% more likely to “age \n22  out” of foster care, without ever receiving a permanent home, than other foster \n23  children around the country (14.9% compared to 9% nationally, based on 2021 data). \n24  105.  CFS has recognized that “[a] crucial step in reunifying children within \n25  12 months of foster care entry is early engagement of parents,” which CFS is failing \n26  to adequately do. In other words, CFS’s policies and practices, particularly its lack \n27  of  adequate  case  planning  and  failure  to  conduct  timely  and  appropriate  CFT \n28 \n  -27-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 28 of 69   Page\nID #:173\n \n1  meetings, are directly contributing to its failure to attain permanency for the foster \n2  children in its custody. \n3  106.  The  lack of permanency outcomes for foster children,  which  arise \n4  because of CFS’s deficient policies and practices, expose foster children in the \n5  County to a substantial risk of future harm. \n6  H.  CFS  Permits  Its  Caseworkers  to  Carry  Dangerously  High \n7  Caseloads \n8  107.  CFS  has  a  constitutional  duty  to  adequately  supervise  the  foster \n9  children in its custody to ensure they are safe and receive necessary services. To do \n10  this, CFS must recruit and retain enough caseworkers to maintain caseloads that \n11  enable caseworkers to do their job. \n12  108.   The Child Welfare League of America (“CWLA”), a national coalition \n13  of agencies that develops child welfare  policies, recommends that caseworkers \n14  maintain caseloads of between 12 and 15 children in out-of-home care. Similarly, \n15  the  Council  on  Accreditation  (“COA”),  a  national  professional  licensing \n16  organization, also recommends that caseworkers maintain caseloads between 12 and \n17  15 children. \n18  109.  In the County, however, CFS permits its caseworkers to carry caseloads \n19  that far exceed these recommended standards. In 2022, the Grand Jury found that \n20  CFS allows average caseloads of around 70 to 90 children per caseworker.  \n21  110.  CFS did not refute or deny those figures in its response to the Grand \n22  Jury. In 2019, CFS acknowledged that its caseworkers had an average caseload of \n23  42 foster children. Caseloads are likely even higher in remote regions, such as the \n24  High Desert. \n25  111.  These  average  caseload  figures  include  recently  hired  caseworkers \n26  who, under recognized professional standards, should carry only lighter caseloads. \n27  In fact, it takes up to two years to train a new caseworker, during which experienced \n28 \n  -28-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 29 of 69   Page\nID #:174\n \n1  caseworkers often must shoulder higher caseloads. As the Grand Jury explained, \n2  field offices with many newly hired caseworkers are often forced to transfer cases \n3  to neighboring offices with more experienced workers, and consequently, more \n4  experienced caseworkers must maintain caseloads far higher than average. \n5  112.  Making matters worse, caseworkers spend an average of five working \n6  days per month on purely administrative tasks, leaving only 15 working days to \n7  actively supervise, plan for, and ensure services for the foster children in their care. \n8  113.  A major reason for these high caseloads is that CFS is experiencing “a \n9  high  turnover  rate  among  [caseworkers]”  while  struggling  to  recruit  new \n10  caseworkers,  who  are  deterred  by  “long  commutes,  poor  training,  and  poor \n11  supervision.” As a result, several of CFS’s field offices are “sparsely populated in \n12  terms of personnel” and do “not have enough workers to keep up with workload \n13  demands.”  In  fact,  CFS  has  “[i]nsufficient  staffing  levels  to  provide  quality \n14  services.” \n15  114.  Ultimately,  the  Grand  Jury  concluded  that  it  is  “impossible”  for \n16  caseworkers to monitor so many children properly, finding that CFS’s “mission . . . \n17  has been unsuccessful . . . primarily due to personnel issues and large caseloads.”  \n18  115.  High caseloads prevent CFS’s caseworkers from adequately assessing \n19  a  child’s  safety  or  wellbeing,  developing individualized  case  plans,  facilitating \n20  reunification services, placing children in appropriate placements, or deciding when \n21  to petition to terminate parental rights, all of which are required under state and \n22  federal laws. Manageable caseloads can exist only when an agency develops and \n23  maintains  an  adequately-funded  and  well-planned  child  welfare  system  that \n24  aggressively recruits, trains, and retains caseworkers. \n25  116.  Defendants, by contrast, have consistently failed to develop such a \n26  system, contributing to child maltreatment in care, lack of adequate services, and \n27 \n28 \n  -29-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 30 of 69   Page\nID #:175\n \n1  inadequate permanency planning, thereby exposing foster children in the County to \n2  a substantial risk of future harm. \n3  I.  CFS  Fails  to  Provide  Effective  Services  to  Children  with \n4  Disabilities \n5  117.  CFS’s  illegal  policies  and  practices  disproportionately  harm  foster \n6  children with disabilities. In particular, CFS’s lack of adequate case planning and its \n7  untimely and inadequate provision of services prevent children with disabilities from \n8  receiving the specialized care they need to succeed in foster care. \n9  118.   For instance, CFS’s failure to conduct timely health assessments—\n10  especially those related to mental health—delays the prompt identification of a \n11  child’s disability. Making matters worse, CFS does not ensure foster children are \n12  medically and behaviorally assessed before it places them in new foster homes. \n13  119.  Meanwhile,  CFS’s  failure  to  provide  necessary  services,  including \n14  “therapy services and experienced mental health professionals,” prevents disabled \n15  children from receiving adequate treatment. Delays in passing along Medi-Cal cards \n16  between  placements  further  prevent  disabled  children  from  receiving  timely \n17  services, even if such services would otherwise be available. \n18  120.  CFS’s failure to provide health assessments and services is made even \n19  worse  by  its  inadequate  case  planning  practices,  including  its  deficient  CFT \n20  meetings, which do not adequately track disabled children’s needs and progress. \n21  Indeed, foster parents sometimes receive foster children who have disabilities and \n22  need specialized care without having ever seen the child’s case plan or medical files. \n23  121.  CFS’s lack of assessments, services, and case planning is compounded \n24  by its other systemic deficiencies—high caseworker caseloads, a lack of short-term \n25  emergency  placements,  inadequate  vetting  of  foster  homes,  and  monitoring  of \n26  children  later placed in those foster homes  all disproportionately expose  foster \n27  children with disabilities to severe risk of future harm. \n28 \n  -30-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 31 of 69   Page\nID #:176\n \n1  122.  These  failings  are  particularly  alarming  considering  the  general \n2  recognition by public health authorities, such as the Centers for Disease Control and \n3  Prevention, that providing timely interventions to children with disabilities “can \n4  change a child’s developmental path and improve outcomes for children, families, \n5  and communities.” \n6  123.  By failing to safely plan with the parents, foster parents, and/or loved \n7  ones of foster children with disabilities, or to make reasonable modifications to their \n8  case planning procedures and practices, CFS unnecessarily prevents children with \n9  disabilities  from  experiencing  foster  care  in  a  way  that  federal  and  state  law \n10  requires—in the least-restrictive, most family-like setting, with adequate services. \n11  II.  THE REMAINING DEFENDANTS HAVE VIOLATED THE RIGHTS \n12  OF FOSTER CHILDREN IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY AND \n13  EXPOSED THEM TO A SEVERE RISK OF FUTURE HARM BY \n14  FAILING TO EXERCISE ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT OVER CFS \n15  A.  The  County  Defendants  Have  Failed  to  Exercise  Adequate \n16  Oversight \n17  124.  Defendant  San  Bernardino  County  is  specifically  tasked  with \n18  overseeing and monitoring CFS. \n19  125.  Defendant Members of the Board of Supervisors are responsible for \n20  overseeing  the  County’s  policies,  practices,  and  operations,  appointing  and \n21  supervising the director of CFS, and ensuring that the County complies with all \n22  applicable federal and state laws. \n23  126.  Defendant Jeany Zepeda is the Director of CFS and oversees CFS’s \n24  policies, practices, and operations. She is responsible for ensuring that CFS complies \n25  with all applicable  federal  and  state  laws. Defendants San Bernardino County, \n26  Members of the Board of Supervisors, and Jeany Zepeda, together with CFS, are \n27  referred to as the “County Defendants.” \n28 \n  -31-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 32 of 69   Page\nID #:177\n \n1  127.  The County Defendants have failed to exercise adequate oversight and \n2  ensure that CFS’s practices and procedures comply with federal and state laws, \n3  exposing foster children in San Bernardino County to a severe risk of future harm. \n4  B.  The State Defendants Have Failed to Exercise Adequate Oversight \n5  128.  Defendant CDSS is specifically tasked with overseeing all county-run \n6  child welfare agencies in California. CDSS “oversees the efforts of counties to \n7  protect California children from abuse and neglect.” The CDSS services division \n8  “provides  leadership  and  oversight  of  county  and  community  agencies  in  the \n9  implementation of child welfare services programs through regulations, training, \n10  technical  assistance,  incentives,  and  program  evaluations.”  At  the  same  time, \n11  CDSS’s licensing division oversees and regulates all foster and group homes in \n12  California. \n13  129.  One  of CDSS’s specific oversight responsibilities is to ensure  that \n14  counties place foster children in the least restrictive, most family-like environment, \n15  in line with federal law. \n16  130.  Defendant  Kimberly  Johnson  is  the  Director  of  CDSS  and  is \n17  responsible  for  overseeing  CDSS’s  policies,  practices,  and  operations.  She  is \n18  specifically charged with ensuring that CFS complies with all applicable federal and \n19  state laws. \n20  131.  Defendant  Gavin  Newsom  is  the  Governor  and  chief  executive  of \n21  California and is charged with faithfully executing the laws of the state and federal \n22  governments. Together, CDSS, Kimberly Johnson, and Gavin Newsom are referred \n23  as the “State Defendants.” \n24  132.  The State Defendants have violated federal and state mandates. \n25  133.  CDSS has faced scrutiny from state auditors. For example, in 2011, the \n26  California State Auditor noted that CDSS was not adequately preventing registered \n27 \n28 \n  -32-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 33 of 69   Page\nID #:178\n \n1  sex offenders from “inappropriately living or working in its licensed facilities or in \n2  the homes of foster children.” \n3  134.  In  2015,  auditors  again  found  deficiencies  in  CDSS’s  process  for \n4  preventing sex offenders from living in licensed facilities or homes. In 2017, auditors \n5  also  concluded  that  CDSS  was  not  “obtain[ing]  or  review[ing]  all  appropriate \n6  information before allowing individuals access to facilities.” \n7  135.  When  the  Grand  Jury  recommended  that  CFS  implement  an \n8  independent oversight committee, CFS responded that such a request would be \n9  “redundant” because CDSS “is tasked with the responsibility of monitoring and \n10  providing objective recommendations to county child welfare agencies.” Indeed, \n11  CFS claims it “implements any recommendations that CDSS may have in this \n12  regard.” \n13  136.  The State Defendants are not taking the necessary steps to oversee and \n14  rein in CFS to protect foster children. They have long been aware of CFS’s failures \n15  yet have not taken the necessary steps to correct these failures, which continue to \n16  harm the children in CFS’s custody. The Grand Jury noted in 2022 that “CFS has no \n17  local accountability, which allows them to operate behind an air of confidentiality, \n18  [which makes] any accountability for their actions [] extremely difficult.”  \n19  III.  THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS ARE AT SEVERE RISK OF FUTURE \n20  HARM AS A RESULT OF CFS’S ILLEGAL PRACTICES AND \n21  PROCEDURES AND THE STATE AND COUNTY DEFENDANTS’ \n22  FAILURE TO EXERCISE ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT \n23  137.  The  following  named  Plaintiffs’  cases  illustrate  how  Defendants’ \n24  collective failures expose foster children in CFS’s custody to a substantial risk of \n25  harm and actual harm. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  -33-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 34 of 69   Page\nID #:179\n \n1  A.  Gary G. \n2  138.  Gary G. was born on December 8, 2021, and immediately placed in a \n3  Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (“NICU”), where he remained for about two weeks. \n4  He was connected to a ventilator due to his low Apgar score, difficulty breathing, \n5  syphilis exposure, and potential marijuana exposure. \n6  139.  Gary G.’s biological mother is incarcerated in Texas, and his biological \n7  father, who served 20 years in prison for aggravated robbery, is homeless and \n8  unemployed, residing in California. On December 24, 2021, Gary G. entered CFS’s \n9  custody. CFS then placed him with his current foster mother, who has an FFA-\n10  licensed foster home in Hesperia, California. \n11  140.  Gary G’s medical needs are complex and require ongoing treatment. \n12  He has an undersized head and vision issues, likely due to testing positive for syphilis \n13  at birth. To manage his condition, his foster mother takes him to Loma Linda \n14  University Medical Center every month for treatment. He has blood tests every two \n15  months, has had a preventive MRI, and has received an electroencephalogram. He \n16  needs ongoing treatment from a neurology specialist and an eye specialist. \n17  141.  Gary  G.  also  experiences  delayed  language  and  motor  skills \n18  development and suffers from muscle stiffness. He cannot yet wave or point, has \n19  delayed  babbling,  and  previously  wore  leg  braces  to treat  tip-toe  walking.  He \n20  requires infant speech, occupational, and physical therapy to aid his development. \n21  142.  Still, Gary G. has faced difficulty obtaining these necessary health \n22  services. His foster mother must travel up to two hours, multiple times per week, to \n23  take him to appointments with doctors and therapists. And Gary G. has been unable \n24  to receive occupational and physical therapy simultaneously. \n25  143.  In addition to these challenges, CFS has failed to adequately monitor \n26  Gary G.  In just over a year, CFS has assigned Gary G. five different caseworkers, \n27  with none lasting for more than two months. \n28 \n  -34-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 35 of 69   Page\nID #:180\n \n1  144.  Together, those caseworkers have made only six in-home visits, with \n2  the last in October 2022. All other visits occurred at CFS’s offices. CFS has not held \n3  a single CFT meeting for Gary G., and Gary G.’s caseworkers have failed to learn \n4  about his case plan or provide a copy to his foster mother despite her repeated \n5  requests. \n6  145.  In February 2022, clinicians recommended referring Gary G. to Inland \n7  Regional Center (“IRC”) to improve healthcare quality and reduce travel time for \n8  treatment.  Gary  G.’s  caseworkers  still  have  not  facilitated  the  referral,  despite \n9  repeated requests from his foster mother. \n10  146.  Gary G.’s caseworkers have ignored his foster mother’s calls, texts, and \n11  emails, and one caseworker failed to submit her IRC referral request. In March 2023, \n12  IRC placed Gary G’s case on “inactive status” after never receiving a response from \n13  his caseworker. \n14  147.  Gary G.’s permanency goal is reunification with his father, who is \n15  homeless, unemployed, and on probation for domestic violence charges. Despite \n16  this, CFS maintains that Gary G.’s father poses no safety risk to him. CFS also does \n17  not have a concurrent plan for him, as federal law requires. \n18  148.   Gary G.’s father does not appear to be following the requirements of \n19  his  reunification  plan.  He  has  not  provided  proof  of  completing  the  required \n20  parenting and domestic violence classes that his case plan requires and has not \n21  submitted proof for all the necessary drug tests. And, he has attended only 40 out of \n22  92 scheduled visits. \n23  149.  Gary G.’s father often exhibits erratic behavior during those visits and \n24  smells like marijuana. Gary G., in turn, has often appeared noticeably stressed while \n25  visiting his father. During one visit, he covered Gary G.’s head with a blanket, which \n26  caused Gary G. to suffer a head injury and visit Urgent Care. Gary G.’s foster mother \n27 \n28 \n  -35-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 36 of 69   Page\nID #:181\n \n1  has often warned CFS about these issues, but only once did CFS send a caseworker \n2  to supervise a visit with Gary G.’s father. \n3  150.  Indeed, Gary G. will likely need significant services for the next several \n4  years as healthcare providers monitor his improvement in areas such as head size, \n5  language and motor skills, and muscular development. \n6  151.  Gary G. needs a stable, permanent home, but CFS is not working to \n7  achieve that goal as required by state and federal law. CFS is not working with Gary \n8  G.’s father to determine whether he can provide a home for Gary G., nor is it working \n9  to develop an alternative concurrent plan, as federal law requires. \n10  B.  Xander B., Francesca B., and Delilah B. \n11  152.  Xander B. (born August 26, 2010), Francesca B. (born on August 4, \n12  2012), and Delilah B. (born on April 10, 2014) have been in and out of foster care \n13  since 2014 and continually in CFS’s custody since early 2016. All three children are \n14  siblings. Their mother died of a suspected drug overdose around May 2015. Around \n15  that same time, their father began sexually abusing Francesca B. and Delilah B., and \n16  possibly Xander B. as well. \n17  i.  2016 through July 2020: early placements. \n18  Xander B. \n19  153.  CFS placed Xander B. in three or four foster homes during his first few \n20  months in care. Each of these placements failed because CFS failed to identify foster \n21  parents who were prepared to care for Xander B.’s needs. In late 2016, CFS placed \n22  Xander B. in a group home in Desert Hot Springs, California, where he remained \n23  until 2020. \n24  154.  During the time Xander B. was at the group home, CFS assigned him \n25  four different caseworkers. These caseworkers rarely visited him in person and \n26  instead checked in with him over the phone roughly once per month. Xander B. had \n27  only one CFT meeting during his four years at the group home. \n28 \n  -36-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 37 of 69   Page\nID #:182\n \n1  155.  Moreover, the group home where CFS placed Xander B. was neither \n2  clean nor safe. Children wore dirty clothes, while the beds appeared to have bedbugs. \n3  Physical altercations were common among the children. And, Xander B. had many \n4  of his belongings stolen. \n5  156.  Around that period, doctors discovered that Xander B. suffers from \n6  Nephrotic syndrome, a type of kidney disease requiring daily medication and a low-\n7  sodium diet. From 2018 to 2020, he was hospitalized three times for this condition. \n8  157.   In the years since, Xander B. has also been diagnosed with a host of \n9  different  behavioral  conditions,  including  Intermittent  Explosive  Disorder, \n10  Oppositional  Defiance  Disorder  (“ODD”),  Post  Traumatic  Stress  Disorder \n11  (“PTSD”),  Attention  Deficit  Hyperactivity  Disorder  (“ADHD”),  and  Major \n12  Depressive Disorder. \n13  158.  The group home where CFS placed Xander B. did not properly treat his \n14  ailments. They did not accommodate his dietary needs and required him to buy \n15  supplemental food using the allowance the group home gave him. Further, neither \n16  CFS nor the group home has secured an Individualized Education Plan (“IEP”) or \n17  any other educational aid for him. \n18  Francesca B. and Delilah B. \n19  159.  Between 2016 and 2020, CFS placed Francesca B. in at least 8 and \n20  potentially up to 12 different foster homes. During that same period, CFS placed \n21  Delilah B. in at least 7 and potentially up to 11 different foster homes. While CFS \n22  sometimes placed the sisters together, it often separated them. \n23  160.  Between 2016 and 2020, Francesca B. and Delilah B. had at least four \n24  caseworkers. Those caseworkers collectively held only two CFT meetings in four \n25  years and failed to ensure that the girls had ongoing visits with each other (when \n26  apart) or with their brother. \n27 \n28 \n  -37-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 38 of 69   Page\nID #:183\n \n1  161.  At one point, CFS placed Francesca B. and Delilah B. with foster \n2  parents  who  repeatedly  beat the  girls  and held  their  heads  underwater. In  one \n3  altercation, the foster parents threw Delilah B. against a wall. As a result of this \n4  incident, Delilah B. suffered blunt force trauma to her head and left side, had cuts \n5  all over her head and neck, and broke a bone in her hand. \n6  162.  The abuses by their foster parents continued for months before the girls’ \n7  caseworker finally intervened. When Delilah B. did, eventually, visit the hospital, \n8  the doctor recommended a follow-up visit within 30 days to ensure proper healing, \n9  but the caseworker never brought her back. As a result, Delilah B. still walks with a \n10  limp and favors her non-broken hand. \n11  163.  Because of the abuse by their foster parents, both girls have lasting \n12  psychological injuries, and Delilah B. still struggles with water-related activities \n13  such as showering. In addition, the girls have ongoing trauma from their father’s \n14  sexual abuse. CFS has not provided them with the necessary services to deal with \n15  the traumas they have experienced. \n16  i.  July 2020 through December 2022: placement with the \n17  Stronas. \n18  164.  Colleen Strona  and  Thomas Strona,  the  children’s aunt and  uncle, \n19  sought to care for them as early as 2018, but CFS took over two years to complete \n20  the necessary paperwork. In July 2020, CFS finally placed all three children with the \n21  Stronas in Texas. The caseworkers provided the Stronas with incomplete health and \n22  education information and did not provide them with any of the children’s case \n23  plans. \n24  165.  While  in  the  Stronas’  care,  all  three  children  required  substantial \n25  medical, behavioral, and educational services. Xander B. struggled in school and \n26  exhibited frequent anger outbursts. At one point, Xander B. also acted out sexually \n27  toward his younger sisters. A psychiatrist eventually prescribed him medication for \n28 \n  -38-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 39 of 69   Page\nID #:184\n \n1  ADHD. In addition, he requires medication and a specialized diet for his Nephrotic \n2  syndrome. \n3  166.  Francesca B. also struggled academically and socially.  She had trouble \n4  discussing her feelings and would often shut down completely. She would also lie \n5  and steal. A psychiatrist diagnosed her with PTSD because of her past traumas. \n6  167.  Delilah B. also struggled academically, eventually having to repeat the \n7  first grade. She also had behavioral outbursts in which she would break objects. A \n8  psychiatrist diagnosed her with dyslexia, ODD, ADHD, and PTSD. \n9  168.  Around mid-2022, Delilah B. received a brain scan, which detected that \n10  she  was  experiencing  brain  tremors.  Her  psychiatrist  prescribed  anti-seizure \n11  medication  and  recommended  continued  evaluations.  She  also  concluded  that \n12  Delilah B. would require elevated care and likely need a caretaker for the rest of her \n13  life. \n14  169.  During this time, the children had infrequent contact with their two \n15  different CFS caseworkers. Caseworker visits occurred monthly over the telephone \n16  and lasted 10 to 15 minutes. During these calls, the caseworkers often forgot the \n17  children’s names and repeatedly asked about their biological parents, despite several \n18  reminders that their father was a sexual predator and their mother was dead. \n19  170.  Apart from these phone visits, caseworkers never provided the Stronas \n20  with the children’s case plans and never held a single CFT meeting for either Xander \n21  B. or the girls. CFS’s caseworkers were uncommunicative and did little to help the \n22  children obtain services. \n23  171.  Caseworkers also often ignored the Stronas’ calls, including warnings \n24  that  Xander  B.  had  stolen  alcohol  and  had  made  a  suicidal  gesture.  CFS’s \n25  caseworkers  also  never  provided  Delilah  B.’s  psychiatrist  with  the  necessary \n26  medical records and neglected to file  the required paperwork for Delilah B. to \n27  receive her ADHD and anti-seizure medication. \n28 \n  -39-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 40 of 69   Page\nID #:185\n \n1  172.  Without adequate help from CFS, the Stronas decided that they could \n2  not continue  caring for the  three  siblings. In December 2022, CFS transferred \n3  Xander B. to a group home in Chino County, California, and placed Delilah B. and \n4  Francesca B. in an FFA-foster home in Victorville, California. \n5  iii.  December 2022 through the present: recent placements. \n6  173.  The Stronas provided CFS with detailed medical information for all \n7  three children before releasing them. Despite this, Xander B. spent his first 30 days \n8  in his current home without his Nephrotic syndrome medication and is still not \n9  receiving medication for ADHD. \n10  174.  Francesca B. and Delilah B.’s placement in a foster home in Victorville \n11  was disrupted when the foster family’s dog attacked Delilah B., requiring six stitches \n12  on her face. CFS kept the girls in that home for three more weeks before moving \n13  them.  The  girls currently  reside  in  an  FFA-foster  home  in  Covina,  California.  \n14  Although Ms. Strona sent CFS all of their paperwork, CFS has yet to forward any of \n15  it to the new foster parents. \n16  175.  CFS  has  not  developed  a  permanent  or  concurrent  plan  for  these \n17  children, despite being required to do so by federal law. In addition, CFS is not \n18  providing all of the ongoing services Xander B. requires, which include a specialized \n19  diet  and  medication  for  his  nephrotic  syndrome,  medication  for  ADHD,  and \n20  therapeutic services for various behavioral issues. Both girls also require substantial \n21  ongoing services, which they are not receiving, and Delilah B. needs medication for \n22  seizures and medication. \n23  C.  Teddy H. \n24  176.  Teddy H. was born on March 5, 2019, and has been in CFS’s custody \n25  since April 2022 after police raided his mother’s home and found methamphetamine \n26  within close reach of him. He lives in a County-licensed foster family home in the \n27  County. Teddy H.’s biological father also has an extensive criminal history. \n28 \n  -40-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 41 of 69   Page\nID #:186\n \n1  177.  CFS  first  placed  Teddy  H.  with  a  foster  family  in  Victorville, \n2  California. About two weeks later, CFS moved Teddy H. to live with an adult cousin. \n3  At that placement, Teddy H. received a referral to IRC for speech therapy. After \n4  three months in  that  placement,  CFS  placed  Teddy  H.  with  his  stepmother in \n5  Palmdale, marking his third placement in just four months. \n6  178.  Teddy H.’s stepmother had cared for him for most of his life before he \n7  entered foster care. Even so, Teddy H.’s stepmother could not follow up on the IRC \n8  referral because she was not his educational rights holder.2 As a result, Teddy H. \n9  could not receive the speech therapy he required. \n10  179.  In March 2023, CFS removed Teddy H. from his stepmother’s home \n11  and placed him with another family in Victorville. As a result of CFS’s actions, \n12  Teddy H. has lost contact with his stepmother, who had been his primary caregiver \n13  for most of his life. \n14  180.  The caseworkers that CFS has assigned to Teddy H. have failed to \n15  adequately monitor his placements or engage in effective case planning. They have \n16  not held any CFT meetings for Teddy H., have never shown or discussed his case \n17  plan with any of his foster parents, and the current caseworker has not properly \n18  supervised Teddy H.’s visits with his parents. As a result of the failings of CFS and \n19  its caseworkers, on one occasion, Teddy H.’s father walked out of the CFS office \n20  with him. \n21  181.  What is more, CFS has not properly managed either Teddy H.’s service \n22  needs or permanency needs. CFS has provided no services to address Teddy H.’s \n23 \n \n24  2 Under California law, “[p]arents generally have the right to make educational \ndecisions for their children unless their child is in a legal guardianship, their child \n25 \nhas been freed for adoption (parental rights have been terminated), or the juvenile \n26  court has limited their educational rights.”  California Foster Care Education Law \nFact Sheets, California Foster Youth Education Task Force (February 2014) at 9, \n27 \nhttps://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/BTB_23_5O_11.pdf. \n28 \n  -41-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 42 of 69   Page\nID #:187\n \n1  delayed speech issues. And, CFS has failed to help Teddy H.’s father with his \n2  reunification plan. \n3  182.  In short, Teddy H. needs a stable, permanent home along with services \n4  to treat his delayed speech. But, CFS is not working with him, his relatives, or his \n5  caregivers to ensure that he receives the care that he needs. \n6  D.  Kevin E. and Sam E. \n7  183.  Kevin E. and Sam E. are twins born on January 20, 2010. They have \n8  been in CFS’s custody since 2017 due to their biological parents’ drug use. Their \n9  father is incarcerated. CFS has shuffled Kevin E. and Sam E. through several foster \n10  homes since they entered foster care. They have been in their current foster home \n11  since November 2022. \n12  184.  Kevin E. and Sam E.’s current foster parents have severely restricted \n13  the boys’ ability to communicate with friends and family. At the urging of CFS, they \n14  have not allowed the boys to have cell phones or use social media, and they took \n15  away Kevin E.’s tablet. They have instructed Kevin E. to avoid contacting Ms. \n16  Fromm, their next friend and someone with ongoing concerns about the boys’ safety \n17  and wellbeing. \n18  185.  CFS has also limited Kevin E. and Sam E.’s ability to visit friends and \n19  family outside their foster parents’ presence. At one CFT meeting, their caseworker \n20  told Ms. Fromm that Ms. Fromm’s daughter could only visit Kevin E. and Sam. E. \n21  in the presence of their foster parents. The boys’ grandparents are also only allowed \n22  to have supervised visits. \n23  186.  Kevin E. and Sam E. have had at least two caseworkers in the past six \n24  months,  both  of  whom  appeared  to  be  newly  hired  and  unable  to  adequately \n25  supervise or manage the boys. \n26  187.  Ms. Fromm has observed that the boys may require mental health \n27  services. For instance, Sam E. engages in attention-seeking and defiant behaviors, \n28 \n  -42-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 43 of 69   Page\nID #:188\n \n1  while Kevin E. behaves in a withdrawn manner and has made depressive statements \n2  such as “KMS” (“kill myself”). \n3  188.  And after six years in foster care, CFS has never shown Kevin E. or \n4  Sam E. their case plan or done anything to recognize the teenage boys’ own needs \n5  and preferences, as California law requires. Meanwhile, CFT meetings, when they \n6  have occurred, have failed to include all necessary parties. \n7  189.  One virtual CFT meeting proceeded without a representative from the \n8  boy’s  FFA,  the  boys’  grandparents  (who  were  not  even  invited),  or  the  boys \n9  themselves. And, during that meeting, the caseworker never brought up the boys’ \n10  case plan or permanency plans. \n11  190.  In another instance, the caseworker questioned whether Ms. Fromm \n12  should be allowed to attend CFT meetings even after Kevin E. specifically requested \n13  that she be included. \n14  191.  Kevin E. and Sam E. have expressed to Ms. Fromm that, after six years \n15  in foster care, they are losing hope and feel like no one cares about them. These boys \n16  are legally entitled to a clear permanency plan developed with their preferences in \n17  mind, a concurrent plan, and any necessary treatment to address their psychological \n18  issues. \n19  E.  Henry P. \n20  192.  Henry P. was born on July 13, 2007, and has been in CFS’s custody \n21  since December 2019. He lives in an FFA-licensed foster home in Huntington \n22  Beach, California. His biological father is incarcerated, and he has little contact with \n23  his biological mother. \n24  193.  When Henry P. and his siblings first entered foster care, CFS had them \n25  spend several days at a CFS office sleeping on cots. CFS then separated the siblings, \n26  sending Henry P., his biological brother, and his step-brother to one foster family \n27  home and his sisters to another. The placement quickly ended because CFS placed \n28 \n  -43-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 44 of 69   Page\nID #:189\n \n1  Henry P. with foster parents who spoke only Spanish and with whom Henry P. could \n2  not communicate. \n3  194.  Soon after, around February 2020, CFS moved Henry P., along with his \n4  biological  brother,  sister,  and  step-brother,  to  a  foster  parent  who  was  his \n5  stepmother’s friend. Henry P. struggled in this placement. He and his siblings were \n6  underfed and forced to spend most of the day outside, while the foster parent’s \n7  children had ample food and freedom to move about the house. \n8  195.  CFS eventually moved Henry P. to a group home in July 2021 after his \n9  previous foster parent claimed he was bullying his younger siblings. Those siblings \n10  remain in the last placement. \n11  196.  Henry  P.  had  a  “terrible”  experience  at  the  group  home.  The \n12  environment was unstable, and there was not adequate food for residents. Henry P. \n13  often ate only peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for days on end. CFS’s caseworkers \n14  visited him only four or five times during the 14 months he spent in that group home. \n15  197.  CFS  transferred  Henry  P.  to  a  foster  home  in  Huntington  Beach, \n16  California in September 2022 after that foster family took an interest in him through \n17  a mutual acquaintance. This family has done its best to care for Henry P. but has \n18  been consistently hampered by CFS. \n19  198.  CFS did not inspect the foster home before placing Henry P. there and \n20  did not timely transfer his files, leaving his foster parents unable to request medical \n21  assessments for weeks. \n22  199.  What  is  more,  Henry  P.  shows  signs  of  potentially  undiagnosed \n23  behavioral  issues,  but  CFS  has  not  identified  any  service  needs  or  provided \n24  information on prior assessments. His foster parents have requested  behavioral \n25  assessments, but CFS has made no referrals. \n26  200.  Nor  has  CFS  provided  Henry  P.’s  foster  parents  with  any  clear \n27  permanency goal, even though there is an open inter-state compact request to send \n28 \n  -44-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 45 of 69   Page\nID #:190\n \n1  him to live with an aunt in New York that has been pending for two years. Henry \n2  P.’s foster parents have  repeatedly requested  updates and  details, but CFS has \n3  provided none. \n4  201.  CFS’s caseworkers also do not visit Henry P. regularly. Henry P.’s \n5  previous caseworker contacted him only twice in seven months, and one of these \n6  meetings occurred on a video call. And the caseworker has not conducted any CFT \n7  meetings in his current foster home. \n8  202.  Nor has CFS facilitated any visits with Henry P.’s father or siblings, \n9  despite Henry P.’s repeated requests. In September 2022, his foster parents began \n10  requesting visits for Henry P. with his father, whom he has not seen since November \n11  2021. CFS only recently approved the visitation request in March 2023 but has not \n12  yet scheduled a visit. Henry P. has also not seen either of his brothers since July \n13  2021. \n14  203.  As of May 2023, Henry P. has no assigned caseworker. His previous \n15  caseworker appears to have been terminated for taking inappropriate photographs of \n16  children in his care. \n17  204.  As a result of CFS’s failures, Henry P.’s life is defined by uncertainty. \n18  Even though he is doing well in his current placement and receiving decent grades \n19  at his high school, he feels tremendous anxiety not knowing where he will be living \n20  or attending school next year. And, he does not have a meaningful connection with \n21  any of his prior caseworkers or anyone else at CFS to help guide him. \n22  205.  Henry P., at 15 years old, is at a critical juncture in his life where he \n23  needs structure and stability. His lack of caseworker visits and family visits, along \n24  with inadequate permanency and concurrent planning, expose him to a substantial \n25  risk of harm. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  -45-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 46 of 69   Page\nID #:191\n \n1  F.  David O., Greg R., and Arnold O.  \n2  206.  David O. (born on August 15, 2009), Greg R. (born September 27, \n3  2018), and Arnold O. (born March 6, 2021) are siblings who have been in CFS’s \n4  custody since March 2021. The children still have a relationship with their mother, \n5  who struggles with mental health-related issues, and each has varying degrees of \n6  contact with their fathers. \n7  207.  CFS placed the boys in four foster homes during their first two months \n8  in care. CFS later separated David O. from his brothers, eventually shuffling him \n9  through five more placements. As a result, David O. has had nine placements in just \n10  two years. Greg R. and Arnold O. each remain at their fourth placement. \n11  208.  Though the children have a Latinx heritage, they speak only English. \n12  Despite  this,  CFS  has  repeatedly  placed  them  in  Spanish-only  speaking  foster \n13  homes. In their first two placements, the foster parents spoke no English at all; in \n14  their third placement, only one family member spoke English. In Greg R. and Arnold \n15  O.’s current placement, only the older children speak English. \n16  209.  CFS has also failed to provide David O., Greg R., and Arnold O. with \n17  adequate planning and services and has assigned them five caseworkers in the past \n18  two years. These caseworkers have held only two CFT meetings in that time. Since \n19  separating David O. from his siblings, CFS has allowed only three visits among the \n20  brothers. Because of CFS’s failures in this regard, at one point, David O. went 14 \n21  months without seeing his brothers. \n22  i.  David O. \n23  210.  CFS moved David O. to his fifth placement after he complained that \n24  his prior foster parents’ adult child slapped him. Once again, CFS moved him to a \n25  foster home  where the  foster parents spoke  only Spanish. These foster parents \n26  expected David O. to handle all his laundry, cleaning, and cooking. As a result, \n27 \n28 \n  -46-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 47 of 69   Page\nID #:192\n \n1  David O. went weeks without clean clothes and suffered recurrent bowel problems \n2  from his poor diet. \n3  211.  Soon after, CFS placed David O. in yet another foster home. There, \n4  without proper vetting or monitoring by CFS’s caseworkers, the foster parents would \n5  verbally berate him. David O. reported the abuse to his grandmother, who relayed it \n6  to his caseworker. David O.’s caseworker never responded to this report of oral \n7  abuse, and soon after, the foster parent barred the grandmother from visiting David \n8  O. \n9  212.  In February 2023, CFS abruptly removed David O. from that placement \n10  and transferred him to a youth shelter that lacked adequate supervision. On David \n11  O.’s first night, he left with a 17-year-old boy who had stolen a car. After he was \n12  caught, police returned him to the shelter. On another occasion, a young woman \n13  brought a knife into the facility, assaulted David O., and stabbed another resident. \n14  213.  While David O. was at the shelter, his caseworker never provided him \n15  with necessary clothing, ensured he was enrolled in school, or arranged family visits. \n16  David O. could not even get a haircut because he lacked funds in his account. \n17  214.  In  February  2023,  CFS  moved  David  O.  to  his  ninth  and  current \n18  placement at a group home in Oakland, California. The group home is several \n19  hundred  miles  from  his  younger  brothers  and  nearly  1,000  miles  from  his \n20  grandmother’s home in Colorado. \n21  215.  David O. has many service needs. He was recently diagnosed with \n22  ADHD and PTSD and has a history of gastrointestinal issues. He also has untreated \n23  dental  problems,  requires  updated  corrective  lenses,  and  requires  additional \n24  psychological and medical services. \n25  ii.  Greg R. and Arnold O.  \n26  216.  CFS has not provided Greg R. and Arnold O.’s foster parents with any \n27  information about either of the boys’ medical needs. Greg R. is behind on his \n28 \n  -47-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 48 of 69   Page\nID #:193\n \n1  ongoing mental and physical health assessments, is overdue for dental follow-ups, \n2  and has untreated cavities. Moreover, he has food allergies and requires a special \n3  diet, which the current foster family does not provide. As a result, he has had trouble \n4  gaining weight. \n5  217.  Greg R. is not yet toilet-trained at four years old, and, lacking adequate \n6  supervision or guidance from CFS, his foster family has made no efforts to address \n7  this issue. As a result, he is not yet eligible for preschool, and his social skills are \n8  falling behind. \n9  218.  Arnold  O.  is  non-verbal,  has  delayed  motor  skills,  and  requires \n10  specialized  care,  including  occupational  therapy,  physical  therapy,  and  speech \n11  therapy. CFS has failed to provide him with timely mental health, physical health, \n12  and dental assessments and services. Arnold O. also exhibits behavioral issues, such \n13  as pulling his brother’s hair, biting, scratching, and throwing tantrums. \n14  219.  Greg  R.  and  Arnold  O.  need  medical,  behavioral,  dental,  and \n15  educational services that CFS is not providing. They also require placement in a \n16  home equipped to communicate with them properly. \n17  220.  David O., Greg R., and Arnold O. all need and are legally entitled to a \n18  permanent plan that will provide them with a permanent family and an appropriate, \n19  individualized concurrent plan and the services necessary to ensure such a placement \n20  will likely succeed. \n21  * * * \n22  221.  Defendants’ policies, patterns, practices, or customs have violated and \n23  will  continue  to  violate  these  children’s  rights  under  state  and  federal  laws. \n24  Inadequate  staffing,  for  instance,  prevents  CFS  caseworkers  from  adequately \n25  supervising  the  children  and  supporting  their  families  or  foster  parents.  And \n26  Defendants  are  keeping  these  children  in  unsuitable  homes  without  providing \n27  adequate case planning to ensure each child has both a clear permanent plan and \n28 \n  -48-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 49 of 69   Page\nID #:194\n \n1  alternate concurrent plan, as well as the necessary services that state and federal laws \n2  require. These children thus have all been harmed and all remain at risk of continued \n3  suffering and irreparable harm. \n4  / / / \n5  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n6  222.  This action is proper as a class action under Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2) \n7  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n8  223.  This action consists of one general class and one subclass: \n9  a)  all children for whom CFS has or will have legal responsibility \n10  and who are or will be in CFS’s legal and physical custody (“General Class”); \n11  b)  all  children  who  are  or  will  be  in  CFS’s  custody  and  have \n12  physical, cognitive, and/or psychological disabilities (“ADA Subclass”). \n13  224.  Each class is numerous enough to make joinder impracticable: \n14  a)  The  General  Class  consists  of  around  5,771  children  who \n15  currently are in or will enter CFS’s custody; \n16  b)  The  ADA  Subclass  consists  of  hundreds  of  children  with \n17  disabilities who are already in or will enter CFS’s custody. \n18  225.  The questions of fact and law that the Plaintiffs raise are common to \n19  and typical of those of each putative member of the General Class and ADA Subclass \n20  whom they seek to represent. \n21  226.  The  named  Plaintiffs  rely  on  the  State  Defendants  and  County \n22  Defendants for foster care services in San Bernardino County and wholly depend on \n23  them to provide those services. \n24  227.  Defendants’ long-standing and well-documented actions and inactions \n25  substantially  depart  from  accepted  professional  judgment  and  standards  and \n26  constitute deliberate indifference to the harm and risk of harm to and violations of \n27 \n28 \n  -49-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 50 of 69   Page\nID #:195\n \n1  the Plaintiffs and their legal rights and those of the General Class and ADA Subclass \n2  they represent. \n3  228.  Common questions of fact to the General Class and ADA Subclass \n4  include: \n5  a)  whether  the  State  Defendants and  County Defendants fail to \n6  protect the General Class from physical and psychological harm and risk of \n7  harm; \n8  b)  whether the State Defendants and County Defendants provide \n9  adequate caseworker resources to ensure that members of the General Class \n10  and ADA Subclass routinely meet with caseworkers face-to-face, receive \n11  individualized case plans, and receive all necessary services to enable the \n12  General Class and ADA Subclass to avoid harm and the risk of harm; \n13  c)  whether the County Defendants take steps required to initiate \n14  termination of parental rights proceedings for all children who have been in \n15  foster care for 15 out of the last 22 months unless there is a compelling reason \n16  why that would not be in the child’s best interests as documented in the record, \n17  or the child is otherwise eligible for a statutory exception; and \n18  d)  whether the State Defendants and County Defendants operate a \n19  system  that  adequately  tailors  appropriate  placements,  treatments,  and \n20  supports to the individual needs of the members of the General Class and \n21  ADA Subclass; \n22  e)  whether the State Defendants and County Defendants operate a \n23  system that provides an adequate number and diversity of placements to \n24  permit the members of the General Class and ADA Subclass to reside in the \n25  least restrictive and most family-like environment; \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  -50-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 51 of 69   Page\nID #:196\n \n1  f)  whether the State Defendants and County Defendants operate a \n2  system  that  promptly  and  adequately  assesses  the  individual  needs  of \n3  members of the General Class and ADA Subclass; \n4  g)  whether the State Defendants and County Defendants deprive \n5  members of the ADA Subclass of necessary and appropriate services to ensure \n6  access to home and community-based placements and supports so that they \n7  can fully benefit from foster care services. \n8  229.  Common questions of law to the General Class and ADA Subclass \n9  include: \n10  a)  whether the State Defendants and County Defendants’ systemic \n11  failures violate Plaintiffs’ rights under the Adoption Assistance and Child \n12  Welfare Act, as amended by the Adoption and Safe Families Act, including \n13  their right to placement in the least restrictive, most family-like setting, closest \n14  to their home community that conforms to professional standards, placement \n15  with relatives whenever possible, access to necessary services to protect their \n16  safety and health, and comprehensive written case plans, along with a case \n17  review system ensuring those case plans are in place and are updated, and \n18  their right to permanency by seeking the termination of parental rights after \n19  they have been in custody for 15 out of the last 22 months, subject to certain \n20  exceptions; \n21  b)  whether  the  County  Defendants’  systemic  failures  violate \n22  Plaintiffs’ rights under the California Welfare and Institutions Code, including \n23  their right to comprehensive written case plans, along with a case review \n24  system ensuring those case plans are in place and are updated; and  \n25  c)  whether the State Defendants and County Defendants’ systemic \n26  failures violate Plaintiffs’ substantive rights under the Due Process Clause of \n27  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  including \n28 \n  -51-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 52 of 69   Page\nID #:197\n \n1  exposing  children  to  neglect,  abuse,  trauma,  harmful  and  inadequate \n2  placements, lack of necessary services, and lack of permanency planning; \n3  d)  whether  the  County  Defendants’  systemic  failures  violate \n4  Plaintiffs’ substantive rights under Article I of the California Constitution, \n5  including exposing children to neglect, abuse, trauma, harmful and inadequate \n6  placements, lack of necessary services, and lack of permanency planning; \n7  e)  whether the State Defendants and County Defendants’ systemic \n8  failures  violate  Plaintiffs’  rights  under  the  First  Amendment’s  right  of \n9  association  and  right  to  a  permanent  family,  along  with  the  Ninth \n10  Amendment’s  reservation  of  rights  to  the  people,  and  the  Fourteenth \n11  Amendment’s right to due process; \n12  f)  whether the State Defendants and County Defendants’ systemic \n13  failures violate the ADA Subclass Plaintiffs’ rights under (1) the Americans \n14  with Disabilities Act; (2) the Rehabilitation Act; and (3) all regulations issued \n15  to implement the above laws; \n16  g)  whether the County Defendants’ systemic failures violate the \n17  ADA Subclass Plaintiffs’ rights under the California Government Code. \n18  230.  The violations of law and resulting harms that Plaintiffs allege are \n19  typical of the legal violations and harms or risk of harm that all children in the \n20  General Class and ADA Subclass experience. \n21  231.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly protect the interests of the General \n22  Class and ADA Subclass they seek to represent. \n23  232.  Defendants have acted or failed to act on grounds generally applicable \n24  to all members of the General Class or, where appropriate, ADA Subclass, requiring \n25  class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief. \n26  233.  Counsel for Plaintiffs know of no conflict among the class members. \n27 \n28 \n  -52-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 53 of 69   Page\nID #:198\n \n1  234.

Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate each allegation in this First Amended \n16 \nComplaint. \n17 \n236.  Federal law gives Plaintiffs specific rights under the AACWA. \n18 \n237.  Defendants’ foregoing policies, patterns, practices, or customs deprive \n19 \nPlaintiffs of their rights under the AACWA, as amended by the ASFA, to: \n20 \na)  placement in the least restrictive and most family-like setting, \n21 \nclosest to their home community that conforms to nationally recommended \n22 \nprofessional standards, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(5)(A); \n23 \nb)  access to quality services to protect their safety and health, 42 \n24 \nU.S.C. § 671(a)(22); \n25 \nc)  a  written  case  plan  that  includes  a  plan  to  provide  safe, \n26 \nappropriate, and stable placements, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(A); \n27 \n28 \n  -53-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 54 of 69   Page\nID #:199\n \n1  d)  a written case plan that ensures that they receive safe and proper \n2  care  while  in  foster  care  and  implementation  of  that  plan,  42  U.S.C. \n3  §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(B); \n4  e)  a  written  case  plan that ensures  the  provision of services to \n5  themselves, their parents, and their foster parents to facilitate reunification, or \n6  where that is not practicable, their permanent placement and implementation \n7  of that case plan, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(B);  \n8  f)  a case review system in which each Plaintiff has a case plan \n9  designed to achieve safe and appropriate foster care placements in the least \n10  restrictive and most family-like setting, close to their home community, 42 \n11  U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(5)(A); and \n12  g)  the right to have a petition to terminate parental rights filed if the \n13  Plaintiff has been in foster care for 15 out of the last 22 months unless doing \n14  so would be against their best interest as documented in the case record or a \n15  statutory exemption applies. 42 U.S.C. § 675(5)(E). \n16  238.  These provisions are intended to benefit Plaintiffs and members of the \n17  General Class and ADA Subclass. The rights conferred by these provisions are \n18  neither vague nor amorphous, such as to strain judicial competence, and the statute \n19  imposes a binding obligation on the states. 42 U.S.C. § 1983; see also Henry A. v. \n20  Willden, 678 F.3d 991, 1008–09 (9th Cir. 2012). \n21  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nCal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 16501.1, 16503(a), et seq.–State Statutory Rights (On \n22 \nBehalf of the General Class Against County Defendants) \n23 \n239.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate each allegation in this First Amended \n24 \nComplaint. \n25 \n240.

Gov’t Code § 815.6. \n3  241.  State law imposes specific mandatory duties on the County Defendants \n4  under the California Welfare and Institutions Code. \n5  242.  The  County  Defendants’  foregoing  policies,  patterns,  practices,  or \n6  customs deprive Plaintiffs of their rights in the California Welfare and Institutions \n7  Code, including: \n8  a)  the right to have “[a] written case plan . . . completed within a \n9  maximum of 60 days of the initial removal of the child,” Cal. Welf. & Inst. \n10  Code § 16501.1(e); \n11  b)  the right to have the case plan updated “no less frequently than \n12  once every six months,” and for “[e]ach updated case plan [to] include a \n13  description of the services that have been provided to the child under the plan \n14  and an evaluation of the appropriateness and effectiveness of those services,” \n15  id.; \n16  c)  the right to have the case plan “identify specific goals and the \n17  appropriateness of the planned services in meeting those goals,” Cal. Welf. & \n18  Inst. Code § 16501.1(g)(2); \n19  d)  the  right  to  have  the  case  plan  “include  provisions  for  the \n20  development and maintenance of sibling relationships,” Cal. Welf. & Inst. \n21  Code § 16501.1(g)(6); \n22  e)  the right to have the case plan “ensure the educational stability \n23  of the child while in foster care,” Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 16501.1(g)(8); \n24  f)  if the child’s permanency goal is reunification, the right to have \n25  the case plan “describe the services to be provided to assist in reunification,” \n26  Cal.

Code § 16501.1(g)(10); \n27 \n28 \n  -55-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 56 of 69   Page\nID #:201\n \n1  g)  if the child’s permanency goal is not reunification, the right to \n2  have the case plan “include a statement of the child’s wishes regarding their \n3  permanent placement plan and an assessment of those stated wishes” Cal. \n4  Welf. & Inst. Code § 16501.1(g)(15); \n5  h)  the right to have “the agency responsible for placement and care \n6  of a minor . . . ensure that a child in foster care . . . receive[s] administrative \n7  reviews periodically but no less frequently than once every six months,” Cal. \n8  Welf. & Inst. Code § 16503(a); and \n9  i)  the  right  to  have  the  administrative  review  “determine  the \n10  appropriateness of the placement, the continuing appropriateness and extent \n11  of compliance with the permanent plan for the child, the extent of compliance \n12  with the case plan, and adequacy of services provided to the child.” Cal. Welf. \n13  & Inst. Code § 16503(a). \n14  243.  These provisions are intended to benefit Plaintiffs and the classes they \n15  represent. The rights they confer are neither vague nor amorphous, such as to strain \n16  judicial competence, and the statute imposes a binding obligation on the states. \n17  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n42 U.S.C. § 1983–Federal Right to Substantive Due Process (On Behalf of the \n18 \nGeneral Class Against State Defendants and County Defendants) \n19 \n244.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate each allegation in this First Amended \n20 \nComplaint. \n21 \n245.  States  and  municipal  entities  assume  affirmative  duties  under  the \n22 \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution to provide reasonable care \n23 \nand protect from harm any child with whom they have formed a special relationship, \n24 \nsuch as children in foster care. \n25 \n246.  These substantive due process rights include, but are not limited to: \n26 \na)  the right to freedom from the foreseeable risk of maltreatment \n27 \nwhile under the protective supervision of the State; \n28 \n  -56-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 57 of 69   Page\nID #:202\n \n1  b)  the  right  to  protection  from  unnecessary  intrusions  into  the \n2  child’s  emotional  wellbeing  once  the  State  has  established  a  special \n3  relationship with that child; \n4  c)  the right to services necessary to prevent unreasonable risk of \n5  harm in the least restrictive environment; \n6  d)  the right to conditions and duration of foster care reasonably \n7  related to the purpose and assumption of government custody; \n8  e)  the right to treatment and care consistent with the purpose and \n9  assumptions of government custody; \n10  f)  the right not to be maintained in custody longer than is necessary \n11  to accomplish the purpose to be served by taking a child into government \n12  custody; and \n13  g)  the right to receive or be reunited with an appropriate permanent \n14  home and family within a reasonable period. \n15  247.  Defendants  have  developed  and  maintained  policies,  patterns, \n16  practices,  or  customs  that  represent  a  substantial  departure  from  accepted \n17  professional judgment and standards and deprive all members of the General Class \n18  their constitutionally-protected rights. \n19  248.  Defendants know that these policies, patterns, practices, or customs \n20  exist and harm these class members, yet are deliberately indifferent to the harm they \n21  cause. As a result, all the members of the General Class have been, and are at \n22  substantial risk of being, deprived of their constitutional rights. \n23  FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nArt. I, §7(a) Cal. Const.–State Right to Substantive Due Process (On Behalf of \n24 \nthe General Class Against County Defendants) \n25 \n249.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate each allegation in this First Amended \n26 \nComplaint. \n27 \n28 \n  -57-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 58 of 69   Page\nID #:203\n \n1  250.  Municipal entities assume affirmative duties under Article I of the \n2  California Constitution to provide care and protect from reasonable harm any child \n3  with whom it has formed a special relationship, such as those in foster care. \n4  251.  County Defendants have developed and maintained policies, patterns, \n5  practices, or customs that substantially depart from accepted professional judgment \n6  and deprive all members of the General Class of their constitutionally-protected \n7  rights. \n8  252.  Defendants know that these policies, patterns, practices, or customs \n9  exist and harm these class members, yet are deliberately indifferent to them. As a \n10  result, all the members of the General Class have been, and are at substantial risk of \n11  being, deprived of their constitutional rights. \n12  FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n42 U.S.C. § 1983–Federal Right to Family Association (On Behalf of the \n13 \nGeneral Class Against State Defendants and County Defendants) \n14 \n253.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate each allegation in this First Amended \n15 \nComplaint. \n16 \n254.  The First Amendment’s right of association and right to a permanent \n17 \nfamily, along with the Ninth Amendment’s reservation of rights to the people, and \n18 \nthe  Fourteenth  Amendment’s  right  to  due  process,  impose  on  states  and \n19 \nmunicipalities affirmative duties to provide reasonable efforts to obtain a permanent \n20 \nhome and family. \n21 \n255.  The General Class members are in Defendants’ custody or guardianship \n22 \nand depend on Defendants to provide for their basic physical, psychological, and \n23 \nemotional needs and to protect them from physical, psychological, and emotional \n24 \nharm. \n25 \n256.  These  class  members  frequently  and  foreseeably  suffer  physical, \n26 \npsychological, and  emotional harm in CFS’s custody.  This harm occurs partly \n27 \n28 \n  -58-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 59 of 69   Page\nID #:204\n \n1  because these class members are continually shuttled between temporary and often \n2  non-familial custodial arrangements. \n3  257.  Therefore, professional judgment and standards of conduct require the \n4  Defendants to make reasonable efforts toward placing children in their custody in \n5  stable, permanent families. \n6  258.  Defendants  know  the  General  Class  members  have  a  right  to  a \n7  permanent home and family yet have failed to make reasonable efforts to achieve \n8  this. \n9  259.  Defendants’  foregoing  policies,  patterns,  practices,  or  customs \n10  represent  a  substantial  departure  from  professional  judgment  and  deliberate \n11  indifference to the General Class members’ constitutional rights. \n12  260.  As a result, the General Class members of the General Class have been, \n13  and are at risk of being, deprived of their right to familial association and reasonable \n14  protection from physical, psychological, and emotional harm while in Defendants’ \n15  custody. This violates the First Amendment’s freedom of association, the Ninth \n16  Amendment’s reservation of rights to the people, and the Fourteenth Amendment’s \n17  substantive due process protections. \n18  SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq. –The Americans with Disabilities Act  \n19 \n(On Behalf of the ADA Subclass Against State Defendants and County \n20  Defendants) \n21 \n261.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate each allegation in this First Amended \n22 \nComplaint. \n23 \n262.  Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131,  et seq., and its enabling \n24 \nregulations,  28  C.F.R.  35.101  et  seq.  (2022),  prohibit  public  entities  from \n25 \ndiscriminating against individuals with disabilities because of their disability. \n26 \n263.  Specifically, “[n]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason \n27 \nof such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the \n28 \n  -59-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 60 of 69   Page\nID #:205\n \n1  services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination \n2  by any such entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n3  264.  Members of the ADA Subclass experience physical, cognitive, and \n4  psychological disabilities that qualify them as individuals with disabilities under the \n5  ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2). \n6  265.  Defendants are public entities and public officials of those entities, and \n7  all are subject to the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1)(A)–(B). \n8  266.  Under the regulations implementing the ADA, public entities may not, \n9  directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements,  do any of the \n10  following based on an individual’s disability: \n11  a)  “[d]eny a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to \n12  participate  in  or  benefit  from  aid,  benefit,  or  service,”  28  C.F.R.  § \n13  35.130(b)(1)(i); \n14  b)  “[a]fford a qualified individual with a disability an opportunity \n15  to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to \n16  that afforded others,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(ii); \n17  c)  “[p]rovide a qualified individual with a disability with an aid, \n18  benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to \n19  obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of \n20  achievement as that provided to others,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(iii); \n21  d)  “[a]id or perpetuate discrimination against a qualified individual \n22  with  a  disability  by  providing  significant  assistance  to  an  agency, \n23  organization,  or  person  that  discriminates  on  the  basis  of  disability  in \n24  providing any aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries of the public entity’s \n25  program,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(v); or \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  -60-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 61 of 69   Page\nID #:206\n \n1  e)  “[o]therwise limit a qualified individual with a disability in the \n2  enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others \n3  receiving the aid, benefit, or service,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(1)(vii). \n4  267.  A public entity also may not use criteria or methods of administration \n5  that: \n6  a)  “have  the  effect  of  subjecting  qualified  individuals  with \n7  disabilities to discrimination based on disability,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(i); \n8  b)  “have  the  purpose  or  effect  of  defeating  or  substantially \n9  impairing the accomplishments of the objectives of the public entity's program \n10  with respect to individuals with disabilities,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(ii); or \n11  c)  “perpetuate the discrimination of another public entity if both \n12  public entities are subject to common administrative control or are agencies \n13  of the same State,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(iii). \n14  268.  Instead, the public entity is required to “make reasonable modifications \n15  in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid \n16  discrimination on the basis of disability[.]” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7)(i). \n17  269.  Defendants,  however,  through  their  foregoing  policies,  patterns, \n18  practices, or customs, have discriminated against the members of the ADA Subclass \n19  based on their disabilities in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n20  270.  As a result, the ADA Subclass members have suffered injuries, are at \n21  risk of suffering injuries, and will continue to be at risk of suffering further injuries \n22  unless Defendants are required to comply with applicable law. \n23  SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n29 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.–The Rehabilitation Act \n24 \n(On Behalf of the ADA Subclass Against State Defendants and County \n25  Defendants) \n26 \n271.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate each allegation in this First Amended \n27 \nComplaint. \n28 \n  -61-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 62 of 69   Page\nID #:207\n \n1  272.  Like the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act and its implementing regulations \n2  prohibit  entities  receiving  federal  funding  from  excluding  individuals  with \n3  disabilities or from discriminating against individuals because of their disabilities. \n4  29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n5  273.  Under the regulations implementing the Rehabilitation Act, covered \n6  entities may not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, \n7  do any of the following based on disability: \n8  a)  “[d]eny a qualified [individual with a disability] the opportunity \n9  to  participate  in  or  benefit  from  aid,  benefit,  or  service,”  45  C.F.R.  § \n10  84.4(b)(1)(i); see also 45 C.F.R. §84.52(a)(1); \n11  b)  “[a]fford a qualified [individual with a disability] an opportunity \n12  to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to \n13  that  afforded  others,”  28  C.F.R.  §  84.4(b)(1)(ii);  see  also  45  C.F.R. \n14  §84.52(a)(2); \n15  c)  “[p]rovide a qualified [individual with a disability] with an aid, \n16  benefit, or service that is not as effective as that provided to others,” 28 C.F.R. \n17  § 84.4(b)(1)(iii), (2); see also 45 C.F.R. §84.52(a)(3); \n18  d)  “[p]rovide benefits or services in a manner that limits or has the \n19  effect of limiting the participation of qualified [individuals with disabilities],” \n20  45 C.F.R. §84.52(a)(4); \n21  e)  “[a]id or perpetuate discrimination against a qualified [individual \n22  with  a  disability]  by  providing  significant  assistance  to  an  agency, \n23  organization,  or  person  that  discriminates  on  the  basis  of  [disability]  in \n24  providing any aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries of the [covered entity’s] \n25  program,” 28 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(1)(v); or \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  -62-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 63 of 69   Page\nID #:208\n \n1  f)  “[o]therwise limit a qualified [individual with a disability] in the \n2  enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others \n3  receiving an aid, benefit, or service.” 28 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(1)(vii). \n4  274.  A public entity also may not use criteria or methods of administration \n5  that: \n6  a)  “have  the  effect  of  subjecting  qualified  [individuals  with \n7  disabilities]  to  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  [disability],”  28  C.F.R.  § \n8  84.4(b)(4)(i); \n9  b)  “have  the  purpose  or  effect  of  defeating  or  substantially \n10  impairing  accomplishments  of  the  objectives  of  the  [covered  entity’s] \n11  program or activity with respect to [individuals with disabilities],” 28 C.F.R. \n12  § 84.4(b)(ii); or \n13  c)  “perpetuate the discrimination of another [covered entity] if both \n14  public entities are subject to common administrative control or are agencies \n15  of the same State,” 28 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(iii). \n16  275.  Members  of  the  ADA  Subclass  have  physical,  cognitive,  and \n17  psychological disabilities that make them qualified  individuals with disabilities \n18  under the Rehabilitation Act. 29 U.S.C. § 705(20). \n19  276.  The  Defendants  receive  substantial  federal  funding  to  operate  the \n20  statewide foster care system, and CDSS and CFS’s operations constitute a “program \n21  or activity” under the Rehabilitation Act. 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), (b)(1)(A). \n22  277.  For  all  the  reasons  set  forth  above,  Defendants  have  violated  the \n23  Rehabilitation Act by failing to provide foster children with disabilities an equal \n24  opportunity to participate in foster care services detailed above. \n25  278.  As  a  result  of  Defendants’  past  and  ongoing  violations  of  the \n26  Rehabilitation Act, the ADA Subclass members have suffered injuries, are at risk of \n27 \n28 \n  -63-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 64 of 69   Page\nID #:209\n \n1  suffering injury, and will continue to be at risk of suffering further injuries unless \n2  Defendants are required to comply with applicable law. \n3  EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nCal. Gov’t Code § 11135 et seq., Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2 § 11140 et seq.–State \n4 \nRight Against Unlawful State Discrimination (On Behalf of the ADA Subclass \n5  Against County Defendants) \n6 \n279.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate each allegation in this First Amended \n7 \nComplaint. \n8 \n280.  The  County  Defendants  have  discriminated  against  Plaintiffs  and \n9 \nmembers of the ADA Subclass by failing to make reasonable modifications in their \n10 \npolicies, patterns, practices, or customs that would allow them to participate in and \n11 \nbenefit from the County Defendants’ foster care and health services. \n12 \n281.  Reasonable  modification  of  County  Defendants’  policies,  patterns, \n13 \npractices, or customs would not fundamentally alter the nature of their services, \n14 \nprograms, or activities but would further their stated goals. \n15 \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n16 \nWHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs request that this Honorable Court: \n17 \nI.  Assert jurisdiction over this action. \n18 \nII.  Order that Plaintiffs may maintain this action as a class action under Rule \n19 \n23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n20 \nIII.

Defendants’ violation of ADA Subclass Plaintiffs’ rights under the \n6  ADA; \n7  g.  Defendants’ violation of ADA Subclass Plaintiffs’ rights under  the \n8  Rehabilitation Act; \n9  h.  County Defendants’ violation of ADA Subclass Plaintiffs’ rights under \n10  the California Government Code. \n11  IV.  Permanently enjoin Defendants from subjecting Plaintiffs to practices that \n12  violate their rights, including: \n13  a.  requiring  the  County  Defendants  to  maintain  caseloads  for  each \n14  caseworker  providing  direct  supervision  and  planning  for  children \n15  following accepted professional standards, as developed by either the \n16  COA or the CWLA;

\n24  d.  requiring the County Defendants to describe, in each child’s written \n25  case plan, steps for reunification with the child’s parents, adoption, or \n26  another permanent, family-like setting;

\n21  l.  requiring the County Defendants to ensure CFS caseworkers conduct \n22  in-home visits at least once per month, during which caseworkers will \n23  thoroughly  inspect  the  home  and  interview  the  foster  children \n24  separately from the foster parents; \n25  m.  requiring the County Defendants to file and proceed with a timely \n26  petition to free a child for adoption when the child’s permanency plan \n27  is adoption unless the child’s case plan documents that doing so is not \n28 \n  -66-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 67 of 69   Page\nID #:212\n \n1  in the child’s best interest or that the child has a statutory exemption \n2  from this requirement;

\n25  s.  requiring  the  State  Defendants  and  County  Defendants  to  conduct \n26  annual  case  record  reviews  of  a  statistically  significant  sample  of \n27  children in CFS’s custody to measure how likely children in CFS’s \n28 \n  -67-   \n \n  FIRST AMENDE COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 5:23-cv-00947-MEMF-BFM     Document 34     Filed 08/14/23     Page 68 of 69   Page\nID #:213\n \n1  custody are to receive timely permanence under federal law, how often \n2  they are maltreated in care, and how placement stability is maintained \n3  for these children;
