    "summary": "<p>This is a lawsuit alleging racially discriminatory treatment of customers at Sesame Place, an amusement park operated by SeaWorld.</p>\r\n<p>On July 27, 2022, a private African-American plaintiff, individually and on behalf of a minor, and on behalf of a class of similarly situated individuals (collectively, &ldquo;Burns&rdquo;), represented by private counsel, sued SeaWorld Parks &amp; Entertainment, Inc, Sesame Place Philadelphia, SeaWorld Parks &amp; Entertainment LLC, and four private defendants (collectively, &ldquo;SeaWorld&rdquo;) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The plaintiff bought two tickets to Sesame Place Philadelphia, owned and operated by SeaWorld Parks &amp; Entertainment, which included a &ldquo;meet-and-greet&rdquo; with SeaWorld&rsquo;s costume character performers. According to the plaintiff, the costume characters interacted with the white customers but refused to engage with them and ignored all African-American guests in attendance. The plaintiff alleged that this refusal constituted racial discrimination in violation of Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1886 (&ldquo;Section 1981&rdquo;), and breach of contract and negligence under Pennsylvania common law. Burns sought class certification; declaratory and injunctive relief requiring SeaWorld to implement rigorous anti-discrimination training, educational, and screening policies for its employees; and compensatory, punitive, actual, and statutory damages totaling $25,000,000. This case was assigned to District Judge Wendy Beetlestone and Magistrate Judge Richard A. Lloret.</p>\r\n<p>On September 28, 2022, Burns filed an amended complaint to include seven additional named plaintiffs, and to bring this suit on behalf of 89 families involving 125 children. This new complaint maintained the Section 1981 and negligence claims, but no longer included the break of contract claim. Lastly, this new complaint increased the damages amount to $50,000,000.</p>\r\n<p>On November 2, 2022, SeaWorld filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and for lack of jurisdiction. SeaWorld argued that the admission ticket was not a contract that entitled customers to personal interactions with the costumed character, but instead was a revocable license. Second, Burns did not allege that the costume characters treated them differently. Third, Burns negligence claim should fail because Burns failed to identify any applicable legal duty and made only conclusory allegations about breach without providing factual support. Lastly, SeaWorld argued that because Burns had no intention of ever returning to Sesame Place, they were not likely to be injured again. Thus, Burns had no standing and the request for injunctive relief should be dismissed accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 5, 2023, the court granted in part and denied in part SeaWorld&rsquo;s motion to dismiss. Judge Beedlestone found that the Section 1981 claim survived because Burns adequately alleged that the admission ticket did give some contractual rights and that their contract interest was impaired. Regarding the negligence claim, the court dismissed with prejudice the negligent hiring and negligent training theories, dismissed without prejudice the negligent supervision claim, but kept the negligence per se theory because Burns adequately alleged that Section 1981 applied to SeaWorld&rsquo;s conduct, that SeaWorld violated Section 1981, and that this violation caused Burns&rsquo; injuries. Lastly, the court found that Burns could seek injunctive relief because one of the named plaintiffs bought season passes that were not expired at the time of this suit, so there was sufficient standing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 8, 2023, a special master was appointed in this case, who submitted reports and recommendations to the court throughout the duration of this case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 27, 2023, Burns filed a motion to certify a class for all African-American or Hispanic persons who, since July 27, 2018, either directly or as a third-party beneficiary, entered into contracts with SeaWorld by purchasing admission tickets into Sesame Place Philadelphia.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On December 18, 2023, SeaWorld filed a motion for summary judgment. First, SeaWorld argued that under Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, any claims for race discrimination at a place of public accommodations must be brought in front of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, and not as a common law claim in court. None of the named plaintiffs filed a complaint with the proper authority, thus this court was precluded from deciding the negligence per se claim. Second, SeaWorld confirmed during discovery that none of the plaintiffs had any concrete plans to return to Sesame Place so none of them had injunctive relief standing. Third, Burns failed to show that the costumed characters refused to interact with them for a discriminatory reason so there was no discriminatory intent as required for their Section 1981 claim. Lastly, SeaWorld argued that Burns cannot show any violation of a contractual right, because the right not to be discriminated against is provided by state and federal law, and not by the contract at issue here.</p>\r\n<p>On February 5, 2024, Burns filed a motion to file a second amended complaint. Burns claimed that discovery revealed additional facts that would allow them to re-plead their negligent supervision of SeaWorld employees. Additionally, discovery revealed discriminatory practices by SeaWorld employees in situations other than costume character interactions with patrons of color, and thus sought to amend the class definition.</p>\r\n<p>On March 8, 2024, the court granted adding the negligent supervision claim, but denied the claim regarding behavior by employees not involved in performing as costumed characters.</p>\r\n<p>On April 15, 2024, the court denied certifying the class because Burns did not carry their burden of proving numerosity, cohesiveness, or that their proposed class was appropriate for certification.</p>\r\n<p>On April 17, 2024, Judge Beetlestone granted in part and denied in part SeaWorld&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment. The court found that one of the private plaintiffs had a bona fide intention to return to Sesame Place, so Burns continued to have standing to seek injunctive relief. The court granted summary judgment in whole or in part for each of the private plaintiffs&rsquo; Section 1981 claims based on whether the plaintiff could cast doubt on SeaWorld&rsquo;s proffered nondiscriminatory explanation for its employee&rsquo;s conduct. Lastly, the court granted summary judgment on the negligent supervision claim because no rational factfinder could conclude on this record that any Sesame Place employee was acting outside the scope of their employment when any alleged discrimination took place.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 1, 2024, one of the private plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration because the court allegedly dismissed all their claims based on a wrong understanding of the facts because the court overlooked a video that provided evidence their family was treated discriminatorily. On May 2, the court granted the motion and reinstated plaintiffs as party to this case.</p>\r\n<p>On May 6, 2024, the jury trial began. On September 4, 2024, SeaWorld filed a motion for sanctions. The Clearinghouse does not have access to this motion at this time.</p>\r\n<p>On September 18, 2024, the jury found in favor of SeaWorld.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 24, 2024, the court denied SeaWorld&rsquo;s motion for sanctions. Burns argued that while each of the private plaintiffs presented evidence establishing prima facie cases of racial discrimination, SeaWorld failed to produce any direct evidence about the state of mind of the employees who were in the character costumes when the alleged discrimination happened, which taken as true, would permit the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for the lack of interaction between the child plaintiffs and the costumed character.</p>\r\n<p>On October 16, 2024, Burns filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law. The Clearinghouse does not have access to this motion at this time.</p>\r\n<p>On October 21, 2024, SeaWorld appealed the denial of their motion for sanctions to the Third Circuit of Appeals. On October 23, 2024, the Appeals Court stayed this appeal until after the motion for judgment as a matter of law was decided.</p>\r\n<p>On January 17, 2025, the court denied Burns&rsquo; motion for judgment of matter of law. Concerning the Section 1981 claim, the court found that SeaWorld produced sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably find that SeaWorld did not violate Section 1981 by discriminating against Burns on the basis of race.</p>\r\n<p>On April 3, 2025, one of the private parties and SeaWorld entered into a joint dismissal with prejudice.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing as of April 17, 2025.</p>",

    "summary_short": "In 2022, a private plaintiff, on behalf of herself, her minor child, and any similarly situated persons (collectively, “Burns”), sued SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc, Sesame Place Philadelphia, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC, and four private defendants (collectively, “SeaWorld”) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Burns alleged that Sesame Place costumed characters discriminated against her and her child because they did not spend as much time interacting with the children of color as the white children present. Burns challenged Sesame Place’s employees actions as violating Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1886 (“Section 1981”), and breach of contract and negligence under the Pennsylvania common law. In an amended complaint, seven additional families were added as plaintiffs, but the attempt to certify a class was denied. At trial, the jury found in favor of SeaWorld, and later on, in a motion for judgment as a matter of law, the court upheld the jury verdict. This case is ongoing as of April 17, 2025.",

This class action lawsuit is brought to secure the rights of Plaintiffs to make and \nenforce contracts and to enjoy the security of persons in the same manner as white citizens.   \n2.  This class action lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages, as well as \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief against Defendant SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. and \nSeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC. \n3.  This class action lawsuit is brought to enforce the 13th Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution by way of 42 U.S.C. § 1981, which creates an individual and private right of \naction against those who discriminate on the basis of race in, inter alia, “the making and \nperformance of contracts.” 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a-b). \n4.  This class action lawsuit demonstrates that SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. \nand SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC, engages in pervasive and appalling race discrimination \nagainst children in the operation of Sesame Place Philadelphia.  \n5.  Thereby, it is alleged that SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. and SeaWorld \nParks & Entertainment LLC violates the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C.A. § 1981 and \nadditional violations of the Pennsylvania common law. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/22   Page 3 of 19\n6.  Plaintiffs  and  Proposed  Class  Representatives  Quinton  Burns  and  K.B. \n(collectively “Burns”) bring this action individually and on behalf of all similarly situated Black \npeople (“Class Members”) who have attempted to exercise their enumerated rights pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1981 to include the right to make and enforce contracts with SeaWorld Parks & \nEntertainment, Inc. and SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC for admission to Sesame Place \nPhiladelphia. The Class Members have suffered, and absent legal action, will continue to suffer, \ndisparate treatment by SeaWorld through its agents and/or employees, to include but not not be \nlimited to Defendants John Doe 1, 2, 3 and 4, and other John Doe Defendants yet to be known, \nsolely based on their race or color, with regard to Plaintiffs’ statutory right to enforce the equitable \nperformance of their contracts with SeaWorld, as is enjoyed by white citizens. \nPARTIES \n1.  Representative Plaintiff Quinton Burns is an adult Black citizen of the United \nStates. \n2.  Representative  Plaintiff  K.B.  is  a  minor  Black  citizen  of  the  United  States, \nRepresentative Plaintiff Quinton Burns’ child. \n3.  The  Representative  Plaintiffs  (“the  Burns”)  reside  in  the  City  of  Baltimore, \nMaryland. \n4.  Defendant  SeaWorld  Parks  &  Entertainment,  Inc.  d/b/a  “Sesame  Place \nPhiladelphia”, is a for-profit publicly traded corporation.  \n5.  Defendant  SeaWorld  Parks  &  Entertainment  LLC  d/b/a  “Sesame  Place \nPhiladelphia”, is a limited liability company. \n6.  Both  Defendant  SeaWorld  Parks  &  Entertainment,  Inc.  d/b/a  “Sesame  Place \nPhiladelphia”  and  Defendant  SeaWorld  Parks  &  Entertainment  LLC  d/b/a  “Sesame  Place \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/22   Page 4 of 19\nPhiladelphia” are organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, and headquartered at 6240 \nSea Harbor Drive, Orlando, Florida 32821, and registered with the Pennsylvania Department of \nState to conduct business in Pennsylvania. In this class action lawsuit, these Defendants are \ncollectively referred to as “SeaWorld.” \n7.  Defendants John Doe 1, 2, 3 and 4 are individuals employed by SeaWorld as \ncostume character performers. \n8.  At all times relevant, SeaWorld’s agents, employees or representatives referenced \nherein, including but not limited to the Doe Defendants, were acting within the course and scope \nof their actual or apparent authority and responsibilities as a SeaWorld employee.   \n9.  Upon information and belief, including but not exclusively limited to the fact that \nthe discrimination complained of in this class action lawsuit occurred during business hours, in the \nlight of day, to several different Black children on different days such that said discrimination was \ncaught on video numerous times, SeaWorld was aware of and were subsequently ratified and \nadopted its emplpoyees’ discriminatory actions. \nJURISDICTION \n10.  This is a class action. \n11.  On information and belief, aggregate claims of individual Class Members exceed \n$50,000,000.00 exclusive of interests, attorneys’ fees and costs. \n12.  Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A § 1332(d), 1343(a)(3), \n1343(a)(4), and 1367(a). \n13.  All conditions precedent necessary to the filing of this class action lawsuit have \nbeen met. \nVENUE \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/22   Page 5 of 19\n14.  SeaWorld,  through  its  business  of  operating  Sesame  Place  Philadelphia,  has \nestablished sufficient contacts in this district such that personal jurisdiction is appropriate.  \n15.  SeaWorld is deemed to reside in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1391. \n16.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C § 1391 (b)(1) & (2). \n   \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/22   Page 6 of 19\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n17.  On or about June 18, 2022, the Burns accepted SeaWorld’s offer to purchase two \nweekend admission tickets to SeaWorld’s amusement park, Sesame Place Philadelphia. \n18.  The Burns performed their contractual duties by tendering remuneration in a \nbargained for exchange to experience SeaWorld’s Sesame Place Philadelphia attraction.   \n19.  SeaWorld’s offer which the Burns accepted included, inter alia, the benefit and \nprivilege  of  enjoyment  of  the  amusement  rides  and  “exclusive  Sesame  Street  themed \nentertainment” offered at Sesame Place, including but not limited to amusement park shows \nfeaturing “Meet and Greets” with Sesame Street themed costume character performers. \n20.  By the terms of the contract between the Burns and SeaWorld, SeaWorld’s costume \ncharacter performers were obligated to “Meet and Greet” with SeaWorld’s customers to include \nBurns. Similarly, the Burns was entitled to SeaWorld’s performance of the contract by way of its \ncostume character performers to “Meet and Greet” with the Burns. \n21.  During the Burns’ visit to Sesame Place, they attempted to participate in a “Meet \nand Greet” with SeaWorld’s costume character performers dressed as Sesame Street characters \n“Elmo”, “Ernie”, “Telly Monster”, & “Abby Cadabby.”  \n22.  SeaWorld’s costume character performers dressed as Sesame Street characters \n“Elmo”,  “Ernie”,  “Telly  Monster”,  &  “Abby  Cadabby”  intentionally  refused  to  perform \nSeaWorld’s contract with the Burns and the Class by, inter alia, refusing to engage with them and \nignoring them and all other Black guests in attendance. \n23.  Upon information and belief, including but not exclusively limited to the fact that \nSeaWorld’s performers readily engaged with numerous similarly situated white customers and \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/22   Page 7 of 19\ntheir children who participated in the costume character performer “Meet and Greets,” SeaWorld’s \nactions, by their agents and/or employees, were intentional race discrimination.     \n24.  SeaWorld, by their agents and/or employees, unlawfully and substantially refused \nto perform its contract with the Burns, which is an enumerated activity. See Brown v. Phillip \nMorris, Inc., 250 F.3d 789, 797 (3rd Cir. 2001). \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n25.  The Burns bring this lawsuit as a class action on behalf of themselves and all others \nsimilarly situated as members of the proposed Plaintiffs Class pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure  23(a),  (b)(3),  and/or  (b)(2).    This  action  satisfies  the  numerosity,  commonality, \ntypicality, adequacy, predominance and superiority requirements of those provisions. \n26.  The Class that the Burns seek to represent is defined as follows: \n(a)  All Black persons who;  \n(b)  Since July 27, 2018; \n(c)  entered contracts with SeaWorld for admission into Sesame Place Philadelphia \nwho; \n(d)  suffered disparate treatment from SeaWorld and/or its agents and/or employees by;  \n(e)  ignoring with Black children while openly interacting with similarly situated white \nchildren. \n27.  Numerosity:  Although the exact number of Class Members is uncertain and \ncan only be ascertained through appropriate discovery, upon information and belief and \nbecause over 1 million guests visit Sesame Place each year, the number is great enough \nsuch that joinder is impracticable.  The disposition of the claims of these Class Members \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/22   Page 8 of 19\nin a single action will provide substantial benefits to all parties and to the Court.  The Class \nMembers are readily identifiable.  \n28.  Typicality:  The Burns’ claims are typical of the claims of the Class. Like all Class \nMembers, the Burns entered into a contract with the SeaWorld by way of their ticketed admission \nto  SeaWorld’s  amusement  park  Sesame  Place  Philadelphia,  and  therein,  suffered  disparate \ntreatment from SeaWorld solely based on their race or color that unlawfully interfered with their \nenumerated right to make and enforce contracts in the same manner as is enjoyed by white citizens \nwhen SeaWorld and/or its agents and/or its employees refused to interact with Black children while \nopenly interacting with white children. The Burns, like all Class Members, have been damaged by \nSeaWorld’s misconduct in that they have incurred damages to their enumerated civil rights, have \nand/or will incur economic damages, and/or have or will incur non-economic damages, including \nbut not limited to humiliation, embarrassment, mental anguish, psychological stress, depression, \nanxiety, loss of self-respect, post-traumatic stress, damage to their physical health, and loss of life \nand/or professional opportunities.  Furthermore, the factual bases of SeaWorld’s misconduct, that \nSeaWorld and/or its agents and/or its employees refused to interact with Black children while \nopenly interacting with white children are common to all Class Members and represent a common \nthread of illegal impairment and infringement committed against the Class Members’ civil right to \ncontract, resulting in injury to all Class Members.  \n29.  Commonality:  there are questions of law and fact common to Plaintiffs and the \nClass that predominate over any question affecting only individual Class Members.  These \ncommon legal and factual issues include the following: \na)  Whether there was a contractual nexus between the Class Member and the \nSeaWorld. \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/22   Page 9 of 19\nb)  Whether  SeaWorld,  through  its  agents  and/or  employees  intentionally \ndiscriminated against Class Members based on their race or color. \nc)  Whether SeaWorld’s agents and/or employees were acting within the scope of \ntheir apparent authority at the time of their racially motivated discriminatory \nconduct towards Class Members. \nd)  Whether SeaWorld’s racially motivated discrimination against Class Members \nis based on a widespread pattern and practice of disparate treatment of Black \ncitizens that is directly attributable to SeaWorld. \ne)  Whether SeaWorld failed to meet its duties to undertake adequate measures in \nhiring, supervising, and training its agents and/or employees. \nf)  Whether SeaWorld was aware of and/or subsequently ratified the racially based \ndiscriminatory conduct of its agents and/or employees. \n30.  Adequate Representation:  The Burns will fairly and adequately protect the interests \nof the Class Members.  The Burns have retained attorneys experienced in the prosecution of class \nactions, and the Burns intend to prosecute this action vigorously. One of the Burns’ attorneys \nparticularly, recently clarified through Third Circuit litigation that courts were too narrowly \ninterpreting 42 U.S.C. § 1981 from 1992 through 2021, such that a cause of action can be \nmaintained even when services were ultimately provided to the aggrieved plaintiff and therein in \na case of first impression, actualized a cause of action for hostile retail environment liability under \nthe statute with such case to be tried in this Courthouse this coming Fall. Furthermore; \n(a)  The interests of the Burns are consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests \nof the Class. \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/22   Page 10 of 19\n(b)  The prosecutions of separate actions by individual Class Members would create a \nrisk of inconsistent and varying adjudications with respect to individual members \nof the class, and it would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties \nanticipated to oppose the class. \n(c)  The prosecutions of separate actions by individual Class Members would, as a \npractical matter, substantially impair or impede the ability of the other Class \nMembers to preserve and protect their interests. \n(d)  The Burns allege that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum \nbecause all of their claims arose in the same location; and consolidation of their \nclaims will promote judicial efficiency to resolve their common questions of law \nand fact in one single forum. \n31.  Predominance and Superiority:  The Burns and the Class Members have all suffered \nand will continue to suffer harm and damages because of Defendants’ unlawful and wrongful \nconduct.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication \nof the controversy.  Absent a class action, most Class Members would likely find the cost of \nlitigating their claims prohibitively high and would therefore have no effective remedy at law.  It \nis likely that only a few Class Members could afford to seek legal redress for Defendants’ \nmisconduct.    Absent  a  class  action,  Class  Members  will  continue  to  incur  damages,  and \nDefendants’ misconduct will continue without remedy.  Class treatment of common questions of \nlaw and fact would also be a superior method to multiple individual actions or piecemeal litigation \nin that class treatment will conserve the resources of the courts and the litigants and will promote \nconsistency and efficiency of adjudication.  \n   \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/22   Page 11 of 19\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Race Discrimination in Violation of 42. U.S.C.A. § 1981) \n32.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated to this Count. \n33.  The Burns and Class Members are Black, and therefore are members of a federally \nprotected class of citizens against racial discrimination in contract pursuant to §1981. \n34.  The  Burns  and  Class  Members  entered  binding  contracts  with  SeaWorld  for \nadmission to its amusement park, Sesame Place Philadelphia. The minor Plaintiffs are third party \nbeneficiaries of their parents’ and/or guardians’ and/or other adults’ contracts with SeaWorld, as \nthe contracts at issue were for the benefit of the minor children who do not have the legal capacity \nto enter contracts in their own right under Pennsylvania law. \n35.  SeaWorld refused to perform its contract with the Burns and Class members, who \neach attempted to enforce the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of their \ncontract with SeaWorld, which specifically included SeaWorld’s promise to engage in “Meet and \nGreets” between its Sesame Street themed costume character performers  such as “Elmo,” \n(Defendant John Doe 1), “Ernie,” (Defendant John Doe 2), “Telly Monster,” (Defendant John Doe \n3), & “Abby Cadabby,” (Defendant John Doe 4) and the children. \n36.  SeaWorld, by its agents and/or employees, intentionally discriminated against The \nBurns and Class Members based on their race or color by intentionally choosing to interact only \nwith  white  patrons  and  refusing  to  interact  with  the  Burns  or  Class  Members  during  the \nperformance of their contracts. \n37.  SeaWorld is vicariously liable under the theory of respondeat superior for its \nemployees’ violations of § 1981 committed within the scope of their employment against the Burns \nand Class Members.  See Williams v. Cloverland Farms Dairy, Inc., 78 F.Supp.2d 479, 485 (1999) \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/22   Page 12 of 19\n(quoting Fitzgerald v. Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph Co., 68 F.3d 1257, 1262-63 (10th \nCir. 1995)).  See also, Restatement (Second) of Agency § 219 (1957). \n38.  SeaWorld, by the racially motivated discriminatory conduct of its agents and/or \nemployees, who at all times relevant acted with the scope of their employment, substantially and \nunreasonably impaired and infringed upon the Burns’ and Class Members’ enumerated right to \nmake and enforce their contracts with SeaWorld as is enjoyed by white citizens by unilaterally \nchanging the terms of their contract with the Burns and Class Members to exclude participation in \n“Meet and Greets” during the performance of the agreement, solely because of their race or color. \n39.  SeaWorld, by the racially motivated discriminatory conduct of its agents and/or \nemployees, substantially and unreasonably impaired and infringed upon the Burns and Class \nMembers’ enumerated right to make and enforce their contracts with SeaWorld as is enjoyed by \nwhite citizens by creating a hostile retail environment.   \n40.  As a direct and proximate cause of SeaWorld’s actions and/or inactions, the Burns \nand Class Members suffered damages to their civil rights, mental health, and personal dignity. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Breach of Contract Under the Pennsylvania Common law)  \n41.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated to this Count. \n42.  At relevant times to this Complaint, the Burns and Class Members entered binding \ncontracts with SeaWorld for admission into its amusement park Sesame Place Philadelphia. \n43.  Pursuant to the terms of the Burns’ and Class Members’ contractual agreement with \nSeaWorld, for the price of admission, Plaintiffs were entitled to enjoy all entertainment provided \nby SeaWorld, including but not limited to “Meet and Greets” with Sesame Street themed costume \ncharacter performers, including but not limited to characters such as “Elmo,” (Defendant John Doe \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/22   Page 13 of 19\n1), “Ernie,” (Defendant John Doe 2), “Telly Monster,” (Defendant John Doe 3), & “Abby \nCadabby,” (Defendant John Doe 4) . \n44.  SeaWorld breached its contracts with the Burns and Class Members when, solely \ndue  to  their  race  or  color,  and  by  and  through  its  agents  and/or  employs,  it  publicly  and \ndiscriminatorily denied Plaintiffs the opportunity to enjoy the experience of meeting and greeting \nthe Sesame Street costume character performers as promised. \n45.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  SeaWorld’s  breach  of  their  contractual \nagreements with the Burns and Class Members, Plaintiffs and Class Members have suffered and \ncontinue to suffer monetary and consequential damages. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Negligence Under the Pennsylvania Common law) \n46.  Upon information and belief, but not limited to the fact that John Does 1-4 \nintentionally, wantonly, and publicly discriminated against the Burns and Class Members based \non their race or color, SeaWorld had actual knowledge that John Does 1-4 held personal beliefs of \nracial bias towards Black people and that John Does 1-4 had the propensity to discriminate against \nBlack people based on their race or color. \n47.  SeaWorld knew, or should have known, that John Does 1-4 would be likely be in \nclose contact with members of the public. \n48.  SeaWorld knew that the Burns and Class Members were members of the public \nwho would foreseeably encounter John Does 1-4, and as such, SeaWorld owed a duty of care to \nthe Burns and Class Member to use reasonable care in selecting, training, supervising, and \nretaining John Does 1-4 as its employees. \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/22   Page 14 of 19\n49.  Because of John Does 1-4’s personal beliefs of racial bias towards Black people, \nthe likelihood of the risk of John Does 1-4 unlawfully discriminating against the Burns and Class \nMembers based on their race or color was foreseeable. \n50.  SeaWorld had a duty and responsibility of care to use reasonable care to select \nemployees who were competent and fit to perform the duties of an amusement park costume \ncharacter performer. \n51.  A  reasonable  and  prudent  employer  would  have  discovered  John  Does  1-4’s \nunfitness to be hired, and not hired them. \n52.  SeaWorld breached its and responsibility of care when it hired Doe Defendants 1-\n4 when it knew or should have known about Doe Defendant 1-4’s propensity to engage in race \ndiscrimination. \n53.  SeaWorld also had a duty and responsibility of care to use reasonable care to train \nits employees to ensure that they were fit to perform the duties of an amusement park costume \ncharacter performer. \n54.  A  reasonable  and  prudent  employer  would  have  learned  of  John  Does  1-4’s \nunfitness to start working, and trained them. \n55.  SeaWorld breached its and responsibility of care when it failed to train Doe \nDefendants  1-4  to  suppress  or  otherwise  eliminate  their  propensities  to  engage  in  race \ndiscrimination. \n56.  SeaWorld also had a duty and responsibility of care to use reasonable care in \nsupervising and retaining its employees to ensure they were fit to perform the duties of an \namusement park costume character performer. \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/22   Page 15 of 19\n57.  A reasonable and prudent employers would have learned of John Does 1-4’s \nunfitness to continue working, and either fired or otherwise removed them from a position that \ngave them the opportunity to discriminate. \n58.  SeaWorld breached its and responsibility of care when it allowed Doe Defendants \n1-4 to racially discriminate against the Burns and the Class and/or failed to learn about and take \nany remedial measures to put a stop to Doe Defendants 1-4’s racial discrimination. \n59.  John Does 1-4’s racially discriminatory conduct towards The Burns and Class \nMembers would have been prevented if SeaWorld had used reasonable care in hiring, training, \nsupervising, and/or retaining John Does 1-4. \n60.  As a result of SeaWorld’s negligence in hiring, retaining, training, and supervising \nJohn Does 1-4 in the position of costume character performer, the Burns and Class Members were \ninjured and suffered damages as alleged supra. \n61.  SeaWorld  failed  to  reasonably  train  and/or  educated  John  Does  1-4  on  the \nenumerated rights of the Burns, Class Members, and all Black citizens, to be free from racial \ndiscrimination in contract pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1981.   \n62.  SeaWorld knew or should have known that John Does 1-4 were not competent or \nfit for the duties of a costume character performer. \n63.  Despite this knowledge, SeaWorld failed to reasonably supervise and/or monitor \nJohn Does 1-4 during their employment as costume character performers to ensure that they were \nfit to properly performed the duties of a costume character performer without discriminating \nagainst Blacks based on their race or color. \n   \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/22   Page 16 of 19\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n64.

See Brown v Phillip \nMorris, Inc., 250 F.3d 789, 797 (3rd Cir. 2001).  \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n108.  The Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit as a class action on behalf of themselves and all \nothers similarly situated as members of the proposed Plaintiffs Class pursuant to Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure 23(a), (b)(3), and/or (b)(2).  This action satisfies the numerosity, commonality, \ntypicality, adequacy, predominance and superiority requirements of those provisions. \n109.  The Class that the Plaintiffs seek to represent is defined as follows: \n(a)  All minority persons who;  \n(b)  Since July 27, 2018; \n(c)  entered contracts with SeaWorld for admission into Sesame Place Philadelphia \nwho; \n(d)  suffered disparate treatment from SeaWorld and/or its agents and/or employees by;  \n(e)  ignoring minority children while openly interacting with similarly situated white \nchildren. \n110.  Numerosity:  Although the exact number of Class Members is uncertain and can \nonly be ascertained through appropriate discovery, upon information and belief, the current \nnumber consists of  89 families involving 125 children and, because over 1 million guests visit \nSesame Place Philadelphia each year, that number is likely to increase such that joinder is \nimpracticable.  The disposition of the claims of these Class Members in a single action will \nprovide substantial benefits to all parties and to the Court.  The Class Members are readily \nidentifiable.  \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 25   Filed 09/28/22   Page 18 of 30\n111.  Typicality:  The Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the Class. Like all \nClass Members, the Plaintiffs entered into  contracts with  SeaWorld by way of their ticketed \nadmission to SeaWorld’s amusement park, Sesame Place Philadelphia, and therein, suffered \ndisparate treatment from SeaWorld solely based on their race or color that unlawfully interfered \nwith their enumerated right to make and enforce contracts in the same manner as is enjoyed by \nwhite citizens when SeaWorld and/or its agents and/or its employees refused to interact with \nminority children while openly interacting with white children. The Plaintiffs, like all Class \nMembers, have been damaged by SeaWorld’s misconduct in that they have incurred damages to \ntheir enumerated civil rights, have and/or will incur economic damages, and/or have or will incur \nnon-economic damages, including but not limited to humiliation, embarrassment, mental anguish, \npsychological stress, depression, anxiety, loss of self-respect, post-traumatic stress, damage to \ntheir physical health, and loss of life and/or professional opportunities.  Furthermore, the factual \nbases of SeaWorld’s misconduct, that SeaWorld and/or its agents and/or its employees refused to \ninteract with minority children while openly interacting with white children are common to all \nClass Members and represent a common thread of illegal impairment and infringement committed \nagainst the Class Members’ civil right to contract, resulting in injury to all Class Members.  \n112.  Commonality:  There are questions of law and fact common to the Plaintiffs and  \nthe Class that predominate over any question affecting only individual Class Members.  These \ncommon legal and factual issues include the following: \na)  Whether there was a contractual nexus between the Class Member and the \nSeaWorld. \nb)  Whether  SeaWorld,  through  its  agents  and/or  employees  intentionally \ndiscriminated against Class Members based on their race or color. \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 25   Filed 09/28/22   Page 19 of 30\nc)  Whether SeaWorld’s agents and/or employees were acting within the scope of \ntheir apparent authority at the time of their racially motivated discriminatory \nconduct towards Class Members. \nd)  Whether SeaWorld’s racially motivated discrimination against Class Members \nis based on a widespread pattern and practice of disparate treatment of minority \ncitizens that is directly attributable to SeaWorld. \ne)  Whether SeaWorld failed to meet its duties to undertake adequate measures in \nhiring, supervising, and training its agents and/or employees. \nf)  Whether SeaWorld was aware of and/or subsequently ratified the racially based \ndiscriminatory conduct of its agents and/or employees. \n113.  Adequate Representation:  The Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests  of  the  Class  Members.  The  Plaintiffs  have  retained  attorneys  experienced  in  the \nprosecution of class actions, and the Plaintiffs intend to prosecute this action vigorously. One of \nthe Plaintiffs’ attorneys particularly, recently clarified through Third Circuit litigation that courts \nwere too narrowly interpreting 42 U.S.C. § 1981 from 1992 through 2021, such that a cause of \naction can be maintained even when services were ultimately provided to the aggrieved plaintiff \nand therein in a case of first impression, actualized a cause of action for hostile retail environment \nliability  under  the  statute  with  such  case  to  be  tried  in  this  Courthouse  this  coming  Fall. \nFurthermore; \n(a)  The interests of the Plaintiffs are consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests \nof the Class. \n(b)  The prosecutions of separate actions by individual Class Members would create a \nrisk of inconsistent and varying adjudications with respect to individual members \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 25   Filed 09/28/22   Page 20 of 30\nof the class, and it would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties \nanticipated to oppose the class. \n(c)  The prosecutions of separate actions by individual Class Members would, as a \npractical matter, substantially impair or impede the ability of the other Class \nMembers to preserve and protect their interests. \n(d)  The Plaintiffs allege that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum \nbecause all their claims arose in the same location; and consolidation of their claims \nwill promote judicial efficiency to resolve their common questions of law and fact \nin one single forum. \n114.  Predominance and Superiority:  The Plaintiffs and the Class Members have all \nsuffered and will continue to suffer harm and damages because of Defendants’ unlawful and \nwrongful conduct.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of the controversy.  Absent a class action, most Class Members would likely find the \ncost of litigating their claims prohibitively high and would therefore have no effective remedy at \nlaw.  It is likely that only a few Class Members could afford to seek legal redress for Defendants’ \nmisconduct.    Absent  a  class  action,  Class  Members  will  continue  to  incur  damages,  and \nDefendants’ misconduct will continue without remedy.  Class treatment of common questions of \nlaw and fact would also be a superior method to multiple individual actions or piecemeal litigation \nin that class treatment will conserve the resources of the courts and the litigants and will promote \nconsistency and efficiency of adjudication.  \n   \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 25   Filed 09/28/22   Page 21 of 30\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Race Discrimination in Violation of 42. U.S.C.A. § 1981) \n115.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated to this Count. \n116.  The Plaintiffs and Class Members are minorities, and therefore are members of a \nfederally protected class of citizens against racial discrimination in contract pursuant to §1981. \n117.  The Plaintiffs and Class Members entered binding contracts with SeaWorld for \nadmission to its amusement park, Sesame Place Philadelphia. The minor Plaintiffs are third party \nbeneficiaries of their parents’ and/or guardians’ and/or other adults’ contracts with SeaWorld, as \nthe contracts at issue were for the benefit of the minor children who do not have the legal capacity \nto enter contracts in their own right under Pennsylvania law. \n118.  SeaWorld refused to perform its contract with the Plaintiffs and Class members, \nwho each attempted to enforce the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of \ntheir contracts with SeaWorld, which specifically included SeaWorld’s promise to engage in \n“Meet and Greets” and Parades between its Sesame Street themed costume character performers  \nsuch as “Elmo”, “Ernie”, “Telly Monster”,  “Abby Cadabby”,  “Grover”, “Rosita”, “Big Bird”, \n“Baby Bear”, “Zoey”, “Cookie Monster”, and the children. \n119.  SeaWorld, by its agents and/or employees, intentionally discriminated against the \nPlaintiffs and Class Members based on their race or color by intentionally choosing to interact only \nwith white patrons and refusing to interact with the Plaintiffs or Class Members during the \nperformance of their contracts. \n120.  SeaWorld is vicariously liable under the theory of respondeat superior for its \nemployees’ violations of § 1981 committed within the scope of their employment against the \nPlaintiffs and Class Members.  See Williams v. Cloverland Farms Dairy, Inc., 78 F.Supp.2d 479, \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 25   Filed 09/28/22   Page 22 of 30\n485 (1999) (quoting Fitzgerald v. Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph Co., 68 F.3d 1257, \n1262-63 (10th Cir. 1995)).  See also, Restatement (Second) of Agency § 219 (1957). \n121.  SeaWorld, by the racially motivated discriminatory conduct of its agents and/or \nemployees, who at all times relevant acted with the scope of their employment, substantially and \nunreasonably impaired and infringed upon the Plaintiffs’ and Class Members’ enumerated right to \nmake and enforce their contracts with SeaWorld as is enjoyed by white citizens by unilaterally \nchanging the terms of their contract with the Plaintiffs and Class Members to exclude participation \nin “Meet and Greets” and Parades during the performance of the agreement, solely because of their \nrace or color. \n122.  SeaWorld, by the racially motivated discriminatory conduct of its agents and/or \nemployees, substantially and unreasonably impaired and infringed upon the Plaintiffs and Class \nMembers’ enumerated right to make and enforce their contracts with SeaWorld as is enjoyed by \nwhite citizens by creating a hostile retail environment.   \n123.  As a direct and proximate cause of SeaWorld’s actions and/or inactions, the \nPlaintiffs and Class Members suffered damages to their civil rights, mental health, and personal \ndignity. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nNEGLIGENCE \n124.

Plaintiffs filed this putative class action on their own behalf and on behalf of eighty-\nnine other families who they contend experienced similar treatment.  They bring claims against \nSeaWorld under 42 U.S.C. § 1981, which prohibits racial discrimination in the making and \nenforcing of contracts, and for negligence.  They seek monetary damages in excess of $50 \nmillion; declaratory relief; and injunctive relief requiring, inter alia, that SeaWorld implement \n“rigorous” anti-discrimination training, educational, and screening policies for its employees.   \nSeaWorld first moves to dismiss both counts for failure to state a claim pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  Second, SeaWorld moves to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims \nfor injunctive relief pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), arguing that Plaintiffs have failed to adequately \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 2 of 26\nplead standing for injunctive relief.  Separately, SeaWorld moves to dismiss Plaintiffs who \npurchased season passes to SeaWorld, the Valdez and Willie Plaintiffs, pursuant to a purported \nclass action waiver.  The Court, having heard argument on May 9, 2023, for the reasons that \nfollow, will grant SeaWorld’s Motion as to parts of Plaintiffs’ negligence claim and denied \notherwise. \nI.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nThe following facts are drawn from the Amended Complaint and, for the purposes of this \nMotion to Dismiss, will be taken as true.  See Kost v. Kozakiewicz, 1 F.3d 176, 183 (3d Cir. \n1993).  Plaintiffs are Black and Hispanic parents and their children who visited Sesame Place in \n2021 and 2022.1  Two of the attractions at Sesame Place are parades and “Meet and Greet” \nevents, in which park patrons can interact with costumed performers appearing as various \nSesame Street characters.  When Plaintiffs attempted to participate in these events, the costumed \nperformers ignored and refused to interact with their children while “readily engag[ing] with \nnumerous similarly situated white customers and their children[.]”  The Amended Complaint \ndoes not name any individual Sesame Place employees involved in the incidents, but does \nidentify the following Sesame Street characters: Elmo, Ernie, Telly Monster, Abby Cadabby, \nRosita, Big Bird, Grover, Baby Bear, Zoey, and Cookie Monster.  Plaintiffs recorded portions of \nthese interactions on video and provide links to these videos in the Amended Complaint. \n \n \n \n1 Each Plaintiff family alleges they experienced the alleged discrimination on different days.  The Valdez Plaintiffs \nvisited Sesame Place on December 29, 2021; the Burns Plaintiffs on June 18, 2022; the Valette Plaintiffs on June 20, \n2022; the Miles Plaintiffs on June 24, 2022; the Romero Plaintiffs on June 25, 2022; the Fleming Plaintiffs on July \n4, 2022; the Willie Plaintiffs on July 10, 2022; and the Morales Plaintiffs on July 11, 2022. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 3 of 26\nII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  Rule 12(b)(6) \ni.  Legal Standard and Documents Considered \n“To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, \naccepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  “A claim \nhas facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the \nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Id.  At this stage, \nthe Court must “construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and determine \nwhether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.” \nFowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2009) (quoting Phillips v. County of \nAllegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 233 (3d Cir. 2008)).  Yet, “the tenet that a court must accept a \ncomplaint’s allegations as true is inapplicable to threadbare recitals of a cause of action’s \nelements, supported by mere conclusory statements.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 663.  \n“To decide a motion to dismiss, courts generally consider only the allegations contained \nin the complaint, exhibits attached to the complaint, and matters of public record.”  Pension \nBenefit Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. Indus., Inc., 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993).  \nHowever, a court may also “consider an undisputedly authentic document that a defendant \nattaches as an exhibit to a motion to dismiss if the plaintiff’s claims are based on the document.”  \nId.  Here, SeaWorld attached to its Motion copies of the tickets and season passes that Plaintiffs \npurchased to Sesame Place, and Plaintiffs do not challenge the authenticity of these documents.2  \n \n2 SeaWorld states that it “has been unable to locate tickets for the Miles or Valette families or for M.L. (child of \nKatie Valdez) for the dates in the Amended Complaint.”  According to SeaWorld, “[t]his could mean that the \nfamilies did not purchase tickets on those days or that they purchased physical tickets at Sesame Place rather than \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 4 of 26\nAdditionally, because the season passes purchased by certain Plaintiffs contain the text “Please \nrefer to EZpay terms and conditions,” SeaWorld also attached a copy of the “EZ Pay Terms and \nConditions.”  As the tickets and season passes form the basis of Plaintiffs’ claims, they are \nincorporated by reference into the Amended Complaint and can be considered by the Court to \ndecide this Motion.  See id.  However, the EZ Pay Terms and Conditions will not be.  The copy \nof the Terms and Conditions attached by SeaWorld provides that “BY ENTERING THIS SITE \nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  \nIF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THIS SITE,” presumably \nreferring to the website identified by URL at the bottom of the document \n(seaworldentertainment.com).  But the Amended Complaint does not specify whether any \nPlaintiff purchased tickets online, as opposed to in person.  SeaWorld’s inclusion of the Terms \nand Conditions rests upon an assumption that the Plaintiffs’ purchased tickets online—an \nassertion that is not found in the Complaint.  Accordingly, given the motion-to-dismiss rubric, \nthe Terms and Conditions shall not be considered here. \nii.  Section 1981 \nSection 1981, passed as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, provides that “[a]ll persons \nwithin the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory \nto make and enforce contracts . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens[.]”  42 U.S.C. § 1981(a).  \n“Make and enforce contracts” is defined to include “the making, performance, modification, and \ntermination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of \nthe contractual relationship.”  Id. § 1981(b).  Essentially, “Section 1981 offers relief when racial \ndiscrimination blocks the creation of a contractual relationship, as well as when racial \n \npurchasing their tickets online.” \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 5 of 26\ndiscrimination impairs an existing contractual relationship, so long as the plaintiff has or would \nhave rights under the existing or proposed contractual relationship.”  Domino’s Pizza, Inc. v. \nMcDonald¸ 546 U.S. 470, 476 (2006).     \nTo state a claim under Section 1981: \n[A] plaintiff “must allege facts in support of the following elements: (1) [that \nplaintiff] is a member of a racial minority; (2) intent to discriminate on the basis of \nrace by the defendant; and (3) discrimination concerning one or more of the \nactivities enumerated in the statute[,] which includes the right to make and enforce \ncontracts. . . .” \nBrown v. Philip Morris Inc., 250 F.3d 789, 797 (3d Cir. 2001).  Additionally, “a plaintiff \nmust initially plead and ultimately prove that, but for race, it would not have suffered the \nloss of a legally protected right.”  Comcast Corp. v. Nat’l Ass’n of Afr. Am.-Owned Media, \n140 S. Ct. 1009, 1019 (2020).   \na.  Existence of a Contract \nSeaWorld first argues that Plaintiffs’ Section 1981 claim fails because, by basing their \nclaims on the purchase of admissions tickets, they have failed to allege the existence of a \ncontract,3 in that tickets are not contracts but are instead classified as “revocable licenses.”  \nTherefore, as Section 1981 requires interference with a contractual right, SeaWorld argues that \nPlaintiffs have not stated a claim.   \nThis argument is not a basis for dismissal given Valle v. Stengel, 176 F.2d 697 (3d Cir. \n1949) in which the Third Circuit held that ticket purchases can give rise to a Section 1981 claim.  \nIn Valle, the plaintiffs were a group of Black and White individuals who attempted to patronize a \nNew Jersey amusement park.  176 F.2d at 699.  The park “admitted members of the public upon \n \n3 Although the Amended Complaint does not directly identify Plaintiffs’ admission tickets as the contracts \nunderlying the Section 1981 claim, their counsel clarified during argument that Plaintiffs maintain that the tickets \nare the contracts they allege here.   \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 6 of 26\nthe payment of fees.”  Id.  It also “contained a swimming pool and persons who were admitted to \nthe park were admitted to the pool upon the payment of an additional fee.”  Id.  Although the \nplaintiffs had “duly purchased ticket[s]” to the pool, they were denied entry to the pool and \nejected from the park “on the ground that the party included Negroes.”  Id.  Plaintiffs brought a \nnumber of claims, including one under an earlier version of Section 1981 then referred to as \n“Section 1977,”4 against the park’s corporate proprietor, park managers, and the chief of police \nwho allegedly aided in their ejection.  Id.  Specifically, they alleged that the defendants violated \ntheir rights under Section 1977 by refusing “to permit the plaintiffs to make contracts (i.e. to \npurchase tickets) for the use of the swimming pool” and refusing “to honor contracts (i.e., \nswimming pool tickets, ‘duly purchased’)” because of the plaintiffs’ race.  Id.  After the district \ncourt dismissed the complaint, the Third Circuit reversed and held that plaintiffs stated a claim \nfor violations of their rights under “the Civil Rights Acts,” which included Section 1977.  Id. at \n703-04.   \nFederal courts in other jurisdictions have more recently come to the same conclusion.  \nSee Olzman v. Lake Hills Swim Club, Inc., 495 F.2d 1333, 1339 (2d Cir. 1974) (Section 1981 \n“has been interpreted to require swimming pool owners and operators to sell tickets of admission \nto blacks.” (citing, inter alia, Valle v. Stengel)); Scott v. Young, 421 F.2d 143, 145 (4th Cir. \n1970) (“The Timberlake proprietors bestow the right of admission in return for a fee.  This is \nunquestionably a contract.  Refusal to extend the same contractual opportunity to blacks is, as the \n \n4 Section 1977, which was codified at 8 U.S.C. § 41 when Valle was decided, provided that: \n \nAll persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and \nTerritory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal \nbenefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white \ncitizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of \nevery kind, and to no other. \n \nId. at 700 n.11; 8 U.S.C. § 41 (1946).  \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 7 of 26\nDistrict Court decided, a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981.” (internal citations omitted)); Anderson \nv. Tierco Md., Inc., 2000 WL 783072, at *1, 3 (D. Md. June 7, 2000) (denying motion to dismiss \nSection 1981 claims based on plaintiffs’ purchase of admission to a Six Flags amusement park); \nWilliams v. Kansas City, 104 F. Supp. 848, 859 (W.D. Mo. 1952) (rejecting the argument that \nplaintiffs could not bring Section 1981 claims based on admissions tickets because “it is rather \nuniversally held that a ticket holder to a place of amusement ‘may maintain an action for breach \nof contract’ thereon when he is refused admittance after purchase”).   \nMoreover, SeaWorld’s reliance on the “revocable license” theory of tickets does not \nsupport their argument that ticket purchases cannot give rise to contractual rights.  SeaWorld \ncites Kennedy Theater Ticket Service v. Ticketron, Inc., a case in which the court observed, as \npart of an analysis of whether the sale of tickets qualifies as a “commodity” under the Robinson-\nPatman Act, that “[a]dmission tickets have been uniformly defined as revocable licenses.”  342 \nF. Supp. 922, 925-26 (E.D. Pa. 1972).  However, as Plaintiffs note, in full context the portion of \nKennedy Theater Ticket Service that SeaWorld cites undermines its point.  Immediately \nfollowing the statement that tickets are revocable licenses, the court went on to quote an Oregon \ncase that held: \nIt is true [a ticket] constitutes a contract between the proprietor and the purchaser \nof  the  ticket,  and  whatever  contractual  duties  grow  out  of  such  relation  the \nproprietor is bound to perform or respond in damages for breach of his contract, but \nhe is not liable in an action for trespass or in tort. \nId. (quoting Taylor v. Cohn, 84 P. 388, 388 (Or. 1906)).  SeaWorld argues that this quotation can \nbe disregarded, as Oregon Supreme Court cases are not binding on this Court.  However, \nKennedy Theater Ticket Service also cited a United States Supreme Court case, Marrone v. \nWashington Jockey Club of the District of Columbia, in support of its classification of tickets as \nrevocable licenses.  And Marrone made the same point that the Oregon case Taylor did—\n7 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 8 of 26\nalthough classifying tickets as licenses renders tort remedies unavailable, a ticket purchase does \ncreate a contract: \nThe fact that the purchase of the ticket made a contract is not enough.  A contract \nbinds the person of the maker, but does not create an interest in the property that it \nmay concern, unless it also operates as a conveyance.  The ticket was not a \nconveyance of an interest in the race track, not only because it was not under seal, \nbut because by common understanding it did not purport to have that effect.  There \nwould be obvious inconveniences if it were construed otherwise.  But if it did not \ncreate such an interest, that is to say, a right in rem, valid against the landowner and \nthird persons, the holder had no right to enforce specific performance by self-help. \nHis only right was to sue upon the contract for the breach.  It is true that if the \ncontract were incidental to a right of property either in the land or in goods upon \nthe land, there might be an irrevocable right of entry; but when the contract stands \nby itself, it must be either a conveyance or a license, subject to be revoked. \n 227 U.S. 633, 636-37 (1913) (emphasis added).  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has come to \nthe same conclusion: \nWhen [a proprietor] sells a ticket he creates contractual relations with the holder of \nit, and whatever duties on his part grow out of these relations he is bound to \nperform, or respond in damages for the breach of his contract. . . . [A] theater ticket \nis to be regarded as a mere license, for the revocation of which, before the holder \nhas actually been given his seat and has taken it, the only remedy is in assumpsit \nfor the breach of the contract. \nHorney v. Nixon, 61 A. 1088, 1089-90 (Pa. 1905). \nIn other words, the “revocable license theory” concerns the scope of the ticketholder’s \nright to be present on land and, therefore, the question of whether they are entitled to tort \nremedies if removed from the premises.  It does not establish that tickets cannot create \ncontractual rights.  Plaintiffs’ Section 1981 claim will not be dismissed on the grounds that it is \nbased on their ticket purchases.  \nb.  Impairment of a Contractual Right \nSeaWorld next argues that Plaintiffs fail to state a Section 1981 claim because they were \nnot entitled to interactions with the character performers who allegedly ignored them, and they \ntherefore have not alleged the impairment or denial of a contractual right.  “[I]n order to satisfy \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 9 of 26\nthe foundational pleading requirements for a suit under section 1981, a retail customer must \nallege that he was actually denied the ability either to make, perform, enforce, modify, or \nterminate a contract, or to enjoy the fruits of a contractual relationship, by reason of a race-based \nanimus.”  Garrett v. Tandy Corp., 295 F.3d 94, 100-01 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing Morris v. Dillard \nDep’t Stores, Inc., 277 F.3d 743, 752 (5th Cir. 2001); Hampton v. Dillard Dep’t Stores, Inc., 247 \nF.3d 1091, 1118 (10th Cir. 2001); Morris v. Office Max, Inc., 89 F.3d 411, 414 (7th Cir. 1996)). \nBut the interpretation of the Amended Complaint’s allegations offered in SeaWorld’s \nMotion (that it rests on a theory that Plaintiffs were entitled to—but did not get—interactions \nwith the character performers), tells only half the story.  Plaintiffs make two allegations in their \nComplaint regarding SeaWorld’s obligations to provide interactions with character performers.  \nFirst, they allege that “SeaWorld’s costumer character performers were obligated to not refuse \nto, on the basis of race interact with SeaWorld’s customers. . . . ”  (emphasis added)  Second, \nthey allege that Plaintiffs “were entitled to SeaWorld’s performance of the contract by way of its \ncostume character performers to interact with” their children.  Plaintiffs’ counsel clarified at the \nhearing, however, that despite including the second allegation, Plaintiffs are not alleging that \nthey were contractually guaranteed interactions with the performers.  Instead, the crux of \nPlaintiffs’ contentions, as relevant on a motion to dismiss, is that interactions were refused to \nminority patrons, but freely given to White patrons.   \nPrimarily in response to this second argument, SeaWorld highlights a disclaimer in the \nBurns Plaintiffs’ tickets that park content is “subject to change without notice” to argue that \nPlaintiffs were not entitled to participate in any particular park activity.  However, it concedes—\ncorrectly—that it could not contract itself out of Section 1981 liability by reserving the right to \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 10 of 26\nchange the terms or availability of park content in violation of anti-discrimination laws.5  See \nRockwell v. Pa. State Horse Racing Comm’n, 327 A.2d 211, 212-13 (Pa. Commw. 1974) (The \nright of private enterprises to refuse service “has been made subject now, of course, to civil \nrights statutes which prohibit the exclusion of persons from all places of public accommodation \nwhen such exclusion is based solely on the race . . . of the persons seeking admission.”); Barfield \nv. Com. Bank, N.A., 484 F.3d 1276, 1280 (10th Cir. 2007) (holding that a Black plaintiff stated a \nSection 1981 claim where a bank refused his request to make change for a $50 bill, but did make \nchange for White customers); McCaleb v. Pizza Hut of Am., Inc., 28 F. Supp.2d 1043, 1047-48 \n(N.D. Ill. 1998) (finding that plaintiffs were denied the full enjoyment of their contract even \nthough they were “provided their pizza and permitted to eat it” because defendants “failed to \nprovide them with the proper utensils” and “created a disturbing atmosphere”); Perry v. Burger \nKing Corp., 924 F. Supp. 548, 550-52 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (denying summary judgment on \nplaintiff’s Section 1981 claim alleging he was denied use of restaurant’s bathroom after finishing \nhis meal); cf. Arguello v. Conoco, Inc., 330 F.3d 355, 360-61 (5th Cir. 2003) (“[D]ining at a \nrestaurant generally involves a contractual relationship that continues over the course of the meal \nand entitles the customer to benefits in addition to the meal purchased.”).      \nAdditionally, SeaWorld argued in its Motion that Plaintiffs’ allegations were not \ncognizable under Section 1981 because they appeared to be premised on subjective satisfaction \nwith the park experience.  SeaWorld interpreted Plaintiffs’ allegations that they were deprived of \nthe “enjoyment” of park attractions—for example, when Plaintiffs allege they contracted with \nSeaWorld for “the benefit and privilege of enjoyment of the amusement rides”—to mean \nPlaintiffs brought this suit to remedy feelings of disappointment.  Plaintiffs’ attorney clarified at \n \n5 Moreover, this language only appears on the Burns Plaintiffs’ two-day tickets, and not in the tickets or passes \npurchased by other Plaintiffs. \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 11 of 26\nthe hearing that they mean “enjoyment” in a narrower, more objective sense—their right to avail \nthemselves of contractual rights.  SeaWorld agrees that this use of the word comports with the \ntext of Section 1981, which protects the right to “the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, \nand conditions of the contractual relationship.”  42 U.S.C. § 1981(b).    \nHowever, SeaWorld continues to argue that Plaintiffs’ tickets entitled them to nothing \nmore than entrance to the park and access to its attractions, relying on Mayer v. Belichick, 605 \nF.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2010).  Mayer, a case arising from the NFL “Spygate” scandal, did not involve \na Section 1981 claim and is distinguishable.  In Mayer, the crux of the plaintiff’s claim was that \nNew York Jets ticketholders had contracted for tickets “to observe an honest match played in \ncompliance with all laws, regulations and NFL rules” and were deprived of that interest by the \nNew England Patriots’ cheating.  Id. at 225.  The Third Circuit disagreed, holding that the \nplaintiff had contracted to observe specified NFL games, which he did.  Id. at 236.  Plaintiffs’ \nclaims here are not that they were merely disappointed with the quality of the interactive events, \nbut that Sesame Place provides minority patrons with a markedly different experience than \nWhite patrons.  In Mayer, which made no allegation of differential or discriminatory treatment, \nall ticketholders observed the same game.  Here, Plaintiffs allege that White child participants in \n“Meet and Greets” and parades received interactions with Sesame Street characters, while \nminority children received the furry cold shoulder. \nSeaWorld also argues that Plaintiffs’ theory of harm would lead to unbounded liability \nunder Section 1981, analogizing Plaintiffs’ claims to a hypothetical situation in which a Black \ncustomer “wanted an ice cream cone and stood in line only to find that the vendor just sold the \nlast ice cream cone to a white customer[.]”  The analogy is inapt, as Section 1981’s requirement \nthat plaintiffs show intentional racial discrimination would preclude such a claim.  See, e.g., \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 12 of 26\nLizardo v. Denny’s Inc., 2000 WL 976808, at *4 (N.D.N.Y. July 13, 2000) (holding that Asian-\nAmerican plaintiffs who alleged White customers were seated before them did not state a Section \n1981 claim because the White customers were a smaller party, and the table would not have \naccommodated plaintiffs’ larger party).  Plaintiffs have alleged more than that (a) they were \ndenied interactions with costumed characters for race-neutral reasons like the one posited in \nSeaWorld’s hypothetical, and (b) they are racial minorities.  Rather, their allegations are that the \ncostumed characters repeatedly ignored minority children while engaging with similarly situated \nWhite children—i.e., they were denied a benefit of their contract because of racial \ndiscrimination, and SeaWorld performs its contracts with its White and minority patrons on \ndifferent terms.  See Hall v. Pa. State Police, 570 F.2d 86, 92 (3d Cir. 1978) (reversing dismissal \nof Section 1981 claim premised on defendant bank’s policy of taking security photographs of \nentering Black customers, which constituted “offer[ing] its services under different terms \ndependent on race”); Brown, 250 F.3d at 797 (affirming dismissal of plaintiffs’ Section 1981 \nclaim because “[s]ignificantly, Black Smokers do not allege that the mentholated tobacco \nproducts sold to African-Americans differ from those sold to whites”).  Accordingly, the analogy \noffered up by SeaWorld as modified for the allegations made here would be that a Black \ncustomer wanted an ice cream cone and stood in line only to find upon reaching the front of the \nline that although there was a freezer full of ice cream still to be sold, the purveyor refused to sell \nit to him or any other Black person in line—choosing to sell only to the White people in line.  At \nthis stage, Plaintiffs have adequately alleged the impairment of a contractual interest for their \nSection 1981 claim to proceed. \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 13 of 26\nc.  Adequacy of Comparators  \nIn addition to alleging that Plaintiffs were not deprived of a contract interest, SeaWorld \nargues that Plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege that racial discrimination was the but-for \ncause of their injuries—i.e., that they were denied interactions with character performers because \nof their race, as required by Section 1981.  See Comcast Corp., 140 S. Ct. at 1018.  SeaWorld \ndoes not contest that Plaintiffs may show intentional discrimination through “comparator” \nevidence, meaning favorable treatment of similarly situated White customers.  See Golod v. Bank \nof Am. Corp., 403 F. App’x 699, 702 n.2 (3d Cir. 2010) (citing Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 \nU.S. 506, 511-12 (2002)) (At the pleading stage, an inference of racial discrimination can “be \nsupported in a number of ways, including, but not limited to, comparator evidence. . . . ”).  \nInstead, it provides a strained and overly semantic reading of Plaintiffs’ allegations to argue they \nhave not actually alleged that the characters who ignored them interacted instead with White \npatrons.  This reading is not a basis to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Section 1981 claim. \nEach Plaintiff family’s allegations focus on a particular costumed performer’s refusal to \ninteract with their children.  The Fleming family, for example, alleges that the performer dressed \nas Telly Monster “intentionally refused to perform SeaWorld’s contract with the Flemings and \nthe Class by, inter alia, refusing to engage with them.”  Plaintiffs then allege that, in contrast, \nSesame Place’s costumed performers collectively “readily engaged with numerous similarly \nsituated white customers and their children” participating in the Meet and Greets and parades.  \nRead together, Plaintiffs are clearly alleging that the particular character that ignored them (e.g., \nTelly Monster), along with the other performers, readily engaged with White customers.  \nSeaWorld, however, would narrowly parse the allegations to require that Plaintiffs specifically \nreiterate that Telly Monster, or whichever specific characters each Plaintiff focuses on, interacted \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 14 of 26\nwith White children after ignoring the child Plaintiffs.  Otherwise, they contend, Plaintiffs would \nconflate the actions of separate performers and seek to hold, for example, Telly Monster \nresponsible for Big Bird’s actions.  Given that Plaintiffs broader allegation that Sesame Place \nperformers readily engaged with White children—a group that includes the individual \nperformers named as refusing to interact with Plaintiffs—meets their pleading burden, the \nexercise SeaWorld suggests is unwarranted, at least on a motion-to-dismiss standard.  \nSeaWorld’s Motion will be denied as to Plaintiffs’ Section 1981 claim.      \niii.  Negligence \nPlaintiffs’ second cause of action alleges that SeaWorld was negligent under five \ntheories: (1) premises liability, by “[f]ailing to provide a reasonably safe premises for all \nbusiness invitees, including Plaintiffs and Class Members”; (2) negligence per se, by “[v]iolating \nthe standards set forth by applicable state, federal, and local regulations and codes against \ndiscriminatory conduct, including 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and Pennsylvania Human Relations Act 42 \nP.S. §§ 953, 954”; (3) negligent hiring by, for example, “[f]ailing to screen and perform \nbackground checks [of] potential employees to ensure that no employee has a propensity for \nracial discrimination”; (4) negligent training by, for example, “[f]ailing to use, require and \nenforce policies and procedures that ensure the . . . training of employees who do not engage in \nracial discrimination”; and (5) negligent supervision by, for example, “[f]ailing to monitor its \nemployees.”  During the May 9 hearing on this Motion, Plaintiffs withdrew their premises \nliability theory.   \nUnder Pennsylvania law, “[t]o establish a cause of action in negligence, the plaintiff must \ndemonstrate that [1] the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, [2] the defendant \nbreached that duty, [3] the breach resulted in injury to the plaintiff, and [4] the plaintiff suffered \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 15 of 26\nan actual loss or damage.”  Martin v. Evans, 711 A.2d 458, 461 (Pa. 1998).  Plaintiffs premise \ntheir negligence claim on the assertion that SeaWorld “assumed a duty to provide a park \nexperience that is free of discrimination based upon race or color.”  SeaWorld argues that there is \nno such duty in negligence recognized under Pennsylvania law and, therefore, the negligence \nclaim must be dismissed.  See Gibbs v. Ernst, 647 A.2d 882, 890 (Pa. 1994) (“Any action in \nnegligence is premised on the existence of a duty owed by one party to another.”).  Because \nPlaintiffs premise their claim on multiple theories of negligence liability, and Pennsylvania \ncourts have outlined different frameworks defining the duty owed under each of them, each \ntheory will be addressed separately below.  \na.  Negligence Per Se \nPlaintiffs allege that SeaWorld is liable for negligence because it violated federal and \nstate anti-discrimination laws, including Section 1981.  This theory of liability is based on the \ndoctrine of negligence per se, which provides that the violation of “an applicable statute, \nordinance, or regulation designed to prevent a public harm” establishes “the elements of duty and \nbreach of duty” in a negligence claim.  Schemberg v. Smicherko, 85 A.3d 1071, 1074 (Pa. Super. \n2014) (quoting Mahan v. Am-Gard, Inc., 841 A.2d 1052, 1058-59 (Pa. Super. 2003)). \nNegligence per se allows the violation of a statute to serve as evidence of a breach of \nduty if four requirements are met: \n(1) The purpose of the statute must be, at least in part, to protect the interest of a \ngroup of individuals, as opposed to the public generally; \n(2) The statute or regulation must clearly apply to the conduct of the defendant; \n(3) The defendant must violate the statute or regulation; \n(4) The violation of the statute or regulation must be the proximate cause of the \nplaintiff’s injuries. \nId.   \n  An applicable statute, meaning one that can serve as the basis for a negligence per se \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 16 of 26\nclaim, then, is one that “clearly indicate[s] an intention to protect specific groups from specific \ntypes of harm.”  Id. at 1075.  Here, Section 1981 is such a statute.  See Hassett v. Dafoe, 74 A.3d \n202, 216 (Pa. Super. 2013) (“A federal regulation may establish the standard of care appropriate \nto the underlying tort of negligence per se under state tort law.”).6  It is “intended to protect from \ndiscrimination identifiable classes of persons who are subjected to intentional discrimination \nsolely because of their ancestry or ethnic characteristics,” Saint Francis Coll. v. Al-Khazraji, 481 \nU.S. 604, 613 (1987), in the making and enforcing of contracts, 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a).  And, as \ndiscussed above, Plaintiffs have adequately alleged the additional requirements for a negligence \nper se claim—that Section 1981 applied to SeaWorld’s conduct, that SeaWorld violated Section \n1981, and that the violation caused Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries.7  SeaWorld’s Motion will be \ndenied as to Plaintiffs’ negligence per se theory.  \nb.  Negligent Hiring \nPlaintiffs next allege that SeaWorld was negligent in its hiring practices because it failed \nto implement screening and background check procedures to ensure that prospective employees \ndid not have “a propensity for racial discrimination.”  Under Pennsylvania law an employer is \n \n6 The case SeaWorld relies on in arguing that Plaintiffs cannot use evidence of a Section 1981 violation to establish \nthe duty element of their negligence claim, Levin v. Dollar Tree Stores, Inc., 2006 WL 3538964 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 6, \n2006), is inapposite.  In Levin, the plaintiff alleged he was physically injured by a curb at the defendant’s store and \nsued the defendant for negligence.  2006 WL 3538964, at *1.  The Levin court held that the plaintiff could not use \nviolations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (the “ADA”) as proof of a breach of duty because the ADA makes \n“no mention of promoting safety or eliminating hazards,” and is instead concerned with preventing discrimination.  \nId. at *3.  “While evidence that a condition was in violation of a safety statute” would have been relevant to the \nplaintiff’s claim, “[t]he ADA has no bearing on whether there was a dangerous condition on the property of which \ndefendants knew or should have known.”  Id.  In other words, the focus of the statute the Levin plaintiff attempted to \nuse for his negligence per se claim (discrimination) and the duty he invoked (preventing physical injury) did not \ncorrespond.  Plaintiffs’ claim here does not present a similar problem, as the duty they put forth and the focus of the \nstatute they invoke are the same—racial discrimination.   \n7 Negligence per se allows the violation of a statute to establish the duty and breach elements of a negligence claim.  \nTo recover, a plaintiff must further prove “that [the defendant’s] negligence was the proximate cause of the injury \nsuffered.”  Schemberg, 85 A.3d at 1074.  Plaintiffs here allege that the injury they suffered was “endur[ing] blatant, \npublic and demeaning racial discrimination.”  SeaWorld only challenges the duty element of Plaintiffs’ negligence \nclaim and has presented no argument that Plaintiffs have inadequately pled causation, \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 17 of 26\nliable for negligent hiring if: “[1] he knew or should have known that his employee had a \npropensity for violence and [2] such employment might create a situation where the violence \nwould harm a third person.”  Coath v. Jones, 419 A.2d 1249, 1250 (Pa. Super. 1980).  An \nemployer also “may be negligent for the failure to exercise reasonable care in determining an \nemployee’s propensity for violence.”  Id. (citing Dempsey v. Walso Bureau, Inc., 246 A.2d 418 \n(Pa. 1968)).   \nIn Dempsey, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of a negligent hiring \nclaim based on allegations that the plaintiff was assaulted by a fellow employee, who “pulled \n[plaintiff] out of his chair, bent him over backwards and pinioned him, with his knee in \n[plaintiff’s] back, for several minutes despite his protests,” and limited negligent hiring claims to \nviolent or physically dangerous employee conduct.  246 A.2d at 419.  The court framed the issue \nas one of whether the employee’s prior conduct indicated that the employer “did not exercise \nreasonable care in its selection and should not have hired a person inclined to violence.”  Id.  In \nreviewing the history of negligent hiring claims based either on common law or the Restatement \n(Second) of Torts § 317, the court repeatedly highlighted that negligent hiring claims evaluate an \nemployee’s propensity for violence, inflicting injury, or physically dangerous behavior.  The \ncourt discussed, for example, the statement in Najera v. Southern Pacific Co., 13 Cal. Rptr. 146, \n148 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1961), that “the knowing Employment of a dangerous employee who \ninflicts injury upon a fellow employee constitutes a common law tort on the part of the \nemployer,” id. at 421; the instruction in Dincher v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., 51 A.2d \n710, 714 (1947) that liability required that an “employee not only had exhibited a violent temper \nat times but that it was accompanied by acts of violence on his part and that the employer ‘knew, \nor in the exercise of ordinary care, should have known of such violent and reckless conduct on \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 18 of 26\n(the employee’s) part,’” id.; and the holding in Fletcher v. Baltimore & Potomac R. Co., 168 \nU.S. 135, 141 (1897) that an employer has a “duty to see that its employees do not act in a \nmanner dangerous to other persons,” id. at 422.  See also id. at 420-21 (summarizing Frazier v. \nPennsylvania Railroad Co., 38 Pa. 104 (1858) in which an railroad company was held liable for \nan accident “because it had, knowingly or negligently, employed a conductor who was careless” \nand Rosenstiel v. Pittsburgh Railways Co., 79 A. 556 (Pa. 1911), in which a railroad was held \nliable for an employee’s accidental killing caused by an employee who “was incompetent and \ncareless and [whose] incompetency and carelessness was known”).  Ultimately, the Dempsey \ncourt affirmed the trial court’s findings that the assaulting employee’s conduct had not put the \ndefendant-employer “on notice of any dangerous propensity” on his part.  Id. at 423.  Although \nthe employee’s conduct constituted “horse-play,” it could not support liability because it “did not \nshow a propensity . . . which was vicious or dangerous and which indicated that he intended to \ninflict injury upon others.”  Id. \n  This limitation of negligent hiring claims to violent propensities has been followed for \nthe most part by Pennsylvania’s intermediate appellate courts.  See Brezenski v. World Truck \nTransfer, Inc., 755 A.2d 36, 42 (Pa. Super. 2000) (citing Dempsey) (“[A]n employer may be held \nnegligent for the failure to exercise reasonable care in determining an employee’s propensity for \nviolence in an employment situation where the violence would harm a third person.”); Costa v. \nRoxborough Mem’l. Hosp., 708 A.2d 490, 496-97 (Pa. Super. 1998) (citing Dempsey) (analyzing \nwhether an employer “knew or had reason to know of any actions on [its employee’s] part which \nindicated a propensity for violence or physical assault upon others, or that a more extensive \nhiring procedure would have uncovered such behavior”).  In one case, the Pennsylvania Superior \nCourt has appeared to expand the potential scope of negligent hiring claims beyond physical \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 19 of 26\nviolence to conduct for which an employee could be found liable more generally.  See Heller v. \nPatwil Homes, Inc., 713 A.2d 105, 108-09 (Pa. Super. 1998) (analyzing whether an employer \nwas negligent in failing to perform a background check of an employee who later perpetrated an \ninvestment scam if the employee’s conduct “indicate[d] a propensity for illegal activity”).  \nHowever, on matters of Pennsylvania law, this Court is “bound by the Pennsylvania Supreme \nCourt’s interpretation of current state law.”  Barradas Jacome v. Att’y Gen. U.S., 39 F.4th 111, \n124 (3d Cir. 2022) (citing Johnson v. United States, 559 U.S. 133, 138 (2010)).  Therefore \nDempsey, which grounds negligent hiring liability in an employee’s propensity for violence, \ncontrols.    \nPlaintiffs’ allegations do not concern any propensity for violence in SeaWorld’s \nemployees.  Instead, they concern the employees’ “propensity for racial discrimination.”  As a \nresult, Plaintiffs’ negligence claim will be dismissed with prejudice to the extent it is based on a \nnegligent hiring theory.  \nc.  Negligent Training \nPlaintiffs’ next set of allegations concerns SeaWorld’s failure to train its employees to \navoid and recognize racial discrimination and implicit bias.  Plaintiffs allege SeaWorld was \nnegligent by failing to train its employees “to avoid racial discrimination in customer \ninteractions,” “to recognize incidents of racial discrimination between employees and \ncustomers,” “to document and report incident[s] of racial discrimination between employees and \ncustomers,” “to recognize employees who are engaged in racial discrimination of customers,” \nand by failing to “educate employees about racial discrimination and/or implicit bias.”  \nPennsylvania courts have not outlined a specific framework for analyzing a negligent training \nclaim, separate from the general negligence framework of “duty, breach, causation, damages.”  \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 20 of 26\nSee Oldham v. Pa. State Univ., 2022 WL 1528305, at *24 (M.D. Pa. May 13, 2022).  A negligent \ntraining claim therefore requires a plaintiff to “assert that the defendant employer had a duty to \ntrain its employees on a particular issue.”  Bracke v. SiteOne Landscape Supply, LLC, 2022 WL \n1128951, at * 2 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 15, 2022).  Because liability for negligent training “exists only if \nall the requirements of an action of tort for negligence exist,” Brezenski, 755 A.2d at 42 (quoting \nRestatement (Second) of Agency § 213 cmt. a (Am. L. Inst. 1958)), the duty to train is limited to \n“those issues that could themselves give rise to a cause of action for negligence.”  Bracke, 2022 \nWL 1128951, at *2.  In Bracke, for example, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant’s “failure to \ntrain its employees on proper retail theft procedure” led to the filing of a false police report.  Id.  \nThis was an inadequate basis for a negligent training claim as “Pennsylvania law makes clear \nthat there is no cause of action for the negligent reporting of a crime or the negligent initiation of \ncriminal proceedings.”  Id.  \nSeaWorld argues that no duty to train applies to the alleged failures listed in the \nAmended Complaint.  Plaintiffs, for their part, have offered no argument that either a duty to \ntrain employees to avoid or recognize racial discrimination exists under Pennsylvania law, or that \nindependent negligence liability would exist for the underlying employee conduct of racially \ndiscriminating or failing to recognize racial discrimination against customers.  In total, Plaintiffs \ndevoted just over one double-spaced page of their Response to their negligence claim, and cited a \nsingle case—a Third Circuit decision reciting the uncontroversial rule that facts alleged in the \ncomplaint are taken as true for the purposes of a motion to dismiss.  See Malleus v. George, 641 \nF.3d 560, 563 (3d Cir. 2011).  They offered no substantive engagement with SeaWorld’s \nargument that they had not identified a cognizable duty beyond stating that the Amended \nComplaint “establishes that Plaintiffs are alleging a duty owed to them by Defendants.”  But as \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 21 of 26\n“[t]he existence of a duty is a question of law for the court to decide,” R.W. v. Manzek, 888 A.2d \n740, 746 (Pa. 2005), the assertion that a duty exists cannot simply be taken at face value.  When \npressed during the May 9 hearing to identify the source of the duty underlying the negligent \ntraining claim, Plaintiffs’ counsel cited Section 219 of the Restatement (Second) of Agency, \nwhich establishes the general principle that “[a] master is subject to liability for the torts of his \nservants” under certain circumstances.  Restatement (Second) of Agency § 219 (Am. L. Inst. \n1958).  The broad statement that employers can be held vicariously liable for some employee \nactions does not provide an answer to the question raised here—whether Pennsylvania law \nimposes a duty on employers to train their employees to avoid and recognize racial \ndiscrimination against customers.    \nArguments “consisting of no more than a conclusory assertion” lacking supporting \ncitations “will be deemed waived.”  Reynolds v. Wagner, 128 F.3d 166, 178 (3d Cir. 1997); see \nAnthony v. Small Tube Mfg. Corp., 535 F. Supp.2d 506, 511 n.8 (E.D. Pa. 2007) (“Courts in this \nDistrict have consistently held the failure to cite any applicable law is sufficient to deny a motion \nas without merit because ‘zeal and advocacy is never an appropriate substitute for case law and \nstatutory authority in dealings with the Court.’  These same rationales applicable to briefs in \nsupport of motions are equally applicable to opposition briefs.” (internal citations omitted)); E.D. \nPa. Local Civ. R. 7.1(c) (requiring that “[e]very motion not certified as uncontested . . . shall be \naccompanied by a brief containing a concise statement of the legal contentions and authorities \nrelied upon in support” (emphasis added)).  As Plaintiffs have made no coherent response to \nSeaWorld’s argument that this asserted duty does not exist under Pennsylvania law, Plaintiffs’ \nnegligence claim will be dismissed with prejudice to the extent it is based on a negligent training \ntheory.  \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 22 of 26\nd.  Negligent Supervision \nFinally, Plaintiffs allege SeaWorld negligently supervised its employees by “[f]ailing to \nmonitor its employees,” enacting policies that “encouraged and rewarded racial discrimination in \ncustomer interactions,” and failing to properly discipline employees who engaged in \ndiscrimination.8  Further, Plaintiffs repeatedly allege in their Complaint that the employee \nconduct underlying their negligence claim occurred “within the course and scope of [the \nemployees’] employment and/or authority,” allegations inconsistent with a negligent supervision \nclaim: \nTo recover for negligent supervision under Pennsylvania law, a plaintiff must prove \nthat his loss resulted from (1) a failure to exercise ordinary care to prevent an \nintentional harm by an employee acting outside the scope of his employment, (2) \nthat is committed on the employer’s premises, (3) when the employer knows or has \nreason to know of the necessity and ability to control the employee.  \nBelmont v. MB Inv. Partners, Inc., 708 F.3d 470, 488 (3d Cir. 2013) (emphasis added) (citing \nDempsey, 246 A.2d at 420; Heller, 713 A.2d at 107-08).   \nGiven Plaintiffs’ allegations that the employees acted within the scope of their \nemployment, a claim for negligent supervision cannot survive and shall be dismissed without \nprejudice. \nB.  Rule 12(b)(1) \nIn addition to arguing that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), SeaWorld \nargues that Plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief should be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) \nbecause they do not have standing to obtain injunctive relief. \n \n8 Plaintiffs also allege that SeaWorld negligently retained employees by “[f]ailing to fire” or “take any corrective \nactions against employees that engage in racial discrimination against customers, including Plaintiffs.”  The \nPennsylvania Supreme Court has indicated that allegations of negligent retention should be analyzed under the \nnegligent supervision framework, as “[t]here may be circumstances in which the only effective control which the \nmaster can exercise over the conduct of his servant is to discharge the servant.”  Dempsey, 246 A.2d at 420 (quoting \nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 317 cmt. c).  \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 23 of 26\ni.  Legal Standard \n“A motion to dismiss for want of standing is . . . properly brought pursuant to Rule \n12(b)(1), because standing is a jurisdictional matter.”  Ballentine v. United States, 486 F.3d 806, \n810 (3d Cir. 2007).  A plaintiff “bears the burden of showing that he has standing for each type \nof relief sought,” including injunctive relief.  Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493 \n(2009) (citing City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105 (1983)).  “When, as in this case, \nprospective relief is sought, the plaintiff must show that he is ‘likely to suffer future injury’ from \nthe defendant’s conduct.”  McNair v. Synapse Grp., Inc., 672 F.3d 213, 223 (3d Cir. 2012) \n(quoting Lyons, 461 U.S. at 105).  \nA facial attack to subject matter jurisdiction, which SeaWorld brings here, “relies solely \non the pleadings” and is therefore analyzed under “the same standard of review [used] when \nassessing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.”  Schuchardt v. President of the U.S., \n839 F.3d 336, 344 (3d Cir. 2016) (quoting Finkelman v. NFL, 810 F.3d 187, 194 (3d Cir. 2016)).  \nThe court must therefore “only consider the allegations of the complaint and documents \nreferenced therein and attached thereto, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.”  Const. Party \nof Pa. v. Aichele, 757 F.3d 347, 358 (3d Cir. 2014). \nii.  Adequacy of Plaintiffs’ Allegations \nSeaWorld argues Plaintiffs do not have standing to obtain injunctive relief because they \nhave not alleged facts indicating they are likely to experience discriminatory conduct from \nSeaWorld or its employees in the future.  More specifically, SeaWorld argues Plaintiffs lack \nstanding because they have not alleged any intention to return to Sesame Place.  SeaWorld bases \nthis argument in a rule drawn from consumer deceptive advertising lawsuits setting out that \nplaintiffs who do not allege an intention to repurchase a service they claim harmed them cannot \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 24 of 26\nestablish standing to obtain injunctive relief.  McNair, 672 F.3d at 224-26.9  This is because, by \nvirtue of filing their lawsuit, those plaintiffs have demonstrated that they are now on notice of the \nharmful elements they allege.  As, “speaking generally, the law accords people the dignity of \nassuming that they act rationally, in light of the information they possess,” courts cannot \npresume a likelihood of future harm exists without a more definite articulation by the plaintiffs.  \nId. at 225.      \nPlaintiffs here can establish standing through the Willie family, who entered Sesame \nPlace on a season pass that had not expired when this lawsuit was filed.  See id. at 226 \n(“[S]tanding is determined at the outset of the litigation[.]”).  The season pass purchased by the \nWillies, which allows for “future visits” to Sesame Place prior to its January 2, 2023 expiration \ndate, indicates a non-speculative intent on their part to return to the park.10  Somewhat unusually, \nPlaintiffs themselves did not themselves attach copies of their tickets or passes to the Amended \nComplaint, or otherwise quote or reference their terms or text.  It was instead SeaWorld that \nprovided a factual basis for Plaintiffs’ alleged future injury by attaching copies of the tickets and \nseason passes purchased by the Plaintiffs to its Motion to Dismiss.  However, as discussed supra, \nPlaintiffs’ tickets and passes are “documents referenced” in the Amended Complaint, they can \nproperly be considered in resolving a facial challenge to standing brought under Rule 12(b)(1).  \n \n9 In consumer deceptive advertising cases alleging “purely economic” injury, which the Third Circuit has termed \n“stop me before I buy again” claims, injunctive relief is unavailable even if plaintiffs plead an intention to purchase \nthe product or service in the future.  In re Johnson & Johnson Talcum Powder Prods. Mktg. Sales Pracs. & Liab. \nLitig., 903 F.3d 278, 293 (3d Cir. 2018).  Here, the injury Plaintiffs allege is the dignitary harm of experiencing \n“blatant, public and demeaning racial discrimination,” which is outside the scope of In re Johnson & Johnson.   \n10 SeaWorld also argues that Plaintiffs’ “allegations make it clear that they will not [return], given that they now \nbelieve that Sesame Place engages in ‘demeaning racial discrimination’ against children.”  That Plaintiffs have \nalleged demeaning treatment they would presumably avoid experiencing again does not deprive them of standing, as \nplaintiffs may establish standing through a pleaded intention to return to a defendant’s business “but for the \ndiscrimination [they] would experience there.”  Yucis v. Sears Outlet Stores, LLC, 813 F. App’x 780, 787 (3d Cir. \n2020). \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 25 of 26\nConst. Party of Pa., 757 F.3d at 358. \n“As a general rule, in an injunctive case, [a court] need not address the standing of each \nplaintiff if it concludes that one plaintiff has standing.”  Pennsylvania v. DeJoy, 556 F. Supp.3d \n461, 484 n.33 (E.D. Pa. 2021) (citing Freedom from Religion Found. Inc. v. New Kensington \nArnold Sch. Dist., 832 F.3d 469, 481 n.14 (3d Cir. 2016)).  The Willies’ season passes therefore \nsuffice to overcome SeaWorld’s motion to dismiss for lack of standing, which will be denied.  \nC.  Valdez and Willie Plaintiffs  \nFinally, SeaWorld moves to dismiss the Valdez and Willie Plaintiffs, who entered \nSesame Place on season passes rather than single-day tickets.  SeaWorld argues that the terms \nand conditions of the season passes contain a class action waiver clause which states: “Any and \nall disputes, claims, and causes of action arising out of or connected with this contract or the use \nof any park or membership SHALL BE RESOLVED INDIVIDUALLY, WITHOUT \nRESORT TO ANY FORM OF CLASS ACTION.”  Accordingly, it argues that  \nas these plaintiffs cannot serve as class representatives, they must be dismissed.11  Again, as \ndiscussed above, supra, terms and conditions extrinsic to the tickets and passes referenced in the \nAmended Complaint cannot properly be considered in deciding this Motion.  The season passes \nattached to SeaWorld’s Motion do not themselves include the terms and conditions referenced by \nSeaWorld, but rather contain the single sentence: “Please refer to EZpay terms and conditions.”  \nThe EZ Pay Terms and Conditions attached by SeaWorld to its Motion state that customers agree \nto those Terms and Conditions by “entering this site,” presumably referring to \n \n11 Plaintiffs note that SeaWorld tries to have it both ways by arguing that the season passes are not contracts for the \npurposes of dismissing the Plaintiffs’ Section 1981 claims, but their terms and conditions are binding for purposes of \nenforcing the class action waiver against the Valdez and Willie Plaintiffs.  In its Reply SeaWorld maintains, without \nelaboration or citation, that these positions are consistent.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 48   Filed 06/05/23   Page 26 of 26\nseaworldentertainment.com.  As Plaintiffs argue, at this stage in the proceedings it is not possible \nto determine whether either the Valdez or Willie families did in fact agree to these terms when \nthey purchased their season passes—the Amended Complaint alleges they purchased tickets, \nwithout specifying whether online or in person or subject to which collateral agreements.  See \nHerman v. SeaWorld Parks & Ent., Inc., 320 F.R.D. 271, 280 (M.D. Fla. 2017) (“A customer \nmay purchase an EZ Pay pass to one of SeaWorld’s parks in one of three ways: 1) through \nSeaWorld’s website for the particular park; 2) over the phone; or 3) at the gate of the SeaWorld \npark.”).  SeaWorld’s Motion will be denied as to the Valdez and Willie Plaintiffs on the basis of \nthe purported class action waiver.    \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, SeaWorld’s Motion will be granted in part and denied in \npart.  The Motion will be denied as to Plaintiffs’ Section 1981 claims, their claims for injunctive \nrelief, and as to the Valdez and Willie Plaintiffs on the basis of the purported class action waiver.  \nThe Motion will be granted in part as to Plaintiffs’ negligence claim: it will be granted as to their \nnegligent hiring and negligent training theories, which will be dismissed with prejudice; granted \nas to their negligent supervision theory, which will be dismissed without prejudice; and denied as \nto their negligence per se theory.    \nAn appropriate order follows.   \nBY THE COURT: \n \n \n \n/s/ Wendy Beetlestone \n_______________________________             \n              WENDY BEETLESTONE, J. \n26 \n ",

R. Civ. P. \n15(a)(2), 16(b)(4), to reflect the broader proposed class that they seek to certify in their Motion \nfor Class Certification and to include a negligent supervision claim that previously was \ndismissed without prejudice.  Burns v. SeaWorld Parks & Ent., Inc., 2023 WL 3821810, at *11 \n(E.D. Pa. June 5, 2023).  For the reasons that follow, that motion will be granted in part and \ndenied in part.1  \nI.  BACKGROUND \nThis case arises out of allegations of racial discrimination at Defendant SeaWorld Parks \n& Entertainment, Inc.’s (“SeaWorld”) amusement park Sesame Place Philadelphia (“Sesame \nPlace”) in Langhorne, Pennsylvania.  Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint alleged violations of \n \n1 As a preliminary matter, Plaintiffs’ Motion proposing a broader class need not be analyzed under Rules 15 and 16 \nbecause “modification of a class definition is contemplated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, see Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(c)(1), and a court ‘is not bound by the class definition proposed in the complaint.’”  Gates v. Rohm and Haas \nCo., 265 F.R.D. 208, 215 n.10 (E.D. Pa. 2010), aff’d, 655 F.3d 255 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Robidoux v. Celani, 987 \nF.2d 931, 937 (2d Cir. 1993)); see also Weisfeld v. Sun Chem. Corp., 84 F. App’x 257, 259 (3d Cir. 2004) (not \nprecedential) (relying on the same principle).  Accordingly, Plaintiffs may proceed using the proposed class on \nwhich class certification briefing already has been filed, and only Plaintiffs’ proposed addition of the negligent \nsupervision claim is at issue here. \n \n\n42 U.S.C. § 1981 and negligence.2  In partially granting SeaWorld’s Motion to Dismiss, the \nCourt disaggregated Plaintiffs’ negligence claim based on the various theories asserted, one \nbeing a claim for negligent supervision.  Burns, 2023 WL 3821810, at *7.  Such a claim requires \nproof that: (1) the defendant “fail[ed] to exercise ordinary care to prevent an intentional harm by \nan employee acting outside the scope of his employment;” (2) the harm took place on the \nemployer’s premises; and, (3) the employer “knows or has reason to know of the necessity and \nability to control the employee.”  Belmont v. MB Inv. Partners, Inc., 708 F.3d 470, 487-88 (3d \nCir. 2013) (citations omitted).  This claim was dismissed without prejudice, Burns, 2023 WL \n3821810, at *11, and only Plaintiffs’ Section 1981 and negligence per se claims proceeded to \ndiscovery, id. at *13.   \nThe Second Amended Complaint differs from its predecessor in two important respects.  \nFirst, in its operative Complaint, Plaintiffs identify thirty distinct alleged breaches of SeaWorld’s \nduty not to violate their civil rights as part of an overarching claim for “negligence” (ECF No. 25 \nat 22).  Several of these allegations touched lightly on the elements of a negligent supervision \nclaim.  Id. at 23 (Am. Compl. ¶ 127(c)-(f)).  The Second Amended Complaint replaces these \nconclusory allegations with deposition testimony from current and former SeaWorld employees \nwith varying levels of seniority who were able to describe Sesame Place’s hiring relationship \nwith high schools in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, the park’s recruiting and training practices, \nand the volume of complaints about discrimination that the park was receiving (ECF No. 123-1 \nat 24-29).  Second, Plaintiffs’ proposed Second Amended Complaint includes a broader range of \nallegations of racial discrimination.  In addition to the allegations that employees portraying \nSesame Street characters refused to interact with the Named Plaintiffs’ children because of their \n \n2 Plaintiffs filed their original complaint on July 27, 2022 (ECF No. 1) and filed their operative First Amended \nComplaint on September 28, 2022 (ECF No. 25). \n2 \n \n\nrace, Plaintiffs allege that SeaWorld received complaints about discrimination across “all aspects \nof the park, including swimming pools, park water rides, park amusement rides, park parades, \npark staff assistance, and park food concession lines.”  Id. at 27 (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 130(n)).  \nII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  Good Cause Under Rule 16(b)(4) \nFirst, because granting leave to amend would require modifying the scheduling order in \nthis case—albeit slightly—the moving party must establish “good cause” for the amendment.  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(4); Premier Comp Sols., LLC v. UPMC, 970 F.3d 316, 319 (3d Cir. 2020).  \nThe “good cause” inquiry “depends in part on a plaintiff’s diligence.”  Premier Comp Sols., 970 \nF.3d at 319 (citing Race Tires Am., Inc. v. Hoosier Racing Tire Corp., 614 F.3d 57, 84-85 (3d \nCir. 2010); E. Mins. & Chems. Co. v. Mahan, 225 F.3d 330, 340 (3d Cir. 2010)).  In that the facts \nsupporting the amendment were recently disclosed, there is good cause to allow the proposed \namendment.  Rogers v. Wilmington Tr. Co., 2022 WL 621690, at *6 & n.47 (3d Cir. Mar. 3, \n2022), cert. denied, 143 S. Ct. 406 (2022) (not precedential); accord Harris v. FedEx Nat’l LTL, \nInc., 760 F.3d 780, 786 (8th Cir. 2014). \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs maintain that they have learned through discovery information that \nwill “allow[] them to cure deficiencies in their previously dismissed claim for negligent \nsupervision.”  SeaWorld characterizes their Motion as focusing solely on whether there is new \nevidence that their employees were acting outside the scope of employment and argues that no \nsuch evidence has been identified.  Indeed, the Court dismissed their negligent supervision claim \nwithout prejudice for failure to plausibly plead that element.  Burns, 2023 WL 3821810, at *11.  \nBut, as mentioned above, that was far from the only problem with the original negligent \nsupervision claim: the operative Complaint contained few of the detailed factual allegations that \n3 \n \n\nmake up Plaintiffs’ new negligent supervision claim (ECF No. 123-1 at 23-29).  These \nallegations, based on information that Plaintiffs learned through discovery, bolster other \nelements of the claim, such as whether SeaWorld knew or should have known that their \nemployees were likely to discriminate against racial minorities who visited Sesame Place.  \nBelmont, 708 F.3d at 488.  True, as SeaWorld points out, some of this information came to light \nearly in discovery and formed the basis for Plaintiffs’ opposition to their motion to strike class \nallegations (ECF No. 44).  But this is not a case where “the party knows or is in possession of the \ninformation that forms the basis of the later motion to amend at the outset of the litigation” such \nthat Plaintiffs are “presumptively not diligent.”  Price v. Trans Union, LLC, 737 F. Supp.2d 276, \n280 (E.D. Pa. 2010) (citations omitted).  In addition to the evidence that SeaWorld identifies, \nPlaintiffs’ Motion also relies on testimony from witnesses who were not deposed until the very \nend of an extended discovery period that augmented these allegations, especially with respect to \nthe liability of Sesame Place’s corporate parents.  Because Plaintiffs’ negligent supervision claim \nrelies in part on recently discovered information, they have been diligent, Rogers, 2022 WL \n621690, at *6, and they have satisfied Rule 16’s “good cause” standard, Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(4). \nB.  Leave to Amend Under Rule 15(a)(2) \nEven if a party can establish “good cause” for the amendment under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 16(b)(4), it still must satisfy “Rule 15(a)’s more liberal standard.”  Premier Comp \nSols., 970 F.3d at 319.  That rule instructs that district courts “should freely give leave when \njustice so requires.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2).  “Denial of leave to amend can be based on undue \ndelay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant; . . . prejudice to the opposing party; \nand futility.”  Mullin v. Balicki, 875 F.3d 140, 149 (3d Cir. 2017); see Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. \n178, 182 (1962).  SeaWorld bears the burden of showing that one of these grounds is present \n4 \n \n\nhere.  Chancellor v. Pottsgrove Sch. Dist., 501 F. Supp.2d 695, 700-01 (E.D. Pa. 2007); see also \nHeyl & Patterson Int’l, Inc. v. F.D. Rich Housing of V.I., Inc., 663 F.2d 419, 426 (3d Cir. 1981).  \n“A decision on whether to permit amendment of the pleadings generally falls within the District \nCourt’s discretion,” Mullin, 875 F.3d at 150, and “a court is not required to grant leave to amend \nin every instance where leave is sought,” Long v. Bristol Twp., 2012 WL 3517347, at *2 (E.D. \nPa. Aug. 14, 2012) (quoting Schutter v. Herskowitz, 2008 WL 2726921, at *7 (E.D. Pa. July 11, \n2008)).  With one narrow exception, none of these grounds applies here. \ni.  Futility \nSeaWorld argues that leave to amend should be denied as futile, which is grounds to deny \nthe motion where the additional allegations “would fail to state a claim upon which relief could \nbe granted,” as under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  Shane v. Fauver, 213 F.3d 113, \n115 (3d Cir. 2000) (citation omitted).  In other words, if the proposed complaint does not \n“contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on \nits face,’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 \nU.S. 544, 570 (2007)), amendment is futile and the motion must be denied.  “A claim has facial \nplausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Id.  The complaint must be \nconstrued “in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,” with the question being “whether, under \nany reasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.”  Fowler \nv. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2009) (quotation omitted).   \na.  Preemption \nIn opposing Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to Amend, SeaWorld argues that Plaintiffs’ \nclaim is preempted by the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (“PHRA”), 43 Pa. C.S. § 951 et \n5 \n \n\nseq., because it “arises out of alleged race discrimination that could have been brought under” \nthat law’s ban on discrimination in public accommodations.  For the reasons set forth below, this \nargument is refuted: Plaintiffs’ negligent supervision claim arises out of facts unrelated to a \ndiscrimination claim that would need to be brought under the PHRA and, accordingly, is not \npreempted by the PHRA.  Explaining why requires a review of the law’s text, structure, and \npolicy rationale.  It enumerates a list of rights, provides for a remedy to vindicate those rights, \nand lays out a procedure for doing so.  Section five provides that it is “an unlawful \ndiscriminatory practice” for, among other things, “any person being the owner, lessee, proprietor, \nmanager . . . or employe of any public accommodation, resort or amusement to[] . . . [r]efuse, \nwithhold from, or deny to any person because of his race, . . . any of [its] accommodations, \nadvantages, facilities or privileges . . . .”3  43 Pa. C.S. § 955(i); accord Fairfield Twp. Volunteer \nFire Co. No. 1 v. Commonwealth, 609 A.2d 804, 805 n.1 (Pa. 1992).  The PHRA expressly sets \nout “[a] right to remedy for discrimination,” Clay v. Advanced Comput. Applications, Inc., 559 \nA.2d 917, 919 (Pa. 1989), providing that “[t]he opportunity . . . to obtain all the \naccommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges of any public accommodation . . . without \ndiscrimination because of race . . . is hereby recognized as and declared to be a civil right which \nshall be enforceable as set forth in this act.”  Id. § 953. \nGenerally, the PHRA preempts other claims aimed at vindicating the rights that it \nprotects.  See, e.g., Weaver v. Harpster, 975 A.2d 555, 509 n.10 (Pa. 2009) (“[T]he legislature \nhas made the PHRA the exclusive state law remedy for unlawful discrimination, preempting the \nadvancement of common law claims for wrongful discharge based on claims of \n \n3 Sesame Place undoubtedly qualifies as a “public accommodation, resort or amusement” as defined in the statute.  \n43 Pa. C.S. § 954(l) (defining the term to include “amusement and recreation parks”). \n \n6 \n \n\ndiscrimination.”); Vincent v. Fuller Co., 616 A.2d 969, 974 (Pa. 1992) (“[P]ersons with claims \nthat are cognizable under the [PHRA] must avail themselves of the administrative process of the \n[PHRC] or be barred from the judicial remedies authorized . . . .”).  Otherwise, “the statutory \nscheme [of the PHRA] would be frustrated if aggrieved [parties] were permitted to circumvent \nthe PHRC by simply filing claims in court.  This would result in the very sort of burdensome, \ninefficient, time consuming, and expensive litigation that the PHRC was designed to avert.”  \nClay, 559 A.2d at 920; accord Bruffett v. Warner Commc’ns, Inc., 692 F.2d 910, 919 (3d Cir. \n1982) (“If a common law action for the same claims were recognized, it would give the claimant \nan opportunity to circumvent the carefully drafted legislative procedures.”).   \nThat preemption, however, is bounded in at least two important respects in line with the \nPHRA’s plain text.  First, nothing in the law’s exclusivity provision “shall be deemed to repeal \nor supersede any of the provisions of any existing or hereafter adopted municipal ordinance, \nmunicipal charter or of any law of this Commonwealth relating to discrimination.”  43 Pa. C.S. \n§ 962(b).  Thus, “an aggrieved party is not mandated to invoke the PHRA’s procedures when \nother laws,” such as a state whistleblower law or constitutional claims, “provide a cognizable \nremedy based on the harm alleged.”  Harrison v. Health Network Lab’ys Ltd. P’ships, 232 A.3d \n674, 683 (Pa. 2020); accord Imboden v. Chowns Commc’ns, 182 F. Supp.2d 453, 458 (E.D. Pa. \n2002) (citing McNasby v. Crown Cork & Seal Co., 888 F.2d 270, 281 (3d Cir. 1989)).   \nSecond, and crucial to this case, even when a common-law claim is asserted, if there is a \n“separate set of facts that support” that claim “outside of the act of discrimination,” it is not \npreempted by the PHRA.  Keck v. Comm. Union Ins. Co., 758 F. Supp. 1034, 1039 (M.D. Pa. \n1991).  In other words, “[i]f . . . the act that would support the common law claim is only an act \nof discrimination, the claim is preempted by and must be adjudicated within the framework of \n7 \n \n\nthe PHRA.”  Id.  If, however, “a common law tort claim and a discrimination claim are brought \nin the same lawsuit, the common law claim will not be preempted by the PHRA if it is factually \nindependent of the discrimination claim.”  Id. at 1038.  This is the case because the exclusivity of \nthe PHRA as a remedy extends only to “acts declared unlawful by section five of th[e] act” that \nare “based on the same grievance of the complainant concerned.”  43 Pa. C.S. § 962(b) \n(emphasis added).   \nTwo cases illustrate the scope of this preemption doctrine.  The first is Schweitzer v. \nRockwell International, 586 A.2d 383 (Pa. Super. 1990).  There, a Rockwell employee who had \nbeen sexually harassed and assaulted by her supervisor sued her employer, alleging it was \ndirectly liable for sex discrimination under the PHRA and vicariously liable for assault and \nintentional infliction of emotional distress (“IIED”) for her supervisor’s conduct.  Id. at 385.  The \ntrial court granted summary judgment to Rockwell in part because the PHRA and the state \nworker’s compensation law were the “exclusive remedies for assault and [IIED].”  Id. at 386.  \nThe Superior Court reversed, id. at 392, noting that the PHRA’s exclusivity provision only \npreempts actions to seek redress for acts that it prohibits, not “independent legal actions based \nupon the underlying acts.”  Id. at 388-89 (“In [Section 962(b)], ‘grievance’ refers to the phrase \n‘acts declared unlawful by section five of this act,’ and can in no way be construed to mean the \n‘underlying acts’ themselves.”).  Moreover, assault and IIED serve different policies than the \nPHRA does, and “preventing Schweitzer from bringing her common law claims in the common \npleas court actually frustrates the purpose of the statute, the prevention and remediation of \ndiscrimination.”  Id. at 389 (citation omitted).  This holding is consistent with the Pennsylvania \nSupreme Court’s opinion in Clay, which held that wrongful discharge claims are preempted by \nthe PHRA, because unlike IIED claims, they plainly fall within the aegis of the PHRA.  Id. at \n8 \n \n\n390 (citing Clay, 559 A.2d at 921); see 43 Pa. C.S. § 955(a).  \nThe second case worth focusing some attention on is Keck, where a former employee \nsued for disability-based discrimination under the PHRA and also alleged breach of contract \n“based on discharge due to [disability], which, Keck urges, is a violation of her employment \ncontract.”  758 F. Supp. at 1035.  The district court dismissed that claim as preempted.  Id. at \n1039.  Canvassing the recent jurisprudence expounding the PHRA’s preemptive scope, including \nClay and Schweitzer, the court concluded Pennsylvania law dictates that “if all or part of the \nfacts that would give rise of a discrimination claim would also independently support a common \nlaw claim, the common law claim is not preempted by the PHRA and need not be adjudicated \nwithin its framework.”  Id.  As an example of when this situation might arise, the Keck court \nhypothesized that, “if an employer effected all the elements of [IIED] upon an employee, and \nchose to do so because the employee was black, the employer may be found liable for \ndiscrimination as well as [IIED].”  Id. at 1038.  In the case before it, the breach of contract claim \nby its own terms nevertheless was based on the plaintiff’s alleged firing on the basis of her \ndisability and could not stand “outside the act of discrimination.”  Id. at 1039.  Schweitzer and \nKeck thus show that, although the PHRA does preempt some common-law claims, it does so \nonly where: (1) the wrongdoing alleged in the common-law claim is covered by the plain text of \nSection 955; and, (2) preemption would be consistent with the policies that the statute’s \nexclusivity and exhaustion provisions are designed to further.4   \n \n4 Cases that have held that the negligent supervision claims before them were preempted, e.g., Eure v. Friends’ \nCent. Sch. Corp., 2019 WL 3573489, at *14 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 5, 2019); Graudins v. Retro Fitness, LLC, 921 F. \nSupp.2d 456, 466 (E.D. Pa. 2013); Randler v. Kountry Kraft Kitchens, 2012 WL 6561510, at *14 (M.D. Pa. Dec. 17, \n2012); Youssef v. Anvil Int’l, 2007 WL 9809236, at *5 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 28, 2007), are consistent with these \nlimitations.  Each of these negligent supervision claims alleged acts of employment discrimination that fell in the \nheartland of the PHRA’s protections.  Section 955(a) of the PHRA makes it “an unlawful discriminatory practice . . . \n[f]or any employer because of the race, color, religious creed, ancestry, age, sex, national origin or non-job related \nhandicap or disability . . . to refuse to hire or employ or contract with, or to bar or to discharge from employment . . . \nor to otherwise discriminate against such individual or independent contractor with respect to compensation, hire, \n9 \n \n\nGiven this distinction, Plaintiffs argue that their negligent supervision claim complies \nwith the limitation articulated in Keck and can stand independent of any claim of racial \ndiscrimination.  They are correct.  Although the negligent supervision claim is connected to the \ndiscrimination they allegedly suffered, the factual allegations underlying this claim are different \nfrom those that would form the basis for a hypothetical public accommodation claim brought \nunder the PHRA, so it is not preempted.   \nThe elements of the two claims call for markedly different factual inquiries.  To review, a \nclaim for negligent supervision requires that Plaintiffs show: (1) SeaWorld “fail[ed] to exercise \nordinary care to prevent” racial discrimination by its employees while they were acting outside \nthe scope of their employment; (2) that discrimination took place at Sesame Place; and, \n(3) SeaWorld “kn[ew] or ha[d] reason to know of the necessity and ability to control” those \nemployees.  Belmont, 708 F.3d at 487-88 (citations omitted).  It is directed at an employer for its \nfailure to uphold its “duty to reasonably monitor and control the activities of an employee” and \nits “duty to abstain from hiring an employee and placing that employee in a situation where the \nemployee will harm a third party.”  Id. at 488 (citing Hutchison ex rel. Hutchison v. Luddy, 742 \nA.2d 1052, 1059-60) (Pa. 1999)).  Negligent supervision claims thus focus on an employer’s \nknowledge of and attempts to control (or lack thereof) an employee’s conduct.  See, e.g., Coath \nv. Jones, 419 A.2d 1249, 1250-51 (Pa. Super. 1980). \nContrast these allegations with what is required to sustain a claim of violation of Section \n955(i).  Under that statute, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) he or she is a member of a protected \n \ntenure, terms, conditions or privileges of employment or contract, if the individual or independent contractor is the \nbest able and most competent to perform the services required.”  43 Pa. C.S. § 955(a).  The negligent supervision \nclaims in these cases alleged employment discrimination covered by this provision.  Eure, 2019 WL 3573489, at *1 \n(wrongful discharge on the basis of race); Graudins, 921 F. Supp.2d at 466 (sexual harassment); Randler, 2012 WL \n6561510, at *4 (sexual harassment,); Youssef, 2007 WL 9809236, at * (discrimination on the basis of national \norigin). \n \n10 \n \n\nclass; (2) the defendant falls under the PHRA’s definition of a public accommodation; and, \n(3) he or she was discriminated against on the basis of membership in that class.  Cook v. Wirtz, \n35 Pa. D. & C.4th 264, 269-73 (Pa. C.P. Allegheny Cnty. 1996).  These elements closely track \nthe elements for liability under Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000a.  See \nKelly v. Drexel Univ., 94 F.3d 102, 105 (3d Cir. 1996) (citations omitted) (“Pennsylvania \ncourts . . . generally interpret the PHRA in accord with its federal counterparts.”).  The elements \nof a Title II claim are: \n(1) [Plaintiff] is a member of a protected class; (2) attempted to exercise the right \nto full benefits and enjoyment of a place of public accommodation; (3) was \ndenied those benefits and enjoyment; and (4) was treated less favorably than \nsimilarly situated persons who are not members of the protected class. \n \nShumate v. Twin Tier Hospitality, LLC, 655 F. Supp.2d 521, 537 (M.D. Pa. 2009) (quoting \nMcCoy v. Homestead Studio Suites Hotels, 390 F. Supp.2d 577, 584-85 (S.D. Tex. 2005)).  \nLiability under both Section 955(i) and Title II keys off the actual discriminatory conduct that a \nplaintiff alleges took place—here, the conduct of SeaWorld’s employees at Sesame Place.  That \nis, in Keck’s parlance, a “separate set of facts” from the negligent supervision claim’s focus on \nthe employer’s careless hiring and management practices.  758 F. Supp. at 1039.   \nHere, Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint reflects this distinction, so the negligent \nsupervision claim in it is not preempted.  Plaintiffs base their claim on allegations that SeaWorld \n“fail[ed] to exercise ordinary care to prevent the intentional harm inflicted upon Plaintiffs by \ntheir authorized agents . . . whose racially discriminatory conduct was committed outside the \nscope of their employment” (ECF No. 123-1 at 24 (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 127)).  SeaWorld \ncommitted this alleged breach by relying on a large number of teenage employees from high \nschools in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where a “culture of racism” was endemic.  Id. at 26 \n(Second Am. Compl. ¶ 130(i)).  SeaWorld subsequently “received written complaints from park \n11 \n \n\npatrons alleging racial discrimination by its employees.”  Id. at 27 (Second Am. Compl. \n¶ 130(n)).  And upon receiving these complaints, SeaWorld “either made no attempt to identify \nthe employees involved” or “never investigated many of the complaints” and “never disciplined \nany employee relating to complaints of racial discrimination.”  Id. at 28 (Second Am. Compl. \n¶ 130(u)).  SeaWorld thus allegedly “negligently supervised their employees [in] creating a park-\nwide environment of race discrimination that violated the civil rights of plaintiffs.”  Id. at 29 \n(Second Am. Compl. ¶ 131).  Because Plaintiffs’ negligent supervision claim is not “the same \ngrievance” as an alleged violation of Section 955(i), 43 Pa. C.S. § 962(b), it is not preempted by \nthe PHRA.  \nb.  Plausibility of Plaintiffs’ Allegations \nOf course, whether the PHRA preempts Plaintiffs’ negligent supervision claim does not \nend the analysis.  SeaWorld also argues that, even if it is not preempted, Plaintiffs’ negligent \nsupervision claim does not state a plausible claim for relief, so amendment would be futile \nregardless.  The Court thus will evaluate the Second Amended Complaint as it would under a \nmotion to dismiss brought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  Shane, 213 F.3d at \n115. \nSeaWorld argues that Plaintiffs do not sufficiently allege that its employees were acting \noutside the scope of their employment nor do they identify specific prior acts of racism by \nspecific SeaWorld employees involved in the incidents alleged such that Seaworld could have \nput it on notice of the risk of harm to Plaintiffs.  Both arguments, do not warrant dismissal of the \nnegligence supervision claim in the Second Amended Complaint. \nUnless the facts are not in dispute, “the scope of a servant’s employment is a fact \nquestion for the jury.”  Ferrell v. Martin, 419 A.2d 175, 180 (Pa. Super. 1980) (citations omitted) \n12 \n \n\nparticularly where, as illustrated in the extensive summary judgment briefing that has already \nbeen filed, whether that is the case here is in sharp dispute.  It simply is too early to conclude that \nSeaWorld’s employees were acting outside the scope of their employment as a matter of law \nwhen they allegedly discriminated against Plaintiffs on the basis of their race.  \nSeaWorld argues that because Plaintiffs do not “allege any prior bad acts or any prior \nmisconduct by any at-issue employee” they have not been put on notice of the individual  \ncharacteristics of the employees who they allegedly negligently supervised: “What was [the \nfellow employee’s] conduct prior to [the harmful intentional act], and was it of such a nature as \nto indicate a propensity for [that harmful act] . . . ?”  Heller v. Patwil Homes, Inc., 713 A.2d 105, \n108 (Pa. Super. 1998); accord Dempsey v. Walso Bureau, Inc., 246 A.2d 418, 422 (Pa. 1968).   \nBut given the nature of Plaintiffs’ claim, their allegations are plausible enough to \nproceed.  The vast majority of the allegations involve employees wearing full-body costumes of \ndifferent Sesame Street characters, so it makes perfect sense that Plaintiffs do not—indeed \ncannot—identify the specific SeaWorld employees involved.  Cf. Lincoln Benefit Life Co. v. AEI \nLife, LLC, 800 F.3d 99, 107 n.31 (3d Cir. 2015) (citations omitted) (“Several Courts of Appeals \naccept allegations ‘on information and belief’ when the facts at issue are peculiarly within the \ndefendant's possession.”).  But as discussed above, the Second Amended Complaint is replete \nwith allegations that SeaWorld was on notice about the alleged racist environment in which \nmany of its employees grew up and that the company had an intimate relationship with that \nenvironment.  Accordingly, the allegations plausibly state that, in light of the longstanding and \nclose relationship between Sesame Place and the community surrounding it, SeaWorld was on \nnotice of the risk that a substantial portion of its employees were likely to engage in intentional \nracial discrimination.  In that the Second Amended Complaint also alleges in detail the specific \n13 \n \n\ninstances of racial discrimination all of which took place at Sesame Place, Plaintiffs have \nplausibly alleged that SeaWorld was negligent in its supervision of its employees at Sesame \nPlace and leave to amend will not be denied on futility grounds.5   \nii.  Undue Delay \nNor has there been undue delay in seeking leave to amend.  “[T]he question of undue \ndelay requires [a court] focus on the movant’s reasons for not amending sooner.”  Cureton v. \nNat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n, 252 F.3d 267, 273 (3d Cir. 2001).  Not all delays, even lengthy \nones, are undue.  Id. (citation omitted) (“The mere passage of time does not require that a motion \nto amend a complaint be denied on grounds of delay.”).  Instead, “[d]elay becomes ‘undue,’ and \nthereby creates grounds for the district court to refuse leave, when it places an unwarranted \nburden on the court or when the plaintiff has had previous opportunities to amend.”  Bjorgung v. \nWhitetail Resort, LP, 550 F.3d 263, 266 (3d Cir. 2008) (citation omitted).  “The question of \nundue delay” also “focus[es] on the plaintiffs’ motives for not amending their complaint to assert \nthis claim earlier.”  Adams v. Gould Inc., 739 F.2d 858, 868 (3d Cir. 1984). \nNo such burden or improper motive is present here.  Although, as SeaWorld puts it, “the \ntheories behind [Plaintiffs’] proposed amendments were or should have been known to them \nsince the start of the case,” that does not mean there has been undue delay.  Delay becomes \nundue when the moving party “become[s] fully apprised of the pertinent details upon which to \n \n5 SeaWorld also argues that, because Plaintiffs’ claim for violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981 requires proof of respondeat \nsuperior liability, Castleberry v. STI Grp., 863 F.3d 259, 263 (3d Cir. 2017) (citation omitted), and that type of \nliability requires proof that its employees were operating within the scope of their employment, e.g., Williams \nv. Cloverland Farms Dairy, Inc., 78 F. Supp.2d 479, 485 (D. Md. 1999), concluding that Plaintiffs have plausibly \nalleged as part of their negligent supervision claim that its employees were operating outside that scope requires \ndismissal of their federal claim.  But, even where two “theories undercut one another . . . a plaintiff may plead in the \nalternative.”  Taylor v. Pathmark Stores, Inc., 177 F.3d 180, 189 (3d Cir. 1997); accord Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(3) (“A \nparty may state as many separate claims or defenses as it has, regardless of consistency.”).  Although Plaintiffs “may \nnot ultimately recover on both” their negligent supervision and Section 1981 claims, they “may plead” both.  Alpha \nPro Tech, Inc. v. VWR Int’l LLC, 984 F. Supp.2d 425, 446 (E.D. Pa. 2013) (citation omitted). \n14 \n \n\nbase its claims.”  The Pep Boys—Manny, Moe & Jack v. Safeco Corp., 2005 WL 3120265, at *2 \n(E.D. Pa. Nov. 21, 2005).  As discussed in the context of the good cause inquiry, that was not \nuntil late last year, and Plaintiffs filed their Motion barely a month after the last relevant \ndeposition was taken.  The cases that SeaWorld cites where undue delay was found because “the \nbasis of the proposed second amended complaint . . . has been known to Plaintiff for months” \nthus are inapposite, MRO Corp. v. Humana, Inc., 2017 WL 3675387, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 23, \n2017), and “the interests in judicial economy and finality of litigation” do not counsel against \ngranting leave to amend.  Cureton, 252 F.3d at 273 (citation omitted).   \niii.  Prejudice \nFinally, SeaWorld has not shown that it would be prejudiced by granting leave to amend.  \n“[P]rejudice to the non-moving party is the touchstone for the denial of an amendment.”  Cornell \n& Co. v. Occupational Safety Health Rev. Comm’n, 573 F.2d 820, 823 (3d Cir. 1978) (citations \nomitted).  Prejudice can take the form of “additional discovery, cost, and preparation to defend \nagainst new facts or new theories.”  Cureton, 252 F.3d at 273 (citations omitted).   \nThe company argues that Plaintiffs’ Motion amounts to a “shift [in] the entire theory of \ntheir case” that will require reopening discovery, further rounds of briefing, and a delay in trial.  \nThat is not so.  There is no need for additional discovery: in that the evidence which underpins \nthe negligent supervision claim apart from being internal to Defendants was also adduced during \nfulsome discovery.  Further, the Court has tested the viability of the negligent supervision claim \nin this opinion already, so there is no need for additional briefing on a motion to dismiss.  \nHowever, Defendants will be permitted to file supplemental briefing on their Motion for \nSummary Judgment addressing the negligent supervision claim.   \nThere is, however, one carveout to this grant of Plaintiffs’ request for leave to amend: In \n15 \n \n\ntheir Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs add allegations that SeaWorld received complaints \nof racial discrimination across “all aspects of the park, including swimming pools, park water \nrides, park amusement rides, park parades, park staff assistance, and park food concession lines” \n(ECF No. 123-1 at 27).  SeaWorld points out that it would need discovery to ascertain “which \nemployees were involved” in these instances of alleged racial discrimination “and what their \nintentions and the circumstances were.”  These allegations no doubt arise from information that \nPlaintiffs uncovered during discovery, but they are categorically different from the allegations in \nthe First Amended Complaint, which focused on interactions between the Plaintiffs’ children and \nSeaWorld employees performing as Sesame Street characters.  As such, significantly more \ndiscovery would be required to develop the contours of these new categories of alleged \ndiscrimination. \nPlaintiffs’ allegations of discrimination beyond their interactions with costumed \ncharacters are analogous to those analyzed in Berger v. Edgewater Steel Company, 911 F.2d 911 \n(3d Cir. 1990).  There, a group of employee plaintiffs lost two retirement benefits and sued, \nalleging violations of, inter alia, ERISA.  Id. at 914.  During discovery, the plaintiffs learned that \none of the defendant’s officers was granted one of the same retirement benefits that they had \nbeen denied.  Id. at 924.  The Third Circuit upheld the district court’s decision to deny leave to \namend because “new and extensive discovery . . . would have been necessary in order to develop \nthe [plaintiffs’] theory of discrimination in favor of the highly compensated employees.”  Id.  \nLeave to amend would have morphed the plaintiffs’ claim into a “new and substantially \nbroader” one.  Id. (emphasis added).  In the same way, supporting Plaintiffs’ negligent \ndiscrimination claim here with allegations of discrimination outside of interactions with \ncostumed characters would turn it into a substantially broader claim, necessitating additional \n16 \n \n\ndiscovery, so those the motion to amend will be denied with respect to these allegations in the \nSecond Amended Complaint.  Having trimmed the scope of Plaintiffs’ Second Amended \nComplaint, there will be no prejudice to SeaWorld in allowing the rest of it to proceed.  See Dole \nv. Arco Chem. Co., 921 F.2d 484, 488 (3d Cir. 1990) (noting that “[t]he mere fact that a \nsummary judgment motion will need to be revised does not, without more, establish that \nprejudice will result from permitting the plaintiff to amend”). \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the forgoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Leave to Amend will be granted in part \nand denied in part.   \nAn appropriate order follows. \nBY THE COURT: \n                           \n              /s/ Wendy Beetlestone \n              _______________________________             \n              WENDY BEETLESTONE, J. \n17 \n ",

Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), 23(c)(4).1  For multiple reasons, \ncertifying a class action is not appropriate here, and Plaintiffs’ motion will be denied. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nSesame Place offers a number of attractions to visitors, among them amusement park \nrides, pools, restaurants, parades, and meet-and-greets.  The latter two attractions allow visitors \nopportunities to interact with costumed performers portraying characters from the Sesame Street \n \n1 Despite requesting in their Complaint “compensatory, actual, punitive, and statutory damages, including interest, in \nexcess of $50,000,000[]”, Plaintiffs’ class certification motion proceeds under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23(b)(2) which entitles them only to damages that are “incidental to the injunctive or declaratory relief.”  Wal-Mart \nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 360 (2011); see also In re Sch. Asbestos Litig., 789 F.2d 996, 1008 (3d Cir. \n1986). \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 2 of 27\ntelevision program such as Elmo, Big Bird, Grover, Telly Monster, Abby Cadabby, and Rosita.  \nPlaintiffs allege that the Sesame Place employees portraying these characters declined to interact \nwith their children and instead interacted with similarly situated White children.  Some of these \nincidents were recorded and received significant public attention.  The interactions with these \ncostumed characters, however, were not the only instances of alleged racial discrimination.  For \nexample, one class member’s child allegedly was not allowed to use a ride alone despite meeting \nits height requirements, while White children who did not meet the height requirements were \nallowed to.  Another family alleges that they had to wait to receive their food at a park restaurant \nfor much longer than White families did.  \nThese allegations of racial discrimination implicate multiple departments at Sesame \nPlace: for example, the Operations Department runs the park’s rides; the Culinary Department \nmanages the food and beverage options.  Most of Plaintiffs’ allegations, however, focus on \nemployees of the Entertainment Department, which runs the parades and meet-and-greets.  The \nrecord indicates that the department’s employees were vested with a significant amount of \ndiscretion in how they carried out their duties in the parades.  As an Entertainment Department \nmanager put it, costumed character employees were “instructed . . . to spread as much love as \npossible” and “try to touch as many people as [they] can.”  That said, he agreed that these \nperformers had “wide discretion” in how they went about that.  SeaWorld company policy \nprohibits discrimination on the basis of race, and the leader of entertainment operations at \nSesame Place testified that their human resources orientation instructed that the policy applied to \n“[a]nyone you come into contact with.”  That training included some discussion of \ndiscrimination and harassment. \nAt the outset, Plaintiffs’ lawsuit alleged violations of 42 U.S.C § 1981 and several forms \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 3 of 27\nof negligence under Pennsylvania law.  Following SeaWorld’s motion to dismiss, only the \nSection 1981 claim and Plaintiffs’ claim for negligence per se remained.  Burns v. SeaWorld \nParks & Ent., Inc., 675 F. Supp.3d 532, 551 (E.D. Pa. 2023).  Following briefing on this Motion \nfor Class Certification, however, Plaintiffs moved for leave to amend to resurrect their claim for \nnegligent supervision, the motion for which the Court granted.  Burns v. SeaWorld Parks & Ent., \nInc., 2024 WL 1016363, at *8 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 8, 2024).   \nPlaintiffs’ theory of liability is based in large part on how Sesame Place is staffed:  Many \nof the Entertainment Department’s employees are students at high schools in Bucks County, \nPennsylvania, where the park is located.2  Those high schools, Plaintiffs submit, suffer from an \nendemic culture of racism.  Plaintiffs maintain that, owing to Sesame Place’s close working \nrelationship with these schools and the surrounding area, it either knew or should have known \nabout the extent of racism in this community.  Indeed, SeaWorld received complaints about \nracial discrimination at Sesame Place.  Nevertheless, say Plaintiffs, the park continued to hire \nfrom these schools and failed to implement any training on racism, implicit bias, or other similar \nconcepts that could have alleviated the risk that their employees would discriminate against \nBlack and Hispanic guests.  Plaintiffs contend that, having not received any training to address \nthe biases that these employees had brought to work with them, they intentionally discriminated \nagainst those guests: When working as costumed characters, for example, they exercised their \ndiscretion in a racist manner.  Thus, according to Plaintiffs, SeaWorld was deliberately \n \n2 The record before the Court is rather thin when it comes to SeaWorld’s hiring practices.  The Vice President of \nHuman Relations at Sesame Place Philadelphia, who was involved in recruiting, used local high schools and \ncolleges as a “starting point” for outreach, and also advertised for positions via social media.  She agreed with \nstatements from other witnesses that employees of the Entertainment Department in particular were recruited from \nlocal high schools, but she did not testify with any specificity about recruiting practices in other departments such as \nOperations or Guest Relations.  Outreach to high schools would take place via either in-person recruiting sessions or \nby distributing flyers for the schools to put up themselves.  \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 4 of 27\nindifferent to and is liable for racial discrimination at Sesame Place under state and federal law. \nThe proposed class is represented by several families who allegedly faced racial \ndiscrimination when they visited Sesame Place (together, the “Named Plaintiffs”).  They are: \n1.  Quinton Burns and K.B.: Burns and his daughter visited Sesame Place from \nBaltimore, Maryland with two-day tickets in June 2022.  Burns testified that, \nduring a parade, Sesame Place employees dressed in costume ignored his \ndaughter, who is Black, but interacted with similarly situated White children.  \nMoreover, at a meet-and-greet, Burns was told that the line to interact with a \ncostumed character was closed, but, as he departed the line, he observed another \nWhite family still in line for the event. \n \n2.  Nathan Fleming and O.F.: Fleming and his family, including his daughter, visited \nSesame Place from York, Pennsylvania with single-day tickets in July 2022.  He \ntestified that, during a parade, a Sesame Place employee dressed as the character \nTelly Monster ignored his daughter, who is Black, but interacted with a similarly \nsituated Asian child.  Other parade performers did not interact with O.F. either. \n \n3.  Lashonda Miles and M.C.: Miles, who is from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, \nreceived tickets to Sesame Place from her cousin, who worked for SeaWorld at \nthe time.  She and her family visited the park in June 2022.  She testified that, \nduring a parade, a Sesame Place employee dressed as the character Rosita shooed \naway her son, who is Black, and hugged a nearby White girl. \n \n4.  Ingrid Morales and N.M.: The Morales family purchased single-day tickets to \nSesame Place and visited the park from Philadelphia in July 2022.  Ingrid Morales \ntestified that she and her daughter, who identify as Afro-Latina, attended a parade, \nwhere park employees dressed as the characters Big Bird, Grover, and Baby Bear \nignored them while high-fiving other nearby White children.  \n \n5.  Yoselis Romero and E.C.: The Romero family purchased single-day tickets to \nvisit Sesame Place in June 2022.  Yoselis Romero testified that, during a parade, \npark employees yelled at her child for being past the point where audience \nmembers were allowed to stand.  On top of that, she testified that her daughter did \nnot receive the same interactions from park employees dressed as the characters \nZoe and Cookie Monster that nearby White children did. \n \n6.  Katie Valdez and M.L.: Valdez visited Sesame Place on a season pass in \nDecember 2021.  She testified that, during a parade, her son, who is Hispanic, was \nignored by a Sesame Place character dressed as Abby Cadabby, who nonetheless \ninteracted with similarly situated White children, including a boy right next to \nthem. \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 5 of 27\n7.  Ashley Valette and D.V.: Valette and her family visited Sesame Place from West \nHampton, New York in June 2022 using “Sunny Day” tickets, which the park \ngives out to visitors who purchased tickets for days with inclement weather.  They \nattended a parade, where she testified that a Sesame Place employee dressed as \nthe character Grover initially moved towards her daughter, who is Black, but \nultimately ignored her and interacted with White children next to them instead. \n \n8.  Lauren Willie and L.W.: The Willie family visited Sesame Place from Brooklyn, \nNew York in July 2022 using season passes that they had purchased the previous \nmonth.  Willie testified that her daughter, who is Black, was ignored by a Sesame \nPlace employee dressed as the character Rosita and another park employee, who \ninstead took a picture with a White child.  Undeterred, Willie took her daughter to \nget a picture taken with Rosita at a subsequent meet-and-greet.  The same park \nemployee who had been escorting Rosita earlier ended the meet-and-greet when \nthe Willie family had gotten to the front of the line, allowing the White family in \nfront of them to take a picture, but not them.  On top of that, Willie alleges that, \nwhen her family went to get food, her order took significantly longer to arrive \nthan White families’ did.  \n \nThe contours of the class at issue have changed in important respects over the course of \nthis litigation.  In their original complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that they represented a class of: \nAll minority persons who since July 27, 2018 entered [into] contracts with \nSeaWorld for admission into Sesame Place who suffered disparate treatment from \nSeaWorld and/or its agents and/or employees by ignoring minority children while \nopenly interacting with similarly situated white children. \n \nThe class that they now claim to represent, as slightly amended in their reply brief, is both \nnarrower in some respects—in that certain racial minorities no longer are included—and far \nbroader in others—in that it is no longer defined with reference to racial discrimination: \nAll African-American or Hispanic persons who, since July 27, 2018, either \ndirectly or as third-party beneficiaries, entered into contracts with SeaWorld by \npurchasing admission tickets into Sesame Place Philadelphia. \n \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(4), Plaintiffs seek certification of this class to \nresolve “[w]hether SeaWorld intentionally refused to identify and address overt and/or implicit \nbiases in its park employees, between 2018 and 2022, to ensure said biases would not be acted \nout upon the minority guests of the amusement park.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4).  And as remedies \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 6 of 27\nfor the discrimination that they allege, Plaintiffs request a court order that SeaWorld: \n1.  Employ an Injunctive Relief Manager who will review, revise, and post \nantidiscrimination policies on bulletin boards throughout the workspaces of Sea World’s \nemployees. \n \n2.  Maintain a confidential, toll-free employee hotline number for reporting concerns about \nracial discrimination, harassment, or retaliation that occurs at Sesame Place Philadelphia. \n \n3.  Require Sea World to provide continuing mandatory anti-discrimination and race equity \ntraining for all employees, which is to be monitored by the Injunctive Relief Manager or \nthird-party entity experienced in conducting such trainings such as Race Forward and/or \nThe National Conference for Community and Justice.  This course of training must be \nstrategically customized to provide instruction on the history of race discrimination, the \neffect of systems of oppression and privilege in the United States, racial justice values, \ntools for combating structural racism in the workplace, and recognition of racial biases \nand racial equity. This course of training must also include practical application and \nconcrete action items for Sea World employees to practice applying the race equity and \nnon-discrimination concepts to their work duties. \n \n4.  Require the Injunctive Relief Manager to submit quarterly reports for a period of five \nyears to the Court relating to Sea World’s compliance with the Court’s Judgment for \nInjunctive Relief. \n \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nA class action is “an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on \nbehalf of the individual named parties only.”  In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d \n305, 309 n.6 (3d Cir. 2008), as amended (Jan. 16, 2009) (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, \n457 U.S. 147, 155 (1982)) (“In re Hydrogen Peroxide”).  For a class to be certified, the Court \nmust be “‘satisfied, after a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of Rule 23 are met.’”  Id. at \n309 (quoting Falcon, 457 U.S. at 161).  Here, Plaintiffs seek to certify an issue class action, \nwhereby class-wide litigation is “maintained . . . with respect to particular issues.”  Fed R. Civ. \nP. 23(c)(4).  In the context of a such an action, the Court thus must answer three questions: \n“First, does the proposed issue class satisfy Rule 23(a)’s requirements?  Second, does the \nproposed issue class fit within one of Rule 23(b)’s categories?  Third, if the proposed issue class \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 7 of 27\ndoes both those things, is it ‘appropriate’ to certify these issues as a class?”  Russell v. Educ. \nComm’n for Foreign Med. Graduates, 15 F.4th 259, 270 (3d Cir. 2021), cert. denied, 142 S. Ct. \n2706 (2022) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4)).  Rule 23(a) has four prerequisites: (1) the class \nmust be “so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable” (numerosity); (2) there must \nbe “questions of law or fact common to the class” (commonality); (3) the named plaintiffs’ \nclaims and defenses must be “typical of the claims or defenses of the class” (typicality); and, \n(4) “the representative parties [must] fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class” \n(adequacy).  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  And, here, the class can be certified only if SeaWorld “has \nacted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief \nor corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Id. 23(b)(2).  \nTherefore, the class must be sufficiently cohesive, and certification is improper where \n“adjudication of the case will . . . devolve into consideration of myriad individual issues.”  2 \nNewberg and Rubenstein on Class Actions § 4.34; see Barnes v. Am. Tobacco Co., 161 F.3d 127, \n143 (3d Cir. 1998). \n  “Rule 23 does not set forth a mere pleading standard.”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, \n564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011).  The moving party must “‘prove that there are in fact sufficiently \nnumerous parties, common questions of law or fact,’ typicality of claims or defenses, and \nadequacy of representation, as required by Rule 23(a),” and “satisfy through evidentiary proof at \nleast one of the provisions of Rule 23(b).”  Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U.S. 27, 33 (2013) \n(quoting Dukes, 564 U.S. at 351).  And, it must do so by a preponderance of the evidence.  \nRussell, 15 F.4th at 265 (citations omitted).  Analyzing a motion for class certification thus “calls \nfor findings by the court, not merely a ‘threshold showing’ by a party, that each requirement of \nRule 23 is met.”  In re Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 307.  “[T]he district court must make \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 8 of 27\nwhatever factual and legal inquiries are necessary and must consider all relevant evidence and \narguments presented by the parties . . . even if they overlap with the merits . . . .”  Id. (citations \nomitted). \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nPlaintiffs have not carried their burden of proving numerosity under Rule 23(a)(2), \ncohesiveness under Rule 23(b)(2), or that their proposed issue is appropriate for certification \nunder Rule 23(c)(4), so their motion will be denied. \nA.  Certification Under Rule 23(a) \ni.  Numerosity  \nTo be certified, a class must be “so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  A putative class that has more than forty members \ngenerally clears this bar.  Mielo v. Steak ‘n Shake Ops., Inc., 897 F.3d 467, 486 (3d Cir. 2018) \n(citation omitted).  Like the rest of the requirements in Rule 23(a), “a court must be presented \nwith evidence that would enable the court to” determine that it is more likely than not that the \nclass is large enough.  Id. at 484 (emphasis added).  “Mere speculation as to the number of class \nmembers—even if such speculation is ‘a bet worth making’—cannot support a finding of \nnumerosity.”  Hayes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 725 F.3d 349, 357 (3d Cir. 2013) (quoting Marcus \nv. BMW of N. Am., LLC, 687 F.3d 583, 596 (3d Cir. 2012)).  Put “more generally, where a \nputative class is some subset of a larger pool, the trial court may not infer numerosity from the \nnumber in the larger pool alone.”  Id. at 358. \nThus, parties cannot satisfy numerosity by their say-so alone.  In one case in this district, \nthe plaintiffs sought to certify a class consisting of all Black people who, within the limitations \nperiod, had “been terminated or . . . been denied employment . . . as a driver for SEPTA and/or \nany company that has provided paratransit services for Defendant SEPTA as a result of a past \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 9 of 27\nfelony or misdemeanor conviction.”  Jackson v. Se. Pa. Transp. Auth., 260 F.R.D. 168, 184 (E.D. \nPa. 2009).  As a matter of simple probabilities, no doubt more than forty people fit the bill.  But, \n“[d]espite the existence of SEPTA’s on-line application system, and despite the fact that Plaintiff \nhas had ample opportunity to conduct class discovery” the court had not received “any informed \nestimate of how many people applied for or were terminated from bus or paratransit operators \nduring the relevant time period.”  Id. at 187. \nA similar proof problem is found here.  To support numerosity in this case, Plaintiffs \nsubmit in their certification briefing that “there are currently approximately 100 class member \nfamilies involving over 130 children,” but they do not cite record evidence to support that \nassertion.  Instead, they rely on an allegation from their operative Complaint and testimony that \ndoes not sufficiently support that statement.  This mere “representation,” as Plaintiffs describe it \nin their reply brief, does not in itself carry any evidentiary weight.  See Mielo, 897 F.3d at 484; \nUnited States ex rel. Bradshaw v. Alldredge, 432 F.2d 1248, 1248 n.1 (3d Cir. 1970) (“We have \nrepeatedly held that statements by counsel in briefs or in court are not evidence.”).  Plaintiffs’ \nallegation in their operative Complaint that, “[w]ith over 1 million guests visiting Sesame Place \nPhiladelphia each year,” there are sure to be enough class members to satisfy Rule 23(a)(1) is \nexactly the sort of speculation that does not “support a finding of numerosity.”  Hayes, 725 F.3d \nat 357 (quotation omitted).  The Third Circuit rejected a similar statistical argument in Mielo: it \ndid not follow from the fact that there are between 14.9 million and 20.9 million people with \ndisabilities in the United States “that at least 40 of those individuals would have experienced \naccess violations at one of the Steak ‘n Shake locations at issue” there.  897 F.3d at 486.  Finally, \nbecause the proposed class is no longer defined with reference to instances of racial \ndiscrimination, Plaintiffs’ citations to testimony about complaints of such discrimination that \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 10 of 27\nSesame Place received do not assist the numerosity inquiry.  Thus, Plaintiffs have not carried \ntheir burden of showing that the putative class is so numerous that joinder would be impractical. \n“Were this the only defect in Plaintiff[s’] Motion for Class Certification, the Court would \nbe likely to deny it without prejudice to allow Plaintiff[s] to provide some sort of estimate or \nviable claim of numerosity.”  Jackson, 260 F.R.D. at 188 (citing Bennett v. Corr. Med. Servs., \n2008 WL 2064202, at *12 n.16 (D.N.J. May 14, 2008)).  Because Plaintiffs’ Motion falls short in \nadditional respects, however, the Court declines to do so.  See id. \nii. Commonality \nFor any class to be certified, there must be “questions of law or fact common to the \nclass.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  This means that the party seeking certification must show “that \nthe class members have suffered the same injury . . . not . . . merely that they have all suffered a \nviolation of the same provision of law.”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 349-50 (internal quotation marks \nand citation omitted).  Class members’ “claims must depend upon a common contention . . . \nthat . . . is capable of classwide resolution—which means that determination of its truth or falsity \nwill resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  Id. at \n350.  Thus, what matters for this commonality inquiry is “the capacity of a class-wide \nproceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.”  Id. \n(quotation omitted).  The inquiry focuses on the defendant’s conduct, not that of the individual \nputative class members.  In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., 391 F.3d 516, 528 (3d Cir. \n2004) (“In re Warfarin”).  The commonality requirement “is easy enough” to satisfy, and it can \nbe met even when some class members have not been injured, have somewhat different claims, \nor have “claims [that] were arguably not even viable”  In re Nat’l Football League Players \nConcussion Inj. Litig., 821 F.3d 410, 427 (3d Cir. 2016) (“In re NFL”) (quoting In re Cmty. Bank \nof N. Va. Mortg. Lending Pracs. Litig., 795 F.3d 380, 397 (3d Cir. 2015) (“In re Cmty. Bank”)). \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 11 of 27\nPlaintiffs have identified a plethora of putative common questions of law or fact, \nincluding “whether Defendants knew of the systemic racism that exists in Bucks County, \nPennsylvania, particularly in its high schools where many of their park employees were \nenrolled,” and “whether, despite this knowledge, Defendants hired teenagers from this racist \nculture and gave them wide discretion on how to interact with guests of Defendants’ Sesame \nPlace Philadelphia theme park,” both of which are embodied in their proposed issue.  In \nresponse, SeaWorld argues that these questions do not fit the bill because Plaintiffs’ allegations \nbear a striking resemblance to those deemed insufficient in Dukes, the Supreme Court’s seminal \nexposition of the commonality requirement.  In that SeaWorld relies heavily on Dukes, it bears \nreviewing in some depth.   \nIn Dukes, a putative nationwide class of current and former Wal-Mart employees alleged \nthat the company had discriminated against them in pay and promotion decisions based on their \ngender in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  564 U.S. at 342.  At Wal-Mart, \nthese decisions were “generally committed to local managers’ broad discretion, which is \nexercised in a largely subjective manner.”  Id. at 343 (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted).  The plaintiffs argued that, because the company was aware “that their local managers’ \ndiscretion over pay and promotions is exercised disproportionately in favor of men, leading to an \nunlawful disparate impact on female employees,” its “refusal to cabin its managers’ authority \namounts to disparate treatment” in violation of the law.  Id. at 344-45. \nThe Supreme Court held that this class could not satisfy the commonality requirement.  \nThe plaintiffs had to deliver “[s]ignificant proof that Wal-Mart operated under a general policy \nof discrimination.”  Id. at 353 (quotation omitted).  That proof was lacking in part because a \n“‘policy’ of allowing discretion by local supervisors over employment matters . . . is just the \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 12 of 27\nopposite of a uniform employment practice that would provide the commonality needed for a \nclass action; it is a policy against having uniform employment practices.”  Id. at 355.  And \nbecause the plaintiffs “ha[d] not identified a common mode of exercising discretion that \npervades the entire company,” Rule 23(a)(2) had not been satisfied.  Id. at 356.  “Other than the \nbare existence of delegated discretion, [the plaintiffs had] identified no ‘specific employment \npractice’—much less one that ties all their 1.5 million claims together.  Merely showing that \nWal-Mart’s policy of discretion has produced an overall sex-based disparity does not suffice.”  \nId. at 357.  To satisfy the commonality requirement, the discretion exercised must have acted \nupon the class in a common manner.  See, e.g., Scott v. Family Dollar Stores, Inc., 733 F.3d 105, \n113 (4th Cir. 2013). \nDukes therefore would foreclose certification of a class in this case pressing violations of \nSection 1981 alone.  The statute “offers relief . . . when racial discrimination impairs an existing \ncontractual relationship, so long as the plaintiff has or would have rights under the existing or \nproposed contractual relationship.”  Domino’s Pizza, Inc. v. McDonald, 546 U.S. 470, 476 \n(2006).  Plaintiffs’ theory of liability under Section 1981 is, in essence, that their contractual \nrights were “impair[ed],” id., via the myriad unique ways in which costumed characters \nexercised their “wide discretion when interacting with minorities.”  Because here, as in Dukes, \nSeaWorld has a policy against racial discrimination, which the record indicates applies both to \nemployees’ interactions with one another and with park guests, there is no “glue holding the \nalleged reasons for all those decisions” by Sesame Place employees “together.”  Dukes, 564 U.S. \nat 352.  Because Dukes requires there be a common question the “truth or falsity” of which “will \nresolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke,” id. at 350, \ncertifying a class to address SeaWorld’s potential violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981 would be \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 13 of 27\ninconsistent with Rule 23(a)(2). \nBut Plaintiffs press a negligent supervision claim as well, and they seek to certify their \nclass to resolve a narrow issue that relates to that claim.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4).  Unlike their \nSection 1981 claim, Plaintiffs’ negligent supervision claim does not depend solely on the ways in \nwhich Sesame Place employees exercised their discretion in interacting with Plaintiffs.  Instead, \nit is predicated on systemic failures by Sesame Place’s management in hiring, monitoring, and \ntraining, and Dukes therefore is inapposite.  To prevail on a negligent supervision claim, \nPlaintiffs must show that, inter alia, SeaWorld “kn[ew] or ha[d] reason to know of the necessity \nand ability to control [its] employee[s].”  Belmont v. MB Inv. Partners, Inc., 708 F.3d 470, 488 \n(3d Cir. 2013) (citations omitted).  Whether Plaintiffs can make that showing depends on \nmultiple questions of fact common to the class, such as: (1) the extent to which SeaWorld was \naware of alleged pervasive racial discrimination in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, high schools \ngiven its close relationship with those schools; and, (2) what—if any—standard pre-hiring \ninvestigation into the park’s new hires took place, especially whether they had been involved in \nany incidents involving racial bias.  To be sure, the alleged incidents of racial discrimination that \nled to this lawsuit are a product of how Sesame Place employees exercised delegated discretion, \nand how those employees did so would not be “capable of classwide resolution.”  Dukes, 564 \nU.S. at 350.  But Plaintiffs’ proposed issue class action aims far higher up the corporate ladder, \naccusing SeaWorld of being, at best, willfully blind to the environment from which the park’s \njunior employees were being hired.  The truth or falsity of Plaintiffs’ allegations on this score is \nthe same for every member of the putative issue class. \nAlthough Plaintiffs’ Section 1981 claim no doubt implicates the Supreme Court’s \nconcerns in Dukes regarding the certification of a class whose members were discriminated \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 14 of 27\nagainst in infinitely unique ways, “[f]or purposes of Rule 23(a)(2), even a single common \nquestion will do.”  Marcus, 687 F.3d at 597 (quoting Dukes, 564 U.S. at 359).  Unlike their \nstatutory claim, Plaintiffs’ negligent supervision claim avoids the commonality pitfalls that many \nclasses run into when they allege discrimination by lower-level employees exercising delegated \ndiscretion by focusing instead on what Sesame Place’s leaders knew about those employees.  \nTherefore, with respect to their negligent supervision claim only, Plaintiffs’ proposed class \nsatisfies the commonality requirement. \niii. Typicality \nPlaintiffs have satisfied the requirement that “the claims or defenses of the representative \nparties” be “typical of the claims or defenses of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). \nThe typicality inquiry ensures that “the incentives of the plaintiffs are aligned with those \nof the class.”  Baby Neal ex rel. Kanter v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 55 (3d Cir. 1994).  Thus, a court \nmust “consider the attributes of the plaintiff[s], the class as a whole and the similarity between \nthe plaintiff[s] and the class.”  Marcus, 687 F.3d at 598 (citing In re Schering Plough Corp. \nERISA Litig., 589 F.3d 585, 597 (3d Cir. 2009)).  “This investigation properly focuses on the \nsimilarity of the legal theory and legal claims; the similarity of the individual circumstances on \nwhich those theories and claims are based; and the extent to which the proposed representative \nmay face significant unique or atypical defenses to her claims.”  In re Schering Plough Corp., \n598 F.3d at 597-98.  When a party seeks to certify a class only to resolve certain issues, as \nPlaintiffs do here, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4), the comparison must be conducted “as to the issue \nproposed for aggregate litigation,” not the entire class action.  2 Newberg and Rubenstein on \nClass Actions § 4:92; see Russell, 15 F.4th at 270.  Typicality is assessed “in common-sense \nterms,” In re Schering Plough Corp., 598 F.3d at 598 (quoting Beck v.

Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner \n& Smith, Inc., 259 F.3d 154, 183-84 (3d Cir. 2001) (citations omitted). \nSeaWorld attacks the Named Plaintiffs’ compliance with Rule 23(a)(3) by pointing out \nthat some of them might not have formed a contract with Sesame Place, in which case they \nwould not be class members, rendering them atypical.  See Hayes, 725 F.3d at 360 (citing Bailey \nv. Patterson, 369 U.S. 31, 32-33 (1962)) (“It is axiomatic that the lead plaintiff must fit the class \ndefinition.”).  First, the Valdez family entered Sesame Place via season passes (as opposed to \nsingle- or multi-day tickets) that, SeaWorld argues, included class action waivers that bar their \nparticipation in this suit.  The company brought this issue up at the motion to dismiss stage, and \nwhile it was premature at that point to dismiss them from the case on this ground, Burns, 675 F. \nSupp.3d at 550-51, at the class certification stage, the waiver poses a typicality problem in that it \nis a defense to the family’s membership in the proposed class.  Second, Lashonda Miles poses a \nseparate contract-based typicality and adequacy issue, as SeaWorld argues her receipt of her \ntickets as a gift from a Sesame Place employee means she never, in the proposed class \ndefinition’s parlance, “entered into [a] contract[] with SeaWorld by purchasing” a ticket to the \npark.  Thus, Miles, too, might not be a class member.  At the very least, whether, as Plaintiffs \nargue, Miles was a third-party beneficiary of the contract and thus herself is a class member \npresents a separate defense from much of the proposed class that makes her, like Valdez, \natypical.  In re Schering Plough Corp., 589 F.3d at 598.   \nBut this does not defeat compliance with Rule 23(a)(3) where, as here, “the remaining \nnamed plaintiffs have adequately shown typicality.”  In re Bank of Am. Home Affordable \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 16 of 27\nModification Program (HAMP) Contract Litig., 2013 WL 4759649, at *8 (D. Mass. Sept. 4, \n2013); see also Houser v. Pritzker, 28 F. Supp.3d 222, 245-47 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (concluding that, \nwhile the portion of a class action alleging racial discrimination against Latinos could not satisfy \ntypicality because no Latino class representative had standing, the African-American class \nrepresentatives were typical of the group they purported to represent); Valenzuela v. Ducey, 329 \nF. Supp.3d 982, 990 n.1 (D. Ariz. 2018).  That is the case because the rest of the Named \nPlaintiffs present no contract-based defenses to class membership,3 and the issue class action that \nthey press is: (1) predicated on nearly identical legal theories, Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 58; and, \n(2) focused on SeaWorld’s conduct alone, Newton, 259 F.3d at 183-84.  Although Plaintiffs \npurport to represent a class including many individuals who never entered Sesame Place, let \nalone were discriminated against there, that poses no bar to certification where, as here, the \ntypicality analysis is conduct with reference to Plaintiffs’ proposed issue, Russell, 15 F.4th at \n270, and that issue only seeks to determine what SeaWorld as an institution did (and did not do) \nin response to those alleged incidents.  Thus, with respect to their proposed issue class action, \nPlaintiffs are typical of the class they wish to represent.  \niv. Adequacy \nTo grant a class certification motion, the class’s representatives must be able to “fairly \nand adequately protect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  Like typicality, the \n“primary purpose” of the adequacy inquiry “is ‘to determine whether the named plaintiffs have \nthe ability and the incentive to vigorously represent the claims of the class.’”  Duncan v. \nGovernor of V.I., 48 F.4th 195, 209 (3d Cir. 2022) (quoting In re Cmty. Bank, 795 F.3d at 393).  \n \n3 SeaWorld also cites testimony from Nathan Fleming that he “can’t speak for all minorities” and could only \nrepresent Hispanic class members to the extent that they also identified as Black to suggest that he is atypical, too.  \nAssuming arguendo that Fleming’s statements pose a typicality problem, it is extinguished by the presence of other \nAfrican-American and Latino class representatives.  Cf. Houser, 28 F. Supp.3d at 245-47. \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 17 of 27\nIt thus “serves to uncover conflicts of interest between named parties and the class they seek to \nrepresent,” Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 625 (1997), ensuring “the alignment \nof interests and incentives between the representative plaintiffs and the rest of the class,” Dewey \nv. Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, 681 F.3d 170, 183 (3d Cir. 2012) (citations omitted).   \nOn top of this requirement, “the adequacy inquiry tests the qualifications of the counsel \nto represent the class.”  In re Warfarin, 391 F.3d at 532.  “Although questions concerning the \nadequacy of class counsel were traditionally analyzed under the aegis of the adequate \nrepresentation requirement of Rule 23(a)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, those \nquestions have, since 2003, been governed by Rule 23(g).”  Sheinberg v. Sorensen, 606 F.3d \n130, 132 (3d Cir. 2010).  That rule instructs that a court “must consider:” \n(i)  the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential claims in \nthe action; \n(ii) counsel’s experience in handling class actions, other complex litigation, and \nthe types of claims asserted in the action; \n(iii)counsel’s knowledge of the applicable law; and \n(iv) the resources that counsel will commit to representing the class. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(A).  A court also “may consider any other matter pertinent to counsel’s \nability to fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class.”  Id. 23(g)(1)(B).   \nFor essentially the same reasons as discussed above, those Named Plaintiffs who are not \nsubject to defenses to their class membership and who are typical of the class they purport, can \nadequately represent the class with respect to the narrow issue that they seek to resolve on a \nclass-wide basis.  See In re Domestic Drywall Antitrust Litig., 322 F.R.D. 188, 198 (E.D. Pa. \n2017) (citing Amchem, 529 U.S. at 625-26 & n.20) (“Typicality and adequacy, though separate \nrequirements, are closely related and are often analyzed together.”).4   \n \n4 Because this is an issue class action, Plaintiffs need only satisfy Rule 23(a)(4) with respect to their proposed issue.  \nRussell, 15 F.4th at 270; 2 Newberg and Rubenstein on Class Actions § 4:92.  It therefore is of no moment that, as \nSeaWorld points out, Plaintiffs’ newer, broader class definition “includes people who purchased a ticket but never \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 18 of 27\nAs to the questions of whether class counsel are “‘qualified, experienced and generally \nable to conduct the litigation,’” Ninivaggi v. Univ. of Del., 2023 WL 2734343, at *6 (D. Del. \nMar. 31, 2023) (quoting 1 Newberg and Rubenstein on Class Actions § 3:72); see In re NFL, 821 \nF.3d at 428, Plaintiffs have submitted as attachments to their reply brief the biographies of class \ncounsel, which include experience in civil rights cases and complex litigation, including at least \none class action.  On top of that, counsel “have developed the claims at issue in this action and \nengaged in extensive discovery” and merits briefing over the course of almost two years.  \nMacDonald v. Cashcall, Inc., 333 F.R.D. 331, 346 (D.N.J. 2019).  Through that process, they \nhave demonstrated knowledge of the applicable law.  See id.  Therefore, the Court finds that they \nadequately represent the interests of the class under Rule 23(a)(4). \nIn sum, Plaintiffs’ proposed issue class complies with the commonality, typicality, and \nadequacy requirements embodied in Rule 23(a), but they have failed to carry their burden with \nrespect to the rule’s numerosity requirement. \nB.  Compliance with Rule 23(b)(2) \nAlthough, for the reasons discussed above, Plaintiffs’ proposed class does not satisfy \nRule 23(a), for purposes of completeness the Court analyzes the class’s compliance with Rule \n23(b)(2) as well.  The rule provides that certification is proper only where “the party opposing \nthe class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final \ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a \nwhole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  The Third Circuit has long held that this means that “the class \nclaims must be cohesive.”  Barnes, 161 F.3d at 143.  In that Plaintiffs have not carried their \n \nvisited the park at all” and “those who purchased tickets, visited the park, and have no complaints of race \ndiscrimination,” while every Named Plaintiff alleges such mistreatment.  The proposed issue here focuses on \nSeaWorld’s conduct and therefore does not implicate the conflicts that it argues preclude a finding of adequacy.   \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 19 of 27\nburden on this requirement, this is another reason why their Motion will be denied.5 \nThe cohesiveness requirement “is well established.”  Id.  “[S]ignificant individual issues” \ncannot “pervade the entire action” for two reasons.  Id. (citation omitted).  First, “it would be \nunjust to bind absent class members to a negative decision where the class representatives’[] \nclaims present different individual issues than the claims of the absent members present.”  Id. \n(citation omitted); accord Dukes, 564 U.S. at 360 (observing that “[t]he key to the (b)(2) class is \nthe indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted—the notion that the \nconduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or \nas to none of them”).  Second, without a cohesive class, “the suit could become unmanageable \nand little value would be gained in proceeding as a class action . . . .”  Barnes, 161 F.3d at 143 \n(citation omitted); cf. Shelton v. Bledsoe, 775 F.3d 554, 561 (3d Cir. 2015).  Thus, where there \nare “‘disparate factual circumstances [among] class members,’” the class “may be unable to be \n \n5 SeaWorld also argues that the Named Plaintiffs do not have standing to seek injunctive relief because none of them \nplans to return to the park.  To seek injunctive relief, at least one named plaintiff must have standing to sue under \nArticle III of the United States Constitution.  McNair v. Synapse Grp. Inc., 672 F.3d 213, 223 (3d Cir. 2012) \n(citations omitted); accord Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 502 (1975).  Thus, Plaintiffs must establish, inter alia, \ninjury in fact, i.e., that they are “likely to suffer future injury from defendant’s threatened illegal conduct.”  Roe v. \nOperation Rescue, 919 F.2d 857, 864 (3d Cir. 1990) (citing City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105 (1983)).  \nStanding is “determined at the outset of the litigation,” McNair, 672 F.3d at 226; accord Newman-Green, Inc. v. \nAlfonzo-Larrain, 490 U.S. 826, 830 (1989) (“The existence of federal jurisdiction ordinarily depends on the facts as \nthey exist when the complaint is filed.”).  Although satisfied at the motion-to-dismiss stage, Burns, 675 F. Supp.3d \nat 550-51, standing “represents a jurisdictional requirement which remains open to review at all stages of the \nlitigation,” Nat’l Org. for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 U.S. 249, 255 (1994). \n \nHere, as was the case at the motion to dismiss stage, the Willie family has standing to sue.  Burns, 675 F. Supp.3d at \n550.  Unlike some of their compatriots, the Willies purchased a season pass to Sesame Place allowing them to return \nto the park prior to its expiration on January 2, 2023 (months prior to the Court’s denial of SeaWorld’s motion to \ndismiss).  That purchase “indicate[d] a non-speculative intent on their part to return to the park.”  Id.  Moreover, \nconsistent with that allegation, Lauren Willie since has testified that, if SeaWorld were to let her know what sort of \nnew trainings had been implemented and invited her to observe how things had changed at Sesame Place, she would \nbe willing to return to the park.  Although SeaWorld argues that the Willie family no longer has standing because \ntheir season passes expired and were not renewed, the Court has held that a party “may establish standing through a \npleaded intention to return to a defendant’s business ‘but for the discrimination [they] would experience there.’”  Id. \nat 550 n.10 (quoting Yucis v. Sears Outlet Stores, LLC, 813 F. App’x 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2020) (not precedential)).  \nLauren Willie’s testimony establishes the necessary intent to return to Sesame Place.  Thus, Plaintiffs have standing \nto seek injunctive relief. \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 20 of 27\ncertified under Rule 23(b)(2).”  Gates v. Rohm and Haas Co., 655 F.3d 255, 264 (3d Cir. 2011) \n(quoting Carter v. Butz, 479 F.2d 1084, 1089 (3d Cir. 1973)). \nAs discussed above, Plaintiffs bear the burden of showing that certification would be \nconsistent with Rule 23.  Russell, 15 F.4th at 265; accord Reyes v. Netdeposit, LLC, 802 F.3d \n469, 485 (3d Cir. 2015).  That extends to compliance with Rule 23(b) as well.  Comcast, 569 \nU.S. at 33.  Despite their unambiguous burden, Plaintiffs’ briefing does not include much of any \nargumentation in favor of cohesiveness.  Instead, their opening brief relies on Rule 23(b)(2)’s \nplain language without reference to the cohesiveness requirement.  And in their reply brief, they \nhang their collective hat on their commonality argument without explaining why their arguments \nin favor of commonality map onto the separate cohesiveness requirement.  Their entire argument \nin favor of cohesiveness in that brief is copied below: \nDefendants make two arguments supporting their contention that Plaintiffs’ \nclaims are not cohesive.  First, they argue each Plaintiff must prove the intentional \nracism was the but-for cause of their contractual injury.  Second, Defendants \nargue Plaintiffs cannot establish a “strong commonality of interests” required for \na finding of cohesiveness because Plaintiffs claim individual monetary damages.  \nThese arguments fail for all the reasons set forth, supra, in Plaintiffs’ reply to \nDefendants’ failure of commonality arguments.  \n \nTo be sure, “[t]he cohesion requirement is not wholly separate from the previous inquiry” under \nRule 23(a), including commonality.  S.R. ex rel. Rosenbauer v. Pa. Dep’t of Hum. Servs., 325 \nF.R.D. 103, 111 (M.D. Pa. 2018).  But they remain separate requirements for class certification.  \nThe Supreme Court has fashioned clear instructions for Plaintiffs: they must carry their burden \nwith respect to both components of Rule 23.  Comcast, 569 U.S. at 33.  In that Plaintiffs have \ncited no legal authority to support the proposition that their proposed class is cohesive, they have \nwaived any argument in favor of their compliance with this requirement.  See Burns, 675 F. \nSupp.3d at 548 (citing Reynolds v. Wagner, 128 F.3d 166, 178 (3d Cir. 1997)); E.D. Pa. Local \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 21 of 27\nCiv. R. 7.1(c); cf. Gates, 655 F.3d at 271 (affirming denial of class certification where “[t]he trial \ncourt properly considered and rejected the arguments plaintiffs did make” (emphasis added)).  \nAgain, as with Plaintiffs’ failings on numerosity, if there were no other defects in Motion, \nperhaps a denial without prejudice could be warranted.  But, as will be explained below, the \nissue that Plaintiffs seek to resolve on a class-wide basis is not appropriate for such adjudication, \nso denial without prejudice is not merited. \nC.  Appropriateness of Certifying an Issue Class Under Rule 23(c)(4) \nPlaintiffs seek to certify a class only to resolve one issue: “Whether SeaWorld \nintentionally refused to identify and address overt and/or implicit biases in its park employees, \nbetween 2018 and 2022, to ensure said biases would not be acted out upon the minority guests of \nthe amusement park.”  That issue is not appropriate for certification, so Plaintiffs’ Motion will be \ndenied. \nThe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure vest district courts with discretion to certify a class \n“with respect to particular issues.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4).  “Selectively used, this provision \nmay enable a court to achieve the economies of class action treatment for a portion of a case, the \nrest of which may either not qualify under Rule 23(a) or may be unmanageable as a class action.”  \nManual for Complex Litigation (Fourth) § 21.24 (May 2023 Update).  Thus, “Rule 23(c)(4) both \nimposes a duty on the court to insure that only those questions which are appropriate for class \nadjudication be certified, and gives it ample power to ‘treat common things in common and to \ndistinguish the distinguishable.’”  Chiang v. Veneman, 385 F.3d 256, 267 (3d Cir. 2004), \nabrogated on other grounds as stated in In re Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 318 n.18 (quoting \nJenkins v. United Gas Corp., 400 F.2d 28, 35 (5th Cir. 1968)).  Conversely, “[c]ertification is not \nappropriate if” it “would not make the case more manageable or serve the varied interests Rule \n23 seeks to advance.”  Hamilton v. Accu-tek, 935 F. Supp. 1307, 1332 (E.D.N.Y. 1996) \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 22 of 27\n(Weinstein, J.).  A court should exercise its discretion under Rule 23(c)(4) after conducting the \nsame “rigorous analysis” required for “any other certification determination under Rule 23.”  \nHohider v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 574 F.3d 169, 201 (3d Cir. 2009). \nIn Gates, the Third Circuit identified nine “non-exclusive” factors to guide courts in \ndeciding whether to certify such a class, derived from the American Law Institute’s Principles of \nthe Law of Aggregate Litigation: \n1.  the type of claim(s) and issue(s) in question; \n2.  the overall complexity of the case;  \n3.  the efficiencies to be gained by granting partial certification in light of realistic \nprocedural alternatives;  \n4.  the substantive law underlying the claim(s), including any choice-of-law \nquestions it may present and whether the substantive law separates the issue(s) \nfrom other issues concerning liability or remedy;  \n5.  the impact partial certification will have on the constitutional and statutory rights \nof both the class members and the defendant(s);  \n6.  the potential preclusive effect or lack thereof that resolution of the proposed issue \nclass will have; \n7.  the repercussions certification of an issue(s) class will have on the effectiveness \nand fairness of resolution of remaining issues; \n8.  the impact individual proceedings may have upon one another, including whether \nremedies are indivisible such that granting or not granting relief to any claimant \nas a practical matter determines the claims of others; and  \n9.  the kind of evidence presented on the issue(s) certified and potentially presented \non the remaining issues, including the risk subsequent triers of fact will need to \nreexamine evidence and findings from resolution of the common issue(s). \n \nRussell, 15 F.4th at 268 (quoting Gates, 655 F.3d at 273).   \nOn top of these factors, in Russell, the Third Circuit appears to have added a threshold \ninquiry.  There, the court noted that:  \nGates did not define which “issues” would be appropriate for class treatment or, \nmore importantly, which would not.  Specifically, Gates did not answer whether \nthe term “particular issues” in Rule 23(c)(4) could encompass claim elements \n(like duty or breach, or causation or reliance) and defenses (like consent or \nintervening cause), or if the “particular issues” that the district court could certify \n“when appropriate” must be limited to questions that would resolve a defendant’s \nliability. \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 23 of 27\nId. at 268-29.  While Gates “[a]t several points . . . appears to suggest that the certified ‘issues’ \nshould (perhaps except in exceptional circumstances) be able to resolve a defendant’s liability,” \nat other points, the opinion “suggests that claim elements may be appropriate for issue-class \ntreatment in certain circumstances.”  Id. at 269.  The Third Circuit thus held that in the latter set \nof cases—where the “issue[], once resolved, do[es] not resolve a defendant’s liability”—\ncertification is proper “provided that” doing so: (1) “substantially facilitates the resolution of the \ncivil dispute;” (2) “preserves the parties’ procedural and substantive rights and responsibilities;” \nand, (3) “respects the constitutional and statutory rights of all class member and defendants.”  Id. \nat 270.  The implication from this rule is that, when presented with motions to certify classes to \nanswer questions that do not wholly resolve liability, if these three preconditions are not \nsatisfied, a district court need not apply the Gates factors because certification would not be \nappropriate under Rule 23(c)(4).6 \n  Plaintiffs’ proposed issue plainly implicates Russell’s threshold test.  The proposed issue \nwould not address any component of SeaWorld’s potential liability under Section 1981.  To \nprevail in such an action, the plaintiff “must initially plead and ultimately prove that, but for \nrace, it would not have suffered the loss of a legally protected right.”  Comcast v. Nat’l Ass’n of \nAfr. Am.-Owned Media, 140 S. Ct. 1009, 1019 (2020).  Because the statute forbids intentional \ndiscrimination only, Gen. Bldg. Contractors Ass’n, Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 391 \n(1982), SeaWorld’s failure to “identify and address overt and/or implicit biases in its park \nemployees” is not dispositive as to its liability on that claim.  Nor would the issue fully resolve \n \n6 Another way to conceptualize Russell’s holding is as identifying three “kinds of classes that may be certified” \nconsistent with Rule 23(c)(4): “issues related to overall liability, particular elements of a claim, or issues that would \nsubstantially advance litigation.”  C.P. v. N.J. Dep’t of Educ., 2022 WL 3572815, at *10 (D.N.J. Aug. 19, 2022) \n(citing Russell, 15 F.4th at 270).  The result is the same here under either approach, as Plaintiffs’ proposed issue \nonly implicates the final category and falls short of doing so. \n \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 24 of 27\nSeaWorld’s liability for negligent supervision, which requires proof that: (1) the defendant \n“fail[ed] to exercise ordinary care to prevent an intentional harm by an employee acting outside \nthe scope of his employment;” (2) the harm took place on the employer’s premises; and, (3) the \nemployer “knows or has reason to know of the necessity and ability to control the employee.”  \nBelmont, 708 F.3d at 487-88 (citations omitted).  Plaintiffs’ proposed issue would address \nportions of the first and third elements of their claim but would fully resolve neither.7  For \nexample, assuming arguendo that such “overt and/or implicit biases” existed, whether any \nSesame Place employees in fact acted upon those biases against class members falls outside the \nproposed issue but is critical to SeaWorld’s liability on the first element.  Without proof of “an \nintentional harm by an employee acting outside the scope of his employment,” a negligent \nsupervision claim fails.  Id. at 487.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ proposed issue class implicates Russell’s \nthree-part test.8 \nApplying that test, certification of an issue class action would not substantially facilitate \nthe resolution of this case.  Russell, 15 F.4th at 270.  As was the case in Gates itself, the \nproposed issue implicates questions that “are not divisible from the individual issues.”  655 F.3d \nat 273 (citation omitted).  There, the plaintiffs moved to certify an issue class regarding a \ncompany’s liability to landowners whose properties it was accused of damaging.  Id. at 258, 272.  \nThe company allegedly had “dumped wastewater containing vinylidene chloride into a nearby \n \n7 Neither party disputes that alleged discrimination took place on SeaWorld property. \n \n8 Plaintiffs argue that Gates and Russell are inapposite because their proposed issue class is focused on resolving \ntheir entire negligent supervision claim, as opposed to a specific issue within that claim.  This is unpersuasive for \ntwo reasons.  First, Plaintiffs rely only on district court caselaw to support that proposition.  See Walney v. SWEPI \nLP, 2015 WL 5333541, at *31 (W.D. Pa. Sept. 14, 2015), class decertified, 2019 WL 1436938, at *14 (W.D. Pa. \nMar. 31, 2019).  Second, even if the Court were to adopt this interpretation of Gates, Plaintiffs’ proposed issue \nwould not fit within their own rule because it would not resolve key elements of their negligent supervision claim, \nsuch as whether class members suffered intentional racial discrimination.  Belmont, 708 F.3d at 487. \n \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 25 of 27\nlagoon that seeped into an underground aquifer where it degraded into vinyl chloride, a \ncarcinogen.”  Id. at 258.  From there, it “evaporated into the air . . . and was swept by the wind \nover” plaintiffs’ properties.  Id.  The Third Circuit affirmed the district court’s conclusion that \ncertification was improper because determining whether the defendant dumped the carcinogen \nthat seeped into the plaintiffs’ aquifer would not resolve whether that was the cause of any \ndiminution in their properties’ values or the extent of that damage, both of which were \nindividualized inquiries.  Id. at 272-73.   \nPlaintiffs’ proposed issue presents analogous problems because the extent of SeaWorld’s \nclass-wide action (or inaction) “to address overt and/or implicit biases” leaves unresolved the \nindividualized questions of: (1) with whom each Plaintiff interacted at the park; and, (2) when \nthe company knew that it had a duty to take action with respect to the employee in question.  The \nanswers to both questions are essential to SeaWorld’s liability for negligent supervision.  Russell, \n15 F.4th at 270.  First, for each class member, Plaintiffs will need to show that a specific \nemployee committed an act of intentional racial discrimination.  Belmont, 708 F.3d at 488.  But \nthe proposed issue focuses on SeaWorld’s knowledge and conduct only, not its employees’.  \nSecond, critical to every negligent supervision claim is when the employer was on notice to its \nemployee’s illicit tendencies.  See Dempsey v. Walso Bureau, Inc., 246 A.2d 418, 422 (Pa. 1968) \n(“[W]hat was [the employee’s] conduct prior to [the date of the incident] and was it of such \nnature as to indicate a propensity for violence?”); Nelson v. Loftus, 2019 WL 175127, at *5 (E.D. \nPa. Jan. 11, 2019).  But the proposed issue does not touch this set of inquiries, which would have \nto be conducted on an individualized basis.  Mere “refus[al] to identify and address,” in \nPlaintiffs’ terms, is not enough to implicate SeaWorld’s duty of care—the employer must have \n“specific knowledge of” a specific employee-perpetrator’s prior behavior.  Hutchison ex rel. \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 26 of 27\nHutchison v. Luddy, 742 A.2d 1052, 1062 (Pa. 1999); accord Dempsey, 246 A.2d at 422.  \nFinally, how SeaWorld reacted (or failed to react) to their discovery of an employee’s propensity \nto engage in racial discrimination might vary from employee to employee.  All these \nindividualized inquiries, and perhaps more, are inherent in Plaintiff’s proposed issue class and \nmake it unsuitable for certification.  See Gonzalez v. Corning, 885 F.3d 186, 202-03 (3d Cir. \n2018). \nIn this respect, this case in stark contrast to cases where the issue to be certified would \nadvance resolution of the case.  For example, in a complex antitrust case, it was proper to certify \na class action where the proposed issues—for example, whether the defendant “engaged in \nanticompetitive and deceptive conduct” or “had a specific intent to monopolize”—all related to \n“the issue of anticompetitive conduct,” which “is wholly severable from the issues of antitrust \nimpact and damages.”  In re Suboxone (Buprenorphine Hydrochloride and Nalaxone) Antitrust \nLitig., 421 F. Supp.3d 12, 71, 77 (E.D. Pa. 2019).  Resolving these issues would “require copious \namounts of witness testimony, documents, and expert analysis, all of which will be common to \neach individual class member.”  Id. at 77 (emphasis added).  That is not the case here because, as \ndiscussed above, the nature and extent of SeaWorld’s “intentional[] refus[al] to identify and \naddress . . . biases in its park employees” will vary depending on the employee with whom each \nclass member interacted.   \nIssue class actions should “either obviate the need for further individual trials or . . . fairly \nand efficiently advance those individual trials by resolving multiple questions common to the \nclass.”  Id. at 77-78; accord Russell, 15 F.4th at 270.  Because this proposed issue class does \nneither, certification under Rule 23(c)(4) is improper. \n \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 138   Filed 04/15/24   Page 27 of 27\nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification will be denied.  An \nappropriate order follows. \n              BY THE COURT: \n \n              /s/Wendy Beetlestone, J.      \n         \n              _______________________________   \n              WENDY BEETLESTONE, J. \n27 \n ",

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA \n \nQUINTON BURNS et al.,  CIVIL ACTION \nPlaintiffs,   \n   \nv.   \n   \nSEAWORLD PARKS &  NO.  22-2941 \nENTERTAINMENT, INC., SEAWORLD \nPARKS & ENTERTAINMENT, LLC AND \nJOHN DOES 1, 2, 3 AND 4, \nDefendants. \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n \n  Defendants SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. and SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment \nLLC (collectively, “SeaWorld”) move for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ racial discrimination \nclaims for negligence per se, as premised on a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and negligent \nsupervision arising out of events at Sesame Place Philadelphia (“Sesame Place”), a theme park \nthat the entities operate in Langhorne, Pennsylvania.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  For the reasons laid \nout below, SeaWorld’s Motion will be granted in part and denied in part.  \nI.  BACKGROUND \nExcept where noted below, the following facts are not in genuine dispute.1 \n \n1 Two preliminary issues merit addressing.  The first is how to characterize some of Plaintiffs’ responses to \nSeaWorld’s factual statements.  To call into question parts of SeaWorld’s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts \n(ECF No. 108-2), Plaintiffs say that, “while [they] do not dispute the testimony referenced [therein] is as stated, \n[they] do dispute the veracity of those material fact statements.”  These responses, Plaintiffs contend, “thereby \nplac[e] them in dispute.”  Not so.  When opposing summary judgment, “[t]he non-moving party may not merely \ndeny the allegations in the moving party’s pleadings; instead he must show where in the record there exists a \ngenuine dispute over a material fact.”  Doe v. Abington Friends Sch., 480 F.3d 252, 256 (3d Cir. 2007) (citing \nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-26 (1986)).  Plaintiffs’ omnibus response does not cite any portion of \nthe record that places Defendants’ statements into genuine dispute, so these statements are deemed undisputed.  See \nAraoye v. Vilsack, 2024 WL 422076, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 5, 2024); accord Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), (e). \n \nThe second is the status of SeaWorld’s Supplemental Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (ECF No. 131-1), \nsubmitted in support of its Supplemental Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 131), to which Plaintiffs did not \nrespond.  The Court’s Policies and Procedures, referenced as part of the Scheduling Order in this case (ECF No. 36), \nrequire the party opposing summary judgment to file a statement of disputed material facts and, where a fact is \npurported to be in dispute, provide a citation to the record to support that view.  Where, as here, that party has failed \nto do so, the movant’s offered facts are deemed undisputed.  See, e.g., Lance v. Se. Pa. Transp. Auth., 2023 WL \n\nA.  Sesame Place \nSeaWorld operates the Sesame Place theme park in Langhorne, Pennsylvania.  The park \ncontains several attractions, including rides and opportunities to interact with employees dressed \nas characters from the Sesame Street television program (“costumed characters”).  In particular, \nSesame Place operates parades and “meet-and-greets” whereby visitors can interact with these \ncostumed characters.  In meet-and-greets, a costumed character, accompanied by another Sesame \nPlace employee who is not in costume (a “walk host”), will go to a specific location within the \npark so that guests can take pictures or videos with the character.  Guests form a line, which the \nwalk host is responsible for cutting off after a certain amount of time has passed.  In general, \nmeet-and-greets run for thirty minutes, but if the “real feel” temperature is at least 100 degrees \nFahrenheit, they will run for only twenty minutes.  Many meet-and-greets are scheduled to end \nan hour before a parade so that the employee performing as a Sesame Street character can attend \nboth events.  A parade is a twenty-five-minute, choreographed event involving costumed \ncharacters, floats, and dancers.  Costumed characters march along the route and are instructed to \nremain in front of the floats.  A parade includes three “show stops”—scripted performances by \ncostumed characters along the route.  At these stops, costumed characters can interact with park \nguests who line up along the parade route, waving to, high-fiving, and hugging them.  (In 2022, \nbecause of low staffing, Sesame Place also ran “mini-parades,” which ran for fifteen minutes \ninstead of twenty-five and were not supposed to include any stops.)   \nMeet-and-greets and parades are run by employees of Sesame Place’s Entertainment \nDepartment.  One former employee testified that the Entertainment Department maintains \n \n5916464, at *2 n.3 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 11, 2023); Farhangui v. Grossinger, 2021 WL 37711, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 4, \n2021). \n \n2 \n \n\nseniority levels within it.  The most junior employees are generally responsible for meet-and-\ngreets but not parades.  More senior members of the Entertainment Department would perform in \nthe parades.  One such employee testified that he was given a few specific instructions on how to \ngo about that performance.  For one, it was “a strict rule” that guests could not pass the yellow \nsafety line that runs along the edge of the parade route to interact with the costumed characters, \nand vice versa.  If guests crossed the yellow line, employees were instructed to guide them back \nto a safe place to stand.  On top of that, the employees performing as costumed characters were \nsupposed to spread out.  Two such characters tended to march together on opposite sides of the \nstreet; if one crossed the street, the other one had to as well so that they did not end up on the \nsame side.  Because, as one costumed character performer testified, “the floats are continuously \nmoving, it is impossible to [interact with] every single kid on both sides of the street at any given \nmoment.”   \nThe Events and Production Manager at Sesame Place, Peter Schweizer, agreed that \ncostumed characters are given wide discretion in with whom they interact at parades.  Consistent \nwith that testimony, Sesame Place’s President said that costumed characters were trained more \ngenerally in how to “embody[] who the character was” and “how to engage with . . . guests.”  \nBeyond the choreography and safety protocols discussed above, however, the parties do not \nidentify a specific park policy governing how Entertainment Department employees should go \nabout those interactions.   \nB.  The Park’s Employees and the Surrounding Community \nSesame Place is located in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, which has a population of over \n600,000.  The park recruited employees from the surrounding community, including local high \nschools.  The screening process for these hires varied depending on their age.  Those who were \nat least eighteen years old had to pass a background check before starting work.  Minors, \n3 \n \n\nhowever, did not have to pass a background check until they turned eighteen.  At least with \nrespect to minor employees who were students at Bucks County high schools, their schools were \nnot permitted to disclose disciplinary information to Sesame Place. \nThroughout this litigation, Plaintiffs have alleged that a significant portion of Sesame \nPlace employees are from nearby towns, and that this region and its high schools suffer from \nendemic racism.  Nevertheless, Plaintiffs maintain that Sesame Place disregarded the racist \nenvironment in which their employees were steeped and placed them in positions where they \ncould inflict their prejudices on racial minorities who visited the park.  \nA significant portion of Plaintiffs’ theory rests on the testimony of Barbara Simmons.2  \nSimmons is the former Executive Director of The Peace Center, an organization located in \nLanghorne, Pennsylvania that focuses on addressing racism and violence in Bucks County \nschools.  Starting in 2016, she kept a spreadsheet that compiled incidents of racism or other \nforms of discrimination that she heard about via emails or phone calls from community \nmembers.  Through May 2020, she documented and investigated 142 incidents of \ndiscrimination—including racism, ableism, and antisemitism—that were included in the \nspreadsheet from elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, and other locations in the \narea.  Thus, the spreadsheet includes incidents that did not involve local high schools, and some \nof the ones that did take place in Bucks County high schools did not involve student perpetrators.  \nAlthough it is not clear from the record exactly what Simmons did to investigate each incident in \nthe spreadsheet, in the aftermath of at least one event, she spoke with the victim’s family and the \n \n2 SeaWorld argues that parts of Simmons’s testimony is not proper from a lay witness under Federal Rule of \nEvidence 701 and that her spreadsheet is inadmissible double hearsay under Federal Rules of Evidence 802 and 805.  \nThe Court need not decide this issue because, as will be explained below, even if true and fully admissible, her \ntestimony and spreadsheet do not offer a basis for denying summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ negligent supervision \nclaims. \n \n4 \n \n\nschool’s principal and offered her support.   \nBased on her work, Simmons concluded that there is a “culture of racism”—in her words, \none where incidents of discrimination are met with indifference by leaders such that “kids that \nare different don’t feel safe”—in Bucks County.  That said, she was unable to pinpoint whether \nthere was a culture of racism at specific Bucks County high schools.  Moreover, to Simmons’s \nknowledge, the spreadsheet does not contain any incidents of racism that took place at Sesame \nPlace or that involved a student from Bucks County who worked at Sesame Place, including \nthose who are alleged to have discriminated against Plaintiffs.  No supervisor at Sesame Place \nwho was asked as part of this case had ever heard that Bucks County high schools had a \nreputation for being racist environments.   \nWhatever the cause, the record does show that there were complaints of racial \ndiscrimination by visitors to Sesame Place, although not necessarily involving costumed \ncharacter performers prior to July 16, 2022.  On that day, a video capturing an incident from a \nmini-parade involving a Sesame Place employee portraying the character Rosita went viral.  In \nthe video, Rosita can be seen walking along the parade route near the yellow safety line.  Two \nBlack girls approach Rosita, who had high-fived two people who appear to be White seconds \nbefore.  Rosita then wags her finger at a person off-screen and at the two Black girls before \npassing them out of frame.  This incident received significant nationwide news coverage.   \nC.  Plaintiffs’ Visits to Sesame Place \nAlthough the family whom Rosita turned away from is not a party to this case, Plaintiffs, \na group of Black and Hispanic parents and their children who visited Sesame Place in 2021 and \n2022, allege that they were treated similarly when they visited the park.  Many of these \ninteractions were recorded, and witnesses’ discussions of these videos form an important part of \nthe evidence here. \n5 \n \n\ni. The Burns Family \nPlaintiff Quinton Burns and his daughter, K.B., visited Sesame Place in June 2022.  \nWhile at the park, the Burns family attended a meet-and-greet to take a picture with the \ncostumed character Abby Cadabby.  When the family reached the front of the line, the walk host \nescorting Abby Cadabby told them that the line was now closed because the character had to get \nready for an upcoming parade.  Despite having been turned away from the meet-and-greet, Burns \nsaw a White family get in line after it was supposed to be closed as he left to attend a parade.  \nLater, at that parade, K.B. tried to interact with costumed character employees performing as \nTelly Monster and Ernie.  K.B. reached out to touch Ernie, who high-fived many nearby White \nguests, but not K.B.  Similarly, as Telly Monster bounded over to where K.B. was standing, the \ncharacter reached out to a White guest right next to her.  The Sesame Place employee performing \nas Telly Monster testified that he did not see K.B. as he was crossing the street.  The Burns \nfamily has not returned to Sesame Place since this visit and does not have plans to do so. \nii. The Fleming Family \nPlaintiff Nathan Fleming and his family, including his daughter, O.F., visited Sesame \nPlace on July 4, 2022.  During a parade, a Sesame Place employee dressed as Telly Monster \nallegedly ignored his daughter, who is Black, but high-fived a nearby Asian boy.  This came \nafter a fifteen-minute period during the parade where Fleming “felt like [O.F.] was being \noverlooked . . . as far as like basic waves, gestures, high-fives.”  As Fleming saw it, the costumed \ncharacter playing Telly Monster “was walking towards her in her line of sight with his hand out \nand then he . . . gave the high-five to the Asian kid.”  Instead of high-fiving O.F., however, Telly \nMonster “brushed” her hand, “but it wasn’t like a high-five.  It wasn’t a pat or a respectful \nacknowledgement.  It looked more like just a downward motion.”  From there, Telly Monster \n“just kept walking, doing his routine.”  Fleming saw “hundreds of kids” in the crowd at the \n6 \n \n\nparade, and “most of them don’t look like [O.F.], and there’s a lot of acknowledgement . . . \nwhether it had been touch or waves, that O.F. didn’t get.”  He conceded, however, that he had no \nway of knowing what the Sesame Place employee wearing the Telly Monster costume could see \nin the crowd.  The Fleming family has not returned to Sesame Place since this visit and does not \nhave plans to do so. \niii. The Miles Family \nPlaintiff Lashonda Miles and her family visited Sesame Place in June 2022.  Miles \ntestified that, at a mini-parade, a Sesame Place employee performing as the Sesame Street \ncharacter Rosita “gave a little white girl . . . a hug, and basically walked past [her son] M.C.,” \nwho had his arms outstretched to embrace the character.  Miles believed that, along the parade \nroute, costumed characters “have to show some type of recognition”—“[e]ither . . . a high five, a \nhug, or a wave”—to guests.  The Sesame Place employee performing as Rosita testified that he \nhugged the first girl in his path whom he came upon and then decided to wave to subsequent \nguests in order to keep the mini-parade moving.  He also testified that he in fact waved to M.C.’s \nsister, who had her hand outstretched to interact with Rosita.  The Miles family has not returned \nto Sesame Place since this visit and does not have plans to do so. \niv. The Morales Family \nPlaintiff Ingrid Morales and her daughter, N.M., both of whom identify as Afro-Latina, \nvisited Sesame Place in July 2022.  She testified that, at a parade, costumed character employees \nperforming as the Sesame Street characters Big Bird, Grover, and Baby Bear refused to interact \nwith N.M. while engaging with nearby White children and their families.  While standing behind \nthe yellow safety line along the parade route, N.M. put her hand up to high-five Big Bird, who \ndid not reciprocate when walking by.  Big Bird did, however, interact with an apparently White \nchild in a stroller nearby.  The employee performing as Grover behaved similarly with other \n7 \n \n\nnearby guests whom Morales identified as White. \nThe employees who were performing as Big Bird and Grover testified that they did not \nsee N.M. because the costumes that they were wearing substantially limit their peripheral vision \n(performers in these costumes see out of Big Bird’s tie and Grover’s mouth respectively).  The \nemployee who was performing as Baby Bear testified that he did not interact with N.M. because \nhis colleague, performing as Telly Monster, had crossed the street to his side of the route, and at \nthat point, his instructions were to cross to the other side.  The Morales family has not returned to \nSesame Place since this visit and does not have plans to do so. \nv. The Romero Family \nThe Romero family visited Sesame Place in June 2022.  Plaintiff Yoselis Romero \ntestified that, during a parade, park employees yelled at her child for being past the point where \naudience members were allowed to stand.  On top of that, she testified that characters Zoe and \nCookie Monster did not interact with her daughter, E.C., as fulsomely as they did with nearby \nWhite children.  Specifically, while at the parade, while the Sesame Place employee performing \nas Cookie Monster gave other children “a full . . . blown hug,” E.C. received only [a] quick tap \nin the air.”  Similarly, the employee performing as Zoe gave a “thumbs up” gesture towards E.C. \nwhile approaching or touching other children.  The Romero family has not returned to Sesame \nPlace since this visit and does not have plans to do so. \nvi. The Valdez Family \nPlaintiff Katie Valdez visited Sesame Place on a season pass in December 2021.  She \ntestified that, at a parade, a Sesame Place employee performing as the character Abby Cadabby \nignored her Hispanic son, M.L., while interacting with similarly situated White children, \nincluding a boy in a stroller next to them.  Valdez noted that Abby Cadabby’s failure to see M.L. \nis suspicious given that he is taller than the boy in the stroller with whom the character did \n8 \n \n\ninteract.  The employee who was performing as Abby Cadabby testified that, when M.L. \napproached her, he was outside of her limited field of vision—she sees out of the costume’s \nmouth, which she testified was not pointed towards M.L. at any point—and before that, he was \nbehind the group of children with whom she was interacting. \nAt the time of her visit to Sesame Place, Valdez had a season pass to the park, but it since \nhas expired.  In her response to SeaWorld’s interrogatories, Katie Valdez said that she last \nvisited Sesame Place in August 2022.  In her deposition, Valdez conceded that she had no \ncurrent plans to return to the park.  Months after that deposition was taken, however, Plaintiffs \nfiled an affidavit from Valdez saying that she and her family visited Sesame Place in June, \nAugust, and December 2023, having received guest passes from a cousin who had a season pass \nto the park.  Valdez also wrote that the family had plans to visit Sesame Place for the 2024 Easter \nholiday.  The inconsistencies between these statements will be addressed below. \nvii. The Valette Family \nPlaintiff Ashley Valette and her family, including her daughter, D.V., visited Sesame \nPlace in June 2022.  The family attended a mini-parade, where she testified that a Sesame Place \nemployee dressed as the character Grover initially moved towards her daughter, who is Black, \nbut ultimately ignored her and hugged two White children next to them instead.  No other \ncostumed characters interacted with Valette’s children, but only the incident involving Grover \nforms the “basis” for Valette’s suit.  \nThe Sesame Place employee who was performing as Grover testified that she only chose \nto hug the White children in the video of this incident because they had stepped into the street \nbeyond the yellow safety line.  A hug allowed her to usher the children to a safe position.  Once \nshe had done so, she did not have time to interact with any other guests because, in a mini-\nparade, the costumed characters “have to keep moving.”  Moreover, a float was approaching, and \n9 \n \n\nSesame Place rules mandated that she stay in front of the float.  The Valette family has not \nreturned to Sesame Place since this visit and does not have plans to do so. \nviii. The Willie Family \nPlaintiff Lauren Willie and her family visited Sesame Place in July 2022 using season \npasses.  Willie testified that, while walking through the park, her daughter, L.W., who is Black, \nwas ignored by a Sesame Place employee dressed as the character Rosita and her walk host, who \ninstead took a picture with a White child.  Although L.W. ran towards Rosita, the character \n“skipped off to a place . . . 20, 30 feet away where a White child was standing and taking \npictures with her parents and jumped in the picture” with them.  The Willie family later came \nacross Rosita again at a meet-and-greet, and they took their place at the end of the line to see her.  \nThe same person who had been escorting Rosita previously cut the line off right before they \nwould have been able to meet her and said that Rosita would not be seeing anyone else that day.  \nNo family was behind them at that point.  On top of that, Willie testified that, when her family \npurchased food at the park, it took much longer for their food to arrive than it did for other guests \nwhom she believed to be White.  The employee performing as Rosita testified that she did not \nsee L.W. running towards her, in large part because she was too short to be in her costume’s field \nof vision.  The season passes that the Willie family used to enter Sesame Place that day have \nexpired, and Lauren Willie testified that the family does not have plans to return to the park. \nD.  Procedural Background \nPlaintiffs filed this lawsuit in July 2022, alleging that Sesame Place had violated the Civil \nRights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and had committed several forms of negligence under \nPennsylvania law.  They seek $50 million in damages and significant equitable relief, requesting \nthat the Court order SeaWorld implement: (1) “rigorous mandatory cultural sensitivity training \nfor its agents and/or employees;” (2) “mandatory educational courses for its agents and/or \n10 \n \n\nemployees on the history of discrimination against minority people in America provided by a \nmutually agreed upon nationally acclaimed expert in the field of African and minority History \nand Culture;” and, (3) “psychological screening methods for vetting their potential agents and/or \nemployees to avoid hiring racially bigoted employees and agents, and to evaluate by appropriate \npsychological testing and behavioral history whether its existing agents and/or employees are \nracially bigoted who therefore should not be retained.” \nThe Court dismissed most of Plaintiffs’ state law claims, allowing their Section 1981 \n(and, thus, negligence per se) claims to proceed.  Burns v. SeaWorld Parks & Ent., Inc., 675 F. \nSupp.3d 532, 551 (E.D. Pa. 2023).  The Court concluded that Plaintiffs allegation “that the \ncostumed characters repeatedly ignored minority children while engaging with similarly situated \nWhite children . . . adequately alleged the impairment of a contractual interest for their Section \n1981 claim to proceed.”  Id. at 543.  Those claims and a claim for negligent supervision are \nbefore the Court on SeaWorld’s Motion for Summary Judgment.3 \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nA party is entitled to summary judgment if it shows “that there is no genuine dispute as to \nany material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 56(a).  “By its very terms, this standard provides that the mere existence of some alleged \nfactual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for \nsummary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.”  \n \n3 Plaintiffs filed this case as a class action.  The Court denied their motion for class certification prior to addressing \nSeaWorld’s Motion for Summary Judgment.  Burns, 2024 WL 1621337, at *14.  After Plaintiffs filed their motion \nfor class certification, they moved for leave to amend to reincorporate their claim for negligent supervision, which \nthe Court granted.  Burns v. SeaWorld Parks & Ent., Inc., 2024 WL 1016363, at *8 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 8, 2024). \n \nWhen the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend, the Court rejected SeaWorld’s argument, reprised \nhere, that the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act preempts Plaintiffs’ negligent supervision claims.  Id. at *3-5. \n \n11 \n \n\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986).  “Material facts are those that \ncould affect the outcome of the proceeding.”  Roth v. Norfalco LLC, 651 F.3d 367, 373 (3d Cir. \n2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Unless those facts are derived from \nevidence that would be admissible at trial, they cannot defeat a motion for summary judgment.  \nCallahan v. A.E.V., Inc., 182 F.3d 237, 252 n.11 (3d Cir. 1999); accord Fed. R. Civ. P. \n56(c)(1)(B), 56(c)(2).  “A genuine issue is present when a reasonable trier of fact, viewing all of \nthe record evidence, could rationally find in favor of the non-moving party in light of his burden \nof proof.”  Doe v. Abington Friends Sch., 480 F.3d 252, 256 (3d Cir. 2007) (citing Celotex Corp. \nv. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-26 (1986); Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248-52).  “The non-moving party \nmay not merely deny the allegations in the moving party’s pleadings; instead he must show \nwhere in the record there exists a genuine dispute over a material fact.”  Id. (citation omitted).  A \nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law where the “nonmoving party has failed to \nmake a sufficient showing on an essential element of her case with respect to which she has the \nburden of proof.”  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. \n“Inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts contained in the evidential sources \nmust be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.”  Peters Twp. Sch. \nDist. v. Hartford Acc. & Indem. Co., 833 F.2d 32, 34 (3d Cir. 1987); see also Scott v. Harris, 550 \nU.S. 372, 378 (2007) (cautioning that “courts are required to view the facts and draw reasonable \ninferences” in favor of the nonmoving party (emphasis added)).  “When opposing parties tell two \ndifferent stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury \ncould believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a \nmotion for summary judgment.”  Scott, 550 U.S. at 380. \n12 \n \n\nIII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Standing to Seek Injunctive Relief \nAs it has at other points in this litigation, SeaWorld argues that Plaintiffs do not have \nstanding to seek injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs must establish that they have standing consistent \nwith Article III of the United States Constitution for “each type of relief sought.”  Summers \nv. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009); see ZF Meritor, LLC v. Eaton Corp., 696 F.3d \n254, 301 (3d Cir. 2012) (citing City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105 (1983)) (noting \nthat “a plaintiff may have standing to pursue damages, but lack standing to seek injunctive \nrelief”).  In cases like this one with multiple plaintiffs, “[a]t least one plaintiff must have standing \nto seek each form of relief requested in the complaint.”  Town of Chester v. Laroe Ests., Inc., 581 \nU.S. 433, 439 (2017); accord Children’s Health Def., Inc. v. Rutgers, State Univ. of N.J., 93 \nF.4th 66, 75 (3d Cir. 2024) (citation omitted). \nStanding is “determined at the outset of the litigation,” McNair v. Synapse Grp. Inc., 672 \nF.3d 213, 226 (3d Cir. 2012), and was established for purposes of injunctive relief at the motion-\nto-dismiss stage, Burns, 675 F. Supp.3d at 550-51, as well as the class certification stage, Burns \nv. SeaWorld, 2024 WL 1621337, at *10 n.5 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 15, 2024), but it “represents a \njurisdictional requirement which remains open to review at all stages of the litigation,” Nat’l \nOrg. for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 U.S. 249, 255 (1994).  “At summary judgment, a plaintiff \n‘can no longer rest on . . . mere allegations, but must set forth by affidavit or other evidence \nspecific facts’ establishing standing.”  Greenberg v. Lehocky, 81 F.4th 376, 384 (3d Cir. 2023), \npetition for cert. filed, No. 23-833 (U.S. Feb. 2, 2024) (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, \n568 U.S. 398, 412 (2013)). \n“To establish standing, a plaintiff must show an injury in fact fairly traceable to the \nchallenged action that a favorable ruling may redress.”  Id. (citation omitted).  The injury-in-fact \n13 \n \n\nmust be “actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.”  Blunt v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., \n767 F.3d 247, 278 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 \n(1992)).  “The actuality or imminence requirement takes on outsize importance when, as here, \nplaintiffs seek injunctive relief.”  Richard Roe W.M. v. Devereux Found., 650 F. Supp.3d 319, \n327 (E.D. Pa. 2023).  That is because, “[e]ven if the plaintiff has suffered a previous injury due \nto the defendant’s conduct, . . . an injunction is ‘unavailable absent a showing of irreparable \ninjury, a requirement that cannot be met where there is no showing of any real or immediate \nthreat that the plaintiff will be wronged again[.]’”  ZF Meritor, 696 F.3d at 301 (quoting Lyons, \n461 U.S. at 111).  Thus, when suing to enjoin unlawful conduct, a plaintiff can meet his or her \nburden by, for example, proving the defendant’s “intent to engage in the challenged conduct \nagain,” Falcone v. Dickstein, 92 F.4th 193, 204 (3d Cir. 2024), or their own “intention to return \nto a defendant’s business ‘but for the discrimination [they] would experience there,’” Burns, 675 \nF. Supp.3d at 550 n.10 (quoting Yucis v. Sears Outlet Stores, LLC, 813 F. App’x 780, 787 (3d \nCir. 2020) (not precedential)).  “[A]bsent a sufficient likelihood that he will again be wronged in \na similar way,” however, a plaintiff cannot establish any special “entitle[ment] to an \ninjunction . . . and a federal court may not entertain a claim by any or all citizens who no more \nthan assert that certain practices” are unlawful.  Lyons, 461 U.S. at 111. \nSeaWorld argues that no Plaintiff intends to return to Sesame Place, so none can \ndemonstrate that they are likely to suffer a sufficiently imminent injury as necessary to establish \nstanding for injunctive relief.  Indeed, it is undisputed that the Burns, Fleming, Miles, Morales, \nRomero, Valette, and Willie families have no intention of returning to the park.4  That leaves the \n \n4 Thus, although they served as the hook for Plaintiffs’ standing to seek injunctive relief at previous stages in this \nlitigation, the Willie family no longer are the Plaintiffs on which standing to seek injunctive relief is premised. \n \n14 \n \n\nValdez family, the only family on whom Plaintiffs rely to establish standing for injunctive relief.  \nKatie Valdez originally testified that she and her family had no plans to return to Sesame Place, \nbut she filed a subsequent affidavit indicating that they intended to visit the park for the 2024 \nEaster holiday.  In general, “a single, non-conclusory affidavit or witness’s testimony, when \nbased on personal knowledge and directed at a material issue, is sufficient to defeat summary \njudgment.”  Lupyan v. Corinthian Colls. Inc., 761 F.3d 314, 230 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Kirleis \nv. Dickie, McCamey & Chilcote, P.C., 560 F.3d 156, 161-63 (3d Cir. 2009)).  At the same time, \nhowever, “a party may not create a material issue of fact to defeat summary judgment by filing \nan affidavit disputing his or her own sworn testimony without demonstrating a plausible \nexplanation for the conflict.”  Jiminez v. All Am. Rathskeller, Inc., 503 F.3d 247, 251 (3d Cir. \n2007) (quoting Baer v. Chase, 392 F.3d 609, 624 (3d Cir. 2004)).   \nThis “sham affidavit doctrine” is premised on the idea that the later-filed document \n“indicates only that the affiant cannot maintain a consistent story or is willing to offer a \nstatement solely for the purpose of defeating summary judgment.”  Id. at 253.  Thus, “[a] sham \naffidavit cannot raise a genuine issue of fact because it is merely a variance from earlier \ndeposition testimony, and therefore no reasonable jury could rely on it to find for the \nnonmovant.”  Id.   \nAccordingly, while Valdez’s non-conclusory affidavit ordinarily would be sufficient at \nthe summary judgment stage to establish her family’s intent to return to Sesame Place, Lupyan, \n761 F.3d at 230 (citation omitted), absent “a plausible explanation for the conflict,” it must be \ndisregarded in this respect, Jiminez, 503 F.3d at 251.  That explanation can come from \n“‘independent evidence in the record to bolster’” the affidavit, or from “a ‘satisfactory \nexplanation’ for the conflict between the prior deposition and the affidavit.”  Id. at 254 (first \n15 \n \n\nquoting Baer, 392 F.3d at 625; and then quoting Hackman v. Valley Fair, 932 F.3d 239, 241 (3d \nCir. 1991)). \nHere, the record can explain Valdez’s statements in her affidavit, so it is competent \nevidence of her intent to return to Sesame Place.  In her deposition, Valdez testified that she and \nher kids “really love the park.  We enjoy the rides.  Everything is . . . for the kids, catered to \nthem . . . .”  Even though she “was still very much upset” and “outraged,” she nonetheless \nconceded that “[t]he park is amazing,” and her children “love the characters.”  Valdez thus has \nconsistently maintained that, despite the “emotional trauma” of what transpired at the parade, \nwhich has led her to avoid those events on subsequent visits, she has positive feelings towards \nSesame Place in general.  In light of this consistent attitude, it should not be surprising, that, even \nthough she had no specific plans to do so when deposed, when presented with guest passes to the \npark multiple times in 2023 as her affidavit describes, Valdez jumped at the opportunity to bring \nher family again.  Nor should it surprise that she plans to purchase tickets to enter the park on \nanother occasion.  The high regard Valdez has for Sesame Place’s entertainment value for her \nfamily thus harmonizes her testimony and her subsequent affidavit.  Jiminez, 503 F.3d at 251.   \nBecause her affidavit therefore is not a sham, it can be credited and thus defeats \nSeaWorld’s Motion for Summary Judgment on this ground.  Lupyan, 761 F.3d at 230.  \nTherefore, based on Valdez’s affidavit establishing her intent to return to Sesame Place, \nPlaintiffs continue to have standing to seek injunctive relief. \nB.  Section 1981 and Negligence Per Se5 \nSection 1981 guarantees that “[a]ll persons within the jurisdiction of the United States \n \n5 Plaintiffs’ negligence per se claims rise and fall with their claims under Section 1981.  Under Pennsylvania law, \n“[t]he concept of ‘negligence per se’ establishes the elements of duty and breach of duty where an individual \nviolates an applicable statute, ordinance, or regulation designed to prevent a public harm.”  Maham v. Am-Gard, \nInc., 841 A.2d 1052, 1058 (Pa. Super. 2003) (citing J.E.J. v. Tri-Cnty. Big Brothers/Big Sisters, 692 A.2d 582, 585 \n(Pa. Super. 1997)).  Thus, violation of a statute is a necessary, but not sufficient condition to sustain a cause of \n16 \n \n\nshall have the same right . . . to make and enforce contracts . . . .”  42 U.S.C. § 1981(a).  The \nstatute defines “mak[ing] and enforc[ing] contracts” to include “the making, performance, \nmodification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, \nand conditions of the contractual relationship.”  Id. § 1981(b).  “Any claim brought under \n§ 1981, therefore, must initially identify an impaired ‘contractual relationship,’ . . . under which \nthe plaintiff has rights.”  Domino’s Pizza, Inc. v. McDonald, 546 U.S. 470, 476 (2006).  \nAdditionally, the Supreme Court has clarified that “a plaintiff must . . . ultimately prove that, but \nfor race, it would not have suffered the loss of a legally protected right.”  Comcast Corp. v. Nat’l \nAss’n of Afr. Am.-Owned Media, 140 S. Ct. 1009, 1019 (2020).  At the summary judgment stage, \nhowever, the non-moving party can create a triable issue “by showing merely that [his or] her \nrace was the ‘likely reason for the’” discrimination.  Onely v. Redner’s Markets, Inc., 2023 WL \n6626120, at *5 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 11, 2023) (quoting Carvalho-Grevious v. Del. State Univ., 851 \nF.3d 249, 259 (3d Cir. 2017)). \ni. The Impaired Contractual Right \nThe first issue in evaluating Plaintiffs’ Section 1981 claims, then, is what, if any, \ncontractual right SeaWorld abridged.  SeaWorld argues that summary judgment must be granted \nwith respect to all of Plaintiffs’ Section 1981 claims because the “right not to be discriminated \nagainst on the basis of race at Sesame Place” is not a right guaranteed by the contract between \nthe park and Plaintiffs embodied in the tickets that they purchased and instead is protected by \nTitle II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000a et seq.  But, as was discussed at \n \naction for negligence per se.  See Sodders v. Fry, 32 A.3d 882, 887 (Pa. Commw. 2011) (“[N]ot every violation of a \nstatute constitutes negligence per se . . . .”); McCloud v. McLaughlin, 837 A.2d 541, 545 (Pa. Super. 2003) (“There \ncan be no finding of negligence per se without there first being a statute that regulates conduct and an actual \nviolation of that statute.”).  As Plaintiffs maintain only one claim for violation of a statute designed to prevent a \npublic harm—Section 1981, see Hassett v. Dafoe, 74 A.3d 202, 216 (Pa. Super. 2013)—where summary judgment is \nproper on that claim, it will be granted on the corresponding negligence per se claim as well.  \n \n17 \n \n\nlength at the motion-to-dismiss stage, it is well established that the right Plaintiffs seek to \nvindicate is grounded in contract and thus is covered by Section 1981.  SeaWorld employees \nwere accused of “repeatedly ignoring minority children while engaging with similarly situated \nWhite children.”  Burns, 675 F. Supp.3d at 543.  By allegedly denying a privilege of being at \nSesame Place to them that was “freely given to White patrons . . . SeaWorld performs its \ncontracts with its White and minority patrons on different terms,” which, if proven, would be a \nviolation of Section 1981.  Id. at 541, 543; cf. Valle v. Stengel, 176 F.2d 697, 699, 703-04 (3d \nCir. 1949).  This conclusion is law of the case and will not be revisited here.  In re Cont’l \nAirlines, Inc., 279 F.3d 226, 232-33 (3d Cir. 2002) (citing Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating \nCorp., 486 U.S. 800, 816 (1988)).  True enough, Section 1981 does not vindicate claims by those \nwho “were merely disappointed with the quality of the interactive events” in which they \nparticipated.  Burns, 675 F. Supp.3d at 542; see Mayer v. Belichick, 605 F.3d 223, 236 (3d Cir. \n2010).  But Section 1981 does not allow entities to maintain a “policy deliberately adopted . . . to \noffer its services under different terms dependent on race” either.  Hall v. Pa. State Police, 570 \nF.2d 86, 92 (3d Cir. 1978).   \nThus, where a contractual benefit—here, “interactions with the performers”—is “refused \nto minority patrons, but freely given to White patrons,” Burns, 675 F. Supp.3d at 541, or \n“offer[ed]” to those patrons “under different terms,” Hall, 570 F.2d at 92, a contractual right has \nbeen impaired, and Section 1981 is implicated.  Put differently, the contractual right Plaintiffs \nsue to vindicate here is not to a specific interaction with a costumed character.  Instead, Section \n1981 protects the right of Sesame Place guests to the same interactions as would be offered to \nsimilarly situated guests of a different race.   \nii. Proving SeaWorld’s Impairment of the Right \nThe next issue is how to prove the impairment of that right.  Here, the parties employ the \n18 \n \n\nburden-shifting framework for proving intentional discrimination via indirect evidence from \nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 522 U.S. 792 (1983).6  Under that framework, each Plaintiff \nbears the burden of establishing the prima facie case of racial discrimination, which in this \ncontext requires they show that: (1) they are racial minorities (which is not contested here); \n(2) SeaWorld intentionally discriminated against them, Gen. Bldg. Contractors Ass’n, Inc. \nv. Pennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 391 (1982); and, (3) the “discrimination concerned one or more \nof the activities enumerated in the statute (i.e. the making and enforcing a contract),” Farmer \nv. Am. Home Med. Equip. and Servs., Inc., 2018 WL 878367, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 14, 2018) \n(italicization added) (quoting McCrea v. Saks, Inc., 2000 WL 1912726, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 22, \n2000)). \nPlaintiffs can prove intentional discrimination by pointing to “comparator” evidence, i.e., \nsimilarly situated White guests who were treated more favorably.  See Golod v. Bank of Am. \nCorp., 403 F. App’x 699, 702 n.2 (3d Cir. 2010) (not precedential) (citing Swierkiewicz \nv. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 511-12 (2002)); cf. Abdul-Latif v. County of Lancaster, 990 \nF. Supp.2d 517, 525-26 (E.D. Pa. 2014).  In this context, that means Plaintiffs can establish their \nclaim by pointing to evidence that other similarly situated guests of different races received \ninteractions with costumed characters while they did not.  Whether two individuals are similarly \nsituated is generally a question of fact for a jury unless “no reasonable jury could find that the \n \n6 As discussed supra, it is now well established that Plaintiffs must establish a but-for causal relationship between \ntheir races and the discrimination in contracting that they allegedly suffered.  Comcast, 140 S. Ct. at 1019.  The \nThird Circuit has accepted that McDonnell Douglas nonetheless can be applied to Section 1981 cases in the \nemployment discrimination context.  Williams v. Tech Mahindra (Ams.) Inc., 70 F.4th 646, 651-52 (3d Cir. 2023).  \nDistrict courts in this circuit, consistent with pre-Comcast precedent, have continued to do so in non-employment \ncases.  E.g., Calhoun v. TJM Trevose, LLC, 2023 WL 5208853, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 14, 2023) (citing Anderson \nv. Wachovia Mortg. Corp., 621 F.3d 261, 267-68 (3d Cir. 2010)).  Other circuit courts have done the same.  Doe \nv. Brown Univ., 43 F.4th 195, 208 n.9 (1st Cir. 2022).  The Court will follow these cases’ and the parties’ lead and \ndo the same here. \n \n19 \n \n\nindividuals identified by the plaintiffs” fit the bill.  Hampshire v. Bard, 793 F. App’x 75, 80 (3d \nCir. 2019) (not precedential) (citing McDonald v. Village of Winnetka, 371 F.3d 992, 1002 (7th \nCir. 2004)). \nIf the plaintiff establishes the prima facie case, the burden shifts to “the defendant to \narticulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for” its actions.  Jones v. Sch. Dist. of Phila., \n198 F.3d 403, 412 (3d Cir. 1999).  If the defendant successfully does so, the burden shifts back \nto the plaintiff to put on evidence from which “a factfinder reasonably [can] infer that each of the \n[defendant’s] proffered non-discriminatory reasons . . . was either a post hoc fabrication or \notherwise did not actually motivate the” discriminatory act.  Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 764 \n(3d Cir. 1994).  The plaintiff may not rebut that explanation “simply by arguing that the \nfactfinder need not believe” it, but “adduc[ing] evidence directly contradicting the defendant’s \nproffered legitimate explanations” is not necessary either.  Id.  Thus, “the non-moving plaintiff \nmust demonstrate such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or \ncontradictions in the employer’s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable \nfactfinder could rationally find them ‘unworthy of credence,’ . . . and hence infer ‘that the \nemployer did not act for [the asserted] non-discriminatory reasons.’”  Id. at 765 (citations \nomitted). \niii. Evaluating Plaintiffs’ Claims \na.  The Fleming, Miles, and Romero Families \nWith respect to the Fleming, Miles, and Romero families, SeaWorld presses essentially \nthe same argument: to wit, that summary judgment is proper because these families’ children \nwere not refused interactions with costumed characters at all, let alone in contexts where \nsimilarly situated guests of other races received such interactions, so they were not deprived of \nany contractual right that Section 1981 protects and cannot establish their prima facie case. \n20 \n \n\n1.  The Fleming Family \nA rational factfinder could conclude that the Fleming family has established their prima \nfacie case of discrimination at the first step in the McDonnell Douglas framework.  As Nathan \nFleming described it, Telly Monster appeared to be walking right towards O.F., but at the last \nsecond, the character “veered” to the left and brushed the hand of the Asian boy right next to her.  \nAfter that, Telly Monster, per Fleming, “brushed [her] off and just kept walking.”  Given that \nTelly Monster did not approach the crowd in a straight line, a rational factfinder could infer that \nthe employee inside saw O.F. and intentionally interacted with another guest because of their \nrespective races.  See Pryor v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n, 288 F.3d 548, 562 (3d Cir. 2002).  \nOn top of that, the two children were quite close to each other, and the interaction between Telly \nMonster and the Asian boy was quite brief, so offering the same to O.F. would not have \njeopardized the smooth operation of the parade, so a rational factfinder could consider the two \nchildren similarly situated.  Thus, it is in genuine dispute whether O.F.’s race was the “likely \nreason” for the refusal of the Sesame Place employee performing as Telly Monster to interact \nwith her, thus establishing the prima facie case of discrimination.  Carvalho-Grevious, 851 F.3d \nat 253.   \nAt the next step in the McDonnell Douglas framework, SeaWorld offers no legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory explanation for its employee’s conduct.  Therefore, it is not entitled to \nsummary judgment on the Flemings’ Section 1981 claims.  Jones, 198 F.3d at 412. \n2.  The Miles Family \nMuch of the same can be said about the incident that gave rise to the Miles family’s suit.  \nAs discussed above, Rosita hugged a White girl who was standing right next to M.C. and then \nproceeded to walk past her.  SeaWorld argues that Rosita in fact waved at M.C. and her sister  \nand, given that Lashonda Miles conceded in her deposition that a wave would count as an \n21 \n \n\ninteraction, this vitiates the family’s Section 1981 claim.  But a rational factfinder could \nconclude: (1) that M.C. and her sister did not in fact receive such an interaction and instead were, \nas Miles testified, “shoo[ed]” away, i.e., were refused an interaction; and, (2) when considered in \nthe context of the hug that Rosita gave a nearby White girl, that race is a likely explanation for \nthe employee’s conduct.  See Carvalho-Grevious, 851 F.3d at 253.  A rational factfinder could \nconclude that M.C. and this White girl were similarly situated, so, like the Fleming family, the \nMiles family has established the prima facie case of discrimination.  Hampshire, 793 F. App’x at \n80. \nThat said, unlike in the Flemings’ case, SeaWorld has offered a “legitimate \nnondiscriminatory” explanation for its employee’s conduct—the employee in the Rosita costume \nwas performing in a mini-parade, meaning that it was imperative that he keep moving after \nhugging the White girl next to M.C., so he only waved to subsequent guests.  Jones, 198 F.3d at \n412.  Therefore, the third step in the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework is \nimplicated here.  Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 764.   \nBut Plaintiffs offer no reason to cast doubt on SeaWorld’s explanation for what \nhappened.  Therefore, any argument by Plaintiffs against summary judgment is waived with \nrespect to Miles’s and M.C.’s Section 1981 claims.  See Dempsey v. Del. Dep’t of Pub. Safety, \n359 F. App’x 347, 349 (3d Cir. 2009) (not precedential) (citing Adair v. Charter County of \nWayne, 452 F.3d 482, 491 (6th Cir. 2006)) (“Dempsey failed to argue before the District Court \nthat DPS’s articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for her discipline was a pretext for \ndiscrimination and has therefore waived that argument on appeal.”); cf. Collins v. Kimberly-\nClark Pa., LLC, 247 F. Supp.3d 571, 604 (E.D. Pa. 2017) (“[B]ecause Plaintiff’s sole pretext \nargument concerns only her termination and she makes no attempt to establish pretext or ‘but \n22 \n \n\nfor’ causation with respect to any prior adverse action, she has waived any claim of retaliation \nconcerning adverse actions occurring prior to her termination.”).  SeaWorld’s Motion therefore \nwill be granted with respect to the Miles family’s claim under Section 1981. \n3.  The Romero Family \nWith respect to the Romero family, given the circumstances of their interaction with \ncostumed characters at the parade they attended, no rational factfinder could conclude that E.C. \nwas denied interactions that were given to similarly situated guests of different races.  Thus, \nthrough neither alleged incident of racial discrimination can the Romero family establish their \nprima facie case, so summary judgment will also be granted on their Section 1981 claims. \nFirst, as Yoselis Romero conceded in her deposition, the employee performing as Cookie \nMonster extended a hand towards E.C. and gave her “[a] quick tap in the air.”  While Cookie \nMonster did hug a White boy several feet away, this was consistent with Sesame Place training \nto guide a guest who has strayed beyond the yellow safety line back to where they are supposed \nto be standing.  That boy thus was not similarly situated to E.C., and the hug he received cannot \nbe considered a contractual benefit that was doled out on the basis of race.7  Golod, 403 F. App’x \nat 702 n.2 (citation omitted).  Second, Romero conceded in her deposition that Zoe gave E.C. a \n“thumbs up,” so that character did not refuse to interact with her at all.  Nor is there any evidence \nfrom which a rational jury could conclude that Zoe’s less-than-fulsome interaction with E.C. was \nreally a refusal to engage with her.  Because it is undisputed that E.C.’s contractual rights were \nnot impaired, the Romero family cannot establish the prima facie case of discrimination, and \n \n7 Relatedly, to the extent that the Romero family’s claim is predicated on Sesame Place employees’ yelling at E.C. \nfor crossing that same line, SeaWorld has proffered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for that conduct in that \nall guests, regardless of race, are required to stay behind the line.  Because Plaintiffs offer no reason to cast doubt on \nthat explanation, this incident cannot serve as a basis for denying SeaWorld’s Motion for Summary Judgment either. \n \n23 \n \n\nSeaWorld is entitled to summary judgment.8 \nb.  The Burns, Morales, Valdez, and Willie Families \nInstead of arguing that the Burns, Morales, Valdez, and Willie families have failed to \nestablish their prima facie case, SeaWorld focuses on the second step in the McDonnell Douglas \nframework, arguing that summary judgment is proper because the Sesame Place employees who \ninteracted with their children could not see them, and Plaintiffs have failed to cast doubt on this \n“legitimate nondiscriminatory” explanation for what happened.  Jones, 198 F.3d at 412.  But \nwhat the costumed character performers could see is in genuine dispute, so, in most instances, \nthis is not a valid basis for summary judgment as to these families. \n1.  The Burns Family \nWith respect to the Burns family,9 SeaWorld argues that, in that the only thing that Abby \nCadabby’s escort told him was that the line for a picture was now closed, they have offered a \nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for their employees’ conduct.  Similarly, they argue that the \nemployees performing as Telly Monster and Ernie could not see K.B. and therefore did not \nintentionally ignore her.   \nSummary judgment is proper regarding the Burns family’s interactions with Abby \nCadabby and her escort because Plaintiffs do not point to any reason to cast doubt on the \nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for her conduct that SeaWorld has proffered.  Fuentes, 32 \n \n8 Plaintiffs’ briefing also references interactions with an employee performing as a “Vampire” character, but \nRomero confirmed in her deposition that she is not suing over any interactions with that character.   \n \n9 In Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint, it was alleged that SeaWorld discriminated against Burns and K.B. \nwhen costumed characters performing as the Sesame Street characters Elmo, Ernie, Telly Monster, and Abby \nCadabby ignored K.B. at meet-and-greets because of their race.  Quinton Burns’s concessions in his deposition, \nhowever, have narrowed this claim substantially.  He conceded that he had confused two Sesame Street characters \nand no Sesame Place employee dressed as Elmo had discriminated against K.B.  Moreover, Burns clarified that he is \nalleging that, at a meet-and-greet, the Sesame Place employee accompanying Abby Cadabby—not the costumed \ncharacter themselves—discriminated against his child. \n \n24 \n \n\nF.3d at 764.  In his deposition, Burns testified that he saw another White family remain in the \nline to meet Abby Cadabby after he was told that the line was closed.  He did not, however, see \nwhether the family was able to interact with Abby Cadabby or if, instead, they were told, just as \nhe was, that the line was closed.  Moreover, by Burns’s own admission, this incident took place \n“just before the parade was ready to start,” which is typically when meet-and-greets get cut off \nfor costumed characters to perform in the parade.  If there was any evidence in the record that \ntended to show that this second family in fact interacted with Abby Cadabby, that would cast \ndoubt on SeaWorld’s proffered nondiscriminatory explanation for the escort’s conduct.  Because \nthere is no such evidence, however, and Plaintiffs do not attempt to rebut these legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory explanations for the incident, Dempsey, 359 F. App’x at 349, SeaWorld is \nentitled to summary judgment on this portion of Burns’s Section 1981 claim. \nThe evidence with respect to K.B.’s interactions with Telly Monster and Ernie at the \nparade, however, is more mixed, so the remainder of the Burns family’s claim must go to a jury.  \nThe employee who was performing as Telly Monster testified that he could not see K.B.  \nConsistent with that statement, Schweizer testified that, based on his experience performing as \nthe character, whoever is inside the Ernie costume sees out of its mouth, which was not pointed \ntowards K.B. in the video of the interaction with Ernie that the Burns family recorded.  But in his \ndeposition, Burns pointed out that K.B. was standing right next to another park guest whom \nErnie and Telly Monster high-fived.  A rational factfinder could conclude, based on Burns’s \ntestimony, that these employees in fact could see K.B. if they were able to high-five the person \ndirectly next to her.  Therefore, with respect to K.B.’s interactions with Telly Monster and Ernie, \nPlaintiffs have cast sufficient doubt on SeaWorld’s proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory \nexplanation for its employee’s conduct such that summary judgment is improper. \n25 \n \n\n2.  The Morales Family \nSeaWorld’s argument in favor of summary judgment as to the Morales family is similar \nand will be rejected for the same reason.  It points to testimony from the employee who was \nperforming as Big Bird that the part of the costume out of which he could see—Big Bird’s tie—\nwas pointing away from N.M., so she never entered his field of vision.  Again, this is a \nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory explanation for the employee’s conduct that rebuts Morales’s \nprima facie case at McDonnell Douglas’s second step.  Jones, 198 F.3d at 412. \nBut at the final step in the McDonnell Douglas framework, as with the Burns family, a \nrational factfinder could credit Plaintiffs’ counter to that explanation.  Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 764.  \nPer Ingrid Morales, Big Bird was “extremely close to” N.M. but interacted with another guest \nright next to her.  The Sesame Place employees performing as Grover and Baby Bear acted in a \nsimilar manner.  From the close proximity between N.M. and the children with whom these \ncostumed characters did interact with, a rational factfinder could conclude that the employees \ninside in fact could see N.M.  Therefore, SeaWorld is not entitled to summary judgment on the \nMorales family’s Section 1981 claims. \n3.  The Valdez Family \nIn the same vein, a rational jury could conclude that the Sesame Place employee \nperforming as Abby Cadabby in fact could see M.L., who was lined up behind the children \nwhom she hugged, so summary judgment is improper as to the Valdez family.  Although the \nemployee’s testimony that she did not see M.L. supplies SeaWorld with a legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory explanation for her conduct and thus rebuts the prima facie case at the second \nstep in the McDonnell Douglas framework, Jones, 198 F.3d at 412, Katie Valdez’s testimony \ncasts sufficient doubt on it at its final step, so a jury should decide this issue.  In her deposition, \nValdez placed M.L. right next to the child with whom Abby Cadabby interacted.  Moreover, \n26 \n \n\nanother former Entertainment Department employee testified that it was usually fairly easy to see \nout of the Abby Cadabby costume’s mouth.  Taken together, this evidence could provide a jury \nwith a reasonable basis to cast doubt on SeaWorld’s proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory \nreason for its employee’s conduct, Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 764, so summary judgment will be denied \nas to the Valdez family’s Section 1981 claim. \n4.  The Willie Family \nNext is the Willie family, who allege racial discrimination in an interaction with the \ncostumed character performing as Rosita while walking through the park, during a meet-and-\ngreet with the same character, and in access to dining options at Sesame Place.   \nSeaWorld appears to concede that the Willies have established their prima facie case of \ndiscrimination with respect to their first interaction with Rosita, offering two nondiscriminatory \nexplanations for what happened.  Jones, 198 F.3d at 412.  First, it argues that summary judgment \nis proper because the person who was in the Rosita costume could not see L.W. when she ran up \nto her, because the costume blocks everything below the eyeline.  Second, it cites testimony by \nthe employee in the Rosita costume that the White family with whom she interacted was \nstanding at a mural where she often takes photographs with guests.  Plaintiffs are correct that, \nconsistent with Willie’s testimony, a rational jury could conclude that the Sesame Place \nemployee in the Rosita costume in fact could see L.W., who “ran towards” Rosita from some \ndistance and might not have been below the costume’s eyeline the entire time.  They thus \nsufficiently have called into question the first of the park’s two proffered explanations for \nRosita’s conduct.  Fuentes, however, is clear that “each . . . proffered non-discriminatory \nreason[]” must be successfully challenged at the final stage in the McDonnell Douglas \nframework if summary judgment is to be denied.  32 F.3d at 764.  In that Plaintiffs have failed to \ncast doubt on SeaWorld’s second nondiscriminatory explanation for what happened to L.W., \n27 \n \n\nPlaintiffs have waived any argument against it.  Dempsey, 359 F. App’x at 349.  Therefore, \nSeaWorld is entitled to summary judgment on this portion of the Willie family’s claim. \nThe next incident that forms the basis for the Willies’ Section 1981 claim took place at a \nsubsequent meet-and-greet.  According to her testimony, Lauren Willie and her family lined up \nfor the meet-and-greet immediately behind a White family, but the Sesame Place employee \nescorting Rosita told them that no more photographs would be taken because the costumed \ncharacter had to get ready for an upcoming parade.  Willie believes that the escort recognized \nL.W. and her family from the previous incident.  Like the Burns family’s case, SeaWorld has \nproffered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory explanation for this conduct: the line for the meet-and-\ngreet was closed because Rosita needed to get ready for an upcoming parade, so the burden shifts \nback to Plaintiffs at the third step in the McDonnell Douglas framework.10  Jones, 198 F.3d at \n412.  To do so, they argue that, even if it is generally the case that meet-and-greets need to be cut \noff so a costumed character can participate in a parade, a rational factfinder could conclude that \nis not what happened here because, per Willie’s testimony, the incident took place an hour and a \nhalf before the next parade, i.e., half an hour before the employee playing Rosita generally would \nhave to get ready.  This would be contrary to the park’s practice as established by the record \nhere, so a rational factfinder could choose not to lend it credence.  Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 764.  \nTherefore, SeaWorld is not entitled to summary judgment on this portion of the Willies’ Section \n1981 claim.11 \n \n10 SeaWorld also points out that meet-and-greets are ended after a set period of time for the costumed characters’ \nsafety.  While true, SeaWorld does not cite any portion of the record that indicates that this was the case with respect \nto the Willies’ interaction with Rosita in particular, so this fact cannot serve as a race-neutral explanation for the \nemployees’ conduct in this instance. \n \n11 In her deposition, Lauren Willie also testified that her family appeared to receive food that they had ordered long \nafter other White guests received them.  SeaWorld did not challenge this claim in its Motion for Summary \nJudgment. \n \n28 \n \n\nc.  The Valette Family \nSeaWorld argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on the Valette family’s Section \n1981 claims because even if Plaintiffs can establish the prima facie case of discrimination, \nsafety, not intentional racism, led the employee performing as Grover to hug two White children \nnext to D.V.  That employee testified that these children had strayed beyond where they were \nsupposed to be standing.  As in the case of the Romero family, she hugged them and moved them \nback behind the yellow line for their safety.  This testimony is corroborated by park employees’ \ndescriptions of Sesame Place’s policies regulating guest conduct at parades.  Therefore, \nSeaWorld has proffered a nondiscriminatory explanation for its employee’s conduct that \nPlaintiffs must cast doubt on at the third step in the McDonnell Douglas framework.  Id.  And \nhere, as with some other Plaintiffs, no argument at that step can be discerned.  Therefore, any \nsuch argument is waived, and SeaWorld is entitled to summary judgment on the Valette family’s \nSection 1981 claim.  Dempsey, 359 F. App’x at 349. \nIn sum, summary judgment will be granted in part with respect to the Burns family’s \nSection 1981 claim: only Burns’s allegations relating to discrimination by the costumed \ncharacter employees performing as Telly Monster and Ernie at a parade will go to trial.  \nSummary judgment similarly will be granted only in part on the Willie family’s claims: only \ntheir allegations relating to food service and the incident at a meet-and-greet involving the \nemployee escorting the costumed character Rosita will be presented to a jury.  Summary \njudgment will be granted in full on the Miles, Romero, and Valette families’ Section 1981 \nclaims.  Finally, summary judgment will be denied on the Fleming, Morales, and Valdez \nfamilies’ Section 1981 claims. \nC.  Negligent Supervision \nPlaintiffs’ claims against SeaWorld for negligent supervision need not be analyzed on a \n29 \n \n\nfamily-by-family basis because each fails for the same reason: no rational factfinder could \nconclude on this record that any Sesame Place employee was acting outside the scope of their \nemployment when any alleged racial discrimination took place. \nCritical to any negligent supervision claim is proof that the perpetrators of the intentional \nharm were “acting outside the scope of [their] employment.”  Belmont v. MB Inv. Partners, Inc., \n708 F.3d 470, 488 (3d Cir. 2013) (citing Dempsey v. Walso Bureau, Inc., 246 A.2d 418, 420 \n(1968); Heller v. Patwil Homes, Inc., 713 A.2d 105, 107-08 (Pa. Super. 1998)).  In turn, \nPennsylvania courts follow the Restatement of Agency to define the scope of one’s employment, \nMcGuire ex rel. Neidig v. City of Pittsburgh, 285 A.3d 887, 892 (Pa. 2022); Justice v. Lombardo, \n208 A.3d 1057, 1067 (Pa. 2019), which bounds that scope by examining whether the at-issue \nconduct: (1) “is of the kind he is employed to perform;” (2) “occurs substantially within the \nauthorized time and space limits;” and, (3) “is actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the \nmaster.”  McGuire, 285 A.3d at 892 (citing Restatement (Second) of Agency § 228 (Am. L. Inst. \n1958)). \nUnder this test, “even . . . intentional or criminal acts committed by the servant” can fall \nwithin the scope of one’s employment.  Fitzgerald v. McCutcheon, 410 A.2d 1270, 1271 (Pa. \nSuper. 1979) (citations omitted).  That includes intentional acts of discrimination.  See Kemether \nv. Pa. Interscholastic Athletic Ass’n, Inc., 15 F. Supp.2d 740, 748 (E.D. Pa. 1998); see also \nBurlington Indus. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 757 (1998) (citation omitted) (“There are instances, \nof course, where a supervisor engages in unlawful discrimination with the purpose, mistaken or \notherwise, to serve the employer.”).  “[W]hether a particular act of an employee is within the \nscope of his employment is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury” unless “neither the facts nor \nthe inferences to be drawn from them are in dispute.”  Justice, 208 A.3d at 1068. \n30 \n \n\nHere, Plaintiffs make only conclusory arguments to defend their position that the alleged \nracial discrimination in this case took place outside of the costumed characters’ scope of \nemployment.  These “[d]enials in the form of legal conclusions, unsupported by documentation \nof specific facts, are insufficient to create issues of material fact that would preclude summary \njudgment.”  SEC v. Bonastia, 614 F.2d 908, 914 (3d Cir. 1980) (citations omitted).  On the first \nelement of the Restatement’s test, Plaintiffs simply assert that “a dispute of material fact exists as \nto whether the discriminatory conduct . . . was of a kind and nature Defendants did not expect \nthem to perform” without identifying what that dispute is.  And their argument on the third \nelement, again bereft of citations to the record or caselaw, appears to proceed from the premise \nthat racial discrimination can never be motivated even in part by a motivation to serve one’s \nemployer.  That position is inconsistent with Pennsylvania law.  Kemether, 15 F. Supp.2d at 748.   \n  Because it is not in genuine dispute that Sesame Place employees were in fact acting \nwithin the scope of their employment when the instances of alleged discrimination took place, \nSeaWorld is entitled to summary judgment on all Plaintiffs’ negligent supervision claims. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, SeaWorld’s Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted in \npart and denied in part.  An appropriate order follows. \n \n              BY THE COURT: \n \n              /s/Wendy Beetlestone, J.  \n               \n              _______________________________   \n              WENDY BEETLESTONE, J. \n31 \n ",

AND \nSEAWORLD PARKS & \nENTERTAINMENT LLC, \nDefendants. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n  Plaintiffs Lauren Willie, L.W., Quinton Burns, K.B., Ingrid Morales, and N.M. sued \nDefendants SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc., and SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC \n(collectively, “SeaWorld”) for violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1981, as well as claims for negligence \nper se premised thereon, arising out of incidents of alleged racial discrimination at Sesame Place \nPhiladelphia (“Sesame Place”), a theme park that Defendants operate.  \nAt the close of evidence of the jury trial in this matter, the parties cross-motioned— \npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a)—for Judgment as a Matter of Law.  The Court \ngranted Defendants’ Motion as it concerned Plaintiffs Lauren Willie and L.W.’s claims regarding \nthe time it took for them to be served food at the park as compared to white people who ordered \nafter them.  It denied the Motions in all other respects.  After deliberations, the jury found for the \nDefendants.  Plaintiffs now renew their Motions for Judgment as a Matter of Law, pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b), and seek a new trial on the Willies’ food claim pursuant \nto Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59. \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB     Document 267     Filed 01/17/25     Page 2 of 8\n  RULE 50(B) MOTION FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW \nA.  Legal Standard \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 permits a party to bring an initial motion for judgment \nas a matter of law during a jury trial on the grounds that no reasonable jury would have legally \nsufficient evidence to find for the opposing party on a given issue.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1).  If \ndenied, the party may renew its motion after trial and include an alternative request for a new \ntrial.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b).  On a renewed motion the trial court may enter judgment as a matter \nof law notwithstanding a jury verdict for the opposing party, but “only if, as a matter of law, the \nrecord is critically deficient of that minimum quantity of evidence from which a jury might \nreasonably afford relief.”  Trabal v. Wells Fargo Armored Serv. Corp., 269 F.3d 243, 249 (3d \nCir. 2001) (citation and quotation omitted).  This is a “sparingly invoked remedy.”  Marra v. \nPhiladelphia Hous. Auth., 497 F.3d 286, 300 (3d Cir. 2007) (citation and quotation omitted).  \nJudgment as a matter of law is proper “only if, viewing the evidence in the light most \nfavorable to the nonmovant and giving it the advantage of every fair and reasonable inference, \nthere is insufficient evidence from which a jury reasonably could find liability.”  LePage’s, Inc. \nv. 3M, 324 F.3d 141, 145-46 (3d Cir. 2003) (citation and quotation omitted).  “The court may not \nweigh evidence, determine the credibility of witnesses or substitute its version of the facts for \nthat of the jury,” but rather may grant a Rule 50 motion only “if upon review of the record it can \nbe said as a matter of law that the verdict is not supported by legally sufficient evidence.”  \nParkway Garage, Inc. v. City of Philadelphia, 5 F.3d 685, 691-92 (3d Cir. 1993), abrogated on \nother grounds by United Artists Theatre Cir., Inc. v. Twp. of Warrington, 316 F.3d 392 (3d Cir. \n2003).  For this reason, “[n]ormally, when the evidence is contradictory, [judgment as a matter of \nlaw] is inappropriate.”  Bonjorno v. Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp., 752 F.2d 802, 811 (3d \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB     Document 267     Filed 01/17/25     Page 3 of 8\nCir. 1984) (citation omitted). \nB.  Discussion \n42 U.S.C. § 1981 guarantees that “[a]ll persons within the jurisdiction of the United \nStates shall have the same right . . . to make and enforce contracts . . . .”  42 U.S.C. § 1981(a).  \nTo succeed on a § 1981 claim, a plaintiff must first “identify an impaired ‘contractual \nrelationship,’ . . . under which the plaintiff has rights,” Domino’s Pizza, Inc. v. McDonald, 546 \nU.S. 470, 476 (2006), and then “prove that, but for race, [the plaintiff] would not have suffered \nthe loss of [that] legally protected right,” Comcast Corp. v. Nat’l Ass’n of Afr. Am.-Owned \nMedia, 589 U.S. 327, 341 (2020). \n  The Court has previously determined that § 1981 “protects the right of Sesame Place \nguests to the same interactions as would be offered to similarly situated guests of a different \nrace,” Burns, 2024 WL 1660514, at *9, and, for the sake of the Motions at hand, Defendants do \nnot dispute that Plaintiffs were guests of the park.  The sole question in dispute here is whether \nthe Plaintiffs—all racial minorities—were denied on account of their race “the same \ninteractions” offered to similarly situated non-minority guests. \nThe answer to the question is found through the burden-shifting framework for proving \nintentional discrimination via indirect evidence set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corporation v. \nGreen, 522 U.S. 792 (1983).  That framework requires each Plaintiff to first establish a prima \nfacie case of racial discrimination, after which the burden of production shifts to SeaWorld “to \narticulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for” the complained-of actions.  Jones v. Sch. \nDist. of Philadelphia, 198 F.3d 403, 410-12 (3d Cir. 1999).  Should SeaWorld carry that burden, \nthe onus then returns to each Plaintiff to put on evidence from which “a factfinder reasonably \n[can] infer that each of [SeaWorld’s] proffered non-discriminatory reasons . . . was either a post \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB     Document 267     Filed 01/17/25     Page 4 of 8\nhoc fabrication or otherwise did not actually motivate the” act in question.  Fuentes v. Perskie, \n32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir. 1994).  Crucially, however, each Plaintiff retains the ultimate burden to \npersuade the jury that intentional racial discrimination occurred; disbelief of SeaWorld’s \nproffered explanations allows, but does not compel, the jury to decide for Plaintiffs.  See \nSheridan v. E.I. Dupont de Nemours & Co., 100 F.3d 1061, 1066-67 (3d Cir. 1996) (en banc). \nEach Plaintiff argues that judgment as a matter of law should be granted in their favor \nbecause, while they presented evidence establishing prima facie cases of racial discrimination, \nSeaWorld failed to produce evidence to suggest any legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for \nthe complained-of actions.  It failed to do so, Plaintiffs contend, because it did not offer any \ndirect evidence about the state of mind of the employees who were in the character suits when \nthe alleged discrimination happened.   \nMore specifically, in the cases of Quinton Burns, K.B., Ingrid Morales, and N.M.—who \nallege that costumed characters intentionally denied them interactions during parades at the park \non the basis of race—Plaintiffs contend that, by failing to elicit testimony from the actors who \nplayed the costumed characters on the days in question, SeaWorld “failed to introduce evidence \nwhich, taken as true, would permit the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason” for \nthe lack of interaction between child and costumed character.  St. Mary’s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, \n509 U.S. 502, 509 (1993) (explaining that “the court must award judgment to the plaintiff as a \nmatter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a)(1)” when a defendant fails to meet its \nburden of production at the second step of the McDonnell Douglas framework and no reasonable \njury could find that plaintiff has not made out its prima facie case).  And in the case of Lauren \nWillie and L.W., the same proposition is stated; because SeaWorld did not offer any direct \nevidence about the state of mind of the character handler who allegedly denied these Plaintiffs a \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB     Document 267     Filed 01/17/25     Page 5 of 8\nmeet-and-greet on the basis of their race, SeaWorld has not met its burden. \nAs an initial matter, Plaintiffs’ arguments are insufficient in that they are not supported \nby any caselaw in contravention of Local Rule of Civil Procedure 7.1(c).  E.D. Pa. R. Civ. P. \n7.1(c) (“Every motion not certified as uncontested, or not governed by Local Civil Rule 26.1(g), \nshall be accompanied by a brief containing a concise statement of the legal contentions and \nauthorities relied upon in support of the motion.”) (emphasis added).  “Courts in this District \nhave consistently held the failure to cite any applicable law is sufficient to deny a motion as \nwithout merit because zeal and advocacy is never an appropriate substitute for case law and \nstatutory authority in dealings with the Court.”  Anthony v. Small Tube Mfg. Corp., 535 F. \nSupp.2d 506, 511 n.8 (E.D. Pa. 2007) (citations and quotations omitted); see also Reynolds v. \nWagner, 128 F.3d 166, 178 (3d Cir. 1997) (“[A]n argument consisting of no more than a \nconclusory assertion . . . will be deemed waived.” (citation omitted)).  Without reason to depart \nfrom it, then, the standard rule prevails: a defendant “satisfies its burden of production by \nintroducing evidence which, taken as true, would permit the conclusion that there was a \nnondiscriminatory reason” for the act in question.  Fuentes 32 F.3d at 763 (citing Hicks, 509 U.S. \nat 508-510).  This burden is “relatively light,” and what type of evidence a defendant offers to \nmeet it is its prerogative.  Id. \nSeaWorld offered evidence sufficient to meet this burden at trial.  In support of its \nargument that the costumed characters could not see the children—and therefore could not have \ndiscriminated against them based on their race—SeaWorld presented physical evidence in the \nform of character heads worn by the costumed characters which heads each juror was permitted \nto try on (in the case of Big Bird—the jurors went on a field trip to Sesame Place during which \neach of them got into the Big Bird costume such that they could see what an actor playing the \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB     Document 267     Filed 01/17/25     Page 6 of 8\ncharacter could see; and, in the case of other characters, were permitted to take with them into \nthe jury room the heads of those characters’ costumes).  SeaWorld also elicited testimony from \nSesame Place employees, including P.J. Schweizer and Regan Keely, regarding the obstructed \nlines of sight and fields of vision caused by the costumed character heads, as well as the \nchoreography, blocking, and safety procedures by which costumed characters must abide during \nparades. \n  SeaWorld likewise met its burden with regard to the claims brought by Lauren Willie and \nL.W., who allege that they were denied a costumed character meet-and-greet by a non-costumed \n‘walk host’ on the basis of race.  Although SeaWorld did not offer testimony from the specific \nwalk host Plaintiffs accuse of discriminating against them, it did offer testimony from other \nemployees that suggested non-discriminatory explanations for cutting off a meet-and-greet, \nincluding policies and procedures imposing time limits for meet-and-greets designed to ensure \nthe health and safety of the costumed character. \n  At the second step of the McDonnell Douglas framework, SeaWorld’s burden of \nproduction is a “light” one; they must simply offer evidence which, “taken as true, would permit \nthe conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason” for the failure of the actors wearing \nthe character’s costume to interact with the Plaintiffs.  Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 763.  Although \nSeaWorld met this burden with circumstantial evidence, as the jury was instructed at trial “[t] he \nlaw makes no distinction in the weight to be given to either direct or circumstantial evidence.” \n“[V]iewing the evidence in the light most favorable to [SeaWorld] and giving it the advantage of \nevery fair and reasonable inference,” the record contains sufficient evidence from which a jury \ncould reasonably find that SeaWorld did not violate § 1981 by discriminating against Plaintiffs \non the basis of race.  LePage’s, Inc. v. 3M, 324 F.3d 141, 145-46 (3d Cir. 2003).  Accordingly, \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB     Document 267     Filed 01/17/25     Page 7 of 8\nPlaintiffs’ Rule 50(b) Motion will be denied. \n  RULE 59 MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL \nPlaintiffs Lauren Willie and L.W. also move for a new trial on their claim related to slow \nfood service at Rosita’s Cocina, a restaurant in the park.  At trial, Lauren Willie testified that she \nand her family—an admittedly “large” party of eleven guests—were made to wait around thirty \nminutes to receive their “several orders” of food, while white guests who “had similar orders” \ngot their food before her family did.  After the close of evidence, SeaWorld moved on the record \nfor judgment as a matter of law on this claim, which the Court granted pursuant to Rule 50(a). \n“The decision to grant or deny a new trial is confided almost entirely to the discretion of \nthe district court,” Blancha v. Raymark Indus., 972 F.2d 507, 512 (3d Cir. 1992), but such \nrequests are disfavored, see, e.g., Williamson v. Consol. Rail Corp., 926 F.2d 1344, 1353 (3d Cir. \n1991).  District courts have recognized that (1) a prejudicial error of law; (2) a verdict against the \nweight of the evidence; or, (3) an excessively high verdict may be ground for a new trial.  Maylie \nv. Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp., 791 F. Supp. 477, 480 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 15, 1992), aff’d, 983 F.2d \n1051 (3d Cir. 1992).  “The Court’s inquiry in evaluating a motion for a new trial on the basis of \ntrial error is twofold.  It must first determine whether an error was made in the course of trial, \nand then it must determine ‘whether that error was so prejudicial that refusal to grant a new trial \nwould be inconsistent with substantial justice.’”  Price v. Trans Union, LLC, 839 F. Supp.2d 785, \n792 (E.D. Pa. 2012) (quoting Farra v. Stanley-Bostitch, Inc., 838 F. Supp. 1021, 1026 (E.D. Pa. \n1993)). \nAlthough Plaintiffs cite to the Rule 59 standard in their brief (and caselaw explaining it), \nthey offer essentially no substantive legal argument to explain why that standard is met in this \ncase.  Their argument consists solely of the following four sentences: \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB     Document 267     Filed 01/17/25     Page 8 of 8\n1.  “Plaintiffs request relief on the food claim decision in the form of a new trial under \nRule 59.” \n \n2.  “At trial, Lauren Willie also described her family being forced to experience extended \nwait times for food that was being served to white families who had been behind the \nWillies in line.” \n \n3.  “Defendants also have no trial record of a material dispute in the Willies’ case of \ndiscrimination in the food line.” \n \n4.  “No cafeteria employees from that day were brought to trial to offer a legitimate, non-\ndiscriminatory reason for the conduct.” \n \nPlaintiffs do not couch their argument in the language of Rule 59 or the many cases in \nthis Circuit that have carefully analyzed that Rule.  Nor do Plaintiffs cite any caselaw whatsoever \nin the body of their argument.  Instead, Plaintiffs submit four disjointed sentences and ask the \nCourt to fill in the blanks.  This is reason enough to deny their Motion as improperly presented.  \nSee E.D. Pa. R. Civ. P. 7.1(c) (“Every motion not certified as uncontested, or not governed by \nLocal Civil Rule 26.1(g), shall be accompanied by a brief containing a concise statement of the \nlegal contentions and authorities relied upon in support of the motion.”) (emphasis added); see \nalso Reynolds, 128 F.3d at 178 (“[A]n argument consisting of no more than a conclusory \nassertion . . . will be deemed waived.” (citation omitted)). \nAn appropriate order follows. \n \nBY THE COURT: \n \n             ___/s/WENDY BEETLESTONE_____________ \nWENDY BEETLESTONE, J.  \n \n8 \n ",

INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants violated their civil rights and are liable for negligence \nbecause certain costumed Sesame Street characters allegedly did not personally interact with them \nduring “Meet and Greets” or Parades at Sesame Place Philadelphia (“Sesame Place”).  Plaintiffs’ \nclaims fail because an admission ticket to Sesame Place provides no contractual right to personal \ninteractions with costumed characters on demand and because Plaintiffs have not alleged that the \ncostumed characters treated them differently than other park guests.  And Plaintiffs’ negligence \nclaim fails because Plaintiffs fail to identify any applicable legal duty and make only conclusory \nallegations  about  breach  without  providing  any  factual  support.    Therefore,  the  entirety  of \nPlaintiffs’ Amended Class Action Complaint (“Amended Complaint”) must be dismissed for \nfailure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  Further, the Amended \nComplaint’s requests for injunctive relief should be dismissed for lack of standing pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) because the named Plaintiffs do not intend to return to \nSesame Place and therefore are not likely to be harmed again in a similar way. \nII.  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs allege that eight (8) putative class representative families purchased tickets to \nSesame Place between December 29, 2021 and July 11, 2022.  Am.

While at Sesame Place, Plaintiffs allege that the putative class representatives \n“attempted to participate in a ‘Meet and Greet’” or “attempted to participate in a Parade” with \ncostumed characters Elmo, Ernie, Telly Monster, Abby Cadabby, Rosita, Big Bird, Grover, Baby \nBear, Zoey, and/or Cookie Monster, but that those characters “refus[ed] to engage with them” \nand/or “ignor[ed] them.”  Id. ¶¶ 40, 41, 49, 50, 58, 59, 67, 68, 76, 77, 85, 86, 94, 95, 103, 104.  \nPlaintiffs further allege, “[u]pon information and belief,” that the characters’ actions “were \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 29-1   Filed 11/02/22   Page 7 of 24\nintentional race discrimination,” because unidentified “SeaWorld[]1 performers readily engaged \nwith numerous similarly situated white customers[.]”  Id. ¶ 43, 52, 61, 70, 79, 88, 97, 106. \nBased on these allegations, Plaintiffs bring a putative class action pleading (1) violation of \n42 U.S.C. § 1981; and (2) negligence.  They seek, inter alia, monetary damages, declaratory relief, \nand multiple forms of injunctive relief.  Am. Compl. ¶ 130.2   \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARDS \nA.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) \nA motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) must be granted \nif the complaint fails to allege “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  \nBell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  To meet the “facial plausibility” standard, \na plaintiff must plead allegations showing “more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted \nunlawfully.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  Rather, the “[f]actual allegations must \nbe enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level[.]”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.  While \nfactual allegations are accepted as true, courts disregard “rote recitals of the elements of a cause \nof action, legal conclusions, and mere conclusory statements.”  James v. City of Wilkes-Barre, 700 \nF.3d 675, 679 (3d Cir. 2012). \nBased on this standard, the Third Circuit has held that “a court reviewing the sufficiency \nof a complaint must take three steps.  First, it must ‘tak[e] note of the elements [the] plaintiff must \nplead to state a claim.’”  Connelly v. Lane Constr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016) (quoting \n                                                 \n1 Sesame Place is owned and operated by SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC.  See id. \n¶ 26.  \n2 Plaintiffs filed their original complaint on July 27, 2022, ECF 1, and filed their Amended \nComplaint on September 28, 2022, ECF 25, prior to Defendants’ October 3, 2022 deadline to \nrespond to the original complaint.  ECF 15.  \n  2 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 29-1   Filed 11/02/22   Page 8 of 24\nIqbal, 556 U.S. at 675).  “Second, it should identify allegations that, ‘because they are no more \nthan conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.’”  Id. (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679).  \n“Finally, ‘[w]hen there are well-pleaded factual allegations, [the] court should assume their \nveracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.’”  Id. \n(quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679) (alterations in original). \nIn ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, courts consider the complaint, exhibits attached \nthereto, matters of public record, and undisputedly authentic documents if the complainant’s \nclaims are based on those documents.  Mayer v. Belichick, 605 F.3d 223, 230 (3d Cir. 2010); \nSchmidt v. Skolas, 770 F.3d 241, 249 (3d Cir. 2014).  In addition, “[d]ocuments that the defendant \nattaches to the motion to dismiss are considered part of the pleadings if they are referred to in the \nplaintiff’s complaint and are central to the claim.”  Santomenno ex rel. John Hancock Tr. v. John \nHancock Life Ins. Co. (U.S.A.), 768 F.3d 284, 291 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting Pryor v. Nat’l Collegiate \nAthletic Ass’n, 288 F.3d 548, 560 (3d Cir. 2002)). \nB.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) \nA claim for which the plaintiff lacks Article III standing is subject to dismissal for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).  Ballentine v. \nUnited States, 486 F.3d 806, 810 (3d Cir. 2007) (“A motion to dismiss for want of standing is … \nproperly brought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), because standing is a jurisdictional matter.”).     \n“It goes without saying that those who seek to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts \nmust satisfy the threshold requirement imposed by Article III of the Constitution by alleging an \nactual case or controversy.”  City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101 (1983) (citations \nomitted).  Article III standing requires, as an “irreducible constitutional minimum,” Lujan v. Defs. \nof Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992), that plaintiffs “(1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly \ntraceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a \n  3 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 29-1   Filed 11/02/22   Page 9 of 24\nfavorable judicial decision.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016), as revised (May \n24, 2016).   \nA Rule 12(b)(1) motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction can be either facial or factual.  \nSchuchardt v. President of the United States, 839 F.3d 336, 343 (3d Cir. 2016).  In a facial attack, \nthe court reviews only the allegations of the complaint and the documents referenced therein, and \nthe same standard of review applies as to motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim.  Id. at 343-\n44.  To survive a motion to dismiss for lack of standing, “the plaintiff must ‘plausibly allege facts \nestablishing each constitutional requirement.’”  Id. at 344 (quoting Hassan v. City of New York, \n804 F.3d 277, 289 (3d Cir. 2015)). \nIn the class context, at least one named plaintiff must have Article III standing.  O’Shea v. \nLittleton, 414 U.S. 488, 494-95 (1974) (“[I]f none of the named plaintiffs purporting to represent \na class establishes the requisite of a case or controversy …, none may seek relief on behalf of \nhimself or any other member of the class.” (citations omitted)).   \nIV.  THE AMENDED COMPLAINT FAILS TO STATE ANY CLAIM ON WHICH \nRELIEF CAN BE GRANTED \nA.  The Amended Complaint Fails to State an Actionable Claim for Violation of \n42 U.S.C. § 1981  \n1.  Elements of the Cause of Action \nTo state a claim under § 1981, “a plaintiff must allege facts in support of the following \nelements: (1) [that plaintiff] is a member of a racial minority; (2) intent to discriminate on the basis \nof  race  by  the  defendant;  and  (3)  discrimination  concerning  one  or  more  of  the  activities \nenumerated in the statute[,] which includes the right to make and enforce contracts.”  Brown v. \nPhilip Morris Inc., 250 F.3d 789, 797 (3d Cir. 2001) (alterations in original) (quotation and citation \nomitted).  “[A] plaintiff must initially plead and ultimately prove that, but for race, it would not \nhave suffered the loss of a legally protected right.”  Comcast Corp. v. Nat’l Ass’n of Afr. Am. \n  4 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 29-1   Filed 11/02/22   Page 10 of 24\nOwned Media, 140 S. Ct. 1009, 1019 (2020).  “[A] § 1981 plaintiff must first show that he was \ndeprived of the protected right and then establish causation—and [] these two steps are analytically \ndistinct.”  Id. at 1018. \nSection 1981 was not “meant to provide an omnibus remedy for all racial injustice.”  \nDomino’s Pizza, Inc. v. McDonald, 546 U.S. 470, 479 (2006); Arguello v. Conoco, Inc., 330 F.3d \n355, 358-59 (5th Cir. 2003) (“Section 1981 does not provide a general cause of action for race \ndiscrimination.”).  Rather, it is specifically limited to situations involving contractual rights.  \nDomino’s Pizza, 546 U.S. at 474 (Section 1981’s “specific function” is to “protect[] the equal right \nof ‘[a]ll persons … to ‘make and enforce contracts without respect to race.”) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1981(a)) (first alteration in original) (emphasis added); Anjelino v. N.Y. Times Co., 200 F.3d 73, \n98 (3d Cir. 1999) (a claim under § 1981 “is limited to issues of racial discrimination in the making \nand enforcing of contracts.”) (emphasis added); Williams v. Carson Concrete Corp., 2021 WL \n1546455, at *5 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 20, 2021) (“Unlike Title VII, which prohibits employers from \ndiscriminating on the basis of a protected characteristic, Section 1981 applies specifically to racial \ndiscrimination in the making and  enforcement  of contracts.”) (citations omitted) (emphasis \nadded).  \n2.  Plaintiffs Fail to Adequately Allege a Contract \nAs a preliminary matter, the Amended Complaint does not identify what constitutes \nPlaintiffs’ alleged “contracts.”  Assuming, however, that the purported “contracts” are the tickets \nfor admission to Sesame Place, admission tickets are generally found to be licenses, not contracts.  \nKennedy Theater Ticket Serv. v. Ticketron, Inc., 342 F. Supp. 922, 925-26 (E.D. Pa. 1972) \n(“Admission tickets have been uniformly defined as revocable licenses …”); Miller v. Pittsburgh \nAthletic Co., 91 Pa. Super. 241, 243 (1927) (“[T]he privilege granted by the delivery of a ticket of \nadmission to a place of public amusement is a revocable license …”).  Thus, Plaintiffs’ § 1981 \n  5 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 29-1   Filed 11/02/22   Page 11 of 24\nclaim can be dismissed for failure to adequately allege the existence of an actual contract.  See, \ne.g., Jimenez v. Wellstar Health Sys., 596 F.3d 1304, 1309 (11th Cir. 2010) (affirming grant of \nmotion to dismiss § 1981 claim based on suspension of medical staff privileges because medical \nstaff privileges do not constitute a contract). \n3.  Plaintiffs Fail to Adequately Allege a Contractual Right to Personal \nInteractions with Costumed Characters During “Meet and Greets” or \nParades \nEven assuming that the Sesame Place admission tickets do constitute “contracts” that could \nserve as the basis for a § 1981 claim, Plaintiffs’ claim still fails.  The Supreme Court has made it \nclear that a § 1981 plaintiff must have “suffered the loss of a legally protected right.”  Comcast \nCorp., 140 S. Ct. at 1019 (emphasis added); Domino’s Pizza, 546 U.S. at 479-80 (“[A] plaintiff \ncannot state a claim under § 1981 unless he has … rights under the existing … contract that he \nwishes to make and enforce.” (quotation omitted)); see also Paschal v. Billy Beru, Inc., 2009 WL \n1099182, at *4 (W.D. Pa. Apr. 23, 2009) (“[A] § 1981 claim for interference with the right to make \nand enforce a contract must involve the actual loss of a contract interest.” (emphasis added) \n(quotation omitted)).  Here, Plaintiffs have not and cannot show that they were deprived of a \n“legally protected right” because the tickets do not provide a contractual right to on-demand \npersonal interactions by Sesame Street costumed characters during “Meet and Greets,” Parades, or \nin any other capacity. 3     \nThe named Plaintiffs purchased various admission tickets or season passes to Sesame \nPlace.  See Declaration of Brittany Kenny, filed herewith, ¶¶ 3-8 and Exs. 1-5, and 7 thereto.  None \n                                                 \n3 The Amended Complaint provides no source of the alleged contractual rights to personal \ninteractions during “Meet and Greets” and Parades other than a reference to admission tickets.  See \ne.g., Am. Compl. ¶ 111 (“Plaintiffs entered into contracts with SeaWorld by way of their ticketed \nadmission to SeaWorld’s amusement park Sesame Place Philadelphia[.]”) (emphasis added).   \n  6 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 29-1   Filed 11/02/22   Page 12 of 24\nof those tickets or season passes includes any language guaranteeing the holder personal, on-\ndemand interactions with costumed characters during “Meet and Greets,” Parades, or in any other \ncapacity during a park visit.  See Kenny Decl. Exs. 1-7 (Copies of Named Plaintiffs’ Tickets to \nSesame Place).4  In fact, some of the tickets, like those purchased by the Burns family, specifically \nstate that “Park may temporarily close due to capacity limitations.  Park hours and content subject \nto change without notice.”  Kenny Decl. Ex. 1 (Burns tickets) (emphasis added).  In other words, \nthe ticket does not even guarantee the holder entry to the park, let alone any particular on-demand \npersonal experience in the park.  See also Kenny Decl. Exs. 2, 3, 4, 7 (Fleming, Morales, Romero, \nL.W. tickets) (“Admission is not guaranteed.”).5 \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs had no legally protected contractual right to on-demand, personal \ninteractions during “Meet and Greets” or Parades, or to any other personal interaction with a \ncostumed character, and their § 1981 claim must fail.  Comcast Corp., 140 S. Ct. at 1019; Paschal, \n2009 WL 1099182 at *4; Lloyd v. Hilton Garden Inn, 2021 WL 2206291, at *6 (E.D. Pa. June 1, \n2021) (plaintiff brought § 1981 claim against hotel based on hotel’s failure to move other hotel \nguests; court granted motion to dismiss because plaintiff had no right to have the other guests \n                                                 \n4 Because the Amended Complaint refers to the named Plaintiffs’ tickets, the Court can \nconsider them in ruling on the motion to dismiss without converting it to a motion for summary \njudgment.  See Santomenno, 768 F.3d at 291; see also Mayer, 605 F.3d at 229, 231 (considering \ncopy of ticket stub attached to motion to dismiss in affirming dismissal). \n5 Sesame Place has been unable to locate tickets for the Miles or Valette families or for \nM.L. (child of Katie Valdez) for the dates in the Amended Complaint.  Kenny Decl. ¶ 9.  This \ncould mean that the families did not purchase tickets on those days or that they purchased physical \ntickets at Sesame Place rather than purchasing their tickets online.  Id.  Plaintiffs allege that the \nMiles family purchased admission tickets on or around June 24, 2022, that the Valette family \npurchased admission tickets on or around June 20, 2022, and that the Valdez family (including \nM.L.) purchased admission tickets on or around December 29, 2021.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 54, 81, 90.  \nThe form language for single day tickets purchased at Sesame Place in December 2021 and June \n2022 does not include any right to personal interactions with costumed characters.  See Kenny \nDecl. ¶ 9 and Ex. 8 thereto. \n  7 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 29-1   Filed 11/02/22   Page 13 of 24\nmoved and thus no part of the “contractual relationship [was] violated when the hotel chose to not \nmove [the other guests] to a different hotel room.”). \nThat Plaintiffs allegedly did not receive the personal attention they allegedly desired may \nhave been disappointing, but case law makes clear that it is not sufficient to state a § 1981 claim.  \nSee Arguello, 330 F.3d at 358-59 (affirming judgment as a matter of law for defendant on § 1981 \nclaim because plaintiff “received all she was entitled to under the retail-sales contract … [and thus] \ncannot demonstrate any loss recoverable under § 1981.”) (citation omitted); Parker v. Sw. Airlines \nCo., 406 F. Supp. 3d 1328, 1336 (M.D. Fla. 2019) (plaintiff upset by her treatment by airline failed \nto establish a prima facie case for § 1981 claim because she did not establish an “actual thwarting \nof her contract rights”; she received what she “contracted for: a safe flight home as booked.”); \nO’Haro v. Bob Evans Farms, Inc., 2010 WL 4942219, at *8 (M.D. Pa. Oct. 4, 2010) (plaintiffs \nfailed to establish § 1981 claim against restaurant; “plaintiffs have shown neither that their creation \nof  a  contractual  relationship  was  blocked  nor  that  an  existing  contractual  relationship  was \nimpaired.  All that plaintiffs have established is poor service.”); Bobbitt by Bobbitt v. Rage Inc., \n19 F. Supp. 2d 512, 518 (W.D.N.C. 1998) (granting motion to dismiss § 1981 claim by customers \nwho received poor service but “were denied neither admittance to the restaurant nor service, nor \nwere they asked to leave at any time.”); Lewis v. J.C. Penney Co., Inc., 948 F. Supp. 367, 371-72 \n(D. Del. 1996) (rejecting argument that § 1981 provides remedy for breach of unstated contract \nthat all who enter a commercial establishment will be treated equally as “such a theory would come \nclose to nullifying the contract requirement of § 1981 altogether, thereby transforming the statute \ninto a general cause of action for race discrimination in all contexts”).   \n  8 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 29-1   Filed 11/02/22   Page 14 of 24\nAs the Third Circuit noted in affirming dismissal based on a plaintiff-NFL-ticket-holder’s \nallegation that his contractual expectation to see an “honest” NFL game was violated by the \nPatriots’ cheating: \n[Plaintiff] possessed either a license or, at best, a contractual right to enter Giants \nStadium and to have a seat from which to watch a professional football game.  In \nthe clear language of the ticket stub, ‘[t]his ticket only grants entry into the stadium \nand a spectator seat for the specific NFL game.’  [Plaintiff] was allowed to enter \nthe stadium and witnessed the ‘specified NFL game[s]’ … He thereby suffered no \ncognizable injury to a legally protected right or interest. \nMayer, 605 F.3d at 233, 236.  Similarly here, Plaintiffs possessed at most a right to admission to \nSesame Place, which they undisputedly received, and the clear language of the ticket/season pass \ndoes not provide a contractual right to any personal contact with a Sesame Street character.  Thus \nno legally protected right was lost.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ § 1981 claim must be dismissed.    \n4.  Plaintiffs Fail to Adequately Allege That Intentional Discrimination Was \nthe But-For Cause of Their Experiences   \nEven if Plaintiffs had a legally protected right to whatever personal interaction they \nallegedly did not receive (which they do not), their § 1981 claim should still be dismissed for \nfailure to adequately allege causation.  Causation is required and “analytically distinct” from the \nalleged deprivation of protected right.  Comcast Corp., 140 S. Ct. at 1018.  To establish causation, \nthe “plaintiff bears the burden of showing that race was a but-for cause of its injury.”  Id. at 1015.  \nPlaintiffs have failed to do so. \nNotably, none of the named Plaintiffs alleges that the costumed characters that allegedly \nrefused to engage with them were actively engaging with similarly situated white children.  \nInstead,  they  carefully  allege,  “upon  information  and  belief,”  that  unnamed,  unidentified \n“SeaWorld performers” engaged with white customers.  For example, Plaintiffs allege that the \ncharacter Telly Monster allegedly refused to engage with the Fleming family.  Am. Compl. ¶ 50.  \nThey do not allege that Telly Monster was readily engaging with white customers at the time.  See \n  9 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 29-1   Filed 11/02/22   Page 15 of 24\nid. ¶ 52.  The same is true for all of the other named Plaintiffs—none alleges that the characters \nthat allegedly ignored them were, at the same time, actively engaging with white children.  Id. \n¶¶ 41, 43, 59, 61, 68, 70, 77, 79, 86, 88, 95, 97, 104, 106.  In other words, Plaintiffs do not allege \nthat they were treated differently than anyone else by the characters that allegedly refused to \nengage with them.  This is fatal to their § 1981 claim. \nPlaintiffs have not alleged facts to demonstrate that they experienced disparate treatment \nby the at-issue costumed characters, let alone that the characters acted with the required intentional \nracial animus at the time of the interactions.  Gen. Bldg. Contractors Ass’n, Inc. v. Pennsylvania, \n458 U.S. 375, 383 n.8, 391 (1982) (“§ 1981 can be violated only by intentional discrimination”; \ndisparate impact insufficient).  Accordingly, Plaintiffs “have not nudged their claim[] across the \nline from conceivable to plausible,” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570, and their § 1981 claim should be \ndismissed.  See, e.g., Uber Driver Partner Emery v. Uber Techs. Inc., 2022 WL 1196700, at *2 \n(3d Cir. Apr. 22, 2022) (affirming dismissal of § 1981 claim where plaintiff “failed to allege facts \nto suggest that he was treated differently than similarly situated Uber drivers who were not in a \nprotected class.”); Wright v. Reed, 2021 WL 912521, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 10, 2021) (plaintiffs \nfailed to adequately allege a § 1981 claim where “the only allegations pertaining in any way to \nrace are that (1) [Plaintiffs] are African American, (2) the Defendant police officers are white, \n(3) there were several non-African Americans among the group of teenagers at the basketball \ngame; and (4) the teenagers who were arrested are African American.”).  Similarly here, Plaintiffs \nallege that they are members of racial minorities and that they did not receive the attention that \nthey allegedly desired, but that is not sufficient where they have not even alleged that the same \ncharacters that allegedly ignored them were at the same time actively engaging with non-minority \nguests.   \n  10 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 29-1   Filed 11/02/22   Page 16 of 24\nFor the same reason, the named Plaintiffs do not fall within the class as defined, which is \nlimited to those who “suffered disparate treatment from SeaWorld and/or its agents and/or \nemployees by ignoring minority children while openly interacting with similarly situated white \nchildren,” (Am. Compl. § 108(d)(e) (emphasis added)), and they therefore lack standing to serve \nas class representatives.  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 348-49 (2011) (“[A] class \nrepresentative must be part of the class and possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as \nthe class members.”) (quoting E. Tex. Motor Freight Sys. Inc. v. Rodriguez, 431 U.S. 395, 403 \n(1977)).  \nB.  The Amended Complaint Fails to State an Actionable Claim for Negligence \n1.  Elements of the Cause of Action \nUnder Pennsylvania law, the elements of a negligence claim are: (1) the existence of a duty \nor obligation recognized by law; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a causal connection between the \nbreach of duty and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage.  Krentz v. Consol. Rail \nCorp., 910 A.2d 20, 27 (Pa. 2006).  “Whether a duty exists under a particular set of facts is a \nquestion of law.”  Campisi v. Acme Markets, Inc., 915 A.2d 117, 119 (Pa. Super. 2006) (quoting \nPetrongola v. Comcast-Spectacor, L.P., 789 A.2d 204, 209 (Pa. Super. 2001)).  While it is not \nclear the source of the legal duty that Plaintiffs allege existed and was breached, they appear to \nbase their negligence claim on the fact that they were “business invitees” to Sesame Place and thus \nwere entitled to duties owed to business invitees.  Am. Compl. ¶ 125.    \n2.  Plaintiffs Fail to Plead Breach of Any Duty Owed to Business Invitees \n“Pennsylvania courts have adopted the Second Restatement of Torts to determine the duty \nowed by a possessor of land to an invitee on his or her property.”  Speirs v. Marriott Int’l, 2009 \nWL 3365877, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 20, 2009) (citing Kirschbaum v. WRGSB Assoc., 243 F.3d 145, \n152 (3d Cir. 2001)); see also Farabaugh v. Pa. Turnpike Comm’n, 590 Pa. 46, 59 (Pa. 2006) (“[A] \n  11 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 29-1   Filed 11/02/22   Page 17 of 24\nlandowner’s duty” to business invitees “derives from Section 343 of the Restatement (Second) of \nTorts.”).  Under the applicable Restatement section, “a possessor of land is subject to liability for \nphysical harm caused to invitees by a condition on the land” in certain circumstances.  Speirs, \n2009 WL 3365877 at *3 (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 (1965)) (emphasis added); \nVanic v. Ragni, 435 Pa. 26, 32 (Pa. 1969) (“[T]he possessor of land is responsible to business \ninvitees for physical harm caused by a dangerous condition existing on the land if he fails to \nexercise reasonable care to protect them against the danger.”) (quotation omitted) (emphasis \nadded).   \nHere, Plaintiffs have not identified any physical harm that they have allegedly suffered.  \nThe plain language of the Restatement, as explicitly adopted by Pennsylvania courts, requires \nphysical harm for a negligence claim by a business invitee against a landowner.  Defendants have \nlocated no case in which a Pennsylvania state or federal court has ever recognized a duty of \nlandowners to prevent non-physical harm to business invitees (or such a case where a plaintiff \neven made the argument, given the clarity of the physical harm requirement).  Thus, to the extent \nthat Plaintiffs base their negligence claim on the duties owed to business invitees, they fail to state \na claim.  See Mulligan v. Crescent Plumbing Supply Co., Inc., 845 S.W.2d 589, 591-92 (Mo. Ct. \nApp. 1992) (affirming grant of motion to dismiss plaintiff’s negligence claim; holding that \nlandowners have no duty to prevent property loss, only physical harm). \nFurther, Plaintiffs additionally fail to state such a claim because people (such as employees \ndressed as Sesame Street characters) do not constitute a “condition on the land,” required for a \nnegligence claim premised on the duty of landowners to business invitees.  See Cmty. Ass’n \nUnderwriters of Am., Inc. v. Queensboro Flooring Corp., 2016 WL 852520, at *7 (M.D. Pa. Mar. \n  12 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 29-1   Filed 11/02/22   Page 18 of 24\n4, 2016) (“[W]orkers cannot serve as a basis for the imposition of liability against [defendant] \nunder section 343 because their presence does not constitute a condition on the land.”). \n3.  Plaintiffs Fail to Otherwise Plead Negligence \nOther than the duty owed to business invitees, the Amended Complaint does not identify \nany other source of an alleged duty recognized by law.  The negligence count instead appears to \nbe a re-packaging of Plaintiffs’ discrimination claim: because some of its employees allegedly \ndiscriminated against Plaintiffs in violation of § 1981,6 SeaWorld must have been negligent.  That \nis not sufficient.  Plaintiffs cannot “borrow” § 1981 for use as evidence to prove negligence.  See \nLevin v. Dollar Tree Stores Inc., 2006 WL 3538964, at *3-4 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 6, 2006) (finding that \nan alleged violation of federal anti-discrimination statute could not be used as evidence of \nnegligence); see also Buttermore v. Loans, 2016 WL 308875, at *5 (W.D. Pa. Jan. 25, 2016) \n(rejecting  complaint’s  reliance  on  “the  premise  that  because  Caliber’s  employees  allegedly \nviolated the law, it must follow that Caliber was negligent or reckless in hiring them.”).  \nFurther, the majority of the count is a list of thirty alleged breaches of an undefined duty.  \nThese are all mere conclusory statements devoid of factual support that are not entitled to the \npresumption of truth and must be disregarded.  Connelly, 809 F.3d at 789, 790 (as part of motion \nto dismiss analysis, the Court must “identify those allegations that, being merely conclusory, are \nnot  entitled  to  the  presumption  of  truth,”  and  “affirmatively  disregard[]  a  pleading’s  legal \nconclusions.”).   \n                                                 \n6 The Amended Complaint’s allegation that the employees allegedly discriminated against \nPlaintiffs is a legal conclusion not entitled to the presumption of truth on a motion to dismiss.  See \nConnelly, 809 F.3d at 790 (allegation that plaintiff’s supervisors “subjected her to disparate \ntreatment based on her gender and retaliation for making complaints about discrimination and \nsexual harassment” was not entitled to the presumption of truth).    \n  13 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 29-1   Filed 11/02/22   Page 19 of 24\nFor example, Plaintiffs allege a breach based upon “[f]ailing to screen and perform \nbackground checks [sic] potential employees to ensure that no employee has a propensity for racial \ndiscrimination” and for “[f]ailing to have, enact, follow and enforce policies and procedures for \nscreening potential employees.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 127(c)(d).  But Plaintiffs fail to allege any duty \nthat would require such “propensity” background checks, nor does the Amended Complaint \ncontain any allegations about what kind of background checks or “screenings” were performed, \nwhat information allegedly existed pre-hire that should have alerted SeaWorld not to hire any \nparticular individuals, or any other basis to conclude that SeaWorld was negligent in its hiring \nprocess.  See Buttermore, 2016 WL 308875 at *3-4 (granting motion to dismiss negligent hiring \nclaim, stating that plaintiffs must “allege facts that would establish that the employer knew or \nshould have known of a reason not to hire the employee” at the time of hiring, and determining \nthat  allegations  that  employer  failed  to  “properly  interview”  and  “properly  supervise”  its \nemployees were conclusory statements not entitled to the presumption of truth).   \nSimilarly, Plaintiffs allege a breach based upon “[f]ailing to properly train the employees \nand managers to recognize incidents of racial discrimination between employees and customers.”  \nAm.  Compl.  ¶ 127(o).    Plaintiffs  fail  to  point  to  any  legal  duty  that  would  require  such \n“recognition” training, nor any facts regarding what kind of training is provided or what policies \nand procedures are in place or why they are insufficient.  See Oldham v. Pa. State Univ., 2022 WL \n1528305, at *24 (W.D. Pa. May 13, 2022) (dismissing claim for negligent training where plaintiff \nalleged that the defendants failed to provide adequate training, but provided no information about \nthe trainings, who did or did not receive them, or why they were deficient).7   \n                                                 \n7 The “list of 30” includes multiple other alleged breaches that appear to be re-statements \nof this alleged failure to properly train.  See Am. Compl. ¶ 127(e) (“Failing to have, enact, follow \nand enforce policies and procedures designed to prevent and discourage racial discrimination in \n  14 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 29-1   Filed 11/02/22   Page 20 of 24\nFinally, the “list of 30” contains allegations of affirmative offensive actions that have \nabsolutely no factual support.  For example, it alleges that SeaWorld “[e]nact[ed] policies, \npractices and/or customs that … rewarded racial discrimination in customer interactions.”  Am. \nCompl. ¶ 127(g).  Which policies are those?  Which rewards are those?  The Amended Complaint \ndoes not, and cannot, say.  Similarly, it alleges that SeaWorld “[e]ncourag[ed] racial discrimination \nagainst customers.”  Id. ¶ 127(w).  What affirmative “encouragement” did SeaWorld provide?  \nAgain, on these extremely inflammatory allegations, the Amended Complaint is silent.   \nNone of the “list of 30” is entitled to the presumption of truth, and they must all be \ndisregarded.  Once those conclusory allegations are properly disregarded, there is nothing left.  \nPlaintiffs have failed to adequately allege a negligence claim, and it should be dismissed. \n                                                 \ncustomer interactions”); id. ¶ 127(f) (“Failing to train, educate, supervise or inform its employees \nto avoid racial discrimination in customer interactions”); id. ¶ 127(k) (“Failing to have policies \nand procedures to  prevent employees from engaging in racial discrimination”); id. ¶ 127(l) \n(“Failing to use, require and enforce policies and procedures that ensure hiring and training of \nemployees who do not engage in racial discrimination”); id. ¶ 127(m) (“Failing to have policies \nand procedures designed to educate employees about racial discrimination and/or implicit bias”); \nid. ¶ 127(n) (“Failing to use, require and enforce policies and procedures designed to educate \nemployees about racial discrimination and/or implicit bias”); id. ¶ 127(p) (“Failing to properly \ntrain the  employees and managers on how to document  and  report incident [sic] of racial \ndiscrimination between employees and customers”); id. ¶ 127(q) (“Failing to properly train the \nemployees and managers to recognize employees who are engaged in racial discrimination of \ncustomers”); id. ¶ 127(r) (“Failing to adopt, enact, employ and enforce proper and adequate \nprograms, precautions, procedures, measures and plans to prevent racial discrimination between \nemployees and customers”); id. ¶ 127(s) (“Failing to adequately plan, plot and implement policies, \nprocedures and responses related to racial discrimination between employees and customers”); id. \n¶ 127(u) (“Enacting inadequate policies and procedures to prevent or discourage employees from \ncommitting acts of racial discrimination against customers”).  No matter how many times Plaintiffs \nsay it with slightly different words, they have failed to allege facts to support a negligence claim \nbased on failure to train. \n  15 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 29-1   Filed 11/02/22   Page 21 of 24\nC.  The Valdez and Willie Families Must Be Dismissed Because They Have \nWaived Their Right to Participate in Any Form of Class Action \nThe Valdez and Willie parent-plaintiffs purchased season passes.  See Kenny Decl. ¶¶ 7, 8 \nand Exs. 5 and 7 thereto.  Season passes refer to SeaWorld’s EZpay terms and conditions.  Kenny \nDecl. Exs. 5 and 7.  Those terms and conditions explicitly state: \nAny and all disputes, claims, and causes of action arising out of or connected with \nthis contract or the use of any park or membership SHALL BE RESOLVED \nINDIVIDUALLY,  WITHOUT  RESORT  TO  ANY  FORM  OF  CLASS \nACTION.  \nKenny Decl. Ex. 6 at page 5/7.  Because their claims arise out of “use of” the Sesame Place park, \nthese plaintiffs are required to resolve any such claims on an individual basis.  Id.  They cannot \n“resort to any form of class action.”  Id.  They therefore should be dismissed from this case—a \nputative class action for which they can be neither a member nor a representative.  See, e.g., Korea \nWeek Inc. v. Got Capital, LLC, 2016 WL 3049490, at *1, *11 (E.D. Pa. May 27, 2016) (finding \nthat named plaintiffs who signed class action waivers cannot serve as class representatives). \nV.  PLAINTIFFS LACK ARTICLE III STANDING FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nPlaintiffs seek four forms of injunctive relief, including, inter alia, an order requiring that \nSeaWorld “evaluate by appropriate psychological testing and behavioral history whether its \nexisting agents and/or employees are racially bigoted” and an order requiring SeaWorld to \n“implement mandatory educational courses … on the history of discrimination against minority \npeople in America” to be provided by a “nationally acclaimed expert in the field of African and \nminority History and Culture.”  Am. Compl. § 130(d)-(g).   \nFederal courts have limited jurisdiction.  Gunn v. Minton, 568 U.S. 251, 256 (2013).  And \na court presumes it lacks jurisdiction “unless the contrary appears affirmatively from the record.”  \nDaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 342 n.3 (2006) (quoting Renne v. Geary, 501 U.S. \n312, 316 (1991)).  “[A] plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each form of relief \n  16 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 29-1   Filed 11/02/22   Page 22 of 24\nsought.”  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Env’t Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 185 (2000); \nFreedom from Religion Found. Inc. v. New Kensington Arnold Sch. Dist., 832 F.3d 469, 480 (3d \nCir. 2016) (“A plaintiff seeking relief must show he or she has standing for each remedy sought.” \n(citing Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 184)).  “[W]here the claim at issue is one for injunctive relief, ‘past \nwrongs do not in themselves amount to that real and immediate threat of injury necessary to make \nout a case or controversy.’”  Lundy v. Hochberg, 91 F. App’x 739, 743 (3d Cir. 2003) (quoting \nLyons, 461 U.S. at 103).  Rather, to have standing to seek prospective injunctive relief, “the \nplaintiff must show that he is likely to suffer future injury from the defendant’s conduct.”  McNair \nv. Synapse Grp. Inc., 672 F.3d 213, 223 (3d Cir. 2012) (internal quotes omitted). \nHere, the named Plaintiffs lack standing to pursue injunctive relief because they have not \nalleged that they intend to return to Sesame Place, and thus are not likely to be harmed again in a \nsimilar way.  McNair, 672 F.3d at 225 (plaintiffs lacked standing for injunctive relief because they \nare not likely to be repeat customers of defendant they believe defrauded them); In re Johnson & \nJohnson Talcum Powder Prods. Mktg. Sales Pracs. & Liab. Litig., 903 F.3d 278, 293 (3d Cir. \n2018) (plaintiff lacked injunctive relief standing because she will not suffer the same alleged injury \nnow that she knows of the practice from which she is seeking future protection).  Not only do they \nnot allege that they will go back, their allegations make it clear that they will not, given that they \nnow believe that Sesame Place engages in “demeaning racial discrimination” against children that \nallegedly caused them damages to their “mental health[] and personal dignity.”  See Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 123, 128.  “[S]peaking generally, the law accords people the dignity of assuming that they act \nrationally, in light of the information they possess.”  McNair, 672 F.3d at 225; see Winkworth v. \nSpectrum Brands, Inc., 2020 WL 3574687, at *8 (W.D. Pa. June 30, 2020) (“Plaintiffs have not \nalleged that they will sustain future injury.  Moreover, given their allegations that the Hot Rollers \n  17 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 29-1   Filed 11/02/22   Page 23 of 24\nare defective … it is unreasonable to assume that Plaintiffs would sustain future injury by \nrepurchasing the Hot Rollers” and dismissing request for injunctive relief); Silva v. Rite Aid Corp., \n416 F. Supp. 3d 394, 400 (M.D. Pa. 2019) (granting motion to dismiss request for injunctive relief \nand declining to allow plaintiff to amend to add allegations of future intent to re-purchase allegedly \noffending product because “[w]hen an individual suffers an injury and subsequently becomes \naware of the cause of that injury, the law affords the individual the dignity of assuming that they \nwill not act in a manner which results again in the same injury.”).  \nSince there is not a sufficient likelihood that named Plaintiffs will again be wronged in a \nsimilar way, they are not entitled to seek injunctive relief, on behalf of themselves or the class.  \nLyons, 461 U.S. 111 (“Absent a sufficient likelihood that he will again be wronged in a similar \nway, Lyons is no more entitled to an injunction than any other citizen”); McNair, 673 F.3d at 223-\n27 (because named plaintiffs lacked standing for injunctive relief, they could not pursue injunctive \nrelief on behalf of class); see also Goldstein v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., 609 F. Supp. 2d 1340, \n1348 (N.D. Ga. 2009) (former customer of defendant who did not allege “that he plans in the future \nto purchase a Dryer from Defendant” lacked standing to seek injunctive relief on behalf of class \nof consumers who might be subjected to the allegedly illegal practice).  Accordingly, the claims \nfor injunctive relief must be dismissed and Plaintiffs should not be able to pursue a Rule 23(b)(2) \ninjunctive relief class. \nVI.

A true and correct copy of the \nEZpay terms and conditions is attached hereto as Exhibit 6 (starting at page 4/7).  Those terms \nand conditions have been in place since December 3, 2019, and apply to Sesame Place 2021 \nPlatinum Season Pass –EZpay passes purchased from December 3, 2019 to present.  As part of \nMs. Valdez’s season pass, she received free single day guest tickets.  The language on the single \nday tickets as of December 2021 is that found, for example, on Exhibit 3 hereto. \n8.  Attached as Exhibit 7 hereto is a true and correct copy of the Willie family \npasses/tickets to Sesame Place used to attend Sesame Place on July 10, 2022.  Lauren Willie \npurchased a Sesame Place Philadelphia 2022 Gold Season Pass.

I don't recall 14 respond to guest concerns, how to make our -- you\n15 if someone sent me the link, if I saw the link, 15 know, what to inform our team about as far as the\n16 but I was made aware that it was circulating. 16 protests go and how to answer any questions that\n17     Q  Did you ever participate in any meetings 17 they might have.\n18 at Sesame Place about the lawsuit? 18     Q  And who at Sesame Place would be\n19     A  I did. 19 responsible for answering media questions about --\n20     Q  And which meetings would that have been? 20     A  Typically marketing.\n21     A  We met a few times more so to discuss kind 21     Q  Marketing?\n22 of what steps would be taken.

INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs were not satisfied with their Sesame Place experiences.  They filed a federal court \nclass action alleging race discrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and negligence based on \ntheir experiences.  After more than a year of discovery, including the production of thousands of \npages of documents and fifty depositions, Plaintiffs do not have evidence establishing the essential \nelements of their claims, and summary judgment should be granted to Defendants.   \nAs to their § 1981 claim, after the Court’s motion to dismiss ruling, Plaintiffs must show \nthat a costumed character refused to interact with them.  Many of the named Plaintiffs cannot do \nso.  Their own videos show, and they admitted in their depositions, that the costumed characters \nat issue did interact with their children, just not in the way they thought their children wanted to \nbe interacted with.  That theory did not survive the motion to dismiss hearing when Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel admitted that Plaintiffs are not arguing that guests are entitled to the personalized \ninteractions they desire.  As to the other Named Plaintiffs whose scenarios include a costumed \ncharacter’s alleged refusal to interact, the factual evidence shows that there were legitimate non-\ndiscriminatory reasons why.  It was not because of the race of the child, but because the costumed \ncharacter performer could not see the child due to the positioning of the costume’s field of vision, \nbecause they did not have time to provide an individual interaction because they had to move to \ntheir next mark along the parade route, or because of the positioning of the children along the \nparade route.  Plaintiffs therefore cannot show the necessary discriminatory intent.  They also \ncannot show the violation of any contractual right.  While it is certainly the case that there is a \nright not to be discriminated against at a theme park like Sesame Place, that right is provided by \nfederal and state law, not by the only alleged contracts at issue here—Plaintiffs’ tickets/season \npasses.  “[N]ot every negative interaction is a product of discrimination.”  Calhoun v. TJM Trevose, \nLLC, 2023 WL 5208853, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 14, 2023).  Here, Plaintiffs may have had what they \n1 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 7 of 32\nconsider to be negative interactions, but they cannot show that those interactions were the product \nof intentional race discrimination or that they resulted in the impairment of a contractual right, and \nthus have failed to establish the essential elements of their § 1981 claim. \nBecause Plaintiffs cannot establish their § 1981 claim, their negligence per se claim based \non it fails.  The negligence per se claim also fails for the additional reason that it is preempted by \nthe Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (“PHRA”).  Any claim for race discrimination at a place \nof public accommodation (like a theme park) in Pennsylvania must be brought as a PHRA claim \nwith the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission rather than as a common law claim in court.  \nNone of the Named Plaintiffs filed a PHRA claim with the Commission, and they cannot subvert \nthe PHRA’s statutory framework by pursuing a negligence claim in this court instead. \nDefendants also should be granted summary judgment as to Plaintiffs’ injunctive relief \nclaims because discovery has confirmed that none of them has injunctive relief standing.  None \nfaces a real and immediate threat of being wronged again in a similar way because none has any \nconcrete plans to return to Sesame Place.  Without at the very least returning to the park, it is \nimpossible that they would be injured again. \nJudgement should therefore be entered for Defendants and Plaintiffs’ Amended Class \nAction Complaint dismissed with prejudice. \nII.  FACTS \nA.  Sesame Place Tickets and Season Passes \nSesame  Place  is  a  theme  park  located  in  Langhorne,  Pennsylvania.    Statement  of \nUndisputed Material Facts, filed concurrently herewith, (“SUMF”) 1.  There are multiple ways to \ngain admission to the park, including single day tickets, multiple day tickets, and season passes.  \nSUMF 2.  If a person purchases a season pass, they have the option to pay the entire cost of the \nseason pass on the day of purchase, or they can opt for the “EZPay” payment method that allows \n  2 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 8 of 32\nthe purchaser to break the full payment amount into monthly installments.  SUMF 3.  If a person \ndecides to pay for a season pass via the EZPay method, they are required to agree to SeaWorld’s \nEZPay terms and conditions.  SUMF 4.  Sesame Place tickets and season passes allow the holder \nadmission to the park provided there are not weather or capacity constraints and that the guests \nobey all park rules and regulations.  SUMF 5.  Tickets and season passes do not guarantee that a \ncustomer will get an interaction with a costumed character during a parade or meet and greet.  \nSUMF 6. \nB.  Sesame Place Parades and Meet and Greets \nSesame Place has employees who work in multiple different departments responsible for \nvarious park functions.  As relevant to Plaintiffs’ complaint, costumed character performers are \nmembers of the Entertainment Department.  SUMF 7.  During the class period, costumed character \nperformers participated in various activities, including full (also known as regular) parades, mini \nparades, and meet and greets (also known as character walks).  SUMF 8.   \nBoth the full and mini parades included costumed characters, dancers, and floats that \nproceeded along the parade route while park guests gathered along both sides of the parade route.  \nSUMF 9.  During both full parades and mini parades, performers needed to be sure to stay in front \nof parade floats for safety because the line of sight of parade float drivers is limited; if a performer \ndoes not stay in front of the float, it is possible they could not be seen by the float driver and be hit \nby the float.  SUMF 10.   \nFull parades lasted approximately 25 minutes and included three “show stops,” which were \nscripted performances along the parade route with choreography.  SUMF 11.  Those show stops \nprovided some opportunities for costumed character performers to provide “extra interactions” \nwith some park guests along the parade route.  SUMF 12.   \n  3 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 9 of 32\nDuring 2022, when Sesame Place had lower staffing, they began doing mini parades.  \nSUMF 13.  Mini parades, which were approximately 10 minutes shorter than full parades, included \nconstant movement of costumed characters, dancers, and floats with no show stops.  SUMF 14.  \nThere were fewer opportunities for costumed character performers to interact with park guests \nduring mini parades than during full parades because there were no show stops in mini parades.  \nSUMF 15.   \nMeet and greets, also known as character walks, involve a costumed character performer \ngoing to a designated location in the Sesame Place park to take photographs and/or videos with \nguests.  SUMF 16.  During these events, costumed character performers are accompanied by a \nnon-costumed Entertainment Department employee, called a walk host, who escorts the costumed \ncharacter to the designated location and forms a line of guests waiting to meet with the costumed \ncharacter.  SUMF 17.  Walk hosts are also responsible for “cutting” the line of guests waiting to \ntake a picture with the costumed character within the designated time limit.  SUMF 18.  Meet and \ngreets have a 30-minute time limit or, if the “real feel” temperature is 100 degrees Fahrenheit or \nhigher, a 20-minute time limit.  SUMF 19.  These time limits are for the safety of costumed \ncharacter performers and are intended to prevent them from overheating.  SUMF 20.  Meet and \ngreets often are scheduled to end an hour before a scheduled parade because the costumed \ncharacter performer participating in a meet and greet would also likely participate in the parade.  \nSUMF 21. \nC.  The Viral Rosita Video \nIn July of 2022, a video filmed during a mini parade at Sesame Place involving the \ncostumed character Rosita went viral on the Internet.  SUMF 22.  The “viral” Rosita video did not \ninvolve any of the Named Plaintiffs.  SUMF 23.  In response to the “viral” Rosita video, Sesame \n  4 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 10 of 32\nPlace made a number of changes, including that costumed characters no longer provide personal \nextra interactions with any guests during the parades.  SUMF 24.  \nIII.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Complaint \nShortly after the Rosita video went viral in July of 2022, Plaintiffs filed their original \ncomplaint in this case as a putative class action.  ECF 1.  They voluntarily amended it two months \nlater and included seven (7) additional putative class representative parents and children.  ECF 25 \n(“FAC”).  There are now eight (8) putative class representative adults and eight (8) putative class \nrepresentative children (the “Named Plaintiffs”).  They allege that, while visiting Sesame Place, \nall class members were the victims of “intentional race discrimination” because their minority \nchildren were ignored, while “similarly situated white children” were “openly interacted with” \nduring parades and meet and greets.  FAC ¶¶ 43, 52, 61, 70, 79, 88, 97, 106, 109(e).  Plaintiffs \npled two counts: (1) violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981; and (2) negligence.  Id. ¶¶ 115-128.  They seek, \ninter alia, monetary damages, declaratory relief, and multiple forms of injunctive relief.  Id. ¶ 130.  \nB.  Motion to Dismiss \nDefendants moved to dismiss both counts for failure to state a claim and to dismiss the \ninjunctive claims for relief for lack of standing.  ECF 29.  The Court granted in part and denied in \npart Defendants’ motion.  ECF 48, 49.   \nAs to § 1981, the Court found that Plaintiffs’ admission tickets are the contracts underlying \ntheir claims.  ECF 48 at 5 n.3.  The Court further found that Plaintiffs had abandoned the theory \nalleged in the complaint that Plaintiffs were contractually guaranteed interactions with character \nperformers.  Id. at 9.  However, Plaintiffs’ § 1981 claim based on the theory that the costumed \ncharacter performers were contractually obligated to not refuse to interact with customers on the \nbasis of race survived dismissal.  Id. at 9, 12. \n  5 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 11 of 32\nAs to negligence, the Court granted the motion to dismiss as to four of Plaintiffs’ five \npleaded theories.  Id. at 14-22.  The Court dismissed with prejudice Plaintiffs’ claim premised on \nalleged  negligent  hiring  and  negligent  training  (id.  at  16-21);  dismissed  without  prejudice \nPlaintiffs’ claim premised on alleged negligent supervision (id. at 22); and found that Plaintiffs \nabandoned their premises liability theory.  Id. at 14.  The Court declined to dismiss Plaintiffs’ \nnegligence per se claim, finding that it was adequately pleaded based on Plaintiffs’ § 1981 claim.  \nId. at 15-16.   \nThe Court denied the motion to dismiss the injunctive relief claims, finding that because \nthe Willie family had a non-expired season pass at the time the complaint was filed, they had a \nnon-speculative intent to return to Sesame Place.  Id. at 24.   \nTherefore, what remains after the Court’s ruling is (1) a § 1981 claim based on the theory \nthat Plaintiffs’ Sesame Place tickets/season passes provided them a right not be refused interactions \nwith costumed characters on the basis of race; and (2) a negligence per se claim based on alleged \nviolations of § 1981.   \nC.  Discovery \nThe parties exchanged written discovery, produced documents, and conducted depositions.  \nAs relevant here, Defendants deposed all adult Named Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs deposed twenty-seven \nfact witnesses, including seven current and former employees involved in the at-issue videos \nlinked in the FAC.  Plaintiffs also conducted multiple 30(b)(6) depositions of the Defendants.   \nD.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification \nOn November 27, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification.  ECF 97.  In \nthat motion, Plaintiffs presented a different class definition, a different theory of the case, and a \ndifferent theory for certification than what they pled in the FAC.  Because Plaintiffs have not filed \n  6 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 12 of 32\na motion for nor been granted leave to amend, for purposes of this summary judgment motion, \nDefendants will address Plaintiffs’ claims as alleged in the operative pleading, the FAC.   \nIV.  LEGAL STANDARD \nA motion for summary judgment should be granted when “there is no genuine dispute as \nto any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n56(a).  Rule 56 “mandates the entry of summary judgment” where the non-moving party “fails to \nmake a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, \nand on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.”  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. \n317, 322 (1986). \n“By its very terms, [the summary judgment] standard provides that the mere existence of \nsome alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported \nmotion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.”  \nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986).  A fact is “material” if it “might \naffect the outcome” of the case, and a dispute is “genuine” only if there is sufficient evidence “that \na reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.”  Id. at 248.   \nThe moving party bears the initial burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of \nmaterial fact.  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323.  Then, the non-moving party “must set forth specific facts \nshowing that there is a genuine issue for trial.”  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250.  The non-moving party \nmust show more than the “mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of [its] position.”  \nId. at 252.  It “may not merely deny the allegations in the moving party’s pleadings,” Doe v. \nAbington Friends Sch., 480 F.3d 252, 256 (3d Cir. 2007) (citation omitted), or “rely merely upon \nbare assertions, conclusory allegations or suspicions.”  Fireman’s Ins. Co. v. DuFresne, 676 F.2d \n965, 969 (3d Cir. 1981) (citing Ness v. Marshall, 660 F.2d 517, 519 (3d Cir. 1971)).  Further, \narguments made in briefs “are not evidence and cannot by themselves create a factual dispute \n  7 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 13 of 32\nsufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion.”  Jersey Cent. Power & Light Co. v. Lacey Twp., \n772 F.2d 1103, 1109-10 (3d Cir. 1985).  Instead, the mon-moving party “must show where in the \nrecord there exists a genuine dispute over a material fact.”  Doe, 480 F.3d at 256.   \nV.  DEFENDANTS SHOULD BE GRANTED JUDGMENT ON PLAINTIFFS’ § 1981 \nCLAIM \nA.  Summary Judgment Standard for § 1981 Claims \nSection 1981 prohibits racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts.  \n42 U.S.C. § 1981.  To prove a § 1981 claim, “a plaintiff must prove intentional discrimination, \nwhich can come with direct or indirect evidence.”  Calhoun, 2023 WL 5208853, at *3.  Where, as \nhere, Plaintiffs have no direct evidence of discrimination1, courts apply the burden-shifting \nframework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1983), including in the non-\nemployment context.  Calhoun, 2023 WL 5208853, at *3 (citing Anderson v. Wachovia Mortg. \nCorp., 621 F.3d 261, 267-68 (3d Cir. 2010)).2  \nUnder that three-part framework, first the Plaintiffs must establish a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination.  Calhoun, 2023 WL 5208853, at *3; McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802.  To \nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination for § 1981, Plaintiffs must show: (1) that they belong \nto  a  racial  minority;3  (2) Defendants’  intent  to  discriminate  on  the  basis  of  race;  and \n(3) discrimination concerning activities enumerated in § 1981, including the right to make and \n                                                 \n1 Direct evidence, if believed, proves the existence of discriminatory intent “without the need for \ninference or presumption,” for example, racially derogatory statements.  Carroll v. Tompkins \nRubber Co., 1993 WL 195472, at *5 (E.D. Pa. June 8, 1993), aff’d, 16 F.3d 402 (3d Cir. 1993).   \n2 See also Cruz v. Farmers Ins. Exch., 42 F.4th 1205, 1210 (10th Cir. 2022); Doe v. Brown Univ., \n43 F.4th 195, 208 n.9 (1st Cir. 2022); Blackshire v. Cnty. of Yuba, 648 F. Supp. 3d 1221, 1233 \n(E.D. Cal. 2023); Clark v. Safeway, Inc., 478 F. Supp. 3d 1080, 1087 (D. Or. 2020). \n3 Defendants do not challenge this element of Plaintiffs’ claim. \n  8 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 14 of 32\nenforce contracts.  See Brown v. Philip Morris Inc., 250 F.3d 789, 797 (3d Cir. 2001); Calhoun, \n2023 WL 5208853 at *3.4   \nSecond, if Plaintiffs establish a prima facie case, the burden shifts to Defendants to offer a \n“legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason” for their conduct.  Calhoun, 2023 WL 5208853, at *3; \nMcDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802.   \nThird, if Defendants do so, then Plaintiffs must offer evidence that Defendants’ evidence \nis pretextual.  Calhoun, 2023 WL 5208853, at *3; McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804-05.  At \nthis third stage in the burden-shifting framework, Plaintiffs must show “both that the [non-\ndiscriminatory] reason was false, and that discrimination was the real reason” for the defendant’s \nconduct.  St. Mary’s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 407, 515 (1993).   \nUnlike in Title VII cases, in which a plaintiff can demonstrate pretext by showing that \ndiscrimination was a motivating factor for Defendants’ conduct, “[s]ection 1981 claimants must \nprove discrimination was [a] but-for cause” of the conduct.  West v. Honewell Int’l Inc., 558 F. \nSupp. 3d 369, 379 (S.D. Tex. Aug. 31, 2021) (citing Comcast Corp. v. Nat’l Ass’n of Afr. Am. \nOwned Media, 140 S. Ct. 1009, 1014-15 (2020)) (emphasis added); Tannous v. Cabrini Univ., \n2023 WL 6465842, at *6 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 4, 2023) (a plaintiff “must prove that but for his race, he \nwould not have been discriminated against in the making or enforcing of contracts,” not that “race \nwas a ‘motivating factor’ in the loss of a legally protected right.”) (original emphasis). \n                                                 \n4 See also Tashman v. Advance Auto Parts, Inc., 63 F.4th 1147, 1151 (8th Cir. 2023) (“To establish \na  prima  facie  case  of  discrimination  in  the  retail  context,  a  § 1981  plaintiff  must  show \n(1) membership in a protected class, (2) discriminatory intent on the part of the defendant, and \n(3) interference by the defendant with an activity protected under the statute.” (quoting Green v. \nDillard’s, Inc., 483 F.3d 533, 538 (8th Cir. 2007)). \n  9 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 15 of 32\nB.  Plaintiffs Cannot Make a Prima Facie Case For Some Claims \nSome of the Named Plaintiffs’ claims cannot get past the first step in the McDonnell \nDouglas framework because they fail to establish a prima facie case of race discrimination.   \nBurns.  The Burns family alleges that during their June 18, 2022 Sesame Place visit, the \nemployees performing as Elmo, Ernie, Telly Monster, and Abby Cadabby committed intentional \nrace discrimination by “refusing to engage with them and ignoring them” while readily engaging \n“with numerous similarly situated white customers and their children.”  FAC ¶¶ 36, 40, 41, 43.  \nPlaintiffs cannot make a prima facie case of discrimination as to the characters Elmo and Abby \nCadabby, because Mr. Burns admitted in his deposition that they did not engage in discriminatory \nconduct. \nAs to Elmo, Mr. Burns admitted that he had confused the characters, and that Elmo actually \nwas not one of the characters that allegedly discriminated against K.B.  SUMF 25.  He testified, \n“Elmo is not the one that didn’t engage with [K.B.], it was Ernie and the monster,” and that he \ncould not recall anything that Elmo did that was discriminatory to his family.  JA 109-112.  \nBecause the Burns Plaintiffs no longer claim that the employee dressed as Elmo discriminated \nagain them, Defendants should be granted judgment as to that portion of their claim. \nAs to Abby Cadabby, Mr. Burns clarified during his deposition that he is not claiming that \nAbby Cadabby ignored K.B. during the parade.  SUMF 26.  The Burns family’s claim related to \nAbby Cadabby is about a meet and greet, not a parade.  SUMF 27.  However, the employee dressed \nas Abby Cadabby was not even a part of the meet and greet interaction about which the Burns \nfamily complains.  JA 97-100 (testifying that the escort for the character, not the character, told \nhim that the line was closed).5  Because Plaintiffs have no claim that the employee dressed as \n                                                 \n5 Even as to the unidentified escort, this person did not say anything racist to the Burn Plaintiffs.  \nSee JA 101 (the only thing the employee said was that the line was closed, and then the Burns \n  10 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 16 of 32\nAbby Cadabby discriminated against the Burns Plaintiffs, Defendants should be granted judgment \nas to that portion of their claim. \nThe Fleming, Miles, and Romero Plaintiffs cannot establish a prima facie case of race \ndiscrimination following the Court’s motion to dismiss ruling.  As acknowledged therein, Plaintiffs \nhave  abandoned  their  theory  that  they  were  contractually  guaranteed  personally  curated \ninteractions with characters.  ECF 48 at 9.  The only theory that remains is that Sesame Place \nemployees could not “refuse to engage” with customers on the basis of race.  Id.  It is undisputed \nthat the at-issue costumed characters did interact (did not “refuse to engage”) with the Fleming, \nMiles, and Romero children.  The parents admitted that in their depositions.  JA 174-179, 196-197 \n(Fleming); JA 244-248, 262 (Miles); JA 374, 381-382, 384, 397 (Romero).  The children just did \nnot receive the specific type of interaction they apparently desired.  Because the characters did not \n“refuse to engage” with the Fleming, Miles, and Romero Plaintiffs, those families do not have \nviable § 1981 claims. \nFleming.  The Fleming family alleges that the employee performing as Telly Monster in \nthe parade during their July 4, 2022 Sesame Place visit committed intentional race discrimination \nby “refusing to engage with them” while readily engaging “with numerous similarly situated white \ncustomers and their children,” as documented in the videos in footnotes 3 and 4 of the FAC.  FAC \n¶¶ 45, 49, 50, 51, 52.  However, Mr. Fleming admitted that the video in footnote 4 does not show \n                                                 \nwalked away).  Mr. Burns claims that he believes he was told that the line was closed because of \nrace discrimination, but his only basis for this conclusion is that as he walked away, he looked \nback and saw another family that he assumed was white, but admits could have been Hispanic, \ngetting in line.  JA 87, 97, 101-103, 132.  He was walking away from the location at that point, \nand did not know whether the escort said anything to that family, e.g., similarly told that other \nfamily that the line was closed.  JA 101, 133.  The Burns have not alleged race discrimination by \nthis unidentified escort, but have not established a prima facie case of race discrimination against \nthem in any event. \n  11 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 17 of 32\nan act of discrimination; it was included merely because it purports to show O.F.’s reaction to the \nincident captured in the video in footnote 3.  SUMF 28.  As to the video in footnote 3, it shows the \nemployee dressed as Telly Monster specifically engaging with O.F. and touching her hand.  FAC \np. 9 n.3.  Mr. Fleming admitted in his deposition that O.F. did get an interaction with Telly \nMonster, just an interaction he found insufficient.  JA 174-179, 189-190, 196-197.  Mr. Fleming \nalso testified that he believes the child next to O.F. that received a high five from Telly Monster \nwas Asian.  JA 174-177.  So it is not the case that Telly Monster “refused to engage with” O.F., or \nthat  he  was  “engaging  with  numerous  similarly  situated  white  customers,”  as  alleged,  and \nDefendants are entitled to judgment on the Fleming family’s § 1981 claim.   \nMiles.  The Miles family alleges that the employee performing as Rosita in the parade \nduring their June 24, 2022 Sesame Place visit committed intentional race discrimination by \n“refusing to engage with them and ignoring them” while readily engaging “with numerous \nsimilarly situated white customers and their children,” as documented in the video in footnote 5 of \nthe FAC.  FAC ¶¶ 54, 58, 59, 60, 61.  Ms. Miles confirmed in her deposition that the video linked \nin footnote 5 captures the only alleged incident of discrimination underlying her claim.  SUMF 29.  \nMs. Miles admitted that the Rosita character did not say anything derogatory or anything about \nrace to M.C.  SUMF 30.  Her sole basis for alleging that the interaction was discriminatory is that \nthe Rosita character hugged one little girl (that Ms. Miles believes to be white because of her skin \ncolor and hair texture) and looked at M.C.’s sister and walked away.  JA 20-22, 239-242.   \nIn the at-issue video, M.C. was wearing a black shirt and swimming trunks, and his sister, \nL.C.6, was between M.C. and the camera.  SUMF 31.  M.C. and L.C. both identify as Black.  \n                                                 \n6 Herein, Defendants use initials for the names of minors, but this child is referred to in Ms. \nMiles’s deposition transcript by her name.  JA 213. \n  12 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 18 of 32\nSUMF 32.  Ms. Miles identified and circled L.C.’s hand as the hand on or near Rosita’s hand in a \nstill shot of the video in footnote 5.  JA 244-246, 262.  The employee performing as Rosita during \nthis event testified that he waved to the little girl with her hand stretched out [L.C.].  SUMF 33, \n34.  Ms. Miles further admitted in her deposition that a wave counts as an interaction.  SUMF 35.  \nTherefore, the allegation that Rosita “refused to interact” or “ignored” the Miles family is false.  \nAt the very least, L.C. received a wave, and Ms. Miles testified that a wave counts as an interaction.   \nFurther, even if the Miles Plaintiffs had established a prima facie case, summary judgment \nshould still be granted because the employee involved also testified that the reason why he gave \nthe first girl in the video a hug and the second girl [L.C.] a wave, was not because of the second \ngirl [L.C.]’s race, skin color, or because of how she looked.  Rather, he hugged the girl he came \nupon first and then was concerned about keeping the mini parade moving, so waved to other guests \nafter that point.  SUMF 36.  Thus, that employee had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for \nthe interaction complained of and captured in the video in footnote 5.   \nRomero.  The Romero family alleges that the employees performing as Cookie Monster \nand Zoe in the parade during their June 25, 2022 Sesame Place visit committed intentional race \ndiscrimination by “refusing to engage with them” while readily engaging “with numerous similarly \nsituated white customers and their children,” as documented in the videos in footnotes 8 and 9 of \nthe FAC.  FAC ¶¶ 72, 76, 77, 78, 79.  Ms. Romero confirmed in her deposition that the videos in \nfootnotes 8 and 9 capture all of the alleged incidents of discrimination underlying her claim.  \nSUMF 37.   \nAs to the video in footnote 8 involving Cookie Monster, Ms. Romero admitted in her \ndeposition that E.C. did get an interaction with Cookie Monster (a “hand tap”), just an interaction \nshe found insufficient.  JA 351, 374-376, 396, 397.  And even though Ms. Romero complains that \n  13 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 19 of 32\nCookie Monster went on to “hug” a child that she assumes is white based on skin color (JA 37-39, \n377-379, 398), that interaction was for the safety of the child, who had crossed the yellow safety \nline and was in the parade route.  The yellow line at the parade is there for guests’ safety and \nprevents them from getting too close to the parade floats and performers.  SUMF 38.  The costumed \ncharacters are trained that in instances when a child crosses the yellow safety line into the parade \nroute, to gently guide the child back behind the yellow line to safety.  JA 1031, ¶ 9.  There is thus \na legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for that interaction. \nSimilarly as to the video in footnote 9 involving Zoe, Ms. Romero admitted that Zoe did \ninteract with E.C. by giving her a “thumbs up,” but that she thinks Zoe should have done more  JA \n381-382, 384-385.   \nBecause neither Cookie Monster nor Zoe “refused to engage” with E.C., Plaintiffs have \nfailed to make a prima facie case of race discrimination and judgment should be granted for \nDefendants.7   \nC.  Plaintiffs Cannot Demonstrate an Intent to Discriminate \nAssuming for the sake of efficiency, without conceding, that Plaintiffs have established a \nprima facie case as to the other interactions alleged in the FAC not addressed in the above section, \nPlaintiffs’ § 1981 claim would still fail.8   \n                                                 \n7 Ms. Romero also admitted that neither Cookie Monster nor Zoe said anything derogatory or \nanything about race to E.C.  SUMF 39, 40. \n8 When a defendant offers a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the at-issue conduct, courts \nmay start with step two of the McDonnel Douglas framework and assume for purposes of analysis \nthat a plaintiff has made out a prima facie case.  See Caroll, 1993 WL 195472, at *5; see also \nFarrell  v.  Planters  Lifesavers  Co.,  206  F.3d  271,  286  (3d  Cir.  2000)  (“nothing  about  the \nMcDonnell Douglas formula requires us to ration the evidence between one stage or the other.”).  \n  14 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 20 of 32\nThe second element of a § 1981 claim is intent to discriminate on the basis of race.  Brown, \n250 F.3d at 797.  Section 1981 can only be violated by purposeful discrimination.  General Bldg. \nContractors Ass’n, Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 391 (1982); Ferrill v. Parker Grp., Inc., \n168 F.3d 468, 472 (11th Cir. 1999) (“Section 1981 liability must be founded on purposeful \ndiscrimination.”).  None of the at-issue costumed characters is alleged to have said anything \nracially offensive or to have made any offensive gestures.  Plaintiffs’ claims are based solely on \nan alleged lack of personal interactions.  Here, there is a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for \neach action complained of by Plaintiffs.  In other words, there was no purposeful discrimination. \nBurns.  The Burns family alleges that the employees performing Telly Monster and Ernie \ncommitted intentional race discrimination as documented in the videos in footnotes 1 and 2 of the \nFAC.  FAC ¶¶ 40, 41, 42, 43.   \nAs to Telly Monster, the employee performing as Telly Monster during the event in the \nvideo in footnote 1 testified that the reason he did not interact with the little girl with the pigtails \n[K.B.] was because she was not in his vision from within the costume and he could not see her, \nnot because of her race, skin color, or the way she looked.  SUMF 41, 42.  Thus, that employee \nhad a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the interaction complained of and captured in the \nvideo in footnote 1.   \nAs  to  Ernie,  Sesame  Place’s  Events  and  Production  Manager,  who  has  extensive \nexperience performing in the Ernie costume and who reviewed the video in footnote 2 of the FAC, \ndeclared that because the part of the costume that the performer sees out of is pointing away from \nthe little girl with the pigtails wearing the white shirt in the video [K.B.], the performer in the Ernie \ncostume could not have seen the little girl with the pigtails and the white shirt [K.B.].  SUMF 43, \n44, 45.  He further declared that twelve seconds in to the video, Ernie begins to cross the street \n  15 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 21 of 32\nwith the choreography mapped to that point in the parade, and at that point, the performer was \nrequired to cross the street to the other side of the parade route and could not perform any more \ninteractions with guests on the side of the parade route where they were located at the beginning \nof the video.  SUMF 46.  Thus, that employee had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the \ninteraction complained of and captured in the video in footnote 2. \nMorales.  The Morales family alleges that the employees performing as Big Bird, Grover, \nand Baby Bear in the parade during their July 11, 2022 Sesame Place visit committed intentional \nrace discrimination by “refusing to engage with them and ignoring them” while readily engaging \n“with numerous similarly situated white customers and their children,” as documented in the \nvideos in footnotes 6 and 7 of the FAC.  FAC ¶¶ 63, 67, 68, 69, 70.  Ms. Morales confirmed in her \ndeposition that the videos linked in footnotes 6 and 7 of the FAC capture all of the alleged incidents \nof discrimination underlying her claim.  SUMF 47.  In those videos, Plaintiff N.M. is the girl with \nbraids holding the Abby Cadabby doll.  SUMF 48.  What Ms. Morales claims is discriminatory is \nthat (1) Big Bird interacted in some way with someone to the left of N.M. and high-fived the child \nin the stroller to the right of N.M. in the video in footnote 6 (JA 285-286, 293-296); (2) Grover \nhigh-fived the child in the stroller to the right of N.M. in the video in footnote 7 (JA 297, 300-\n304); and (3) Baby Bear high-fived the woman to the left of N.M. in the video in footnote 7.  JA \n297, 304-307.  Plaintiffs’ claims must fail because Ms. Morales has admitted that she does not \nknow whether the family to the left or the child in the stroller to the right were actually Hispanic \nas opposed to Caucasian.  JA 287-288, 291-292, 294, 300-301, 305.  Plaintiffs thus have not \nestablished that they were ignored while “similarly situated white customers and their children” \nwere interacted with. \n  16 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 22 of 32\nEven if the Morales Plaintiffs had established a prima facie case, however, their claim \nwould still fail.  As to the interaction with Big Bird, the employee performing that character \ntestified that the allegation that he did not interact with the little girl with the braids [N.M.] because \nof her race is false, and that his actions in the video were not in any way motivated by her race, by \nher skin color, or by how she looked.  SUMF 49, 50.  Rather, he did not see her as he walked past.  \nSUMF 50.  That is because the field of vision in the costume is very small, with no peripheral \nvision, and when the part of the costume that the performer sees out of is facing forward (as was \nthe case in the video in footnote 6), the employee in the costume is “fully blind” to the guests on \nthe sides, JA 820-821, and N.M. was to the character’s side.  FAC at ¶ 11, n.6; SUMF 51, 52.  \nAccordingly, to the extent it is even factually true that he interacted with white customers (as \nopposed to Hispanic ones) and not N.M., there is a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for his \nactions. \nAs to the interaction with Grover, the employee performing as Grover during the event in \nthe video in footnote 7, who is Black, declared that by the time the little girl with the braids and \nblack hooded sweatshirt [N.M.] waved at Grover, the part of the Grover costume that the performer \nsees out of was completely turned away from her, so he did not see her express her desire for an \ninteraction.  SUMF 53, 54, 55.  He further declared that he did not avoid interacting with the little \ngirl because of her race, and to him, her skin color appeared to be the same as or similar to that of \nthe child in the stroller to whom he gave a high five.  SUMF 56.  Thus, to the extent he interacted \nwith white customers (as opposed to a Hispanic one) and not N.M., that employee had a legitimate, \nnon-discriminatory reason for his actions. \nAs to the interaction with Baby Bear, the employee performing that character testified that \nhe did not decline to interact with N.M. because of her race or because of how she looked in any \n  17 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 23 of 32\nway.  SUMF 57, 58.  Race did not play a role in his deciding to interact with anyone on the parade \nroute at any time.  SUMF 58.  Rather, he explained that: (1) it is not possible to have personal \ninteractions with every child on the parade route; (2) he did not interact with N.M. because he had \nto keep the parade moving and had to cross to the other side of the street when Telly Monster came \nto his side; and (3) N.M. was behind (rather than right up on) the yellow line, making it more \ndifficult to see her given the limited vision in the costume as well as potentially indicating a \nreluctance or less of a desire for an interaction.  JA 867-875, 877-880.  Accordingly, to the extent \nhe interacted with a white child (as opposed to a Hispanic one) and not N.M., there is a legitimate, \nnon-discriminatory reason for his actions. \nValdez.  The Valdez family alleges that the employee dressed as Abby Cadabby in the \nparade  during  their  December  29,  2021  Sesame  Place  visit  committed  intentional  race \ndiscrimination by “refusing to engage with them and ignoring them” while readily engaging “with \nnumerous similarly situated white customers and their children,” as documented in the video in \nfootnote 10 of the FAC.  FAC ¶¶ 81, 85, 86, 87, 88.  In that video, M.L. is the boy in the cap with \nthe olive fur jacket.  SUMF 59. \nThe employee performing as Abby Cadabby in the video in footnote 10 testified that she \ndid not refuse to interact with M.L. because of his race, but rather because he was behind the \nchildren she was interacting with, and he did not approach the line of children until after she had \npassed that spot when she was turning and walking to her next mark in the parade.  SUMF 60, 61.  \nGiven the limited field of vision in the Abby Cadabby costume, she testified that she believes that \nshe did not even see M.L. given the timing of his approach.  SUMF 62. She further testified that \nshe never chooses which children to interact with on the parade route based on race.  SUMF 63.  \nAccordingly, there is a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for her actions.     \n  18 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 24 of 32\nValette.  The Valette family alleges that the employee dressed as Grover in the parade \nduring their June 20, 2022 Sesame Place visit committed intentional race discrimination by \n“refusing to engage with them and ignoring them” while readily engaging “with numerous \nsimilarly situated white customers and their children,” as documented in the video in footnote 11 \nof the FAC.  FAC ¶¶ 90, 94, 95, 96, 97.  Ms. Valette confirmed in her deposition that the lack of \ninteraction with Grover is the only alleged incident of discrimination underlying her claim.  SUMF \n64.   \nThe employee performing as Grover in the video in footnote 11 testified that she did not \nrefuse to interact with D.V. because of her race, nor did she choose to interact with the other two \nchildren in the video because of their race (which appears to be Caucasian), but rather for safety.  \nShe first interacted with the other two children because they stepped out into the street, and she \nhugged them to gently push them back for their safety, and then she did not interact with D.V. \nbecause she had to keep moving to follow the safety rule that characters must stay in front of the \napproaching float.  SUMF 65, 66.  Accordingly, there is a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason \nfor her actions.   \nWillie.  The Willie family alleges that the employee dressed as Rosita during their July 10, \n2022 Sesame Place visit committed intentional race discrimination by “refusing to engage with \nthem” while readily engaging “with numerous similarly situated white customers and their \nchildren,” as documented in the video in footnote 12 of the FAC.  FAC ¶¶ 99, 103, 104, 105, 106.9   \n                                                 \n9 Ms. Willie also complains about an incident (about which she has no video or photographic \nevidence) in which her family allegedly attempted to get in line for a meet and greet with Rosita.  \nBut that incident consisted of an employee (other than the person in the Rosita costume) telling \nthe family that the line was closed because Rosita needed to get ready for the parade, and Ms. \nWillie did not claim that her family was treated differently than any other family (e.g. did not \ntestify that a white family was allowed to enter the line while her family was denied).  JA 62-63, \n576-578.  Further, walk hosts cut the lines at meet and greets to abide by the time limit the \n  19 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 25 of 32\nThe employee performing as Rosita in the video in footnote 12 testified that she did not \nrefuse to interact with L.W. because of her race or skin color, but rather because she did not see \nL.W. because the employee was looking upwards, and in the Rosita costume, the employee cannot \nsee anything below their eyeline.  SUMF 67, 68.  She further testified that Sesame Place has cute \nphoto ops around the park, including the one seen in the video in footnote 12 that features a \npainting of Abby Cadabby’s wings that people can stand in front of and take pictures.  SUMF 69.  \nShe testified that she would frequently join guests in their photo ops at murals like that, and her \ndecision to run over for a photo op with the child at the mural wall was not motivated by the race \nof the people standing by the mural wall.  SUMF 69.  Accordingly, there is a legitimate, non-\ndiscriminatory reason for her actions.   \nTo the extent that Plaintiffs will argue in their opposition that any of the Sesame Place \nemployee’s explanations of their intent or circumstances in the videos is pretextual, Defendants \nwill respond to any such arguments in their reply brief. \nD.  Plaintiffs Cannot Demonstrate Discrimination in Contracting \nPlaintiffs’ § 1981 claim also fails because they cannot establish the third element of the \nclaim—a violation of their right to make or enforce a contract.  A § 1981 claim requires that \nPlaintiffs “possess[] some contractual right that the defendant blocked or impaired.”  Williams v. \nRichland Cnty. Children Servs., 489 F. App’x 848, 851 (6th Cir. 2012).  Here, the only “contracts” \nare Plaintiffs’ Sesame Place tickets/season passes.  ECF 48 at 5 n.3.  Those tickets/passes entitled \nthe holder to admission to the park (provided there were not weather or capacity constraints and \n                                                 \nperformers can be in the costumes for their safety, and meet and greets are often scheduled to end \nan hour before a parade because the costumed character performer participating in a meet and greet \nwould also likely participate in a parade.  SUMF 18, 19, 20, 21.  Thus to the extent Plaintiffs intend \nto pursue a claim based on this claimed incident, they have not established a prima facie case. \n  20 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 26 of 32\nthat the guests obeyed all park rules and regulations).  SUMF 5.  They did not guarantee that a \ncustomer would get an interaction with a costumed character.  SUMF 6.   \nTo be sure, Plaintiffs have a right not to be discriminated against on the basis of race at \nSesame Place.  But that is not a right provided by the purported contract—the ticket/season pass.  \nFederally,  that  right  is  provided  by  Title  II  of  the  Civil  Right  Act,  which  prohibits  race \ndiscrimination in places of public accommodation.  42 U.S.C. § 2000a (“All persons shall be \nentitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, \nand accommodations of any place of public accommodation … without discrimination on the \nground of race[.]”). \nBut Plaintiffs did not bring a Title II case.  They chose to bring a § 1981 case, which \nprohibits only race discrimination in contracting.  42 U.S.C. § 1981.  “[U]nder § 1981, it is not \nenough to show purposeful discrimination, a plaintiff must show such purposeful discrimination \ninterfered with contractual rights.”  Watkins v. BLM Cos., LLC, 644 F. Supp. 3d 439, 451-52 (S.D. \nOhio 2022) (citing Domino’s Pizza, Inc. v. McDonald, 546 U.S. 470 (2006)).  For a § 1981 claim, \nthere “must have been interference with the contract beyond the mere expectation of being treated \nwithout discrimination[.]”  Hampton v. Dillard Dep’t Stores, Inc., 247 F.3d 1091, 1118 (10th Cir. \n2001); see also Fox v. Vitamin Cottage Natural Grocers, 2006 WL 2308492, at *5 (D. Colo.

Del. 1996) (granting \n  21 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 27 of 32\nsummary  judgment  to  defendants  and  rejecting  theory  that  an  unwritten  contract  between \ncommercial establishments and the public guarantees that whenever a member of the public enters \nthe premises they “will be treated equally regardless of race.”).10  The Supreme Court has stated \nclearly that § 1981 does not “provide an omnibus remedy for all racial injustice.”  Domino’s, 546 \nU.S. at 479.  And it does not provide a remedy for what Plaintiffs complain of here. \nVI.  DEFENDANTS  SHOULD  BE  GRANTED  JUDGMENT  ON  PLAINTIFFS’ \nNEGLIGENCE CLAIM \nThe only part of Plaintiffs’ negligence claim that remains is negligence per se based on an \nalleged § 1981 violation.  Because, as shown above, Plaintiffs cannot establish a § 1981 violation, \njudgment should also be granted to Defendants on Plaintiffs’ negligence claim.  See Schemberg v. \nSmicherko, 85 A.3d 1071, 1074 (Pa. Super. 2014) (negligence per se requires violation of \napplicable statute). \nHowever, even if Plaintiffs could show a § 1981 violation, Defendants should still be \ngranted judgment on the negligence claim because it is preempted by the Pennsylvania Human \nRelations  Act  (“PHRA”).    The  PHRA  is  “the  exclusive  state  law  remedy  for  unlawful \ndiscrimination, preempting the advancement of common law claims … based on claims of \ndiscrimination.”  Weaver v. Harpster, 975 A.2d 555, 567 n.10 (Pa. 2009); 43 Pa. Stat. § 962(b) \n(PHRA excludes any action that could have been brought pursuant to the PHRA). \n                                                 \n10 While some district court cases have determined in the restaurant context that denying black \nguests “the accoutrements that are ordinarily provided with a restaurant meal,” such as silverware, \nplates, and use of restaurant bathrooms can state a § 1981 claim (McCaleb v. Pizza Hut of Am., \nInc., 28 F. Supp. 2d 1043, 1048 (N.D. Ill. 1998); Perry v. Burger King Corp., 924 F. Supp. 548, \n552  (S.N.D.Y.  1996)),  here,  individual  interactions  with  costumed  characters  are  not \n“accoutrements ordinarily provided” with Sesame Place tickets.  SUMF 6; see also ECF 48 at 9 \n(during the motion to dismiss hearing, “Plaintiffs’ counsel clarified” that “Plaintiffs are not \nalleging that they were contractually guaranteed interactions with the performers.”).   \n  22 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 28 of 32\nPlaintiffs’ common law negligence claim is based on alleged race discrimination that could \nhave been brought pursuant to the PHRA.  43 Pa. Stat. § 955(h)(11)(i)(1) (prohibiting race \ndiscrimination in places of “public accommodation, resort or amusement”).  No putative class \nrepresentative filed a PHRA claim with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission regarding \nthe incidents underlying this lawsuit.  SUMF 70.  Accordingly, Defendants should be granted \njudgment on Plaintiffs’ negligence claim.  Clay v. Advanced Comput. Applications, Inc., 559 A.2d \n917,  918  (Pa.  1989)  (plaintiffs  who  fail  to  seek  redress  for  their  grievances  through  the \nPennsylvania Human Rights Commission are barred from judicial recourse); Murray v.

DEFENDANTS  SHOULD  BE  GRANTED  JUDGMENT  ON  THE  VALDEZ \nCLAIMS BECAUSE MS. VALDEZ SIGNED A CLASS ACTION WAIVER \nPlaintiff Valdez used a season pass for her family’s at-issue visit to Sesame Place.  SUMF \n71; ECF 29-3 at p.18 (Valdez 2021 Platinum Season Pass – Ezpay)11.  She purchased that season \npass online at the Sesame Place website.  SUMF 72.  As a condition of that season pass purchase, \nMs. Valdez agreed to SeaWorld’s EZPay terms and conditions, which include a class action \nwaiver.  SUMF 74, 75.  That waiver states: \nAny and all disputes, claims, and causes of action arising out of or connected with \nthis contract or the use of any park or membership SHALL BE RESOLVED \nINDIVIDUALLY,  WITHOUT  RESORT  TO  ANY  FORM  OF  CLASS \nACTION.  \nSUMF 75.  Because the Valdez Plaintiffs’ claims “arise out of” “the use of” the Sesame Place park \nand their membership, they have waived their right to participate in this class action and must \nresolve any such claims individually.  Defendants therefore should be granted judgment as to all \nof their claims.  See, e.g., Kubischta v. Schlumberger Tech Corp., 2016 WL 4752917, at *1, *6-8 \n(W.D. Pa. July 14, 2016) (granting summary judgment to defendant on claims of putative class \nrepresentative because he signed a class action waiver). \nVIII.  DEFENDANTS SHOULD BE GRANTED JUDGMENT ON THE INJUNCTIVE \nRELIEF CLAIMS BECAUSE PLAINTIFFS LACK ARTICLE III STANDING \nPlaintiffs “bear[] the burden of showing that [they] ha[ve] standing for each type of relief \nsought,” including injunctive relief.  Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009) \n(citing City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105 (1983)).  Because Plaintiffs seek prospective \ninjunctive  relief, they “must  show  that  [they are]  ‘likely  to suffer  future  injury’  from  the \ndefendant’s conduct.”  McNair v. Synapse Grp., Inc., 672 F.3d 213, 223 (3d Cir. 2012) (emphasis \n                                                 \n11 The Valdez season pass in ECF 29-3 is a copy of Ms. Valdez’s season pass.  SUMF 73. \n  24 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 30 of 32\nadded) (quoting Lyons, 461 U.S. at 105).  Those claiming a “risk of future harm” may seek \n“forward-looking, injunctive relief to prevent the harm from occurring,” but only if “the risk of \nharm is sufficiently imminent and substantial.”  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, \n2210 (2021). \nAccordingly, to have standing, Plaintiffs must show that they are likely to imminently \nsuffer future race discrimination by Sesame Place employees.  Defendants argued in their motion \nto dismiss that none of the Plaintiffs could make that showing because Plaintiffs are not likely to \nreturn to Sesame Place.  ECF 29-1 at 22.  If they do not at the very least go back to Sesame Place, \nthen they cannot “again be wronged in a similar way.”  Lyons, 461 U.S. at 111. \nAt the motion to dismiss stage, the Court found that the fact that the Willie family had \nseason passes that had not expired at the time the lawsuit was filed indicated a sufficient enough \n“intent on their part to return to the park” to survive a motion to dismiss.  ECF 48 at 24.  Discovery \nhas confirmed that none of the Plaintiffs has returned to Sesame Place since the date they sued \nDefendants.  SUMF 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 89, 92.  The Willie family did not use their season \npasses to return to Sesame Place after their at-issue visit on July 10, 2022, SUMF 91, 92, despite \nthe fact that those passes did not expire until January 2023.  Those passes have now expired and \nwere not renewed.  SUMF 91, 92, 93.  Ms. Valdez also terminated the season pass she used for the \nat-issue Sesame Place visit.  SUMF 87.  Further, none of the Plaintiffs has current plans to return \nto Sesame Place, SUMF 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 88, 90, 94.  They therefore do not have an “imminent” \nrisk of being harmed again, and thus lack standing for injunctive relief.   \nEven if a Named Plaintiff would hypothetically be willing to return to Sesame Place “if \nthings were different,” that would not establish standing.  “Mere ‘allegations of possible future \ninjury are not sufficient.’”  Schaller v. U.S. Soc. Sec. Admin., 844 F. App'x 566, 571 (3d Cir. 2021) \n  25 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 31 of 32\n(not precedential) (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013)).  “[A]n injury \nin fact requires an intent that is concrete rather than only ‘some day’ intentions[,] because some \nday intentions do not support a finding of the actual or imminent injury required to establish \nstanding.”  Id. (cleaned up, quotations omitted).  Especially where “an injury rests on a claimed \ndesire to travel somewhere, providing specific dates is crucial, as imminency would be ‘stretched \nbeyond the breaking point when … a plaintiff alleges only an injury at some indefinite future \ntime.’”  Id. (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 564 n.2 (1992)).  Plaintiffs cannot \nestablish standing “without description of concrete plans, or indeed even any specification of when \nthe some day will be.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564.  None of the Named Plaintiffs has such concrete \nplans, and thus none can seek injunctive relief. \nWhen  no  Named  Plaintiffs  have  standing  for  injunctive  relief,  they  cannot  pursue \ninjunctive relief on behalf of a class.  McNair, 673 F.3d at 223-27.  Defendants therefore should \nbe granted judgment on Plaintiffs’ injunctive relief claims. \nIX.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, judgment should be granted to Defendants on all counts, and \nthe Amended Class Action Complaint dismissed with prejudice.  \n \n  26 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-1   Filed 12/18/23   Page 32 of 32\nDated: December 18, 2023      Respectfully submitted, \n \nDUANE MORRIS LLP \n/s/ Leigh M.

Sesame Place is a theme park located in Langhorne, Pennsylvania.  JA 625. \n2.  There are multiple ways to gain admission to Sesame Place, including single day \ntickets, multiple day tickets, and season passes.  JA 791. \n3.  If a person purchases a season pass, they have the option to pay the entire cost of \nthe season pass on the day of purchase, or they can opt for the “EZPay” payment method that \nallows the purchaser to break the full payment amount into monthly installments.  JA 792-793. \n4.  If a person decides to pay for a season pass via the EZPay method, they are required \nto agree to SeaWorld’s EZPay terms and conditions.  JA 793, 798-802. \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-2   Filed 12/18/23   Page 2 of 13\n5.  Any Sesame Place ticket or pass entitles the holder to admission to the park \nprovided there are not weather or capacity constraints and that they obey all park rules and \nregulations.  JA 773-774; JA 795-797. \n6.  Tickets and season passes do not guarantee that a customer will get an interaction \nwith a costumed character during a parade or meet and greet.  JA 775-777. \n7.  At Sesame Place, costumed character performers are members of the entertainment \ndepartment.  JA 919. \n8.  During the class period, costumed character performers participated in various \nactivities, including full parades, mini parades, and meet and greets, also known as character walks.  \nJA 823; JA 890-891. \n9.  Sesame Place full parades and mini parades included costumed characters, dancers, \nand floats that proceeded along the parade route while park guests gathered along both sides of the \nparade route.  JA 973-977, 991-992; JA 823-824. \n10.  During both full parades and mini parades, performers needed to be sure to stay in \nfront of parade floats due to safety concerns that a float could run over a performer due to the \nlimited line of sight of parade float drivers.  JA 823-825; JA 903. \n11.  Full parades lasted approximately 25 minutes and included three “show stops,” \nwhich were scripted performances along the parade route with choreography.  JA 995; JA 1009; \nJA 1020.   \n12.  Show stops provided some opportunities for costumed character performers to \nprovide “extra interactions” with some park guests along the parade route.  JA 858-860; JA 959-\n960; JA 995-996.   \n  2 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-2   Filed 12/18/23   Page 3 of 13\n13.  During 2022, when Sesame Place had very low staffing, they began doing mini \nparades.  JA 857-858. \n14.  Mini  parades  were  approximately  10  minutes  shorter  than  full  parades,  and \nincluded constant movement of costumed characters, dancers, and floats with no show stops.  JA \n626-627; JA 823; JA 909-910. \n15.  There were fewer opportunities for costumed character performers to interact with \npark guests during mini parades than during full parades because there were no show stops in mini \nparades.  JA 959-960. \n16.  Meet and greets, also known as character walks, involve a costumed character \nperformer going to a designated location in the Sesame Place park to take photographs and/or \nvideos with guests.  JA 890-891; JA 593 (Willie family recorded video at meet and greet).   \n17.  During meet and greets, costumed character performers are accompanied by a non-\ncostumed Entertainment Department employee called a walk host who escorts the costumed \ncharacter to the designated location and forms a line of guests waiting to meet with the costumed \ncharacter.  JA 1018. \n18.  Walk hosts are also responsible for “cutting” the line of guests waiting to take a \npicture with the costumed character within the designated time limit.  JA 985-986; JA 1019. \n19.  Meet and greets have a 30-minute time limit or, if the “real feel” temperature is 100 \ndegrees Fahrenheit or higher, a 20-minute time limit.  JA 910. \n20.  The time limits for the costumed character employees in costume are for the safety \nof costumed character performers and are intended to prevent them from overheating.  JA 825; JA \n910. \n  3 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-2   Filed 12/18/23   Page 4 of 13\n21.  Meet and greets are often scheduled to end an hour before a scheduled parade \nbecause the costumed character performer participating in a meet and greet would also likely \nparticipate in the parade.  JA 984. \n22.  In July of 2022, a video filmed during a mini parade at Sesame Place involving the \ncostumed character Rosita went “viral” on the internet.  JA 231; JA 953-954; JA 987-988.  \n23.  The video involving the costumed character Rosita that went “viral” in July of 2022 \ndid not involve any of the Named Plaintiffs.  JA 92-93; JA 194-195; JA 231; JA 280; JA 317-318; \nJA 457-458; JA 485; JA 594-600.  \n24.  In response to the “viral” Rosita video, Sesame Place made a number of changes, \nincluding that costumed characters no longer interact with any guests during the parades.  JA 626-\n627; JA 836; JA 858-862. \n25.  Elmo is not one of the characters that allegedly discriminated against K.B.  JA 109. \n26.  The Burns Plaintiffs do not claim that the employee dressed as Abby Cadabby in \nthe parade depicted in the video in footnote 1 of the FAC discriminated against K.B.  JA 120. \n27.  The Burns Plaintiffs’ claim as to Abby Cadabby is related to a “meet and greet,” \nnot a parade.  JA 120. \n28.  The Fleming Plaintiffs do not claim that the video at footnote 4 of the FAC depicts \nan independent incident of race discrimination, but rather O.F.’s reaction to the interaction in the \nvideo at footnote 3.  JA 198-200. \n29.  The video linked in footnote 5 of the FAC captures the only alleged incident of \ndiscrimination underlying the Miles family’s claim.  JA 232-235. \n30.  The Rosita character did not say anything derogatory or anything about race to M.C.  \nJA 241. \n  4 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-2   Filed 12/18/23   Page 5 of 13\n31.  In the Miles Plaintiffs’ video at footnote 5 of the FAC, M.C. was wearing a black \nshirt and swimming trunks, and his sister, L.C., was standing between M.C. and the camera.  JA \n212-213, 231-237. \n32.  M.C. and his sister L.C. both identify as Black.  JA 249. \n33.  , a Sesame Place Entertainment Department employee, performed the \ncostumed character Rosita in the Miles Plaintiffs’ video at footnote 5 of the FAC.  JA 949-952, \n958, 961. \n34.   testified that during the event captured in the video in footnote 5 of the \nFAC that he waved to the little girl with her hand stretched out (L.C.).  JA 958, 961-963. \n35.  Ms. Miles testified in her deposition that a wave counts as an interaction.  JA 247-\n248. \n36.   testified that the reason why he gave the first girl in the video a hug and \nthe second girl (L.C.) a wave, was not because of the second girl’s race, skin color, or because of \nhow she looked.  Rather, he hugged the girl he came upon first and then was concerned about \nkeeping the mini parade moving, so waved to other guests after that point.  JA 961-963. \n37.  The videos linked in footnotes 8 and 9 of the FAC capture all of the alleged \nincidents of discrimination underlying the Romero family’s claim.  JA 364-368, 381. \n38.  The yellow line at the parade is there for guests’ safety and prevents them from \ngetting too close to the parade floats and performers.  JA 1031, ¶ 9; JA 368-369. \n39.  The Cookie Monster character did not say anything derogatory or anything about \nrace to E.C.  JA 379-380. \n40.  The Zoe character did not say anything derogatory or anything about race to E.C.  \nJA 368. \n  5 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-2   Filed 12/18/23   Page 6 of 13\n41.  , a Sesame Place Entertainment Department employee, performed \nthe costumed character Telly Monster in the Burns Plaintiffs’ video in footnote 1 of the FAC.  JA \n833-835, 837-838. \n42.   testified that the reason that he did not interact with the little girl with \nthe pigtails (K.B.) in the event captured in the video in footnote 1 of the FAC was because she was \nnot in his vision from within the costume and he could not see her, not because of her race, skin \ncolor, or the way she looked.  JA 839-840, 844-845. \n43.  Paul Joseph Schweizer is the Sesame Place Events and Production Manager.  JA \n1030, ¶ 2; JA 1007. \n44.  Mr. Schweizer has performed in hundreds of Sesame Place parades, and when in \ncostume, most often performed as Ernie and Grover.  JA 1030, ¶¶ 3, 4. \n45.  Mr. Schweizer reviewed the video linked in footnote 2 in the FAC, and declared \nthat he knows from personal experience that the person in the Ernie costume sees   \n was never pointed towards the little girl with the pigtails wearing a \nwhite shirt (K.B.) in the video, so the performer in the Ernie costume could not have seen her.  JA \n1030-1031, ¶¶ 5, 6. \n46.  Mr. Schweizer declared that at the twelve second mark in the video in footnote 2, \nErnie begins to cross the street with the choreography mapped to that point in the parade, and at \nthat point, the performer was required to cross to the other side of the parade route and could not \nperform any more interactions with the guests on the side of the parade route where Ernie was \nlocated at the beginning of the video.  JA 1031, ¶ 7. \n47.  The videos linked in footnotes 6 and 7 of the FAC capture all of the alleged \nincidents of discrimination underlying the Morales family’s claim.  JA 279, 282-285. \n  6 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-2   Filed 12/18/23   Page 7 of 13\n48.  The Morales child, N.M., is the girl with braids holding the Abby Cadabby doll in \nthe Morales Plaintiffs’ videos in footnotes 6 and 7 of the FAC.  JA 285-287. \n49.  , a Sesame Place Entertainment Specialist, performed the costumed \ncharacter Big Bird in the Morales Plaintiffs’ video in footnote 6 of the FAC.  JA 813-816. \n50.   testified that the allegation that he did not interact with the little girl \nwith the braids (N.M.) during the event captured in the video in footnote 6 of the FAC because of \nher race is false, and that his actions in the video were not in any way motivated by her race, by \nher skin color, or by how she looked, but because he did not see her as he walked past.  JA 820, \n821, 826. \n51.  The employee in the Big Bird costume sees  .  JA 817. \n52.  The field of vision in the Big Bird costume is very small, with no peripheral vision.  \nJA 818-820. \n53.   a former Sesame Place Entertainment Department employee, \nperformed the costumed character Grover in the Morales Plaintiffs’ video in footnote 7 of the FAC.  \nJA 1033, ¶¶ 3, 5. \n54.   is Black.  JA 1033, ¶ 4. \n55.   declared that the performer in the Grover costume sees   \n and by the time the little girl with the braids and black hooded sweatshirt (N.M.) waved at \nhim,   was completely turned away from her, so he did not see her express her desire \nfor an interaction.  JA 1033-1034, ¶ 6. \n56.   declared that he did not avoid interacting with the little girl with the \nbraids and black hooded sweatshirt (N.M.) because of her race, and to him, her skin color appeared \n  7 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-2   Filed 12/18/23   Page 8 of 13\nto be the same as or similar to that of the child in the stroller to whom he gave a high five.  JA \n1033-1034, ¶¶ 4, 6, 7. \n57.  ,  a  former  Sesame  Place  Entertainment  Department \nemployee, performed the costumed character Baby Bear in the Morales Plaintiffs’ video in \nfootnote 7 of the FAC.  JA 853-856, 863-865. \n58.   testified that he did not decline to interact with N.M. in the event \ncaptured in the video in footnote 7 of the FAC because of her race or because of how she looked \nin any way, and that race did not play a role in his deciding to interact with anyone on the parade \nroute at any time.  JA 875-876. \n59.  The Valdez child, M.L., is the boy in the cap with the olive fur jacket in the Valdez \nPlaintiffs’ video in footnote 10 of the FAC.  JA 442-443. \n60.  , a former Sesame Place Entertainment Department employee, \nperformed the costumed character Abby Cadabby in the Valdez Plaintiffs’ video in footnote 10 of \nthe FAC.  JA 930-936. \n61.   testified that she did not refuse to interact with M.L. in the event \ncaptured in the video in footnote 10 of the FAC because of his race, but rather because he was \nbehind the children she was interacting with, and he did not approach the line of children until \nafter she had passed that spot when she was turning and walking to her next mark in the parade.  \nJA 937-938, 940-941. \n62.   testified that she believes she did not even see M.L. given the timing \nof his approach.  JA 937-939.    \n63.   testified that she never chooses which children to interact with on \nthe parade route based on race.

The lack of interaction with Grover as captured by the video in footnote 11 of the \nFAC is the only alleged incident of discrimination underlying the Valette family’s claim.  JA 503. \n65.  , a Sesame Place Entertainment Department employee, performed the \ncostumed character Grover in the Valette Plaintiffs’ video in footnote 11 of the FAC.  JA 890-895. \n66.   testified that she did not refuse to interact with D.V. because of her \nrace, nor did she choose to interact with the other two children in the video because of their race \n(which appears to be Caucasian), but rather for safety:  she first interacted with the other two \nchildren because they stepped out into the street, and she hugged them to gently push them back \nfor their safety, and then she did not interact with D.V. because she had to keep moving to follow \nthe safety rule that characters must stay in front of the approaching float.  JA 894-897, 900-905. \n67.   performed the costumed character Rosita in the Willie Plaintiffs’ video \nin footnote 12 of the FAC.  JA 892-893, 897-899. \n68.   testified that she did not refuse to interact with L.W. during the event \ncaptured in the video in footnote 12 of the FAC because of her race or skin color, but rather because \n did not see L.W. because  was looking upwards, and in the Rosita costume, \nthe employee cannot see anything below their eyeline.

She testified that she would frequently join \nguests in their photo ops at murals like that, and her decision to run over for a photo op with the \nchild at the mural wall was not motivated by the race of the people standing by the mural wall.

IDENTIFY all PERSONS who witnessed ANY such instance described in response \nto subparagraph 2(e) \n \nANSWER NO. 2:  Plaintiffs object to this Interrogatory on the grounds that it is overly broad \nand unduly burdensome.  “Questions that ask for ‘all facts’ are generally considered overly broad \nand unduly burdensome.”  Paul W. Grimm, et al., MARYLAND DISCOVERY PROBLEMS \nAND SOLUTIONS 28-29 (2d ed. 2020) (citing Hiskett v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 180 F.R.D. 403 \n(D. Kan. 1998); see also Bradley v. Val-Mejias, No. 00-2395-GTV, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25278 \n(D. Kan. Oct. 9, 2001) (approved the phraseology “[S]tate in detail your factual version of how \nthe occurrence complained of in your Complaint took place,” as distinguished from “State each \nand every . . .,” which was disapproved, the distinction being that the former language sought only \nmaterial or principal facts whereas the latter sought “all” facts), aff’d, 379 F.3d 892 (10th Cir. \n2004); Evans v. Johns Hopkins Univ., 224 Md. 234, 167 A.2d 591 (1961) (holding that an \ninterrogatory seeking information on “any” explosions in a campus laboratory constituted an \nimpermissible “dragnet inquiry” irrelevant to the plaintiff’s claim respecting a specific explosion \nin which he was injured).  See also Tinoco v. Thesis Painting, Inc., 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163840, \n3 \nJA3\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 4 of 1384\nat *16 (D. Md. Sept. 24, 2018) (“[T]o the extent that … an interrogatory seeks every fact which \nsupports identified allegations, it will generally be found overbroad and unduly burdensome.”) \n(internal quotations and citation omitted); Kilby v. CVS Pharm., Inc., No. 09cv2051, 2019 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 32438, at *u-8 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 28, 2019) (agreeing with a plaintiff’s contention that \nparticular interrogatories were overbroad, because they require the plaintiff “to state ‘all facts’ \nrather than the material or principal facts that support [the plaintiff’s] allegations”)). The reason \nPlaintiff considers this interrogatory overly broad and unduly burdensome is because it requests \nPlaintiff to account for and recite “all facts” on a complex subject, which is not reasonable in the \ncontext of an interrogatory answer. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, \nPlaintiffs respond as follows: a) K.B. was attempting to interact with Elmo, Ernie, Telly Monster \nand Abby Cadabby b) On 6/18/22, K.B. attempted to interact with the costume characters \nidentified in subparagraph 2(a) at a Meet and Greet which took place at approximately 2pm and at \nthe 3pm Parade. c) The location of the attempted interaction was at a Meet and Greet while walking \nthrough the park and on Sesame Street d) the format of the attempted interaction was at the Parade \nand at a Meet and Greet e) Mr. Burns and K.B. exited the water park at approximately 2 pm and \nwere walking through the park towards Sesame Street. Mr. Burns wanted to ensure that K.B. had \na good spot for the Parade. On their way to Sesame Street, Mr. Burns and K.B. came across a Meet \nand Greet of a costume character. Mr. Burns does not recall which character it was.  Mr. Burns \nattempted to get in line so K.B. could get a hug and photograph with the costume character.  Mr. \nBurns and K.B. were told by the employee escort for the costume character that the line was closed.  \nAs they were walking away, Mr. Burns looked back and noticed that a white family was allowed \nto enter the line for the Meet and Greet after he was told that the line was closed. Each character \n(Elmo, Ernie, Telly Monster and Abby Cadabby) that K.B. attempted to interact with at the Parade \n4 \nJA4\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 5 of 1384\nignored K.B. and interacted with only white children.

State the format of the interaction (e.g., at a parade, while walking around the park, \nat a dining event, etc.) \ne.  Describe the attempt to interaction or the interaction and state ALL facts that show \nwhy YOU contend this interaction was racially discriminatory or was otherwise \nracially offensive \nf.  IDENTIFY all PERSONS who witnessed ANY such instance described in response \nto subparagraph 2(e) \n \nANSWER NO 2:  Plaintiffs object to this Interrogatory on the grounds that it is overly broad \nand unduly burdensome.  “Questions that ask for ‘all facts’ are generally considered overly broad \nand unduly burdensome.”  Paul W. Grimm, et al., MARYLAND DISCOVERY PROBLEMS \nAND SOLUTIONS 28-29 (2d ed. 2020) (citing Hiskett v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 180 F.R.D. 403 \n(D. Kan. 1998); see also Bradley v. Val-Mejias, No. 00-2395-GTV, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25278 \n(D. Kan. Oct. 9, 2001) (approved the phraseology “[S]tate in detail your factual version of how \nthe occurrence complained of in your Complaint took place,” as distinguished from “State each \nand every . . .,” which was disapproved, the distinction being that the former language sought only \nmaterial or principal facts whereas the latter sought “all” facts), aff’d, 379 F.3d 892 (10th Cir. \n2004); Evans v. Johns Hopkins Univ., 224 Md. 234, 167 A.2d 591 (1961) (holding that an \ninterrogatory seeking information on “any” explosions in a campus laboratory constituted an \nimpermissible “dragnet inquiry” irrelevant to the plaintiff’s claim respecting a specific explosion \nin which he was injured).  See also Tinoco v. Thesis Painting, Inc., 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163840, \nat *16 (D. Md. Sept. 24, 2018) (“[T]o the extent that … an interrogatory seeks every fact which \nsupports identified allegations, it will generally be found overbroad and unduly burdensome.”) \n3 \nJA62\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 63 of 1384\n(internal quotations and citation omitted); Kilby v. CVS Pharm., Inc., No. 09cv2051, 2019 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 32438, at *u-8 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 28, 2019) (agreeing with a plaintiff’s contention that \nparticular interrogatories were overbroad, because they require the plaintiff “to state ‘all facts’ \nrather than the material or principal facts that support [the plaintiff’s] allegations”)). The reason \nPlaintiff considers this interrogatory overly broad and unduly burdensome is because it requests \nPlaintiff to account for and recite “all facts” on a complex subject, which is not reasonable in the \ncontext of an interrogatory answer. Subject to the foregoing objections, Plaintiffs respond as \nfollows: a) L.W. was attempting to interact with Rosita. b) On 7/10/22, L.W. attempted to interact \nwith Rosita at approximately 4:59 p.m., c) The location of the attempted interaction was down \nfrom Oscars Crazy Taxi ride close to the Sesame Plaza and at a designated Meet and Greet for \nRosita. d) The format of the interaction was walking around the park and at a designated Meet and \nGreet area for Rosita. e) L.W. ran up to Rosita as she was walking by.  Rosita waved minor, L.W. \noff and ran over to take a photograph with a white child that was already taking a photograph in \nfront of a backdrop featuring Abby Cadabby. Later that same afternoon, Rosita was at her \ndesignated place for Meet and Greets and L.W. tried to get in line to take a photograph with Rosita.  \nThe park employee that was accompanying Rosita throughout the park barred Ms. Willie and L.W. \nfrom entering the line and told them that Rosita would not be seeing anyone else because she \nneeded to get ready for the Parade.  The Parade was not due to start for another hour and thirty \nminutes. e) Ms. Willie’s husband, Rodney Willie, brother, Benjamin Cooper, sister in laws, \nQuintara Cooper, and Tina Brown and brother in laws, Sammie Brown, and Keith Middleton \nwitnessed the instance described in the Answer to 2(e). \nINTERROGATORY NO. 3: \nFor EACH instance in which YOU contend that Sesame Street costumed characters \n“refus[ed] to engage” with YOU or “ignor[ed]” YOU: \n4 \nJA63\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 64 of 1384\na.  State whether YOU complained about the incident \nb.  If so, IDENTIFY EACH PERSON to whom YOU complained \nc.  Describe the response, if any, that YOU received to ANY such complaint, and \nd.  IDENTIFY EACH PERSON who provided YOU with the response \n \nANSWER NO. 3:  Ms. Willie called Sesame Place’s customer service to complain.  Ms. Willie \nwas on the phone with customer service for about an hour and thirty minutes. Following her phone \ncall, Ms. Willie received a call back from Sesame Place’s customer service to verify her email. Ms. \nWillie never received a call back or email response to address her complaint.    \nINTERROGATORY NO. 4: \nState each item of economic loss or damage that YOU contend YOU have suffered as a \nresult of the incident(s) YOU allege occurred at SESAME PLACE in the Amended Class Action \nComplaint. \n \nANSWER NO. 4:  Economic losses include the cost of tickets to Sesame Place.

Any  treatment  YOU  underwent  or  are  undergoing  that  was  prescribed  or \nrecommended, including but not limited to medications, therapies, counseling, \nreferral to other health professionals, or other modalities and the dates of ANY such \ntreatment \n \nANSWER NO. 5:  Plaintiffs experienced racial trauma as a result of Defendants’ discriminatory \npractices.  Plaintiffs have not sought treatment from any professional medical, psychological, or \nother health care provider as a result of Defendants’ discriminatory practices.   \n5 \nJA64\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 65 of 1384\nINTERROGATORY NO. 6: \nState ANY “professional opportunities” that YOU contend YOU have lost as a result of \nthe incidents alleged in the Amended Class Action Complaint. \n \nANSWER NO. 6:  None.  \nINTERROGATORY NO. 7: \nDescribe in detail ANY interviews YOU have given to any member of the media regarding \nthe incidents alleged in the Amended Class Action Complaint, including: \na.

HARRIS:  Object to form.  You can\n4      answer.\n5           THE WITNESS:  What do you mean, like --\n6 BY MS. PARDO:\n7      Q    So you just listed a couple of things for\n8 me, like meet and greets and rides and --\n9      A    So how did I see what --\n10      Q    Yeah, how did you form that understanding?\n11      A    On the website.\n12      Q    Okay.  And you're saying you read about\n13 these things on the website?\n14      A    Like meet and greet, the rides, you know,\n15 they have everything that you can do in the park on\n16 the website.\n17      Q    Okay.  And did --\n18      A    It's like a promotion, you know, you\n19 promote things, and then, you know, when you promote\n20 things it's got to be carried out, and that's my\n21 reason of a contract, you know.\n22      Q    And so did Sesame Place make any promises\nJA83\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 84 of 1384\nPage 46\n1 about what you would be able to do with your visit?\n2      A    Well, as again, if you promote something\n3 on your website, you know, the expectation is that's\n4 what you're going to get once you purchase the\n5 tickets and go inside.  So it's -- they're\n6 promising, they're promising on the advertisement\n7 this is what's going to happen.\n8      Q    Now, do you believe that there were\n9 promises that were not kept by Sesame Place in\n10 connection with your visit in June?\n11      A    Yes.\n12      Q    Okay.  Tell me what those promises were\n13 not delivered to you.\n14      A    That everybody get treated the same.\n15      Q    Can you be more specific?\n16      A    Well, I didn't know that racism -- I\n17 didn't know that everybody gets to pick who they\n18 want to shake their hands with.\n19      Q    Okay.  And when you say -- what do you\n20 mean by everybody gets to pick, who are you speaking\n21 of?\n22      A    I'm talking about the characters.\nJA84\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 85 of 1384\nPage 47\n1      Q    Okay.\n2      A    You know, they don't get to pick who they\n3 want to shake or greet, you know, and they're\n4 supposed to treat everybody the same way.\n5      Q    Now, when you were reading Sesame Place's\n6 website, did you read something that said everybody\n7 in the park would get a personal interaction with a\n8 character?\n9      A    No.\n10      Q    Okay.  That wasn't something that was\n11 promised?\n12      A    No, I didn't see that.\n13           MR. HARRIS:  Object to form.  You can\n14      answer.\n15 BY MS. PARDO:\n16      Q    Okay.  I want you to turn back to that\n17 thicker document that we marked as Exhibit 3, the\n18 Complaint, and if you would --\n19      A    This one?\n20      Q    -- turn to paragraph -- page 7.\n21      A    Okay.\n22      Q    Okay.  So paragraph 39, do you see that\nJA85\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 86 of 1384\nPage 53\n1 box that says Legal Terms?\n2      A    Yes.\n3      Q    Can you read through there and tell me the\n4 portion that talks about getting an interaction with\n5 a character.\n6      A    No, it doesn't say.\n7      Q    Okay.  It's not in there?\n8      A    No.\n9      Q    All right.  And this Legal Terms don't\n10 make a guarantee that you'll have a one-on-one\n11 interaction with a character, do they?\n12      A    No.\n13      Q    So turning back to your visit in June, can\n14 you just give me an overview of your visit on that\n15 day.  Describe to me what happened on the -- let's\n16 start with your first day, on June --\n17      A    On June 18th?\n18      Q    -- 18th, yeah.\n19      A    Well, we went to the park.  We got on the,\n20 me and my daughter got on the rides.  We got on the\n21 rides until it was time for the, almost time for the\n22 parade to start.\nJA86\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 87 of 1384\nPage 54\n1           There also was, if I recall, a character\n2 that was there that was taking pictures with other\n3 people too, so we decided to try to take a picture\n4 with her, with one of the characters, and the lady\n5 said it was closed.  So as we walked away there\n6 was -- we just seen other people taking -- other\n7 people getting in line, somebody else getting in\n8 line, a Caucasian family getting in line, and I\n9 didn't say anything.\n10           So we proceeded to walk to the parade to\n11 try to get there early because it will be crowded,\n12 and so we got on -- when we got on in the crowd, you\n13 know, the parade started and Ernie, I guess Ernie\n14 was the first one, and I guess that's the -- I don't\n15 know the difference between Ernie and Barney, but I\n16 know I'm going to just say Ernie, okay.  He's\n17 dancing around and everything, slapping everybody\n18 high-fives.  K  right there reaching her hand\n19 out.  As she was reaching her hand out there's a\n20 family, there's a Caucasian family right here and\n21 there's a Caucasian family right here and there was\n22 a guy that's sitting, a little boy sitting right in\nJA87\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 88 of 1384\nPage 55\n1 front of her, and he gave everybody, greeted\n2 everybody else except my daughter and kept on\n3 walking down.\n4           Then, you know, she turned around and\n5 said, \"Daddy,\" you know, and she did it -- you know,\n6 I was like, \"Wait, wait, let's try to see if he come\n7 back.\"  So then the other character came and did the\n8 same thing, you know.  When they did it the second\n9 time and she turned to me and said, \"Daddy,\" you\n10 know, and it took a whole lot of energy in me not to\n11 just jump on that field, you know, because that's\n12 like a slap in the face to my daughter, you know,\n13 and to let that go I had to eat it all the way until\n14 we came home, you know.  And the only reason why I\n15 came back to that park the next day is because\n16 that's what she wanted to come but she didn't want\n17 to go back over there to the parade, you know.\n18           That hurts me, you know.  That really\n19 hurts me that Sesame Place tried to defend something\n20 that they can't really defend when they have a\n21 history of doing this, a history of discrimination.\n22 Before I went, before I went to the -- before I even\nJA88\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 89 of 1384\nPage 56\n1 called Malcolm, you know, I did a check on this\n2 place and they got a history of discrimination.\n3           So, you know, everybody have a job to do.\n4 Everybody have their own job to do.  You know,\n5 Sesame Street got their job.  Their job is to please\n6 families that comes into that park, you know.  My\n7 job as a father is to keep my daughter happy, and\n8 that day there I couldn't keep her happy except I\n9 had to just go and buy her some toys just to calm\n10 her down a little bit because that wasn't right.\n11      Q    Okay.  Let me follow up on some of the\n12 things that you told me.  That first day that you\n13 were there on June 18th, that was summertime?\n14      A    Yes.\n15      Q    Okay.  Was the park crowded that day?\n16      A    Yes.\n17           MR. HARRIS:  Object to form.  You can\n18      answer.\n19 BY MS. PARDO:\n20      Q    And do you remember around the time that\n21 you left that day?\n22      A    I don't remember what time I left that\nJA89\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 90 of 1384\nPage 59\n1      daughter that's impossible, because you bent\n2      down to a grown man and a child sitting on the\n3      ground --\n4           MS. PARDO:  Okay.\n5           THE WITNESS:  -- you know, and one of the\n6      things I don't understand and believe is that\n7      you can bounce up and down the road and you got\n8      to watch where you're going, so how could you\n9      not see where you -- how you know there was\n10      somebody in front of, you can trip.  So when it\n11      come to saying that they haven't, they didn't\n12      see my daughter I want to say that's bullshit.\n13      That's impossible.  How you get -- you know,\n14      that's just like I'm getting up and walking out\n15      I'm going to watch where I'm going.  So if I'm\n16      coming to you, you're going to see who's in\n17      front of you.\n18           So my daughter's right there reaching\n19      right on top of this man's head and that\n20      child's head and you just go by past and you\n21      just slap one right here, here and here and\n22      then kept going, and not once, but twice.\nJA90\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 91 of 1384\nPage 60\n1 BY MS. PARDO:\n2      Q    Okay.  So what I'm understanding, and\n3 correct me if I'm wrong, so there was like -- your\n4 daughter was kind of like in the second row of\n5 people, there was somebody in front?\n6      A    Yeah, there was just somebody sitting\n7 down.\n8      Q    Sitting in front of her?\n9      A    Sitting right there in front of her and\n10 she's standing right on top of the head.\n11      Q    And she's standing right behind?\n12      A    Yeah.\n13      Q    And where were you standing?\n14      A    Right behind her.\n15      Q    Right behind her, okay.\n16           Was she standing the whole time?\n17      A    Yes.\n18      Q    Okay.  A minute -- you said in your\n19 testimony that they said that they didn't see her.\n20 Who are you referring to?\n21      A    Well, I'm talking about Sesame Place.\n22      Q    Okay.  What did Sesame Place say --\nJA91\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 92 of 1384\nPage 62\n1      A    -- because she was right, like directly\n2 right there.\n3      Q    But the statement you're referring to,\n4 that was referring to some other kid; is that right?\n5      A    No, that's not referring to other kids,\n6 that's the statement that they making that these\n7 characters can't see.\n8      Q    Okay.  Okay.  I understand what you're\n9 saying.\n10      A    Yeah.\n11      Q    Okay.  I want to go back to -- okay.\n12           All right.  You mentioned that you had\n13 heard of a history of discrimination.  Can you tell\n14 me what you had --\n15      A    I read a couple of years ago when there\n16 was a discrimination lawsuit settled out of court\n17 for some other family, a Muslim family.  That's the\n18 only statement I'm just going to give here.\n19      Q    That's what you're referring to when you\n20 said a history of discrimination?\n21      A    Yeah.\n22      Q    Okay.  Anything else that you're referring\nJA92\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 93 of 1384\nPage 63\n1 to that made you conclude that?\n2      A    And the things that happened to them two\n3 little girls.\n4      Q    Okay.  And what do you -- what two little\n5 girls are you referring to?\n6      A    The two little girls that -- I don't know\n7 that character with the wings, where they ignored\n8 them two little six-year-old girls.\n9      Q    Okay.  And was this a video that you had\n10 seen online?\n11      A    Yeah, on TV.\n12      Q    Do you know if the girls you're referring\n13 to are a part of the Brown family?\n14      A    I guess that's what their name was.\n15      Q    Okay.  Have you ever spoken to anyone from\n16 the family?\n17      A    I don't know them.\n18      Q    Okay.  Have you ever spoken to any lawyers\n19 that represent that family?\n20      A    I don't know them.\n21      Q    Now, you mentioned that -- you mentioned\n22 this experience that happened to you at the parade.\nJA93\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 94 of 1384\nPage 66\n1      A    No, that's it.\n2      Q    Now, for those characters you had said in\n3 the Complaint that they intentionally refused to\n4 perform the contract by refusing to engage with them\n5 and ignoring them.  Does that sound familiar to you?\n6      A    It sounds familiar.\n7      Q    Okay.  What make -- what made you think,\n8 or what makes you think, that the character\n9 intentionally ignored K ?\n10      A    Because they walked right by her where she\n11 was directly right there.\n12      Q    Okay.  And it's your testimony that the\n13 characters saw K ?\n14      A    Yes.\n15      Q    Okay.  What makes you think the characters\n16 saw K ?\n17      A    It's impossible to miss her.  She's\n18 standing right there next to the person that she\n19 gave, that they gave a high-five to, shook their\n20 hands.\n21      Q    Okay.  Do you have any way of knowing what\n22 the line of sight is for a performer that is wearing\nJA94\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 95 of 1384\nPage 67\n1 that character's outfit?\n2      A    No, I don't.\n3      Q    Okay.  All right.  I'm going to turn your\n4 attention to -- let me say one other thing.  Let me\n5 ask one other thing in follow-up.  After the parade\n6 was over, and I think you said it was like a 2 or 3\n7 p.m. parade --\n8      A    Something like that.\n9      Q    -- what did you do after the parade in\n10 terms of --\n11      A    I took my daughter --\n12      Q    -- activities or things?\n13      A    I took my daughter to the park.  I mean\n14 not to the park, to the store, the gift shop.\n15      Q    Gift shop, okay.\n16           And you said you did that to calm her\n17 down?\n18      A    Yes.\n19      Q    How was she acting at that period of time?\n20      A    She was crying.\n21      Q    She was crying?\n22      A    Yes.\nJA95\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 96 of 1384\nPage 68\n1      Q    Was she saying anything to you at the\n2 time?\n3      A    She asked me why -- she gave me a question\n4 that I couldn't answer of why they didn't, why they\n5 didn't shake her hand.\n6      Q    Okay.  What was your response?\n7      A    I couldn't respond to her, that's the\n8 whole thing.  What could you say to a child of why\n9 unless you're going to lie to her.  I didn't want to\n10 tell her because they're racist.  I don't teach my\n11 kid that.  I teach my kid to get along with\n12 everybody, you know.  When I take my daughter to\n13 parks I teach her to get along with Blacks, Whites\n14 and Puerto Ricans that be at that park.\n15           So to say, to tell her, tell that to her\n16 and then she wind up interacting with somebody\n17 that's not her race then she might treat them\n18 different, that means I'm raising her wrong.  What\n19 can I say to her?\n20      Q    So you didn't have a response for her, is\n21 what you're telling me?\n22      A    No, I couldn't.  I said, \"Just come on and\nJA96\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 97 of 1384\nPage 69\n1 get you some toys,\" that's all I could say.\n2      Q    Okay.  And it's your testimony that the\n3 characters in the parade were interacting with White\n4 children but not with Black children?\n5      A    Yes.\n6      Q    Okay.  How many times did you see that\n7 happen in the parade?\n8      A    Well, it happened to me.\n9      Q    Okay.\n10      A    And to me that happened twice.  I could\n11 have just said three times when I seen, when they\n12 said that the line was closed.  So I'm, I'm not\n13 going to just say that's what they did because I'm\n14 assuming that they told me the line was closed for a\n15 picture but then I see another family on line.  So\n16 anything -- it could have been -- they could have\n17 just walked away and come back and said, you know,\n18 held the line for them, but I know they told me it\n19 was closed.\n20      Q    Okay.  So let's talk about that incident a\n21 little bit more.  In your interrogatory answer you\n22 had said that you were walking through the park\nJA97\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 98 of 1384\nPage 70\n1 headed for the parade.\n2      A    Um-hum.\n3      Q    And you decided to stop and try to join\n4 the line; is that right?\n5      A    Yeah.\n6      Q    Do you remember what character that was\n7 that you were trying to stop to meet and greet?\n8      A    No, I don't remember.\n9      Q    Okay.  And do you remember what time of\n10 day it was?\n11      A    It was just before the parade was ready to\n12 start.  I know that it was before the parade was\n13 ready to start.  I mean the parade didn't start\n14 right away, I just wanted to get over there early.\n15 So it could have been in between times --\n16      Q    Okay.\n17      A    -- before the parade started.\n18      Q    Do you have any sense of where you were in\n19 the park --\n20      A    No.\n21      Q    -- where you had stopped to try to do\n22 this?\nJA98\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 99 of 1384\nPage 71\n1      A    No.\n2      Q    Like what ride was nearby or anything like\n3 that?\n4      A    No.\n5      Q    All right.  Was the meet and greet that\n6 you referred to in your interrogatory answer close\n7 to the parade location?\n8      A    Repeat that.\n9      Q    Was this meet and greet that you describe\n10 in your answer --\n11      A    Was it close to the parade?\n12      Q    Yeah, was it close to the parade route.\n13      A    I don't know.  It's a confusing park.\n14 It's a big park, so I don't --\n15      Q    Okay.  You don't recall where you were in\n16 the park?\n17      A    No.\n18      Q    Now, had K  said she wanted to meet\n19 that particular character?\n20      A    No, I just wanted -- no, she didn't say\n21 that.  I just seen that, I seen that people were\n22 taking pictures and I wanted her to meet them,\nJA99\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 100 of 1384\nPage 72\n1 but --\n2      Q    Okay.  And so there was a line that was\n3 there to meet the character?\n4      A    There was a short line.  It was a short\n5 line.\n6      Q    You mentioned that you were told that the\n7 line was closed; is that right?\n8      A    Yeah.\n9      Q    Now, who told you that?\n10      A    The White lady that was on the, that was\n11 in charge.\n12      Q    Okay.  Was this somebody who was like\n13 escorting the character or with the character?\n14      A    I believe they all had escorts.\n15      Q    Okay.  Male or female?\n16      A    Female.\n17      Q    Female.\n18           Race?\n19      A    Caucasian.\n20      Q    Okay.  Remember this woman's hair color at\n21 all?\n22      A    I don't remember.  I don't know.\nJA100\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 101 of 1384\nPage 73\n1      Q    Can you estimate the age?\n2      A    No.\n3      Q    Was it someone that you thought was like a\n4 teenager?\n5      A    No, the only time I pay attention to a\n6 woman I'm trying to talk to them.  I don't remember.\n7      Q    Okay.  Now, did that employee -- so you\n8 say the employee said that the line was closed.  Did\n9 the employee say anything else to you?\n10      A    No, that's it, so I just walked away.\n11      Q    Okay.  Did they let you know that you\n12 could come back at a later time --\n13      A    No.\n14      Q    -- for the next one --\n15      A    No.\n16      Q    -- anything like that?\n17      A    No.\n18      Q    Okay.  Now, you then came to believe that\n19 the line actually wasn't closed?\n20      A    Yeah, when I looked back and I seen\n21 somebody that wasn't there before.\n22      Q    And describe to me who got in the line\nJA101\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 102 of 1384\nPage 74\n1 after you were told it was closed.\n2      A    A White family.\n3      Q    Excuse me?\n4      A    A Caucasian family.\n5      Q    Okay.  Do you remember how big the family\n6 was?\n7      A    No.\n8      Q    Okay.  Male, female?\n9      A    It was family, a mother, a father and\n10 children.\n11      Q    Okay.  Now, you described them as a\n12 Caucasian family; is that right?\n13      A    Yes.\n14      Q    Okay.  Do you know if they were Hispanic\n15 or not?\n16      A    I don't know, but their skin color was\n17 just lighter than mine's, so I --\n18      Q    Okay.  So you assumed they were Caucasian?\n19      A    Yeah.\n20      Q    Now, did you do anything after you were\n21 told the line was closed and you saw --\n22      A    No, I was heading --\nJA102\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 103 of 1384\nPage 75\n1      Q    -- this family?\n2      A    No, I was just heading to the parade.\n3      Q    Okay.  So you didn't walk over and talk to\n4 the escort and ask why?\n5      A    No.\n6      Q    Did you think it was a big deal at the\n7 time?\n8      A    I didn't want to make it a big deal at the\n9 time.\n10      Q    Okay.  And you wanted to get a good spot\n11 at the parade?\n12      A    I just wanted my daughter to be happy,\n13 that was our day, not to, not to -- I didn't go\n14 looking for trouble, you know.  I just wanted a good\n15 time with my daughter, that's all.\n16      Q    Now, how did you know that the parade was\n17 going to start at 3?\n18      A    There's a sign that says that.\n19      Q    Sign.\n20           Did you also see on the sign the list of\n21 times that there would be meet and greets around the\n22 park --\nJA103\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 104 of 1384\nPage 78\n1      do they try to get there first so they can be\n2      first or second in line so they get to touch\n3      them, because that's what they do.  I mean\n4      there's -- and we happened to get -- we got\n5      there early enough to be like standing right\n6      there second, you know, because there's --\n7 BY MS. PARDO:\n8      Q    So you guys were second in line?\n9      A    Yeah, there's people -- no, she was -- the\n10 guy was sitting down so K  would be able to get\n11 a handshake too, and that's what -- he did that\n12 purposely, you know what I mean.  So they just, they\n13 just walked away from my daughter, that's the only\n14 thing I can say.\n15      Q    Okay.  Now, the characters in the parade,\n16 were they performing dance routines as they went by?\n17           MR. HARRIS:  Object to form.  You can\n18      answer.\n19           THE WITNESS:  Yeah, they were all dancing.\n20 BY MS. PARDO:\n21      Q    Okay.  And the characters, did they have\n22 moments where they like stood still and danced, or\nJA104\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 105 of 1384\nPage 79\n1 were they constantly in motion going by?\n2           MR.

PARDO:\n8      Q    Okay.  In the Complaint you had stated\n9 that Elmo had refused to engage and ignored K ;\n10 is that correct?\n11      A    Yes.\n12      Q    Okay.  So can you explain for me the\n13 incident that happened with Elmo?\n14      A    Yes.\n15      Q    Okay.\n16      A    As he was, as he was dancing he looked our\n17 way and he came towards our way.  My daughter was\n18 looking all excited and happy because he was\n19 looking, coming towards our way, and then he greeted\n20 people to the left, one of the, the guy that was\n21 sitting down on the ground, and the other person\n22 that was standing right on the, to the right --\nJA105\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 106 of 1384\nPage 80\n1      Q    Okay.\n2      A    -- and he didn't greet her.\n3      Q    Okay.  Do you have any video of Elmo\n4 not --\n5      A    Yes.\n6      Q    -- greeting your daughter?\n7      A    Yes.\n8      Q    Okay.  Did you give that to us in this\n9 case?\n10      A    Yes.\n11      Q    In your line of sight how many people\n12 would you estimate were at the parade?\n13      A    You mean through the whole parade, the\n14 whole -- it was just crowded.\n15      Q    Just as far as you could see.\n16      A    There was a lot.\n17      Q    Was it like more than 100?\n18      A    Could have been.\n19      Q    Okay.  It wasn't ten?\n20      A    No.  In that case we would have been\n21 sitting up front.\n22      Q    Okay.  And when Elmo didn't engage with\nJA106\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 107 of 1384\nPage 82\n1      Q    So is it your testimony that Elmo ignored\n2 K , but didn't ignore the nearby White child?\n3      A    Yes.\n4      Q    Okay.  And do you remember what kind of\n5 interaction Elmo gave the White child nearby?\n6      A    Shook his hand.\n7      Q    Shook a hand?\n8      A    (Nods head up and down.)\n9      Q    Is this the kid in front that was sitting,\n10 or somebody else?\n11      A    Somebody else.\n12      Q    Okay.  To the right or the left?\n13      A    The right.\n14      Q    Okay.  Do you have any idea if that child\n15 you're referring to that got the attention to the\n16 right is White?\n17      A    They were White, because it was, it was an\n18 adult sitting with a little baby.\n19      Q    Okay.  What about to the left, did Elmo\n20 interact with anyone to the left?\n21      A    Yes.\n22      Q    Okay.  And describe to me the race of the\nJA107\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 108 of 1384\nPage 83\n1 person to the left.\n2      A    She was White.\n3      Q    Okay.  How do you know she wasn't\n4 Hispanic?\n5      A    I didn't ask.  I'm sorry, I just didn't\n6 ask, you know.\n7      Q    Okay.  All right.  And you said you have\n8 video of this incident?\n9      A    Yes.\n10      Q    Do you have any still photos, like you\n11 just took a picture?\n12      A    No.\n13      Q    When Elmo ignored your daughter, did you\n14 say anything to K  as to why that might have\n15 happened --\n16      A    No.\n17      Q    -- at the time?\n18      A    No, I didn't say anything to her.\n19      Q    Okay.  If Elmo had interacted with a\n20 Hispanic child instead of K , would you\n21 consider that to be racial discrimination?\n22      A    I wouldn't --\nJA108\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 109 of 1384\nPage 89\n1      A    Okay.\n2      Q    Just thinking about Ernie in the parade.\n3      A    All right.  Ernie, that's -- Ernie, is\n4 that the same -- I think it was -- what monster was\n5 we talking about before I left out of here?\n6      Q    We were talking about Elmo.\n7      A    All right.  Elmo is not the one that\n8 didn't engage with her, it was Ernie and the\n9 monster.\n10      Q    Okay.\n11      A    So everything I said about -- and that's\n12 why I got confused.\n13      Q    Okay.\n14      A    Everything I said about --\n15      Q    You had in mind Telly instead of Elmo; is\n16 that correct?\n17      A    No, actually I thought you was talking\n18 about Ernie.  See when --\n19      Q    Well, why --\n20      A    It's the Cookie Monster.  I mean it's\n21 Ernie.\n22      Q    Okay.  Well, let me take you to this.\nJA109\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 110 of 1384\nPage 91\n1      A    Yes.\n2      Q    I want to know what was it that Elmo did,\n3 and then the same for each character.\n4      A    All right.\n5      Q    Just break it down for me, if you can.\n6      A    Well, one of the -- let's see.  It could\n7 be Abby Cadabby or Elmo is the one that didn't, that\n8 didn't -- about the line, they was the ones on the\n9 line.\n10      Q    Okay.  Okay.  So when we talked before\n11 about trying to join the line for the meet and\n12 greet --\n13      A    I couldn't remember the characters.\n14      Q    -- you think that that might be been Elmo\n15 or Abby?\n16      A    It could have been Abby.\n17      Q    Okay.  All right.  What do you recall with\n18 respect to Elmo?\n19      A    I don't know.  I didn't -- the only one I\n20 have on film is Ernie and Telly Monster.\n21      Q    You have Ernie and Telly Monster on film,\n22 okay.\nJA110\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 111 of 1384\nPage 92\n1           All right.  And the reason why I'm trying\n2 to understand is that you have allegations that that\n3 particular character intentionally discriminated, so\n4 this is why understanding which character you're\n5 suing about is important.\n6      A    The ones, yeah, the ones that I'm suing\n7 about that I got proof of is Ernie and Telly\n8 Monster.\n9      Q    Ernie and Telly.\n10           And you're not sure --\n11      A    Abby Cadabby is the one that they said the\n12 line was closed --\n13      Q    Okay.\n14      A    -- and Elmo I don't -- I just -- I\n15 probably just seen him like ignoring people too.  So\n16 I mean I can't prove that, so I'm not going to speak\n17 on something I can't talk about.\n18      Q    Okay.  But you included --\n19      A    I'm not going to speak on something that,\n20 you know.\n21      Q    Sure, but you included Elmo in the\n22 Complaint, so that's --\nJA111\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 112 of 1384\nPage 93\n1      A    Okay.\n2      Q    -- why I just want to understand --\n3      A    Okay.\n4      Q    -- the basis for that.\n5      A    Okay.\n6           MR. HARRIS:  Object to form.  You can\n7      answer.\n8           MS. PARDO:  All right.  So --\n9           (Telephonic interruption.)\n10           THE WITNESS:  That's me.  I am so sorry.\n11           MS. PARDO:  That's okay.\n12           THE WITNESS:  I am so sorry, go ahead.\n13 BY MS. PARDO:\n14      Q    Okay.  So just to close out Elmo, there's\n15 nothing else you can remember specifically about\n16 Elmo and what he did --\n17      A    No.\n18      Q    -- that was discriminatory?\n19           Okay.  And then Abby was the one we\n20 thought was in the line.\n21      A    Yes.\n22      Q    Sitting here today, can you remember any\nJA112\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 113 of 1384\nPage 94\n1 of the colors or features of the Abby costume?\n2      A    That's the one with the wings, if I'm not\n3 mistaken.\n4      Q    Wings, okay.\n5           All right.  All right.  So turning your\n6 attention to the parade, back to the parade, when\n7 the characters ignored your daughter can you tell me\n8 everything that K  said, if she had any\n9 comments when that happened?\n10      A    Yes, after, after that happened she turned\n11 to me and said, \"Daddy,\" on the first, on the first\n12 character that ignored her, which is Ernie, and then\n13 when Telly Monster did it, you know, that really,\n14 that really upsetted her and that really upsetted me\n15 too.\n16      Q    And you think the Ernie incident happened\n17 before Telly?\n18      A    Yeah.\n19      Q    Okay.  And this was upsetting to her?\n20      A    Very upsetting to her.\n21      Q    And what was the effect that that had on\n22 you?\nJA113\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 114 of 1384\nPage 95\n1      A    It had -- there's a -- it got me to the\n2 point the only thing that saved me from jumping over\n3 that line was my daughter, you know.  And like I\n4 said to you before that that was like a slap in a\n5 child -- that's just like slapping my daughter in\n6 the face and me not doing anything about it.  I felt\n7 vulnerable.  I felt like, you know, I walked away\n8 from something, that I couldn't defend my daughter.\n9 That's how it made me feel, you know.\n10      Q    Tell me why you decided to go back the\n11 next day.\n12      A    Because --\n13           MR. HARRIS:  Object to form.  You can\n14      answer.\n15           THE WITNESS:  I went back the next day\n16      because she wanted to continue to get on the\n17      rides, but she did not want to go to the -- she\n18      did not want to go over there where the parade\n19      was.\n20 BY MS.

You can\n17      answer.\n18           THE WITNESS:  She's still -- it's still\n19      affecting her a little bit as I see -- they\n20      had, they had, they had Black History Month and\n21      the teacher was speaking about racism, and mind\n22      you before I get started with that two weeks\nJA115\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 116 of 1384\nPage 98\n1 K , she asked the students, \"Does anybody know\n2 what racism is?\"  One little boy blurted out, said,\n3 \"I do, Sesame Place,\" and she said the expression on\n4 K  face said a whole lot.  And I asked her,\n5 you know -- she didn't tell me, her teacher didn't\n6 tell me until -- she forgot to tell me when I came\n7 to pick up K , but the next, the following day\n8 that's when she came, \"Oh, yeah, I forget to tell\n9 you, you know, we had this session about racism and\n10 stuff like that and,\" she said, \"the expression on\n11 K  face after the little boy said that, you\n12 know, it was kind of really sad, you know.\"  And I\n13 asked her, you know, \"Please look out for K ,\n14 you know, please don't stop what you're doing in the\n15 class.  If you're going to have any sessions on\n16 Sesame Place, on Sesame Street in school, in the\n17 classroom, you know, please let me know, you know,\n18 what's going on with K ,\" and that's what she\n19 did.\n20      Q    Okay.  And you said this was around two\n21 weeks ago or so?\n22      A    Two weeks ago I told her teacher about it.\nJA116\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 117 of 1384\nPage 99\n1 She didn't know anything about what happened.\n2      Q    Okay.\n3      A    But being that when she was talking about\n4 racism and then somebody in the class brought up\n5 Sesame Place, she immediately looked at K  to\n6 see the expression of how she react.  I didn't tell\n7 her to do it, but she thought about what I told her\n8 and she immediately looked at K , and that's\n9 how that happened.\n10      Q    Okay.  And which teacher is this?\n11      A    That's her homeroom teacher, Ms. White.\n12      Q    Ms. White?\n13      A    Yeah.\n14      Q    Do you know her first name?\n15      A    No.\n16      Q    Okay.  In kindergarten they have more than\n17 one teacher?\n18      A    They have another teacher, Ms. Caldwell.\n19 Like she helps Ms. White out in the classroom --\n20      Q    Okay.\n21      A    -- you know what I mean.\n22      Q    All right.  Is K  doing well in\nJA117\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 118 of 1384\nPage 100\n1 school?\n2           MR. HARRIS:  Object to form.

So after that parade ended on\n8 June 18th, on that day did you regard yourself as\n9 having suffered discrimination?\n10      A    Yes.\n11           MR. HARRIS:  Object to form.  You can\n12      answer.\n13 BY MS. PARDO:\n14      Q    You did?\n15      A    Yeah.\n16      Q    Okay.  Why didn't you complain to Guest\n17 Services before you left the park that day?\n18      A    Because I know me.\n19      Q    What does that mean?\n20      A    I would have made a scene while I have my\n21 child with me, but, you know, I wasn't trying to get\n22 my daughter taken to jail, you know.  So I had to\nJA118\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 119 of 1384\nPage 107\n1      happened to look it up and they're saying they\n2      got a history of discrimination, that's what\n3      made me pursue an attorney.\n4 BY MS. PARDO:\n5      Q    What do you mean when you say you were\n6 being talked to about it?\n7      A    Well, me and her mother always were\n8 discussing what could we do about it, could we\n9 did -- could we sue them, don't go to the, stay away\n10 from the park or, you know, these different things.\n11      Q    Okay.  If you hadn't heard about that\n12 incident with the two little girls and seen that on,\n13 seen their video, would you have contacted a lawyer?\n14      A    I couldn't say.\n15      Q    Have you returned to Sesame Place since\n16 your visit in June of 2022?\n17      A    No.\n18      Q    Okay.

Now, you had called our attention\n12 to Abby Cadabby before.  She during this whole clip\n13 appears to be standing still in the middle of the\n14 street.\n15      A    Um-hum.\n16      Q    So are you saying that Abby during this\n17 clip ignored your daughter?\n18      A    No.\n19      Q    Okay.  Your allegations about Abby were\n20 just in that meet and greet in the park?\n21      A    Yeah, that was just that, yeah.\n22      Q    Did you think it was possible there for\nJA120\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 121 of 1384\nPage 121\n1      A    No.\n2           MR.

And is it your testimony that Ernie\n17 intentionally ignored K ?\n18      A    Yes.\n19      Q    Okay.  What makes you think that Ernie\n20 intentionally ignored her?\n21      A    Because she was standing right there and\n22 gave everybody else a five, or shook everybody else\nJA121\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 122 of 1384\nPage 122\n1 hand.\n2      Q    Is it possible that Ernie didn't see your\n3 daughter?\n4      A    No, he seen her, if you seen everybody\n5 else standing up.\n6      Q    Do you know where that Ernie character\n7 sees out of that costume?\n8      A    I don't know what he sees at, but I know\n9 he seen everybody else.\n10      Q    Okay.

What\n8 does loud mean to you in that context?\n9      A    Loud means when we can't hear each other\n10 talk.  Like if we talking now, if that music was on\n11 blasting like crazy, you know, you got to read your\n12 lips.\n13      Q    Earlier in your testimony you had talked\n14 about a nearby White child that got an interaction\n15 with a costume character that had ignored K .\n16 Do you remember that testimony?\n17      A    Um-hum.\n18      Q    Were there any adults that got interaction\n19 with the same characters who ignored K ?\n20      A    Yes.\n21      Q    Could you tell us about that, please.\n22      A    Well, when Ernie -- Ernie gave five to\nJA124\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 125 of 1384\nPage 165\n1 four people that I counted, and two of them as\n2 adults.\n3      Q    Were those White adults?\n4      A    Yeah, White adults.\n5      Q    In your testimony earlier you mentioned\n6 that one of the White families nearby you had a\n7 little baby.

PARDO:  Objection to the form.\n9           THE WITNESS:  I does everything my\n10      daughter wants me to do, so if she just -- if\n11      she wants to go back I would take her anywhere\n12      she want to go.\n13 BY MR. HARRIS:\n14      Q    Earlier you testified that you assumed\n15 that the issue with getting into the line was\n16 discrimination.  Why do you assume that?\n17      A    Say it again one more time.\n18      Q    When you say that you assumed that being\n19 told the line was closed was because of racism, what\n20 made -- why do you assume that?\n21      A    That she said why the line was closed?\n22      Q    Yes.\nJA126\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 127 of 1384\nPage 168\n1      A    Oh, why I assumed why she said that?\n2      Q    Yes.\n3      A    Because I just went by what she told me.\n4 She said the line was closed, and then when I\n5 happened to look back, you know, and I seen\n6 another -- I'm sorry.  He was asking the questions,\n7 so I was looking at him.\n8      Q    No, no, you're talking to the camera.\n9      A    Sorry.\n10      Q    No worries.\n11      A    I assumed that she -- when she told me the\n12 line was closed I assumed that it was really closed\n13 because it was getting close to them going back in,\n14 or something like that, I don't know, but --\n15      Q    Sure.\n16      A    -- I just walked away.\n17      Q    And then what made you think that she was\n18 being racist when she told you the line was closed?\n19      A    Well, I didn't think about -- I didn't\n20 think about that until after the incident with the\n21 handshake --\n22      Q    Okay.\nJA127\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 128 of 1384\nPage 169\n1      A    -- at the parade.  So then when I went\n2 home and put all that together I figured that's\n3 probably why they did that to me, you know.  That's\n4 what made me just put the pieces together.\n5      Q    Okay.\n6      A    It's like -- never mind.\n7      Q    Go ahead.\n8      A    I don't know, I just played naive just for\n9 that one moment.\n10      Q    Okay.  So at the time that you saw the\n11 White family being let in, you didn't yet think it\n12 was racism?\n13      A    Just being naive.  I just thought about --\n14 I didn't think about it until I put everything\n15 together and I'm like, well, you know.\n16      Q    And sitting here today when you think\n17 about the line incident, you do think it's racism;\n18 correct?\n19      A    Now I think it was in addition to the\n20 racism, yeah.\n21      Q    And why do you think today that that was\n22 racism?\nJA128\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 129 of 1384\nPage 170\n1      A    Because of the incidents.  Because of\n2 everything that's going on right now.\n3      Q    If that individual did not let a White\n4 family in after telling you that the line was\n5 closed, would you think it was racism?\n6      A    No, I wouldn't have thought about it.\n7      Q    Do you remember being, talking about\n8 specifically Telly Monster and if you thought that\n9 he was able to interact with everyone?\n10      A    Yeah.\n11      Q    And you said -- do you remember what you\n12 said with that question?\n13      A    No.\n14      Q    But regardless, did you think it was\n15 possible for Telly Monster to interact with K\n16 at that time?\n17      A    Yes.\n18      Q    So there were -- as I understand it now,\n19 you were there for two days.

PARDO:\n4      Q    Why is that?\n5      A    Because Doniesha told me to transfer the\n6 money to her via Cash App and she secured the\n7 payment for these tickets.\n8      Q    Okay.  So so that I understand how this\n9 occurred, Doniesha purchased the tickets online; is\n10 that correct?\n11      A    Yes.\n12      Q    Okay.

You can answer.\n8           THE WITNESS:  No.\n9 BY MS. PARDO:\n10      Q    Now, I believe in your interrogatory\n11 answers you had indicated that you received a\n12 promotional deal for the tickets.  Do you recall\n13 making that statement?\n14      A    Yes, but that wasn't pertaining to this\n15 purchase.\n16      Q    Okay.\n17      A    We -- I purchased more tickets the same\n18 day.\n19      Q    Oh, okay.  So tell me about that purchase.\n20      A    There was like a promotion thing going on.\n21 I don't, I don't want to quote like the wrong\n22 numbers, but it was like each ticket was like at a\nJA153\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 154 of 1384\nPage 67\n1 discounted rate.\n2      Q    Okay.\n3      A    And at the time we were there with just\n4 O  because the other kids were in Virginia --\n5      Q    Okay.\n6      A    -- and we wanted to bring the other kids\n7 back for, you know, to, you know, enjoy Sesame\n8 Place, so we purchased tickets while we were there.\n9      Q    Oh, so did you purchase tickets at the\n10 park that day?\n11      A    No, it was like a, kind of like -- it was\n12 like on their like online.\n13           MR.

RUFF:  -- or were you located at the\n18      park when you purchased those tickets?\n19           MS. PARDO:  Well, I'm going to try to\n20      break that down a little bit.\n21           MR. RUFF:  Thanks.\n22 BY MS. PARDO:\nJA154\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 155 of 1384\nPage 68\n1      Q    So we have this purchase that we're\n2 talking about that Doniesha made online for three\n3 tickets; correct?\n4      A    Um-hum.  Correct.\n5      Q    Okay.  But you're saying that same day you\n6 made a separate purchase of tickets; is that right?\n7      A    Yes.\n8      Q    Okay.  And was that a purchase that you\n9 made online?\n10      A    Yes, that was online.  It wasn't at a\n11 concession stand or anything, so.\n12      Q    Okay.  And did you physically make that\n13 purchase or did Doniesha?\n14      A    It was the same process.  Doniesha found\n15 it, and she told me how much to send her through\n16 Cash App so she could secure payment for the\n17 tickets.\n18      Q    Okay.  And how many tickets were\n19 purchased?\n20      A    Six.\n21      Q    Six.\n22           And do you recall the price of the\nJA155\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 156 of 1384\nPage 69\n1 tickets?\n2      A    Not each one.  I'd say the grand total\n3 with fees and maybe a parking pass was probably in\n4 the ballpark of 250.\n5      Q    Okay.  And were those -- the tickets that\n6 you're speaking of, the six tickets, were they to\n7 return for a particular day?\n8      A    It may have been for like a particular\n9 date, or we might have got a chance to pick certain\n10 dates, but I know the tickets were discounted and\n11 they were only like -- there was like a holiday\n12 promotion that you can only like lock that price in\n13 that day.\n14      Q    Okay.  So that's why you made a second\n15 transaction on that day?\n16      A    Yes.\n17      Q    Okay.  Do you have the purchase summary\n18 for those six tickets that you recall purchasing?\n19      A    I'm not 100 percent sure if I have the\n20 purchase summary, but I know I got a refund for\n21 those tickets.\n22      Q    Okay.  Tell me how that purchase of the\nJA156\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 157 of 1384\nPage 70\n1 six tickets was made.  Was that with a credit card?\n2      A    I'm not 100 percent sure.  I know she told\n3 me how much to send her through Cash App.  So I'm\n4 not sure if it was like on my credit card or if it\n5 was on her debit card, I'm not 100 percent sure.\n6      Q    Okay.  Now, we had requested that you\n7 produce records that you have of all of your ticket\n8 purchases to SeaWorld, to Sesame Place.  So did you\n9 search for this particular purchase in connection\n10 with your obligations to provide documents to us?\n11      A    Could you rephrase that?\n12      Q    So did you make a search of your records\n13 to find purchase records related to this six\n14 tickets?\n15      A    Are you asking like in general, or for\n16 today?\n17      Q    Well, you were asked to produce records in\n18 this case; is that right?\n19      A    Yes.\n20      Q    Okay.  And you produced records that\n21 related to your July 4th visit; is that correct?\n22      A    Yes.\nJA157\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 158 of 1384\nPage 75\n1      A    No, she didn't have to print anything.\n2 It's all, it's all on your phone.\n3      Q    Okay.  And do you know whether Doniesha\n4 printed out anything from the Sesame Place website\n5 prior to your visit on July 4th?\n6      A    Pertaining to?\n7      Q    Anything.\n8      A    No.\n9      Q    Okay.  Mr. Fleming, are you aware that one\n10 of the claims in your lawsuit is based on a contract\n11 that you had with SeaWorld?\n12      A    Yes.\n13      Q    Did you yourself have a contract with\n14 SeaWorld for the visit to Sesame Place at issue?\n15           MR.

PARDO:  Yeah.\n3 BY MS. PARDO:\n4      Q    So what is it that you were supposed to\n5 get from SeaWorld, or Sesame Place related to that\n6 contract?\n7           MR. RUFF:  Same objection, but you can\n8      answer.\n9           THE WITNESS:  I mean the same experience\n10      that everybody else would assume that they\n11      would get; a fun, family-oriented, happy time.\n12 BY MS. PARDO:\n13      Q    So the nature of the contract that you're\n14 suing about, you paid money -- you or Doniesha paid\n15 money for a ticket on your, on your behalf; right?\n16      A    Yes.\n17      Q    Okay.  And what were you supposed to\n18 receive in return?\n19           MR. RUFF:  Objection.

A family experience, a good time.  It\n6      was 4th of July.\n7 BY MS. PARDO:\n8      Q    Okay.  Well, I'm just trying to get to the\n9 nature of the contract, like when --\n10      A    Yeah, I wasn't trying to laugh at you.\n11 It's just that I felt like you asked the same thing\n12 three times.\n13      Q    Sometimes we do that.  I just would like\n14 to know if there are specifics of this contract that\n15 you were promised as part of your ticket purchase,\n16 that's what I'm trying to get to the bottom of.\n17      A    I mean it's Sesame Street.  I grew up on\n18 Sesame Street, so.  I wouldn't say nobody verbally\n19 promised anything, but, you know, it's like we all\n20 look forward to a magical time, a great experience\n21 with our kids, memories, things we can look back on,\n22 a good time.\nJA160\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 161 of 1384\nPage 78\n1      Q    Okay.  And you said nobody verbally\n2 promised you anything.  Did they promise you\n3 anything in writing?\n4           MR. RUFF:  Objection.  You can answer.\n5           THE WITNESS:  Without me reading the\n6      context of what's on their website, terms and\n7      conditions, I don't know.\n8 BY MS. PARDO:\n9      Q    Okay.  Because you didn't read any terms\n10 and conditions on the website; is that right?\n11           MR. RUFF:  Objection.  You can answer.\n12           THE WITNESS:  No, I didn't.  Not\n13      personally, no.\n14 BY MS. PARDO:\n15      Q    If you can turn back to the Complaint, I\n16 want to go over to paragraph 48 on page 8.\n17      A    Mine doesn't go back that far.\n18      Q    I'm sorry, page 8 and the paragraph number\n19 is 48.  Do you see that?\n20      A    Yes.\n21      Q    And it states:  By the terms of the\n22 contract between the Flemings and SeaWorld,\nJA161\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 162 of 1384\nPage 79\n1 SeaWorld's costume character performers were\n2 obligated to not refuse to, on the basis of race\n3 interact with SeaWorld's customers including the\n4 Flemings.  Did I read that right?\n5      A    Yes.\n6      Q    And then it goes on to say:  Similarly,\n7 the Flemings were entitled to SeaWorld's performance\n8 of the contract by way of its costume character\n9 performers to interact with the Flemings.  Did I\n10 read that right?\n11      A    Yes.\n12      Q    Now, are you stating in this paragraph\n13 that you believed the costume characters were\n14 required to interact with your family?\n15           MR. RUFF:  Objection.  You can answer.\n16           THE WITNESS:  Personal interaction just\n17      like exclusive to us?\n18 BY MS. PARDO:\n19      Q    Yeah.\n20      A    No, not exclusive, no.\n21      Q    Okay.  So you didn't expect that you would\n22 have an interaction with a character one-on-one when\nJA162\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 163 of 1384\nPage 80\n1 you went to the park that day?\n2           MR.

You did expect that, okay.\n6           But you hadn't read anywhere that you were\n7 guaranteed to have that just by purchasing a ticket?\n8      A    I didn't read it myself personally, no.\n9      Q    Okay.  Did someone else read that?\n10      A    I'm not aware.  I'm not too sure.\n11      Q    Okay.  Do you know if Doniesha had read\n12 that somewhere before purchasing the ticket?\n13      A    I don't know.\n14      Q    And what type of personal interaction did\n15 you expect to have, you or O , at the park that\n16 day?\n17      A    Basic meet and greets.\n18      Q    And what is a basic meet and greet in your\n19 mind?\n20      A    Well, I've been to several different theme\n21 parks with my kids, so if you're asking me to define\n22 it I would say, you know, high-fives, waves,\nJA163\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 164 of 1384\nPage 81\n1 pictures.\n2      Q    Okay.  So on the July 4th visit day, did\n3 O  get any of those types of interactions that\n4 you just listed?\n5      A    Towards the conclusion of the parade.\n6      Q    Okay.  Can you tell me about that?\n7      A    Like the experience?\n8      Q    Yeah, that interaction in particular.\n9      A    I can't remember the character's name.  It\n10 has pigtails.\n11      Q    Okay.\n12      A    It's a female character.\n13      Q    Okay.\n14      A    After she was like rejected, or what I\n15 perceived to be rejected from the other like Telly\n16 Monster, like the bigger one, the robust one, the\n17 other one I kind of like, you know, kind of like\n18 nudged her to go and get like just a high-five.\n19 Like, you know, kids are -- she's five, she's like\n20 looking forward to like doing her thing, you know\n21 what I mean.\n22      Q    Right.\nJA164\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 165 of 1384\nPage 82\n1      A    So that was like -- that was the only\n2 interaction that she had from one of the characters.\n3      Q    Okay.  So she did have an interaction with\n4 a character on your visit on July 4th?\n5      A    Yeah, but it was almost forced.\n6           MS. PARDO:  Are we on 13?\n7           THE COURT REPORTER:  14.\n8           (Fleming Deposition Exhibit 14 was marked\n9      for identification and attached to the\n10      transcript.)\n11 BY MS.

In this interrogatory\n18 the question's above and then your answer comes\n19 below.  It asks:  For each visit you have made to\n20 Sesame Place in the last five years state, and then\n21 it goes through the different things we wanted you\n22 to state.\nJA166\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 167 of 1384\nPage 84\n1           If you go down to your answer do you see\n2 where under answer No. 1(b) you say:  Mr. Fleming\n3 does not recall when he purchased the tickets for\n4 10/25/19.  So you had gone on an earlier visit to\n5 Sesame Place; is that right?\n6      A    Yes.\n7      Q    Okay.  What do you recall about the\n8 October 25th, 2019, visit?\n9      A    All four of the kids were present, as well\n10 as Doniesha.  So as a family of six we were all\n11 there together.\n12      Q    And how was the -- how was that visit?\n13      A    It was Halloween time.  It was like a\n14 Halloween style.  Like everything at the park was\n15 like Halloween decorated.  So I can't remember if\n16 they were like doing candy or not, I'm not\n17 100 percent sure.  I don't know, that's a while ago.\n18 My kids do so much.  I mean overall like the kids\n19 enjoyed theirself.\n20      Q    Okay.  Did you experience any\n21 discrimination at the park when you visited in 2019?\n22      A    There was a lot less going on around that\nJA167\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 168 of 1384\nPage 85\n1 time.  It was cold, so, no, none that I was aware\n2 of.\n3      Q    Okay.  And you weren't able to find any\n4 purchase, documents that reflect that purchase for\n5 the Halloween tickets?\n6      A    Not a purchase.  Not for 2019, no.\n7      Q    If you go down to subsection (c) there,\n8 you can see the (c) part of your answer, it says:\n9 Mr. Fleming purchased the tickets on the morning of\n10 7/4/2022.  It was a promotional deal.  Do you see\n11 where I read that?\n12      A    Yes.\n13      Q    It's actually the fact that Doniesha\n14 Sanders purchased those tickets; is that right?\n15      A    Well, she made the physical purchase on\n16 her own, but we purchased them together.  We both\n17 were in agreement to buying the tickets and I\n18 transferred the money to her.\n19      Q    All right.  And then you'll see in\n20 subsection (f) on the next page at the top it says:\n21 Mr. Fleming purchased the tickets for 7/4/22 with a\n22 debit card.  Do you see that?\nJA168\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 169 of 1384\nPage 86\n1      A    Yes.\n2      Q    Okay.  Now, sitting here today do you\n3 still think it was a debit card?\n4      A    I don't know the last four digits of that\n5 card.  I'm not sure if that's mine's that she's an\n6 authorized user on or if that might be her personal\n7 debit, I'm not 100 percent sure.\n8      Q    Okay.  So you're not sure if this part of\n9 the answer is correct; is that right?\n10      A    It's correct to my knowledge.  It was\n11 purchased with a card.\n12      Q    Okay.  Put that to one side for just a\n13 minute if you will.\n14           MS. PARDO:  15.\n15           (Fleming Deposition Exhibit 15 was marked\n16      for identification and attached to the\n17      transcript.)\n18 BY MS. PARDO:\n19      Q    All right.  Mr. Fleming, I've handed you\n20 what's been marked as Fleming Exhibit 15.  Take a\n21 minute to look at that and tell me if you recognize\n22 this.\nJA169\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 170 of 1384\nPage 87\n1      A    Yes, this is our tickets for the park.\n2      Q    Okay.  And this was what you showed to\n3 gain entry to the park on July 4th; is that right?\n4      A    Yes.\n5      Q    And is there also -- on the last page was\n6 that your voucher for general parking?\n7      A    Yeah, general parking, yes.\n8      Q    All right.  So turn back to one of the\n9 tickets under -- you'll see the black box where it\n10 says Legal Terms.\n11      A    Any page?\n12      Q    Yeah.\n13      A    Yes.\n14      Q    Okay.  And take a look at that paragraph\n15 there for me and tell me where it says that you are\n16 entitled to interaction personally with a character.\n17           MR. RUFF:  Objection, but you can answer.\n18           THE WITNESS:  That does -- that's not\n19      specific.  That says to -- this is in regards\n20      to just the tickets.\n21 BY MS. PARDO:\n22      Q    Okay.  So are there any promises made\nJA170\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 171 of 1384\nPage 88\n1 under the Legal Terms portion that you just looked\n2 at that reference interactions with a costume\n3 character?\n4           MR. RUFF:  Objection.  You can answer.\n5           THE WITNESS:  For purchasing the tickets,\n6      the Legal Terms on it for these are for the\n7      tickets.\n8 BY MS. PARDO:\n9      Q    Okay.  So it doesn't mention anything\n10 about that, does it?\n11           MR. RUFF:  Objection to the form.  You can\n12      answer.\n13           THE WITNESS:  Are you asking does it\n14      mention that for your website in general, or\n15      are you asking just for these tickets?\n16 BY MS. PARDO:\n17      Q    Okay.  Well, right here in these Legal\n18 Terms is it mentioned?\n19           MR. RUFF:  Objection.  You can answer.\n20           THE WITNESS:  No, not pertaining to the\n21      tickets, it does not.\n22 BY MS. PARDO:\nJA171\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 172 of 1384\nPage 89\n1      Q    Okay.  So you made reference to the Sesame\n2 Place website as well; is that right?\n3      A    If asking you for clarification is a\n4 reference, yes.\n5      Q    Okay.  So is there a place on the website\n6 that says your ticket will guarantee an interaction\n7 with a costume character?\n8           MR. RUFF:  Objection.  You can answer.\n9           THE WITNESS:  I'm not 100 percent sure.\n10 BY MS. PARDO:\n11      Q    Okay.  Have you ever gone on the Sesame\n12 Place website?\n13      A    Other than to get a contact number for\n14 like to give Sesame Place a phone call, no.\n15      Q    Okay.  Prior to purchasing tickets for the\n16 7/4/2022 visit, did you go on the Sesame Place\n17 website?\n18      A    Not myself personally, no.\n19      Q    Okay.  Did Doniesha go on the Sesame Place\n20 website?\n21      A    I'm sure she did to purchase the tickets.\n22      Q    Okay.  But you don't know for sure?\nJA172\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 173 of 1384\nPage 90\n1      A    I'm not 100 percent certain.  I can't\n2 speak for her.\n3      Q    All right.  So turning back to that visit\n4 on July 4th, do you recall what time you arrived at\n5 the park?\n6           MS. PARDO:  Go off the record for a\n7      minute.\n8           MR. RUFF:  Can we go off the record?\n9           MS. PARDO:  Sure.\n10           THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 10:34, we\n11      are going off the record.\n12           (Recess 10:34-10:42 p.m.)\n13           (Mr. Harris and Ms. Yatsko are now\n14      present.)\n15           THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time now is 10:42,\n16      we are back on the record.  This is the\n17      beginning of Disc No. 2.\n18 BY MS. PARDO:\n19      Q    All right.  So I think before the break we\n20 were talking about, starting to talk about your\n21 visit to Sesame Place on July 4th.  Can you give me\n22 an idea of what time you arrived that day?\nJA173\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 174 of 1384\nPage 91\n1      A    Before lunchtime.\n2      Q    Okay.  And do you recall when you left?\n3      A    Between I'll say 6 and 7 maybe.  It was\n4 getting dark outside.\n5      Q    Do you remember what time the park closed\n6 that day?\n7      A    I'm not 100 percent sure, no.\n8      Q    Okay.  Was it getting dark between 6 and 7\n9 in July?\n10      A    When we were driving I want to say it was\n11 getting, it was getting dark.\n12      Q    Okay.  So in your words describe to me\n13 what happened at Sesame Place on July 4th, 2022,\n14 that you're suing about.\n15           MR. RUFF:  Objection to form.  You can\n16      answer.\n17           THE WITNESS:  Could you rephrase that,\n18      please.\n19           MS. PARDO:  Sure.\n20 BY MS. PARDO:\n21      Q    Tell me about your visit that's the basis\n22 of the lawsuit.  I'd like to know what your\nJA174\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 175 of 1384\nPage 92\n1 experience was like that day.\n2           MR. RUFF:  Same objection.  You can\n3      answer.\n4           THE WITNESS:  Well, up until the parade\n5      everything was fine, it was a good time.\n6 BY MS. PARDO:\n7      Q    Okay.  So are you suing about events that\n8 occurred during the parade?\n9      A    Yes.\n10      Q    Okay.  Tell me about that.  What's the\n11 basis of your lawsuit?\n12      A    The experience with the parade\n13 specifically?\n14      Q    Yeah, tell me about that in your own\n15 words.\n16      A    Well, there was probably at least like a\n17 15-minute period during the parade where I felt like\n18 O  was being overlooked, and what I mean by\n19 overlooked I mean as far as like basic waves,\n20 gestures, high-fives, and then up until the Telly\n21 Monster that's when I decided to start getting a\n22 little bit more proactive with, you know, asserting\nJA175\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 176 of 1384\nPage 93\n1 my role as her dad trying to like get the attention\n2 on her.\n3      Q    Do you recall the time of the parade?\n4      A    These aren't specifics because July was a\n5 long time away, so I'd say maybe, maybe 5.\n6      Q    Now, you mentioned about Telly Monster.\n7 Tell me about what happened with Telly Monster.\n8      A    Specifically to O ; right?\n9      Q    Sure, yes.\n10      A    Well, there was a period where I was, you\n11 know, signaling and recording and doing gestures and\n12 trying to like, you know, get the eye line on me to\n13 point towards O , which is what I was doing, and\n14 Telly Monster from what I perceived had her\n15 attention and he walked towards her, and soon as he\n16 got like within I'd say roughly 2 feet maybe he\n17 veered, in the video it would have been right but it\n18 would have been his left and he acknowledged an\n19 Asian kid and like kind of like brushed O  off\n20 and just kept walking, doing his routine.\n21      Q    You say he brushed O  off.  What do\n22 you mean by that?\nJA176\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 177 of 1384\nPage 94\n1      A    Like I said, he was walking towards her in\n2 her line of sight with his hand out and then he went\n3 this direction, which would have been his left but\n4 our right, and gave the high-five to the Asian kid,\n5 and on his return back towards the parade he kind of\n6 went like that, like flagged her down.  It wasn't\n7 like a double high-five or wasn't like a high-five\n8 this way, which would be like acknowledging both\n9 kids.  He kind of like turned and just brushed his\n10 hand back.\n11      Q    And you had mentioned before the phrase in\n12 her line of sight, and what you mean is -- what do\n13 you mean by that?\n14           MR. RUFF:  Objection.  You can answer.\n15           THE WITNESS:  What I mean by her line of\n16      sight is, you know, with the previous costume\n17      characters I was being dismissive thinking\n18      maybe they couldn't see.  So that's why I got\n19      proactive with being, you know, in dad mode and\n20      I'm like, all right, if you don't see them, or\n21      if you don't see her you're going to see me.\n22      So that's when I started kind of like, you\nJA177\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 178 of 1384\nPage 95\n1      know, jumping around and doing all the gestures\n2      and pointing at my daughter, and he visibly --\n3      you know, he's at least like at the time\n4      20 feet away from her when he looked her\n5      direction and started walking towards her.\n6 BY MS. PARDO:\n7      Q    Okay.  You mentioned that you weren't sure\n8 if other characters had seen O ; is that right?\n9           MR. RUFF:  Objection.  You can answer.\n10           THE WITNESS:  I was just giving the\n11      benefit of the doubt honestly, so, at that\n12      time.\n13 BY MS. PARDO:\n14      Q    You have no way of knowing exactly what\n15 each character can see out of the costume?\n16      A    Could you rephrase that?\n17      Q    Do you have any way of knowing what they\n18 actually can see while in the costume?\n19      A    No, it's just an assumption.  I've never\n20 been in a costume.\n21      Q    Okay.  And when you said that Telly\n22 Monster brushed your daughter off, is it your\nJA178\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 179 of 1384\nPage 96\n1 testimony that he did not touch her?\n2      A    Based on my position, the angle, it looked\n3 like her hand was brushed, but it wasn't like a\n4 high-five.  It wasn't a pat or a respectful\n5 acknowledgment.  It looked more like just like a\n6 downward motion this way.\n7      Q    But he acknowledged O ?\n8           MR. RUFF:  Objection.  You can answer.\n9           THE WITNESS:  I wouldn't consider that\n10      acknowledgment, no.\n11 BY MS. PARDO:\n12      Q    Okay.  Would you consider it like a\n13 low-five?\n14      A    No.\n15      Q    And, Mr. Fleming, do you identify as\n16 Black?\n17      A    Yes.\n18      Q    That's your race?\n19      A    Yes.\n20      Q    Okay.  What about O , how does she\n21 identify?\n22      A    Black.\nJA179\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 180 of 1384\nPage 97\n1      Q    And you mentioned that the child that\n2 Telly Monster touched is Asian, do you recall that\n3 testimony?\n4      A    It was a high-five specifically, yes.\n5      Q    Right, and it was an Asian child, was that\n6 your testimony?\n7      A    Yes.\n8      Q    Okay.  Where was the child standing in\n9 relation to O ?\n10      A    Approximately maybe 5 to 6 feet from\n11 O .\n12      Q    Okay.  How close was O  standing to\n13 the Asian boy that you referenced?\n14      A    It's the same distance.\n15      Q    5 to 6 feet from him?\n16      A    Yes.\n17      Q    Okay.  And how did you feel about this\n18 experience at the time it occurred?\n19      A    Pertaining to me feeling like she was\n20 being ignored during the parade, or the experience\n21 with Telly, Telly Monster?\n22      Q    The experience with Telly Monster.\nJA180\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 181 of 1384\nPage 98\n1      A    I mean she turned around with a look of\n2 sadness and it made me feel helpless.  Like I wanted\n3 to do something, but I couldn't do anything except\n4 for continue with my antics, which was signaling for\n5 other characters which, again, went ignored, as well\n6 as frustration not just for her but for myself,\n7 because I felt like I was like disappointing her.\n8      Q    So O  turned around to you after this,\n9 what you called the brushoff from Telly Monster; is\n10 that right?\n11      A    Yes.\n12      Q    Okay.  Did she say anything to you at the\n13 time?\n14      A    She didn't verbalize it, so, no.\n15      Q    Was Doniesha also in attendance at the\n16 parade?\n17      A    Yes.\n18      Q    Okay.  And was she present at the time of\n19 the Telly Monster interaction that you just\n20 described?\n21      A    She was sitting down on her phone.\n22      Q    Okay.  Where was she in relation to O\nJA181\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 182 of 1384\nPage 99\n1 at the time of the Telly Monster incident that you\n2 just described?\n3      A    She was sitting on the curb because it's\n4 like a street style.  So she was sitting on the curb\n5 in between O , which was like positioned in\n6 front of me, and then the Asian family, which was\n7 like a dad and I think a daughter and a son.  They\n8 were on the right-hand side about 5 feet from us.\n9      Q    Was Doniesha taking any video?\n10      A    I'm not 100 percent sure.  All I know she\n11 was on her phone.\n12      Q    Was she taking any photos, still\n13 photographs?\n14      A    I can't answer that.  I'm not 100 percent\n15 sure.  She just had her phone out.\n16      Q    Okay.  And you were taking video; is that\n17 correct?\n18      A    I was filming O , yes.\n19      Q    Okay.  And how did you decide when to turn\n20 on your video during this parade?\n21      A    Could you rephrase that?\n22      Q    Yeah.\nJA182\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 183 of 1384\nPage 100\n1           How did you decide when to turn the video\n2 camera on?\n3      A    Well, most phones eventually run out of\n4 storage so I wasn't filming the entire parade, so\n5 what I would do is little snapshots.  So any time I\n6 seen like a character walking, you know, maybe\n7 20 feet out, 30 feet out I would like be filming\n8 hoping that she would get some sort of\n9 acknowledgment or interaction.\n10      Q    Okay.  And then if she didn't get the\n11 interaction, would you stop filming after?\n12      A    Yes.\n13      Q    Okay.  So you didn't continuously keep\n14 your camera on?\n15      A    No, I wasn't filming continuously, no.\n16      Q    Okay.  And can you tell me some of the\n17 other characters that you had filmed in the manner\n18 that you just described?\n19      A    Seen or filmed?\n20      Q    Filmed.\n21      A    Some I do know, some I don't know, so I'm\n22 just going to be specific to the ones I do know.  So\nJA183\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 184 of 1384\nPage 101\n1 I'd say Big Bird, Elmo, Grover, I think that's the\n2 name, and Bert and Ernie.\n3      Q    Okay.  And there might have been others,\n4 but you just don't know the characters' names; is\n5 that right?\n6      A    There were others, I just don't know their\n7 names.\n8      Q    Okay.  And at the time of this experience\n9 you had mentioned that O  turned around and\n10 looked at you helpless.  Would you describe -- did\n11 you describe her as disappointed -- would you\n12 describe her as disappointed at the time?\n13           MR. RUFF:  Objection to form.  You can\n14      answer, sorry.\n15           THE WITNESS:  Could you rephrase that,\n16      please.\n17           MS. PARDO:  Sure.\n18 BY MS. PARDO:\n19      Q    Would you describe O  as being\n20 disappointed at the time of the Telly Monster\n21 brushoff, as you described it?\n22      A    Yes, but it was beyond disappointment.\nJA184\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 185 of 1384\nPage 102\n1      Q    Okay.  Tell me what made you think it was\n2 beyond disappointment.\n3      A    Well, it was a sense of hurt, confusion.\n4 She was like -- I don't know specifically how you\n5 would word it, but she was like, you know, looking\n6 at me like what do I do, like what are you going to\n7 do, like one of those looks.\n8      Q    Okay.\n9      A    I've seen that in her face before, so\n10 usually it's associated with, you know, kind of like\n11 panic.\n12      Q    So you thought she looked panicked after\n13 the Telly Monster incident?\n14      A    Yes.\n15      Q    But she still hadn't said anything to you\n16 about that right after it; is that correct?\n17      A    She didn't verbalize it in that moment,\n18 no.\n19      Q    Now, when Telly brushed your daughter's\n20 hand at the time you didn't think much of it, did\n21 you?\n22           MR. RUFF:  Objection to form.  You can\nJA185\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 186 of 1384\nPage 103\n1      answer.\n2           THE WITNESS:  I did think much of it.\n3 BY MS. PARDO:\n4      Q    You did at the time?\n5      A    Yes.\n6      Q    Okay.  Tell me what you thought about it\n7 at the time.\n8      A    Well, I noticed it, but like I said\n9 earlier it was more of just giving the benefit of\n10 the doubt.\n11      Q    After the parade ended, did you regard\n12 yourself as having suffered discrimination?\n13      A    Could you rephrase it?\n14      Q    Yeah.\n15           So the parade concludes, did you think at\n16 that time that you had suffered discrimination?\n17      A    Yes, but I chose not to act on it\n18 immediately.\n19      Q    And what is the basis of you thinking that\n20 you suffered discrimination after the parade?\n21      A    I mean there's several kids, there's\n22 hundreds of kids that are there, most of them don't\nJA186\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 187 of 1384\nPage 104\n1 look like O  and there's a lot of\n2 acknowledgment, you know, whether it had been touch\n3 or waves, that O  didn't get that same\n4 experience.\n5      Q    Did you try to speak to someone at Sesame\n6 Place about this incident that happened with Telly\n7 Monster during the parade?\n8      A    Not initially.  Not at that time of the\n9 parade, no.\n10      Q    Okay.  So you didn't complain to guest\n11 services about the lack of the interaction --\n12      A    No.\n13      Q    -- between Telly and O ?\n14      A    No.  We have a two-hour car ride, so we\n15 were -- at the time we were just focused on getting\n16 in the car.\n17      Q    So you were more focused on leaving?\n18      A    Yes.\n19      Q    Okay.  And you didn't ask to speak to a\n20 manager at the park?\n21      A    Not at the park, no.\n22      Q    And when that parade ended, what did you\nJA187\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 188 of 1384\nPage 108\n1      Q    Was there music at this parade?\n2      A    Yes.\n3      Q    Was it loud?\n4      A    I wouldn't say extremely loud.  I live in\n5 a city, so city music's louder.\n6      Q    Did you find O  to be intimidated by\n7 any of the characters?\n8      A    No.\n9      Q    Were there other people present at the\n10 parade who didn't get a high-five?\n11      A    I can't speak for everyone else, so I'm\n12 not -- I'm not sure.\n13      Q    Okay.  So you have no way of knowing if\n14 O  was the only one or one of 100 that didn't\n15 get a high-five?\n16      A    Specific to that day and that time within\n17 my proximity we were the only Black couple, Black\n18 family, and right across the street, because like I\n19 said it's a street, there was another Black family\n20 which would have been a little bit to my left.  From\n21 my knowledge looking at them they appeared to be\n22 ignored as well.\nJA188\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 189 of 1384\nPage 114\n1      A    Yes, that's what I said, yes.\n2      Q    And you consider that to be discriminatory\n3 against O ?\n4      A    Based on the conduct of how it happened,\n5 yes.\n6      Q    You didn't think the way in which Telly\n7 Monster touched O 's hand was enough of an\n8 interaction?\n9      A    No.\n10      Q    Okay.  You were expecting a high-five?\n11      A    It could have been a low-five.  She didn't\n12 get that either, so, no.\n13      Q    Okay.  If it was a high-five would you be\n14 suing for discrimination?\n15           MR. RUFF:  Objection to form.  You can\n16      answer.\n17           THE WITNESS:  Hold on, could you rephrase\n18      that?\n19           MS. PARDO:  Yeah.\n20 BY MS. PARDO:\n21      Q    If Telly Monster had given O  a\n22 high-five, would you be suing for discrimination?\nJA189\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 190 of 1384\nPage 115\n1           MR. RUFF:  Same objection, you can answer.\n2           THE WITNESS:  No, because she would -- it\n3      would have never happened.\n4 BY MS. PARDO:\n5      Q    Now, if Telly Monster had interacted with\n6 a Hispanic child instead of O , would you\n7 consider that to be racist?\n8           MR. RUFF:  Objection to form.  You can\n9      answer.\n10           THE WITNESS:  There's different variables\n11      that go into -- it's not a black or white\n12      answer.  If you could rephrase it, I mean.\n13 BY MS. PARDO:\n14      Q    Well, I'm just, I'm just wondering if, you\n15 know --\n16      A    Is this specific to just that day or is\n17 this in general?\n18      Q    Yeah, I'm talking about the parade.  So if\n19 Telly Monster had interacted with a Hispanic child\n20 instead of O  would that, would you consider\n21 that character to be racist?\n22           MR. RUFF:  Same objection.  You can\nJA190\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 191 of 1384\nPage 117\n1 intentionally in refusing to engage with O ?\n2      A    I don't want to answer that with another\n3 question, but did you watch the video?\n4      Q    I did watch the video, and I'd like to\n5 know what makes you think it was intentional.\n6      A    Well, he walked towards her, he had his\n7 hand out for a brief period walking her direction,\n8 and then when he noticed the Asian kid he walked and\n9 he veered off and gave the Asian kid the\n10 acknowledgment.\n11      Q    Okay.  How do you know what Telly Monster\n12 noticed?\n13      A    Because he's looking right at her line of\n14 sight and I'm the one that's on video performing to\n15 get his attention.\n16      Q    Okay.  And when you say Telly Monster was\n17 looking right at her, are you referring to Telly's,\n18 the character's, eyeballs?\n19      A    The body.\n20      Q    The body was pointed toward her?\n21      A    Visibly the body of the costume was what I\n22 perceived to be looking at me or looking towards\nJA191\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 192 of 1384\nPage 123\n1      Q    What about Photos with Elmo and Friends,\n2 did you go to anything that was called that?\n3      A    No, because everything's like time, from\n4 my knowledge everything's time specific.  So some of\n5 the stuff that we were -- we were already like at\n6 the pool area, then we were doing food.  So like you\n7 had to be in certain areas for certain things at\n8 certain times.\n9      Q    Okay.  So then you made choices about what\n10 you wanted to go to and not go to throughout the\n11 day?\n12      A    Yeah, we were limited because the park was\n13 like -- it was crowded that day.\n14      Q    Have you been to Sesame Place since\n15 July 4th, 2022?\n16      A    No.\n17      Q    Have you been since these interrogatory\n18 answers were provided to us?\n19      A    No.\n20      Q    Did you complain to any Pennsylvania\n21 government agencies about what occurred during your\n22 visit on July 4th?\nJA192\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 193 of 1384\nPage 124\n1      A    Like legal agencies?\n2      Q    Like, for example, the Pennsylvania Human\n3 Relations Commission.\n4      A    I reached out to Sesame Place, but if that\n5 considers an agency.\n6      Q    Okay.  So nothing part of the Pennsylvania\n7 government?\n8      A    No.\n9      Q    Okay.  In interrogatory No. 3 you identify\n10 complaints that you made to Sesame Place about your\n11 visit.  Do you recall that?\n12      A    What page is this on?\n13      Q    So No. 3, your answer is on page 5.  Do\n14 you see that answer?\n15      A    Yes.\n16      Q    All right.  So you said you made several\n17 calls.  Can you tell me the first call that you\n18 made?\n19      A    I don't know.  Are you asking for like a\n20 time?\n21      Q    Yeah, what's the, what's the first call\n22 that you made to Sesame?\nJA193\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 194 of 1384\nPage 128\n1      A    Yes.\n2      Q    Any other calls that you can remember?\n3      A    Not to Sesame Place, no.\n4      Q    All right.  And so although your visit was\n5 on July 4th, you think that the first contact that\n6 was made with Sesame Place to complain wasn't until\n7 the third week of July; is that right?\n8      A    Around about, yes.\n9      Q    Okay.  So what made you wait that long to\n10 contact Sesame Place?\n11      A    Based on my personal experience?\n12      Q    Yeah, I'd like to know what, why you\n13 waited that long.\n14      A    You know, it's easy to dismiss something\n15 when you feel like it's an isolated event specific\n16 to just you.  There's a lot of different things you\n17 can weigh out in your mind, but it wasn't anything\n18 initially that I was acting on until I seen that I\n19 wasn't alone, I wasn't in the water by myself.\n20 There's clearly other people that were struggling\n21 with the same experience, so.\n22      Q    How did you determine that there were\nJA194\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 195 of 1384\nPage 129\n1 other people struggling with the same experience?\n2      A    There was another family in New York that\n3 somebody tagged me to like an Instagram page or an\n4 Instagram post and their daughters or nieces, or\n5 whoever they were.  Just watching the video it\n6 reminded me of O , so I went back and watched my\n7 video again and I'm like I wasn't delusional.\n8      Q    Was this a video involving the character\n9 Rosita?\n10      A    I want to say the character was blue, so.\n11      Q    Blue, okay.\n12      A    If that's the name of the blue character.\n13      Q    And there were two Black girls involved in\n14 that --\n15      A    Yes.\n16      Q    -- incident?\n17           Okay.  Do you know whether this is the\n18 video that was posted by Jodi Brown?\n19      A    If that's the name, possibly.\n20      Q    Okay.  Did you watch the video online?\n21      A    Yes, on my phone, Instagram.\n22      Q    On your phone, okay, through Instagram?\nJA195\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 196 of 1384\nPage 176\n1 you, \"Over here, here you go\"?\n2      A    Um-hum.\n3      Q    Can you tell what you were saying right\n4 there?\n5      A    Like I said, I was -- that was part of my\n6 antics.  I was -- prior to even Telly Monster I was\n7 already like kind of calling out the characters\n8 trying to get their attention.\n9      Q    Okay.  So we can see in the video that\n10 Telly comes over towards your child; correct?\n11      A    Correct.\n12      Q    Okay.  And this is the scenario where you\n13 say that Telly did some sort of hand interaction\n14 with the Asian boy standing next to you; is that\n15 right?\n16      A    You mean the high-five?\n17      Q    Yeah.\n18      A    Yes.\n19      Q    Okay.  You call it a high-five, okay.\n20           And can you see in that video that Telly\n21 touches her hand, O 's hand?\n22      A    Touch can be defined as many different\nJA196\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 197 of 1384\nPage 177\n1 things.\n2      Q    Okay.\n3      A    He brushed her hand, so.\n4      Q    Okay.  So you consider it to be a brushing\n5 of the hand?\n6      A    Yes.\n7      Q    You don't consider it to be like a\n8 backhand or a high -- or a low-five?\n9      A    That's not a low-five.\n10      Q    Okay.  And you would describe this video\n11 as being discriminatory towards O ?\n12      A    Absolutely, yes.\n13      Q    And your basis for saying that is because\n14 Telly touched or interacted with the Asian boy next\n15 to her; is that right?\n16      A    Could you rephrase that?\n17      Q    The basis for you saying it's\n18 discriminatory is because instead of touching O\n19 he touched the Asian boy next to her; is that right?\n20      A    I mean I wouldn't say touched.  He\n21 high-fived -- he had his hand out for a high-five\n22 towards O  and then he gave the high-five to the\nJA197\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 198 of 1384\nPage 182\n1 White.\n2      Q    Okay.  All right.\n3           MS. PARDO:  Can we turn to the second\n4      video, Mr. Smolij, and we can run it through\n5      again and ask questions.\n6           MR. SMOLIJ:  Is this -- is this video No.\n7      3?\n8           MS. PARDO:  So the other Telly video.\n9           MR. SMOLIJ:  Oh, okay.  Stand by.\n10           (Video played.)\n11 BY MS. PARDO:\n12      Q    Okay.  So I'd like you to tell me if you\n13 know which Telly video came first in time\n14 chronologically.\n15      A    Chronologically based on my memory I would\n16 say it was the first one with the high-five and then\n17 that one.\n18      Q    Okay.  In this video did you just say\n19 something to the effect of \"You got to get their\n20 attention\"?\n21      A    Yes.\n22      Q    Okay.  So does it make sense that this one\nJA198\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 199 of 1384\nPage 183\n1 might have come first, or do you still not know?  We\n2 can run it again too if you want.\n3      A    Like I said based on my memory, even\n4 watching the video, it's the same thing.  She gave\n5 me a look and I tried to give the benefit of the\n6 doubt.\n7      Q    Yeah, I'm just trying to determine this\n8 video where she turned and gave you the look, did\n9 that happen before Telly came over and did the\n10 brushed hand or after?\n11      A    I'm most sure that this is after --\n12      Q    Okay.\n13      A    -- in chronological order.\n14           MS. PARDO:  Let's watch it one more time.\n15           (Video played.)\n16 BY MS. PARDO:\n17      Q    Okay.  So Telly was dancing in the middle\n18 of the street in that clip; correct?\n19      A    Correct.\n20      Q    Okay.  So are you -- are you saying that\n21 that video shows the character ignoring O ?\n22      A    No, that's not what I said.\nJA199\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 200 of 1384\nPage 184\n1      Q    Okay.  No, I'm asking you if that's what\n2 you think it showed.\n3      A    That's her reaction after the fact.\n4      Q    Okay.  That's her reaction after what?\n5      A    The initial incident that we were just\n6 talking about.\n7      Q    I see, okay.\n8           So this is -- you think this happened\n9 right after the initial incident and that this was\n10 her reaction to that?\n11      A    Based on my memory, to the best of my\n12 knowledge I'd say that was the second video after.\n13 That's her reaction to the first one.\n14      Q    Okay.\n15           MS. PARDO:  And if Mr. Smolij can play\n16      this from the top, I want to see if this one\n17      has a jump like I previously thought we saw.\n18           (Video played.)\n19           MS.

PARDO:\n8      Q    Well, I'd like to know what it is you mean\n9 by racial trauma since it was included in your\n10 response.\n11      A    Well, racial trauma associated with\n12 myself, or racial trauma associated with O ?\n13      Q    Let's start with you.\n14      A    Okay.  So I mean racial trauma is\n15 something that has an instant negative effect.  I\n16 suffer from hypertension, so there's elements that I\n17 have to deal with associated with, with that\n18 incident that elevates my blood pressure.  I can\n19 feel it physically, whether it comes in the form of\n20 stress, tightness in my chest, tingling in my hands.\n21 Depending on what level I'm at as far as like being\n22 overwhelmed I might need to have a seat.\nJA203\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 204 of 1384\nPage 267\n1           Based on the fact that you guys were given\n2 permission by the purchase of your tickets to attend\n3 the park, was it your understanding that by making\n4 that purchase you were entitled to have an equal\n5 experience to other folks that were visiting the\n6 park?\n7           MS. PARDO:  Objection; leading.\n8 BY MR. RUFF:\n9      Q    You can answer.\n10      A    I'm getting confused, I'm sorry.\n11      Q    She's allowed to object just as much as I\n12 am as well.\n13      A    Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought when there's an\n14 objection I thought it was like -- okay, my bad.\n15      Q    You can answer the question.\n16      A    Yes, I thought that I would have the same\n17 opportunity as everybody that was in the park that\n18 day.\n19      Q    Okay.  What kind of services did you\n20 understand would be offered, or goods or facilities\n21 that would be offered at the park when you attended?\n22      A    Well, it was summertime, so the water\nJA204\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 205 of 1384\nPage 272\n1 she gave me a shoulder shrug, and it was completely\n2 different from falling off a bike so it wasn't like\n3 I had to be the helicopter parent.  I kind of like,\n4 you know, just tried to encourage her to keep\n5 pushing forward, keep your hand out, get a\n6 high-five, it's okay.\n7      Q    What kind of emotions were you going\n8 through when you observed her face?\n9      A    There was a moment of helplessness because\n10 I wanted to react a different way and I didn't.  I\n11 think a lot of times some people get caught up in\n12 their emotions and they do that.  I'd say a certain\n13 level of embarrassment, especially when people are\n14 reaching out after the fact saying about, you know,\n15 this is what's going on with your daughter, this is\n16 what happened to your daughter, too.\n17           I also would say a little bit of shame,\n18 because even though that happened we decided to, you\n19 know -- we didn't cancel the tickets right away and\n20 I figured like maybe, maybe we can try it again.\n21 Like maybe it wasn't that bad, we could might\n22 possibly give it another shot, but then nothing ever\nJA205\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 206 of 1384\nPage 315\n1\n2   CERTIFICATE OF SHORTHAND REPORTER-NOTARY PUBLIC\n3\n4           I, Toni R.

What do the ads on Instagram say?\n8      A.   \"Come join us and have fun.\"\n9      Q.   Did you ever read anything by Seaworld or\n10 Sesame Place that said everybody in the Sesame Place\n11 park would get a personal interaction with a costume\n12 character?\n13      A.   Yes.  I saw that, but don't they -- they\n14 do that, so.\n15      Q.   Where did you see that?\n16      A.   I don't know.  I can't remember.  I really\n17 can't.  I just know Sesame Place.  Like, it's a\n18 theme park, and the show, we all watched it.  So we\n19 would want to expect the same as you see on the show\n20 and inside the park.\n21      Q.   Did you ever read anything in writing that\n22 said everybody at Sesame Place gets a personal\n23 interaction with a Sesame Street costume character?\n24      A.   No.\nJA221\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 222 of 1384\nPage 65\n1  I'm so sorry.  I'm just bunched up.\n2      Q.

There's no promises on the ticket about\n18 personal interactions with Sesame Street characters,\n19 right?\n20      A.   Mhm.  Yes.\n21      Q.   Correct?\n22      A.   Yes.\n23      Q.

So focusing on the June 24th, 2022 visit\n2 that you're suing over, do you remember what day of\n3 the week it was?\n4      A.   Okay.  So I don't even know where I left\n5 off at.\n6                Oh, is it here?\n7           MR. O'CONNELL:  She's asking you a\n8      question.\n9           THE WITNESS:  Oh, no.  I was making sure I\n10      was at the right part on the paper.\n11 BY MS. BAZAN:\n12      Q.   So I'm not asking you about any document\n13 right now.\n14      A.   I believe it was a Friday.\n15      Q.   What time did you arrive to Sesame Place\n16 on that day?\n17      A.   10 o'clock.\n18      Q.   What time did you leave the park that day?\n19      A.   About 4:00.\n20      Q.   In your own words, please walk us through\n21 what happened at Sesame Place on June 24th, 2022\n22 that you're suing about.\n23      A.   Well, we -- after we finished most of the\n24 day, we thought we would catch the parade at\nJA223\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 224 of 1384\nPage 67\n1 3 o'clock.  And we found a spot -- because it was\n2 already crowded.  We found a spot for M  to go\n3 to the front where he's able to be seen.  And as\n4 characters are approaching, this one particular\n5 character hugged a child that was literally next to\n6 M , and basically walked past flagging -- I\n7 don't know if it was, like -- I believe it was a\n8 flag.  So I feel like that person and that character\n9 walked past my son without acknowledging him or\n10 giving him a hug where his hands are out and visible\n11 for him to be seen, and he was able to be seen.\n12      Q.   When you say, \"flagging,\" what do you mean\n13 by that?\n14      A.   Flagging is like a shoo, like you're\n15 shooing off a fly.  That's, like, a flag.\n16      Q.   And you think a character was doing that\n17 to M.C.?\n18      A.   I don't think.  I know.\n19      Q.   How do you know?\n20      A.   By me and my own two eyes seeing it\n21 happen.\n22      Q.   Did M.C. say anything about how he felt\n23 about the experience at the time he occurred?\n24      A.   Yes.  He said he was sad because of the\nJA224\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 225 of 1384\nPage 68\n1 character not giving him a hug.\n2      Q.   Do you know which character it was?\n3      A.   Rosita.\n4      Q.   When did he say to you that he was sad\n5 because the character didn't give him a hug?\n6      A.   It was after the parade was over because\n7 they were still out there.\n8      Q.   And how did you respond when he said that?\n9      A.   I can't remember what I said.\n10      Q.   Did you communicate M.C.'s experience at\n11 Sesame Place to anyone at the time that it occurred?\n12      A.   No.\n13      Q.   Did you talk about it that day with M.C.'s\n14 father?\n15      A.   Yes.\n16      Q.   Did you talk about it in person or text\n17 message or?\n18      A.   In person.\n19      Q.   And what did you tell him?\n20      A.   That the character ignored M .\n21      Q.   Anything else?\n22      A.   And then I told him that M  felt some\n23 type of way of him being ignored by a character that\n24 he was visibly seen by in trying to give him a hug,\nJA225\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 226 of 1384\nPage 69\n1 but treated like a fly.\n2      Q.   At the parade when the incident with\n3 Rosita happened, was anyone there with you, other\n4 than M.C. and L ?\n5      A.   They were at the parade, but they wasn't\n6 where we were.  It was just me and them.  They were\n7 on, like, farther down, like, in the back.\n8      Q.   So they didn't see it?\n9      A.   No.\n10      Q.   Before you left the park on June 24th, you\n11 didn't complain to Seaworld or Sesame Place, right?\n12      A.   No.\n13      Q.   Did you go to guest relations?\n14      A.   No.\n15      Q.   Did you ask to see a manager?\n16      A.   No.\n17      Q.   Why not?\n18      A.   Because I didn't want to ruin the day.\n19      Q.   After the trip, did you ask Seaworld or\n20 Sesame Place for any kind of a refund?\n21      A.   No.\n22      Q.   Did you complain to any kind of\n23 governmental agency about yours or M.C.'s experience\n24 at Sesame Place?\nJA226\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 227 of 1384\nPage 70\n1      A.   Governmental agencies, like what?\n2      Q.   Any governmental agency.\n3      A.   No.\n4      Q.   Did you post anything on social media\n5 about yours or M.C.'s experience at Sesame Place?\n6      A.   Yes.\n7      Q.   What did -- on what platform did you post?\n8      A.   Instagram.\n9      Q.   What did you post on Instagram?\n10      A.   My video.\n11      Q.   What is your Instagram handle, your name\n12 on Instagram?\n13      A.   Shondaaaaa, S-H-O-N-D-A, it's five As and\n14 two underscores.\n15      Q.   (Indicating).\n16      A.   Five As and two underscores.\n17      Q.   Two underscores.\n18      A.   I'm sorry.  That was, like, my page when I\n19 was young.\n20      Q.   At first I heard, \"five As and two\n21 dinosaurs.\"  I was going to be very impressed.\n22                So you posted your video to\n23 Instagram.\n24                Was it one videos or multiple?\nJA227\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 228 of 1384\nPage 71\n1      A.   It was that specific video because it cuts\n2 down.  I don't know if you have Instagram.  When you\n3 record, after a certain time, it will make another\n4 video.  So that specific video was able to be\n5 downloaded.  I guess that all happened in one video,\n6 so it was able to be downloaded, just that one clip.\n7      Q.   Did you post it on Instagram, like, live\n8 as it was happening or later after it happened?\n9      A.   Are you talking about on the day of?  What\n10 do you mean?\n11      Q.   Yes, I do mean on the day of.\n12      A.   Of the park?\n13      Q.   Yes.\n14      A.   Oh, I didn't know -- I thought you was\n15 saying, like, after.\n16      Q.   Well, my first question was:  Did ever you\n17 post anything on social media?\n18      A.   I'm sorry.  I misunderstood that.  I'm\n19 thinking you said afterwards.  But yes, I did post\n20 those videos on Instagram.  Like, I was recording\n21 the whole time.\n22      Q.   The whole time when you were at the\n23 parade?\n24      A.   At the parade, yes.\nJA228\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 229 of 1384\nPage 72\n1      Q.   Okay.\n2      A.   I'm thinking you're talking about\n3 afterwards.  I'm sorry.  I got it mixed up.\n4      Q.   Not a problem.\n5                When you say you're recording the\n6 whole time at the parade --\n7      A.   Yes.\n8      Q.   I may not be using the right words because\n9 I'm not an Instagram user, but what I'm trying to\n10 figure out is, were you, like, broadcasting it live\n11 to Instagram as it was happening?\n12      A.   Oh, no.  It was on my story.  On the\n13 story.\n14      Q.   Oh.  So you put it up on your Instagram as\n15 a story after the park?\n16      A.   No.  It was posted as the day on -- like,\n17 after I was finished, then I posted it.\n18      Q.   While you were still at the parade --\n19 while you were still at Sesame Place?\n20      A.   Yes.\n21      Q.   Okay.\n22      A.   I don't know.  After it was over, then you\n23 just press update -- upload.  That's how it was.\n24      Q.   Okay.  I think I understand it, but I'm\nJA229\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 230 of 1384\nPage 73\n1 going to try to say it back.  You correct me, if I\n2 got it wrong.\n3                So you were recording the whole\n4 parade on your phone as a video?\n5      A.   Yes.\n6      Q.   And then after the parade was over --\n7      A.   But from Instagram.\n8      Q.   From Instagram?\n9      A.   Yes.\n10      Q.   That's an important thing.\n11                So not on the camera app on your\n12 phone?\n13      A.   Yes.\n14      Q.   So you were recording from Instagram, when\n15 it finishes, then it uploads to Instagram?\n16      A.   Uploads, yes.\n17      Q.   Okay.  Other than that video on Instagram\n18 we've just been talking about, have you posted\n19 anything else on social media about yours or M.C.'s\n20 experience at Sesame Place?\n21      A.   Later on.  Like, not that day.\n22      Q.   Okay.  On what platforms?\n23      A.   It was still Instagram.\n24      Q.   And what did you post?\nJA230\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 231 of 1384\nPage 75\n1      A.   Because it was -- a lot of people were\n2 sharing the same experience that I experienced there\n3 at Sesame Place.\n4      Q.   You had seen other people's videos by\n5 then?\n6      A.   Yeah.  And they were exactly like mine.\n7      Q.   Do you remember seeing a viral video in\n8 July of 2022 involving Rosita, that wasn't your\n9 video?\n10      A.   Yeah.  No.  That wasn't my video, but I\n11 seen that video.\n12      Q.   Okay.  Did you show M.C. that video?\n13      A.   Yes, I did.\n14      Q.   When did you show him that video?\n15      A.   Not around that time because it was, like,\n16 a lot going on.  I didn't really show him that.  I\n17 showed him probably, like, months and months after.\n18      Q.   Why did you show it to him?\n19      A.   I mean, it's just like he don't -- he\n20 don't -- I can't even remember if I did.  Like, he\n21 just -- he's 5.  It's not like he's going to pay --\n22 not really going to pay any attention, like, the\n23 video.  I can't even recall if I did, to be honest\n24 with you.  It's been so much, so.\nJA231\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 232 of 1384\nPage 76\n1      Q.   All right.  Let's go back to the\n2 complaint, which is the document you have in front\n3 of you.\n4      A.   Mhm.\n5      Q.   On page 10.\n6      A.   Okay.  I'm here already.\n7      Q.   Okay.  Good.\n8                So I would like to draw your\n9 attention to paragraphs 59 and 60.  So starting on\n10 the, sort of, second line of paragraph 59, you\n11 allege that, \"Rosita intentionally refused to\n12 perform Seaworld's contract with the Miles and the\n13 class by interalia refusing to engage with them and\n14 ignoring them.\"\n15                And then the next paragraph says,\n16 \"the Miles took videos documenting some of these\n17 discriminatory interactions.\"\n18                Do you see that?\n19      A.   Yes.\n20      Q.   And then there's that footnote 5 after the\n21 word \"interactions\" --\n22      A.

Mhm.  Yes.\n3      Q.   Were there any other discriminatory\n4 interactions that you are suing about that are not\n5 part of the video that's linked here in the\n6 complaint?\n7      A.

So from this vantage point, she's\n11 between M.C. and the camera, right, so she's, kind\n12 of, blocking him, from your perspective?\n13      A.   Yes.  Mhm.\n14      Q.   So did you start filming on your phone,\n15 like, at the very beginning of the parade and kept\n16 it going until the end?\n17      A.   No.  I didn't record the whole parade.\n18      Q.   Okay.  How did you decide to start\n19 recording?\n20      A.   I don't know.  I just pulled my phone out.\n21 It was kind of hard anyway.  I just pulled my phone\n22 out.  I had the little neck thing.  I pulled it out\n23 and started recording.  So whatever time this is in\n24 the parade, that's when I recorded.\nJA237\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 238 of 1384\nPage 85\n1      Q.   How was M.C. attempting to interact with\n2 Rosita?\n3      A.   He was trying to give her hugs.\n4      Q.   How was he trying to give Rosita a hug?\n5      A.   By putting his arms out.\n6      Q.   And that was during the 3:00 p.m. parade,\n7 right?\n8      A.   Yes.\n9      Q.   Do you know if he asked Rosita for a hug?\n10      A.   No.  It's loud.  Can't hear.\n11      Q.   How do you know M.C. wanted a hug, as\n12 opposed to a wave or high five or something else?\n13      A.   Because both his arms was out for a hug.\n14      Q.   And you know, as his mom, that means he\n15 wants a hug?\n16      A.   Yes.\n17      Q.   So back to the question on interrogatory\n18 4.  If you go to the top of page 3, I'm looking at\n19 the question that's little E.  It asks you to\n20 described -- \"Describe the attempt to interaction,\"\n21 but it should say \"interact,\" \"or the interaction,\n22 and state all facts that show why you contend this\n23 interaction was racially discriminatory or otherwise\n24 racially offensive.\"\nJA238\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 239 of 1384\nPage 86\n1           MR.

Interrogatory number 2, and I'm looking at\n10 little E.\n11      A.   Mhm.\n12      Q.   Where it's asking you why the conduct was\n13 discriminatory, basically.\n14      A.   Because he gave a white little girl --\n15 she, a hug, and basically walked past M .\n16      Q.   Okay.\n17      A.   And visually seen him.\n18      Q.   Okay.  So if you look on page 4 of this\n19 same exhibit, your answer, little E, so this is your\n20 written answer to that same question, where you\n21 say --\n22      A.   Where is it at?  I'm sorry.\n23      Q.   Sure, sure, sure.\n24                It's page 4.  It's on the top half of\nJA239\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 240 of 1384\nPage 87\n1 the page, right after the little E in the paragraph.\n2      A.   Oh.\n3           MR. O'CONNELL:  I'm going to help her find\n4      little E.\n5           MS. BAZAN:  Sure.\n6           MR.

So it says, \"M.C. and his sister were at\n19 the parade in the front row ahead of the crowd.\n20 Rosita approached M.C., but hugged the white child\n21 next to him.  Rosita then looked at M.C.'s\n22 answer\" -- sorry -- \"Rosita then looked at M.C.'s\n23 sister and swiftly walked away.\"\n24                Do you agree with that answer?\nJA240\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 241 of 1384\nPage 88\n1      A.   (Indicating).\n2      Q.   \"Yes\"?\n3      A.   Yes.  I'm sorry.\n4      Q.   Are there any other facts that make you\n5 think the interaction was racially discriminatory?\n6      A.   No.  Other than him hugging the white\n7 little girl.  That's it.\n8      Q.   Did Rosita say anything derogatory to\n9 M.C.?\n10      A.   No.\n11      Q.   Did Rosita say anything to M.C. about\n12 race?\n13      A.   Nope.\n14      Q.   So you believe the interaction was\n15 discriminatory because Rosita hugged the white child\n16 next to M.C. and then walked by, right?\n17      A.   Yes.  The actions were shown.\n18      Q.   Okay.  How do you know the child next to\n19 M.C. that Rosita hugged was white?\n20      A.   Because of her skin complexion and hair.\n21      Q.   You didn't know her, right?\n22      A.   No.\n23      Q.   You didn't ask her or her family how she\n24 identifies racially?\nJA241\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 242 of 1384\nPage 89\n1      A.   No.\n2      Q.   So how do you know she's not, for example,\n3 Hispanic?\n4      A.   Because she just -- she looks white.\n5      Q.   So you're just assuming her race?\n6      A.   No.  I'm not assuming.  I mean, I went to\n7 cosmetology school.  So I know different types of\n8 hair texture.  Therefore, her hair is straight and\n9 doesn't have, like, a curl pattern.  But yeah, she's\n10 a white little girl.\n11      Q.   So you can tell by looking at her hair\n12 she's white?\n13      A.   And skin.\n14      Q.   And skin.\n15                If you knew that that little girl\n16 actually was Hispanic, would you still think that\n17 interaction was racially discriminatory?\n18           MR.

Yes.\n9      Q.   Why?\n10      A.   Because she still would be another race.\n11      Q.   Are you representing the legal interests\n12 of Hispanic people in this case?\n13      A.   I'm representing whoever was\n14 discriminated.\n15      Q.

She's not touching either one of them.\n22 It's blur, so you really can't see anything.  But\n23 she didn't touch neither one of them.\n24      Q.

What do you think L  was doing there?\n8      A.   Trying to get some type of high five or\n9 she was waving.\n10      Q.   Okay.  So Rosita is not ignoring L\n11 there, right?\n12           MR.

You know, show some type of -- like, you're\n16 working with kids.  That's just like me working in a\n17 daycare.  I have to interact with all of the\n18 childrens [sic].  So she is at a parade where\n19 there's a bunch of children on the sidelines, so she\n20 has to do something.  Not walk past like you have an\n21 attitude or something or you don't like your job.\n22      Q.   So a wave counts as an interaction?\n23      A.   Huh?\n24      Q.

It's, like, recognition,\n2 an interaction.  I'm waving at you.  You see me, you\n3 wave back.\n4      Q.   Do you think it's possible for Rosita to\n5 hug everybody along the parade route?\n6      A.   If not a hug, you know, show some\n7 attention.\n8      Q.   And the parade is moving down the street,\n9 right?\n10      A.   Yes.\n11      Q.   And the characters are also dancing in the\n12 parade?\n13      A.   Yes.\n14      Q.

Is the parade route longer than what your\n2 sight was?\n3      A.   Yes.\n4      Q.   So you don't know for sure whether Rosita\n5 interacted with every single person along the parade\n6 route because you couldn't see it, right?\n7      A.   No.\n8      Q.   So you can't say whether there were other\n9 black children along the parade route who had\n10 interactions with Rosita, right?\n11      A.   No.  I'm not sure.\n12      Q.   Does M.C.'s sister identify as the same\n13 race as M.C.?\n14      A.   Yes.\n15      Q.   And what race is that?\n16      A.   Black.\n17      Q.   Black.\n18                And it's your testimony that Rosita\n19 ignored her as well, right?\n20      A.   Yes.\n21      Q.

Yeah.\n12           MR. RICHARDSON:  It looks like there's\n13      another number after the 4 on the second page\n14      --\n15           THE WITNESS:  On the second page --\n16           MR.

If you look down where the transactions\n8 are listed, one of the ones that is visible is a\n9 transaction on 7/9 for Sesame Place.\n10                Do you see that one?\n11      A.   Yes.\n12      Q.   It's for $181.15?\n13      A.   Yes.\n14      Q.   And was that for the purchase of the\n15 tickets to Sesame Place?\n16      A.   Yes.\n17      Q.

In your own words, describe what happened\n12 at Sesame Place on July 11th, 2022 that you're suing\n13 about.\n14      A.   Well, me and my daughter went to see the\n15 7 o'clock parade.  We were -- well, she was excited\n16 because we was right in the front.  There was no one\n17 in front of us.  The parade was getting ready to\n18 start.  As the characters came out, you know, the\n19 floats, kind of, come out and everything.  And I\n20 think the first character that, kind of, came\n21 extremely close to her was Big Bird.  I tried to\n22 pick her up so she could give him a high five.  He,\n23 kind of, ignored her.  Kept going.  He high five the\n24 family before us and the family after us and kind of\nJA273\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 274 of 1384\nPage 52\n1      A.   No.\n2      Q.   It was just those three?\n3      A.   Yes.\n4      Q.   Now, in the complaint you described this\n5 as discrimination based on the fact that your\n6 daughter is Hispanic; is that right?\n7      A.   My daughter is -- she is a mixed race.\n8 She is Afro-Latina.  She is African-American and\n9 Hispanic.\n10      Q.   Do you identify as Hispanic?\n11      A.   I identify as Afro-Latina as well.\n12      Q.   And does your daughter identify as\n13 Afro-Latina as well?\n14      A.   Yes.\n15      Q.   What is your race?\n16      A.   I am also mixed race.  I am Puerto Rican\n17 and Dominican.\n18      Q.   What about N.?  What is her race?\n19      A.   She is African-American and Hispanic.\n20      Q.   So tell me about this experience at the\n21 time it happened.  Tell me how you felt about the\n22 experience, you, personally.\n23      A.   Me, personally, with the first character,\n24 I, kind of, said, \"Okay.  All right.  Maybe it was,\nJA274\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 275 of 1384\nPage 53\n1 you know, just something that happens.\"  But when it\n2 happened more than once, that's when I -- it was,\n3 kind of, obvious what was happening.  It was a\n4 little frustrating for my daughter to have to\n5 experience that.  She kept saying, \"Why they're not\n6 saying hi to me?  Nobody wants to give me a high\n7 five.\"  She was saying those types of things.\n8      Q.   You just said, \"It was kind of obvious\n9 what was happening.\"\n10                Can you explain that to me?  What do\n11 you mean by that?\n12      A.   So to be very honest, we were, like, the\n13 only colored family in that area.  Everyone was\n14 white on both sides of us.  And it wasn't just us\n15 and then a white family, Hispanic family.  It was\n16 just all white families and then us.  And everyone\n17 else was getting high fives and hugs and all of\n18 those other things, and she just was ignored.\n19      Q.   How did that experience -- how did you\n20 react to that experience?\n21      A.   Well, I'm the adult.  So I can't, you\n22 know, make a show.  My daughter was already feeling\n23 some type of way.  So I'm not going to make things\n24 any worse.  So I just -- you know, she's a child.\nJA275\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 276 of 1384\nPage 54\n1 She's innocent.  I just told her, you know, \"It's\n2 okay.  Maybe next time.\"\n3      Q.   And you were saying you saw your daughter\n4 was feeling a type of way.\n5                Describe to me how you knew that.\n6      A.   She would turn around and she'll say --\n7 you know, like I said before, \"Why they're not\n8 shaking my hand?  Why they not giving a high five?\"\n9 She was just sad.  She made a pout, like she pouted.\n10 Her lip was sticking out.  She was kind of upset.\n11      Q.   Okay.  Now, you had indicated that she\n12 asked you, \"Why am I not getting a high five?\"  She\n13 asked you a question.\n14      A.   Yes.\n15      Q.   At what point in the parade did she ask\n16 that question?\n17      A.   I would say after the second character.\n18 After that one, that's when it was, \"Okay.  This is,\n19 kind of -- it keeps happening.\"\n20      Q.   And in response to that question, what did\n21 you tell her?\n22      A.   I just -- like I said before, I didn't\n23 want to overreact because, you know, she is a child.\n24 I said, \"It's okay.\"  You know, \"Maybe next time.\"\nJA276\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 277 of 1384\nPage 55\n1 And just try to move her up a little bit.  She was\n2 already at the line.  She couldn't go past the\n3 yellow line.  For her safety, I don't want to push\n4 her up closer.  I told her just keep waving, waving.\n5 That's when the last character was coming by.\n6      Q.   Did you tell her at any point that the\n7 characters were skipping her because of her race?\n8      A.   No.  I don't ever want my daughter to feel\n9 like she's different.\n10      Q.   And this incident that you're describing,\n11 your boys weren't -- your two sons were not present\n12 for this; is that correct?\n13      A.   No.\n14      Q.   After you had this experience, did you\n15 communicate with anyone about what happened during\n16 that 7:00 p.m. parade?\n17      A.   I talked to my husband on the way home.\n18      Q.   Okay.  Anyone else?\n19      A.   No.\n20      Q.   What about friends?\n21      A.   No.\n22      Q.   What about other family members?\n23      A.

Were there any other instances that\n6 occurred on July 11, 2022 during your Sesame Place\n7 visit that you're suing about?\n8      A.   That I'm suing about, no.\n9      Q.   I may have asked you this before.\n10                But in that 7:00 p.m. parade, did any\n11 other characters interact with your daughter?\n12      A.   No.\n13      Q.   While you were in the park that day, did\n14 you go to any of the areas of the park where you\n15 meet up and take a photo with the character?\n16      A.   No.\n17      Q.   Why didn't you do that?\n18      A.   I think the times, kind of, clashed with\n19 us waiting in line to go, you know, on the rides.\n20      Q.   Okay.  So it's not as though you went to\n21 one of those photo opportunities and were denied a\n22 place in line?\n23      A.   Yeah.  We never went to --\n24      Q.   Okay.

It might have been.  I\n20 don't remember what characters.  It was one of the\n21 girl characters.\n22      Q.   Okay.

Okay.  At some point you made a complaint\n12 to Sesame Place about your visit through the\n13 website, correct?\n14      A.   Yes.\n15      Q.   Now, do you recall what date you made\n16 that?  It was before the Attorney General complaint,\n17 correct?\n18      A.   Yeah.  It was before that.  I don't know\n19 the exact date.\n20      Q.

And were there other people that were with\n17 her that -- you understood to be with her?\n18      A.   Yes.  It was other people on the other\n19 side of her.\n20      Q.   Okay.  And do you know the race of this\n21 lady?\n22      A.   White.\n23      Q.   Okay.  Do you know whether she's Hispanic\n24 or not?\nJA287\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 288 of 1384\nPage 106\n1      A.   No.  I didn't hear -- they were just\n2 speaking English.  I didn't hear any Spanish or any\n3 accent or anything.\n4      Q.   Okay.  Okay.  So it's your testimony that\n5 in order to be Hispanic, you have to speak with an\n6 accent?\n7      A.   Not -- no, not necessarily.  But anything\n8 that would, kind of, show that she was Hispanic.\n9      Q.   Okay.  But you don't know for sure?\n10      A.   I don't know.  Yeah.\n11      Q.   In the clip that was just played, we heard\n12 a voice that said, \"N , you got to say, 'Hi' when\n13 they come by.  Okay?\"\n14                Whose voice was that?\n15      A.   That's mine.\n16      Q.   Why did you tell her to say, \"'Hi,' when\n17 they come by\"?\n18      A.   So she could get their attention, say,\n19 \"Hi.\"\n20      Q.   And before you told her that, was she\n21 trying to get Big Bird's attention?\n22      A.   Well, she was excited to go up to the\n23 parade so she could, you know, get a high five, or,\n24 at least a \"Hi,\" or acknowledge her.\nJA288\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 289 of 1384\nPage 107\n1      Q.   Okay.  Now, this video is only 20 seconds\n2 long.\n3      A.   Yeah.\n4      Q.   Is it a portion of a larger video?\n5      A.   No.  My phone, kind of, cut off.\n6      Q.   Okay.\n7      A.   That's the reason why you got the second\n8 video.\n9      Q.   I see.\n10                Do you recall taking video before Big\n11 Bird's part of the parade?\n12      A.   No, I didn't.  That was the first video.\n13 That's the first video, I, kind of -- as soon as I\n14 saw him there, that's when I pulled my phone out.\n15      Q.   Okay.\n16      A.   Yeah.\n17      Q.   Okay.  So you hadn't started filming at\n18 the beginning of the parade --\n19      A.   Uh-uh, no.\n20      Q.    -- and done it for the whole time?\n21      A.   No, no.\n22      Q.   And it's your recollection that you first\n23 started filming with Big Bird coming up?\n24      A.   Yeah.\nJA289\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 290 of 1384\nPage 108\n1      Q.   Okay.  And did you intentionally stop it\n2 at 20 seconds?\n3      A.   No.  My phone cut off.\n4      Q.   Okay.\n5      A.   Yeah.\n6      Q.   And then at some portion -- some period of\n7 time, you resumed filming, which is in a different\n8 video.\n9                Is that it?\n10      A.   Yes.\n11      Q.   Okay.  And does this show the incident\n12 regarding Big Bird that you're suing about?\n13      A.   Yes.\n14           MS. PARDO:  All right.  And then can you\n15      play it again, Alek?\n16           (Whereupon, video recording was played.)\n17           THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  I didn't get that\n18      part.\n19           MS.

Well, she was, you know, standing there\n3 that whole time and he did come to the people that\n4 was next to us on the left-hand side.\n5      Q.   Okay.  On the left-hand side.\n6                So let's turn to this family on the\n7 right.  We could watch this again, if you want to --\n8 maybe play it out and we could go back again.\n9           MS. PARDO:  Not them --\n10           (Whereupon, video recording was played.)\n11           MS.

PARDO:\n16      Q.   Okay.  So turning to the right side, you\n17 referenced earlier there was a kid in the stroller.\n18                Did you see her in this video at all?\n19      A.   When I was there I saw her, yeah.\n20      Q.   Okay.  And you're seeing her now?\n21      A.   Yeah.\n22      Q.   Okay.

Okay.  Sitting in the stroller?\n2      A.   Yes.\n3      Q.   Okay.  Is it your testimony that this\n4 child is white?\n5      A.   Yeah.  The -- the family next to us was\n6 white.\n7      Q.   Okay.  Do you know whether or not this\n8 child is Hispanic?\n9      A.   No.\n10      Q.   Okay.  Do you know the religion of the\n11 family right to your right?\n12      A.   No.\n13      Q.   And was your daughter acting shy in this\n14 video or at all reserved, or is this how she, kind\n15 of, normally is?\n16      A.   Yeah.  That's usually how she is.\n17      Q.   Okay.  Before Big Bird interacts with the\n18 child in the stroller, would you describe her as\n19 acting happy?\n20      A.   This is how she usually is.\n21      Q.   Okay.\n22      A.   Yeah.\n23      Q.   Okay.\n24           MS. PARDO:  All right.

PARDO:\n4      Q.   I want you to focus to the lady on the\n5 left as it plays and we'll just stop right after\n6 that.\n7                (Whereupon, video recording was\n8 played.)\n9           MS. PARDO:  Stop.\n10 BY MS. PARDO:\n11      Q.   Okay.  Does the video show Big Bird high\n12 fiving this lady on the left?\n13      A.   Not the lady exactly, but the people that\n14 was with her.\n15      Q.   Okay.\n16      A.   Yeah.\n17      Q.   Okay.  So that's not captured on the\n18 video?\n19      A.   Yeah.\n20      Q.   And does the video show Big Bird hugging\n21 this lady on the left?\n22      A.   No.\n23      Q.   Okay.  Is it your testimony that Big Bird\n24 hugged somebody on the left-hand side of the family?\nJA293\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 294 of 1384\nPage 112\n1      A.   On the left --\n2      Q.   The left family.\n3      A.   Yes, yes.  On the video, he, kind of, came\n4 close.  I didn't move the camera all the way over.\n5      Q.   Do you recall Big Bird hugging a member of\n6 the family on the left?\n7      A.   It was either a high five or a hug, not\n8 necessarily two.\n9      Q.   So it's not necessarily both?  You don't\n10 recall?\n11      A.   I don't remember.\n12      Q.   Did you know the family in the stroller\n13 next door to you?\n14      A.   No.\n15           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.  Asked and\n16      answered.\n17 BY MS. PARDO:\n18      Q.   Okay.  This wasn't the family that you met\n19 up with in the park at some point that you knew from\n20 school?\n21      A.   No.  The lady looks like me.\n22      Q.   Got it.\n23                And is it your testimony that the\n24 video shows Big Bird high fiving the family on the\nJA294\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 295 of 1384\nPage 113\n1 right, anyone on the right side?\n2      A.   Yeah.  The child in the stroller.\n3      Q.   The child in the stroller?\n4      A.   Yes.\n5      Q.   It was, like, a high five?\n6      A.   Yes.\n7      Q.   Okay.  Did Big Bird give hugs to anybody\n8 on the right-hand side, with the right-hand side\n9 family?\n10      A.   I don't remember.  Once I moved the camera\n11 back around, I was looking the other way.\n12      Q.   Did Big Bird hug this girl in the\n13 stroller?\n14      A.   No.  Just a high five.\n15      Q.   So in your interrogatory answer where you\n16 said, \"The white families located on both sides of\n17 N.M. received high fives and hugs;\" is that\n18 accurate?\n19           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n20           THE WITNESS:  Well, like I said, I don't\n21      recall if it was a hug and high five, but the\n22      member from the lady sitting on the floor.\n23 BY MS. PARDO:\n24      Q.   Okay.  But it's your testimony that there\nJA295\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 296 of 1384\nPage 114\n1 were high fives on the left; is that right?\n2      A.   High fives on the left.\n3      Q.   High fives on the right?\n4      A.   It was high fives on the right.\n5      Q.   What about hugs?\n6      A.   I remember there were hugs as well as\n7 well.  There was no hugs on the right.\n8      Q.   No hugs on the right?\n9      A.   Yeah.\n10      Q.   Okay.  Hugs on the left?\n11      A.   I don't remember.  Because he came really\n12 close up to, like, a little boy or something.  I\n13 think you could see he had a book bag, moved up with\n14 the lady on the floor.  I don't remember if it was\n15 both.\n16      Q.   Okay.  So when you wrote, \"high fives and\n17 hugs,\" were you sure at the time that you had seen\n18 hugs?\n19      A.   Well, as a whole, with all of characters,\n20 that's what I referred to as high fives and hugs.\n21      Q.   Okay.  So not just Big Bird.\n22                You're saying hugs could have\n23 happened with other characters?\n24      A.   Yes.\nJA296\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 297 of 1384\nPage 120\n1      screen grab right away at the beginning.\n2      Maybe.\n3           MR.

Is this the second video that you\n12 made?\n13      A.   Yes.\n14      Q.   Okay.  And this was the video you provided\n15 to us in this lawsuit?\n16      A.   Yes.\n17      Q.   And is this the video that describes the\n18 incident with Grover that you referred to in the\n19 complaint?\n20      A.   Yes.\n21      Q.

Do you have other footage of any of the\n2 interactions with these characters?\n3      A.   No.\n4      Q.   And by \"these characters,\" I mean the same\n5 three that we've been talking about.\n6      A.   No.\n7      Q.   After this video, did you make any more\n8 videos of the parade route?\n9      A.   No.\n10      Q.   How come?\n11      A.   It was just over.\n12      Q.   They were at the end?\n13      A.   No.  I think it was a few more floats that\n14 came down and we just, kind of, walked off.\n15      Q.   Okay.  So you left the parade after the\n16 conclusion of this video?  Is that your testimony?\n17      A.   Once the rest of the floats came down,\n18 then we left.\n19      Q.   Oh, okay.  You waited until the end of the\n20 parade?\n21      A.   Yes.\n22      Q.

And the voice, \"N , say, 'Hi' to him,\"\n7 is that you as well?\n8      A.   Yes.\n9      Q.   I think you explained before.\n10                This came after the Big Bird came by,\n11 after?\n12      A.   Big Bird was first, and then this video.\n13      Q.   Big Bird was first and this one.  Okay.\n14                And did you edit this video in any\n15 way?\n16      A.   No.\n17      Q.   Did you cut it down from larger footage?\n18      A.   No.\n19      Q.   The minute and 32 seconds, is that the\n20 whole video you took?\n21      A.   Yes.\n22           MS. PARDO:  All right.  I want to go back\n23      to the Grover portion, which is really the\n24      first part, and if you could, pause around 07.\nJA299\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 300 of 1384\nPage 123\n1           (Whereupon, video recording was played.)\n2           MS.

No.\n14      Q.   Oh, okay.\n15           MS. PARDO:  And then you could continue.\n16           (Whereupon, video recording was played.)\n17           MS.

Yes.\n4      Q.   Okay.  Her skin doesn't look brown to you?\n5      A.   She was out in the sun, so I don't know.\n6      Q.   Okay.  And you have no basis to know\n7 whether she's Hispanic or not?\n8      A.   No.\n9      Q.   Do you have any way of knowing if Grover\n10 perceived this girl as being part of your family?\n11      A.   No.  She had an adult holding that\n12 stroller.\n13      Q.   Okay.  Does the video show Grover high\n14 fiving a white person?\n15      A.   Yes.\n16      Q.   Okay.  Which side of N. did that occur on?\n17      A.   Her right side.\n18      Q.   This side we're looking at now?\n19      A.   Yes, that's her right.\n20      Q.   Okay.  Okay.\n21      A.   It depends she's facing this way, so.\n22      Q.

You think he's high fiving someone else\n3 there?\n4      A.   Yeah.\n5      Q.   Okay.  And what's the race of the other\n6 person that he's high fiving?\n7      A.   That whole family is white.\n8      Q.   Does the video show Grover hugging a white\n9 person?\n10      A.   Not the video, no.\n11      Q.   Is it your testimony that Grover hugs\n12 somebody on the right side of you?\n13      A.   As he went down the line, he did, yes, but\n14 I didn't capture it in the video.\n15      Q.   Okay.  But considering the family just\n16 next to you --\n17      A.   Uh-huh.\n18      Q.   -- did Grover hug anybody in that family\n19 standing next to you?\n20      A.   No.\n21      Q.   Okay.

Then describe to me the high five\n10 your were mentioning about the left-side family.\n11      A.   Well, I don't think he came to the family\n12 next to us.  He came from across the other side.\n13      Q.   Okay.\n14      A.   Yeah.  But he interacted with the family\n15 on our right.\n16      Q.   On the right?\n17      A.   Yes.\n18      Q.

Anybody?\n3      Q.   Yeah.\n4      A.   Like I said, he came from the other side.\n5 That's what I was referring to earlier where they\n6 switch and go from side to side of the street.\n7      Q.   Okay.  But the video doesn't show Grover\n8 hugging anybody on the left side?\n9      A.   Yeah.\n10      Q.   Okay.  And do you recall whether Grover\n11 hugged anyone on your left side?\n12      A.   No.\n13      Q.   Okay.  Now, is it your testimony that\n14 Grover skipped N.?\n15      A.   Yes.\n16      Q.   Is it your testimony that Grover\n17 intentionally ignored your child?\n18      A.   Yes.\n19           MS. PARDO:  Okay.  Let's go to the Baby\n20      Bear section again.

PARDO:\n4      Q.   Okay.  So does the video clip we just saw\n5 show Baby Bear high fiving a white person?\n6      A.   Yes.\n7      Q.   Which side, to your right or your left?\n8      A.   Left.\n9      Q.   Is that the lady sitting next to you or\n10 somebody else?\n11      A.   I believe he high fived her or -- it was\n12 two of them sitting on the floor.  It was one of\n13 them two.\n14      Q.   The one in the pink?\n15      A.   Yeah.  And I think the lady that was\n16 standing up.\n17      Q.   Okay.  We haven't talked about the woman\n18 in the pink.\n19      A.   I don't show her as much, I guess, on the\n20 video.\n21      Q.   Do you know if that woman is Hispanic?\n22      A.   No.\n23      Q.   You don't know one way or the other?\n24      A.   No.\nJA305\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 306 of 1384\nPage 129\n1      Q.   What about Baby Bear?  Did he high five\n2 anyone on the right side?  We could run the clip\n3 again, if you want to check.\n4      A.

It was a high five?\n16      A.   Yeah.\n17      Q.   Okay.  And in that portion we just saw,\n18 was N. standing back a little bit from the yellow\n19 line?\n20      A.   I think just a little bit, but not much.\n21      Q.   Okay.  And what about the right-hand side?\n22 What kind of interaction did Baby Bear have on the\n23 right-hand side?\n24      A.

I don't remember from the family on\n9      the other side.\n10 BY MS. PARDO:\n11      Q.   Okay.  So you don't remember what Baby\n12 Bear did in terms of interactions with the family on\n13 the right side?\n14      A.   Once he passed my daughter, yeah.\n15      Q.   Okay.  And you don't have video of hugging\n16 or high fiving with anyone on the right side --\n17      A.   Yeah, I don't.\n18      Q.    -- with Baby Bear?\n19      A.   Yeah.\n20      Q.   Okay.

Honestly, I would say if things will\n12 change, you know, if the characters were a little\n13 more interacting, I guess if everybody gets that\n14 training to make everybody feel more inclusive, I\n15 would think about going back.\n16      Q.   Has N. asked to go back to Sesame Place?\n17      A.   She, kind of, sees the commercials, and\n18 she's just -- kind of, says, \"No.  They were mean to\n19 me there,\" so, you know...\n20      Q.   When you said, \"They were mean to me,\" did\n21 you follow up and ask her what she meant by that?\n22      A.   I said, \"Why do you say that?\"  She said,\n23 \"They didn't say, 'Hi' to me\" or didn't give her a\n24 high five.\nJA308\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 309 of 1384\nPage 144\n1 to say that you've seen such providers since you\n2 wrote that, right?\n3      A.

Yes.\n12      Q.   Describe to me what you mean by \"racial\n13 trauma.\"\n14      A.   Just to have that feeling of feeling\n15 discriminated on.\n16      Q.   Okay.  Tell me about that feeling.\n17      A.   It makes you feel less than or unworthy\n18 of.\n19      Q.   Okay.  What does the word \"trauma\" mean to\n20 you as you used it here?\n21      A.

On June 25th, 2022?\n3      A.   Correct.\n4      Q.   And then after you went home, did you call\n5 Sesame Place?\n6      A.   I did not.\n7      Q.   Did you send an e-mail to Sesame Place?\n8      A.   No.  That day, I had -- it was a lot going\n9 on for me.  The trip itself, I live in Connecticut,\n10 so it took me probably, overall, three hours to\n11 get -- four hours to get home.  I wasn't in the\n12 right state of mind to, kind of, take care of it in\n13 the moment.  It took me time to unravel the\n14 situation that was at hand.  And, of course, maybe a\n15 week later down the line, that's when I seen the\n16 video go viral on the Internet and the news.\n17      Q.   The viral video that we've been talking\n18 about, do you know what character was involved in\n19 that video?\n20      A.   I don't remember because I'm not -- I\n21 don't remember them by character.  I do remember\n22 that the children were being neglected.  They were\n23 being disregarded, and then, of course, they did\n24 service, you know, other children.  But I -- when it\nJA317\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 318 of 1384\nPage 19\n1 comes to the characters, I don't know them by name,\n2 so.\n3      Q.   Did you show your daughter, E , that\n4 video?\n5      A.   I tried not to.  So, of course, everything\n6 is inevitable, especially with children.  They could\n7 get into the hands of everything.  She seen it\n8 herself, and then she said, \"Mommy, is this what\n9 happened to me?\" because when it happened and she\n10 was questioning why she was being ignored, and she\n11 asked, \"Why?\"  And of course, she's an innocent\n12 child, so I tried to conceal that at the moment so\n13 she could enjoy the moment.  However, once it was on\n14 the news and it was discussing, you know, it was\n15 racial discrimination, she did see it.  She came\n16 across it and asked me about it.\n17      Q.   So you didn't show her the video, but she\n18 saw it some other way?\n19      A.   Yes.  Mhm.\n20      Q.   I think before you said you were concerned\n21 about the lack of protocol at Sesame Place.\n22                What did you mean by that?\n23      A.   When it comes to being patient with the\n24 children.  Just overall, besides the characters, the\nJA318\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 319 of 1384\nPage 20\n1 employees there as well.  Before even the parade,\n2 there was just a lack of patience with children.  In\n3 an establishment like this where you are, the\n4 majority of your customers are mostly children\n5 because you're there to see the characters, have a\n6 good time, and enjoy the amenities that come with\n7 the park.  It was just the lack of communication.\n8 They weren't enthusiastic.\n9                For example, if you go to Disney\n10 World, you'll see that a lot of employees there are\n11 smiling, excited.  They always greet.  We did not\n12 receive that services.  That day was very\n13 unpleasant, so I think in these cases, with\n14 establishments like that, especially when you are\n15 catering to children, I think protocol should be to\n16 be able to have good charisma, character, along with\n17 patience with children, all types of children.\n18      Q.   So you think they should have a protocol\n19 that employees have to have charisma?\n20      A.   I would say, \"charisma,\" along with great\n21 character, great spirits, because you are dealing\n22 with children, along with patience.  You have to\n23 remember that a lot of children do come there, you\n24 know, because they admire these characters, they see\nJA319\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 320 of 1384\nPage 21\n1 them on TV.  So they do want to meet them.  They get\n2 excited.  And they shouldn't, you know, look at\n3 children -- you know, because I felt like it was a\n4 distaste for them to, at least, approach my child,\n5 and she was very sad.  So with that being said, in\n6 that case if they were going to be attentive to a\n7 child next to her, they should have -- the protocol\n8 should have been followed for every children that\n9 was going after them as well for the same thing.\n10      Q.   So this lack of charisma, lack of\n11 communication, is that part of your lawsuit today?\n12      A.   Mostly discrimination, but yes.  I do\n13 believe that there's a bigger picture here.  I think\n14 there might have been a lack training for the\n15 characters.  I will be honest with you.  Because it\n16 is very delicate when you are dealing with children.\n17                Just as you know, to become a\n18 teacher, you have to go to school.  You have to take\n19 classes, and, you know, follow the protocols when it\n20 comes to, you know, being in the hands of children.\n21 I don't think they followed that protocol.  I don't\n22 think there was proper training just because of the\n23 way they handling a lot of things.  They seemed to\n24 be overwhelmed, annoyed, and upset, when the\nJA320\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 321 of 1384\nPage 22\n1 children -- at least my child was trying to greet\n2 them.  You know, if that's, you know, your job, you\n3 should know you're going to see children that are\n4 admiring you.  Just when like when you go to, for\n5 example, a concert of your favorite artist.  You're\n6 going to want to be excited, meet your artist, so\n7 and so.\n8                So in this case, I don't think, you\n9 know, they were properly trained in that aspect, so.\n10      Q.   Do you have any personal knowledge about\n11 what kind training Sesame Place employees receive?\n12      A.   I don't have that, but based on what I\n13 seen that day that I was, along with all of these\n14 other parents that are in a similar situation, a lot\n15 of it is on video, it just seems like there was lack\n16 of training or they might have violated codes.\n17 Either way, it's a loss on both ends.  Because if\n18 the employee said that they followed the protocol\n19 that was given to them or they didn't have any, lack\n20 of protocol or lack training, this goes to the\n21 company's name.  If it's directly to the employee --\n22 employer -- employee itself, then that's a bigger\n23 issue as well.  Because they're violating the codes\n24 and not following the rules that are being provided\nJA321\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 322 of 1384\nPage 23\n1 to them.\n2      Q.   So you, I think, mentioned violating codes\n3 a couple of times.\n4                What codes do you think have been\n5 violated?\n6      A.   It's plain and simple.  It's\n7 discrimination.  Also, if I'm taking my child to a\n8 park and I'm paying for the services, paying for the\n9 parking, paying for everything that comes along with\n10 it, along with merchandise and food, everything like\n11 that, we're coming here, bringing in revenue to the\n12 company itself, and the bigger picture, along with\n13 the amenities, the children want to meet these\n14 characters.  They want to interact.  That's a lot\n15 of -- if you see online, that's a lot of things they\n16 do, lot of things they say.  That didn't happen.\n17 They neglected my child, and they went and spoke to\n18 the other children.  And that was also\n19 discrimination.  And then, like, you know, yelling\n20 at my child as well because she's passing the line,\n21 you know, from the parade, but when there's another\n22 children on the side of her doing the same thing,\n23 there's not an issue with that.  That's a bit\n24 concerning, so.\nJA322\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 323 of 1384\nPage 32\n1 BY MS. BAZAN:\n2      Q.   Okay.  Do you know when the trial date for\n3 this case is?\n4           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n5           THE WITNESS:  From what I was told, some\n6      time possibly in November of 2024, I think it\n7      is.  I'm not too sure.\n8 BY MS. BAZAN:\n9      Q.   What are you seeking out of this lawsuit\n10 for yourself?\n11      A.   Justice.  Just to avoid situations like\n12 this going forward, for my grandchildren, for my\n13 children's children, and so on.\n14      Q.   Anything else?\n15      A.   That's about it.\n16      Q.   What about for the other class members?\n17 What are you seeking out of this lawsuit for them?\n18           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n19           THE WITNESS:  I think we're all here for\n20      the same thing, justice.  They need to\n21      implement more rules, I would say, implement\n22      proper training, just not with the protocols,\n23      but also, you know, maybe a racial\n24      discrimination class and what it entails, what\nJA323\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 324 of 1384\nPage 33\n1      could possibly happen when you're racially\n2      discriminating against children that are\n3      innocent to that, so.\n4 BY MS. BAZAN:\n5      Q.   So other than, like, the trainings and\n6 knowledge about racial discrimination, anything else\n7 that you're seeking for the other class members in\n8 this case?\n9           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n10           THE WITNESS:  I don't have answer to that.\n11 BY MS. BAZAN:\n12      Q.   Nothing that you can say?\n13      A.   At the moment, no.\n14      Q.   Ms. Romero, what year we are you born?\n15      A.   1994.\n16      Q.   What's your address?\n17      A.   Am I able to provide my address?  I'm not\n18 sure.\n19           MR.

So I wanted something closer,\n3 which was New Rochelle, which was 22 minutes of a\n4 commute from my house and then -- yeah.\n5      Q.   Have you ever worked at Sesame Place?\n6      A.   No.\n7      Q.   To your knowledge, do you know anyone\n8 whose worked at Sesame Place?\n9      A.   Not at all.\n10      Q.   Have you ever worked for Seaworld?\n11      A.   No.\n12      Q.   To your knowledge, do you know anyone\n13 who's worked for Seaworld?\n14      A.   No.\n15      Q.   Have you ever worked for any theme park or\n16 amusement park?\n17      A.   No.\n18      Q.   Did you have a contract with Seaworld or\n19 Sesame Place for the June 25th, 2022 visit that\n20 you're suing over?\n21           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n22           You can answer.\n23           THE WITNESS:  From what I recall, when I\n24      did make the purchase -- you know, if I'm not\nJA325\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 326 of 1384\nPage 41\n1      mistaking, I -- I'm trying to think because I\n2      don't want to give the wrong answer.  It was a\n3      contract, you know, when I did get the tickets\n4      and make the purchase, if I'm not mistaking.\n5 BY MS. BAZAN:\n6      Q.   So what was the contract?\n7           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection, again.\n8           You can answer.\n9           THE WITNESS:  You know, to service us at\n10      the park.  At the moment, I don't remember.  So\n11      I can't -- I don't want to give out any answer\n12      without remembrance.\n13 BY MS. BAZAN:\n14      Q.   If there was a contract, who was the\n15 contract between?\n16           MR. RICHARDSON:  Same objection.\n17           You can answer.\n18           THE WITNESS:  Myself, along with my\n19      daughter, who was part of the purchasing,\n20      Seaworld Works, Sesame Place because, you know,\n21      Seaworld Works is the corporation, and Sesame\n22      Place is where we went to be serviced, for\n23      entertainment.\n24 BY MS.

So you think you might have had a contract\n2 with you and E  -- sorry -- you and E.C. on one\n3 side, and Seaworld Works and Sesame Place on the\n4 other side?\n5      A.   Yes.  Because they're servicing us for the\n6 entertainment that they're providing us for what\n7 we're paying for.\n8      Q.   Is the contract memorialized in your\n9 tickets?\n10           MR.

Well, do you have factual basis for\n15 claiming a contract, other than your tickets?\n16      A.   Can you elaborate on that question just so\n17 I can get a better understanding?\n18           MR. RICHARDSON:  May I have a continuing\n19      objection to your references to the contract,\n20      which calls for legal conclusions she may not\n21      be able to render.  I want to have that\n22      continuing objection so I don't have to\n23      interrupt you.\n24           MS.

So now, are you saying that the\n2 contract was the tickets and the terms and\n3 conditions?\n4           MR.

Do you recognize this as a printout of an\n21 e-mail you received on June 25th, 2022 from Sesame\n22 Place?\n23      A.   Yes.  This is the confirmation of my\n24 purchase to the park.\nJA328\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 329 of 1384\nPage 48\n1      Q.   And on the first page, the To line is to\n2 YoselisRomero94@GMail.com.\n3                Is that your e-mail address?\n4      A.   Yes.  That is my personal e-mail address.\n5      Q.   Okay.  On the third page that has the\n6 number 6 at the bottom --\n7      A.   Okay.\n8      Q.   -- it looks like you purchased two\n9 single-day tickets for June 25th, 2022, one for you\n10 and one for E.C.; is that correct?\n11      A.   That is correct.\n12      Q.   And the total amount for the two tickets,\n13 plus the tax and the service fee was $116.97; is\n14 that right?\n15      A.   That is correct.\n16      Q.   How did you pay for these tickets?\n17      A.   My card, my bank card.\n18      Q.   Your -- is it a debit card or credit card?\n19      A.   Debit card.  Mhm.\n20      Q.   And whose bank account is that debit card\n21 attached to?\n22      A.   Mine.\n23      Q.   And do you have a bank statement that\n24 reflects this purchase with your debit card?\nJA329\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 330 of 1384\nPage 49\n1      A.   Yep.\n2      Q.   Did you provide that to your lawyer?\n3      A.   I don't think so.\n4      Q.   Could you provide that to your lawyer so\n5 it could be produced to us?\n6      A.   Absolutely; absolutely.\n7      Q.   Thank you.\n8      A.   Mhm.\n9      Q.   On the last page of the exhibit, page 8,\n10 Romero 8 is on the bottom.\n11      A.   Okay.\n12      Q.   At the very bottom in red text, it says,\n13 \"Please be aware this message was received from\n14 outside the Murphy Falcon & Murphy organization.\"\n15                Do you see that?\n16      A.   Yes.\n17      Q.   Did the e-mail you received from Sesame\n18 Place have that language on there?\n19           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n20           THE WITNESS:  It did not.\n21           MR. RICHARDSON:  Of course not.\n22 BY MS. BAZAN:\n23      Q.   Well, do you know why it says that?\n24      A.   Because if I sent it over to their e-mail,\nJA330\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 331 of 1384\nPage 50\n1 it's possibly notifying them that this is an outside\n2 e-mail, and it's not internal.  It's external.  That\n3 could be possible.\n4           MR. RICHARDSON:  Very possible.\n5 BY MS. BAZAN:\n6      Q.   Other than that red text on the bottom, is\n7 there anything else that's different about this\n8 document than the e-mail you received from Sesame\n9 Place on June 20- --\n10      A.   Everything looks absolutely the same.\n11      Q.   So is this e-mail confirmation of your\n12 ticket purchase, or is this the e-mail of your\n13 tickets?\n14      A.   This is not the e-mail of my tickets;\n15 however, this is the confirmation along with the\n16 itinerary.  It provides my card -- my card\n17 information, along with the order number, the date,\n18 my address, and the two parties that were involved\n19 in the purchase, which was myself and my daughter.\n20      Q.   Okay.  So when you went to Sesame Place on\n21 June 25th, you didn't show them this e-mail to get\n22 in, right?  You showed them something else?\n23      A.   I think they had to scan something, a bar\n24 code.\nJA331\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 332 of 1384\nPage 51\n1      Q.   Okay.  Where was that bar code located?\n2      A.   On my phone.\n3      Q.   Okay.  Were there tickets attached to this\n4 e-mail and that's what you pulled up on your phone\n5 for them to scan?\n6      A.   No.  If I'm not mistaking, I think it was\n7 another link where I had to press and save to it to\n8 my iPhone and it came up in the wallets.  That's how\n9 I was able to provide the E-ticket to the people at\n10 the park at admissions.\n11      Q.   On the first page of this exhibit above\n12 the Big Bird icon, it says, \"Thank you for your\n13 purchase.  Your tickets are enclosed.\"\n14      A.   Okay.\n15      Q.   Do you see that?\n16      A.   Yes.\n17      Q.   Does that refresh your recollection about\n18 whether there were tickets attached to this e-mail?\n19      A.   Yes.  It's at the bottom -- if it's\n20 attached.  I said it was an attachment they had sent\n21 me an e-mail with attachments of that so I could\n22 download it directly to my iPhone.\n23      Q.   Okay.  So the attachment --\n24      A.   To make it accessible to the people that\nJA332\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 333 of 1384\nPage 52\n1 were at the gate.\n2      Q.   So you think there were attachments to\n3 this e-mail with your tickets?\n4      A.   No.\n5      Q.   No.  Okay.\n6      A.   It might have been sent over in another\n7 e-mail right after that one, if I'm not mistaken.\n8      Q.   Everyone though this e-mail says, \"Your\n9 tickets are enclosed,\" you think your tickets were\n10 in a different e-mail?\n11      A.   Yeah.  If you want, I can actually look\n12 into my phone and recheck my e-mail just to make\n13 sure, if but I'm pretty sure if I forwarded them,\n14 they would provide that information as well, if, you\n15 know, the tickets were attached.\n16      Q.   Well, maybe we could look on a break.\n17      A.   Okay.  Perfect.  That works.\n18      Q.   All right.  Do you remember seeing the\n19 tickets on your phone in your wallet that you pulled\n20 up to show?\n21      A.   Yeah.  That's the way I was able to scan\n22 the bar codes.\n23      Q.   All right.  I'm going to show what's been\n24 marked as Exhibit 4.\nJA333\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 334 of 1384\nPage 53\n1      A.   Okay.\n2                (Exhibit Romero-4 marked for\n3 identification.)\n4           MR. RICHARDSON:  Thank you.\n5 BY MS. BAZAN:\n6      Q.   So this is a document filed by Seaworld in\n7 this case as Document 29-3.\n8      A.   Okay.\n9      Q.   Do you recognize this?\n10      A.   This is probably the bar code that they\n11 scanned, that they were able to scan through my\n12 iPhone.  Mhm.\n13      Q.   Okay.  So when you went to Sesame Place on\n14 June 25th, this is what you showed them to get\n15 scanned?\n16      A.   On my phone, correct.\n17      Q.   Did you order your tickets online and then\n18 you received them via e-mail?  Is that how it\n19 worked?\n20      A.   Correct.  I was able to obtain the tickets\n21 and download them directly to my phone.\n22      Q.   And did you get them online from the\n23 Sesame Place website or somewhere else online?\n24      A.   Sesame Place website.\nJA334\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 335 of 1384\nPage 54\n1      Q.   While you were on the Sesame Place website\n2 to order the tickets, did you print anything from\n3 that website out?\n4      A.   Unfortunately, no.  Because I was at the\n5 park and there was no access to the printer.\n6 Everything was electronic.\n7      Q.   You were at the park when you ordered\n8 tickets online?\n9      A.   Yes.  They were having issues at the kiosk\n10 to purchase the ticket in person.  There was a large\n11 line as well.\n12      Q.   So when you got that e-mail that we looked\n13 at, you were physically at the park?\n14      A.   Yes.\n15                If you see in the attachment where I\n16 have my e-mail, it has the time, which ranged around\n17 the time I arrived at the park, which was around\n18 12:30.\n19      Q.   I'm going to show you Exhibit 5.\n20      A.   Thank you.\n21                (Exhibit Romero-5 marked for\n22 identification.)\n23           MR. RICHARDSON:  Thank you.\n24 BY MS.

And so this certification that you signed\n3 says, \"I solemnly affirm under the penalties of\n4 perjury.\"\n5      A.   Mhm.\n6      Q.   So did you not know what that meant when\n7 you signed it?\n8      A.   They did elaborate at the moment.  But, of\n9 course, this -- I didn't go to law school,\n10 unfortunately.  So I don't have the knowledge of\n11 that -- to remember from time and time.  But, of\n12 course, they definitely educated throughout the\n13 process of everything at the moment.  But, of\n14 course, with everything else in life, I guess that's\n15 not something I'm going to remember day to day.\n16      Q.   So you understand when you gave these\n17 answers, you swore to tell the truth?\n18      A.   And that is correct.  Mhm.\n19      Q.   Were these responses truthful?\n20      A.   That is correct.\n21      Q.   Okay.  Let's go to page 2 of this document\n22 and look at interrogatory number 1.\n23      A.   Okay.\n24      Q.

Okay.\n4      Q.   Your answer to this interrogatory only\n5 mentions your June 25th, 2022 trip to Sesame Place.\n6      A.   Okay.\n7      Q.   Was that the only time you've been to\n8 Sesame Place in the last five years?\n9      A.   Yes.  Before that was in the '90s when I\n10 was a child.\n11      Q.   And is the June 25th trip the only time\n12 that E.C. has been to Sesame Place in the last five\n13 years?\n14      A.   Yeah.  She's never been.\n15      Q.   And you haven't been back to Sesame Place\n16 since June 25th, 2022, right?\n17           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.  Asked and\n18      answered.\n19 BY MS. BAZAN:\n20      Q.   And E.C. hasn't been back to Sesame Place\n21 since June of 2022?\n22      A.   Absolutely not.\n23           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.  Asked and\n24      answered.\nJA337\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 338 of 1384\nPage 59\n1 BY MS. BAZAN:\n2      Q.   Do you have any plans to go back to Sesame\n3 Place?\n4      A.   If they implement changes in the future, I\n5 would be open for it.  If they do not implement any\n6 changes, then absolutely not.\n7      Q.   But right now, you haven't bought tickets?\n8      A.   Absolutely not.\n9      Q.   You haven't made a plan?\n10      A.   Not at all.\n11      Q.   You haven't put it on the calendar?\n12      A.   Absolutely not.\n13      Q.   Same question for E.C.\n14                Any plans for E.C. to go back to\n15 Sesame Place?\n16      A.   She does not want to go back.\n17      Q.   So no plans to take her back against her\n18 will?\n19      A.   Absolutely not.\n20      Q.   Do you believe that every child that goes\n21 to Sesame Place is entitled to a hug from every\n22 Sesame Street character?\n23           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n24           THE WITNESS:  Can I answer that?\nJA338\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 339 of 1384\nPage 60\n1           MR. RICHARDSON:  Yes, you can answer.\n2           THE WITNESS:  It's not -- I'm not saying\n3      it's required, but if my child is reaching out\n4      for a hug and gets rejected while a child next\n5      to her does the same thing with the same hand\n6      movements and everything and gets a hug\n7      directly after her getting rejected, then yes,\n8      I feel like that is wrong, so.\n9 BY MS. BAZAN:\n10      Q.   And then it's required for the character\n11 to go back and give your child a hug?  Is that\n12 you're testimony?\n13      A.   For, like, I said before, people dealing\n14 and working with kids should be aware of how things\n15 like that could affect children.  Unfairness, along\n16 with discrimination, and can even build future\n17 trauma.\n18                So, you know, even me, as a mother of\n19 two kids, you know, I try to be fair on both ends\n20 because if you cater to one child more than the\n21 other, it's, kind of, like you're neglecting,\n22 especially if they're doing the same thing.\n23                My daughter did reach out, you know,\n24 to receive a hug from the characters and she was\nJA339\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 340 of 1384\nPage 61\n1 rejected and then someone right next to her didn't\n2 get rejected.  I think that was unfair.  I think\n3 that was, especially, you know, when you know you're\n4 dealing with children and the ins and outs of it and\n5 how it can affect them, I think that was not right.\n6      Q.   So am I understanding you right?  You're\n7 not saying that you think every child that goes to\n8 Sesame Place is entitled to a hug from every Sesame\n9 Street character; it's just if the child wants a\n10 hug?\n11           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n12           THE WITNESS:  If the child is reaching for\n13      a hug, I think it's only right.  I've been to\n14      Sesame -- I mean, to Disney World before and\n15      did the comparison of the few.  I've never seen\n16      that type of behavior.  If they see a child\n17      reaching out for a hug, they do go out and give\n18      the hug.  But my child, obviously, was\n19      rejected, and there was a child who looked\n20      complete opposite of her who was actually given\n21      a hug right after.\n22 BY MS. BAZAN:\n23      Q.   Do you believe that every child that goes\n24 to Sesame Place is entitled to a high five from\nJA340\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 341 of 1384\nPage 62\n1 every Sesame Street character?\n2           MR. RICHARDSON:  Same objection.\n3           You can answer.\n4           THE WITNESS:  Only if the child wants a\n5      hug because there are children who are afraid\n6      of cartoon characters, afraid of costume\n7      characters.  And there are children that won't\n8      want that at all.\n9           But if a child is reaching out and they're\n10      close enough in the proximity where they can\n11      just take maybe a few seconds out of their time\n12      to give them a high five, I think that should\n13      be granted.  I know out of maybe out of all of\n14      the kids there, there was many of others who\n15      probably didn't care to give a hug.  But I feel\n16      like if there's a child reaching out for one, a\n17      hug, a high five, I think that should be\n18      granted.  We did, you know, make the purchases\n19      for those tickets to get those services, along\n20      with interactions with the characters, so.\n21 BY MS. BAZAN:\n22      Q.   Do you think that the characters in the\n23 parade at Sesame Place have time to hug every child\n24 that wants a hug on the parade route?\nJA341\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 342 of 1384\nPage 63\n1      A.   I do understand this was all in a timely\n2 matter.  I did take that into consideration.  Until\n3 it happened three times and my daughter was\n4 disregarded several times and was basically\n5 disregarded and the person next to us was --\n6 received the attention.  It was evident it was\n7 discrimination.\n8      Q.   But you don't disagree that the characters\n9 don't have time to give every child a hug, right?\n10           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n11           THE WITNESS:  I think to an extent, it\n12      could be possible, but I do believe that the\n13      key to the parade is for them to interact with\n14      children, with the children, because that's\n15      what the children are there for, to meet their\n16      characters, to see their favorite characters.\n17      There are plenty of parks that actually do take\n18      the time, high five or hug.  I've seen them.\n19      The characters did go to other children to\n20      interact, but there was a specific kind of\n21      children.  That's where I feel like there was a\n22      discrepancy in that, so.\n23 BY MS. BAZAN:\n24      Q.   Do you believe that every child that goes\nJA342\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 343 of 1384\nPage 64\n1 to Sesame Place is entitled to be blown a kiss from\n2 every Sesame Street?\n3           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n4           THE WITNESS:  I don't think.  I'm not\n5      sure.\n6 BY MS. BAZAN:\n7      Q.   Do you think a child that goes to Sesame\n8 Place is entitled to be picked up by every Sesame\n9 Street character?\n10           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n11           THE WITNESS:  Me, personally, I wouldn't\n12      want the costume character to pick up my child;\n13      however, a hug or an interaction, high five\n14      would -- you know.  But neglecting them while\n15      they're reaching out, you know, for some type\n16      of acknowledgment, that's where I feel like\n17      they went wrong in this matter.\n18 BY MS. BAZAN:\n19      Q.   So how is it that -- how are you deciding\n20 that a child is entitled to a hug or high five, but\n21 not to be blown a kiss or be picked up?\n22           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n23           THE WITNESS:  I mean, like I said, when\n24      you're not only dealing with children, but\nJA343\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 344 of 1384\nPage 65\n1      people, I know they can tell the body language,\n2      just as they knew the child next to them wanted\n3      a hug and a high five.  They would know more or\n4      less when the child wants to be picked up or\n5      not.  That's my preference.  I know my\n6      daughter, she just wanted a hug.  I'm speaking\n7      as far as my child.  She wanted a hug.  She\n8      wanted even a high five, some type of\n9      acknowledgment.  That wasn't given to her, so.\n10 BY MS. BAZAN:\n11      Q.   If she had gotten any type of\n12 acknowledgment, would you be suing?\n13      A.   It was just not the acknowledgment.  It's\n14 not even about the lack of acknowledgment, because\n15 if it was something across the board, it would be\n16 justified, but it was very selective.  They picked\n17 and choose who they wanted to cater to, who they\n18 wanted to acknowledge.  That's where my frustration\n19 alies.  If it was something where, like you said, it\n20 could possibly by timing.  Maybe they don't have\n21 enough time.  If it was that it was a parade and\n22 they went straight through the parade without taking\n23 the time to acknowledge and interact with other\n24 children, I would say the issue overall is more that\nJA344\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 345 of 1384\nPage 66\n1 they have to abide to the time.\n2                However, if they are taking time\n3 during the parade to reach out to other children,\n4 and you know, basically being selective of who they\n5 choose to interact with, that right there is\n6 inevitable to disagree and say that wasn't\n7 discrimination, because it was obviously -- it was\n8 too much of a coincidence.\n9      Q.   So if the characters decide to interact\n10 with any child, they have to interact with every\n11 child in the way that that child wants to be\n12 interacted with?\n13      A.   If the child is asking for the same thing,\n14 like I said before, as a child next to them, if\n15 they're both asking for the same thing, whether it's\n16 a high five, whether it's a hug, if they're able to\n17 take the time to do it for one child, then they\n18 should be able to do the same for the other child\n19 that's asking.  If they feel like they don't have\n20 enough time, if they could only do one or the\n21 other -- or at least Sesame Place itself should\n22 incorporate a rule where they should just continue\n23 the parade without having any interaction with the\n24 children and just follow the protocol performances,\nJA345\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 346 of 1384\nPage 67\n1 but if you're going to take the time to select who\n2 you're going to, you know, entertain and, you know,\n3 give the attention to and you pick and choose, then\n4 that, kind of, turns into a disadvantage to her\n5 children.\n6                Because my daughter had to witness\n7 seeing the children next to her giving attention to\n8 and getting everything they wanted when she did the\n9 same thing.  So it's like if we're both next to each\n10 other and we're both here asking for a hug and I'm\n11 not getting a hug, but the child next to me is, what\n12 did I do different for them to neglect me?  If they\n13 don't have enough time to go to every children, they\n14 need to be aware that you're dealing with children.\n15                So, in this case, implement a rule\n16 where the character continues to do the performance\n17 they have to do at the parade and just go straight\n18 forward without interacting with any of them at all.\n19 If that was implemented before, then we would never\n20 be in this predicament.  We would never be here.\n21 There would never be, you know, Quinton going to my\n22 lawyer to bring justice to this matter, but for the\n23 simple fact that they went and chose who they wanted\n24 to interact with, very bias.  And I say that was\nJA346\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 347 of 1384\nPage 68\n1 discriminating against my child and others, of\n2 course.\n3           MR. RICHARDSON:  Is this a good time to\n4      take a short break?  I want to check on the\n5      child.\n6           THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  I wanted to do the\n7      same thing.\n8           VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 11:48 a.m.\n9      We're going off the video record.\n10                (Recess taken from 11:48 a.m. to\n11 12:00 p.m.)\n12           VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 12:00 p.m.\n13      We're back on the video record.\n14 BY MS. BAZAN:\n15      Q.   Ms. Romero, during the break we just took,\n16 did you talk to anyone other than counsel and your\n17 daughter?\n18      A.   No.\n19      Q.   I think earlier you were testifying a\n20 little bit about Disney.\n21                Was it Disney Land or Disney World?\n22      A.   Disney World in Orlando, Florida.\n23      Q.   And had you been to Disney World in\n24 Orlando?\nJA347\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 348 of 1384\nPage 77\n1 actual tickets with the bar code.\n2      A.   Okay.\n3      Q.   There's no promises on the tickets\n4 themselves about interactions with Sesame Street\n5 costume characters, right?\n6      A.   Okay.  So it's -- I mean, you're correct\n7 about that, but was there also stated that they\n8 could possibly interact with the children?  Because\n9 if there are other children that didn't want to be\n10 interacted with and they came to approached them\n11 without any approval because they did go up to other\n12 children.  So it doesn't state that here as well\n13 that they could pick and choose who they interact\n14 with.  If it's going to be that way, it should have\n15 been all across the board.  That's my theory.\n16      Q.   And that language that you just described,\n17 did you see that anywhere?\n18      A.   Can you elaborate on that so I could give\n19 you a proper answer?\n20      Q.   Well, to paraphrase your last answer, you\n21 were talking about, you know, if you're going to\n22 engage with anyone, you should engage with everyone.\n23                Did you see that somewhere?\n24      A.   I did not see that, but, however, they did\nJA348\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 349 of 1384\nPage 78\n1 say, \"Subject to change,\" meaning they could justify\n2 not interacting with my daughter.  How could that be\n3 justified, but they could go interact with other\n4 children?  I don't think that makes quite sense.  I\n5 think that's, kind of -- I don't know.  I don't\n6 think --\n7      Q.   You don't think it makes sense?\n8      A.   That's, you know, contradicting, in a way.\n9      Q.   What is contradicting what?\n10      A.   So as you see here, because if you look at\n11 Exhibit 3 on page -- one second -- on page 3, they\n12 do say, \"Park, products, services, and schedule\n13 subject to change without prior notice.\"  If it's\n14 one parade where I say all across the board the kids\n15 are not being engaged, meaning they're not\n16 interacting with any children and they possibly\n17 might interact with other children at the following\n18 parade at other times maybe because time -- you\n19 know, maybe they have more time to interact, and\n20 other time we went they didn't have enough time.\n21 However, if they could pick and choose from one\n22 second to another to interact with children,\n23 they're, kind of -- that's, to me, a contradiction.\n24 Because they're subject to not have to interact, but\nJA349\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 350 of 1384\nPage 79\n1 they can pick and choose who to interact with?\n2 That's, kind of -- I'm sorry.  It doesn't make\n3 sense.\n4      Q.   Are you saying this language on Exhibit 3\n5 is saying they can pick and choose who they want to\n6 interact with or not?\n7      A.   As I stated before, it doesn't.  And I\n8 don't think that pick and chooses, it doesn't say\n9 anything about that, not interacting with children.\n10 Says, \"park products, services, and schedules are\n11 subject to change.\"  So the services, in this\n12 situation, I would say, in the parade is more of an\n13 interaction, you know, entertainment.  The products,\n14 park products, I don't think, correlate with the\n15 entertainment that they provide, the services.  It's\n16 more of the amenities that come with it.  The\n17 entertainment is just something I think far\n18 different.  They stated, \"schedules.\"  And schedules\n19 is more -- the parade is subject to start at 3:00\n20 and started at 4 o'clock.  In this case, there's\n21 nothing stating whether they will deny or reject the\n22 children, you know, as far as the characters go with\n23 interaction.\n24      Q.   In addition to you and he E.C., did anyone\nJA350\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 351 of 1384\nPage 83\n1 purchased earlier, it was just two tickets, one for\n2 you and one for E.C.\n3                Did you not have to purchase a ticket\n4 for your younger daughter because she was under 2?\n5      A.   She was under 2 years old.\n6      Q.   Going to show you --\n7      A.   Thank you.\n8      Q.    -- Exhibit 7.\n9                (Exhibit Romero-7 marked for\n10 identification.)\n11 BY MS. BAZAN:\n12      Q.   Which is a picture.  And at the bottom, it\n13 says, \"Romero 0001.\"\n14      A.   Okay.\n15      Q.   Do you recognize this picture?\n16      A.   Yes.\n17      Q.   Okay.  Did you take this picture?\n18      A.   Yes, I did.\n19      Q.   And is this from your June 25th, 2022\n20 visit to Sesame Place that you're suing about?\n21      A.   That is correct.\n22      Q.   Is E.C. the girl in the bright pink,\n23 long-sleeve top?\n24      A.   That is correct.\nJA351\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 352 of 1384\nPage 85\n1 wanted to give my children the same experience that\n2 I had.\n3                When I did go to the parade, I\n4 noticed a lot of things have changed, the dynamic of\n5 the interactions with the children, the patience\n6 they have with the children.  Because along with the\n7 fact they were being neglected, they were also\n8 yelling at particular children about, I guess,\n9 crossing -- there's, like, a yellow line where you\n10 can't cross; however, there was a few that were able\n11 to exceed that line and kind of get closer in the\n12 favor of the character.\n13                Overall, my daughter, E  R\n14 C , was very excited to see these characters,\n15 to interact, to possibly get some type of\n16 acknowledgment, a hug, high five.  She did not get\n17 that.  To me, I automatically, the first time, \"It's\n18 a lot going on.  It's busy.  They're on a time\n19 schedule.\"  However, seeing that they neglected my\n20 daughter and then someone to the right of her was\n21 not being neglected and they followed the same -- I\n22 guess I won't say, \"protocol,\" but followed the same\n23 thing my daughter did.  Reached out for a hug, put\n24 her hand out.  The person got a hug and more, while\nJA352\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 353 of 1384\nPage 86\n1 my daughter did not receive that.\n2                So that, I was very abhor, because I\n3 noticed there was some type of favoritism, and I\n4 didn't like that because my daughter tried to go\n5 above and beyond to be acknowledged, you know,\n6 the -- you know, I drove far.  I drove from\n7 Stamford, Connecticut all the way to Philadelphia,\n8 pretty much, to get my daughter the experience to\n9 see her favorite characters up close and personal.\n10 And possibly, potentially get some type of\n11 acknowledge.  I do understand that things could\n12 happen at a timely manner.  But if my child is being\n13 neglected and others next to her are receiving the\n14 attention she was looking for, that's when I was\n15 upset.\n16                That was one of many things that was,\n17 you know, happening at the park.  So that's why I'm\n18 here today.  You know, to get to the root of, to\n19 find a solution, you know, what could possibly be\n20 the logical reason as to why.  Not only my child,\n21 but other children that are part of this class\n22 action lawsuit and the other people working with Ron\n23 and the others, what possibly brought these\n24 characters to do the same thing to the children of\nJA353\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 354 of 1384\nPage 87\n1 color, the minority, so yeah.\n2      Q.   So are you suing because employees of\n3 Sesame Place were not patient with children?\n4      A.   Overall discrimination.  Discrimination.\n5 It's also the lack of patience with the children.\n6 The interaction, you know, was at a very low with my\n7 daughter.  And, you know, they serviced other\n8 children around them that were opposite from skin\n9 color, hair color, everything.  You know, and some\n10 justice needs to be brought up.  Because if we never\n11 did this, if we are not here, then I don't think\n12 Sesame Place would ever take the time to implement,\n13 because in order for them to know about the problem,\n14 someone has to be made aware.  That's why I'm glad\n15 we're in this predicament.  We're able to discuss\n16 the concerns we have as parents, you know, for the\n17 thing that our children, you know, seen.\n18                My daughter, kind of, caught on to it\n19 first.  \"How come?  That's not fair.\"  Kids are\n20 going to say that.  \"That's not fair.  Why did she\n21 get a hug?  Why did he get a hug?\"  What am I\n22 supposed to tell my child that a child -- the\n23 character sees her, walks past her, and then goes\n24 and hug another child that does the same, exact body\nJA354\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 355 of 1384\nPage 88\n1 movement to get acknowledged.\n2                In this case, it's very unfortunate\n3 because then it puts me in a predicament because it\n4 takes the innocence of my daughter away.  For me to\n5 come to a park, and all of these children of these\n6 color, to come into a part where it's supposed to be\n7 a place of innocence, of pure innocence, it's\n8 basically taking it from them and bringing them\n9 trauma because your favorite because of your\n10 favorite character is ignoring you for our skin\n11 color.  That, kind of, just, not my daughter.  You\n12 know, she feels like, \"I'm not going to be liked in\n13 the real world because of my skin color?\"  She asked\n14 me that.  What am I supposed to say as a parent?\n15      Q.   So I'm trying to do my best to understand\n16 what your lawsuit is about.\n17      A.   Mhm.\n18      Q.   Is it your testimony that being impatient\n19 with a child is against the law?\n20           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n21           THE WITNESS:  As I said before, the whole\n22      thing is more of discrimination, but like I had\n23      said, discrimination is the main key here.\n24 BY MS. BAZAN:\nJA355\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 356 of 1384\nPage 89\n1      Q.   Okay.\n2      A.   Discrimination, but as you can see, along\n3 with discrimination, the lack of patience.  Because\n4 if you, like you said before, it could be maybe\n5 timing, they're on time schedule.  If you're on the\n6 time schedule and you are aware you're going to see\n7 kids, they're excited going, you know, up there,\n8 excited, they're seeing their favorite characters.\n9 You have to think of your head quickly, especially\n10 when you're in the force with the kids, \"If I give\n11 one person a hug, I have to be prepared to do the\n12 same for others.\"  And then when you're frustrated\n13 and when my child asks for a hug or the next kid,\n14 because you already decided to pick and choose\n15 who -- you know, who to interact with.  That's like\n16 a teacher being in a classroom and deciding to give\n17 out cookies and picking and choosing what to give\n18 cookies for it.  If you're going to give out\n19 cookies, I think the whole class should get one, not\n20 just a selective few.\n21      Q.   Otherwise it's against the law?\n22           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n23           THE WITNESS:  I didn't say it's against\n24      the law, but I do think it's inappropriate.  I\nJA356\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 357 of 1384\nPage 90\n1      don't think it's correct because I'm not sure\n2      if you're a mother yourself, but if you went to\n3      go buy your child, let's say, an iPhone today\n4      and your other child doesn't get anything at\n5      all, the other child is going to question, \"How\n6      come she gets an iPhone and I don't get\n7      anything?\"\n8 BY MS. BAZAN:\n9      Q.   That would be upsetting.\n10      A.   That's going to be upsetting.  That's only\n11 right.  We have to understand, when we're dealing\n12 with children, minors, who their brain processes\n13 different from us adults that have more knowledge,\n14 wisdom, and experience to things, they're innocent\n15 to all of this.  It puts them in a very confused\n16 state.\n17                My daughter felt neglected.  She felt\n18 discriminated against.  She's only seven years old.\n19 Do you think I wanted to teach my daughter about\n20 race, about racism?  I don't want to put her in that\n21 mindset.  It's very unfortunate that I had to teach\n22 her that, especially in a place where I thought\n23 would be a place of peace and fun for my child and\n24 for all of the other children that had to deal with\nJA357\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 358 of 1384\nPage 91\n1 this predicament.  When I realized it wasn't so far\n2 of a coincidence, when it was several characters,\n3 and seeing that it happened to several children with\n4 the same skin tone, you know, minorities, that\n5 brought a red flag to me.  And I think something,\n6 overall, needs to be implemented.  You know?  That's\n7 just my theory.\n8      Q.   So correct me if I'm wrong --\n9      A.   Okay.\n10      Q.   -- is what you're suing over, in your\n11 words, discrimination?\n12      A.   Absolutely.  Racial discrimination.\n13      Q.   Okay.  Who at Sesame Place discriminated\n14 against your child?\n15      A.   The characters that were denying to\n16 interact with my child, but honestly, went to\n17 interact with, you know, a white child.\n18      Q.   Which characters were those?\n19      A.   The vampire, definitely.  I think Zoe was\n20 the other one and Cookie Monster.  I think it was\n21 the vampire, I think it was.\n22      Q.   So is it your testimony that the vampire,\n23 Zoe, and the Cookie Monster all discriminated\n24 against E.C.?\nJA358\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 359 of 1384\nPage 92\n1      A.   That is correct.\n2      Q.   So what, if anything, did E.C. say to you\n3 during the parade about the vampire, Zoe, or Cookie\n4 Monster?\n5      A.   She said, \"Mom, that's not fair.  Mommy,\n6 they're ignoring me.\"  And then seeing directly --\n7 you know, she's like, \"Mommy, is it because of my\n8 color?\"  It put me in a predicament to try to\n9 protect my child's innocence.  She was there to have\n10 a good time.  Not there to feel discriminated\n11 against or to be feel like she's being treated less\n12 than because of her skin color.\n13                I, honestly, as a mother, the first\n14 thing I tried to was see -- to, kind of, not blind\n15 side the situation, but to be optimistic to believe\n16 that a place like that would be so biased or do such\n17 a thing.  Because Sesame Place, if you actually go\n18 back in time and history, of, you know, the shows\n19 and everything, they, kind of, represent unity.  You\n20 know?  So I never thought I would be in that\n21 predicament.  I said, \"Maybe it's a coincidence.\n22 Maybe it's a bad day.\"  The coincidence was\n23 happening too far, too much that day, back to back\n24 with so many characters.\nJA359\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 360 of 1384\nPage 93\n1      Q.   So E.C. asked you during the parade if she\n2 was being ignored because of her color?\n3      A.   Yes.  At first.\n4      Q.   What do you mean, \"at first\"?\n5      A.   At first she said, \"Mommy, how come they\n6 went to her and not to me?  Is it because...\"  I\n7 said, \"Baby, keep enjoying the parade.\"  I didn't\n8 want to put -- I did not -- me, as a parent, while\n9 I'm there, drove three hours to get here, for me to\n10 discuss that with my child in the middle of a\n11 parade, I tried to avoid it.  I said, \"I think it's\n12 probably a coincidence.\"  I ignored it.  Tried to\n13 let her enjoy.\n14                Then as time goes on, because as I\n15 said before, kids have access to a lot, media.  She\n16 was able to see the article of where children are\n17 being neglected.  She said, \"Mommy, that happened to\n18 me.\"  When we did go in the car, we did discuss that\n19 she didn't enjoy.  She did not enjoy the park.  She\n20 did not have fun.  She said she was surprised and\n21 shocked that she was being ignored.  And then I\n22 said, \"It's okay.\"  I said, \"We won't go back.\"\n23 Because a sacrifice as a mother to make to drive\n24 three hours for my daughter to come out disappointed\nJA360\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 361 of 1384\nPage 94\n1 and not happy, that right there just -- yeah.\n2      Q.   So when she -- when E.C. asked you why the\n3 characters were ignoring her, was that after the\n4 interaction with the vampire?\n5      A.   It was right away.  Because the thing is,\n6 she was being ignored.  And then -- you know, it's\n7 one thing if the vampire ignores her and then maybe\n8 his float is down there, and he hugs someone real\n9 quick and goes back on.  That's justifiable.  But\n10 she was ignored and then directly the person next to\n11 us received attention.  That right there, kind of,\n12 put that her into a state of confusion as to, \"We're\n13 doing the same thing.  How come I'm not getting any\n14 feedback just like the next person is?\"  So that's\n15 where they went wrong.\n16                They were very selective of who they\n17 decided to choose to interact with, and I think\n18 that's not right.  Everyone paid to get there.\n19 Everyone probably paid the same, whether there was\n20 an agreement or not.  If they want to choose not to\n21 interact with children, like said before, I think,\n22 just logically, they should say, \"You know what?  If\n23 I'm going to interact with one, I have to be\n24 prepared to interact with others that do, you know,\nJA361\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 362 of 1384\nPage 98\n1 send an e-mail or, you know, I tried to do the\n2 customer service, and of course, too late because it\n3 was almost -- it was time for closing, so that was\n4 that.\n5      Q.   And we talked about this a little bit\n6 before, but I just want to nail it down.\n7                So when you say you wanted to go to\n8 guest relations, but it was closing, did you just\n9 decide the park was closing so you didn't go, or you\n10 actually went to guest relations and the hut was\n11 closed?\n12      A.   Yeah.  They were closing everything.  It\n13 was already 6 o'clock, 5:55, 5:59, so it was\n14 closing.\n15      Q.   So you did walk over there?\n16      A.   Yeah.  Because I had to leave the park.\n17 So I was basically in that area.\n18      Q.   And did you ask to see a manager that day?\n19      A.   I did not, not at the moment.  Because at\n20 the end, that would have brought a larger problem\n21 for me, especially since I was not only someone\n22 that -- not only did I pay $116 for me and my\n23 children to go there, I paid gas, tolls, time, and\n24 effort to bring them there.  So at that very moment,\nJA362\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 363 of 1384\nPage 100\n1 sad that she was being neglected, my goal was to\n2 conceal that at the moment for her by allowing her\n3 to use the other amenities and stuff they had at the\n4 park before departure.  At departure, I was going to\n5 try to do it and speak to someone, but everything\n6 was closed.\n7      Q.   Did you complain to any governmental\n8 agency about the alleged race discrimination that\n9 you or E.C. experienced at Sesame Place?\n10      A.   No.\n11      Q.   Did you post anything on social media\n12 about yours or E.C.'s experience at Sesame Place?\n13      A.   I spoke out on -- I was very shocked about\n14 the one that went in an uproar on the Internet.  I\n15 was like, \"Wow.  This is\" -- but it wasn't on the\n16 Internet.  I think it was a blog that they had on\n17 Instagram.  That's all.  I was shocked.  It was a\n18 comment.  That's it.\n19      Q.   Did you post the video, the viral video?\n20      A.   No, I did not.  Actually, I just posted --\n21 I mean, I record it from memories, and that's how I\n22 landed those videos, because I was just posting,\n23 thinking that it would be something that I could\n24 catch as a memory for my children.

Let's go back to Exhibit 6,\n19 which is the complaint, starting at the bottom of\n20 page 12 on paragraph 77.  It's the last one on page\n21 12.\n22                So in paragraph 77, you allege that,\n23 \"Sesame Street characters, Zoe and Cookie Monster\n24 intentionally refused to perform Seaworld's contract\nJA364\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 365 of 1384\nPage 105\n1 with the Romeros and the class by interalia refusing\n2 to engage with them.\"\n3                And then in paragraph 78 on the next\n4 page, it says, \"The Romeros took videos documenting\n5 some of these discriminatory interactions.\"\n6                Do you see that?\n7      A.   Correct.  Yes, I do.\n8      Q.   Do you see paragraph 78 then has two\n9 footnotes to 8 and 9?\n10      A.   Yes.\n11      Q.   And that the 8 -- footnotes 8 and 9 are\n12 links to two YouTube videos.\n13                Do you see that?\n14      A.   Yes.\n15      Q.   Were there any other discriminatory\n16 actions that you or E.C. experienced at Sesame Place\n17 that are not part of these two videos that are\n18 linked in the complaint?\n19      A.   No.  I provided every information and all\n20 evidence that was needed for this case.\n21      Q.   That wasn't quite my question.\n22      A.   Okay.\n23      Q.

That is correct.\n3      Q.   Thank you.\n4                I'm going to show you that first\n5 video linked in the complaint, footnote 8.  And\n6 we're going to put that on a thumb drive that we'll\n7 provide to your counsel and the court reporter.  And\n8 we will mark that thumb drive as Exhibit 8.\n9      A.

Do you know what kind of iPhone it is?\n4 What number?\n5      A.   I think at -- I'm not sure if I changed my\n6 iPhone at the time.  It might have -- at the time,\n7 might have been by iPhone XR.  I have to look\n8 because I changed my phone.  I'm not sure.  I think\n9 it was sometime in June or July.  It's either the\n10 iPhone XR, if it's not my new phone.  If it's the\n11 new phone, it's iPhone 13.  I have to make sure.  I\n12 just have to look at the dates.\n13      Q.   And when you -- so you switched your phone\n14 between that was taken and today, you think?\n15      A.   Yes.  It could be possibly one of --\n16 either my old phone or my current phone.\n17      Q.   Okay.  Did you transfer your photos and\n18 your videos from the old phone to the new phone?\n19      A.   ICloud, correct.\n20      Q.   So you still have it?\n21      A.   Yes.\n22      Q.

That's one, yes.\n2      Q.   Is there another incident with Cookie\n3 Monster you're suing about?\n4      A.   There's more videos with other characters,\n5 not with Cookie Monster.\n6      Q.   Okay.  Was that your voice we heard say,\n7 \"E , go get a hug\"?\n8      A.   Yes.\n9      Q.   So you were encouraging E.C. to engage\n10 with the characters?\n11      A.   Yes.  Well, not engaging.  As you could\n12 see, she already had her hand out on her own will.\n13 But as I seen that other children were going out of\n14 their way to get a hug, I said, 'Maybe if you do the\n15 same thing, you would get the interaction.\"  It\n16 didn't work in her favor either way.\n17      Q.   Was --\n18      A.   As you see, she respected the boundaries\n19 because she tried not to cross over the yellow line.\n20      Q.   Because what is -- what is the purpose of\n21 the yellow line?\n22      A.   The purpose is basically for the children\n23 not to go and interfere with the parade and the\n24 performances.  It could be for many things.  I mean,\nJA368\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 369 of 1384\nPage 109\n1 to avoid any injuries or anything that could, you\n2 know, bring trouble or any delay to the parade that\n3 was currently happening at the moment.\n4      Q.   So it's at least partially for safety,\n5 right?\n6      A.   Mostly safety purposes, mhm.\n7      Q.   Was it difficult to get to costume\n8 characters' attention?\n9      A.   As you can see --\n10           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n11           You can answer.\n12           THE WITNESS:  As you can see, yes.\n13 BY MS. BAZAN:\n14      Q.   There was loud music going with the\n15 parade, right?\n16      A.   Correct.\n17      Q.   And the characters are also performing\n18 dances and other movements, right?\n19      A.   Just -- yes.  And walking around.  Most of\n20 the time, I think it was the actual people that were\n21 doing the dancing.  They were moving around,\n22 however.  They did dances here and there, but they\n23 didn't have a dance routine like the others did.\n24      Q.   Did you put that video on YouTube?\nJA369\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 370 of 1384\nPage 115\n1      answered.\n2           You could answer it again.\n3           THE WITNESS:  Basically she was\n4      discriminated against.  In the video, as it was\n5      demonstrated, the children, she did reach out\n6      to try to get some type of attention from\n7      Cookie Monster, and he surpassed her and went\n8      directly to a white child to give them a hug,\n9      when E  was doing the same thing, you know,\n10      arms out for a hug as well.\n11 BY MS. BAZAN:\n12      Q.   So the first part of your answer in part E\n13 said, \"The costume characters were only interacting\n14 with white people.\"\n15                Does that apply to Cookie Monster?\n16      A.   Not just Cookie Monster because it's,\n17 obviously, the costume characters that E  was\n18 trying to interact with.  Not just Cookie Monster,\n19 the other ones as well, Zoe and the plenty of\n20 others.\n21      Q.   Okay.  So it does apply to Cookie Monster,\n22 but not just Cookie Monster?\n23      A.   Yes.  Zoe as well because Zoe, you know,\n24 neglected, or, I would say, ignored my child.\nJA370\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 371 of 1384\nPage 116\n1      Q.   Okay.  So Cookie Monster was only\n2 interacting within white people?\n3                (A brief interruption.)\n4           THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry.  Can you say that\n5      one more time?\n6 BY MS. BAZAN:\n7      Q.   Yes.  Of course.\n8                So is it your testimony that Cookie\n9 Monster was only interacting with white people?\n10      A.   Yes.\n11      Q.   Is it your testimony that Zoe was only\n12 interacting with white people?\n13      A.   Yes.  Or discriminating, yes.  In the\n14 sense, of course, ignoring my child because she's a\n15 minority, person of color, to then going to interact\n16 with, you know, a person that is not, not a person\n17 of color, if that makes sense.\n18      Q.   Okay.  Were any other costume characters\n19 interacting with white people that are not in your\n20 sworn interrogatory answer?\n21      A.   Right now, I do recall the vampire walking\n22 past her and going to other children.  The main key\n23 factors was Zoe and Cookie Monster, because that was\n24 one of the favorites that, you know, she was\nJA371\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 372 of 1384\nPage 117\n1 anticipating to see.\n2      Q.   Okay.  Is the vampire part of what you are\n3 suing over or not?  It's not in the interrogatory\n4 response.  I'm trying to get an idea.\n5      A.   Zoe and Cookie Monster.\n6      Q.   Okay.  Just Zoe and Cookie Monster?\n7      A.   Correct.\n8      Q.   All right.  So are you saying that during\n9 the 3:00 p.m. parade at Sesame Place, Cookie Monster\n10 did not interact with a single black person?\n11           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n12           THE WITNESS:  What I can say is, based on\n13      the area I was in, because, obviously, the\n14      parade is probably yards, or maybe even miles,\n15      so I wasn't able to see the entire dynamic of\n16      the parade, and be able to really, kind of,\n17      point out who he was interacting with or not,\n18      but based on the area that I was in and from\n19      what I could see, he was only very selective of\n20      who he was choosing.\n21 BY MS. BAZAN:\n22      Q.   All right.  So you can't say for sure that\n23 he didn't interact with any people of color on the\n24 whole parade route, right?\nJA372\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 373 of 1384\nPage 125\n1 BY MS. BAZAN:\n2      Q.   Can you tell?\n3      A.   It could be possible, because everyone has\n4 different features, but either way, I met with\n5 Hispanics that are just as racist, so it could all\n6 differ.  Even, you know, the country that -- you\n7 know, the country that I'm from, they'll favor a\n8 person that -- we're from the same country, but\n9 they'll favor you more than they would favor a\n10 person like me, based on my color, my hair texture,\n11 and then, you know, just what I look like.  So that\n12 happens in -- all over the world, in Latin\n13 countries.  That's that proven fact.  Whether you\n14 are Spanish or not -- Hispanic, I should say, that\n15 wouldn't take away, whether, I'm not saying you are,\n16 possibly, you know, discriminated against me or not,\n17 so.\n18      Q.   Do you think that all Hispanic people are\n19 minorities, regardless of their skin tone?\n20           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n21           THE WITNESS:  It's a bigger issue here in\n22      our country where, as far as, I guess, the\n23      physical form, if they don't know you're Latin,\n24      or you could pass on the white side, it's\nJA373\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 374 of 1384\nPage 130\n1           And I want to ask.  Because it seems like\n2      you are very sure that this person could\n3      possibly be Latin.  Is that because of the hair\n4      style she has?  Or is that just -- because if I\n5      couldn't dissect what she was, how can we use\n6      her and point her out as a factor that she\n7      could possibly be a child of Latin decent?\n8 BY MS. BAZAN:\n9      Q.   Does E.C. identify as white?\n10      A.   No.  I can't -- are you able to --\n11           MR. RICHARDSON:  You can't ask the\n12      questions.\n13           THE WITNESS:  She is not.  She is Hispanic\n14      and African-American.\n15 BY MS. BAZAN:\n16      Q.   And, in fact, Cookie Monster did interact\n17 with E.C. during the parade, right?\n18           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n19           THE WITNESS:  A quick tap in the air.  If\n20      you could go back, you can see, compared to\n21      what the other children were receiving, one on\n22      one, and a hug as well.\n23 BY MS. BAZAN:\n24      Q.   Okay.  I'm going to show you what's marked\nJA374\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 375 of 1384\nPage 131\n1 as Exhibit 10.\n2                (Exhibit Romero-10 marked for\n3 identification.)\n4 BY MS. BAZAN:\n5      Q.   Do you recognize that hand and --\n6      A.   Mhm.\n7      Q.   That's your daughter?\n8      A.   Mhm.\n9      Q.   And is that what you're talking about, the\n10 hand tap that Cookie Monster gave her?\n11      A.   Yes.\n12      Q.   Okay.  And that's not Cookie Monster\n13 interacting with E.C.?\n14      A.   Do you want to compare the two from that\n15 and what the other children received, along with a\n16 hug?  Because she reached out for a hug and she\n17 received a tap.  While the other child, the children\n18 or the child that reached out for a hug received a\n19 full-, you know, blown hug.\n20      Q.   So Cookie Monster giving her hand a tap,\n21 is Cookie Monster ignoring her?\n22      A.   Technically -- I'm not going to say it's\n23 ignoring, but it's technically disregarding what\n24 she's asking for, but favoring the next child who\nJA375\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 376 of 1384\nPage 132\n1 asked for the same thing.\n2      Q.   So it's not that Cookie Monster was only\n3 interacting with white people.\n4                It's that he didn't interact with\n5 E.C. the way she wanted him to?\n6      A.   As you could see, there's a big\n7 difference.  He reached for a second and ran off and\n8 gave a child a hug to a child, if you go to that\n9 point, a white child.  They both asked and did the\n10 same thing, the same gesture to receive a hug.  E\n11 did not receive a hug, but the other child did.\n12      Q.   And you mentioned here and also in your\n13 interrogatory response said that, \"E.C. was passed\n14 over by Cookie Monster, even though she was begging\n15 for a hug.\"\n16                Do you remember that?\n17      A.   Correct.  Mhm.\n18      Q.   Okay.  But isn't the sequence of events in\n19 the video, first you say, \"E , go get a hug,\"\n20 second Cookie Monster taps her hand, and then third,\n21 only after that hand tap and Cookie Monster walks\n22 away does E.C. say, \"Hug\"?  Isn't that the sequence\n23 of events?\n24           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\nJA376\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 377 of 1384\nPage 136\n1           (Whereupon, video recording was played.)\n2           THE WITNESS:  But did you not see in that\n3      moment -- maybe I'm --\n4           MR. RICHARDSON:  Wait for a question.\n5           THE WITNESS:  Okay.  I'll wait.\n6 BY MS. BAZAN:\n7      Q.   So my question is, she only reaches out\n8 over the line and says, \"Hug\" after Cookie Monster\n9 has already moved on, right?\n10           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n11           THE WITNESS:  The hug was -- I think when\n12      he reached the children next to us is when I\n13      said, \"Go get the hug.\"  She got a tap and then\n14      he walked away.  That's what I said.\n15 BY MS. BAZAN:\n16      Q.   And then she yelled, \"Hug,\" after he\n17 walked away?\n18      A.   Maybe I'm not seeing the right video.  I\n19 see it in the video that Cookie Monster approached\n20 the children that were there.  I said, \"Go get a\n21 hug.\"  He taps her and walks away.  Yeah.\n22      Q.   Okay.  And then in the interrogatory\n23 response, you claim that Cookie Monster hugged a\n24 white child several families down, right?\nJA377\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 378 of 1384\nPage 137\n1      A.   That is correct.\n2      Q.   Okay.  So I'm going to show you what we'll\n3 mark as Exhibit 11.\n4                (Exhibit Romero-11 marked for\n5 identification.)\n6 BY MS. BAZAN:\n7      Q.   Is the child in this photograph the child\n8 you're talking about, the white child, several\n9 families down --\n10      A.   That is correct.\n11      Q.   -- that got the hug.\n12                Okay.  How do you know this child is\n13 white?\n14      A.   The color of his skin, possibly.\n15      Q.   How do you know he or she is not Hispanic?\n16      A.   It's a high possibility, but like I said\n17 before, discrimination also comes in many forms.\n18 And in this form, I am a strong believer it's based\n19 on skin tone, hair color, and appearance, so.\n20      Q.   How do you know this child is not Asian?\n21      A.   I -- I am -- I seen the child.  The child\n22 was definitely a white child.\n23      Q.   Because of the color of his skin?\n24           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\nJA378\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 379 of 1384\nPage 138\n1           THE WITNESS:  I was there so I, kind of,\n2      remember that significant child because that\n3      was the child that was able to receive the hug,\n4      so.\n5 BY MS. BAZAN:\n6      Q.   Do you know that child?\n7      A.   No, I don't know anyone there.\n8      Q.   Did you ask the child or its family how\n9 they identify racially?\n10      A.   No.  That's not nothing I would ask at a\n11 theme park.\n12      Q.   So just based on how this child looks,\n13 you're assuming that it's white?\n14      A.   If it's not white, they're still\n15 discriminating my child because, obviously, the\n16 person that was of light color and, you know, my\n17 daughter, who is somebody of darker skin tone, was\n18 discriminated against.\n19      Q.   Okay.  So it's your testimony that even if\n20 this child is Hispanic and E.C. is Hispanic, this\n21 interaction is still race discrimination?\n22      A.   It is.  Mhm.\n23      Q.   Okay.  Did Cookie Monster say anything\n24 derogatory to E.C.?\nJA379\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 380 of 1384\nPage 139\n1      A.   No.\n2      Q.   Did Cookie Monster say anything to E.C.\n3 about race?\n4      A.   No.  Of course not.\n5      Q.   So you believe that the interaction that\n6 we've been looking at was race discrimination\n7 because Cookie Monster interacted with E.C. with the\n8 hand tap and then moved down the line and hugged a\n9 different child?\n10      A.   That, and also, if you take the time to\n11 look at the video again, you would just see how he\n12 was able -- you know, had more delicacy and focus on\n13 the children next to me and kind of reached a little\n14 bit for E without -- I feel like the one-on-one\n15 interaction with the kids next to us had, along with\n16 the...\n17      Q.   So touching her hand wasn't enough of an\n18 interaction?\n19      A.   Not saying it wasn't enough, but it was\n20 more of a -- it was to get her out the way, but the\n21 other children were able to get the one on -- seeing\n22 Cookie Monster in front of them.  If you could see,\n23 he, kind of, reached out quickly and proceeded to\n24 other children.\nJA380\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 381 of 1384\nPage 152\n1 marked as Exhibit 8 --\n2      A.

So it's on page 13,\n7 footnote 9.\n8           MS. BAZAN:  And I believe, Mr. Richardson,\n9      this was produced to us as video 2, if that's a\n10      helpful cross reference.\n11           MR. RICHARDSON:  Okay.\n12           MS. BAZAN:  That's what the file was\n13      called, but this is the one from YouTube.\n14           (Whereupon, video recording was played.)\n15 BY MS. BAZAN:\n16      Q.   Did you record that video?\n17      A.   Yes, ma'am.\n18      Q.   On the same iPhone as you recorded Cookie\n19 Monster video?\n20      A.   Yes.\n21      Q.   And does that video show the incident\n22 regarding Zoe that you're suing about in this\n23 lawsuit?\n24      A.   Yes.\nJA381\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 382 of 1384\nPage 153\n1      Q.   And is E.C. the little girl in the bright\n2 pink top in the video?\n3      A.   Yes.  Correct.\n4      Q.   Did you put that video on YouTube?\n5      A.   No.\n6      Q.   Has that video been edited in any way\n7 since you took it?\n8      A.   Uh-uh.\n9           MR. RICHARDSON:  You have to say, \"yes\" or\n10      \"no.\"\n11           THE WITNESS:  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yes.  I\n12      mean, no.  I'm sorry.\n13 BY MS. BAZAN:\n14      Q.   So why did you choose to stop it right\n15 there when it sounded like E.C. was in the middle of\n16 saying something?\n17      A.   Because in reality, my intentions wasn't\n18 really to record to show proof of what was going on\n19 because I wasn't trying to think that at the moment.\n20 I was, kind of, trying to record the moment and\n21 capture the moment, but if my daughter is\n22 complaining, I was like, \"What's the purpose of\n23 recording, especially while other children are\n24 being -- they're interacting with the character my\nJA382\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 383 of 1384\nPage 155\n1 that sentence applies to both Cookie Monster and\n2 Zoe, right?\n3      A.   Mhm.\n4      Q.   So Zoe was only interacting with white\n5 people?\n6      A.   Mhm.\n7      Q.   And then it says, \"Plaintiff, E.C., was\n8 ignored and passed over by Zoe, even though she was\n9 begging for a hug.  Zoe passed E.C. by and\n10 interacted with the white family next to E.C.;\" is\n11 that right?\n12      A.   That is correct.\n13      Q.   Okay.\n14      A.   Basically the same people that were next,\n15 you know, when I recorded with Cookie Monster, the\n16 same family.\n17      Q.   The little girl with the braid's family or\n18 on the other side?\n19      A.   Everyone that was in that area.  As you\n20 can see, it was directly next to me and E .\n21      Q.   On your right side and your left side?\n22      A.   My right side.\n23      Q.   Your right side?\n24      A.   So it was going this way.  Mhm.\nJA383\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 384 of 1384\nPage 159\n1 If it's not, it could also be her as well.  The same\n2 kids were all on the right side of me.  This was all\n3 in a minute span, several-minute span.\n4      Q.   Uh-huh.  And, again, you're assuming that\n5 this family next to you is white because of how they\n6 looked?\n7      A.   The skin tone.  Discrimination is because\n8 of the color, of course.\n9      Q.   Okay.  And so how was Zoe interacting with\n10 that family?\n11      A.   Reaching out, one on one --\n12      Q.   Hand touch?\n13      A.   Yes.  As well.  And E got the thumbs\n14 up.\n15      Q.   Thumbs up.\n16                Oh, E  got the thumbs up?\n17      A.   No.  She went like this and walked past\n18 her.  You can start the video -- is it possible to\n19 start that over one more time.\n20      Q.   Sure.\n21      A.   As you see, she approaches one on one with\n22 the kids, does the dance.  Gave the thumbs up for\n23 E  as she's reaching out and goes to the other\n24 children.  I think that's evident, you know, being\nJA384\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 385 of 1384\nPage 160\n1 ignored.\n2      Q.   So you think Zoe giving E.C. a thumbs up\n3 is evidence of E.C. being ignored?\n4      A.   I know it is.  Yeah.\n5      Q.   Okay.\n6      A.   Mhm.\n7      Q.   And I think you've said before, the parade\n8 route is long, so you didn't see every person Zoe\n9 interacted with on the entire parade route, correct?\n10      A.   Correct.\n11      Q.   So you can't say for sure Zoe was only\n12 interacting with white people, right?\n13           MS. BAZAN:  Objection.\n14           THE WITNESS:  From what I noticed, what I\n15      seen and witnessed, that's all it was.\n16      Obviously, seeing that a bunch of other people\n17      have a similar story to similar incidents, it's\n18      evident it's probably going to be an ongoing\n19      issue.\n20 BY MS. BAZAN:\n21      Q.   And in that video we just watched 5 few\n22 time, E.C. turns to you and says, \"I want to give\n23 her a hug\" twice, right?  She's looking at you?\n24      A.   Yes.\nJA385\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 386 of 1384\nPage 161\n1      Q.   And then do you remember what you said to\n2 her in response?\n3      A.   I said, \"Go give her a hug.\"\n4      Q.   And so after you gave E.C. that\n5 instruction, then what did E.C. do?\n6      A.   She -- obviously, Zoe continued to go her\n7 way, so it was too far, too gone.  E  was trying\n8 to follow protocols.  As you noticed, she didn't\n9 want to go past the yellow line.\n10      Q.   So by then, Zoe had moved past?\n11      A.   Yes.\n12      Q.   Do you think Zoe even heard E.C. at that\n13 point?\n14      A.   I think so.  But either or.  When she was\n15 approaching, she seen that E  was reaching out.\n16 She didn't even reach out a hand, but she gave her a\n17 thumbs up and went towards the other children.\n18      Q.   Did Zoe say anything derogatory to E.C.?\n19      A.   No, not at all.\n20      Q.   Did Zoe say anything to E.C. about race?\n21      A.   Not at all.\n22      Q.   After you took this video, did you post it\n23 to any social media platforms?\n24      A.   No, not at all.\nJA386\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 387 of 1384\nPage 171\n1 self respect, or other post-traumatic stress or\n2 other mental illness or injury as a result of the\n3 incidents described in the amended class action\n4 complaint, describe in detail each that you have\n5 experienced and include\" and it asks for four\n6 things.\n7                Do you see that?\n8      A.   Yes.\n9      Q.   And your first sentence in your answer is,\n10 \"Plaintiffs experienced racial trauma as a result of\n11 defendants' discriminatory practices.\"\n12                What is racial trauma?\n13      A.   Racial trauma is basically you go to an\n14 establishment or, you know, try to enjoy your\n15 regular, daily life, just like others, and seeing\n16 that you're getting discriminated against or could\n17 be targeted or being disserviced just based on the\n18 color of your skin or just based on how you look.\n19      Q.   And -- sorry.\n20      A.   And also -- you could go ahead, and I\n21 could answer it after.\n22      Q.   Have you personally suffered from racial\n23 trauma as a result of your Sesame Place trip?\n24      A.   Yeah.\nJA387\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 388 of 1384\nPage 172\n1      Q.   What are your symptoms of racial trauma?\n2      A.   I am on edge when it comes to taking my\n3 children to these establishments.  It's humiliating\n4 as well.  It's, kind of, degrading as well because\n5 everyone paid for the same services for the same\n6 things, even though some got more privilege than\n7 others.  And also just me, as a mother, had do put\n8 me in a predicament to have to put myself in that\n9 perspective of things of having to speak to my\n10 daughter, take the innocence away from her to know\n11 the characters she does like were dressed under a\n12 costume and were discriminating against her, myself,\n13 and people like us.\n14      Q.   Have you had any physical symptoms?\n15           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n16           THE WITNESS:  No.  Besides anxiety, no.\n17 BY MS. BAZAN:\n18      Q.   Besides what?\n19      A.   Besides anxiety.  But I was anxious at\n20 that moment because I was experiencing what was\n21 happening.\n22      Q.   Are you still experiencing anxiety?\n23      A.   No.\n24      Q.   Are you able to go to work?\nJA388\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 389 of 1384\nPage 174\n1 get out because they did not want the N-words there.\n2 And then one of my friends that was white told me to\n3 leave with the group of people my color to avoid any\n4 issues.  That was one of the incidents.  That was\n5 back in 2013.\n6      Q.   So that -- did that incident have a\n7 similar impact on your life to this experience at\n8 Sesame Place?\n9      A.   It's different correlations, of course,\n10 because it's -- that one was more personal.  This\n11 was more of -- with Sesame Place, it's more of a\n12 professional establishment, so it, kind of, has\n13 different sentimental values.  But in this case, it\n14 was more sentimental because my daughter was\n15 involved in this.\n16      Q.   But do you equate what happened at Sesame\n17 Place with the use of the N-word and the displaying\n18 of confederate flag?\n19           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n20           THE WITNESS:  It's discrimination, yes.  I\n21      was discriminated against, so.\n22 BY MS. BAZAN:\n23      Q.   You think it's equally severe?\n24      A.   Yes.  Any discrimination is severe, in a\nJA389\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 390 of 1384\nPage 175\n1 way.\n2      Q.   Do you contend you've suffered any of the\n3 other conditions that are listed in interrogatory 5?\n4      A.   Can you elaborate?  I'm sorry.\n5      Q.   No.  That's quite all right.\n6                In interrogatory 5, it asks if you've\n7 suffered humiliation, embarrassment, mental anguish\n8 --\n9      A.   Oh, yes.\n10      Q.   -- psychological stress, all of those in\n11 that list.\n12                My question is:  Have you suffered\n13 any of those other conditions as a result of your\n14 Sesame Place experience?\n15      A.   Yes.  I was very, very humiliated,\n16 embarrassed.  I felt I was not equal to everyone\n17 else.  Because some people have -- they were treated\n18 a different way than I was.  I was also very\n19 humiliated because, of course, my kids are being\n20 ignored, and they're watching us being ignored.\n21 It's very, very embarrassing and disappointing.\n22      Q.   Do you have a diagnosis for any of these?\n23      A.   No.\n24      Q.   Do you have any symptoms of any of these?\nJA390\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 391 of 1384\nPage 176\n1           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n2 BY MS.

Are there any parts of your daily life you\n8 can't do because of the humiliation and\n9 embarrassment?\n10      A.   No.\n11      Q.   Has E.C. suffered any economic damages as\n12 a result of her Sesame Place visit?\n13      A.   She hasn't, but everything I lost is a\n14 loss for her as well.\n15      Q.   Has E.C. suffered racial trauma?\n16      A.   Oh, yes.  Absolutely.\n17      Q.   Have you sought any treatment for her?\n18      A.   I have not, but I do feel like in time she\n19 would need it.\n20      Q.   So she doesn't have an official diagnosis\n21 from any professional, correct?\n22      A.   Correct.\n23      Q.   What are her symptoms?\n24      A.   She assumes that -- that, unfortunately,\nJA391\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 392 of 1384\nPage 177\n1 she does assume that people are going to be racist\n2 against her, that people won't like her because of\n3 the color of her skin.  It, kind of, you know --\n4 yeah.  Basically.\n5      Q.   And how did she express that to you that\n6 she's assuming people will racist against her?\n7      A.   She's very vocal.  She said she was hurt,\n8 frustrated.  She said she was disappointed, she said\n9 it made her really sad.  You know, that's pretty\n10 much --\n11      Q.   She said she was hurt, frustrated,\n12 disappointed, and sad?\n13      A.   Sad, very sad.\n14      Q.   Okay.  Anything else?\n15      A.   She felt like it wasn't fair because she's\n16 a little girl.\n17      Q.   Has E.C. continued to attend school?\n18      A.   Yes.\n19      Q.   Does she like school?\n20      A.   Yes.\n21      Q.   Does she do well in school?\n22      A.   Yes.\n23      Q.

Other than for something like a will and\n9 for this case, other than those two things, have you\n10 ever had any reason to obtain an attorney in the\n11 past?\n12      A.   Can you elaborate?  In what sense?\n13      Q.   Have you ever had to hire a lawyer before,\n14 not including this case?\n15      A.   No.\n16      Q.   Did someone hire a lawyer on your behalf?\n17      A.   As a child, yes.  Mhm.\n18      Q.   And in that case that you were involved in\n19 as a child, did you ever have to testify under oath\n20 before a judge?\n21      A.   I can't say because I was so young.  I\n22 was -- this was probably 2006, 2007.  So I, kind of,\n23 don't remember.\n24      Q.   Okay.

A ticket, a season\n20 pass?  How did you go?\n21      A.   A season pass.\n22      Q.   And when did you buy that season pass?\n23      A.   So I -- I'm not sure exactly when I bought\n24 it, but it was on a payment plan on my credit card.\nJA407\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 408 of 1384\nPage 36\n1      Q.   When you did that, did you purchase it in\n2 person, over the Internet?  How did that work?\n3      A.   On the website.\n4                (Exhibit Valdez-3 marked for\n5 identification.)\n6 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n7      Q.   Let me show you what we've marked for the\n8 record as Valdez number 3, which is a document that\n9 was produced in this case on your behalf, and is\n10 Bates labeled Valdez 0014 through Valdez 0019.\n11                Do you recognize this document,\n12 Ms. Valdez?\n13      A.   Yes, I do.\n14      Q.   Is it true that this is the credit card\n15 statement of the card that you used to purchase the\n16 season pass?\n17      A.   Yes, it is.\n18      Q.   Now, this document that was produced goes\n19 to -- if you look through it, it appears to be\n20 March 2021 through August of 2021; is that correct,\n21 in terms of the charges?\n22      A.   Yes, that's correct.\n23      Q.   And when you purchased this season pass,\n24 what was the -- what were the terms of the plan in\nJA408\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 409 of 1384\nPage 37\n1 terms of how many payments you had to make?  Do you\n2 recall?\n3      A.   No.  I don't recall.  What I do know is\n4 that I would get charged on a monthly basis until\n5 the season pass was paid off.\n6      Q.   Do you know whether that period of time in\n7 which these charges were made was a year, 12 months,\n8 something other than that?\n9      A.   No.  I don't think it was a year.  I think\n10 it was less than a year.\n11      Q.   Do you know if there were charges made on\n12 your season pass after August of 2021?\n13      A.   No, no.  I provided all of the charges.\n14      Q.   What's the status of your season pass\n15 today?\n16      A.   It's been terminated.\n17      Q.   When did that happen?\n18      A.   I can't recall exactly when.\n19      Q.   Was it terminated, or did you just not\n20 renew it?\n21      A.   I stopped paying.\n22      Q.   So the fact that it ended was due to your\n23 stopping payment; is that correct?\n24      A.   Yes.  Mhm.\nJA409\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 410 of 1384\nPage 38\n1      Q.   At the time that you purchased the season\n2 pass with this credit card, that's evidenced by\n3 Exhibit 3, with the account ending in 6040, at that\n4 point in time, did anyone else have access to this\n5 credit card?\n6      A.   No.\n7      Q.   Did anyone else use it at the time that\n8 you bought this season pass?\n9      A.   No.\n10      Q.   When you were on the website buying the\n11 season pass, did the website require you to agree to\n12 anything?\n13      A.   Not that I recall.\n14      Q.   Was there any situation that you\n15 remember -- at the time when you were on the website\n16 that you had to check a box that said, \"I agree,\" in\n17 order to advance to the next page?\n18      A.   I don't recall; I don't recall.\n19      Q.   Did you have a chance to review everything\n20 that was on the website at the time that you bought\n21 the ticket?\n22      A.   No, no.  I just purchased the ticket.\n23      Q.   Do you recall reviewing any document or\n24 any terms and conditions for your purchase?\nJA410\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 411 of 1384\nPage 39\n1      A.   No.\n2      Q.   Did you print anything out off the website\n3 when you bought the season pass?\n4      A.   I printed out, I think it was the first\n5 page, where there was, like, a scan -- a bar that\n6 you scan at the park.  It's, like, proof that you\n7 bought it.  I brought that with me to my first\n8 visit.\n9      Q.   Other than that, do you remember printing\n10 anything else out?\n11      A.   No.\n12                (Exhibit Valdez-4 marked for\n13 identification.)\n14           MR. SIMPSON:  I think I put the wrong\n15      sticker on that.  Let me see.\n16           MR.

It looks like it.  Yeah.  It looks like\n5 what I brought to the park.  Looks like it.\n6      Q.   So I take it you no longer have a copy of\n7 this document.\n8      A.   No, sir.\n9           MR.

Go ahead\n17      and answer the question.\n18           THE WITNESS:  Okay.  No.\n19 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n20      Q.   Do you know at what point you ceased to\n21 have a copy of this document?\n22           MR. O'CONNELL:  Objection.\n23           THE WITNESS:  The day I went to the park\n24      on my first visit.\nJA412\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 413 of 1384\nPage 41\n1 BY MR.

SIMPSON:\n7      Q.   Yes.\n8      A.   Yes.\n9      Q.   How did you get into the park without a\n10 copy of this document?\n11           MR. O'CONNELL:  Objection.\n12           THE WITNESS:  Well, that's what I just\n13      answered on my last -- so I used this to get\n14      into the park.\n15 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n16      Q.   So after your last trip to the park, you\n17 did away with this document?\n18           MR. O'CONNELL:  Objection.\n19           THE WITNESS:  That's not what I said.\n20 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n21      Q.   Well, what did you say?\n22      A.   I said that on my first visit I used this\n23 as proof that I am a season pass holder.\n24      Q.   I see.\nJA413\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 414 of 1384\nPage 42\n1                After that first visit, did you\n2 return to the park?\n3      A.   After my first visit?\n4      Q.   Yes.\n5      A.   Yes.\n6      Q.   And how did you get in on those visits?\n7      A.   I used my -- the app, the application,\n8 Sesame Place application.\n9      Q.   And that app has something like this\n10 document on your app?\n11      A.   It has the bar code.  But the app doesn't\n12 work very well, so what I did was screenshot the bar\n13 code and put it in my notes on my phone so I had\n14 readily available to me.  So when I come in, I could\n15 just pull it up on the Notes app and they can scan\n16 it to make my life easier.\n17                (Exhibit Valdez-5 marked for\n18 identification.)\n19 BY MR.

In particular, I\n24 would like to address your attention to pages 4/7 to\nJA414\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 415 of 1384\nPage 43\n1 6/7.\n2      A.   Okay.\n3      Q.   Do you recognize that part of the\n4 document?\n5      A.   No.  I've never read the terms and\n6 conditions.\n7      Q.   Just to be clear, do you have a\n8 recollection of ever seeing pages 4/7 to 6/7?\n9      A.   No.\n10      Q.   Now, Mrs. Valdez, with respect to the\n11 first amended complaint, if you could go, that's\n12 Exhibit number 2.  If you could, look at page 13,\n13 paragraph 84.\n14      A.   Okay.\n15      Q.   It states, \"By the terms of the contract\n16 between the Valdez family and Seaworld.\"\n17                Do you see that?\n18      A.   Yes, sir.\n19      Q.   Do you have an understanding as to whether\n20 you had a contract of some kind with Seaworld?\n21      A.   Yes.  Absolutely.\n22      Q.   What were the terms of that contract, to\n23 your understanding?\n24      A.   To my understanding?\nJA415\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 416 of 1384\nPage 44\n1      Q.   Yes.\n2      A.   That I would purchase a season pass and\n3 have access to the park as many times as I wanted to\n4 during the season and having a magical experience\n5 with my children.\n6      Q.   In terms of interaction with Sesame Street\n7 characters, did you have an understanding of -- let\n8 me ask it this way.\n9                With respect to your interactions\n10 with the Sesame Place -- Sesame Street characters,\n11 did Seaworld promise you anything in that regard?\n12      A.   Promise me anything?\n13      Q.   Yes.\n14      A.   I would assume if I buy a season pass to\n15 one of the most amazing parks in the world and I\n16 take my children to this park that the promise is\n17 that my children will have an amazing experience,\n18 that they will be able to see their beloved\n19 characters interact with them at some point during\n20 the visit and everyone will go home really happy.\n21      Q.   Was it your understanding that you were\n22 entitled, as a customer of Sesame Place, for your\n23 children to have an interaction of some kind with\n24 every Sesame Street character?\nJA416\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 417 of 1384\nPage 45\n1      A.   Every?\n2      Q.   Yes.\n3      A.   I wouldn't say, \"every.\"  I would say that\n4 the characters that walk the park, in the parade,\n5 take pictures with the kids, yes.  I absolutely feel\n6 entitled to that because I paid for that experience.\n7      Q.   And would you say that it's your testimony\n8 that you understood that every child who enters the\n9 park was entitled to be hugged by every Sesame Place\n10 character?\n11           MR. O'CONNELL:  Objection.\n12           THE WITNESS:  Hugged?\n13           MR. O'CONNELL:  Objection.\n14           You can answer.\n15           THE WITNESS:  I can answer?\n16           MR. O'CONNELL:  Yes.\n17           THE WITNESS:  I wouldn't say hugged, but I\n18      would say some type of interaction, a high\n19      five, maybe a handshake, maybe a pat of the\n20      head, maybe a pat on the shoulder, some type of\n21      interaction with the child.  I don't expect\n22      every character that we run into in the park,\n23      because you're not going to see all of them in\n24      the park, but I would expect them to, in some\nJA417\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 418 of 1384\nPage 46\n1      way, acknowledge your child, if the child is\n2      there.\n3 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n4      Q.   Is it your understanding that your\n5 children would have an entitlement to be touched by\n6 every Sesame Street character in the park?\n7      A.   Every?\n8      Q.   Yes.\n9      A.   I wouldn't say, \"every.\"  Again, I will\n10 reiterate.  I believe with the characters we come\n11 across during our visit throughout the day, in which\n12 every part of the park we're in, yes, I would\n13 believe that every child is entitled to some type of\n14 acknowledgment by those characters.  Yes.\n15      Q.   Well, would it be consistent with your\n16 understanding of acknowledgment for the\n17 acknowledgment not to involve touching of the child?\n18           MR. O'CONNELL:  Objection to form.\n19           THE WITNESS:  No, no.  Because it doesn't\n20      take much for you to just simply touch the\n21      child.  You got big, furry hands.  Just the\n22      feel of a furry hand for a kid could mean the\n23      world to them.\n24 BY MR. SIMPSON:\nJA418\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 419 of 1384\nPage 47\n1      Q.   So is it your testimony that the character\n2 would not be properly acknowledging the child,\n3 unless the character touched the child?\n4      A.   Repeat that one more time.\n5      Q.   All right.  In terms of your understanding\n6 as to what you were entitled to as a customer, is it\n7 your testimony that a character would not be\n8 properly acknowledging the child, unless the\n9 character touched the child?\n10      A.   I would say so.  If the character is in\n11 close proximity, absolutely.  If the character is\n12 off, maybe I'm standing here and the character is by\n13 the gentleman over there, then no.  But logically,\n14 if they're this close, absolutely.\n15      Q.   Okay.  But in terms of the example you\n16 just gave with Mr. Smolij, who is 20 feet away, as\n17 the record doesn't show, but we're saying it, would\n18 that be -- acknowledgment from a distance be\n19 consistent with your understanding of the characters\n20 acknowledging the child?\n21           MR. O'CONNELL:  Objection to form.\n22           You can answer.\n23           THE WITNESS:  Well, again, I -- I want to\n24      carefully answer this.\nJA419\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 420 of 1384\nPage 48\n1           If a child is too far from a character to\n2      be interacted with, then logically, a wave, but\n3      if a child is so close to a character that they\n4      can actually reach out and touch the character,\n5      then my understanding that what I paid for, the\n6      experience I paid for, is for my child to be\n7      acknowledged by a touch, whatever that touch\n8      entails, a pat on the head, like I said before,\n9      on the hand, a hug.\n10 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n11      Q.   Now, the understanding that you've just\n12 described in your testimony about what you were\n13 entitled to get as a customer of Sesame Place, where\n14 did you get that understanding from?\n15      A.   From -- okay.  I would say I'm a\n16 reasonably intelligent woman.  Just from common -- I\n17 wouldn't say common sense because common sense is\n18 not so common these days, but logically, and also,\n19 because I've seen it.  I've seen it happen all of\n20 the time.  I've been to the park many, many times.\n21 And I've seen the characters interact with the kids.\n22 All of the little white kids, you know.  And\n23 unfortunately, my children have never.  Never.\n24 Which is really heartbreaking because they love\nJA420\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 421 of 1384\nPage 49\n1 these characters.\n2      Q.   Well, is it -- for example, were these\n3 interactions promised to you by the season pass\n4 which was marked as Exhibit number 4 to your\n5 deposition?\n6           MR. O'CONNELL:  Objection.\n7           You can answer.\n8           THE WITNESS:  Well, I would -- I would\n9      have to say that yes, because you're asking me\n10      to pay a ridiculous amount of money for a\n11      season pass.  It's just a season pass.  I'm\n12      coming all the way from New York.  So there's\n13      gas, there's tolls, there's energy.  There's --\n14      I mean, it's just -- there's a lot coming out\n15      of the way just to bring my children and most\n16      of the time, alone.  Because I'm -- like that\n17      day, I was there alone with my kids, expelling\n18      all of this energy to bring any children to\n19      this park so they could have this experience.\n20      Yes.\n21 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n22      Q.   All right.  My question is:  Is there\n23 anything in the season pass document itself that\n24 promised you these interactions with the characters?\nJA421\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 422 of 1384\nPage 50\n1           MR. O'CONNELL:  Objection.\n2           You can answer.\n3           THE WITNESS:  Well, first of all, I didn't\n4      read all of this, all of this information.  In\n5      my excitement, I purchased my tickets.  I\n6      expected, and I believe I'm entitled to this\n7      experience because that is what is -- that's\n8      the face of it.  My assumption would be that\n9      yes, this is what they're promising all of\n10      their customers.  That's the only way I can\n11      answer that question.\n12 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n13      Q.   I'm not arguing with you what your\n14 expectation was.  I'm just trying to find out the\n15 basis on which you formed it.\n16                How did you get this expectation?\n17 Did you get this expectation by reading something on\n18 the Seaworld or Sesame Place website?\n19      A.   The website promised an amazing experience\n20 for your children.  They promised -- I mean, I\n21 didn't read into all of these little details, but\n22 from what I understood and what I saw when I went to\n23 purchase the tickets is that Sesame Place was\n24 promising that my child would have an amazing\nJA422\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 423 of 1384\nPage 53\n1      We're back on the video record.\n2 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n3      Q.   Ms. Valdez, directing your attention to\n4 December 29th, 2021.\n5      A.   Mhm.\n6      Q.   Which is, I understand from your\n7 complaint, the date in question in this case, is\n8 that correct?\n9      A.   Yes.  Correct.\n10      Q.   In your own words, describe to me what\n11 took place that day at Sesame Place, Langhorne that\n12 you're suing about.\n13      A.   What took place that day that Sesame\n14 Place -- I didn't hear that part.\n15      Q.   What took place on that date that you are\n16 suing about?\n17      A.   Okay.  So as I said earlier, I've been\n18 visiting the park for quite a few years now, and the\n19 park has only ever been open during the summer.\n20                So now, it's open year round.  And we\n21 were so excited to do Christmas.  Christmas is our\n22 favorite time of year.  So I took the kids over to\n23 Sesame Place.  We got on the rides, had a good time,\n24 and then made it over to the parade on time.  There\nJA423\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 424 of 1384\nPage 54\n1 weren't a lot of people there.  It was a cold night.\n2 So I was excited.  I thinking, \"You know, it's cold.\n3 There aren't a lot of people here.  We're right up\n4 in the front.  There's not a lot of interference.\n5 And the characters aren't in a rush to get back in\n6 their float to get back inside because they're under\n7 the heat of the sun.\"  So I'm like, \"This is it.\n8 They're going to have their opportunity to interact\n9 with the characters.\"\n10                So we were up in the front -- rather,\n11 where they start the parade at.  And the characters,\n12 they -- there was no luck, in a sense.  The kids\n13 didn't have any luck.  Fine.  Abby Cadabby came out.\n14 She's the favorite.  She's M 's favorite.\n15 She's R 's favorite.  She's the favorite in the\n16 household.  So I'm like, \"Okay.  Get them in the\n17 wagon.\"  I get them in the wagon.  I start rushing\n18 over down.  I'm following her all the way to the end\n19 because I'm like, \"Okay.  She's going to stop at the\n20 end.  She's going to get off the float.  She's going\n21 to start dancing.\"  And my kids are right up in the\n22 front.  There's just no doubt in my mind that this\n23 time around they're going to get a hug or they're\n24 going to get some type of touch, some type of\nJA424\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 425 of 1384\nPage 55\n1 interaction in that way.\n2                So I see the little -- I see, you\n3 know -- she's dancing and whatnot.  This older girl,\n4 older white girl, gets a hug.  So M  starts,\n5 kind of, rushing his way over to where she's heading\n6 and there's a little boy in a stroller and another\n7 little boy standing next to him.  They're these two\n8 little white boys.  And she hugs the boy that was\n9 standing by the stroller.  Then the boy that was on\n10 the stroller and passed over M .\n11                So what I did immediately is to just\n12 make light of it because I didn't want -- M  is\n13 very, very sensitive.  So I know that he would have\n14 burst into tears if I would have made something of\n15 it.  So I immediately just made light of it.  \"Oh,\n16 it's okay.  For the next time,\" you know, just try\n17 to keep it the -- yeah.  Try to keep it light.\n18      Q.   Okay.  So as I understand it, is it your\n19 testimony that this incident of Abby, the character\n20 not hugging your child, is the reason you're suing\n21 Seaworld?\n22           MR. O'CONNELL:  Objection.\n23           You can answer.\n24           THE WITNESS:  It's the -- it's because\nJA425\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 426 of 1384\nPage 56\n1      M  literally was right next to the little\n2      boy in the stroller, taller than the little boy\n3      in the stroller -- in the stroller, with his\n4      arms extended out, and she just passed right by\n5      him.  And it just infuriated me because I had\n6      no doubt that he would have some type of\n7      magical experience.  That's the way I like to\n8      put it.  A magical experience for him because\n9      he absolutely adores her.  And she just kept\n10      going.  That's why I'm here.\n11 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n12      Q.   And is it your view that that failure by\n13 Abby to hug your child, but Abby hugging the white\n14 child is discrimination?\n15           MR. O'CONNELL:  Objection.\n16           You can answer.\n17           THE WITNESS:  Yes.  It absolutely is.\n18      Because -- there's -- all of the kids that got\n19      a hug were all little white kids.  So if there\n20      is no discrimination, then why didn't you hug\n21      my son?  He was right next to -- literally\n22      almost shoulder to shoulder and this close to\n23      the character.  There's just no excuse for it.\n24      There were hardly anyone there -- there was\nJA426\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 427 of 1384\nPage 57\n1      hardly anyone there.\n2 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n3      Q.   And you, I think, testified earlier you\n4 were infuriated by this?\n5      A.   Yes.  Yes, I was.\n6      Q.   Did you feel any other emotions, other\n7 than being infuriated?\n8      A.   I was heartbroken for them.  I was\n9 heartbroke -- the first emotion was heartbreak, if I\n10 were to get a little bit more technical.  I felt so\n11 bad for him because he's been wanting this bad.\n12 Again, we've been to Sesame Place so many times, and\n13 he never gets that acknowledgment.  Neither does\n14 R .  So the first feeling was the hurt and then\n15 a washing over of anger.\n16      Q.   So it your testimony, Ms. Valdez, that\n17 your son, M , has been to Sesame Place multiple\n18 times and has never had an interaction -- a positive\n19 interaction with a character?\n20      A.   Not on the parade, no, no.\n21      Q.   At any point in time in the entire visit,\n22 has he ever had a positive interaction with a\n23 character?\n24      A.   So they have this thing called a\nJA427\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 428 of 1384\nPage 59\n1 don't remember exactly, but I know that she was in\n2 the backdrop.\n3      Q.   Now, this -- so we're clear on the record,\n4 at this point in time, you're talking about a visit\n5 other than December 29th, 2021, or you're talking\n6 about December 29th, 2021?\n7      A.   No.  This is not December 29th, no.\n8      Q.   Was this before then, or was it after?\n9      A.   No.  This was before.  This was before.  I\n10 can't remember exactly.\n11      Q.   But you don't recall a situation where\n12 Abby was posted at a certain point in the park --\n13      A.   No.  I'm sorry.\n14      Q.    -- you stood in line with your child to\n15 get a picture with it.\n16                You don't recall doing that at any\n17 point in time in any of your visits to Sesame Place?\n18      A.   No.  I don't recall.  No.\n19      Q.   At the time of the -- Abby's failure to\n20 interact with your son on December 29th, 2021, what\n21 did he say, if anything, to you about that?\n22      A.   What did he say?\n23      Q.   Yes.  To you.\n24      A.   Well, he said, \"I want\" -- basically,\nJA428\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 429 of 1384\nPage 60\n1 like, he wants to come back, he wants to try again,\n2 basically.  Like, I don't know the exact words he\n3 used, but that's what he's asking for.  He wants to\n4 come back, he wants to try again.\n5      Q.   How soon after the Abby failure to\n6 interact with him did he make this statement?\n7      A.   Right away.  Like, I mean, he walked over\n8 to me.  He was really sad.  And then I turned off my\n9 camera, and that's when we -- you know, because I\n10 went in to give him a hug.  I turned my camera off,\n11 put my phone away, gave him a hug.  He said he wants\n12 to come back, wants to try again.  He asked -- did\n13 he ask?  What did he ask me?  Well, yeah.\n14      Q.   So if I'm understanding the sequence you\n15 just testified to, you filmed the interaction -- the\n16 failure of Abby to interact; is that correct?\n17      A.   Yes.\n18      Q.   And then your son came over to you, you\n19 turned off your phone, and then had this discussion\n20 with him where he said he wanted to try again?\n21      A.   Yeah.  I mean, it wasn't a long\n22 discussion.  It was more, like, in the moment, yes,\n23 that he wants -- \"I want\" -- he was complaining,\n24 whining, \"I want to see Abby; I want to hug Abby,\"\nJA429\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 430 of 1384\nPage 61\n1 something like that.  And I was just trying to\n2 divert his attention to something else because I\n3 didn't want him to start crying or, you know, to,\n4 kind of, you know, stay there emotionally.  Like I\n5 said, M  is very, very, very sensitive.\n6      Q.   But in this interaction you having with\n7 your son, was this while your camera was running or\n8 while it was off?\n9      A.   No.  It was off.  I turned it off, put\n10 away my phone to give him a hug, so.\n11      Q.   During this failure, I guess, to interact\n12 with Abby situation, who else was present with you,\n13 other than M ?\n14      A.   R  was there and my God daughter,\n15 B  T .\n16      Q.   All right.  And at the time of this\n17 interaction, how old was R ?\n18      A.   R  was two.\n19      Q.   Is it Brianna?\n20      A.   B .\n21      Q.   B .\n22                And how old was B ?\n23      A.   She was nine.\n24      Q.   And B  is your God daughter; is that\nJA430\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 431 of 1384\nPage 62\n1 right?\n2      A.   She's my God daughter, yes.\n3      Q.   Did the God daughter say anything to you\n4 about the failure of Abby to hug M.L.?\n5      A.   No.  She didn't say anything.  She was\n6 just over to the side holding R 's hand.\n7      Q.   Did R  say anything about not getting\n8 a hug from Abby?\n9      A.   So my 2 year old daughter is only now\n10 beginning to speak clearly, so.\n11      Q.   The answer is \"no\"?\n12      A.   No.\n13      Q.   Okay.  Ms. Valdez, the situation that\n14 you've described with Abby not hugging your son, how\n15 has that affected you?\n16      A.   Okay.  So I would say it's caused me\n17 emotional trauma because after that interaction,\n18 that's when it, kind of, became -- it was cemented\n19 in my mind that this was just never going to happen.\n20                So whenever I did go back to the\n21 park, I always made sure that -- I know when the\n22 parade starts, and I know when it ends.  There are\n23 two different -- there are two different times for\n24 the parade.\nJA431\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 432 of 1384\nPage 63\n1                What I would do is I would make sure\n2 we were all the way on the other side of the park or\n3 just completely out of earshot what's going on.  I\n4 didn't want the kids to, once again, want to go\n5 back.\n6                Now, because my son is a little\n7 older, he understands.  He would see that the parade\n8 is on, and say, \"Oh, we missed it.\"  I'm like, \"Oh,\n9 it's okay.  Always next time.\"  Always trying to\n10 divert it, divert his attention to something else\n11 and make light of it.  I don't want to tell my son,\n12 \"We're not doing this again because mommy has given\n13 up.  Like, we've done this so many times, and it's\n14 always the same result.\"  He's too young.  I'm not\n15 having that conversation with him.\n16                So I'll just -- it -- I mean, at the\n17 end of the day, I purchased the season pass, so --\n18 and the kids enjoy the park.  You know, outside of\n19 that, you know, the rides are age appropriate, you\n20 know, and they have a good time with the water\n21 and -- you know, so I take them.  I already paid\n22 this money.  \"Let's do this.  Let's go back.  Let's\n23 enjoy the park.\"\n24                But yeah.  It's really -- it's very\nJA432\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 433 of 1384\nPage 64\n1 upsetting.  I'm very upset.  I'm very hurt.  Yeah.\n2 It's caused -- it's caused quite some frustration\n3 and anger and, you know, just physical and emotional\n4 trauma, honestly.\n5      Q.   So I take it from what you just said that\n6 you returned to the park --\n7      A.   Yes.\n8      Q.    -- after December 29th, 2021, correct?\n9      A.   Yes.\n10      Q.   How many times?\n11      A.   I can't tell you that.  I don't remember\n12 how many times exactly.\n13      Q.   But is it fair to say, based on your\n14 testimony, that each time you went back with your\n15 children, you deliberately avoided the parade so as\n16 not to have another disappointment like you had on\n17 December 29th?\n18      A.   That's correct.\n19      Q.   In any of those return trips did you make\n20 any effort to get any other kind of interaction with\n21 Abby, other than through the parade?\n22      A.   No.\n23      Q.   Returning to December 29th, after the Abby\n24 failure to hug situation --\nJA433\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 434 of 1384\nPage 65\n1           MR. O'CONNELL:  Objection.\n2 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n3      Q.   -- what happened next?\n4           MR. O'CONNELL:  Objection.\n5           You can answer.\n6           THE WITNESS:  What happened next?\n7 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n8      Q.   Yeah.  What did you do next?\n9      A.   I diverted them to something else, to do\n10 something else to get their minds off of it so\n11 M  won't cry.  Again, M  is very, very\n12 emotional.  He's very quick to break down crying,\n13 and it takes a while to, kind of, calm him down.\n14                So what I did was I took him over to\n15 another ride or did something else to lift his\n16 spirit.\n17      Q.   And how much further -- how much time did\n18 you spend in the park after the Abby incident that\n19 we talked about before you went home?\n20      A.   Not much longer because the park was close\n21 to closing at that point.  So we weren't there that\n22 much longer after that.\n23      Q.   Did you get in line -- or was there even\n24 an opportunity at that point after the Abby\nJA434\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 435 of 1384\nPage 66\n1 situation we discussed to get in line and be\n2 photographed with another character?\n3      A.   No, sir.\n4      Q.   How has this experience that you've\n5 described on December 29th affected M ?\n6      A.   Well, he's not aware that he's been\n7 discriminated against.  They still love the Sesame\n8 Street characters, and he still asks to return and\n9 see the characters or, you know, try, like, once\n10 again, to try again, but that's about it.  I mean,\n11 you know, there's only so much you're going to get\n12 from a kid that -- you know, his age.  He just\n13 turned 5, so.\n14      Q.   Well, is it fair to say that Abby's\n15 failure to hug him had no affect on him?\n16           MR. O'CONNELL:  Objection.\n17           THE WITNESS:  No.  It did have an affect\n18      on him, immediately.  Immediately it had --\n19      it's evident in the video that he was very much\n20      hurt by it.  Immediately had an affect on him.\n21      Like I had said, my son is very, very\n22      sensitive.\n23 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n24      Q.   Now, has that effect lingered and\nJA435\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 436 of 1384\nPage 68\n1      can't.\n2           So it's evident that this is something\n3      that bothers him.  He wants to go back.  He\n4      wants to give her a hug.  He wants to interact\n5      with Abby.  Abby is his favorite.\n6 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n7      Q.   Have you told him that he's not going to\n8 get that chance?\n9      A.   In that way?  No.  I'm not going to crush\n10 his dreams and, honestly, if Seaworld, or Sesame\n11 Place, were to change their behavior, I don't see\n12 why he wouldn't have that chance because I would go\n13 back.  I love the park.  Don't get me wrong.  I love\n14 the park.  I've gone there -- I've been visiting the\n15 park for many years now, and I would love for my son\n16 to have that opportunity, honestly.  But there has\n17 to be some type of change.\n18      Q.   And in your view, what would that be?\n19      A.   Well, the park has to -- how do I --\n20 better train or better screen their employees.  You\n21 know, it's not something that -- I come from a very,\n22 very diverse background.  Where I live is very\n23 diverse.  We don't experience -- I mean, you know, I\n24 have -- they're two little kids.  I'm usually\nJA436\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 437 of 1384\nPage 69\n1 home -- either usually home or school or work or the\n2 park in the neighborhood.  So we don't really\n3 experience discrimination like that because we are\n4 in a very diversed area.\n5                So I feel that if Sesame Place would\n6 do what they need to do to ensure that they're --\n7 especially little children, that they won't have\n8 these type of experiences, then I would gladly take\n9 them back and continue to pay the prices that\n10 they're asking for for the experience.  Absolutely.\n11      Q.   Well, you indicated that you have been\n12 back since the 29th of December, but avoided the\n13 parade; is that correct?\n14      A.   Yes.\n15      Q.   So is it now your view you're not going\n16 back at all?  Or you're still going to return, but\n17 just avoid the parade?\n18      A.   Well, that's a good question.\n19      Q.   That's why I asked it.\n20      A.   That's a good question.\n21                Because I've ruminated this -- that\n22 whole thing -- I've just gone through that whole\n23 scenario in my mind so many times.  Like, \"Do I\n24 really want to go back?\"  You know, they have all of\nJA437\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 438 of 1384\nPage 70\n1 these things coming up.  I still get the e-mails\n2 from Sesame Place with all of the different\n3 activities they have going on.\n4                I'm just -- I'm very -- I'm very\n5 torn.  I don't know whether I want to continue to do\n6 that because my son notices it.  I would say one of\n7 the last times that I was there, he noticed it.\n8 Prior to that, he didn't notice that we were missing\n9 it.  But he noticed it the last time.  And that's\n10 when I was like, \"Oh, he's -- I can't -- this is not\n11 going over his head.\"\n12      Q.   Do you have any current plans to return to\n13 Sesame Place?\n14      A.   As of right now, no.\n15      Q.   Other than what you've described in terms\n16 of Abby not hugging your child on December 29th,\n17 2021, did anything else happen that day while you\n18 were at Sesame Place that you regard as\n19 discrimination?\n20           MR. O'CONNELL:  Objection.\n21           You can answer.\n22           THE WITNESS:  Not that I could recall.\n23 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n24      Q.   After the experience took place that\nJA438\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 439 of 1384\nPage 71\n1 you've described on December 29th, did you discuss\n2 that with anyone?\n3      A.   Repeat the question.\n4      Q.   After the experience that you've described\n5 occurred, did you discuss it with anyone, other than\n6 your lawyers?\n7      A.   I did.  With B 's mom.\n8      Q.   What did you tell her?\n9      A.   Well, I mean, she -- I had B with\n10 me.  I took her on the trip with me.  It was just\n11 me.  I was the only adult there with the three\n12 children.  And her mom, she's my best friend.  We\n13 got on the phone on the way back.  Honestly, I don't\n14 recall if it was on the trip back or if it was when\n15 I got home.  But I spoke to her mom at some point,\n16 and I told her what happened.  Yes.\n17      Q.   What did you say?\n18      A.   What did who say?\n19      Q.   What did you say?\n20      A.   What did I say?\n21      Q.   Yes.\n22      A.   What I testified here from the beginning\n23 to the end of the line.\n24      Q.   What did B 's mom say?\nJA439\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 440 of 1384\nPage 72\n1      A.   Well, you know, B 's mom, she's a\n2 black Dominican.  So she's experienced\n3 discrimination a lot growing up and in, you know,\n4 scenarios.  She's just, kind of, chalking it up,\n5 like, you know, \"This is just what it is.\"  Just\n6 trying to make me feel better.  She's like, \"You\n7 know, and plus you're in Pennsylvania.\"  You know,\n8 it's unfortunate that anyone would have -- would say\n9 something like that.  It doesn't matter where you\n10 are in the world.  You shouldn't experience any\n11 discrimination.  She said, \"Unfortunately, you know,\n12 in Pennsylvania, the folks out there, they could be\n13 pretty -- pretty racist,\" so.\n14      Q.   Did you discuss this Abby situation with\n15 anyone else?\n16      A.   Their dad.\n17      Q.   \"Their\" being?\n18      A.   Their father.\n19      Q.   M 's father?\n20      A.   M 's father, yes.\n21      Q.   And what's their father's name?\n22      A.   Elias Ledesma.\n23      Q.   What did you tell Elias Ledesma?\n24      A.   I just -- I mean, he asked how it went,\nJA440\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 441 of 1384\nPage 79\n1           THE WITNESS:  Okay.\n2 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n3      Q.   Se the answer -- the question was -- and\n4 I'll paraphrase it -- for each instance in which you\n5 claim characters refused to engage, et cetera,\n6 \"identify whether you made any complaints.\"\n7                The answer is, \"Plaintiff did not\n8 make any complaints;\" is that correct?\n9      A.   That's correct.\n10      Q.   Why didn't you make any complaints?\n11      A.   I mean, it was the end of the night.  I\n12 was tired.  I just wanted to go home.\n13      Q.   I take it in addition to not -- have you\n14 ever complained about this to Seaworld, other than\n15 through the lawsuit that you filed?\n16      A.   No.\n17      Q.   Have you made any complaints about the\n18 incident you described taking place on December\n19 29th, 2021 to any governmental agency?\n20      A.   No.\n21      Q.   Have you ever been personally subject to\n22 racial discrimination before, other than what we're\n23 talking about here today?\n24      A.   I probably have, but again, like I said, I\nJA441\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 442 of 1384\nPage 89\n1 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n2      Q.   Okay.  What we're going to do now,\n3 Ms. Valdez, is we're going to play what's on this\n4 flash drive as Valdez video number 1, which I'll\n5 represent to you is the video that comes up when you\n6 click on paragraph 87, note 10 in the first amended\n7 complaint.\n8      A.   Okay.\n9      Q.   If Mr. Smolij will do so, he will run the\n10 film.\n11                (Whereupon, video recording was\n12 played.)\n13           THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry.  Can I have a\n14      napkin, please?\n15 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n16      Q.   You mean a Kleenex?\n17      A.   Yes, Kleenex, please.\n18           MR. O'CONNELL:  Thank you.\n19           THE WITNESS:  Thank you.\n20 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n21      Q.   Are you ready?\n22      A.   Yes.\n23      Q.   In the film we just saw, Ms. Valdez, the\n24 boy with the cap and the olive fur jacket is M.L.;\nJA442\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 443 of 1384\nPage 90\n1 is that correct?\n2      A.   Yes.\n3      Q.   And the little girl in the black fur\n4 jacket is your daughter; is that right?\n5      A.   Yes.\n6      Q.   And the African-American girl with the\n7 parka and the mask is the God daughter; is that\n8 correct?\n9      A.   Yes.\n10      Q.   Is it your testimony, ma'am, that the\n11 Seaworld employee wearing the Abby costume saw your\n12 son and deliberately ignored him?\n13      A.   Yes, it is.\n14      Q.   And what do you base that on?\n15      A.   What do I base it on?\n16      Q.   Yes.\n17      A.   Well, I mean, if she saw the little boy\n18 that was on the stroller and she saw the little boy\n19 next to the stroller and -- I mean, it's evident\n20 that she can see my son.\n21      Q.   Other than the video itself, do you have\n22 any evidence that the employee actually saw your son\n23 and ignored him?\n24      A.   Other than the video?\nJA443\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 444 of 1384\nPage 91\n1      Q.   Yes.\n2      A.   Well, that's the moment that it happened,\n3 so.\n4      Q.   But I take it, you didn't have a\n5 discussion with the Abby employee after this\n6 interaction to get any information about why she did\n7 what she did?\n8      A.   We don't have access to the employees that\n9 are in the costumes.  Once they get on their floats,\n10 they go to the back, and you don't see them again.\n11      Q.   You don't have any personal experience, do\n12 you, with the actual costumes that these employees\n13 wear?\n14      A.   No.  I've put a head on once at a birthday\n15 party.\n16      Q.   A Sesame Place head?\n17      A.   No.  A character head, so I know what it\n18 looks like on the inside.\n19      Q.   Okay.  What character head was it?\n20      A.   I think it was Mickey Mouse.\n21      Q.   But you've had no -- other than that\n22 experience with Mickey Mouse, you had no experience\n23 with Sesame Street character heads, right?\n24      A.   Uh-uh.\nJA444\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 445 of 1384\nPage 92\n1      Q.   Do you regard Abby's failure to hug M.L.\n2 as based on the fact that he's Hispanic?\n3           MR. O'CONNELL:  Objection.\n4           You can answer.\n5           THE WITNESS:  It's based on the fact that\n6      he's not a white little boy.  Whether she knew\n7      or not whether he was Hispanic or black or any\n8      other race, I don't think that -- the point is\n9      that he's not a white little boy.  It's evident\n10      that he's not a white little boy.\n11 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n12      Q.   And did you tell him that that was the\n13 reason that this didn't happen?\n14      A.   Tell who?\n15      Q.   Your son.\n16      A.   Absolutely not.\n17      Q.   I take it that he did not have any\n18 understanding that this failure to interact with\n19 Abby was based, potentially, on the fact he's\n20 Hispanic?\n21      A.   No.  He does not have that understanding.\n22      Q.   Was your daughter trying to get a hug from\n23 Abby?\n24      A.   She was a little bit more shy.  As you can\nJA445\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 446 of 1384\nPage 96\n1      A.   No.\n2      Q.   Total stranger?\n3      A.   Yes, she is.\n4                So, again, we only go by what we see.\n5 So if Abby Cadabby saw, whoever was in that costume\n6 would also be making the same assumptions that\n7 everyone would make, just by looking at someone.\n8      Q.   But you're assuming Abby actually saw your\n9 son and refused to hug him; is that correct?\n10      A.   I'm sure that she saw him.  It's her job\n11 to look down and see the little children.  And my\n12 son was actually taller than the little boy on the\n13 stroller, who was standing up, who stood up on his\n14 stroller.  He was actually taller.  You could see\n15 that in the video.  There's just no way that she\n16 missed him.\n17      Q.   So M  was taller than one of the\n18 children who actually received a hug?\n19      A.   Yes.\n20                (Exhibit Valdez-11 marked for\n21 identification.)\n22 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n23      Q.   Going to show you what we've marked as\n24 Valdez Exhibit number 11.\nJA446\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 447 of 1384\nPage 97\n1                For the record, Ms. Valdez, I'll\n2 represent to you this is a sequence of still shots\n3 from the same video we just placed, Valdez video\n4 number 1, that I've numbered, for convenience, pages\n5 001 through 005.\n6                If you could, just take a minute to\n7 look at each one of these pages.  I'm going to ask\n8 you a question about it.\n9      A.   Okay.  Yes.  Mhm.  Okay.\n10      Q.   So this child who is shown here on Exhibit\n11 11 with the green striped hat, do you see him?\n12      A.   Yes.  Mhm.\n13      Q.   I don't know whether it's a him.\n14                But this child, as you see here, is\n15 it your testimony that this person is white?\n16      A.   Yes.\n17      Q.   And this is one of the individuals who\n18 received a hug from Abby; is that correct?\n19      A.   Yes.  He's the little boy that was\n20 standing next to the other little boy or girl that\n21 was in the stroller.\n22      Q.   And, again, other than the visual itself,\n23 you have no basis for the assertion that this person\n24 is a white person, correct?\nJA447\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 448 of 1384\nPage 98\n1      A.   That's correct.\n2           VIDEOGRAPHER:  Can you scoot this way?\n3           THE WITNESS:  Sure.\n4                (Exhibit Valdez-12 marked for\n5 identification.)\n6 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n7      Q.   I'll show you what we've marked as Valdez\n8 Exhibit number 12.\n9      A.   I can see her better here.\n10      Q.   Okay.  So, again, I'll represent to you,\n11 ma'am, that this is a series of still shots from\n12 that same video, Valdez number 1, that we've played.\n13      A.   Yes.\n14      Q.   That I've numbered 1 -- 1 through 6.\n15      A.   You see her better here.  You see her so\n16 much better.  You see.\n17      Q.   Take a minute to look at this.  I'll ask\n18 you a question.\n19      A.   Yep.\n20      Q.   Is it fair to say, Ms. Valdez, that these\n21 still shots demon- -- show the second child who was\n22 hugged by Abby Cadabby?\n23      A.   The second child?\n24      Q.   Yes.\nJA448\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 449 of 1384\nPage 99\n1      A.   With the green striped hat?\n2      Q.   All right.  All right.  With Exhibit 11,\n3 we focused on the child with the green striped hat.\n4      A.   Right.\n5      Q.   And then there was another child that got\n6 hugged, right?\n7      A.   Yes.  In the stroller, yes.\n8      Q.   All right.  Do these still shots show the\n9 second child being hugged, if you look at Abby and\n10 the person interacting with Abby?\n11      A.   Yes.  On page 003, you see it here.\n12      Q.   All right.  So on page 003, you see a\n13 person being hugged by Abby; is that correct?\n14      A.   That's the little -- boy or girl that was\n15 in the stroller, yes.\n16      Q.   All right.  And is it your testimony that\n17 that person is white?\n18      A.   Yes, yes.\n19      Q.   And, again, do you have any other basis\n20 for that assertion, other than the appearance?\n21      A.   The appearance, yes.\n22      Q.   Okay.  But anything else?\n23      A.   No.\n24      Q.   After this incident took place where Abby\nJA449\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 450 of 1384\nPage 106\n1 submitted because that's the one that I had already\n2 shortened.\n3      Q.   All right.  Can you tell from what we just\n4 played what the ethnicity of the child in the green\n5 hat is?\n6      A.   Yeah.  It's a little white boy.\n7      Q.   So you would say he's white?\n8      A.   Yeah.  He's a little white boy.\n9      Q.   I would like to play Valdez video number\n10 4, which is on Exhibit number 9, and I'll ask you a\n11 few questions.\n12      A.   Mhm.\n13                (Whereupon, video recording was\n14 played.)\n15 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n16      Q.   Ms. Valdez, is Valdez video number 4 a\n17 video that you made?\n18      A.   Yes.\n19      Q.   And I take it from the sequence here, this\n20 video was made after the situation which Abby did\n21 not give M.L. a hug; is that correct?\n22           MR. O'CONNELL:  Objection.\n23           You can answer.\n24           THE WITNESS:  It looks like it.  I don't\nJA450\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 451 of 1384\nPage 107\n1      recall exactly.\n2 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n3      Q.   And at several points on here, you appear\n4 to be laughing; is that correct?\n5      A.   Yes.\n6      Q.   That's your voice?\n7      A.   Yes.\n8      Q.   That's your voice pointing out the\n9 characters?\n10      A.   Yes.\n11      Q.   At this point in time, were you upset\n12 about the fact that Abby had not hugged --\n13      A.   Yeah.\n14      Q.    -- your child?\n15      A.   Absolutely.\n16      Q.   Were you outraged?\n17      A.   I was.\n18           MR. SIMPSON:  What I would like to do,\n19      Mr. Smolij, if you could, run this tape, again,\n20      from 3:15 up to about 3:55.\n21           (Whereupon, video recording was played.)\n22           MR. SIMPSON:  Okay.  That's good.\n23 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n24      Q.   I don't know whether you noticed, but in\nJA451\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 452 of 1384\nPage 108\n1 that sequence, there were several shots of that\n2 child in the green hat who had been hugged by Abby.\n3                Did you see that?\n4      A.   Yes, I did.\n5                (Exhibit Valdez-13 marked for\n6 identification.)\n7 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n8      Q.   Mark this as Exhibit 13.\n9                And, Ms. Valdez, I'll represent to\n10 you these were several still shots that were taken\n11 from Valdez video number 4 in that sequence in the\n12 video at 3:15 to about 3:55.\n13      A.   Yes.\n14      Q.   If you could, take a look at this.\n15      A.   Yes.  Mhm.  He's a cutie.  Yep.  That's\n16 him or her.  Could be a little girl, too.\n17      Q.   Now, it's the case, is it not, Ms. Valdez,\n18 that this is the child that was hugged by Abby in\n19 the prior video, correct?\n20      A.   Yes.\n21      Q.   Is it your testimony that this child shown\n22 on Exhibit 13 is white?\n23      A.   Yes.  He looks white to me.\n24      Q.   Are you ruling out the fact that this\nJA452\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 453 of 1384\nPage 109\n1 child might be Hispanic?\n2      A.   Yes, I am.\n3      Q.   You would rule out the fact that this\n4 child might be Asian?\n5      A.   Yeah.\n6      Q.   Is the child a minority of any kind, in\n7 your opinion?\n8      A.   No.\n9      Q.   And based on what you're suing Seaworld,\n10 if it turned out this child in the green hat is, in\n11 fact, the member of a minority group, such as Asian,\n12 such as Hispanic, is the fact that Abby hugged him\n13 or her, but not your child, discrimination?\n14           MR. O'CONNELL:  Objection.  She's a fact\n15      witness.  You're asking hypotheticals.\n16 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n17      Q.   You can answer.\n18           MR. O'CONNELL:  Objection.\n19           THE WITNESS:  So this child looks like a\n20      Caucasian child to and me.  That's all I have\n21      to say about that.\n22 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n23      Q.   All right.  Assuming for the purposes of\n24 my question, that the child is Korean.  Let's assume\nJA453\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 454 of 1384\nPage 110\n1 that's true.  We don't know one way or the other.\n2 Let's assume that it is.\n3                Assuming the child is Korean, the\n4 fact that Abby hugged a Korean child, but not your\n5 child, would that be discrimination?\n6           MR. O'CONNELL:  Objection.  You're asking\n7      hypotheticals of a fact witness, which is\n8      inappropriate.\n9 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n10      Q.   Do you know?\n11           MR. O'CONNELL:  Same objection.\n12           THE WITNESS:  It's still discrimination\n13      because my child looks black.  And the major\n14      issue is racism against children or people in\n15      general that are black.\n16           So I don't really know how to answer that\n17      question, or I can't really give you what\n18      you're asking for because I really can't,\n19      hypothetically -- or rather, look at it the way\n20      you're looking at it or answer the question\n21      because, to me, this child looks like a little\n22      Caucasian baby.\n23 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n24      Q.   Okay.  Despite the fact M  did not\nJA454\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 455 of 1384\nPage 111\n1 get a hug, it's true, is it not, that Abby, the\n2 character, did interact with you and your family\n3 during this parade?\n4      A.   No.  Abby did not interact with us.\n5           MR. SIMPSON:  All right.  I would like to\n6      play Valdez video number 5 on Exhibit 9.  And\n7      run it beginning at approximately -- excuse\n8      me -- run it from -- well, run it up to 44, 44\n9      seconds.\n10           MR. SMOLIJ:  45?\n11           MR. SIMPSON:  Yeah.  Beginning -- strike\n12      that.\n13           Run it from the beginning to 1:01.\n14           (Whereupon, video recording was played.)\n15 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n16      Q.   So this is a video you made, ma'am; is\n17 that correct?\n18      A.   Yes, it is.\n19      Q.   This video was made in the sequence of\n20 time, this was at the beginning of the parade,\n21 correct?\n22      A.   Yes, it was.\n23      Q.   This was before the failure to hug your\n24 child occurred, correct?\nJA455\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 456 of 1384\nPage 112\n1      A.   Yes, it is.\n2      Q.   So in this situation, Abby threw both of\n3 your children kisses; is that correct?\n4      A.   I told them that she did, but no, she did\n5 not.  She's just going like this to everyone in the\n6 the crowd.\n7      Q.   Notwithstanding what you said, the kisses\n8 weren't -- it's your testimony they weren't aimed at\n9 your child?\n10      A.   No.  They were aimed at the crowd.\n11      Q.   All right.  Did your children, in fact,\n12 throw kisses back?\n13      A.   Did they?\n14      Q.   Well, I'm asking you.\n15                Did they?\n16      A.   I don't remember if they did.  They\n17 probably did, if I told them to.\n18      Q.   Did you throw kisses back to Abby?\n19      A.   No, no.  I don't recall throwing kisses\n20 back to Abby.  It's not something that I would do.\n21           MR. SIMPSON:  I want to turn to Valdez\n22      video number 6 on Exhibit 9.  And I want to\n23      return this from 1:09 to 2:14.\n24 BY MR. SIMPSON:\nJA456\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 457 of 1384\nPage 116\n1 because that's how I remember it, but four little\n2 white kids and then snubbed mine.  That's my claim.\n3                You know, I'm not arguing that, yeah,\n4 he went like this.  But then, again, if my daughter\n5 was standing right next to the little white boy,\n6 then he was interacting with both of them.\n7      Q.   I guess that depends on the little white\n8 boy's perception, doesn't it?\n9      A.   I guess.  Just like this only has to do\n10 with my perception.  You know, this is how I -- I'm\n11 not -- I don't have an issue with Murray at all, now\n12 that I know his name.\n13      Q.   This interaction that we just played, this\n14 happened before the failure of Abby to hug your\n15 child; is that correct?\n16           MR.

Do you recognize that as the infamous\n6 Rosita video withholding the two blacks girls you\n7 referenced earlier in your testimony?\n8      A.   Yes.\n9      Q.   Okay.  Now, based on -- when did you -- I\n10 may have asked this, and I apologize if I have.\n11                When did you first become aware of\n12 that particular video?\n13      A.   Sometime in the beginning of summer.\n14      Q.   Do you know whether you were aware of this\n15 video we just played, Valdez number 7, before or\n16 after you posted your video on YouTube?\n17      A.   It was after; it was after.\n18      Q.   You posted it after or you found out about\n19 the -- that was a bad question.\n20                Had you already seen Valdez video\n21 number 7 when you made your post of your video on\n22 YouTube?\n23      A.

Yes.\n3      Q.   So you were outraged at the time you made\n4 this post; is that correct?\n5      A.   Yes.\n6      Q.   And I take it, were you outraged on\n7 December 29th --\n8      A.   I was; I was.\n9      Q.    -- 2021?\n10                Again, you need let me finish the\n11 question.\n12      A.   Oh, I'm sorry.  Yes.\n13      Q.   So you were outraged on 12/29/21; that is\n14 right?\n15      A.   Mhm.\n16                (Exhibit Valdez-16 marked for\n17 identification.)\n18 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n19      Q.

Mhm.\n3      Q.   Do you recognize this is a Facebook\n4 account and a Facebook post that you made?\n5      A.   Yes.\n6      Q.   The Facebook post of January 11th on page\n7 2 makes reference to an experience you had with\n8 R  on the Grover Trail at Sesame Place.\n9      A.   Mhm.\n10      Q.   And I think what you meant to say was,\n11 \"This past December;\" is that correct?\n12      A.   Yes.\n13      Q.   In other words, P-A-S-T.\n14                P-A-S-S-E-D is a typo?\n15      A.   Oh, yes, yes.\n16      Q.   All right.  So when you make reference to\n17 \"this past December,\" what trip does that have a\n18 reference to?\n19      A.   I'm not sure, because I went to Sesame\n20 Place in December.  I believe I went twice.  I went\n21 more than once that December.  The last trip I made\n22 to the -- I made to Sesame Place that year was the\n23 29th.  So prior to that in that December, I did go.\n24 I believe it was with their dad.  We had a family\nJA460\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 461 of 1384\nPage 122\n1 trip.\n2      Q.   Okay.  All right.  Do you know whether\n3 this Facebook post is referring to the first or\n4 second December trip?\n5      A.   I'm not a hundred percent sure, but this\n6 was in one of the rides.  And like I had said\n7 before, my kids -- we really love the park.  We\n8 enjoy the rides.  Everything is, you know, for the\n9 kids, catered to them, to toddlers.\n10      Q.   When you make reference in this post to --\n11 at the top there, \"Katie Valdez is feeling excited\n12 in Sesame Place.\"\n13      A.   Mhm.\n14      Q.   Is that a characterization of your state\n15 of mind or R 's state of mind?\n16      A.   Both of us.  We were both excited on the\n17 Grover Trail.\n18      Q.   And this was after the incident with Abby\n19 on the 29th of -- December 29, 2021; is that\n20 correct?\n21           MR. O'CONNELL:  Objection.\n22           THE WITNESS:  No.  That's not correct.\n23      I -- we did not ride the Grover Trail after the\n24      parade.  We did not ride the Grover Trail\nJA461\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 462 of 1384\nPage 123\n1      afterwards.  So if this took place on the 29th,\n2      this was before the parade.\n3 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n4      Q.   Right.\n5      A.   Definitely.\n6      Q.   But just for clarity, this statement,\n7 \"Katie Valdez is feeling excited at Sesame Place\" --\n8      A.   Mhm.\n9      Q.   -- was made by you --\n10      A.   Yes.\n11      Q.   -- on January 11th, 2022; is that correct?\n12      A.   Yes.  That's correct.\n13      Q.   Were you still outraged by the treatment\n14 of December 29th, 2021 when you made this post?\n15      A.   I had not yet had the experience yet when\n16 I took this video.  This video was prior to the\n17 parade.  We did not get on the Grover Trail after\n18 the parade, so no.\n19      Q.   I got you on that one.\n20                But in terms of the time you made the\n21 Facebook post on January 11th, 2022, were you\n22 outraged?\n23      A.   Of course I was still upset about it, but\n24 again, I was upset and I was avoiding the parade.\nJA462\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 463 of 1384\nPage 124\n1 That does not eliminate the fact that I enjoyed my\n2 time with my kids there, as far as the rides, as far\n3 as their joy in everything else in the park.  The\n4 park is -- you know, everything in the park is\n5 something that we enjoy together.  I mean,\n6 especially this here.  This was hilarious.  This was\n7 funny.\n8      Q.   The Grover Trail?\n9      A.   No.  Her response.\n10      Q.   Her response?\n11      A.   Yes.  In this particular video was really\n12 funny.\n13      Q.   So if I could turn your attention back to\n14 Exhibit 6, which are your interrogatory answers.\n15      A.   Mhm.\n16      Q.   And direct you back to your answer of\n17 interrogatory number 1 on page 2.\n18      A.   Mhm.\n19      Q.   Basically number 1 asks you to provide\n20 certain information for each visit that you made.\n21                Number 1A was the date of the visit.\n22 So you listed here in the answer to number 1 in\n23 subpart A a number of visits with a number of dates.\n24      A.   Mhm.\nJA463\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 464 of 1384\nPage 125\n1      Q.   So it appears that looking at this list of\n2 dates, you went back to the park on April 11th,\n3 2022; is that correct?\n4      A.   Yes.  That's correct.\n5      Q.   And at that point in time, are you still\n6 outraged by the Abby failure to hug your child?\n7      A.   I would say I -- I was still very much\n8 upset, very much outraged, very much, in a sense,\n9 feeling the emotional trauma behind it, which is why\n10 I avoided the parade all together.  However, I\n11 continue to take my kids back because we enjoy the\n12 rest of the park.  The park is amazing.  For the\n13 little toddlers, they -- I mean, the kids, they love\n14 the characters.  And I'm not going to sit there and\n15 have a conversation with a 2 and 3 and 4 year old\n16 about discrimination.\n17      Q.   And this return trip on April 11th,\n18 2022 --\n19      A.   Yes.\n20      Q.    -- did any Sesame character ignore or\n21 refuse to interact with either of your children?\n22      A.   We didn't -- we weren't at the parade.  So\n23 we don't go to the parade.  If they saw any\n24 characters, because I can't be specific, I don't\nJA464\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 465 of 1384\nPage 126\n1 remember specific details, but if they saw any\n2 characters, it's probably from afar, and that's all\n3 I can answer to that.\n4      Q.   It indicates here on the answer to\n5 interrogatory number 1A, you returned to the park on\n6 June 25th, 2022; is that correct?\n7      A.   That's correct.\n8      Q.   Were you outraged still at that point in\n9 time?\n10      A.   Yes.  I was still very much upset about\n11 it.\n12      Q.   In that particular visit, did any Sesame\n13 characters ignore or fail to interact with either of\n14 your children?\n15      A.   We didn't go to the parade.\n16      Q.   So the answer is \"no\"?\n17      A.   The answer is no because we didn't go to\n18 the parade.  I didn't stop --\n19      Q.   Did you --\n20      A.   I'm sorry to interrupt you.\n21                We didn't stop at any spots where the\n22 characters may be at.  We were just enjoying the\n23 park, the water rides, the Grover Trail is a\n24 favorite, and all of the other amusement activities\nJA465\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 466 of 1384\nPage 127\n1 that they have there, so.\n2      Q.   You don't need to apologize for\n3 interrupting me, if I've interrupted you.  So I'm\n4 not supposed to do that.\n5      A.   I'm just trying to be polite.\n6      Q.   That's all right.  You're doing great.\n7                It appears you went back on August\n8 9th, 2022; is that correct?\n9      A.   Yes.\n10      Q.   Were you still outraged at that point?\n11      A.   Yes.  I was very much still upset, yes.\n12      Q.   In this August 9th trip, did any Sesame\n13 character fail to interact with your children?\n14      A.   Same answer for the previous question.  We\n15 just don't -- I don't -- I don't bother with the\n16 characters anymore.  I just take the kids, you know,\n17 to the rides, and to the water activities that they\n18 have in the park.\n19      Q.   And it appears that the last trip you made\n20 to the park was on August 25th, 2022; is that\n21 correct?\n22      A.   That's correct.\n23      Q.   And that is after you made the post on\n24 YouTube of your video; is that true?\nJA466\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 467 of 1384\nPage 128\n1      A.   That's correct.\n2      Q.   Were you still outraged at the treatment\n3 at this point?\n4      A.   Yes, I was.\n5      Q.   On this trip on August 25th, did any\n6 Sesame character ignore or refuse to interact with\n7 either of your children?\n8      A.   It's the same answer as before.  We don't\n9 approach the characters.  We don't engage in the\n10 parade.  We stay away from anything that has to\n11 do -- I'm very protective of my kids, so I try to\n12 just -- I try to just avoid anything that may hurt\n13 them, so yeah.  We just, you know, continue to do\n14 all of the fun stuff they like to do in the park.\n15 We were there with other family members, so we were\n16 just really enjoying each other's company, so.\n17      Q.   With respect to the August -- let's put it\n18 this way.\n19                With respect to the August 25th\n20 visit, at that point in time, August 25th, 2022, had\n21 you already become a client of Murphy Falcon?\n22      A.   Yes.  By then, yes.  Mhm.\n23      Q.   Were you a client of Murphy Falcon as of\n24 August 9th, 2022?\nJA467\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 468 of 1384\nPage 135\n1 trips?\n2      A.   For my season pass, which includes --\n3 which would include all of the trips because I have\n4 never paid for one ticket.  In this case, not paid\n5 for one ticket.  The cost would be the entire season\n6 pass, so yes.\n7      Q.   All right.  So you want the entire season\n8 pass refunded?\n9      A.   I would like the entire season pass\n10 refunded, yes, if that's what the judge finds in --\n11 I don't know how to -- but yeah.\n12      Q.   Right.  Okay.  So putting the ticket cost\n13 aside, what other economic losses have you\n14 sustained?\n15      A.   Putting the tickets aside?\n16      Q.   Yes.\n17      A.   Well, I mean, again, in the -- in gas, in\n18 tolls, in food.  And so much goes into making a trip\n19 of this caliper.\n20      Q.   So this would be gas, tolls, and food\n21 incurred in connection with each of the trips to\n22 Sesame Place; is that right?\n23      A.   Yes.\n24      Q.   Okay.  Putting that aside, any other\nJA468\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 469 of 1384\nPage 136\n1 economic loss that you're claiming in this case?\n2      A.   Economic loss?  No.\n3      Q.   If you could, turn to page 5.\n4      A.   Okay.\n5      Q.   Interrogatory number 5, the first sentence\n6 states, quote, \"Plaintiffs experienced racial trauma\n7 as a result of defendant's discriminatory\n8 practices,\" closed quotes.\n9      A.   Mhm.\n10      Q.   What do you mean by use of the terms,\n11 \"racial trauma\"?\n12      A.   Well, it's a mental and a physical trauma,\n13 an overwhelming feeling -- an overwhelming fear for\n14 my children to experience or to become aware of a\n15 world like that.  That's something -- that's a very\n16 serious thing for me, you know, which is why I put\n17 on the -- I put on the good act for them.  I keep\n18 smiling.  I keep laughing.  I keep making light.\n19 You know, I put in so much effort to protect them\n20 from something like that.\n21                I mean, children, they don't see\n22 color; they don't see race.  You know, they just\n23 create these relationships and, you know, these\n24 bonds, and I want them to always -- I don't want\nJA469\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 470 of 1384\nPage 137\n1 their innocence to be robbed, in a sense.  I don't\n2 want them to be robbed of their innocence of -- I\n3 mean, I don't want them to be naive either, but at\n4 the same time, it's like, this shouldn't be an\n5 issue, especially in a park that's geared towards\n6 inclusivity and children, young children.  Yeah.\n7 It's a real serious thing for me.\n8                Again, I put on a good face.  I did\n9 that to protect them.  I'm very expressive with my\n10 face.  I don't know if anyone has noticed that here,\n11 but I'm very expressive.  The last thing -- I, kind\n12 of, put myself in the zone, and I make sure that my\n13 children never see an inkling in my face of any kind\n14 of -- that they would pick up I'm upset in any kind\n15 of way.  Especially in a park where they're supposed\n16 to be having the time of their lives.  Yeah.  It's a\n17 real -- it's very upsetting.  It's very, very much\n18 upsetting for me.\n19      Q.   You made mention of the fact that this has\n20 had a physical effect on you.\n21                Can you describe that for me?\n22      A.   It makes my stomach turn.  It makes me\n23 feel that -- you know cool, hot, cool feeling you\n24 get when you're really upset about something?  The\nJA470\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 471 of 1384\nPage 138\n1 knot in your throat, the knot in your stomach.  You\n2 know, a fear.  My heart palpitates.\n3                You know, so -- because I'm just\n4 that -- I come from a very traumatic background, so\n5 I don't want -- so the thought of my kids having to\n6 experience any trauma is just -- it's a very serious\n7 thing for me.  I don't show it.  I see the videos,\n8 and I get it.  I sound so happy and so excited.  I\n9 get it.  But I have to do that.  I have to get into\n10 mommy mode.  They're little ones.  They should not,\n11 at any point, feel that they're not included in an\n12 experience like this, Sesame Place, or Sesame\n13 Street, as they say it.\n14      Q.   I hesitate to ask you, but you made\n15 reference to the fact that you come from a traumatic\n16 background.\n17                What do you mean by that?\n18      A.   There's mental illness in my mother's side\n19 of the family.  My mother suffered from mental\n20 illness from a very young age, so I have experienced\n21 a lot of trauma behind that.  So that's what I mean\n22 by traumatic.  I know what it is to be a child and\n23 not understand what's going on and why you're being\n24 treated a certain way or why things are happening,\nJA471\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 472 of 1384\nPage 146\n1      Q.   That happened there as well?\n2      A.   Well, that they want to interact?  Yes.  I\n3 mean, you know the little ones, they run into the\n4 parade.  Which is why in that video, I reminded\n5 R , \"R , you can't do that.  The\n6 characters -- we have to stand behind a certain\n7 line.\"  So yes, they have tried.\n8      Q.   Do you think you have videos of those\n9 interactions?\n10      A.   No.  I don't really -- I don't really take\n11 my phone out so much in the summertime because we're\n12 dealing with so much water.  You know, there's just\n13 so much that you're carrying with you in the summer,\n14 either water, snacks, you know, there's too much --\n15 towels.  I don't really have my phone out so much,\n16 so.\n17      Q.   Is it fair to say with respect to these\n18 other interactions you just mentioned, you didn't\n19 complain about any of them to Seaworld; is that\n20 correct?\n21      A.   No.  I never made a complaint, no.\n22      Q.   The answer -- getting back to the racial\n23 trauma, answer number 5 on page 5.  It says,\n24 \"Plaintiffs experience racial trauma,\" and\nJA472\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 473 of 1384\nPage 147\n1 plaintiffs here could include your son M.L.\n2                Has M.L. suffered racial trauma?\n3      A.   He doesn't know it, but, yes.  Yes.\n4      Q.   If he doesn't know it, how has he suffered\n5 -- how could he have suffered it?\n6      A.   Well, by his behavior and the things that\n7 he says.  I mean, he's a baby.  Well, he's older\n8 now.  At the time, he was a baby.  A baby can't\n9 really -- you can't expect a child that age to\n10 eloquently express.\n11      Q.   What has he said to you, though, about it?\n12      A.   \"I want Abby.  I want to do it again.  I\n13 want to come back.  I want to go to Sesame Place.\"\n14 Just the other day he was asking me.  He was like,\n15 \"Ma, I want to go to Sesame Place.\"  It's one of\n16 their favorite parks.  And they want to meet -- they\n17 want to have the opportunity with their Abby.\n18      Q.   You could get the amended complaint again,\n19 which is Exhibit 2.  Turn your attention to\n20 paragraph --\n21           MR.

This is a\n2 paragraph entitled, \"Typicality.\"\n3                And about halfway down in that\n4 paragraph, there's a sentence that begins,\n5 \"Plaintiffs, like all class members, have been\n6 damaged by Seaworld's misconduct, in that they have\n7 incurred damages to their enumerated civil rights,\n8 have and/or will incur economic damages, and/or have\n9 or will incur non-economic damages, including but\n10 not limited to.\"\n11                All right.  So I want to go through\n12 each one of these, and ask you, Ms. Valdez, first of\n13 all, have you suffered humiliation as a result of\n14 the acts in question in this case?\n15      A.   It's humiliating.  It's humiliating to\n16 feel you're the second class.  We all pay the same\n17 amount to get into these parks.  And then to feel as\n18 if you're second class because of your background is\n19 humiliating.  That truly --\n20      Q.   I'm sorry.\n21      A.   I'm sorry.\n22      Q.   Have you have you ever had embarrassment?\n23      A.   Yes.\n24      Q.   Have you suffered mental anguish?\nJA474\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 475 of 1384\nPage 149\n1      A.   Yes.\n2      Q.   Have you suffered psychological stress?\n3      A.   Yes.\n4      Q.   Have you suffered depression?\n5      A.   Yes.\n6      Q.   Have you suffered anxiety?\n7      A.   Yes.\n8      Q.   Have you suffered loss of self-respect?\n9      A.   Loss of self-respect?  I guess you could\n10 say yes.  I would -- yeah.\n11      Q.   Have you suffered post-traumatic stress?\n12      A.   Yes.\n13      Q.   To you, what does post-traumatic stress\n14 mean?\n15      A.   Well, I would say it's the stress of --\n16 the fact that I am torn.  The children want to go\n17 back.  They want to experience this again, and\n18 because of the -- it brings on a lot of stress and\n19 anxiety for me because I want to -- I want to be\n20 able to take them and -- but at the same time, I\n21 don't want them to be exposed to that type of\n22 treatment again.  So that's why I say, yes, there is\n23 post-traumatic, you know, stress.\n24      Q.   Have you suffered damage to your physical\nJA475\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 476 of 1384\nPage 150\n1 health?\n2      A.   To my physical health?\n3      Q.   Yes.\n4      A.   Yeah.  I would say so.  My stomach\n5 turning, all of those elements, they cause physical\n6 stress.\n7      Q.   I take it that in connection with at least\n8 your claim, there's been no loss of life; is that\n9 true?\n10      A.   That's true.\n11      Q.   And have you lost any professional\n12 opportunities as a result of this?\n13      A.   No.\n14      Q.   Based on what you've observed, has M.L.\n15 suffered from any of the symptoms we've just been\n16 over?\n17      A.   I would say it's stressful for him.  He\n18 gets a little -- he gets frustrated with me because\n19 he wants me to say, \"Yes.  We're going to go\" and\n20 give him a date, as I used to do.  \"Oh, yeah.  We're\n21 going.  We're going on such and such -- such and\n22 such date with such and such people.\"  So yeah, he's\n23 been pretty frustrated with me.\n24      Q.   That's because you don't want to expose\nJA476\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 477 of 1384\nPage 151\n1 him --\n2      A.   Right.\n3      Q.    -- again, going to the parade and not\n4 getting interaction, correct?\n5      A.   Right.  I don't want him to be treated\n6 that way.  I don't want him, nor R .  Especially\n7 now that R , she's becoming aware, she talking\n8 more.  She's such a lively little girl.  I don't\n9 want her to ever question or be upset over something\n10 like that.\n11      Q.   With respect to the various symptoms that\n12 we've covered in your testimony, have you sought any\n13 medical treatment for any of those things?\n14      A.   No.\n15      Q.   Have you sought any professional\n16 psychiatric treatment for any of those things?\n17      A.   No.\n18      Q.   Any professional psychological treatment?\n19      A.   No.\n20      Q.   Any professional counseling at all?\n21      A.   No.\n22      Q.   Have you sought any such treatment for\n23 your son?\n24      A.   No.  I don't -- I've never even -- I\nJA477\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 478 of 1384\n1              C E R T I F I C A T I O N\n2\n3             I, Gianna Iaconelli, Court Reporter and Notary\n4           Public, certify that the foregoing is a true and\n5           accurate transcript of the foregoing deposition,\n6           that the witness was first sworn by me at the\n7           time, place and on the date herein before set\n8           forth.\n9             I further certify that I am neither attorney\n10           nor counsel for, not related to nor employed by\n11           any of the parties to the action in which this\n12           deposition was taken; further, that I am not a\n13           relative or employee of any attorney or counsel\n14           employed in this case, nor am I financially\n15           interested in this action.\n16                           __________________________\n17                               Gianna Iaconelli\n                              Court Reporter\n18                               and Notary Public\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\nJA478\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 479 of 1384\n          IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n       FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\nQUINTON BURNS, et al.,                 :\n                             Plaintiffs:\n              v.                       :\nSEAWORLD PARKS & ENTERTAINMENT, INC.;  :\nand SEAWORLD PARKS & ENTERTAINMENT LLC,:\n                             Defendant :  NO. 22-cv-02941\n                           -  -  -\n                  Monday, February 20, 2023\n                           -  -  -\n               Videotaped deposition of ASHLEE\nVALETTE, held in the offices of Duane Morris, 30\nSouth 17th Street, 12th Floor, Philadelphia,\nPennsylvania 19103, at 10:03 a.m., on the above\ndate, before GIANNA IACONELLI, a Court Reporter and\nNotary Public of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n                 MAGNA LEGAL SERVICES\n                     866-624-6221\n                   www.MagnaLS.com\nJA479\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 480 of 1384\nPage 2\n1 APPEARANCES:\n2            MURPHY FALCON MURPHY\n           BY:  RONALD E.

So you're generally familiar with how the\n21 process works?\n22      A.   Yes.\n23      Q.   So just to cover a few basic rules for\n24 today's deposition.\nJA484\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 485 of 1384\nPage 18\n1           I want Mr. Smolij to play video Valette\n2      video number 3.\n3           (Whereupon, video recording was played.)\n4 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n5      Q.   Have you seen that before?\n6      A.   Yes.\n7      Q.   Do you remember when you first saw that?\n8      A.   Sometime last summer.  Definitely after my\n9 visit.\n10      Q.   Okay.  And that video shows a character at\n11 Sesame Place, Rosita, not interacting with two black\n12 girls, correct?\n13      A.   Yes.\n14      Q.   Is that part of the news reporting that\n15 you made reference to before?\n16      A.   Yes.\n17      Q.   Okay.  Do you think you saw that video\n18 before or after you contacted Murphy Falcon?\n19      A.   Before.\n20      Q.   Now, Ms. Valette, your child is also a\n21 party to this case; is that correct?\n22      A.   Yes.\n23      Q.   And it's my understanding that her name is\n24 D  V ; is that true?\nJA485\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 486 of 1384\nPage 19\n1      A.   Yes.\n2      Q.   All right.  So what we'll do this in this\n3 deposition, because she's a minor, I'll try to refer\n4 to her initials as D.V.  So we understand when I\n5 say, \"D.V.\" it's referring to D .\n6                Okay?\n7      A.   Yes.\n8      Q.   Okay.  Is the she your only daughter?\n9      A.   No.\n10      Q.   So you have another daughter?\n11      A.   I'm sorry.  Yes.  She's my only daughter.\n12      Q.   Okay.  So I might refer to her as your\n13 daughter.\n14                So we all understand, you have one\n15 daughter, and it's D .\n16      A.   Okay.\n17      Q.   We understand that?\n18      A.   Yes.\n19      Q.   It could be every once in a while I'll\n20 actually use her name or you will use her name, and\n21 I think when we're done with the deposition, we'll\n22 make sure that initials ultimately are in the one\n23 that becomes public, if it ever does, because it can\n24 be used in trial in this case.\nJA486\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 487 of 1384\nPage 20\n1      A.   Thank you.\n2      Q.   That's how we're going to proceed.\n3                Is that okay?\n4      A.   Yes.\n5      Q.   All right.  Do you understand that D.V. is\n6 also a plaintiff in this lawsuit?\n7      A.   Yes.\n8      Q.   And do you have an understanding that you\n9 represent her?\n10      A.   Yes.\n11      Q.   What is your understanding about your\n12 representation of her?\n13           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n14           THE WITNESS:  She's too young to represent\n15      herself.  She can't speak about what happened\n16      or how she's been affected, so I'm doing that\n17      for her.\n18                (Exhibit Valette-3 marked for\n19 identification.)\n20 BY MR.

Yeah.  My job had a class action lawsuit\n4 last year for unpaid overtime wages, FLSA overtime\n5 wages.  It was list year.  I wasn't, like, a\n6 representative.  I decided to participate in it.\n7      Q.   You were a member of the class?\n8      A.   Yes.  I decided to participate, and got\n9 some money for it.\n10      Q.   I take it you didn't have to give a\n11 deposition in that case.\n12      A.   No.\n13      Q.   Have you ever made a claim -- complaint --\n14 excuse me -- of discrimination to any kind of\n15 federal or state agency?\n16      A.   No.\n17           MR.

No.\n11      Q.   Was this something you won as a prize,\n12 given to you as a gift?\n13      A.   No.  From a previous visit the year\n14 before, the one that's listed in 2021, it rained\n15 during our visit, and if it rained for more than an\n16 hour during your visit, you could ask for those at\n17 customer service to come back another day.\n18      Q.

Yes.\n21      Q.   This one appears to be for the 2022\n22 timeframe.\n23      A.   Yes.\n24      Q.   Do you have a statement like this for the\nJA490\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 491 of 1384\nPage 29\n1 purchase that was made in 2021?\n2      A.   I'm sure.  As long as Discover retains\n3 them that long, I would be able to access it.\n4      Q.   Was the 2021 purchase made with the same\n5 credit card?\n6      A.   Yes.\n7      Q.   Is was made with the card ending in 9611?\n8      A.   Yes.\n9      Q.   That's your credit card?\n10      A.   It's shared with me and my husband.\n11      Q.   And your husband's name is?\n12      A.   Jose Valette.\n13      Q.   But you were the one who actually,\n14 physically purchased the ticket in June of 2021?\n15      A.   Yes.\n16      Q.   You went to the park, it rained, and they\n17 gave you free passes for a future visit.\n18                Is that how this worked?\n19      A.   Yeah.  We had to ask for them, but yes.\n20      Q.   Okay.  You could put that exhibit to one\n21 side.\n22                (Exhibit Valette-6 marked for\n23 identification.)\n24 BY MR. SIMPSON:\nJA491\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 492 of 1384\nPage 30\n1      Q.   Showing you what we've marked as Valette\n2 Exhibit number 6.  As you to review this document.\n3 This is a document that was produced in this case as\n4 Valette 0006.\n5                Do you recognize this?\n6      A.   Yes.\n7      Q.   What is this document?\n8      A.   These are the Sunny Day tickets that we\n9 used for the 6/20/22 visit.\n10      Q.   If you could, go back to the answers to\n11 interrogatories, which is number 4.  On page 2, if\n12 you could, look at subpart C to answer number 1, it\n13 says, \"Plaintiff purchased the tickets for 7/14/19\n14 and 6/22/21 in advanced through the Sesame Street\n15 website phone app; however, the app does not provide\n16 the date of purchase.\"\n17                So your access of the website was\n18 through your phone app?\n19      A.   I have the app, and I use the website.\n20      Q.   But when you bought the tickets on\n21 June 22nd, 2021, did you use the website or the\n22 phone app?\n23      A.   I don't recall exactly which one.\n24           MR. SIMPSON:  I think I need -- we need to\nJA492\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 493 of 1384\nPage 32\n1           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n2           THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  A little bit.\n3 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n4      Q.   What is your understanding?\n5      A.   That we gave up the Sunny Day tickets that\n6 we had, and we were entitled to go into the park and\n7 experience everything that was there.\n8      Q.   Did you have any expectation on the trip\n9 as to whether you would have interactions with\n10 Sesame Street characters?\n11      A.   Not necessarily.\n12      Q.   So would it be fair to say that you didn't\n13 necessarily go to the park expecting that your child\n14 would get a hug from every Sesame Street character?\n15      A.   Yeah.\n16      Q.   Or that your child would get a high five\n17 from every Sesame Street character?\n18      A.   Yes.\n19      Q.   Okay.  Is there any promise that Seaworld\n20 made to you in connection with this contract that\n21 you don't think they kept?\n22      A.   Well, that they -- where it says, \"On the\n23 basis of race interact with customers, including the\n24 Valettes.\"  So the fact that they didn't do\nJA493\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 494 of 1384\nPage 33\n1 something because of race.  I think that part of the\n2 contract was broken.\n3      Q.   Okay.  What was it that they didn't do\n4 because of race?\n5      A.   Interact with my kid.\n6      Q.   Did it happen more than one time or just\n7 once?\n8      A.   More than once during that parade.\n9      Q.   All right.  We'll get to that in a minute.\n10                The understanding that you had about\n11 what Seaworld was supposed to do, where did you get\n12 that understanding from?\n13      A.   Just buying tickets.  I guess just general\n14 life.  When you buy something, you're entitled to\n15 use it.  Use everything.  Not really -- nothing\n16 really specifically --\n17      Q.   You indicated, I think, unless I misheard\n18 you, that Seaworld did not interact with your child\n19 on racial grounds, and that was a promise that\n20 Seaworld didn't keep; is that correct?\n21      A.   Well, I was referring more to the\n22 paragraph that you pointed out.\n23      Q.   All right.  Well, let's -- maybe I'm\n24 confused here.\nJA494\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 495 of 1384\nPage 34\n1                So did Seaworld promise you anything\n2 with respect to character interaction that Seaworld\n3 did not provide?\n4      A.   No.\n5      Q.   All right.  So let's focus on June 20th,\n6 2022, your trip to Sesame Place, Langhorne,\n7 Pennsylvania.\n8                Who went with you on the trip?\n9      A.   My husband, my two kids, my grandmother,\n10 my sister, her boyfriend, and my two sister-in-laws.\n11                (Exhibit Valette-7 marked for\n12 identification.)\n13 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n14      Q.   Showing you what we've marked as Valette\n15 Exhibit number 7.  This is a photograph that was\n16 produced in this case as Valette Bates label 0002.\n17                Do you recognize this document?\n18      A.   Yes.\n19      Q.   Is this a photograph of the group of\n20 people that you went to Sesame Place, Langhorne, on\n21 June 20th, 2022?\n22      A.   Yes.  Except for my husband who took the\n23 photo.\n24      Q.   So Mr. Jose Valette was there, but he took\nJA495\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 496 of 1384\nPage 35\n1 the picture?\n2      A.   Yes.\n3      Q.   Starting with the individuals in the back\n4 row, could you identify them left to right?\n5      A.   That's me sitting on the stroller.  To my\n6 left is my sister-in-law, Victoria Valette.  To her\n7 left is her sister, Sophia Valette.  At the far left\n8 is my grandmother, Maria Laguna.  In the front of my\n9 grandmother is R , my son.  Next to R  with\n10 her head down is D .  Next to D  is Michael\n11 Nesterwitz, my sister's boyfriend, now husband.  And\n12 in front of me is my sister, Angelise Aceveda.\n13      Q.   All right.  I guess -- you were going\n14 right to left and I was going left to right.\n15                Just --\n16      A.   Sorry.  I went in a circle.\n17      Q.   I missed the two children.  Identify the\n18 two children.\n19      A.   Sure.  Right next to the gentleman with\n20 the tattoos --\n21      Q.   Yes.\n22      A.   -- is D  V .  She has her head\n23 down.  And then right next to her is my son, R\n24 V .\nJA496\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 497 of 1384\nPage 36\n1      Q.   So, Ms. Valette, in your own words, tell\n2 me what happened on this day of the week at Sesame\n3 Place that you're suing Seaworld about.\n4      A.   We waited.  We got to the parade spot\n5 early, like, 2:00 p.m. to try to get a good spot up\n6 front.  Parked there for an hour.  Hyping the kids\n7 up that the parade was coming.  They were going to\n8 see their favorite characters.  And when the\n9 characters started coming and Grover was coming\n10 right in the direction of my kids, my daughter was\n11 jumping up and down, so excited, and Grover ignored\n12 her and hugged two white kids right next to her.\n13      Q.   What is D.V.'s favorite character, if she\n14 has one?\n15      A.   Oscar.\n16      Q.   And your son, does he have a favorite\n17 character?\n18      A.   Elmo.\n19      Q.   At the time of this interaction -- well,\n20 at the time of this event that you just described\n21 occurred, how old was D.V.?\n22      A.   Just turned 4.\n23      Q.   And how old was your son?\n24      A.   Just turned 2.\nJA497\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 498 of 1384\nPage 37\n1      Q.   Is it your testimony that Grover ignored\n2 both your daughter and your son?\n3      A.   Yes.\n4      Q.   Is your son's situation something you're\n5 suing over?\n6      A.   He's part of the lawsuit, but he's not on\n7 video.\n8      Q.   But is he -- do you understand him to be a\n9 plaintiff in the case?\n10      A.   Yes.\n11      Q.   And do you understand him also to be a\n12 representative in the class action?\n13      A.   I don't think so.\n14           MR. RICHARDSON:  Objection.\n15 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n16      Q.   Do you regard what happened to your\n17 children as discrimination?\n18      A.   Yes.\n19      Q.   Why to you say that?\n20      A.   Because they were treated differently than\n21 the white children standing right beside them.\n22      Q.   At the time this occurred, how did you\n23 feel about it?\n24      A.   Upset.\nJA498\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 499 of 1384\nPage 38\n1      Q.   How did D.V. react to it?\n2      A.   She was really upset.  She was sad.  She\n3 stomped in the video.  She was upset for the rest of\n4 the parade.  That, kind of, ruined the visit.\n5      Q.   How did your son react to it?\n6      A.   I don't think he knows what was going on,\n7 honestly, at his age.\n8      Q.   Did D.V. say anything to you at the time\n9 about this?\n10      A.   Yeah.  She was upset initially.  And then\n11 when the parade kept going, she still didn't get\n12 anybody's attention, she asked, why nobody is giving\n13 her a high five.\n14      Q.   What did you say?\n15      A.   I tried to keep her away from that.  Not\n16 let her think about it.  Tried to keep her excited\n17 about the visit.  She's only 4.  So I don't really\n18 want to ruin her mind with telling her what really\n19 happened.\n20      Q.   How has this experience affected you?\n21      A.   I think it opened my eyes to this is\n22 really life and what she's going to have to deal\n23 with.  I didn't think that could happen to a 4 year\n24 old.\nJA499\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 500 of 1384\nPage 39\n1      Q.   How has it affected your child, your\n2 daughter?\n3      A.   I protected her from a lot of it.\n4 Honestly, it ruined her day that day.  But outside\n5 of that, I tried to not let her think about it\n6 because she's got a lifetime to go with dealing with\n7 racism.  If I can protect her from it for now, I'm\n8 going to try to.  Outside of that day, I don't let\n9 her see the video.  I don't talk to her about it.  I\n10 just try not to bring it up to her.\n11      Q.   And this occurred in connection with the\n12 parade; is that correct?\n13      A.   Yes.\n14      Q.   What time of day was this parade?\n15      A.   The 3:00 p.m. parade.\n16      Q.   So after this interaction, what did you\n17 do?\n18      A.   We left.  We got our stuff and we -- from\n19 the lockers and we turned the stroller in and left.\n20      Q.   So you went straight home?\n21      A.   Yeah.\n22      Q.   You didn't make an attempt -- I mean, let\n23 me ask you this.\n24                Before the parade, did you get in\nJA500\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 501 of 1384\nPage 40\n1 line for a meet and greet with any of the\n2 characters?\n3      A.   No.\n4      Q.   Did you go to any of the shows that\n5 featured any of the characters.\n6      A.   We went to one theater show that was -- I\n7 don't even remember.  It was, like, Elmo and ducks,\n8 I think.  But nothing -- the character lines are too\n9 long for us.\n10      Q.   Is there anything else that happened that\n11 day at Sesame Place that you regard as racial\n12 discrimination?\n13      A.   I mean, Grover was on camera and ignored\n14 my child.  Like I said, she didn't get any attention\n15 for the rest of the parade either.  I mean,\n16 characters just continued to pass them by.  They\n17 interact with children all around my kids.  My kids\n18 got no high fives, no hugs, no nothing.\n19      Q.   Did -- are you saying that other\n20 characters -- characters other than Grover also\n21 refused to interact with your child?\n22      A.   Yeah.\n23      Q.   Which characters were those?\n24      A.   I mean, the whole rest of the parade.  All\nJA501\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 502 of 1384\nPage 41\n1 of the characters in the parade, my children got no\n2 attention.  So everyone.\n3      Q.   Can you name some of them?\n4      A.   Elmo.  I know there was a Teddy bear.  I\n5 don't know his name that passed by.  My son hugged\n6 his leg at some point when he wasn't looking, and he\n7 was interacting with another family beside us.\n8 Oscar, although I don't know if Oscar comes close,\n9 but.  All of the characters that were out roaming,\n10 Cookie Monster, nobody interacted with my kids.\n11      Q.   So these characters were out in the\n12 street, and they didn't come over where you were\n13 located?\n14      A.   Yeah.\n15      Q.   Were there other characters that came down\n16 the line close to your children who ignored them?\n17      A.   I mean, the bear.  I don't know his name,\n18 though.  It was like a Teddy bear.  I think I\n19 submitted a picture of him, too, or video.  He\n20 hugged a family right next to my son, and my son\n21 snuck and hugged his leg when he wasn't looking.\n22      Q.   Okay.  So Grover and the bear.\n23                Any other characters?\n24      A.   Not that I recall that came up close, but\nJA502\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 503 of 1384\nPage 44\n1 other than the video that was made at the time, do\n2 you have any other information other than that as to\n3 the ethnicity of these two children?\n4      A.   No.\n5      Q.   Is it the case that the Grover character's\n6 refusal to interact with your children, is that the\n7 only thing you're suing Seaworld for?\n8      A.   I'm confused by your question.\n9      Q.   You described an interaction by which\n10 Grover, according to your observation, refused to\n11 interact with your children and interacted with two\n12 white children.\n13                Is there anything other than that\n14 that you're suing Seaworld over?\n15      A.   No.  That's my basis.\n16      Q.   Did you experience any other\n17 discriminatory treatment during the June 20th, 2022\n18 trip to Sesame Place?\n19      A.   Not as blatantly, but like I said, the\n20 whole parade, they didn't get any attention.\n21      Q.   So you would describe that as further\n22 discriminatory treatment?\n23      A.   Yes.\n24      Q.   Now, these interrogatory answers were sent\nJA503\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 504 of 1384\nPage 45\n1 out by your lawyers.  It shows on the next-to-last\n2 page, December 19th, 2022.\n3                From and after December 19th, 2022,\n4 have you gone back to Sesame Place?\n5      A.   No.\n6      Q.   Do you have any plans, as you sit here\n7 today, to go back to Sesame Place?\n8      A.   Not at this time, no.\n9      Q.   Why is that?\n10      A.   I don't want to subject my kids to this\n11 right now.\n12      Q.   Have you experienced any discrimination by\n13 Seaworld or by Sesame Place since December 19th,\n14 2022?\n15      A.   No.\n16      Q.   If you look at interrogatory number 3 on\n17 page 4 of Exhibit 4, the question was, basically, to\n18 ask you to identify any complaints that you made\n19 about the interactions that you're complaining of.\n20                The answer was, \"Plaintiff did not\n21 make any complaints;\" is that correct?\n22      A.   Yes.\n23      Q.   Why didn't you complain about what you\n24 observed?\nJA504\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 505 of 1384\nPage 46\n1      A.   I didn't think it was that big of a deal\n2 at the time, honestly.  I saw what happened, but I\n3 deal with this.  My husband deals with this.  This\n4 is just America right now.  I didn't think that it\n5 was -- I don't if what I saw -- if I was really\n6 acknowledging what I saw happened to my kid right\n7 there.  But when it was brought to my eyes that this\n8 is literally happening to kids there, then it, kind\n9 of, opened my eyes that yeah, she was discriminated\n10 against.\n11      Q.   So if it was a big deal at the time you\n12 witnessed it, what made it a big deal later?\n13      A.   I didn't say it wasn't a big deal.  It was\n14 a big deal.  It's always been a big deal.  But I\n15 didn't know if I was really seeing it -- seeing it\n16 as what it was.  I tried to brush it under the rug\n17 to protect my daughter.  And maybe I just wasn't\n18 as -- like, open to acknowledge what really\n19 happened.  But the fact that it's ongoing, then\n20 yeah.  It's really happening.\n21                There was also nobody -- I don't\n22 know.  I don't know why I didn't complain, honestly.\n23 I didn't think it was a big deal at the time.  I\n24 didn't want to make it a big deal at the time.\nJA505\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 506 of 1384\nPage 47\n1      Q.   The video that we played showing the\n2 Rosita interaction with the two black girls, did\n3 that have a bearing on your decision to consider --\n4      A.   Yeah.  It made me realize that it wasn't\n5 just my daughter.  That it is happening.  If it was\n6 just one time, maybe it's one character having a bad\n7 day one day, but if it's happening ongoing, then no.\n8 There's a problem.\n9      Q.   So I take it you made no complaints to\n10 Seaworld or Sesame Place, correct?\n11      A.   No.\n12      Q.   Did you make a complaint about what\n13 happened that day to any other entity, any other\n14 agency, or any other source?\n15      A.   No.\n16      Q.   Have you been subjected to discrimination\n17 before in your life?\n18      A.   Yeah.\n19      Q.   Have you made complaints about it?\n20      A.   Probably not.  Not that I could recall\n21 right now.\n22      Q.   All right.  If we could go back to the\n23 videos that are on Exhibit number 3 --\n24           MR.

Excuse me.\n2           I want to play, for the record, Valette\n3      video number 1.\n4 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n5      Q.   And I'm going to ask you some questions.\n6                (Whereupon, video recording was\n7 played.)\n8 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n9      Q.   The tape we just played, who made that\n10 tape?\n11      A.   My sister.\n12      Q.   Angelise, is that her name?\n13      A.   Yes.\n14      Q.   And explain to me the process from which\n15 Angelise made the tape to the point in time when in\n16 which it was given to your lawyers?\n17      A.   She sends me everything she takes of my\n18 kids.  Before she moved to Florida, she was our,\n19 like, photographer.  All of those pictures she took\n20 that day, she sent me.  I had that on my phone when\n21 I reached out to my other attorney.  When I reached\n22 out to this firm, then they asked me to send it to\n23 them.\n24      Q.   Do you know whether this tape we just\nJA507\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 508 of 1384\nPage 49\n1 played was edited any way?\n2      A.   It was not.\n3      Q.   Was it part of a longer tape in which it\n4 was taken from?\n5      A.   No.\n6      Q.   So is it the case that your sister, what\n7 we just saw, she turned it on exactly at that point\n8 and turned it off exactly that point?\n9      A.   Correct.\n10      Q.   Did you make any tapes that day?\n11      A.   No.\n12      Q.   Did you take any photographs?\n13      A.   No.\n14      Q.   Did your husband?\n15      A.   Not that I could recall.\n16      Q.   You took the photographs that we've, I\n17 guess, seen as Exhibit 7?\n18      A.   Oh, yes.\n19      Q.   Did he take any others?\n20      A.   No.\n21      Q.   Did he take any videos?\n22      A.   No.\n23           MR. SIMPSON:  Let's run it, again, if we\n24      could, the same tape.\nJA508\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 509 of 1384\nPage 50\n1           (Whereupon, video recording was played.)\n2 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n3      Q.   Ms. Valette, in the video we just played,\n4 who said, \"Go give him a hug\"?\n5      A.   My sister, Angelise.\n6      Q.   And who said, I think it was, \"Go with\n7 her\"?  Did you hear that phrase?\n8      A.   No.  I don't know.\n9      Q.   And then who said, \"That's okay; that's\n10 okay.\"\n11      A.   Angelise.\n12      Q.   Are any -- is your voice recorded on that\n13 at all?\n14      A.   Not that I could hear, no.\n15      Q.   Now, Ms. Valette, is it your testimony\n16 that the employee wearing that Grover suit saw D.V.\n17 and deliberately ignored her?\n18      A.   Yes.\n19      Q.   Why do you say that?\n20      A.   He was right there in front of her.  He\n21 was literally hugging the kids right next to her and\n22 didn't interact with her at all.\n23      Q.   Do you know what part of the costume the\n24 employees see out of?\nJA509\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 510 of 1384\nPage 51\n1      A.   Their mouth.\n2      Q.   And it's your testimony that that person\n3 saw your daughter through that mouthpiece and\n4 deliberately --\n5      A.   Actually watching the video on this big\n6 screen right here, I think he would more likely see\n7 my daughter than those other white kids that he\n8 hugged.\n9      Q.   And you regard the Grover character's\n10 failure to hug your daughter is based on the fact\n11 she's a black citizen in the United States?\n12      A.   Yes, sir.\n13      Q.   Other than the film, do you have any basis\n14 for making that assumption?\n15      A.   No.\n16      Q.   And I take it, from what you've said\n17 earlier, that your daughter does not necessarily\n18 understand that the failure to be hugged was because\n19 she's black; is that correct?\n20      A.   We didn't let her understand that.  I\n21 protected her from that.\n22      Q.   And you have not, since the incident in\n23 question, told her that, have you?\n24      A.   No.\nJA510\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 511 of 1384\nPage 52\n1      Q.   If you could, go back to Exhibit number 7,\n2 the photograph.  Look over on the right-hand side.\n3 There appears to be a boy with a black shirt in a\n4 stroller.\n5                Do you see that?\n6      A.   Yes.\n7      Q.   Is that one of the children that Grover\n8 hugged?\n9      A.   Yes.\n10      Q.   And it's your testimony that person is a\n11 white person?\n12      A.   Yes.\n13      Q.   You rule out the possibility that that\n14 person could be a minority?\n15      A.   He looks white.\n16      Q.   He's not Hispanic?\n17      A.   He looks white next to my Hispanic family.\n18      Q.   Do you claim in this case that you're a\n19 victim of discrimination as a result of the way your\n20 daughter was treated?\n21      A.   I think so.\n22      Q.   Why do you say that?\n23      A.   I mean, she's an extension of me.  I think\n24 that the fact that somebody treated my daughter that\nJA511\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 512 of 1384\nPage 53\n1 way, they're also treating me that way.\n2      Q.   So at this point, I want to play on\n3 Exhibit number 2 Valette video number 2.\n4                (Whereupon, video recording was\n5 played.)\n6 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n7      Q.   This is the interaction you mentioned\n8 earlier with the bear character?\n9      A.   Yes.\n10      Q.   This is the Sesame -- do you understand\n11 this to be the Sesame character, Baby Bear?\n12      A.   I don't recognize him, but.\n13      Q.   And is this a video that your sister also\n14 made?\n15      A.   Yes.\n16      Q.   And it's one she sent to you that you, in\n17 turn, sent to your lawyers?\n18      A.   Yes.\n19      Q.   Was that edited in any way?\n20      A.   No.\n21      Q.   So, again, it began exactly where we see\n22 it and ends exactly where it ends?\n23      A.   Correct.\n24      Q.   And the character Baby Bear was hugging\nJA512\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 513 of 1384\nPage 54\n1 other customers; is that correct?\n2      A.   Yes.\n3      Q.   Including a child in a yellow shirt?\n4      A.   Yes.\n5      Q.   Going to mark this as Valette Exhibit\n6 number 8.\n7                (Exhibit Valette-8 marked for\n8 identification.)\n9 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n10      Q.   For the record, Ms. Valette, I'll\n11 represent to you -- we could play the video again if\n12 you want to compare it.\n13                These are still shots from that video\n14 we just played.\n15      A.   Yes.\n16      Q.   Video number 2.  It just stops the action\n17 so you could see what's going on here.\n18                If you could, take a minute to look\n19 at it.  And you'll see on the left-hand side, I put\n20 the counter numbers for the video.\n21                Do you see that?\n22      A.   Yes.\n23      Q.   So I take it from this series of shots\n24 that it's -- that this Sesame character hugged the\nJA513\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 514 of 1384\nPage 55\n1 child in the yellow shirt; is that correct?  Is that\n2 what happened?\n3      A.   Yeah.  It looks like it.\n4      Q.   And the child in the foreground, who is\n5 shorter, wearing the white shirt, the sleeveless\n6 white shirt, is that your son?\n7      A.   My son.\n8      Q.   So your son managed to, it looks like,\n9 come up and hug the character's leg; is that true?\n10      A.   Yes.\n11      Q.   Do you know whether the Baby Bear\n12 character could even see your son?\n13      A.   No.  I don't think he could.\n14      Q.   Why do you say that?\n15      A.   He didn't react to R  hugging him at\n16 all.\n17      Q.   Do you regard this incident -- this\n18 interaction as an instance of discrimination?\n19      A.   Yeah.  Like I said, my kids continued not\n20 to get any attention.  R  is the one that got in\n21 there and got a hug himself.  He felt happy about\n22 that.  But that was from my 2 year old taking\n23 action, not the bear character at all.\n24                (Exhibit Valette-9 marked for\nJA514\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 515 of 1384\nPage 56\n1 identification.)\n2 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n3      Q.   Show you what we've marked as Valette\n4 Exhibit number 9.\n5                And this is a photograph that was\n6 produced in this case and Bates labeled Valette\n7 0003.\n8                Do you recognize this?\n9      A.   Yes.\n10      Q.   Is this a photograph -- who took this\n11 photograph?\n12      A.   I'm guessing my sister.\n13      Q.   The child in the foreground with the white\n14 shirt is your son?\n15      A.   Yes.\n16      Q.   And the child in the background with the\n17 yellow shirt is the one who the Baby Bear character\n18 hugged; is that correct?\n19      A.   The shirts look similar.  I think so.\n20      Q.   Would you agree with me that that person\n21 is not white?\n22      A.   No, he's not.\n23      Q.   What would you guess his ethnicity is?\n24      A.   Asian.\nJA515\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 516 of 1384\nPage 57\n1      Q.   And is your son's ethnicity the same as\n2 you and your daughter's?\n3      A.   My kids are mixed.\n4      Q.   Would you regard your son as a black\n5 citizen in the United States?\n6      A.   Yes.\n7      Q.   On any of the other trips that you've made\n8 to Sesame Place, as you mentioned before, the one\n9 that occurred in 2019, and the one that got\n10 partially rained out, did you make [sic] any\n11 photographs?\n12      A.   No that I recall.\n13      Q.   Did you make any videos?\n14      A.   Not that I recall.\n15      Q.   Did you post anything on any social media\n16 platform about your experience at Sesame Place?\n17      A.   No.\n18      Q.   Ms. Valette, if you could, turn back to\n19 Exhibit 4, interrogatory answers.\n20                I want to direct your attention to\n21 interrogatory number 4, the bottom of the page.  It\n22 asking you to state each item of economic loss or\n23 damage you suffered as a result of the incidents\n24 alleged in this case.\nJA516\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 517 of 1384\nPage 58\n1                Your answer on the next page was,\n2 \"Economic losses include the cost of tickets to\n3 Sesame Place.\"\n4                Other than -- let me ask you, first\n5 of all.\n6                Are you seeking the cost of tickets\n7 for all three of your trips, or just the one on\n8 June 20th, 2022?\n9      A.   We didn't pay for the one on June 2022.\n10 That was Sunny Day tickets.  It would be for the one\n11 prior.\n12      Q.   Okay.  I assume, though, that -- are you\n13 asking for the money you originally paid --\n14      A.   Yeah.\n15      Q.    -- that led to the Sunny Day tickets to\n16 be refunded to you?\n17      A.   Yeah.\n18      Q.   Now, are you asking for the cost of the\n19 tickets for the one prior to the that was rained\n20 out?\n21      A.   Not necessarily, not specifically.\n22      Q.   Other than the economic -- other than what\n23 it states here are the cost of the tickets to Sesame\n24 Place, are you claiming any other economic damages\nJA517\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 518 of 1384\nPage 59\n1 in this case?\n2      A.   Yeah.  That went back to the Discover\n3 statement that I produced.  We paid for parking; we\n4 paid for stroller rental.  We paid for several\n5 things on that visit that afterwards, we, kind of,\n6 just left and took a loss on.\n7      Q.   Okay.  Just so we're clear on the record,\n8 you're referring to Exhibit 5, the credit card\n9 statement?\n10      A.   Yes.\n11      Q.   And this would be -- if I'm following what\n12 you're saying, if you look at Valette page 0010 --\n13      A.   Yes.\n14      Q.    -- these are the items that are part of\n15 your claim for damages?\n16      A.   Yes.\n17      Q.   Okay.  Other than this and the cost of the\n18 tickets, anything else that you would put in the\n19 category of economic damages?\n20      A.   No.\n21      Q.   If you could, turn, Ms. Valette, to\n22 Exhibit 4, which is your interrogatory answers.\n23 Answer number 5, it states that, \"Plaintiffs\n24 experienced racial trauma as a result of defendants'\nJA518\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 519 of 1384\nPage 60\n1 discriminatory practices.\"\n2                As to you, plaintiff, Ashlee Valette,\n3 explain to me what is referenced here by racial\n4 trauma.\n5      A.   I think the sadness, the upsetness that I\n6 felt seeing that happen to my daughter and having to\n7 have a conversation with my husband about it.\n8 Having to protect her from it at the time, and kind\n9 of -- I don't know.  I guess protect her, but not\n10 let her see what was actually happening to her.\n11 Still ongoing when I see the videos, it breaks my\n12 heart.  I mean, I can't believe that happened to my\n13 4 year old.\n14      Q.   Did you suffer racial trauma on any of the\n15 other two trips to Seaworld -- excuse me -- Sesame\n16 Place?\n17      A.   Not that I can recall.\n18      Q.   If you could, look at the amended\n19 complaint, which is Exhibit 3, paragraph 111 on page\n20 18.  There's a statement in the middle of the\n21 paragraph.  I'll read it for the record and ask you\n22 some questions about it.\n23                It starts out, \"The plaintiffs, like\n24 all class members, have been damaged by Seaworld's\nJA519\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 520 of 1384\nPage 61\n1 misconduct.\"\n2                Do you see where I am?\n3      A.   Yes.\n4      Q.   \"In that they have incurred damages to\n5 their enumerated civil rights, have and/or will\n6 incur economic damages, and have or will incur\n7 non-economic damages, including but not limited to.\"\n8 And then it lists a number of things.\n9                I want to ask you questions about\n10 this itemized list here.\n11                Would you say, Ms. Valette, you\n12 suffered humiliation?\n13      A.   Not necessarily, no.\n14      Q.   Have you suffered embarrassment?\n15      A.   I think so.\n16      Q.   Why do you say that?\n17      A.   Seeing my kid jumping up and down trying\n18 to get attention from somebody and they're ignored\n19 in front -- in front of another parent, in front of\n20 another kid, in front of everybody that was there on\n21 Sesame Street for the parade.\n22      Q.   Have you suffered mental anguish?\n23      A.   Yeah.  I'm upset by it.\n24      Q.   Have you suffered psychological stress?\nJA520\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 521 of 1384\nPage 62\n1      A.   Yes.\n2      Q.   Have you suffered depression?\n3      A.   I don't know if it's depression, but I\n4 think just sadness.  I wouldn't go as far as saying\n5 depression, but.\n6      Q.   Have you suffered anxiety?\n7      A.   Yes.  Over the thought of having to\n8 protect my kid from racism, yes.\n9      Q.   Have you suffered loss of self-respect?\n10      A.   No.\n11      Q.   Have you suffered post-traumatic stress?\n12      A.   Yeah, yeah.\n13      Q.   Why?\n14      A.   Considering now, she's in school.  I have\n15 to let her go.  I can't watch her all of the time.\n16 I'm not going to be there to protect her from this\n17 all of the time.  So yes.\n18      Q.   Have you suffered damage to your physical\n19 health?\n20      A.   No.\n21      Q.   I take it there's no loss of life at\n22 issue --\n23      A.   No.\n24      Q.   -- is that correct?\nJA521\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 522 of 1384\nPage 63\n1      A.   No.\n2      Q.   Have you lost any professional\n3 opportunities?\n4      A.   No.\n5      Q.   Ms. Valette, have you sought any medical\n6 treatment for any of the conditions that you just\n7 testified to?\n8      A.   No.\n9      Q.   Have you sought any psychological\n10 treatment?\n11      A.   No.\n12      Q.   Have you sought any psychiatric treatment?\n13      A.   No.\n14      Q.   Have you sought any form of professional\n15 treatment?\n16      A.   No.\n17      Q.   As to the list of things we just went\n18 over, would -- has your daughter suffered any of\n19 these things?\n20      A.   Yeah.  I think she was embarrassed being\n21 out there jumping in front of a whole crowd of\n22 people trying to get somebody's attention and they\n23 ignore you.  I think she was definitely embarrassed.\n24 She was humiliated.  I think she was definitely\nJA522\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 523 of 1384\nPage 64\n1 depressed and sad in the video, if you saw her\n2 reaction.  Yes, yes.  I tried to minimize it as much\n3 as I can, but yes, she was definitely was affected\n4 by these things.\n5      Q.   Would you say that D.V. has experienced\n6 racial trauma?\n7      A.   Yes.\n8      Q.   And how do you -- what basis do you\n9 believe she actually understands racial trauma?\n10      A.   Like I said, I protect her as much as I\n11 can from it.  But she asked, specifically, after\n12 this happened, after the parade finished and she\n13 continued to not get attention, \"Why is nobody\n14 giving me a high five?  Why me?  Why is nobody\n15 giving me a high five?\"  That question alone shows\n16 that she sees something is different.  \"Why is\n17 everybody else getting a high five and I'm not?\"\n18      Q.   Excuse me if I've already asked this.\n19                What was your response to that\n20 question?\n21      A.   I tried to not -- I don't even think I\n22 gave her a straight answer, to be honest.  She's --\n23 like I said, she's 4.  I don't want to open her eye\n24 to the nastiness that could be this world.\nJA523\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 524 of 1384\nPage 65\n1      Q.   Have you sought any form of medical\n2 treatment for your daughter?\n3      A.   No.\n4      Q.   Any form of psychological treatment?\n5      A.   No.\n6      Q.   Any form of psychiatric treatment?\n7      A.   No.\n8      Q.   Any other type of professional counseling?\n9      A.   No.\n10      Q.   Whether you've sought it up until now for\n11 either yourself or your daughter, do you plan to\n12 seek any such treatment in the future?\n13      A.   Not at this time, no.\n14      Q.   Do you feel it's a possibility you will?\n15      A.   If it becomes necessary, but like I said,\n16 this is something that I dealt with throughout my\n17 life.  And I know that she'll have to deal with\n18 through hers.  It's just the climate of the world we\n19 live in.  I don't think it would be necessary, but\n20 who knows what's in store.\n21      Q.   But you don't have any current plans to\n22 seek treatment --\n23      A.   Exactly.\n24      Q.   Well, let me finish.\nJA524\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 525 of 1384\nPage 66\n1      A.   Sorry.\n2      Q.   You don't have any current plans to seek\n3 treatment for either yourself or your daughter?\n4      A.   Yes.\n5      Q.   If we could look back to paragraph 111 of\n6 the first amended complaint on page 118, there's a\n7 reference in here to -- in the same sentence that I\n8 read, that plaintiffs have or will incur economic\n9 damages or have or will incur non-economic damages.\n10                In other words, there's a reference\n11 to possibly future damages.\n12      A.   Mhm.\n13      Q.   Do you have any -- can you tell me what\n14 future damages you think you might suffer?\n15      A.   If we were to go back and it would happen\n16 again, then -- I mean, again, like I said, the\n17 tickets, whatever we spent on the trip.  If we were\n18 to go back and the same racism, the same treatment\n19 were to happen again, that would be future damages.\n20      Q.   But in terms -- do you anticipate any\n21 future damages based on the event that happened on\n22 June 20th, 2022?\n23      A.   No.\n24      Q.

My husband\n18 posted it, and I reposted it, and it was\n19 picked up by the social media handle\n20 Frobabies and from that the Zerlina Maxwell\n21 saw it, the producer Deja Sanderlin\n22 contacted us to appear and talk about our\n23 experience, and we reached out to customer\n24 service from Sesame Place on the 25th,\n25 nobody got in contact with us, and then we\nJA539\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 540 of 1384\nPage 18\n1                 L.

If I don't physically have them\n12 -- we do everything digitally, so it's\n13 online.\n14      Q.   But you have access to them in\n15 your online account?\n16      A.   Yes.\n17           MR. SIMPSON:  I'll show you what we've\n18      marked as Exhibit Lauren Willie Exhibit 3.\n19      And this is, for the record, plaintiff's\n20      answers to defendant's first set of\n21      interrogatories.\n22           (Whereupon, plaintiff's answers to\n23      defendant's first set of interrogatories was\n24      marked as Lauren Willie Exhibit 3 for\n25      Identification.)\nJA543\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 544 of 1384\nPage 25\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2      Q.   If you could take a minute to\n3 look at this document.  And my question to\n4 you, ma'am, is:  Do you recognize it?\n5      A.   No.\n6      Q.   If you look at the last page of\n7 the document that indicates that apparently\n8 a DocuSign by Lauren Willie, individually,\n9 and as next friend of L.W., a minor.  Do\n10 you recognize that as your DocuSign\n11 signature?\n12      A.   Which page you said?\n13      Q.   The very last one.\n14      A.   Yes.\n15      Q.   Okay.  Do you recognize that this\n16 is an affirmation under penalties of\n17 perjury, as to the truth of these answers?\n18      A.   Yes.  I'm sorry.  I hadn't seen\n19 it laid out like this.\n20      Q.   If we could look at the answer to\n21 Interrogatory No. 2, which is on page 2 --\n22 excuse me Interrogatory No. 1, which is on\n23 page 2.  There is an indication, if you\n24 look in paragraph C, it states \"Mrs. Willie\n25 purchased the 2019 silver season passes in\nJA544\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 545 of 1384\nPage 26\n1                 L.

Yes.\n8      Q.   They weren't renewed?\n9      A.   No.\n10      Q.   And when you paid for the gold\n11 season passes, was your credit card debited\n12 each month for the payments, or how did\n13 that work?\n14      A.   No it was a one time fee.\n15      Q.   So it was a lump sum payment?\n16      A.   Yes.\n17      Q.   As to the credit card that you\n18 used to buy the gold passes, has that --\n19 was that credit card used by anyone else at\n20 the time?\n21      A.   For which of the passes are you\n22 talking about, the gold one?\n23      Q.   The ones that you used to get\n24 into Sesame Place in July of 2022?\n25      A.   The card, no.\nJA545\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 546 of 1384\nPage 27\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2      Q.   You're the sole user?\n3      A.   I think so, yes, because I think\n4 I used my debit card, not the joint card\n5 that we have.\n6           MR. SIMPSON:  Counsel, we will request\n7      that Mrs. Willie produce the statement for\n8      that card because we think it's responsive\n9      to her document request.\n10      Q.   When you were on the website\n11 purchasing the season passes, when you were\n12 going through that process, do you recall\n13 any situation where you had to click, \"I\n14 agree\", in order to advance to the next\n15 page?\n16           MR.

Do you recall whether you had to\n21 click a box, \"I agree\", or anything similar\n22 in order to advance to the next page to\n23 completion the transaction?\n24           MR.

I don't remember.\n3      Q.   Did you have a chance to review\n4 everything that was presented to you on the\n5 website before you executed a transaction?\n6      A.   Everything being the purchase of\n7 the two season passes?\n8      Q.   Whatever was exhibited to you, do\n9 you feel like you had a chance to review it\n10 before you executed the transaction?\n11           MR. RUFF:  Objection.  That's a\n12      compound question.  Objection as to form.\n13      You can answer.\n14      A.   I saw that we were purchasing two\n15 gold season passes and that was that.  And\n16 that was what it showed that we were\n17 purchasing and then the fees, whatever else\n18 was affiliated with it.\n19      Q.   After this ticket purchase was\n20 made, was anything e-mailed to you by\n21 Sesame Place?\n22      A.   The receipt of the purchase.\n23      Q.   Did you retain that receipt?\n24      A.   Yes.\n25      Q.   Do you still have it?\nJA547\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 548 of 1384\nPage 29\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2      A.   Yes, I gave it to my lawyers.\n3           MR. SIMPSON:  Well, I think that may be\n4      something that was not produced, so if you\n5      could take a look, Mr. Ruff, we will request\n6      that you produce that.\n7      Q.   Did you print anything out in\n8 connection with the transaction?\n9      A.   No.\n10           MR. SIMPSON:  Showing you what we've\n11      marked as L.

Mrs. Willie, can you take a look\n16 at this document, and my question to you\n17 is:  Do you recognize this as a copy of the\n18 gold season pass that you used to gain\n19 access to Sesame Place on July 10th of\n20 2022?\n21      A.   Yes.  May I ask a question?\n22           MR. RUFF:  No.\n23           MR. SIMPSON:  If you want to take a\n24      break, that's fine.\n25           THE WITNESS:  No.\nJA548\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 549 of 1384\nPage 30\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2           MR. SIMPSON:  I'm showing you what\n3      we've marked as L. Willie Exhibit No. 5,\n4      which for the record is a document filed in\n5      this case in connection with the motion to\n6      dismiss on November 2nd, 2022, as ECF number\n7      29-3.\n8           MR. RUFF:  Objection.  This document is\n9      not a piece of the record of this case.\n10      It's a part of your motion.  She has no\n11      personal knowledge of this document, and so\n12      I'm objecting to you even showing this to\n13      her.\n14           MR. SIMPSON:  Well, it is in the record\n15      of the case.\n16           MR. RUFF:  It's in the record as an\n17      exhibit in your motion.  This is not a piece\n18      of evidence that pertains to any of the\n19      plaintiff.  Mrs. Willie has no personal\n20      knowledge of this document.  It assumes a\n21      fact that is not in evidence.\n22           MR. SIMPSON:  Well, I object to the\n23      speaking objection, since you've not\n24      prompted her.\n25           (Whereupon, terms and conditions was\nJA549\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 550 of 1384\nPage 31\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2      marked as Lauren Willie Exhibit 5 for\n3      Identification.)\n4      Q.   The question for the witness, and\n5 Mrs. Willie, I want you to look at page 4-7\n6 through 6-7, those three pages, which are\n7 entitled \"EZ PAY Terms and Conditions.\"  Do\n8 you see that?\n9      A.   Yes.\n10      Q.   Do you recognize this document?\n11           MR. RUFF:  Objection.  I'm going to\n12      have this continuing objection to all of\n13      this line of questions on this document.\n14      There is no foundation for the document.\n15      That's my objection.\n16      Q.   Do you recognize document Mrs. --\n17 do you recognize the EZ Pay terms and\n18 conditions, Mrs. Willie?\n19      A.   No.\n20      Q.   When you bought the season\n21 passes, Mrs. Willie -- well, if you want to\n22 read it, go ahead.\n23      A.   No. I'm listening.\n24      Q.   Well, you need -- I need your\n25 attention.\nJA550\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 551 of 1384\nPage 32\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2      A.   Sorry.\n3      Q.   So we are done with that\n4 document, you can put this aside.\n5       When you gained access to Sesame\n6 Place on July 10th, 2022, did you have to\n7 state or declare your race or ethnicity?\n8           MR. RUFF:  Objection to form, as it\n9      calls for legal conclusion.  You can answer.\n10      A.   No.\n11      Q.   When you bought the ticket that\n12 you gained or the season pass that you\n13 gained access to the park with, were you\n14 asked to declare your race or ethnicity?\n15           MR. RUFF:  Same objection.  You can\n16      answer.\n17      A.   No.\n18      Q.   All right, Mrs. Willie, turning\n19 your attention to the events on July 10th,\n20 2022.  Describe for the record in your own\n21 words what happened that you're suing Sea\n22 World about?\n23           MR. RUFF:  Objection as to form, as it\n24      calls for legal conclusion.  You can answer.\n25      A.   On July 10th, my husband and I\nJA551\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 552 of 1384\nPage 33\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2 along with -- my husband and I took our\n3 daughter L.W. to Sesame Place.  We went\n4 with my brother-in-law, Keith, my\n5 sister-in-law, Tina, my brother-in-law,\n6 Sammy, their son, C , my brother,\n7 Benjamin, his wife, Bri and their twins\n8 A  and B .  We all met -- we met\n9 the Brooklyn part of the family and drove\n10 down together and my brother lives in\n11 Washington D.C. and he drove up and met us\n12 with his kids.  We all went in and we were\n13 having a wonderful time.  It was almost\n14 time for my brother and the twins and his\n15 wife to head back because it takes longer\n16 for them to get back, then it does for us\n17 to get up here and L.W. saw the Rosita\n18 character, and because we are trying to\n19 raise her in a bilingual household, she was\n20 very excited to see the character and ran\n21 towards her and Rosita did not -- the\n22 character actor did not stop walking, did\n23 not acknowledge her presence, and the\n24 handler that was behind her didn't stop and\n25 say, hey, look there is a kid here, and\nJA552\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 553 of 1384\nPage 34\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2 she's trying to get your attention and then\n3 the Rosita character skipped off to a place\n4 about maybe 20, 30 feet away where a white\n5 child was standing and taking pictures with\n6 her parents and jumped in the picture and\n7 posed with the parents and the child, and I\n8 just remember what my daughter's face\n9 looked like.\n10       And so in that moment as parents we\n11 had a choice to make, do we react as we\n12 felt necessary and demand accountability in\n13 that moment and time and then possibly\n14 sully the whole day for my daughter or do\n15 we stuff it down and try to distract her so\n16 that she can still have a happy birthday,\n17 and as uncomfortable as it was, we chose\n18 the latter, because she was only turning\n19 four, and I don't know how much she can\n20 differentiate between the characters at the\n21 park and the characters on the show, and so\n22 if we told her, or if we reacted would be\n23 ruining something that she loves, because\n24 we wanted to take a stance in that moment\n25 or because we wanted to right the wrong\nJA553\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 554 of 1384\nPage 35\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2 right then, and so we tried to just push\n3 passed and distract her, but the feeling,\n4 the suffocating feeling that -- my child\n5 had to be subjected to something because\n6 she had her -- because she was who she was,\n7 and her skin was not right, and it's\n8 uncomfortable, to say the very least, it's\n9 angering.  It makes it hard, so we tried to\n10 pivot and take her to see something else\n11 that she would enjoy and do the best to\n12 salvage the day, so that it wouldn't weigh\n13 on her the way that it was weighing on us.\n14      Q.   At the time that this series of\n15 events that you described happened, did\n16 L.W. say anything to you about how she felt\n17 about it?\n18      A.   She said why didn't Rosita stop\n19 or something like that, and we were like\n20 oh, honey, she had to go, you know, they\n21 have to be at different places, you know,\n22 we made excuses for it.\n23      Q.   But what exactly did you tell\n24 her?\n25      A.   We said oh, honey, we will\nJA554\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 555 of 1384\nPage 36\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2 probably see her again, let's go on and\n3 find something else to do.  You know, we\n4 tried to just keep her spirits up, because\n5 we didn't want for the whole day to be\n6 waisted because of that.\n7      Q.   And is it the case that your\n8 husband Rodney Willie was present when this\n9 happened?\n10      A.   Yes, everyone was there.\n11      Q.   Did Rodney Willie say anything to\n12 you about how he felt about the experience?\n13      A.   We have that thing that couples\n14 often do where you can communicate without\n15 having to say much by just, you know, a few\n16 looks to each other and when we looked at\n17 each other, we had an entire conversation\n18 what are we about to do, are we going to\n19 say something about this, are we going to\n20 -- and then when L.W. was a little ahead of\n21 us, we started to talk about it and do I\n22 need to go over to customer service and say\n23 something and we were like, no, let's just\n24 continue with the day, and let's just keep\n25 going and try to make the best of it.\nJA555\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 556 of 1384\nPage 37\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2      Q.   So who was it that said do we\n3 need to go --\n4      A.   I asked if I should go to\n5 customer service.\n6      Q.   Let me ask the question.\n7      A.   Sorry.\n8      Q.   Who was it that said should we go\n9 to customer service?\n10      A.   That was me.\n11      Q.   And what was Mr. Willie's\n12 response to that?\n13      A.   He kind of shrugged it off and\n14 said, no, let's just keep going.\n15      Q.   So what time of day did this\n16 interaction take place, the best you can\n17 recall?\n18      A.   Somewhere between 3 and 5, 3 to\n19 5, yeah.\n20      Q.   After it happened, what did you\n21 do at that point, did you go home, what\n22 else did you do?\n23           MR. RUFF:  Objection to form.  That's a\n24      compound question.\n25      Q.   What did you do after this\nJA556\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 557 of 1384\nPage 38\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2 incident happened?\n3           MR. RUFF:  You can answer.\n4      A.   We continued to walk around the\n5 park and see if there was any rides for the\n6 kids to go on or activities they wanted to\n7 do.  I think we were waiting to see if one\n8 of the parades, well, not the parade but\n9 there is a performance in front of Sesame\n10 Place that happens at certain points in the\n11 day, and we were going to try to get to\n12 that, and so we were trying to fill the\n13 time before the next scheduled performance.\n14      Q.   And how would you say that this\n15 experience has effected you personally?\n16      A.   I'm angry, I'm sad.  It has made\n17 me question a lot of things.  I'm not a\n18 stranger to discrimination and\n19 micro-aggressions but my hope was always\n20 been in raising a black child in this\n21 country at this time that maybe she will be\n22 spared from some of the stuff that my\n23 husband and I endured or that our parents\n24 endured and to know that that's not the\n25 case is enraging and disheartening.  And to\nJA557\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 558 of 1384\nPage 39\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2 not be able to shield my child from\n3 something makes me feel helpless.  It makes\n4 me feel anxious, and it makes me feel like\n5 I'm having trouble breathing, and it makes\n6 me question a lot of other interactions.\n7 L.W. is the only black child in her class\n8 and so sometimes when her teacher says\n9 certain things, it makes me look at the\n10 situation probably a little more scrutiny\n11 then I would otherwise because I'm\n12 wondering is this something else that I\n13 need to shield her from, and is this\n14 something I need to bring up to the\n15 administration.  It makes me -- it's\n16 unfair, because it ripples into other\n17 places.  We were talking about maybe going\n18 to another amusement park, and I'm worried\n19 that, we are worried that if we take her\n20 somewhere else is she going to have a\n21 similar situation, are we going to be\n22 paying someone to embarrass and mistreat\n23 and leave our child out.  That's not\n24 something we should have to think about all\n25 the time.\nJA558\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 559 of 1384\nPage 40\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2       That's not something we should have\n3 to -- it's not something we should have to\n4 deal with.  She should be able to just go\n5 to the same places as her white classmates,\n6 and it not be an issue and she not be left\n7 out, so I'm probably going off too much.\n8      Q.   Well, the question was:  How has\n9 this effected you?\n10      A.   So I had open heart surgery in\n11 May of 2021 and so I'm very aware of\n12 feelings in my chest, because I'm always --\n13 my brother died in 2014 of a heart attack,\n14 my mother almost died in 2020 from the same\n15 condition, which is why I had the surgery\n16 in 2021, and so when anxiety like this\n17 comes up, it gets tight in my chest, and so\n18 now I'm not only worried about the\n19 discrimination, I'm worried that, oh my\n20 goodness, is something going to happen to\n21 me where I'm now going to fall down in\n22 front of my child, and so I have to work on\n23 anxiety a lot, because it's tight in my\n24 chest, what happens, and it scares me,\n25 because I don't want to subject her to that\nJA559\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 560 of 1384\nPage 41\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2 possibility, but it's a very real\n3 possibility.  I don't know.\n4      Q.   Have you seen a physician about\n5 the --\n6      A.   No.  I had surgery for it so they\n7 tell me that I have to stay calm which --\n8      Q.   Let me finish my question.  Have\n9 you seen a physician with respect to this\n10 experience insofar as it's effected your\n11 heart condition?\n12           MR. RUFF:  Objection as to compound\n13      question, as to the form.  You can answer.\n14      A.   No, not directly.  I've talked\n15 with my aortic surgeon about anxiety and\n16 I've asked him, is this a cause for concern\n17 and he's like well, you know, you don't\n18 want to put too much stain on yourself and\n19 you can still have a regular life but, you\n20 know, don't try to start, don't invite too\n21 much stress.\n22      Q.   But did you have that\n23 conversation with your doctor after July\n24 10th, 2022?\n25      A.   I have to see him every three to\nJA560\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 561 of 1384\nPage 42\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2 six months about as follow up, just to make\n3 sure that everything is as needed to be.  I\n4 didn't tell him about the situation that\n5 happened, but I just asked about if anxiety\n6 can compound the situation, and he said\n7 well, you know, you should try to stay as\n8 calm as possible, and you don't want your\n9 blood pressure to get up too much, because\n10 it's an artificial valve, it's not -- you\n11 know, you don't want to make it overwork\n12 because then you may have to -- you don't\n13 want to overwork it and you don't want to\n14 make yourself too anxious.\n15      Q.   Has your doctor prescribed any\n16 medication for you to take to handle your\n17 current situation?\n18           MR. RUFF:  Objection.  Assumes a fact\n19      that's not in evidence.  I'm objecting to\n20      the form.  You can answer.\n21      A.   Because mine was preventative as\n22 opposed to my mothers where her ascending\n23 aortic valve had actually ruptured, I\n24 wasn't on any blood pressure medication\n25 before.  I was only on some shortly after\nJA561\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 562 of 1384\nPage 43\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2 my surgery, but I haven't been on any\n3 medication since then.  It's just this\n4 where my anxiety manifests, and it's a\n5 tightness in my chest, and that's how it\n6 comes about.\n7      Q.   How would you say that the\n8 experience with Rosita not interacting with\n9 L.W. effected L.W., has effected L.W.?\n10           MR. RUFF:  Objection.  Calls for\n11      speculation and so I'm objecting to the\n12      form.\n13      Q.   What have you observed about\n14 L.W.'s behavior that you can attribute to\n15 her interactions or failure to interact\n16 with Rosita, the character on July 10,\n17 2022?\n18           MR. RUFF:  Objection to form.  It\n19      assumes a fact not in evidence.  You can\n20      answer the question.\n21      A.   She has been a lot more attentive\n22 to us filming her, because after it\n23 happened my brother-in-law had the video,\n24 and we were looking at it, and she wanted\n25 to know what we were talking about.  She\nJA562\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 563 of 1384\nPage 44\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2 made mention to me something about not\n3 wanting to wear her hair the way it was the\n4 day that it happened and ordinarily she\n5 always says because her hair is like mine\n6 and so she says that likes to wear her hair\n7 wild and free and a few times I've heard\n8 her say things like, well, I don't want to\n9 wear my hair like that anymore or -- then I\n10 think because we did pivot the way that we\n11 did that she felt it, but it didn't\n12 resonate the same way for her, as it did\n13 for us, because she hasn't had the\n14 experiences with discrimination that we\n15 have, so if we sat and talked about it more\n16 in that moment.  We talk about\n17 discrimination.  We talk about people being\n18 treated badly because of being different\n19 from others and she understands the concept\n20 but I don't think she -- I think she was\n21 upset when it initially happened, because\n22 she wasn't getting to speak to and see the\n23 character she wanted to see, but I think\n24 because, as parents, we try to redirect her\n25 and entertain that hope so that she came\nJA563\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 564 of 1384\nPage 45\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2 away from it or came away from it\n3 remembering but not internalizing it the\n4 same way that we did.  It's there, and she\n5 knows it happened, but I don't know that\n6 she can separate that there is a person\n7 inside the costume that did it, versus, it\n8 actually being Rosita and that was what --\n9 it's a layered thing to have to unpack with\n10 a child, because yes, you can talk about\n11 discrimination but it wasn't Rosita\n12 discriminating against you, it's somebody\n13 dressed as that, and then well, why does\n14 that person get to do that.\n15       Like I said, we pivoted, and we were\n16 talking about having a conversation with\n17 her about all of this, but being a small\n18 child, the danger is then does she go into\n19 school and tell everybody about this, and\n20 them does it become that she is disclosing\n21 things she shouldn't be talking about,\n22 because this is, you know, it's a very\n23 sticky situation, because you want to be\n24 completely honest with her about what\n25 happened but at the same time you want to\nJA564\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 565 of 1384\nPage 46\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2 protect her.\n3       So she know that Rosita didn't stop\n4 for her but she doesn't realize that it was\n5 a person inside the Rosita suit that was\n6 probably discriminating against her and\n7 that it wasn't Rosita.\n8      Q.   So just so the record is clear,\n9 Mrs. Willie, is it your belief that the\n10 employee of Sesame Place inside that suit\n11 did what they did -- let me strike that.\n12       Is it your belief that the employee\n13 inside that Rosita suit refused to interact\n14 with your daughter because your daughter is\n15 black?\n16      A.   Yes.\n17      Q.   Have you told your daughter that?\n18      A.   That?\n19      Q.   That the employee inside the suit\n20 refused to interact with her because L.W.\n21 is black?\n22      A.   No.\n23      Q.   Did anything else happen on\n24 July 10th, 2022, that you regard as\n25 discriminatory?\nJA565\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 566 of 1384\nPage 47\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2      A.   So later on that afternoon, we\n3 saw that Rosita was going to be at a\n4 meet-and-greet, certain locations in the\n5 park where the characters stand and greet\n6 children, and we got in line, and we were\n7 the last people on line.  When there was no\n8 one behind us and when we got to the front,\n9 the same handler that had been with Rosita\n10 before stepped in front of us, and said\n11 Rosita won't be seeing anybody -- the last\n12 family walked up to go take pictures and\n13 then she stepped in front of us and said\n14 Rosita won't be seeing anyone else today.\n15      Q.   And you say this was a\n16 meet-and-greet?\n17      A.   That's, I believe, that's what\n18 they call it where they have the characters\n19 stationed at different locations in the\n20 park and at scheduled times they'll tell\n21 you which characters are going to be where\n22 and so we saw, we thought to ourselves,\n23 okay, well, maybe what happened was an\n24 accident, and maybe it wasn't a deliberate\n25 slight, and so we got on line with the same\nJA566\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 567 of 1384\nPage 48\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2 character and the same handler and the\n3 family in front of us went and there was no\n4 one behind us, no one was coming over to\n5 the line, and the handler stepped in front\n6 of us between us and the family that was\n7 ahead of us and said Rosita will not be\n8 seeing anyone else today.\n9      Q.   So you were in line?\n10      A.   We were on line.\n11      Q.   What exactly did the handler, the\n12 person -- first of all, describe the person\n13 for me in terms of what race they were.\n14      A.   The person that was walking with\n15 Rosita was a white woman, a white girl.\n16 I'm not sure her age.  She was a late\n17 adolescent, early 20's probably, blonde\n18 hair, she had on a yellow Sesame Place\n19 shirt, and I think the shorts they wear are\n20 green.\n21      Q.   And this is the same person that\n22 was accompanying the Rosita character when\n23 the Rosita character walked passed your\n24 child?\n25      A.   Yes.\nJA567\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 568 of 1384\nPage 49\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2      Q.   How long after the walking passed\n3 your child incident, did this\n4 meet-and-greet incident take place?\n5      A.   Maybe about an hour or so.\n6      Q.   And where exactly in the park was\n7 it?\n8      A.   This was by the main, when you\n9 first walk in there is a big circular, like\n10 a town square kind of circle space where\n11 they have bushes cut in the shapes of the\n12 different Sesame Street characters, and it\n13 was -- the main entrance is on the other\n14 side, this was like maybe at about 9:00\n15 from the main entrance.\n16      Q.   And when you say that there is a\n17 schedule for meet-and-greets, where was\n18 that schedule located?\n19      A.   They posted the Sesame Street app\n20 -- Sesame Place app, excuse me, has the\n21 schedule for each day, that they put out on\n22 the app, so that you can see where\n23 different events are going to be taking\n24 place.\n25      Q.   And that's how you actually\nJA568\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 569 of 1384\nPage 50\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2 figured out where to go to have a\n3 meet-and-greet with Rosita; is that\n4 correct?\n5      A.   Yes.\n6      Q.   What exactly did this person\n7 accompanying Rosita say when she cut the\n8 line off?\n9           MR. RUFF:  Objection.  I believe this\n10      question has been answered.\n11      Q.   Tell me exactly what she said.\n12           MR. RUFF:  Objection to form.  This is\n13      asked and answered.  She can answer.\n14      A.   Rosita won't be seeing anyone\n15 else today.\n16      Q.   And do you doubt the truthfulness\n17 of that?\n18           MR. RUFF:  Objection, as to calls for\n19      speculation.\n20      Q.   Did you believe it or not believe\n21 it?\n22      A.   I did not believe it.  I felt\n23 that she had seen us before and we were a\n24 fairly large group, and they -- my child\n25 looked exactly the same as she did when\nJA569\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 570 of 1384\nPage 51\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2 they walked passed her, and there was no\n3 one else -- if there were like five other\n4 families I could understand maybe doing\n5 that because I do know that they have a\n6 schedule that they have to keep but it was\n7 just us.  That was it.  There was no reason\n8 to do that a second time to my child.\n9      Q.   Is it your belied that your\n10 exclusion from the Rosita meet-and-greet\n11 line was based on the fact that you're\n12 black?\n13      A.   Yes.\n14      Q.   And based on the fact that your\n15 daughter is black?\n16      A.   Yes.\n17      Q.   Was there anything else that\n18 happened that day that you regard as\n19 discriminatory?\n20           MR. RUFF:  Objection as to form, as it\n21      calls for legal conclusion.  Can you answer\n22      the question.\n23      Q.   Let me ask you this, before you\n24 answer that.  What is your understanding of\n25 the word discrimination?\nJA570\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 571 of 1384\nPage 52\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2           MR. RUFF:  Objection to form, as it\n3      calls for legal conclusion.  You can answer\n4      the question.\n5      A.   Discrimination is to exclude or\n6 treat someone poorly based on actual or\n7 perceived race, ethnicity, gender, weight,\n8 age, any of the isms.\n9      Q.   So based on your understanding of\n10 the term discrimination, did anything else\n11 happen on July 10th, 2022, other than what\n12 we've already discussed that you regard as\n13 discrimination?\n14      A.   There was an incident that\n15 occurred at the Rosita cabana where the\n16 food -- we were purchasing food.  It was\n17 supposed to be something where you just\n18 grab and go, but there was nothing prepared\n19 and my husband ordered food for our group,\n20 and it seemed to us, as though other\n21 people's food orders were being made faster\n22 than ours was.  It took 30, maybe\n23 45 minutes.  Definitely 30 minutes for us\n24 to get quesadillas, which I mean, you just\n25 heat and go, and so it didn't seem logical\nJA571\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 572 of 1384\nPage 53\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2 and chips and salsa so it didn't seem to\n3 make sense, that we had four small kids\n4 under the age of seven, and we weren't\n5 getting our food, but other people seemed\n6 to be getting theirs.\n7       And at the time, we thought, okay,\n8 you know, what it's post-Covid, training is\n9 bad, maybe they just haven't -- you know,\n10 they are not used to all of this number of\n11 people coming to the park, but then when\n12 you put all of these things together, it\n13 starts to seem like it is pattern behavior.\n14      Q.   This incident with Rosita's\n15 cabana, when in relationship to Rosita\n16 walking passed your child did this happen?\n17      A.   That was before.  That was maybe\n18 around noon-ish.\n19      Q.   And the food being provided to\n20 other customers, what was the ethnicity of\n21 the other customers that were getting it\n22 ahead of you?\n23      A.   White presenting.\n24      Q.   And you believe that the slow\n25 service that your party experienced was\nJA572\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 573 of 1384\nPage 54\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2 because you're black?\n3      A.   Yes.\n4      Q.   Is there anything else that\n5 happened on July 10th, 2022, that you\n6 regard as discriminatory?\n7      A.   No.\n8      Q.   After the experience with Rosita\n9 not interacting with your child, did you\n10 discuss that with anyone, other than your\n11 lawyer?\n12      A.   On the way home we -- once -- I'm\n13 trying to remember if she fell asleep in\n14 the car.  My husband and I discussed it\n15 briefly, but on the 17th when we saw the\n16 other videos, we talked about it a little\n17 bit more, and then when we posted, then we\n18 posted our video on the 18th and people on\n19 social media started to comment then after\n20 we did the interview with Zerlina Maxwell\n21 show, people who hadn't seen the social\n22 media stuff reached out to us and were like\n23 oh my goodness, I'm so sorry to hear that\n24 that happened, that's so terrible, but\n25 in-depth discussions, no.  Just mostly\nJA573\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 574 of 1384\nPage 59\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2      Q.   It says the location of the\n3 attempted interaction was down from Oscar's\n4 crazy taxi ride close to Sesame Plaza and\n5 at a designated meet-and-greet for Rosita.\n6 Just so we are clear, this incident, when\n7 Rosita passed by your child, was at a\n8 designated meet-and-greet spot?\n9      A.   She was walking from the\n10 designated meet-and-greet spot.\n11      Q.   So she had already done her\n12 meet-and-greet and was finished with that\n13 and on her way back somewhere else, is that\n14 how it worked?\n15      A.   I'm not sure where she was going,\n16 but I know that she was on route somewhere.\n17      Q.   On route from the meet-and-greet\n18 or on her way to the meet-and-greet?\n19      A.   On her way from where the\n20 meet-and-greet was supposed to be\n21 scheduled.\n22      Q.   In paragraph E it says L.W. ran\n23 up to Rosita as she was walking by, Rosita\n24 waved minor L.W. off and ran over to take a\n25 photograph with a white child that was\nJA574\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 575 of 1384\nPage 60\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2 already taking a photograph in front of a\n3 backdrop.  You reference here to, \"white\n4 child\", what do you mean by white child?\n5      A.   She was not a child of color.\n6      Q.   Do you know what ethnicity this\n7 child was or is?\n8           MR. RUFF:  Objection.  That's asked and\n9      answered.  Objection.\n10      Q.   Was she possibly Hispanic with\n11 white skin?\n12           MR. RUFF:  Objection, as to the form,\n13      as that calls for speculation.  You're\n14      asking her to speculate.\n15      Q.   Do you know?\n16      A.   She was white presenting and her\n17 parents were white presenting.\n18      Q.   Other than what she looked like,\n19 do you have any claims for asserting that\n20 she is \"white\"?\n21      A.   No.\n22      Q.   Do you know this child?\n23      A.   No.\n24      Q.   Do you know this child's parents?\n25      A.   No.\nJA575\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 576 of 1384\nPage 62\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2      A.   No.\n3           MR. RUFF:  Objection to form, as it was\n4      asked and answered, but you can answer.\n5      A.   Sorry.  No, I did not.\n6      Q.   If we go further down into\n7 paragraph E, there is a reference to later\n8 that same afternoon that Rosita was at her\n9 designated place for meet-and-greets and\n10 L.W. tried to get in line to take\n11 photographs with Rosita.  The park employee\n12 that was accompanying Rosita throughout the\n13 park barred Mrs. Willie and L.W. from\n14 entering the line and told them that Rosita\n15 would not be seeing anyone else because she\n16 needed to get ready for the parade.  Do you\n17 see that?\n18      A.   Yes.\n19      Q.   Is it a fact that the handler\n20 told you that Rosita needed to get ready\n21 for the parade?\n22      A.   She said Rosita is not seeing\n23 anyone else today, that she's got to get\n24 ready for -- yes, she did say that she has\n25 to get ready for the parade, but the parade\nJA576\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 577 of 1384\nPage 63\n1                 L. WILLIE\n2 didn't start for another hour and 30\n3 minutes.\n4      Q.   Do you have any information about\n5 what this employee may have needed to do to\n6 get ready for the parade?\n7      A.   No.\n8      Q.   Did you go to the parade?\n9      A.   No.\n10      Q.   Do you know whether Rosita was in\n11 fact in the parade?\n12      A.   No.\n13      Q.   Just so the record is clear, with\n14 respect to this situation described in this\n15 answer, where you were excluded from the\n16 line, just physically, where did that\n17 happen in comparison to where the first\n18 Rosita incident happened?\n19      A.   It was the location she was\n20 walking away from, so that situation that I\n21 described earlier where it's the -- where I\n22 guess it's the double tundra.  I'm not\n23 sure, the circle where the bushes are, that\n24 looks like the characters.  That was one of\n25 the places for the meet-and-greets, so she\nJA577\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 578 of 1384\nPage 64\n1                    L. WILLIE\n2    was standing there and taking pictures.  We\n3    tried to get on line, and well, we were\n4    standing there and she stepped in front of\n5    us and told us she would not be seeing\n6    anyone else.\n7         Q.   To your knowledge, were any\n8    photographs taken of this second incident\n9    with Rosita when you were barred from the\n10    line?\n11         A.   No.\n12         Q.   To your knowledge, were there any\n13    videos of that incident?\n14         A.

WILLIE\n2    L.W., visited the park in August of 2019\n3    October 2020 and on 7/10/2022.  Do you see\n4    that statement?\n5         A.   Yes.\n6         Q.   Is there anything that occurred\n7    during the August of 2019 visit that you\n8    regard as discriminatory?\n9         A.   No.\n10         Q.   Is there anything that occurred\n11    in October 2020 that you regard as\n12    discriminatory?\n13         A.   No.\n14         Q.   These interrogatory answers were\n15    served on us in this case, as the record\n16    indicates, on December 20th, 2022.  From\n17    and after December 20, 2022, have you been\n18    back to Sesame Place Langhorne,\n19    Pennsylvania?\n20         A.   No.\n21         Q.   Since December 20th, 2022, has\n22    Sesame Place or Sea World done anything to\n23    you that you regard as discriminatory?\n24              MR.

WILLIE\n2         A.   No.\n3         Q.   If you could look at the answer\n4    again on Exhibit 3, Interrogatory No. 3,\n5    which is page 4.  This was a question that\n6    required into each incident in which you\n7    contend -- excuse me.  As to each instance\n8    in which you contended that Sesame Street\n9    costume characters refused to engage with\n10    you and asked you information about when\n11    you complained about this.  Do you see\n12    that?  And then it goes on on the next page\n13    on 5 to identify the person to whom you\n14    complained, describe the response you\n15    received, if any, and identify each person\n16    you provided with the response, et cetera.\n17          And in your answer here was\n18    Mrs. Willie called Sesame Place's customer\n19    service to complain.  Mrs. Willie was on\n20    the phone with customer service for about\n21    an hour and 30 minutes.  Following her\n22    phone call Mrs. Willie received a call back\n23    from Sesame Place's customer service to\n24    verify her e-mail.  Mrs. Willie never\n25    received a call back or e-mail response to\nJA580\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 581 of 1384\nPage 67\n1                    L.

Yes.\n7         Q.   How much of that time was spent\n8    being on hold?\n9         A.   I believe maybe about an hour.\n10         Q.   So you were actually on hold for\n11    an hour?\n12              MR. RUFF:  Objection.  Asked and\n13         answered.  You can answer.\n14         A.   I was on hold waiting for the\n15    person to pick up, so you're on hold while\n16    you wait for somebody in the queue to pick\n17    you up, right, and then you're on the phone\n18    with them and you speak and they put you on\n19    hold to speak to someone else, then they\n20    put you on hold again to speak to someone\n21    else so overall the whole hour and half\n22    phone call, I would say maybe about 45\n23    minutes to an hour was on hold, both the\n24    lead up to get the representative and then\n25    the intermittent holds after that.\nJA581\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 582 of 1384\nPage 68\n1                    L. WILLIE\n2         Q.   When exactly did this customer\n3    service call occur?\n4         A.   July 25th.\n5         Q.   And why are you certain about\n6    that, you had notes about it?\n7              MR. RUFF:  Objection, as to the\n8         compound nature of the question.\n9         Q.   Why are you certain about it?\n10              MR. RUFF:  You can answer.\n11         A.   Because I had the call back on\n12    the 25th as a voicemail from them.\n13         Q.   And when you actually got a human\n14    being and a chance to talk to them, what\n15    did you tell them?\n16         A.   I said that we were one of the\n17    families who had posted a video of our\n18    child on social media, and I'm sure that\n19    they are receiving a deluge of calls at\n20    this point, and what are they doing at this\n21    point to remedy the situation.\n22         Q.   Okay.  Did you get a response?\n23         A.   I was told I'm very sorry that\n24    happened to you, hold on, they came back\n25    and they apologized again and they said we\nJA582\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 583 of 1384\nPage 69\n1                    L. WILLIE\n2    are trying to see about extending your\n3    season passes for a year, and I said is\n4    that the extent of what you are going to\n5    do, and they said hold on, and then they\n6    came back and they said that they were\n7    talking with their supervisors, put me on\n8    hold a few more times and then they said\n9    somebody will be getting back to you\n10    shortly, and then they gave me -- because\n11    at first I spoke to one customer service,\n12    and then they escalated it up to -- I can't\n13    remember the name of what it was, client\n14    services.  I'm not sure exactly.  I don't\n15    want to misspeak, but they said that they\n16    would be e-mailing us something and then\n17    they called us back that day to make sure\n18    that they had the correct e-mail.  I called\n19    them back at the number they gave me to\n20    verify the e-mail and then we didn't hear\n21    anything else from them.\n22         Q.   Did any of these individuals\n23    identify themselves by name?\n24         A.   First name, but not anything\n25    beyond that, and I don't remember the\nJA583\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 584 of 1384\nPage 70\n1                    L. WILLIE\n2    names.\n3         Q.   You don't have any recollection\n4    of the first names?\n5         A.   No. But I think I still have the\n6    voicemail saved.  I would be able to look\n7    and see the name there.\n8         Q.   So do you recall what the\n9    voicemail actually said?\n10         A.   The voicemail said that it was\n11    whoever it was with Sesame Place customer\n12    service, whatever the correct term of who\n13    they escalated it to was and they wanted to\n14    verify the e-mail that I gave them and to\n15    please call them back, and they gave me the\n16    number.\n17         Q.   So you still have that voice\n18    mail?\n19         A.   I belive I do.\n20              MR. SIMPSON:  We will request that\n21         counsel produce that.\n22         Q.   Did you take any notes with\n23    respect to this call to the customer\n24    service number?\n25         A.   No.\nJA584\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 585 of 1384\nPage 71\n1                    L. WILLIE\n2         Q.   Do you have any other record\n3    other than the voicemail of what went on\n4    during this call?\n5         A.   No.\n6         Q.   Other than this customer service\n7    call that you've described, have you made\n8    any other complaints about the events of\n9    July 10, 2022?\n10         A.   On July 10th, I reached out to\n11    Sesame Place on their Twitter direct\n12    message to tell them about the poor service\n13    that we received at Rosita's restaurant or\n14    I believe I called it the cabana earlier.\n15    I'm not sure, something Spanish naming for\n16    her restaurant.  Maybe it was Rosita's\n17    Casita.  I can't remember what the name of\n18    it is.  But I reached out to them and\n19    explained to them that as season pass\n20    holders that we were supposed to receive\n21    discounts on food, we didn't get the\n22    discount, and that the food took an extra\n23    long time to come and I think they gave us\n24    $10 in Sesame Place bucks or something like\n25    that and they said, oh, well, no, season\nJA585\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 586 of 1384\nPage 72\n1                    L. WILLIE\n2    pass holders don't get discount on food and\n3    that it's just merchandise or something\n4    else.\n5         Q.   Do you still have that direct\n6    message?\n7         A.   Yes.\n8              MR. SIMPSON:  We would request that\n9         that be produced, counsel.\n10         Q.   Is it your belief that the\n11    failure to give you the discounts was based\n12    on your race?\n13              MR. RUFF:  Objection.  Assumes a fact\n14         that's not in evidence.  I'll object to the\n15         form.  You can answer the question.\n16         A.   I think that it's not explained\n17    to everyone working at the registers what\n18    the extent of the discounts people are\n19    supposed to receive are.  I'm almost\n20    certain that we are entitled to discounts,\n21    even if they are small for the food but\n22    definitely for purchasing items, and we did\n23    not get it at the Rosita restaurant.\n24         Q.   Did you ask for it -- did you\n25    point out the fact that you were gold\nJA586\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 587 of 1384\nPage 77\n1                    L.

Let's run this again, Video No.\n11    1.\n12              (Video played.)\n13         Q.   Now, it sounds like as this\n14    incident occurred people were laughing.\n15    Did you hear that?\n16         A.   I heard my husband saying oh,\n17    it's Rosita, and I heard my daughter\n18    yelling Rosita.  I did not hear laughter.\n19         Q.   You didn't hear any laughter?\n20         A.   I heard my brother-in-law saying\n21    it's racial.\n22         Q.   So Keith Middleton said that's\n23    racial?\n24         A.   Yes.\n25         Q.

Do you recognize this document,\n12    Mrs. Willie?\n13         A.   Yes.\n14         Q.   And I assume this is a\n15    photograph; is that correct?\n16         A.   Yes.\n17         Q.   Do you know who took this\n18    photograph?\n19         A.   Either my husband or myself.\n20    It's not me because I'm in the photo, so my\n21    husband must have taken it.\n22         Q.   And this is a photograph of that\n23    same Rosita interaction that we just saw on\n24    the videotape, correct?\n25         A.   Yes.\nJA588\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 589 of 1384\nPage 80\n1                    L. WILLIE\n2    to engage with her?\n3              MR. RUFF:  Objection as to the compound\n4         nature of the question, as to the form.\n5         Q.   Is it your testimony that the\n6    Sesame Place employee inside the Rosita\n7    suit actually saw your daughter?\n8         A.   From this photo you can see her\n9    looking directly at my child.\n10         Q.   What is your understanding as to\n11    what the character looks through in terms\n12    of their ability to see?\n13         A.   They have a mesh screen in the\n14    mouth to be able to see.\n15         Q.   Is it your testimony that the\n16    character saw your child and deliberately\n17    refused to interact with her because she is\n18    black?\n19         A.   Yes.\n20         Q.   If it's the case that the\n21    employee did not see your daughter and\n22    simply bypassed her, would that still be\n23    discrimination in your mind?\n24              MR.

There is someone walking with\n3    her, so even if by some chance costumes\n4    designed for people to work in a park with\n5    small children who are all around or a\n6    little bit bigger than my child could not\n7    see through the costume then the person who\n8    was walking with her certainly could and\n9    could have stopped her, so that she could\n10    have just waved to my child, acknowledged\n11    my child, something or any of the four\n12    children that were with us.\n13         Q.   Is it your understanding that --\n14    well, do you have any knowledge about the\n15    rules are that these employees have to\n16    follow when they are walking back and forth\n17    in the park?\n18              MR.

I don't know the rules of the\n23    employees in the park, but I do know that\n24    from the moment they are on stage to the\n25    moment they are not, they should be in\nJA590\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 591 of 1384\nPage 82\n1                    L. WILLIE\n2    character and the character Rosita would\n3    not ignore any children.\n4         Q.   If you could look at Exhibit 2,\n5    the class action complaint, and I direct\n6    your attention to page 16, paragraph 102\n7    and references made by the terms of the\n8    contract between the Willies and Sea World.\n9    Sea world's costume character performers\n10    were obligated to not to refuse to on the\n11    basis of race meet-and-greet with Sea World\n12    customers to include the Willies.  Insofar\n13    as the document makes reference to a\n14    contract, what is your understanding of\n15    what the terms of that contract are?\n16              MR.

We paid money to attend the park\n20    and to receive fair and equal treatment as\n21    white families, and we feel that we did not\n22    receive that.\n23         Q.   Is it your understanding that\n24    this contract that is referenced in the\n25    document obligates the employees to\nJA591\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 592 of 1384\nPage 84\n1                    L.

She didn't state it.\n7         Q.   I'll show you what we marked as\n8    Exhibit No. 9.  Mrs. Willie, I'll represent\n9    to you that this is a freeze frame of the\n10    last part of the video that we just played,\n11    Video No. 1, and do you recognize this as a\n12    representation of the point at which Rosita\n13    is being photographed with the other child?\n14         A.   Yes.\n15         Q.   And it's your testimony that this\n16    child is white?\n17         A.   Yes.\n18         Q.   Is it possible that this child is\n19    some ethnic minority?\n20              MR. RUFF:  Objection as to form.\n21         Argumentative.  You can answer.\n22         A.   This child doesn't present as an\n23    ethnic minority and so my assumption is\n24    what I said, that this child is a white\n25    child.\nJA592\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 593 of 1384\nPage 91\n1                    L.

So it is my understanding that\n4    when you copy a link that has a photograph\n5    in it, a website link that has a photograph\n6    in it, and you post it in the e-mail, that\n7    that immediately populates it in the e-mail\n8    so that is what -- you see because I have\n9    here is the link to my post.  That is the\n10    body of that post right there and then here\n11    is Rodney's post and it's the same thing.\n12    This, I believe, was and I don't know how\n13    they submitted it to you, but I don't know\n14    why it didn't do the same thing when they\n15    did it.  When I shared it with them, that\n16    is how it appeared in the e-mail that I\n17    sent them?\n18         Q.   So is it the case that Exhibit 15\n19    is an e-mail that you send to Denise\n20    Greeley with this material in it?\n21         A.   Yes.\n22              MR. SIMPSON:  Let me show you what\n23         we've marked as Exhibit 17.\n24              (Whereupon, Instagram posts were marked\n25         as Lauren Willie Exhibit 17 through 21 for\nJA594\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 595 of 1384\nPage 100\n1                    L. WILLIE\n2         Identification.)\n3         Q.   And I'll represent to you that\n4    this is what I got when I clicked on the\n5    link in Exhibit 16.  This appears to be a\n6    copy of your landing page closer to the\n7    July 17th, 2022 post; is that correct?\n8         A.   Yes.\n9         Q.   At the end of this particular\n10    post on the third page, it says at the\n11    bottom edited dash 31-W.  Was this edited\n12    in some way that you know of?\n13         A.   So I shared it and there is quite\n14    possibly, there was a typo in there or I\n15    didn't have something that I wanted it to\n16    have, so I went back in and edited the\n17    original post that 31W indicates that it\n18    was edited 31 weeks ago and from the screen\n19    shot that you have here, this was posted\n20    shortly after my husband's birthday which\n21    is February 6th so 31 weeks before that was\n22    when I edited the post.\n23         Q.   Do you recall what the editing\n24    was that you made?\n25         A.   No.  Knowing myself it was\nJA595\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 596 of 1384\nPage 101\n1                    L. WILLIE\n2    probably spelling.\n3         Q.   And I take it from the -- on the\n4    last page it says posted with regram LR\n5    Blitz.  What does that reference to regram?\n6         A.   So Regram is an app that you can\n7    put on your phone and therefore if you see\n8    a post that you would like to share on your\n9    Instagram page, you copy the link and then\n10    you go into Regram and then it reposts the\n11    post for you, so the body of the text\n12    that's after posted with regram is from\n13    Rodney's Instagram post, and so it put his\n14    video with his caption, and then I added my\n15    own caption above it, so the part that is\n16    before posted with Regram is my caption.\n17    The part that is after is his caption.\n18         Q.   So the text is, just so I'm\n19    clear, that comes posted with Regram-LR\n20    blitz, that's Rodney Willie's text, not\n21    yours?\n22         A.   That's his text beneath that,\n23    yes.\n24         Q.   LRblitzkrieg, that is his\n25    instagram handle, correct?\nJA596\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 597 of 1384\nPage 102\n1                    L. WILLIE\n2         A.   It is his Instagram and his\n3    twitter handle, yes.\n4         Q.   Okay.  On the second page\n5    opposite the cute cook, it says, \"one child\n6    could have been an accident, which is what\n7    we initially thought when it happened to\n8    L.W, on her birthday trip on 7-10.  There\n9    are now at least three other children who\n10    have been snubbed by the staff members in\n11    the Rosita costume.\"  So you make a\n12    reference here to it originally could have\n13    been an accident, right, that was your\n14    initial reaction, that this could have been\n15    accidental?\n16         A.   In 2023, as a black woman, you\n17    don't want to immediately assume that\n18    people are being racist towards you,\n19    towards your child, towards your spouse,\n20    but unfortunately that is often the case\n21    and one of the learned behaviors that black\n22    people have had to adapt is to weigh the\n23    options, always.  Could it have been this,\n24    could it have been that as opposed to\n25    taking the discrimination at face value,\nJA597\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 598 of 1384\nPage 103\n1                    L. WILLIE\n2    and in that moment, we were like, yeah, it\n3    stung, yeah, it was unfortunate, maybe it\n4    wasn't what we thought it is, maybe it was\n5    just an accident, maybe it was just, you\n6    know, she had to get somewhere, but then\n7    when you see that there is documentation of\n8    other children being treated the same way,\n9    then you realize that it's not, that you\n10    should have trusted your gut, you should\n11    have believed what you thought it was at\n12    first and not try to just keep pushing.\n13         Q.   Were these -- you make reference\n14    here to there are now at least three other\n15    children who have been snubbed, what do you\n16    make reference to there when you say three\n17    other children?\n18         A.   There were on the 17th was when\n19    the first family's video came out on social\n20    media and then another one came out later\n21    on that day.  The 17th was a Sunday and\n22    that family was the one that, I believe,\n23    Attorney Krump & company were representing\n24    and they were the ones doing the press\n25    conferences and stuff like that.  They were\nJA598\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 599 of 1384\nPage 104\n1                    L. WILLIE\n2    the first ones that came out and their\n3    video posted on the 17th, which was a\n4    Sunday.  Later that day we saw another\n5    video and then we woke up the next morning\n6    on the 18th and saw a third video, at which\n7    point we posted ours because so then we\n8    realized, okay, that we were right, to feel\n9    what we felt.  It wasn't accidental.  They\n10    were snubbing us.  They were discrimination\n11    against us.\n12         Q.   Were these other incidents all\n13    involving the Rosita character in Sesame\n14    Place?\n15         A.   I believe -- one of them was the\n16    Rosita character at the parade.  I think\n17    there was another one that was also a\n18    Rosita character, but if there was a third\n19    I can't remember now, because I've seen so\n20    many of these posts, that it's hard for me\n21    to remember which ones fell in which order.\n22    I just know that the first ones were the\n23    two girls standing at the parade and Rosita\n24    walks by, shakes her hand at them that\n25    she's not going to high five them and then\nJA599\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 600 of 1384\nPage 105\n1                    L. WILLIE\n2    high fives people on either side of them.\n3              MR. SIMPSON:  I'd like to play video\n4         No. 5 to see if this is the video that you\n5         just made reference to so if we could play\n6         Willie Video No. 5.\n7              (Video played.)\n8         A.   That's the one.\n9         Q.   In addition to that one, you're\n10    saying that there were other Rosita\n11    incidents also posted online in addition to\n12    that?\n13         A.   I believe there was another one\n14    after that, yes.\n15         Q.   And these were posted on\n16    Instagram?\n17         A.   Yes.\n18         Q.   Do you know whose platform they\n19    were posted on on Instagram?\n20         A.   At this point it's hard to\n21    remember which one I saw first.  I know\n22    frobabies posted several of them.  I\n23    believe the shade room posted some, BET may\n24    have posted a couple of them.  It's hard to\n25    differentiate now, because there have been\nJA600\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 601 of 1384\nPage 108\n1                    L. WILLIE\n2    think it's him, but it might have been me.\n3    No, it's him because at the top it says\n4    lr_blitzkrieg and ourhouse so that means he\n5    shared the post on both of his accounts, on\n6    his account and that account so this is\n7    his.\n8         Q.   It states in here the company\n9    that runs the park needs to train the staff\n10    better and their customer service needs to\n11    be more responsive when these reports come\n12    in.  Do you agree with that?\n13         A.   Yes.\n14              MR. SIMPSON:  I'll show you what we've\n15         marked as Exhibit 19.  Off the record.\n16              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are going off the\n17         record the time is 11:49.\n18              (Whereupon, an off the-record\n19         discussion was held.)\n20              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are back on the\n21         record and the time is 11:56.\n22         Q.   Mrs. Willie, I've showed you what\n23    we've marked as Exhibit 19.  Do you\n24    recognize that as July 18th, 2022 post by\n25    the entry called frobabies on Instagram?\nJA601\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 602 of 1384\nPage 114\n1                    L. WILLIE\n2    inclusive, equitable and entertaining\n3    experience to our guests.\"\n4          Do you have any information of the\n5    training, if any, that Sesame Place\n6    conducted for its employees?\n7         A.   Since this happened?\n8         Q.   Yes.\n9         A.   No.\n10              MR. RUFF:  Objection.  You can answer.\n11         A.   No. I don't.\n12         Q.   Do you have any information about\n13    what training was conducted before this\n14    incident occurred?\n15         A.   No, I do not.\n16         Q.   Have you made a return trip to\n17    Sesame Place to see if any of the training\n18    discussed in Exhibit 21 has had an effect?\n19         A.   No, I have not.\n20         Q.

So Mrs. Willie, is it fair to say\n24    that your view that if the employee is true\n25    to the character, in terms of in this\nJA602\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 603 of 1384\nPage 115\n1                    L. WILLIE\n2    instance, Rosita, and stays true to that\n3    character, that none of these snubs would\n4    have happened; is that correct?\n5              MR. RUFF:  Objection as to form, calls\n6         for speculation.  You can answer the\n7         question.\n8         A.   From my knowledge of Sesame\n9    Street and the characters of Sesame Street,\n10    they don't promote discrimination or any\n11    other kind of mistreatment of anyone else.\n12    The park even has an autism certified park\n13    to make sure that children with autism\n14    spectrum disorder have a place that they\n15    can go to unpack, to do whatever else, so\n16    for a character to treat children's badly\n17    based on their race or their perceived race\n18    is not in alignment with what the views of\n19    Sesame Street, the characters that they are\n20    licensing should be.\n21         Q.   But it's fair based on your\n22    understanding of the Rosita character that\n23    Rosita is not a racist character, correct?\n24              MR. RUFF:  Objection as to form.  Calls\n25         for legal conclusion.  You can answer.\nJA603\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 604 of 1384\nPage 116\n1                    L. WILLIE\n2         A.   Rosita's character has had story\n3    arcs in which she deals with being afraid\n4    of discriminated against because of her\n5    father's citizenship status, so no, the\n6    character is not racist.  The character\n7    should be one of inclusivity and should be\n8    one that embraces children of all colors,\n9    creeds and anything else.  It shouldn't be\n10    a character that somebody would associate\n11    with racism.\n12         Q.   And if the employee portraying\n13    the character is faithful to the\n14    character's characteristics, then there\n15    wouldn't be any reason that there would be\n16    any discriminatory conduct, would there?\n17              MR. RUFF:  Objection as to form.  Calls\n18         for legal speculation.\n19         A.   If the character behaved as\n20    Rosita, then no, there wouldn't be any\n21    cause for any of this.\n22         Q.   Mrs. Willie, if we can go back to\n23    your interrogatory answers, which is\n24    Exhibit 3, and now I'll direct your\n25    attention to page 5, Interrogatory No. 4,\nJA604\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 605 of 1384\nPage 120\n1                    L.

Do you want to take a break or?\n9         A.   I'm fine.\n10         Q.   Would you say that based on what\n11    you've observed and the way you've\n12    described it that L.W. has experienced\n13    racial trauma?\n14         A.   I think she has, but I don't know\n15    that she can articulate it yet.  I mean,\n16    she's only four.  Well, she'll tell you\n17    she's four and a half now, but I'm sure of\n18    it, and when she's older she may call back\n19    to it because it's in public domain, she'll\n20    find it, and she'll ask us if we did\n21    everything we could.\n22         Q.   Well, what else do you think you\n23    could have did at the time that you didn't\n24    do?\n25         A.   I don't know, start screaming, go\nJA605\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 606 of 1384\nPage 121\n1                    L. WILLIE\n2    and demand and speak to customer service\n3    and hold the person accountable in that\n4    instance.  I don't know but I hadn't\n5    thought about that until just now that she\n6    will see all of this when she gets older.\n7    She's going to know about all of this so it\n8    doesn't matter if I try to protect her\n9    then, because she will see this later on.\n10    I literally just realized that.  I don't\n11    know how that escaped me all of this time.\n12          So whether she feels it now, she will\n13    feel it.  She feels something now and she\n14    will feel it more later on when she is\n15    older and I don't know what that -- how\n16    that's going to effect her.  I don't know\n17    if she's going to ask us well, why did you\n18    keep letting me watch that show if this is\n19    how they treat -- I don't know if she'll be\n20    able to make that distinction, when she is\n21    older.  I know she can't make the\n22    distinction now but -- we just wanted to go\n23    celebrate the birthday with the characters\n24    that she likes.  I didn't know this was\n25    going to happen.

I don't\n3    think anybody would, and it's not right.\n4    She should have been treated the same way.\n5    Rosita should have skipped up to her the\n6    same way she did that other little girl or\n7    at least given her a high five or\n8    something.  It's not right.\n9         Q.   Would you like to take a break,\n10    ma'am?\n11         A.   No. No.  It's not going to go\n12    away.  It's still going to be there.  We\n13    can go on.\n14         Q.   If we could go back to\n15    Interrogatory No. 5 on page 5.  The\n16    question listed a number of things asking\n17    you whether you've suffered them and I'd\n18    like to go over them, if you can do it at\n19    this point.  I think you've already\n20    mentioned humiliation and embarrassment.\n21    Do you thing you suffered mental anguish?\n22         A.   Absolutely yes.\n23         Q.

Have you suffered loss of\n7    self-respect?\n8         A.

Every loss or every grief brings\n15    up other ones, right, so we are raising a\n16    little black child in the post George\n17    Floyd, post Breonna Taylor world, where\n18    during Covid everyday my husband had to go\n19    to work.  I was able to work remotely but\n20    he had to go to work and everyday I worried\n21    that he was going to fit a description and\n22    not be able to come home, and so in that\n23    moment, in that exchange, that we had\n24    without saying a word, I looked at him and\n25    part of what I was saying to him was please\nJA608\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 609 of 1384\nPage 124\n1                    L.

That was it.\n16    And it shouldn't make us feel like this.\n17    It shouldn't be like this.  We shouldn't be\n18    feeling the same way that our parents felt\n19    when they were growing up.  We are supposed\n20    to be growing up in this world where\n21    everybody is the same color, whatever\n22    people say, and it's not true, not for\n23    black folks it's not.

Mrs. Willie, you testified\n22    earlier about a second attempt to interact\n23    with the Rosita character at your July 10th\n24    visit to Sesame Place.  Do you remember the\n25    ethnicity of the other folks that were in\nJA611\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 612 of 1384\nPage 132\n1                    L.

Did you recognize the ethnicity\n6    of any of the other folks that were in the\n7    line ahead of you?\n8         A.   No.\n9         Q.   You testified earlier that you\n10    have not been back to visit Sesame Place in\n11    Langhorne, that's the correct name of the\n12    town, right?\n13              MR. SIMPSON:  Correct.\n14         Q.   Would you ever visit Sesame Place\n15    in the future?\n16         A.   Provided that they do the things\n17    that they said they were going to do in the\n18    second statement and give us some sort of\n19    assurance that that happened, then yes.\n20         Q.   Just to explore that, give me one\n21    second.  Just to be clear, we are talking\n22    about Exhibit No. 21.  It's your testimony\n23    that if Sesame Place conducted training for\n24    their employees and they better understood\n25    and recognized and delivered an inclusive\nJA612\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 613 of 1384\nPage 133\n1                    L.

Yes.\n7              MR. SIMPSON:  I don't think it was\n8         clear and object to the form and she needs\n9         to answer.\n10              MR. RUFF:  Well, let me try and\n11         rephrase it.  What's your objection to the\n12         question?\n13              MR. SIMPSON:  Compound.\n14         Q.   Your testimony is that if Sesame\n15    Place conducts training -- well, let me ask\n16    you in a different way.  What would it take\n17    for you to be convinced that Sesame Place\n18    had implemented enough changes for you to\n19    revisit the park?\n20         A.   I would hope that they would\n21    notify the families that are listed in the\n22    group and let us know what had happened in\n23    terms of the trainings that they have done,\n24    and I guess invite us to come back to see\n25    that they had done the things they said\nJA613\n\nCase 2:22-cv-02941-WB   Document 108-4   Filed 12/18/23   Page 614 of 1384\nPage 134\n1                    L.

On page 1, I direct your attention to\n6    letter A under the introductory paragraph.\n7    Could you read that for me?\n8         A.   The information provided in these\n9    answered is not based solely on the\n10    knowledge of the executing parties, but\n11    includes knowledge of the parties agents,\n12    representatives and attorney's unless\n13    privileged.\n14         Q.   So is it your -- was that, this\n15    phrase, that's in this interrogatory, WAS\n16    that your understanding of the way these\n17    answers were produced?\n18              MR.

WILLIE\n2         Q.   How do you know that?\n3         A.   Because she will tell you in a\n4    heartbeat that she is a black girl, and she\n5    is very proud of that.\n6         Q.   How do you know that she is proud\n7    of it?\n8         A.   Because she will say it.\n9         Q.   Were you able to see -- you\n10    testified earlier about the first instance\n11    where Rosita walked passed your daughter\n12    and ignored her, and I'm trying to identify\n13    the video, I think it was Willie Video No.\n14    1, were you able to see your daughter's\n15    face after Rosita ignored her?\n16         A.   Yes.\n17         Q.   What was your reaction to her?\n18    Did you see her react in any way?\n19         A.   She was shocked.  She was sad.\n20         Q.   How did you know that?\n21         A.   Because I made her.  I know my\n22    baby's faces.  She didn't look happy.  She\n23    looked like she was confused and didn't\n24    understand.\n25         Q.   What was -- sorry.

She just loves the character and\n4    didn't understand why the character\n5    wouldn't love her the same way.\n6         Q.   What was -- did you have any\n7    reaction to seeing her reaction?\n8         A.   It's heartbreaking, you know, you\n9    see your kid's disappointed and when you\n10    tell them no you can't do this or something\n11    else, but there is usually a reason behind\n12    why you're telling your child not to do\n13    that and they eventually understand those,\n14    but this one, there is no reason, other\n15    than ignorance, and how do you make that\n16    fathomable to a little kid.\n17         Q.   You just testified that viewing\n18    your daughter in that moment was\n19    heartbreaking.  Had you ever experienced\n20    that same emotion prior to this incident?\n21         A.   With L.W.?\n22         Q.
