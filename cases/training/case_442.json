    "summary": "<p>On May 1, 1984, the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division informed the Governor of Connecticut that it would investigate the living conditions at Southbury Training School, an institutional care facility for people with intellectual disabilities (ICF/MR) in Southbury, Connecticut, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1997 et seq. On September 11, 1985, the Department of Justice announced its findings. Three lawsuits, including this CRIPA lawsuit, followed. A class action, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=440\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Messier v. Southbury Training School</a>, in this Clearinghouse, appears to have been treated as a companion case at some points during litigation. Another private action, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=5464\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McCoy v. Belmont</a>, appears to have been separately litigated. Judge Ellen B. Burns of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut adjudicated all or part of these three lawsuits.</p>\r\n<p>The United States filed this lawsuit against the State of Connecticut, its Department of Mental Retardation, and the Director of Southbury on July 25, 1986. The United States alleged that living conditions at Southbury placed residents in grave danger of bodily harm and death. According to the Complaint, the individuals with developmental disabilities placed at Southbury were subject to systematic abuse and neglect. Southbury did not provide adequate medical and psychological care and employed too few medical and direct care staff. In addition, Southbury's facilities were unsafe and unsanitary. Instead of offering residents individualized habilitative programming, Southbury used physical and chemical restraints to control most residents' behavior.</p>\r\n<p>On July 25, 1986, the parties also entered a consent decree, under which the State admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to dramatically change Southbury's operations. For instance, the State agreed to institute individualized habilitation programming for all residents and to only use chemical and physical restraints in emergencies or when medically or therapeutically indicated. In addition, the State agreed to improve medical care by hiring more medical staff, developing a medical recordkeeping system, and improving the availability and overall quality of medical care and physical therapy. In addition, the state agreed to improve staff-to-resident ratios by either hiring and training more direct care staff or reducing the number of Southbury's residents (in 1986, Southbury had over one thousand residents). In addition, Southbury agreed to strategically address any new deficiencies or risks to residents' health or lives. Although the consent decree could only be enforced by those party to it, the defendants agreed to submit quarterly progress reports to the court. The court approved the consent decree on December 26, 1986, just four days after denying the Messier plaintiffs' petition for intervener status.</p>\r\n<p>Connecticut's compliance with the consent decree was rocky from the start. On July 28, 1987, the State petitioned the court to extend some of the consent decree's original deadlines because approval of the remedial plan was taking longer than expected. The court did not approve the remedial plan until July 22, 1988. On April 24, 1990, the court issued a remedial order directed to deficiencies in individualized planning, program staffing, medical treatment, and mental health care. Under the 1990 remedial order, Southbury's staff was required to monitor medicated residents for side effects, especially tardive dyskinesia. In addition, the court mandated monthly human rights reviews for residents with aggressive or self-injurious behaviors and for residents on psychotropic medications. Finally, the State was instructed to hire more physicians (general practitioners and specialists) and nurses to serve residents at Southbury. On December 1, 1991, the court modified the 1990 remedial order.</p>\r\n<p>Dissatisfied with the effects of the consent decree, Southbury's residents filed Messier v. Southbury Training School in 1994. On March 5, 1996, the court denied the Messier plaintiffs' motion to consolidate their lawsuit with United States v. Connecticut. The court, however, agreed that Southbury was still not providing adequate services to persons with developmental disabilities. On June 19, 1996, the court held the State in contempt of the consent decree, remedial plan, and remedial orders and appointed a Special Master (David Ferleger) to oversee compliance. United States v. Connecticut, 931 F. Supp. 974 (D. Conn. 1996), appeal dismissed, No. 96-6218, 1997 WL 321594 (2d Cir. June 13, 1997). The court was especially concerned by the rates and causes of mortality at Southbury. For instance, one resident died from severe burns after he lit his clothes on fire while smoking. The court noted that Southbury knew that the resident smoked unsafely, but neither taught him how to smoke safely nor observed him when he smoked.</p>\r\n<p>Between July 30, 1997, and February 22, 2006, the Special Master submitted twenty-six status reports, sixty-three topic-specific reports, and numerous other reports, recommendations, and analyses. Based on the docket, it appears that the Special Master addressed (1) individualized planning, (2) community placement policies, (3) abuse and neglect, (4) the rights of persons with disabilities, (5) human rights and behavioral programming reviews, (6) occupational and physical therapy, (7) medical and dental care, (8) dosage benchmarks, (9) physical restraint techniques and standards, (10) mortality investigations, (11) case management and advocacy, (12) quality assurance plans, (13) facility upkeep, safety, and sanitation, (14) transportation, (15) employment of direct care staff, medical professionals, and specialized therapists, and (16) staff development. The defendants contested most of the Special Master's reports, but the court ultimately accepted all of them. For instance, on February 22, 2004, the court accepted and adopted the Special Master's report on Southbury's development of mortality review procedures.</p>\r\n<p>It appears that the court began removing components of the consent decree from active judicial oversight in August 2000. On November 22, 2002, the Messier plaintiffs again requested intervener status, but the court denied their request on January 7, 2003. On June 24, 2004, the court similarly denied a motion by the Messier plaintiffs to file an amicus curiae brief about compliance with the consent decree.</p>\r\n<p>On June 20, 2005, the parties filed a revised joint settlement agreement, which would have released all outstanding elements of the consent decree from active judicial oversight. The court, however, refused to endorse the agreement on July 21, 2005. The court was apparently concerned about continued deficiencies in habilitation programming and medical care. On September 16, 2005, the State filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, but did not request that the district court proceedings be stayed. On January 17, 2006, the Special Master reported that the State had successfully implemented comprehensive habilitation programming for all persons served at Southbury. On February 26, 2006, the Special Master's medical consultant issued a similar report regarding the adequacy of medical care.</p>\r\n<p>On March 25, 2006, the court issued an order purging the defendants of contempt and concluding judicial oversight of the consent decree and remedial plan. The court, however, retained jurisdiction over the consent decree and remedial order for enforcement purposes. Between March 24 and June 25, 2006, the court declared all outstanding motions moot, finalized payment to the Special Master, and ordered the return of unused Special Master funds to the State. On June 25, 2006, Connecticut withdrew its joint settlement agreement appeal. Today, Southbury's website embraces the philosophy of community placement and acknowledges that future challenges will require Southbury to continue to grow and develop. On November 2, 2009, the Court granted a joint motion to dismiss the case because the parties agreed that the consent decree and remedial plan were fully implemented.</p>",

In  lieu  of  litigation,  the  United  States\nand  various  Connecticut  officials'  entered  into  a  Consent  Decree\nwhich  this  court  so  ordered  on  December  22,  198 6.\nThe  Consent  Decree  required  the  Defendants  to  submit  an\nImplementation  Plan  (the  \"Plan\")  addressing  the  procedure  they  would\nuse  to  implement  the  Consent  Decree's  mandates.  This  court  approved\nthe  Plan  on July  22,  1988.  Subsequent  to  entering  into  the  Consent\nDecree,  the  parties  agreed  to  two  additional  Court  Orders  on  April\n24,  1990  (the  \"1990  Court  Order\") and  December  9,  1991  (the  \"1991\nCourt  order\") ,  respectively.'\nIn  November,  1993,  attorneys  for  the  Civil  Rights  Division  of\nthe  DOJ,  along  with  various  experts,  examined  STS's  conditions.  The\nDOJ's  experts  included:  Dr.  Renec  C.

Liebertnan,\nConnecticut  Attorney  General.\n4  The court  will  refer  to  the  Consent  Decree,  Plan,  and two court  Orders\ncollectively  as  the  \"Remedial Orders.\"\n\nSENT  BY:US  ATTORNEY'S  OFFICE  :  6-20-96  :  17:14  STRIKE  FORCE OCDETF  - 202 514 6273:* 4/26\ncomplying with the Remedial Orders.  (See PI. Exs. 4, 8, and 22.)\nOn June 20, 1994, the Plaintiff sent the experts1 findings to\nthe Defendants, together with a letter alleging that the Defendants\nwere not in compliance with the Remedial Orders.  The Plaintiff also\nincluded a list of actions that the Defendants should take to remedy\nthe alleged violations.\nIn response,  the  Defendants  retained  a group  of  experts to\nexamine the Plaintiff's experts1 findings, and to make independent\nfindings and  suggestions.  The Defendants' experts  included: Dr.\nFred  Volkmar,  M.D.,  Professor  of  Child  Psychology  at  the  Vale\nUniversity  child  Study  Center;  Dr.  Henry  Schneiderman,  M.D.,\nF.A.C.P.;  Dr.  James  E.C.

After  the Defendants'\nexperts  concluded  their  examination,  counsel  for  the  respective\nparties  met  to discuss  a possible  resolution  of  the  Plaintiff's\ncontempt allegations.  The Plaintiff proposed two principle measures\ni\nto  remedy  the  Defendants'  alleged  contempt:  appointment  of a'\nSpecial Master to increase the level of monitoring of conditions at:\nSTS,  and a significant reduction of STS's population within three,\ni\nyears.  Despite extensive discussions, the parties failed to reach\nan agreement.\nSubsequently, the Plaintiff filed the instant application for\nan  order  to  show cause why the Defendants  should  not be held in\n\nSENT BY:US ATTORNEY'S OFFICE  : 6-20-96 : 17:15 :STRIKE FORCE OCDETF -  202 514 6273:* 5/26\ncontempt.  This court held four days of hearings on the Plaintiff's\napplication, during which the Plaintiff presented expert testimony\nregarding the Defendants' alleged noncompliance; and the Defendants\npresented testimony from several of its employees.\nII.  DISCUSSION\nA. LEGAL STANDARD\nCourts  have  the  inherent  power  to  hold  a  party  in  civil\ncontempt \"to enforce compliance with an order of the court, or to\ncompensate for losses or damages.\"  Powel I v. Ward. 643 F.2d 924,\n931 (2d Cir. 1981) (quoting McComb v. Jacksonville Paper Co   336\ntf\nU.S.  187, 191 (1949)).  Also, 18 U.S.C. § 401 gives federal courts\nthe \"power to punish by fine or imprisonment, at its discretion,\nsuch  contempt  of  its authority,  and  none  other,  as  .  .  . (3)\nDisobedience or resistance to its lawful writ, process, order, rule,\ndecree, or command.\"\nA  finding  of  contempt  is appropriate  when:  (1) the  court\norder's provisions are clear and unambiguous; (2) the moving party\nestablishes noncompliance by clear and convincing evidence; and (3)\nthe defendant has not exercised reasonable diligence in attempting\nto  comply.  International  Longshoremen's  Assn,  v.  Philadelphia\nMarina Trade Assn.   389 U.S. 64, 75-76  (1967); F.F.OC v. Local 63 8\nr\n753  F.2d  1172,  1178  (2d Cir.  1985),  aff'd  478  U.S.  421  (1986).\nFurthermore, because sanctions for civil contempt are remedial in\nnature,  a court  may  find  a party  in contempt,  irrespective of\n\nSENT BY:US ATTORNEY'S OFFICE  : 6-20-96 : 17:15 -STRIKE FORCE OCDETF 202 314 6273:* 6/26\nwhether  that, party  intended  to  comply  with  the  court's  order.\nv.

FINDINGS OF\" NONCOMPLIANCE\nAt the hearing, and in its papers, the Plaintiff alleged that\nthe Defendants were violating the Remedial Orders in three aras\nPsyrhological  services,  medical  services,  and  physical  therapy\nservices.  The court will address each of these areas in turn.\n1. Psychological Services\nPsychological  services  are  critical  to  the  residents'\ndevelopment  at  STS.  Tne  Remedial  orders  set  torth  in  detail\nnumerous requirements regarding STS's psychological eerviccc.  Among\nother things, STS is required to provide:\nTraining programs professionally designed to reduce or\neliminate unreasonable risks to personal safety or\nunreasonable use of restraints and developed by\nqualified professionals . . .\"'\n'  The Remedial Orders also mandate Lhc lullowiuy: Consent Decree S 1(2)\n(requiraa provision of rhar rtoijt-oo of care which ic cu£fici«nt to protoot all\nresidents from unreasonable risks to their personal satetv both by the conduct\nof staff, and of other rocidente); Consent Decree § I{4) (requires 3T3 to\nprescribe and administer behavior modilying medications pursuant- tn the\nexercise of professional juOyiu«nL); Cuuautit Decree 5 V(3) (requires STS to\nprovide a sufficient number of training program hours for each recident);\ncuneent Decree s V(3) irequires bxs to maintain adequate records): Consent\nDecree $ V(8) <requiroc that rcatrainto and behavior modifying medications\nnot bo used i.n lieu of training programs); I^I  Court nrttar S 1(A) (roqulroc\nAO72A\n(Rev.  8/82)\n\nSENT BY:US  ATTORNEY'S  OFFICE  : 6-20-96  :  17:16 STRIKE  FORCE OCDETF 202 314 6273:2 7/26\nConsent  Decree  5 1(1).  As shown  in  its  compliance  reports,  STS has\ndeveloped  an  overall  plan  ot  services  (\"OPS\")  for  its  residents,\nthereby  complying with  the  letter  of  the  Remedial  Orders.  However,\nGTG  fails  to  satisfy  the  spirit  of  Lhe  Remedial  orders,  as  Its\nimplementation  of  the  overall  plan  of  services  has not  yielded  the\nrequired  results.\nFor  example,  STS has  a. wriLLen  behavior  plan  for  most  of  its\nresidents,  which,  in  part,  requires  psychology  staff  members  to\nconduct  behavior  assessments  to  determine  the  possible  conditions\nthat  both  lead  to  and maintain  challenging  problem  behaviors.  Yet.\nSTS's  records  snow  that  assessments  ars  not  being  performed\nregularly,  and whon they  arc performed,  they  rarely  generate  useful\ninfvjtuictl-iyri  or  actions.  At the hearing,  and in his  report.  Dr. Alan\nUarrhik  explained  that  many of  the  behavior  assessments  he  reviewed\nwere  several  months  old,  and  identical  rewrites  of  previously\nconducted  analyses.  (Pi.  EX. 22 at  6.)  Further,  he noted  that  of\nthe  twpnty-one  cases  he reviewed,  there  was little  relation  between\nthe  analyses  and  the  treatment  procedures.  More  specifically,  he\ndescribed  several  cases  in  which  the  patients  were  «it.hp.r  not\nshowing  any progress  or  were  regressing,  but  no further  action was\ntaken.  (isL.)\n•STS'S behavior  plans  also  required  staff  me.mh*»rs to  implement\nan \"ignore  and redirect\"  procedure  when confronted  with  maladaptive\nmodification  of  training  plans  when necessary);  and  1990 Cnurf  Or<i<?r S\n(r«quiv«e,  when dpyiujjiiaie,  \"Ui« Interdisciplinary  Team,  ultnin  30 days  of\neach  review,  [to]  modify  the  existing  Overall  Plan  of  Service  of  auch  residents\nin  accordance  with  professional  judgment of qualified  professionals.').\nAO72A\n(Rev. a/82)\n\nSENT  BY:US  ATTORNEY'S  OFFICE  : 6-20-96  :  17:16  STRIKE  FORCE OCDETF - 202 514 6273:2 8/26\nbehavior.  Yet,  the  plane  did  not  specify  whether  the  behavior  or\nthe  resident,  should  be  iqnored,  what  the  resident  should  be\nredirected  to  do,  or  what-,  f.hp.  staff  should  do  if  tho  behavior\ncontinued  but  rectraint  wac  not  required.  Consequently,  \"staff\nmembers  always  paid  attention  to  residents  when  they  exhibited\nproblem  hehavior  by  making  statements  to  the  resident  about  the\nproblem  behavior  .  .  .  [but  failed]  to  redirect  them  Lo  something\nmore  appropriate  or  to  engage  in  an  alternative  behavior  or\nactivity.\"  (Tri.)\nA  September,  1904  report  on  the  death  of  Stanley  B.  shows\nclearly  STS's  delinquency  in  implementing  treatment  procedures  to\naddress  problems  discovered  during  behavior  assessments.

O'Neill, Dept. of Mental Retardation, Brian Lensink, Robert Griffith.\nRULING ON PLAINTIFF'S APPLICATION FOR AN ORDER TO SHOW\nCAUSE WHY DEFENDANTS SHOULD NOT BE HELD IN CIVIL\nCONTEMPT\nELLEN B. BURNS, Senior District Judge.\nThe Plaintiff United States of America has moved the court to declare the Defendant State of Connecticut officials\nin contempt of the Consent Decree dated December 22, 1986, and the Court Orders dated April 24, 1990 and\nDecember 9, 1991, respectively. For the reasons discussed below, the Plaintiff's motion is GRANTED.\nI. BACKGROUND\nOn May 1, 1984, the United States Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") notified Connecticut officials of the DOJ's\n[1]\nintention to investigate the living conditions at Southbury Training School (\"STS\"),  in accordance with the Civil\n[2]\nRights of Institutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 et seq.  On September 11, 1985, following\nits investigation, the Plaintiff brought an action against the State of Connecticut, its governor, the commissioner of\nthe Department of Mental Retardation (\"DMR\"), and the director of STS, pursuant to CRIPA. In lieu of litigation,\n[3]\nthe United States and various Connecticut officials  entered into a Consent Decree which this court so ordered\non December 22, 1986.\nThe Consent Decree required the Defendants to submit an Implementation Plan (the \"Plan\") addressing the\nprocedure they would use to implement the Consent Decree's mandates. This court approved the Plan on July\n22, 1988. Subsequent to entering into the Consent Decree, the parties agreed to two additional Court Orders on\n[4]\nApril 24, 1990 (the \"1990 Court Order\") and December 9, 1991 (the \"1991 Court Order\"), respectively.\nIn November, 1993, attorneys for the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ, along with various experts, examined\nSTS's conditions. The DOJ's experts included: Dr. Renee C. Wachtel, M.D., Director of Developmental Pediatrics,\nand Associate Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine; Dr. Alan E. Harchik,\nPh.D.; and Ms. Susan Harryman, Director of the Physical Therapy Department at the Kennedy Krieger Institute,\nand Instructor in the Department of Pediatrics at the John Hopkins University School of Medicine. All of the\nexperts' findings indicated that STS was not complying with the Remedial Orders. (See Pl.Exs. 4, 8, and 22.)\n\nOn June 20, 1994, the Plaintiff sent the experts' findings to the Defendants, together with a letter alleging that the\n976 Defendants were not in compliance with the Remedial Orders. The Plaintiff also included a list of *976 actions\nthat the Defendants should take to remedy the alleged violations.\nIn response, the Defendants retained a group of experts to examine the Plaintiff's experts' findings, and to make\nindependent findings and suggestions. The Defendants' experts included: Dr. Fred Volkmar, M.D., Professor of\nChild Psychology at the Yale University Child Study Center; Dr. Henry Schneiderman, M.D., F.A.C.P.; Dr. James\nE.C. Walker, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Emeritus, at the University of Connecticut; Ms. Rhea Sanford, R.N.,\nM.S.N., Clinical Nurse Specialist at the John Dempsey Hospital of the University of Connecticut Health Center;\nand Ms. Karen Green McGowan, R.N., Clinical Nurse Consultant. After the Defendants' experts concluded their\nexamination, counsel for the respective parties met to discuss a possible resolution of the Plaintiff's contempt\nallegations. The Plaintiff proposed two principle measures to remedy the Defendants' alleged contempt:\nappointment of a Special Master to increase the level of monitoring of conditions at STS, and a significant\nreduction of STS's population within three years. Despite extensive discussions, the parties failed to reach an\nagreement.\nSubsequently, the Plaintiff filed the instant application for an order to show cause why the Defendants should not\nbe held in contempt. This court held four days of hearings on the Plaintiff's application, during which the Plaintiff\npresented expert testimony regarding the Defendants' alleged noncompliance; and the Defendants presented\ntestimony from several of its employees.\nII. DISCUSSION\nA. LEGAL STANDARD\nCourts have the inherent power to hold a party in civil contempt \"to enforce compliance with an order of the court,\nor to compensate for losses or damages.\" Powell v. Ward, 643 F.2d 924, 931 (2d Cir.1981) (quoting McComb v.\nJacksonville Paper Co., 336 U.S. 187, 191, 69 S.Ct. 497, 499-500, 93 L.Ed. 599 (1949)). Also, 18 U.S.C. § 401\ngives federal courts the \"power to punish by fine or imprisonment, at its discretion, such contempt of its authority,\nand none other, as ... (3) Disobedience or resistance to its lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command.\"\nA finding of contempt is appropriate when: (1) the court order's provisions are clear and unambiguous; (2) the\nmoving party establishes noncompliance by clear and convincing evidence; and (3) the defendant has not\nexercised reasonable diligence in attempting to comply. International Longshoremen's Assn. v. Philadelphia\nMarine Trade Assn., 389 U.S. 64, 75-76, 88 S.Ct. 201, 207-08, 19 L.Ed.2d 236 (1967); EEOC v. Local 638, 753\nF.2d 1172, 1178 (2d Cir.1985),aff'd478 U.S. 421, 106 S.Ct. 3019, 92 L.Ed.2d 344 (1986). Furthermore, because\nsanctions for civil contempt are remedial in nature, a court may find a party in contempt, irrespective of whether\nthat party intended to comply with the court's order. McComb v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 336 U.S. at 191, 69 S.Ct.\nat 499-500; Manhattan Industries, Inc. v. Sweater Bee by Banff, Ltd., 885 F.2d 1, 5 (2d Cir.1989) (court declares\nthat \"sanctions for civil contempt can be imposed without a finding of wilfulness.\") (citations omitted).\nB. FINDINGS OF NONCOMPLIANCE\nAt the hearing, and in its papers, the Plaintiff alleged that the Defendants were violating the Remedial Orders in\nthree areas: Psychological services, medical services, and physical therapy services. The court will address each\nof these areas in turn.\n1. Psychological Services\nPsychological services are critical to the residents' development at STS. The Remedial Orders set forth in detail\nnumerous requirements regarding STS's psychological services. Among other things, STS is required to provide:\n\nTraining programs professionally designed to reduce or eliminate unreasonable risks to personal\n977 safety or unreasonable use of restraints and developed by qualified professionals ...[5]*977\nConsent Decree § I(1). As shown in its compliance reports, STS has developed an overall plan of\nservices (\"OPS\") for its residents, thereby complying with the letter of the Remedial Orders.\nHowever, STS fails to satisfy the spirit of the Remedial Orders, as its implementation of the overall\nplan of services has not yielded the required results.\nFor example, STS has a written behavior plan for most of its residents, which, in part, requires psychology staff\nmembers to conduct behavior assessments to determine the possible conditions that both lead to and maintain\nchallenging problem behaviors. Yet, STS's records show that assessments are not being performed regularly,\nand when they are performed, they rarely generate useful information or actions. At the hearing, and in his report,\nDr. Alan Harchik explained that many of the behavior assessments he reviewed were several months old, and\nidentical rewrites of previously conducted analyses. (Pl.Ex. 22 at 6.) Further, he noted that of the twenty-one\ncases he reviewed, there was little relation between the analyses and the treatment procedures. More\nspecifically, he described several cases in which the patients were either not showing any progress or were\nregressing, but no further action was taken. (Id.)\nSTS's behavior plans also required staff members to implement an \"ignore and redirect\" procedure when\nconfronted with maladaptive behavior. Yet, the plans did not specify whether the behavior or the resident should\nbe ignored, what the resident should be redirected to do, or what the staff should do if the behavior continued but\nrestraint was not required. Consequently, \"staff members always paid attention to residents when they exhibited\nproblem behavior by making statements to the resident about the problem behavior ... [but failed] to redirect them\nto something more appropriate or to engage in an alternative behavior or activity.\" (Id.)\nA September, 1994 report on the death of Stanley B. shows clearly STS's delinquency in implementing treatment\nprocedures to address problems discovered during behavior assessments. Stanley B. was one of STS's\napproximately twenty smoking residents. STS's staff was well aware that he was \"a `sloppy' and at times careless\n[6]\nsmoker who sometimes burned holes in his clothing.\"  However, Stanley B.'s 1993 OPS did not provide any\ninstruction to the staff regarding his smoking habits, or his need for supervision while smoking. (Pl.Ex. 12, Final\nInvestigation Report of Thomas Harmon at 9-10 [hereinafter \"Harmon Report\"].)\nIn 1989, STS staff developed an OPS for Stanley B. which established a goal to teach him to extinguish his pipe\n[7]\nin a safe manner.  To achieve that goal, he had to complete a series of smoking-related tasks, independently,\nduring eight consecutive training sessions. (Harmon Report at 11.) However, only two quarterly reports regarding\nthis goal were found, neither of which indicated that Stanley B. was progressing. Moreover, although a later\n978 report indicated a slight decrease in his *978 performance, STS staff did not take any action to address the\n[8]\nproblem.\nOn the morning of April 2, 1994, Stanley B.'s clothing caught on fire while he smoked his pipe. As a result, he\nsuffered burns to one-half of his body, and died later that evening.\n[9]\nThe Health Care Financing Administration's (the \"HCFA\")  October, 1994 survey also evinces STS's inability to\nimplement its programs effectively. In its report, the HCFA stated that its inspection indicated STS was not\nproviding continuous, aggressive, and active treatment programs. (Pl.Ex. 19, HCFA Cottage 34 Survey at 1.)\nFurthermore, HCFA noted that its survey was the fourth consecutive survey to yield such results. (Id.) HCFA then\n[10]\ndiscussed several instances in which pica programs  for several clients were either lacking, or not being\nimplemented as written at their day programs: (1) A staff interview indicated that Client # 07 ingested a piece of\nplastic at her day site (Pl.Ex. 19, HCFA Cottage 32 Survey at 5); (2) during a one-hour observation, Client # 09\nwas observed to ingest feathers from a duster, and lacked involvement in a routine (id.); (3) Client # 08 lacked the\nimplementation of the \"eye-gouging\" component of her behavior program (id. at 6); (4) Staff observed Client # 08\nstick her finger in her eye, but did not redirect her to remove it as indicated in her behavior program (id.); (5)\nobservation and documentation indicated that Client # 02's behavior program to reduce his self-injurious behavior\nof hitting his head with his hands was not implemented as written (Pl.Ex. 19, HCFA Cottage 34 Survey at 2); (6) a\nreview of Client # 06's behavior data since the implementation of his program designed to prevent incidents of\n\ningesting cigarette butts indicated that Client # 06 ingested cigarette butts at least seventy-eight times between\nJune 17, 1994 and January 1, 1995 (Pl.Ex. 19, HCFA 26 Colony Ct. Circle Survey at 2); (7) STS's failure to\nimplement its procedure to keep toxic substances out of reach of the client resulted in Client # 03 ingesting a\nwater and bleach mixture (Pl.Ex. 19, HCFA Cottage 22 Survey at 2); and (8) although Client # 02 fell three\nhundred and twenty-four times between January, 1994 and October, 1994, STS lacked programming to address\nthis behavior. (Pl.Ex. 19, HCFA Cottage 34 Survey at 2.)\nSTS has not only failed to protect its residents from injury to themselves, but has also failed to protect its\nresidents from unreasonable risk of injury by other residents. A cursory review of STS's accident report for the\nyear beginning September 1, 1993 reveals numerous incidents of residents' acts of aggression toward their\n[11]\npeers.  While the court acknowledges that a facility such as STS is not able to prevent every incident, the\ncourt notes that numerous incidents listed in STS's accident reports occurred on several occasions. (Pl.Ex. 20.)\n[12]\nThe court, however, finds that STS's accident reports are misleading, when viewed in isolation. When the court\n979 juxtaposes STS's reported and substantiated abuse and neglect allegations between 1992 and 1994 with those \n*979 of the other institutions in the DMR's six regions, the court finds STS's number to be the lowest. (See,\nDef.Exs. AB and AC.) Of course, such a comparison does not exonerate STS from its duty to minimize accidents.\nHowever, STS appeared to be combating the problem more effectively than any of the other institutions in the\nregion.\nAlthough positive reinforcement is one of the most effective, efficient, and nonaversive procedures available for\ndealing with such maladaptive behavior, it is not a standard part of STS's behavioral programs. Further, when\nSTS did include positive reinforcement in a behavior plan, attempts by the psychology and direct-care staff to\nimplement the procedure demonstrated a \"total lack of understanding of positive reinforcement.\" (Pl. Ex. 22 at 7.)\nFor example, the staff allowed one resident to perform preferred chores to reinforce appropriate behavior, and\ndirected him to do the same chores when he became agitated. In another case, a resident, who was restrained at\nleast once a day for exhibiting aggressive behavior, received his reinforcement snacks despite his disruptive\nconduct. Yet another resident's behavior plan called for reinforcement every five minutes, but the staff member\ndid not administer the procedure, reasoning that it does not work. \"By not applying the simplest, most basic\nprinciples of intervention and positive reinforcement, residents at STS are not receiving a suitable training\n[13]\nprogram.\"  (Pl.Ex. 22 at 7.)\nAnother flaw in STS's psychological services is its failure to keep its residents actively engaged. Dr. Harchik\n[14]\nperformed a study across eleven cottages to determine the number of residents engaged at any given time.\nHe found that the residents were \"almost never engaged.\" (Pl.Ex. 22 at 11.) In fact, the average percentage of\nresidents engaged across the eleven cottages was 31%, an extremely low average by professional standards.\n[15]\n Instead of engaging the residents in activities, staff members were observed watching TV, talking on the\ntelephone, talking to each other, and engaging in other miscellaneous activities. (Pl.Ex. 22 at 11-13.)\nSTS has failed to discover and address such systemic defects, because its staff does not execute STS's \"review\nand modify\" procedures regularly. Once again, STS is in compliance with the letter of the Remedial Orders, but\nfails to produce the results. As dictated by the Remedial Orders, STS procedural guidelines require that its staff\nhold regular monthly reviews of behavior treatments for those residents receiving medication, and that a doctoral-\nlevel psychology staff conduct monthly reviews of specific behavior plans (\"QA reviews\"). Also, an\ninterdisciplinary team is required to perform a quarterly review of all plan objectives. Furthermore, STS's Program\nReview Committee (the \"PRC\") is required to review those residents receiving behavior medications at least\nevery two years. (Pl.Ex. 22 at 9.) However, while at least half of the behavior programs he reviewed required\n[16]\nmodification,  the QA reviews performed prior to his report did not recommend modification of any existing\n[17]\nbehavior plans.  (Pl.Ex. 22 at 9.)\nFinally, the Defendants violate the Remedial Orders by administering behavioral medication in lieu of training\n980 programs. The Defendants' own expert found that STS administered psychotropic medications for behavior *980\nproblems when behavioral programs were more appropriate. Dr. Fred Volkmar found that:\n\nPsychiatric services at STS appeared to be entirely focused on issues of medication ...\nEssentially, there appear to be no psychiatric services other than those related to medications,\ne.g., no in-service training, no supervision, no psychotherapy, no consultation regarding\npsychiatric aspects of medical conditions, and so forth. Psychiatrists are not really active members\nof the treatment teams but rather are brought in as, in effect, outside consultants. The psychiatric\nconsultations are not well integrated with other aspects of the rehabilitation and medical program.\nThis has had the unintended effect of \"marginalizing\" psychiatry at STS with consequent\nimplications for the quality of service which is provided.\nReport of Dr. Fred R. Volkmar at 6 [hereinafter \"Volkmar Report\"].\nB. Medical Services\n[18]\nThe Remedial Orders require that STS provide adequate medical care to all of its residents.  Several of the\nexperts' reports and STS compliance reports reveal that STS has established a substantial number of medical\nprograms. However, clear and convincing evidence shows that the Defendants' medical services at times violate\nthe Remedial Orders' requirements, thereby placing residents in grave danger.\nPerhaps the most blatant example of STS's failure to provide adequate medical care is found in the various\n[19]\nreports on the death of John T.  In caring for John T., STS's medical staff made a series of severe errors which\npossibly contributed to his ultimate death. Among those errors were the following: (1) STS staff's management of\n[20]\ndiarrhea and severe malnutrition in June, 1992 was delayed and inadequate;  (2) John T.'s physician, one Dr.\nGuevarra, failed to diagnose his deteriorating condition in a timely or adequate manner, during the last ten days\n[21]\nof August, 1992;  (3) on the day of John T.'s death, STS staff failed to recognize that he had lapsed into\n[22]\nunconsciousness for several hours;  (4) Dr. Guevarra failed to question why John T. was receiving an\n[23]\nextraordinarily high dosage of Dilantin (three times as high as his normal dose);  (5) Dr. Guevarra failed to\n[24]\ncheck John T.'s blood to determine whether he was carrying a toxic level of Dilantin;  (6) Dr. Guevarra did not\n[25]\nprovide clearly defined orders regarding John T.'s medicine prescription;  (7) Dr. Guevarra prescribed a\n981 \"cocktail of medications\" without *981 regard to the detrimental effects of ordering multiple medications.[26]\nAs shown above, STS's care of John T. was plagued with appalling examples of insufficient medical care, and\nsuch systemic inadequacies might be sufficient alone to find the Defendants in contempt of the Remedial Orders.\nHowever, the court will discuss several additional examples below.\nSTS's maintenance of its active and inactive problem lists is inadequate. Active and inactive problem lists are a\ncrucial part of effective medical care. Report of Karen Green McGowan at 4 [hereinafter \"McGowan Report\"].\nProblem lists provide an accurate picture of a patient's current and past health history. (Id.) Furthermore, such\nlists are very useful to medical consultants, and when STS refers a patient to a new physician. (Id.) Conversely,\nproblem lists are utterly useless if they are not accurate. At STS, most of the patients that the experts observed\n[27]\nhad problem lists. However, the majority of the lists reviewed were either incomplete or inaccurate.\n(McGowan Report at 4.)\nSTS's recordkeeping procedures are also below professional standards, causing important medical information to\nbe obscured, and jeopardizing its residents' health. Ms. McGowan found that STS was attempting to maintain the\nresidents' medical records. Nevertheless, she explained that it took her from one and one-half to two hours per\nclient to retrieve information in the client's record, because there was \"[t]oo much crucial information in too many\nplaces, much of which [was] either incomplete, repetitive or inconsistent.\" (McGowan Report at 3.) Also, the\nHCFA's report cited several cases of primary care physicians altering patients' medication without informing the\ninterdisciplinary team, and patients' medication records not accurately reflecting the actual dosage of medication\n[28]\nthat the patients were receiving.\n\nEven when medical concerns were properly listed in a patient's record, STS often failed to follow-up with the\nappropriate medical care. For example, in several instances, medical records indicated that patients were\n[29]\nexperiencing significant weight loss, but STS failed to take action.  (McGowan Report at 11; Pl.Ex. 4 at 14, 15,\n16, and 21.) On other occasions, patients were diagnosed as having serious illnesses, but inadequate medical\naction was taken. (Pl.Ex. 4 at 13.)\nDr. Volkmar noted that STS's system for prescribing medication was at times \"very complicated,\" and had\n\"possible medical-legal implications.\" (Volkmar Report at 7-8.) He explained that there were at least six\n982 participants *982 involved in any transaction related to medication, which at times decreased the quality of patient\ncare. The participants included: (1) the client, (2) his/her parent or guardian, (3) the psychiatrist, (4) the primary\ncare (prescribing) physician, (5) the treatment team, and (6) the program review committee (the \"PRC\") \"which\nfunctioned as the final arbiter for medication decisions.\" (Volkmar Report at 7.) Dr. Volkmar explained that,\nalthough the rationale behind such an elaborate process was to ensure quality care, the process \"appeared, at\ntimes, to have the opposite effect in that quality of care was potentially worsened.\" (Volkmar Report at 7.)\nHe described one instance in which an elderly patient's psychiatrist requested that the patient's tranquilizing\nmedication be changed in light of his Parkinsonian symptoms. However, the PRC not only disapproved of the\npsychiatrist's request, but also \"preapproved\" a virtually opposite request of increasing the patient's current\nmedication. Dr. Volkmar stated that \"as far as could be determined no member of the PRC had ever seen the\npatient and ... with the exception of a single physician on the PRC (who presumably was not paying attention)\nother members would essentially not have been aware of the issues involved.\" (Id.)\nDr. Volkmar concluded that:\nThe implications of unqualified (e.g., unlicensed) personnel, in effect, making major decisions\nregarding pharmacological interventions is problematic. The use, as in the case noted above, of\n\"preapproval\" of certain drug regimens by PRC is (presumably) theoretically intended to shorten\nthe review process; it has the most unfortunate effect of undercutting the relationships of the\nphysician and his/her patient by well meaning individuals who basically do not know the patient....\n[This practice] appeared to cross the boundary of acceptable practice.\n(Volkmar Report at 7-8. See also Pl.Ex. 4 at 10.)\nC. Physical Therapy Services\nThe Remedial Orders require that STS provide adequate physical therapy services for those residents in need of\nsuch services. Adequate physical therapy is critical at an institution such as STS, as it serves to prevent physical\n[30]\ndegeneration, body deformities, and abnormal growth.\nAt the hearing, and in her report, (Pl.Ex. 8), Ms. Harryman revealed clearly that, as of her inspection on\nNovember 15-17, 1993, STS's physical therapy services had a plethora of deficiencies that violated the Remedial\nOrders. Indeed, she found that nearly every aspect of STS's physical therapy services was below professional\nstandards. Ms. Harryman opined that STS's grossly inadequate staffing was the primary cause of its poor\n983 physical therapy services. She explained that, in 1993, a mere seventeen of the 244 *983 residents receiving\nphysical therapy services were receiving assistance from licensed physical therapists (\"PT\"). The remaining\nresidents were forced to receive training from unlicensed rehabilitation therapy assistants (\"RTA\"). She concluded\nthat such staffing \"precludes residents in need of physical therapy from receiving adequate care.\" (Pl.Ex. 8 at 4.)\n[31]\nSTS has, however, taken steps to remedy this deficiency.\nAlthough licensed PTs planned the services that the RTAs administered, STS did not have objective guidelines\nfor monitoring the delivery of physical therapy services, or an established methodology for documenting\nprocedure implementation. Consequently, the RTAs and direct care staff often provided physical therapy services\nwithout the requisite guidance. (Pl.Ex. 8 at 4.) Furthermore, STS's training procedures did not provide guidelines\n\nfor determining staff competence prior to allowing such staff to administer physical therapy services. As a result,\n[32]\nresidents were in danger of receiving physical therapy from incompetent personnel.  (Id.)\nWhile STS has guidelines and procedures for determining when implementation and/or termination of physical\ntherapy is appropriate, it fails to implement them consistently. At the hearing, Ms. Harryman testified that STS has\na procedure for evaluating residents which consists of eight components. However, when she reviewed ten STS\nphysical therapy evaluations, she found that only 36% of the required components were covered in all of the\nevaluations. (Pl.Ex. 8 at 6.) Further, few of STS's evaluations included goals regarding physical therapy\ntreatment. Thus, it is clear that STS's staff was not assessing the effectiveness of its physical therapy services, or\nmodifying such services, when appropriate. This deficiency placed the patients at risk of receiving ineffective,\n[33]\nuseless, and detrimental therapy.  In fact, STS's inadequate physical therapy services have caused several\nresidents who, only a few years earlier, were ambulatory, to be permanently bedridden.\n[34]\nFinally, STS fails to make effective use of its general physical therapy protocols.  Professional standards\nrequire that \"all physical therapy protocols be dated and reviewed regularly.\" (Pl.Ex. 8 at 7.) A review of STS's\ngeneral physical therapy protocols evinced that STS had failed to document or make any additions or revisions to\nany of its general protocol reviews in nearly one and a half years. Further, in some instances, protocols were not\navailable for patients at all. (Pl.Ex. 8 at 7.)\nC. RULING ON CONTEMPT AND REMEDIES\nThe court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Defendants are in contempt of the Remedial Orders.\n984 [35] Although STS's quarterly reports reveal that it was in *984 compliance with over 90% of the Remedial\n[36]\nOrders' requirements,  such \"compliance\" was not effectuating the Remedial Orders' desired results. Indeed,\nSTS's systemic flaws have caused many residents to suffer grave harm, and, in several instances, death.\nTo insure that the Remedial Orders' purposes are satisfied in the future, the court will appoint a special master to\nreview STS's operations. It is well settled in the law that federal courts have the inherent power to appoint an\nagent to oversee the implementation of its consent decrees. In re Peterson, 253 U.S. 300, 312-13, 40 S.Ct. 543,\n547, 64 L.Ed. 919 (1920). Indeed, this \"court has an affirmative duty to protect the integrity of its decree. This\nduty arises where the performance of one party threatens to frustrate the purpose of the decree.\" Berger v.\nHeckler, 771 F.2d 1556, 1568 (2d Cir.1985) (emphasis added) (quoting Stotts v. Memphis Fire Dept., 679 F.2d\n541, 555 (6th Cir.1982),rev'd on other grounds sub nom., Firefighters Local Union No. 1784 v. Stotts, 467 U.S.\n561, 104 S.Ct. 2576, 81 L.Ed.2d 483 (1984) (footnote omitted)).\nWhile Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53(b) requires that the appointment of a special master be the exception\nrather than the rule, it does not \"terminate or modify the district court's inherent equitable power to appoint a\nperson ... to assist it in administering a remedy.\" Ruiz v. Estelle, 679 F.2d 1115, 1161 (5th Cir.1982). Rather,\n\"[b]eyond the provisions of [Fed.R.Civ.P. 53] for appointing and making references to Masters, a federal district\ncourt has the inherent power to supply itself with [a special master] for the administration of justice when deemed\nby it essential.\" Id. at 1161 n. 240 (citing Schwimmer v. U.S., 232 F.2d 855, 865 (8th Cir.),cert. denied,352 U.S.\n833, 77 S.Ct. 48, 1 L.Ed.2d 52 (1956) (citation omitted)). See also, Juan F. v. Weicker, 37 F.3d 874, 876 (2d\nCir.1994) (court appointed a monitoring panel, and later a single monitor, to oversee consent decree, \"because of\nthe difficult issues involved, as well as the importance to the plaintiff class of enforcing the decree.\"); Berger v.\nHeckler, 771 F.2d at 1568 (holding that court's desire to protect the integrity of its decree \"justifies any reasonable\naction taken by the court to secure compliance.\"); Stone v. San Francisco, 968 F.2d 850 (9th Cir.1992) (stating\nthat district courts are permitted to appoint a special master to oversee a consent decree); Local 28 of Sheet\nMetal Workers v. EEOC, 478 U.S. 421, 482, 106 S.Ct. 3019, 3053, 92 L.Ed.2d 344 (1986) (Court recognized the\n\"difficulties inherent in monitoring compliance with the court's orders,\" and, thus, found the appointment of an\nadministrator \"well within the District Court's discretion.\"); Kendrick v. Bland, 740 F.2d 432, 438 (6th Cir.1984)\n(holding that a court may appoint a \"monitor to observe defendants' conduct and thereby permit the federal court\nto oversee compliance with its continuing order.\").\n\nAn appellate court will not disturb a district court's decision to appoint a special master, unless a clear abuse of\njudicial power is shown. Further, deference to the district court's exercise of discretion is heightened where, as\nhere, the court has been overseeing a large, public institution for a long period of time. Stone, 968 F.2d at 856\n(citing Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 112 S.Ct. 748, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992)). See also \nHutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 688, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 2572, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978) (Court gave substantial\ndeference to district court's years of experience overseeing prison system).\nIn the instant case, the court finds that the complex nature of the case, together with the delicate interests of\nSTS's residents, call for the appointment of a special master to determine why STS's efforts are not producing\n985 the Remedial Orders' intended results, and to make recommendations to the *985 court. In addition, if the special\nmaster deems it necessary, the court will appoint an expert review panel, comprised of one expert in each of the\nthree areas discussed above, to assist the special master in making findings and recommendations. The special\nmaster shall take the following actions: (1) conduct an immediate and thorough review of all aspects of STS's\ncare and treatment of residents covered by the Remedial Orders to determine the changes needed to meet the\nOrders' desired ends; (2) formulate specific methods to implement the required changes; and (3) work with the\nparties to effectuate those changes.\nThe Plaintiff and Defendants shall report to the court, either jointly or severally, their recommendation(s) for\nappointment as special master on or before July 15, 1996. The court shall make the final determination.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] STS is an institution for the mentally disabled in the state of Connecticut. As of the hearing on this motion,\nSTS housed 843 residents, making it one of the ten largest institutions of its kind in the United States.\n[2] CRIPA authorizes the Department of Justice to investigate institutions for the mentally disabled, if credible\nallegations of unconstitutional conditions of confinement exist.\n[3] The Connecticut officials included: William A. O'Neill, Governor; Brian Lensink, Commissioner, Connecticut\nDepartment of Mental Retardation; Robert Griffith, Director, Southbury Training School; and Joseph I. Lieberman,\nConnecticut Attorney General.\n[4] The court will refer to the Consent Decree, Plan, and two Court Orders collectively as the \"Remedial Orders.\"\n[5] The Remedial Orders also mandate the following: Consent Decree § I(2) (requires provision of that degree of\ncare which is sufficient to protect all residents from unreasonable risks to their personal safety both by the\nconduct of staff, and of other residents); Consent Decree § I(4) (requires STS to prescribe and administer\nbehavior modifying medications pursuant to the exercise of professional judgment); Consent Decree § V(3)\n(requires STS to provide a sufficient number of training program hours for each resident); Consent Decree § V(5)\n(requires STS to maintain adequate records); Consent Decree § V(8) (requires that restraints and behavior\nmodifying medications not be used in lieu of training programs); 1991 Court Order § 1(A) (requires modification of\ntraining plans when necessary); and 1990 Court Order § 1(U) (requires, when appropriate, \"the Interdisciplinary\nTeam, within 30 days of each review, [to] modify the existing Overall Plan of Service of such residents in\naccordance with professional judgment of qualified professionals.\").\n[6] In the past, Stanley B. failed to pay attention to the end of his cigarette, and hot ash would fall on, and burn,\nhis clothing. Eventually, staff members limited his smoking to a pipe. Despite such limitation, Stanley B. was still\ncareless in packing his pipe with tobacco, often spilling loose tobacco on the floor and his clothing. (Pl. Ex. 12,\nFinal Investigation Report of Thomas Harmon at 9-10 [hereinafter \"Harmon Report\"].)\n[7] The goal entailed teaching Stanley B. to pack his pipe neatly, dump the pipe's hot ash in an ash-tray, place his\npipe in a fire-proof container in his gym bag, and clean up after himself. (Harmon Report at 11.)\n[8] When Mr. Harmon questioned STS officials about the termination of Stanley B.'s training, they reasoned that\n\"it could have been realized that the goal was beyond achievement or that other needs were more important. The\n\nrecord, however, did not indicate why attempts to teach [Stanley B.] safe-smoking habits were abandoned, or\nhow his need to `smoke safely' would otherwise be addressed.\" (Harmon Report at 12.)\n[9] HCFA conducts periodic examinations of those facilities for the mentally disabled receiving federal funding.\n[10] Pica is an abnormal desire to ingest substances not normally eaten.\n[11] For example: (1) A resident knocked Claire to the floor; (2) a resident pushed Karyn to the floor; (3) a\nresident punched Ray in the chest; (4) a resident hit Mary on the head; (5) Charlie punched a staff member in the\nback of his head; (6) a resident punched Judy in the eye; (7) a resident threw Alicia to the ground; and (8) a\nresident grabbed Brenda's head, and bit out a mouth full of hair. (Pl.Ex. 20.)\n[12] For example: (1) A resident slapped Stella two times in two days; (2) James headlocked another resident on\nthree separate occasions in one day; (3) a resident slapped Lillian D. on the head five times; (4) a resident head-\nbutted Christine O. three times; (5) a resident slapped David W. in the face two times; and (6) a resident slapped\nRichard W. in the face two times. (Pl. Ex. 20 and selected accident reports.)\n[13] Dr. Harchik also noted the conspicuous absence of positive staff interaction with the residents. He stated that\nhe observed fifty staff members across eleven settings, and found only one interacting with the residents.\n[14] Every ten to fifteen minutes Dr. Harchik would count systematically the number of residents who were\nengaged. Dr. Harchik's definition of \"engagement\" included any active participation in an activity (i.e., looking at\nmagazines, eating dinner, and playing with toys). (Pl.Ex. 22 at 11-12.)\n[15] Dr. Harchik stated that \"80% or lower is considered to be problematic by professional standards.\" (Pl.Ex. 22\nat 12.)\n[16] Dr. Harchik found that the patient's behavior was either worsening or not progressing.\n[17] Dr. Harchik stated that STS's \"clinical response to behaviors worsening appear[ed] to be to look to obtaining\na better diagnosis ... or changing medications.... There appears to be little focus upon modifying environmental\nconditions and intervention procedures.\" (Pl.Ex. 22 at 9.)\n[18] The Consent Decree provides in relevant part: § I(3) (adequate medical care shall be afforded all residents\npursuant to the exercise of professional judgment by a qualified professional); § I(4) (behavior modifying\nmedications and other medications must be prescribed and administered to residents pursuant to the exercise of\nprofessional judgment by a qualified professional); and § V(5) (plan shall be established setting forth the record\nkeeping systems, policies, and procedures with respect to each patient's care, medical treatment, and required\ntraining that shall be utilized to maintain and make available in each resident's record such information as is\nprofessionally necessary to permit the exercise of professional judgment in that resident's care, medical\ntreatment, and training).\n[19] One report described STS's treatment of John T.'s medical condition as \"plagued with medical flaws that may\nhave contributed to precipitating [his] death.... Upon return to STS in a debilitated but stable condition, John T.'s\nevaluation by his [primary care physician] failed to assess and address important aspects of his medical\ncondition.\" Memorandum of Miguel Aquino at 3 [hereinafter \"Aquino Memo\"].\n[20] Report on John T. by Dr. Rene Jahiel, STS Medical Director, at 1 [hereinafter \"Jahiel Report\"].\n[21]Id.\n[22]Id.\n[23] Dr. Jahiel stated that a \"thorough review and investigation on arrival should have revealed the excessive\ndosage of [D]ilantin and may have clarified the pathological processes ongoing in this patient, including the cause\nof his apparently severe pain.\" (Jahiel Report at 6.)\n[24] Aquino Memo at 4.\n\n[25] Dr. Guevarra ordered that John T. receive Demerol for \"severe pain,\" Ativan for \"agitation\", and Tylenol for\n\"mild pain.\" However, Dr. Guevarra did not clearly define what constitutes the respective levels of pain.\nConsequently, the amount of medicine given was left open to interpretation, and thus unpredictable. Id.\n[26] Dr. Guevarra did not consider, nor did he alert his nursing staff to, the possibility that such a mixture could\nresult in restlessness, insomnia, and self-abusive behavior. Consequently, when John T. exhibited such\nbehaviors, they \"were all regarded signs of pain and ... due to [Dr. Guevarra's] initial oversight that failed to\nconsider the potential deleterious effect of the cocktail of medications, the possibility that unusual behavior ...\ncould represent toxicity was never considered.\" As a result, the administering of medications never ended. Id.\n[27] Ms. McGowan reviewed eight lists and found that seven of them were either incomplete or inaccurate.\n(McGowan Report at 4.) Dr. James Walker stated that the \"medical records `problem lists' are not current and\nprogress notes do not indicate the problem being addressed, making review cumbersome and open to oversight.\nThis problem is multiplied by the number of disciplines using the progress notes.\" Report of Dr. James E.C.\nWalker at 1 [hereinafter \"Walker Report\"]. Moreover, a Quality Assurance Review Summary completed by an STS\nmedical staff member revealed the following: \n[I]n twenty-five percent of cases, all significant past illnesses were not listed and ... diagnostic procedures were\nnot listed in about thirty-three percent of the active problem lists. In regard to health case unit admissions, ten to\ntwelve percent of residents did not have daily progress notes for at least the first three days after admission.\n(Pl.Ex. 4 at 25.) See also, Pl.Ex. 4 at 8, 9, 26-27 (Dr. Wachtel cites other findings of poor problem lists).\n[28] Client # 02's medical records showed that, as of December 13, 1994, he was receiving ten mg. of Pindolol\ndaily, when, in actuality, he had been receiving fifteen mg. daily for nearly a month. In another case, Client # 03's\nprimary care physician increased his dosage of Tranxene from three to four times a day, but the increase was not\nreflected in Client # 03's medical records for over three months. (Pl.Ex. 19, HCFA 26 Colony Ct. Circle Survey at\n6.)\n[29] Ms. McGowan noted that unplanned weight loss in an environment like STS is almost always indicative of\nother health issues. (McGowan Report at 11.)\n[30] The Remedial Orders mandate the following: Consent Decree § V(4) (procedures shall be used to\n\"reasonably ensure that there is consultation and communication of relevant information between and among\npersonnel regarding residents' care, training needs and priorities ... and that such information is communicated to\nstaff who provide care for that resident\"); Consent Decree § V(5) (mandates that record keeping systems,\npolicies, and procedures with respect to each patient's care, medical treatment, and required training be utilized\nto maintain and make available in each resident's record such information as is professionally necessary to\npermit the exercise of professional judgment in that resident's care, medical treatment, and training); Consent\nDecree § V(6) (requires that measures be taken \"to provide adequate medical care, including evaluation of\nresidents with physical disabilities, and the specific steps that will be undertaken to provide appropriate medical\nand physical therapy services to prevent contractures, physical degeneration, and inappropriate body growth and\ndeformity\"); 1990 Court Order § 1(F) (requires the Defendants to provide \"appropriate physical therapy to each\nresident with physical handicaps for whom a program of physical therapy has been ordered by a qualified\nprofessional, and ensure records of such treatment are made and entered in the resident's medical record\"); and\n1990 Court Order § 1(G) (requires the Defendants to have a qualified physician assess each physically disabled\nresident \"to determine whether a physical therapy program should be initiated or an existing physical therapy\nprogram modified to prevent contractures, physical degeneration, and inappropriate body growth and deformity.\"\nThe physician is then required to refer those residents in need to a registered physical therapist. Within forty-five\ndays from such referral, the physical therapist is required to \"assess and evaluate each resident so referred and\ndevelop a written physical therapy program for each of them.\").\n[31] DMR entered into a two-year contract, effective from August 25, 1995, for the provision of 240 hours per\nweek of physical therapy, speech/language therapy, and occupational therapy services, the equivalent of six full-\ntime positions.\n\n[32] Indeed, Ms. Harryman found that a \"severe systemic problem at STS is that indirect physical therapy\nservices ... are implemented by people who are not adequately trained on a regular basis and who do not carry\nout adequate physical therapy treatment.\" (Pl.Ex. 8 at 4.) Ms. Harryman reviewed a video-tape which STS uses\nto train RTAs, and found it to be cursory and incapable of providing sufficient information to ensure safe and\nappropriate delivery of physical therapy. (Pl.Ex. 8 at 9.) Moreover, Ms. Harryman observed two RTAs\nimplementing physical therapy, and, in both instances, the RTA's procedures were administered incorrectly,\nthereby placing the resident in risk of physical maladies (i.e., contractures, deformity, musculoskeletal injury).\n(Pl.Ex. 8 at 7-8.)\n[33] Also STS's procedures do not provide for annual physical therapy assessments of clients. This, too, prevents\nSTS from determining the effectiveness of its services. Ms. Harryman opined that \"[r]e-evaluation on less than an\nannual basis is not adequate for any client receiving physical therapy services, which is a major concern in a\nfacility where multiply handicapped residents receive primary therapy services from unlicensed and minimally\ntrained personnel.\" (Pl.Ex. 8 at 5.)\n[34] A protocol is a detailed plan of physical therapy treatment or procedure.\n[35] The court notes that some of the most compelling evidence came from the Defendants own experts.\n[36] The court does not agree with the Plaintiff's contention that the compliance reports are not pertinent to the\ninstant matter. Rather, the court finds the compliance reports to be a suitable starting point in determining\nwhether the Defendants are complying with the Remedial Orders. Moreover, the court notes that the Plaintiff\nconsented to the Defendants' submission of compliance reports, (Consent Decree § V), and, heretofore, had\nnever contested the appropriateness of the court using such reports as a measure of compliance. Thus, the court\nwill not permit the Plaintiff to contest the validity of the compliance reports at this time.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

LEVAL, Circuit Judges. \nOpinion \n \nSUMMARY ORDER \n*1 THIS SUMMARY ORDER WILL NOT BE PUBLISHED IN THE FEDERAL REPORTER AND MAY NOT BE \nCITED AS PRECEDENTIAL AUTHORITY TO THIS OR ANY OTHER COURT, BUT MAY BE CALLED TO THE \nATTENTION OF THIS OR ANY OTHER COURT IN A SUBSEQUENT STAGE OF THIS CASE, IN A RELATED CASE, \nOR IN ANY CASE FOR PURPOSES OF COLLATERAL ESTOPPEL OR RES JUDICATA. \n \nAt a stated term of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, held at the United States Courthouse, Foley \nSquare, in the City of New York, on the 13th day of June, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-seven. \n  \nThis cause came on to be heard on the transcript of record from the United States District Court for the District of \nConnecticut (Burns, J.), and was argued. \n  \nON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the appeal be and it \nhereby is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. \n  \nDefendants, the State of Connecticut and various state officials, appeal from a ruling of the United States District Court for \nthe District of Connecticut finding defendants in civil contempt and stating the intent to appoint a special master. We dismiss \nthe appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. \n  \nThe United States initiated this action against the defendants in 1985 under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act \n(“CRIPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 1997, et seq.. The complaint sought to address and remedy the living conditions at the Southbury \nTraining School, a Connecticut institution for persons with developmental disabilities. \n  1 \n \n\nU.S. v. State of Conn., 116 F.3d 466 (1997)   \n \n  \nThe parties thereafter entered into a consent decree, which required the defendants to submit an implementation plan \naddressing the procedures by which the consent decree would be effectuated. The district court approved the plan in 1988, \nwhich was then modified by several stipulations filed by the parties in the late eighties. Two further stipulations and orders \n(primarily directed toward medical care at Southbury) were approved by the court in 1990 and 1991 respectively. The \nconsent decree, the implementation plan, and the two later stipulations and orders were referred to collectively by the district \ncourt as the “Remedial Orders.” \n  \nIn 1996, following an investigation and examination of the conditions at Southbury, the United States brought an application \nfor an order to show cause why defendants should not be held in contempt. The district court held a four day hearing and in a \nruling dated June 18, 1996, found the defendants in contempt of the Remedial Orders and stated the court’s intent to appoint \na special master to determine why Southbury’s efforts are not producing the Remedial Orders’ intended results, and to make \nrecommendations to the court. The district court imposed no sanctions and has not yet chosen a special master, apparently \ndue to the pendency of this appeal. \n  \nWe have jurisdiction to hear appeals of “final decisions” of the district courts. 28 U.S.C. § 1291. “[A] finding of contempt \nunaccompanied by sanctions is not final and thus cannot support an appeal.” Dove v. Atlantic Capital Corp., 963 F.2d 15,17 \n(2d Cir.1992) (citing In re Irving, 600 F.2d 1027, 1031 n. 1 (2d Cir.1979); Comptone Co. v. Rayex Corp., 251 F.2d 487, 488 \n(2d Cir.1958) (per curiam)). And “[a]n order referring a matter to a special master is not a final order appealable under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1291.” Grilli v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 78 F.3d 1533, 1538 (11th Cir.1996); see also Deckert v. Independence \nShares Corp., 311 U.S. 282, 290-91 & n. 4 (1940). \n  \n*2 It follows that the district court’s ruling in this case-finding defendants in contempt, imposing no sanctions, and stating the \nintent to appoint a special master-is not an appealable final decision. Nor does the court’s order qualify as an appealable order \nunder the collateral order doctrine. Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. \n  \nParallel Citations \n1997 WL 321594 (C.A.2 (Conn.)) \n \n \n  2 \n ",

No.\n1381].  The Court accepts and approves the Report1 and incorporates\nit into this Order by reference.\nOn  September  11,  1985,  following  an  investigation  by  the\nUnited  States  Department  of  Justice  under  the  Civil  Rights  of\nInstitutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 et seq.,\nPlaintiff United States brought this action against the State of\nConnecticut, the Governor, the Commissioner of the Department of\nMental Retardation (\"DMR\"), and the Director of Southbury Training\nSchool  (“STS”)  pursuant  to  CRIPA,  informing  Defendants  that\nPlaintiff had reasonable cause to believe that persons residing in\nor confined to STS were being subjected to egregious and flagrant\n1The Court addresses all remaining aspects of the Remedial Plan in this\nruling.  The Master’s Report to the Court No. 62 did not address\nCommunications as the Master previously found Defendants in non-compliance on\nthat issue, and the matter was still pending before this Court at the time the\nMaster submitted the Report. \nThe Report contains minor inaccuracies which this Court does not adopt. \nSee e.g. Report at 22, Recommendation 1 – this Court found Defendants in\ncontempt on June 19, 1996.\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1405     Filed 03/24/2006     Page 2 of 13(cid:10)\nconditions  depriving  them  of  their  rights  secured  by  the\nConstitution of the United States.  In lieu of litigation, the\nUnited States and Defendants entered into a Consent Decree which\nthis Court so ordered on December 22, 1986.  The Consent Decree\nrequired the Defendants to submit an Implementation Plan, which was\nadopted by the Court on July 21, 1988. \nOn June 19, 1996, this Court found Defendants in contempt of\nthe Consent Decree, the Implementation Plan and the Court Orders of\nApril 24, 1990 and December 9, 1991 (collectively the \"Remedial\nOrders\").  United States v. State of Connecticut, 931 F. Supp. 974\n(D. Conn. 1996), appeal dismissed, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 21006 (2d\nCir. June 13, 1997).  This Court stated that a finding of contempt\nwas appropriate when the Court Orders were clear and unambiguous,\nthe moving party established non-compliance by clear and convincing\nevidence, and Defendants had not exercised reasonable diligence in\nattempting to comply with the Court Orders.  Id. at 976.  Plaintiff\nalleged,  and  the  Court  so  found,  that  the  Defendants  were  in\ncontempt  of  the  Remedial  Orders  in  three  areas:  psychological\nservices, medical services and physical therapy services.  Id.  The\nCourt found  that,  although  the Defendants’ quarterly reporting\nshowed  compliance  with  over  90%  of  the  Remedial  Orders’\nrequirements, the systemic flaws at STS caused many residents to\nsuffer grave harm, including death.  Id. at 983-84.\n2\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1405     Filed 03/24/2006     Page 3 of 13(cid:10)\nTo ensure that the purposes of the Remedial Orders would be\neffectuated,  the  Court,  with  the  concurrence  of  the  parties,\nappointed David Ferleger as Special Master under its inherent power\nto appoint an agent to oversee the implementation of a consent\ndecree.2  A Remedial Plan was developed by the Special Master in\nconjunction with the parties and adopted by the Court on April 21,\n1998.  Since that time, the Special Master has proceeded to review\nthe outstanding Remedial Plan requirements and recommend release\nwhen compliance has been achieved and sustained.  This Court now\ndetermines that Defendants have fully and faithfully implemented\nall provisions of the Remedial Plan, and Defendants are released\nfrom the finding of contempt and active judicial oversight.3  The\nSpecial Master is discharged from his duties with the gratitude of\nthe Court for his service.  The Court Requirements in the Remedial\nPlan  will  continue  as  an  injunction,  the  Consent  Decree  and\nRemedial Orders will remain in effect, and this Court will retain\njurisdiction until the judgment is discharged, as provided in the\nCourt’s Order of April 24, 1990 [Doc. No. 73].4   \nThe Master’s Report commends Defendants for their successful\neffort to achieve  sustained compliance and highlights priority\n2931 F. Supp. 974, 984 (D. Conn. 1996) (citing In re Peterson, 253 U.S.\n300, 312-13 (1920); Berger v. Heckler, 771 F.2d 1556, 1568 (2d Cir. 1985);\nRuiz v. Estelle, 679 F.2d 1115, 1161 (5th Cir. 1982)). \n3N.L.R.B. v. J.P. Stevens & Co., Inc., 563 F.2d 8, 16 (2d Cir. 1977).\n4Thus, for example, the Court will still receive the quarterly\ncompliance reports as mandated by the Consent Decree until the Consent Decree\nis terminated.  See Consent Decree § VI. 2.A.  \n3\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1405     Filed 03/24/2006     Page 4 of 13(cid:10)\nareas, termed “sentinel mandates,” which, based on the last nine\nyears’ experience, the Special Master finds are “most in need of\nvigilant attention” by the State of Connecticut and the United\nStates to ensure that the Defendants maintain their commitments\nunder the Consent Decree and Remedial Orders.5  Along with these\nsentinel components, the Master expects that the Quality Assurance\nPlan, Outcome Expectations identified by Defendants in 2002,6 a\nperiodic expert evaluation of the Quality Assurance Plan, and the\ncontinuing injunction imposed by the Consent Decree, the Remedial\nPlan and the associated orders will serve as the safeguards and\nmaintenance of effort protections for residents of STS. \nThe Special Master’s report highlights the progress in each of\nthe areas he deems priorities.  This Court commends the parties on\n5See Special Master's Report to the Court No. 62: Safeguards &\nMaintenance of Effort. These areas are:\nA.  Habilitation and Case Management\nB.

After Judicial Oversight ‘What Dreams May Come’”\n(Jan. 31, 2002).  This document was never filed with the Court; it is \nreferenced in the Special Master’s Report to the Court No. 40: Quality\nAssurance Plan [Doc. No. 811] and Report to the Court No. 62: Safeguards and\nMaintenance of Effort [Doc. No. 1381].  The outcomes are as follows:\n1.  Good health and good health management;\n2.  Freedom from undue restriction or restraint;\n3.  Meaningful and enjoyable activities, commensurate with one’s\n    capacity and stamina;\n4.  Opportunity for personal growth and development;\n5.  Minimization of untoward events;\n6.  Engagement with friends, family, staff and peers; and\n7.  Safety.\n4\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1405     Filed 03/24/2006     Page 5 of 13(cid:10)\nthe progress made in those areas, and specifically notes below the\ncompliance achieved in the three broad areas which were the focus\nof this Court’s finding of contempt in 1996.\nPhysical Therapy\nIn 1996, this Court found the provision of physical therapy\nservices at STS to be below professional standards, mainly due to\ngrossly inadequate staffing.  Only seventeen of the 244 residents\nreceiving physical therapy services were receiving such services\nfrom a licensed physical therapist.  Among other shortcomings,\nguidelines to assess staff competence to provide physical therapy\nservices were nonexistent, no methodology existed to document the\nprovision of services, and residents were in danger of receiving\nphysical therapy services from incompetent persons.  In short,\nresidents were at risk of receiving “ineffective, useless, and\ndetrimental therapy.”  931 F. Supp. 974, 983.  The Remedial Plan\nrequired Defendants to provide appropriate physical therapy within\n30 days of a referral, and mandated that clients would receive\ntreatments  ordered  by  physicians  and  implemented  by  physical\ntherapists as well as procedures recommended by therapists and\nimplemented  by  assigned persons.   Extensive  record-keeping was\nmandated,  and  Defendants  were  required  to  document  service\nprovision as well as the monitoring of that service provision.  The\nsame  consultant  who  found  deficiencies  prior  to  the  contempt\nproceeding  reviewed  services  in  2001  and  found  Defendants  in\n5\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1405     Filed 03/24/2006     Page 6 of 13(cid:10)\ncompliance with most aspects of the Remedial Plan pertaining to\nphysical  therapy.  Defendants  and  Plaintiff  thereafter  worked\ncooperatively to address a few areas of concern raised by the\nconsultant.  The result of such efforts was the development of STS\npolicies on the implementation of physical therapy intervention\nprograms and client positioning needs, and the recommendation for\nrelease of Defendants from all remaining provisions of the Remedial\nPlan pertaining to Physical Therapy.  By 2002, Defendants has been\nfound compliant with regard to physical therapy staffing and the\nquality of physical therapy provided to residents.       \nMedical Services\nThe Remedial Orders require the provision of adequate medical\ncare  pursuant  to  the  exercise  of  professional  judgment  by  a\nqualified professional.  At the time this Court found Defendants in\ncontempt  of  the  Remedial  Orders,  patient  problems  lists  were\nincomplete  or  inaccurate,  record-keeping  procedures  were  below\nprofessional standards, there was no adequate medical follow-up for\nsome  documented  medical  concerns,  and  the  elaborate  process\ndeveloped for prescribing medicine worsened the quality of care.\n931 F. Supp. at 980-82.  The Court detailed the unfortunate errors\nand appalling examples of inadequate medical care which possibly\ncontributed to the death of one resident.  In another instance, the\nprogram  review  committee  (PRC),  which  functioned  as  the  final\ndecision-maker regarding medication, disapproved a psychiatrist’s\n6\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1405     Filed 03/24/2006     Page 7 of 13(cid:10)\nmedication  request  for  a  particular  resident.    In  effect,\n“unqualified (e.g. unlicensed) personnel . . . [were] making major\ndecisions regarding pharmacological interventions.”  Id. at 982.\nIn January of 2006, the Special Master’s consultant reviewed\nthe  provision  of  medical  services  at  STS.    His  report  found\nDefendants in compliance with all remaining aspects of the Remedial\nPlan pertaining to medical services.  See Consultation and Review\nof  Medical  Services:  Report  to  the  Special  Master  (“Medical\nServices Review”) [Doc. No. 1386].  In contrast to the situation in\n1996, the consultant found that “the process of maintaining and\nmonitoring the quality of care appears to be well established at\nSTS,” and “the medical staff at STS are extremely dedicated and\nwell-trained,”  delivering  “high  quality  medical  services  to  a\ncomplex  group  of  patients.”7    The  consultant  opined  that  the\ninstrument and process used for quality assurance is appropriate\nand identifies areas of concern so that corrective action can be\ntaken.    Problems  regarding  the  documentation  of  referrals  and\ntimely access to medical specialty services appear to have been\n7Consultation and Review of Medical Services: Report to the Special\nMaster at 34.  The consultant, Dr. Bauer, also noted that a few of the medical\nproviders at STS opined that the quality of medical care afforded the\nresidents of STS is considerably better than that provided in the general\npopulation.  \nWhile finding compliance with all outstanding aspects of the Remedial\nPlan pertaining to medical services, the Court notes that the consultant also\nmade recommendations for further improvement in the delivery of medical\nservices at STS.  Such improvements would bring STS above and beyond the\nrequirements of the Remedial Plan.  This Court assumes that the system in STS\nis now self-sustaining and that Defendants will strive to improve beyond the\nperiod of active judicial oversight.\n7\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1405     Filed 03/24/2006     Page 8 of 13(cid:10)\nresolved  with  the  implementation  of  effective  scheduling  and\ntracking systems for consultations at the STS clinics and in the\ncommunity and the designation of a community nurse scheduler.  \nFurthermore, STS has come into compliance on resident problem\nlists by the inclusion of an Active Problem List (APL) at the front\nof  each  resident’s  medical  chart.    These  lists  were  often\nincomplete or inaccurate at the time of the contempt finding; the\nconsultant found that STS has largely transitioned toward typed\nAPLs that follow a standardized template, thus providing a greater\nclinical benefit in the opinion of the consultant.  Even the few\nhandwritten APLs reviewed were found adequate.  \nWith regard to acute hospital admission services and specialty\nservices, STS has developed a smooth working relationship with two\nnearby hospitals, and there is an efficient system for emergency\ntransport to hospitals.  Each resident’s chart has an emergency\npacket containing essential information to accompany them to the\nhospital.\nWith regard to unscheduled hospitalizations, the consultant\nfound that the rate of hospitalizations does not seem out of the\nexpected range, and the monitoring process in place at STS to\nevaluate the quality of the process is carried out with “diligence\nand integrity.”  Medical Services Review at 29.  The consultant\nnoted that his independent efforts to verify that level of care\nsuggest that “the clinical management of unscheduled admissions is,\n8\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1405     Filed 03/24/2006     Page 9 of 13(cid:10)\nin fact, well done at STS.”  Id. at 30.  As a result of these\nfindings of compliance and the Special Master’s recommendation that\nthe  Court  release  the  outstanding  Remedial  Plan  requirements\nrelating to Medical Services, this Court released Medical Services\nfrom active judicial oversight.  \nPsychological Services\nIn 1996, the Court’s concerns regarding Psychological Services\nfocused on the ineffective implementation of behavior plans, the\nfailure of STS to protect its residents from injury to themselves\nand unreasonable risk of injury by other residents, the failure of\nthe institution to keep residents actively engaged, and the use of\nbehavioral  medication  in  lieu  of  training  programs  and\nhabilitation.  STS was conforming to the letter of the Remedial\nOrders, but not effectuating the spirit and purpose of the orders,\nand thereby not producing the required results.  In stark contrast\nto the situation in 1996, by August 2005, over 89% of the residents\nat STS had benefitted from the Overall Plan of Service (“OPS”)\nInitiative/Habilitation  Initiative  begun  in  late  2002.    This\nInitiative was a “best practice” adopted by STS to provide person-\ncentered overall plans, moving away from the old model of deficit-\ndriven planning.8  \nAdditionally, with regard to protection of residents from\nabuse and neglect, the Special Master’s Report notes the dramatic\n8See Ruling on Case Management Plan Compliance [Doc. No. 1347] at 23-25.\n9\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1405     Filed 03/24/2006     Page 10 of 13(cid:10)\nchanges at STS that serve to keep clients safer.  There are several\ntrained staff working in an autonomous Human Rights Office who\nconduct extensive and professional investigations and track and\nanalyze  trends  and  cases  of  abuse  and  neglect.    Follow-up  on\nrecommendations  from  investigations  occurs  regularly,  and\nincidences of abuse and neglect have declined significantly.  And,\nas  the  Special  Master  noted  in  Report  to  the  Court  No.  54:\nAbuse/Neglect Client Training [Doc. No. 1107], residents of STS are\nnow trained in protecting themselves from abuse and neglect and in\nreporting such treatment to the authorities. \nFurthermore, in contrast to the situation in 1996, where the\nevidence demonstrated that staff members did not keep the residents\nactively engaged, the consultant appointed by the Special Master to\nreview Habilitation at STS in November of 2005 found that “[i]n\nevery  unit[,]  staff  (including  supervisors)  were  actively\ninteracting with people, as opposed to congregating together or\noccupying  themselves  with  administrative  tasks.”    Habilitation\nServices at Southbury Training School (“Habilitation Report”) at 11\n[Doc.  No.  1344  Exh.  1].    And,  in  contrast  to  the  ineffective\nimplementation  of  behavior  plans  at  the  time  of  the  contempt\nfinding, the consultant found in 2005 that “the level of cognitive\nor  physical  ability  didn’t  translate  into  ‘cookie  cutter’\n[Behavior]  Plans.

The Habilitation Report ended with the\nfollowing observations: “Every single staff person was positive,\nengaging with the people they serve, and having fun. . . .  We saw\nlots  of  little  displays  of  caring  that  were  unexpected.”\nHabilitation Report at 21.   \nConclusion\nSpecial Master David Ferleger has effectively rendered a great\npublic  service  in  shepherding  this  process  through  to  its\nconclusion.  He has submitted to the Court twenty-six periodic\nstatus reports, sixty-three numbered topic-specific reports, many\nspecial reports and recommendations to the parties, and numerous\nother analyses. \nThe Court appreciates the efforts of the United States to\nbring STS into compliance since the mid-1980s.  The Court expects\nthe United States will continue to monitor the welfare of the\nresidents of Southbury Training School well beyond the period of\nactive judicial oversight.  \nDefendants are commended for the tremendous improvements they\nundertook in the years since this Court found them in contempt of\nthe  Remedial  Orders.    The  dramatic  turnaround  at  STS  required\ncommitment, dedicated resources and extraordinary systemic changes\n9The consultant noted that 75% of the population at STS is classified in\nthe severe or profound range of disability.\n11\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1405     Filed 03/24/2006     Page 12 of 13(cid:10)\ndocumented in the record.  The contempt finding has resulted in the\nreform of Southbury Training School mandated in the Remedial Plan\nand its associated plans and orders.  The remedial process has done\nmuch  to  advance  the  interests  of  the  residents  of  Southbury\nTraining School.  Ten years ago, this Court found systemic flaws at\nSTS which placed residents at risk of great harm, even death.\nToday, residents of STS are safer and benefit from a state-of-the-\nart  model  of  institutional  care  as  Defendants  have  met  the\n“adequate care” requirements in the Remedial Plan and, in many\ninstances, gone beyond the court-mandated requirements to provide\n“best practices.” \nFor the above reasons, it is hereby ORDERED:\n1.  The  purposes  of  the  Remedial  Orders  having been\neffectuated,  Defendants  are  purged  of  the  contempt\nadjudicated by the Court on June 19, 1996.\n2.  Defendants are released from active judicial oversight of\nall requirements in the Remedial Plan and its associated\norders.\n3.  The Court Requirements in the Remedial Plan will continue\nas an injunction, the Consent Decree and Remedial Orders\nwill  remain  in  effect,  and  this  Court  will  retain\njurisdiction until the judgment is discharged.\n12\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1405     Filed 03/24/2006     Page 13 of 13(cid:10)\n4.

Immediately, Defendants shall:\nA.  Establish a permanent committee of doctoral level\npsychology staff, chaired by the Director of Psychology, which\nshall every 30 days review the data relating to implementation of\ntraining programs for each resident who: (l) exhibits self-\ninjurious or aggressive behavior or (2) is subject to aversive\nprogramming, or (3) receives behavior modifying medication, or\n(4) is otherwise thought to be at risk, to ascertain whether (i)\nthere is sufficient behavioral data recorded, (ii) such data is\nreliable, and  (iii) the continuation of such training or\ntreatment program is justified or the program, including\nmedication, should be modified for any reason.  Where inadequate\nor unreliable data is found, or the continuation of the training\n\nor treatment program is otherwise not justified, the matter shall\nbe referred to the appropriate Interdisciplinary Team which\nshall, within 30 days from the referral, modify the existing\nprogram in accordance with professional judgment of qualified\nprofessionals, including the primary care physician and\npsychiatrist.  The Human Rights and Program Review Committees\nshall receive and review, monthly, reports concerning the reviews\nrequired by this paragraph, and,\nB.

A major contribution is anticipated from Psychology with the\nsupport of Unit Directors.\nThe PLAN has four major areas of focus that are described below:\n1.  Reliability of behavioral data.\n2.  Quality assurance of behavioral programs and behavior med reviews.\n3.  Interdisciplinary team review of clients \"at risk\".\n4.  PRC and HRC reviews of data reliability and program quality.\nRELIABILITY OF BEHAVIORAL DATA:\nRationale - Reliability is confirmed to assure that clinical decisions are\nbased on trustworthy data.\nResponsible staff - Psychology staff in each unit hhaavv<e designed and imple-\nmented a unit specific approach to reliability sampling.  This effort is\nmanaged by psychology and operates with participation by other team members.\nIt is overseen and supported by the Unit Director.\nMethod and Documentation - \"At risk\" clients are prioritized within each unit\nand scheduled for reliability sampling of behavioral data.  Team members are\ndesignated as participants in conducting reliability checks according to the\nunit schedule.  Data sheets matching those routinely used are scored by the\nindependent observers, computations of reliability percentages are shown on\nthe data sheet, and an entry is made in the Reliability Log for each client\ncompleted.  The completed observer data sheets for all clients sampled are\nsubmitted to Psychology with the Reliability Logs en the first day of each\nmonth.  A separate Log is used for each cottage in the unit.  Logs are sub-\ng  g\nsequently sharedd  wiithh  th  Ui  i  i\nthe Unit Directors and with the Consent Decree Co-\nordinator.\nSamples yielding less than 80S signal questionable trustworthiness in the data\nand require specific steps for improvement with a timetable for implementation.\nClients affected are scheduled for re-checking reliability following implemen-\ntation of adjustments.\nReliability checks are scheduled for each \"at risk\" client at a rate of once\nper 3-4 months to re-confirm acceptable reliability of behavioral data.\nStatus of data reliability is reviewed rountinely at psychotropic medication\nreviews (monthly) and at OPS reviews (quarterly).\nQUALITY ASSURANCE OF BEHAVIORAL PROGRAMS AND BEHAVIOR MEDICATION REVIEWS\n.Rationale - Clinical products and process are reviewed to provide supervisory\nfeedback to psychology staff and assure maintenance of high clinical standards.\nResponsible staff - A Permanent Committee chaired by the Director of Psychology\nand including doctoral level psychology staff reviews behavioral programs and\nmedication reviews for \"at risk\" clients.\nMethod and Documentation - Permanent Committee members conduct reviews of \"at risk\"\nclients.  A total of fifteen clients per month are reviewed, prioritized for review\nwithin units according to clinical need.\n\nCONSOLIDATED BEHAVIOR PROGRAM R£VIE¾ PLAN\nPage -2-\nReviews for Quality Assurance address both behavioral program quality and psy-\nchotropic medication review process.  Program quality is evaluated with the\nQuality Assurance Checklist which includes but is not limited ta a review of:\nsufficiency of data, reliability of data, and justification for continuation of\nof the existing program.  Client programs that are not justified in their pre-\nsent form are prioritized for revision within 30 days.  Doctoral supervisors\nsubmit monthly documentation of reviews including the completed QA Checklist\nand a QA Log for each month.\nReviews of psychotropic medication reviews are completed at the same time as\nQA's if the client is on psychotropic medication.  A recent medication review\nform is surveyed for confirmation of clinical accuracy and comprehensiveness.\nComments are offered on the form where appropriate.  Each form is dated and\nsigned by the supervisor and submitted as documentation of the review along\nwith a completed Psychotropic Medication Review Log for each cottage.\nINTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM R£YIE¼\nRationale - Review of status of \"at risk\" clients facilitates team process and\nprioritization of client needs.\nResponsible staff - Psychology staff provide ongoing monthly updates on \"at risk\"\nclients, including status of programs.  Program development is prioritized to\nassure each client has a program.  The Team and Case Manager update OPS to reflect\nclient needs and status.  The Unit Director reviews monthly updates and facilitates\npriorities to maintain programs for all \"at risk\" clients.\nMethod and Documentation - Psychology staff set month to month goals and priori-\nties based upon need for programs.  Psychology accuracy in monitoring status of\n\"at risk\" clients facilitates prioritization.  Monthly updates are provided via\ncomputer entry with hard copy back-up.  Status by unit is evaluated via monthly\nmanagement reports.  Unit Directors provide independent monitoring of updates\nand facilitate team goals for \"at risk\" clients.  Quarterly OPS reviews provide\ndocumentation of client status.\nPRC Ai(O HRC REVIEWS Of RELIABILITY AND PROGRAM QUALITY\nRationale - PRC and HRC provide external review of compliance.\nResponsible staff - Psychology provides Reliability Logs and QA Checklist Logs\nfor all units monthly to Consent Decree Coordinator (CDC), who in turn provides\ninformation to PRC and HRC.  Management Reports provide additional information\non unit by unit progress for \"at risk\" clients.\nMethod and Documentation - Logs for each month are submitted to CDC for PRC and\nHRC reviews.  Minutes of PRC and HRC provide documentation of reviews.\nMJp/ms\nRef:OOl",

As\na remedy, the Master recommends this Court enter an order requiring\nDefendants  to  establish  a  formal  fidelity  mechanism,  hire  an\nadditional  three  professional  speech-language  staff  (with  a\nsubsequent needs assessment to be undertaken by the Master) and\nsubmit a written plan for achievement of compliance.3  The Special\nMaster’s findings are general; he does not make specific findings\nof non-compliance that relate to each of the CRs pertaining to\n3The Master’s Report recommends an order be entered: \n“1) Requiring that a fidelity mechanism be established at STS to ensure\nthat the Communications Services aspects of Habilitation programs are implemented\nprofessionally and administered reliably, and that written programs are, in fact,\nimplemented in accordance with professional speech/language standards[;] \n2) Requiring additional professional speech/language professional staff,\nadding at least three such staff to enable the service improvements described\nearlier.A    These  additional  staff  should  be  added  now,  with  a  full  needs\nassessment regarding staffing needs to be undertaken thereafter by the master[;]\n[and]\n3)  Requiring  Defendants  to  immediately  submit  a  written  plan  for\nachievement of compliance with the above mandates within twenty-five (25) days,\nsaid plan to be subject to review, approval and modification by the master.”  \nReport at 29.\nAThe  Master’s  suggested  service  improvements  include:  1)  an  increased\npresence of SLPs in day programs and residences; 2) a more active role for SLPs\nin  the  resident’s  programs  and  COPS  guidelines;  3)  an  increased  number  of\nteaching strategies for residents; and 4) more active monitoring of programs.\nReport at 3.\n2\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 3 of 32(cid:10)\nCommunication Services – CRs 27, 43, 44 and 52.  \nBackground\nThe background of this action has been extensively set forth\nin prior rulings, and is noted briefly here only to give context to\nthe Communication Services compliance issues.  \nOn  September  11,  1985,  following  an  investigation  by  the\nUnited  States  Department  of  Justice  under  the  Civil  Rights  of\nInstitutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. §1997 et seq.,\nPlaintiff brought this action against the State of Connecticut, the\nGovernor, the Commissioner of the Department of Mental Retardation\n(\"DMR\"), and the Director of STS, pursuant to CRIPA. In lieu of\nlitigation, the United States and various Connecticut officials\nentered into a Consent Decree so ordered by this Court on December\n22, 1986.\nThe Consent Decree required the Defendants to submit an\nImplementation Plan, which was adopted by the Court on July 21,\n1988.  The Implementation Plan refers to specialty medical and\ntherapeutic services, including, inter alia, “speech pathology”\nand notes the following tasks and timetables: “Recruit to fill\navailable PT/OT speech positions or convert positions to\ncontracts to purchase services ... continuous recruitment;\nEstablish six (6) scholarships through STS Foundation and Home\nand School Association to support OT/PT/Speech professional\ntraining in exchange for commitment to work at STS ...\n3\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 4 of 32(cid:10)\ncompleted.”  Implementation Plan at 39.  The Implementation Plan\nnoted that as of May 1987, “contracts with private providers in\nthe disciplines of occupational therapy, physical therapy and\nspeech pathology total approximately 40 hours of service per\nweek.”  Id.  There are no other references to speech pathology in\nthe Implementation Plan.\nEight years after the Court adopted the Implementation Plan,\nDefendants were found in contempt of the Consent Decree and the\nImplementation Plan (“the remedial orders”).

The\nSpecial Master was appointed by the Court, and a Remedial Plan\n[Doc.  No.  188]  was  developed  by  the  Special  Master  with  the\nparties’ consent and adopted by the Court on April 21, 1998.  The\nRemedial Plan explicitly refers to Speech Therapy only once, in\nCourt Requirement (CR) 27, which essentially adopts the language\nfrom  the  Implementation  Plan  with  regard  to  recruitment  of\nOccupational Therapy/Physical Therapy and Speech positions.4  The\n4\nCourt Requirement 27 Occupational, Physical and Speech Therapy\n27.

Defendants also assert that they were denied due process\nbecause the Reichle report was considered by the Special Master\nwithout  Reichle  being  available  for  cross-examination  at  the\nhearing  and  without  his  report  being  admitted  into  evidence.\nFurthermore, Defendants argue that the record does not support the\nSpecial Master’s findings that more Speech-Language Pathologists\n(SLPs) are needed at STS and a formal fidelity mechanism must be in\nplace  for  Defendants  to  be  compliant  with  the  Remedial  Plan,\nConsent Decree and Implementation Plan.  Defendants also argue that\nit was inappropriate for the Special Master to allude to other\npossible deficiencies in communications programs that might be\nreviewed in the future without making specific findings that such\ndeficiencies exist.  Finally, Defendants assert that the Special\nMaster did not consider all relevant evidence, including the ICF/MR\nsurveys. \nUnited States’ Position\nThe initial response from the United States to Defendants’\nObjections came in May of 2005, during the period the parties were\nurging this Court to accept the proposed settlement of this action.\n7\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 8 of 32(cid:10)\nAt that point, the parties were attempting to reach a consensus\nregarding Communication Services, and the United States, without\nstating its position regarding compliance, requested that the Court\ndefer  a  decision  on  Communication  Services  until  the  parties\nreached an agreement.  See United States’ Response to Defendants’\nObjections to the Special Master’s Report to the Court No. 57:\nCommunication Services [Doc. No. 1261].  Subsequently, this Court\ndisapproved the parties’ settlement agreement and all outstanding\naspects  of  the  Remedial  Plan  were  set  for  compliance\ndetermination.6  This Court then ordered the United States to file\nan updated response to Defendants’ objections.  Plaintiff’s second\nresponse concurs with the findings of the Special Master and moves\nthis Court to find Defendants not in compliance with the Remedial\nPlan regarding Communication Services.  See United States’ Response\nto Defendants’ Objections to the Special Master’s Report to the\nCourt No. 57 and Court’s Order Dated November 23, 2005 [Doc. No.\n1372].  Plaintiff  United  States  argues  that  the  Special  Master\napplied the correct standard of review, appropriately referenced\nthe findings of his experts, considered all relevant evidence, and\nthat the record supports his findings that a needs assessment of\ncommunications services staffing is required and that a fidelity\nand  reliability  mechanism  is  necessary  under  the  Court\nRequirements.\n6See Ruling on Parties’ Final Revised Joint Agreement for Release of the\nRemedial Plan from Active Judicial Oversight [Doc. No. 1283].\n8\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 9 of 32(cid:10)\nStandard of Review\nThe Master’s Report was filed pursuant to FED.R.CIV.P. 53 on\nApril 6, 2005.  Rule 53 was amended on December 1, 2003.  Under the\namended Rule, the Court must review de novo the findings of fact\nobjected to by either party “unless the parties stipulate with the\ncourt’s consent that the master’s findings will be reviewed for\nclear error.”  FED.R.CIV.P. 53(g)(3)(A).  The Court also is charged\nto review de novo all “objections to conclusions of law made or\nrecommended by a master.”  FED.R.CIV.P. 53(g)(4).  “In acting on a\nmaster's order, report, or recommendations, the court must afford\nan opportunity to be heard and may receive evidence, and may: adopt\nor affirm; modify; wholly or partly reject or reverse; or resubmit\nto the master with instructions.”  FED.R.CIV.P. 53(g)(1).\n Because this Court’s review is de novo, it is not limited to\nthe  Master's  findings  of  fact,  nor  need  this  Court  show  the\nfindings any particular deference.  Finance One Public Co. Ltd. v.\nLehman Bros. Special Financing, Inc. 414 F.3d 325, 341 (2d Cir.\n2005).  Additionally, a Master’s legal conclusions are entitled to\nno special deference.  Fogel v. Chestnutt, 668 F.2d 100, 116-17 (2d\nCir. 1981), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 828 (1982).  The Court finds\nthat  the  record  is  sufficient  for  a  compliance  determination\nwithout a further hearing.    \n9\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 10 of 32(cid:10)\nDiscussion  \nThe Court commends the Special Master for the time and care\nwith which he undertook a review of Defendants’ compliance with the\nCommunication Services aspect of Habilitation.  Having reviewed the\nMaster’s findings and conclusions de novo, this Court holds that\nthe  Master’s  findings  of  fact  and  conclusions  of  law  that\nDefendants are non-compliant with regard to Communication Services\nare not supported by the evidence.  For the reasons set out below,\nthis  Court  finds  Defendants  are  in  compliance  with  the\nCommunication  Services  aspect  of  Habilitation,  and  all  Court\nRequirements  pertaining  to  Communication  Services  are  hereby\nRELEASED from active judicial oversight. \nCompliance Standard\nDefendants maintain that the Special Master and his experts\nincorrectly imposed “minimally adequate professional standards”\nupon  them  in  assessing  compliance,  adding  new  obligations  not\nenvisioned by the parties during the creation of the Remedial Plan.\nDefendants argue that the appropriate standard is contained in the\nCourt Requirements and that, if the constitutional standard were\napplicable,  it  would  be  the  Youngberg  v.  Romeo  “substantial\ndeparture” standard rather than the “minimally adequate” standard\nreferenced by the Master.  See Defendants’ Objections at 2-7.  \nIn finding STS deficient in the area of Communication Services,\nthe  Master  notes  that  Defendants  are  not  providing  “minimally\n10\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 11 of 32(cid:10)\nadequate habilitation in the communications area.”  Report at 2.\nHe notes further that Defendants’ criticisms of the standard of\nreview used by Dr. Calculator are misplaced because Calculator’s\n1999 review stated as its purpose “determining whether services\n‘are  minimally  adequate,  according  to  current  professional\nstandards and professional judgment,’ (the classic Youngberg v.\nRomeo test).”  Report at 14.  \nReport  to  the  Court  No.  21  (Revised):  Scope  of  Work  for\nConsultant Review set forth the following standard for the review\nof Communication Services by the Special Master’s expert: \n“This expert review will include, when appropriate under\na given Evaluation Criterion, a determination of whether\nthe professional judgment of STS staff meets standards,\ndefined as:\nA decision . . . that is not such a substantial\ndeparture  from  accepted  professional  opinion,\npractice, or standards as to demonstrate that the\nperson responsible did not base the decisions on\nsuch professional opinion, practice or standards.”\nReport to the Court No. 21 (Revised) at 8.\nThe standard set forth above is in essence that set forth by\nthe United States Supreme Court in Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S.\n307, 322-23 (1982).  In Youngberg, the Supreme Court held that an\nindividual  committed  to  a  state  institution  for  the  mentally\nretarded  “is  entitled  to  minimally  adequate  training\n[habilitation].”7  Id. at 322.  The Court explained as follows:\n7The Court interchanges “training” and “habilitation” and references the\nAmerican Psychiatric Association definition of habilitation: “The word\nhabilitation, . . . is commonly used to refer to programs for the mentally-\nretarded because mental retardation is . . . a learning disability and\n11\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 12 of 32(cid:10)\n[T]he  minimally  adequate  training  required  by  the\nConstitution is such training as may be reasonable in\nlight of respondent’s liberty interests in safety and\nfreedom from unreasonable restraints.  In determining\nwhat is ‘reasonable’. . . we emphasize that courts must\nshow deference to the judgment exercised by a qualified\nprofessional.  .  .  .  [T]he  decision,  if  made  by  a\nprofessional, is presumptively valid; liability may be\nimposed only when the decision by the professional is\nsuch a substantial departure from accepted professional\njudgment, practice, or standards as to demonstrate that\nthe person responsible actually did not base the decision\non such a judgment.  \nId. at 322-23.\nFurthermore, the Supreme Court cited approvingly the concurring\nopinion of the Chief Judge of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals\nthat “the Constitution only requires that the courts make certain\nthat  professional  judgment  in  fact  was  exercised.    It  is  not\nappropriate  for  the  courts  to  specify  which  of  several\nprofessionally acceptable choices should have been made.”  Id. at\n321.\nThe Second Circuit, in analyzing the Youngberg decision, agreed\nwith the result suggested by Justice Blackmun’s concurring opinion\n“that an individual has a due process right to training sufficient\nto prevent basic self-care skills from deteriorating.”  Society for\nGood  Will  to  Retarded  Children  v.  Cuomo,  737  F.2d  1239,  1250\n(1984).  “[P]rofessional judgment” is a standard that assesses\n“whether a particular decision has substantially met professionally\ntraining impairment rather than an illness.  [T]he principal focus of\nhabilitation is upon training and development of needed skills.”  Youngberg at\n309 (alterations in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n12\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 13 of 32(cid:10)\naccepted minimum standards.”  Id. at 1248.  Constitutional norms\nare not to be determined by the “professional judgment” of experts\nat  trial;  rather,  “constitutional  standards  are  met  when  the\nprofessional who made a decision exercised ‘professional judgment’\nat the time the decision was made.”  Id.  “The ultimate issue is\nwhether patients’ basic liberty interests are being safeguarded,\nnot whether the optimal course of treatment as determined by some\nexperts is being followed.”  Id.  \nThus,  residents  of  STS  are  entitled  to  minimally  adequate\nhabilitation services to safeguard their basic liberty interests,\nnot optimal services, and in deciding what is reasonable, this\nCourt must show deference to the judgment of STS professionals in\nimplementing Communication Services under the Remedial Plan absent\na showing that their decisions are “a substantial departure from\naccepted  professional  judgment,  practice,  or  standards.”\nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 323.8  \nThe  Scope  of  Work  for  Consultant  Review  of  Communication\nServices explicitly stated that the expert reviewer would make,\nunder  a  particular  Court  Requirement  Evaluation  Criterion,  a\ndetermination of whether the professional judgment exercised by the\nSTS  staff  was  not  such  a  substantial  departure  from  accepted\nprofessional standards, opinion or practice as to show that the\n8The Court assumes that in meeting the requirements of the Remedial\nPlan, Consent Decree and Implementation Plan with regard to the Communication\nServices aspect of Habilitation, the Defendants meet the constitutional\nminimum requirement regarding the provision of training [habilitation].\n13\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 14 of 32(cid:10)\ndecision was not based on such professional standards.  See Report\nto the Court No. 21 (Revised) at 7-8.  The Master found that\nDefendants did not provide “minimally adequate habilitation.”  The\nMaster notes that Dr. Calculator’s reports found that “services do\nnot meet professionally adequate standards for meeting the needs of\nthe clients” at STS.  See Report at 13-14.  And, as the Master\nnotes,  Dr.  Reichle  and  Dr.  Calculator  found  staffing  to  be\n“substantially insufficient.”  Report at 15.  However, neither the\nSpecial Master nor his expert reviewers found that the provision of\nCommunication Services at STS was a “substantial departure” from\naccepted professional standards. \nIn commenting on the compliance findings of the experts, the\nSpecial  Master  determines  that  the  evidence  from  Defendants’\nexpert,  Dr.  Paul  Cascella,  “is  not  particularly  useful  in\ndetermining compliance.”  Report at 12.  The Special Master finds\nthat  Cascella  did  not  seek  to  demonstrate  that  Communication\nServices were provided with “minimal professional standards,” and\nthat Cascella failed to “look behind STS’ evaluation of clients’\nneeds”  and  showed  “blind  uncritical  deference”  to  Defendants’\nprofessional judgments.  Id. at 13.  The Special Master notes that\nDr. Calculator explicitly addressed compliance with the Remedial\nPlan, and that his evidence is persuasive. Id.  \n14\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 15 of 32(cid:10)\nStaffing \nThe Special Master concludes that the number of professional\nspeech-language pathologists at STS is insufficient.  He finds that\nthe “credible expert reports and testimony” and findings from “two\nexperts  of  unquestioned credentials” (the Special  Master’s two\nexpert  reviewers,  Drs.  Calculator  and  Reichle)  establish  that\nprofessional staff should be doubled to meet minimal standards.\nReport at 2.  He notes further that Dr. Calculator had expressed\nconcern over the staffing levels at STS as far back as 1999, and\nthat  Dr.  Reichle  found  the  speech-language  pathology  staff  to\nclient  ratio  “not  acceptable  by  any  reasonable  standard  of\nservice.”  Report at 16, 24-25.  Dr. Calculator suggested that\nadditional SLP staff would allow the following: 1) an increased\npresence of SLPs in day programs and residences; 2) a more active\nrole of SLPs in client programs; 3) an increased number of teaching\nstrategies for clients; and 4) more active monitoring of programs.\nReport at 25-26.  The Special Master recommends that the Court\norder  the  addition  of  3  SLPs  to  enable  these  same  “service\nimprovements.”  Report at 3.  However, 1) neither expert conducted\na staffing needs assessment before making these determinations; 2)\nneither expert cited a professional standard regarding ratios or\nstaffing levels from which Defendants were substantially departing;\n3) neither expert cited a single case where a resident of STS\nfailed to receive speech-language services and the professional\n15\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 16 of 32(cid:10)\nstaff failed to provide an “appropriate level of therapy” under CR\n27; and 4) neither the Consent Decree, the Implementation Plan nor\nthe Court Requirements in the Remedial Plan set forth a particular\nspeech-language  pathologist-to-client  ratio  or  require  such\n“service improvements.”  The Court finds no reason to discount Dr.\nCascella’s reports and testimony as not credible, and notes that\nhis credentials were similarly never in question.  The Special\nMaster  faults  Dr.  Cascella  for  not  examining  the  workload  or\nresponsibilities of the professional communications staff, Report\nat 13, but the Scope of Work for Consultant Review of Habilitation\ndoes not entail an examination of workload or responsibilities.\nFurthermore, neither Dr. Calculator nor Dr. Reichle examined the\nworkload or responsibilities of the SLPs.  Dr. Calculator’s June\n2003 report suggests that the addition of SLP staff will lead to a\nproportionate increase in the number of teaching strategies at STS.\nReport Vol. 3 at 209 (United States’ Exh. 1).9  And, Dr. Calculator\nconcluded, without any individual assessment, that the large number\nof  residents  at  STS  not  using  any  form  of  augmentative  and\nalternative  communication  (AAC)  evidenced  a  violation  of  the\nprofessional principle that individuals for whom speech is not a\n9Dr. Calculator backed away from this claim on cross-examination.\nAnd, in his October 2001 report, Dr. Calculator stated that the majority of\nfiles he had reviewed did not contain communications teaching strategies. \nDefendants reviewed the same 13 files and found that: 1) seven of the files\ndid contain teaching strategies; 2)three files contained recent evaluations\nindicating no need for a teaching strategy; and 3) the remaining three\nresidents were verbal and could communicate clearly, obviating the need for\ncommunication teaching strategies.  Report Vol. 3 at 22 (Defendants’ Exh. 3). \n16\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 17 of 32(cid:10)\nviable method of communication should be considered candidates for\nAAC.  Report Vol. 3 at 214 (United States’ Exh. 1).  Dr. Calculator\ntestified that he has no knowledge of anyone at STS who was not\nconsidered for AAC, and that there was no professional literature\nregarding the percentage of residents at STS who should have been\nusing AAC to which he could refer.  Report Vol. 1 § III at 83.  Dr.\nCascella  and  Defendants’  SLP  staff  testified  that  teaching\nstrategies  and  the  use  of  AAC  must  be  based  upon  individual\nassessment of residents.  Thus, a compliance determination based,\ninter  alia,  on  assumptions  that  such  individuals  were  never\nconsidered for AAC without an individual assessment or without\ninquiring of STS professional staff whether they were evaluated, is\nof little use to the Court.10  The opinions of Drs. Reichle and\nCalculator with regard to the provision of Communication Services\nat STS reflect dissatisfaction with the service delivery model at\nSTS  and  a  preference  for  interventions  that  would  be  more\nconsistent  with  a “direct service” model.11  The Remedial Plan\n10See Report Vol. 1 § III at 68: Dr. Calculator’s June 2003 report\nqueried as to why Charles K. was “not having a more complex AAC system with\nvoice output” and “would he benefit from picture software.”  However, Dr.\nCalculator neither evaluated Charles K. nor inquired of any SLP whether or how\nhe had been evaluated for AAC needs.  \nSimilarly, Dr. Calculator’s observation that it was problematic that 39\nAAC devices remained unused in storage is not helpful for compliance\ndetermination without evidence that any individual needing and potentially\nbenefitting from such a device was denied the opportunity to be trained on or\nuse such a device.\n11Dr. Calculator’s dissatisfaction with the model at STS is evidenced in\nhis statement that he found the model of service delivery at STS was\ninconsistent with accepted practice.  Report Vol. 1 § III at 156.\nWhen asked if he thought the staffing of SLPs was sufficient, he\nanswered that it was not adequate in order to do everything that had been\n17\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 18 of 32(cid:10)\nrequires no specific model of service delivery.  See Report to the\nCourt No. 21 (Revised), Remedial Plan Court Requirement 27.  Dr.\nCascella testified that “Southbury has a model for doing person-\ncentered  individualized  communication  assessment,  communication\nprogramming, and that system needs to be respected.”  Report Vol.\n1 § II at 80.12  It is inappropriate for the Court to determine\nwhich  of  several  professionally  acceptable  choices  in  service\ndelivery should be made.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 321.\nrecommended [by him].  Report Vol. 1 § III at 154. \nThe communication services system at STS can be described as a modified\nconsultative/collaborative model.  The model is consultative to the extent\nthat service recommendations are made based upon evaluations by SLPs and\nresidential support staff are primarily responsible for implementing\nhabilitation programs.  The model is collaborative in that interdisciplinary\nteam members work together to provide a range of communication services to\nmeet the individual’s needs.  Report Vol. 1 § I at 99-100; Report Vol. 2 § IV\nat 161-62, 199-200.  In contrast, a direct service model usually employs a\nSpeech-Language Pathologist working one-on-one or in small groups with an\nindividual, most often on a weekly basis.  Report Vol. 1 § I at 100.  The\nconsultation model is found across most work settings that employ Speech-\nLanguage Pathologists.  Report Vol. 3 at 153 (Defendants’ Exh. 13).\nSee also Report Vol. 1 § III at 72-73.  There are numerous instances\nwhere Dr. Calculator made suggestions for service improvements for which he\ncould cite no professional standards to support such suggestions and which\nwere above and beyond the requirements of the Remedial Plan.  For example, Dr.\nCalculator criticized STS for typically failing to complete a follow-up\nevaluation on a resident after an evaluation had already been completed and\nthere was a subsequent referral, yet he could cite to no specific instances\nwhere that occurred nor could he cite to any professional standard that\nrequired such action.  Among other service improvements he found necessary for\ncompliance but for which he could cite no professional standard nor any Court\nRequirement were: “[a]ll referrals to the communications department will\nprompt a visit by the SLP to the day habilitation and/or residential program;\nand “[a]nytime a change in program is implemented, the SLP will visit the\nclient’s day program and residence to initiate the new program.”  \n12As Cascella noted, a communication assessment looks at the individual,\nexamining care-giver patterns, environmental factors, the opportunities that\nare given to people to communicate, whether people are given opportunities to\nparticipate in making decisions about their own life, and whether\ncommunication training or intervention can give them that capacity.  Report\nVol. 1 § II at 78-79.\n18\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 19 of 32(cid:10)\nWith regard to staffing needs, the Special Master notes that\nthe Director of STS Clinical Services, Nedra Navage, acknowledged\nthat  the  needs  of  an  aging  population  at  STS  may  result  in\nincreased speech therapy needs.  Report at 21.  However, in his\nFebruary  2001  review  of  Communication  Services,  the  Master’s\nconsultant,  Dr.  Calculator,  stated  that  “[a]s  the  population\ncontinues  to  age,  the  need  for  communication  services  may\ndiminish.”  Report Vol. 3 at 233 (United States’ Exh. 2).  Dr.\nCalculator explains this as follows:\n[T]here  are  many  senior  citizens  at  STS  whose\ncommunication skills have not changed in years, despite\nintervention, and whose skills  are adequate  in their\nresidences and day programs. Rather than implementing\ncommunication  interventions,  these  individuals  would\nbenefit more from participation in social groups, where\ncommunication is integrated for purposes of enhancing the\npleasure they receive from social interactions.  There\nare also individuals with severely limited communication\nskills, whose skills have not changed in years despite\nvarious forms of intervention.  Once this is documented,\nthere may not be a need for communication services other\nthan those provided in conjunction with the OPS review\n(the same would hold for some members of the elderly\npopulation).  In the event of a change in communication\nstatus/ability, either positive or negative, these same\nindividuals would become priorities for communication\nservices.\nReport Vol. 3 at 233.\nAnd, even if the aging population at STS develops increased speech\ntherapy needs, there was no evidence presented that more staff\nwould be required to meet those needs.  \nAt the time of the hearings, STS had 4.5 full-time-equivalent\n(“FTE”) SLP positions authorized in the Communications Department.\n19\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 20 of 32(cid:10)\nOne position was vacant, so there were 3.5 FTEs.  See Report Vol.\n2, § V at 207.  The Special Master adjusted these hours to account\nfor the administrative duties of Linda Kane-Hahn, the Supervisor of\nthe Communications Department, and calculated a FTE figure of 2.8.\nSee Report Vol. 2, § V at 208.  Defendants’ latest Quarterly Report\nstates that one full-time SLP position has remained open since\nAugust of 2005, with recruitment efforts ongoing, and one position\nwas filled in November of 2005.   See Thirty-Fourth Quarterly\nCompliance Report [Doc. No. 1387].  Nedra Nevage, the Director of\nHealth  Services,  testified  at  the  hearing  that  STS  has  had\ndifficulties  recruiting  SLPs  for  the  Communication  Department\nbecause  there  are  not  many  speech  and  language  professionals\ninterested in working with the population at STS.  Report Vol. 2 §\nV at 23-24.  The Court recently ordered Defendants to provide\nupdated and detailed information on the efforts to recruit and hire\na Speech-Language Pathologist to fill the vacancy created in August\nof  2005  [Doc.  No.  1394].    Defendants  have  submitted  such\ninformation, and the Court is satisfied that such efforts show full\ncompliance  with  the  requirements  of  CR  27.    See  Defendants’\nResponse to Order Dated March 8, 2006 [Doc. No. 1395].13  The Court\n13When fully staffed, STS has a complement of 4.5 FTE SLPs.  Since STS\nhas found it difficult to recruit a half-time SLP, they have been working\nsince May 2005 to fill 5.0 FTE positions.  Defendants have worked with a\nnational contractor to advertise and recruit for SLP positions, and that\ncontractor has placed advertisements in the professional journals serving SLPs\nas well as engaged in direct marketing to a few thousand SLPs in New England\nand the Northeastern United States.  The contractor has also used a telephone\nbank to contact approximately 500 SLPs a week to solicit interest in working\nfor the contractor (who would then provide the SLP service to STS).  The SLP\n20\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 21 of 32(cid:10)\nexpects that Defendants shall continue to make their best efforts\nto fill  vacancies, as they arise, up to the level of 5.0 FTE\nSpeech-Language Pathologists.  \nAt the hearings, the Communications Department Supervisor Linda\nKane-Hahn testified that, in her professional opinion, STS has\nmaintained compliance with the Court Requirements pertaining to\nCommunication Services, and that current staffing meets the needs\nof the residents at STS, based on her own experience and feedback\nfrom her staff of SLPs.  Report Vol. 2 § V at 183, Report Vol. 3 at\n179 (Defendants’ Exh. 16).  One of the SLPs, Carleen Bell, stated\nthat  Communication  Services  at  STS  meet  accepted  professional\nstandards, and she and her colleagues are responsive to the needs\nof the STS residents, meet their job requirements and have no\nproblems keeping up-to-date with their work.  See Report Vol. 1 §\nII  at  139-140,  203,  218-219.    Another  SLP,  Victoria  Murren,\ntestified that the model of service provision at STS serves the\nresidents’ best interests, and that STS is in compliance with the\nCourt Requirements.  Report Vol. 2 § VI at 107-108; Report Vol. 1\n§ II at 278.  While acknowledging this testimony, the Special\nwho began work in November of 2005 resigned in February of 2006, leaving a\nvacancy of 1.5 FTEs.  Subsequently, Defendants received the curriculum vitae\nfor another SLP from the contracting agency, and Defendants have represented\nthat they expect that candidate will shortly join the Communications staff,\nleaving a 0.5 FTE vacancy.  Defendants will continue to recruit for another\nfull-time-equivalent SLP to bring the complement up to 5.0 FTEs, and maintain\nthat all speech-language needs of the residents at STS are being met in\naccordance with accepted professional standards in the interim.  Defendants\nbelieve a complement of 5.0 FTEs will allow them to “significantly exceed\naccepted professional standards, as has always been the goal of STS.”  \nDefendants’ Response to Order Dated March 8, 2006 at 1-4.\n21\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 22 of 32(cid:10)\nMaster gives more weight to the statement of a “Communications\nDepartment staff person” that, with their larger caseloads, SLPs\nare unable to spend adequate time in cottages and are “spread\npretty thin.”  Report at 23.  That staff person is Jim Grenier, a\nsupport staff person in the Communications Department, referred to\nelsewhere  in  the  Master’s  Report  as  someone  who  “is  not  a\nprofessional; his highest education is high school.”  Report at 19.\nGrenier is not an SLP and his opinion that SLPs are spread thin\ndoes  not  equal  evidence  of  non-compliance  with  the  Court\nRequirements.  The Master also credits the testimony of Dr. Michael\nNeiman, a contracted part-time SLP, and finds that “Dr. Neiman\ntestified  that  SLP  staffing  at  the  time  of  the  hearing  was\ninsufficient, [stating] ‘I feel that the addition of some more\nstaff would be beneficial.’”  Report at 24.  The Court finds no\nevidence in the record that Dr. Neiman testified that staffing was\ninsufficient.  Dr. Neiman did testify that the addition of more\nstaff  would  be  beneficial,  and  when  asked  how  many  additional\npositions  STS  would  need  to  provide  appropriate  and  timely\ncommunication services, he stated: “I would say, in addition to the\ncurrent clinical staff which comprises Linda Kane-Hahn, Carleen\nBell and Victoria Murren, another full-time position . . . so an\nadditional 35 hours, whether it be somebody else 35 or would that\ninclude me plus whoever else could supplement that to equal 35.”\nReport Vol. 2 § IV at 44-47.  At the time of the hearing, Ms. Kane-\n22\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 23 of 32(cid:10)\nHahn’s position was 30 hours per week, and both Ms. Bell and Ms.\nMurren were full-time at 35 hours.  Clearly, Dr. Neiman’s opinion\nwas that the addition of one FTE position would be beneficial, as\nit would bring STS up to three full-time SLPs in addition to Ms.\nKane-Hahn,  not  that  additional  staff  beyond  the  authorized\ncomplement was needed.  Even if Dr. Neiman had meant that the\naddition of staff beyond the authorized complement of 4.5 FTEs was\nbeneficial, neither the Remedial Plan nor the Youngberg standard\nrequire  the  addition  of speech-language  pathology  staff  simply\nbecause it would be beneficial.  \nThe Master found that Defendants’ expert Dr. Cascella was in\nagreement with Drs. Calculator and Reichle that a needs assessment\nwas required to determine how many SLPs are needed at STS.  The\nMaster also found that Drs. Calculator and Reichle determined that,\nat a minimum, the number of SLPs on staff had to be doubled to meet\nminimal standards of service, prior to any determination through a\nneeds assessment.  Report at 24.  Dr. Cascella did opine that a\nneeds assessment should occur, but his testimony was that such a\nneeds assessment was not required for or related to a finding of\ncompliance  with  the  Court  Requirements  of  the  Remedial  Plan\npertaining to Communication Services.  See Report Vol. 1 § II at\n115.    Neither  Dr.  Calculator  nor  Dr.  Reichle  cited  to  any\nprofessional  standard  from  which  Defendants  were  substantially\ndeparting  to  justify  doubling  the  number  of  Speech-Language\n23\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 24 of 32(cid:10)\nPathologists at STS.\nFormal Fidelity Mechanism\nThe Special Master concludes that STS has no mechanism “at any\nlevel” to ensure or demonstrate that communications programs are\nappropriately implemented.  Report at 17, 27.  He finds that “a\ncommunications  program  in  an  OPS  is  meaningless  unless  it  is\nfaithfully implemented and the speech/language professionals. . .\ncan  depend  on  the  reliability  of  staff  reports  of  both\nimplementation and the client’s response to the program.”  Report\nat 15.   He further asserts that the Defendants’ expert witness Dr.\nCascella, the Special Master’s consultants and STS staff all state\nthat there is no method in place at STS to ensure fidelity and\nreliability of communications programs, and that such a system\nshould be put in place.  Report at 15, 17.  \nCourt  Requirements  43,  44  and  52  do  not  require  a  formal\nfidelity mechanism with regard to Communication Services, or any\nparticular  type  of  system  to  ensure  fidelity  and  reliability.\nTraining Programs under CR 43 must be evaluated at least yearly to\nensure that the opportunities provided are those defined in each\nresident’s Overall Plan of Service (OPS).  Day Programs under CR 44\nmust be developed, implemented and evaluated to ensure they meet\neach resident’s individual needs.  Training Programs under CR 52\nmust be consistently implemented to protect residents from risks to\npersonal  safety  and  unreasonable  restraint.    Defendants  can\n24\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 25 of 32(cid:10)\nevaluate the effectiveness of the programs under CR 52 through both\nstaff interviews and sample observations.  See Remedial Plan at\n232a, 233, 250a.  Beyond these strictures, the professionals in the\nCommunications Department must determine how best to carry through\nthese requirements based on their professional opinion.  \nAt STS, each resident is assigned to a specific Speech-Language\nPathologist’s caseload.  A functional communication assessment is\nconducted on each resident at least every five years by an SLP,\nmore often if a referral is requested.  Report Vol. 2 § V at 143-\n44.  SLPs receive referrals from numerous sources, including the\nInterdisciplinary  Team  (IDT),  direct  care  staff,  and  program\nsupervisors.  Report Vol. 3 at 145 (Defendants’ Exh. 12).  Contrary\nto Dr. Calculator’s observation, the evidence established that SLPs\nregularly visit residents at cottages and day program sites and\nalways personally observe residents when conducting communications\nassessments.  Report Vol. 3 at 145 (Defendants’ Exh. 12), 181\n(Defendants’ Exh. 16).   A functional communication assessment tool\nwas developed in response to the suggestions in Dr. Calculator’s\n1999  report,  and  both  he  and  the  Special  Master  commended\nDefendants for developing the tool and Dr. Calculator suggested STS\nconsider  publishing  the  tool.    Report  Vol.  2  §  V  at  127-28.\nFourteenth Quarterly Report at 12 [Doc. No. 544].  From early 2001\nuntil the time of the Communications hearing, the Communications\nDepartment  at  STS  conducted  approximately  511  evaluations  of\n25\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 26 of 32(cid:10)\nresidents using this tool.  Report Vol. 2 § V at 249-251.  If the\nconclusion  of  a  particular  evaluation  is  that  a  resident  will\nbenefit  from  a  teaching  strategy,14  and  the  recommendation  is\napproved by the IDT, the SLP provides the support staff with the\nbehavioral objectives, rationale and basic steps for the teaching\nstrategy.  Report Vol. 2 § V at 137-38.  The support staff then\nwrites  out  a  teaching  strategy  which  is  subsequently  edited,\nreviewed and approved by the SLP.  Id.  See also Report Vol. 2 § V\nat  35.    The  data  for  teaching  strategies  and  AAC  systems  is\ncompiled monthly from each cottage and entered into the Quarterly\nReview form; Jim Grenier notifies SLPs if there are any anomalies.\nReport Vol. 2 § IV at 88-89; Report Vol. 3 at 177 (Defendants’ Exh.\n14).  The SLPs review both the tabulated data and the raw data and\nverify the data recorded by the direct care staff on a quarterly\nbasis.  That review is part of the OPS process.15  Report Vol. 1 §\nII at 258-260; Report Vol. 3 at 144 (Defendants’ Exh. 12).\nThe Master and Plaintiff United States are correct that, in his\ntestimony, Dr. Cascella agreed that it would be a good practice to\nhave a fidelity mechanism.  But, he did not find such a mechanism\n14A “teaching strategy” is designed to teach a person a new\ncommunication skill that is not in their current repertoire.  In contrast,\nperson-specific communication guidelines are developed to ensure that staff\nwill make sure the resident’s existing skills are actualized throughout an\nindividual’s daily routine.  Report Vol. 1 § I at 45.\n15Under the OPS process, the residential team reviews the habilitation\nprograms for all residents annually, including communication services plans. \nAdditionally, the teaching strategies and other communications guidelines for\na particular resident are reviewed by the IDT on a quarterly basis.  These are\nalso the OPS guidelines for ICF/MR facilities.  Report Vol. 1 § I at 27.  \n26\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 27 of 32(cid:10)\nwas  required  under  the  Remedial  Plan  Court  Requirements.    He\nexpressed concern that there was no staff person “specifically\nwatching staff implement teaching strategies,” but this was not\nlinked to a specific Court Requirement.  Report Vol. 1 § I at 96.\nSee also Report Vol. 1 § II at 103-04.  The Court agrees that such\na mechanism would be a good practice, but it is not required to\nfind compliance.  The Master asked Cascella to clarify whether or\nnot such oversight was required under CR 52, to which Cascella\nreplied:  “[I]f  you  look  at  the  overall  plan  of  service  in  a\nquarterly review process, you would learn . . . how consistent\nplans are being implemented.”  Id. at 97.  Dr. Cascella went on to\ntestify that, although he expressed disappointment that no formal\noversight mechanism regarding teaching strategies was in place,\n“there are other mechanisms in place that guarantee the consistent\nimplementation . . . there are many other mechanisms in place that\nmonitored communication programs.”  Id. \nDr. Cascella noted at least eight methods of quality assurance\nat STS, in addition to the annual and quarterly review process,\nincluding: 1) new and ongoing training procedures for communication\nhabilitation,  which  include  proactive  methods  for  supporting\ncommunication  in  residential  and  vocational  settings;  2)  a\nresidential program monitoring and quality assurance form which is\ncompleted by residential supervisors based on monthly observations\nof staff that document particular quality of service indicators\n27\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 28 of 32(cid:10)\nincluding  communication;  3)  a  “family  group  system”  requiring\nresidential  staff  members  to  review  and  sign  off  on  OPS\ndocumentation  quarterly,  including  teaching  strategies;  4)  a\nQuality  Management  Council,  whose  discussions  include  issues\nrelating  to  habilitation  services  and  which  meets  monthly;  5)\nQuality Improvement teams which review habilitation issues on the\nunit level quarterly; 6) a Program Review Committee which meets\ntwice per month and provides oversight of behavior habilitation\nplans; 7) monthly Quality Enhancement Reviews which assess the\nquality of residential and day services; and 8) a facility-wide\nmonthly “report card” where the Office of Quality Enhancement and\nthe Quality Management Council review residential data documenting\nreferrals and follow-up sessions for habilitation.  Report Vol. 3\nat 71-73 (Defendants’ Exh. 6).16  In asking STS staff to detail the\nteaching  strategies  employed  for  individual  residents  of  STS,\nCascella found that “the staff members had a good working knowledge\nof the communication teaching strategies, . . . person-specific\nguidelines, and that they had a level of sensitivity regarding the\nways in which the residents communicated, and they were readily\nable to interpret idiosyncratic actions and assign communication\nvalue to those.”  Report Vol. 1 § II at 67-68.\nIn his testimony, Dr. Calculator agreed with Dr. Cascella that\n16Cascella also noted that, in his experience with New York and\nConnecticut institutions and group home agencies, he has not seen more quality\nassurance measures than those in place at STS.  Report Vol. 1 § I at 86. \n28\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 29 of 32(cid:10)\nclients are receiving services as defined in their OPS and that\nnone of Dr. Cascella’s opinions are inconsistent with accepted\nprofessional  standards.    Report  Vol.  1  §  III  at  32-34.    Dr.\nCalculator could point to no needed service that was not provided,\nnor  could  he  show  one  person  who  should  have  had  a  teaching\nstrategy at STS but did not have one.  Report Vol. 1 § III at 58.\nDr.  Calculator  had  recommended,  in  finding  “partial”  non-\ncompliance, that STS “conduct reliability checks in day programs or\n. . . residences one time per month” but he agreed that there was\nno  written  standard  to  which  he  could  cite  to  support  such  a\nrecommendation.  Report Vol. 1 § III at 63-64.\nThe Special Master stated that a communications program is\nmeaningless unless it is faithfully implemented and the SLPs can\ndepend on the reliability of staff reports as to its implementation\nand the client’s response.  There was no evidence presented at the\nhearings that any of the programs were not being implemented as\nintended by the SLPs or that the SLPs could not depend on the\nreliability of staff reporting. \nCompliance with Specific Court Requirements Pertaining to the\nCommunication Services Aspect of Habilitation\nUnder the Remedial Plan, STS must show compliance with the\nfollowing  Court  Requirements  as  they  pertain  to  Communication\nServices: CR 27 Occupational, Physical and Speech Therapy; CR 43\nTraining Programs (EC 3, 4); CR 44 Day/Vocational Programs (EC 1-\n3); and CR 52 Implementation of Training Programs (EC 3, 4).  The\n29\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 30 of 32(cid:10)\nSpecial Master made no specific findings for each of these Court\nRequirements.  Upon a de novo review of the record, the Court finds\ncompliance  with  each  Court  Requirement  as  it  pertains  to  the\nCommunication Services aspect of Habilitation.  Nothing at the\nhearing or in the record casts doubt on Defendants’ self reporting\nof  compliance.    There  was  no  evidence  presented  that  training\nprograms were not provided or evaluated under CR 43, or that all\nresidents who need day programs are not provided with such or are\nnot provided with a program that meets their individual needs under\nCR 44,17 or that training programs are not evaluated or consistently\nimplemented  under  CR  52.    All  residents  receive  the  mandated\ncommunications  evaluation  every  five  years  or  sooner,  the  OPS\nprocess evaluates and reviews residents’ training needs yearly,\nall those who need day programs are in one that has been designed\nto meet their needs, and a variety of Quality Assurance mechanisms\nguarantee  consistent  implementation  of  programs  under  CR  52.\nReport Vol. 3 at 71-74 (Defendants’ Exh. 6), 185 (Defendants’ Exh.\n19); Report Vol. 1 § I at 27.  Furthermore, STS has implemented\nmany of the recommendations made by Dr. Calculator, including the\nrevision of the communication assessment tool, the creation of sign\n17Dr. Cascella’s review of communication services with regard to CR 44\ndetermined that more than 99% of STS residents participate in a day program:\nin 2003, 173 residents attended day programs off-campus, 450 residents\nattended a day program at STS, 15 residents had home-bound programs, and 5\nresidents did not attend a day program.  Report Vol. 3 at 74 (Defendants’ Exh.\n6).  As Cascella noted, the IDT meets annually and quarterly to determine if\neach resident’s day program needs are being met.\n30\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 31 of 32(cid:10)\nlanguage books for individual residents, and expansion of the AAC\ninventory  and  database.    Ms.  Nevage  stated  that  these\nrecommendations were implemented to improve Communication Services\nat STS beyond the requirements in the Remedial Plan, but were not\nunderstood to be necessary to achieve compliance with the Court\nRequirements.  Report Vol. 3 at 186 (Defendants’ Exh. 19).  \nConclusion\nThe Court finds that, after reviewing the record in light of\nthe  Court  Requirements  under  the  Remedial  Plan  and  the\nConstitutional standard, STS has not substantially departed from\naccepted professional standards in the provision of Communication\nServices  to  the  residents  of  STS  and  has  been  in  sustained\ncompliance  with  the  Court  Requirements  in  the  Remedial  Plan\npertaining to Communication Services.  Therefore, this Court must\ndefer to the professional judgment of the staff at STS under its\nmodified consultative-collaborative model.  “The ultimate issue is\nwhether patients’ basic liberty interests are being safeguarded,\nnot whether the optimal course of treatment as determined by some\nexperts is being followed.”  Society for Good Will to Retarded\nChildren, 737 F.2d at 1248.  The Court is assured that the liberty\ninterests of the residents at Southbury Training School are being\nsafeguarded with regard to the Communication Services aspect of\nHabilitation  as  envisioned  under  the  Consent  Decree,  the\nImplementation Plan, the Remedial Plan and all associated orders.\n31\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1404     Filed 03/23/2006     Page 32 of 32(cid:10)\nAll Remedial Plan Court Requirements related to the Communication\nServices aspect of Habilitation are hereby RELEASED from active\njudicial oversight.\nSO ORDERED.\n______________________________\nELLEN BREE BURNS, SENIOR JUDGE\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nDated at New Haven, CT, this ____ day of March, 2006.\n32",

As discussed,  at pp. 26-36,  infra,  the district  court’s\norder  finding  Connecticut  in contempt  and stating  its intent  to\nappoint  a special  master  is not appealable,  either as a final\njudgment  under 28 U.S.C.  1291, or as an interlocutory  order that\ngrants  or modifies  an injunction  under  28 U.S.C.  1292(a)  (i). \nOctober  30, 1996, the United  States  filed  its motion  to dismiss\nthe appeal.  On December  12, 1996,  this Court  denied  the motion\nwithout  prejudice,  and permitted  the United  States  to raise the\nissue  before the panel  assigned  to review  the case on the merits.\n\n- 2 -\nSTATEMENT  OF THE ISSUES\n1. Whether  this Court  has appellate  jurisdiction  over  a\ndistrict  court  order  that finds a defendant  in civil contempt  of\nits Remedial  Orders,  but only  states  its intent  to appoint  a\nspecial  master to ensure  compliance  in the future.\n2. Whether  the district  court  abused  its discretion  in\nfinding  the State  of Connecticut  in civil contempt  of the court’s\nRemedial  Orders.\n3. Whether  the district  court  abused  its discretion  in\nstating  its intent to appoint  a special  master.\nSTATEMENT  OF THE CASE\nA. The Complaint  And Remedial  Orders.\nOn September  ii, 1985,  the United  States  filed  a complaint\nagainst  the State  of Connectdcut,  its Governor,  the Commissioner\nof the Department  of Mental  Retardation,  and the Director  of the\nSouthbury  Training  School  (Connecticut),  pursuant  to the Civil\nRights  of Institutionalized  Persons  Act (CRIPA),  42 U.S.C.  1997\ni! Southbury  is an institution  for persons\ne_!t  ~ (J.A.  l).-\nwith  developmental  disabilities  in Connecticut.  At the time of\nthe hearing  on contempt,  Southbury  housed  843 residents  (J.A. 238\n& n.l).  The complaint  alleged,  ’nt~  alia,  that  Connecticut  is\nfailing  to: (i) provide  residents  of Southbury  with  adequate\nmedical  care;  (2) provide  Southbury  residents  with training\n%.\n~!  \"J.A.  \" refers  to  the  Joint  Appendix.  \"R.  \" refers  to\nthe docket  number  assigned  a document  filed  in the district\ncourt.  \"Tr.  ,, refers  to the  transcript  of the  hearing.  \"Conn.\nBr.  ,, refers  to Connecticut’s  brief.  \"Am~  Br.  ,, refers  to\nthe brief  of the Amicus  Curiae,  Martha  Dwyer,  et el.\n\n- 3\nnecessary  to preveht  undue risks to the~\" , rsonal  safety;  (3)\nprotect  Southbury  residents  from unreasonable  risks  of harm\ncaused  by staff  and other residents;  and (4) ensure  that\nmedications  are prescribed  and administered  to Southbury\nresidents  pursuant  to the exercise  of professional  judgment  by\nqualified  professionals  and not in lieu of training  programs\n(J.A. 1-6).\nThe United  States  and Connecticut  entered  into a Consent\nDecree,  which the district  court  approved  on December  22, 1986\n(R. 35).  The Consent  Decree  sets forth  several  requirements  with\nwhich Connecticut  must comply  in order to provide  Southbury\nresidents  with the level of psychological  services,  medical  care,\nand physical  therapy  that is secured  and protected  by the United\nStates  Constitution  (J.A.  10-11).  Pursuant  to the terms  of the\nDecree,  Connecticut  proposed  an Implementation  Plan in 1987,\nwhich provides  the steps  and procedures  that Connecticut  would\ntake to comply  with the mandates  of the Decree  (J.A.  31). The\nUnited  States  and Connecticut  agreed  to amendments  to that plan\nand the district  court approved  the amended  plan as an order of\nthe court  on July 22, 1988 (J.A.  27). The parties  stipulated \ntwo additional  court orders  on April 24, 1990,  and December  9,\n1991 (J.A.  147, 189).  In its order  finding  Connecticut  in civil\ncontempt,  the district  court  refers  to the Decree,  Implementation\nPlan, and stipulations  as the \"Remedial  Orders,, (J.A. 239 & n.4) \nThe provisions  of the Remedial  \"~rders  that are pertinent  to the\ncontempt  motion are as follows.\n\n- 4 -\nI. The Cgnsent  Decree.  Part  I provides  that  \"the  purposes\nand objectives  of this Consent  Decree  are to establish  within  the\ntimelines  set forth [in the Decree]  * * * conditions  at\n[Southbury]  * * * to ensure  that residents  at [Southbury]  are not\nbeing deprived  of rights,  privileges  or immunities  secured  to\nthem by the Constitution  of the United  States\"  (J.A.  ii).  Those\nrights,  privileges  and immunities  include:  \"[t]raining  programs\nprofessionally  designed  to reduce  or eliminate  unreasonable  risks\nto personal  safety  or unreasonable  use of restraints\";\n\"[a]dequate  medical  care [for] all residents  pursuant  to the\nexercise  of professional  judgment  by a qualified  professional\";\nand \"[r]estraints,  seclusion  procedures  and behavior  modifying\nmedications,  when appropriate,  must  be administered  safely  and\npursuant  to the exercise  of professional  judgment\"  (J.A. 12).\nPart I concludes  by providing  that the purposes  and objectives\n\"shall  be achieved  * * * by implementing  the requirements  set\nforth in Parts  III and IV\" and \"by developing  and implementing\nthe plans described  in Part V of [the] Consent  Decree’,  (J.A. 13).\nPart IIi of the Decree  requires  that Connecticut  immediately\ncorrect certain conditions, .9_~g=., provide a sufficient  number of\nnurses  and direct  care  workers  (J.A.  15). Part  IV requires\ncertain  ratios  of professional  staff  to number  of residents  by\n% certain  deadlines  (J.A.  17).  Part V orders  Connecticut  to submit\nplans  \"for implementing  th[e]  Consent  Decree.,’  Such plans must\ninclude:\n(a)  Part  V(3):  \"[P]rocedures  to be utilized \nprovide  regular,  periodic  professional  evaluations  of\nn~  ..i\n\n- 5 -\neach resident  in order to identify  those  in need of\ntraining  programs;  and (b) to provide  a sufficient\nnumber  of training  program  hours to each resident\"  who\nneeds  such  training  (J.A.  18). A \"[t]raining\n[p]rogram\"  is \"[a] program  of steps and activities,\nincluding  behavior  management  and the teaching  of basic\nself-care  skills,  determined  by a qualified\nprofessional  consistent  with professional  judgment  to\nbe necessary  to protect  a resident  from unreasonable\nrisks to personal  safety  and to facilitate  his or her\nability  to function  free from undue restraint\"  (J.A.\n14).\n(b) Part  V(5):  \"Recordkeeping  systems,  policies, \nprocedures  with respect  to each patient’s  care,  medical\ntreatment,  and required  training  that shall be utilized\nto maintain  and make available  in each resident’s\nrecord  such information  as is professionally  necessary\nto permit  the exercise  of professional  judument  in that\nresident’s  car~, medical  trea!ment,  and traininq\"  (J.A.\n19). Professional  judgment  is \"[a]  decision  by \nqualified  professional  that is not such a substantial\ndeparture  from accepted  professional  * * * standards  as\nto demonstrate  that the person  responsible  did not bas~\nthe decision  on such Drofessionai  opinion,  practice,  or\nstandards\"  (J.A. 15) (emphasis  added).\n(c) Part  V(6):  \"[M]easures  that will  be undertaken \nprovide  adequate  medical  care,  including  evaluation  of\nresidents  with physical  disabilities  and the specific\nsteps that will be undertaken  to provlde  appropriat~\n~edicBl  and physical  therapy  services  to_prevent\ncontractures,  physical  deqeneration,  and inappropriate\nbody .srowth and deformity\"  (J.A. 19) (emphasis  added).\n(d) Part  V(8):  \"[P]olicies  and procedures  * ~ \nprovide  that restraints  [and] behavior  modifying\nmedications  * * * (a) are administered  only pursuant \nthe judgment  of a qualified  professional;  and (b) are\nnot to be used as punishment,  in lieu of training\nprograms\"  (J.A. 20).\n(e) Part  V(9):  \"[P]rocedures  that  will  be utilized \nprovide  that residents  shall  be protected  from\nunreasonable  risks  of bodily  harm to their personal\nsafety  by the conduct  of staff or other residents\"\n(J.A. 20).\nThe Decree  requires  also that Connecticut  submit  quarterly\ncompliance  reports  (J.A. 23).\n\n- 6 -\n2. ~he  Impl~mentation  Pl~n.  The  Plan  begins  by stating\nthat it was (J.A. 35):\ndeveloped  to assure  that residents  of the Southbury\nTraining  School  are not deprived  of rights,  privileges,\nor immunities  secured  by the Constitution  of the United\nStates,  including:  appropriate  training  programs;\nfreedom  from unreasonable  restraint;  adequate  medical\ncare; and an environment  that is safe and free from\nunreasonable  risks of harm.\nThe Plan is organized  into four  areas:  (I) staffing  requirements\nto comply  with Part Ill of the Decree;  (2) program  development\nand implementation  to satisfy  Part V(2)-(4);  (3) comprehensive\nprograms  to meet Part  V(5)-(8);  and (4) safe conditions  to \nwith Part  V(9)  & (i0)  (J.A.  35).  Appended  to and incorporated\nwithin  the Implementation  Plan  are policies  that the Connecticut\nDepartment  of Mental  Retardation  began  implementing  in May 1986.\nThose  policies  set forth the rights  of the residents  at\nSouthbury,  which  explicitly  include  the general  rights  and\nprivileges  provided  under  the Constitution,  as well as special\nrights  such  as: (a) \"[a]ppropriate  treatment,  services,  and\nhabilitation,,;  (b) \"[p]rograms  that maximize  each resident’s\ndevelopmental  potential,,;  (c) \"[f]reedom  from physical \nchemical  restraint  employed  as a punishment  or as a substitute\nfor a habilitation  program,,;  and (d) \"[p]rompt,  sufficient,  and\nappropriate  medical  and dental  treatment\"  (J.A. 107).\nThe Appendix  also provides  that each resident  will have an\nOverall  Plan of Services  (OPS),  which \"shall  encourage\nintegration  of the client into normalized  settings,,  and \"be\ndeveloped  in keeping  with accepted  principles  in the field of\n\n- 7 -\nmental  retardation\"  (J.A.  118).  Connecticut’s  provision  of OPS\nas set forth  in the Appendix  to the Implementation  Plan is\nintended  to comply  with Part V(3) of the Consent  Decree,  which\nrequires  that Southbury  residents  receive  adequate  training\nprograms  (J.A. 35, 63).\nEach OPS must include,  ~nter  alia:  (i) a list  of the\nresident’s  strengths  and needs;  (2) a list of prioritized  goals;\n(3) \"for each goal,  behavioral  objectives  * * * that are\nobjectively  measurable;  (4) for each objective,  \"a teaching\nstrategy  detailing  what the staff will do to assist  the client  to\naccomplish  new skills  or behaviors\";  and (5) evaluation\nprocedures  to determine  whether  the teaching  strategies  are\nassisting  clients  to accomplish  objectives  (J.A. 118).\nThe policy  also requires  an interdisciplinary  team to\ndevelop  and regularly  review  the OPS provided  to each resident\n(J.A.  121).  The team \"will  be convened  whenever  a significant\nchange in [a resident’s]  situation  warrants  a revision  of the\nOPS\" (J.A.  123).  Substantial  changes  in a resident’s  OPS require\n\"formal  agreement  and documentation  by the team\" (J.A. 123).\nAll sections  of the Plan were reviewed  and approved  by the\nCommissioner  of the Connecticut  Department  of Mental  Retardation\nand the Director  of the Southbury  Training  School  (J.A. 36).\n3. The 1990  And 1991 Stipulations. These Stipulations,  in\npertinent  part, require  Connecticut  to:\n(a)  1990 Stipulation  I~F):  provide  \"appropriate\nphysical  therapy  to each resident  with physical\nhandicaps  for whom a program  of physical  therapy  has\nbeen ordered  by a qualified  professional,  and ensure\n\n- 8 -\nrecords  of such treatment  are made and entered  in the\nresident’s  medical  record\"  (J.A. 150).\n(b)  1990Stipulation  I(G):  provide  a \"qualified\nphysician  [to] assess  each resident  with physical\ndisabilities  to determine  whether  a physical  therapy\nprogram  should  be initiated  or an existing  physical\ntherapy  program  modified  to prevent  contractures,\nphysical  degeneration,  and inappropriate  body growth\nand deformity.  The physician  shall  refer  those\nresidents  for whom such need is identified  to a\nregistered  physical  therapist\"  (J.A. 150).\n(c) 1990  Stipulation  ~(V):  \"implement  the  existing\nPlan  of Implementation  to assure  that:  (i) such\ntraining  programs  as are needed  to protect  residents\nfrom unreasonable  risks to their  personal  safety  and\nfrom unreasonable  bodily  restraints  are consistently\nimplemented;  (2) recordkeeping  systems  are implemented\nwith  respect  to each resident’s  course  of training  so\nas to ensure  that  sufficient  relevant  information\nregarding  training  is maintained  * * * and (3)\nrestraints  * * * are not used * * * in lieu of a\nprescribed  training  program\"  (J.A. 155-156).\n(d) !990  Stipulation  l(W):  \"(I)  develop,  implement,\nand, thereafter,  regularly  evaluate,  a system  for\nobserving  and recording  observations  regarding  client\nbehavior  relevant  to training  programs,  and (2) develop\nand implement  a system  to verify  that the data are\nreliable,, (J.A. 156).\n(e) ~991  Stipulation  I(A):  establish  a permanent\ncommittee  of doctoral  level psychology  staff that,\nevery 30 days,  reviews  the implementation  of training\nprograms  for each  \"at risk\"  resident.  \"[A]t  risk\"\nresidents  are those  who receive  behavior  modification\nmedications,  exhibit  self-injurious  or aggressive\nbehavior,  are subject  to aversive  programming,  or are\notherwise  thought  to be at risk  (J.A.  189).  \"Where  ***\ncontinuation  of the training  or treatment  program  is\notherwise  not justified,  the matter  shall be referred\nto the appropriate  Interdisciplinary  Team, which  shall\nwithin  30 days from the referral,  modify  the existing\n[training]  program  in accordance  with professional\njudgment  of qualified  professionals\"  (J.A. 190, 193).\n(f)  ~991  Stipulation  I(B):  implement  a Consolidated\nBehavior  Review  Plan that requires  (J.A,  190), inter\nalia, an interdisciplinary  team to review and upd-~-~e\nOPS to reflect  client  needs  and status  of training\nprograms for \"at risk’, clients (J.A. 190-193).\n\n- 9 -\nB. The Evidence  05 Connecticut’s  Contempt.\nIn support  of its application  for an order  to show cause  why\nConnecticut  should  not be held in contempt,  the United  States\nprovided:  (i) testimony  and reports  from  its experts,  Dr. Renee\nWachtel,  Dr. Alan Harchik,  and Ms. Susan Harryman,  experts  in the\nareas of behavioral  psychology,  medicine,  and physical  therapy,\nrespectively  (J.A. 263, 321, 392); (2) reports  from Connecticut’s\nexperts  Dr. Fred Volkmar,  expert  in the area of child psychiatry,\nand Dr. James Walker,  Dr. Henry Schneiderman,  Ms. Rhea Sanford,\nand Ms. Karen Green McGowan;  (3) selected  Southbury  mortality\nreviews;  and (4) internal  investigative  reports  (J.A.  734-791).\nI. Medical  Services.  The United  States  presented  evidence\nthat Connecticut’s  inadequate  medical  treatment  caused  or\ncontributed  to the deaths  of six Southbury  residents.  For\nexample,  in her November  1993 report,  Dr. Wachtel  discussed  how\ninternal  reports  of the September  1992 death of a Southbury\nresident  named John T. showed  \"numerous  omissions  and commissions\nin the provisions  of adequate  medical  and nursing  care\" (J.A.\n505).  One  report  found  that:  (I) the medical  management  of John\nT. from August 21 to September  i, 1992, was \"plagued  with medical\nflaws  that may have contributed  to precipitating  [his] death\"\n(J.A. 780);  (2) \"[u]pon  return  to [Southbury]  in a debilitated\nbut stable  condition,  John’s evaluation  by his [primary  care\nphysician]  failed  to assess  and address  important  aspects  of his\nmedical  condition\"  (J.A.  780); and (3) while on August  30, \nT. had a \"life threatening\"  level of Dilantin  in his bloodstream,\n\n- i0 -\nthe Southbury  staff  failed  to assess  the magnitude  of the problem\nand transfer  him to the local  hospital  where appropriate  measures\nto reduce  the amount  of Dilantin  could have been taken (J.A.\n783).  John T. lost  consciousness  in the evening  of August  31,\n1992,  and died in the morning  of September  1 (J.A. 784).\nDuring  the hearing,  Dr. Wachtel  testified  about  five other\nresidents  who died between  May and July 1995 and might  not have\ndied had they received  the adequate  follow-up,  monitoring,\ntreatment,  and protection  from unreasonable  risk of harm that the\nRemedial  Orders  require:  (I) John  E. (J.A.  280-281);  (2) Vincent\nS. (J.A.  283-286);  (3) Marilyn  C. (J.A. 286);  (4) Richard \n(J.A. 291-294);  and (5) Jose M. (J.A. \nFor example,  Dr. Wachtel  discussed  serious  inadequacies  in\nVincent  S.’s  treatment.  The most serious  was the physician’s\ndecision  that Vincent  S. receive  a tracheostomy  or a tube in the\nwindpipe  to correct  his problems  with aspiration  (J.A.  284-285).\nThe physician  opted  for a tracheostomy  instead  of inserting  a\nfeeding  tube on the ground  that \"Mr. S. gets some satisfaction  or\njoy from eating  and I would  not favor  [a tube in the small\nintestine]\"  (J.A.  285).  According  to Dr. Wachtel,  the\ntracheostomy  required  making  a hole in his windpipe,  which is \"a\nmuch more medically  invasive  and much more medically  at risk\nprocedure  than just putting  a feeding  tube in him\" (J.A.  285).\nVincent  S. died of aspiration  shortly  after  the tracheostomy.  At\na minimum,  a second  opinion  should  have been obtained,  because\nless  risky  proceaures  are available.  In Dr. Wachtel’s  opinion,\n\n- II -\nVincent  S. would have lived  longer  if he had not had that risky\nprocedure  (J.A. 286).\nJose M. was another  resident  who received  delayed  diagnosis\nand treatment  from Southbury  and died soon after being\ntransferred  to a hospital  (J.A.  295-296).  He became  sick  on May\n19, 1995,  with \"fever,  vomiting  and * * * stools  that had blood\nin them\"  (J.A.  295).  He continued  with  those  symptoms  until  the\nnext day when a physician  noted \"harsh breath[ing]  sounds,,,  but\ndidn’t  recommend  a chest  x-ray  (J.A.  295).  The next  day a nurse\nindicated  that a physician  had seen him, but \"there’s  no\nphysician  note\"  (J.A.  295).  On May 22, he had sounds  in his\nlungs that indicated  pneumonia;  he was given oxygen  and\ntransported  to the hospital  (J.A.  295).  But there  are no notes\nin his medical  record  about his vital  signs or treatment  that was\nperformed,  until  he left for the hospital.  He died  on May 23\n(J.A. 295).\nDr. Wachtel  also presented  evidence  in her November  1993\nreport  and in her testimony  of additional  examples  in the\ntreatment  of Southbury  residents  that showed  Connecticut’s\nviolation  of several  provisions  of the Remedial  Orders.  In her\nreport,  Dr. Wachtel  discussed  three  individuals  who died while\nresidents  at Southbury  and whose medical  records  were either\ninadequate  or indicated  inadequate  treatment:  (i) A.R.’s  records\nwere unclear  as to whether  any significant  intervention  had been\nmade to prevent  further  pneumonia  (J.A. 489); (2) J.D.’s  records\nshowed no follow-up  after she had received  a gastronomy  (J.A.\n\n- 12 -\n491); E.S.’s  records  showed  no consultations  for appropriate\nspecialties  regarding  her recurrent  pneumonia  (J.A.  493).\nFurther,  Dr. Wachtel  testified  about  ii other Southbury\nresidents  who had not died,  but whose  records  revealed  serious\nlapses  in medical  care that in many cases  caused  residents  long-\nterm suffering  (Tr. 36, 43, 51, 53, 55, 58, 60, 62, 63, 75, 81).\nFor instance,  Walter  N. suffered  from a skin disorder  and injured\nhimself  by scratching  so much that he had \"two new open areas  on\nthe right side  of his neck that go to the front and back of the\nopen  existing  area\"  (J.A.  276).  The resident  was first  seen by \ndermatologist  in May 1992 (J.A.  277).  But the resident  was not\nseen again  by a dermatologist  until  more than three  years later\nin July 1995  (J.A.  276-277).  Dr. Wachtel  found  that  adequate\n\"reconsultation  with a dermatologist  would [have  probably]\nprovided  for more effective  management  of his dry skin and\nitching and perhaps  lessened  his self-injury,,  (J.A. 277).\nDr. Wachtel  determined  that Connecticut  was deficient  in six\ncategories  that are relevant  to the provision  of medical  care:\n(i) \"delay  in diagnosis  and treatment,,;  (2) \"inadequate  diagnosis\nand treatment\";  (3) \"inadequate  follow-up  and monitoring,,;  (4)\n\"inadequate  records,,;  (5) \"inadequate  communication,,  between\nSouthbury  medical  professionals  and nearby  acute care hospitals;\nand (6) inadequate  protection  of Southbury  residents  from harm\n(J.A.  269).  In Dr. Wachtel’s  opinion,  Connecticut’s  deficiencies\nin these areas were \"deviations  from accepted  professional\npractice  and current  standards,,  (J.A. 270).\n\n- 13 -\nDr. Wachtel  further  concluded  that Connecticut  failed  to\ncomply  with,  in~r  alia:  (I) Part  I(3)  of the 1986  Consent\nDecree,  which  requires  Connecticut  to provide  adequate  medical\ncare (J.A. 300);  (2) Part V(4) of the 1986 Consent  Decree, \nrequires  Connecticut  to provide  the \"procedures  to be utilized  to\nreasonably  ensure  there is consultation  and communication  of\nrelevant  information  * * * regarding  residents’  care,  training\nneeds  and priorities\"  (J.A. 301);  (3) Part V(5) of the \nConsent  Decree,  which  requires  Connecticut  to set forth record\nkeeping  procedures  \"as is professionally  necessary  to permit  the\nexercise  of professional  judgment  in that resident’s  care,\nmedical  treatment  and training,,  (J.A. 301); and (4) \nImplementation  Plan’s  requirements  that residents  receive\n\"prompt,  sufficient  and appropriate  * * * treatment\"  (J.A. 305).\n2. Psycholg.g~cal  Services.  In his report,  Dr. Harchik\nstated  that each resident’s  Overall  Plan of Services  (OPS) should\ninclude  assessment,  planning,  teaching  procedures,\nimplementation,  and monitoring  of progress  (J.A.  695).  Those\nactivities  are critical  for any training  program  that is\n\"determined  by a qualified  professional  consistent  with\nprofessional  judgment  to be necessary  to protect  a resident  from\nunreasonable  risks  to personal  safety\"  (J.A.  695).  Dr. Harchik\nfound,  however,  that while professional  standards  require  that\nregular,  periodic  assessments  of resident  maladaptive  behavior  be\nconducted,  of the 21 OPS plans  that he reviewed,  none referred  to\nany such assessments  (J.A.  695).  \"IT]here  was little  relation\n\n- 14 -\nbetween  the analyses  and the treatment  procedures’,  (J.A. 697).\nIn many cases,  \"no progress  was observed  or regression  was\noccurring  and no further  analysis  was done\" (J.A.  697).\nEach OPS is supposed  to provide  instructions  for teaching  of\nalternative  behaviors  to replace  problem  behaviors  and an\nindividualized  system  of positive  reinforcement  (J.A.  697).  Few\nof the OPS plans  that Dr. Harchik  reviewed,  however,  provided\nalternative  skills  to compete  with behavior  problems  (J.A.  698).\n\"More troubling  is the lack of positive  reinforcement  in the\nbehavior  plans\"  (J.A.  698).  \"The way that  positive  reinforcement\nis (and is not) used at STS demonstrates  that the psychology\nstaff  * * * ha[s] a total lack of understanding  of positive\nreinforcement,,  (J.A. 698).\nDuring  the hearing,  Dr. Harchik  presented  several  examples\nof residents  whose  OPS either  failed  to include  an appropriate\nbehavioz  assessment  or lacked  a treatment  plan to address  that\nassessment.  For instance,  he discussed  the September  1994\ninvestigative  report  prepared  by Thomas  Harmon  (J.A. 524-569),\nconcerning  the death  of Stanley  B. (J.A.  406-407).  Southbury’s\nstaff was well aware that Stanley  B. was a careless  smoker  who,\nwhether  he smoked  cigarettes  or a pipe,  often  burned  holes  in his\nclothing  (J.A.  535).  In 1989,  Stanley  B.’s OPS noted  that \nneeded  to learn  how to smoke  his pipe safely  (J.A.  533).  The\ngoals  of the instruction  included  teaching  him how to pack his\npipe  and empty  the tobacco  when finished  smoking  (J.A.  536).  The\nexpected  date for achieving  this goal was March 1990 (J.A.  536).\n\n- 15 -\nIn 1993, however,  Stanley  B.’s OPS did not provide  any\ninstruction  to the ~taff  regarding  his smoking  habits  or his need\nfor supervision  while  smoking  (J.A.  533).  His records  do not\nprovide  any explanation  why he was no longer  being taught  how to\nsmoke  safely  (J.A.  537).  On April  2, 1994,  Stanley  B.’s  clothing\ncaught  fire while  he was smoking.  As a result,  he suffered  burns\nto half his body, and died later that evening  (J.A. 526).\nDr. Harchik  discussed  several  examples  of residents  who\nexhibited  maladaptive  behaviors,  such as severe  self-injurious\nbehavior,  including  head-banging,  intentional  vomiting  (J.A. 410-\n412), ingesting  metallic  objects  (Tr. 359) and dangerous\nsubstances  such as bleach  (Tr. 353) or aggressive  behavior\ntowards  other  residents  (J.A.  418).  But Southbury  had failed \ndevelop  appropriate  behavior  plans to correct  such maladaptive\nbehavior,  thereby  allowing  such behavior  to perpetuate  (J.A. 410-\n419).  For instance,  Dr. Harchik  described  a resident  named  Mary\nJane, who had sores,  cuts,  and injuries  on the cheeks  of her face\nbecause  she was gouging  herself  (J.A.  418).  He noticed  that when\nMary Jane walked  past about 20-30  other residents,  the residents\ncowered  from her, probably  because  Mary Jane had been aggressive\ntowards  them (J.A.  419).  Her behavior  assessment  indicates  that\nshe becomes  aggressive  from boredom  (J.A.  419).  But there  was \nsystematic  positive  reinforcement  program  and there was nothing\nspecific  about what skills  should  be taught  to Mary Jane to train\nher to no longer  exhibit  aggressive  behavior  (J.A. 420).\n\n- 16 -\nIn Dr. Harchik’s  opinion,  the  failure  of Connecticut  to\nprovide  adequate  behavior  assessments  and  training  programs  in\nresidents’  OPS plans  violated  Part  V(3)  of the 1986  Consent\nDecree,  which  requires  procedures  to be utilized  to provide\nregular,  periodic  professional  evaluations  of each  resident  to\nidentify  those  in need  of training  programs  and  to ensure  a\nsufficient  number  of training  program  hours  (J.A.  18,  710).  Dr.\nHarchik  also  found  that  because  appropriate  training  programs  are\nnot being  provided  to residents,  restraints  and  behavior\nmodification  medications  are  relied  upon  inappropriately.\nTherefore,  the  failure  to provide  sufficient  OPS plans  also\ncaused  Connecticut  to violate  Part  V(8)  of the 1986  Consent\nDEcree,  which  prohibits  Connecticut  from  using  medications  as\npunishment  in lieu  of training  programs  (J.A.  711).\nDr.  Harchik  further  found  that  \"at least  half  of the\nbehavior  programs  that  [he]  reviewed  clearly  required\nmodification  because  no progress  was  occurring  or behaviors  were\nworsening,\"  but the  Quality  Assurance  reviews  performed  prior  to\nhis  report  did not  recommend  modification  of any  existing\nbehavior  plans  despite  worsening  maladaptive  behavibrs  (J.A.\n700).  Dr.  Harchik  concluded  that  Connecticut’s  failure  to modify\nbehavior  programs  as needed  to prevent  injury  violates  Parts  I(A)\n& (B) of the 1991  Stipulation,  which  require  Connecticut \nreview  and update  training  programs  for  residents  who exhibit\nself-injurious  behavior,  receive  behavior  modifying  medications,\nor are otherwise  considered  to be \"at  risk\"  (J.A.  712-713).\n\n- 17 -\nIn his report  (J.A.  702-703),  and also  at the hearing,  Dr.\nHarchik  explained  that  Connecticut  failed  to provide  Southbury’s\nresidents  with  sufficient  engagement  (J.A.  396).  Engagement \nactive  participation  in a meaningful  activity,  e._g~.,  putting\ntogether  a puzzle  or turning  pages  of a magazine  (ibid.).  It \"is\nimportant  because  it can serve  as a basis  for learning  new\nskills,  [and]  can provide  alternatives  to behavior  problems\"\n(J.A.  702).  One does  not  expect  all  residents  to be engaged  all\nthe  time.  At any  given  time,  however,  80% of residents  should  be\ninvolved  in meaningful  activities  (J.A.  398).  During  his  last\ntour  of Southbury  before  the hearing,  Dr.  Harchik  made\nobservations  of 592 residents  and found  that  only  44% of the\nresidents  were  engaged  (J.A.  399).  Of those  592 residents, \nfound  that  only  one was being  taught  a positive  habilitative\nskill  (ibid.).  In November  1993,  he made  a similar  examination\nof the  Southbury  residents’  leve?  of engagement  and found  that\nonly  31% were  engaged  (J.A.  400).  According  to Dr.  Harchik,\nConnecticut’s  failure  to keep  its  residents  engaged  was a\nviolation  of Part  V(3)  of the 1986  Consent  Decree,  which  requires\nConnecticut  to provide  adequate  training  programs  (J.A.  18).\nDuring  the hearing,  Dr. Harchik  concluded  that  Connecticut\nis violating  several  additional  Remedial  Orders,  inter  alia: (i)\nPart  I(1)  of the 1986  Consent  Decree,  which  requires  that\n\"’training  programs  be professionally  designed  to reduce  or\neliminate  risks  to personal  safety  or unreasonable  use  of\nrestraints’\"  (J.A.  427);  (2) Part  I(V)  of the 1990  Stipulation,\n\n- 18 -\nwhich  requires  that  Connecticut  implement  \"such  training  programs\nas are needed  to protect  residents  from  unreasonable  risks  to\ntheir  personal  safety  and  from  unreasonable  bodily  restraints\"\n(J.A.  428);  (3) Part  I(W)  of the 1990  Stipulation,  which  requires\nConnecticut  to:  (a)  \"[d]evelop  and  implement  and  thereafter\nregularly  evaluate  a system  for  observing  and recording\nobservations  regarding  client  behavior  relevant  to training\nprograms;  and  (b) [d]evelop  and  implement  a system  to verify  that\n[the]  data  are  reliable\"  (J.A.  428-429);  and (4)  Part  I(A) \n1991  Stipulation,  which  requires  Connecticut  to ,,’modify  the\nexisting  [training]  program  in accordance  with  professional\njudgment  * * * when  continuation  of the * * * program,  is\notherwise  not  justified’\"  (J.A.  429).  Dr.  Harchik  testified  also\nthat  Connecticut’s  provision  of psychological  and habilitative\nservices  is a \"substantial  departure  from  acceptable  professional\nstandards\"  (J.A.  430-431).\n3. Physical  Therapy  Services.\nMs.  Harryman  toured  Southbury  in 1990,  1992,  1993,  and 1995\n(J.A.  324).  After  each  of those  tours  she  found  that  physical\ntherapy  services  at Southbury  \"did  not meet  current  professional\nstandards  and did  not  comply  with  court  orders  requiring  adequate\nphysical  therapy  services\"  (J.A.  325).  Appropriate  physical\ntherapy  is necessary  to prevent  those  with  developmental\ndisabilities  from  acquiring  inappropriate  body  growth,  deformity,\nphysical  degeneration,  and  contractures  (i.e.,  inability  to bend\na joint  through  a full  range  of motion)  (J.A.  330).\n\n- 19 -\nOf the 73 Southbury  residents  whom  Ms.  Harryman  visited,  64\nneeded  services  from  a physical  therapist  (J.A.  337).  Of those\n64, only  two received  services  from  a licensed  physical  therapist\n(J.A.  337).  Southbury  Cottages  7A and  42 house  the  residents\nwith  the  most  significant  motor  disabilities  (J.A.  337).  Not  one\nof the residents  at those  cottages,  however,  received  the\nservices  of a physical  therapist  (J.A.  337).  In one  case,  Dr.\nHarryman  reviewed  the  record  of Marilyn  S., who  had suffered  a\nstroke  on June  i0,  1995  (J.A°  338).  Her medical  files  showed\nthat  a physical  therapist  failed  to assess  her until  July  17,\n1995  (J.A.  339).  Such  a delay  is a substantial  deviation  from\nthe  current  acceptable  professional  standards  (J.A.  339).\nThose  who are  confined  to wheelchairs  should  be assessed\nannually.  Absent  yearly  assessments,  physical  degeneration  will\ncontinue  to occur  and  deformities  will  increase  (J.A.  334). \nher last  tour  of Southbury,  Ms. Harryman  found  that  i0 out  of 57\nresidents  who are eomfined  to wheelchairs  had not had  an annual\nassessment  (J.A.  333-334).\nMs.  Harryman  also  testified  that  Connecticut’s  failure  to\nprovide  adequate  physical  therapy  services  resulted  in some\nresidents’  loss  of range  of motion  -- the  inability  to move  and\nbend  a joint  (J.A.  327),  and  loss  of function  -- the inability \nperform  a certain  activity  (J.A.  327).  The  results  of the  loss\nof an individual’s  range  of motion  can have  devastating  effects\non a resident’s  quality  of life.  For  instance,  Ms.  Harryman\ntestified  that  if a resident  loses  the ability  to sit  in a chair,\n\n- 20 -\nthe  person  is confined  to a bed  for  the rest  of his  or her life\n(J.A.  349).  One  of the residents  that  Ms.  Harryman  visited  was\nprecariously  close  to losing  her  ability  to sit in a chair,  yet\nshe  was not  receiving  any  physical  therapy  services  (J.A.  348-\n349).  Of the  73 residents  that  she  examined,  14 had  lost  range\nof motion  (J.A.  344).  The  records  of the  other  residents  whom\nshe examined  were  so deficient  that  Ms.  Harryman  could  not\ndocument  if they  had lost  \"range  of motion\"  (J.A.  344).\nMs. Harryman  also  found  that  20 of the  73 Southbury\nresidents  whom  she visited  had a documented  loss  of function\n(J.A.  349).  Further,  she found  that  Southbury  could  have  made\nefforts  to prevent  the  loss  of function  in 14 of those\nindividuals  (J.A.  350).  Of those  14 instances  in which  a loss \nfunction  could  have  been  prevented:  four  had  lost  the  ability  to\nroll  over,  which  means  that  a person  stays  in one position  while\nin bed,  which  can lead  to osteoporosis  and  problems  with  skin\nintegrity  (J.A.  351);  two  had lost  the ability  to maintain  their\nsitting  position  (J.A.  351);  four  had lost  the ability  to move\nfrom  their  wheelchairs  (J.A.  351);  and five  had lost  the skills\nenabling  them  to walk  with  a walker  (J.A.  353).  Ms.  Harryman\nfound  that  Connecticut’s  failure  to maintain  adequate  records  on\nloss  of motion  and  loss  of function  of Southbury  residents  was  a\nviolation  of current  professional  standards  (J.A.  345,  355).\nMs.  Harryman  concluded  that  Connecticut  was  violating\nseveral  requirements  of the  Remedial  Orders  that  are relevant  to\nthe provision  of physical  therapy  services  (J.A.  355,  359-369),\n\n- 21 -\nincluding:  (i)  Section  V(5)  of the 1986  Consent  Decree,  which\nrequires  recordkeeping  procedures  \"as is professionally  necessary\nto permit  the  exercise  of professional  judgment  [in]  that\nresident’s  care  and medical  treatment  and  training\"  (J.A.  360);\n(2) Section  V(6)  of the 1986  Consent  Decree,  which  requires\nConnecticut  to provide  adequate  medical  care  \"including\nevaluation  of residents  with  physical  disabilities  and * * *\nmedical  and physical  therapy  services  to prevent  contractures,\nphysical  degeneration  and inappropriate  body  growth  and\ndeformity\"  (J.A.  360-361);  and  (3) Appendix  A, page  2 of \nRevised  Implementation  Plan,  which  requires  Connecticut  to\nprovide  appropriate  treatment  services  and habilitation  (J.A.\n365).  In Dr.  Harryman’s  view,  the  deficiencies  in physical\ntherapy  services  \"were  all substantial  departures\"  from  current\nprofessional  accepted  standards  (J.A.  369).\nC. The  District  Court’s  Order.\ni. The  court  found  clear  and  convincing  evidence  that\nConnecticut  was in civil  contempt  of the court’s  Remedial  Orders\nin its provision  of psychological  services,  medical  care,  and\nphysical  therapy  (J.A.  238-262).  In explaining  its findings \ncontempt,  the court  cited  the  specific  requirements  that\nConnecticut  had  violated  and discussed  much,  though  not  all,  of\nthe evidence  that  supports  its  findings.  The  examples  that  the\ncourt  cited  in its  order  are from  the written  reports  of the\nexpert  witnesses  (J.A.  243-262).  The  court  noted  that  \"some \nthe most  compelling  evidence  came  from  the [State’s]  own experts\"\n\n- 22 -\n(J.A.  259  & n.35).  The  court  explained  that  while  Southbury’s\n,,quarterly  reports  reveal  that  it was in compliance  with  over  90%\nof the  Remedial  Orders’  requirements,\"  Connecticut  was not\n,,effectuating  the Remedial  Orders’  desired  results\"  (J.A.  259).\nThe court  further  found  that  Southbury’s  ,,systemic  flaws  have\ncaused  many  residents  to suffer  grave  harm,  and,  in several\ninstances,  death\"  (J.A.  259).\nIn the area  of psychological  services,  tne  court  found  that\nConnecticut  had violated  Part  I(1)  of the  1986  Decree,  which\nrequires  training  programs  designed  by qualified  professionals  to\nreduce  or eliminate  unreasonable  risks  to personal  safety  (J.A.\n(I)\n243).  The  court  accepted  Dr.  Harchik’s  evidence,  including:\nbehavior  assessments  in the  OPS plans  rarely  generate  useful\ninformation  (J.A.  243);  (2) the  OPS plans  do not provide\nresidents  with  training  programs  that  teach  ~kills  to prevent\nthem  from  harming  themselves  (J.A.  244-245);  (3)  Southbury  staff\nmembers  exhibit  a total  lack  of understanding  of positive\nreinforcement  (J.A.  247-248);  and (4)  Connecticut’s  failure \nmodify  behavior  plans  violates  the  Remedial  Orders  (J.A.  249).\nWith  regard  to medical  services,  the  c0urt cited  the\nrequirement  that  Connecticut  provide  medical  care  that  was\n,,pursuant  to the  exercise  of a qualified  professional,\"  found  in\nParts  I(3)  and (4);  and to provide  recordkeeping  procedures \npermit  the  exercise  of professional  judgment,  found  in Part  V(5)\n(J.A.  250  & n.18).  The  court  then  found,  inter  alia,  that \nreport  about  the  death  of resident  John  T. contained  \"appalling\n\n- 23 -\nexamples  of insufficient  medical  care,\"  and  systemic  5nadequacies\nthat  might  be \"sufficient  alone  to find  Connecticut  in contempt\nof the  Decrees\"  (J.A.  252).  Further,  the court  accepted  the\nfindings  of one  of Connecticut’s  experts  that  recordkeeping\nprocedures  are  below  professional  standards  and the  \"problem\nlists\"  were  inaccurate  and  incomplete.  The  problem  lists  are  a\n\"crucial  part  of effective  medical  care,\"  and are  \"utterly\nuseless\"  if inaccurate  (J.A.  252-253).\nIn the area  of physical  therapy,  the court  cited,  inter\nalia,  Part  V(6)  of the Consent  Decree,  which  requires  the\nprovision  of adequate  medical  care,  including  steps  to be taken\nto provide  physical  therapy  services  to prevent  contractures  and\ndeformities  (J.A.  256 & n.30).  The  court  then  credited  the\nevidence  presented  by Dr. Harryman  and found  that  Southbury’s\nfailure  to adequately  assess  its physical  therapy  services\n\"placed  the patients  at risk  of receiving  ineffective,  useless\nand  detrimental  therapy\"  (J.A.  258).  Indeed,  Southbury’s\n\"inadequate  physical  therapy  services  have  caused  several\nresidents  who,  only  a few  years  earlier,  were  ambulatory,  to be\npermanently  bed-ridden\"  (J.A.  258).  The court  also  accepted  Dr[\nHarryman’s  findings  that Southbury’s  ’,grossly  inadequate  staffing\nwas the primary  cause  of its poor  physical  therapy  services\"\n(J.A.  256).  The  court  further  found  that  Southbury  was  not\nadequately  assessing  its physical  therapy  services,  nor  did it\nprovide  guidelines  for determining  staff  competence  before\nallowing  the staff  to administer  such  services  (J.A.  257).\n\n- 24 -\n2. Because  of the  complex  nature  of the  case  and  the\n’,delicate  interests  of Southbury’s  residents,\"  the court\nannounced  its  intent  to appoint  a special  master  (J A. 261).  The\ncourt  authorized  the  masker  to appoint,  if necessary,  a panel\ncomprised  of experts  in the areas  of psychological  services,\nmedical  care,  and  physical  therapy  to assist  in making\nrecommendations  (J.A.  259-262).  The  court  specificall~  directed\nthe master  to (J.A.  262):\n(I) conduct  an immediate  and thorough  review  of all\naspects  of [Southbury’s]  care  and treatment  of\nresidents  covered  by the Remedial  Orders  to determine\nthe changes  needed  to meet  the Orders’  desired  ends;\n(2) formulate  specific  methods  to implement  the\nrequired  changes;  and (3)  work  with  the  parties \neffectuate  those  changes.\nThe parties  have  recommended  their  choices  as to who should  be\nappointed  master.  The court  has  not  yet  made  its  selection.\nSUMMARY  OF ARGUMENT\nThis  appeal  should  be dismissed  for lack  of jurisdiction.\nIt is well  Established  that  a finaing  of contempt,  absent  the\nimposition  of sanctions,  is not  a final  order.  Also,  it is\nwidely  recognized  that  an order  appointing  a special  master  is\nnot  appealable.  It follows  that  the  district  court’s  order,\nfinding  Connecticut  in civil  contempt  and  merely  stating  its\nintent  to appoint  a special  master  to ensure  Connecticut’s\ncompliance  with  the  Remedial  Orders,  is not a final  order  under\n28 U.S.C.  1291.\nNor is the court’s  order  appealable  under  28 U.S.C.\n1292(a)  (i) as an interlocutory  order  that  has the effect \n\n- 25 -\ngranting  or modifying  an injunction.  Thi3  Court  should  reject\nConnecticut’s  contention  that  the district  court  modified  the\nRemedial  Orders  by \"unilaterally\"  requiring  the  State  to meet  the\nPurposes  and  Objectives  set forth  in Part  I of the Consent\nDecree.  In its  1987  Implementation  Plan,  as well  as in several\nportions  of the Remedial  Orders,  Connecticut  expressly  agreed  to\nthe  requirements  found  in the Purposes  and Objectives  in Part  I\nof the Decree.\nAssuming,  arquendo,  that  this  Court  finds  that  it has\njurisdiction  to review  the order,  it should  affirm  the finding  of\ncivil  contempt  and  the decision  to appoint  a special  master.  As\nConnecticut  concedes,  several  provisions  of the Remedial  Orders\ncontain  specific  requirements  concerning  psychological  services,\nmedical  care,  and physical  therapy.  Contrary  to Connecticut’s\nclaim,  however,  the  requirements  that  the district  court  found\nConnecticut  had violated  are  contained  within  those  provisions.\nTherefore,  this  Court  should  find  that  the  orders  are clear  and\nunambiguous.  Moreover,  the  evidence  of Connecticut’s  contempt  of\nthose  provisions  is clear  and  convincing.  Contrary  to\nConnecticut’s  claim,  the  district  court  considered  whether  it had\nbeen  reasonably  diligent  in attempting  to comply  with  the\nRemedial  Orders.  The  record  of Connecticut’s  failure  to provide\nadequate  psychological  services,  medical  care,  and  physical\ntherapy  services  precludes  a finding  of reasonable  diligence.\nFinally,  the district  court’s  decision  to refer  the  review\nof Southbury’s  operations  to a special  master,  because  of the\n\n- 26 -\ncomplex  nature  of the  case  and  the  \"delicate  interests  of\nSouthbury’s  residents,\"  was  a proper  exercise  of its broad\nre~c~ia!  authority.\nARGUMENT\nI\nTHIS  COURT  SHOULD  DISMISS  THE\nAPPEAL  FOR LACK  OF JURISDICTION\nA. The  District  Court’s  Order  Is Not  A Final,  Appealable\nOrder  Under  28 U.S.C.  1291.\nSection  1291  of Title  28 provides  for appellate  review  of\nfinal  decisions  of district  courts.  \"[A]s  a general  rule  a\ndistrict  court’s  decision  is appealable  under  this  section  only\nwhen  the  decision  ’ends  the litigation  on the  merits  and  leaves\nnothing  for  the court  to do but execute  the judgment.’\"\nGulfstream  Aerospace  Corp-  v. Mayacamas  Corp..,  485 U.S.  271,  275\n(1988)  (quoting  Cat lin v. United  Sta~es,  324 U.S. 229,  233\n(1945));  see  also  15B Wright,  Miller,  & Cooper,  Federal  Practic~\n& Procedure  § 3916  at 349 (2d ed. 1992)  (,,[a]ppeal  ordinarily\nshould  not  be available  as to any particular  post-judgment\nproceeding  before  the trial  court  has reached  its  final\ndisposition\").\nThis  Court  has repeatedly  held  that  a finding  of contempt,\nabsent  the  imposition  of sanctions,  is not  a final  order.  In re\nFuaazy  Express,  Inc.,  982 F.2d  769,  775 (2d  Cir.  1992);  Dove \nAtlantic  Capital  CorD-,  963 F.2d  15, 17 (2d  Cir.  1992);  In \nIrvinq,  600  F.2d  1027,  1031  n.l (2d  Cir.),  cert.  denied,  444 U.S.\n\n- 27 -\n866  (1979);  Comptone  Co.  v.  ~~,  251  F.2d  487,  488  (2d\nCir. 1958).\nFor instance,  in Com~tone  Co.,  251  F.2d  at 488,  this  Court\nheld  that  an order  finding  a defendant  in contempt  and  indicating\nan intent  to enter  an injunction  e~ente  lite  is not  a final\nappealable  order.  The  Comptone  Court’s  rationale  was  that  \"no\npenalty  has been  imposed,  and  the contempt  order  remains  merely  a\nfinding,  without  judgment  thereon,  subject  to modification,  prior\nto judgment.\"  !bid.  And  in Dove,  which  involved  a finding  of\ncontempt  and a stay  of the imposition  of sanctions,  the  Court\nreiterated  the general  rule  that  a finding  of contempt  without\nthe imposition  of sanctions  is not final,  and  quoted  the Comptone\nCdo/urt’s  rationale  for that  principle,\nMoreover,  it is well-settled  that  an order  appointing  a\nspecial  master  is not  an appealable  order.  See  Deckert  v.\nIndependence  Shares  CorD._,  311 U.S. 282,  290-291  n.4 (1940);\nGrilli  v. Metropolitan  Life  Ins.  Co.,  78 F.3d  1533,  1538  (llth\nCir.),  cert.  denied,  117  S. Ct.  608 (1996);  Rosette  v. Rainbo\nRecord  Mfa.  CORD.,  546 F.2d  461,  462  (2d Cir.  1976);  H. M. Kolbe\n~ v.  Armqus  Textile  Co.,  315  F.2d  70,  75  (2d  Cir.  1963);  see\nU We recognize  that  this  Court  has  carved  an exception  to the\ngeneral  rule  in cases  in which  an appellant  is found  in contempt\nof  a discovery  order.  See,  e.a.,  Dove,  963  F.2d  at  18.  That\nexception,  however,  is not applicable  here.  This  case  does  not\ninvolve  noncompliance  with  a discovery  order;  rather,  the State\nis being  held  in contempt  for noncompliance  with  a consent\ndecree.  Further,  the  concern  In Dove,  that  the contemnor  was\nbeing  placed  in the difficult  position  of having  to choose\nbetween  contempt  and making  a disclosure  that  may cause  him harm,\ni_~.,  is not  present  here.\n\n- 28 -\nalso  9A Wright  & Miller,  Federal  Practice  & Procedure  § 2615  at\n707 (2d ed.  1995)  (,’[a]n  order  of reference  to a master  under\nRule  53 is interlocutory  and not  appealable  given  the final\njudgment  rule\").\nIt follows  from  these  decisions  that  the  court’s  order\nfinding  the defendants  in contempt  and announcing  its  intention\nto appoint  a special  master  is pot  a~pealable  as a f~nal  order\nunder  28 U.S.C.  1291.  In  this  case,  the  district  court’s  order\nfinding  the defendants  in contempt  and  merely  stating  its  intent\nto appoint  a master  is analogous  to a contempt  finding  and a stay\nof the  imposition  of sanctions.  As was the  case  in Comptone  Co.,\nthe court’s  order  is not final  as it is subject  to modification,\nand will  require  further  proceedings  before  Connecticut  is\nordered  to take  any  action  as a result  of the  finding  of\ncontempt.  Indeed,  it is inconceivable  that  the  order  could  be\ndeemed  final,  because  the court  has not  yet even  selected  the\nmaster  (J.A.  262).  Moreover,  the  order  contemplates  that  the\nspecial  master  will  undertake  a significant  factual  inquiry  into\nSouthbury’s  operations  (J.A.  262).  And  even  after  the  master\nmakes  recommendations,  further  litigation  may take  place,  as Fed.\n~. Civ.  P. 53(e)  provides  the parties  with  the  opportunity \nobject  to the special  master’s  findings  and  recommendations.\nFurthermore,  the  special  master’s  recommendations  will  not  be\nfinal  until  the  district  court  enters  those  recommendations  as an\norder  of the court.  See  Sick  v. City  of Buffalo,  574  F.2d  689,\n694 (2d  Cir.  1978)  (absent  review  of court,  mere  findings \n\n- 29 -\nrecommendations  of master  are a nullity  and nonappealable).\nAccordingly,  an order  finding  the defendant  in contempt  and\nmerely  announcing  an intent  to appoint  a special  master  is\nclearly  not a final  order.\nNor  does  the district  court’s  order  qualify  as an appealable\norder  under  the  Cohen  collateral  order  doctrine.  See  Cohen  v.\nBeneficial  Indus.  Loan  Corp.,  337  U.S.  541  (1949).  Collateral\norders  must  \"’conclusively  determine  the disputed  question,’\n’resolve  an important  issue  completely  separate  from  the merits\nof the  action,’  and  ’be effectively  unreviewabie  on appeal  from  a\nfinal  judgment.’\"  Richardson-Merrell,  Inc.  v. Koller,  472  U.S.\n424,  431 (1985)  (quoting  Coopers  & Lvbrand  v. Livesay,  437 U.S.\n463,  468 (1978));  see generally  Whalen  v. County  of Fulton,  19\nF.3d  828,  830 (2d Cir.  1994),  cert.  denied,  115  S. Ct. 722\n(1995).  The  court’s  order  does  not  meet  any  of these  criteria.\nAs discussed  at p. 28, su_up_ra,  the court’s  ~ntent to appoint\na special  master  does  not conclusively  determine  what  Connecticut\nmust  do to comply  with  its  orders  in the future.  Also,  the  order\nis not  separate  from  the  merits  of the  action.  Since  the issue\nat this  stage  is Connecticut’s  compliance  with  the court’s\nremedial  orders,  the finding  of contempt  and the  reference  to the\nspecial  master  are central  to the resolution  of the case.\nFurther,  the court’s  finding  of contempt  and its  decision  to\nappoint  a special  master  can be reviewed  once  an injunctive  or\nfinal  order  has been  entered.\n\n- 30 -\nIn response  to the  United  States’  motion  to dismiss  filed  on\nOctober  30, 1996, Connecticut  argued,  inter ali___aa,  that cases such\nas United  States  v. International  Brotherhood  of Teamsters,  12\nF.3d  360,  364 (2d  Cir.  1993);  United  States  v. Yonkers  Bd.  of\nEduc______~., 946 F.2d 180, 183 (2d Cir. 1991); and Kittitas Reclamation\nDist.  v. Sunn~sideVallev  Irriqation  Dist.,  763  F.2d  i032,  1034  &\nn.l  (9th  Cir.),  cert.  denied,  474 U.S.  1032  (1985),  support \nprinciple  that  in complex  litigation  cases,  an appellate  court\nshould  take  a more  flexible  approach  in determining  whether  a\ndistrict  court  order  is final  under  28 U.S.C.  1291.  None  of\nthose  cases,  however,  suggest  that  a flexible  interpretation  of\n28 U.S.C.  1291  should  be extended  to orders  that  merely  indicate\na court’s  intent  to appoint  a special  master.\nFurthermore,  contrary  to Connecticut’s  assertion,  United\nStates  v. O’Rourke,  943  F.2d  180 (2d  Cir.  1991),  is not analogous\nto this  case.  O’Rourke  involved  a finding  of contempt  as well  as\na final  determination  that  the  contemnor  would  pay  \"a fine  of\n$I,000,000,  plus  an additional  $I0,000  per day  from  the  date  of\nentry  of the order  until  compliance  therewith.\"  Id____~.  at 185. In\ncontrast  to O’Rourke,  here  there  has been  no final  determination\nconcerning  what  the  State  must  do to ensure  that  it complies  with\nthe Remedial  Orders  in the future.\nThis  Court  thus  lacks  jurisdiction  under  28 U.S.C.  1291  to\nreview  the district  court’s  order.\n\n- 31 -\nB. The District  Court’s  Order  Is Not  An Appealable\nInterlocutory  Ord c Under  28 U.S.C.  1292(a)  (ll.\nAn order  may be appealed  under  28 U.S.C.  1292(a)  (I) as \ninterlocutory  order  that  grants,  modifies,  or denies  injunctive\nrelief.  In Carson  v. American  Brands,  Inc.,  450 U.S.  79,  83\n(1981),  the  Supreme  Court  determined  that  the statute  was\nintended  as only  a limited  exception  to the finality  rule  and,\naccordingly,  articulated  a three-part  test  to determine  when\ninterlocutory  orders  could  be appealed.  Such  an order  must:  (I)\nhave  the practical  effect  of granting,  modifying,  or denying  an\ninjunction;  (2) have  \"serious,  perhaps  irreparable,\nconsequence[s]\";  and (3) be one that  can  be effectively\nchallenged only by immediate appeal. Id____~. at 84.\nThe  district  court’s  order  finding  the defendants  in\ncontempt  and merely  stating  its intent  to appoint  a special\nmaster  is not  an injunction,  express  or effective,  because  it is\npurely  procedural,  relating  only  to the  conduct  of the\nlitigation.  See  Gulfstream,  485 U.S.  at 279  (\"[a]n  order  by \nfederal  court  that  relates  only  to the conduct  or progress  of\nlitigation  before  that  court  ordinarily  is not  considered  an\ninjunction  and therefore  is not appealable  under  § 1292(a)  (I)\")\n(citations  omitted);  see also  Liddell  v.

Local  40, Int’l  Ass’n of Bridqe  Workers,\n76 F.3d  76, 79 (2d  Cir.  1996)  (appeal  allowed  as district  court\nextended  duration  of consent  decree  that,  by its  terms,  expired\nin 1983),  with  Wilder  v. Bernstein,  49 F.3d  69,  72 (2d Cir.  1995)\n(appeal  dismissed  as court  found  that  district  court’s  directive\nthat  defendants  \"ensure  that  the  protections  of the  consent\ndecree  are  extended  to children  in kinship  foster  care\"  was\nalready  within  scope  of the  consent  decree’s  mandates).\nIn this  case,  Connecticut  claims  (Conn.  Br. 9-10),  that  the\ndistrict  court  \"unilaterally  [rewrote]  the terms  of the  [Consent]\nDecree,  and  then  [held]  the defendants  in contempt  for failing  to\ncomply  with  those  terms.\"  Connecticut  contends  (ibid.)  that \nfinding  Connecticut  had violated  the  \"spirit\"  of the Remedial\nOrders,  the district  court  erred  by requiring  compliance  with  the\nPurposes  and  Objectives  provided  in Section  I of the  Consent\nDecree. ~! Connecticut  argues  that  the  Purposes  and  Objectives\nare  not injunctive  orders;  they  are  only  the  goals  of the Orders.\nAccording  to Connecticut,  the specific  requirements  with  which  it\n~/ In its  brief,  Connecticut  emphasizes  (Conn.  Br.  9) the\ndistrict  court’s  description  of the  State  as complying  with  the\n\"letter\"  of the  Decree,  but  not  its  \"spirit.\"  The  court  used\nthat  language  in describing  only  the  provision  of training\nprograms  in the  area  of psychological  services  (J.A.  243). \ndescribed  Connecticut’s  \"review\"  and \"modify ’~ procedures  as\nmeeting  the  \"letter\"  of the Decree,  but not  \"produc[ing]  the\nresults\"  intended  by the Decree  (J.A.  249).\n\n- 33 -\nis required  to comply  are  clearly  set  forth  in other  portions  of\nthe  Remedial  Orders,  such  as Sections  IV and  V of the Consent\nDecree  (id.  at i0).  Since,  as Connecticut  claims  (id.  at 12),\nthe injunctions  that  the district  court  found  Connecticut  had\nviolated  are  not set  forth  in such  sections,  the  district  court\nmodified  the Decree.\nThis  Court  should  reject  Connecticut’s  claim.  In the\nImplementation  Plan,  which  Connecticut  was required  to provide\n(J.A.  13),  Connecticut  expressly  agreed  to comply  with  the\nrequirements  set forth  in the Purpeses  and Objectives  in Part  I\nof the Decree.  Part  I of the  Decree  provides  that  the  Purpose  of\nthe  Decree  is to ensure  that  Southbury’s  residents  are  not being\ndeprived  of their  constitutional  rights,  and  describes  those\nrights  includin~  training  programs  developed  by qualified\nprofessionals  to eliminate  unreasonable  risks  to personal  safety;\nadequate  medical  care  that  is provided  pursuant  to the\nprofessional  judgmen~  of a qualified  professional;  and behavior\nmodification  medications  that  are administered  pursuant  to the\nprofessional  judgment  of a qualified  professional  (J.A.  12).\nIn the first  section  of the Plan entitled  ,,Development  of\nthe Plan,\"  Connecticut  states  that  the Plan  was  developed  to\nensure  that  residents  of the  Southbury  Training  School  are  not\ndeprived  of rights,  privilege~  or immunities  secured  by the\nConstitution,  ,,including:  appropriate  training  programs;  freedom\nfrom  unreasonable  restraint;  adequate  medical  care;  and an\nenvironment  that  is safe  and free  from  unreasonable  risks  of\n\n- 34 -\nharm\"  (J.A.  35).  The  very  next  section  of the  Plan  provides  that\n\"[a]ll  sections  of the  [I~plementation  Plan]  were  reviewed  and\napproved  by\" the  Commissioner  for  the  Department  of Mental\nRetardation  and the Director  of Southbury  (J.A.  36).\nFurther,  the Appendix  to the  Plan  contains  policies  that  the\nDepartment  of Mental  Retardation  began  implementing  in May  1986,\nbefore  entering  into  the  Consent  Decree  in July  1986.  Those\npolicies  are incorporated  within  the Plan  and provide  that\npersons  with  mental  retardation  \"shall  have  the rights,  benefits,\nand privileges  guaranteed  to all  citizens  by the  Constitution  and\nlaws  of the  United  States\"  (J.A.  107).  The  Appendix  further\nenumerates  \"special  rights\"  that  are guaranteed  by state  and\nfederal  laws,  which  include:  (i)  appropriate  treatment,\nservices,  and  habilitation;  (2)  programs  that  maximize \nresident’s  developmental  potential;  and (3)  prompt,  sufficient\nand appropriate  medical  treatment  (J.A.  107).\nAccordingly,  as it developed  its  Plan,  Connecticut  was  well\naware  that  it was required  to comply  with  the  level  of care  set\nforth  in the  Purposes  and  Objectives  portion  of the  Decree.  For\nConnecticut  to assert  now,  more  than  ten  years  after  entering\ninto  the Decree,  that  it is not  subject  to the  requirements  in\nthat  section  of the  Decree  is completely  meritless.  The  State  is\nalso  incorrect  in asserting  that  the  requirements  in the  Purposes\nand  Objectives  section  of the Decree  are not  found  in those\nportions  of the  Remedial  Orders,  such  as Part  V of the  Consent\nDecree,  which  the  State  cons~dezs  to provide  the  specific\n\n- 35 -\nrequirements  it must  satisfy.  In Argument  II of this  brief  (at\npp.  38-41,  infra),  we discuss  those  provisions  in the Remedial\nOrders  that  contain  the same  requirements  found  in the Purposes\nand  Objectives  of the Decree.  Therefore,  this  Court  should  rule\nthat  the district  court  did not  modify  Connecticut’s  obligations\nunder  the Remedial  Orders.\nThis  Court  should  also  hold  that  the district  court’s  intent\nto appoint  a special  master  was  not a modification  of the\nRemedial  Orders.  In  ~  v.  Enomoto,  815  F.2d  1323,  1326\n(1987),  the  Ninth  Circuit  determined  that  an appointment  of \nspecial  master  is not a modification  that  had the effect  of\ngranting  an injunction.  Thompson  is nearly  identical  to this\ncase.  It involved  an action  brought  by inmates  challenging  the\nconditions  at the  California  State  Prison  at San  Quentin  as\nunconstitutional.  The  parties  eventually  settled  through  a\nconsent  decree.  Id.  at  1324.  Subsequently,  the  district  court\ngranted  the inmates’  request  for  the appointment  of a special\nmaster  to monitor  compliance  with  the decree.  The  Thompson  court\nfound  that  the  appointment  did not  have  the effect  of granting  or\nmodifying  an injunction,  since  the  consent  decree  implicitly\ncontemplates  appointment  of a master  because  the district  court\nretained  authority  to ,,’establish  procedures’  for its\ncompliance.\"  Id.  at 1327.\nin this  case,  the  1990  Stipulation  also  provides  that  the\ndistrict  court  ,,shall  retain  jurisdiction  for all purposes  * * *\nuntil  Defendants  have  fully  and faithfully  implemented  all\n\n- 36 -\nprovisions  of the  Consent  Decree  and  plans\"  (J.A.  158).  The\ncourt’s  intention  to appoint  a special  master,  in accordance  with\nFed.  R. Civ.  P. 53,  was,  therefore,  well  within  the  scope  of the\nDecree’s  provisions.  Cf.  In re pearson,  990  F.2d  653,  659  (Ist\nCir.  1993)  (in  denying  petition  for  mandamus,  court  considers\nappointment  of master  as merely  providing  court  with  information\nto \"ascertain  the  need  for  alteration  of its ongoing  activities\nunder  a consent  decree\").\nThe  court’s  order  also  fails  the remaining  two  parts  of the\nCarson  test.  Since  the  special  master  has  not  yet  been  appointed\nand has  not  made  any  recommendations  with  regard  to how\nConnecticut  should  comply  with  the court’s  remedial  orders,\nConnecticut  cannot  show  that  the  order  has had  any serious,\nirreparable  consequences.  Further,  the  correctness  of the\ndistrict  court’s  orders  appointing  a special  master  can  be\nreviewed  on appeal  from  an injunctive  order  or final  judgment  in\nthis case.\nAccordingly,  this  Court  also  lacks  jurisdiction  of the  order\nunder  28 U.S.C.  1292(a)  (I).\nII\nTHE DISTRICT  COURT  CORRECTLY  FOUND  CONNECTICUT\nIN CIVIL  CONTEMPT  OF THE  COURT’S  REMEDIAL  ORDERS\nA.

Sweater  Bee  by Banff,  Ltd.,  885 F.2d  l, 5 (2d Cir.  1989),\ncert.  denied,  494 U.S.  1029  (1990).\nC. The Orders  That  Connecticut  Violated  Are Clear\nAnd Unambiauous.\nConnecticut’s  argument  that  the  district  court’s  contempt\norder  fails  to satisfy  this  part  of the  test  is premised  upon  its\ncontention  that  the district  court  modified  the  Decree  by\nunilaterally  requiring  Connecticut  to provide  adequate  training\nprograms  and medical  care  as provided  in Part  I of the  Consent\nDecree  entitled  Purposes  and Objectives  (Conn  Br.  16).  As \ndiscussed  in Argument  I infra,  that  contention  is wrong,  because\nin its  Implementation  Plan,  Connecticut  expressly  agreed  to adopt\nthe  requirements  found  in Part  I of the  Decree.  Further,  several\nprovisions  of the  Consent  Decree  and the other  Remedial  Orders\nsuch  as Part  V of the Decree,  which  Connecticut  concedes  (Conn.\n\n- 38 -\nBr. I0 & n.4,  12)  are  clear  and  unambiguous,  require  Connecticut\nto provide  the  same  requirements  found  in Part  I of the  Decree.\nI. Part  I(1)  of the  Consent  Decree  requires  ,,training\nprograms  professionally  designed  to reduce  or eliminate\nunreasonable  risks\"  (J.A.  12).  Part  V(3)  implements \nrequirement  by ordering  Connecticut  to provide  ,,regular,  periodic\nprofessional  evaluations\"  to identify  those  in need  of training\nprograms  and  \"to provide  a sufficient  number  of training  program\nhours\"  (J.A.  18).  Part  I(W)  of the  1990  Stipulation  orders\nConnecticut  to \"(1)  develop  and implement,  and,  thereafter,\nregularly  evaluate,  a system  for  observing  and  recording\nobservations  regarding  client  behavior  relevant  to training\nprograms,  and  (2)  develop  and  implement  a system  to verify  that\nthe  data  are  reliable\"  (J.A.  156).  Also,  in its  Appendix  to the\nImplementation  Plan,  Connecticut  agrees  to provide  programs  that\nmaximize  a resident’s  development  potential  and  provides  rules\nfor the  development  of an OPS for  each  resident  to accomplish\nthat  requirement  (J.A.  I07,  118).\n2. Part  I(2)  of the  Decree  calls  for  that  degree  of care\n\"sufficient  to protect  all residents  from  unreasonable  risks\"\ncaused  by staff  and  other  residents  (J.A.  12).  Part  V(9)\nrequires  ,,procedures  that  will  be utilized\"  to protect  residents\nfrom  ,,unreasonable  risks\"  caused  by \"staff  or other  residents\"\n(J.A.  20).  Under  Part  I(V)  of the  1990  Stipulation,  Connecticut\nmust  implement  the  existing  Plan  of Implementation  \"to assure\nthat  sufficient  such  training  programs  as are needed  to protect\n\n- 39 -\nresidents  from  unreasonable  risks  to their  personal  safety  and\nfrom  unreasonable  bodily  restraints  are consistently  implemented\"\n(J.A.  155-156).\n3. Part  I(3)  of the Decree  requires  ,,adequate  medical  care\"\n,’pursuant  to the exercise  of professional  judgment  by a qualified\nprofessional\"  (J.A.  12).  Part  V(5)  requires  ,,recordkeeping\nsystems\"  to \"make  available  * * * information  as is\nprofessionally  necessary  to permit  the  exercise  of professional\njudgment  in [a] resident’s  care,  medical  treatment,  and training\"\n(J.A.  19).  Part  V(6)  requires  ,,measures  * * * to provide\nadequate  medical  care,\"  including  physical  therapy  services  to\nprevent  physical  degeneration  and deformity  (J.A.  19).  Part  I(F)\nof the 1990  Stipulation  requires  ,,appropriate  physical  therapy  to\neach  resident  with  physical  handicaps  for whom  a program  of\nphysical  therapy  has been  ordered  by a qualified  professional,\nand ensure  records  of such  treatment  are made  and  entered  in the\nresident’s  medical  record\"  (J.A.  150).  Part  I(G)  of the \nStipulation  requires  (J.A.  150):\na qualified  physician  [to]  assess  each  resident  with\nphysical  disabilities  to determine  whether  a physical\ntherapy  program  should  be initiated  or an existing\nphysical  therapy  program  modified  to prevent\ncontractures,  physical  degeneration,  and inappropriate\nbody  growth  and  deformity.  The  physician  shall  refer\nthose  residents  for whom  such  a need  is identified  to a\nregistered  physical  therapist.\n4. Parts  I(4)  and  (5)  of the  Decree  require  Connecticut \nprovide  behavior  modifying  medications  ,,pursuant  to the exercise\nof professional  judgment  by a qualified  professional\"  (J.A.  12);\nPart  V(7)  requires  Connecticut  to provide  procedures  governing\n\n- 40 -\nthe use of behavior  modifying  medications  including  ,,monitoring\nand  review  of whether  the  drugs  prescribed  for  and administered\nto the  resident  are appropriate  for the  needs  of that  resident\"\n(J.A. 19).\nReview  of the  Remedial  Orders  demonstrates  that  the Orders\nwere  carefully  drafted  to ensure  that  Connecticut  is explicitly\nrequired  to provide  the  services  in the manner  guaranteed  by the\nConstitution.  Accordingly,  Connecticut’s  reliance  upon  cases\nsuch  as United  States  v. Armour  & CQ~,  402 U.S.  673,  681-682\n(1971),  and Securities  & Exchanqe  Comm’n  v. Levine,  881 F.2d\n1165, 1179 (2d Cir. 1989) (quoting  Armour  & Co., su__q~/~),  is\nmeritless.  The  rule  those  cases  articulate  is that  parties  that\nenter  into  a consent  decree  can  be held  responsible  only  for\ncomplying  with  requirements  specifically  provided  in the decree.\nSince  consent  decrees  are  agreements  that  represent  compromises\nbetween  the parties,  \"the  scope  of a consent  decree  must  be\ndiscerned  within  its  four  corners,  and  not  by reference  to what\nmight  satisfy  the  purposes  of one  of  the  parties  to it.\"  Armour\n& Co.,  402  U~S.  at 681-682.  That  rule  does  not,  however,  support\nConnecticut’s  position  in this  case;  instead  it supports  the\ndistrict  court’s  findings  of  contempt.  The  Purposes  and\nObjectives  of the parties  are  contained  within  Part  I of the\nDecree,  and  Connecticut  explicitly  bound  itself  to those\nrequirements.  As this  Court  held  in United  Stakes  v. Local  1804-\nI, Int’l  Lonqshoremen’s  Ass~n,  44 F.3d  I091,  i098  (2d Cir.  1995)\n(emphasis  added),\n\n- 41 -\n[w]here  a statement  of purpose  is contained  in the\ndecree  itself,  however,  as the  product  of arm’s-length\nnegotiations,  and  that  purpose  may  be discerned  without\nreference  to the  extrinsic  aims  of the  parties,  Armour\ncannot  be read  to prohibit  consideration  of that\npurpose.\nTherefore,  this  Court  should  reject  Connecticut’s  claim  and\nfind  the Remedial  Orders  clear  and unambiguous.\nD. ~onn~cti~ut’s  Claim  That  There  Was  Not  Clear  And\nConvincinq  Evidence  Of Its  Violation  Of\nThe Remedial  Orders  Is Meritless.\nBoth  Connecticut  (Conn  Br.  18-21)  and the amicus  curiae  (Am.\nBr.  16-17)  argue  that  the  district  court  erred  in finding  that\nthere  was  clear  and convincing  evidence  that  Connecticut  failed\nto comply  with  the Remedial  Orders,  because,  ~nter  alia,  the\ncourt  also  made  findings  that:  (a)  Connecticut  had  substantially\ncomplied  with  the Orders  (J.A.  259);  and  (b) that  Southbury’s\naccident  rate  was the  lowest  of the  other  institutions  in the\nDepartment  of Mental  Retardation’s  six regions  (J.A.  247).\nThose  arguments  are  meritless,  because  they  misconstrue  the\nUnited  States’  contempt  motion  and the  district  court’s  findings\nas to Connecticut’s  noncompliance  with  the Remedial  Orders  in\nthis  case.  The  United  States  did  not  assert  that  Connecticut  is\nin violation  of all the  requirements  of the Remedial  Orders.\nInstead,  the  United  States  presented  uncontroverted  evidence  in\nthe form  of expert  reports  and testimony  that  Connecticut\nviolated  certain  express  provisions  of the  Remedial  Orders,  not\nall the  provisions.  The  district  court  accepted  that  evidence,\nas well  as the evidence  that  Connecticut’s  experts  presented.\nIndeed,  the  court  noted  that  \"some  of the most  compelling\n\n- 42 -\nevidence  came  from  [Connecticut]’s  own experts\"  (J.A.  259  & n.\n35).  The evidence  supporting  the  court’s  decision  (see  pp.  9-21,\nsu_$_up_ra) can be summarized as follows:\nI. With  regard  to Connecticut’s  failure  to comply  with  the\nrequirement  that  it provide  adequate  medical  care  that  is\npursuant  to the  exercise  of professional  judgment  by a qualified\nprofessional,  Dr.  Wachtel  reported  that  inadequate  diagnosis  and\ntreatments  contributed  to the  deaths  of at least  six  Southbury\nresidents,  i.e.,  John  T. (J.A.  505),  John  E. (J.A.  280-281),\nVincent  S. (J.A.  283),  Marilyn  C. (J.A.  287),  Richard  C. (J.A.\n292-294),  and  Jose  M. (J.A.  295).  Dr.  Wachtel  further  testified\nabout  other  examples  of serious  lapses  in medical  care  that\nresulted  in long  term  suffering.  In one  case,  a resident\nsuffering  from  a skin  disorder,  which  caused  him to itch  until  he\nopened  large  wounds  on his  neck,  was  not seen  by a dermatologist\nfor  three  years  (J.A.  276-277).  Also,  Dr.  Wachtel  and  one \nConnecticut’s  experts,  Karen  Green  McGowan,  reported  that\nConnecticut’s  recordkeeping  procedures  are below  professional\nstandards  and  fail  to satisfy  the  requirements  under  the Remedial\nOrders  (J.A.  252-253,  301).\n2. In the  area  of psychological  services,  Dr.  Harchik’s\nreport  and testimony  showed  that  Connecticut  fails  to provide:\n(I) updated  and  useful  behavior  assessments  (J.A.  243); \ntraining  programs  that  are  targeted  to improving  behavior  that  is\nharmful  to residents  (J.A.  244-245);  and  (3) adequate  positive\nreinforcement  training  that  complies  with  professional  standards\n\n- 43 -\n(J.A.  247-248).  Further,  Dr. Harchik  discussed  how the  death  of\nStanley  B. showed  that  Connecticut  had failed  to implement\ntreatment  procedures  to address  problems  discovered  during\nbehavior  assessments  (J.A.  406-407).  Additionally,  Connecticut’s\nown expert,  Dr. Volkmar,  stated  in his report  that ,’psychiatric\nservices  at [Southbury]  appeared  to be entirely  focused  on issues\nof medication,\"  thereby  violating  the  Remedial  Orders’\nprohibition  against  use of medications  in lieu  of training\nprograms  (J.A.  250).\n3. As to Connecticut’s  failure  to provide  appropriate\nphysical  therapy  services  as required  by the  Remedial  Orders,\nSusan  Harryman  testified  that  several  aspects  of Southbury\nservices  were  substantially  below  professional  standards.  For\nexample,  of the  73 Southbury  residents  she examined,  64 needed\nservices  from  a physical  therapist  (J.A.  337).  Of those  64,\nhowever,  only  two  were  being  treated  by a physical  therapist\n(J.A.  337).  Ms.  Harryman  further  found  20 of those  73 residents\nhad  suffered  loss  of function  (J.A.  349).  She  determined  that\nSouthbury  could  have  prevented  loss  of function  in 14 of those\nindividuals  (J.A.  350).\nIn order  to successfully  challenge  the district  court’s  fact\nfindings  of noncompliance,  Connecticut  must  show  that  they  are\nclearly  erroneous.  EEOC  v. Local  638,  81 F.3d  1162,  1171  (2d\nCir.  1996).  At trial,  however,  Connecticut  failed  to present\nevidence  that  challenged  the evidence  u~on  which  the  district\ncourt  relied.  Indeed,  under  cross-examination  by the  United\n\n- 44 -\nStates,  each  of Connecticut’s  witnesses  testified  that  they  could\nnot  contradict  the evidence  that  the United  States  presented.\nSpecifically,  Dr.  Martin  Pollack,  Southbury’s  Director  of\nPsychology,  was  unable  to contradict  Dr.  Harchik’s  report  (J.A.\n463-464).  Dr.  fan  Lawson,  the  Southbury  Medical  Director,  was\nnot  \"prepared  to refute  point-by-point\"  Dr.  Wachtel’s  testimony\n(J.A.  471),  and  admitted  that  the  care  of John  T. exemplified\ninadequate  diagnosis  and  treatment  (Tr.  599).  Mr.  Thomas  Howley,\nDirector  of Southbury,  could  not refute  the allegations  presented\nby Dr.  Harchik,  Ms.  Harryman,  or Dr.  Wachtel  (J.A.  477). \nfailing  to controvert  the evidence  upon  which  the  district  court\nrelied,  Connecticut  falls  far short  of meeting  its burden.\nE. The Record  Demonstrates  That..Connecticut  Was Not\nReasonably  Diliqen~  In Attemptinq  To_Comply\nWith  The Orders.\nConnecticut’s  assertion  that  \"[t]here  was no discussion,  no\nanalysis  and no finding\"  as to Connecticut’s  diligence  is wrong\n(Conn.  Br. 22).  It is apparent  from  the  district  court’s  legal\nanalysis  and  findings  that  the  court  thoroughly  reviewed\nConnecticut’s  efforts  to comply  and  was not  persuaded  that  the\nState  had been  reasonably  diligent.\nFirst,  in its discussion  of the  legal  standard  relevant  to\nthe  finding  of contempt,  the  district  court  stated  that  \"[a]\nfinding  of contempt  is appropriate  when:  * * * (3)  the  defendant\nhas not  exercised  reasonable  diligence  in attempting  to comply\"\n(J.A.  241).  In its  ruling  on contempt,  the  court  found  that\nSouthbury’s  \"quarterly  reports  reveal  that  it was  in compliance\n\n- 45 -\nwith  over  90%  of the Remedial  Orders’  requirements\"  (J.A.  259).\nIt is equally  apparent,  however,  from  the district  court’s\nfindings  that  it had concluded  that  Connecticut  had not ~een\nreasonably  diligent  in attempting  to comply  with  the Remedial\nOrders’  requirements  concerning  the provision  of psychological\nservices,  medical  care,  and physical  therapy.\nThe district  court’s  findings  show  that  Connecticut’s\nprovision  of psychological  services,  medical  care  and physical\ntherapy  were  far  below  acceptable  professional  standards.  For\ninstance,  in the area  of psychological  services,  the court\ncredited,  inter  alia,  Dr. Harchik’s  testimony  that  he reviewed  21\nbehavior  assessments,  which  are a required  component  of a\nresident’s  OPS (J.A.  243),  and  found  that  there  \"was  little\nrelation  between  the analyses  and the treatment  procedures\"  (J.A.\n243).  The  court  accepted  also  Dr.  Harchik’s  testimony  that\nSouthbury  staff  members  demonstrated  a \"’total  lack  of\nunderstanding  of positive  reinforcement’\"  (J.A.  248),  which \none of the most  effective  and  efficient  procedures  for dealing\nwith  maladaptive  behavior  (J.A.  247).  Further,  the  court\ndescribed  how the  percentage  of Southbury  residents  who were\nengaged  -- 31% -- was far  below  the professional  standard  of 80%\n(J.A. 248-249).\nIn the  area  of medical  care,  the  court  found,  inter  alia,\nthat  a report  about  the death  of resident  John  T. \"was  plagued\nwith  appalling  examples  of insufficient  medical  care,  and such\nsystemic  inadequacies  [that]  might  be sufficient  alone  to find\n\n- 46 -\n[Connecticut]  in contempt  of the  [Decrees]\"  (J.A.  252).  The\ncourt  accepted  the finding  of Connecticut’s  nursing  expert,  Ms.\nMcGowan,  that  the  \"problem  lists\"  were  inaccurate  and  incomplete.\nThe  problem  lists  are  a \"crucial  part  to effective  medical  care,\"\nand  are  \"utterly  useless\"  if inaccurate  (J.A.  253).  Accordingly,\nthe  court  accepted  Ms.  McGowan’s  conclusion  that  Southbury’s\nrecordkeeping  procedures  are  below  professional  standards  (J.A.\n252-253).\nThe district  court  found  that  Southbury’s  \"inadequate\nphysical  therapy  services  have  caused  several  residents  who,  only\na few  years  earlier,  were  ambulatory,  to be permanently  bed-\nridden\"  (J.A.  258).  Southbury  was  not  adequately  assessing  its\nphysical  therapy  services,  nor  did  it provide  guidelines  for\ndetermining  staff  competence  before  allowing  the staff  to\nadminister  such  services  (J.A.  257).\nAdditionally,  the  evidence  demonstrates  that  although  the\nexperts  had  notified  Connecticut  about  its  deficiencies,  the\nState  did not  make  a reasonably  diligent  attempt  to follow  the\nexperts’  recommendations  as to the  changes  needed  to comply  with\nthe  Remedial  Orders.  For  instance,  in his  November  1993  report\non the  status  of Southbury’s  psychological  services,  Dr. Harchik\nrecommended  that  behavior  plans  incorporate  and  include  recent\nbehavior  assessments  and  positive  reinforcement  (J.A.  713),  and\nthose  components  are  not  in many  of the plans  he reviewed  in 1995\n(Tr.  376).  He also  recommended  that  ,’skill  development  and\nparticipation  objectives  are  addressed  and  modified  if no\n\n- 47 -\nprogress  is occurring\"  (J.A.  714).  In his  1995  tour \nSouthbury,  Dr.  Harchik  found  \"no indication\"  that  Connecticut\ntried  to implement  that  recommendation  (Tr.  377).\nIn her  report  of February  1993,  Dr. Wachtel  reviewed  the\ninvestigation  of John  T. and  found  that  (J.A.  505):\n[a] letter  to the Commissioner  of Mental  Retardation\ndated  12/02/92,  notes  numerous  recommendations  that  are\nto be implemented  immediately.  There  is little\nevidence,  however,  that  most  of these  recommendations\nhave  been  in fact  implemented.\nMs.  Harryman  testified  that  in her  June  1994  report,  she\nmade  18 specific  recommendations  to Southbury  to improve  its\nphysical  therapy  services  so that  it meets  currently  accepted\nprofessional  standards  (J.A.  356,  520-522).  Ms.  Harryman\ntestified  that  of those  18 recommendations,  Southbury  had  only\nimplemented  one and  partially  implemented  another  (J.A.  356).\nThe district  court’s  findings  of Southbury’s  systemic  flaws\nand the  evidence  of Connecticut’s  failure  to implement  the\nexperts’  recommendations  admit  of only  one  conclusion:  that\nConnecticut  has  not been  reasonably  diligent  in attempting  to\ncomply  with  the Remedial  Orders.\nIII\nTHE  DISTRICT  COURT’S  DECISION  TO APPOINT  A SPECIAL  MASTER\nWAS  A PROPER  EXERCISE  OF ITS REMEDIAL  AUTHORITY\nA. The  Standard  Of Review.\nA district  court’s  decision  to appoint  a special  master  is\nreviewed  for abuse  of discretion.  United  States  v. Yonkers  Bd.\no.f Educ.,  29 F.3d  40, 44 (2d Cir. 1994),  cert.  denied,  115 S. Ct.\n2608 (1995).\n\n- 48 -\nB. The District  Court’s  Decision  To ADDoint\nA SpecialMaster  Was  Proper.\nIt is well  established  that  a district  court  has  the\ninherent  power  to appoint  an agent  to oversee  the  implementation\nof its consent  decree.  In re Peterson,  253  U.S.  300,  312  (1920).\nAs this  Court  held  in Ber~e~  v. Heckler,  771  F.2d  1556,  1568  (2d\nCir. 1985):\n[A] court  has an affirmative  duty  to protect  the\nintegrity  of its  decree.  This  duty  arises  where  the\nperformance  of one party  threatens  to frustrate  the\npurpose  of the decree.\nAlthough  Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 53 permits  the  appointment  of a\nspecial  master  only  when  exceptional  conditions  are  present,  a\ndistrict  court  is entitled  to deference  in determining  when  those\nexceptional  conditions  exist.  Moreover,  as the  district  court\nnoted  (J.A.  261),  \"deference  to the  district  court’s  exercise \ndiscretion  is heightened  where,  as here,  the  court  has  been\noverseeing  a large,  public  institution  for  a long  period  of time\"\n(J.A.  261,  citing  Hutto  v. Finney,  437 U.S.  678,  688 (1978)).\nUnder  the  circumstances  in this  case,  this  Cou£t  should  not\ndisturb  the  district  court’s  determination  that  a special  master\nis necessary.\nThe  same  diutzict  court  judge  has presided  over  this  case\nsince  the  United  States  filed  its  complaint  in 1985.  The  court\nentered  several  orders  to ensure  that  Connecticut  provides\nSouthbury  residents  with  their  constitutional  right  to adequate\npsychological  services,  medical  care,  and physical  therapy\nservices.  It has  now  heard  evidence  detailing  Southbury’s\n\n- 49\nsystemic  deficiencies  in the provision  of psychological  services,\nmedical  care,  and physical  therapy  services  that  continue  to be\nsubstantial  departures  from  professional  standards  and \"have\ncaused  many  residents  to suffer  grave  harm,  and,  in several\ninstances,  death\"  (J.A.  259).\nAdditionally,  this  case  presents  the type  of \"polycentric\"\nproblems  that  this  Court,  in New York  State  Ass’n  For Retarded\nChildren,  Inc.  v. Care~,  706 F.2d  956,  962 (2d  Cir.),  cert.\ndenied,  464 U.S.  915 (1983),  held  warrants  the appointment  of \nmaster:\nThe monitoring  of a Consent  Judgment  that  mandates\nindividualized  care  for  thousands  of class  members  and\nthat  entails  balancing  of the interests  of parties  with\nthird-party  employees,  school  authorities,  and\ncommunity  groups  is just  the sort  of \"’polycentric\nproblem  that  cannot  easily  be resolved  through  a\ntraditional  courtroom-bound  adjudicative  process.’\"\nMoreover,  the district  court  could  have  imposed  more\nintrusive  remedies.  See, e._~.g=.,  Powell  v. Ward, 643 F.2d 924, 931\n(2d Cir.),  cert.  denied,  454 U.S.  832 (1981)  (court  ordered\nprison  superintendent  to pay  $5,000  fine,  plus  $I,000  per  day for\ncontinuing  violations  in addition  to referring  case  to a special\nmaster)~  Therefore,  this  Court  should  hold  ~hat  the  district\ncourt  did not abuse  its  authority  by deciding  to appoint  a\nspecial  master.\nThe  amicus  curiae’s  contentions  (Am.  Br. 14) that  the\nappointment  of the  master  is \"an  ambush\"  to permit  the United\nStates’  \"ultimate  objective\"  to close  Southbury  is meritless.  At\ntrial,  the  United  States  did  seek  a reduction  in population  at\n\n- 50 -\nSouthbury  (J.A.  240).  The  district  court,  however,  did  not  grant\nthat  request  and  the United  States  has not  appealed  from  the\norder.  The  district  court’s  order  stating  its  intent  to appoint\nthe  master  does  not instruct  the  master  to consider  closing\nSouthbury.  Therefore,  this  Court  should  reject  this  contention.\nCONCLUSION\nThis  Court  should  find  that  it lacks  jurisdiction,  under\neither  28 U.S.C.  1291  or 1292,  to review  the district  court’s\norder.  In the  event,  however,  that  this  Court  finds  it has\njurisdiction  to review  the order,  it should  affirm  the district\ncourt’s  finding  that  Connecticut  is in civil  contempt  of its\nRemedial  Orders  and  the decision  to appoint  a special  master  to\nensure  Connecticut’s  compliance  with  the orders  in the  future.\nRespectfully  submitted,\nISABELLE  K.

Missouri,  731 F.2d 1294 (8th Cir. 1984).\n6\n\nZn October  1991a  the  State  moved the  district  court  to  declare\nthe  St.  Louis  School  District  unitary.  This  notion  v¯s  resisted  by\nthe  plaintiffs,  the  United  States,  and  the  St.  Louis  Board  of\nEducation.  No response  was  filed  by  the  State.  Xn  Nay  2992,  the\nState  filed  ¯  nay  action  requesting  partial  unitary  status.  Later\nthat  neath,  the  district  court  held  that  the  Starers  request  vas\npremature  but  pezwitted  the  State  to  ¯never  certain  discovery\nrequests  stating  that  the  possibility  existed  that  a  declaration  of\nunitary  st¯tun  might  be  appropriate  in  the  future.\nIn  November  1993,  the  State  £1led  ¯n  amended  motion  for\nunitary  status.  Zt  informed  the  court  that  it  would  be  prepared  to\npresent  its  evidence  in  support  of  the  notion  vithin  nine  to  twelve\nmonths.  Most  Pa~cies  ¯gain  responded  that  the  notion  was  still\npremature.  Zn  October  1994,  the  State  asked  the  district  Cou_---t  to\nset  a  date  for  ¯  hearing  on  its  notion.  In  February  1995,  the\ndistrict  court  granted  the  State’s  request  and  scheduled  a  hearing\nfor  September  of  that  year.  The  hearing  was  later  rescheduled  for\nMarch  1996  tO  accommodate  the  schedules  of  the  twenty  p¯~les  to\nthe  case.\nIn  November  1996,  the  State  filed  ¯  notion  vit.h  the  district\ncourt  to  terminate  promptly  an  element  of  the  desegregation  progrn\nthat  permits  black  students  residing  in  the  St.  Louis  School\nDistrict  to  voluntarily  transfer  to  a  suburb¯~l  school,  requires  the\nState  to  fund  such  transfers,  and  also  permits  l~lted  voluntary\ntransfers  of  suburban  students  to  the  St.  Louis  School  District.\nThe  notion  was  \"conditional.-  ee  the  State  requested  the  court  to\nconsider  the  notion  only  If  it  did  not  enter  an  order  finding  that\nthe  St.  Louis  School  District  had  achieved  a  tmltary  Iltetus.  The\n=orion  provoked  varikd  responses¯  including  that  the  pl(lintiffs  and\nthe  United  St¯tee  urged  the  court  to  appoint  a  settlement\ncoordinator  to  ettenpt  to  resolve  the  litigation,  and  the  City\nBoard  asked  that  the  pending  hearing  on  unitary  status  be\npostponed.\n\nZn  February¯the  dlstrict  ¢o~’tdenl~e  State’s  ©ondltional\nnotion  ¯s  having  been  lnprovidtntly  filed  end  not  ripe  for\nadjudication.

The\nCourt[,]  however[,]  is  reluctant  to  continue  the  hearing.\nZt  nay  veil  be  that  the  possibility  for  settle:ent  will\nbe  greater  ~ollovlng  the  hearing,  ¯t  which  tin¯  the\nappointment  of  ¯  Settlement  Coordinator  would  be\nappropriate  and  beneficial.\n~,  G(1939)96,  at  2  (I.D.  Ho.  Feb.  15,  1996).  The  State \nnot  appeal  the  district  court’s  order  denying  Its  motion.\nThe  court  held  an  evidentlaryhearlng  on  the  St¯teas  unttarF\nstatus  motion  from  March  4  t~rough  Hatch  26,  1995.  The  court  has\nyet  to  decide  that  motion.  Following  the  hearing,  the  court\nentered  an  order  on  April  23,  1996  sta~ing  that  the  preferred\nconclusion  of  the  case  would  be  an  agreed-upon  plan  for  ending\ncourt  supervision  of  the  St.  Louts  Public  School¯.  Zt  dot¯mined\nthat  ¯  serious  settlement  effort  under  the  direction  of  the\nsettlement  coordinator,  Dr.  William  H.  Danforth,  should  be\nundertaken.  It  ordered  the  parties  to  participate  in  Good  ~aith  in\nthe  negotiations.  Xt  st¯Fed  the  post-hearing  briefing  schedule  and\nordered  that  all  co:ponents  cf  the  settlement  agreement  then  In\nforce  should  continue  in  effect.  ~,  G(2062)96  (E.D. \nXpril  23,  1996).\nThe  State  then  filed  a  notion  to  alter  cr  a:end  the  court’s\norder  appointing  Dr.  Danforth,  arguing  that  the  settlement  director\nshould  not  be  authorized  to  make  reconnendatione  toO-he  court  as  to\nthe  disposition  oft  he  case,  that  onl¥  twenty-five  days  should  be\nallowed  for  negotiations,  and  raising  several  ether  objections.\nOn Oune 26,  1995,  the  court~uled  that  the  negotiations  would\nbe  confidential  from  the  court  and  outside  parties,  l~hat  the\n8\n\naoordinator  would  not  recommend  to  the  court  how  the  case  should  be\nresolved,  and  rejected  the  time  liuit  for  negotiations  proposed  by’\nthe  State  expressing  confidence  that  the  settlement  coordinator\nwould  proceed  with  ¯11  due  diligence.  L~ILI~,  G(2134)96  (E.D. \n~une  26,  1996).\nOn  July  24,  1996,  the  Stats  appealed  the  rye  district  court\norders.  The  State  also  sought  to  stay  the  interdistrict  components\nof  the  present  desegr¯gation  remedy  pending  appeal  of  the  order\nappointing  the  settlement  coordinator.  :  The  State  sought\nalternative  remedies  limiting  its  obligations  under  the\ndesegregation plan. The district court  denled the motions for  the\nstay pending  appeal  on August  14, 1996. ~, G(217S)96  (E.D.\nMe. Aug. 14~ 1996). This court and 3ustlceThomas as c~rcuit judge\ndenied  substantially  similar  motions  £or  ¯  stay  pending  appeal  on\nAugust  23,  1996  end  August  30,  1996e  respectively.  On  October  1,\n1996,  the  State  appealed  distriot  court  order  G(2175)96  denying  the\nState’s 1orion  for ¯ 8taypending appeal. All three  appeals have\nbeen  consolidated  by  this  court.\nWe  dismiss  all  three  appeals.  The  appeals  from  orders\nG(2062)96  and  G(2134)96  are  interlocutory  and  relate  to  settlement\nprocedures  and  case  management.  They  cannot  be  characterized  as\nappeals  ~rom  orders  denying  an  injunction.  Thus,  these  appeals  are\nnot within the pu~Tiew of  28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(I).  A district\ncourt,  particularly  An  school  desegregation  camel,  has  broad\ndiscretion  to  control  its  docket  and  hast  he  necessary  ~lexibtll~y\nto  shape  remedies  that  adjust  ptd~lic  and  private  needs.\n~,  433  U.S.  267,  288  (1977);  Brown  v.  Boawd  of  Educ.,  349\nU.S.  294,  300  (1955).\nWith  respect  to  dll~rict  cour~order  G(2175)96,  the  denial \na  stay  pending  appeal  18  not  an  appealable  order.  The  st¯re  argues\nthat  the  district  eou~t  erred  because  At  effectively  denle~  its\nmotion  for  unitary  status.  We disagree.  The  district  court  has\n9\n\nyet  to  rule  on  ~he  State’s  unitary  status  motion.  The  district\ncourt  in  this  ease  has  not  re~used  to  rule  on  the  8tatets  not£on\nthat the St. Louis School District be declared unitary. It has\nsimply  postponed  post-hearing  briefing  and  deferred  Einal  ruling  on\nthis  matter.  We cannot  review  a  matter  that  has  not  been  ruled  on\nby  the  district  court.  We lack  Jurisdiction  over  the  state’s  clam\nthat  the  district  court  has  erroneously  den£ed  Its  motion  for\nunitary  status.\nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  we  dismiss  the  State’s  appeals.\nA true  copy.\nAttest:\nCLERK, U.

Training takes place during the day and evening, is planned and \nmonitored in formal annual and quarterly meetings, and is embodied in written plans and \nteaching strategies. It takes place in vocational programs and in residences. \n                                                 \n1 If this recommendation is accepted, the following will be released: CR 43, EC 3 and 4; \nCR 44, EC 1, 2 and 3; CR 52, EC 3 and 4; and CR 14, EC 2.   The Special Master \nreviewed CR 14, EC 2,  previously; based on the master’s consultant’s most recent \nreview, the master concludes that Defendants are in compliance with this requirement. \n2 Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982), recognized the equivalence of “training” to \n“habilitation.” “The word ‘habilitation’ is commonly used to refer to programs for the \nmentally retarded because mental retardation is ... a learning disability and training \nimpairment rather than an illness. [T]he principal focus of habilitation is upon training \nand development of needed skills.” 457 U.S. at 309, n.1 (1982) (quoting amicus brief for \nAmerican Psychiatric Association). \n3 Order of August 30, 2001. \n4  Skarnulis, Habilitation Services at Southbury Training School at 9 (Nov. 12, 2005) \n(ellipses omitted), filed with the Special Master’s Order of November 15, 2005. \nJanuary 14, 2006  3   Report to the Court No. 60 \n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1373     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 4 of 14(cid:10)\n \nThis report traces the status of compliance with court-ordered Habilitation requirements \nbeginning with the 1996 contempt findings, through the 1998-2001 period when \ndeficiencies were not adequately addressed by Defendants, and concluding with their \nsuccessful and well-executed OPS/Habilitation Initiative from 2002 to 2005. \nSome have objected on occasion to the duration of these proceedings.  As the record \nshows, and this report summarizes, Habilitation is released from oversight just as soon as \nDefendants have fulfilled their obligation to the court. \nWhile one might have hoped that it would not have taken so many years since the \nRemedial Plan for Defendants to accomplish this success, one must celebrate that they \nhave now done so.  \nThe Special Master recommends release from active judicial oversight of all outstanding \nHabilitation provisions of the Remedial Plan as set forth in this report.5 \nI.  The 1996 Contempt and Failure to Provide Habilitation. \nAlthough Defendants committed in the 1987 Consent Decree and the subsequent \nImplementation Plan to provide adequate habilitation to STS residents, they failed to do \nso and were found in contempt in 1996. United States v. State of Connecticut, 931 F. \nSupp. 974 (D. Conn. 1996), appeal dism’d, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 21006 (2d Cir., June \n13, 1997).6 The court found that defendants’ positive self-reports did not reflect reality. \nId. at 983-84.  \nAt the time of the contempt ruling, STS was writing individual programs for clients but \nthey were often irrelevant or not effectively implemented. STS residents were almost \nnever engaged in productive activities. Instead of engaging the residents in activities, \nstaff members were watching TV, talking on the telephone, talking to each other, and \ninvolved in other miscellaneous activities. Defendants were administering behavioral \nmedication in lieu of habilitation programs.  \nThe court in 1996 found that the deficiencies at STS were causing clients to die and to \nsuffer other injuries. Noting that “some of the most compelling evidence came from the \n                                                 \n5 The following elements are not addressed in this report a) the Communication Services \naspect of Habilitation which is pending before the Court, and b) behavior planning and \nservices which were not covered in the most recent review by the master’s consultant.   \nAlso, neither this report nor the recent consultant’s report addressed the adequacy of \nHabilitation and other programs at STS as compared to, or with regard to, community \nplacement and services outside the institution.  This report should not be construed to \naffect any aspect of the community placement issues pending before the Court in another \nmatter. \n6 Courts have inherent power to enforce compliance with an order, including a consent \ndecree, through civil contempt. Shillitani v. United States, 384 U.S. 364, 370 (1966); \nUnited States v. City of Yonkers, 856 F.2d 444, 454 (2d Cir. 1988). The power is an \nancient one. Ex parte Robinson, 86 U.S. 505 (1874). See Fox. History of Contempt of \nCourt (1927);  Beale, Contempt of Court, 21 Harv. Law. Rev. 161, 169-70 (1908). \nJanuary 14, 2006  4   Report to the Court No. 60 \n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1373     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 5 of 14(cid:10)\n \nDefendants own experts,” the Court found STS to be a dangerous environment for its \nvulnerable residents, subjecting them to serious harm, and concluded that Defendants \nwere in contempt: \nIndeed, STS's systemic flaws have caused many residents to suffer grave \nharm, and, in several instances, death. \n931 F.Supp. at 983-984 (footnotes omitted). The Special Master was appointed to \nformulate a remedy, and to monitor and report on Defendants’ compliance. \nII.  The Remedial Plan’s Habilitation Provisions. \nThe Special Master submitted the Remedial Plan with the consent of the parties. The Plan \nwas adopted by the Court’s Order of April 21, 1998. The 313 page comprehensive plan \ncontemplated a transformation of STS.  It addressed Habilitation in detail, both directly \nand indirectly.  At Court Requirements 43, 44 and 52, the Remedial Plan required \nadequate Habilitation.7 \nCourt Requirements 43, 44 and 52, mandate that: \n•  Clients’ “individual and group training and programs” must be evaluated at least \nannually. CR 43, EC 3. \n•  All clients must be provided the Habilitation programs defined in their individual \nOverall Plan of Service. CR 43, EC 4. \n•  All clients who need a day program must be in a day program which “meet[s] \neach client’s needs.” CR 44, EC 1 and 2. \n•  Work programs must be provided to “all individuals in need of” a work program. \nCR 44, EC 3. \n•  There must be “consistent implementation” of Habilitation programs. CR 52, EC \n3. \n•  Habilitation programs must be “available” and clients must be referred to them. \nCR 52, EC 4. \nIII.  Defendants’ Non-compliance Continued in 1998-2001. \nIn 1998, 1999 and 2001, Defendants were found to be in continued non-compliance with \nHabilitation requirements.  \nDefendants were found to be in non-compliance with the Habilitation requirements in the \nmaster’s preliminary 1998 Compliance Review. Again, non-compliance was found in the \n                                                 \n7  Many other provisions relate to Habilitation as well, e.g., those on behavior plans, \npsychotropic medication, restraints, case management, and those which on structural \nelements such as professional and direct care staffing. Those provisions have previously \nbeen released from active judicial oversight. \nJanuary 14, 2006  5   Report to the Court No. 60 \n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1373     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 6 of 14(cid:10)\n \n1999 Compliance Review by a national team of experts.8  Defendants did not request an \nevidentiary hearing to contest those fact findings and they were accepted .9 \nSeveral  months after the experts’ report the master noted that Defendants’ own report on \nCR 43 “corroborates the existence of compliance issues in the area of habilitation,” \nshowing both low rates for client engagement and also lower than desired compliance for \nCR 43, EC 4 (clients receiving OPS-mandated training).10 \nIn 2001, another national expert compliance review took place.11   The Special Master \nproposed a team of ten (10) consultants to review CR 43, 44 and 52 on Habilitation (he \nsoon after revised the number to nine (9)). Defendants’ objection to the size of the team \nwas overruled by the Court by Order of August 30, 2001, finding: “The court is \npersuaded that the Special Master’s proposal is reasonable and that a reduction in the \nnumber of reviewers would result in a longer period of review with very little effect on \nthe cost of the review.” The Habilitation Review site visit occurred on October 15 – 19, \n2001.  \nOn January 8, 2002, the Special Master disseminated the consultants’ report on the 2001 \nreview. The report found non-compliance with all habilitation requirements, except that \nthe consultants found compliance with Court Requirement 44, EC 1 (all clients who need \na day program must be in a day program).12  \nDefendants’ data corroborated this negative conclusion in an important dimension. A \nvital measure of Habilitation is adequacy of the day/vocational programs provided to STS \nresidents. About the time of the master’s expert team review, Defendants acknowledged \nserious problems in providing consistent day/vocational programs. Defendants describe \nthese programs as a “vital component of the department’s mission.”13 Court Requirement \n                                                 \n8 The 1999 Compliance Report was provided to the parties by Special Master’s Order of \nFebruary 11, 2000.  \n9 Special Master’s 11th Quarterly Report to the Court at 14-16 (May 10, 2000) details the \nseveral occasions at which Defendants declined to request an evidentiary hearing. \n10  Special Master’s 12th Quarterly Report to the Court at 15-16 (Sept. 25, 2000). \n11  There was no comprehensive review in Fall 2000 because the process established by \nthe Order of July 6, 2000 required Defendants to take the initiative to seek release from \noversight. \n12 Remedial Plan at 233; Habilitation Review 2001 (January 8, 2002) at 21.  \n13 Court Requirement 44: Day/Vocational Programs: \nThe availability of day programs for persons who are mentally retarded is \na vital component of the department’s mission. Like residential settings, \nday  programs  must  be  developed  to  meet  individual  client  needs. \nTherefore, the department is committed to the development of programs \ndesigned to promote client growth and independence and to provide an \narray of day program opportunities, emphasizing employment, coupled \nwith the necessary support to increase and maintain living skills. \nJanuary 14, 2006  6   Report to the Court No. 60 \n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1373     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 7 of 14(cid:10)\n \n44, EC 2, mandates that “all of these Day Programs meet each client’s needs.” These \nindividualized programs are intended to “promote client growth and independence.”14 At \nthe end of 2001 and beginning of 2002, STS “acknowledged, and was seeking to address, \na very high and unacceptable rate of STS-based day service cancellations.”15 “Nearly all \nof the 630 STS clients attend a day or vocational program. From April to December, \n2001, on a monthly basis, 14% to 24%  of individual clients’ ‘day services’ have been \ncancelled.” 16 STS’ own “goal” or acceptable rate of cancellations was 5%. Thus, the \n14% to 24% cancellation rate was grossly unacceptable.  \nIV.  The Joint Committee Adopts the 2002 OPS/Habilitation Initiative \nIn their January 29, 2002 joint report, the parties agreed “not to engage in a detailed \nanalysis of the consultants’ [2001] various findings” and Defendants “expressed a \nwillingness to address [the concerns raised in the Habilitation Report.]”17  \nOn May 1, 2002, the parties met with the Special Master, Dr. Guy Caruso, one of the \nwriters of the Habilitation Report for the master, and Maria Laurence, expert for the \nUnited States. During the meeting, the parties agreed that the Special Master would \nconvene a “Joint Committee” to make “specific proposals” for “improvement” of \nhabilitation at Southbury Training School.18 The parties agreed that Guy Caruso, Maria \nLaurence and various staff from STS, including Kathy Hanewicz, Director of Family \nSupport Services, and Kevin McCullough, Assistant Director of Clinical Services, would \nconstitute the Joint Committee.  \nThe Special Master on May 6, 2002 postponed compliance determination proceedings on \nHabilitation to permit the Joint Committee to come to the table with remedial proposals. \nThe Joint Committee’s issued its report August 7, 2002.19  It adopted an unprecedented \ninitiative to be implemented by Defendants, an effort later to be described as a “sea \nchange”  by Defendants’ expert, and a “cultural change” by a Defendant official.  Among \nthe steps in the initiative were: \n1.  Introduction and utilization of a revised personal assessment in the OPS \nprocess. \n                                                                                                                                                \nRemedial Plan at 233. \n14  Ibid. \n15 Special Master’s 17th Quarterly Report to the Court at 12 (Mar. 2, 2002). \n16 Special Master’s 17th Quarterly Report to the Court at 12-13 (Mar. 2, 2002). \n17 Ibid. at 2-3.

Modifications to the OPS meeting process and the OPS documentation. \n3.  Introduction and utilization of additional QA process for the OPS meeting \nand OPS documentation.20 \nDefendants’ plan projected a completion date of January 31, 2004 to “expand the pilot” \nthroughout STS.  The plan came to be known as the OPS/Habilitation Initiative. \nV.  The Special Master Accepts  the OPS/Habilitation Initiative.  \nThe Special Master accepted what he described as the “dramatic and sweeping” \nOPS/Habilitation Initiative in his 19th Quarterly Report to the Court (Sept. 10, 2002).  \nDefendants have launched a dramatic and sweeping revision of the \nhabilitation planning and implementation processes, one so extensive that \nDefendants understandably expect it will not be expanded to all STS \nresidents until January 2004.21 \nA pilot for six residents was in place by that time. The master stated that, “It is hoped that \nthis initiative will remedy the deficiencies identified by the consultant team almost a year \nago.”   \nThe master concluded: “This Habilitation Plan is perhaps the most significant \nundertaking by Defendants (apart from quality assurance) since the appointment of the \nSpecial Master.”22 \nVI.  STS Layoffs Delay the Habilitation Hearing. \nSubsequently, a hearing on compliance with the Habilitation requirements was scheduled, \nand then continued, numerous times, generally on the request of one or both parties.23 To \nexpedite the process, and shorten the hearing, the master ordered that the scope of the \nhearing would be limited to the new Initiative and the results of the 2001 compliance \nreview.24    \nAt that point, an unexpected event occurred which threatened to derail the progress which \nwas being made. Beginning December 6, 2002, Defendants notified the Special Master of \nthe Governor’s decision to lay off several thousand state employees, including nearly 100 \nSTS employees. The Governor is a named Defendant.  The Court and master concluded \n                                                 \n20 Ibid. \n21 Special Master’s 19th Quarterly Report to the Court at 17 (Sept. 10, 2002). \n22 Special Master’s 19th Quarterly Report to the Court at 18 (Sept. 10, 2002) (emphasis \nadded). \n23 See, for example, Special Master’s 20th Quarterly Report to the Court at 9-10 (Dec. 19, \n2002).  \n24  Defendants  contended  that,  apart  from  the  then-limited  Initiative,  no  relevant \nimprovements had been made in Habilitation since the 2001 expert review.  Therefore, \nthey were precluded from contending that 2001 conditions no longer prevailed. See \nSpecial Master’s Order of November 27, 2002 at 3 note 5. \nJanuary 14, 2006  8   Report to the Court No. 60 \n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1373     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 9 of 14(cid:10)\n \nthat Defendants’ layoff plans raised serious compliance concerns and urged Defendants \nto reconsider the layoffs.25 During a status conference with the parties on January 21, \n2003, it was decided to postpone the habilitation hearing so that the effect of the layoffs \nmight be considered. \nIn its Order of February 25, 2003, the Court stated: “It is regrettable that Defendants \nwould choose to make cuts of important staff who are responsible for some of \nDefendants’ most fundamental obligations, thereby potentially delaying the conclusion of \nthis case.”  The Court directed the Special Master to consider the effect of the layoffs in \nmaking future compliance determinations and to reconsider “any related prior compliance \ndeterminations in light of the layoffs.” This direction applied to “any remedial orders \nwhich the Special Master may ascertain are affected by the layoffs, even if there was \npreviously a determination of compliance.”26 \nThe Court on February 25, 2003 acknowledged that its order would require the master to \nreschedule proceedings and conduct supplemental compliance reviews with the relevant \nconsultants. On February 25, the master continued the Habilitation Hearing until May 21, \n2003  to  permit  consideration  of  the  effect  of  the  layoffs.    The  Court  overruled \nDefendants’ motion to reverse the order.  \nIn response to the Court’s order, the master invited the parties to send representatives to a \nMonday, March 10, 2003 meeting of independent consultants to consider the possible \neffects of the layoffs on compliance.27 On Friday afternoon, March 7, Defendants \ninformed the master that they would not participate in the meeting. \nVII.  The Master’s Consultant Rates the OPS/Habilitation Initiative Positively. \nIn mid-January, 2003, Jaylon Fincannon submitted his report on the Habilitation \nInitiative, finding that the Initiative’s strategies were “comprehensive and if implemented \nas stated, will result in the successful implementation of a more person-focused approach \nto the provision” of habilitation at STS.28  Defendants themselves found that the Initiative \n                                                 \n25 See Special Master’s January 7, 2003 memorandum to Defendants, Attachment C to \nthe Special Master’s 21st Quarterly Report to the Court (Mar. 20, 2003). \n26  Ruling of March 11, 2003 at 2 (denying Defendants’ motion for clarification and \nreconsideration of Order of February 25, 2003 on the layoffs). \n27  Defendants’ request to delay this meeting was denied as moot. Ruling of March 11, \n2003 at 4, n.4. \n28 Fincannon, Person-focused Overall Plan of Service Enhancement Initiative (Jan. 13, \n2003) at 4, filed with Special Master’s Order of January 17, 2003. \nThe Special Master’s independent consultants on June 2, 2003 completed a review of the \nimpact of staff reductions on Habilitation and Case Management. Special Master’s Order \nof June 10, 2003 Filing Consultants’ June 2, 2003 Report, Impact of Staff Reductions on \nHabilitation and Case Management. The layoffs, it was determined, were problematic \nwith regard to compliance with the remedial orders. \nJanuary 14, 2006  9   Report to the Court No. 60 \n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1373     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 10 of 14(cid:10)\n \nimbued STS with an “enhanced sense of meaning and purpose” and the individual \nplanning process was now “infused with a new ‘energy.’”29 \nOn October 28, 2003, after an extensive hearing on case management,  the Special \nMaster applauded the OPS/Habilitation Initiative. He found that Defendants were \n“providing person centered plans to STS residents pursuant to the OPS Initiative, which \nis the vehicle Defendants have chosen for the mandatory person centered planning” under \nthe Case Management Plan.”30  However, at that point, with implementation slow, less \nthan 100 of the then approximately 600 STS residents had had the benefit of the Initiative \nand Defendants were reporting that it would take two years, not one year, to bring the \nInitiative to all STS residents.31  \nVIII.  Compliance Resolution Is Delayed. \nOn June 5, 2003, the parties provided the Special Master with an agreement “to resolve \ndisputes” regarding Habilitation. The agreement called for at least two further reviews of \nthe Habilitation Initiative by Jaylon Fincannon (who had been appointed by the master as \na consultant). Rather than settle the dispute, the proposed Agreement actually put off the \nmerits of this litigation indefinitely.  It provided no timeline and did not require review of \nactual compliance. The master permitted the parties to resubmit an agreement32 and they \ninformed him that they would keep him informed of any progress. \nIn light of the above, the hearing was continued again to June and then July, and then to \nSeptember 8, 2003, and then continued sine die without objection from the parties and \nafter extensive discussion with them.33 The parties informed the Special Master at the \nSeptember 11, 2003 parties’ meeting that they had agreed on November 17, 2003 as the \ndate to start the Habilitation hearing. The Special Master concurred. The parties requested \nyet another delay and the master continued the Habilitation hearing sine die on November \n20, 2003, ordering a status report from the parties in 2004.34 \n                                                 \n29 Special Master’s 22d Quarterly Report to the Court at 11 (July 8, 2003) (quoting \nDefendants May 28, 2003 assessment of the OPS/Habilitation Initiative. \n30  Special Master’s Report to the Court No. 52 at 31 (Oct. 28, 2003) (decision on Case \nManagement Plan compliance). \n31 Special Master’s Report to the Court No. 52 at 31 (Oct. 28, 2003) (less than 100 new \nOPSs). Between the summer of 2002 and the April 14, 2003 parties’ meeting, Defendants \nreported that just 20 people had the personal assessments for the new OPS, including the \n6 in the pilot. Special Master’s 22d Quarterly Report to the Court at 10-11 (July 8, 2003). \n32  June 10, 2003 Special Master’s Order on the June 5, 2003 Parties’ Joint Agreement to \nResolve Disputes Concerning the Court Requirements on Habilitation.  \n33 Special Master’s Order of May 13, 2003; Special Master’s Order of June 23, 2003. At \nthe parties’ request, the hearing was later continued sine die and the parties requested to \nprovide suggested dates. Special Master’s Order of September 2, 2003. \n34 Defendants at first objected to a delay beyond January 2004, but later withdrew their \nobjection. \nJanuary 14, 2006  10    Report to the Court No. 60 \n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1373     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 11 of 14(cid:10)\n \nOn February 17, 2004, the parties proposed an agreement to the Court to end the \nRemedial Plan compliance proceedings without further Court adjudication or \ndeterminations by the Special Master. As to Habilitation, the parties again proposed that \nJaylon Fincannon conduct another review and report to them.  The Habilitation hearing \nbefore the master (and other proceedings which might require hearings) were held in \nabeyance by the master pending decision by the Court on the “agreement” which \nultimately was revised several times and never quite finalized. \nThe Court disapproved the agreement by Order of July 21, 2005, finding that it had \noccasioned needless delay: \nThe parties’ machinations over the last 17 months has done little to \nadvance the process begun under the Remedial Plan to purge the finding \nof contempt against the Defendants and has done little to advance the \ninterests of Southbury Training School (“STS”). The Court is confident \nthat, had the process continued without the hiatus occasioned by the \nparties’ representation that a settlement agreement was forthcoming, mot, \nif not all, of the remaining requirements would have been released by \nnow.35 \nThe Court that day also directed the master to proceed to make all outstanding \ncompliance determinations.  \nIX.  The 2005 Compliance Evaluation. \nOn Habilitation, the master appointed the parties’ repeatedly chosen expert, Mr. \nFincannon, to conduct the review, but Defendants objected, claiming that he might be \nunfair to them.36  To move the matter forward, the Court accepted another suggestion of \nthe parties to serve as the Special Master’s retained consultant. He was Dr. Edward \nSkarnulis, a developmental disabilities expert who had served the Court in an STS-related \nmatter. The Special Master has known Dr. Skarnulis professionally for many years and \nwas confident in his ability to assess the results of the OPS/Habilitation Initiative. \nThe report by Dr. Edward Skarnulis, Habilitation Services at Southbury Training School, \nwas filed with the Special Master’s Order of November 15, 2005. \nWith the OPS/Habilitation Initiative now implemented across STS, the consultant review \nfound compliance with the Habilitation requirements. The Special Master agrees. \n                                                 \n35  Defendants appealed the Court’s ruling. This is the first appeal filed since the approval \nof the Remedial Plan. \n36  Special Master’s Order of September 6, 2005 (appointing Mr. Fincannon); Order of \nSeptember 30, 2005 (sustaining objection); Special Master’s Order of October 7, 2005 \n(appointing Dr. Skarnulis). \nDefendants’ allegations against Mr. Fincannon were hardly credible since Defendants \nhad repeatedly endorsed and  suggested  Mr. Fincannon, and had urged the Court to \nappoint him as someone who would render a fair acceptable judgment. \nJanuary 14, 2006  11    Report to the Court No. 60 \n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1373     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 12 of 14(cid:10)\n \nThe report emphasizes that Habilitation encompasses a productive and active approach, \none called “active treatment” under the requirements of the federal-state ICF/MR \nprogram which funds STS. Habilitation means “…measures taken to assist the individual \nto live a full and productive life…” and it is a “… teaching or instructional model of \nservice, with this didactic function included in order to enhance the skills and personal \nself-sufficiency of people with developmental disabilities.”37 \nDr. Skarnulis reviewed and observed a sample of 49 residents (close to 10% of the \npopulation), 23 female and 26 male. The youngest was 40 and the oldest was 82 years \nold. The median age was 56 and the mean age was 58. Only 11 of the 49 were in their \n40s. In both age and other characteristics, the sample mirrored the STS population as a \nwhole.   \nThe report found that the required person centered planning was reflected in residents’ \ndaily lives. \nWe were concerned that their OPS’s reflected individuality and \nuniqueness rather than all having been prepared in ways that made them \nindistinguishable from one another.   What we found was that the level of \ncognitive or physical ability didn’t translate into “cookie cutter” Plans.  \nEach was unique and reflected individual strengths, abilities, needs and \nwants, which in turn were translated into individualized goals for the \ncoming year.38 \nThere were no waiting lists for programs. Echoing the Remedial Plan’s attention to the \naging of STS residents, Dr. Skarnulis noted the special attention which is merited in the \nHabilitation provided to these residents.39 \nWhile STS programs are not cutting edge or innovative,40 they are focused on the \nindividual and, through the OPS/Habilitation Initiative, the programs generally (though \n                                                 \n37 Skarnulis Report at 9. \n38  Skarnulis Report at 12. \n39  The Remedial Plan required an Aging Plan in light of the fact that admissions to STS \nare, and will be, closed, and that services for elder people with developmental disabilities \nis especially challenging. Dr. Skarnulis commented: \nThe age of the population correlates directly with issues involving \nhabilitation, both currently and in the future.  With advancing age, health \nbecomes more central to program planning.  The ability to do strenuous \nphysical labor is reduced.  Reduced stamina, vision and hearing need to be \nconsidered in individual plans.  OPS documents reflect team consideration \nof these issues.  Some clients have chosen to retire and some have a \nreduced number of hours of day programs provided by staff that go to \ntheir residential settings.   \nReport at 12. \n40   \nJanuary 14, 2006  12    Report to the Court No. 60 \n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1373     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 13 of 14(cid:10)\n \nnot universally) are meeting the needs of the residents of STS as detailed in the Remedial \nPlan’s Habilitation requirements.41  \nX.  Conclusion \nDefendants were adjudicated in contempt in 1996 for failure to meet the Habilitation \nrequirements (among others) of the 1986 Consent Decree.  They made a renewed \ncommitment to specific Habilitation requirements in accepting the 1998 Remedial Plan. \nFrom 1998 to 2001, however, Defendants remained in non-compliance with regard to \nHabilitation although, by the end of that period, they were willing to discuss alternative \napproaches to achieving compliance. \nIn 2001, the Special Master suggested that a Joint Committee with representatives of the \nmaster and the parties might formulate a successful strategy. The parties agreed and, in \nearly 2002, after amicable and thoughtful work, the Joint Committee recommended the \nOPS/Habilitation Initiative as a means to transform Habilitation planning and \nimplementation at STS. \nDescribing it as a “dramatic and sweeping” and “perhaps the most significant undertaking \nby Defendants (apart from quality assurance),” the Special Master endorsed the \nOPS/Habilitation Initiative which, at the time, was expected to be complete by January \n                                                                                                                                                \nNone of the campus-based programs observed is what might be considered \n“cutting edge” or innovative.  Workers at the Farm are doing pretty much \nwhat was being done during the early years of institutions (circa 1860-\npresent).  Similarly, restaurants such as Leonardo’s and the Gatehouse [at \nSTS],  were  being  operated  in  Kentucky,  Oklahoma,  Pennsylvania, \nNebraska and other states as early as the 1970’s. It should be noted, \nhowever, that there is one significant difference between the examples \nnoted above and STS.   Historically, farms, restaurants, work crews, work \nstations in industry and other places of employment employed people who \nwere classified as mild, or “borderline” intelligence (a classification level \nabandoned by the AAMD in the mid-1970’s)).  In other words, they were \nvery  capable  individuals  who  required  relatively  little  supervision.  \nHowever, many of the individuals employed in such settings by STS fall \ninto the moderate to severe ranges of mental retardation and receive much \nmore supervision by STS and community agency staff. \nReport at 18-19. \n41 Dr. Skarnulis’ work papers show that he evaluated Defendants to be in compliance for \nthe vast majority of requirements for the vast majority of the clients in his sample. There \nwere few exceptions.  The Remedial Plan does not demand perfection. The Special \nMaster makes a positive compliance determination when clients are not harmed and there \nis an absence of uncorrected systemic issues, even in instances of spotty insignificant \ndeficiencies. Remedial Plan at 8. \nJanuary 14, 2006  13    Report to the Court No. 60 \n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1373     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 14 of 14(cid:10)\n \n2004.42  It took Defendants until about September, 2005 -- more than a year and a half \nlonger -- to expand the initiative fully to all STS residents.43 \nIt is a pleasure to report that, finally, with Defendants having taken 3 ½ years in its \ndevelopment and implementation, the OPS/Habilitation Initiative benefits all the \nresidents of STS.  The Initiative’s vision impressed the Special Master when it was \nadopted in 2002, was applauded by the master’s consultant in its infancy in 2003, and \nnow in its maturity is found to have successfully transformed care at STS.  \nThe Court has noted that “[t]he OPS/Habilitation Initiative is designed to move from \n“deficit driven plans to planning from peoples’ strengths and preferences, ... to a person-\nfocused model.”44  It represents what Case Management Director Kathy Hanewicz \ndescribed as a “culture change” for STS; Ms. Hanewicz explains that “we are attempting \nto get a total different mind-set in people.”45  The master is hopeful that this change will \nbe sustained. \nRecommendation. For the above reasons, the Special Master \nrecommends that the Court release from active judicial oversight all \noutstanding Remedial Plan requirements regarding Habilitation.  \nThe OPS/Habilitation Initiative has now been implemented successfully.  \nThe following Remedial Plan requirements are due for release:  CR 43, \nEC 3 and 4; CR 44, EC 1, 2 and 3; CR 52, EC 3 and 4; and CR 14, EC 2. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n____________________ \nDavid Ferleger \nSpecial Master \nJanuary 13, 2005 \n                                                 \n42 Special Master’s 19th Quarterly Report to the Court at 17-18 (Sept. 10, 2002). \n43  In late 2003, about 100 residents were covered by the Initiative. This number had \nincreased to 465 of 572 residents by June 30, 2005, and to 508 of 568 residents by \nAugust 31, 2005.

Eight years later, Defendants were found in contempt of the\nConsent Decree and the Implementation Plan.  United States v. State\nof Connecticut, 931 F. Supp. 974 (D. Conn. 1996), appeal dismissed,\n1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 21006 (2d Cir., June 13, 1997).  The Court\nappointed a Special Master, and a Remedial Plan [Doc. No. 188] was\ndeveloped by the Special Master and adopted by the Court on April\n21, 1998.  Since that time, the parties, along with the Special\nMaster, have proceeded to review the outstanding Remedial Plan\nrequirements  and  recommend  release  where  appropriate.    In  the\ninterim,  the  parties  negotiated  and  presented  to  the  court  a\nsettlement  agreement (\"the Joint Agreement\")  which proposed an\nalternative means of resolving the few outstanding issues.  This\nCourt  disapproved  that  settlement  agreement  on  July  21,  2005.\nDefendants filed a notice of appeal of the disapproval with the\n2\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1357     Filed 12/12/2005     Page 3 of 10(cid:10)\nSecond Circuit on September 16, 2005.  The United States elected\nnot to join that appeal.  The Defendants have not moved to stay\nproceedings in this Court  pending the appeal, and as of the date\nof  this  ruling,  only  a  few  Court  Requirements  remain  to  be\nreleased.  This Court anticipates that full compliance with the\nRemedial Plan shall be achieved in the first quarter of 2006.\nThe  Messier  plaintiffs  have  sought  participation  in  this\naction in one form or another four times previously; each time,\nthis Court denied permission.  On October 27, 1986, the Connecticut\nAssociation  for  Retarded  Citizens,  Inc.,  now  known  as\nARC/Connecticut, along with six named plaintiffs  (residents of\nSouthbury Training School) sought to intervene in this case.  That\nmotion was denied by this Court on December 22, 1986.  \nSubsequently, on October 6, 1994, ARC/Connecticut along with\neight representative plaintiffs filed a separate action, Messier v.\nSouthbury Training School, No. 3:94CV1706(EBB), and on that same\ndate filed a motion to consolidate Messier with United States v.\nConnecticut.  This Court denied the motion to consolidate on March\n5, 1996. \nOn November 22, 2002, the Messier plaintiffs filed a motion to\nintervene, which motion was denied by this Court on January 7,\n2003.  \nAnd, on April 27, 2004, the Messier plaintiffs filed a motion\nfor permission to file a brief as amici curiae in opposition to the\nUnited  States’  motion  for  determination  regarding  the  Joint\n3\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1357     Filed 12/12/2005     Page 4 of 10(cid:10)\nAgreement.  This Court denied that motion on June 24, 2004.   \nSTANDARD\nA. Intervention as of Right under FED.R.CIV.P. 24(a)\nRule 24(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides,\nin pertinent part:\nUpon timely  application anyone shall  be  permitted to\nintervene in an action: . . . (2) when the applicant\nclaims  an  interest  relating  to  the  property  or\ntransaction which is the subject of the action and the\napplicant is so situated that the disposition of the\naction may as a practical matter impair or impede the\napplicant’s ability to protect that interest, unless the\napplicant’s  interest  is  adequately  represented  by\nexisting parties.\nFED.R.CIV.P. 24(a).  See also Brennan v. N.Y.C. Bd. of Educ., 260\nF.3d 123, 128 (2d Cir. 2001); Butler, Fitzgerald & Potter v. Sequa\nCorp., 250 F.3d 171, 176 (2d Cir. 2001); New York News, Inc. v.\nKheel, 972 F.2d 482, 485 (2d Cir. 1992).  \"For an interest to be\ncognizable under Rule 24(a)(2), it must be ‘direct, substantial,\nand legally protectable.’\"  United States v. Peoples Benefit Life\nIns. Co., 271 F.3d 411, 415 (2d Cir. 2001) (quoting Washington\nElec. Coop., Inc. v. Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 922\nF.2d 92, 97 (2d Cir. 1990)) (citations omitted). \"Intervention is\na procedural device that attempts to accommodate two competing\npolicies: efficiently administrating legal disputes by resolving\nall related issues in one lawsuit, on the one hand, and keeping a\nsingle lawsuit from becoming unnecessarily complex, unwieldy or\nprolonged, on the other hand.\"  United States v. Pitney Bowes,\nInc., 25 F.3rd 66, 69 (2d Cir. 1994).  The court has discretion in\n4\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1357     Filed 12/12/2005     Page 5 of 10(cid:10)\ndetermining when intervention is appropriate.  Washington Elec.\nCoop., 922 F.2d at 97. \nTimeliness\nWhether an application is timely is a decision within the\ndiscretion of the district court.  The Second Circuit has held that\namong the circumstances courts should consider are: \"(1) how long\nthe applicant had notice of the interest before it made the motion\nto intervene; (2) prejudice to existing parties resulting from any\ndelay; (3) prejudice to the applicant if the motion is denied; and\n(4) any unusual circumstances militating for or against a finding\nof timeliness.\" Id. at 70.  Here, both the United States and the\nState of Connecticut argue that the Messier plaintiffs’ motion to\nintervene is not timely in that the movants knew of the Court’s\nconsideration of the Joint Agreement for over a year and did not\nseek to intervene until now.  The movants argue that granting the\nmotion will not unduly delay or prejudice the rights of the parties\nto this action \"in that only a vigorous opposition to the State’s\nappeal will ensure the prompt completion of the remedial process.\"\nMotion to Intervene at 6.  The remedial process has continued to\noperate during the pendency of the State’s appeal; the State has\nnot sought to stay proceedings in the district court.  Intervention\nat this late date, when the parties and the Court anticipate full\ncompliance with the Remedial Plan in the first quarter of 2006,\nwill  inevitably  lead  to  a  delay  in  these  proceedings,  thereby\nsignificantly prejudicing the existing parties.  The Court finds no\n5\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1357     Filed 12/12/2005     Page 6 of 10(cid:10)\nprejudice to the Messier plaintiffs if the motion is denied on\ntimeliness grounds.  As oft stated by this Court in the rulings on\nthe  Messier  plaintiffs’  prior  motions  to  participate  in  this\naction,  the  Messier  plaintiffs  can  and  are  pursuing  their\nConstitutional rights in a separate action.  \nImpairment of Messier plaintiffs’ ability to protect their\ninterests\nThe intervenors also claim that the disposition of this action\nwill  impair  or  impede  their  ability  to  protect  their  interest\nbecause the United States entered into a settlement agreement \"that\ndoes not accord proper deference to the Remedial Orders, . . . the\nparties have been found to have needlessly delayed the remedial\nprocess by seventeen months, and . . . [because] the parties have\ndecided to pursue an appeal rather than bring this matter to a\nprompt conclusion.\"  Mem. in Support at 24.  This Court never held\nthat  the  parties  needlessly  delayed  the  remedial  process  by\nseventeen months, and, although the State has appealed this Court’s\ndisapproval  of  the  Joint  Agreement,  the  United  States  has  not\njoined that effort and neither party has moved for a stay of the\nproceedings in this Court.  Thus, review of compliance with the\nRemedial Orders is ongoing, and intervention at this time, shortly\nbefore this Court expects this litigation to be resolved, either\nalong the path followed since the Remedial Orders were issued or\nthrough the appeal of the denial of the settlement agreement, will\nlead  to  a  delay  which  would  itself  likely  impair  intervenors’\nability to protect their interests. \n6\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1357     Filed 12/12/2005     Page 7 of 10(cid:10)\nInterest adequately represented by existing parties \nThe intervenors assert that \"where a proposed intervenor’s\ninterests  are  otherwise  unrepresented,  the  standard  for\nintervention is no more burdensome than the standing requirement.\"\nMem. in Support of Motion to Intervene at 20.  Nearly nineteen\nyears ago this Court found that the Connecticut Association for\nRetarded Citizens and six individual residents at STS failed to\novercome the presumption that representation by the government in\nthe  context  of  this  CRIPA  action  is  adequate.    See  Ruling  on\nPending Motions [Doc. No. 34] at 6-7 (December 22, 1986).  Nothing\nhas changed in the intervening years to cause this Court to find\nintervention by the Messier plaintiffs should be permitted.  As the\nSecond Circuit has cautioned, \"we have demanded a more rigorous\nshowing of inadequacy in cases where the putative intervenor and a\nnamed party have the same ultimate objective.\"   Butler, 250 F.3d\nat 179 (citation omitted).  Here, the Messier plaintiffs assert\nthat only they can adequately represent the interests of class\nmembers,  in  that,  under  CRIPA,  the  \"Attorney  General  does  not\ndirectly  represent  any  institutionalized  plaintiffs,  and  the\nauthority granted him is in no way intended to preclude, delay or\nprejudice  private  litigants.\"    Mem.  in  Support  of  Motion  to\nIntervene at 24-25.  This Court stated as much in its December 22,\n1986 ruling, noting that \"these parties remain free to pursue any\nindividual claims they may have concerning the conditions at STS in\na separate action\" because 42 U.S.C. § 1997j specifically disclaims\n7\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1357     Filed 12/12/2005     Page 8 of 10(cid:10)\nany expansion or restriction on the rights of private parties to\nenforce legal rights granted them by existing law.  See Ruling on\nPending Motions at 7, 2.  The government has proceeded under CRIPA\nsince  1986  to  ensure  the  constitutional  rights  of  persons\ninstitutionalized at STS.  Only the Attorney General, for or in the\nname of the United States, is authorized to initiate a civil action\nunder CRIPA.  The intervenors have pursued their own private action\nto remedy unconstitutional conditions at STS and to address issues\nof community placement.  \"Where there is an identity of interest\nbetween a putative intervenor and a party, adequate representation\nis assured.\"  Washington Elec. Coop., 922 F.2d at 98.  Though the\napproach and motivation may be different, both the United States\nand  the  Messier  plaintiffs  seek  to  correct  constitutional\ndeficiencies in the care of persons institutionalized at STS.  \"[A]\nputative  intervenor’s  interest  is  not  inadequately  represented\nmerely because its motive to litigate is different from that of a\nparty  to  the  action.\"    Id.    Intervenors  fail  to  overcome  the\npresumption that representation by the United States in this CRIPA\naction is adequate.\nB. Permissive Intervention under Rule 24(b)\nRule 24(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides,\nin relevant part:\nUpon  timely  application  anyone  may  be  permitted  to\nintervene in an action: (1) when a statute of the United\nStates confers a conditional right to intervene; or (2)\nwhen an applicant’s claim or defense and the main action\nhave a  question  of law or fact in common. . . . In\nexercising  its  discretion  the  court  shall  consider\n8\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1357     Filed 12/12/2005     Page 9 of 10(cid:10)\nwhether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice\nthe adjudication of the rights of the original parties.\nFED.R.CIV.P. 24(a).  The Messier plaintiffs also seek intervention\nbecause they assert that issues of fact and questions of law in\nMessier are common to those in this action, especially under the\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Intervenors argue\nthat their participation will serve the ends of judicial economy\nand that no compelling argument can be made that their intervention\nwill unduly delay or prejudice the rights of the existing parties\nto this action.  Mem. in Support of Motion to Intervene at 26-27.\nIntervenors allege that Defendants have not purged themselves of\ncontempt since 1995.  Defendants have made great progress toward\ncompliance with all outstanding Court Requirements in the Remedial\nPlan  and  this  Court  anticipates  that  full  compliance  will  be\nachieved in the first quarter of 2006.  To now allow the Messier\nplaintiffs to interject new issues into this litigation would not\nserve the ends of judicial economy.  Even if intervention would\nserve the ends of judicial economy, this Court must deny permissive\nintervention as inevitably it will lead to an unnecessarily complex\nand protracted process in this action, thereby prejudicing the\nrights of the existing parties.  See Pitney Bowes, 25 F.3d at 69.\nCONCLUSION\nHaving  found  that the intervenors’ interest is  adequately\nrepresented by existing parties, the Messier plaintiffs’ Motion to\nIntervene in the Remedial Proceedings in the District court and in\nthe State’s Appeal [Doc. No. 1334] as of right under FED.R.CIV.P.\n9\n\nCase 3:86-cv-00252-EBB     Document 1357     Filed 12/12/2005     Page 10 of 10(cid:10)\n24(a) is DENIED.\nHaving  also  found  that  intervention  will  unduly  delay  or\nprejudice the adjudication of the rights of the existing parties,\nthe Messier plaintiffs’ motion for permissive intervention under\nFED.R.CIV.P. 24(b) is also DENIED.\nSO ORDERED.\n______________________________\nELLEN BREE BURNS, SENIOR JUDGE\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nDated at New Haven, CT, this ____day of December, 2005.\n10",
