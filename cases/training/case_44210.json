INTRODUCTION \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 1   Filed 08/24/23   Page 2 of 16    PageID 2\n  Plaintiffs, the Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association, Inc. (hereinafter “BFAA”) \nand Thomas Burrell respectfully seek judicial review of final agency action by the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture in connection with implementation of Section 22007 of the Inflation \nReduction Act (hereinafter “IRA”) Pub. L. 117-169 136 Stat. 1818.  The IRA was signed into law \nby President Biden on August 16, 2022.  The IRA provides $2.2 Billion dollars in financial \nassistance to farmers, ranchers and forest landowners who prior to January 1, 2021, experienced \ndiscrimination in a USDA farm lending program. Following enactment of the IRA, USDA \nundertook measures to implement Section 22007.  In that connection, USDA announced on July \n7, 2023, that it had promulgated a Discrimination Financial Assistance Program, (hereinafter \n“DFAP”) Under DFAP persons discriminated against in a USDA loan program prior to January 1, \n2021, are required to submit applications to DFAP administrators for financial assistance by \nOctober 31, 2023.  Plaintiffs seek an order here suspending the October 31, 2023 deadline  for the \nreason the deadline is  arbitrary and capricious, violative of separation of powers and Due Process. \nThe hardship imposed by the deadline on BFAA members with legacy applications, those being \nsubmitted on behalf of deceased farmers whose heirs must obtain probate court or other judicial \nauthority in order to apply, the complexity of the USDA application process , past experience  in \nrelation to processing financial assistance applications and the lack of Congressional authority for \nthe deadline,combine to render  the October 31,2023 deadline both   untenable and unlawful.. \n  In past instances where USDA has provided financial assistance to farmers discriminated \nagainst by USDA, discrimination claimants were required to submit a mere three page application \nfor relief financial assistance and the application window was open for significantly longer. By \ncontrast, See, Exhibit A for a copy of the current  DFAP application. The application at Exhibit A \nis 40 pages in length.  The application window is a mere  116 days. There is no authority in Section \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 1   Filed 08/24/23   Page 3 of 16    PageID 3\n22007 for this shortened application period. The shortened application window is unjustified as \nCongress stated in §22007 that funds are available for financial assistance until September 30, \n2031. Plaintiffs are aggrieved by the shortened application window. \nII.  HISTORY \n1.  Over the past several years, USDA has resolved discrimination lawsuits with \nseveral different groups of farmers. These lawsuits, challenged discrimination in USDA's lending \nprograms. The United States Circuit Court of Appeals stated in The Estate of Earnest Lee Boyland, \net al. v. United States Department of Agriculture, Case No. 17-5082, a case involving BFAA \nmembers, “farmers’ bottom lines fluctuate with the weather and crop prices, so \"many farmers \ndepend heavily on the credit and benefit programs of the United States Department of Agriculture \nto take them from one year to the next.\" Pigford v. Glickman (Pigford I), 185 F.R.D. 82, 86 (D.D.C. \n1999) (footnote omitted). If a farmer's crops fail, \"he may not have sufficient resources to buy \nseeds to plant in the following season\"; if he needs a new grain harvester, \"he often cannot afford \nto buy the harvester without an extension of credit.\" Id. \"Because of the seasonal nature of farming, \nit also is of utmost importance that credit and benefit applications be processed quickly or the \nfarmer may lose all or most of his anticipated income for an entire year.\" Id.   \n2.  The Boyland Court also stated, “public protests over discrimination in USDA's \ncredit and benefit programs spurred the Department to investigate. That scrutiny uncovered a \nwidespread pattern of discrimination in the Department's agricultural credit and benefit programs. \nIn 1996, then-Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman appointed a Civil Rights Action Team to \nassess the Department's history of racial discrimination and recommend changes. See id. at 88. \nThe Action Team documented extensive economic harm to minority farmers from discrimination \nin USDA programs. See id. at 86-88. That discrimination owed partly to USDA's practice of \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 1   Filed 08/24/23   Page 4 of 16    PageID 4\ndelegating loan application decisions to small, local committees in each county. Id. at 86. The \ncounty committees were far less diverse than the communities they served. Id. at 87. USDA denied \nor delayed processing loan applications, approved insufficient amounts, discriminatorily denied \naccess to loan servicing options, or imposed restrictive conditions on loans because of the \napplicants' race, sex, or ethnicity. See Fourth Am. Compl. 3, Love v. Veneman, No. 1:00-cv-02502 \n(D.D.C. July 13, 2012), ECF No. 160 (female farmers); Eighth Am. Compl. 2, Keepseagle v. \nVeneman, No. 1:99-cv-03119 (D.D.C. Feb. 11, 2008), ECF No. 460 (Native American farmers); \nThird Am. Compl. 13, Garcia v. Veneman, No. 1:00cv-02445 (D.D.C. June 30, 2006), ECF No. \n144 (Hispanic farmers); Pigford .1, 185 F.R.D. at 87 (black farmers).  claims formed the core of \nthe four lawsuits filed against USDA on behalf of black, Native American, women, and Hispanic \nfarmers.   \n3.  In 1998, Congress responded to the farmers' predicament by lifting the time bar for \nfarmers who had made timely efforts to seek administrative redress for credit discrimination but \nwere stymied by the dysfunction at USDA. See 7 U.S.C. § 2279 note (Omnibus Consolidated and \nEmergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999, Pub. L. No. 105-277, § 741, 112 Stat. 2681) \n(\"Appropriations Act\"). The Appropriations Act tolled the statute of limitations for two years after \nits passage from October 1998 to October 2000— for people who (1) alleged non-employment-\nrelated discrimination by USDA occurring between January 1, 1981, and December 31, 1996, and \n(20 had filed a complaint with USDA before July 1, 1997.   \n4.  To date, USDA has resolved the discrimination lawsuits of four groups of farmers. \nFor each group, the only farmers permitted to participate in the claims-resolution processes \nestablished in response to these cases were those who had, before the suits were filed, complained \nin some manner of USDA's discrimination. Framework for Hispanic or Female Farmers' Claims \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 1   Filed 08/24/23   Page 5 of 16    PageID 5\nProcess ⁋⁋ VIII.A VII.B, VIII.C.1 g. Love, No. 1:00-cv-02502 (D.D.C. Jan. 20, 2012), ECF No. \n155-1 (\"Garcia/ Love Framework\"); Keepseagle, No. 1:99-cv-03119, 2001 W1, 34676944, at *6 \n(D.D.C. Dec. 12, 2001); Pigford I, 185 F.R.D. at 92. \n5.  USDA settled with the class of Black Farmers first, in 1999, in Pigford I. 185 F.R.D. \n82. The court approved the creation of a two-track dispute resolution mechanism for distributing \nproceeds  to  claimants.  Under  that  process,  claimants  with  less  documentary  evidence  of \ndiscrimination received capped payments, while claimants with more documentary evidence could \nseek to prove and recover actual damages. Pigford I, 185 F.R.D. at 95-97.  \nIn order to be eligible for relief, a claimant must submit his completed claim \npackage to the facilitator postmarked within 180 days of the date of entry of this \nConsent Decree, except that a claimant whose claim is otherwise timely shall have \nnot less than 30 days to submit a declaration pursuant to subparagraph (b)(iii), \nabove, after being \n \n(g) A claimant who satisfies the definition of the class in ¶ 2(a), above, but who \nfails to submit a completed claim package within 180 days of entry of this Consent \nDecree may petition the Court to permit him to nonetheless participate in the claims \nresolution procedures. The Court shall grant such a petition only where the claimant \ndemonstrates that his failure to submit a timely claim was due to extraordinary \ncircumstances beyond his control. \n \nPigford v. Glickman, 185 F.R.D. 82 (D.D.C. 1999) (Emphasis added.  \n6.  The process established in Pigford I became a template for the other cases. Next, \nUSDA settled a class action suit with Native American farmers. See Keepseagle, No. 1:99-cv-\n03119, 2012 WL 13098692, at *1 (D.D.C. Dec. 28, 2012). Similar lawsuits by Hispanic and female \nfarmers followed, but did not result in class-wide settlements because neither case was certified as \na class action. Garcia v. Johanns, 444 F.3d 625 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (Hispanic farmers); Love v. \nJohanns, 439 F.3d 723 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (female farmers). Instead, USDA voluntarily created a \njoint  claims  process  for  both  Hispanic  and  female  farmers.  See  Garcia/Love  Framework. \nClaimants who wished to recover under the Garcia /Love Framework agreed, in the claim packets \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 1   Filed 08/24/23   Page 6 of 16    PageID 6\nthey  submitted,  to  release  their  individual  claims  against  USDA.  See  id.  ⁋  5;  Settlement \nAgreement, Love, No. 1:00-cv-02502 (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2017), ECF No. 2751. \n7.  Despite the various efforts outlined above, discrimination problems have continued \nto plague USDA’s lending programs. \n8.  As  a  result,  Congress  enacted  a  race-based  discrimination  loan-forgiveness \nprogram in the American Rescue Plan of 2021 (ARPA). Among other things, ARPA provided debt \nrelief to “socially disadvantaged” farmers and ranchers. The phrase “socially disadvantaged” \nincluded racial classifications. To be eligible for ARPA’s debt relief, farmers and ranchers had to \nbe Black or African American, American Indian or Alaskan native, Hispanic of Latino, or Asian \nAmerican or Pacific Islander. This program was codified in §1006 of ARPA.  \n9.  The race-based criterion for relief under §1006 of the ARPA, was challenged in \nmultiple cases that alleged that these racial classifications violated the Equal Protection Clause of \nthe United States Constitution. The program was therefore suspended.  \n10.  In response to Equal Protection challenges §1006 of the ARPA was amended by \n§22007 of IRA. \n11. Section 22007 states:  \nSection 1006 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (7 U.S.C. 2279 note; Public Law \n117-2) is amended to read as follows: \n(e) DISCRIMINATION FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.—In addition to amounts otherwise \navailable, there is appropriated to the Secretary of Agriculture for fiscal year 2022, to \nremain available until September 30, 2031, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise \nappropriated, $2,200,000,000 for a program to provide financial assistance, including the \ncost of any financial assistance, to farmers, ranchers, or forest landowners determined to \nhave experienced discrimination prior to January 1, 2021, in. Department of Agriculture \nfarm lending programs, under which the amount of financial assistance provided to a \nrecipient may be not more than $500,000, as determined to be appropriate based on any \nconsequences experienced from the discrimination, which program shall be administered \nthrough 1 or more qualified nongovernmental entities selected by the Secretary subject to \nstandards set and enforced by the Secretary. (Emphasis added.) \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 1   Filed 08/24/23   Page 7 of 16    PageID 7\n12.  On July 7, 2023 USDA published application guidelines to implement §22007. \n13.  Among these guidelines is a no exceptions October 31, 2023 application deadline. \n14.  For reasons explained below given the history, timing and process involved for \nPlaintiffs to submit an application for relief under §22007, the October 31, 2023 deadline is \narbitrary, capricious, not rationally related to any legitimate governmental goal violative of \nseparation of powers and Due Process and was not authorized by Congress. For these reasons, \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that this Honorable Court suspend the October 31,2023 deadline.  \nIII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n15.  This Court has jurisdiction over this complaint under 28 U.S.C. §1331, §2201, and \n5 U.S.C. §702-706, because this case presents  substantial questions of Constitutional and federal \nlaw, specifically whether Section 22007 of IRA and Defendants’ implementation of that section is \narbitrary and capricious, violative of Separation of Power and Due Process and authorized by \nCongress. \n16.  This Court has authority to issue a declaratory judgment and to order injunctive \nrelief and other relief that is necessary and proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and 2202. \n17.  Venue is appropriate in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1). A substantial part \nof the events giving rise to this claim occurred in this district, Defendants maintain one or more \noffices and employees in this district, a substantial part of the property subject to this action is \nsituated in this district, and a plaintiff resides in this district. \nIV.  PARTIES \n18.  Plaintiff, Black Farmers & Agriculturalists Association, Inc. (BMA) is a not-for-\nprofit organization created for the specific purpose of responding to the issues and concerns of \nBlack  ranchers  in  the  United  States  and  abroad.  Formed  in  1997,  the  organization  has  a \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 1   Filed 08/24/23   Page 8 of 16    PageID 8\nmembership of more than one thousand live hundred (1,500) farmers nationwide, and 21 state \nchapters. BFAA was also organized to monitor the conduct of the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nand the historic 1999 class action lawsuit, Pigford v. Glickman, 185 F.R.D. 82 (D.D.C. 1999) \n(hereinafter \"Pigford”).1 \n19.  Thomas Burrell, is a farmer and President of BFAA. Mr. Burrell is representative \nof other BFAA members who have claims that meet Section 22007’s eligibility criteria.  BFAA \nhas among its membership individuals with qualifying claims that must be asserted on behalf of a \ndecedents’  estates.  For  instance  BFAA  has  persistently  pursued  relief  from  USDA  racial \ndiscrimination on behalf of the Estate of David Shelton, the Estate of Lee Sylvester Caldwell and \nthe Estate of Earnest Lee Bayland in United States District Court, Case No. 15-cv-1112 (TSC).  \nThese claims, and others like them referred to herein as “Legacy Claims” until now have been \ndeemed time-barred. BFAA members legacy claims may qualify for §22007 assistance. \n \n1 The historical context that gives rise to this litigation and the need for BMA was summarized by the district court \nin its order approving settlement as follows: \n \nForty acres and a mule. That was the promise made by the government to those former slaves who wanted to \nfarm land in the South after the Civil War. As detailed in this Court's opinion in Pigford I, for most  African-\nAmericans the promise of forty acres and a mule was never kept, and the United States Department of \nAgriculture and the county commissioners to whom it delegated so much power bear much of the \nresponsibility for the broken promise to those African-American farmers and their descendants. Pigford v. \nGlickman, 185 F.R.D. at 85. In the early I900's, there were 925,000 African-American farmers in the United \nStates farming 16 million acres of farmland. By the time the Court approved the Pigford I consent decree, \nthere were fewer than 18,000 African-American farms in the United States and African-American farmers \nowned less than three million acres of land. Id. As the Court said 12 years ago in approving the consent \ndecree,\" [n]othing can completely undo the discrimination of the past or restore lost land or lost opportunities\" \nto the many African-American farmers who were part of the Pigford I class. Id. at 112. Historical \ndiscrimination cannot be undone, but the Pigford I consent decree was a significant first step, a step that had \nbeen a long time coming. And, as described earlier in this Opinion, supra at 9, nearly 16,000 African-\nAmerican farmers received a total of more than $1 billion through the claims process created by the settlement \nof that historic case.\" \n \nDocket No. 232, p. 69. \n  BFAA's purpose is to assist Black farmers, many of whom are sharecroppers or descendants of sharecroppers, \nin connection with their understanding of and participation in this settlement process as well as to seek prospective \nrelief on their behalf. \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 1   Filed 08/24/23   Page 9 of 16    PageID 9\n20.  Defendant Thomas J. Vilsack is the Secretary of Agriculture. He is responsible for \nleading the USDA, which includes the FSA. Under Section 22007 of IRA. Defendant Vilsack is \nrequired to provide debt relief to farmers who have experienced discrimination prior to 2021.  \n21.  Defendant  Zack Ducheneaux was appointed Administrator for USDA’s Farm \nService Agency on February 22, 2021. In this role Ducheneaux provides leadership and direction \non agricultural policy, administering loan programs, and managing conservation, commodity, \ndisaster, and farm marketing. Programs through a national network of offices including offices in \nthe Western District of Tennessee.  \nV.  FACTS COMMON TO ALL COUNTS \n22.  On July 7, 2023, USDA announced DFAP, USDA issued a forty page DFAP \napplication that must be submitted by October 31, 2023.  IRA Section §22007, which authorized \nDFAP financial assistance, states assistance funds are available through September 30, 2031. \nSection  22007  does  not  authorize  the  unduly  brief    application  window  promulgated  by \nDefendants. \nTHE RULEMAKING \n23.  According to USDA, following signing of the IRA, USDA undertook steps to \nconvene listening sessions and seek public comment about the design of the program to ensure \nthat farmers, advocates, academics, legislators. tribal governments, and other experts were heard. \nUSDA has committed to making payments to farmers no later than early 2024.  \n24.  With this public feedback taken into account, in March 2023. USDA announced \nthe basic structure of the prop am. The IRA specifies that financial assistance must be delivered to \nimpacted producers by nongovernmental program administrators. \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 1   Filed 08/24/23   Page 10 of 16    PageID 10\n25.  In early May, USDA signed contracts with three vendors who, together, constitute \na national administrator and four regional hubs. The vendors are working together to solicit \napplications from eligible farmers, provide technical assistance, and make decisions about each \ncase (following rides set by USDA). \n26.  The  vendors  include  Midtown  Group,  serving  as  the  national  administrator; \nWindsor Group, serving producers in the eastern regions of the U.S. and Analytic Acquisitions, \nserving the western regions. The national administrator will manage all aspects of the application \nprocess including making determinations on applications. while the regional hubs will conduct \noutreach and technical assistance in addition to providing recommendations on applications. \nPlaintiffs are within the jurisdiction of the Windsor Group. \n27.  Applications are due October 31, 2023 –USDA has stated, unlike in past instances \nsuch as Pigford there will be no extensions. The specific deadline depends on the application \nsubmission method: \n•  U.S. or overnight mail must be postmarked by October 31, 2023 \n•  Efiling; by 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time, October 31, 2023 \n•  In person, at a regional office: by 8 p.m. local time on October 31, 2023. \n28.  The October 31, 2023  deadline does not advance any compelling governmental \ninterest. It is arbitrary and capricious. The deadline is unreasonable given the complexity of the \napplication. See, Exhibits B, C and D for examples of the application form  in previous instances. \nSection 22007 does not authorize the October 31, 2023 deadline or its  no exceptions policy. \n29.  The  deadline  under  Section  22007  of  IRA  does  not  advance  a  compelling \ngovernmental interest, invades the exclusive province of Congress and deprives Plaintiffs of Due \nProcess. Accordingly, it may be challenged under the Administrative Procedures Act. \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 1   Filed 08/24/23   Page 11 of 16    PageID 11\nVI.  LEGAL FRAMEWORK \nADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \n30.  Agency actions are reviewed deferentially.  Courts may not set aside or hold \nunlawful an agency action unless that action is arbitrary,  capricious, an abuse of discretion or \notherwise not in accordance with law. Bangura v. Hansen, 434 F. 3d 487, 502 (6th Cir. 2006) \n(citing 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)). “An agency decision is arbitrary and capricious if the agency fails \nto examine relevant evidence or articulate a satisfactory explanation for the decision.” Id The Court \ncan not supply a reasoned basis for the agency’s action that the agency itself has not given.”  Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Assn v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 103 S. Ct. 2856, 77 L. Ed. \n2d 443 (1983). \n31.  The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) waives the sovereign immunity of the \nUnited States and its federal agencies for challenges to final agency action that seek relief other \nthan monetary damages. In enables parties who are adversely affected or aggrieved by agency \naction to seek judicial review thereof. 5 U.S.C. §§702, 704. \n32.  The APA also specifically authorizes courts to postpose the effective date of an \nagency action when warranted. 5 U.S.C. §705 (“[T]o the extent necessary to prevent irreparable \ninjury, the reviewing court…may issue all necessary and appropriate process to postpone the \neffective date of an agency action or to preserve status or rights pending conclusion of the review \nproceedings.”) \n33.  Plaintiffs in this action have been adversely affected by USDA’s arbitrary and \ncapricious establishment of a no exceptions rigid application filing date of October 31, 2023.  \n34.  The October 31, 2023 deadline is a final agency action. Immediate judicial review \nis respectfully requested as Plaintiffs have no other adequate remedy in Court.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 1   Filed 08/24/23   Page 12 of 16    PageID 12\n35.  The October 31, 2023 deadline is the consummation of USDA’s implementation of \nSection 22007. \n36.  Legal consequences, a non appealable permanent bar to DFAP relief ,will flow \nfrom failure to meet the October 31, 2023 DFAP deadline.  \n37.  Plaintiffs are aggrieved by this arbitrary deadline and hereby respectfully seek an \norder suspending the deadline.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT 1 (SEPARATION OF POWERS) \n38.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all prior and subsequent paragraphs.  \n39.  Section 22007 centralizes vast power in the hands of USDA, without the ordinary \nprotections  of  due  process,  to  decide  the  fate  of  farmers  who  have  been  victimized  by \ndiscrimination. \n40.  No principle is more central to the design of the Constitution than the separation of \npowers. See, Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce, et al. v. Xavier Becerra, S.D. Ohio Case No. \n3:23-cv-00156. \n41.  Article I of the Constitution vests legislative Powers\" in the \"Congress of the United \nStates.\" U.S. Const. art. 1, § 1 . Article II vests the executive power -the power to implement the \nlaws in the President. Article III vests the judicial power the power to interpret the laws in the \ncourts.2 Id. \n42.  To protect that fundamental separation of powers, the Supreme Court has long \ndistinguished between certain  \"important  subjects,  which must be entirely  regulated by the \n \n2 Any power exercised by USDA must come from the President or be specifically authorized by Congress. \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 1   Filed 08/24/23   Page 13 of 16    PageID 13\nlegislature itself\" and \"those of less interest,\" as to which Congress may afford the executive branch \ndiscretion \"to fill up the details.\" Wayman v Southard, 23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 1, 42-43 (1825). Id. \n43.  The Supreme Court has accordingly invalidated statutes that confer \"virtually \nunfettered\" discretion on the executive branch to control broad swaths of the private economy. \nA.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495,542 (1935) (invalidating delegation \nto create code of industrial conduct that fosters \"fair competition\"); see also Panama Relining Co. \nRyan, 293 U.S. 388 (1935) (invalidating delegation to ban petroleum shipments in excess of state \nproduction quotas).Id. \n44.  In Schechter Poultry, the Court emphasized the lack of \"judicial review to give \nassurance that the action of the commission is taken within its statutory authority\" and the absence \nof \"appropriate administrative procedure\" to ensure due process. 295 U.S. at 533, 541 . In Panama \nRefining, the Court highlighted the failure to constrain the executive branch with any \"standard or \nrule\" of decision. 293 U.S. at 418. Id.  \n45.  Under the Supreme Court's modern precedents, a statutory delegation is invalid if \nit fails to constrain the agency with an \"'intelligible principle.'\" Gundy v. United States, 139 S. Ct. \n21 16, 2129 (2019) (plurality op.) (quoting J.W. Hampton, Jr, & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. \n394, 409 (1928)). This \"intelligible principle\" must at least be \"sufficiently definite and precise to \nenable Congress, the courts and the public to ascertain whether the [agency] . . . has conformed\" \nto Congress's direction. Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 426 (1944). \n46.  Courts have also consistently recognized that \"judicial review is a factor weighing \nin favor of upholding a statute against a nondelegation challenge.\" United Stales v. Garfinkel, 29 \nF.3d 451, 458-59 (8th Cir. 1994) (quoting United States v. Bozarov, 974 F.2d 1037, 1042 (9th Cir. \n1992)) (collecting cases). Similarly, \"compliance with . . . requirements for notice and comment\" \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 1   Filed 08/24/23   Page 14 of 16    PageID 14\nenhances public accountability and thereby functions as a check on agency discretion. Id.; cf: \nPanama Ref Co., 293 U.S. at 415 (noting the importance of written findings). \n47.  A lack of due process protections exacerbates the separation-of-powers concerns \nraised by a broad administrative delegation.  \n48.  There is no justification for USDA being permitted to arrogate unto itself the \npowers to set a firm no extensions deadline policy, when under §22007 Congress has given USDA \nuntil September 30, 2031 to expend the funds appropriated for financial assistance.  \n49.  The October 31, 2023 violates separation of powers because it gives USDA total \nauthority to set an arbitrary deadline. \n50.  Plaintiffs have been aggrieved by this unduly short ap[plication window  and \nrequests its suspension.  \nCOUNT 2 (DUE PROCESS) \n51.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all prior and subsequent paragraphs.  \n52.  The United States Supreme Court has stated: \nThe extent to which procedural due process must be afforded the recipient is \ninfluenced by the extent to which he may be \"condemned to suffer grievous loss,\" \nJoint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U. S. 123, 341 U. S. 168 \n(1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring), and depends upon whether the recipient's \ninterest in avoiding that loss outweighs the governmental interest in summary \nadjudication. Accordingly, as we said in Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union v. \nMcElroy, 367 U. S. 886, 367 U. S. 895 (1961), \"consideration of what procedures \ndue process may require under any given set of circumstances must begin with a \ndetermination of the precise nature of the government function involved, as well \nas… \n \nSee, Galdberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970). \n \n53.  The  Fifth  Amendment’s  Due  Process  Clause  prohibits  the  government  from \ndepriving a person of property without adhering to constitutionally sufficient procedures. See, Ky. \nDept. of Corr. V. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 460 (1989), notice and an opportunity to be heard. \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 1   Filed 08/24/23   Page 15 of 16    PageID 15\n54.  The Due Process Clause requires notice and an opportunity to be heard “at a \nmeaningful time and in a meaningful manner.” Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965); \nsee also, Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 333 (1976). Due process requires procedural \nprotections to prevent, to the extent possible, an erroneous deprivation of property. See, Gilbert v. \nHomar, 520 U.S. 924, 930-32 (1997). \n55.  Section 22007, as implemented by USDA, gives affected farmers no opportunity to \nbe heard concerning reasons an application can not be submitted by October 31, 2023..  \n56.  BFAA  member legacy claims requires BFAA members to complete within the 116 \nday window a complex forty page application. In cases where the aggrieved farmer has died, \nUSDA has stated heirs of these applicants must have written authority to pursue the decedent’s \nclaims. There is no authority in §22007 for such a draconian administrative deadline. \n57.  The DFAP deadline is unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment and must be \nenjoined.  \nRELIEF REQUESTED \nBy reasons of the above, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \nA.  Declare that the October 31, 2023 application deadline violative of separation of \npowers; \nB.  Declaire that the October 31, 2023 application deadline violative of Due Process \nClause of the Fifth Amendment; \nC.  Immediately  suspend  the  October  31,  2023  deadline  pending  resolution  of \nPlaintiffs’ declaratory judgment action; \nD.  Award Plaintiffs reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, plus interest and accruing \nthereon; and \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 1   Filed 08/24/23   Page 16 of 16    PageID 16\nE.

INTRODUCTION \n  Plaintiffs, the Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association, Inc. (hereinafter “BFAA”), \nThomas Burrell, Mary Ferguson, Claudette Jackson, and  Mauzie J. Furlow, respectfully seek \njudicial review of final agency action by the United States Department of Agriculture in connection \nwith implementation of Section 22007 of the Inflation Reduction Act (hereinafter “IRA”) Pub. L. \n117-169 136 Stat. 1818.  The IRA was signed into law by President Biden on August 16, 2022.  \nThe IRA provides $2.2 Billion dollars in financial assistance to farmers, ranchers and forest \nlandowners who prior to January 1, 2021, experienced discrimination in a USDA farm lending \nprogram. Following enactment of the IRA, USDA undertook measures to implement Section \n22007.  In that connection, USDA initially announced on July 7, 2023, that USDA had established \na Discrimination Financial Assistance Program, (hereinafter “DFAP”) Under DFAP persons \ndiscriminated against in a USDA loan program prior to January 1, 2021, were initially required to \nsubmit applications for financial assistance by October 31, 2023.  On September 23, 2023, USDA \nextended the October 31, 2023 deadline until January 13, 2024. The January 13, 2024 deadline is \narbitrary and capricious, violative of separation of powers and Due Process for the reason BFAA \nmembers such as Plaintiffs Jackson and Ferguson, with legacy applications, those being submitted \non behalf of deceased farmers whose heirs must obtain probate court or other judicial authority in \norder to apply, the complexity of the USDA application process and past experience indicate the \ndeadline is both untenable and unlawful.  In addition to the establishment by USDA of an arbitrary \nand capricious application deadline, USDA has without authority and contrary to the express terms \nof Section 22007,  limited relief to discrimination in connection with  USDA Farm loans rather \nthan all USDA lending programs as mandated by Section 22007, lending programs applicable to \napplicants  such as Plaintiff Furlow, an applicant for a USDA housing loan. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc     Document 41     Filed 10/10/23     Page 3 of 22 \nPageID 330\n  In past instances where USDA has provided financial assistance to farmers discriminated \nagainst by USDA, discrimination claimants were required to submit a mere three page application \nfor relief financial assistance and the application window was open for significantly longer. See, \nExhibit A, ECF Docket No. 1-1, Page ID #18, for a copy of the DFAP application. The application \nis 40 pages in length.  The application window has now been extended, but for  a mere 74 days. \nThere is no authority in Section 22007 for this shortened application period. The shortened \napplication window is unjustified as Congress stated in §22007 that funds are available for \nfinancial assistance until September 30, 2031. Plaintiffs are aggrieved by the shortened application \nwindow, the restriction of applications to USDA farm loans only and the exclusion of legacy \nclaims. \nII.  HISTORY \n1.  Over the past several years, USDA has resolved discrimination lawsuits with \nseveral different groups of farmers. These lawsuits, challenged discrimination in USDA's lending \nprograms. The United States Circuit Court of Appeals stated in The Estate of Earnest Lee Boyland, \net al. v. United States Department of Agriculture, Case No. 17-5082, a case involving BFAA \nmembers, “farmers’ bottom lines fluctuate with the weather and crop prices, so \"many farmers \ndepend heavily on the credit and benefit programs of the United States Department of Agriculture \nto take them from one year to the next.\" Pigford v. Glickman (Pigford I), 185 F.R.D. 82, 86 (D.D.C. \n1999) (footnote omitted). If a farmer's crops fail, \"he may not have sufficient resources to buy \nseeds to plant in the following season\"; if he needs a new grain harvester, \"he often cannot afford \nto buy the harvester without an extension of credit.\" Id. \"Because of the seasonal nature of farming, \nit also is of utmost importance that credit and benefit applications be processed quickly or the \nfarmer may lose all or most of his anticipated income for an entire year.\" Id.   \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc     Document 41     Filed 10/10/23     Page 4 of 22 \nPageID 331\n2.  The Boyland Court also stated, “public protests over discrimination in USDA's \ncredit and benefit programs spurred the Department to investigate. That scrutiny uncovered a \nwidespread pattern of discrimination in the Department's agricultural credit and benefit programs. \nIn 1996, then-Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman appointed a Civil Rights Action Team to \nassess the Department's history of racial discrimination and recommend changes. See id. at 88. \nThe Action Team documented extensive economic harm to minority farmers from discrimination \nin USDA programs. See id. at 86-88. That discrimination owed partly to USDA's practice of \ndelegating loan application decisions to small, local committees in each county. Id. at 86. The \ncounty committees were far less diverse than the communities they served. Id. at 87. USDA denied \nor delayed processing loan applications, approved insufficient amounts, discriminatorily denied \naccess to loan servicing options, or imposed restrictive conditions on loans because of the \napplicants' race, sex, or ethnicity. See Fourth Am. Compl. 3, Love v. Veneman, No. 1:00-cv-02502 \n(D.D.C. July 13, 2012), ECF No. 160 (female farmers); Eighth Am. Compl. 2, Keepseagle v. \nVeneman, No. 1:99-cv-03119 (D.D.C.

In 1998, Congress responded to the farmers' predicament by lifting the time bar for \nfarmers who had made timely efforts to seek administrative redress for credit discrimination but \nwere stymied by the dysfunction at USDA. See 7 U.S.C. § 2279 note (Omnibus Consolidated and \nEmergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999, Pub. L. No. 105-277, § 741, 112 Stat. 2681) \n(\"Appropriations Act\"). The Appropriations Act tolled the statute of limitations for two years after \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc     Document 41     Filed 10/10/23     Page 5 of 22 \nPageID 332\nits passage from October 1998 to October 2000— for people who (1) alleged non-employment-\nrelated discrimination by USDA occurring between January 1, 1981, and December 31, 1996, and \n(20 had filed a complaint with USDA before July 1, 1997.   \n4.  To date, USDA has resolved the discrimination lawsuits of four groups of farmers. \nFor each group, the only farmers permitted to participate in the claims-resolution processes \nestablished in response to these cases were those who had, before the suits were filed, complained \nin some manner of USDA's discrimination. Framework for Hispanic or Female Farmers' Claims \nProcess ⁋⁋ VIII.A VII.B, VIII.C.1 g. Love, No. 1:00-cv-02502 (D.D.C.

USDA settled with the class of Black Farmers first, in 1999, in Pigford I. 185 F.R.D. \n82. The court approved the creation of a two-track dispute resolution mechanism for distributing \nproceeds  to  claimants.  Under  that  process,  claimants  with  less  documentary  evidence  of \ndiscrimination received capped payments, while claimants with more documentary evidence could \nseek to prove and recover actual damages. Pigford I, 185 F.R.D. at 95-97.  \nIn order to be eligible for relief, a claimant must submit his completed claim \npackage to the facilitator postmarked within 180 days of the date of entry of this \nConsent Decree, except that a claimant whose claim is otherwise timely shall have \nnot less than 30 days to submit a declaration pursuant to subparagraph (b)(iii), \nabove, after being \n \n(g) A claimant who satisfies the definition of the class in ¶ 2(a), above, but who \nfails to submit a completed claim package within 180 days of entry of this Consent \nDecree may petition the Court to permit him to nonetheless participate in the claims \nresolution procedures. The Court shall grant such a petition only where the claimant \ndemonstrates that his failure to submit a timely claim was due to extraordinary \ncircumstances beyond his control. \n \nPigford v. Glickman, 185 F.R.D. 82 (D.D.C. 1999) (Emphasis added.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc     Document 41     Filed 10/10/23     Page 6 of 22 \nPageID 333\n6.  The process established in Pigford I became a template for the other cases. Next, \nUSDA settled a class action suit with Native American farmers. See Keepseagle, No. 1:99-cv-\n03119, 2012 WL 13098692, at *1 (D.D.C. Dec. 28, 2012). Similar lawsuits by Hispanic and female \nfarmers followed, but did not result in class-wide settlements because neither case was certified as \na class action. Garcia v. Johanns, 444 F.3d 625 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (Hispanic farmers); Love v. \nJohanns, 439 F.3d 723 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (female farmers). Instead, USDA voluntarily created a \njoint  claims  process  for  both  Hispanic  and  female  farmers.  See  Garcia/Love  Framework. \nClaimants who wished to recover under the Garcia /Love Framework agreed, in the claim packets \nthey  submitted,  to  release  their  individual  claims  against  USDA.  See  id.  ⁋  5;  Settlement \nAgreement, Love, No. 1:00-cv-02502 (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2017), ECF No. 2751. \n7.  Despite the various efforts outlined above discrimination problems have continued \nto plague USDA’s lending programs. \n8.  As  a  result,  Congress  enacted  a  race-based  discrimination  loan-forgiveness \nprogram in the American Rescue Plan of 2021 (ARPA). Among other things, ARPA provided debt \nrelief to “socially disadvantaged” farmers and ranchers. The phrase “socially disadvantaged” \nincluded racial classifications. To be eligible for ARPA’s debt relief, farmers and ranchers had to \nbe Black or African American, American Indian or Alaskan native, Hispanic of Latino, or Asian \nAmerican or Pacific Islander. This program was codified in §1006 of ARPA.  \n9.  The race-based criterion for relief under §1006 of the ARPA, was challenged in \nmultiple cases that alleged that these racial classifications violated the Equal Protection Clause of \nthe United States Constitution. The program was therefore suspended.  \n10.  In response to Equal Protection challenges §1006 of the ARPA was amended by \n§22007 of IRA. \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc     Document 41     Filed 10/10/23     Page 7 of 22 \nPageID 334\n11. Section 22007 states:  \nSection 1006 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (7 U.S.C. 2279 note; Public Law \n117-2) is amended to read as follows: \n(e) DISCRIMINATION FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.—In addition to amounts otherwise \navailable, there is appropriated to the Secretary of Agriculture for fiscal year 2022, to \nremain available until September 30, 2031, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise \nappropriated, $2,200,000,000 for a program to provide financial assistance, including the \ncost of any financial assistance, to farmers, ranchers, or forest landowners determined to \nhave experienced discrimination prior to January 1, 2021, in Department of Agriculture \nfarm lending programs, under which the amount of financial assistance provided to a \nrecipient may be not more than $500,000, as determined to be appropriate based on any \nconsequences experienced from the discrimination, which program shall be administered \nthrough 1 or more qualified nongovernmental entities selected by the Secretary subject to \nstandards set and enforced by the Secretary. (Emphasis added.) \n12.  On July 7, 2023 USDA published application guidelines to implement §22007. \n13.  Among these guidelines is a no exceptions January 13, 2024 application deadline. \n14.  Also among the DFAP guidelines are eligibility requirements that contradict the \nterms of Section 22007 of the IRA which amended Section 1006 of the ARPA. \n15.  In March 2021, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act (\"ARPA\"), Pub. \nL. No. 117-2, 135 Stat. 4 (2021), which provided economic aid and support to the agricultural \nsector. See §§ 1001-1007. Section 1005 of ARPA provided for payments of up to 120 percent of \ncertain USDA farm loan debts held by \"socially disadvantaged farmer[s] or rancher[s],\" a group \ndefined to include those who \"have been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice because of their \nidentity as members of a group without regard to their individual qualities.\" § 1005; 7 U.S.C. § \n2279(a)(5)-(6).  In  addition,  Section  1006  provided  for  \"financial  assistance  to  socially \ndisadvantaged farmers, ranchers, or forest landowners that are former farm loan borrowers that \nsuffered related adverse actions or past discrimination or bias in Department of Agriculture \nprograms, as determined by the Secretary.\" § 1006. Pub. L. 117-169, 136  Stat. 1818 §§ 22007-08. \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc     Document 41     Filed 10/10/23     Page 8 of 22 \nPageID 335\n16.  Among loan programs historically administered by USDA are those administered \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1471, et seq. which empowers the Secretary of Agriculture to provide \nfinancing to low and very low income applicants.  \n17.  In point of fact, 42 U.S.C. §1472, provides in pertinent part “Loans for housing and \nbuildings on adequate farms.” \n“(d) Dwelling units available to very low-income families or persons.” \nOn and after November 30, 1983  \n(1) not less than 40 percent of the funds approved in appropriation Acts for use under \nthis section shall be set aside and made available only for very low-income families or \npersons; and \n \n(2) not less than 30 percent of the funds allocated to each State under this section shall \nbe available only for very low-income families or persons. \n \n18.  The lending authority described above emanates from 42 U.S.C. §1471, which \nstates: \n42 U.S. Code §1471 – Financial assistance by Secretary of Agriculture \n \n(a) AUTHORIZATION AND PURPOSES OF ASSISTANCE \n \nThe Secretary of Agriculture (hereinafter referred to as the \"Secretary\") is authorized, \nsubject to the terms and conditions of this subchapter, to extend financial assistance, \nthrough the Farmers Home Administration, (1) to owners of farms in the United States and \nin the Territories of Alaska and Hawaii and in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the \nVirgin Islands, the territories and possessions of the United States, and the Trust Territory \nof the Pacific Islands, to enable them to construct, improve, alter, repair, or replace \ndwellings and other farm buildings on their farms, and to purchase buildings and land \nconstituting a minimum adequate site, in order to provide them, their tenants, lessees, \nsharecroppers, and laborers with decent, safe, and sanitary living conditions and adequate \nfarm buildings as specified in this subchapter, and (2) to owners of other real estate in rural \nareas for the construction, improvement, alteration, or repair of dwellings, related facilities, \nand farm buildings and to rural residents, including persons who reside in reservations or \nvillages of Indian tribes, for such purposes and for the purchase of buildings and the \npurchase of land constituting a minimum adequate site, in order to enable them to provide \ndwellings and related facilities for their own use and buildings adequate for their farming \noperations, and (3) to elderly or handicapped persons or families who are or will be the \nowners of land in rural areas for the construction, improvement, alteration, or repair of \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc     Document 41     Filed 10/10/23     Page 9 of 22 \nPageID 336\ndwellings and related facilities, the purchase of dwellings and related facilities and the \npurchase of land constituting a minimum adequate site, in order to provide them with \nadequate dwellings and related facilities for their own use, and (4) to an owner described \nin clause (1), (2), or (3) for refinancing indebtedness which… \n \n19.  The Farm Service Agency (FSA) was created in 1994 as a successor to the  Farmers \nHome Administration (\"FmHA\"). See Pub. L. No. 103-354, 108 Stat. 3209 (Oct. 13, 1994); \nPigford v. Glickman, 182 F.R.D. 341, 343 (D.D.C. 1998). There are two main divisions of FSA: \nthe Program Division and the Farm Loan Division.  The Program Division deals with non-loan \nprograms that help farmers manage market risk, recover from disasters, and conserve and protect \nnatural resources, such as commodity programs, price support programs, and other types of \ngovernment payments. The Farm Loan Division provides various kinds of loans to farmers, \nincluding farm ownership loans and operating loans. \n20.  Farm ownership loans are loans made for the purchase or improvement of real \nestate. 7 C.F.R. § 1943.16 (2002). Operating loans are loans made for the purchase of machinery \nand equipment, livestock, facilities, and annual operating expenses, such as fuel, fertilizer, seed, \nand feed; 7 C.F.R. § 1941.16. Farm ownership and farm operating loans can be \"direct loans,\" \nwhereby FSA makes a loan directly to a borrower and also services the loan. They may also be \n\"guaranteed loans,\" whereby FSA guarantees a loan made by another lender. 7 C.F.R. § 762.101. \nFSA also can make direct emergency loans that may be used for various purposes. See 7 C.F.R. \n§§ 1945.151, 1945.166. \n21.  The  Rural  Housing  Service  (\"RHS\")  of  the  United  States  Department  of \nAgriculture, through its predecessor the Farmers Home Administration (\"FmHA\"), is authorized \nto make low-interest mortgage loans to private nonprofit entities to provide rental housing for low-\nincome tenants, pursuant to § 515 of the Housing Act of 1949 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1485). The \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc     Document 41     Filed 10/10/23     Page 10 of 22 \nPageID 337\nmortgage loan agreements contain restrictions on, inter alia, eligible renters and rents that can be \ncharged. \n22.  The operation of RHS is governed by 7 CFR Part 3550, which provides in pertinent \npart: \nPART 3550-DIRECT SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING LOANS AND GRANTS \n \nAuthority: 5 U.S.C. 301; 42 U.S.C. 1480. \n \nSource: 61 FR 59779, Nov. 22, 1996, unless otherwise noted. \n \nSubpart A—General \n \n§ 3550.1 Applicability. \n \nThis part sets forth policies for the direct single family housing loan programs operated by \nthe Rural Housing Service (RHS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). It \naddresses the requirements of sections 502 and 504 of the Housing Act of 1949, as \namended, and includes policies regarding both loan and grant origination and servicing. \nProcedures for implementing these regulations can be found in program handbooks, \navailable in any Rural Development office. Any provision on the expenditure of funds \nunder this part is contingent upon the availability of funds. \n \n§ 3550.2 Purpose. \n \nThe purpose of the direct RHS single family housing loan programs is to provide low- and \nvery low-income people who will live in rural areas with an opportunity to own adequate \nbut modest, decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings and related facilities. The section 502 \nprogram offers persons who do not currently own adequate housing, and who cannot obtain \nother credit, the opportunity to acquire, build, rehabilitate, improve, or relocate dwellings \nin rural areas. The section 504 program offers loans to very low-income homeowners who \ncannot obtain other credit to repair or rehabilitate their properties. The section 504 program \nalso offers grants to homeowners age 62 or older who cannot obtain a loan to correct health \nand safety hazards or to make the unit accessible to household members with disabilities. \n \n§ 35503 Civil rights. \n \nRHS will administer its programs fairly, and in accordance with both the letter and the \nspirit of all equal opportunity and fair housing legislation and applicable executive orders. \nLoans, grants, services, and benefits provided under this part shall not be denied to any \nperson based on race, color, national origin, sex, religion, marital status, familial status, \nage, physical or mental disability, receipt of income from public assistance, or because the \napplicant has, in good faith, exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc     Document 41     Filed 10/10/23     Page 11 of 22 \nPageID 338\n(15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.). All activities under this part shall be accomplished in accordance \nwith the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3620), Executive Order 11246, and Executive \nOrder 11063, as amended by Executive Order 12259, as applicable. The civil rights \ncompliance requirements for RHS are in 7 CFR part 1901, subpart E. \n \n23.  Section 502 direct loans are among USDA farm lending programs. Within the \nmembership of BFAA are substantial number of RHS loan applicants, including Plaintiff Furlow, \nand recipients who were prior to January1, 2021 discriminated against by USDA. \n24.  Among BFAA members are a substantial number of applicants, including Plaintiffs \nFerguson and Jackson and recipients for loans administered by FSA who have claims on behalf of \ndecedents. \n25.  Farm lending programs referenced within Section 22007 and in past instances of \nCongressional action to address USDA lending discrimination, included both RHS and FSA loans \nas both categories are within the ambit of  former  FHA lending programs. \n26.  The USDA DFAP guidelines which require applications to be submitted by January \n13, 2024 and excludes legacy and RHS loans are arbitrary and capricious.  \n27.  For reasons explained below given the history, timing and process involved for \nPlaintiffs to submit an application for relief under §22007, the January 13, 2024 deadline, \nlimitation to FSA loans and exclusion of legacy claims is arbitrary, capricious, not rationally \nrelated to any legitimate governmental goal, violative of separation of powers and Due Process \nand was not authorized by Congress. For these reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this \nHonorable Court enjoin all three guidelines.   \nIII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n28.  This Court has jurisdiction over this complaint under 28 U.S.C. §1331, §2201, and \n5 U.S.C. §702-706, because this case presents substantial questions of Constitutional and federal \nlaw, specifically whether Section 22007 of IRA and Defendants’ implementation of that section is \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc     Document 41     Filed 10/10/23     Page 12 of 22 \nPageID 339\narbitrary and capricious, violative of Separation of Power and Due Process and authorized by \nCongress. \n29.  This Court has authority to issue a declaratory judgment and to order injunctive \nrelief and other relief that is necessary and proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and 2202. \n30.  Venue is appropriate in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1). A substantial part \nof the events giving rise to this claim occurred in this district, Defendants maintain one or more \noffices and employees in this district, a substantial part of the property subject to this action is \nsituated in this district, and a plaintiff resides in this district. \nIV.  PARTIES \n31.  Plaintiff, Black Farmers & Agriculturalists Association, Inc. (BMA) is a not-for-\nprofit organization created for the specific purpose of responding to the issues and concerns of \nBlack  ranchers  in  the  United  States  and  abroad.  Formed  in  1997,  the  organization  has  a \nmembership of more than one thousand live hundred (1,500) farmers nationwide, and 21 state \nchapters. BFAA was also organized to monitor the conduct of the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nand the historic 1999 class action lawsuit, Pigford v. Glickman, 185 F.R.D. 82 (D.D.C. 1999) \n(hereinafter \"Pigford”).1 \n \n1 The historical context that gives rise to this litigation and the need for BMA was summarized by the district court \nin its order approving settlement as follows: \n \nForty acres and a mule. That was the promise made by the government to those former slaves who wanted to \nfarm land in the South after the Civil War. As detailed in this Court's opinion in Pigford I, for most  African-\nAmericans the promise of forty acres and a mule was never kept, and the United States Department of \nAgriculture and the county commissioners to whom it delegated so much power bear much of the \nresponsibility for the broken promise to those African-American farmers and their descendants. Pigford v. \nGlickman, 185 F.R.D. at 85. In the early I900's, there were 925,000 African-American farmers in the United \nStates farming 16 million acres of farmland. By the time the Court approved the Pigford I consent decree, \nthere were fewer than 18,000 African-American farms in the United States and African-American farmers \nowned less than three million acres of land. Id. As the Court said 12 years ago in approving the consent \ndecree,\" [n]othing can completely undo the discrimination of the past or restore lost land or lost opportunities\" \nto the many African-American farmers who were part of the Pigford I class. Id. at 112. Historical \ndiscrimination cannot be undone, but the Pigford I consent decree was a significant first step, a step that had \nbeen a long time coming. And, as described earlier in this Opinion, supra at 9, nearly 16,000 African-\n12 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc     Document 41     Filed 10/10/23     Page 13 of 22 \nPageID 340\n32.  Thomas Burrell, is a farmer and President of BFAA. Mr. Burrell is representative \nof other BFAA members who have claims that meet Section 22007’s eligibility criteria.  BFAA \nhas among its membership individuals with qualifying claims that must be asserted on behalf of a \ndecedents’  estates.  For  instance  BFAA  has  persistently  pursued  relief  from  USDA  racial \ndiscrimination on behalf of the Estate of David Shelton, the Estate of Lee Sylvester Caldwell and \nthe Estate of Earnest Lee Bayland in United States District Court, Case No. 15-cv-1112 (TSC).  \nThese claims, and others like them referred to herein as “Legacy Claims” until now have been \ndeemed time-barred. BFAA members legacy claims may qualify for §22007 assistance. \n33.  Defendant Thomas J. Vilsack is the Secretary of Agriculture. He is responsible for \nleading the USDA, which includes the FSA. Under Section 22007 of IRA. Defendant Vilsack is \nrequired to provide debt relief to farmers who have experienced discrimination prior to 2021.  \n34.  Defendant  Zack Ducheneaux was appointed Administrator for USDA’s Farm \nService Agency on February 22, 2021. In this role Ducheneaux provides leadership and direction \non agricultural policy, administering loan programs, and managing conservation, commodity, \ndisaster, and farm marketing. Programs through a national network of offices including offices in \nthe Western District of Tennessee.  \nV.  FACTS COMMON TO ALL COUNTS \n35.  On July 7, 2023, USDA announced DFAP, USDA issued a forty page DFAP \napplication that must be submitted by January 13, 2024.  IRA Section §22007, which authorized \n \nAmerican farmers received a total of more than $1 billion through the claims process created by the settlement \nof that historic case.\" \n \nDocket No. 232, p. 69. \n  BFAA's purpose is to assist Black farmers, many of whom are sharecroppers or descendants of sharecroppers, \nin connection with their understanding of and participation in this settlement process as well as to seek prospective \nrelief on their behalf. \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc     Document 41     Filed 10/10/23     Page 14 of 22 \nPageID 341\nDFAP financial assistance, states assistance funds are available through September 30, 2031. \nSection 22007 does not authorize the brief application window promulgated by Defendants, nor \ndoes it authorize excluding Legacy or housing loan application. \nVI.  CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n36.  Plaintiffs bring this action under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \non behalf of Plaintiffs the  (“Class”) .  The Class Period commenced on July 15, 1949 ,the \nenactment date of FHA \n37.  Plaintiffs bring this action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1) on behalf \nof a class defined as: \nAll persons who experienced discrimination  in a United States Department of Agricultural \nlending program prior to January 1, 2021. \n \n38.  Plaintiffs also bring this action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) on \nbehalf of a class defined as set for the in Paragraph 37 for the reason adjudication of the issues \nraised here will be dispositive of the claims of all persons affected.  \n39.  Plaintiffs also bring this action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) on \nbehalf of a class defined as set forth in Paragraph 37  for the reason questions of law common to \nthe class predominate over the claims of individual class members.   \n40.  The claims of Plaintiff are typical of the claims of the Class.  Plaintiffs will fairly \nand adequately protect the interests of the Class.  Plaintiffs have no conflicts with any other Class \nMember, and has retained competent counsel experienced in class action litigation. \n41.  Common questions of law and fact exist.  Questions of law and fact are common to \nthe Class and predominate over any questions affecting only individual Class Members. \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc     Document 41     Filed 10/10/23     Page 15 of 22 \nPageID 342\n42.  Class action treatment is a superior method for the fair efficient adjudication of the \ncontroversy described herein.  A class action provides an efficient method whereby enforcement \nof the rights of Plaintiffs and USDA can be fairly managed.  \n \nTHE RULEMAKING \n43.  According to USDA, following signing of the IRA, USDA undertook steps to \nconvene listening sessions and seek public comment about the design of the program to ensure \nthat farmers, advocates, academics, legislators. tribal governments, and other experts were heard. \nUSDA has committed to making payments to farmers no later than early 2024.  \n44.  With this public feedback taken into account, in March 2023. USDA announced \nthe basic structure of the prop am. The IRA specifies that financial assistance must be delivered to \nimpacted producers by nongovernmental program administrators. \n45.  In early May, USDA signed contracts with three vendors who, together, constitute \na national administrator and four regional hubs. The vendors are working together to solicit \napplications from eligible farmers, provide technical assistance, and make decisions about each \ncase (following rides set by USDA). \n46.  The  vendors  include  Midtown  Group,  serving  as  the  national  administrator; \nWindsor Group, serving producers in the eastern regions of the U.S. and Analytic Acquisitions, \nserving the western regions. The national administrator will manage all aspects of the application \nprocess including making determinations on applications. while the regional hubs will conduct \noutreach and technical assistance in addition to providing recommendations on applications. \nPlaintiffs are within the jurisdiction of the Windsor Group. \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc     Document 41     Filed 10/10/23     Page 16 of 22 \nPageID 343\n47.  Applications are due January 13, 2024 –USDA has stated, unlike in past instances \nsuch as Pigford there will be no extensions. The specific deadline depends on the application \nsubmission method: \n•  U.S. or overnight mail must be postmarked by January 13, 2024 \n•  Efiling; by 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time, January 13, 2024 \n•  In person, at a regional office: by 8 p.m. local time on January 13, 2024. \n48.  The January 13, 2024 deadline does not advance any compelling governmental \ninterest. It is arbitrary and capricious. The deadline is unreasonable given the complexity of the \napplication. \n49.  The  deadline  under  Section  22007  of  IRA  does  not  advance  a  compelling \ngovernmental interest, invades the exclusive province of Congress and deprives Plaintiffs of Due \nProcess. Accordingly, it may be challenged under the Administrative Procedures Act. \nVII.  LEGAL FRAMEWORK \nADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \n50.  Agency actions are reviewed deferentially.  Courts may not set aside or hold \nunlawful an agency action unless that action is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or \notherwise not in accordance with law. Bangura v. Hansen, 434 F. 3d 487, 502 (6th Cir. 2006) \n(citing 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)). “An agency decision is arbitrary and capricious if the agency fails \nto examine relevant evidence or articulate a satisfactory explanation for the decision.” Id The Court \ncan not supply a reasoned basis for the agency’s action that the agency itself has not given.”  Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Assn v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 103 S. Ct. 2856, 77 L. Ed. \n2d 443 (1983). \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc     Document 41     Filed 10/10/23     Page 17 of 22 \nPageID 344\n51.  The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) waives the sovereign immunity of the \nUnited States and its federal agencies for challenges to final agency action that seek relief other \nthan monetary damages. In enables parties who are adversely affected or aggrieved by agency \naction to seek judicial review thereof. 5 U.S.C. §§702, 704. \n52.  The APA also specifically authorizes courts to postpose the effective date of an \nagency action when warranted. 5 U.S.C. §705 (“[T]o the extent necessary to prevent irreparable \ninjury, the reviewing court…may issue all necessary and appropriate process to postpone the \neffective date of an agency action or to preserve status or rights pending conclusion of the review \nproceedings.”) \n53.  Plaintiffs in this action have been adversely affected by USDA’s arbitrary and \ncapricious establishment of a no exceptions rigid application filing date of October 31, 2023.  \n54.  The January 13, 2024 deadline is a final agency action. Immediate judicial review \nis respectfully requested as Plaintiffs have no other adequate remedy in Court.  \n55.  The January 13, 2024 deadline is limitation to FSA loans and restrictions against \nlegacy claims the consummation of USDA’s implementation of Section 22007. \n56.  A non appealable permanent bar to DFAP relief, will flow from failure to meet the \nchallenged guidelines.  \n57.  Plaintiffs are aggrieved by the arbitrary guideline and hereby respectfully seek an \norder suspending the deadline.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT 1 (SEPARATION OF POWERS) \n58.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all prior and subsequent paragraphs.  \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc     Document 41     Filed 10/10/23     Page 18 of 22 \nPageID 345\n59.  Section 22007 centralizes vast power in the hands of USDA, without the ordinary \nprotections  of  due  process,  to  decide  the  fate  of  farmers  who  have  been  victimized  by \ndiscrimination. \n60.  No principle is more central to the design of the Constitution than the separation of \npowers. See, Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce, et al. v. Xavier Becerra, S.D. Ohio Case No. \n3:23-cv-00156. \n61.  Article I of the Constitution vests legislative Powers\" in the \"Congress of the United \nStates.\" U.S. Const. art. 1, § 1 . Article II vests the executive power -the power to implement the \nlaws in the President. Article III vests the judicial power the power to interpret the laws in the \ncourts.2 \n62.  To protect that fundamental separation of powers, the Supreme Court has long \ndistinguished between certain  \"important  subjects,  which must be entirely  regulated by the \nlegislature itself\" and \"those of less interest,\" as to which Congress may afford the executive branch \ndiscretion \"to fill up the details.\" Wayman v Southard, 23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 1, 42-43 (1825). Id. \n63.  The Supreme Court has accordingly invalidated statutes that confer \"virtually \nunfettered\" discretion on the executive branch to control broad swaths of the private economy. \nA.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495,542 (1935) (invalidating delegation \nto create code of industrial conduct that fosters \"fair competition\"); see also Panama Relining Co. \nRyan, 293 U.S. 388 (1935) (invalidating delegation to ban petroleum shipments in excess of state \nproduction quotas). \n64.  In Schechter Poultry, the Court emphasized the lack of \"judicial review to give \nassurance that the action of the commission is taken within its statutory authority\" and the absence \n \n2 Any power exercised by USDA must come from the President or be specifically authorized by Congress. \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc     Document 41     Filed 10/10/23     Page 19 of 22 \nPageID 346\nof \"appropriate administrative procedure\" to ensure due process. 295 U.S. at 533, 541 . In Panama \nRefining, the Court highlighted the failure to constrain the executive branch with any \"standard or \nrule\" of decision. 293 U.S. at 418. Id.  \n65.  Under the Supreme Court's modern precedents, a statutory delegation is invalid if \nit fails to constrain the agency with an \"'intelligible principle.'\" Gundy v. United States, 139 S. Ct. \n21 16, 2129 (2019) (plurality op.) (quoting J.W. Hampton, Jr, & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. \n394, 409 (1928)). This \"intelligible principle\" must at least be \"sufficiently definite and precise to \nenable Congress, the courts and the public to ascertain whether the [agency] . . . has conformed\" \nto Congress's direction. Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 426 (1944). \n66.  Courts have also consistently recognized that \"judicial review is a factor weighing \nin favor of upholding a statute against a nondelegation challenge.\" United Stales v. Garfinkel, 29 \nF.3d 451, 458-59 (8th Cir. 1994) (quoting United States v. Bozarov, 974 F.2d 1037, 1042 (9th Cir. \n1992)) (collecting cases). Similarly, \"compliance with . . . requirements for notice and comment\" \nenhances public accountability and thereby functions as a check on agency discretion. Id.; cf: \nPanama Ref Co., 293 U.S. at 415 (noting the importance of written findings). \n67.  A lack of due process protections exacerbates the separation-of-powers concerns \nraised by a broad administrative delegation.  \n68.  There is no justification for USDA being permitted to arrogate unto itself the \npowers to set a January 13, 2024 deadline or limit relief to living FSA applicants. Congress has \ngiven USDA until September 30, 2031 to expend the funds appropriated for financial assistance.  \n69.  The guidelines violates separation of powers because it gives USDA total authority \nto set arbitrary USDA’s actions. \n70.  Plaintiffs have been aggrieved by this and requests its suspension.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc     Document 41     Filed 10/10/23     Page 20 of 22 \nPageID 347\nCOUNT 2 (DUE PROCESS) \n71.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all prior and subsequent paragraphs.  \n72.  The United States Supreme Court has stated: \nThe extent to which procedural due process must be afforded the recipient is \ninfluenced by the extent to which he may be \"condemned to suffer grievous loss,\" \nJoint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U. S. 123, 341 U. S. 168 \n(1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring), and depends upon whether the recipient's \ninterest in avoiding that loss outweighs the governmental interest in summary \nadjudication. Accordingly, as we said in Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union v. \nMcElroy, 367 U. S. 886, 367 U. S. 895 (1961), \"consideration of what procedures \ndue process may require under any given set of circumstances must begin with a \ndetermination of the precise nature of the government function involved, as well \nas… \n \nSee, Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970). \n \n73.  The  Fifth  Amendment’s  Due  Process  Clause  prohibits  the  government  from \ndepriving a person of property without adhering to constitutionally sufficient procedures. See, Ky. \nDept. of Corr. V. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 460 (1989), notice and an opportunity to be heard. \n74.  The Due Process Clause requires notice and an opportunity to be heard “at a \nmeaningful time and in a meaningful manner.” Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965); \nsee also, Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 333 (1976). Due process requires procedural \nprotections to prevent, to the extent possible, an erroneous deprivation of property. See, Gilbert v. \nHomar, 520 U.S. 924, 930-32 (1997). \n75.  Section 22007, as implemented by USDA, gives affected farmers no opportunity to \nchallenge the deadline or restriction to living FSA applicants.  \n76.  BFAA  member legacy claims requires BFAA members to complete within the \napplication window a complex forty page application. In cases where the aggrieved farmer has \ndied, USDA has stated heirs of these applicants must have written authority to pursue the \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc     Document 41     Filed 10/10/23     Page 21 of 22 \nPageID 348\ndecedent’s claims. BFAA members also desire relief for non FSA loans. There is no authority in \n§22007 for such draconian administrative guidelines. \n77.  The DFAP guidelines are unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment and must be \nenjoined.  \nRELIEF REQUESTED \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \nA.  Declare that the January 13, 2024 application deadline violative of separation of \npowers; \nB.  Declare that the January 13, 2024 application deadline violative of Due Process \nClause of the Fifth Amendment; \nC.  Immediately  suspend  the  January  13,  2024  deadline  pending  resolution  of \nPlaintiffs’ declaratory judgment action; \nD.

(pg. 14), delivered a separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. \n \n\nCase: 24-5119     Document: 44-2     Filed: 10/08/2025     Page: 2 (2 of 14)\nNo. 24-5119  Black Farmers & Agriculturalists Ass’n et al. v. Rollins et al.  Page 2 \n \n_________________ \nOPINION \n_________________ \nREADLER, Circuit Judge.  The Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association and \nseveral individual members (together “the Farmers”) sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture, \nchallenging the agency’s policy of disallowing applications to one of its programs filed on behalf \nof deceased relatives, which the Farmers wished to do here.  The district court dismissed their \nlawsuit, holding that the relevant statute required the USDA to accept applications from living \nfarmers only.  We agree, and thus affirm the district court.        \nI. \nRecognizing the long history—legislative, legal, and otherwise—that precedes today’s \ncase, the following is a truncated version of those developments.  Relevant then and now is the \nfact that the USDA’s programmatic offerings include initiatives that make loans available to \nfarmers.  At times, the agency has been accused of racial bias in its lending programs, including \nby black farmers.  In the 1990s, a group of black farmers sued the USDA over these allegations.  \nThe  agency  settled,  paying  about  15,000  black  farmers  more  than  $1  billion.    Pigford  v. \nGlickman (Pigford I), 185 F.R.D. 82, 113 (D.D.C. 1999); Cong. Rsch. Serv., RS20430, The \nPigford Cases: USDA Settlements of Discrimination Suits by Black Farmers 3, 6 (2013).   \nConcerns later arose that not all eligible farmers had been paid.  So Congress created a \ncause of action allowing late-filing eligible farmers to revive their “Pigford” claims.  Cong. \nRsch. Serv., supra, at 7.  These “Pigford II” claims were then consolidated and settled, with the \nUSDA  paying  about  34,000  black  farmers  almost  $1.25  billion,  an  amount  Congress \nappropriated to fund the new settlement.  Id. at 7–8 (citing In re Black Farmers Discrimination \nLitig. (Pigford II), 820 F. Supp. 2d 78 (D.D.C. 2011)).  \nIn  2021,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  prompted  Congress  to  target  farm-lending \ndiscrimination through affirmative legislation rather than in response to private lawsuits.  In the \nAmerican  Rescue  Plan  Act  of  2021,  Congress  appropriated  money  to  help  “socially \ndisadvantaged farmers”—a term the statute defined by using the farmer’s race.  Pub. L. No. 117-\n \n\nCase: 24-5119     Document: 44-2     Filed: 10/08/2025     Page: 3 (3 of 14)\nNo. 24-5119  Black Farmers & Agriculturalists Ass’n et al. v. Rollins et al.  Page 3 \n \n2, tit. 1., subtitle A., § 1006(b)(5), (c)(3), 135 Stat. 4, 14 (2021); see 7 U.S.C. 2279(a)(5).  Due to \nthis racial classification, a parallel provision of the Act quickly fell to constitutional equal \nprotection challenges, foreboding a similar fate for § 1006.  See Holman v. Vilsack, 117 F.4th \n906, 910 (6th Cir. 2024) (collecting cases). \n  That brings us to the statute at issue here.  Section 22007 of the Inflation Reduction Act \nof 2022 repealed and replaced § 1006 by using past discrimination, rather than race, as the key \nmetric for award-eligibility purposes.  Pub. L. No. 117-169, tit. II, subtitle C, § 22007, 136 Stat. \n1818, 2021–23 (2022).  Specifically, § 22007(e) appropriated $2.2 billion “to provide financial \nassistance . . . to farmers . . . determined to have experienced discrimination . . . in [USDA] farm \nlending programs.”  Id. § 22007(e), 136 Stat. at 2023.   \nTo disburse these funds, the USDA created the Discrimination Financial Assistance \nProgram.  The Program, in turn, established various eligibility criteria, one of which lies at the \nheart of this case:  Applications “[r]eport[ing] only discrimination against an individual who was \ndeceased at the time of the application” were deemed “facially ineligible.”  USDA,  DFAP \nValidation  Review  Guide  (Version  1.12),  at  8  (2024)  [hereinafter  DFAP  Guide], \nhttps://perma.cc/K3L6-8MCS; accord First Am. Compl., R. 41 PageID 338.  \nThis requirement excludes the “legacy claims” that the Farmers wish to file on behalf of \ntheir deceased ancestors who suffered USDA farm-lending discrimination.  That prompted the \nFarmers to sue the USDA, seeking an injunction that would force the Program to accept legacy \nclaims.  The district court, however, denied the motion for a preliminary injunction and granted \nthe government’s motion  to  dismiss under Federal  Rule of Civil  Procedure 12(b)(6).  The \nFarmers appealed this decision.   \nSix months later, they also moved for an emergency injunction pending appeal, seeking \nto stop the USDA’s processing of applications.  See Fed. R. App. P. 8.  A panel of our Court \ndenied the motion without prejudice because the Farmers failed to show that the district court \nhad denied their motion, as required by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8.  See Fed. R. App. \nP. 8(a)(1)(C), (2)(A)(i)–(ii).  The district court subsequently did so, and the Farmers renewed \ntheir motion.   \n \n\nCase: 24-5119     Document: 44-2     Filed: 10/08/2025     Page: 4 (4 of 14)\nNo. 24-5119  Black Farmers & Agriculturalists Ass’n et al. v. Rollins et al.  Page 4 \n \nII. \nWe review the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal de novo, accepting the complaint’s well-pleaded \nfactual allegations as true and testing whether they support a plausible claim for relief.  See \nDarby v. Childvine, Inc., 964 F.3d 440, 444 (6th Cir. 2020) (citing Johnson v. Morales, 946 F.3d \n911, 917 (6th Cir. 2020); Binno v. Am. Bar Ass’n, 826 F.3d 338, 345–46 (6th Cir. 2016)).  \nBecause we affirm the district court’s final judgment on the merits, we need not address the \nFarmers’ parallel request for preliminary injunctive relief.  See Adams v. Baker, 951 F.3d 428, \n429 (6th Cir. 2020) (per curiam).   \nBefore turning to those merits, we note that the only claim before us is the Farmers’ \nchallenge to the legacy-claim exclusion under both the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 551–559, 701–706, and the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, U.S. CONST. amend. V. \nThe Farmers forfeited the other issues they raised in district court—including their challenges to \nthe application’s complexity and filing deadline, as well as to the USDA’s refusal to accept \napplications based on housing loans—by not briefing them on appeal.  See Joseph Forrester \nTrucking v. Dir., Off. of Workers’ Comp. Programs, 987 F.3d 581, 593 (6th Cir. 2021) (citing \nCourser v. Allard, 969 F.3d 604, 621 (6th Cir. 2020)).   \nA.  The Farmers primarily challenge the USDA’s exclusion of legacy claims under the \nAPA, characterizing that decision as “arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A).  But this attack puts the cart before the horse.  That APA standard of review applies \nto an agency’s policymaking choices, for example in rulemaking.  E.g., Motor Vehicles Mfrs. \nAss’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 41 (1983).  When Congress \ndelegates policymaking authority, we use arbitrary-and-capricious review to determine whether \nthe agency engaged in “reasoned decisionmaking within th[e] boundaries” of the delegation.  \nLoper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244, 2263 (2024) (citation modified).  But we \ncannot reach that issue without first undertaking a threshold task:  We must “fix[] the boundaries \nof the delegated authority” by “independently interpret[ing] the statute.”  Id. (citation modified).  \nIn other words, before asking whether the USDA acted arbitrarily in deciding not to accept \nclaims based on discrimination faced by deceased farmers, we must first determine whether \nCongress gave it discretion to accept those claims.   \n \n\nCase: 24-5119     Document: 44-2     Filed: 10/08/2025     Page: 5 (5 of 14)\nNo. 24-5119  Black Farmers & Agriculturalists Ass’n et al. v. Rollins et al.  Page 5 \n \n1.  It did not, as § 22007(e)’s plain language shows.  There, Congress instructed the \nUSDA “to provide financial assistance . . . to farmers . . . determined to have experienced \ndiscrimination.”  § 22007(e).  Unpacking that language, the deceased “farmers,” at least as \nsuggested by the complaint here, “experienced discrimination.”  Id.; see First Am. Compl., R. 41, \nPageID 340.  That  leaves the question whether an  award under § 22007(e) would provide \n“assistance” to these farmers.   \nFinding no statutory definition for that term, we turn to the word’s ordinary meaning.  \nTaniguchi v. Kan Pac. Saipan, Ltd., 566 U.S. 560, 566 (2012).  “Assistance” means “[t]he action \nof helping or aiding in an undertaking or necessity.”  Assistance, 1 Oxford English Dictionary \n715 (2d ed. 1989); accord Assistance, Black’s Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024).  “Help,” in turn, \nmeans “[t]o furnish . . . with what is serviceable to [one’s] efforts or . . . needs.”  Help, 7 Oxford \nEnglish Dictionary 126 (2d ed. 1989); see also Help, Merriam-Webster (last visited Aug. 28, \n2025) (“[T]o provide (someone) with something that is useful or necessary in achieving an \nend.”).  And to “aid” similarly means “to give . . . support.”  Aid, 1 Oxford English Dictionary \n273 (2d ed. 1989); see also Aid, Oxford English Dictionary Online (last visited Aug. 28, 2025) \n(adding “to relieve from difficulty or distress”).   \n  Taking all of this together, “assistance” seemingly has two meanings, one task-based and \none need-based.  When it comes to tasks, “assistance” is something useful or necessary to \nachieving an end or completing an undertaking or effort.  In terms of need, “assistance” provides \nsupport or relief to someone in a present state of difficulty, distress, or necessity.  Crucial here is \nthat each definition points to the present and future.  Viewed in that light, “assistance” addresses \nhelp with either a yet-to-be-completed task or a yet-to-be-satisfied need.   \nWith this understanding in mind, we agree with the USDA that the Program may not \naccept  claims  made  on  behalf  of  deceased  farmers.    The  Program’s  “financial  assistance,” \nremember, must go “to [the] farmers” who “experienced discrimination.”  § 22007(e).  For the \nFarmers’ claims to qualify, the money would have to “assist[]” a deceased farmer who suffered \ndiscrimination.  Id.  That is impossible.  It goes without saying that a deceased farmer is not \nengaged in an activity that money can help complete, nor does the farmer suffer any need that \nmoney can help relieve.  Money, in short, cannot “assist[]” a deceased farmer.  § 22007(e).  \n \n\nCase: 24-5119     Document: 44-2     Filed: 10/08/2025     Page: 6 (6 of 14)\nNo. 24-5119  Black Farmers & Agriculturalists Ass’n et al. v. Rollins et al.  Page 6 \n \nBecause deceased farmers do not satisfy this statutory requirement, the USDA was required to \nreject applications filed on behalf of that group.  \nFairly read, the Farmers’ claims are better understood to seek “compensation” for past \nharm to deceased farmers, not “assistance.”  To “compensate” means “[t]o counterbalance, make \nup for, [or] make amends for,” Compensate, 4 Oxford English Dictionary 601 (2d ed. 1989), \noften by “mak[ing] an appropriate and usually counterbalancing payment” which, for example, \n“compensate[s] . . . victims for their loss,” Compensate, Merriam-Webster (emphasis omitted) \n(last visited Aug. 28, 2025).  That describes what the Farmers seek here, as any payment to a \nnow-deceased farmer’s estate based on discrimination suffered during the farmer’s life would be \nsolely for making amends for wrongs previously suffered, not for “assist[ing]” the farmer in the \nhere and now.   \nOn this point, we note that other courts to consider similar provisions have held that a \ngrant of “financial assistance” contemplates the “provision of a subsidy to an entity, as opposed \nto providing compensation.”  McMullen v. Wakulla Cnty. Bd. of Cnty. Comm’rs, 650 F. App’x \n703, 707 (11th Cir. 2016) (per curiam) (citation modified); see also Harpole v. Ark. Dep’t of \nHum. Servs., 820 F.2d 923, 928 (8th Cir. 1987) (noting that a statute written to “provide financial \nassistance” is not intended “as a means of seeking compensation” for past “injur[ies]”).  We find \nthis  distinction  persuasive.    After  all,  Congress  is  seemingly  well  aware  of  the  difference \nbetween “compensation” and “assistance,” typically using the former term when it wishes to \nprovide backward-looking payments to  make  up for past  wrongs or  pay existing  debts,  as \nlegislative enactments from the recent and more distant past reflect.  See, e.g., One Big Beautiful \nBill Act, Pub. L. No. 119-21, tit. X, pt. II, subtitle C, § 100201, 139 Stat. 72, 394 (2025) \n(describing program of “compensation” for “radiation exposure” (citation modified)); Puerto \nRico  Oversight,  Management,  and  Economic  Stability  Act,  Pub.  L.  No.  114-187,  tit.  III, \n§ 316(a)(1), 130 Stat. 549, 584 (2016) (providing “compensation for actual, necessary services \nrendered”); Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act, Pub. L. No. 69-803, ch. \n509, § 8, 44 Stat. 1424, 1427 (1927) (providing “[c]ompensation for disability” caused by work \nas  a  longshoreman).    Take  as  an  example  Congress’s  response  to  the  Japanese  American \ninternment  saga.    There,  our  nation’s  legislature  designed  a  program  to  issue  “appropriate \n \n\nCase: 24-5119     Document: 44-2     Filed: 10/08/2025     Page: 7 (7 of 14)\nNo. 24-5119  Black Farmers & Agriculturalists Ass’n et al. v. Rollins et al.  Page 7 \n \ncompensation” for the “enormous damages” caused by past discrimination, 1988 Civil Liberties \nAct, Pub. L. No. 100-383, § 2(a)–(b), 102 Stat. 903, 904, and explicitly designated that such \n“payments” can be made on behalf of “deceased persons,” id. § 105(a)(7), 102 Stat. at 907.  \n“[W]here Congress knows how to say something but chooses not to, its silence is controlling.”  \nIn re Griffith, 206 F.3d 1389, 1394 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (citation modified); see also \nThompson v. United States, 145 S. Ct. 821, 827 (2025) (similar).  In sum, as the district court \naptly stated, “[t]he use of the word assistance, rather than compensation, supports the idea that \nthe  funding  was  intended  to  provide  prospective  relief  for  living  farmers,  rather  than  to \ncompensate the families of deceased ones.”  Order Den. Pls.’ Second Mot. Prelim. Inj. and \nGranting Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss, R.74, PageID 741.   \nThe structure of § 22007 confirms as much.  The other subsections of § 22007, it bears \nnoting, also appropriate money for forward-looking purposes.  See § 22007(a) (“[T]o provide \noutreach,  mediation,  financial  training, . . . and  other  technical  assistance . . . .”);  § 22007(b) \n(“[T]o  improve  land  access  . . . .”);  § 22007(c)  (“[T]o  fund  . . . equity  commissions  . . . .”); \n§ 22007(d) (“[T]o support and supplement agricultural research, education, and extension . . . .”).  \nWhat is more, § 22007 had its genesis in a COVID-19-relief statute, which likewise addressed a \nwide range of pandemic-related issues on a uniformly forward-looking basis.  See generally Pub. \nL. No. 117-2, 135 Stat. 4. \nFinally, comparison to the two Pigford class action settlements, which accepted claims \nfrom deceased farmers and which the Farmers cite as the measure of appropriate USDA action, \nonly highlights the daylight between Congress’s choice to grant “assistance” and the Farmers’ \ndesire to transform this appropriation into “compensation.”  In those class action settlements, the \nfundamental underlying claim was that “the government had wronged generations of African \nAmerican farmers and must provide compensation.”  Pigford I, 185 F.R.D. at 101 (emphasis \nadded).  In other words, those farmers sought a backward-looking payment to make up for harm \nthey suffered.  Federal law, in turn, allowed the class action to include claims for compensatory \ndamages  brought  by  survivors  of  deceased  farmers  who  suffered  discrimination.  \nSee Weatherford U.S., L.P. v. U.S. Dep’t of Lab., Admin. Bd., 68 F.4th 1030, 1036–37 (6th Cir. \n2023) (describing federal common law rule that “claims to compensate the plaintiff . . . survive a \n \n\nCase: 24-5119     Document: 44-2     Filed: 10/08/2025     Page: 8 (8 of 14)\nNo. 24-5119  Black Farmers & Agriculturalists Ass’n et al. v. Rollins et al.  Page 8 \n \nparty’s death” (citation modified)).  So it makes perfect sense that the USDA accepted claims \nfrom the survivors of the deceased Pigford farmers.  But § 22007(e), by comparison, provides \n“assistance,” not “compensation,” and thus creates no cause of action that could survive the \nclaimant’s death.   \nAccordingly, the USDA, in this instance, could not have accepted claims made on behalf \nof deceased farmers.  This resolves the Farmers’ APA challenge, obviating any need to address \ntheir numerous arguments under the arbitrary-and-capricious standard.  \n2.  The Farmers seek to avoid the statute’s text in many ways.  Many of these arguments, \nit bears noting, emerged for the first time at oral argument.  By failing to argue these points in \ntheir appellate briefing, the Farmers forfeited them.  See Joseph Forrester Trucking, 987 F.3d at \n593.  But even if we excuse the forfeiture, none of these points changes our straightforward \nanalysis.   \na.  First, the Farmers claim that “assistance” does not have its ordinary meaning.  Instead, \nthey argue that the previous enactment of § 1006 in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 \npurportedly defined “assistance” so broadly as to encompass grants to deceased farmers, a \ndefinition, the Farmers say, we should bring forward to inform our interpretation of § 22007(e).  \nFirst, it is unclear why a definition that did not survive from the previous enactment into the \nnow-binding law should be given any weight.  Normally we would read such an omission as \ndemonstrating Congress’s intent to disavow the prior definition, not embrace it.   See, e.g., \nPhillips v. Ct. of Common Pleas, 668 F.3d 804, 810 (6th Cir. 2012) (noting that “courts operate \non the assumption that Congress acts intentionally” when it “omits” “particular language” while \n“amend[ing]”  a  statute  (citation  modified)).    But  even  putting  that  objection  aside,  § 1006 \ncontained no definition of “assistance.”  The Farmers’ argument appears to be premised on that \nstatute’s subsection heading:  “ASSISTANCE.”  § 1006(b), 135 Stat. at 13.  The heading, however, \ndoes not introduce a statutory definition of the term “assistance”; instead, it merely introduces \nthe list of assistance programs created under the statute.  Id.  Further inspection reveals that the \nheading  serves  simply  to  distinguish  this  list  from  subsections  (a),  which  describes  the \n“APPROPRIATION”  that  funds  these  programs,  and  (c),  where  Congress  in  fact  did  provide \n“DEFINITIONS”—and in doing so, it bears noting, conspicuously omitted one for “assistance.”  \n \n\nCase: 24-5119     Document: 44-2     Filed: 10/08/2025     Page: 9 (9 of 14)\nNo. 24-5119  Black Farmers & Agriculturalists Ass’n et al. v. Rollins et al.  Page 9 \n \n§ 1006(a), (c), 135 Stat. at 13–14.  In short, § 1006 does not define “assistance” any more than \n§ 22007 does, leaving us to use the term’s ordinary meaning.  See Taniguchi, 566 U.S. at 566. \nb.  At oral argument, the Farmers provided their first explanation of how money can \n“assist” a deceased farmer.  The money, the Farmers explained, “puts” the dead farmer’s “heirs \nin position to benefit from the [farmer’s] efforts,” and thus “assist[s] the estates,” which “would \nhave been in a position to bequeath finances to their heirs” if they received the money.  Oral \nArgument at 08:42–09:09.  Even if this argument had been briefed, it would not go far.  The \nFarmers  seemingly  envision  the  money  “assisting”  the  estates  bequeathed  to  the  deceased \nfarmer’s heirs.  Yet an estate is merely “[t]he property that one leaves after death.”  Estate, \nBlack’s Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024).  That collection of property is not itself a “farmer[]” \nwho “experienced discrimination.”  § 22007(e).  So even if a grant would assist an estate in some \nsense, that effect still falls outside the statute’s instruction to assist “farmers” themselves.  Id.   \nc.    The  Farmers  also  emphasize  potential  practical  issues  that  might  arise  from \ninterpreting “assistance” to exclude claims on behalf of deceased farmers.  While those points \nmay carry weight in the legislative setting, they are largely misplaced here.  After all, on issues \nof statutory interpretation, “[e]ven the most formidable policy arguments cannot overcome a \nclear statutory directive,” such as the one in § 22007(e).  Badgerow v. Walters, 142 S. Ct. 1310, \n1321 (2022) (citation modified).   \nEven were we positioned to evaluate possible policy impacts tied to congressional action, \nthe concerns raised might not pose much of a problem.  Consider the purported unfairness in not \naccepting claims from a farmer whose operations are still affected by past discrimination against \nhis deceased parents or grandparents.  That the farmer cannot submit a claim on behalf of his \ndeceased ancestors, however, does not mean he cannot file a claim for himself.  For example, as \nthe government conceded at oral argument, a farmer who is the “current holder” of a debt that \nresulted from alleged past discrimination may apply to the Program on that basis.  DFAP Guide, \nsupra, at 66; see Oral Argument at 15:50.  This tracks our understanding of the statute:  The \nfarmer,  now  subject  to  the  terms  of  a  discriminatory  loan,  has  himself  “experienced \ndiscrimination” and is thus eligible for “assistance.”  § 22007(e).  Or if, on the other hand, a loan \nwas denied to the farmer’s ancestors because of discrimination, the farmer seemingly could \n \n\nCase: 24-5119     Document: 44-2     Filed: 10/08/2025     Page: 10 (10 of 14)\nNo. 24-5119  Black Farmers & Agriculturalists Ass’n et al. v. Rollins et al.  Page 10 \n \napply on his own behalf and explain in his application how discriminatory acts toward his \npredecessors also constituted discrimination against him personally.  See DFAP Guide, supra, at \n66 (rejecting application when it “only asserts discrimination against an individual who is now \ndeceased” (emphasis added)); Oral Argument at 16:16 (government conceding that “if they were \nable to file an application and explain how they themselves experienced discrimination, then they \ncould do that”).  In any event, even if some farmers fall in neither bucket and thus have no \nstatutory claim available, that result is tied to Congress’s design, a choice we may not second \nguess.   \nNor does the Program’s allegedly inconsistent decision to accept claims from “potential \nproducers”—those  who  never  farmed  but  merely  intended  to  do  so  before  farm-lending \ndiscrimination prevented it—convince us to read the statute any differently.  That oddity, if true, \narises from the USDA’s interpretation of “farmers,” which is not at issue in this case, rather than \nfrom our straightforward reading of “assistance.”  See DFAP Guide, supra, at 10 (justifying this \nchoice  based  on  the  “the  statutory  reference  to  ‘farmers’”  because  “would-be  farmers” \n“demonstrate sufficient connection . . . to farming . . . to qualify for a loan”).  In another case, we \ncould debate whether this reading of “farmers” is correct.  But here, it sheds no light on the \nmeaning of “assistance.”   \nFinally, the Farmers make hay over the fact that the Program accepted applications from \nliving farmers who subsequently passed away while rejecting applications from farmers who \nwere deceased when their application was submitted.  That assertion, however, is not supported \nby any allegations in the complaint or elsewhere in the record.  Nor, in any event, does the \nargument make much sense.  Barring an ability to read the future, on what basis should the \nUSDA have rejected applications from farmers who were going to die after they applied?  In the \nend, neither this nor any of these other alleged practical inconsistencies can overcome the \nstatute’s plain command.  See Badgerow, 142 S. Ct. at 1321.   \nd.  Falling short on the policy front, the Farmers turn to statutory purpose.  To their \nminds,  our  reading  contravenes  Congress’s  intent  “to  compensate  for  decades  of  racial \ndiscrimination in USDA farm lending programs.”  Appellant Br. 26.  What controls here, of \ncourse, is the text.  And on that score, the lone purported purpose Congress revealed in enacting \n \n\nCase: 24-5119     Document: 44-2     Filed: 10/08/2025     Page: 11 (11 of 14)\nNo. 24-5119  Black Farmers & Agriculturalists Ass’n et al. v. Rollins et al.  Page 11 \n \n§ 22007(e) was to provide “assistance,” not “compensation.”  See Arangure v. Whitaker, 911 \nF.3d 333, 345 (6th Cir. 2018) (“Congress addresses [its] purposes by negotiating, crafting, and \nenacting statutory text.”).  The Farmers’ speculation to the contrary cannot overcome the text’s \ncommand.   \nWere  we  inclined  to  entertain  the  Farmers’  purpose  argument,  it  nonetheless  runs \ncontrary to the structure and background here.  Recall that the rest of § 22007 concerns forward-\nlooking, pandemic-inspired assistance programs.  And the backward-looking component of the \nfarm-lending-discrimination problem has already been addressed by the two Pigford settlements, \nwhere Congress allocated more than $2 billion to settling the compensatory claims the Farmers \nnow seek to re-litigate.  See Cong. Rsch. Serv., supra, at 6–7.  Indeed, many applications \naccepted under the Program were based on “the same discrimination during the same timeframe \nas successfully claimed in” the Pigford settlements.  DFAP Guide, supra, at 17 (bold omitted).  \nAnd more than $12 million was left unclaimed after Pigford II, suggesting that all claimants who \ncould be compensated have been.  See Cy Pres Funds, In Re Black Farmers Discrimination \nLitigation  Settlement,  https://www.blackfarmercase.com/CyPres.aspx  (last  visited  Aug.  28, \n2025); see also In re Black Farmers Discrimination Litig., No. 08-0511, 2018 WL 6434766, at \n*1, *4 (D.D.C. Dec. 7, 2018) (describing dispute over cy pres distributions).  \nIn sum, if one were looking for an overarching statutory purpose, as the Farmers ask us to \ndo, the only one apparent from § 22007(e), its statutory context, or its history is to provide \nforward-looking help for pandemic-affected farmers—not, as the Farmers suggest, to provide \nbackwards-looking compensation to farmers already compensated by the Pigford settlements.   \ne.  The Farmers next invoke their statutory right to “inherit . . . property” on the “same” \nbasis as other “citizens of the United States.”  See 42 U.S.C. § 1982 (“All citizens of the United \nStates shall have the same right . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens . . . to inherit . . . real and \npersonal property.”)  According to the Farmers, interpreting § 22007(e) in the manner we have \nviolates § 1982 by denying the heirs of black farmers the right “to inherit” property on the same \nterms as the heirs of white farmers.  42 U.S.C. § 1982.  Three problems with this assertion \nimmediately come to mind.  One, the argument seemingly assumes, without support, that every \nperson who “inherit[s]” land from a discriminated-against black farmer will also be black.  Id.  \n \n\nCase: 24-5119     Document: 44-2     Filed: 10/08/2025     Page: 12 (12 of 14)\nNo. 24-5119  Black Farmers & Agriculturalists Ass’n et al. v. Rollins et al.  Page 12 \n \nTwo, § 1982, like § 22007(e), is merely a statute.  A previous statutory enactment, no matter how \nrevered, cannot supplant the will of a subsequent Congress, see Fletcher v. Peck, 10 U.S. (6 \nCranch) 87, 135 (1810), especially a statute that speaks more specifically to the situation at hand, \nsee RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.S. 639, 645 (2012) (“It is a \ncommonplace  of  statutory  construction  that  the  specific  governs  the  general.”  (citation \nmodified)).  So in the event of a conflict, § 22007(e) prevails.   \nThree, and more to the point, our reading of § 22007(e) creates no conflict with § 1982.  \nThe latter statute is triggered only if government or private action at least “impair[s] a property \ninterest.”  Gerber v. Herskovitz, 14 F.4th 500, 510 (6th Cir. 2021).  To the Farmers’ minds, the \ndeceased-farmer exclusion does so by failing to redress prior USDA discrimination that reduced \nthe value of their ancestors’ land.  But any “impair[ment]” complained of here derives from prior \nUSDA actions, not from § 22007(e) or the USDA’s implementation of it.  In short, § 22007(e) \nimpairs no one’s right to inherit property.     \nf.  Finally, in their motion for an injunction pending appeal, the Farmers cite Loper \nBright, urging us to  apply  our independent  judgment  rather than deferring  to  the USDA’s \nunderstanding of § 22007(e).  See 144 S. Ct. at 2273.  But we have done just that, as Loper \nBright commands.   \nB.  Turning from the APA to the Constitution, the Farmers also claim that excluding their \nclaims violated the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.  To show a violation of procedural \ndue process, the Farmers must (1) identify a life, liberty, or property interest; (2) show that they \nhave been deprived of that interest; and (3) explain why the process used in the deprivation was \ninadequate.  Fields v. Henry County, 701 F.3d 180, 185 (6th Cir. 2012) (citing Women’s Med. \nPro. Corp. v. Baird, 438 F.3d 595, 611 (6th Cir. 2006)).  Beyond a few naked assertions of \nillegality,  however,  they  do  not  even  attempt  to  do  so,  once  again  forfeiting  the  point.  \nBuetenmiller v. Macomb Cnty. Jail, 53 F.4th 939, 946 (6th Cir. 2022) (“In instances where issues \nare  adverted  to  in  a  perfunctory  manner,  unaccompanied  by  some  effort  at  developed \nargumentation, we consider them forfeited.” (citation modified)).  And peeking at the unbriefed \nmerits, it bears noting that the Farmers have no due-process-protected property interest in the \n“benefit” program created here, given that the governing statute, as explained above, affords \n \n\nCase: 24-5119     Document: 44-2     Filed: 10/08/2025     Page: 13 (13 of 14)\nNo. 24-5119  Black Farmers & Agriculturalists Ass’n et al. v. Rollins et al.  Page 13 \n \nthem no “claim of entitlement to th[at] benefit.”  Perry v. Sinderman, 408 U.S. 593, 601 (1972).  \nFor both reasons, this claim likewise fails.  \n*  *  *  *  * \nWe affirm the district court’s judgment and deny the motion for an injunction pending \nappeal as moot. \n   \n \n\nCase: 24-5119     Document: 44-2     Filed: 10/08/2025     Page: 14 (14 of 14)\nNo. 24-5119  Black Farmers & Agriculturalists Ass’n et al. v. Rollins et al.  Page 14 \n \n____________________________ \nCONCURRENCE / DISSENT \n____________________________ \nHELENE N. WHITE, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.   \nI agree with portions of the majority’s analysis but write separately to emphasize that \nthere clearly is a compensatory element to Congress’s choice of the term “assistance.”   \nFirst, recovery under this provision is measured by the “consequences” flowing from past \ndiscrimination,  a  distinctly  compensatory  framing.    This  is  in  contrast  to  the  majority’s \nunderstanding that “assistance” connotes “something useful or necessary to achieving an end or \ncompleting  an  undertaking  or  effort”—i.e.,  a  payment  amount  tied  to  the  costs  of  that \nundertaking, not to the consequences of a past injury. \nSecond, to the extent that we can consider the DFAP Guide—a document not in the \nrecord or, seemingly, even known to the parties—it, too, suggests a compensatory element.  For \nexample, it permits payment to former farmers and “Potential Producers.”  DFAP Guide at 10, \n15 (noting that (1) the term “Farmers” “includes applicants who—at any point—owned or leased \na farming[] operation”; and (2) the term “Potential Producers” “includes applicants who never \nowned or leased a farming[] operation” (first emphasis added)).  These individuals would not \nreceive assistance, at least not in connection with any current farming efforts. \nStill, I agree with the majority that the statute’s use of “assistance” fairly contemplates \nthat an applicant under § 22007(e) is capable of being assisted; i.e., that the applicant is alive to \nreceive the payment.  For that reason, I would hold that legacy claims brought on behalf of \nfarmers who were alive when the statute took effect should be eligible for recovery, assuming \nthey meet all other conditions. \n ",

(“BFAA”); Thomas Burrell; \nMary Ferguson; Claudette Jackson; and Mauzie J. Furlow (collectively “Plaintiffs”), brought this \nconsolidated proposed class action against Defendants Thomas J. Vilsack and Zach Ducheneaux \n(collectively “Defendants”).  (ECF No. 41.)  Before the Court are Plaintiffs’ Corrected [] Second \n[] Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 54), Defendants’ Consolidated Brief in \nOpposition to Plaintiffs’ Second Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and in Support of \nDefendants’ Cross-Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 64-1), Plaintiffs’ Reply to Defendants’ \nConsolidated Brief (ECF No. 68), and Defendants’ Reply (ECF No. 72).  For the following \nreasons, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ Second Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and \nGRANTS Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.  \n \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 74   Filed 01/09/24   Page 2 of 16    PageID 730\nBACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs seek judicial review of a final agency action by the United States Department of \nAgriculture (“USDA”) in connection with the implementation of Section 22007 of the Inflation \nReduction Act (“IRA”).  (ECF No. 41 at PageID 329.)  The IRA made available $2.2 billion in \nfinancial assistance to farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners who experienced discrimination \nby a USDA farm-lending program before January 1, 2021.  (Id.)  The USDA announced on  \nJuly 7, 2023, that it had established a Discrimination Financial Assistance Program (“DFAP”).  \n(Id.)  Under DFAP, people discriminated against in a USDA-loan program before January 2021 \nwere initially required to submit applications for financial assistance by October 31, 2023.  (Id.)   \nPlaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction suspending the October 31, 2023 application \ndeadline, arguing that the deadline is “arbitrary and capricious, violative of separation of powers \nand federal Due Process.”  (ECF No. 16 at PageID 136.)  On September 22, 2023, the USDA \nextended the deadline until January 13, 2024.  (ECF No. 38 at PageID 311.)  As a result, \nPlaintiffs withdrew their motion.  (Id.) \nOn October 31, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a second preliminary injunction motion to enjoin \nDefendants from enforcing the January 13, 2024 deadline, require Defendants to accept DFAP \napplications on behalf of decedent’s estates (“Legacy Applications”), suspend the use of the \n“unduly complex application,” and declare that the DFAP process must also apply to housing \nloans.  (ECF No. 54 at PageID 457.)  On November 13, 2023, Defendants responded to \nPlaintiffs’ Motion and filed a Cross-Motion to Dismiss, asserting that the case must be dismissed \nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(1) and \nfor failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).  (ECF No. 64.)   \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 74   Filed 01/09/24   Page 3 of 16    PageID 731\nANALYSIS \nI.  Motion to Dismiss \n  Defendants seek dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).  (ECF No. 64.)  “When a \ndefendant moves for a motion to dismiss under both Rule 12(b)(1) and (b)(6), the court should \nconsider the 12(b)(1) motion first because the 12(b)(6) motion is moot if subject matter \njurisdiction does not exist.”  Damnjanovic v. United States Dep’t of Air Force, 135 F. Supp. 3d \n601, 604 (E.D. Mich. 2015).  As explained below, Plaintiffs’ claims regarding the deadline and \ncomplexity of the application are dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of standing.  The \nremaining claims are dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. \n  A.  Rule 12(b)(1) \n    1.   Legal Standard \nDefendants challenge Plaintiffs’ standing to bring their claims, asserting this action must \nbe dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1).  (ECF No. 64-1 at \nPageID 553.)  A Rule 12(b)(1) motion can challenge lack of subject matter jurisdiction in two \nways: a facial attack or a factual attack.  Dayton Area Chamber of Comm. v. Becerra, No. 3:23-\ncv-156, 2023 WL 6378423, at *4 (S.D. Ohio, Sept. 29, 2023) (citing Abbott v. Mich., 474 F.3d \n324, 328 (6th Cir. 2007)).  “A facial attack on the subject-matter jurisdiction alleged in the \ncomplaint questions merely the sufficiency of the pleading.”  Id. (quoting Gentek Bldg. Prods., \nInc. v. Sherwin-Williams Co., 491 F.3d 320, 330 (6th Cir. 2007)).  Where there is a facial attack \non standing, the Court “must accept as true all material allegations of the complaint, and must \nconstrue the complaint in favor of the complaining party.”  Parsons v. U.S. Dep’t of Just., 801 \nF.3d 701, 710 (6th Cir. 2015) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 501 (1975)).  This \n“analysis must be confined to the four corners of the complaint.”  Id. at 706.   \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 74   Filed 01/09/24   Page 4 of 16    PageID 732\nConversely, a factual attack allows the court to consider evidence outside the pleadings \nand to “weigh evidence to confirm the existence of the factual predicates for subject-matter \njurisdiction.”  Becerra, 2023 WL 6378423, at *4 (quoting Carrier Corp. v. Outokumpu Oyj, 673 \nF.3d 430, 440 (6th Cir. 2012) (citations omitted)). A court may look to affidavits, and other \nmaterials in the record in determining whether plaintiffs have adequately demonstrated \nstanding.  Warth, 422 U.S. at 501; see also Plunderbund Media, L.L.C. v. DeWine, 753 Fed. \nApp’x 362, 366 (6th Cir. 2018) (authorizing a review of preliminary injunction documents, such \nas declarations).   \nIt appears that Defendants rely on a factual attack, arguing that Plaintiffs have not \nidentified a single BFAA member who faces a cognizable injury-in-fact as a result of the USDA-\nimposed deadline or challenged eligibility criteria.  Therefore, in reviewing the issue of standing, \nthe briefing on the Preliminary Injunction and the Motion to Dismiss, as well as Plaintiffs’ \nsupporting declarations, may all be considered.     \n  2.  Standing  \nArticle III, Section 1, of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to hear \nonly actual cases and controversies.  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 337 (2016); Lyshe v. \nLevy, 854 F.3d 855, 857 (6th Cir. 2017).  Standing is an indispensable part of the case or \ncontroversy requirement of Article III.  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).  \nStanding analysis “is particularly rigorous when reaching the merits of the dispute would force \nthe Court to decide whether an action taken by one of the other two branches of the Federal \nGovernment was unconstitutional.”  Parsons v. U.S. Dep’t of Just., 801 F.3d 701, 710 (6th Cir. \n2015) (internal citations and quotations omitted).  “To have standing, a plaintiff must allege  \n(1) an injury in fact (2) that’s traceable to the defendant’s conduct and (3) that the courts can \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 74   Filed 01/09/24   Page 5 of 16    PageID 733\nredress.”  Gerber v. Herskovitz, 14 F.4th 500, 505 (6th Cir. 2021) (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. at 559–\n61). \nThe requirement that a plaintiff suffer an injury-in-fact is “the ‘irreducible constitutional \nminimum’ of standing.”  Ass’n of Am. Physicians & Surgeons v. U. S. Food and Drug Admin., \n13 F.4th 531, 538 (6th Cir. 2021) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560).  Associations, like the \nBFAA, have standing to sue on behalf of one or more of their members if those members have \nbeen injured, even if the association itself is not directly impacted by a defendant’s actions.  \nWaskul v. Washtenaw Cty. Cmty. Mental Health, 900 F.3d 250, 253 (6th Cir. 2018).  Thus, the \nassociation must identify at least one of its members who has standing.  Ass’n of Am. Physicians \n& Surgeons, 13 F.4th at 543.   \nPlaintiffs’ Second Motion for a Preliminary Injunction seeks to: 1) require Defendants to \naccept Legacy Applications, 2) apply the DFAP process to discrimination in housing loans, 3) \nenjoin Defendants from enforcing the January 13, 2024 deadline, and 4) suspend the use of the \n“unduly complex application.”  (ECF No. 54 at PageID 457.)  To demonstrate Article III \nstanding, Plaintiffs submitted declarations from the following individuals: 1) Thomas Burrell \n(ECF No. 28-1); 2) Mary Ferguson (ECF No. 29-1); 3) Claudette Jackson (ECF No. 29-2)1; and \nAllie Tillis (ECF No. 54-1).  Each of these individuals’ standing is considered before analyzing \nwhether BFAA has associational standing.   \nAs is explained below, Burrell and Tillis do not have standing to assert any claims, \nFerguson and Jackson have standing to assert their Legacy Application claims, and Furlow has \nstanding to bring her housing application claim.   \n \n1 The declarations from Burrell, Ferguson, and Jackson were submitted in support of \nPlaintiffs’ first Motion for Preliminary Injunction, and Plaintiffs incorporated them here by \nreference.  Furlow is a named Plaintiff, but she did not submit a declaration. \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 74   Filed 01/09/24   Page 6 of 16    PageID 734\n    a.   Thomas Burrell \nBurrell is a farmer and the president of the BFAA.  (ECF No. 41 at PageID 340.)  The \nAmended Complaint states that he “is a representative of other BFAA members who have had \nclaims that meet Section 22007’s eligibility criteria.”  (Id.)  However, the Amended Complaint \ndoes not allege that Burrell is eligible for assistance or intends to file an application, but is unable \nto do so by the deadline.  Burrell’s declaration similarly does not provide any evidence that he \nwas injured.  Instead, he asserts that, in his capacity as BFAA president, “I have had personal \ninvolvement in the filing of multiple applications for financial assistance to remediate for racial \ndiscrimination by the [USDA] against BFAA members in connection with USDA farm lending \nprograms.”  (Id.)  Plaintiffs have not shown that Burrell has or will suffer an injury because of \nthe January 13 deadline or any of the eligibility requirements.  Therefore, he does not have \nstanding to pursue these claims.   \n    b.  Mary Ferguson and Claudette Jackson \nThe Amended Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs Ferguson and Jackson both have claims \non behalf of decedents.  (ECF No. 41 at PageID 338.)  According to their nearly identical \ndeclarations, both are members of BFAA whose “[deceased] parents[] were farmers[] who \nexperienced discrimination in a USDA farm loan program prior to January 1, 2021.”  (ECF No. \n29-1 at PageID 177; ECF No. 29-2 at PageID 180.)  Ferguson’s declaration states that, before her \nfather’s death, he “was on two occasions denied financial assistance by the [USDA] in its loan \nprograms.  The denials were based on racial discrimination.”  (ECF No. 29-1 at PageID 177–78.)  \nJackson’s deceased father similarly allegedly “experienced racial discrimination on numerous \noccasions in connection with USDA loan applications.”  (ECF No. 29-2 at PageID 181.)  \nPlaintiffs argue that both Jackson and Ferguson suffered injury because the DFAP application \ndoes not provide a method to file Legacy Applications.  (ECF No. 68 at PageID 682.)   \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 74   Filed 01/09/24   Page 7 of 16    PageID 735\nDefendants contend that Jackson and Ferguson have not established that they would be \neligible for DFAP, even if the program was expanded to allow Legacy Applications because they \n“simply assert, in conclusory (and virtually identical) language, that their relatives experienced \ndiscrimination, without explaining the nature or extent or the losses that this alleged \ndiscrimination caused.”  (ECF No. 64-1 at Paged 554.)  According to Defendants, “[t]hese \nassertions do not establish that either would be eligible for the Program even if their challenges \nwere successful, and so fail to establish that these policies injured them.”  (Id.)   \nAlthough the allegations regarding the discrimination that Jackson and Ferguson’s \nrelatives experienced are not particularly fleshed out, they are sufficient to establish an injury at \nthis stage.  Because Jackson and Ferguson are prevented from seeking relief on behalf of their \ndeceased relatives under DFAP’s current policies prohibiting Legacy Applications, they have \nalleged an injury that is traceable to Defendants’ conduct and redressable by the Court.  Gerber \nv. Herskovitz, 14 F.4th at 505 (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. at 559–61).  Jackson and Ferguson have \nestablished standing to challenge DFAP’s policy on Legacy Applications. \nHowever, neither Plaintiff has shown that the January 13 deadline would cause them \ninjury.  Both state in their declarations that the original October 31, 2023 deadline does not allow \nenough time for them to complete the probate process.  (ECF No. 29-1 at PageID 179; ECF No. \n29-2 at PageID 182.)  However, Defendants point out that because DFAP does not accept \nLegacy Applications, there is no probate requirement.  (ECF No. 64-1 at PageID 556.)  If \nPlaintiffs are successful in their challenge to the prohibition of Legacy Applications, it does not \nnecessarily follow that they would be injured by the means by which Legacy Applications would \nbe considered.  Rather, it is simply speculation that DFAP would require the probate process to \nbe completed, which is insufficient to demonstrate standing.  See Kanuszewski v. Mich. Dep’t of \nHealth & Hum. Servs., 927 F.3d 396, 410 (6th Cir. 2019) (“‘[M]ere[] speculat[ion] and . . . \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 74   Filed 01/09/24   Page 8 of 16    PageID 736\nassumptions about’ how the government will operate one of its programs is not a sufficiently \nparticularized harm to meet the injury-in-fact requirement.”)  Thus, neither Ferguson nor Jackson \nhave standing to challenge the January 13 deadline.   \n    c.  Mauzie Furlow \nMauzie Furlow is the only Plaintiff identified in the Amended Complaint who claims to \nhave experienced discrimination when applying for a USDA housing loan.  (ECF No. 41 at \nPageID 338.)  Although the Amended Complaint includes few facts regarding this alleged \ndiscrimination, and Plaintiffs do not include a declaration from Furlow, the allegations in the \nAmended Complaint are sufficient to allege an injury in fact for standing purposes.  Furlow has \nstanding to challenge DFAP’s exclusion of housing loan applications.      \n    d.  Allie Tillis  \n  In support of their Second Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Plaintiffs also submitted a \ndeclaration from Allie Tillis.  (ECF No. 54-1.)  Tillis challenges the timing and complexity of the \nDFAP application, as well as the exclusion of housing loans from the program.  However, Tillis \nis not a Plaintiff in this case, nor is she a member of BFAA.  (ECF No. 54 at PageID 475) \n(referring to Tillis as a BFAA “associate”).  Because she is not a plaintiff in this case, she does \nnot have individual standing; because she is not a member of BFAA, BFAA cannot rely on her to \nestablish associational standing, as explained in more detail below.  Ass’n of Am. Physicians & \nSurgeons, 13 F.4th at 543.   \n    e.  BFAA Associational Standing \nBFAA asserts standing on behalf of its members, rather than based on injuries to itself as \nan organization.  Therefore, it must demonstrate that at least one of its members has suffered an \ninjury-in-fact.  Ass’n of Am. Physicians & Surgeons, 13 F.4th at 543.  To establish associational \nstanding, the association must show that “[1] its members would otherwise have standing to sue \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 74   Filed 01/09/24   Page 9 of 16    PageID 737\nin their own right, [2] the interests at stake are germane to the organization’s purpose, and  \n[3] neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual \nmembers in the lawsuit.”  Waskul, 900 F.3d at 254–55 (citing Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert. \nComm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Defendants do not \ncontest the second and third associational standing requirements for the purposes of this Motion.   \nAs for the first requirement, as stated above, two BFAA members, Jackson and Ferguson, \nhave standing to challenge DFAP’s failure to consider Legacy Applications.  Similarly, Furlow, \na BFAA member, has standing to challenge the exclusion of housing loan applications.  \nTherefore, BFAA has associational standing as to the Legacy Application and housing loan \nclaims.   \nHowever, Plaintiffs offer no BFAA member who has standing to challenge the January \n13 deadline or the complexity of the application.  Burrell does not have standing to pursue any \nclaims because he does not intend to file an application.  Tillis is not a member of BFAA, thus \nBFAA cannot rely on her declaration to establish associational standing.  The only specific \nallegations regarding Furlow in the Amended Complaint concern housing loan applications and \nshe did not submit a declaration.  Neither Jackson nor Ferguson refer to the complexity of the \napplication in their declarations, and, as stated above, they do not have standing to challenge the \nJanuary 13 deadline.  Thus, the BFAA only has standing to pursue the Legacy Application and \nthe housing loan claims.   \nAs a result, Plaintiffs’ claims regarding the application complexity and deadline are \ndismissed for lack of standing pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1).  Given this result, only the Legacy \nApplication and housing loan claims are analyzed under Rule 12(b)(6).    \n \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 74   Filed 01/09/24   Page 10 of 16    PageID 738\nB.  Rule 12(b)(6) \n  1.  Legal Standard \nDefendants also argue that the case should be dismissed for failure to state a claim under \nRule 12(b)(6).  (ECF No. 64-1 at PageID 557.)  A complaint must contain “a short and plain \nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  The \ncomplaint must contain sufficient facts to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,” \nmeaning it includes “factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that \nthe defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) \n(citing Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556, 570 (2007)).  The complaint need not \nset forth “detailed factual allegations,” but it must include more than “labels and conclusions,” “a \nformulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action,” and “‘naked assertion[s]’ devoid of \n‘further factual enhancement.’”  Id. (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 557).  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) allows the Court to dismiss a complaint for \nfailure to comply with the requirements of Rule 8(a)(2).  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  When \nconsidering a 12(b)(6) motion, the Court must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as \ntrue and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.  Adkisson v. Jacobs Eng’g \nGrp., Inc., 790 F.3d 641, 647 (6th Cir. 2015) (internal citation omitted).   \n    2.  Failure to Present Claims to Agency \nAs an initial matter, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed because \nPlaintiffs failed to raise their specific arguments before the USDA.  (ECF No. 64-1 at PageID \n557.)  Plaintiffs counter by arguing that “Jackson and Ferguson attended multiple USDA DFAP \nworkshops and informed USDA officials of their desire to file on behalf of their descendants.”  \n(ECF No. 68 at PageID 687.)  Plaintiffs also suggest that previous litigation between BFAA and \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 74   Filed 01/09/24   Page 11 of 16    PageID 739\nthe USDA “concerning the interests of Black decedent[]s who lost farm land as a direct result of \nthe USDA” should have put the agency on notice.  (Id.)   \n“The administrative waiver doctrine, commonly referred to as issue exhaustion, provides \nthat it is inappropriate for courts reviewing agency decisions to consider arguments not raised \nbefore the administrative agency involved.”  Coal. for Gov’t Procurement v. Fed. Prison Indus., \n365 F.3d 435, 461–62 (6th Cir. 2004); see also United States v. L.A. Tucker Truck Lines, \nInc., 344 U.S. 33, 37 (1952) (“Simple fairness . . . requires as a general rule that courts should \nnot topple over administrative decisions unless the administrative body not only has erred but has \nerred against objection made at the time appropriate under its practice.”); Michigan Dep’t of \nEnv’t Quality v. Browner, 230 F.3d 181, 183 n.1 (6th Cir. 2000) (concluding that issues not \nraised during the agency’s notice and comment period were waived for purposes of appellate \nreview).  However, the Supreme Court has limited the application of the administrative waiver \ndoctrine to three scenarios: 1) a statutorily-imposed issue exhaustion requirement, 2) an issue \nexhaustion requirement imposed by an agency’s regulations, and 3) a judicially-imposed issue \nexhaustion requirement.  Coal. for Gov’t Procurement, 365 F.3d at 462–63 (citing Sims v. \nApfel, 530 U.S. 103, 107–09 (2000).   \nThere is no issue exhaustion requirement in either the IRA’s organic statute or its \nregulations.  Thus, the Court turns to whether a judicially-imposed issue exhaustion requirement \nis appropriate.  Coal. for Gov’t Procurement, 365 F.3d at 463 (citing Sims, 530 U.S. at 107–09).   \nA court should impose an issue exhaustion requirement when the administrative \nproceeding is similar to traditional litigation—“that is, [where] the proceeding before the \nadministrative agency is sufficiently ‘adversarial,’ as opposed to ‘inquisitorial.’”  Id. at 643 \n(quoting Sims, 530 U.S. at 109–10) (“[T]he desirability of a court imposing a requirement of \nissue exhaustion depends on the degree to which the analogy to normal adversarial litigation \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 74   Filed 01/09/24   Page 12 of 16    PageID 740\napplies in a particular administrative proceeding.”).  Although the USDA “provided an \nexhaustive public process before establishing the conditions of the Program,” (ECF No. 64-1 at \nPageID 557) that process is not adversarial.  See Notice of Request for Public Comment, 87 Fed. \nReg. 62,359 (Oct. 14, 2022).  In its Notice of Request for Public Comment, the USDA states: \n“To help us design and implement policy to best provide the direct support called for by this \nprovision, USDA is seeking input from the public to ensure that relevant information is \nconsidered.”  Id.  Through this process, the USDA is seeking information to shape its policy.  \nThere is nothing in this process that can reasonably be defined as adversarial.    \nAlthough Plaintiffs do not contend that they participated in the notice and comment \nprocess, because that process is non-adversarial, this failure does not warrant a judicially-\nimposed issue exhaustion requirement.  Therefore, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss based on \nPlaintiffs’ failure to present their claims to the agency is DENIED.   \n  3.  Failure to State a Claim \n  In the alternative, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed for failure \nto state a claim.  In their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that DFAP’s exclusion of Legacy \nClaims and housing loans violates the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), separation of \npowers, and Due Process.  (ECF No. 41 at PageID 343–44, 347–48.)  Each argument is \naddressed below.   \n      a.  APA \n  In their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs assert that the ineligibility of Legacy Applications \nand housing loans is arbitrary and capricious under the APA.  The APA states that, when \nreviewing agency actions, “[t]he reviewing court shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706.  “Under what [the Supreme Court has] \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 74   Filed 01/09/24   Page 13 of 16    PageID 741\ncalled this ‘narrow’ standard of review, . . . an agency [must] ‘examine the relevant data and \narticulate a satisfactory explanation for its action.’”  Tennessee v. United States Dep’t of Agric., \nNo. 3:22-cv-257, 2023 WL 3048342, at *14 (E.D. Tenn. Mar. 29, 2023) (quoting F.C.C. v. Fox \nTelevision Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 513 (2009).  But “a court is not to substitute its judgment \nfor that of the agency and should uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency's path \nmay reasonably be discerned.”  Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. at 513–14 (quoting  \nBowman Transp., Inc. v. Ark.–Best Freight Sys., Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 286 (1974) (internal \nquotations omitted)).   \nAs Defendants point out, the ineligibility of Legacy Applications and housing loans \ncomes from Congress’s language in appropriating the funds, not from the USDA.  (ECF No. 64-\n1.)  Section 22007 of the IRA states that Congress appropriated funds “for a program to provide \nfinancial assistance, including the cost of any financial assistance, to farmers, ranchers, or forest \nlandowners determined to have experienced discrimination prior to January 1, 2021, in \nDepartment of Agriculture farm lending programs.”  Pub. L. No. 117-169, § 22007, 136 Stat. \n1818, 2023 (2022).   \nThe plain language of Section 22007 makes clear that it is designed to provide financial \nassistance to claimants who have experienced discrimination; it does not permit claims on behalf \nof others, including estates.  Moreover, the word “assistance” means “[t]he act of helping or \naiding.”  Assistance, Black’s Law Dictionary (11th Ed. 2019).  The use of the word assistance, \nrather than compensation, supports the idea that the funding was intended to provide prospective \nrelief for living farmers, rather than to compensate the families of deceased ones.   \nIn addition, as for the housing loan program, the IRA specifically refers to “farm lending \nprograms,” not housing lending programs or USDA lending programs generally.  Pub. L. No. \n117-169, § 22007, 136 Stat. 1818, 2023 (2022).   Because “an agency may not rewrite clear \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 74   Filed 01/09/24   Page 14 of 16    PageID 742\nstatutory terms to suit its own sense of how the statute should operate,” the USDA’s exclusion of \nLegacy Applications and housing loans when implementing the statute is proper.  Util. Air \nRegul. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 328 (2014).  Thus, the Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ APA \nClaim is GRANTED.2   \n    b.  Separation of Powers \nPlaintiffs also argue that the USDA’s exclusion of Legacy Applications and housing \nloans violates separation of powers because “[t]here is no justification for USDA being permitted \nto arrogate unto itself the powers to . . . limit relief to living [Farm Service Agency] applicants.”  \n(ECF No. 41 at PageID 346.)  Plaintiffs contend that the USDA’s exclusion of Legacy \nApplications and housing loans violates the nondelegation doctrine because it constituted an \nexercise of legislative power for which Congress failed to prescribe an intelligible principle to \ngovern the agency’s discretion.   \n“The nondelegation doctrine bars Congress from transferring its legislative power to \nanother branch of Government.”  Gundy v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 2116, 2121 (2019).  \nHowever, “a statutory delegation is constitutional as long as Congress ‘lay[s] down by legislative \nact an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [exercise the delegated \nauthority] is directed to conform.’”  Id. at 2123.    \nAs stated above, the USDA’s exclusion of Legacy Applications and home loans is based \non the plain language of Section 22007.  Because the USDA’s implementation of the program is \nconsistent with the plain language of the statute, it does not violate the nondelegation doctrine.  \n \n2 Plaintiffs also argue that not allowing Legacy Claims conflicts with 42 U.S.C. § 1982, \nwhich states, “All citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and \nTerritory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and \nconvey real and personal property.”  DFAP does not violate or affect this right.   \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 74   Filed 01/09/24   Page 15 of 16    PageID 743\nSee United States Dep’t of Agric., 2023 WL 3048342, at *25.  As a result, the Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs’ Separation of Powers claim is GRANTED.   \nc.  Due Process \n  Finally, Plaintiffs assert in their Amended Complaint that the exclusion of Legacy \nApplications and home loans violates the Fifth Amendment because the USDA is depriving \napplicants of property without adhering to constitutionally sufficient procedures.  (ECF No. 41 at \nPageID 347.)    \n  The Fifth Amendment prohibits the government from depriving an individual of \n“property without due process of law.”  A government benefit is a property interest if there are \n“rules or mutually explicit understandings that support [a plaintiff’s] claim of entitlement to” it.  \nKaplan v. Univ. of Louisville, 10 F.4th 569, 577 (6th Cir. 2021) (quoting Perry v. Sindermann, \n408 U.S. 593, 601 (1972)).  “But neither a ‘unilateral expectation’ to enjoy the alleged property \ninterest nor an ‘abstract need or desire for it’ is enough.”  Id. (quoting Bd. of Regents v. Roth, \n408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972)).   \n  As stated above, the USDA policy not to accept Legacy Applications and home loans \ncomplies with the IRA.  Because Plaintiffs are not eligible for DFAP, they cannot establish a \nproperty interest of which they were deprived.  Kaplan, 10 F.4th at 577.  Therefore, the Motion \nto Dismiss Plaintiffs’ Due Process claim is GRANTED.   \nII.  Preliminary Injunction \nThere are four factors the Court must balance when assessing whether to issue \nextraordinary relief, here a preliminary injunction: “(1) whether the movant has a strong \nlikelihood of success on the merits; (2) whether the movant would suffer irreparable injury \nwithout the injunction; (3) whether the issuance of the injunction would cause substantial harm \nto others; and (4) whether the public interest would be served by the issuance of the injunction.”  \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-02527-SHL-cgc   Document 74   Filed 01/09/24   Page 16 of 16    PageID 744\nCertified Restoration Dry Cleaning Network, LLC v. Tenke Corp., 511 F.3d 535, 542 (6th Cir. \n2007).  The Court is not required to explicitly consider each of these factors if one is dispositive.  \nId.  Although the party is not required to fully prove its case at this stage, it must show “more \nthan a mere possibility of success.”  Id. at 543 (cleaned up).   \nBecause Plaintiffs claims are dismissed under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), it follows that \nPlaintiffs do not have a strong likelihood of success on the merits.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction is DENIED.   \nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons set forth above, Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ Second Motion for a \nPreliminary Injunction and GRANTS Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED, the 9th day of January, 2024. \n \n            s/ Sheryl H.
