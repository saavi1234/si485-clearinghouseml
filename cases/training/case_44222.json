    "summary": "<p>This case involves allegations of inhumane conditions in Washington's Pierce County Jail relating to plumbing problems and sewage backups.</p>\r\n<p>This lawsuit was initiated on January 25, 2021 when plaintiff filed a pro se complaint in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington against Pierce County and individuals at the Pierce County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department. (The complaint was filed on behalf of two plaintiffs, but the court later dismissed one and ordered each to file their own individual claims). The plaintiff sued under 42 USC &sect; 1983, alleging that conditions in the Mental Health Unit of the Pierce County Jail relating to plumbing and sewer conditions violated the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause and the 8th Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. The plaintiff also brought claims under Washington state law.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that he was being held in inhumane and dangerously unsanitary conditions due to the constant smell of urine and feces caused by sewage backup and other sanitation issues. Plaintiff also alleged that the staff failed to provide adequate cleaning and personal protective equipment and generally ignored complaints. He sought declaratory relief, an injunction, and compensatory and punitive damages. The case was assigned to District Judge John C. Coughenour.</p>\r\n<p>On March 31, 2021, the plaintiff moved for appointment of counsel. Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on April 20, 2021. The following month, on May 24, Magistrate Judge S. Kate Vaughn denied plaintiff&rsquo;s motion to appoint counsel. In June 2021, defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and, alternatively, to change venue.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file another amended complaint on December 21, 2021. On that same day, the case was reassigned to District Judge Lauren King.</p>\r\n<p>On March 10, 2022, Magistrate Judge Vaughn issued a R&amp;R that recommended partially granting both defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss and plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. 2022 WL 2791521. Specifically, Magistrate Judge Vaughn recommended denying Defendants' motion to dismiss and granting plaintiff&rsquo;s motion to amend with respect to the plaintiff's constitutional claims against certain specific defendants in their individual capacities. However, the magistrate judge recommended dismissing individual constitutional claims against other named defendants where the claims were based on a theory of vicarious liability. Magistrate Judge Vaughn also recommended granting plaintiff's motion to amend and denying defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss with respect to the constitutional claims against the County, claims against all the individual named defendants in their official capacities, and the state law claims. Magistrate Vaughn also recommended denying defendant&rsquo;s motion to change venue. This report was adopted by Judge King on July 15, 2022. 2022 WL 2789010. On the same day, the plaintiff filed his second amended complaint.</p>\r\n<p>On August 8, 2022, Magistrate Judge Vaughn reconsidered plaintiffs request for appointment of counsel and granted it because the plaintiff's claims had largely survived the motion to dismiss. 2022 WL 3155368.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The parties subsequently settled the case. On May 30, 2023, the court directed the clerk to enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff for $33,000 plus an additional $12,000 in fees and costs. The case is now closed. However, the plaintiff filed <a href=\"../../../../case/46600/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a subsequent lawsuit</a> in 2023, alleging that the sanitation conditions at the jail were still unconstitutional and seeking to represent a class of people detained at the jail.</p>",

The plaintiff initially proceeded pro se, but was ultimately appointed counsel by the court in 2022.  The parties reached a settlement agreement in 2023 for $33,000 plus $12,000 in fees and costs.

Cornelius, submitting a May 15, 2023 email \n17  from  counsel  for  Plaintiff  Justin  Allen  Davey  (also  known  as  Echota  Wolfclan),  offering \n18  โadditional confirmation that Plaintiff has timely accepted Defendantsโ March 9, 2023 Amended \n19  Offer of Judgment[.]โ Dkt. No. 102 at 4; see Dkt. No. 100 (Defendantsโ Amended Offer of \n20  Judgment). Plaintiffโs counsel further states that โ[i]t was Plaintiffโs intention that the March 7, \n21  2023 Joint Statement . . . serve as notice and confirmation that Plaintiff had accepted Defendantsโ \n22  offer to settle for $33,000 plus $12,000 in fees and costs, which was then reflected in the Amended \n23  Offer of Judgment filed on March 9, 2023[.]โ Dkt. No. 102 at 4; see Dkt. No. 99 (partiesโ Joint \n24  Statement dated March 7, 2023).  \n \nORDER - 1 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV   Document 103   Filed 05/30/23   Page 2 of 3\n \n1  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68(a) provides that if a party serves written notice \n2  accepting an offer of judgment within 14 days after being served, โeither party may then file the \n3  offer and notice of acceptance, plus proof of service.โ If this process is followed, the Clerk โmust \n4  then enter judgment.โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 68(a).  \n5  Here, the parties have followed a convoluted process. On March 1, 2023, Defendants filed \n6  a โNotice of Acceptanceโ of their offer of judgment. See Dkt. Nos. 96, 97-1. However, because \n7  the offer appeared to exclude costs from the judgment, the Court considered it invalid. Dkt. No. \n8  98. The Court accordingly ordered that the parties either submit supplemental briefs clarifying \n9  whether  they  intended  that  the  Court  award  costs  or  else  โrevoke  and  redo  the  offer  and \n10  acceptance.โ Dkt. No. 98 at 3. The next day, the parties submitted a joint statement indicating that \n11  they had agreed to settle the matter for โ$33,000 plus $12,000.00 for costs and attorneysโ feesโ on \n12  March 3, 2023, and that they would โfile an updated Offer of Judgmentโ reflecting those amounts. \n13  Dkt. No. 99 at 1. On March 9, Defendants filed an Amended Offer of Judgment that specified that \n14  the offer was for $33,000 plus โan additional Twelve Thousand Dollars ($12,000.00) in costs and \n15  fees[.]โ Dkt. No. 100 at 1. No acceptance followed.  \n16  On May 11, 2023, after Counsel for Defendants left a voicemail with the Courtroom \n17  Deputy inquiring about the status of Docket Number 100, the Court issued an Order reminding the \n18  parties that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68(a) requires the clerk to enter judgment only โ[i]f, \n19  within 14 days after being served, the opposing party serves written notice accepting the offer,โ \n20  and that โthe parties ha[d] submitted no evidence that Plaintiff accepted the amended offer in \n21  accordance with Rule 68(a).โ Dkt. No. 101 (emphasis added). On May 26, Defendants filed a May \n22  15, 2023 email from Plaintiffโs counsel to Defendants stating that Plaintiff intended to accept \n23  Defendantsโ March 9, 2023 amended offer (Dkt. No. 100) via the March 7, 2023 joint statement \n24  (Dkt. No. 99). Dkt. No. 102 at 4.  \n \nORDER - 2 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV   Document 103   Filed 05/30/23   Page 3 of 3\n \n1  This muddy record is less than ideal. The March 7 joint statement, which indicated that the \n2  parties โw[ould] file an updated Offer of Judgment,โ Dkt. No. 99 at 1, cannot count as an \n3  acceptance of the forthcoming March 9, 2023 offer under Rule 68(a). However, the record reflects \n4  that Defendants sent Plaintiff a written offer encompassing the two sums on March 3, 2023, and \n5  that Plaintiff subsequently accepted that offer in writing by March 7, 2023 at the latest. Dkt. No. \n6  99 at 1 (March 7, 2023 joint statement that โthe parties agreed to a settlement of all costs, including \n7  attorneysโ fees, in the amount of $12,000.00โ in addition to the $33,000 reflected in Docket \n8  Number 97-1). The Court construes the partiesโ filings together to constitute sufficient evidence \n9  of an offer of judgment, subsequent written acceptance within 14 days, and proof of service. \n10  Accordingly, the Court DIRECTS the Clerk to enter judgment in Plaintiffโs favor in the \n11  amount of $33,000 plus an additional $12,000 in fees and costs. See Dkt. Nos. 100; 102.  \n12   \n13  Dated this 30th day of May, 2023. \n14  A     \n15  Lauren King\nUnited States District Judge \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n \nORDER - 3 \n ",

ORDER RECONSIDERING REQUEST \nFOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL \n11  PIERCE COUNTY COUNCIL, et al.,  AND DIRECTING PRO BONO \nCOORDINATOR TO IDENTIFY PRO \n  Defendant.  BONO COUNSEL \n12 \n13 \n \n14  This is a 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 prisoner civil rights action.  Plaintiff previously moved for \n15  appointment of counsel.  Dkt. 24.  The Court previously denied that motion without prejudice.  \n16  Dkt. 31.  For the reasons below, the Court hereby sua sponte reconsiders Plaintiffโs request for \n17  appointment of counsel and concludes that extraordinary circumstances now support the \n18  appointment of counsel in this case.  Plaintiffโs request for appointment of counsel, Dkt. 24, is \n19  granted as provided below.  \n20  Generally, the decision to appoint pro bono counsel rests within โthe sound discretion of \n21  the trial court and is granted only in exceptional circumstances.โ  Agyeman v. Corrections Corp. \n22  of America, 390 F.3d 1101, 1103 (9th Cir. 2004).  A finding of exceptional circumstances \n23  requires an evaluation of both the likelihood of success on the merits and the ability of the \n \nORDER RECONSIDERING REQUEST FOR \nAPPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL AND DIRECTING \n \nPRO BONO COORDINATOR TO IDENTIFY PRO \nBONO COUNSEL - 1 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV   Document 73   Filed 08/08/22   Page 2 of 3\n \n1  plaintiff to articulate his or her claims pro se in light of the complexity of the legal issues \n2  involved.  Terrell v. Brewer, 935 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir. 1991) (citations omitted).  Neither of \n3  these factors is dispositive, and the factors must be viewed together before reaching a decision \n4  regarding appointment of counsel.  Wilborn v. Escalderon, 789 F.2d 1328, 1331 (9th Cir. 1986). \n5  Plaintiff previously moved for appointment of counsel shortly after commencing this \n6  action.  Dkt. 24.  The Court denied the motion at that time finding that, because Plaintiffโs \n7  amended complaint had just been served and Defendants had not yet filed an answer, it was too \n8  early in the case to assess Plaintiffโs likelihood of success on the merits.  Dkt. 31.  The Court also \n9  found that, at that early stage, the Court could not conclude that Plaintiffโs claims, that \n10  Defendants failed to properly address allegedly unsanitary conditions due to sewage backups in \n11  Plaintiffโs unit at Pierce County Jail, were particularly complex.  Id.  The Court further found \n12  that, at that early stage of the case, Plaintiff had demonstrated an adequate ability to articulate his \n13  claims pro se.  Id.   \n14  Since the order denying Plaintiffโs request for counsel, the litigation has advanced, and \n15  circumstances have changed.  While the Court cannot, at this time, definitely determine \n16  Plaintiffโs ultimate likelihood of success on the merits, the vast majority of his claims have now \n17  survived a motion to dismiss.  See Dkt. 71.  Furthermore, completing discovery and litigating the \n18  merits of Plaintiffโs conditions of confinement claims is likely to significantly increase the \n19  complexity of the litigation process, may require the ability to investigate the status of the \n20  plumbing and sewage system at Pierce County Jail, and potentially the ability to consult an \n21  expert or develop expert evidence.  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has at this time \n22  demonstrated a sufficient potential for success on the merits and that, in light of the increasing \n23 \n \nORDER RECONSIDERING REQUEST FOR \nAPPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL AND DIRECTING \n \nPRO BONO COORDINATOR TO IDENTIFY PRO \nBONO COUNSEL - 2 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV   Document 73   Filed 08/08/22   Page 3 of 3\n \n1  complexity of the litigation process at this stage, Plaintiff will face increasing challenges \n2  litigating and articulating his claims pro se.   \n3  The Court notes that Plaintiff has also asserted he faces additional difficulty litigating his \n4  case pro se due to his mental illness.  Dkt. 24.  While not dispositive on its own as there is \n5  limited information before the Court regarding the nature and impact of Plaintiffโs mental illness, \n6  considering all of the other factors discussed above, the Court finds that the fact that Plaintiff \n7  asserts he has a mental illness that may have the potential to affect his ability to litigate his case, \n8  also weighs in favor of appointing counsel.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that this case \n9  presents extraordinary circumstances that support the appointment of counsel pursuant to 28 \n10  U.S.C. ยง 1915. \n11  CONCLUSION AND DIRECTIONS TO CLERK \n12  Upon reconsideration, Plaintiffโs request for appointment of counsel, Dkt. 24, is granted, \n13  contingent on the identification of counsel willing to represent Plaintiff in this matter.  The \n14  Western District of Washingtonโs pro bono coordinator is directed to identify counsel to \n15  represent Plaintiff, in accordance with the Courtโs General Order 16-20 (โIn re: Amended Plan \n16  for the Representation of Pro Se Litigants in Civil Rights Actionsโ), section 4.  Once it has been \n17  determined whether the Court will be able to appoint an attorney to represent Plaintiff, the Court \n18  will issue appropriate orders.  \n19  The Clerk shall send a copy of this order to Plaintiff, counsel for Defendants, the pro \n20  bono coordinator, and the Honorable Lauren King.  \n21  Dated this 8th day of August, 2022. \n22 \n   \nA\n23 \nS.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION \n11  PIERCE COUNTY COUNCIL, et al., \n  Defendant. \n12 \n13 \n \n14 \nPlaintiff, Justin Allen Davey, proceeds pro se and in forma pauperis in this 42 U.S.C. ยง \n15 \n1983 civil rights action.  Plaintiff was a county detainee at Pierce County Jail at the time he \n16 \ncommenced this action.  See Dkts. 26, 53-2.  Plaintiffโs amended complaint challenges the \n17 \nconstitutionality of the conditions of his confinement while he was detained at Pierce County Jail \n18 \nfor approximately seven months, beginning in or around May of 2020.  Dkt. 26.  Currently \n19 \npending before the Court are Defendantsโ motion to dismiss the amended complaint and to \n20 \nchange venue (Dkts. 33, 47), and Plaintiffโs motion for leave to file a second amended complaint \n21 \n(Dkt. 53).  Plaintiff opposes Defendantsโ motion to dismiss (Dkts. 39), and Defendants oppose \n22 \nPlaintiffโs motion to amend (Dkt. 60). \n23 \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 1 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 2 of 35\n \n1  The Court has considered Defendantsโ motion to dismiss together with and in light of \n2  Plaintiffโs motion to amend and the proposed second amended complaint and has considered all \n3  of the briefing submitted with respect to the motions and the balance of the record.  Having done \n4  so, the Court recommends that Defendantsโ motion to dismiss (Dkts. 33, 47) and Plaintiffโs \n5  motion for leave to file a second amended complaint (Dkt. 53) be granted in part and denied in \n6  part and that Defendantsโ motion to change venue (Dkt. 30) be denied.   \n7  BACKGROUND \n8  Plaintiff commenced this action on or about January 25, 2021.  Dkt. 1.  In his amended \n9  complaint filed April 20, 2021, Plaintiff alleges that plumbing and sewer conditions in his unit \n10  (Mental Health Unit 3 North A) at Pierce County Jail caused sewage backups in the toilets in his \n11  cells and ongoing serious sanitation issues.  Dkt. 26.  Plaintiffโs amended complaint indicates that \n12  he was a pretrial detainee at the time of the events giving rise to his claims and alleges that the \n13  conditions of confinement at the Jail violated his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights.  Id. at \n14  11-12.  Plaintiffโs amended complaint names as Defendants: Pierce County/Pierce County Council; \n15  Ed Troyer, Sheriff of Pierce County; Patti Jackson, Chief of the Internal Operation of the Pierce \n16  County Sheriff Dept. Correction Bureau; B. Sutherlin, Captain Deputy Corrections Officer at the \n17  Pierce County Sheriffโs Department; Dobson, Lieutenant Deputy Corrections Officer at the Pierce \n18  County Sheriffโs Department; Mastandrea, Sergeant Deputy Corrections Officer at the Pierce \n19  County Sheriffโs Department; D. Herbison, Sergeant Deputy Corrections Officer at the Pierce \n20  County Sheriffโs Department; and, T. Pearson, Deputy Corrections Officer at the Pierce County \n21  Sheriffโs Department.1  Dkt. 26, at 4-10.  Plaintiff names all non-entity Defendants in their \n22  individual and official capacities.  Id. \n23   \n1 Defendantsโ motion to dismiss identifies the full names of several of the Defendants as Brian Sutherlin, \n  Matthew Dobson, Anthony Mastandrea, Darryl Herbison, and Torvald Pearson.  See Dkt. 33. \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 2 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 3 of 35\n \n1  Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiffโs amended complaint arguing primarily that \n2  Plaintiff failed to allege sufficient facts to state a claim against the Defendants under either the \n3  Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment standard based upon the conditions of his confinement at the \n4  Jail.2  Dkts. 33, 47.  Defendants also alternatively moved to change venue.  Dkt. 33.  Plaintiff \n5  subsequently moved to amend his complaint.  Dkt. 53.  Plaintiffโs proposed second amended \n6  complaint includes additional facts in support of his existing claims as well as new claims \n7  alleging negligence under Washington state law, violation of the Washington State Constitution, \n8  and violation of the Eighth Amendment during the period of a few days when Plaintiffโs status \n9  had changed to that of a post-conviction prisoner.  Dkt. 53-2.  Defendants oppose Plaintiffโs \n10  motion to amend on the grounds that the amendment is futile, arguing that Plaintiffโs proposed \n11  second amended complaint still fails to state a claim.  Dkts. 55, 60.  Defendants primarily rely on \n12  the same arguments they advance in their motion to dismiss, which highlight alleged deficiencies \n13  in the factual allegations in Plaintiffโs amended complaint and argue that Plaintiffโs proposed \n14  second amended complaint fails to cure those deficiencies.  Id. \n15  In the proposed second amended complaint, Plaintiff names the same Defendants but, as \n16  noted, includes additional facts and claims.  Dkt. 53-2.  Plaintiff again names all non-entity \n17  Defendants in their individual and official capacities.  Id.  He also clarifies that he was a pretrial \n18  detainee during the vast majority of the period at issue, from May 12, 2020 to March 12, 2021, \n19  and a post-conviction prisoner from March 12, 2021 to March 16, 2021.  Id.  Plaintiff alleges that \n20 \n \n2 As discussed below, the Eighth Amendment prohibits the cruel and unusual punishment of prisoners, \n21 \nwhile the punishment of pretrial detainees is prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Bell v. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 (1979) (โ[U]nder the Due Process Clause, a detainee may not be punished \n22 \nprior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance with due process of law.โ).  The Court notes that \nDefendantsโ original motion to dismiss largely addressed Plaintiffโs claims under the Eighth Amendment \n23  standard.  See Dkt. 33.  Accordingly, at the Courtโs direction, Defendants submitted additional briefing \naddressing Plaintiffโs claims under the Fourteenth Amendment standard in light of Plaintiffโs apparent \n  status as a pretrial detainee during the majority of the period in question.  See Dkts. 44, 47. \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 3 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 4 of 35\n \n1  on May 12, 2020, he was reclassified from Level 2 Mental Health Housing unit to Level 3 \n2  Mental Health Housing Unit (3 North A), which he indicates is a place where mentally ill \n3  detainees are placed mostly while awaiting competency evaluations.  Id. at 10.  He alleges when \n4  he arrived his cell was in a โdangerousโ condition in that there was human waste on the toilet \n5  seat, vomit, spit, mucus on floor, and the stench of feces and urine.  Id.  He indicates he was \n6  given a spray bottle but no PPE (personal protective equipment) and denied a change of clothes \n7  when bodily waste splashed on his clothes and on his hands and that he was forced to wear those \n8  same clothes for two days.  Id.  Plaintiff alleges on May 13, 2020, he noticed his toilet was full of \n9  human waste and that the surrounding area on the floor had splashes of human waste and that he \n10  immediately felt sick and was unable to eat his breakfast.  Id.  He indicates he requested cleaning \n11  supplies but was denied and informed cleaning supplies were handed out during graveyard hours \n12  and that he was forced to use his T-shirt to clean the area.  Id.  He also states he noticed urine and \n13  feces backfilling into the cell toilet from the cell next to his.  Id., at 11.  He states that every time \n14  the adjoining cell toilet flushed, raw sewage would back up and nearly overflow splashing onto \n15  the wall and floors, and that this occurred 10-15 times daily.  Id.   \n16  Plaintiff alleges that on May 13, 2020, there was a โformal inspectionโ which he indicates \n17  occurred every three weeks and was a day when different ranking officers (Captain, Lieutenant, \n18  and Sergeant) would come to the unit to make sure the facility was working and was also an \n19  opportunity for inmates to verbally communicate direct problems with higher ranking officers.  \n20  Id.  At the May 13 formal inspection, Plaintiff indicates he told the โCaptainโ and โLieutenantโ3 \n21  about the condition of his cell the previous day and showed them that the โbodily fluidsโ were \n22 \n \n3 Plaintiff does not specifically identify the Captain and Lieutenant here by name but, construing \n23  Plaintiffโs second amended complaint liberally, and based upon later references to the โCaptainโ and \nโLieutenantโ, the Court interprets Plaintiffโs complaint to refer here to Defendants Captain Sutherlin and \n  Lieutenant Dobson. \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 4 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 5 of 35\n \n1  not leaving the unit and that when the toilet flushed in the adjoining cell the waste would back up \n2  into his cell toilet.  Id.  He indicates that the Captain and Lieutenant took notes and said they \n3  would call and check on the issue but that, apparently, they did not do so because maintenance \n4  did not come.  Id.   \n5  Plaintiff alleges that thereafter nearly every day Jail cluster officers denied him cleaning \n6  supplies and PPE to clean contaminated areas after his toilet backfilled in his cell and that he was \n7  left to clean with his own T-shirts and sink water.  Id.  Plaintiff indicates he asked mental health \n8  social workers to move him due to increased psychiatric problems including hallucinations, \n9  anxiety and fear of contracting disease but that he was mostly ignored and told it was โan old \n10  building.โ  Id.   \n11  Plaintiff alleges that on May 18, 2020, he was moved to cell 25 where he found the toilet \n12  saturated with feces and urine and the stench of sitting urine and feces.  Id.  He claims he was \n13  again denied cleaning supplies by officers and forced to use his own clothes to clean areas.  Id. at \n14  12.  He indicates that although he was placed in difference cells in 3 North A he experienced the \n15  same constant sewage backup issues in every cell.  Id.  Plaintiff further claims the unit itself was \n16  saturated from the stench and fumes of raw sewage exploding out of 10 sewage drainage pipes \n17  next to the cell doors causing himself and other residents to endure constant headaches, \n18  vomiting, diarrhea, and inability to eat.  Id.   \n19  Plaintiff indicates that on the next formal inspection day, June 3, 2020, he and several \n20  other residents again informed Defendants Sutherlin, Dobson, and Pearson about the sewer \n21  situation.  Id.  He indicates he pleaded with these Defendants to fix the plumbing, informing \n22  them that every time the toilet in a connected cell flushed the bodily waste would back up into \n23  his toilet and splash everywhere and at times overflow and that he was denied cleaning supplies \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 5 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 6 of 35\n \n1  and left to clean with his T-shirt.  Id.  He indicates he informed them that every night waste \n2  would back up into the toilets and often overflow onto his cell floor and that he was forced to eat \n3  under these conditions.  Id.  Plaintiff also explained that when using the toilet, the waste from \n4  other prisoners would splash up onto him.  Id.  Plaintiff informed these Defendants that he \n5  believed that these conditions created a substantial risk of infectious, illness and disease and that \n6  the conditions were making him sick and exacerbating his mental illness.  Id.  Plaintiff indicates \n7  that Defendantsโ only response was that this was a โ30-year mistakeโ and that Pierce County \n8  wouldnโt pay for the issue to be fixed so the unit would โjust have to deal with it.โ  Id.  He \n9  indicates that when he complained about staff not giving him cleaning supplies, the Defendants \n10  laughed at him and ignored him.  Id.  Plaintiff indicates he and other residents requested \n11  grievances but were denied by cluster officers and told the issue wasnโt grievable because the \n12  Jail was already aware of the issue. Id. at 13. \n13  On June 16, 2020, Plaintiff indicates he filed a grievance (#530524) under โstaff \n14  treatment of inmates,โ because he was not permitted to grieve about not receiving cleaning \n15  supplies or plumbing issues.  Id.  The grievance related to the refusal of an Officer (โOlsenโ) to \n16  provide Plaintiff with adequate cleaning supplies, specifically a rag, to clean his cell.  Id.  \n17  Plaintiff alleges that when sewage splashes on the floor and residents of the unit are denied \n18  cleaning supplies, they are forced to walk on contaminated floors with just socks and slippers \n19  and thereafter pass the sewage from their socks to their beds.  Id.  Plaintiff indicates that from \n20  May 12, 2020, to June 18, 2020, he complained about the conditions of the unit daily to cluster \n21  officers, also noting the presence of insects coming from the sewage drainpipes, and that he was \n22  told by the officers that they werenโt plumbers and couldnโt solve the issue. Id.  Plaintiff \n23 \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 6 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 7 of 35\n \n1  indicates that during this same period he was only supplied any form of cleaning supplies on two \n2  occasions.  Id. \n3  Plaintiff indicates that on June 18, 2020, he was transferred to competency restoration \n4  services and on September 15, 2020, was transferred back to Pierce County Jail.  Id.  He \n5  indicates on September 16, 2020, he was transferred back to 3 North A and placed in cell 10-11 \n6  where he experienced the same issue of sewage backing up into the cell and was again denied \n7  cleaning supplies.  Id.  He alleges these same issues continued thereafter.  Id. at 14.  Plaintiff \n8  alleges he was transferred to cell 18 at some point by mental health social workers and that \n9  during their weekly visits he informed them that he woke up feeling dizzy and not well every \n10  morning because of the plumbing issue.  Id.  He indicates the social workers blamed his \n11  symptoms on his medications but notes he had not experienced these symptoms while on the \n12  same medications and detained at a different facility for restoration services.  Id.    \n13  Plaintiff indicates that at formal inspection on October 7, 2020, he complained again of \n14  the conditions to Defendants Sutherlin, Dobson, Pearson, and this time also to Defendant \n15  Mastandrea, explaining that the sewage and foul odor were making them sick, and mosquitos and \n16  flies were coming from the sewage drains.  Id.  Plaintiff indicates that the Defendants responded \n17  that Pierce County and the Jail were aware of the issue, that it was the way the plumbing was \n18  designed and would not be fixed at that time, and that Plaintiff would just have to deal with it.  \n19  Id.  Plaintiff indicates the conditions persisted and that he and other residents were continually \n20  denied requests for grievances.  Id. at 15. \n21  Plaintiff indicates that at formal inspection on October 28, 2020, he again informed \n22  Defendants Sutherlin, Dobson, and Pearson of the conditions and complained of being exposed \n23  to raw sewage.  Id.  Plaintiff states that Defendants again ignored his complaints and that \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 7 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 8 of 35\n \n1  Defendant Pearson told him the building was โoldโ and that if he didnโt like being there, he \n2  should โstop coming to jail.โ  Id.   \n3  Plaintiff indicates that at formal inspection on November 18, 2020, before he could \n4  complain, Defendants Sutherlin, Dobson, and Pearson told the unit that if anyone brought up \n5  issues that had already been discussed that disciplinary action would be taken and again told unit \n6  residents that they were aware of the plumbing issues and that it was a construction issue and \n7  wouldnโt be addressed at that time.  Id.  Plaintiff indicates that Defendants also informed the unit \n8  that cleaning supplies were not a policy but a privilege for the cluster officers to give at their \n9  disposal.  Id.  Plaintiff further alleges that he was also informed on another occasion that Pierce \n10  County had no specific policy requiring the provision of cleaning supplies to inmates.  Id. \n11  Plaintiff states that on December 13, 2020, a new officer to the unit, Officer Erwin, \n12  provided Plaintiff with cleaning supplies and suggested he kite the duty sergeant if he wanted a \n13  grievance.  Id. at 16.  Plaintiff indicates on December 14, 2020, he submitted a kite asking for a \n14  grievance to submit regarding the unsafe environment caused by the sewer.  Id.  He states that \n15  corrections officer Starks and Defendant Herbison came and asked what the problem was, and he \n16  informed them about the toilets overflowing, denial of cleaning supplies and the constant odor of \n17  raw sewage.  Id.  Plaintiff indicates that later that day corrections officer Starks told Plaintiff to \n18  dump buckets of water down the sewer pipes closets.  Id.  Plaintiff indicates that while he was \n19  dumping water, he noticed dead mice in mouse traps in two of the drainage pipes.  Id.  Plaintiff \n20  also indicates that the practice of dumping water down the drains โdoesnโt work.โ  Id. at 22.  He \n21  indicates that on December 15, 2020, he received a response to his kite from Defendant Herbison \n22  saying that โOfficers are researching the issues. The deputies report โNothing Unusual.โโ  Id. at \n23  16.  Plaintiff indicates he was denied a grievance.  Id.   \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 8 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 9 of 35\n \n1  Plaintiff indicates he again requested a grievance to a different duty sergeant and this \n2  time was issued a grievance by Sergeant Ake.  Id. at 17.  Plaintiff also alleges that he filed a \n3  grievance dated December 16, 2020, in which he raised the following issues: his health concern \n4  about the unit toilets; that he had raised the issue at the last four inspections; that the toilets shoot \n5  out other inmateโs feces; that he has to eat in his cell with other peopleโs fecal matter splattered \n6  all over the toilet; that there is a smell throughout the whole unit; that he is forced to clean \n7  contaminated areas without proper PPE; being forced to wait hours for cleaning supplies; that \n8  inmates threaten each other (including himself) because of the plumbing; and requests that the \n9  unit residents be moved until the conditions are made compatible with living.  Id.   \n10  Plaintiff indicates on December 18, 2020, a plumber named โJasonโ came and snaked the \n11  toilets and told Plaintiff the toilet wasnโt clogged.  Id.  Plaintiff states he explained the issue of \n12  the toilets backflowing and overflowing into the cell and โJasonโ acknowledged the issue but \n13  said it was a โshitty situationโ and in order to fix it they would have to reconstruct the plumbing \n14  and that Pierce County would not fund it.  Id.  Plaintiff indicates that later that day he received a \n15  response to his grievance from Defendant Mastandrea stating that maintenance checked and \n16  snaked the toilets and that he had spoken to Plaintiff who indicated he was satisfied with \n17  maintenanceโs response and explanation.  Id. at 18.  Plaintiff indicates he never spoke to \n18  Defendant Mastandrea and never said he was โsatisfiedโ with the response.  Id.  Plaintiff \n19  indicates he filed an appeal indicating he had never spoken to Defendant Mastandrea, that he was \n20  not satisfied with the response, and also complaining that there was not response to his \n21  complaints about lack of cleaning supplies or the odors causing physical illness.  Id.  Plaintiff \n22  states that after handing his appeal to the cluster officer it was โnever seen againโ indicating it \n23  was either lost in the transfer or purposely rejected.  Id.   \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 9 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 10 of 35\n \n1  In January 2021, Plaintiff indicates he sent medical kites asking to be checked medically \n2  due to the exposure to raw sewage but medical staff responded there was โno medical indication \n3  for this request.โ  Id. at 19.  On January 14, 2021, Plaintiff indicates he was hired as his Units \n4  โunit workerโ and was told he would be given cleaning supplies at 9 p.m. to clean the day room \n5  and shower.  Id.  Plaintiff states he would hide some of the cleaning disinfectant he received in \n6  order to clean his own cell.โ Id.   \n7  Plaintiff indicates that at the end of January 2021, he sent kites asking why the appeal of \n8  his grievance had not been heard.  Id.  He indicates on February 2, 2021, he received a response \n9  from Captain Ganga indicating that his office had never received Plaintiffโs appeal.  Id.  Plaintiff \n10  states on February 3, 2021, the Jail went into mandatory quarantine status and residents of the \n11  unit were stuck in their contaminated cells for four days.  Id.  at 20.  Plaintiff indicates on \n12  February 6, 2021, an officer read his ยง 1983 complaint and made copies of it.  Id.  He states on \n13  February 7, 2021, Sergeant Ake and Defendant Mastandrea came and asked Plaintiff what was \n14  โgoing onโ, which he believed to be a reference to his ยง 1983 complaint.  Id.  Plaintiff indicates \n15  he repeated his complaints about the conditions.  Id.  On February 10, 2021, Captain Genga came \n16  to the unit and Plaintiff informed him of the ongoing plumbing issues and denial of cleaning \n17  supplies.  Id. at 21.  Plaintiff alleges Captain Genga indicated he would contact maintenance and \n18  that he would have a staff meeting about getting cleaning supplies to the residents when needed.  \n19  Id.   \n20  On February 11, 2021, Sergeant Smith brought an email to 3 North A Cluster Officers \n21  that had Chief Patti Jacksonโs name on it.  Id.  Plaintiff indicates the email discussed what \n22  officers were to do and said โmake sure officers flushed the toilets of empty cells.โ  Id.  Plaintiff \n23  indicates between February 2, 2021, and March 16, 2021, the officers did not adhere to \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 10 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 11 of 35\n \n1  Defendant Jacksonโs email and cleaning supplies were withheld due to Covid mandatory \n2  lockdown status.  Id.  Plaintiff indicates on March 11, 2021, another unit resident requested a \n3  grievance and Sergeant Miller came to ask what the problem was.  Id.  at 22.  Plaintiff indicates \n4  he and the other unit resident showed Sergeant Miller the issue of the backfilling toilets.  Id.  \n5  When the other unit resident asked for a grievance Sergeant Miller indicated he would contact \n6  maintenance first.  Id.   \n7  Plaintiffโs proposed second amended complaint alleges violations of the Eighth and \n8  Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, the Due Process Clause of the \n9  Washington State Constitution, as well as Washington state law claims of negligence and \n10  โministerial negligence.โ  Id.  25-26. \n11  As relief, Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief as well as actual, compensatory \n12  and punitive damages, costs, and any additional relief the Court deems just, proper and equitable.  \n13  Id. at 27.   \n14  DISCUSSION \n15  A.  Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Amend \n16  1.  Relevant Legal Standards \n17  a.  Motion to Dismiss \n18  A motion to dismiss can be granted only if Plaintiffโs complaint, with all factual \n19  allegations accepted as true, fails to โraise a right to relief above the speculative level[.]โ  Bell \n20  Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 545 (2007).  \n21  To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, \naccepted as true, to โstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.โ A claim has \n22  facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to \ndraw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. \nThe plausibility standard is not akin to a probability requirement, but it asks for more \n23 \nthan a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. \n \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 11 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 12 of 35\n \n1  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556, 570). \n2  A complaint must contain a โshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the \n3  pleader is entitled to relief.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  โSpecific facts are not necessary; the \n4  statement need only give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon \n5  which it rests.โ  Erickson v. Pardus, et al., 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007) (internal citations omitted). \n6  However, the pleading must be more than an โunadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me \n7  accusation.โ  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  The Court does not have to accept a โlegal conclusion \n8  couched as a factual allegation.โ  Id.  โThreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, \n9  supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.โ  Id.; Jones v. Community Development \n10  Agency, 733 F.2d 646, 649 (9th Cir. 1984) (vague and mere conclusory allegations unsupported \n11  by facts are not sufficient to state section 1983 claims); Pena v. Gardner, 976 F.2d 469, 471 (9th \n12  Cir. 1992).   \n13  When ruling on a motion to dismiss, the court โaccept[s] all factual allegations in the \n14  complaint as true and constru[es] them in the light most favorable to \n15  the nonmoving party.โ  Fields v. Twitter, 881 F.3d 739, 743 (9th Cir. 2018).  Furthermore, in \n16  general, pro se pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than those drafted by attorneys and \n17  the court is obligated, particularly in civil rights cases, to construe such pleadings liberally and \n18  afford the pro se party any benefit of the doubt.  See Garmon v. County of Los Angeles, 828 F.3d \n19  837, 846 (9th Cir. 2016); Bretz v. Kelman, 773 F.2d 1026, 1027 n. 1 (9th Cir. 1985) (en banc). \n20  That said, the courtโs liberal construction of a pro se complaint may not supply essential \n21  elements of the claim that were not pled.  Ivey v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Alaska, 673 F.2d 266, \n22  268 (9th Cir. 1982).  \n23     \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 12 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 13 of 35\n \n1   \n2  b.  Motion to Amend \n3  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), at this point in the litigation, a Plaintiff โmay amend \n4  [his] pleading only by leave of the court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave \n5  shall be freely given when justice so requires.โ  In determining whether to allow an amendment \n6  to a complaint Courts consider the following factors: โthe presence or absence of undue delay, \n7  bad faith, dilatory motive, undue prejudice to the opposing party, and futility of the proposed \n8  amendment.โ  Moore v. Kayport Package Express, Inc., 885 F.2d 531, 538 (9th Cir. 1989).   \n9  โPrejudice is the touchstone of the inquiry under rule 15(a) ... Absent prejudice, or a \n10  strong showing of any of the remaining [above] factors, there exists a presumption under Rule \n11  15(a) in favor of granting leave to amend.โ  Eminence Capital, LLC v. Aspeon, Inc., 316 F.3d \n12  1048, 1052 (9th Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \n13  โThe party opposing [the] amendment bears the burden of showing prejudice, unfair delay, bad \n14  faith, or futility of amendment.โ  United Steel, Paper & Forestry, Rubber, Mfg., Energy, Allied \n15  Indus. & Serv. Workers Int'l Union, AFL-CIO, CLC v. ConocoPhillips Co., 2009 WL 650730, at \n16  *2 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 12, 2009) (citing Eminence Capital, 316 F.3d at 1052; DCD Programs, Ltd. \n17  v. Leighton, 833 F.2d 183, 186-87 (9th Cir. 1987)).  Undue delay alone is generally insufficient \n18  to justify denying a motion to amend under Rule 15.  See Bowles v. Reade, 198 F.3d 752, 758 \n19  (9th Cir. 1999).  Further, โ[a] proposed amendment is futile only if no set of facts can be proved \n20  under the amendment to the pleading that would constitute a valid and sufficient claim or \n21  defense.โ  Miller v. Rykoff-Sexton, Inc., 845 F.2d 209, 214 (9th Cir. 1988) (abrogated on other \n22  grounds by Ashcroft v.

Conditions of Confinement - Eighth Amendment \n3  The Eighth Amendmentโs prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment protects \n4  prisoners from inhumane conditions of confinement.  Morgan v. Morgensen, 465 F.3d 1041, \n5  1045 (9th Cir. 2006).  Prison officials therefore have a โduty to ensure that prisoners are \n6  provided adequate shelter, food, clothing, sanitation, medical care, and personal safety.โ  \n7  Johnson v. Lewis, 217 F.3d 726, 731 (9th Cir. 2000) (citations omitted).  To establish a violation \n8  of this duty, a prisoner must show that he was subjected to an objectively serious deprivation that \n9  amounts to a denial of โthe minimal civilized measure of lifeโs necessities.โ  Farmer v. Brennan, \n10  511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994) (quoting Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 346 (1981)).  A prisoner \n11  must also show that prison officials acted with sufficiently culpable states of mind in failing to \n12  satisfy their duties.  Id.  Prison officials must have acted with deliberate indifference.  Id.  A \n13  prison official is liable under the Eighth Amendment only if he or she โknows of and disregards \n14  an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which \n15  the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he [or she] must \n16  also draw the inference.โ  Id. at 837 \n17  d.  Conditions of Confinement โ Fourteenth Amendment \n18  In contrast to post-conviction prisoners, pretrial detainees have the right to be free from \n19  punishment under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 533 (1979).  In \n20  assessing conditions of confinement for pretrial detainees, the Court considers whether the \n21  conditions amount to punishment, causing harm or disability significantly exceeding or \n22  independent of the inherent discomforts of confinement, or whether they merely result from \n23  some legitimate governmental purpose.  See Doe v. Kelly, 878 F.3d 710, 714, 720 (9th Cir. \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 14 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 15 of 35\n \n1  2017).  The Court evaluates a pretrial detaineeโs Fourteenth Amendment claim under an \n2  objective deliberate indifference standard.  See Gordon v. County of Orange, 888 F.3d 1118, \n3  1124-25 (9th Cir. 2018) (applying objective standard to medical care claims and describing \n4  similar treatment afforded medical care and other conditions of confinement claims) (citing \n5  Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 576 U.S. 389, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2475, 192 L. Ed. 2d 416 (2015), and \n6  Castro v. County of Los Angeles, 833 F.3d 1060, 1070 (9th Cir. 2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. \n7  831, 97 L. Ed. 2d 69 (2017)).4   \n8  A pretrial detainee must demonstrate a defendantโs acts or omissions were objectively \n9  unreasonable, and identify objective facts indicating the โchallenged governmental action is not \n10  rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective or that it is excessive in relation to that \n11  [objective].โ  Kingsley, 576 U.S. at 398.  The elements of a pretrial detaineeโs claim against an \n12  individual defendant under the objective deliberate indifference standard are as follows:  \n13  (i) the defendant made an intentional decision with respect to the conditions under which \nthe plaintiff was confined; (ii) those conditions put the plaintiff at substantial risk of \n14  suffering serious harm; (iii) the defendant did not take reasonable available measures to \nabate that risk, even though a reasonable official in the circumstances would have \nappreciated the high degree of risk involvedโmaking the consequences of the \n15 \ndefendantโs conduct obvious; and (iv) by not taking such measures, the defendant caused \nthe plaintiffโs injuries. \n16 \n \nId. at 1125.  โWith respect to the third element, the defendantโs conduct must be objectively \n17 \nunreasonable, a test that will necessarily โturn[ ] on the facts and circumstances of each particular \n18 \n19 \n \n20 \n4 Previously, โall conditions of confinement claims, including claims for inadequate medical care, were \nanalyzed under a subjective deliberate indifference standard whether brought by a convicted prisoner \n21 \nunder the Eighth Amendment or pretrial detainee under the Fourteenth Amendment.โ  Gordon, 888 F.3d \nat 1122-23 (citing Clouthier v. County of Contra Costa, 591 F.3d 1232, 1242-43 (9th Cir. 2010)).  \n22 \nAlthough the Ninth Circuit has not expressly extended the objective deliberate indifference standard to all \npretrial detainee conditions of confinement claims beyond a denial of medical care, failure-to-protect, and \n23  excessive force claims, the decision in Gordon strongly suggests it will do so.  See Gordon, 888 F.3d at \n1120, 1124, and 1124 n.2 (citing Darnell v. Pineiro, 849 F.3d 17, 36 (2d Cir. 2017) (extending objective \n  deliberate indifference standard to all pretrial detainee conditions of confinement claims)). \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 15 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 16 of 35\n \n1  case.โโ  Id. (quoting Castro, 833 F.3d at 1071 (quoted sources omitted)).  The Ninth Circuit has \n2  explained that the objective deliberate indifference standard, \n3  differs from the inquiry under the Eighth Amendment which requires that the โprison \nofficial must subjectively have a sufficiently culpable state of mind.โ Id. at 1070โ71 \n4  (quoting Estate of Ford v. Ramirez-Palmer, 301 F.3d 1043, 1049 (9th Cir. 2002) \n(emphasis in original)). โA prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth \nAmendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the official \n5 \nknows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.โ Estate of Ford, 301 \nF.3d at 1050 (quoting Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 \n6 \nL.Ed.2d 811 (1994)).

Analysis \na.  Individual Capacity Federal Claims Against Defendants Sutherlin, \n10  Dobson, Herbison, Pearson, and Mastandrea \n \n11  The Court finds that, whether analyzed under the Eighth Amendment or Fourteenth \n12  Amendment standard, Plaintiff has set forth sufficient factual allegations in his proposed second \n13  amended complaint to state a federal constitutional claim against Defendants Sutherlin, Dobson, \n14  Herbison, Pearson, and Mastandrea in their individual capacities based upon the conditions of his \n15  confinement.  The Court notes that while it appears the claims in Plaintiffโs amended complaint \n16  were sufficient, even assuming some of those claims were insufficient, Defendants have failed to \n17  demonstrate that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim in his proposed second amended complaint, \n18  or that amendment of the complaint is futile.5   \n19  The Eighth Amendment requires that prisoners be provided with โadequate shelter, food, \n20  clothing, sanitation, medical care, and personal safety.โ  Johnson v. Lewis, 217 F.3d 726, 731 \n21  (9th Cir. 2000).  โThe circumstances, nature, and duration of a deprivation of [ ] necessities must \n22 \n \n23 \n5 The Court notes that Defendants do not appear to argue that any of the other factors support denial of the motion to \namend, nor does the Court find that these other factors (undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, or undue prejudice) \n  would support denial of leave to amend here. \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 16 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 17 of 35\n \n1  be considered in determining whether a constitutional violation has occurred.โ  Id.  The length of \n2  time a prisoner is subjected to the offensive condition, is a relevant factor to consider in \n3  determining whether it implicates constitutional protections.  See Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, \n4  686โ87, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978) (โA filthy, overcrowded cell and a diet of โgrueโ \n5  might be tolerable for a few days and intolerably cruel for weeks or months.โ); Cockcroft v. \n6  Kirkland, 548 F.Supp.2d 767, 775 (N.D. Cal., March 10, 2018) (โUsually, a more offensive \n7  condition will be of constitutional significance when it exists for even a short time, while a less \n8  offensive condition will be of constitutional significance only when it has existed for a much \n9  longer time.โ).  โUnquestionably, subjection of a prisoner to lack of sanitation that is severe or \n10  prolonged can constitute an infliction of pain within the meaning of the Eighth \n11  Amendment.โ  Anderson v. Cnty. of Kern, 45 F.3d 1310, 1314โ15 (9th Cir. 1995).  โThe failure \n12  to provide adequate cell cleaning supplies may also amount to unconstitutional punishment \n13  where that failure โseriously threatensโ the inmateโs health.โ  Moak v.

Moreover, under circumstances where โthe \n10  air [is] in fact saturated with the fumes of feces, urine, and vomit, it could undermine health and \n11  sanitation.โ  Keenan v.

He also alleges that, with a few exceptions, \n18  he was consistently denied cleaning supplies and that he was left to try to clean the area with his \n19  T-shirt.  He alleges he and other residents were forced to walk on contaminated floors with just \n20  socks and slippers and would thereafter pass the sewage from their socks to their beds.  He \n21  alleges the unit itself was saturated from the stench and fumes of raw sewage exploding out of \n22  ten sewage drainage pipes next to the cell doors, mosquitos and flies were seen coming from the \n23  sewage drains, and on one occasion dead mice were observed in the drainage pipes.  He alleges \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 18 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 19 of 35\n \n1  the constant odor of raw sewage caused himself and other residents to endure constant \n2  headaches, vomiting, diarrhea, inability to eat, that the conditions caused deterioration in his \n3  mental health, and that the regular exposure to human waste placed him at risk of contracting \n4  disease. \n5  Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot state a claim because he concedes he was given \n6  cleaning supplies on request and the conditions he describes are not sufficiently severe to violate \n7  the constitution.  Dkts. 33, 47.  The Court disagrees.  Plaintiffโs complaint makes clear that he \n8  only received cleaning supplies on a few occasions over the course of seven months, that the \n9  cleaning supplies provided were inadequate, and that the provision of these supplies on these \n10  occasions was an exception to the regular custom or practice of denying cleaning supplies.  \n11  Construing the allegations of the complaint in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, the Court \n12  concludes that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that he was subjected to an objectively serious \n13  deprivation that amounts to a denial of โthe minimal civilized measure of lifeโs necessitiesโ for \n14  purposes of stating a claim under even the Eighth Amendment standard.  He has also adequately \n15  alleged that the conditions were sufficiently serious to place him at substantial risk of serious \n16  harm, subjecting him to harm or disability significantly exceeding or independent of the inherent \n17  discomforts of confinement not rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective, for \n18  purposes of stating a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n19  Plaintiffโs proposed second amended complaint with respect to Defendants Sutherlin, \n20  Dobson, Herbison, Pearson, and Mastandrea also alleges sufficient facts to support a claim that \n21  these Defendants acted with deliberate indifference, whether analyzed under the subjective \n22  Eighth Amendment standard or the objective Fourteenth Amendment standard.   \n23 \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 19 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 20 of 35\n \n1  With respect to Defendants Sutherlin and Dobson, Plaintiff alleges he informed them of \n2  the conditions during formal inspections on four occasions over the course of several months. \n3  Plaintiff also informed Defendant Pearson of the conditions at three of the of those formal \n4  inspections.  Plaintiff also alleges he informed these Defendants that he was being denied \n5  cleaning supplies.  His allegations indicate these Defendants took no action to address the issues \n6  and in fact called the issue a โ30-year mistakeโ informing Plaintiff that Pierce County wouldnโt \n7  pay to address the issue so he would โjust have to deal with it.โ  Dkt. 53-2, at 12.  Plaintiff also \n8  alleges that at a subsequent formal inspection, these Defendants refused to allow Plaintiff to \n9  express his concerns about the plumbing issue, informed Plaintiff and other unit residents that \n10  Defendants were aware of the issue, that it was a construction issue that would not be addressed \n11  at that time, and that if anyone brought up the issue again disciplinary action would be taken.  \n12  Dkt. 53-2, at 15.  These allegations are sufficient to support a claim that these Defendants knew \n13  of and disregarded an excessive risk to inmate health or safety for purposes of the Eight \n14  Amendment and, by extension, are also sufficient to meet the objective deliberate indifference \n15  standard under the Fourteenth Amendment.  See, e.g., Fruit v. Norris, 905 F.2d 1147, 1150โ51 \n16  (8th Cir. 1990) (โโcommon senseโ suggests that [prison officials] should have had knowledge \n17  that unprotected contact with human waste could cause disease.โ) (internal citations omitted).   \n18  With respect to Defendant D. Herbison, Plaintiff alleges that corrections officer Starks \n19  and Defendant Herbison came to his cell in response to his kite requesting a grievance regarding \n20  the unsafe environment caused by the sewer.  Plaintiff informed them about the toilets \n21  overflowing, denial of cleaning supplies and constant odor of raw sewage and indicates that later \n22  that day corrections officer Starks told Plaintiff to dump buckets of water down the sewer pipes \n23  closets, a practice Plaintiff indicates does not resolve the problem.  Plaintiff indicates he received \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 20 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 21 of 35\n \n1  a response to his kite from Defendant Herbison saying that โOfficers are researching the issues. \n2  The deputies report โNothing Unusual.โโ and that he was never provided a grievance.  Viewing \n3  these allegations in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, given Plaintiffโs complaints about the \n4  severity of the ongoing sewer issue, the denial of cleaning supplies, and Plaintiffโs assertion that \n5  dumping water down the sewers did nothing to resolve the issue, it is reasonable to infer that \n6  Defendant Herbisonโs response to the kite that the deputies report โnothing unusualโ, reflects a \n7  decision to simply ignore or avoid the issue.  These allegations are sufficient to support a claim \n8  that Defendant Herbison knew of and disregarded an excessive risk to inmate health or safety for \n9  purposes of the Eight Amendment and, by extension, are also sufficient to meet the objective \n10  deliberate indifference standard under the Fourteenth Amendment.   \n11  With respect to Defendant Mastandrea, Plaintiff alleges he informed him of the \n12  conditions at the October 7, 2020, formal inspection along with Defendants Sutherlin, Dobson \n13  and Pearson, and received the response from those Defendants that Pierce County and the Jail \n14  were aware of the issue, that it was the way the plumbing was designed and would not be fixed at \n15  that time, and Plaintiff would just have to deal with it.  Dkt. 53-2 at 14.  Plaintiff also alleges that \n16  he filed a grievance dated December 16, 2020, in which he raised the following issues: his health \n17  concern about the unit toilets; that he had raised the issue at the last four inspections; that the \n18  toilets shoot out other inmateโs feces; that he has to eat in his cell with other peopleโs fecal \n19  matter splattered all over the toilet; that there is a smell throughout the whole unit; that he is \n20  forced to clean contaminated areas without proper PPE; being forced to wait hours for cleaning \n21  supplies; that inmates threaten each other (including himself) because of the plumbing; and \n22  requests that the unit residents be moved until the conditions are made compatible with living.  \n23  Dkt. 53-12 at 17.   \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 21 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 22 of 35\n \n1  Plaintiff indicates that thereafter, on December 18, 2020, a plumber named โJasonโ came \n2  and snaked the toilets and told Plaintiff the toilet wasnโt clogged.  Id.  Plaintiff states he \n3  explained the issue of the toilets backflushing and overflowing into the cell and that โJasonโ \n4  acknowledged the issue but said it was a โshitty situationโ but in order to fix it they would have \n5  to reconstruct the plumbing and that Pierce County would not fund it.  Id.  Plaintiff indicates that \n6  later that day he received a response to his grievance from Defendant Mastandrea stating that \n7  maintenance checked and snaked the toilets and that he had spoken to Plaintiff who indicated he \n8  was satisfied with maintenanceโs response and explanation.  Id. at 18.  But Plaintiff indicates he \n9  never spoke to Defendant Mastandrea and never said he was โsatisfiedโ with the response.  Id.  \n10  Plaintiff also indicates he filed an appeal indicating he had never spoken to Defendant \n11  Mastandrea, that he was not satisfied with the response, and also complaining that there was no \n12  response to his complaints about lack of cleaning supplies or the odors causing physical illness.  \n13  Id.  Plaintiff states that after handing his appeal to the cluster officer it was โnever seen againโ \n14  indicating it was either lost in the transfer or purposely rejected.  Id.   \n15  Construing the allegations of the proposed second amended complaint in the light most \n16  favorable to Plaintiff, the Court finds Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support a claim of \n17  deliberate indifference against Defendant Mastandrea.  Plaintiff alleges Defendant Mastandrea \n18  was present at the October 7, 2020, formal inspection where Plaintiff indicates he was informed \n19  by the Jail officials present (namely Defendants Sutherlin, Dobson, Pearson and Mastandrea) that \n20  Pierce County and the Jail were aware of the issue and that it was a structural issue with the \n21  plumbing that would not be fixed at that time.  Based upon these allegations it can be reasonably \n22  inferred that Defendant Mastandrea was already aware that the nature of the plumbing issue was \n23  structural and not a clogged toilet that could be resolved by โsnakingโ it.  Furthermore, Plaintiff \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 22 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 23 of 35\n \n1  alleges Defendant Mastandrea never actually spoke to him and Plaintiff never told him the issue \n2  was resolved.  The Court finds it can be reasonably inferred from the allegations of the proposed \n3  second amended complaint that Defendant Mastandrea knew that having the plumber snake the \n4  toilets would not resolve the issue and thus his actions in sending a plumber were not a \n5  legitimate effort to address the problem.  Furthermore, Defendant Mastandreaโs alleged failure to \n6  speak to Plaintiff after the fact but instead claiming he had done so and closing the grievance can \n7  be reasonably interpreted as a decision to simply ignore the issue.  The Court also notes that it \n8  appears Defendant Mastandrea never responded to Plaintiffโs complaint regarding cleaning \n9  supplies.  These allegations are sufficient to support a claim that Defendant Mastandrea knew of \n10  and disregarded an excessive risk to inmate health or safety for purposes of the Eight \n11  Amendment and, by extension, are also sufficient to meet the objective deliberate indifference \n12  standard under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n13  In sum, the Court finds that, whether analyzed under the Eighth Amendment or \n14  Fourteenth Amendment standard, Plaintiff has sufficiently stated a claim in his proposed second \n15  amended complaint against Defendants Sutherlin, Dobson, Herbison, Pearson, and Mastandrea \n16  based upon the conditions of his confinement.  Accordingly, the Court recommends that, with \n17  respect to the individual capacity federal claims against these Defendants, Defendantsโ motion to \n18  dismiss should denied and Plaintiffโs motion to amend should be granted. \n19  b.  Individual Capacity Federal Claims Against Defendants Patti Jackson and \nEd Troyer \n20   \nWith respect to the individual capacity federal constitutional claims against Defendants \n21 \nPatti Jackson and Ed Troyer, the Court finds that Defendants have shown that Plaintiff fails to \n22 \nstate a claim either in his amended complaint or his proposed second amended complaint \n23 \nwhether analyzed under the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment standard.  As such, Defendantsโ \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 23 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 24 of 35\n \n1  motion to dismiss should be granted and Plaintiffโs motion to amend denied as futile with respect \n2  to the individual capacity federal constitutional claims against Defendants Patti Jackson and Ed \n3  Troyer.   \n4  In order to state a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, a plaintiff must show: (1) he \n5  suffered a violation of rights protected by the Constitution or created by federal statute, and (2) \n6  the violation was proximately caused by a person acting under color of state law.  See Crumpton \n7  v. Gates, 947 F.2d 1418, 1420 (9th Cir. 1991).  The first step in a ยง 1983 claim is therefore to \n8  identify the specific constitutional right allegedly infringed.  Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, \n9  271 (1994).  \n10  To satisfy the second prong, a plaintiff must allege facts showing how individually \n11  named defendants caused, or personally participated in causing, the harm alleged in the \n12  complaint.  See Leer v. Murphy, 844 F.2d 628, 633 (9th Cir. 1988); Arnold v. IBM, 637 F.2d \n13  1350, 1355 (9th Cir. 1981).  A person subjects another to a deprivation of a constitutional right \n14  when committing an affirmative act, participating in anotherโs affirmative act, or omitting to \n15  perform an act which is legally required.  Johnson v. Duffy, 588 F.2d 740, 743 (9th Cir. 1978). \n16  Sweeping conclusory allegations against an official are insufficient to state a claim for relief.  Leer, \n17  844 F.2d at 633.  Further, a ยง 1983 suit cannot be based on vicarious liability alone, but must allege \n18  the defendantโs own conduct violated the plaintiffโs civil rights.  City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. \n19  378, 385-90 (1989).  Thus, โ[a] supervisor is only liable for the constitutional violations of โฆ \n20  subordinates if the supervisor participated in or directed the violations, or knew of the violations \n21  and failed to act to prevent them.โ  Taylor v. List, 880 F.2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir. 1989) (citations \n22  omitted) \n23 \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 24 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 25 of 35\n \n1  โA showing that a supervisor acted, or failed to act, in a manner that was deliberately \n2  indifferent to an inmateโs Eighth Amendment rights is sufficient to demonstrate the involvement \n3  โ and the liability โ of that supervisor.  Thus, when a supervisor is found liable based on \n4  deliberate indifference, the supervisor is being held liable for his or her own culpable action or \n5  inaction, not held vicariously liable for the culpable action or inaction of his or her \n6  subordinates.โ  Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1207 (9th Cir. 2011) (holding that โa plaintiff may \n7  state a claim against a supervisor for deliberate indifference based upon the supervisorโs \n8  knowledge of and acquiescence in unconstitutional conduct by his or her subordinatesโ). \n9  Here, Plaintiffโs individual capacity federal claims against Defendants Jackson and \nTroyer in both the amended complaint and proposed second amended complaint appear to be \n10 \nbased primarily upon the theory of vicarious liability.  Specifically, Plaintiff alleges Defendant \n11 \nTroyer,  \n12 \n[i]s and was the Sheriff of Pierce County, and in that Capacity is and was Responsible for \n13 \nestablishing or Failing To Establish the Policies, Practices, and Regulations for the \nconduct of the Pierce County Sheriff Department and its Employees.   \n14 \nDefendant โฆ Troyer is and was Responsible for the hiring, training, supervision, \ndiscipline, and control of all members of the Pierce County Sheriffโs department.  \n15 \nDefendant County Sheriff is and was the Commanding Officer of the other Police \npersonnel named herein as individual Defendants. \n16  [โฆ] \nDefendant County Sheriff has a Constitutional and Statutory responsibility for the \n17  Conditions and Practices of the Pierce County Jail Facility and โฆ is responsible for \nmaintaining the Jail facility in conformity with Constitutional requisites.  Defendant โฆ is \nalso Custodian of the Jail Facility, responsible for the Neglect and Omission of the duties \n18 \nof all Deputy Sheriffs and Corrections Officers, and Charged with Furnishing necessary \nSanitation, Bedding, Clothing, Medical Aid, and Mental Health Social Workers for all \n19 \npersons detained in the Jail Facility.   \nIn addition, Defendant โฆ is and was responsible for ensuring that the Deputy Sheriff and \n20 \nCorrections Officers of Pierce County Sheriff Dept. Obeyed regulations of the Pierce \nCounty Sheriffโs Department, the Ordinance and Law of Pierce County, and the Laws \n21  and Constitution of the State of Washington and the United States. \nDefendant โฆ is and was Responsible for the Establishment, Policies, Procedures and \n22  guidelines for the Arrest, Jailing and Safe Keeping of Pre-trial Detainees.  \n \n23  Dkt. 53-2, at 7.  Plaintiff alleges, \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 25 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 26 of 35\n \n1  Defendant Jackson is and was the Chief of the Internal Operation of the Sheriff Dept. \nCorrection Bureau, and in that Capacity, is and was Constitutionally and Statutorily \n2  responsible also for the Training, Supervision, Discipline, and Control of all Deputy \nCorrection Officers, as well as the Operation, Practices, and Totality of Conditions of the \nPierce County Jail Facility.  Defendant Chief has Statutory Responsibility also for \n3 \nensuring that the Pierce County Jail Facility conforms to the requirements of State Law, \nand the Laws and Constitution of the United States.  In addition, defendant Chief is and \n4 \nwas Responsible for the establishment of Policies, procedures, and Guidelines for the \nArrest, Jailing, and Safe Keeping of Pre-Trial detainees housed in the Pierce County Jail \n5 \nFacility.  \n \n6  Dkt. 53-2, at 8.   \n7  Plaintiff fails to allege sufficient facts to show Defendants Troyer and Jackson were \n8  personally aware of the plumbing and sewer issue or what specific actions or inactions by these \n9  Defendants constituted deliberate indifference.  With respect to Defendant Jackson, Plaintiff \n10  does allude to the existence of an email with her name on it that discussed flushing the toilets in \n11  the empty cells in the unit.  But Plaintiff provides no facts to indicate what issue the instruction \n12  in the email was intended to address, or to indicate that Defendant Jackson was personally aware \n13  of the nature or extent of the conditions Plaintiff alleges in his proposed second amended \n14  complaint.  As such, Plaintiffโs conclusory allegations are insufficient to show these Defendants \n15  personally participated in the alleged constitutional violations.  See Jones v. Community \n16  Development Agency, 733 F.2d 646, 649 (9th Cir. 1984) (vague and mere conclusory allegations \n17  unsupported by facts are not sufficient to state section 1983 claims).  \n18  Accordingly, the Court recommends that, with respect to the individual capacity federal \n19  claims against Defendants Troyer and Jackson, Defendantsโ motion to dismiss should granted, \n20  Plaintiffโs motion to amend should be denied, and these claims should be dismissed without \n21  prejudice. \n22  c.  Federal Claims Against Pierce County \n23  With respect to Defendant Pierce County, Plaintiff alleges he was informed repeatedly by \n  Jail officials, including several of the individual Defendants, that Pierce County was aware of the \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 26 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 27 of 35\n \n1  plumbing conditions at the Jail and that they would not be fixing anything at that time.  The \n2  Court finds that, whether analyzed under the Eighth Amendment or Fourteenth Amendment \n3  standard, Plaintiff has set forth sufficient factual allegations in his proposed second amended \n4  complaint to state a claim against Defendant Pierce County, based upon the conditions of his \n5  confinement.  The Court notes that while it appears the claims in Plaintiffโs amended complaint \n6  against Defendant Pierce County were sufficient, even assuming some of those claims were \n7  insufficient, Defendants have failed to demonstrate that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim in his \n8  proposed second amended complaint, or that amendment of the complaint is futile.6   \n9  A local governmental unit may not be held responsible for the acts of its employees under \n10  a respondeat superior theory of liability.  See Bd. of Cty. Commโrs v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 403 \n11  (1997); Monell v. Depโt of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 691 (1978).  โTo [prevail on a claim against \n12  a municipal entity for a constitutional violation], a plaintiff must go beyond the respondeat \n13  superior theory of liability and demonstrate that the alleged constitutional deprivation was the \n14  product of a policy or custom of the local governmental unit.โ  Kirkpatrick v. Cty. of Washoe, \n15  843 F.3d 784, 793 (9th Cir. 2016) (en banc).  Municipal liability must rest on the actions of the \n16  municipality, and not the actions of its employees.  See Brown, 520 U.S. at 403; Monell, 436 \n17  U.S. at 690โ91; Fogel, 531 F.3d at 834.  โMunicipal liability may be premised upon: (1) conduct \n18  pursuant to an expressly adopted official policy; (2) a longstanding practice or custom which \n19  constitutes the โstandard operating procedureโ of the local government entity; (3) a decision of a \n20  decision-making official who was, as a matter of law, a final policymaking authority whose \n21  edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy in the area of decision; or (4) an \n22 \n \n23 \n6 The Court notes that Defendants again do not appear to argue that any of the other factors support denial of the \nmotion to amend, nor does the Court find that these other factors (undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, or undue \n  prejudice) would support denial of leave to amend here. \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 27 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 28 of 35\n \n1  official with final policymaking authority either delegating that authority to, or ratifying the \n2  decision of, a subordinate.โ  Young v. City of Visalia, 687 F.Supp.2d 1141, 1147 (E.D.Cal. 2009) \n3  (internal citations omitted).   \n4  A โcustomโ for purposes of municipal liability is a โwidespread practice that, although \n5  not authorized by written law or express municipal policy, is so permanent and well-settled as to \n6  constitute a custom or usage with the force of law.โ  See City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. \n7  112, 127, 108 S.Ct. 915, 99 L.Ed.2d 107 (1988); L.A. Police Protective League v. Gates, 907 \n8  F.2d 879, 890 (9th Cir. 1990).  Allegations of random acts, or single instances of misconduct, \n9  however, are insufficient to establish a municipal custom.  See Navarro v. Block, 72 F.3d 712, \n10  714 (9th Cir. 1996).  Liability โmust be founded upon practices of sufficient duration, frequency \n11  and consistency that the conduct has become a traditional method of carrying out \n12  policy.โ  Trevino v. Gates, 99 F.3d 911, 918 (9th Cir. 1996); see also McDade v. West, 223 F.3d \n13  1135, 1141 (9th Cir. 2000).  Once the plaintiff has demonstrated that a custom existed, a \n14  โmunicipality may be liable for its custom โirrespective of whether official policymakers had \n15  actual knowledge of the practice at issue.โโ  Navarro v. Block, 72 F.3d 712, 714โ15 (9th Cir. \n16  1995) (quoting Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1444 (9th Cir.1989)); but \n17  see Blair v. City of Pomona, 223 F.3d 1074, 1080 (9th Cir. 2000) (โopen to the [municipality] to \n18  show that the custom was not known to the policy-makersโ).  A plaintiff โmust show that the \n19  challenged municipal conduct was both the cause in fact and the proximate cause of the \n20  constitutional deprivation.โ  Young, 687 F.Supp.2d at 1148. \n21  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Pierce County violated Eighth and Fourteenth \n22  Amendment constitutional standards by subjecting him to a severe and persistent backflushing \n23  problem and other sewer issues at Pierce County Jail and refusing to provide him with cleaning \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 28 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 29 of 35\n \n1  supplies to clean and sanitize areas contaminated by wastewater.  Construing the allegations in \n2  the light most favorable to Plaintiff, he has sufficiently alleged that Defendant Pierce County \n3  maintained a custom of allowing the backflushing and sewer issue to continue and refusing to \n4  provide cleaning supplies.  \n5  Plaintiff alleges that he was incarcerated in the 3 North A unit for approximately seven \n6  months and that throughout this time there was a backflushing problem such that when the \n7  inmates in other cells flushed their toilet the waste would backflush into the toilet in Plaintiffโs \n8  cell and that the wastewater would often splash onto the seat of his toilet or onto the floor of his \n9  cell.  Plaintiff claims that he and other inmates were denied cleaning supplies to sanitize the area \n10  contaminated by the backflushing and that he had to clean the contaminated areas of his cell with \n11  his own T-shirt. \n12  Plaintiff alleges that he asked various Jail officials, including several individually named \n13  Defendants, on numerous occasions to fix the plumbing issue, but that they responded that the \n14  issue was structural, that Pierce County was aware of the issue and that it would not be fixed at \n15  that time, and that Plaintiff would just have to deal with it.   As discussed above, as is the case \n16  here, โa backflushing problem, at least when accompanied by a refusal to provide cleaning \n17  supplies โฆ, amounts to a violation of Eighth Amendment principles.โ  Bodnar, 2014 WL \n18  2737815, at *7โ9, report and recommendation adopted, 2014 WL 2741070; Cockcroft, 548 \n19  F.Supp.2d at 774โ76.  \n20  Plaintiff contends that the backflushing and sanitation problems were the result of a \n21  custom or municipal policy.  The Court finds Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support a \n22  claim that Defendant Pierce County maintained a custom of allowing the backflushing problem \n23  while denying cleaning supplies.  Specifically, Plaintiff has presented evidence that this was a \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 29 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 30 of 35\n \n1  prolonged issue at Pierce County Jail, that many inmates were aware of the problem and \n2  complained, and that each member of the staff notified of the problem did essentially nothing to \n3  remedy the situation (or at least nothing legitimately intended to resolve it) and that Plaintiff was \n4  consistently denied cleaning supplies when he requested them.  In fact, according to Plaintiff, \n5  several Jail officials, including several individually named Defendants, acknowledged that this \n6  was a โ30-year old problemโ, that Pierce County would not fix it at that time, and the unit \n7  residents would โjust have to deal with it.โ  Plaintiff further alleges that he was informed by Jail \n8  officials that cleaning supplies were not a policy but a โprivilegeโ for the cluster officers to give \n9  at their disposal and that he was informed on another occasion that Pierce County had no specific \n10  policy requiring the provision of cleaning supplies to inmates.  Id.  Plaintiff has alleged sufficient \n11  facts to support a claim that it was the custom to deny cleaning supplies when requested by unit \n12  residents.  The Court finds these allegations are sufficient to indicate that Defendant maintained \n13  a โwidespread practice that, although not authorized by written law or express municipal policy, \n14  is so permanent and well settled as to constitute a custom or usage with the force of \n15  law.โ  Praprotnik, 485 U.S. at 127.  Plaintiff has also sufficiently alleged that this custom was \n16  the cause-in-fact and legal cause of the alleged constitutional deprivation.   \n17  In sum, the Court finds that, whether analyzed under the Eighth Amendment or \n18  Fourteenth Amendment standard, Plaintiff has sufficiently stated a claim in his proposed second \n19  amended complaint against Defendant Pierce County based upon the conditions of his \n20  confinement.  Accordingly, the Court recommends that, with respect to the federal claims against \n21  Defendant Pierce County, Defendantsโ motion to dismiss should denied and Plaintiffโs motion to \n22  amend should be granted. \n23  d.  Official Capacity Claims against All Defendants \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 30 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 31 of 35\n \n1  Plaintiff also sues all non-entity Defendants in their official capacities.  An action against \n2  a municipal officer in an official capacity is equivalent to an action against the local government \n3  entity.  See Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165-66 (1985) (โOfficial-capacity suits... \n4  โgenerally represent only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer \n5  is an agent.โโ) (quoting Monell, 436 U.S. at 690 n.55); Larez v. City of Los Angeles, 946 F.2d \n6  630, 646 (9th Cir. 1991) (โA suit against a governmental officer in his official capacity is \n7  equivalent to a suit against the government entity itself.โ).  In their motion to dismiss, \n8  Defendants argue that Plaintiff has failed to establish that a policy of the local government entity, \n9  Pierce County, caused the constitutional deprivation.  Dkt. 33, at 9-10.  However, as discussed \nabove, the Court has separately concluded that Plaintiff has, in fact, alleged sufficient facts to \n10 \nproceed with his federal claims against the local entity, Pierce County.  Specifically, the Court \n11 \nhas concluded that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that Pierce County maintained a custom of \n12 \nallowing the backflushing and sewer issue to continue and refusing to provide cleaning supplies, \n13 \nand that this was the cause of the constitutional deprivation Plaintiff alleges.   \n14 \nIn the absence of any other specific substantive arguments made by Defendants with \n15 \nrespect to Plaintiffโs official capacity claims, the Court finds that Plaintiff has arguably stated \n16 \nenough facts to go forward with these claims against all individual Defendants at this time, and \n17 \nthe Court cannot conclude that inclusion of these claims in the second amended complaint would \n18 \nbe futile.7  \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n \n23 \n7 The Court notes that Defendants again do not appear to argue that any of the other factors support denial of the \nmotion to amend, nor does the Court find that these other factors (undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, or undue \n  prejudice) would support denial of leave to amend here. \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 31 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 32 of 35\n \n1  Accordingly, the Court recommends that Defendantsโ motion to dismiss be denied and \n2  Plaintiffโs motion to amend be granted with respect to his official capacity claims against all \n3  individual Defendants. \n4  e.  State Law Claims against All Defendants \n5  Plaintiffโs proposed second amended complaint also alleges new state law claims of \n6  negligence, โministerial negligenceโ, and violation of the Washington State Constitution, against \n7  all Defendants.  These claims were not included in Plaintiffโs amended complaint and, as such, \n8  Defendants did not address them in their motion to dismiss which was directed to the amended \n9  complaint.  Defendants oppose Plaintiffโs motion to amend to include these claims in the \nproposed second amended complaint but do so only in a conclusory fashion, primarily based on \n10 \ntheir position that Plaintiff has failed to state a federal constitutional violation (which the Court \n11 \nhas largely rejected), and without addressing the specific requirements necessary to state a claim \n12 \nwith respect to these state law claims.  In the absence of any substantive or non-conclusory \n13 \narguments made by Defendants with respect to Plaintiffโs state law claims in opposing Plaintiffโs \n14 \nmotion to amend, the Court cannot conclude that inclusion of Plaintiffโs state law claims would \n15 \nbe futile8 and finds that Plaintiff has arguably stated enough facts to go forward with his state \n16 \nlaw claims against all Defendants at this time.   \n17 \nAccordingly, the Court recommends that Plaintiffโs motion to amend be granted with \n18 \nrespect to his state law claims against all Defendants. \n19 \n// \n20 \n// \n21 \n22 \n \n23 \n8 The Court notes that Defendants again do not appear to argue that any of the other factors support denial of the \nmotion to amend, nor does the Court find that these other factors (undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, or undue \n  prejudice) would support denial of leave to amend here. \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 32 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 33 of 35\n \n1  B.  Motion to Change Venue \n2  Defendants also move to change venue to the Tacoma division of the U.S. District Court \n3  for the Western District of Washington.  Dkt. 33. \n4  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1404(a), a district court may transfer an action to \n5  a different district or division โ[f]or the convenience of parties and witnessesโ and โin the \n6  interest of justice,โ so long as the action could have been filed in the transferee district or \n7  division in the first instance.  28 U.S.C. ยง 1404(a); see Sparling v. Hoffman Construction \n8  Company, Inc., 864 F.2d 635, 639 (9th Cir. 1988) (citing id.) (quotation marks omitted).  \n9  District courts have โbroad discretionโ in deciding whether to grant a Section 1404(a) motion to \n10  transfer venue.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Savage, 611 F.2d 270, 279 (9th Cir. \n11  1979).  The moving party bears the burden to establish that a venue transfer โwill allow a case to \n12  proceed more conveniently and better serve the interests of justice.โ  Rubio v. Monsanto Co., 181 \n13  F. Supp. 3d 746, 759-60 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 24, 2016); Hunter v. Haar, No. CV 14-9886 R(JC), \n14  2016 WL 11520384, at *1 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 7, 2016). \n15  The Court first notes that this case was filed as and is still designated a Tacoma division \n16  case but was assigned by the courtโs random district-wide assignment procedures to a Seattle \n17  District Court Judge and Magistrate Judge.  The assignment of a Tacoma division case to Seattle \n18  judges, in and of itself, would not appear to serve as a valid basis for a motion to change venue.  \n19  Even if it did, Defendants fail to show at this juncture that traveling the approximately 35 miles \n20  to the Seattle Courthouse, in the event the parties were required to personally appear for a \n21  proceeding, would significantly inconvenience to the parties or witnesses, or would otherwise \n22  implicate interests of justice concerns.  The Court also notes that there are no proceedings \n23  currently scheduled that require the physical appearance of any of the parties nor is it clear at this \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 33 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 66     Filed 03/10/22     Page 34 of 35\n \n1  point whether and when any such in-person proceedings may be required in the future.  Thus, \n2  any specific concerns about any asserted hardship in traveling to Seattle are better raised at a \n3  point in time where such travel might, in fact, be required.   \n4  Accordingly, Plaintiff's motion to change venue (Dkt. 33) should be denied. \n5  CONCLUSION \n6  The Court recommends that Defendantsโ motion to dismiss (Dkts. 33, 47) and Plaintiffโs \n7  motion for leave to file a second amended complaint (Dkt. 53) be GRANTED IN PART and \n8  DENIED IN PART.  Specifically, with respect to the individual capacity federal constitutional \n9  claims against Defendants Sutherlin, Dobson, Herbison, Pearson, and Mastandrea, Defendantsโ \n10  motion to dismiss (Dkts. 33, 47) should be DENIED and Plaintiffโs motion to amend (Dkt. 53) \n11  should be GRANTED.  With respect to the individual capacity federal constitutional claims \n12  against Defendants Patti Jackson and Ed Troyer, Defendantsโ motion to dismiss (Dkts. 33, 47) \n13  should be GRANTED, Plaintiffโs motion to amend (Dkt. 53) should be DENIED, and these \n14  claims should be DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.  With respect to the federal \n15  constitutional claims against Defendant Pierce County, Defendantsโ motion to dismiss (Dkts. 33, \n16  47) should be DENIED and Plaintiffโs motion to amend (Dkt. 53) should be GRANTED.  With \n17  respect to Plaintiffโs official capacity claims against all individual Defendants, Defendantsโ \n18  motion to dismiss (Dkts. 33, 47) should be DENIED and Plaintiffโs motion to amend (Dkt. 53) \n19  should be GRANTED.  And, with respect to Plaintiffโs state law claims against all Defendants, \n20  Plaintiffโs motion to amend (Dkt. 53) should be GRANTED.  The Court further recommends that \n21  Defendantsโ motion to change venue (Dkt. 33) be DENIED.

Eighth Amendment Prohibition Against Cruel and Unusual Punishment.\n8. Negligence and Ministerial Negligence\nFacts\n1.2) On May 12th, 2020, Plaintiff Davey was Re-Classified from Level 2 Mental Health Housing Unit (3\nNorth C)to Level 3 Mental Health Housing Unit (3 North A).\n3 North A Unit is not a Solitary Confinement Housing unit where violent Criminals go for Disciplinary\nAction. The Unit is a place where Pierce County Places its most vulnerable Clients (the Mentally lll),\nmostly those waiting for competency evaluations.\n1.3) The Following Classification are those related to Pierce County Jail\nr  Level t high\n. \nLevel 2 close custody\n. \nLevel3 high medium\n. \nLevel4 medium\n. \nLevel 5 medium presentence\n. \nLevel 6 minimum\n. \nLevel 7 low minimum\n. \nLevel 8 very low minimum\n1.4) Plaintiff Davey was informed on May !21h,2020, by Mental Health SocialWorkers, that his good\nbehavior had resulted in the Jail Classifying him from level 2 Closed Custody to Level 3 High/Medium\nCustody. The move was supposed to be in some way a better living condition than those in closed\ncustody.\n1.5) Upon arriving in 3 North A (Mental Health Housing) Cell \"20f27\" l, Davey noticed that the Cell was\nin a very \"Dangerous\" Condition; There was dried Human Waste in and on the toilet seat, vomit, spit,\ndried mucus and food all over the floor.\nThe Stench of sitting urine and feces was extremely nauseating.\n1,6) I was given a Spray bottle, but I was denied Proper P.P.E. (Gloves, Rags) and I was also denied a\nchange of clothes when attempting to clean the \"toilet\" (with toilet paper) \"bodily waste\" splashed onto\nMy Clothes. Having to use toilet paper to wipe the human waste from my toilet area without gloves\ncaused me to get feces on my hands.\nI was forced to wear clothes with Human Waste on them until the next Unit Clothing exchange,\nThursday May 14th, 2o2O (2 Days).\n1.7) After falling asleep the night of May 12th,2Q2O,l woke up to Breakfast around 4:30AM on May 1-3th,\n2020, and was given my meal through a slot in the Cell Door.\n1.8) I noticed that the cell smelled of Urine and Feces and I also noticed that the toilet was once again\nfull of wet and dried human waste and the surrounding area on the floor and wall had splashes of what\nappeared to be Human Waste from the toilet.\nI immediately felt sick and could not eat My breakfast.\nP.5\n\n7\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 81     Filed 07/15/22     Page 11 of 28\n1.9) When officers returned to pick up the Breakfast tray I requested cleaning supplies, but I was denied,\nbeing told that, \"Cleaning Supplies are not handed out during Grave-Yard hours.\" (l used my Pink Jail\nissued under garment T-Shirt to clean the area)\n1.X.0) Later that morning, May !3th, 2A2O,l noticed that urine and feces, \"Sewage\" was Back-Filling into\nthe cell \"Davey's\" toilet from the Cell next to mine and possibly from the floor above.\n1.11) lt seemed at the time that every time the adjoining cell flushed the toilet, Raw Sewage would\nBack-Up in the toilets, nearly overflowing our rims and splashing on the wall and floors. (This Happened\n10-15 times daily)\n1.12) At around 8:30 am on May 13th, 2020, (Formal lnspection Day) I had told the Captain and\nLieutenant about the condition that my cell had been in when I was placed in the unit the day before, I\nalso brought them into the cell and showed them that our bodily fluids were not leaving the unit but\nthat when someone uses the restroom in the adjoining cell it would enter my toilet.\nThey took notes and said they would call to check on the issue. (Apparently, they failed to check into the\nissue because Maintenance did not come)\n1.13) \"Formal lnspection,\" is a day in which Different ranking officers (Captain, Lieutenant, and Sgt.) will\ncome to the unit to make sure that the Facility is Working, it is a day in which inmates of Pierce County\nJail can verbally communicate direct problems with Higher Ranking Officers of Authority.\n\"Formal lnspection,\" was a recurring day that happened every Three Weeks\n1.14) The days went on with No Response from Officers about our Plumbing issue and Jail Cluster\nOfficers would continue to deny me cleaning supplies, P.P.E. and proper tools to clean up after my cell\ntoilet would Backflush, telling me that it was either not my turn to have cleaning supplies or that it was\ntoo late in requesting those supplies, leaving me to clean contaminated areas with my Jail issued under\ngarment t-shirts and regular sink water. (This response happened nearly every day.)\n1.15) I requested (To Mental Health Social Workers) to be moved to a different cell due to increased\nPsychological Problems that were occurring. Having to cope with Hallucinations,  Anxiety, with the fear\nof Contracting a disease from the Sewer condition was extremely difficult.\nMental Health SocialWorkers would typically Segue or Digress my complaints about the Sewer by saying\nit was just an old building, ignoring the conditions that we were forced to live in. (Social Workers would\ncome in every Thursday to do checkups, yet every time us residents would complain about the issues\nthey would change the topic, \"Oh it's Just an Old Building.\")\nL.l7l I was moved to Cell \"25\" an May 1-8th, 2020, where I was thrown into another \"Dangerous\"\nsituation. The cell's toilet was completely saturated in feces and urine and the stench of the sitting Urine\nand Feces was repulsive. I was once again told by Officers that it was not my turn to receive Cleaning\nSupplies.\nP.L\n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 81     Filed 07/15/22     Page 12 of 28\nt\n1.18) Having to constantly look at and deal with Raw Sewage and foul water without gloves and\ndisinfectant was offensive and inhumane and l, as like always, I was forced to use my Jail issued T-Shirt\nand sink water to Clean the surrounding areas that were contaminated with the Human Waste.\n1.17) I was placed in several different cells in 3 North A and experienced Constant Sewage Back-Up in\nevery cell.\n1.18) The situation that I and other Residents who have wrote Statements/Declarations, is a continual\nproblem throughout 3North A Unit, every Celltoilet.\n1.19) The toilets were not the only issue that was occurring in 3 North A Unit, the unit itself was\nsaturated from the stench/fumes of Raw Sewage that expelled out of the 10 Sewage drainage pipes that\nwere right next to the cell doors, causing residents including myself to constantly have headaches,\nvomit, diarrhea and not be able to eat. (The Stench of Raw Sewage occurred every day that plaintiff was\nhoused in 3 north A unit to the point that Officers and Medical Staff and Mental Health Staff would\nmake comments about it.)\n1.20) On the next \"Formal lnspection,\" June 3'd, 2O2O,l and several other residents asked the Ranking\nofficers (Defendants Captain B. Sutherlin, Lieutenant Dobson, Deputy T. Pearson) about the Sewers.\n1.21) I pleaded with Defendants named above to have someone fix the Plumbing, explaining to them\nthat every time the cell that was connected to mine flushed the toilet their bodily waste would flow into\nmy toilet, splashing everywhere and at times overflowing and I was left to clean the areas with a Jail\nissued t-shirt because Cluster Officers denied Me Cleaning Supplies during those times.\nL.22) I also explained that nearly every night, when the residents including myself are sleeping, the\ntoilets collected waste from those in neighboring cells and sometimes that waste overflows onto the cell\nfloors, and that we were forced to eat in those conditions.\n1.23) I also tried to explain to the Defendant named above that other resident's fecal matter and waste\nwould rise up through the toilets and spout onto my buttocks when using my toilet.\n1.24l.I personally explained that the plumbing was making me sick, that the Unit was at a Substantial\nrisk for the transmission of an infectious illness, a breeding grounds for disease and that the Conditions\nwere exacerbating  my mental lllness.\n1.24) There response to us was that Pierce County Jail was an Old Building, the situation that we were\ncomplaining about was a 30-year mistake and that Pierce County won't Pay for the issue to be fixed so\nwe as a unlt would just have to deal with it.\nX..25) When I complained that we weren't even given cleaning supplies to clean the contaminated areas,\nDefendants laughingly waved us away and told us to stop talking. (lt was as if we didn't exist)\n?.7\n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 81     Filed 07/15/22     Page 13 of 28\n1.25) I then requested that I be given a Grievance, but that request was denied by cluster officers, other\nresidents also requested grievances in which they were informed that the issue was not grievable\nbecause the Jail was already aware of the issue, the grievance would just be rejected they stated.\nL27l An 6-76-2020,l filed a grievance (#530524) under, \"Staff Treatment of lnmates,\" because they\nwould not allow me to Grieve concerning not getting Cleaning Supplies or Plumbing issues. {Enclosed\nwith Complaint is Grievance # 530524)\n1.28) ln that grievance, Plaintiff Davey claimed that he was trying to clean his cell and requested a rag in\nwhich Officer \"Olsen\" had told him 5 minutes. Plaintiff went to spray his room with disinfectant\nanticipating wiping everything he sprayed down. Officer \"Olsen\" had Plaintiff wait 30 minutes standing\nat the door, so Plaintiff asked again. Officer \"Olsen\" then tells Plaintiff that it was too Late, and Plaintiff\nresponded that, \"you said 30 Minutes ago to wait,\" Officer \"Olsen\" then responded back to Plaintiff by\nsticking his thumb in his ears and sticking his tongue out at him giving Plaintiff Davey a Sad Face.\nPierce County Official failed to address that issue for several Months (L-23-21-\\\n1.29) Those that suffer from high anxiety and Panic attacks, (as Plaintiff Davey) need space to walk or\npace. When Sewage water Splashes onto the floor and residents are denied cleaning supplies, we are\nleft to walk and pace in those Conditions, leaving us residents to have to walk on contaminated floors\nwith socks and slippers and passing that sewage from our socks to our bed. (As explained before, I had\nto use my Jail issued T-Shirt to clean contaminated areas, and only twice was I given a cleaning spray to\ndisinfect surrounding areas of my cell between May 1\"2th 2020 to June 18th 2020)\n1.30) The unit that I was Placed in was a Breeding Ground for Disease.\n1.31) From the time that I entered the cell on May 12th 2A20, to the time that I left to Competency\nRestoration Services on June 18th 2020, I complained every day to unknown named officers about the\nway the toilets were shooting out other residents bodily waste and how the Unit and living quarters\n(Cell) I was forced to live in exposed us to strong odors coming from the Sewer. Plaintiff also complained\nabout the presence of insects coming from those sewage drainpipes that could possibly carry diseases.\n1.32) Those Cluster officers would tell Plaintiff and other residents that they were not plumbers and had\nno way to solve the issues.\n1.33) Also to note, Pierce County Jail Rotates their officers every day to different units, which made it\nharder for rne to keep track of names.\n1.33) On June 18th, 2020, Plaintiff Davey was transferred too Competency Restoration Services\nOn September 1-5th, 2020, Plaintiff Davey was transferred back to Pierce County Jail.\n1.34) On September 76th,2A20, Plaintiff Davey was moved back into 3 North A (Mental Health Unit)\n1.35) When arriving at the Cell \"10-11,\" I noticed that the person (My New Cellmate) that was occupying\nthe cell had his face covered with a towel and the toilet seat covered with a lid from a box that inmates\n?.8\n\na\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 81     Filed 07/15/22     Page 14 of 28\nstore their property in. I asked the Cluster officer if i could get some type of cleaning supplies to clean\nthe cell and I was once again told that it was not my time to receive cleaning supplies.\n1.36) The cell smelled really bad, and my new cellmate explained to me that he would try to read a book\nor take a nap and bodily waste would Backflush into the cell and splash all over the place, so he covered\nthe toilet with the lid and tried to cover his face with a towel because of the stench. He also explained to\nme that he stopped asking for cleaning supplies because he was tired of getting told \"NO.\" (This was\nsomething that I was already aware of.)\n1.37) The ongoing plumbing issue continued in 3 North A Unit, us residents of 3 North A continued to\npress the issue for Cluster officers to give us cleaning supplies, but as stated before, we were always told\nthat it was not our time and that we would receive cteaning supplies at the designated time officers put\nthem in the Unit, something that never happened.\nI also complained to Cluster officers during this time that another inmate had threatened to harm us\n(Beat my Cellmate and I up) if our bodily waste continued to Backfill into his room. We were told by the\nofficers that they had no control over the plumbing issues and that I had to talk to Mental Health on\ntrying to move cells.\n1.38) Mental Health Social Workers moved me to Cell 18 so that I could cope better by myself\n1.39) During our weekly visits from our Mental Health Providers, (Thursday) I would explain to them that\nI was waking up dizzy and not feeling good every morning, I would try to explain the situation about the\nplumbing but again they would always Segue the issue and try to say that it may be a complication with\nmy Medication. They changed my medication several times because of my constant headaches,\ndizziness, and vomiting and always seemed to blame it on the medication and not the fact that we were\nbeing exposed to high degrees of foul odor and sewage.\n1.39) The problem with them saying it was a medication problem is the fact that when I was at the\nYakima Competency  Restoration Center, the medications were not causing me to have any problems, \nI\nwas doing well on them.\n1.40) On October Jth, 2O2O, \"Formal lnspection,\" I once again brought the Conditions up with Captain B.\nSutherlin, Lieutenant Dobson and T. Pearson, also present was Sgt. Mastandrea,  explaining to them that\nour unit constantly reeks of a foul odor that was coming from the sewage and that we were getting sick\nfrom the odor. I also explained to them that our toilet situation was not getting any better and that my\ntoilet was continuing to overflow with other resident's human waste and that flies, and mosquitos were\ncoming from the sewage drains.\n1.41) We were once again told that Pierce County and the Jail were aware of the issue and that it would\nnot be fixed at this time, explaining to us that it was the way the Jails Plumbing was designed and that\nwe would have to dealwith it.\nP.1\n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 81     Filed 07/15/22     Page 15 of 28\n1.42) As the Conditions Persisted, many residents including myself used store bought shampoo and soap\nthat was purchased from the store commissary and also used their Jail house undergarment t-shirt to\nwipe contaminated areas.\n1.43) I and other residents continued to request Grievances but we were continually denied.\n1.44) On October 28th,2020, yet another \"Formal lnspection,\" I made sure that my voice was heard loud\nand clear when lnspection Officers came in.\nI informed them that the Conditions that they had us living in were Exposing us to Raw Sewage and that\nI was going to write Disability Rights Washington. Defendants B. Sutherlin, Lieutenant Dobson, and\nDeputy T. Pearson told me, \"Do what you got to do,\" and went on with saying once again that, \"lts an\nold building,\" \"Stop coming to jail if you don't like being here.\"\n1.45) ln November of 2020,1 tried reaching out to Disability Rights Washington about our unit's\ncondition (they received my letter 11-18 -2L1, in which they sent me a copy of the Jail House Lawyers\nHandbook. Enclosed is their second response to me. But that response states both times that I reached\nout to them.\n1.45) On November 18th 2020, yet another \"Formal lnspection,\" I didn't even get a word out before the\nthree Defendants,  B. Sutherlin, Dobson, and T-Pearson informed the unit that we were to stand by our\ndoors and not talk, they informed us that if anyone was to bring up any of the issues that have already\nbeen discussed that disciplinary action would be taken, and then they looked directly at me and said,\n\"Got that Mr. Davey,\" they then went on to tell our unit while we were standing at our cell doors that,\n\"we are aware of the issues you have been complaining about, the issue is a corrStructional issue that\nhappened when they built the Jail and that it was not going to be fixed at this time\"\n1.47) They also informed us that giving us Cleaning Supplies was not a Policy, but a Privilege designated\nby the Cluster Officer at their disposal. (Further proof of this statement was recorded on Electronic Kite\nwhen I asked the Duty Sgt. lf I could get the Policy for handing out Cleaning Supplies, in which Sgt. Ake\nresponded that there was no set policy for cleaning supplies.\n1.48) Sometime between Nov-Dec I asked the cluster officers if I could get a copy of the Grievance\nPolicy, and within an hour an officer slid the policy underneath my cell door. I requested the policy\nbecause Disability Rights Washington informed me that I needed to request that information so that \nI\ncould understand the Grievance Policies and ask for the proper way to file a grievance so that my\ncomplaints would not be rejected. (Enclosed is the Grievance Procedure I was handed)\n1.49) According to the Grievance Procedure (1) I was to request resolution assistance from the unit\nCorrection Deputy. lf not resolved, proceed to Step#2.\nOver and over, I requested Grievances, but I was denied by deputies stating that they no longer handed\nout grievances.\n(2) Submit a Kite to the appropriate supervisor (see list below) assigned to address the inmate's issue.\nAccording to the grievance Procedure there was no supervisor for Maintenance issues (Please see\nDocument \"Filing a Grievance.\")\nP,lo\n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 81     Filed 07/15/22     Page 16 of 28\n1.50) On or around December 13th or L4th ,2A2O,l spoke with an officer (Erwin) who seemed to listen to\nme, I showed him the Documents from Disability Rights Washington about getting a grievance form and\nhe informed me that I could Electronically Kite the Duty Sgt. to Request a Grievance for the\nMaintenance.(On the Grievance Policy it states that you do not have to kite the Duty Sgt.) Officer\n\"Erwin\" also brought in cleaning supplies after I informed him that we have been using our t-shirts to\nclean our contaminated areas.\n1.51) Officer \"Erwin\" explained to me that he has been working in the New Jail and hasn't worked in the\nMain Jail (Where I was located) for months and that everything because of Covid-19 has complicated\nthings in the Jail, but he said that shouldn't be the excuse for Officers to be lazy and not do their Jobs,\ninforming me that is was the Officers Duty to place cleaning supplies in our unit no matter what.\n1.52)On December L41h,2020, bythe permission of Officer \"Erwin\" I requested a grievance from the\nDuty Sgt. on electronic Kite request #554195, \"can I get a grievance... lt is about the unsafe environment\nthat our sewer is causing us.\n1.53) Cluster Officer \"Starks\" and Sgt. D. Herbison came into our unit to ask us what the Problem was,\nwe explained that our toilets are overflowing every time another person in the adjoining cell flushes\ntheir toilets and that we are constantly being told that we cannot get Cleaning Supplies to clean up\nthose contaminate areas. We also informed them of the foul odor of Raw Sewage that permeated the\nair constantly.\n1.54) Later that day, officer \"Starks\" returned and informed me that I was to dump buckets of water\ndown the Sewer Drainage pipes closets.\n1.551 As I was dumping water down the Drainpipes, I discovered that there were mouse traps that had\ndead mice on them in two of the drainage pipes port closets. I grabbed a Piece of Toilet Paper and threw\nthe mice away and was told by the officer that next time I should ask him before I grab anything that\ndoesn't belong to me.\n1.56) On 12-15-2A2A,l get a response back from Sgt. D. Herbison stating that, \"Officers are researching\nthe issue. The deputies report \"Nothing Unusual.\"\n1.57) I was once again denied a grievance, apparently according to Sgt. D. Herbison, not getting cleaning\nSupplies, Toilets Backflushing, and the permeating foul odor was \"Nothing Unusual\" for us inmates in 3\nNorth A.\n1.58) After receiving that reply from Sgt. D. Herbison, I was called out for a Dentist Appt. because of\ncomplication that happened with my Dentist exam and I crossed ways with Sgt. Ake while waiting for an\nOfficer to transport me. I explained to Sgt. Ake that I keep getting denied grievances even from the Duty\nSgt. and I want Pierce County to fix our units sewer problems.He promised that he would send me a\ngrievance if I Sent him a request because he was working grievances that day, but he also stated to me\nP,ll\n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 81     Filed 07/15/22     Page 17 of 28\nthat the situation has been an ongoing problem and many people have tried to get it fixed but have\nfailed.\n1.59) At the next available time I requested a grievance electronically to the Duty Sgt. and SGT. Ake\nissued me Grievance #554280. (Enclosed is Grievance#554280)\n1.60) In the Grievance Dated 12/16/20 it asks, \"Have you tried to solve this problem by speaking with a\nCorrections Officer?\" I Checked the \"YES\" Box. To the right of that Box it asks, \"lf yes, Name Of\nCorrections Officer: \"lnspection Stafl Sgt. Several times with Correction Officers who just seem to\nignore or laugh at the issue.\"\n1.61) ln my lnitial grievance that had taken me months to receive, I raised these issues:\n1. Health Concern with Unit Toilets\n2. Last 4 lnspections I Raised the lssue\n3. Toilets Shooting out another lnmates Feces\n4. I awake during am Feeding to other people's Fecal Matter dried all over my toilet\n5. A smell develops in our cells and whole unit\n6. Having to eat next to someone else's feces is inhumane\n7. Cleaning contaminated areas every day without proper P.P.E (Disinfectant, Gloves, Rags)\n8. The issue is with the whole unit, every toilet\n9. Asking for cleaning supplies and having to wait hours\n10. lnmates threatening each other (myself) because of the plumbing\n11. Not only Health Concern but a Safety Concern\n12. Counties most vulnerable\n13. Move us until our unit is fully compatible for us to Live in.\n1.62) On t2-L8-7! a plumber \"Jason\" came into our unit and directly to my Cell, he puts a Plumbers Tool\n(Snake) down my toilet and then exits my cell and tells me that, \"Everything is good, Toilets Not\nCIogged\"\n1.63) I went on to explain to him that everything is not good, that every time the adjoining cell flushed\nthe toilet (10-15 Times Daily) that person's Bodily fluid would enter my cell and at times overflow into\nmy room or accumulate over night to the point where I was getting Dizzy, threw up and couldn't eat.\n1.64) I went on to explain that at times when l'm using my own toilet, bodily waste would rise to the top\nand touch my Buttocks and Private area, something that has happened over 50 times. I went on to tell\nhim that at one time my toilet overflowed with bodily waste from the other resident's toilet while I was\nusing it.\n1.55) Maintenance man \"Jason\" acknowledged  that we had a Plumbing issue explaining to us that, \"it\nwas a shitty situation, a 30-year mistake and in order for them to fix the issue they would have to\nreconstruct the whole plumbing, something that Pierce County will not fund.\"\n?.12\n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 81     Filed 07/15/22     Page 18 of 28\n1.55) Jason went on to tell me and other residents in their cell windows that 3 North A was the worse\nfor the Plumbing, telling us that the plumbing is directly connected to the 4th floor and drains down to\nour unit, given us not only each others bodily fluids but those from the 4th floor as well. Maintenance\nman then Gives a little laugh and states, \"you know how the Saying goes, All Shit Roles Down Hill,\" and\nhe leaves the unit.\n1.67) Within an hour a Cluster Officer Slides my Grievance (#554280) under my cell door with a\nResponse from Sgt. Mastandrea.  That response States:\nMaintenance was notified and responded to your cell to evaluate the issue with your toilet. Your cell\ntoilet and the ones connected to your cell plumbing were checked and snaked. After maintenance was\ndone with your cell, I talked to vou and vou stated that vou were satisfied with their response and\nexqlanation of the problem.\n1.58) Here's the problem with that Statement, Sgt. Mastandrea never spoke to me after Maintenance\nleft and nowhere did I ever mention to anyone including the maintenance man that I was satisfied with\nthe explanation of the Problem. This was a fabricated statement.\n1.69) Within 5 minutes of getting that response back I filed an appeal explaining in the Appeal that Sgt.\nMastandrea never came to speak to me about the issue being resolved and that I neverwas satisfied\nwith the response from the Maintenance Man, explaining in the Appeal that I was more upset at the fact\nthat Maintenance was making jokes, acknowledging  that our issue was a \"Shitty Situation\"\n1.70) I also complained in my appeal that there was \"NO\" response about us residents not getting\ncleaning supplies to clean contaminated areas and that our unit was expelling foul odors that was\nmaking me sick to the point that I was waking up Dizzy, throwing up and not being able to eat. I also\nmentioned in my appeal that Social Workers seem to change topics on me, instead of believing that my\nconditions were from the odor, they explained it away by suggesting it was a Medication problem.\n1.71) lronically, after handing my appeal to Cluster officers it was never seen again, it never made it to\nits destination. lt was either lost in transfer or it was purposely rejected. (l tend to believe that it was\npurposely rejected, See Statement in Paragraph 1.26)\n1.72) After many more days of not getting a response from my appeal, I started writing many entities\nexplaining our condition at the Pierce County Jail including Disability Rights Washington a second time,\nHuman Rights Commission x2, ACLU, U.S. Department of Justice, Connelly Law Offices and Southern\nPoverty Law Center. (Enclosed are their responses)\n1.73) Also in my response from Disability Rights Washington I received a 1983 Cornplaint form and\ninformation on how to write a Complaint to the Courts.\nt.741 ln January of 2021\",1 started to Write my 1983 Complaint, but I waited until January 15th, 2021, to\nsend it in anticipating a response back from my Appeal by the Jails higher authority. (That didn't happen)\nP.l7\n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 81     Filed 07/15/22     Page 19 of 28\n1.75) Many Residents, starting in January of 2021, and ending on March 15th 2021 wrote\nDeclarations/Statements about their experience in 3 North Unit, but many were missing from my\ndocuments after receiving them when I was transferred to my main institution in the Department Of\nCorrections. The Declarations/Statements I do have are from the Following Residents:\n1. Mark Erisman\n2. Justin Mohler\n3. Ezra Fleming-Ralston\n4. Roger Woodard\n5. Reid Wasankari\n6. Taldon Maddok\n(Enclosed are their Statements)\n1.75) ln January af 2O2t,l also Electronically  Kited Medical (2-3 times) indicating that I wanted to get\nchecked to make sure that I didn't have any type of medical issues due to being exposed to Raw Sewage\n(Those Electronic Kite request # are 559138, 558187) Medical Staff Responded back both times with,\n\"There is no Medical indication for this request.\"\nL.771 I also sent Mental Health an Electronic Kite explaining that we are continuing to be exposed to\nRaw Sewage, ( #566119) and Mental health Responded, \"Certain Parts Of Your Body Are Always Exposed\nTo Raw Sewage.\"\n1.78) On January 74rh,2021.,1 was hired as our Units \"Unit Worker,\" by Officer Wilson. I was told by\nOfficers that day that I would be receiving cleaning supplies to clean the unit at 9pm, in which I was to\nclean the Unit Day Room and the Shower. During the Time I was a Unit Worker I requested that I get\ncleaning supplies during the day so that we could clean our rooms, but I was told that Cleaning supplies\nwere to be handed out at 9 pm when all residents were in their rooms, in which they indicated new\ncovid Protocols. (At that time, I would hide cleaning disinfectant in my cup to take into my room and\ndistribute some to other inmates that asked.)\nI also want to note that I was concerned about the Unit next to ours, (3 North B Unit) a unit similarly\nBuilt as 3 North A but residents are Solitary Confined in the unit. I noticed that the Unit/Showers were\nnot being cleaned at all and I requested many times that I go over to that Unit to at least Sanitize the\nShowers.\n1.79) On January 15n,2A21.,1 sent in my lnitial 1983 Complaint. The Complaint was filed on 1-25-21 as a\nMulti-Person Complaint, Ezra Fleming-Ralston being the second Plaintiff on the Complaint.\n1.80) At the end January of 202!,1 was informed by Cluster Officer (Because I complained) to send\nElectronic Kites to the Duty Sgt. asking why my appeal had not been heard. I then sent more request at\nthe permission of Cluster officers asking for Grievances because my appeal was not answered.\nOn February Znd, I received a response back from Captain Ganga indicating to me that his office had not\nreceived my Appeal.\n1.81) On February 3'd,2027, Pierce County Jail went on Mandatory Quarantine Status, us residents in 3\nNorth A were left in our Cells for 4 days, \"No Showers\", suffering in our contaminated cells without any\n?,lrl\n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 81     Filed 07/15/22     Page 20 of 28\nMovement, no Day-room where we could get away from the Toilets constantly back-flushing and\nsmelling.\n1.82) On February 5'h, 202L, Ezra Fleming-Ralston received a response back from the Clerk of the United\nStates District Courts indicating that he needed to Sign and Date his name on the Complaint form.\nEzra then requested that he be able to get Copies of the Complaint.\n1.83) On February 6th,IAZL, Officer Peter's came into our unit to collect the Documents from Ezra\nFleming-Ralston. Because the documents had my name Justin Davey v. Pierce County Council on them,\nOfficer Peter's had thought that Ezra was making legal copies for me, (lnmates are not allowed to make\nlegal copies for other inmate's) so he decided that he was going to read the complaint. After reading the\ncomplaint and seeing that Ezra Fleming-Ralston was in the Complaint, Officer Peter's takes the\ncomplaint and makes copies of it.\n1.84) lronically, on February 7rh,202L, Sgt. Ake and Sgt. Mastandrea came to our unit. They then\nUnlocked my door and asked me what was going on, (lndicating that they were aware of my 1983\nComplaint) I informed them that for months I have been complaining about the toilets, I even showed\nthem empty cells that had Raw Sewage all over the place because the Sewage was back-filling from\nother cells, I told them that my Appeal was lost and that nobody seems to care.\nX.85) I explained to both Sgt's. that we as a unit continued to tell Captain B. Sutherlin, Lieutenant\nDobson, and CO T. Pearson during \"Formal lnspection\" that our unit was disease ridden and we were\nhaving to use our clothing to clean up the contaminated areas but they always would Laugh us away and\ntell us that the issue was not going to be fixed because it was an old building and Pierce County want fix\nit and that we just had to deal with it.\n1.85) Sgt. Mastandrea then took me to the side and told me personally that he was going to contact\nCaptain Genga in Administration about the lssue.\n1.8G)On February $th,2021, Sgt Mastandrea returned to 3 North A unit and Pulled me out of my Cell\nand told me that he Contacted Captain Genga and that on February L}th 202L, Captain Genga was going\nto Personally come down during \"Formal lnspection\" and check on the issue that he informed him of,\nSgt. Mastandrea also informed me that the \"Formal lnspection\" officers should have reported the issues\nthat we were complaining about. I also showed Sgt. Mastandrea more cells that were disgusting.\n1.87) I then reminded Sgt. Mastandrea that he disregarded my lnmate Grievance by lying on the\ndocument saying that I was Satisfied by the Maintenance man's explanation of the issue. Sgt.\nMastandrea then informed me that he spoke to the maintenance man after the initial plumbing check\nand it was the maintenance man that suggested that I was Satisfied with the response, Sgt Mastandrea\nalso informed me that the Maintenance Man also Jokingly said to him that, \"all shit roles downhill\" but\nhe took it as a Joke.\n1.88) On Wednesday,  February \\Oth 202L, \"Formal lnspection\" Day, Captain Genga, Sgt. Mastandrea and\nSgt. D. Herbison and Sgt. Ake, came into our Unit and captain Genga Pulled me out of my cell and asked\n?,15\n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 81     Filed 07/15/22     Page 21 of 28\nme to explain to him what was going on, I explained to him that for months we have been trying to get\nGrievances because the conditions we were living under were unhealthy for anybody to live in, but that\nthis unit has Pierce County jail most vulnerable subjects, as I was explaining to him what was going on, I\nshowed him the cell next to mine where the Resident was sleeping, the cells toilet and surrounding area\nwas covered In feces, the bed itself in our cells are within 2-3 feet from the toilet and we are made to lay\nour heads closest to the toilet because of the way the Bunks are made.\nt.8g) I went on to tellCaptain Genga that Sgt D. Herbison denied me a grievance and informed me that\nthese conditions were not unusual on electronic kites, I informed Captain Genga that other Captains,\nLieutenant and Officers ignored our pleas to get the plumbing fixed by saying that it's an old building,\nand that pierce county will not fix the lssue and that we just had to deal with it. I informed Captain\nGenga that my grievance was lost or purposely rejected, and I was not gaining any resolution to the\nproblem anywhere.\nI explained to Captain Genga that we are left to use our t-shirts to clean contaminated areas because we\nare denied cleaning supplies during times of need.\n1.90) Captain Genga lnformed me that he would personally contact Maintenance and figure out a way\nto get the issues fixed, as for the cleaning supplies, Captain Genga informed me that they would be\nhaving a staff meeting about getting cleaning supplies to us when we needed.\n1.91) Later that Day, I sent Two Paper Kites, One to Captain Genga, and one to Sgt. Ake. (Enclosed are\nthose Kites) ln the Kites I asked if there was any way that I could get copies of the emails that they sent\nto maintenance, and I also asked if I could get a report about what was seen. Again, enclosed is their\nresponse on Paper Kite.\n1.92) On 2-tL-21., Sgt. Smith brought an emailto 3 North A Cluster Officers, that email had Chief Patti\nJacksons name on it. The Email discussed what officers were to do. \"Make sure officers flushed the\ntoilets of Empty cells.\n1.93) I witnessed a Cluster Officer rip that email up and State that he, \"was not a Plumber.\"\n1.94) Between2-72-21and 3-16-21, not one Officer adhered to Chief Jackson's Email, and cleaning\nsupplies were withheld from us because of the Covid Mandatory Lockdown Status.\n1.95) On 2-L2-27, Sgt. Ake brought in Sani-Sticks to eliminate the odor of Raw Sewage\n1.95) On 2-73-21., Sgt. Ake came to check if the Sani-Sticks worked, they did not. Also, I would like to\nnote that Sgt. Ake bought those Sani-Sticks himself, explaining that the unit's sewers were really bad\nand that there was no indication on Maintenance fixing the issue. (l was the one that helped Sgt. Ake\nput the Sani-Sticks down the pipe drains.)\n1.971 On 2-20-27, Ctuster Officer, Mrs. Herbison worked in unit 3 North A and her first words when she\nentered our unit was, \"Wow, it smells really bad.\" She and the other officer took a bucket of water and\n?.tt\n\n7\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 81     Filed 07/15/22     Page 22 of 28\ndumped water down the sewage drains. That Practice doesn't work. (l also Dumped water down the\ndrains a second time that day)\n1.98) Later, an2-2A-27, Cluster Officer Mrs. Herbison said that she sent a Complaint to Maintenance\n(around 2pm) because the Odor of Raw Sewage was so bad.\n1.99) On 2-22-21, during breakfast feeding around 4:30am, I overheard C-O Kline telling C-O Peck that\nsome of the cell's toilets were disgusting.\n1.100) On March 4th, 202L,l sent a message to Karen Beir (Manager of Mental Health) about our\nsituation and if she could get Chief Jackson to come talk to us.\n1.101) The response from Karen Beir said that she spoke to Sgt. Miller about our situation and that he\nwould take care of it.\n1.102) lronically, on March 1,Lth,2A2!, Roger Woodard (One who wrote a Statement) requested a\nGrievance, Sgt. Miller came into our unit and asked what the problem was.\n1.103) Roger Woodard and l, Davey, showed Sgt. Miller 3 cell's, each cell had \"Bodily Waste\" full to the\nRim, splashed on the Rim.\nL.LO | When Sgt, Miller began to leave, Roger Woodard asked Sgt. Miller about the Grievance he\nrequested.\n1.105) Sgt. Miller Stated, \"Because this is the first time, I am hearing about this, I am going to Contact\nMaintenance before we move any further.\"\n1.106) At this point it was obvious that nothing was being done to remedy the Sewer condition and the\nongoing unsanitary issues, we had complained on numerous occasions, had Administration  Officers look\ninto the problem and nothing was being done, it seemed as if they were just trying to see if time went\nby that we would just stop with the complaints.\n1.107) On March 12th,}OZL,l Davey Pled guilty and on March 1.6th,202!,1 Justin Davey was sent to the\nDepartment of Corrections.\n1.108) Enclosed in this Complaint is a Medical Kite that I put in when I got to the Department of\nCorrections,  indicating that I was in need of seeing a doctor because of some of the concerns and issues\nI was having, please read lnmate Medical kite while I was in the Department of Corrections.  (Pierce\nCounty Medical refused to see me)\nExhaustion Of Legal Remedies\n1.109) Plaintiff Davey used the lnmate grievance procedure available at the Pierce County Jail to try and\nsolve the Problem. After many months of being denied grievances, on December 16'h,2020 Plaintiff\nDavey presented facts relating to this complaint. On December 18th, 2020, Plaintiff Davey was sent a\n?.17\n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 81     Filed 07/15/22     Page 23 of 28\nresponse with a fabricated statement saying that Plaintiff was Satisfied with the explanation of the\nissues. On December 18'h, 2020, Plaintiff appealed the response of the grievance and on February 2nd,\n2021, Plaintiff became aware that his Appeal had not made it to Administration.  Plaintiff requested\ngrievances from Administration but was denied those requests.\nlnjury\nSince Defendants failed to Cure, abate, remedy, or break-up the custom or practice, Plaintiff had been\nleft to suffer from headaches, vomiting, stomach-aches, dizziness, exacerbated psychological problems, \nI\nwent without eating due to said conditions and had constant Diarrhea. I also Feared of genital infections\nand damage to my oxygen system because of shortness of breath.\nDefendants' Pattern and Practice of Deliberate !ndifference\nto the lnhumane Conditions at the PCJ\nA. Pierce County\n1.110) Pierce County, through its Sheriff's Office, the County Council, and the Legislature (collectively in\nthis section \"Pierce County\"), has engaged in a pattern and practice of deliberate indifference to the\ninhumane and unconstitutional  conditions at the PCJ.\n1.111) Pierce County has systematically and deliberately ignored, or failed to take reasonable measures\nto address, the visibly deplorable and unconstitutional  conditions at the PU. As described in detail in\nthis Complaint, areas of the walls and floors, are contaminated by Human Waste that Overflows from\nthe Facilities own Plumbing issue. Men are forced to live in each other's filth and waste without proper\nPolicies or Procedures to obtain Cleaning Supplies which led inmates including Plaintiff to use Jail issued\nT-Shirts to wipe Contaminated areas down. The Unit is Constantly Permeated with foul Odor that\nOfficers themselves complain about and it also seems that the facility is lnfested with Rodents as\ndescribed by plaintiff of him throwing away two dead mice that were caught in a mouse trap.\nL.1L2l Pierce County has also systematically and deliberately ignored, or failed to take reasonable\nmeasures to address, the complaints about the deplorable and unconstitutional  conditions ralsed by the\nmen detained in the PCJ. For months, the men detained at the Pierce County Jail were denied\nGrievances, even being told that the Deprivation was, \"Nothing Unusual.\" When finally given a\nGrievance, the issue was pushed aside, being told that the issue was something Pierce County will not\nfund.\"\n1.1131 Finally, Pierce County has systematically and deliberately ignored, or failed to take reasonable\nmeasures to address two 1983 Complaints Dated back to 20L2.\nSee Steele v. (ery-2012 U.S. Dist Lexis  : Plaintiff alleges the cells in the Pierce County Jail are Cold,\nFilthy, and Unsanitary. He complains the TOILETS BACK-UP and are Unsanitary. These allegations, if true,\nstate a claim for violations of the Eighth Amendment.\nSee also Meyer-Clemmons  v. Karr,2OL2 U.S. Dist Lexis 28798: Plaintiff Claimed that another inmate's\nwaste is, \"Bubbling Up\" in my toilet.\ntg\nP. \n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 81     Filed 07/15/22     Page 24 of 28\nAlthough both Complaints were dismissed so that the Plaintiffs could exhaust remedies, it didn't\neliminate the fact that Pierce County and said Defendants were put on Notice about said conditions and\nfailed to respond.\nt.LL l These uninhabitable, and hazardous conditions are the product of decades of neglect and the\nrefusal by the County to adequately maintain the PO. As stated in Plaintiffs Cornplaint, Defendants B.\nSutherlin, Captain Dobson, Deputy T.Pearson and Maintenance Man \"Jason all reported that the\nconditions were a 30 year mistake and that Pierce County would not Fund the Money to Reconstruct\nthe Units Plumbing.\nB. Defendants Ed Troyer, and Patti Jackson\n1.115) Defendant Ed Troyer, as the Sheriff of Pierce County, is responsible for the care of persons\ndetained in the PCl. To fulfill this duty, the Sheriff's Office is empowered to request County funds from\nthe Pierce County Legislature and to report to the Public Safety Committee of the Pierce County\nLegislature about the need for capital funding to repair, maintain, and renovate the Pierce County Jail\nFacility.\n1.115) Defendant Patti Jackson, as Chief of the lnternal Operation of the Sheriff Dept. Correction\nBureau, is charged with oversight of corrections for the Pierce County Sheriff's Office and is responsible\nfor protecting and preserving the health and welfare of persons detained in the PCJ and designing and\nimplementing policies, procedures, and practices to ensure that the facility is maintained in a sanitary\ncondition.\n1.tl7l Defendants Ed Troyer and Patti Jackson are charged with enforcement of alI Washington State\nlaw and Pierce County laws and regulations designed to preserve the health and welfare of persons\ndetained in the PCJ.\n1.118) Defendants Ed Troyer and Patti iackson knew or should have known of the visibly deplorable and\nunconstitutional  conditions at the PCJ.\n1.119) Defendants Ed Troyer and Patti Jackson knew or should have known of the complaints raised by\nthe men detained at the PCJ about those conditions and their injuries arising from those conditions.\n1.120) Finally, Defendants Ed Troyer and Patti Jackson knew or should have known of the fact that the\nconditions of the PCJ had been deteriorating over the better part of the last decade and would only\nbecome worse without appropriate remedial efforts. Ten years ago, two inrnates took into their own\nhands to file 1983 complaints against the Sheriffs Department Complaining of Unsanitary Condition at\nthe PCJ including that the Toilets were \"Bubbling Up\" with others waste, and that the Toilets \"Back-Up\"\nand are Unsanitary. (See Citation Paragraph 1.1-13) Further, Officers of Different Ranks and also the\nPierce County Maintenance themselves admitted that the issue was a 3o-year mistake caused by the\npoor Construction of the Building.\nP,N\n\nCase 3:21-cv-05068-LK-SKV     Document 81     Filed 07/15/22     Page 25 of 28\nL.LIL! Despite their knowledge of the unconstitutional  conditions at the PO, Defendants Ed Troyer and\nPattiJackson have engaged in a pattern and practice of deliberate indifference to those conditions and\nthe harms plaintiff has suffered as a result of those conditions.\nt.L22l Defendants Ed Troyer and Patti Jackson breached their duty of care owed to persons detained in\nthe PCJ by permitting the deplorable conditions at the PCJ to persist. This breach was the direct and\nproximate cause of the harms suffered by Ptaintiff detained in the PCJ.\nC. Defendants B. Sutherlin, Dobson, T. Pearson\n1.123) Defendants B. Sutherlin, Dobson, and T.
