Plaintiffs brought this lawsuit for declaratory and injunctive relief against Tennessee&rsquo;s DCS under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. The plaintiffs sought an order declaring that the defendant violated the plaintiffs&rsquo; Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process rights by not assisting the plaintiffs with timely immigration applications, and an injunction requiring the defendant to establish and implement procedures to ensure eligible youth under their care seek immigration relief in a timely manner. This case was assigned to Judge Campbell.</p>\r\n<p>Tennessee DCS serves as the legal guardian for the plaintiffs due to their placement within the state&rsquo;s foster care system. The plaintiffs lack legal immigration status but are eligible for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS). SIJS is available to child immigrants and provides them with many benefits including a pathway to lawful permanent resident status and United States citizenship. Child immigrants are required to submit an application for SIJS before their eighteenth birthday or forever lose the opportunity.</p>\r\n<p>On December 19, 2023, the parties jointly filed their draft settlement agreement with the court for review and approval. Under the terms of the agreement, the defendant agreed to draft, and make public, the Department&rsquo;s policy concerning foreign-born children under their care. The policy, among other things, will include procedures for identifying qualifying children, internal tracking measures, establishing a centralized, internal team dedicated to immigration related needs, and refer cases to organizations and attorneys that handle immigration proceedings. The defendant did not admit guilt in the agreement, but they further agreed to pay $75,000 for the plaintiffs&rsquo; attorney&rsquo;s fees.</p>\r\n<p>On February 12, 2024, the court entered an order approving the terms of the parties&rsquo; settlement agreement and dismissed the case with prejudice as called for in the settlement agreement.</p>\r\n<p>This case is now closed.</p>",

Campbell, Jr. \nv. \nMagistrate Judge Jeffrey S. Frensley \nMargie Quin, in her official capacity as the \nCommissioner of the Tennessee Department of \nChildrenโs Services, \n Defendant. \nAGREED PROTECTIVE ORDER \nPlaintiffs  and  Defendant  in  this  matter  anticipate  exchanging  personally  identifying \ninformation during the course of discovery in this action. To protect the confidentiality of \ninformation  produced  in  this  lawsuit  and  to  facilitate  prompt  resolution  of  disputes  over \nconfidentiality, the Parties have agreed to the terms of this Agreed Protective Order.

A draft or other non-identical copy is a\nseparate document within the meaning of this term.\n1 \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 26     Filed 09/19/23     Page 1 of 15 PageID #: 188\n\nc) โDiscovery Materialโ or โDiscovery Materialsโ means all documents, transcripts, records,\nand things (in oral, written, or electronic forms) within the scope of Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure 34 and discovery in this litigation, including, without limitation, all testimony\nadduced at depositions, all documents or things responsive to requests for the production\nof documents and things, all answers to interrogatories, all responses to requests for\nadmissions, and all other discovery requests taken in accordance with the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure, as well as hearing and trial transcripts, matters in evidence, and any other\ninformation furnished, directly or indirectly, by or on behalf of any party to this litigation\nor any third party.\nd) โConfidential  Materialโ  means  any  (1)  personally  identifying  information  of  any\nindividual, i.e., any information that could be used to identify an individual or with respect\nto which there is a reasonable basis to believe the information could be used to identify the\nindividual, including but not limited to, names of minor Plaintiffs, names of any individual\nproceeding  in  this  litigation  pseudonymously,  names  of  minor  Plaintiffsโ  biological\nparents, foster parents, caregivers, and/or relatives; dates of birth; social security numbers;\nor addresses; (2) personal health information; (3) documents containing or reflecting trade\nsecrets or commercial information not publicly known; and (4) any other information\nrequired by law or agreement to be kept confidential.\ne) โPersonal Health Informationโ is defined as:\ni. health information that relates to\n1. the past, present, or future physical or mental health condition of the\nindividual;\n2. the provision of health care to an individual; and\n2 \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 26     Filed 09/19/23     Page 2 of 15 PageID #: 189\n\n3. the past, present, or future payment for health care provided; and\nii. that includes any information that could be used to identify an individual or with\nrespect to which there is a reasonable basis to believe the information could be used\nto identify the individual.\nf) โAgreement to be Bound by Protective Orderโ means an executed document in the form\nattached as Exhibit A.\ng) โProducing Partyโ means a Party that produces or discloses Discovery Material in this\naction or a third party served with a discovery request that produces or discloses Discovery\nMaterial in this action.\nh) โReceiving Partyโ means a Party that receives Discovery Material in this action.\n2. MATERIALS  TO  WHICH  THIS  ORDER  APPLIES.  This  Order  applies  to  all\nDiscovery Material produced or exchanged by a Producing Party in this action.  \n3. PERSONS AND ENTITIES TO WHICH THIS ORDER APPLIES. This Order shall\nbind every Producing Party and Receiving Party, as well as all employees, attorneys, independent \ncontractors, and other persons who receive Discovery Material. This Order shall also bind any \nfuture parties to this lawsuit, as well as to their employees, attorneys, independent contractors and \nother persons over whom the future party has control. Within ten (10) business days of the joinder \nof any new party, counsel for the Party who joined the new party or requested joinder shall \npromptly serve a copy of this Order on counsel for the new party.  \n4. DESIGNATING MATERIAL AS CONFIDENTIAL. A Party or Producing Party may\ndesignate Discovery Material as Confidential Material if the Party or Producing Party believes in \ngood  faith,  after  reasonable  review,  that  the  Discovery  Material  meets  the  definition  of \nConfidential Material set forth in Section 1 of this Order. If a Producing Party designates Discovery \n3 \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 26     Filed 09/19/23     Page 3 of 15 PageID #: 190\n\nMaterial as Confidential Material, the protections of this Order cover not only the Confidential \nMaterial itself, but also any information copied or extracted from it, as well as copies, excerpts, \nsummaries, or compilations thereof and testimony, conversations, or presentations by Parties or \ncounsel that might disclose Confidential Material.  \na) Manner of Designation. A Party or Producing Party shall designate Discovery Material as\nโConfidentialโ in the following manner:\ni. For documents (apart from transcripts of depositions or discovery responses), the\nProducing  Party  shall  affix  โCONFIDENTIALโ  on  each  page  that  contains\nConfidential Material in a conspicuous size and location on the page but without\ninterfering with legibility.\nii. For  written  discovery  responses,  the  Producing  Party  shall  affix\nโCONFIDENTIALโ next to or above any response that contains Confidential\nMaterial.\niii. If Discovery Material is produced in a format rendering it impractical to label (e.g.,\nESI produced in native format or on electronic media), a Producing Party may\ndesignate such item as โCONFIDENTIALโ by (1) notifying the Receiving Party in\na cover letter to the production, (2) affixing โCONFIDENTIALโ to the outside of\nthe electronic media on which the material is stored, or (3) if applicable, by\nproviding the appropriate designation as a field within the related load file.\niv. For  transcripts  of  deposition  testimony,  all  such  testimony  shall  be  deemed\nConfidential Material only if designated as such. Such designation shall be specific\nas to the portions to be designated โCONFIDENTIAL.โ Depositions, in whole or\nin part, shall be designated on the record as โCONFIDENTIALโ at the time of the\n4 \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 26     Filed 09/19/23     Page 4 of 15 PageID #: 191\n\ndeposition. Deposition testimony so designated shall remain Confidential Material \nuntil thirty (30) days after delivery of the final transcript by the court reporter. The \nParty who wishes to designate deposition testimony as Confidential Material shall, \nwithin thirty (30) days after the court reporter issues the final transcript of the \ndeposition, identify in writing to the other Party the specific portions of the \ntestimony designated by page and line number for which protection is sought. Only \nthose portions of deposition testimony designated in writing in accordance with this \nsubsection shall remain covered by this Order. The failure to identify in writing the \nportions of deposition testimony designated shall waive the โCONFIDENTIALโ \ndesignation made on the record of the deposition.  \nb) Inadvertent Failure to Designate. The production of any document, discovery response, or\nother item without โCONFIDENTIALโ affixed thereto shall not constitute waiver of the\nProducing Partyโs right to designate the item as โConfidentialโ at a later date. If a Producing\nParty produces or exchanges any item without the appropriate designation and later decides\nto designate the item for protection, the Producing Party shall notify counsel for the\nReceiving Party in writing and provide counsel for the Receiving Party with replacement\ndocuments bearing the appropriate designations. Upon receiving written notice of the\ndesignation and the replacement items, counsel for the Receiving Party shall return or\ndestroy all copies of the undesignated items and confirm in writing to counsel for the\nProducing Party that it has done so, except where the items have already been submitted to\nthe Court, introduced at a hearing without protection, or been marked as an exhibit at a\ndeposition. The Receiving Party shall then treat the newly designated items as Confidential\nMaterial in accordance with this Order.\n5 \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 26     Filed 09/19/23     Page 5 of 15 PageID #: 192\n\n5.  USE AND DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL. \na)  Use of Confidential Material. A Receiving Party may use Confidential Material produced \nor disclosed by another Party only as necessary for the preparation and trial of this case or \nany related appellate proceeding. A Receiving Party may not use Confidential Material \nproduced or disclosed by another Party for any other purpose. Nothing in this Order shall \nprevent the disclosure of Confidential Material to counsel for the Parties for use in this \ncase.  \nb)  Disclosure of Confidential Material. Confidential Material shall not be disclosed to any \nperson or entity other than: \ni.  a Party; \nii.  if a Party is a government official, the Partyโs current employees, as well as any \nformer employee of a Party, but only to the extent counsel determines that the \nspecifically named employeeโs assistance is reasonably necessary to the conduct of \nthe litigation, and if the employee previously agrees in writing to be bound by this \nOrder pursuant to Exhibit A of this Order;  \niii.  counsel for a Party; \niv.  current employees of counsel for a Party who have direct responsibility for assisting \ncounsel in this lawsuit; \nv.  expert witnesses and consultants retained by a Party to assist in the preparation and \ntrial of this lawsuit, and if the expert witness or consultant previously agrees in \nwriting to be bound by this Order pursuant to Exhibit A of this Order;  \nvi.  any mediator hired or appointed to mediate this lawsuit, and any employees of such \nmediator actively assisting with the mediation;  \n6 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 26     Filed 09/19/23     Page 6 of 15 PageID #: 193\n\nvii.  employees of any copying or document imaging company used by counsel for a \nParty in the preparation and trial of this lawsuit; \nviii.  this Court and any Court personnel (and the relevant appellate court and its \npersonnel  in  the  event  any  appeal  is  taken),  provided  that  the  Confidential \nInformation is filed in accordance with Section 9 herein;  \nix.  a prospective fact witness that has been disclosed in any Partyโs initial disclosures, \nif the witness previously agrees in writing to be bound by this Order pursuant to \nExhibit A of this Order; \nx.  during their depositions or testimony, witnesses in this action to whom disclosure \nis reasonably necessary and who previously agree in writing to be bound by this \nOrder pursuant to Exhibit A of this Order, provided that witnesses shall not retain \na copy of documents containing Confidential Material except as necessary to \nreview deposition transcripts; \nxi.  qualified  persons  taking  or  recording  testimony  involving  such  material  and \nnecessary stenographic and clerical personal, if this person previously agrees in \nwriting to be bound by this Order pursuant to Exhibit A of this Order; or \nxii.  other persons by written agreement of the Producing Party, if this person previously \nagrees in writing to be bound by this Order pursuant to Exhibit A of this Order. \n6.  USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INDEPENDENTLY OBTAINED INFORMATION. \nNothing in this Order restricts a Party or counsel from using or disclosing: (1) publicly available \ninformation or (2) except for any confidential material, use of which is governed by the rest of this \nOrder, information that lawfully came into the possession of the Party independent of any \ndisclosure, exchange, or production of Discovery Material in this lawsuit. \n7 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 26     Filed 09/19/23     Page 7 of 15 PageID #: 194\n\n7. UNAUTHORIZED USE OR DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL.\nCounsel for the Parties shall make reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized disclosure of \nConfidential Material. If a Receiving Party learns that it has disclosed Confidential Material to any \nperson or in any manner not authorized by this Order, the Receiving Party must immediately, and \nin no event more than five (5) days from learning of such disclosure: (1) notify the Producing Party \nin writing of the unauthorized disclosure; (2) make every reasonable effort to prevent disclosure \nof the Confidential Material by the unauthorized persons who received such material; (3) use its \nbest efforts to retrieve all copies of the Confidential Material that were disclosed; and (4) inform \nthe persons or entities to whom unauthorized disclosure was made of this Order.  \n8. CHALLENGES  TO  DESIGNATION  OF  CONFIDENTIAL  MATERIAL.  A\nReceiving Party may challenge the designation of Confidential Material by giving counsel for the \ndesignating  Party  and  Producing  Party  written  notice  listing  the  Confidential  Material  the \nReceiving Party challenges and explaining, briefly, the factual and legal basis for the Receiving \nPartyโs belief that the Confidential Material should not be designated โConfidential.โ Such written \nnotice shall be provided to the Producing Party not later than 60 days after the Receiving Party \nreceived the Discovery Material at issue. If the Parties cannot agree on the designation of any \nConfidential Material within thirty (30) days after counsel for the Receiving Party sends such \nwritten notice, the Receiving Party may file a motion seeking resolution of the issue with the Court, \nsubject to the provisions of this Order governing the filing of Confidential Material. All Discovery \nMaterial designated โConfidentialโ will be treated as Confidential Material in accordance with this \nOrder  unless  and  until  the  designating  Party  and  Producing  Party  agree  to  remove  the \nโConfidentialโ designation, or until the Court so orders. \n8 \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 26     Filed 09/19/23     Page 8 of 15 PageID #: 195\n\n9.  FILING OF CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL. A Receiving Party who seeks to file with \nthe Court any deposition transcripts, exhibits, answers to interrogatories, or other documents which \nhave previously been designated as comprising or containing Confidential Material; or any \npleading,  brief,  or  memorandum  which  reproduces,  paraphrases,  or  discloses  Confidential \nMaterial, shall follow the procedures of this Court for seeking leave to file documents under seal \nso as to prevent the disclosure of Confidential Material to persons and entities other than those \nidentified in Section 5(b). \n10.  RETURN/DESTRUCTION  OF  CONFIDENTIAL  MATERIAL  AFTER \nCONCLUSION OF LAWSUIT. After final termination of this lawsuit (including any appeals), \ncounsel for the Producing Party may request the destruction or return of all Confidential Material \nin the possession of the Receiving Party. Once such a request has been made, within thirty (30) \ndays from the date of receiving such a request, the Receiving Party shall destroy or return to \ncounsel for the Producing Party all Confidential Material in its possession, custody, or control. In \naddition, counsel for the Receiving Party shall provide a written statement to counsel for the \nProducing Party certifying that all Confidential Material designated by the Producing Party, \nincluding any copies thereof, have been returned to the Producing Party or destroyed, provided, \nhowever, that counsel for the Receiving Party may retain (1) any attorney work product; and (2) \ncopies of any pleadings, motions, briefs, declarations, affidavits, and deposition transcripts that \ncontain, attach, or append Confidential Material, but only to the extent necessary to preserve a file \nwith respect to this lawsuit. \n11.  CLAW  BACK  OF  INADVERTENTLY  PRODUCED  PRIVILEGED \nINFORMATION.  Pursuant  to  Federal  Rule  of  Evidence  502(b),  the  Parties  agree  that \ninadvertent disclosure to another Party of any document that is subject to a legitimate claim that \n9 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 26     Filed 09/19/23     Page 9 of 15 PageID #: 196\n\nthe document should have been withheld from disclosure based on attorney-client privilege, the \nwork product doctrine, or any other recognized privilege shall not constitute waiver of that \nprivilege. Upon identification of any inadvertently produced information and/or documents, the \nProducing  Party  shall  provide  the  Receiving  Party  written  notification  identifying  the \ndocument(s) or information that has been inadvertently disclosed and stating the privilege under \nwhich the document(s) or information is allegedly protected. Upon receipt of such written \nnotification, the Receiving Party shall, within three (3) business days, return to the Producing \nParty each inadvertently disclosed document and any and all copies of that document in the \nReceiving Partyโs possession, custody, or control, and use its best efforts to retrieve all copies of \nthe inadvertently disclosed document that the Receiving Party disclosed to other persons or \nentities. The return of inadvertently disclosed documents under this paragraph shall not prevent \nany Party from asserting specific objections to any claims of privilege regarding such documents \nas could normally be made. Nothing in this Protective Order overrides any attorneyโs ethical \nresponsibilities to refrain from examining or disclosing materials that the attorney knows or \nreasonably should know to be privileged and to inform the Producing Party that such materials \nhave been produced. \n12. NO ADMISSION. Nothing contained in this ORDER, nor an action taken in compliance\nwith it shall: \na) operate as an admission by any Party that any Discovery Material is, or is not, in fact,\nConfidential Material;\nb) operate as an admission by any Party that Discovery Material is, or is not, admissible\nevidence;\nc) constitute a waiver or estoppel by any party of any defense or claim in this matter.\n10 \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 26     Filed 09/19/23     Page 10 of 15 PageID #: 197\n\n13. DURATION OF THIS ORDER. This Order shall continue to be binding on every\nperson or entity subject to this Order through entry of final judgment in this lawsuit, the \ndisposition of any appeal, and so long as a Receiving Party or its counsel continues to maintain \npossession of Confidential Discovery Material. All protections of this Protective Order shall \nremain in full effect in perpetuity. \n14. MODIFICATION. Any Party may seek an order from the Court modifying the terms of\nthis Order. \n15. SANCTIONS. Any violation of this Protective Order may subject the violator to sanctions\nas deemed appropriate by the Court and within the Courtโs authority. \n  SIGNED September 19, 2023 \n________________________ \nMagistrate Judge Jeffery S.

Immigrant children in the custody of the Tennessee Department of Childrenโs \nServices (โDCSโ) are some of the most vulnerable children in the state. Many of these children \nfled their home countries to escape from abuse, human rights atrocities, trafficking, and other \nviolence. In addition to these traumas, many risked their lives on their journeys to the United \nStatesโtraversing thousands of miles by foot, bus, and train to find safety. Hoping for safe \nharbor and protection, some immigrant children instead have endured additional hardships in \nfederal immigration detention, after being released to family members in Tennessee \ncommunities, and while in DCS custody. Regardless of their path to Tennessee, these children \nremain vulnerable without legal immigration status, barred from employment, healthcare, and \nmany services, and are at constant risk of being detained or removed from the country. \n2.  This action concerns immigrant children taken into DCS custody following a \njuvenile court determination that they have been abused or neglected. When DCS takes custody \nof a child, including immigrant children, it must provide for their โcare, protection, training and \neducation,โ as well as their โphysical, mental and moral welfare.โ  Tenn. Code ยง 37-1-140(a). \n3.  For children in DCS custody without legal immigration status, DCSโs care must \ninclude addressing and safeguarding their immigration-related needs, which impact their health, \nwelfare, and safety. This care entails determining whether a child is in need of immigration-\nrelated services, ensuring that DCS considers immigration-related needs when helping the child \nplan for their future, and helping a child access needed services.  \n4.  The obligation of DCS to provide such support is critical because immigrant \nchildren in DCS custody who lack legal status are generally eligible for a form of federal \nimmigration relief called Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS). SIJS was created by \nCongress to provide humanitarian protection for abused, neglected, or abandoned child \n1 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 2 of 39 PageID #: 45\n\nimmigrants eligible for long-term foster careโexactly the group of children in DCSโs careโand \nto provide a pathway for them to obtain lawful permanent resident (LPR) status and United \nStates citizenship. For children in Tennessee, the SIJS process must begin before a child turns \n18; otherwise, the opportunity is lost forever. As the childrenโs legal guardian, DCS is uniquely \npositioned to access the necessary documents and information to pursue this form of relief, and \noften has custody of the children during the only time period when they are able to start the \nprocess. DCS has a duty to support children pursuing this legal pathway as quickly as possible, \nand certainly before children turn 18 and the door to SIJS is closed forever.  \n5.  Immigrant children without legal status in DCSโs care have a constitutionally \nprotected interest in applying for SIJS. SIJS is a non-discretionary right that provides these \nchildren with access to many benefits that they would not have otherwise, including access to \nfederal funds, protection from removal, and a path to citizenship. Far from safeguarding \nimmigrant childrenโs access to SIJS, DCS has engaged in a pattern and practice of obstructing \nchildrenโs pathway to SIJS.  \n6.  Currently, DCS has no policies or procedures to identify youth eligible for SIJS. It \nconsistently fails to address the immigration-related needs of these children when it purports to \nplan for their futures. And, it does not provide immigration-related services to ensure that \neligible youth have the opportunity to apply for SIJS.  \n7.  Like all children in DCS custody, immigrant children are entitled to the \nopportunity to โreach their full potential as productive, competent and healthy adults.โ  Tenn. \nCode ยง 37-5-102(a). DCS is aware that for immigrant children in its custody, this opportunity \nrequires taking steps to become a legal resident. In fact, its own Independent Living Handbook, \nprovided to older youth preparing to transition out of DCSโs care, advises that they do just that. \n2 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 3 of 39 PageID #: 46\n\nBut due to DCSโs failures, many immigrant children age out of DCS custody in a far worse \nposition than they enteredโhaving lost their most promising opportunity to become a U.S. \ncitizen. As a result, these youth are at an increased risk of being deported. \n8.  This civil rights action seeks declaratory and prospective injunctive relief on \nbehalf of Named Plaintiffs, youth B.R., L.T., and A.B., through their Next Friends, and a class of \nsimilarly situated immigrant youth in Tennessee DCS custody (โthe Putative Classโ or โthe \nClassโ), as well as Organizational Plaintiff Advocates for Immigrant Rights (โAIRโ), for \nviolations of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution by Defendant Margie Quin, acting in her official capacity as Commissioner of \nDCS.1  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n9.  This action is brought under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 because Defendant, acting under \ncolor of state law, has deprived Plaintiffs, and the Class members they represent, of rights \nsecured by the United States Constitution.  \n10.  This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action under 28 U.S.C. \nยง 1331 (federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. ยง 1343(a)(3) (civil rights jurisdiction). \n11.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b). Defendant is sued in \nher official capacity and performs her official duties by and through offices within the District, \nand a substantial part of the events and omissions giving rise to the claims herein occurred in this \nDistrict. For example, Named Plaintiffs B.R. and L.T. reside in this District. Further, AIR \nroutinely serves clients in this District. \n                                              \n1 Due to the highly sensitive nature of the issues in this case, Named Plaintiffs will be filing a \nmotion for leave to proceed using pseudonymous initials. \n3 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 4 of 39 PageID #: 47\n\nPARTIES \n \nI.  NAMED PLAINTIFFS \nA.  Plaintiff B.R. \n12.  B.R. is a 15-year-old girl currently in the custody of DCS. \n13.  B.R. was born in Guatemala and is a citizen of Guatemala. \n14.  In November 2021, B.R. entered the United States as an unaccompanied minor. \nShe was initially taken into the custody of the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, then \nreleased to the care of her uncle in Maryland. She subsequently moved to Tennessee to live with \nrelatives. \n15.  In October 2022, Tennessee Child Protective Services began an investigation into \nB.R.โs living situation. She was pregnant at the time and subsequently gave birth to her child. \n16.  In November 2022, the juvenile court in Nashville entered an order finding that \nthere was an immediate threat of harm to B.R. and placed B.R. in DCS custody. The juvenile \ncourt appointed Nora El-Chaer as B.R.โs guardian ad litem. \n17.  DCS served a petition on all parties alleging that B.R. is a dependent and \nneglected child. \n18.  DCS placed B.R. and her baby in a foster home outside of Nashville, where they \nare currently living. DCSโs permanency plan for B.R. is long-term foster care. Meanwhile, B.R. \nis attending high school. It is not in B.R.โs best interests to return to Guatemala due to safety \nconcerns and abandonment by her parents. She wishes to remain in the United States with her \nchild and become a U.S. citizen.  \n19.  Based on B.R.โs factual circumstances, she is likely eligible for SIJS. B.R. meets \nthe requirements for SIJS because she has been found dependent on the state juvenile court, \n4 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 5 of 39 PageID #: 48\n\nreunification with her parents is not viable because of abandonment, and it is not in her best \ninterests to return to Guatemala. \n20.  Despite knowledge that B.R. is a recent immigrant who does not yet have legal \nimmigration status, DCS, her legal guardian, fails to have policies and procedures to address \nB.R.โs immigration-related needs. As a result, DCS has not assisted her with obtaining any forms \nof immigration relief. DCS has not informed B.R., her guardian ad litem, or her foster parent \nabout her immigration-related needs or her likely eligibility for SIJS. And, DCS has not filed any \npetitions for immigration relief on B.R.โs behalf. DCSโs on-going failure to have policies and \nprocedures to address the immigration-related needs of B.R. and other similarly situated children \nin DCS custody places B.R. at on-going risk of harm. \n21.  Since B.R.โs entry into the foster system, both B.R.โs guardian ad litem and her \nfoster parent have contacted DCS multiple times to seek help with addressing B.R.โs \nimmigration-related needs. They have received no substantive response. DCS staff either stated \nthat they had no knowledge of the situation or that they would look into it, but then failed to \nfollow up. \n22.  Without obtaining immigration relief through SIJS, B.R. is ineligible for many \npublic benefits, including forms of healthcare coverage, student financial aid, and public \nassistance. She also cannot access extended foster care when she turns 18, obtain authorization to \nwork legally, or obtain a driverโs license. She remains at risk of being detained or removed from \nthe country and separated from her baby, who is a U.S. citizen.  \n23.  B.R. has received a notice to appear in immigration court, indicating that the \nfederal government may schedule a removal hearing against her. DCS has taken no steps to \nmonitor this removal case against B.R. or to ensure that her family and attorney are aware of the \n5 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 6 of 39 PageID #: 49\n\nstatus of this case. If B.R. is summoned to appear in immigration court, she risks missing \nhearings or being unprepared for a hearing, which could result in her detention or removal from \nthe country. \n24.  B.R. brings this action through her Next Friend, Nora El-Chaer. \n25.  Ms. El-Chaer is familiar with the facts of B.R.โs case as well as the harms and \nrisks of harm B.R. has suffered while in DCSโs custody. She is dedicated to serving B.R.โs best \ninterests in this litigation. \nB.  Plaintiff A.B. \n26.  A.B. is a 14-year-old boy currently in the custody of DCS. \n27.  A.B. was born in Honduras and is a citizen of Honduras. \n28.  A.B. came to the United States about six years ago with his sister.  \n29.  In 2017, Tennessee Child Protective Services investigated A.B.โs living situation. \nHe was found living alone in a trailer with his siblings with no food, running water, or utilities. \nA.B. came into DCS custody due to allegations of abandonment and neglect.  \n30.  Subsequently, A.B. was adjudicated a dependent child due to abuse and neglect, \nand placed in a foster home in Knoxville. \n31.  DCSโs permanency plan for A.B. is permanent guardianship or adoption. In \nFebruary 2023, A.B. was placed with his current foster family. He has been doing well in this \nplacement. He has been attending high school and has recently gone on summer vacation with \nhis foster family. A.B. hopes to be able to have a part-time job and get a driverโs license \nsomeday, just like other teenagers. It is not in A.B.โs best interests to return to Honduras because \nhe has no known family members there. He wishes to remain in the United States and become a \nU.S. citizen.  \n6 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 7 of 39 PageID #: 50\n\n32.  Based on A.B.โs factual circumstances, he is likely eligible for SIJS. A.B. meets \nthe requirements for SIJS because he has been found dependent on the state juvenile court, \nreunification with his parents is not viable because of abandonment, abuse and/or neglect, and it \nis not in his best interests to return to Honduras. \n33.  Despite knowledge that A.B. is an immigrant who does not yet have legal \nimmigration status, DCS, his legal guardian, fails to have policies and procedures to address \nA.B.โs immigration-related needs. As a result, DCS has not assisted him with obtaining any \nforms of immigration relief. DCS has not assisted A.B. or his foster parent with his immigration-\nrelated needs or educated them about his likely eligibility for SIJS. And, DCS has not filed any \npetitions for immigration relief on A.B.โs behalf. DCSโs on-going failure to have policies and \nprocedures to address the immigration-related needs of A.B. and other similarly situated children \nin DCS custody places A.B. at on-going risk of harm. \n34.  A.B.โs foster parents have asked DCS multiple times for help with addressing \nA.B.โs immigration-related needs, to no avail. In response, DCS staff has repeatedly tried to \nplace the responsibility for meeting A.B.โs immigration-related needs on his guardian ad litem. \nA.B.โs foster parents have made numerous inquiries among their networks in an attempt to find \nhelp for A.B., but in the absence of assistance from DCS, these efforts have not been successful.  \n35.  Without obtaining immigration relief through SIJS, A.B. is ineligible for many \npublic benefits, including forms of healthcare coverage, student financial aid, and public \nassistance. He also cannot access extended foster care when he turns 18, obtain authorization to \nwork legally, or obtain a driverโs license. He remains at risk of being detained or removed from \nthe country.  \n36.  Because he continues to lack legal status, A.B. could also be summoned to appear \n7 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 8 of 39 PageID #: 51\n\nin immigration court for a removal hearing at any time. A.B. does not have an attorney to defend \nhim in a removal hearing. On information and belief, DCS has taken no steps to monitor whether \na removal case has been initiated against A.B. If A.B. is summoned to appear in immigration \ncourt, he risks missing hearings or being unprepared for a hearing, which could result in A.B.โs \ndetention or removal from the country. \n37.  A.B. brings this action through his foster parent and Next Friend, C.B. \n38.  C.B. is familiar with the facts of A.B.โs case as well as the harms and risks of \nharm A.B. has suffered while in DCSโs custody. She is dedicated to serving A.B.โs best interests \nin this litigation. \nC.  Plaintiff L.T.  \n39.  L.T. is an 11-year-old boy currently in the custody of DCS. \n40.  L.T. was born in Honduras and is a citizen of Honduras. \n41.  L.T. came to the United States with family members when he was about five \nyears old. \n42.  L.T. entered DCS custody in November 2021 after his biological mother \nabandoned him at a hospital. \n43.  In May 2022, DCS placed L.T. with his current foster mother, S.T., and her \nhusband, with whom he currently resides.  \n44.  When DCS contacted S.T. seeking placement for L.T., the DCS case manager had \nno knowledge or information about L.T.โs immigration-related needs or how his immigration \nstatus impacted his placement. Because L.T. needed placement immediately, S.T. and her \nhusband agreed to care for him. For the past year, he has been thriving in their home. \n45.  Based on L.T.โs factual circumstances, he is likely eligible for SIJS. L.T. meets \n8 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 9 of 39 PageID #: 52\n\nthe requirements for SIJS because he has been found dependent on the state juvenile court, \nreunification with one of his parents is not viable because of abandonment, and it is not in his \nbest interests to return to Honduras. \n46.  Despite knowledge that L.T. is an immigrant child who does not yet have legal \nimmigration status, DCS, his legal guardian, fails to have policies and procedures to address \nL.T.โs immigration-related needs. As a result, DCS repeatedly ignored his foster motherโs \nrequests for information about his immigration-related needs, causing unnecessary delays in the \nSIJS process. These delays have led to challenges in L.T.โs ability to access health services, and \nhave impeded S.T. in her own efforts to obtain immigration relief for L.T. DCSโs on-going \nfailure to have policies and procedures to address the immigration-related needs of L.T. and \nother similarly situated children in DCS custody places L.T. at on-going risk of harm. \n47.  When S.T. attempted to communicate with DCS about L.T.โs immigration-related \nneeds, DCS either failed to respond to her at all or told her that they did not know anything about \nit. Months would pass by with no visitation from a DCS case manager or response to requests for \nassistance. DCSโs lack of training, knowledge, and support of L.T.โs immigration-related needs \nhas resulted in L.T. being denied access to needed services, such as healthcare, translation \nservices, and legal services.  \n48.  For example, on information and belief, DCS has failed to pay L.T.โs healthcare \nbills in a timely manner. Because L.T. is not eligible for TennCare due to his immigration status, \nDCS must pay for L.T.โs healthcare services directly. When S.T. took L.T. to the dentist for a \nscheduled appointment in August 2022, the dentist refused to treat him until DCS paid an \noutstanding balance of $1,400 that had remained unpaid for months. Despite months of inquiries \nby S.T., DCS did not pay this bill until January 2023, resulting in delayed access to healthcare. \n9 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 10 of 39 PageID #: 53\n\nSince then, DCS has failed to pay other bills, resulting in continued difficulties for L.T. and S.T. \n49.  DCS has also failed to provide a Spanish-language interpreter for L.T.โs \nsupervised visits with his birth mother, even though interpretation is necessary for supervision. \nS.T. has had to find interpretation elsewhere, despite this not being the responsibility of a foster \nparent. \n50.  After DCS failed to take any steps to secure an immigration attorney for L.T., \nS.T. began conducting her own research about L.T.โs immigration-related needs. Through her \nresearch, S.T. learned about the possibility of applying for SIJS immigration relief for L.T. When \nS.T. asked DCS about SIJS, DCS staff had no knowledge of the program. DCS staff told S.T. \nthat she was welcome to pursue this immigration relief for L.T. on her own. S.T. has \nindependently retained an immigration attorney to work on L.T.โs SIJS case pro bono. \n51.  DCS has impeded S.T.โs attempts to help L.T. obtain immigration relief by failing \nto timely provide essential documents and by incorrectly recording L.T.โs birth date when he \ncame into their custody then failing to address the error, which is likely to cause continued \ndifficulties in L.T.โs immigration case. \n52.  Because he continues to lack legal status, L.T. could also be summoned to appear \nin immigration court for a removal hearing at any time. L.T. does not have an attorney to defend \nhim in a removal hearing, which is separate from the affirmative SIJS application. DCS has \ntaken no steps to monitor whether a removal case has been initiated against L.T. If L.T. is \nsummoned to appear in immigration court, he and his foster family risk missing hearings or \nbeing unprepared for a hearing, which could result in L.T.โs detention or removal from the \ncountry.  \n53.  L.T. brings this action through his Next Friend, S.T. S.T. is L.T.โs current foster \n10 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 11 of 39 PageID #: 54\n\nparent and has cared for him for over a year. \n54.  S.T. is familiar with the facts of L.T.โs case as well as the harms and risks of harm \nL.T. has suffered while in DCSโs custody. She is dedicated to serving L.T.โs best interests in this \nlitigation. \nII.  ORGANIZATIONAL PLAINTIFF \n55.  Advocates for Immigrant Rights (AIR) is a non-profit law firm located in \nMemphis, Tennessee. \n56.  AIRโs mission โis to fight for the dignity, safety, and inclusion of immigrants in \nthe United States, especially those most marginalized, through legal representation and \nadvocacy.โ2 AIR provides affordable legal services, as well as non-legal support services, to \nimmigrants. AIRโs legal practice focuses primarily on removal defense, but the firm also \nrepresents individuals filing affirmative applications for immigration status. AIR represents \npeople of all ages and family situations, including children and youth in the foster system, who \nare eligible to apply for SIJS. \n57.  In recent years, AIR has provided immigration legal assistance to children in DCS \ncustody. AIR learns of foster youthsโ cases from various sources, including parents, foster \nparents, community members, and guardians ad litem. Many youth in need of immigration legal \nservices come to AIRโs attention when the youth are close to aging out of foster care, \nnecessitating immediate action in order to have any chance of obtaining SIJS relief. AIR has also \nencountered youth who have aged out of DCS custody without ever obtaining SIJS relief, thus \nlosing access to that immigration status pathway forever. \n58.  AIR receives funding from several sources, including grants. These grants have \n                                              \n2 Advocates for Immigrant Rights, https://www.airlegal.org/ (last visited July 21, 2023).  \n11 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 12 of 39 PageID #: 55\n\nperformance requirements that must be met, not only to maintain the grant, but also to have the \npotential of obtaining future funding support.

Special Immigrant Juvenile Status  \n63.  Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS) is an immigration classification created \nby Congress in 1990 to provide humanitarian protection for abused, neglected, or abandoned \nchild immigrants eligible for long-term foster care, and provide a pathway for them to obtain \n12 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 13 of 39 PageID #: 56\n\nlawful permanent resident (LPR) status and United States citizenship.3 \n64.   SIJS is available for a noncitizen child present in the United States who: \na.  โhas been declared dependent on a juvenile court located in the United \nStates or whom such a court has legally committed to, or placed under the custody of, an \nagency or department of a State, or an individual or entity appointed by a State or \njuvenile court located in the United States, and whose reunification with 1 or both of the \nimmigrantโs parents is not viable due to abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis \nfound under State law,โ 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(27)(J)(i); \nb.  โfor whom it has been determined in administrative or judicial \nproceedings that it would not be in the [childโs] best interest to be returned to the [childโs] \nor parentโs previous country of nationality or country of last habitual residence,โ id. ยง \n1101(a)(27)(J)(ii); and \nc.  โin whose case the Secretary of Homeland Security consents to the grant \nof special immigrant juvenile status,โ id. ยง 1101(a)(27)(J)(iii). \n65.  It is common practice for attorneys representing potentially SIJS-eligible children \nin state juvenile court dependency or similar state proceedings to request findings from the \njuvenile court regarding whether it would be in the childโs best interest to be removed from the \nUnited States. The juvenile court judge typically makes such findings in the dependency order, \ncalled a โSIJS Predicate Order.โ \n66.  In Tennessee, a child must obtain a SIJS Predicate Order from the juvenile court \nbefore turning 18 years old to obtain SIJS. This is because Tennessee juvenile court jurisdiction \n                                              \n3 See 6 USCIS Policy Manual, Pt. J, Ch. 1, https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-\nj-chapter-1. \n13 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 14 of 39 PageID #: 57\n\nends once an individual turns 18, except for in certain circumstances generally inapplicable to \nyouth in the Class. See Tenn. Code ยง 37-1-102(b)(5). \n67.  Obtaining a SIJS Predicate Order is key for foster youth who do not have legal \nimmigration status. Once a child has a SIJS Predicate Order, the child can file a SIJS petition \nwith United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) seeking recognition as a \nSpecial Immigrant Juvenile. \n68.  Applying for SIJS confers many benefits. A pending SIJS application allows a \nyouth to access certain benefits, such as the use of the federal health insurance marketplace.4 In \ncontrast, before they obtain SIJS, immigrant children in foster care without legal status are \nineligible for certain forms of health care coverage. For example, immigrant children without \nlegal status are ineligible for medical care coverage, except emergency care and childbirth \nservices, and are not eligible for health care benefits through the Affordable Care Act. \n69.  An approved SIJS petition confers further critical benefits. Once approved, youth \nwith SIJS are โdeemed . . . to have been paroled into the United States.โ 8 U.S.C. ยง 1255(h)(1). \nMoreover, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) automatically exempts youth with SIJS \nfrom several types of inadmissibility that would otherwise prevent them from becoming a LPR. \nSee id. ยง 1255(h)(2)(A). These waivers of inadmissibility reflect Congressโs intent that children \nwith SIJS are not considered priorities for immigration enforcement.5  \n                                              \n4 See HealthCare.gov, Immigration status and the Marketplace, \nhttps://www.healthcare.gov/immigrants/immigration-status/ (last visited July 21, 2023); Division \nof TennCare Families and Children Manual No. 005.015, Qualified Non-Citizens (May 2, 2022) \nat 3, https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tenncare/documents/QualifiedNon-Citizens.pdf \n(children with a pending SIJS petition are eligible for the federally facilitated marketplace (FFM) \nbut unable to receive TennCare Medicaid or CoverKids benefits.). \n5 See USCIS Policy Alert PA-2022-10 (Mar. 7, 2022), Special Immigrant Juvenile Classification \nand Deferred Action, https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/policy-manual-\n \n14 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 15 of 39 PageID #: 58\n\n70.  One of the types of inadmissibility that is waived for youth with SIJS is the public \ncharge provision. 8 U.S.C. ยง 1182(a)(4). This is particularly important for youth in DCS custody \nbecause, without SIJS, the very fact that they have been separated from their family could \ncontribute to a finding that they are ineligible for a visa.  \n71.  An approved SIJS petition also allows a young person to obtain a work permit and \nidentification.6 These documents are critical to the wellbeing of a young person, especially once \nthey exit foster care. Without a work permit, young people may be unable to provide for \nthemselves financially, or else be forced to accept unauthorized jobs in which they are easily \nexploited and underpaid. \n72.  Additionally, youth with SIJS may receive various forms of support within the \nUnited States, such as access to federally funded educational programming, and preferential \nstatus when seeking employment-based visas.7 See 8 U.S.C. ยงยง 1232(d)(4)(A), 1153(b)(4). \n73.  SIJS also allows youth to qualify for extended foster care services when they \nwould otherwise age out of foster care.8  These benefits for certain young adults ages 18 through \n21 include education and training vouchers of up to $5,000 per year; placement support or an \n                                              \nupdates/20220307-SIJAndDeferredAction.pdf.

While Extension of Foster Care benefits are optional for the youth, DCS \noffers them because โDCS wants to assist in the transition in order for . . . youth and young \nadults to become more confident, productive individuals in society and achieve lifelong \nsuccess.โ9  In fact, DCS provides these services because it believes โ18 is too young for someone \nto be on their own.โ10   \n74.  Nationally, youth who access these services experience better outcomes than \nyouth who age out of foster care at 18. For example, youth who age out of foster care at age 18 \nare less likely to graduate high school, less likely to be employed, more likely to be homeless, \nand more likely to become involved with the criminal legal system. By contrast, young adults \nwho have the benefit of extended foster care tend to experience better outcomes: they are more \nlikely to be employed and enroll or stay enrolled in school, and less likely to become young \nparents. They are also more likely to be connected to services critical for their successful \ntransition to adulthood. Youth who receive extended foster care benefits are more likely to have \nadditional funds in their bank accounts, less likely to experience food insecurity, and more likely \nto feel that they have enough people to turn to for social support. \n75.  The benefits conferred by SIJS also include the ability to apply for lawful \npermanent resident (LPR) status. 8 U.S.C. ยง 1255(h). LPR status is the most stable legal status \nshort of citizenship. An LPR may live permanently in the United States without being subject to \n                                              \n9 Id. \n10 Id. at l. \n16 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 17 of 39 PageID #: 60\n\nthe risk of detention and removal. By contrast, people who lack legal status, including children, \nare at risk of being detained and removed at any time. \n76.  LPR status confers many benefits. An LPR may obtain lawful employment, \nqualify for federal student aid, and travel internationally and return to the United States. A new \nLPR may also become eligible for public benefits such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI), \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), federal Medicaid, Temporary Assistance to \nNeedy Families (TANF), and the Child Health Insurance Program (CHIP) after five years. At \nage 18 and after five years of being an LPR, a youth may also apply for naturalization and \ncontinue their path to United States citizenship. The sooner the five-year period begins, the \nsooner the youth will have access to critical resources and benefits. People who lack legal status \nare denied access to these essential activities and benefits. \n77.  SIJS may be the only chance many immigrant children have to obtain LPR status. \n78.  If a child without legal status in Tennessee does not obtain a SIJS Predicate Order \nbefore turning 18, despite having been eligible for SIJS, that child permanently loses the chance \nto obtain SIJS. Even if a child obtains a SIJS Predicate Order, they must still file a SIJS petition \nbefore turning 21. Otherwise, they will lose their chance to obtain SIJS. \n79.  Finally, SIJS is not a discretionary benefit. Once granted, it may not be revoked \nexcept โon notice,โ 8 C.F.R. ยง 205.2, and upon the Governmentโs compliance with a series of \nprocedural safeguards: The Secretary of Homeland Security must find โgood and sufficient \ncauseโ for revocation; the agency must provide notice of intent to revoke; and the individual with \nSIJS must be given the opportunity to present evidence opposing revocation.11 See 8 U.S.C. ยง \n                                              \n11 See also 7 USCIS Policy Manual, Pt.

The individual with SIJS also has the right to appeal any adverse ruling, \ninitially to the Associate Commissioner for Examinations, and then to the extent the child claims \nhe or she โsuffer[ed] legal wrong because of agency action,โ to the federal courts. See 8 C.F.R. ยง \n205.2(d); 5 U.S.C. ยง 702. \n80.  Additionally, when an application is denied, the government officer is required to \nโexplain in writing the specific reasons for denial.โ 8 C.F.R. ยง 103.3(a)(1)(i).

See Tenn. Code ยง 37-1-102(b)(13). \n82.  If a Tennessee juvenile court finds a child to be dependent and neglected, that \ncourt may transfer temporary legal custody or grant permanent guardianship of the child to DCS. \nId. ยง 37-1-130(a)(2)(B). \n83.

Over the last decade, Tennessee has had one of the fastest growing immigrant \npopulations across the country. Since 2016, more than 16,000 unaccompanied children have \nbeen released from the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement to sponsors, typically family \nmembers, in Tennessee.14 More than half of those children have been released since 2020.15  \n87.  Children in DCS custody who lack legal immigration status face the intersecting \nstresses of navigating the stateโs foster care system and the federal immigration system. These \nyouth typically have already fled abuse, neglect, and violence in their home country. They often \ncrossed continents by foot, by bus, or on the tops of trains to seek safety in the United States, \nwith many experiencing harm on their journey. Many have already experienced the trauma of \n                                              \n14 U.S. Depโt of Health & Hum.

Once released to family members, these youth \noften face language and educational barriers.  \n88.  By virtue of being in the foster care system, these youth have also typically \nexperienced the trauma of being separated from their families in the United States. The foster \nsystem then often shuffles them between multiple out-of-home placements, depriving them of a \ncritical sense of stability, permanency, and safety. Because they are excluded from federal \nadoption assistance funding, immigrant youth who lack legal immigration status are less likely to \nfind permanent homes through guardianship or adoption, and therefore are more likely to age out \nof foster care than non-immigrant youth.  \n89.  DCS is aware of the special challenges facing these youth. DCSโs Independent \nLiving Handbook states that any foster youth who has not yet applied for immigration status \nโshould start the paperwork to establish [themselves] as a legal resident.โ16 The Handbook warns \nthat โ[n]ot being a resident makes it hard to get a job or pay for school. Immigrants who donโt \nhave lawful status are not eligible for some government services such as TennCare and could be \ndeported. The application process is long, so apply early.โ17 The Independent Living Handbook \ncontinues, โ[i]f you live in the United States, but are not a legal citizen or [LPR] and are in the \nfoster care system, you or your case manager should have applied for [SIJS] for you. This status \nlets you stay in the United States permanently after you leave foster care.โ18 Despite knowledge \nof the importance of SIJS, DCS has no policies or procedures in place to ensure eligible youth in \nits custody are able to timely seek SIJS. \n                                              \n16 Tenn.

DCSโS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FAIL TO MEET THE NEEDS OF \nIMMIGRANT CHILDREN IN TENNESSEE FOSTER CARE AND DEPRIVE \nTHEM OF THEIR PROTECTED INTEREST IN APPLYING FOR SIJS \nA.  DCS fails to consider childrenโs critical immigration-related legal needs in its \npolicies and procedures. \n \n90.  DCS is responsible for administering federal funding through Titles IV-B and IV-\nE of the Social Security Act, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, and the Chafee \nFoster Care Independence Program.  \n91.  Federal law obligates any state receiving federal funding for foster care and \nadoption assistance programs to have procedures to verify the citizenship or immigration status \nof each child in foster care. 42 U.S.C. ยง 671(a)(27). As the designated agency, DCS is legally \nrequired to keep track of the immigration status of children in its custody. \n92.  DCS has a comprehensive child welfare information system, called the Tennessee \nFamily and Child Tracking System (โTFACTSโ).19 TFACTS is designed to track, among other \nthings, the immigration status of youth in DCS care, and DCS is aware of this ability.20 DCSโs \nChild Welfare Benefits Unitโs Policy and Procedures Manual (July 2017) instructs DCS staff to \nโ[d]etermine whether the child meets Citizenship and Qualified Alien Status requirements.โ21 \nThis is for the stated purpose of determining whether the child is โeligible for Title IV-E Foster \nCare,โ not whether the child has immigration-related needs that must be addressed.22 Upon \n                                              \n19 Tenn.

Upon information and belief, in spite of DCSโs legal requirement to keep track of \nthe immigration status of children in its custody and its ability to do so, DCS does not track the \nimmigration status or SIJS applications for youth in foster care. In April 2023, DCS admitted in \nresponse to a public records request that it did not keep records regarding how many children \nwithout legal status in its custody had received SIJS Predicate Orders. DCS similarly admitted it \ndid not keep records on the number of children without legal status who exited DCS custody \nwithin the previous three years without first obtaining a SIJS Predicate Order. DCS also admitted \nthat it did not keep records regarding whether DCS attorneys, or other attorneys not employed by \nDCS, represented children in seeking SIJS Predicate Orders. \n94.  As of April 2023, DCS continued to lack any policies, training materials, \nguidance, or procedures on screening youth to determine eligibility for immigration relief.  \n95.  On information and belief, DCS also lacks policies and procedures to identify, \ndocument, and determine appropriate services for children who are or are at risk of being victims \nof sex trafficking, as required by federal law. See 42 U.S.C. ยง 671(a)(9)(C)(i)(I). If such policies \nand procedures were in place, DCS would be able to identify victims of sex trafficking, as well \nas victims of other types of trafficking, such as labor trafficking. DCS lacks such policies and \nprocedures even though doing so could provide the child with additional options for immigration \nrelief and access to critical public benefits.23   \n                                              \n23 See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(15)(T) (T-Visas), (U) (U-Visas); 28 C.F.R. ยง 1100.35 (Continued \nPresence); see also USCIS, Victims of Human Trafficking: T Nonimmigrant Status, \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/victims-of-human-trafficking-t-nonimmigrant-status (last \nupdated Oct. 20, 2021).  \n22 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 23 of 39 PageID #: 66\n\n96.  On information and belief, DCS also does not have policies and procedures to \ntrack the removal cases of youth in its custody, including whether they need to appear in \nimmigration court or have been ordered removed. \n97.  In addition to failing to track childrenโs immigration status, DCS routinely fails to \naddress these youthโs immigration-related needs while in DCS custody. DCS recognizes and \ninstructs case managers that, starting when the youth is 14 years old, โthe immigration category \nmust be addressed when the youth is undocumented . . . or the youthโs status to remain legally in \nthe U.S. is otherwise in doubt or in jeopardy.โ24 However, on information and belief, DCS has no \npolicies regarding the steps to be taken to address the immigration-related needs of youth in its \ncustody and routinely fails to provide any assistance to youth in its custody on immigration \nmatters before they begin transitioning to adulthood. \n98.  DCS also fails to provide adequate immigration assistance to youth in its custody \nwho are transitioning into adulthood, which is the last opportunity for youth without legal status \nto obtain SIJS. In its 2020-2024 Child and Family Service Plan, DCS asserts that โ[t]ransition \nplanning for all young people in DCS custody addresses Social Skills, Life Skills, Education, \nHousing, Employment, Essential Documents, Credit Check, Health, Finances, and \nTransportation. Additionally, special concerns including immigration and parenting are included \nin the transition planning process when appropriate.โ25 \n99.  DCS acknowledges that immigration planning should be provided when the youth \nturns 17 years old.26 However, on information and belief, DCS routinely does not engage in \n                                              \n24 Tenn.

In the absence of policies and procedures, DCS case managers rarely provide \nyouth with helpful information about immigration issues.

DCS maintains an Essential \nDocuments Checklist, which states that โ[a]mong the most necessary documents for transitioning \nyoung people are: State-issued identification card, Social Security card, Medical records, \nincluding immunization record, TennCare card and healthcare.gov information, Birth certificate, \nReligious documents and information, if applicable, Documentation of immigration or \n                                              \n27 Child and Family Service Plan 2020 โ 2024, supra note 19; see also Tenn. Depโt of Child. \nServ., Appendix D: 2020, \nhttps://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/dcs/documents/quality_improvement/cfsr/AppxD_Training_\nPlan.pdf.  \n \n25 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 26 of 39 PageID #: 69\n\nnaturalization, if applicable, . . . Green card, if applicable, . . .Work permit, if needed.โ28 DCS \nfurther states that โ[b]est practice and policy make clear that young people transitioning from \nfoster care must receive their essential documents or be supported in obtaining them.โ29 \n108.  An examination of these essential documents or a discovery that a youth does not \nhave some of their essential documents, such as a U.S. birth certificate, would make the need for \nimmigration planning apparent to a case manager with basic knowledge of immigration issues. \n109.  In addition to being unaware of how to identify immigration issues, DCS case \nmanagers generally do not know the options and potential consequences facing immigrant youth \nwho do not timely apply for immigration benefits. Without basic knowledge about the \nimmigration-related needs of the youth in their care, DCS case managers often fail to take steps \nto address immigration-related needs in a timely manner, if at all. DCS case managers also fail to \nadvise foster parents on the challenges youth in their care face accessing needed services, such as \nhealth care, translation, and immigration-related legal services.  \n110.  In addition, DCS case managers receive no training on the need to monitor \npotential removal cases against youth in their care, which can result in youth missing hearings \nand ultimately being removed from the country. \n111.  When immigration-related needs are identified, often just before a child will age \nout, DCS case managers frequently ask staff at AIR or other non-profit organizations questions \nthat evidence a lack of even basic knowledge about childrenโs immigration-related needs. \n112.  Different DCS representatives also ask AIR the same questions multiple times, \nwhich further delays each youthโs application, and unnecessarily diverts AIRโs resources from its \n                                              \n28 Tenn. Depโt of Child. Serv., Essential Documents Checklist, https://www.tn.gov/dcs/program-\nareas/youth-in-transition/youth-resources/essential-documents-checklist.html.  \n29 Id. \n26 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 27 of 39 PageID #: 70\n\nprimary work of removal defense cases and other applications. These interactions between AIR \nand DCS, which can continue for months, evidence a lack of uniform training or procedures with \nrespect to childrenโs immigration-related needs within DCS. \n113.  Those children whom AIR is able to assist urgently are fortunate. However, many \nimmigrant children who are entitled to SIJS are not identified until it is too late. As a result of \nDCSโs failure to train case managers to identify and address immigration-related needs, \nimmigrant youth in foster care often miss their opportunity to apply for immigration benefits \nbefore aging out of foster care, permanently closing the door to SIJS relief. \nC.  DCS routinely interferes with the timely submission and adjudication of SIJS \napplications without providing children under their care due process.  \n \n114.  Even when DCS is aware of youthsโ immigration-related needs, and despite \nDCSโs own acknowledgement of the importance of SIJS, DCS routinely fails to seek SIJS on \nbehalf of eligible youth. In some cases, DCS takes actions that harm youthsโ immigration cases. \n115.  DCS lacks policies or procedures to ensure that eligible youth obtain SIJS \nPredicate Orders from Tennessee courts. \n116.  DCS also lacks policies or procedures to ensure that youth who have obtained a \nSIJS Predicate Order are able to file SIJS petitions with USCIS. \n117.  Even when notified about immigration concerns by adult advocates, DCS often \ntakes no action. Adults such as Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASAs), guardians ad \nlitem, foster parents, mental health service providers, immigration lawyers, or family members \nfrequently reach out to DCS to notify DCS of a youthโs immigration legal needs but receive no \nreply. Attorneys from AIR have, in some cases, contacted DCS repeatedly about the necessary \nsteps to obtain SIJS for a child in DCS custody without receiving a response from DCS for over \na year. \n27 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 28 of 39 PageID #: 71\n\n118.  By virtue of being in DCS custody, these youth do not have access to other adults \nto help them file for SIJS. \n119.  Immigration attorneys working pro bono attempt to fill the gap in legal assistance, \nbut do not have the capacity to support all of the children in DCS custody in need of immigration \nlegal services. Adding to immigration attorneysโ difficulty, DCS refuses to compensate attorneys \nwho provide necessary immigration legal services to children in its custody, including AIR. \n120.  DCS takes other steps that harm a childโs chances of obtaining SIJS. DCS \nroutinely fails to provide essential documents, such as birth certificates, to pro bono attorneys \nworking to secure SIJS for youth in DCS custody, despite multiple requests. Upon information \nand belief, youth in DCS custody have limited, if any, ability to obtain essential documents \nelsewhere. Without these documents, youth and their attorneys are unable to file SIJS \napplications. \n121.  DCS also routinely fails to assist with obtaining medical examinations legally \nrequired to be conducted as part of a youthโs permanent residency application. \n122.  On information and belief, DCS has no policies or procedures to ensure that youth \nare transported to immigration court for necessary hearings, even though many youth in DCS \ncustody have no other way to attend, or even know that they need to attend, these hearings. \n123.  Failure to attend an immigration court hearing can result in an order of removal \nissued against a child in absentia. \n124.  DCS has the technical capabilities to regularly track this informationโit simply \nchooses not to do so. This failure seriously impacts children throughout Tennessee. In 2023, \nupon request, DCS was able to determine that 99 youth in DCS custody, spread across 25 \nTennessee counties, had no lawful immigration status as of October 30, 2022. Further, DCS was \n28 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 29 of 39 PageID #: 72\n\nable to determine that 35 youth had exited DCS custody without lawful immigration status \nbetween November 1, 2021 and October 31, 2022 due to reaching the age of 18. All of these \nyouth permanently lost the opportunity to apply for SIJS. These youth had spent an average of 13 \nmonths in DCSโs care, with several children spending years in custody before aging out.  \nIV.  DCSโs Actions and Inactions Seriously Harm Plaintiffs. \nA.  DCSโs actions and inactions seriously harm children in the Class. \n125.  As a result of the failures alleged above, DCS puts SIJS-eligible youth at risk of \nlosing their chance to apply for SIJS relief before aging out of custody, failing to appear at \nscheduled immigration court hearings, failing to collect essential materials to support an \napplication for immigration relief, and failing to obtain access to critical services and benefits as \nthey transition to adulthood.  \n126.  DCSโs failures seriously harm youth in the Class, who face the constant risk of \nbeing detained and ordered deported after aging out of foster care without obtaining SIJS. The \nconstant fear of deportation only further compounds the traumas these youth have already \nexperienced by virtue of lacking legal immigration status and being in the foster care system, \nrisking further harm to their emotional and mental health.  \n127.  Youth who age out of foster care without obtaining SIJS lose out on their most \npromising pathway to lawful employment. Without the ability to work lawfully, these youth risk \nbeing unable to transition to independent adulthood. Lack of access to most public benefits \nfurther exacerbates the difficulty in obtaining basic necessities, such as food and stable housing. \nAs a result, youth unable to obtain SIJS face poverty, exploitation, dependency on abusive \nadults, and limited socioeconomic mobilityโthe harms SIJS was created to avoid. \n128.  The inability to access federal financial aid for higher education further risks \nthwarting the successful transition to adulthood for youth who age out of foster care without \n29 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 30 of 39 PageID #: 73\n\nobtaining SIJS. Youth without legal status in Tennessee cannot access in-state college tuition, \nstate financial aid, professional or occupational licensure, or driversโ licenses or other state \nidentification. \n129.  A lack of stable employment and housing also puts youth at risk of having their \nown children removed by DCS. SIJS-eligible youth in DCSโs custody are therefore at greater \nrisk of facing the trauma of having their own family torn apart a second time and being further \ncaught in the foster care system. \n130.  Without SIJS, youth do not have the opportunity to apply for extended foster care \nand must face all of these challenges alone as soon as they turn 18, even if they would have \notherwise qualified for and pursued extended foster care benefits. \n131.  The fear of deportation, the stresses of being involved in the immigration system, \nand the lack of access to most medical coverage negatively impacts the physical health of youth \nwithout legal status as well. \n132.  If ultimately deported, these youth face even graver risks of being removed to a \ncountry where they lack family or community connections, and potentially face dangerous \nconditions.  \n133.  By failing to meet the needs of SIJS-eligible youth, DCS exacerbates all of these \nserious risks, undermining the goals of the child welfare system: safety, permanency, and well-\nbeing.  \nB.  DCSโs actions and inactions harm AIR. \n134.  As a result of the failures alleged above, DCS also forces AIR to divert its limited \nresources to address the immigration-related needs of SIJS-eligible youth in DCS custody. \nResources spent addressing foster youthsโ immigration-related needs harms AIRโs ability to \nwork on the removal defense cases that are the primary focus of the organization. \n30 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 31 of 39 PageID #: 74\n\n135.  Because of DCSโs lack of policies and procedures, belated and ineffective \nplanning, and lack of case manager training, AIR often learns about a youthโs immigration-\nrelated needs when those needs are very urgent. AIR therefore is forced to divert its resources \naway from other active matters on an urgent and unpredictable basis to provide necessary legal \naid to youth in DCS custody. \n136.  Even when AIR learns about the urgent immigration-related needs of youth in \nDCS custody and determines it can provide legal assistance, DCS routinely fails to provide AIR \nwith necessary information or documents, resulting in lengthy delays in highly time-sensitive \ncases. AIR is forced to expend additional resources by repeatedly contacting DCS to obtain \nmaterials and services needed for preparing a SIJS application, such as essential documents and \ntransportation. The amount of AIR staff time spent on applications for children in DCS custody \nis therefore higher than the amount of time required to represent other SIJS-eligible children. \n137.  AIR must further divert resources from its regular work to assist DCS case \nmanagers who, without adequate training, repeatedly ask AIR staff the same basic questions \nabout immigration cases. In AIRโs experience, there is no official point of contact at DCS \nregarding foster youthsโ immigration cases. Instead, AIR staff must expend AIRโs resources \ndealing with multiple DCS representatives for each case, spending time to explain the same \nissues to each new DCS representative they encounter. Diverting resources from other cases risks \nharming AIRโs other vulnerable clients.  \n138.  AIR staff have significant difficulty arranging necessary appointments with their \nclients in DCS custody because of delays or unresponsiveness by DCS.  \n31 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 32 of 39 PageID #: 75\n\n139.  DCS has not compensated AIR or its attorneys for immigration legal services \nprovided to youth in its custody. Accepting unfunded cases for pro bono representation on the \nscale that DCS requires simply is not possible for AIR.  \n140.  DCSโs actions and inactions harm AIRโs ability to serve SIJS-eligible youth and \nother clients with urgent immigration-related needs. All of this implicates AIRโs ability to meet \nits performance requirements, putting its ability to maintain grants and obtain future funding \nsupport in jeopardy.  \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n141.  Named Plaintiffs B.R., L.T., and A.B. bring this action as a class action pursuant \nto Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and \na class of similarly situated youth.  \n142.  This action is properly maintained as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and \n23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n143.  Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and the following Class for \ninjunctive relief, based on violations of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution, as applied through 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983: All immigrant children under the age of 18 in \nDCS custody who are eligible to apply for SIJS. Named Plaintiffs are members of and represent \nthis Class. \n144.  The deficiencies in the care and services provided to children without legal status \ndescribed above, and the resulting risks to the children in the Class, arise from Defendantโs \npolicies, procedures, patterns, and/or practices, including the following: \na.  Defendantโs failure to consider childrenโs critical immigration-related \nneeds in DCSโs policies and procedures; \n32 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 33 of 39 PageID #: 76\n\nb.  Defendantโs failure to train case managers to understand immigration \nissues facing youth in their care; and \nc.  Defendantโs failure to ensure eligible youth are able to apply for SIJS. \n145.  As a result, the children in the Class are subject to serious harm and risk, \nincluding the following:  \na.  Their immigration-related needs are not identified in a timely manner;  \nb.  They are unable to take steps to secure lawful status to which they are entitled \nbecause their access to documents, legal resources, and transportation is \ncontrolled and limited by DCS;  \nc.  As a result of aging out of DCS custody without immigration documentation, \nthey are unable to work lawfully or obtain public benefits to which they would \notherwise be entitled; and  \nd.  They are under constant threat of detention and removal to unsafe conditions \nand the resulting separation from their families and communities in the United \nStates. \n146.  The Class is sufficiently numerous to make joinder impracticable. The exact \nnumber of members of the proposed Class is unknown and not available to Plaintiffs at this time, \nbut as of October 30, 2022, there were 99 children without legal status in DCS custody of whom \nDCS was aware. The true number of children without legal status is likely higher because DCS \ndoes not reliably verify childrenโs immigration status. Other factors that make joinder \nimpracticable include the fluid nature of the Class, the geographically diverse Class members, \nthe limited financial resources of Class members, the unknown identity of future Class members, \nand Defendantโs discretion with respect to service provision and placement decisions.  \n33 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 34 of 39 PageID #: 77\n\n147.  Numerous questions of fact and law are common to the claims of Named \nPlaintiffs and members of the proposed Class, including a) whether Defendantโs failure to have \npolicies and procedures for addressing childrenโs critical immigration-related needs violates the \nFourteenth Amendment as applied through 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, b) whether DCSโs failure to ensure \neligible youth are able to apply for SIJS violates the Fourteenth Amendment as applied through \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983; and c) whether Named Plaintiffs and the Class members are entitled to \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief to vindicate their constitutional rights.  \n148.  The claims that Named Plaintiffs raise are typical of those of the Class, as each \nClass memberโs claim would arise from the same course of events, and each Class member \nwould make similar legal arguments to prove Defendantโs liability. The remedies sought by \nNamed Plaintiffs are the same remedies that would benefit the Class: an injunction requiring \nDefendant to establish and implement policies and procedures to ensure immigrant children in \nDCS custody receive the benefit of planning for immigration-related needs and transitional \nservices, adequate training on immigration issues for case managers, and timely submission of \nSIJS applications. \n149.  Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the Class. \nThere are no conflicts among the Named Plaintiffs and any members of the Class. The Next \nFriends are dedicated to representing the best interests of the Named Plaintiffs.  \n150.  The undersigned counsel have extensive experience in litigating civil rights and \nclass action lawsuits, including those involving the rights of children in foster care and \nimmigrants lacking legal status.  \n151.  Defendant has acted or refused to act on grounds that are generally applicable to \nthe Class, and injunctive and declaratory relief are appropriate for the Class as a whole. \n34 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 35 of 39 PageID #: 78\n\nCLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Violations of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 by Depriving Plaintiffs of Their Fourteenth Amendment \nProcedural Due Process Right to Timely Submission and Adjudication of SIJS \nApplications - Asserted on Behalf of the Named Plaintiffs, Putative Class, and AIR) \n \n152.  Plaintiffs incorporate each and every allegation of the Complaint as if fully set \nforth below.  \n153.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution prohibits Defendant from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without \ndue process of law.  \n154.  Named Plaintiffs and other members of the Class have a property interest, \nprotected by the Due Process Clause, in applying for immigration benefits for which they are \neligible, including SIJS, and in the timely adjudication of their applications for SIJS. \n155.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendant in her official capacity \nconstitute policies, patterns, practices, and/or customs that deprive Named Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the Class of this property interest without due process of law. Defendantโs actions \nand inactions prevent members of the Class from timely seeking SIJS, including by timely \nseeking predicate orders, and submitting timely SIJS applications and supporting materials. \nDefendantโs actions and inactions result in members of the Class permanently losing their chance \nto obtain SIJS benefits without due process to determine their entitlement to SIJS. \n156.  Defendantโs acts and omissions described above violate 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 by \ndepriving the Named Plaintiffs and the members of the Class of their constitutional rights. \n157.  Defendantโs unlawful acts and omissions have caused and will continue to cause \nAIR to expend resources to respond rapidly and with minimal warning to urgent immigration-\nrelated needs that Defendant should have identified and planned for, including by AIR assisting \n35 \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00737     Document 1     Filed 07/24/23     Page 36 of 39 PageID #: 79\n\nyouth in seeking SIJS and obtaining from DCS materials and services necessary for SIJS \napplications. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n158.  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court: \na.  Assert subject matter jurisdiction over this action; \nb.  Order that the Named Plaintiffs may maintain this action as a class action \npursuant to Rule 23(a) and Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and \nappoint the undersigned as class counsel pursuant to Rule 23(g) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure; \nc.  Declare unlawful, pursuant to Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, Defendantโs conduct as alleged herein as a violation of the rights of Plaintiffs \nand the Class members under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983; \nd.  Grant preliminary and/or permanent injunctive relief requiring Defendant \nto: \ni.  Establish and implement policies and procedures to ensure that \nchildren in DCS custody receive the benefit of support and planning for \nimmigration-related needs and transitional services; \nii.  Establish and implement policies and procedures to ensure that \nDCS case managers receive adequate training on immigration issues impacting \nyouth in DCSโs care; \niii.
