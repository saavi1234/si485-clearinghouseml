    "summary": "<p>This case centers around <a href=\"https://legiscan.com/OK/text/SB613/id/2795559\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Senate Bill 613</a>, an Oklahoma bill passed in September 2022, which bans gender-affirming care for minors in Oklahoma. Specifically, SB 613 mandates that &ldquo;[a] healthcare provider shall not knowingly provide gender transition procedures to any child.&rdquo; The banned gender transition procedures include surgical procedures and drugs administered &ldquo;for the purpose of attempted to affirm the minor&rsquo;s perception of his or her gender or biological sex, if that perception is inconsistent with the minor&rsquo;s biological sex.&rdquo; SB 613 explicitly allows healthcare providers to administer the same surgical procedurals or therapeutic drug treatment for some other purpose outside of gender transition. Any healthcare provider found to be in violation of SB 613 is guilty of professional misconduct and a felony in the state of Oklahoma. SB 6123 went into effect when the Oklahoma governor signed it into law on May 1, 2023.</p>\r\n<p>On May 2, 2023, a group of families with transgender adolescents and a medical provider who supports transgender youth filed a lawsuit against various State Defendants and Hospital Defendants in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma. The State Defendants included the Attorney General of Oklahoma, individual members of the Oklahoma State Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision (OSBMLS), individual members of the Oklahoma Board of Nursing (OBN), and individual members of the Oklahoma State Board of Osteopathic Examiners (OSBOE); the Hospital Defendants included the University Hospitals Authority (UHA), the University Hospitals Trust (UHT), individual members of the UHA and UHT, OU Medicine, and the president of OU Medicine. &nbsp;The Plaintiffs in this case were represented by the ACLU of Oklahoma, Lambda Legal, and private counsel.</p>\r\n<p>The Plaintiffs alleged that SB 613 unjustly and unfairly discriminated against transgender minors and their healthcare providers on the basis of sex and transgender status, in violation of their rights under Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. This discrimination, plaintiffs alleged, also violated Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act. Plaintiffs also alleged that SB 613 violated their due process right to parental autonomy to seek and follow medical advice to protect the health and wellbeing of their minor children. Plaintiffs asked the court to grant declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys&rsquo; fees. This case was assigned to Judge John F. Heil, III.</p>\r\n<p>Contemporaneously with their complaint, Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction, asking the court to enjoin defendants from enforcing SB 613 while the case proceeded.</p>\r\n<p>On June 9, 2023, the United States filed a Statement of Interest in support of Plaintiffs in this case. The United States argued that by denying transgender minors&mdash;and only transgender minors&mdash;access to medically necessary and appropriate care, SB 613 violates the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Also on June 9, two medical groups filed amicus curiae briefs in support of the Plaintiffs. One brief was filed by a group of 23 national and state healthcare organizations, including the American Pediatric Association, representing thousands of healthcare professionals. The brief provided background on gender identity and gender dysphoria, described the professionally-accepted and rigorously studied medical guidelines for treating gender dysphoria in minors, and argued that enforcement of SB 613 would irreparably harm adolescents with gender dysphoria by denying crucial care to those who need it. The other amicus curiae brief was filed by a group of nine biomedical ethics and public health scholars, arguing that SB 613 undermined biomedical ethics, science, and public health, without any regard for the harm that would come from denying needed healthcare.</p>\r\n<p>On June 16, 2023, nineteen states filed an amicus brief in support of defendants. The amici states included Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, and West Virginia. The amici states argued that the banned healthcare practices were experimental and not evidence-based, and that SB 613 did not violate the Equal Protection clause.</p>\r\n<p>Also on June 16, 2023, defendants filed several motions to dismiss Plaintiffs' complaint and their opposition to Plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for preliminary injunction. Following several rounds of motion practice and oral argument, the court denied Plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for preliminary injunction on October 5, 2023. Judge Heil found that SB 613 did not discriminate based on sex or transgender status, but rather restricted particular medical procedures for a particular age group. Because age-based legislative restrictions are subject to rational review instead of heightened scrutiny, plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed in their Equal Protections claim. Judge Heil also found that there is no substantive due process right for parents to choose for their minor children to undergo the gender-affirming medical treatments at issue in SB 613. The court found that defendants had a compelling interest in and duty to protect the lives and health of minors in Oklahoma, and it was the legislature&rsquo;s job&mdash;and not the court&rsquo;s&mdash;to determine how to protect those minors. 2023 WL 6516449.</p>\r\n<p>The next day, on October 6, 2023, Plaintiffs appealed the court&rsquo;s denial of preliminary injunction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (23-5110).</p>\r\n<p>Throughout the rest of 2023 and into 2024, parties proceeded through several rounds of motion practice. The amici from the district court again filed as amici in the Tenth Circuit, and several new groups and individuals joined as amici as well. Specifically, the following additional amici filed briefs in support of the Plaintiffs: the United States of America; 20 states and the District of Columbia (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington); a group of 11 international LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations; a group of 4 national and state-level LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations; a group of 15 transgender adults; and Elliot Page and 56 other individuals. On the other hand, the following amici joined in support of defendants: a group of current and former conservative legislators and activists; Family Research Council, a faith-based educational non-profit; Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian legal advocacy group; Do No Harm and the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs.</p>\r\n<p>Oral argument was held on January 17, 2024 before judges Harris Hartz, Gregory A. Phillips, and Joel M. Carson III. As of March 29, 2024, this case is pending before the Tenth Circuit.</p>",

Governments have done so \nโfrom time immemorialโโregulating the medical profession, restricting access to \npotentially dangerous medicines, and banning treatments that are unsafe or un-\nproven.

Undeterred, Plaintiffs \nand their amici now ask this Court to invert the constitutional standard and set their \nfavored medical interest groups as the real regulators, authoring standards no mere \nState can contradict. The Court should reject the invitation. \nFirst, Oklahomaโs law is presumed constitutional. While Plaintiffs suggest \nthat heightened scrutiny applies any time a medical regulation depends on a patientโs \nsex, that has never been true. The Constitution takes as given that โ[p]hysical differ-\nences between men and womanโ โare enduring.โ United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. \n515, 533 (1996). As the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) ex-\nplains, โa womanโs body [is] obviously different from a manโs,โ โ[s]o it is no sur-\nprise that diseases, and the medications and medical devices used to treat them, may \naffect women differentlyโ from men.3 Accordingly, HHS regularly oversees health \ninitiatives that are sex specificโfrom improving breast cancer screening for women \nto promoting sex-specific approaches to treating heart disease.4 And Congress rou-\ntinely recognizes differences in the sexes, as when it made it a felony to perform \ngenital mutilation on a minor girl. 18 U.S.C. ยง116.

Br. 13), but the prohibition is nonetheless presumed constitutional. Why? \nBecause it is rooted in biological reality, not stereotypeโand, contra Plaintiffsโ rea-\nsoning (at 28), the presence of a penis or XY chromosomes is not a โstereotype.โ  \nCommon sense also answers Plaintiffsโ โsame treatmentsโ argument. Okla-\nhoma prohibits a physician from providing a vaginoplasty to a minor boy to transi-\ntion his gender appearance. Plaintiffs and their amici complain that โ[t]hese same \ntreatments remain legal forโ other youth and that heightened scrutiny is therefore \nrequired. E.g., Cal. Br. 13.5 But there is a world of difference between a vaginoplasty \nfor a female and the โsame treatmentโ for a transitioning male. The former can be \nperformed under local anesthesia and brings โseparated muscles togetherโ and re-\nmoves โextra mucosa skinโ to surgically tighten the vagina and restore normal func-\ntion, typically following trauma.6 The latter is major โsurgery to create a vaginaโ and \n \n5 Not even the World Professional Association for Transgender Health recommends \nvaginoplasties for minorsโthe only transitioning surgery for which this is trueโbut \nPlaintiffs nonetheless challenge Oklahomaโs ban on the surgery. And under Plain-\ntiffsโ theory of heightened scrutiny, whether WPATH deems a procedure appropriate \nfor minors โmay provide reasons why a particular classification survives heightened \nscrutiny, but it cannot be a basis for refusing to apply heightened scrutiny in the first \nplace.โ Plsโ Br. 19-20 (citation omitted).  \n6 See American Society of Plastic Surgeries, Aesthetic Genital Plastic Surgery Sur-\ngical Options: What Is A Vaginoplasty?, https://perma.cc/5WFH-57QP (last ac-\ncessed Dec. 10, 2023).  \n4 \n\nAppellate Case: 23-5110     Document: 010110970961     Date Filed: 12/18/2023     Page: 14 \n \nโinvolves removing the penis, testicles and scrotum.โ7 These are not the โsame treat-\nments.โ8  \nSecond, the Constitution does not put the World Professional Association for \nTransgender Health (WPATH) and the Endocrine Society in charge of regulating \nmedicine. Not only would this flip the purpose of regulation on its head (making the \nregulated the regulators), but one could scarcely dream up a more radical organiza-\ntion to outsource the job to than WPATH (whose members are also almost entirely \nresponsible for the Endocrine Society Guidelines). While โAmericans are engaged \nin an earnest and profound debate aboutโ how best to help children suffering from \ngender dysphoria, cf. Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 735 (1997), WPATH \nhas taken its gender ideology to the extreme and included in its latest Standards of \nCare an entire chapter on self-identified โeunuchsโโindividuals โassigned male at \nbirthโ who โwish to eliminate masculine physical features, masculine genitals, or \ngenital functioning.โ9 Drawing on the โEunuch Archiveโโa โlarge online peer-\n \n7 See Fan Liang, Johns Hopkins Medicine, Vaginoplasty for Gender Affirmation, \nhttps://perma.cc/RFU9-S72N (last accessed Dec. 10, 2023).  \n8 Lest the Court think this is an absurd example, pending before the Eleventh Circuit \nis a case in which the United States advances the โsame treatmentsโ argument to \nclaim that Title VII requires an employerโs health insurance carrier to cover transi-\ntioning โvaginoplastiesโ for men if it covers reparative vaginal surgery for women. \nSee Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae, Lange v.

See infra, pp. 20-22.  \nOklahoma went one step further and concluded that it would await the results \nof the experiments being conducted elsewhere rather than allow its vulnerable chil-\ndren to be used as guinea pigs.

Laws  Prohibiting  Pediatric  Gender-Transition  Procedures  Do  Not \nTrigger Heightened Scrutiny.  \nSB613,  like  similar  laws  enacted  by  many  of  the  amici  States,  prohibits \nhealthcare providers from performing surgeries on and administering hormones to \nminors for the purpose of gender transition. As with โother health and welfare laws,โ \nthe law is subject only to rational-basis review. Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2284.  \nA.  Laws Prohibiting Pediatric Gender-Transition Procedures Do Not \nDiscriminate Based on Sex.  \nPlaintiffs and their amici argue that the default rule of rational basis does not \napply here because โ[w]hether a specific treatment is prohibitedโ by SB613 โde-\npends exclusively on whether the treatment is deemed consistent or inconsistent with \nthe minorโs sex designated at birth.โ Plsโ Br. 18; see U.S. Br. 12; Cal. Br. 13-16. As \nboth the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits have recently explained, this argument fails. \nSee L.W., 83 F.4th at 480-81; Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1228.  \nAs an initial matter, Oklahomaโs law regulates gender-transition procedures \nfor all minors, regardless of sex. Under SB613, โ[a] health care provider shall not \nknowingly provide gender transition procedures to any child.โ Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. \n63, ยง2607.1(B) (emphasis added). This type of โacross-the-board regulation lacks \nany of the hallmarks of sex discriminationโ and does not โprefer one sex over the \nother.โ L.W., 83 F.4th at 480 (citation omitted). It does not include one sex and \n7 \n\nAppellate Case: 23-5110     Document: 010110970961     Date Filed: 12/18/2023     Page: 17 \n \nexclude the other. Cf. Virginia, 518 U.S. at 519-20. It does not โbestow benefits or \nburdens based on sex.โ Cf. Michael M. v. Super. Ct., 450 U.S. 464, 466 (1981) (plu-\nrality opinion); Orr v. Orr, 440 U.S. 268, 271 (1979). And it does not โapply one \nrule for males and another for females.โ Cf. Sessions v. Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. \n47, 58 (2017); Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 192 (1976). The Actโs prohibitions are \nsex-neutral and treat similarly situated individuals โevenhandedly.โ L.W., 83 F.4th \nat 479-80.  \nPlaintiffsโ contrary view reflects a fundamental misunderstanding both as to \nhow these statutes operate and how heightened scrutiny works. Plaintiffs argue that \nSB613 discriminates based on sex because, for instance, โan adolescent can be pre-\nscribed testosterone to affirm a male gender identity if the minorโs sex designated at \nbirth was male but not if it was female.โ Plsโ Br. 32. Putting aside the fact that Plain-\ntiffs point to no evidence suggesting that boys in Oklahoma receive testosterone to \nโaffirmโ their โmale gender identityโ (rather than simply to treat a testosterone defi-\nciency or kickstart delayed puberty), Plaintiffsโ logic would โforce [States] to either \nban puberty blockers and hormones for all purposes or allow them for all purposes.โ \nEknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1234 (Brasher, J., concurring). That is because Plaintiffs \nerroneously view the administration of testosterone as one monolithic treatmentโ\nthe โsame medical treatmentโ regardless of whether the hormone is used to treat a \n8 \n\nAppellate Case: 23-5110     Document: 010110970961     Date Filed: 12/18/2023     Page: 18 \n \nboyโs testosterone deficiency or transition a teenaged girl. But just as with the vagi-\nnoplasty example discussed above, these are different treatments.   \nFirst, common sense tells us that a physician can use the same drug or proce-\ndure to treat different conditions with different risk profiles and that that fact does \nnot make the two treatments the same. To the diabetic patient, injecting insulin is \nlifesaving. To the hypoglycemic patient, it can be life ending. Same drug, different \ntreatments.  \nThis same is true here. Puberty blockers, for example, are typically used in \nchildren to treat precocious puberty, a condition where a child begins puberty at an \nunusually early age.14 Unlike gender dysphoria, precocious puberty is a physical ab-\nnormality that can be diagnosed through medical tests.15 When puberty blockers are \nused to treat precocious puberty, the goal is to ensure that children develop at the \nnormal age of puberty. The goal of using them to treat gender dysphoria, by contrast, \nis to block normally timed puberty. This distinction changes the cost-benefit analysis \nbecause using puberty blockers well beyond the normal pubertal age can, at mini-\nmum, risk a childโs bone growth and social development.16  \n \n14 Endocrine Society, Precocious Puberty (Jan. 24, 2022), https://perma.cc/6Q3E-\nPEMP.  \n15 Id.  \n16 See Natโl Inst. for Health & Care Excellence (NICE), Evidence review: Gonado-\ntrophin releasing hormone analogues for children and adolescents with gender dys-\nphoria (Mar. 11, 2021), https://perma.cc/93NB-BGAN, at 26-32 (โNICE Puberty \nBlocker Evidence Reviewโ). \n9 \n\nAppellate Case: 23-5110     Document: 010110970961     Date Filed: 12/18/2023     Page: 19 \n \nLikewise for testosterone and estrogen, which also serve different purposes \nand carry different risks when given to boys versus girls. Excess testosterone in fe-\nmales can cause infertility,17 while testosterone is used in males to alleviate fertility \nproblems.18 On the other hand, excessive amounts of estrogen in males can cause \ninfertility and sexual dysfunction,19 while estrogen is often given to females to treat \nproblems with sexual development.20 Thus, giving testosterone or estrogen to a phys-\nically healthy child for the purpose of gender transitioning has a different purpose \nand different risks than using the same drugs to treat a genetic or congenital condi-\ntion that occurs exclusively in one sex.21 L.W., 83 F.4th at 481. These distinctions, \namong others, make the use of the same hormones in the different sexes different \ntreatments altogether.  \nSecond, a Stateโs medical regulation does not become โa sex-based classifica-\ntionโ merely by mentioning sex.

The Constitution does not look askance on a hospital offering tes-\nticular exams only to boys or pap smears only to girls. And here, โlaws banning, \npermitting, or otherwise regulating [gender-transition procedures] all face the same \nlinguistic destiny of describing the biology of the procedures.โ L.W., 83 F.4th at 483. \nThey refer to sex only because the procedures they regulate โare themselves sex-\nbased.โ Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1228. Yet just as States can enact laws concerning \nabortion, female genital mutilation, testicular cancer, prostate cancer, breastfeeding, \ncervical cancer, Cesarean sections, and in-vitro fertilization without those laws being \nconsidered โpresumptively unconstitutional,โ so can they regulate experimental gen-\nder-transition procedures. L.W., 83 F.4th at 482 (collecting examples). \nThis is also one reason why the reasoning of Bostock does not apply. See Bos-\ntock v. Clayton Cnty., 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020). Whatever the merits of the Supreme \nCourtโs โsimple testโ โin the workplaceโ (id. at 1737, 1743)โโif changing the em-\nployeeโs sex would have yielded a different choice by the employer,โ the employer \nhas treated the employee differently โbecause of sex,โ id. at 1741โit makes no sense \nto apply the test to medicine, where males and females are not similarly situated. A \nfertility clinic does not discriminate on the basis of sex by implanting fertilized eggs \nonly in females, even though โchanging the [patientโs] sex would have yielded a \ndifferent choice by the [clinic].โ There is no stereotype or inequality in the clinicโs \n11 \n\nAppellate Case: 23-5110     Document: 010110970961     Date Filed: 12/18/2023     Page: 21 \n \npolicy. So here. Administering testosterone to bring a boyโs levels into a normal \nrange is not the same treatment as ramping up a young girlโs testosterone levels to \nthat of a healthy boyโten times that of a healthy girlโor, for that matter, as provid-\ning the hormone to a Tour de France cyclist seeking a yellow jersey.  \nReturning to Plaintiffsโ reasoning, it is not true that boys in Oklahoma can \nreceive testosterone to transition. Not only is this because no minor, male or female, \nmay be prescribed testosterone to transition, but biology dictates that a โminor born \nas a maleโ cannot use testosterone to transition at all. Only females can use testos-\nterone for the purpose of gender transitionโnever males. See L.W., 83 F.4th at 481. \nAlthough a male can use testosterone for other types of treatment, no amount of \ntestosterone will cause a male to develop female characteristics.  \nThe inverse is true for estrogen gender-transitioning treatments. Estrogen can \nbe used for gender transition only in males, never the reverse. Id. The same goes for \nthe surgical procedures at issue here. Only females would obtain a double mastec-\ntomy or a phalloplasty for the purpose of gender transition. And only males would \nseek breast enlargement surgery or the creation of a neovagina22 for the purpose of \ngender transition. These are โmedical procedure[s] that only one sex can undergo,โ \n \n22 See Kenzie Birse et al., The Neovaginal Microbiome of Transgender Women Post-\nGender  Reassignment  Surgery,  8  MICROBIOME  61  (2020). \nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-020-00804-1. \n12 \n\nAppellate Case: 23-5110     Document: 010110970961     Date Filed: 12/18/2023     Page: 22 \n \nmaking heightened scrutiny inappropriate. Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2245; see L.W., 83 \nF.4th at 481; Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1229.  \nAs for puberty-blocking gender-transitioning treatment, sex does not matter \nto Oklahomaโs law. โIn contrast to cross-sex hormones, puberty blockers involve the \nsame drug used equally by gender-transitioning boys and girls.โ L.W., 83 F.4th at \n483. Prohibiting their use for the purpose of gender transition does not depend on \nsex at all. \nThe โright question under the Equal Protection Clauseโ is whether โthose who \nwant to use these drugs to treat a discordance between their sex and gender identity \nand those who want to use these drugs to treat other conditionsโ are โsimilarly situ-\nated.โ Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1233 (Brasher, J., concurring). To ask the question \nanswers it. Oklahoma and other States have discretion to โpermit varying treatments \nof distinct diagnoses, as the โConstitution does not require things which are different \nin fact or opinion to be treated in law as though they were the same.โโ L.W., 83 F.4th \nat 482-83 (quoting Tigner v. Texas, 310 U.S. 141, 147 (1940)). \nThis leaves Plaintiffsโ complaint about stereotyping. See Plsโ Br. 28-30. To \nhear Plaintiffs and their amici tell it, Oklahomaโs law โconditions the availability of \nparticular medical procedures on an individual conforming to sex stereotypes,โ Cal. \nBr. 18โas though Oklahoma makes access to gender-transition treatments turn on \nwho โwalk[s] more femininely, talk[s] more femininely, dress[es] more femininely, \n13 \n\nAppellate Case: 23-5110     Document: 010110970961     Date Filed: 12/18/2023     Page: 23 \n \nwear[s] make-up, ha[s] [their] hair styled, [or] wear[s] jewelry,โ Price Waterhouse \nv. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 235 (1989) (plurality op.). To state the obvious, โbiologi-\ncal sex โฆ is not a stereotype.โ Adams by & through Kasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns \nCnty., 57 F.4th 791, 809 (11th Cir. 2022) (en banc). And characteristics determined \nby biological sexโhormonal levels or the presence of male or female genitaliaโare \nnot stereotypes. Stereotypes are not โimmutable characteristics determined solely by \nthe accident of birth.โ Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 686 (1973). The Con-\nstitution does not forbid States from accounting for biological reality when regulat-\ning medicine.  \nB.  Transgender Individuals Are Not a Suspect Class.  \nPlaintiffs next argue that โSB613 necessarily classifies based on transgender \nstatusโ because โonly transgender people undergo โgender transition.โโ Plsโ Br. 22. \nIn making that argument, Plaintiffs erase the experiences of a growing number of \ndetransitioners who received gender-transition procedures but later chose to detran-\nsition and live in accordance with their biological sex.23 If detransitioners were never \ntransgender, then it cannot be true that only transgender individuals seek the prohib-\nited procedures. And if detransitioners were transgender but no longer are, then \ntransgender status cannot be an immutable characteristic.  \n \n23 E.g., Lisa Littman, Individuals Treated for Gender Dysphoria with Medical and/or \nSurgical Transition Who Subsequently Detransitioned: A Survey of 100 Detransi-\ntioners, 50 ARCHIVES OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR 3353 (2021). \n14 \n\nAppellate Case: 23-5110     Document: 010110970961     Date Filed: 12/18/2023     Page: 24 \n \nRegardless, heightened scrutiny does not apply simply because people seek-\ning a procedure are disproportionately (or even uniformly) members of a suspect \nclass. Vacco v. Quill, 521 U.S. 793, 800 (1997). Classifications based on sex receive \nintermediate scrutiny, but a classification of โpeople seeking abortionsโ does not, \neven though only women seek abortions. Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2245-46. \nAnd individuals who identify as transgender do not constitute a suspect class \nto begin with. Aside from the obviousโrace, sex, national origin, religion, etc.โthe \nSupreme Court rarely designates suspect or quasi-suspect classes. See, e.g., City of \nCleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 442-46 (1985). Indeed, the Court \nhas rejected suspect classification for disability, age, and poverty. Id.; Mass. Bd. of \nRetirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 313 (1976); San Antonio Ind. Sch. Dist. v. Ro-\ndriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 28 (1973). That so few classifications rise to the level of โsus-\npectโ itself casts โgrave doubtโ on the assertion that transgender identity does. Ad-\nams, 57 F.4th at 803 n.5.  \nPrecedent explains why. Classifications are suspect when they single out โdis-\ntinguishing characteristicsโ that have historically been divorced from โthe interests \nthe State has the authority to implement.โ Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441. Sex classifica-\ntions, for example, are (quasi)-suspect because they often โreflect outmoded notions \nof the relative capabilities of men and women,โ rather than real differences. Id. Same \nfor racial classifications. Murgia, 427 U.S. at 313-14. Thus, to be โsuspect,โ a \n15 \n\nAppellate Case: 23-5110     Document: 010110970961     Date Filed: 12/18/2023     Page: 25 \n \nclassification must single out a so-called โimmutableโ characteristic that has histor-\nically been the basis for deep discrimination. See Lyng v. Castillo, 477 U.S. 635, 638 \n(1986) (looking for (1) immutable characteristics that define (2) a discrete group, \n(3) historical discrimination, and (4) political powerlessness). \nTransgender status does not check any of these boxes. For one, it is not โan \nimmutable characteristic determined solely by the accident of birth.โ Frontiero, 411 \nU.S.  at  686.  To  the  contrary,  according  to  Plaintiffs,  individuals  identify  as \ntransgender when their internal perception of who they are departs from the immu-\ntable  characteristic  of  their  biological  sex,  a  characteristic  known  since  birth. \nTransgender identification necessarily takes place sometime after birth. And many \nindividuals who identify as transgender alternate between gender identifications, be \nit non-binary, gender fluid, third gender, or their natal gender.24 If a child can hop in \nand out of the category based on her โfluidโ identity, it makes no sense to use the \ncategory for equal protection purposes.  \nFor similar reasons, transgender status hardly defines a โdiscrete group.โ \nLyng, 477 U.S. at 638. The term โtransgenderโ can describe โa huge variety of gen-\nder identities and expressions,โ25 with recent estimates citing more than 80 types of \ngender identities that include โaliagender,โ โbigender,โ โdemiboy,โ โgender-fluid,โ \n \n24 See Littman, Individuals Treated for Gender Dysphoria, supra.  \n25 WPATH SOC8, supra, at S15.  \n16 \n\nAppellate Case: 23-5110     Document: 010110970961     Date Filed: 12/18/2023     Page: 26 \n \nโmaverique,โ โnon-binary,โ โpolygender,โ and many others.26 Transgender individ-\nuals may also โembrace a fluidity of gender identityโ or even an โunfixed gender \nidentity.โ27 \n  Nor are transgender individuals a โpolitically powerlessโ group. Rodriguez, \n411 U.S. at 28. To start, they are quite โunlikeโ those individuals who were long \npurposefully denied equal protection under the law due to their race, national origin, \nor sex. Murgia, 427 U.S. at 313-14 (rejecting age as suspect class because elderly \npersons have not faced discrimination โakin to [suspect] classificationsโ). To take \njust some recent examples, from his first day in office, President Biden has priori-\ntized โPreventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity.โ \nExec. Order No. 13,988, 86 Fed. Reg. 7,023 (Jan. 20, 2021). Executive agencies \nhave attempted to impose new gender-identity obligations on the States. See, e.g., \nTennessee v. Depโt of Educ., 615 F. Supp. 3d 807, 838-39 (E.D. Tenn. 2022) (reject-\ning agency attempts to โgo[] beyond the holding of Bostockโ). And more than a \ndozen States have enacted laws expressly allowing pediatric gender-transition pro-\ncedures prohibited under Oklahomaโs law. See Cal. Br. 7-9; L.W., 83 F.4th at 487. \n \n26 Chris Drew, 81 Types of Genders & Gender Identities (A to Z List), HELPFULPRO-\nFESSOR.COM (Mar. 26, 2022), https://perma.cc/SK4T-J5T4. \n27  Human  Rights  Campaign,  Glossary  of  Terms,  Gender  Fluid, \nhttps://perma.cc/D4ND-7GEQ . \n17 \n\nAppellate Case: 23-5110     Document: 010110970961     Date Filed: 12/18/2023     Page: 27 \n \nPlaintiffs here have the support of the Department of Justice, many (American) med-\nical organizations, and prestigious law firms. \n  State laws regulating gender-transition procedures are recent enactments by \npolicymakers grappling with tough policy questions about how to protect children \nfrom the significant risks posed by still-novel medical interventions for gender dys-\nphoria. To the extent a Stateโs regulation of those procedures requires focusing on \ngender-dysphoric youth, such a classification is a โsensible ground for different \ntreatment,โ not the sort of irrelevant grouping that warrants heightened scrutiny. \nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 440. As evidenced by the two amicus briefs filed by the States \nin this case, States have taken varying approaches to these issues. Removing these \nโtrying policy choicesโ from the โarena of public debate and legislative actionโ and \nplacing them in the hands of the federal judiciary โis not how a constitutional de-\nmocracy is supposed to workโor at least works bestโwhen confronting evolving \nsocial norms.โ L.W., 83 F.4th at 486-87. Until the Supreme Court says otherwise, \nโrational basis review applies to transgender-based classifications.โ Id. at 419. \nII.  Oklahomaโs Law Survives Any Level of Review.  \nEven if heightened scrutiny applied, Oklahomaโs law would pass muster. See \nEknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1235 (Brasher, J., concurring) (finding โexceedingly per-\nsuasive justificationโ for prohibiting pediatric gender-transition procedures).  \n18 \n\nAppellate Case: 23-5110     Document: 010110970961     Date Filed: 12/18/2023     Page: 28 \n \nA.  Courts  Should  Defer  to  Legislatures  in  the  Face  of  Medical \nUncertainty. \nStates have โwide discretionโ to regulate โin areas where there is medical and \nscientific uncertainty.โ Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 163; accord Marshall v. United States, \n414 U.S. 417, 427 (1974) (โWhen [a legislature] undertakes to act in areas fraught \nwith medical and scientific uncertainties, legislative options must be especially \nbroad.โ). This deference applies even in cases involving heightened scrutiny. Gon-\nzales, 550 U.S. at 163 (stating that โ[t]his traditional rule is consistent with [Planned \nParenthood v.] Casey,โ 505 U.S. 833 (1992), which involved heightened scrutiny)). \nThe reason for that is clear: The Constitution provides no guidance to courts \nfor choosing between competing medical authorities. Cf. Rucho v. Com. Cause, 139 \nS. Ct. 2484, 2498 (2019) (requiring deference to legislatures unless there are โclear, \nmanageable, and politically neutralโ standards for judicial intervention). Federal \ncourts are not equipped to choose, as a constitutional matter, between (on the one \nhand) the medical opinions of Plaintiffsโ expert witnesses and preferred medical in-\nterest groups and (on the other hand) the medical opinions of Oklahomaโs expert \nwitnesses, half a dozen countries in Europe, and the U.S. Agency for Healthcare \nResearch and Quality. That job is for the legislature. See Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at \n1235 (Brasher, J., concurring) (โIntermediate scrutiny permits the legislature to \nmake a predictive judgment based on competing evidence.โ (cleaned up)). And โthe \n19 \n\nAppellate Case: 23-5110     Document: 010110970961     Date Filed: 12/18/2023     Page: 29 \n \nStates are indeed engaged in thoughtful debates about the issue.โ L.W., 83 F.4th at \n471 (citation omitted).  \nAccordingly, all Oklahoma had to do to prevail even under heightened scru-\ntiny is show that there is a medical dispute on the issue at hand. It did that. See J.A. \n(Vol. IV) 578-93, 621-36. The U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality \nitself admits that these interventions lack evidentiary support: โThere is a lack of \ncurrent evidence-based guidance for the care of children and adolescents who iden-\ntify as transgender, particularly regarding the benefits and harms of pubertal sup-\npression, medical affirmation with hormone therapy, and surgical affirmation.โ28  \nFinlandโs medical authority likewise concluded that, โ[i]n light of available \nevidence, gender reassignment of minors is an experimental practice,โ and โthere \nare no medical treatment[s] that can be considered evidence-based.โ29 So did the \nUnited Kingdomโs National Health Service, which recently restricted gender-transi-\ntion interventions to formal research settings after an independent medical review \nconcluded that there is no evidentiary support for these interventions given the โlack \n \n28 AHRQ, Topic Brief: Treatments for Gender Dysphoria in Transgender Youth (Jan. \n8, 2021), https://perma.cc/23B5-D7C8. \n29 Recommendation of the Council for Choices in Health Care in Finland: Medical \nTreatment  Methods  for  Dysphoria  Related  to  Gender  Variance  in  Minors, \nPALKO/COHERE Finland (2020), https://perma.cc/VN38-67WT. \n20 \n\nAppellate Case: 23-5110     Document: 010110970961     Date Filed: 12/18/2023     Page: 30 \n \nof reliable comparative studies.โ30 Swedenโs National Board of Health and Welfare \nreached a similar conclusion, finding that โthe risk of puberty suppressing treatment \nwith GnRH-analogues and gender-affirming hormonal treatment currently outweigh \nthe possible benefits.โ31 And earlier this year, the Norwegian Healthcare Investiga-\ntion Board (Ukom) found โinsufficient evidence for the use of puberty blockers and \ncross sex hormone treatments in young people, especially for teenagers who are in-\ncreasingly seeking health services.โ32 Thus, โUkom defines such treatments as ut-\nprรธvende behandling, or โtreatments under trial,โโ 33โthat is, experimental.  \nIn fact, calling the treatments โexperimentalโ may be overstating things. As \nthe district court found, it may be โmore accurate to state that the [treatments] are \nnot โexperimentalโ only because the experimental phase has truly not yet begun.โ \nJ.A. (Vol. VI) at 1291; see Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1225 (noting that gender-tran-\nsition drugs provided to minors have โuncertainty regarding benefits, recent surges \nin use,โ โirreversible effects,โ and โgrowing concern about the medicationsโ risks.โ \n \n30 Natโl Inst. for Health & Care Excellence, Gender-affirming hormones for children \nand adolescents with gender dysphoria (Mar. 11, 2021), https://perma.cc/M8J5-\nMXVG  (โNICE Cross-Sex Hormone Reviewโ); NICE Puberty Blocker Evidence \nReview, supra. \n31 Sweden National Board of Health and Welfare Policy Statement, SOCIALSTYREL-\nSEN, Care of Children and Adolescents with Gender Dysphoria: Summary 3 (2022), \nhttps://perma.cc/FDS5-BDF3. \n32 Jennifer Block, Norwayโs Guidance on Paediatric Gender Treatment is Unsafe, \nSays Review, THE BMJ (Mar. 23, 2023), https://perma.cc/9FQF-MJJ9. \n33 Id.  \n21 \n\nAppellate Case: 23-5110     Document: 010110970961     Date Filed: 12/18/2023     Page: 31 \n \n(citations omitted)); L.W., 83 F.4th at 471 (gender-transition procedures for minors \nis โa vexing and novel topic of medical debate.โ). In light of this uncertainty, Okla-\nhoma had โwide discretionโ to restrict these interventions to protect the โhealth and \nwelfareโ of children.โ Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2284.  \nB.  Plaintiffs Erroneously Rely on American Medical Interest Groups \nThat Are Biased Advocates, Not Neutral Experts.  \nPlaintiffsโ amici discount the European experience because none of the Euro-\npean countries that has conducted a systematic review responded by banning the \nprocedures outright. E.g., Cal. Br. 25; Foreign Non-Profit Br. 3. But see Foreign \nNon-Profit Br. 11, 14, 23 (acknowledging that Finland, Norway, and Spain have \nbanned minors from accessing transitioning surgeries, and other countries have im-\nposed age limits on hormones). But these countries do not allow gender transitioning \ninterventions as a matter of general medical practice, which is what Plaintiffs here \nare seeking. Instead, they generally confine access to the procedures to formal re-\nsearch protocols. See J.A. (Vol. IV) 554-62.  \nAnd regardless, if the treatments are experimental, what does it matter if Eng-\nland chooses to conduct the experiments? The Constitution does not require Okla-\nhoma to offer its children as guinea pigs rather than waiting on results of the ongoing \nexperiments. And considering whether there are less-restrictive alternatives to a ban \nis not โhow intermediate scrutiny works under the Equal Protection Clauseโ in any \ncase. Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1235-36 (Brasher, J., concurring) (discussing Boren, \n22 \n\nAppellate Case: 23-5110     Document: 010110970961     Date Filed: 12/18/2023     Page: 32 \n \n429 U.S. 190). The pertinent question is โwhether the state has an interest in classi-\nfying based on sexโโnot โwhether, even if the state were allowed to classify based \non sex, the state could achieve its objective with some lesser restriction.โ Id.  \nPlaintiffsโ answer is that Oklahoma cannot await the results of the European \nexperiments because the American medical organizations have not done so. Plsโ Br. \n39-40. Indeed they havenโt. While healthcare authorities in Europe have urged cau-\ntion, American medical organizations advocate for unfettered access to transitioning \ntreatments even as they admit more research is needed.34 \nIn some ways, it is unsurprising that, until recent decisions by the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, courts repeatedly deferred to these organizations. One would hope \nthat medical societies like American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the Endocrine \nSociety, and WPATH would be honest brokers, reviewing the evidence as Europe \nhas done and responding accordingly. And one would hope that organizations like \nthe American Medical Associationโwhich has not published guidelines on this \ntopic but supports the WPATH Standards of Careโwould use their institutional \ngoodwill, built up over time, to be the voice of reason and prioritize the safety of \nchildren.  \nSadly, this has not happened. As with other institutions, American medical \norganizations have become increasingly โperformative,โ treated by their leaders as \n \n34 E.g., Ghorayshi, Medical Group Backs Youth Gender Treatments, supra.  \n23 \n\nAppellate Case: 23-5110     Document: 010110970961     Date Filed: 12/18/2023     Page: 33 \n \nplatforms for advancing the current momentโs cause cรฉlรจbre.35 Add to this a replica-\ntion crisis in scientific literature and the ability of researchers to use statistics to make \nfindings appear significant when they are not,36 and it is no wonder that medical \norganizations find it easier to just go with the zeitgeist. (Not to mention that the \nAmerican interest groups that endorse gender-transition procedures are just thatโ\ninterest groups, with a strong financial interest in the procedures their members make \na living by providing.) Science is hard, and there is no reward in the current climate \nfor any organization that questions the safety and efficacy of using sterilizing gen-\nder-transition procedures on children.  \nTake AAP, for instance, which has โdecriedโ โas transphobicโ a resolution by \nits members discussing โthe growing international skepticism of pediatric gender \ntransitionโ and calling for a literature review.37 Then, when AAP finally acknowl-\nedged that there are no systematic reviews supporting the treatments it recommends, \nthe group promised to conduct oneโwhile assuring it would continue to recommend \nthe treatments while awaiting evidence of their safety and efficacy.

Marshall, No. 2:22-cv-184-LCB (N.D. Ala.), ECF 208. Ample \nevidence shows just how true that is. In addition to advocating castration as โmedi-\ncally necessary gender-affirming careโ for males whose โgender identityโ is โeu-\nnuch,โ WPATH recently removed most minimum-age requirements for gender-\nmodification procedures from its Standards of Care.44 According to the lead author \nof the chapter on children, WPATH did so to โbridge th[e] considerationsโ regarding \nthe need for insurance coverage with the desire to ensure that doctors would not be \nheld liable for malpractice if they deviated from the standards.45  \nWPATH has also suppressed dissent, including canceling the presentation of \na prominent researcher who dared to question the safety of transitioning young chil-\ndren and censuring a board member who went public with concerns that medical \nproviders in America are transitioning minors without proper safeguards.46  \n \n43 Joshua Safer, State of the Art: Transgender Hormone Care (Feb. 15, 2019), \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7Xg9gZS_hg (at 5:38-6:18). \n44 See SOC 8, supra, at S43-79.  \n45 Videorecording of Dr. Tishelmanโs WPATH presentation, https://perma.cc/4M52-\nWG4X. \n46 Emily Bazelon, The Battle Over Gender Therapy, N.Y.

Plaintiffs1 Peter Poe, Daphne Doe, Brandon Boe, Lydia Loe, and Ryan Roe (the \nโMinor Plaintiffsโ) are transgender adolescents in Oklahoma who have been thriving because they \nhave the loving support of their parents and access to medically necessary care and treatments for \ntheir gender dysphoria, both of which allow them to live as the people they know themselves to \nbe.  They have become active participants in their communities, are excelling in school, and are \ngrowing up to become what parents desire for their children: healthy and contributing members of \nour society.  \n2.  The Minor Plaintiffs, along with hundreds of other adolescents in Oklahoma, are \nnow faced with the loss of access to this safe, effective, and medically necessary health care \nbecause Oklahoma has singled out transgender adolescents by enacting a discriminatory and \ncategorical prohibition on medical treatments for transgender adolescents that are available to \nothers.  In so doing, Oklahoma has endangered the health and wellbeing of transgender adolescents \nin Oklahoma.  \n3.  On May 1, 2023, Governor Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma signed into law Senate Bill \n(SB) 613 (โSB 613,โ the โHealth Care Banโ or โBanโ), categorically banning the provision of \nnecessary and often lifesaving medical care to transgender adolescents in Oklahoma.  The law \npassed despite the sustained and robust opposition of medical experts in Oklahoma and across the \ncountry, and the myriad of Sooner families that stand to be negatively impacted.  The law includes \nan emergency provision that made it effective upon Governor Stittโs signature.  The Health Care \n \n1 Plaintiffs Peter Poe, Paula Poe, Patrick Poe, Daphne Doe, Donna Doe, Brandon Boe, Bethany \nBoe, Benjamin Boe, Lydia Loe, Lauren Loe, Ryan Roe, Rachel Roe, and Richard Roe are filing a \nseparate motion to proceed using these pseudonyms, rather than their legal names, to protect the \nprivacy rights of the minor plaintiffs regarding their transgender status, medical diagnoses, and \ntreatment, and for their safety. \n4 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 5 of 64\n \nBan violates the constitutional rights of Oklahoma adolescents and their parents and will cause \nsevere and irreparable harm. \n4.  Medical providers long have followed evidence-based and comprehensive clinical \npractice guidelines that recommend certain medical treatments for gender dysphoria, which is a \nmedical condition characterized by the clinically significant distress caused by the incongruence \nbetween a personโs gender identity and the sex they were assigned at birth.  Decades of clinical \nexperience and a large body of scientific and medical literature support these medical guidelines, \nwhich are recognized as authoritative by the major medical associations in the United States.  \nThese guidelines provide a framework for the safe and effective treatment of gender dysphoria, \nwhich if left untreated can have dire and serious consequences for the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender people, including adolescents.  For some adolescent patients with gender dysphoria, \npuberty-delaying treatment and hormone therapy are medically indicated.   \n5.  By prohibiting any โhealth care providerโ from โknowingly provid[ing] gender \ntransition procedures toโ any person under eighteen (18) years of age, the Health Care Ban denies \ntransgender  adolescents  with  gender  dysphoria  necessary,  safe,  and  effective  treatment  and \nprevents parents from obtaining medically necessary care for their transgender adolescents.  It also \nprevents health care providers from treating their transgender patients in accordance with well-\nestablished and evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. \n6.  Critically, the Health Care Ban does not seek to prohibit the medical treatments at \nissue for all medical conditions; rather, it prohibits the provision of these treatments only when \nthey are โperformed for the purpose of attempting to affirm the minorโs perception of his or her \ngender or biological sex,โ if inconsistent with the minorโs โbiological sex,โ which is not defined, \nor sex assigned at birth.  In other words, the Health Care Ban prohibits the provision of these \n5 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 6 of 64\n \ntreatments only when used to treat a transgender adolescentโs gender dysphoria, even though the \nrisks of the treatments are similar, if not the same, regardless of the condition for which they are \nused.   \n7.  The Health Care Ban was passed because of, and not in spite of, its impact on \ntransgender adolescents, depriving them of necessary, safe, and effective medical care, thereby \ninterfering with and overriding the clinical and evidence-based judgment of medical providers and \nthe decision-making of loving parents, like Paula and Patrick Poe, Donna Doe, Benjamin and \nBethany Boe, Lauren Loe, and Rachel and Richard Roe (the โParent Plaintiffsโ). \n8.  If the Health Care Ban is not blocked, it will have devastating consequences for \ntransgender adolescents in Oklahoma.  These adolescents will be unable to obtain critical medical \ncare that their health care providers have recommended and their parents agree they need.  Further, \nthose already receiving care will have their treatment halted.  For some transgender adolescents, \nthe prospect of losing necessary medical care is unbearable.  \n9.  Concerned about the health and wellbeing of their children, some families of \ntransgender adolescents are making plans to move out of the State of Oklahoma now that the \nHealth Care Ban has taken effect.  No longer welcome in Oklahoma, they fear for their childrenโs \nhealth and safety if they are unable to secure necessary medical treatment.  These parents are \npoised to leave their jobs, businesses, extended families, and communitiesโand uproot their \nfamilies from their homesโto get the medical treatment their adolescent children need.   \n10.  Other parents, unable to move out of state, are making contingency plans to ensure \nthe health and safety of their kids.  They are considering separating from their children by having \ntheir adolescent child live with a relative where they can access the necessary, safe, and effective \nmedical care that the Health Care Ban bars, or they are establishing alternative access to care \n6 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 7 of 64\n \nhundreds of miles away, at great financial cost.  These families already have lived through the \nimpact on their children of untreated gender dysphoria and have seen how treatment has enabled \nthem to thrive.   \n11.  It has been amazing for Paula Poe to see her son Peter Poe bloom once he began \nreceiving treatment and living as a boy; he is euphoric to be who he is.  Likewise, Donna Doe is \nso happy that following care, her granddaughter Daphne is excelling in school and thinking about \nauditioning for theater again.  Benjamin Boe is proud that his son, Brandon Boe, has been able to \ntake a job where he greets strangers with confidence and self-assuredness; before treatment, he \nwould not speak in public. Rachel Roe has observed the enormously positive impact gender-\naffirming care has had on her son, Ryan Roe, who is now thriving and happy as opposed to when \nhe was not affirmed as who he is. And Lauren Loe has seen a drastic improvement in her daughter \nLydia Loeโs mental health; she can be her authentic self without fear of being misgendered.  \n12.  Many families, however, do not have the resources to uproot their lives or to \nestablish access to care out-of-state, and they are terrified about the effect of the Health Care Ban \non their transgender adolescent children. \n13.  The Health Care Ban not only gravely threatens the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents in Oklahoma; it also is unconstitutional.  The Health Care Ban violates \nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it discriminates against the \nMinor Plaintiffs on the basis of sex and transgender status by prohibiting any โhealth care \nproviderโ from โknowingly provid[ing] gender transition procedures to any child.โ   \n14.  The Health Care Ban also discriminates against the Parent Plaintiffs in the exercise \nof their fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their \nchildren by prohibiting them from seeking and following medical advice to protect the health and \n7 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 8 of 64\n \nwellbeing of their minor children.  By preventing parents from seeking the medical care for their \nchildren that medical and mental health providers have recommended, the Health Care Ban \nviolates the right to parental autonomy guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment.   \n15.  The Health Care Ban is not the only legislation the Oklahoma State Legislature has \nenacted  that  unjustifiably  restricts  medical  treatments  for  transgender  adolescents  and \ndiscriminates against them.  On September 29, 2022, the Oklahoma State Legislature enacted \nSenate Bill 3 (โSB 3โ), which Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt signed into law on October 4, 2022.  \nSB 3 appropriated $39.4 million to the University Hospitals Authority โfor the construction and \nequipping of facilities designed to expand the capacity of behavioral health care for the children \nof [Oklahoma].โ  However, SB 3 prohibited any monies from being expended for the benefit of \nany facility performing โgender reassignment medical treatmentโ on any patient under the age of \n18.   \n16.  In  response  to  SB  3,  Defendants  University  Hospitals  Authority,  University \nHospitals Trust, and OU Medicine, Inc. d/b/a OU Health (โOU Healthโ) (together, the โHospital \nDefendantsโ) ceased providing hormone-related prescription therapies and surgical procedures for \ngender-affirming services to transgender patients under the age of eighteen to gain access to the \nfunds conditioned by SB 3, even though they continue to provide these same medical services to \nnon-transgender patients for other purposes.   \n17.  The decision of the Hospital Defendants to cease providing medical services for the \ntreatment of gender dysphoria has endangered the health and wellbeing of Plaintiffs Peter Poe, \nDaphne Doe, Brandon Boe, and Lydia Loe (โthe OU Health Minor Plaintiffsโ) by denying them \ncritical medical care and treatment.  The policy also has forced Plaintiffs Paula and Patrick Poe, \n8 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 9 of 64\n \nDonna Doe, Benjamin and Bethany Boe, and Lauren Loe (the โOU Health Parent Plaintiffsโ) to \nincur costs to change providers or make plans to travel out of state for access to treatments.  In \naddition, it has required Plaintiff Dr. Lawlis to establish a separate practice to continue to care for \nher patients.    \n18.  The Hospital Defendantsโ decision and policy to cease providing medical services \nto transgender adolescents to treat gender dysphoria violates the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment because it discriminates on the basis of sex and transgender status.  It also \nviolates Section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (โACAโ), 42 U.S.C. \nยง 18116 (โSection 1557โ). \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n19.

Following the passage of SB 3, Dr. Lawlis was required to \nmove her care and treatment of transgender adolescents under the age of 18 to a private clinic.  The \nHealth Care Ban prohibits the gender-affirming care Dr. Lawlis provides to her patients under the \nage of 18.  Dr. Lawlis is a recipient of federal financial assistance and therefore subject to the \nnondiscrimination mandate in Section 1557 of the ACA.

Medical Guidelines for Treating Adolescents with Gender Dysphoria \n49.  Doctors in Oklahoma use evidence-based, well-researched, and widely accepted \nclinical practice and medical guidelines to assess, diagnose, and treat adolescents with gender \ndysphoria.  Decades of clinical experience and a large body of research have demonstrated that \nthese  treatments  are  safe  and  effective  at  treating  gender  dysphoria  in  adolescents,  and \nconsequently inform how this care is provided. \n50.  Gender identity refers to a personโs internal sense of belonging to a particular \ngender.  Everyone has a gender identity, and a personโs gender identity is durable and cannot be \naltered voluntarily or changed through medical intervention. \n51.  A personโs gender identity usually matches the sex they were designated at birth \nbased on their external genitalia.2 \n \n2 The terms โsex designated at birthโ or โsex assigned at birthโ are more precise than the term \nโbiological sexโ because there are many biological sex characteristics, and they do not always \nalign with each other.  For example, some people with intersex characteristics may have a \nchromosomal  configuration  typically  associated  with  a  male  sex  designation  but  genital \ncharacteristics typically associated with a female sex designation.  For these reasons, the Endocrine \nSociety, an international medical organization of over 18,000 endocrinology researchers and \nclinicians, warns practitioners that โthe terms biological sex and biological male or female are \n \n16 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 17 of 64\n \n52.  Most boys are designated male at birth based on their external genital anatomy, and \nmost girls are designated female at birth based on their external genital anatomy.  But transgender \npeople have a gender identity that differs from the sex assigned to them at birth.  A transgender \nboy is someone who was assigned a female sex at birth but has a male gender identity.  A \ntransgender girl is someone who was assigned a male sex at birth but has a female gender identity.  \nA transgender boy cannot simply turn off his gender identity like a switch, just as a non-\ntransgender (also known as โcisgenderโ) boy cannot turn off his gender identity.  A personโs sexual \norientation is a close analog.  A personโs sexual orientation is an innate, immutable characteristic \nthat, like a personโs gender identity, cannot be altered.  \n53.  The health and wellbeing of all people, including those who are transgender, \ndepends on their ability to live in a manner consistent with their gender identity.  For transgender \npeople, the incongruence between their gender identity and sex assigned at birth can cause \nclinically significant distress and discomfort. \n54.  According to the American Psychiatric Associationโs Diagnostic & Statistical \nManual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (โDSM-5-TRโ), โgender dysphoriaโ is \nthe diagnostic term for the condition experienced by some transgender people of clinically \nsignificant distress resulting from the lack of congruence between their gender identity and the sex \nassigned to them at birth.  To be diagnosed with gender dysphoria, the incongruence must have \n \nimprecise and should be avoided.โ  Wylie C.

Being transgender is not a medical condition to be treated or cured.  But gender \ndysphoriaโthe clinically significant distress that some transgender people experience as a result \nof the incongruence between their gender identity and sex assigned at birthโis a serious medical \ncondition.4  \n56.  The goal of treatment for gender dysphoria is not to change someoneโs gender \nidentity, but rather to resolve the distress associated with the incongruence between a transgender \npersonโs assigned sex at birth and their gender identity. \n57.  If left untreated, gender dysphoria can result in negative mental health outcomes, \nincluding severe anxiety and depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, substance \nabuse, self-harm, and suicidality. \n58.  The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (โWPATHโ) and the \nEndocrine Society have published evidence-based and widely accepted clinical practice guidelines \nfor the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of gender dysphoria.5  The medical treatment for \ngender dysphoria is to eliminate or alleviate the clinically significant distress by helping a \n \n3 AM.

This treatment is sometimes \nreferred to as โgender transition,โ โtransition-related care,โ or โgender-affirming care.โ  These \nclinical practice guidelines are widely accepted as best practices for the treatment of adolescents \nand adults diagnosed with gender dysphoria and have been recognized as authoritative by leading \nmedical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, which agree that this care \nis safe, effective, and medically necessary for many adolescents suffering from gender dysphoria. \n59.  The  precise  treatment  for  gender  dysphoria  depends  upon  each  personโs \nindividualized needs, and the guidelines for medical treatment differ depending on whether the \ntreatment is for an adolescent or an adult. \n60.  Before the onset of puberty, consistent with the WPATH Standards of Care and the \nEndocrine Society Clinical Guidelines, no medical interventions beyond mental health counseling \nare recommended or provided to any person.  In other words, gender transition does not include \nany pharmaceutical or surgical intervention before puberty.  Any transition before puberty is \nlimited to โsocial transition,โ which means allowing a transgender child to live and be socially \nrecognized in accordance with their gender identity.  Care is limited to supportive mental health \ncounseling.  Typically, social transition can include allowing children to wear clothing, cut or grow \ntheir hair, use chosen names and pronouns, and use restrooms and other sex-separated facilities \naligned with their gender identity instead of the sex assigned to them at birth. \n61.  Under  the  WPATH  Standards  of  Care  and  the  Endocrine  Society  Clinical \nGuidelines,  medical  interventions  may  become  medically  necessary  and  appropriate  as  a \ntransgender person reaches puberty.  In providing medical treatments to adolescents, qualified \nmedical providers work in close consultation with mental health professionals experienced in \ndiagnosing and treating gender dysphoria. \n19 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 20 of 64\n \n62.  For many transgender adolescents, the onset of puberty leading to physical changes \nin their bodies that are incongruent with their gender identities can cause extreme distress.  \nPuberty-delaying medication allows transgender adolescents to avoid this, therefore minimizing \nand  potentially  preventing  the  heightened  gender  dysphoria  caused  by  the  development  of \nsecondary sex characteristics incongruent with their gender identity. \n63.  Under the Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines, transgender adolescents who \nhave reached the onset of puberty may be eligible for puberty-delaying treatment if: \n๏ท  A qualified mental health professional has confirmed that: \no  The adolescent has demonstrated a long-lasting and intense pattern of gender \nnonconformity or gender dysphoria (whether suppressed or expressed); \no  Gender dysphoria worsened with the onset of puberty; \no  Any coexisting psychological, medical, or social problems that could interfere \nwith treatment (e.g., that may compromise treatment adherence) have been \naddressed,  such  that  the  adolescentโs  situation  and  functioning  are  stable \nenough to start treatment; \no  The adolescent has sufficient mental capacity to give informed consent to this \n(reversible) treatment; \n๏ท  And the adolescent: \no  Has been informed of the effects and side effects of treatment (including \npotential loss of fertility if the individual subsequently continues with sex \nhormone treatment) and options to preserve fertility; \no  Has given informed consent and (particularly when the adolescent has not \nreached the age of legal medical consent, depending on applicable legislation) \n20 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 21 of 64\n \nthe parents or other caretakers or guardians have consented to the treatment and \nare involved in supporting the adolescent throughout the treatment process; \n๏ท  And a pediatric endocrinologist or other clinician experienced in pubertal assessment: \no  Agrees  with the indication for gonadotropin-releasing hormone  (โGnRHโ) \nagonist treatment; \no  Has confirmed that puberty has started in the adolescent; \no  Has confirmed that there are no medical contraindications to GnRH agonist \ntreatment.6 \n64.  Puberty-delaying  treatment  is  reversible.    If  an  adolescent  discontinues  the \nmedication, endogenous puberty resumes.  Puberty-delaying treatment does not cause infertility.  \n65.  For some older adolescents, it may be medically necessary and appropriate to treat \nthem with gender-affirming hormone therapy (e.g., testosterone for transgender boys and estrogen \nand testosterone suppression for transgender girls). \n66.  Under the Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines, transgender adolescents may be \neligible for gender-affirming hormone therapy if: \n๏ท  A qualified mental health professional has confirmed: \no  The persistence of gender dysphoria; \no  Any coexisting psychological, medical, or social problems that could interfere \nwith treatment (e.g., that may compromise treatment adherence) have been \naddressed, such that the adolescentโs environment and functioning are stable \nenough to start sex hormone treatment; \n \n6 Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines at 3878 tbl.5. \n21 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 22 of 64\n \no  The adolescent has sufficient mental capacity to estimate the consequences of \nthis (partly) irreversible treatment, weigh the benefits and risks, and give \ninformed consent to this (partly) irreversible treatment; \n๏ท  And the adolescent: \no  Has been informed of the partly irreversible effects and side effects of treatment \n(including potential loss of fertility and options to preserve fertility); \no  Has given informed consent and (particularly when the adolescent has not \nreached the age of legal medical consent, depending on applicable legislation) \nthe parents or other caretakers or guardians have consented to the treatment and \nare involved in supporting the adolescent throughout the treatment process; \n๏ท  And a pediatric endocrinologist or other clinician experienced in pubertal induction: \no  Agrees with the indication for sex hormone treatment; \no  Has confirmed that there are no medical contraindications to sex hormone \ntreatment.7 \n67.  Gender-affirming hormone therapy does not necessarily result in a loss of fertility, \nand many individuals treated with hormone therapy can still biologically conceive children. \n68.  As with all medications that could affect fertility, transgender adolescents and their \nparents or guardians are counseled on the potential risks of the medical intervention, and treatment \nis only initiated where parents and adolescents are properly informed and consent/assent to the \ncare.  \n69.  Adolescents who first receive treatment later in puberty and are treated only with \ngender-affirming  hormone  therapy  (and  not  puberty-delaying  treatment)  also  go  through  a \n \n7 Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines at 3878 tbl.5. \n22 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 23 of 64\n \nhormonal puberty consistent with their gender identity.  However, they will have undergone \nphysical changes associated with their endogenous puberty that may not be wholly reversed by \nhormone therapy or even surgery later in life. \n70.  Under the WPATH Standards of Care, transgender adolescents also may receive \nmedically necessary chest reconstructive surgeries before the age of majority provided that the \nadolescent has lived in their affirmed gender for a significant period of time.8   \n71.  Medical treatment recommended for and provided to transgender adolescents with \ngender dysphoria can substantially reduce lifelong gender dysphoria and eliminate the medical \nneed for surgery or other medical interventions later in life. \n72.  Providing gender-affirming medical care can be lifesaving treatment and positively \nchange the short- and long-term health outcomes for transgender adolescents.  \n73.  The treatments used to treat gender dysphoria are also used to treat other conditions.  \nNeither the Health Care Ban nor SB 3 prohibits these treatments when used to treat any condition \nother than gender dysphoria, even though the treatments have comparable risks and side effects to \nthose that can be present when treating gender dysphoria.  The use of these treatments for gender \ndysphoria is not any riskier than for other conditions and diagnoses for which the same treatments \nare regularly used.  \nII.  SB 3 and the Closure of the Adolescent Medicine Roy G. Biv Program \n74.  In 2016, the Adolescent Medicine Roy G. Biv Program (โthe Roy G. Biv Programโ) \nat the Oklahoma Childrenโs Hospital was established.   \n75.  Oklahoma  Childrenโs  Hospital  is  a  โUniversity  Hospitalโ  covered  under  the \nUniversity Hospitals Authority Act and subject to the management and control of the University \n \n8 WPATH Standards of Care at S66. \n23 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 24 of 64\n \nHospitals Authority.  See Okla. Stat. tit, 63, ยงยง 3202(A)(1), 3204.  Oklahoma Childrenโs Hospital \nand the Roy G. Biv Program are associated with OU Health. \n76.  Plaintiff Dr. Lawlis has worked at the Roy G. Biv Program since 2017. \n77.  During its first six years of operation, the Roy G. Biv Program was the largest and \nonly multidisciplinary academic clinic in Oklahoma dedicated to providing care to transgender \nand gender diverse adolescents with medical and mental health services, including consultation \nfor families with gender diverse children. It provided mental health counseling, puberty-delaying \nmedications,  and  hormone  therapy  to  hundreds  of  adolescent  patients  experiencing  gender \ndysphoria.  \n78.  The Roy G. Biv Program treated patients in accordance with well-established, \nevidence-based clinical practice guidelines, including the WPATH Standards of Care and the \nEndocrine  Societyโs  Guidelines.  Prior  to  starting  puberty-delaying  medications  or  hormone \ntreatment, every patient was carefully assessed for gender dysphoria consistent with the established \nevidence-based guidelines. Ongoing mental health care was recommended as indicated for each \npatient based on the patientโs individual needs, and referrals were provided to patients and their \nfamilies, as necessary. \n79.  Prior to the passage of the SB 3, the Roy G. Biv Program was seeing more 350 \ntransgender and gender diverse adolescents of varying ages, only a subset of whom were receiving \ngender-affirming medical care in the form of puberty-delaying medications or hormone treatment \nas treatment for gender dysphoria. \n80.  Prior to the passage of the SB 3, Dr. Lawlis provided gender-affirming medical \ntreatment at the Roy G. Biv Program to transgender adolescents with gender dysphoria, including \n24 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 25 of 64\n \npuberty-delaying medication and hormone therapy where such treatment was medically indicated \nfor the patient. \n81.  On October 4, 2022, Governor Kevin Stitt signed SB 3 into law.     \n82.  SB 3 authorized and appropriated more than $108.5 million in federal funds from \nthe American Rescue Plan Act, Pub. L. No. 117โ2, 135 Stat. 4 (โARPAโ), to Defendant University \nHospitals Authority for a variety of medical services.  \n83.  SB 3 conditioned the appropriation to Defendant University Hospitals Authority of \nโthe sum of Thirty-nine Million Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($39,400,000.00) or so much \nthereof as may be necessary to budget and expend for the construction and equipping of facilities \ndesigned to expand the capacity of behavioral health care for the children of [Oklahoma]โ on โno \nmonies [being] budgeted or expended by the [University Hospitals] Authority for the benefit of \nany facility owned by the University Hospitals Authority or University Hospitals Trust performing \nโgender reassignment medical treatmentโ โฆ on children under eighteen (18) years of age.โ  \n84.  SB 3 defines โgender reassignment medical treatmentโ to mean โany health care to \nfacilitate the transitioning of a patientโs assigned gender identity on the patientโs birth certificate, \nto the gender identity experienced and defined by the patient.โ   \n85.  Under SB 3, โgender reassignment medical treatmentโ includes: โa. interventions \nto suppress the development of endogenous secondary sex characteristics, b. interventions to align \nthe patientโs appearance or physical body with the patientโs gender identity, and c. medical \ntherapies and medical intervention used to treat gender dysphoria.โ   \n86.  Under SB 3, โgender reassignment medical treatmentโ does not include โservices \nprovided to individuals born with ambiguous genitalia, incomplete genitalia, or both male and \nfemale anatomy, or biochemically verifiable disorder[s] of sex development (DSD), including but \n25 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 26 of 64\n \nnot limited to:  46,XX DSD; 46,XY DSD; sex chromosomes DSDs; XX or XY sex reversal; and \novotesticular disorder.โ \n87.  In response to SB 3, the Hospital Defendants ceased providing gender-affirming \nmedical care to patients under 18.   \n88.  Specifically, in or around October 2022, the following official statement was posted \non the website of Oklahoma Childrenโs Hospital: \n \n89.  Despite being health programs or activities  that receive federal and financial \nassistance, which are prohibited from discriminating on the basis of sex, to access the funds \nconditioned by SB 3, the Hospital Defendants are denying transgender adolescents and their  \nfamilies access to the same medical services and treatments they continue to provide to other \nadolescents (the โHospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policyโ) and they are doing so pursuant to a policy \nthat facially restricts treatment based on sex.  \n90.  To ensure continuity of care for her patients, Dr. Lawlis worked with Oklahoma \nChildrenโs Hospital and Diversity Family Health, a private health clinic that works primarily with \nthe LGBTQ community, to receive the credentials to provide care one day per week at Diversity \n26 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 27 of 64\n \nFamily Health to her Roy G. Biv Program patients who require prescriptions for puberty-delaying \nmedications and gender-affirming hormone therapy. \n91.  Dr. Lawlis also worked with other patients and their families to provide referrals to \nother providers so that they would not be adversely affected by the Hospital Defendantsโ decision \nto stop providing gender-affirming medical care in light of SB 3. \n92.  Although Dr. Lawlis has been able to provide necessary care to her patients one \nday per week at Diversity Family Health, Dr. Lawlis and her patients have been deprived of \nworking within a singular multidisciplinary clinic, which has caused significant distress for her \npatients and their families, as well as logistical difficulties. \n93.  Plaintiffs Peter Poe, Daphne Doe, and Lydia Loe obtained medical care for gender \ndysphoria at Oklahoma Childrenโs Hospital in Oklahoma City until the adoption of the Hospital \nDefendantsโ SB 3 Policy in response to SB 3.  Plaintiff Brandon Boe obtained medical care for \ngender dysphoria at OU Health. \n94.  As a result of the Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy, the OU Health Minor Plaintiffs \nhave been denied the care they previously had been receiving at Oklahoma Childrenโs Hospital.  \nThe Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy denying treatment to transgender adolescents also has \nforced the OU Health Parent Plaintiffs to incur costs to change providers or explore options to \ntravel out of state for access to the necessary treatments at issue.   \n95.  Although  the  Hospital  Defendants  have  stopped  providing  โhormone-related \nprescription  therapies  and  surgical  proceduresโ  to  transgender  adolescents  to  treat  gender \ndysphoria, they continue to provide those same treatments to patients under 18 for conditions other \nthan gender dysphoria. \n27 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 28 of 64\n \nIII.  The State Legislatureโs Passage of the Health Care Ban \n96.  On April 27, 2023, the Oklahoma State Legislature passed the Health Care Ban.  \nGovernor Stitt signed the Ban into law on May 1, 2023.  The Health Care Ban took effect \nimmediately. \n97.  The Health Care Ban prohibits health care providers from โknowingly provid[ing] \ngender transition proceduresโ to any person under eighteen years of age.  SB 613 at Section 1(B), \nto be codified at Okla. Stat. tit. 63, ยง 2607(1)(B). The Health Care Ban defines โgender transition \nproceduresโ as โmedical or surgical services performed for the purpose of attempting to affirm the \nminorโs perception of his or her gender or biological sex, if that perception is inconsistent with the \nminorโs biological sex,โ namely, โsurgical procedures that alter or remove physical or anatomical \ncharacteristics or features that are typical for the individualโs biological sexโ and โpuberty-\nblocking drugs, cross-sex hormones, or other drugs to suppress or delay normal puberty or to \npromote the development of feminizing or masculinizing features consistent with the opposite \nbiological  sex.โ    SB  613  at  Section  1(A)(1)โ(2),  to  be  codified  at  Okla.  Stat.  tit.  63,  ยง \n2607(1)(A)(1)โ(2).  \n98.  The Health Care Ban includes a phase-out provision allowing for โthe provision of \npuberty-blocking drugs or cross-sex hormones to a minor currently receiving such drugs or \nhormones as of the effective date of this act for a period of not more than six (6) months solely for \nthe purpose of assisting the minor with gradually decreasing and discontinuing use of the drugs or \nhormones.โ    SB  613  at  Section  1(A)(2)(b)(7),  to  be  codified  at  Okla.  Stat.  tit.  63,  ยง \n2607.1(A)(2)(b)(7).  The Health Care Ban does not allow the initiation of new gender-affirming \ncare during that six month period.  Id. \n99.  The Health Care Ban provides that healthcare providers who knowingly provide \ngender transition procedures to a person under eighteen years of age โshall, upon an adverse ruling \n28 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 29 of 64\n \nby the providerโs respective licensing board, be guilty of unprofessional conductโ and shall also \nโbe guilty of a felony.โ SB 613 at Section 1(C)โ(D), to be codified at Okla. Stat. tit. 63, \nยง 2607.1(C)โ(D). \n100.  Healthcare providers who violate the Ban are subject to civil actions from minors \nwho received gender transition procedures or their parents, and they may be sued by the Attorney \nGeneral.  See SB 613 at Section 1(E)โ(F), to be codified at Okla. Stat. tit. 63, ยง 2607.1(E)โ(F). \n101.  The legislative history of the Heath Care Ban demonstrates it has no legitimate \njustification.  Oklahoma lawmakers themselves confirmed the legislation was not based on \nevidence-based, well-researched, and widely accepted clinical practice and medical guidelines for \ntreating adolescents with gender dysphoria.   \n102.  As SB 613 moved through the legislature, several Oklahoma lawmakers made \ninflammatory  statements  about  transgender  people  establishing  that  the  legislation  targeting \ntransgender adolescents was based on the lawmakers own subjective, discriminatory beliefs. \n103.  On January 17, 2023, Senator Julie Daniels introduced SB 613 in the Senate.  As \nintroduced,  the  bill  prohibited  medical  professionals  from  providing  medically  appropriate \ntreatment for gender dysphoria to transgender adolescents under 18 years of age.  The introduced \nversion banned a broad range of widely accepted, evidence-based medical treatment protocols, \nincluding puberty-delaying medications, gender-affirming hormones, and other โmedical therapies \nand medical intervention used to treat gender dysphoria.โ  Under the introduced bill, medical \nprofessionals who provide such care would have their physicianโs or physician assistantโs licenses \nimmediately revoked by the state licensing board. \n29 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 30 of 64\n \n104.  On February 15, 2023, the Senate debated the legislation.  During the floor debate, \nSenator Daniels admitted she had not consulted with transgender adolescents or with providers, \nhospitals, or health centers providing medically appropriate care for transgender adolescents.   \n105.  Both Senator Daniels and Senator Greg Treat admitted during the floor debate that \nthey lack medical expertise.  During the same floor debate, Senator Shane Jett accused medical \nofficials of โgetting paidโ to promote gender-affirming care. \n106.  The Senate passed SB 613 on February 15, 2023, sending it to the House of \nRepresentatives for consideration. \n107.  On April 13, 2023, the House Public Health Committee held a hearing on SB 613.  \nRepresentative Toni Hasenbeck, a co-author of SB 613, admitted that medical professionals \nendorsing the medically-accepted protocols for treating gender dysphoria are not wrong. Yet, she \nnevertheless  agreed  with  statements  by  Representative  Randy  Randleman  that  transgender \nadolescents merely โtry to make decisions thatโs maybe popular to the public.โ  The House Public \nHealth Committee passed SB 613 out of committee the same day. \n108.  On April 26, 2023, the House added an emergency provision to SB 613 making the \nHealth Care Ban effective upon โits passage and approval.โ  The House also added provisions \ncriminalizing the provision of gender-affirming care, imposing fines, and creating a private cause \nof action.  The House passed SB 613, as amended, later that day.  The next day, April 27, 2023, \nSB 613 was engrossed to the Senate. \n109.  The Senate passed the House-amended version SB 613 on April 27, 2023 and it \nwas signed into law by Governor Stitt on May 1, 2023. \n110.  The Health Care Ban was just one of fifteen bills introduced in the Oklahoma State \nLegislature  during  the  2023  legislative  session  that  sought  to  prohibit  or  limit  medically-\n30 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 31 of 64\n \nappropriate treatment of gender dysphoria.  Other bills included HB 2177, SB 129, and SB 1011.  \nEach of these bills singled out medical care only when provided to transgender individuals in \nOklahoma. \n111.  The rhetoric Oklahoma lawmakers used when discussing the proposed legislation \ndemonstrated a marked anti-transgender animus and disregard for the well-established, evidence-\nbased protocols and practices for the treatment of gender dysphoria. \n112.  For example, during the floor debate for one of the bills seeking to ban health care \nfor transgender adolescents, HB 2177, co-author Representative Jim Olsen claimed transgender \nadolescents were โdelusional play actingโ and labeled them โmisguided children.โ  Representative \nOlsen  downplayed  clinical  experience,  scientific  and  medical  literature,  and  major  medical \nassociations supporting treatment of gender dysphoria, stating transgender adolescents are in need \nof โwise and clear biblical guidance.โ   \n113.   During the same hearing on HB 2177, Representative Justin Humphrey compared \ngender-affirming care to โstarving your child to death.โ \n114.  On April 26, 2023, when addressing SB 613, Representative Olsen stated that being \ntransgender was a path of โdesolation, destruction, degeneracy and delusional play acting.โ \n115.  In addition to SB 613, the Oklahoma State Legislature recently has enacted several \nother laws targeting transgender people for differential and discriminatory treatment.  In 2022 \nalone, the Oklahoma State Legislature passed SB 3, laws making it more difficult for transgender \nand nonbinary people to obtain identity documents, laws restricting transgender youthโs ability to \nparticipate fully in schools, and laws banning transgender students in public and charter schools \nfrom using the restrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity. \n31 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 32 of 64\n \n116.  Governor Stitt also has taken discriminatory action against transgender people in \nOklahoma.    On  November  10,  2021,  Governor  Stitt  signed  an  executive  order  ordering \nthe Oklahoma Health Department to stop issuing gender-neutral birth certificates.  Governor Stitt \nalso has signed an executive order preventing Oklahoma residents from changing their gender on \ntheir birth certificates. \n117.  These legislative enactments and executive actions by Oklahoma officials are \nexemplars of the long history of discrimination that transgender people have faced, and continue \nto face, in Oklahoma and throughout the country.  Notwithstanding that a personโs transgender \nstatus has no bearing on the personโs ability to contribute to society, transgender people are often \nthe target of discrimination and discriminatory laws. \n118.  Because transgender people remain a very small minority of the population, they \nare a discrete and insular group that lacks the political power to protect their rights through the \npolitical or legislative process.  For the most part, transgender people have been unable to secure \nexplicit state and federal protections against discrimination, and discriminatory legislation, such \nas the SB 3 and the Health Care Ban, continues to be enacted. \nIV.  The Impact of the Health Care Ban and the Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy on \nPlaintiffs \n1.  The Poe Family \n119.  Peter Poe is a twelve-year-old boy living in Oklahoma with his family.  Peter has \nan interest in animals and wants to be a zoologist when he grows up.  Peter also loves to draw, \npaint, and play video games. \n120.  Peter is transgender.  He is a boy with a male gender identity, but when he was \nborn, he was designated as female. \n32 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 33 of 64\n \n121.  Growing up, Peter was always very masculine.  He preferred more masculine \nclothing and hairstyles and often played with his shirt off.  When he was seven years old he knew \nthat he did not like the name his parents gave him and asked to be called a boyโs name.  Peter was \nconfused when his family told him he was a girl because he felt like a boy. \n122.  When Peter began puberty, he started to experience extreme anxiety and had trouble \nsleeping.  Peter wanted to hide his body.  Peter was initially afraid to tell his parents that he was a \nboy, but, when he was ten years old, he told his parents that he was a boy and wanted a boyโs \nname. \n123.  Paula and Patrick, Peterโs parents, arranged for Peter to see a therapist to discuss \nhis feelings.  Eventually, Peter and his family met with Dr. Lawlis at the Roy G. Biv Program.  \nPeter was also referred to a psychiatrist. \n124.  Eventually, Peter was diagnosed with gender dysphoria.  After evaluation, Peter \nwas prescribed Lupron to stop Peter from experiencing puberty. \n125.  Despite being afraid of needles, Peter began Lupron injections to treat his gender \ndysphoria.  The Lupron injections stopped Peter from going through puberty. \n126.  Peter has been taking Lupron for over a year and is much happier now that people \nrecognize him as a boy.  Peter feels less of a need to hide his body.  He has become much more \nsocial and outgoing after receiving Lupron.  Peter eventually wants to begin taking testosterone \nand go through puberty as a boy. \n127.  Unless the Health Care Ban is blocked, under the six-month phase out period that \nthe Health Care Ban imposes, Peterโs medication can be prescribed only โfor the purpose of \nassisting [him] with gradually decreasing and discontinuing useโ of his medication. As Peter \nbegins receiving sub-therapeutic doses, he will begin to go through endogenous puberty. \n33 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 34 of 64\n \n128.  Peter and his parents are afraid of the impact the Health Care Ban will have on him \nand his family.  Peter is afraid to lose access to Lupron and horrified at the prospect of going \nthrough female puberty.  Peterโs parents are worried about Peterโs risks of self-harm if he loses \naccess to his gender-affirming care. \n129.  Peter has spent his entire life in Oklahoma.  His school, family, and friends are all \nin Oklahoma.  Peter never imagined leaving Oklahoma and the idea of having to move saddens \nhim.  The Poe family is part of a supporting and welcoming community in Oklahoma.  They do \nnot want to move, but it may be their only option for Peter to receive the gender-affirming care he \nneeds for his gender dysphoria. \n2.  The Doe Family \n130.  Daphne Doe is a fifteen-year-old girl who lives with her grandmother Donna in \nOklahoma.  Daphne is a freshman in high school and a straight A student.  She is involved in the \nFrench Club and academic team and wants to become an attorney.  \n131.  Daphne is transgender.  She is a girl with a female gender identity, but when she \nwas born, she was designated as male. \n132.  Daphne has always felt more like a girl than a boy.  As a toddler, Daphne told her \ngrandmother that she was a girl.  Growing up Daphne loved to play with dolls and dresses.  She \nalways gravitated towards playing with other girls. \n133.  Even  before  she  began  puberty,  Daphne  informed  her  grandmother  and  her \ntherapist that she did not want to experience puberty as a boy and wanted to be seen as a girl. \n134.  In middle school,  Daphne began  experiencing  male puberty.  These changes \nconfirmed for Daphne what she already knew: she was a girl.  Daphne became depressed, anxious, \n34 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 35 of 64\n \nwithdrawn, and began experiencing suicidal thoughts.  Around this time, Daphne began seeing a \npsychologist who eventually diagnosed her with gender dysphoria. \n135.  Donna took Daphne to see Dr. Lawlis at Oklahoma Childrenโs Hospital.  Dr. Lawlis \nalso diagnosed Daphne with gender dysphoria.  After being advised about their options, Daphne \nand Donna decided that Daphne would start puberty-delaying medications.  Daphne began taking \npuberty-blocking medication when she was thirteen, and roughly a year later, she started taking \nestrogen. \n136.  Since Daphne began receiving gender-affirming treatment, she has experienced a \nsignificant improvement in her wellbeing.  Daphne is less insecure, feels less anxious, and loves \nbeing able to dress and look the way that she wants. \n137.  Unless the Health Care Ban is blocked, under the six-month phase out period that \nthe Health Care Ban imposes, Daphneโs medication can be prescribed only โfor the purpose of \nassisting [her] with gradually decreasing and discontinuing useโ of her medication.  When Daphne \nbegins receiving sub-therapeutic doses of estrogen and puberty-delaying medication, she will \nlikely begin developing secondary sex characteristics inconsistent with her gender identity, such \nas facial hair and an Adamโs apple.  \n138.  The Health Care Ban would prevent Daphne from receiving the gender-affirming \ncare that she needs and that has greatly improved her quality of life.  Daphne is worried that without \npuberty-delaying medication and estrogen she will go back to the dark place she was in prior to \nreceiving gender-affirming care.  Donna is worried about her granddaughterโs risk of suicidality if \nshe can no longer access puberty-delaying medication or hormones. \n139.  If Daphne is not able to receive gender-affirming care in Oklahoma due to the \nHealth Care Ban, it would be extremely difficult for Donna to afford Daphneโs medical care out \n35 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 36 of 64\n \nof state.  Despite the extreme financial burden, Donna is researching Daphneโs out-of-state options \nto receive care. \n140.  Donna wants to continue raising her granddaughter in Oklahoma, where they have \na strong network of friends and where Donna has lived for over forty years.  Moving from \nOklahoma is not an option for the Doe family, and Donna does not want Daphne to be forced out \nof Oklahoma for simply being who she is.  \n3.  The Boe Family \n141.  Brandon is a seventeen-year-old boy who lives in Tulsa County with his parents \nBenjamin and Bethany and his younger sibling.  Brandon enjoys geology and wants to study \nengineering in college. \n142.  Brandon is transgender.  He is a boy with a male gender identity, but when he was \nborn, he was designated as female. \n143.  As a child, there were clear signs Brandon was a boy.  He always preferred \nmasculine activities and clothing.  In school, he told his teachers that he did not want to line up \nwith the girls.  Whenever Brandon would draw himself, he drew himself as a boy. \n144.  Just before Brandon turned fifteen, he told his parents he was transgender and that \nit was something he had been thinking about for a long time.  Brandonโs parents asked him if he \nwas sure, and Brandon explained that he was sure he was a boy. \n145.  Brandon began using a binder to make his chest appear more masculine and realized \nhow much it hurt him to be misgendered.  Brandon did not want to leave the house without his \nbinder, he would not take his mask off in public, and he would avoid speaking because he did not \nwant to be misgendered as a girl.  It is important to Brandon to be recognized as a boy because he \nis a boy. \n36 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 37 of 64\n \n146.  After Brandon came out, his parents found him mental health counseling.  In \ncounseling, Brandon was diagnosed with gender dysphoria. \n147.  Originally, Brandonโs parents wanted him to wait until he was eighteen to start \nundergoing medical treatments for his gender dysphoria.  However, after seeing how Brandon was \nstruggling and how isolated he was becoming, they had a change of heart. \n148.  Brandonโs parents researched gender-affirming care and eventually reached out to \nan endocrinologist at OU Health. After over a year of therapy, reviewing available literature, and \nconversations among Brandon, his parents, and his medical providers, Brandon and his family \ndecided that he would start hormone therapy.  By the time Brandon began testosterone, he had \nbeen living socially as a boy for nearly two years. \n149.  Brandon has become much more confident after receiving gender-affirming care.  \nHe is more joyful, less irritable, and overall, at peace with himself.  Brandon attends school dances \nwith friends and recently took a job that requires him to speak to strangers. \n150.  Unless the Health Care Ban is blocked, under the six-month phase out period that \nthe Health Care Ban imposes, Brandonโs medication can be prescribed only โfor the purpose of \nassisting [him] with gradually decreasing and discontinuing useโ of his medication. As Brandon \nreceives sub-therapeutic doses of testosterone, he will stop developing the masculine secondary \nsex characteristics that have greatly improved his wellbeing, confidence, and ability to participate \nin society as a boy.   \n151.  Brandon and his family are afraid of the impact the Health Care Ban would have \non Brandon.  Brandon is terrified of how his body would change if he can no longer receive \nhormone treatment.  Brandonโs parents are worried about Brandonโs mental health and his risk of \nsuicidality if he is unable to continue receiving gender-affirming testosterone treatment. \n37 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 38 of 64\n \n152.  Due to the Health Care Ban, Benjamin and Bethany are researching how to obtain \nthe gender-affirming care their son needs out of state.  The Boe family wants to remain in \nOklahoma: they have lived here for generations, and Brandon has a supportive group of friends, a \ncommunity, and a job.  But Brandonโs parents worry it is unsafe for him to stay here.  \n4.  The Loe Family \n153.  Lydia is a sixteen-year-old girl who lives in Oklahoma with her mother Lauren.  \nLydia is witty, creative, and cares deeply for her family and close group of supportive friends.  \n154.  Lydia is transgender.  She is a girl with a female gender identity, but she was \ndesignated as male. \n155.  Growing up, Lydia knew that being a boy did not fit.  Eventually, she realized that \nwas because she is a girl.   \n156.  Lydia lived in foster care before Lauren fostered and eventually adopted her.  In \nprior placements, after Lydia told her foster parents she was a girl, they rejected her. One of her \nformer foster parents told her she was โgrossโ after she told them she was a girl.  Thereafter, Lydia \nbegan to hide who she truly was for fear of continued rejection. \n157.  When Lydia was fourteen, Lauren became her foster parent.  After about a year, \nLydia told Lauren that she was truly a girl, and Lauren was supportive. \n158.  Since then, Lydia was able to explore expressing herself as she was.  She began \nusing a girlโs name, wearing girlโs clothing, and trying female hairstyles and makeup.  Lydiaโs \nmood improved when she was able to express herself.  However, even as the pandemic improved, \nLydia rarely left the house. \n159.  Eventually, Lydia was diagnosed with gender dysphoria. \n38 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 39 of 64\n \n160.  After more than a year of additional counseling, extensive tests, and conversations \nwith Lydiaโs doctors at Oklahoma Childrenโs Hospital about the risks and benefits of hormone \ntherapy, Lydia started estrogen and spironolactone. \n161.  After receiving gender-affirming hormone therapy, Lydiaโs mental health and \nmood have drastically improved.  She spends more time with her friends and family and is more \ncomfortable with how she is and what she looks like.  Lydia is finally able to leave the house \nwithout fear of being misgendered. \n162.  When SB 3 went into effect, Lydia ceased receiving treatment from Oklahoma \nChildrenโs Hospital and began receiving her treatment from Diversity Health Clinic. \n163.  Unless the Health Care Ban is blocked, under the six-month phase out period that \nthe Health Care Ban imposes, Lydiaโs medication can be prescribed only โfor the purpose of \nassisting [her] with gradually decreasing and discontinuing useโ of her medication.  As she begins \nreceiving sub-therapeutic doses of estrogen and spironolactone, she will likely begin developing \nsecondary sex characteristics that are incongruent with her gender identity, such as facial hair and \na deeper voice.   \n164.  Lydia and her family are scared of the impact the Health Care Ban would have on \nher life.  If she is unable to continue receiving gender-affirming care, Lydia is afraid she would \nturn into someone she is not and would not be able to look at herself in the mirror without distress.  \nLauren is concerned that her daughterโs mental health will deteriorate if she is forced to stop \ntreatment, or that she will return to the risk of suicidality and self-harm she experienced before \nreceiving gender-affirming treatment. \n39 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 40 of 64\n \n5.  The Roe Family \n165.  Ryan is a fourteen-year-old boy living in Oklahoma with his parents Richard and \nRachel Roe.  Ryan loves theater, acting, and costume design.  \n166.  Ryan is transgender.  He is a boy with a male gender identity, but he was designated \nas female. \n167.  As  a  child,  Ryan  did  not  feel  comfortable  with  the  expected  interests  and \nexpressions typically associated with girls.  His mother, a mental health professional, understood \nhow important it was to allow Ryan to express himself as he truly was. \n168.  As Ryan approached puberty, he began to experience depression, anxiety, and loss \nof appetite.  He was uncomfortable being perceived as female and was distressed about the conflict \nbetween his body and who he is. \n169.  Around  this  same  time,  Ryan  began  seeing  a  therapist.    Eventually  he  was \ndiagnosed with gender dysphoria. \n170.  In or around 2021, Ryan began working with medical professionals experienced \nwith treating gender dysphoria.  After receiving advice from his medical team, Ryan and his \nparents decided that he would begin period blockers and eventually puberty-delaying treatment. \n171.  Receiving  gender-affirming  care  for  Ryanโs  gender  dysphoria,  along  with  a \nsupportive community and therapy, have significantly improved Ryanโs mental health.  Ryan is \nrelieved that that he has not undergone puberty as a girl.   \n172.  Rachel has observed the dramatic positive impact treatment has had on her son.  \nRyan has become a confident young man who excels in school. \n173.  Unless the Health Care Ban is blocked, under the six-month phase out period that \nthe Health Care Ban imposes, Ryanโs medication can be prescribed only โfor the purpose of \n40 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 41 of 64\n \nassisting [him] with gradually decreasing and discontinuing useโ of his medication.  As Ryan \nbegins  to  receive  sub-therapeutic  doses  of  puberty-delaying  medication,  he  will  begin  to \nexperience endogenous puberty, leading to the development of secondary sex characteristics that \nare incongruent with his gender identity as a boy.  \n174.  The Health Care Ban has caused Ryan and his family distress.  Ryan is terrified at \nthe prospect of losing access to his gender-affirming treatment.  He fears having to live in a body \nthat is not consistent with who he is.  Ryanโs parents are concerned about the physical and mental \nconsequences of depriving Ryan of the gender-affirming care he needs. \n175.  Ryan and his family have lived in Oklahoma their entire lives and moving out of \nstate is not a realistic option for them.  It is the only home that Ryan has ever known, and he has a \nsupportive community of friends and family in Oklahoma.  However, Richard and Rachel are \nconsidering having Ryan move across the country to live with a family member.  The Roes do not \nwant to split up their family for Ryan to continue to receive his gender-affirming health care. \n6.  The Medical Provider Plaintiff \n176.  Prior to SB 3, Dr. Lawlis treated transgender adolescents at the Roy G. Biv Program \nat Oklahoma Childrenโs Hospital, a multidisciplinary academic clinic.  Dr. Lawlis was able to \nprescribe puberty-delaying medication and gender-affirming hormone treatment to adolescent \npatients with gender dysphoria when medically indicated. \n177.  Following the passage of SB 3, as a result of the Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy, \nDr. Lawlis no longer was able to provide this care at Oklahoma Childrenโs Hospital.  \n178.  To ensure continuity of care for her patients, Dr. Lawlis had to obtain credentials \nto provide care to her patients one day a week at a private health clinic.  Although this move \nallowed for continuity of care, it deprived Dr. Lawlis and her patients of working within a singular \n41 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 42 of 64\n \nmultidisciplinary clinic, which caused significant distress for her patients and their families, as \nwell as logistical difficulties. \n179.  With the enactment of SB 613, Dr. Lawlis now is prohibited from providing \npuberty-delaying medications and gender-affirming hormone therapy to her transgender patients \nanywhere in Oklahoma because the treatments relate to โgender transition.โ  She can, however, \ncontinue providing the same kinds of treatments to her cisgender patients, such as testosterone \nsuppressants for her cisgender female adolescent patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome, in \npart so that they do not develop body hair inconsistent with their gender identity.  \n180.  Dr. Lawlis is very concerned about the effect the Health Care Ban will have on her \ntransgender patients.  Based on her personal experience treating hundreds of adolescents with \ngender dysphoria, she believes that denying them access to gender-affirming care will significantly \nand severely compromise their health, including causing increased depression, anxiety, and \nsuicidal ideation.  Denying her patients medically necessary and often lifesaving health care \nviolates the tenets of her profession by leaving her patients to suffer needless pain.   \n181.  As a medical provider of patients who experience gender dysphoria, Dr. Lawlis has \ndeveloped a close relationship with both her patients and their families.  Seeking and receiving \ntreatment for gender dysphoria is a profoundly personal and informed decision based on a personโs \ninnermost sense of self and individual needs.  It is also a subject that remains very misunderstood \nby the public at large.  Many of her patients therefore require complete privacy, and Dr. Lawlis \nbelieves that, as a medical provider, it is her duty and obligation to advocate on behalf of her \npatients who are unable to publicly advocate for themselves. \n182.  The Health Care Banโs six-month period for gradually decreasing her patientsโ \nmedications does not alleviate Dr. Lawlisโ serious concerns.  Providing her patients with sub-\n42 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 43 of 64\n \ntherapeutic doses of puberty-blocking medication or hormones would be inconsistent with the \nevidence-based  medicine  that  she  practices,  and  she  fully  expects,  based  on  her  clinical \nobservations when patients have experienced interruptions or delays in their care, that they will \nexperience worsening gender dysphoria and the attendant distress.  \n183.  The Health Care Ban puts Dr. Lawless and other health care providers in the \nuntenable position of either following state law and violating their ethical duties to promote their \npatientsโ wellbeing and protect them from harm or facing administrative, criminal, and civil \npenalties.  Either outcome results in harm to patients. \nV.  The Health Care Ban and the Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy Classify Based on \nTransgender Status and Sex. \n184.  The Health Care Ban and the Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy prohibit the \nprovision  of  evidence-based,  medically  necessary  treatmentsโincluding  puberty-delaying \ntreatment, hormone therapy, and reconstructive chest surgeryโonly when they are provided to \ntransgender adolescents as part of treatment for gender dysphoria or gender-affirming care.  They \npermit these same treatments for non-transgender adolescents for other purposes. \n185.  The  Health  Care  Ban  prohibits  any  โhealth  care  providerโ  from  โknowingly \nprovid[ing] gender transition procedures to any child,โ which it defines as โmedical or surgical \nservices performed for the purpose of attempting to affirm the minorโs perception of his or her \ngender or biological sex, if that perception is inconsistent with the minor's biological sex,โ namely, \nโ(1) surgical procedures that alter or remove physical or anatomical characteristics or features that \nare typical for the individualโs biological sex, or (2) puberty-blocking drugs, cross-sex hormones, \nor other drugs to suppress or delay normal puberty or to promote the development of feminizing \nor masculinizing features consistent with the opposite biological sex.โ  SB 613 at Section 1(A)โ\n43 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 44 of 64\n \n(B), to be codified at Okla. Stat. tit. 63, ยง 2607(1)(A)โ(B).  The same services, however, may be \nprovided if they are used to treat other conditions. \n186.  Likewise, SB 3, which led to the Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy, explicitly \ndefines prohibited โgender reassignment medical treatmentโ to include โmedical therapies and \nmedical intervention used to treat gender dysphoria.โ  It expressly excludes from the ban โservices \nprovided to individuals born with ambiguous genitalia, incomplete genitalia, or both male and \nfemale anatomy, or biochemically verifiable disorder[s] of sex development.โ \n187.  For example, the puberty-delaying treatment provided to transgender adolescents \nexperiencing gender dysphoria is commonly used to treat central precocious puberty. The Health \nCare Ban and the Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy prohibit providing puberty-delaying treatment \nto transgender adolescents for gender dysphoria but permit puberty-delaying treatment for central \nprecocious puberty. \n188.  The Health Care Ban and the Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy also prohibit \nhormone  therapy  when  the  treatment  is  used  to  treat  transgender  adolescents  with  gender \ndysphoria.  But they permit the same hormone therapy when prescribed to non-transgender patients \nto treat other serious conditions and/or to help bring their bodies into alignment with their gender \nidentity.  \n189.  The Health Care Ban and the Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy prohibit chest \nsurgery on transgender young men to treat gender dysphoria, but non-transgender adolescents are \npermitted to undergo comparable surgeries. \n190.  Indeed, in drafting the Health Care Ban, Senator Daniels reached out to OU Health, \nbut not to ascertain their medical opinion about gender-affirming care; she reached out to ensure \nthat SB 613, which includes a list of procedures not covered, would not prohibit the provision of \n44 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 45 of 64\n \nthe medical treatments to adolescents in any circumstance other than when used for the treatment \nof a transgender adolescentโs gender dysphoria.   \nVI.  The Health Care Ban and the Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy Will Cause Severe \nHarm to Transgender Adolescents. \n191.  Withholding medical treatment from adolescents with gender dysphoria when it is \nmedically indicated puts them at risk of extreme harm to their health and wellbeing. \n192.  Adolescents with untreated gender dysphoria suffer significant distress.  Many are \non medication for depression and anxiety as a result of not being able to obtain care. Self-harm \nand suicidal ideation are exceedingly common.  Suicidality among transgender adolescents is a \ncrisis.  In one survey, more than half of transgender youths had seriously contemplated suicide.9  \nStudies have found that as many as 40% of transgender people have attempted suicide at some \npoint in their lives.10 \n193.  When adolescents have access to puberty-delaying drugs and hormone therapy, \nwhich prevents them from going through endogenous puberty and allows them to go through \npuberty consistent with their gender identity, their dysphoria decreases and their mental health \nimproves.  Both clinical experience and multiple medical and scientific studies confirm that for \nmany young people, this  treatment not only is safe and effective, but it also  is  positively \ntransformative.  Indeed, transgender adolescents able to access this  medically necessary and \nevidence-based medical care often go from painful suffering to becoming thriving young persons. \n \n9 TREVOR PROJECT, NATIONAL SURVEY ON LGBTQ YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH 2022, at 6 (2022), \nhttps://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2022/assets/static/trevor01_2022survey_final.pdf  (59 \npercent of transgender boys, 48 percent of transgender girls, and 53 percent of nonbinary youth \nconsidered suicide in the past year). \n10 SANDY E. JAMES ET AL., NATโL CTR. FOR TRANSGENDER EQUAL., REPORT OF THE 2015 U.S. \nTRANSGENDER SURVEY 5 (2016), https://transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS-Full-\nReport-Dec17.pdf \n45 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 46 of 64\n \n194.  If a healthcare provider is forced to stop puberty-delaying drugs or hormone therapy \ndue to the Health Care Ban, it will cause patients to resume their endogenous puberty.  This will \nresult in extreme distress for patients who have been relying on medical treatments to prevent the \nsecondary sex characteristics that come with their endogenous puberty.  These bodily changes are \nextremely distressing for transgender adolescents with gender dysphoria that otherwise had been \nrelieved by medical treatment. \n195.  Additionally, the effects of underdoing endogenous puberty may not be reversible \neven with subsequent hormone therapy and surgery in adulthood, thus exacerbating lifelong gender \ndysphoria in patients who have this evidence-based and medically necessary treatment withheld \nor withdrawn.  Bodily changes from puberty to stature, facial appearance, genital growth, voice, \nand breast development can be more difficult or even impossible to counteract. \n196.  For patients currently undergoing treatment with gender-affirming hormones like \nestrogen or testosterone, withdrawing care can result in a range of serious physiological and mental \nhealth consequences.  The body takes about six weeks to ramp up endogenous hormones.  If a \nhealthcare provider is forced to abruptly stop treatment, a patient will be without sufficient \ncirculating hormones.  This can result in depressed mood, hot flashes, and headaches.  For patients \non  spironolactoneโa  testosterone  suppressantโabruptly  terminating  treatment  can  cause  a \npatientโs blood pressure to spike, increasing a young personโs risk of heart attack or stroke.  But \nwhether care is stopped abruptly or over a period of several months, the withdrawal of gender-\naffirming care results in predictable and negative mental health consequences, including returned \nor worsening gender dysphoria, along with heightened anxiety and depression. \n46 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 47 of 64\n \n197.  Laws like the Health Care Ban and the Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy that \nprohibit access to medically necessary health care in and of themselves gravely and directly \nthreaten the mental health and wellbeing of transgender adolescents in Oklahoma. \n198.  Gender-affirming medical care can be beneficial and even lifesaving treatment for \ntransgender adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria.  The major medical and mental health \nassociations in the United States support the provision of such care.  \n199.

By enforcing the Health Care Ban, the State Official Defendants are engaging in \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex and transgender status in violation of all Plaintiffsโ Fourteenth \nAmendment rights to equal protection under the law. \n203.  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, enforceable pursuant \nto 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, provides that no state shall โdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the \nequal protection of the laws.โ  U.S. CONST. AMEND. XIV, ยง 1. It protects individuals and groups \nfrom discrimination by the government. \n204.  The Health Care Ban classifies based on sex and transgender status on its face.  The \nBan harms transgender adolescents, including the Minor Plaintiffs and the patients whom the \nMedical Provider Plaintiff treats, by denying them medically necessary care because of their sex \nand because of their transgender status.  \n205.   The Health Care Ban also discriminates against the Parent Plaintiffs by denying \nthem the same ability to secure necessary medical care for their children that other parents can \nobtain, and it does so on the basis of sex and transgender status. \n206.  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, government \ndiscrimination based on sex is presumptively unconstitutional and subject to heightened judicial \nscrutiny, placing a demanding burden of justification upon the State to provide at least an \nexceedingly persuasive justification for the differential treatment. \n207.  Discrimination on the basis of nonconformity with sex stereotypes, transgender \nstatus,  gender,  gender  identity,  gender  transition,  and  sex  characteristics  are  all  forms  of \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex. \n49 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 50 of 64\n \n208.  Under  the  Equal  Protection  Clause,  government  discrimination  based  on \ntransgender  status  also  is  presumptively  unconstitutional  and  subject  to  at  least  heightened \nscrutiny.   \n209.  Transgender people have suffered a long history of discrimination in Oklahoma and \nacross the country and continue to suffer such discrimination to this day.  Transgender persons are \na discrete and insular group and lack the political power to protect their rights through the \nlegislative process. They largely have been unable to secure explicit state and federal protections \nto protect against discrimination.  A personโs transgender status bears no relation to their ability to \ncontribute to society.  And gender identity is a core, defining trait so fundamental to oneโs identity \nand conscience that a person cannot be required to abandon it as a condition of equal treatment. \n210.  Treatment for gender dysphoriaโa condition that only transgender people suffer \nfromโis always aimed at affirming a gender identity that differs from a personโs assigned sex at \nbirth.  Discrimination against individuals based on gender dysphoria is discrimination based on \nsex and transgender status. \n211.  By its very terms, the Health Care Ban facially discriminates on the basis of sex \nand transgender status.  It prohibits a โhealth care providerโ from โknowingly provid[ing] gender \ntransition procedures to any child,โ which it defines as services โattempting to affirm the minorโs \nperception  of  his  or  her  gender  or  []  sex,โ  such  as  โprocedures  that  alter  or  remove  โฆ \ncharacteristics or features โฆ typical for the individualโs biological sexโ or that โpromote the \ndevelopment of feminizing or masculinizing features consistent with the opposite biological sex.โ \n212.  By enforcing the Health Care Ban, the State Official Defendants are engaging in \nconstitutionally impermissible discrimination based on sex and transgender status. \n50 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 51 of 64\n \n213.  The Health Care Ban prohibits medical treatments when provided to transgender \nadolescents to help align their bodies with their gender identity but permits the same medical \ntreatments when provided to non-transgender patients to help align their bodies with their gender \nidentity or for any other purpose.   \n214.  The Health Care Ban prohibits the Medical Provider Plaintiff from providing \ncertain medically necessary treatments to her transgender adolescent patients but permits her to \nprovide the same medical care to her non-transgender adolescent patients.  \n215.  Under the terms of the Heath Care Ban, whether a person can receive certain \nmedical treatment turns on their assigned sex at birth. \n216.  Under the terms of the Heath Care Ban, whether a person can receive certain \nmedical treatment turns on whether they are transgender. \n217.  Under the terms of the Heath Care Ban, whether a person can receive certain \nmedical treatment turns on whether the care tends to reinforce or disrupt stereotypes associated \nwith a personโs sex assigned at birth. \n218.  Discrimination based on the exercise of a fundamental right also is presumptively \nunconstitutional  and  is  subject  to  strict  scrutiny.    The  Health  Care  Ban  unconstitutionally \ndiscriminates against the Parent Plaintiffs in the exercise of their fundamental right to make \ndecisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children by prohibiting them from \nseeking and following medical advice to protect the health and wellbeing of their minor children. \n219.  The Heath Care Ban does nothing to protect the health or wellbeing of minors.  To \nthe contrary, it gravely threatens the health and wellbeing of adolescents with gender dysphoria by \ndenying them access to evidence-based, medically necessary, and often lifesaving medical care. \n51 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 52 of 64\n \n220.  The Health Care Ban is not narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental \ninterest.  It is not substantially related to any important government interest.  And it is not rationally \nrelated to any legitimate government interest. \n221.  The  Health  Care  Banโs  targeted  prohibition  on  medically  necessary  care  for \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria is based on generalized fears, negative attitudes, \nstereotypes, and moral disapproval of transgender people, which are not legitimate bases for \nunequal treatment under any level of scrutiny. \n222.  The Health Care Ban, on its face and as applied to the Minor Plaintiffs, the Parent \nPlaintiffs, and the patients of the Medical Provider Plaintiff, deprives transgender adolescents and \ntheir parents or guardians of their right to equal protection of the laws and stigmatizes them as \nsecond-class citizens in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \nThe Health Care Ban also inflicts upon transgender adolescents and their parents, including the \nMinor Plaintiffs, the Parent Plaintiffs, and the patients of the Medical Provider Plaintiff, distress, \nhumiliation, embarrassment, emotional pain and anguish, violation of their dignity, and harms to \ntheir short- and long-term health and wellbeing from being denied access to medically necessary \nhealth care. \n223.  The State Official Defendants are all governmental actors and/or employees acting \nunder color of State law for purposes of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and the Fourteenth Amendment and \nliable for their violation of Plaintiffsโ rights to equal protection under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  \n224.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaratory judgment that the Health Care Ban violates \nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.   \n52 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 53 of 64\n \n225.  Plaintiffs also are entitled to preliminary and permanent relief.  Without preliminary \nand permanent injunctive relief, Plaintiffs will suffer and/or continue to suffer irreparable harm.  \nPlaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to redress the wrongs alleged. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \nFourteenth Amendment โ Equal Protection (SB 3) \nOU Health Minor Plaintiffs Against the Hospital Official Defendants \n226.  Plaintiffs  reallege  and  incorporate  by  reference  paragraphs  1  to  200  of  this \nComplaint as though fully set forth herein. \n227.  By enforcing their SB 3 Policy, the Hospital Official Defendants are engaging in \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex and transgender status in violation of the OU Health Minor \nPlaintiffsโ Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection under the law. \n228.  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, enforceable pursuant \nto 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, provides that no state shall โdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the \nequal protection of the laws.โ  U.S. CONST. AMEND. XIV, ยง 1. It protects individuals and groups \nfrom discrimination by the government. \n229.  The Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy classifies based on sex and transgender \nstatus.  \n230.  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, government \ndiscrimination based on sex is presumptively unconstitutional and subject to heightened judicial \nscrutiny. \n231.  Under  the  Equal  Protection  Clause,  government  discrimination  based  on \ntransgender  status  also  is  presumptively  unconstitutional  and  subject  to  at  least  heightened \nscrutiny. \n53 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 54 of 64\n \n232.  The SB 3 Policy harms transgender adolescents, including the OU Health Minor \nPlaintiffs, by denying them medically necessary care because of their sex and because of their \ntransgender status. \n233.  By their very terms, SB 3 and the Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy facially \ndiscriminate based on sex and transgender status. SB 3 prohibits Defendant University Hospitals \nAuthority from budgeting or expending any of the $39.4 million appropriated โfor the construction \nand equipping of facilities designed to expand the capacity of behavioral health care for the \nchildrenโ for the benefit of a facility providing โgender reassignment medical treatmentโ to any \npatient under 18, including โa. interventions to suppress the development of endogenous secondary \nsex characteristics, b. interventions to align the patientโs appearance or physical body with the \npatientโs gender identity, and c. medical therapies and medical intervention used to treat gender \ndysphoria.โ   \n234.  In response to SB 3, the Hospital Defendants decided to stop providing โgender-\naffirming servicesโ to patients under 18 to access the funds appropriated under SB 3. \n235.  The Hospital Defendants continue to provide the same services to non-transgender \nadolescents for other purposes. \n236.  By acquiescing to SB 3 and voluntarily deciding to no longer provide gender-\naffirming medical services to transgender adolescents, the Hospital Defendants are engaging in \nconstitutionally impermissible discrimination based on sex and transgender status. \n237.  Under the terms of the Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy, whether a person can \nreceive certain medical treatment turns on their assigned sex at birth. \n238.  Under the terms of the Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy, whether a person can \nreceive certain medical treatment turns on whether they are transgender. \n54 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 55 of 64\n \n239.  Under the terms of the Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy, whether a person can \nreceive certain medical treatment turns on whether the care tends to reinforce or disrupt stereotypes \nassociated with a personโs sex assigned at birth. \n240.  The Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy does  nothing to protect the health or \nwellbeing of minors. To the contrary, it gravely threatens the health and wellbeing of adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria by denying them access to necessary and often lifesaving medical care. \n241.  The Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy is not substantially related to any important \ngovernment interest or rationally related to any legitimate government interest. \n242.  The  Hospital  Defendantsโ  SB  3  Policyโs  targeted  prohibition  on  medically \nnecessary care for transgender adolescents with gender dysphoria is based on generalized fears, \nnegative attitudes, stereotypes, and moral disapproval of transgender people that are not legitimate \nbases for unequal treatment under any level of scrutiny. \n243.  The Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy, on its face and as applied to the OU Health \nMinor Plaintiffs, deprives transgender adolescents of their right to equal protection of the laws and \nstigmatizes them as second-class citizens in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment.  The Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy also inflicts upon transgender \nadolescents, including the OU Health Minor Plaintiffs, distress, humiliation, embarrassment, \nemotional pain and anguish, violation of their dignity, and harms to their short- and long-term \nhealth and wellbeing from being denied access to medically necessary health care. \n244.  The Hospital Official Defendants are all governmental actors and/or employees \nacting under color of State law for purposes of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and the Fourteenth Amendment \nand liable for the violation of the OU Health Minor Plaintiffsโ rights to equal protection under 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1983.  \n55 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 56 of 64\n \n245.  The OU Health Minor Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaratory judgment that the \nHospital  Defendantsโ  SB  3  Policy  violates  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment.   \n246.  The OU Health Minor Plaintiffs also are entitled to permanent injunctive relief.   \nWithout injunctive relief, the OU Health Minor Plaintiffs will suffer and/or continue to suffer \nirreparable harm.  The OU Health Minor Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to redress the \nwrongs alleged. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFourteenth Amendment โ Due Process Right to Parental Autonomy (Health Care Ban) \nParent Plaintiffs Against State Official Defendants \n247.  Plaintiffs  reallege  and  incorporate  by  reference  paragraphs  1  to  200  of  this \nComplaint as though fully set forth herein. \n248.  By enforcing the Health Care Ban, the State Official Defendants are preventing \nparents from making medical care decisions concerning their children in violation of the Parent \nPlaintiffsโ Fourteenth Amendment Due Process right to parental autonomy. \n249.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, enforceable pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1983, protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, \ncustody, and control of their children.  \n250.  That fundamental right of parental autonomy includes the right of parents to seek \nand to follow medical advice to protect the health and wellbeing of their minor children. \n251.  Parentsโ fundamental right to seek and to follow medical advice is at its apex when \nthe parentsโ and childโs liberty interests in pursuing a course of medical care align, and the childโs \nmedical providers agree and have recommended as appropriate the course of medical treatment. \n56 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 57 of 64\n \n252.  The Health Care Banโs prohibition on providing evidence-based and medically \nnecessary  care  for  adolescents  with  gender  dysphoria  stands  directly  at  odds  with  parentsโ \nfundamental right to make decisions concerning the care of their children, particularly when it \naligns with the adolescentโs liberty interests.  The Health Care Ban barges into Oklahoma familiesโ \nliving rooms and strips Oklahoma parents, including the Parent Plaintiffs, of the right to seek, \ndirect, and provide medical care that their children need. \n253.  The Health Care Ban does nothing to protect the health or wellbeing of minors.  To \nthe contrary, it gravely threatens the health and wellbeing of adolescents with gender dysphoria by \ndenying their parents, including the Parent Plaintiffs, the ability to obtain necessary and often \nlifesaving medical care for their children. \n254.  The Health Care Banโs prohibition against the provision of medically accepted \ntreatments for adolescents with gender dysphoria is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling \ngovernment interest.  It also is not rationally related to any legitimate government interest. \n255.  The State Official Defendants are all governmental actors and/or employees acting \nunder color of State law for purposes of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and the Fourteenth Amendment and are \nliable for their violation of the Parent Plaintiffsโ rights to due process under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  \n256.  The Parent Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaratory judgment that the Health Care Ban \nviolates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n257.  The Parent Plaintiffs also are entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive \nrelief.  Without preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, the Parent Plaintiffs will suffer and/or \ncontinue to suffer irreparable harm.  The Parent Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to \nredress the wrongs alleged. \n57 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 58 of 64\n \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nSection 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 18116 (SB 3) \nOU Health Minor Plaintiffs and OU Health Parent Plaintiffs Against Hospital Defendants \n258.  Plaintiffs  reallege  and  incorporate  by  reference  paragraphs  1  to  [x]  of  this \nComplaint as though fully set forth herein. \n259.  By  enforcing  their  SB  3  Policy,  the  Hospital  Defendants  are  engaging  in \ndiscrimination against OU Health Minor Plaintiffs and OU Health Parent Plaintiffs on the basis of \nsex in violation of Section 1557 of the ACA, 42 U.S.C. ยง 18116. \n260.  Section 1557 provides in relevant part that โan individual shall not [on the basis of \nsex] be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder, any health program or activity, any part of which is receiving Federal financial assistance, \nincluding credits, subsidies, or contracts of insurance.โ \n261.  Discrimination on the basis of transgender status, gender, gender identity, gender \ndysphoria, gender transition, nonconformity with sex stereotypes, and sex characteristics all are \nforms of discrimination encompassed by the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex under \nSection 1557. \n262.  The  prohibition  on  sex  discrimination  in  Section  1557  of  the  ACA  protects \ntransgender individuals from discrimination by healthcare providers, including physicians and \nhospitals.  \n263.  The Hospital Defendants receive federal financial assistance and each is a โcovered \nentityโ for purposes of Section 1557 of the ACA.  For example, SB 3 authorized and appropriated \nmore than $108.5 million in federal funds to Defendant University Hospitals Authority.  The \nHospital Defendants also receive federal financial assistance through Medicaid payments and \nresearch grants from the National Institutes of Health, which operates within the U.S. Department \n58 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 59 of 64\n \nof  Health  and  Human  Services.    Defendant  OU  Health  publishes  a  Patient  Rights  & \nResponsibilities page on its website, stating that it โcompl[ies] with applicable Federal civil rights \nlaws and do[es] not discriminate on the basis of โฆ gender, โฆ gender identity or expression, โฆ \nmedical condition, โฆ or any other basis prohibited by federal, state, or local law.โ21 \n264.  Plaintiffs Peter Poe, Daphne Doe, and Lydia Loe obtained medical care for gender \ndysphoria at Oklahoma Childrenโs Hospital in Oklahoma City until the adoption of the Hospital \nDefendantsโ SB 3 Policy.  Plaintiff Brandon Boe obtained medical care for gender dysphoria at \nOU Health. \n265.  SB 3 and the Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy facially discriminate based on sex.  \nSB 3 prohibits the University Hospitals Authority from budgeting or expending any of the $39.4 \nmillion appropriated โfor the construction and equipping of facilities designed to expand the \ncapacity of behavioral health care for the childrenโ for the benefit of a facility providing โgender \nreassignment medical treatmentโ to any patient under 18, including โa. interventions to suppress \nthe  development  of  endogenous  secondary  sex  characteristics,  b.  interventions  to  align  the \npatientโs appearance or physical body with the patientโs gender identity, and c. medical therapies \nand medical intervention used to treat gender dysphoria.โ  \n266.  In response to SB 3, the Hospital Defendants decided to stop providing โgender-\naffirming servicesโ to patients under 18 to access the funds appropriated under SB 3. \n267.  The Hospital Defendants continue to provide the same services to non-transgender \nadolescents for other purposes. \n \n21 Patient Rights & Responsibilities, OU HEALTH, https://www.ouhealth.com/ou-health-patients-\nfamilies/patient-rights-responsibilities/. \n59 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 60 of 64\n \n268.  By adopting a policy pursuant to which they no longer provide โgender-affirming \nservicesโ to patients under 18, even though they provide the same โhormone-related prescription \ntherapies  and  surgical  proceduresโ  to  patients  under  18  for  other  conditions,  the  Hospital \nDefendants have discriminated against the OU Health Minor Plaintiffs and OU Health Parent \nPlaintiffs on the basis of sex.  Transgender patients cannot receive gender-affirming services but \npatients whose gender identity conforms with their sex assigned at birth can receive the same \nโhormone-related prescription therapies and surgical proceduresโ when medically necessary. \n269.  Because the Hospital Defendants are covered entities under Section 1557 of the \nACA, the OU Health Minor Plaintiffs and OU Health Parent Plaintiffs have a right under Section \n1557 to participate in the same programs and access the same benefits the Hospital Defendants \nprovide free from discrimination based on sex, transgender status, gender, gender identity, gender \ndysphoria, gender transition, nonconformity with sex stereotypes, and sex characteristics. \n270.  The Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy subjects the OU Health Minor Plaintiffs and \nOU Health Parent Plaintiffs to unlawful sex discrimination by preventing the OU Health Minor \nPlaintiffs from obtaining medically necessary care because of their sex and by requiring healthcare \nproviders to discriminate against the OU Health Minor Plaintiffs on the basis of sex.  As such, the \nHospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy conflicts with the nondiscrimination requirements of Section \n1557.  It also conflicts with and undermines the purposes and goals of Section 1557. \n271.  The Medical Provider Plaintiff also is a recipient of federal financial assistance and \ntherefore subject to Section 1557โs nondiscrimination mandate. \n272.  It is impossible for the Medical Provider Plaintiff to continue to comply with her \nobligations under Section 1557 and also comply with the restrictions imposed by the Hospital \nDefendantsโ SB 3 Policy. \n60 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 61 of 64\n \n273.  SB 3 and the Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy in response stand as an obstacle to \nthe accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress, including the \nobjective of preventing discrimination based on sex in the provision of health care. \n274.  As a result of SB 3 and the Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy, the OU Health Minor \nPlaintiffs are being denied access to medically necessary health care on the basis of sex.  They \nhave suffered harm, such as distress, humiliation, embarrassment, emotional pain and anguish, \nviolation of their dignity, and harms to their short- and long-term health and wellbeing from being \ndenied access to medically necessary health care. \n275.  As a result of SB 3 and the SB 3 Policy, the OU Health Parent Plaintiffs have \nincurred or will incur costs to change providers or costs for travel out of state for access to \ntreatments.   \n276.  Accordingly, the OU Health Minor Plaintiffs and OU Health Parent Plaintiffs are \nentitled to declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as nominal damages.  They have no adequate \nremedy at law to redress the wrongs alleged, which are of a continuing nature and will cause them \nirreparable harm. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Court: \nA.  Enter a declaratory judgment declaring that: \ni.   the Health Care Ban, on its face and as applied to Plaintiffs, violates the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating \nagainst  (1)  the  Minor  Plaintiffs,  the  patients  of  the  Medical  Provider \nPlaintiff, and all similarly situated individuals on the basis of sex and \ntransgender status, and (2) the Parent Plaintiffs with regards to (a) their \nexercise of the right to parental autonomy and (b) their ability to secure \n61 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 2 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/02/23   Page 62 of 64\n \nnecessary medical care for their children that other parents can obtain based \non sex and transgender status, and is therefore unenforceable;  \nii.  the Health Care Ban, on its face and as applied to the Parent Plaintiffs, \nviolates the Parent Plaintiffsโ right to parental autonomy guaranteed by the \nDue Process Clause and is therefore unenforceable;  \niii.  the Hospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy, on its face and as applied to the OU \nHealth  Minor  Plaintiffs,  violates  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the \nFourteenth Amendment by discriminating against the OU Health Minor \nPlaintiffs and all similarly situated individuals on the basis of sex and \ntransgender status and is therefore unenforceable;  \niv.  the  Hospital  Defendantsโ  SB  3  Policy  violates  Section  1557  of  the \nAffordable  Care  Act  by  discriminating  against  the  OU  Health  Minor \nPlaintiffs and all similarly situated individuals on the basis of sex and is \ntherefore unenforceable; and \nB.  Issue preliminary and permanent injunctions enjoining: \ni.   The State Official Defendants, their employees, agents, successors, and all \nothers acting in concert with them, from administering or enforcing the \nHealth Care Ban; and \nii.  The Hospital Official Defendants, their employees, agents, successors, and \nall others acting in concert with them, from administering or enforcing the \nHospital Defendantsโ SB 3 Policy. \nC.

Case No. 23-CV-177-JFH-SH \n \nGENTNER DRUMMOND, et al.,   \n \nDefendants. \n \nOPINION AND ORDER \nBefore the Court is a motion for preliminary injunction (โMotionโ) filed by Plaintiffs \nBenjamin, Bethany, and Brandon Boe; Donna and Daphne Doe; Lauren and Lydia Loe; Paula, \nPatrick, and Peter Poe; Rachel, Richard, and Ryan Roe, and Shauna Lawlis (โPlaintiffsโ).  Dkt. \nNo. 5.  Defendants oppose the Motion.1  For the reasons stated herein, the Motion is DENIED. \nBACKGROUND \nOn September 29, 2022, the Oklahoma State Legislature enacted Senate Bill 3 (โSB 3โ), \nconditionally  appropriating  $39.4  million  to  the  University  Hospitals  Authority  โfor  the \nconstruction and equipping of facilities designed to expand the capacity of behavioral health careโ \nfor pediatric patients.  S.B. 3, 58th Leg., 2nd Ex. Sess. (Okla. 2022).  The appropriation was subject \nto the condition that the University Hospitals Authority not budget or expend any appropriated \nfunds for the benefit of any facility performing โgender reassignment medical treatmentโ on \npatients under the age of 18.  Id.  In October 2022, OU Medicine issued a statement indicating that \n \n1  In responding to the complaint and preliminary injunction motion, Defendants have separated \nthemselves into two subgroups:  (1) OU Medicine, Inc. (โOU Medicineโ) and Dr. Richard Lofgren \nin his official capacity as President and Chief Executive Officer of OU Health (โDr. Lofgrenโ) \n(collectively the โOU Defendantsโ); and (2) the remaining defendants (collectively the โState \nDefendantsโ).  Each subgroup filed a separate response to the Motion.  Dkt. No. 85; Dkt. No. 86. \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 2 of 36\nit had โceased hormone-related prescription therapies and surgical procedures for gender affirming \nservices on patients under the age of 18โ because of SB 3 (the โSB 3 Policyโ).  Dkt. No. 2 at 26.2 \nOn May 1, 2023, the Oklahoma State Legislature enacted Senate Bill 613 (โSB 613โ or the \nโActโ), codifying that a healthcare provider โshall not knowingly provide gender transition \nprocedures to any child.โ  63 O.S. ยง 2607.1(B).  SB 613 defined โgender transition proceduresโ as \nโmedical or surgical services performed for the purpose of attempting to affirm the minorโs \nperception of his or her gender or biological sex, if that perception is inconsistent with the minorโs \nbiological sex,โ including โsurgical procedures that alter or  remove physical or  anatomical \ncharacteristics or features that are typical for the individualโs biological sexโ and โpuberty-\nblocking drugs, cross-sex hormones, or other drugs to suppress or delay normal puberty or to \npromote the development of feminizing or masculinizing features consistent with the opposite \nbiological sex.โ  Id. at ยง 2607.1(A)(2)(a).3  Under SB 613, a minor receiving puberty-blocking \ndrugs (โpuberty blockersโ) or cross-sex hormones at the time of the lawโs enactment may continue \nreceiving such drugs or hormones for a period of six (6) months for the sole purpose of โgradually \ndecreasing and discontinuingโ their use.  Id. at ยง 2607.1(A)(2)(b)(7).  Healthcare providers who \nadminister Treatment Protocols to minors in violation of SB 613 may face adverse proceedings by \ntheir professional licensing boards and may be subject to criminal and civil penalties.  Id. at ยง \n2607.1(D)-(F). \nOn May 2, 2023, Plaintiffsโfive transgender youth who are receiving Treatment Protocols \n(โMinor Plaintiffsโ),4 their parents and legal guardians (โParent Plaintiffsโ), and one healthcare \n \n2  All record citations use ECF pagination. \n3  Referred to collectively as the โTreatment Protocols.โ \n4  Brandon Boe is taking cross-sex hormones.

Lydia Loe is taking cross-sex hormones.  \n2 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 3 of 36\nprovider (โProvider Plaintiffโ)โfiled a complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  Dkt. \nNo. 2.  Plaintiffs allege that SB 613 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment because it discriminates based on sex and transgender status.  Id. at 48-53.  Parent \nPlaintiffs also allege that SB 613 violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \nbecause it limits their fundamental right to seek and follow medical advice for their children.  Id. \nat 56-57. \nFour of the five Minor Plaintiffs received Treatment Protocols through OU Medicine \nbefore the enactment of SB 3.  These Plaintiffs (โOU Minor Plaintiffsโ) and their parents and \nguardians (collectively, โOU Plaintiffsโ) also challenge the SB 3 Policy.  Id. at 53-56, 58-61.  OU \nMinor Plaintiffs allege that, like SB 613, the SB 3 Policy violates the Equal Protection Clause \nbecause it discriminates against them based on sex and transgender status.  Id. at 53-56.  OU \nPlaintiffs collectively allege that the SB 3 Policy violates the nondiscrimination provision of the \nAffordable Care Act (โACAโ).  Id. at 58-61; see 42 U.S.C. ยง 18116.5 \nIn the instant Motion, Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the enforcement of SB 613 on the equal \nprotection and due process grounds set forth in their complaint.  Dkt. No. 6. \n \nDkt. No. 6-11 at 4.  Peter Poe is taking puberty blockers.  Dkt. No. 6-5 at 3.  Ryan Roe is taking \npuberty blockers.  Dkt. No. 6-14 at 4. \n5  Although the heading for Plaintiffsโ fourth claim indicates that it is brought by OU Plaintiffs \n[Dkt. No. 2 at 58], the complaint includes additional allegations pertaining to Provider Plaintiff \n[Id. at 60].  Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that:  (1) Provider Plaintiff is โa recipient of federal \nfinancial assistance and therefore subject to [the ACAโs] nondiscrimination mandateโ; and (2) โ[i]t \nis impossible for the [Provider] Plaintiff to continue to comply with her obligations under [the \nACA] and also comply with the restrictions imposed by [the] SB 3 Policy.โ  Id.  Due to the \ninconsistency, it is not clear whether Provider Plaintiff is also asserting a claim under the ACA. \n3 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 4 of 36\nAUTHORITY AND ANALYSIS \nI.  Jurisdiction \nA federal court may issue injunctive relief if it has subject matter jurisdiction over the claim \nand personal jurisdiction over the parties.  See Sinochem Int'l Co. v. Malaysia Int'l Shipping Corp., \n549 U.S. 422, 430-31 (2007); Thomas v. Bolls, No. 18-CV-00692-GPG, 2018 WL 9489245, at *2 \n(D. Colo. May 16, 2018) (citing Zepeda v. U.S. I.N.S., 753 F.2d 719, 727 (9th Cir. 1983)).  \nA.  Subject Matter Jurisdiction \nFederal  courts  possess  subject  matter  jurisdiction  for  all  claims  โarising  under  the \nConstitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.โ  28 U.S.C. ยง 1331.  โA case arises under federal \nlaw if its well-pleaded complaint establishes either that federal law creates the cause of action or \nthat the plaintiffโs right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of \nfederal law.โ  Morris v. City of Hobart, 39 F.3d 1105, 1111 (10th Cir. 1994) (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted).  Here, Plaintiffsโ claims under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for alleged violations \nof the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution [Dkt. No. 2 at 48-57] and under \nSection 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 18116 [id. at 58-61] satisfy the conditions \nnecessary for jurisdiction under ยง 1331. \nB.  Personal Jurisdiction \nโTo exercise jurisdiction in harmony with due process, defendants must have minimum \ncontacts with the forum state, such that having to defend a lawsuit there would not offend \ntraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.โ  Shrader v. Biddinger, 633 F.3d 1235, 1239 \n(10th Cir. 2011) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Dudnikov v. Chalk & \nVermilion Fine Arts, Inc., 514 F.3d 1063, 1070 (10th Cir. 2008)).  Plaintiffs state that a substantial \npart of the events giving rise to their claims occurred in this district.  Dkt. No. 2 at 9.  Plaintiffs \n4 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 5 of 36\nalso state that Defendants have ties to Oklahoma through their status as members of three groups:  \nstate officials or agencies in Oklahoma; officers, board members, or trustees of those state agencies \nsued in their official capacity; and officers or board members of several Oklahoma state medical \nlicensing boards.  Id. at 11-16.  This is sufficient for a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction.  \nII.  Standing \nโArticle  III  of  the  Constitution  permits  federal  courts  to  decide  only  โCasesโ  or \nโControversies.โ  To establish a case or controversy, a plaintiff must possess standing to sue.โ  \nLaufer v. Looper, 22 F.4th 871, 876 (10th Cir. 2022) (internal citations and quotation marks \nomitted).  โ[T]o demonstrate standing, a plaintiff must show:  (1) that he or she has suffered an \ninjury in fact; (2) that the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and \n(3) that it is likely that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.โ  United States v. Sup. \nCt. of N.M., 839 F.3d 888, 898 (10th Cir. 2016) (citations and quotation marks omitted).  โThe \ninjury alleged must be concrete and particularized, and the threat of that injury must be actual and \nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.โ  Petrella v. Brownback, 697 F.3d 1285, 1293 (10th \nCir. 2012) (citations and quotation marks omitted).  Here, Plaintiffsโ alleged injury in fact is their \nactual and imminent loss of access to the Treatment Protocols, and the risk of disciplinary action \nto Provider Plaintiff by her licensing board or the courts.  These imminent threats are fairly \ntraceable  to  SB  613  and  would  be  redressed  by  a  decision  in  Plaintiffsโ  favor  on  the \nconstitutionality of SB 613.  Plaintiffs have made a prima facie showing of standing to assert a \nfacial challenge to SB 613. \nIII.  Plaintiffsโ Preliminary Injunction Burden \nA preliminary injunction is โan extraordinary remedy, the exception rather than the rule.โ  \nMrs. Fields Franchising, LLC v. MFGPC, 941 F.3d 1221, 1232 (10th Cir. 2019) (citation and \n5 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 6 of 36\nquotation marks omitted).  See also Winter v. NRDC, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008) (โA preliminary \ninjunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.โ).  A court may only grant \npreliminary injunctive relief, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65, if plaintiffs meet \ntheir burden to demonstrate that:  (1) they are substantially likely to succeed on the merits; (2) they \nwill suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is denied; (3) their threatened injury outweighs the \ninjury the opposing party will suffer under the injunction; and (4) the injunction would not be \nadverse to the public interest.  DTC Energy Grp., Inc. v. Hirschfeld, 912 F.3d 1263, 1270 (10th \nCir. 2018).6  However, the likelihood-of-success inquiry is often dispositive in the case of a \nconstitutional challenge. \nAt the outset, it must be observed that, โevery time a court recognizes an asserted right as \na fundamental right protected by the Constitution, the court, โto a great extent, place[s] the matter \noutside the arena of public debate and legislative action.โโ  Eknes-Tucker v. Governor of Ala., 80 \nF.4th 1205, 1220 (11th Cir. 2023) (alteration in original) (quoting Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 \nU.S. 702, 720 (1997)).  For this reason, โthe Supreme Court has instructed courts addressing \nsubstantive due process claims to โengage[] in a careful analysis of the history of the right at issueโ \nand โbe โreluctantโ to recognize rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution.โโ  Id. (quoting \nDobbs v. Jackson Womenโs Health Org., 142 S.Ct. 2228, 2246-47 (2022)).  This highlights an \ninitial obstacle to Plaintiffsโ requested relief.  That is, Plaintiffs do not argue that the original fixed \nmeaning of either the due process guarantee or the equal protection guarantee covers their claims.  \nWhen faced with a similar challenge to bans on procedures for minors in Kentucky and Tennessee, \n \n6  Although this case involves challenges to both SB 613 and the SB 3 Policy, Plaintiffs only seek \nto enjoin the enforcement of SB 613.  Dkt. No. 2 at 48-61; Dkt. No. 5 at 1; Dkt. No. 6 at 31.  \nTherefore, the Court will consider the factors set forth above as they pertain to Plaintiffsโ SB 613 \nclaims only. \n6 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 7 of 36\nthe Sixth Circuit noted the plaintiffsโ lack of historical analysis of these constitutional guarantees \nand discerned: \nThat prompts the question whether the people of this country ever agreed to remove \ndebates  of  this  sortโover  the  use  of  innovative,  and  potentially  irreversible, \nmedical treatments for childrenโfrom the conventional place for dealing with new \nnorms, new drugs, and new public health concerns:  the democratic process.  Life-\ntenured federal judges should be wary of removing a vexing and novel topic of \nmedical debate from the ebbs and flows of democracy by construing a largely \nunamendable Constitution to occupy the field. \nL.W., by and through Williams v. Skrmetti, --- F.4th ---, 2023 WL 6321688, at *5 (6th Cir. Sept. \n28, 2023). \nPlaintiffs face another challenge in that they seek to extend constitutional guarantees into \nnew territory.  The Skrmetti court addressed this as well: \nThere is nothing wrong with that, to be certain.  But this reality does suggest that \nthe key premise of a preliminary injunctionโa showing of a likelihood of success \non the meritsโis missing.  Constitutionalizing new areas of American life is not \nsomething federal courts should do lightly, particularly when โthe States are \ncurrently engaged in serious, thoughtfulโ debates about the issue. \nId. at *6 (quoting Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 719). \nThese two concerns highlighted in Skrmetti are also present here.  Plaintiffsโ burden to \nestablish that the purported rights at issue fall within the original fixed meaning of constitutional \nguaranteesโor are of the kind that support newly recognized constitutional guarantees (despite \nongoing, vigorous public debate)โis a heavy one.  Understanding the significant nature of this \nburden, the Court now turns to the alleged rights Plaintiffs claim are violated by SB 613. \nIV.  Plaintiffsโ Equal Protection Claim \nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that โno State shall \ndeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.โ  U.S. CONST. amend. \nXIV, ยง 1.  This clause โseeks to ensure that any classifications the law makes are made without \nrespect to persons, that like cases are treated alike, [and] that those who appear similarly situated \n7 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 8 of 36\nare not treated differently without, at the very least, a rational reason for the difference.โ  SECSYS, \nLLC v. Vigil, 666 F.3d 678, 684 (10th Cir. 2012) (citation and quotation marks omitted). \nTo establish a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, a plaintiff must first show that the \nstate engaged in intentional discrimination in a manner that harmed the plaintiff.  Ashaheed v. \nCurrington, 7 F.4th 1236, 1250 (10th Cir. 2021) (recognizing that a party who asserts an equal \nprotection violation โhas the burden of proving the existence of purposeful discrimination causing \nan adverse effectโ (citation and quotation marks omitted)).  Intent can be established by either:  (1) \ndirect proof of a distinction between groups that is evident from the face of the law or other state \naction; or (2) circumstantial evidence that, despite being facially neutral, the state action was taken \nwith the purpose of discriminating against a particular group.  See id. (recognizing that intentional \ndiscrimination can be established through circumstantial evidence that โthe plaintiff was treated \ndifferently from similarly situated persons who are alike in all relevant respectsโ) (citations and \nquotation marks omitted); SECSYS, 666 F.3d at 686 (detailing โseveral formsโ of intentional \ndiscrimination  that,  if  established,  require  an  inquiry  into  whether  the  stateโs  intentional \nclassification is permissible). \nOnce a plaintiff demonstrates he or she was adversely affected by the stateโs intentional \ndiscrimination, the Court turns to the question of โwhether the stateโs intentional decision to \ndiscriminate can be justified by reference to some upright government purpose.โ  SECSYS, 666 \nF.3d at 686.  The Equal Protection Clause does not prohibit a state from making any distinctions \nbetween people; instead, it requires that, to the extent meaningful distinctions are made between \ngroups of individuals, it can nevertheless be said that the state action โtreat[s] similarly situated \npersons similarly.โ  Id. (citing City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432, 439-40 \n8 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 9 of 36\n(1985)) (recognizing that the Equal Protection Clause โis essentially a direction that all persons \nsimilarly situated should be treated alikeโ). \nThe question of whether a stateโs classification is justified by reference to an upright \npurpose depends upon the classification at issue.  If the government action concerns fundamental \nrights or distinguishes between individuals based upon a suspect classificationโsuch as race or \nnational originโthe state action will be subject to strict scrutiny and will be upheld only if it is \nโnarrowly tailored to further a compelling government interest.โ  Save Palisade FruitLands v. \nTodd, 279 F.3d 1204, 1210 (10th Cir. 2002) (citing Goetz v. Glickman, 149 F.3d 1131, 1140 (10th \nCir. 1998)).  State action that distinguishes among groups based on โquasi-suspectโ classifications, \nsuch as sex, are subject to an intermediate standard of review and will be upheld so long as the \ndiscriminatory means serves โimportant governmental objectivesโ and is โsubstantially related to \nthe achievement of those objectives.โ  United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 516 (1996) (citation \nand quotation marks omitted).  Where the state action does not implicate a fundamental right or \ndraw a distinction based upon a suspect class, rational basis scrutiny applies, and the Courtโs \ninquiry will be directed to whether the classification is rationally related to a legitimate purpose.  \nSee Price-Cornelison v. Brooks, 524 F.3d 1103, 1110 (10th Cir. 2008).  Given the different \nstandards of scrutiny that apply to the different types of distinctions that a legislature may draw, \nthe Court must take care to accurately identify the distinction that the Oklahoma Legislature made \nin SB 613.7 \n \n7  In a sense, there is a level of overlap between Plaintiffsโ due process and equal protection claims.  \nโ[I]f a classification impinge[s] upon the exercise of a fundamental right, the Equal Protection \nClause requires the State to demonstrate that its classification has been precisely tailored to serve \na compelling governmental interest.โ  Kitchen v. Herbert, 755 F.3d 1193, 1218 (10th Cir. 2014) \n(citation and quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original); see Fowler v. Stitt, No. 22-CV-115-\nJWB-SH, 2023 WL 4010694, at *18 (N.D. Okla. June 8, 2023). \n9 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 10 of 36\nThe Court concludes that SB 613 restricts particular medical procedures for individuals \nunder a particular age.  The evidence is apparent from the face of the Act itself, which is not a \nwholesale prohibition on gender affirming care for transgender individuals but is instead a \nlegislative determination that only adults may have access to gender affirming care through the \nTreatment Protocols. \nA.  Age Classification \nSB  613  does  not  prevent  any  adultโmale  or  femaleโfrom  undergoing  Treatment \nProtocols in connection with gender affirming care; it only prevents minors from doing so.  See \nEknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1227 (agreeing that Alabamaโs similar act โis best understood as a law \nthat targets specific medical interventions for minors, not one that classifies on the basis of any \nsuspect characteristic under the Equal Protection Clauseโ).  Facially, the distinction made is \nbetween adults who are ready to make life-altering decisions and minors who, at least in the eyes \nof the legislature, are not.  This is precisely the type of age-based legislative decision that courts \nhave long accepted as being subject to rational basis review.  See Hedgepeth ex rel. Hedgepeth v. \nWash.  Metro.  Area  Transit  Auth.,  386  F.3d  1148,  1155  (D.C.  Cir.  2004)  (concluding  that \nโclassifications based on youthโlike those based on age in generalโdo not trigger heightened \nscrutiny for equal protection purposesโ); Bykofsky v. Borough of Middletown, 401 F. Supp. 1242, \n1266 (M.D. Pa. 1975) (recognizing that โyouths under the age of eighteen have traditionally been \nregulated and restricted by American law in many ways,โ including through limitations on their \nability to enter into contracts, purchase certain goods, work at certain jobs, and be held liable for \ncriminal behavior), aff'd, 535 F.2d 1245 (3d Cir. 1976). \n10 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 11 of 36\nB.  Sex Classification \nThe Court rejects Plaintiffsโ argument that the Act is discriminatory on its face because it \nmakes distinctions in โexplicit gendered terms.โ  Dkt. No. 6 at 18-19.  True, SB 613 uses terms \nsuch as โsexโ and โgenderโ to discuss the Treatment Protocols, but the use of those terms is due to \nthe fact the Act itself concerns โmedical or surgical services performed for the purpose of \nattempting to affirm [a] minorโs perception of his or her gender or biological sex . . . .โ   63 O.S. ยง \n2607.1(A)(2).  The use of these โgendered termsโ reflects the nature of the procedure being \nregulated, not an intention to discriminate between people of different sexes.  See Eknes-Tucker, \n80 F.4th at 1228 (rejecting argument that a similar statutory classification was sex-based where \nโthe statute refer[red] to sex only because the medical procedures that it regulatesโpuberty \nblockers and cross-sex hormones as a treatment for gender dysphoriaโare themselves sex-\nbasedโ).  Indeed, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the legislature to regulate this area \nwithout using the challenged terms.  See Skrmetti, 2023 WL 6321688, at *14 (rejecting the \nargument that the use of the word โsexโ in Kentucky and Tennessee statutes banning medical \nprocedures  similar  to  the  Treatment  Protocols  for  minors  constituted  sex  discrimination, \nexplaining, โThe Acts mention the word โsex,โ true.  But how could they not?  The point of the \nhormones is to help a minor transition from one gender to another, and laws banning, permitting, \nor otherwise regulating them all face the same linguistic destiny of describing the biology of the \nprocedures.โ). \nRather than applying a litmus test in which the presence of the word โsexโ or โgenderโ \nnecessitates intermediate scrutiny, the Court must look to the language of the statute and examine \nwhether SB 613 uses gendered terms to distinguish between groups of people.  The Court finds \nthat it does not.  Where the Act uses gendered terms, it does so to identify the procedures at issue.  \n11 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 12 of 36\nAs noted, SB 613 uses the terms โgenderโ and โsexโ when articulating the โgender transition \nproceduresโ that are prohibited for minors.  See 63 O.S. ยง 2607.1(A)(2)(a).  It likewise provides \nspecific examples of the procedures that individuals cannot undergo before reaching the age of \nmajority, including โsurgical procedures that alter or remove physical or anatomical characteristics \nor features that are typical for the individualโs biological sexโ and drugs that โpromote the \ndevelopment of feminizing or masculinizing features consistent with the opposite biological sex.โ  \nId. \nThe Act does not use sex as a means to distinguish between groupsโtreatments allowed \nby SB 613 are allowed for all minors, regardless of sex.  Id. at ยง 2607.1(A)(2)(b).  Similarly, all \nminors, regardless of sex, are prohibited from undergoing certain procedures for the purpose of \ngender transition before reaching the age of majority.  63 O.S. ยง 2607.1(B) (โA health care provider \nshall not knowingly provide gender transition procedures to any child.โ); id. at ยง 2607.1(A)(1) \n(defining a โchildโ as โany person under the age of eighteen (18) years of ageโ) (emphasis added).  \nSo far, they are equal.  See Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1228 (holding that the challenged statute did \nโnot establish an unequal regime for males and femalesโ where the law restricted certain treatments \nfor treating gender discordance โfor all minorsโ). \nPlaintiffs argue that, notwithstanding the facially neutral application, SB 613 has the effect \nof discriminating based on sex because it โenforces sex stereotypes and gender conformity.โ  Dkt. \nNo. 6 at 19-20.  They point to Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, 140 S.Ct. 1731 (2020), where \nthe Supreme Court held that an employer violates Title VII when it takes an adverse employment \naction against an individual because that person is transgender.  Accord Tudor v. Se. Okla. State \nUniv., 13 F.4th 1019, 1028 (10th Cir. 2021) (recognizing that โtransgender discrimination . . . is \n12 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 13 of 36\ndiscrimination โbecause of sexโ prohibited under Title VIIโ).  According to Plaintiffs, the reasoning \nof Bostock equally applies to equal protection claims. \nAt one point, it could have appeared that one circuit might agree with Plaintiffsโ argument.  \nSee Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1317 (11th Cir. 2011) (recognizing that discrimination \nagainst  a  transgender  individual  because  of  his  or  her  gender  non-conformity  is  gender \nstereotyping prohibited by Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause).  However, the Eleventh \nCircuit recently removed any belief that could be so.  See Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1228-29 \n(rejecting application of Bostock and Brumby in upholding Alabamaโs similar ban on gender \naffirming procedures for minors, explaining that neither of those cases dealt with the Equal \nProtection Clause as applied to laws regulating medical treatments).  More importantly, the Tenth \nCircuit has not accepted Plaintiffsโ theory about the application of Bostock here. \nAbsent binding precedent to the contrary, this Court will not extend the reasoning of \nBostockโa Title VII case concerning an adverse employment actionโto this case, which concerns \na materially different governing law, materially different language, and materially different facts.  \nSee id. at 1229 (concluding that because Bostock โconcerned a different law (with materially \ndifferent language) and a different factual context,โ that decision bore โminimal relevanceโ to the \nquestion of whether the statutory prohibition against certain gender transition procedures violated \nthe Equal Protection Clause).  See also Skrmetti, 2023 WL 6321688, at *16-17 (contrasting the \nfacts in Bostock, where adult employees were โfired . . . because their behavior did not match \nstereotypes of how adult men or women dress or behave,โ with the laws at issue, which โdo not \ndeny anyone general healthcare treatment based on any such stereotypes[, but] merely deny the \nsame medical treatments to all children facing gender dysphoria if they are 17 or underโ); Students \nfor Fair Admissions v. Harvard Coll., 600 U.S. 181, 308 (2023) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) \n13 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 14 of 36\n(comparing the text of Title VII with the Equal Protection Clause and concluding that the \nsuggestion that โsuch differently worded provisions should mean the same thing is implausible on \nits faceโ). \nEven if this Court were to hold that classifications based upon โgender conformityโ (or \nlack thereof) constitute sex-based classifications under the Equal Protection Clause, this would not \nadvance Plaintiffsโ claims.  This is not a case where a state action is being taken to further a \nparticular gender stereotype or prohibit conduct that contravenes that stereotype.  See Eknes-\nTucker, 80 F.4th at 1229 (concluding that rational basis scrutiny applied to a law targeting certain \nmedical interventions associated with gender dysphoria, as that law did not โfurther any particular \ngender stereotypeโ); Skrmetti, 2023 WL 6321688, at *18 (โRecognizing and respecting biological \nsex differences does not amount to stereotyping . . . .โ)  Instead, this is a case where the Oklahoma \nLegislature has prohibited all minors from using certain medical procedures to treat gender \ndysphoria.  The law does not further gender stereotypes by taking adverse actions against those \nwho fail to conform to them; it simply requires that adolescents reach the age of majority before \nundergoing certain medical interventions to treat the psychological condition of gender dysphoria. \nC.  Transgender Status Classification \nPlaintiffs take the position that, even if SB 613 does not distinguish on the basis of gender \n(or conformance with gender norms), the statute is nevertheless subject to heightened scrutiny \nbecause it treats transgender individuals differently than other individuals.  The Court disagrees.  \nFirst, the Supreme Court has not recognized transgender status as a suspect class.8  In addition, the \n \n8  โThe bar for recognizing a new suspect class is a high one.  The Supreme Court โhas not \nrecognized any new constitutionally protected classes in over four decades, and instead has \nrepeatedly declined to do so.โโ  Skrmetti, 2023 WL 6321688, at *18 (quoting Ondo v. City of \nCleveland, 795 F.3d 597, 609 (6th Cir. 2015)). \n14 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 15 of 36\nTenth Circuit โhas not held that a transsexual plaintiff is a member of a protected suspect class for \npurposes of Equal Protection claims,โ and has analyzed such claims under the rational basis \nstandard.  Druley v. Patton, 601 F. Appโx 632, 635 (10th Cir. 2015).9  See also Skrmetti, 2023 WL \n6321688, at *18-19 (discussing the considerations the Supreme Court has highlighted when \nrecognizing a new suspect class and explaining why transgender status is not likely to qualify \nunder  such  considerations).    Furthermore,  even  if  heightened  scrutiny  were  to  apply  to \nclassifications based on transgender status, the Court would not find that SB 613 makes such a \nclassification. \nThe Court is not persuaded by Plaintiffsโ argument that SB 613 is part of a โlarger \nlegislative strategy to discriminate against transgender people, including by restricting access to \ngender-affirming care for people of all agesโ [Dkt. No. 6 at 21-22 & n.3] for three reasons.  First, \nalthough Plaintiffs suggest that 15 bills were introduced as part of a legislature-wide strategy to \ndiscriminate against transgender people, they cite only two:  HB 1011 and SB 345.  Id.  Neither of \nthese  bills  received  a  floor  vote,10  which  undercuts  Plaintiffsโ  claims;  if  these  bills  were \ncomponents of an overarching discriminatory strategy, it seems unlikely that they would have died \nin committee.  Second, Plaintiffs provide no evidence for their claim that SB 613 was one of 15 \nsimilar bills.  The Court declines to further inquire into Oklahomaโs legislative records concerning \nthe nature and purpose of these purported bills when Plaintiffs apparently did not believe the \nendeavor to be worth their own time.  It would seem likely, however, that had any bills made more \n \n9  Unpublished appellate decisions are not precedential but may be cited for their persuasive value.  \nSee 10th Cir. R. 32.1; Fed. R. App. P. 32.1. \n10  See http://www.oklegislature.gov/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=hb1011&Session=2300 and http://www.\noklegislature.gov/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=sb345&Session=2300.  The Court takes judicial notice of \nthese governmental records.  See High Desert Relief, Inc. v. United States, 917 F.3d 1170, 1175 \nn.1 (10th Cir. 2019). \n15 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 16 of 36\nprogress than HB 1011 or SB 345, Plaintiffs would have cited them.  Third, one of the bills \nreferenced by Plaintiffs, HB 1011, sought to ban Treatment Protocols for anyone under the age of \n21, rather than under the age of 18.  The legislatureโs decision to enact SB 613, with its lower age \nrestriction, undermines Plaintiffsโ argument that the legislature was operating with the goal of \ninvidious  discrimination  against  all  transgender  individuals.    Plaintiffsโ  theory  is  simply \ninsufficient to establish a likelihood that they will prove that SB 613 was part of an impermissible \nscheme to discriminate against transgender people. \nThe Court likewise rejects Plaintiffsโ claim that SB 613 discriminates against transgender \nindividuals because it โsingles out medical care that only transgender people need or seek.โ  Dkt. \nNo. 6 at 18.  Although the statute does restrict a specific course of treatment that only transgender \nindividuals would normally request, that fact alone does not render the statute invalid.  As the \nSupreme Court recently recognized when addressing whether a stateโs regulation of abortion was \na sex-based classification, the โregulation of a medical procedure that only one sex can undergo \ndoes not trigger heightened constitutional scrutiny unless the regulation is a โmere pretex[t] \ndesigned to effect an invidious discrimination against members of one sex or the other.โโ  Dobbs, \n142 S.Ct. at 2245-46 (alteration in original) (quoting Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484, 496 n.20 \n(1974)).  Just as the โgoal of preventing abortion does not constitute invidiously discriminatory \nanimus against women,โ id. at 2246, the goal of prohibiting minors from accessing a course of \ntreatment that โonly transgender people need or seekโ [Dkt. No. 6 at 18] does not itself constitute \ndiscriminatory animus against transgender people.  Where, as here, there is no evidence of pretext \nfor discrimination, SB 613โs classification scheme does not trigger a heightened standard of \nreview.  See Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1230 (holding that, because there was no evidence that the \nregulation was pretext for discrimination against transgender individuals, the banโs โrelationship \n16 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 17 of 36\nto transgender status [did] not warrant heightened scrutinyโ).  Accordingly, the legislatureโs \nclassification scheme will be upheld so long as it survives rational basis review.  See Section VI, \ninfra. \nV.  Parent Plaintiffsโ Substantive Due Process Claim \nThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that no state shall โdeprive \nany person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.โ  U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, ยง \n1.  Two  types of substantive rights have been recognized within the  Due Process Clause:  \nenumerated rights, set out in the first eight Amendments, and implied rights, โa select list of \nfundamental rights that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution.โ  Dobbs, 152 S.Ct. at \n2246.  This case involves implied rights.  See Fowler v. Stitt, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2023 WL 4010694, \nat *8 (N.D. Okla. June 8, 2023) (โThe Constitution makes no express reference to . . . oneโs gender, \nnor does it reference a right to be treated consistent with oneโs gender identity.  Thus, Plaintiffs \nmust show that the right is somehow implicit in the constitutional text . . . .โ), appeal docketed, \nNo. 23-5080 (10th Cir. July 7, 2023). \nAn implied rights substantive due process analysis generally requires two steps.  The Court \nmust first โcarefully describe the asserted fundamental liberty interest,โ then โdecide whether the \nasserted liberty interest, once described, is objectively, deeply rooted in this Nationโs history and \ntradition, and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, such that neither liberty nor justice would \nexist if they were sacrificed.โ  Seegmiller v. LaVerkin City, 528 F.3d 762, 769 (10th Cir. 2008) \n(citation and quotation marks omitted).11 \n \n11  A second test, referred to as the โshocks the conscienceโ test, is sometimes appropriate for a \nsubstantive due process case (usually, though not exclusively, in cases involving challenged \nactions by the executive branch of government).  Seegmiller, 528 F.3d at 767.  โConduct that \nshocks  the  judicial  conscience  .  .  .  is  deliberate  government  action  that  is  โarbitraryโ  and \nโunrestrained by the established principles of private right and distributive justice.โโ  Id.

Description of the Interest \nโThat many of the rights and liberties protected by the Due Process Clause sound in \npersonal autonomy does not warrant the sweeping conclusion that any and all important, intimate, \nand personal decisions are so protected . . . .โ  Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 727 (1997) (first citing \nPlanned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 852 (1992); and then citing San Antonio \nIndep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 33-35 (1973)).  โAs a general matter, the Court has \nalways been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process because guideposts for \nresponsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and open-ended.โ  Collins v. City \nof Harker Heights, Tex., 503 U.S. 115, 125 (1992) (citing Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474 \nU.S. 214, 225-26 (1985)).  The Supreme Court emphasized the need for precise framing in \nGlucksberg, explaining: \nBy extending constitutional protection to an asserted right or liberty interest, we, to \na great extent, place the matter outside the arena of public debate and legislative \naction.  We must therefore exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break \nnew ground in this field, lest the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause be \nsubtly transformed into the policy preferences of the [judiciary]. \n521 U.S. at 720 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).  Rights framed as โ[v]ague \ngeneralities . . . will not suffice.โ  Chavez v. Martinez, 538 U.S. 760, 776 (2003). \nGlucksberg demonstrated the type of the precise framing required.  In that case, terminally \nill patients and treating physicians who challenged a state law banning physician-assisted suicide \n \nCnty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 846 (1998)).  The Tenth Circuit has cautioned that \nโ[c]ourts should not unilaterally choose to consider only one or the otherโ test.  Id. at 769.  Here, \nno party raised the โshocks the conscienceโ test, and the Court does not believe it to be appropriate \nunder the facts of this case.  โ[O]nly the most egregious official conduct can be said to be arbitrary \nin the constitutional sense,โ id. at 767 (citation and quotation marks omitted), and nothing in the \nrecord gives the Court concern that the ordinary legislative process through which SB 613 was \ncodified would qualify as egregious.  Therefore, the Court focuses on the โfundamental libertyโ \ntest. \n18 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 19 of 36\nargued  that  โour  liberty  jurisprudence,  and  the  broad,  individualistic  principles  it  reflects, \nprotect[ed] the liberty of competent, terminally ill adults to make end-of-life decisions free of \nundue government interference.โ  521 U.S. at 724 (citation and quotation marks omitted).  The \nCourt narrowed the issue significantly, framing the question presented as โwhether the protections \nof the Due Process Clause include a right to commit suicide with anotherโs assistance.โ  Id. \nSimilarly, โ[a]lthough many of the Courtโs โprivacyโ decisions have implicated sexual \nmatters, the Court has never indicated that the mere fact that an activity is sexual and private \nentitles it to protection as a fundamental right.โ  Seegmiller, 528 F.3d at 770 (quoting Williams v. \nAttโy Gen. of Ala., 378 F.3d 1232, 1236 (11th Cir. 2004)).  Rather than considering broad, \ngeneralized rights, courts have examined โmore narrowly defined right[s]โ such as that โof married \ncouples to obtain and use contraceptives.โ  Id. (citing Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 485-\n86 (1965)).12 \nThe direction to district courts is clear:  an asserted implied right must be narrowly and \nprecisely expressed.  Thus, โour first job in assessing a substantive due process claim is to make a \nโcareful descriptionโ of the allegedly violated right.โ  Browder v. City of Albuquerque, 787 F.3d \n1076, 1078 (10th Cir. 2015) (quoting Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 721).  Here, the parties frame the \ndisputed liberty interest differently.  Plaintiffs describe the asserted right as โthe fundamental \nright[] of parents to seek appropriate medical care for their minor children.โ  Dkt. No. 6 at 25.  \nDefendants describe the asserted right as a โfundamental right for parents to choose for their \n \n12  Even when distinguishing Glucksberg, the Supreme Court structured the question presented \nbased on the action that plaintiffs wanted to perform rather than the characteristics of the plaintiffs.  \nSee Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644, 671 (2015).  More recently, the Court reiterated the \nGlucksberg standard in Dobbs, directing lower courts to โexercise the utmost careโ and avoid \nโfreewheeling judicial policymakingโ in structuring substantive due process inquiries.  142 S.Ct. \nat 2247-48. \n19 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 20 of 36\nchildren  to  use  puberty  blockers,  cross-sex  hormones,  and  surgeries  for  the  purposes  of \neffectuating a gender transition.โ  Dkt. No. 86 at 35.  The Court examines each. \nFederal precedent โhistorically has reflected Western civilization concepts of the family as \na unit with broad parental authority over minor children.โ  Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 602 \n(1979).  Parents are presumed to act in the best interest of their children.  Id. at 602-03 (โThat some \nparents may at times be acting against the interests of their children . . . creates a basis for caution[] \nbut is hardly a reason to discard wholesale those pages of human experience that teach that parents \ngenerally do act in the childโs best interests.โ) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). \nBecause โ[t]he lawโs concept of the family rests on a presumption that parents possess what \na child lacks in maturity, experience, and capacity for judgment required for making lifeโs difficult \ndecisions,โ id. at 602, โthe interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children [] \nis perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by [the] Court,โ Troxel v. \nGranville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000) (plurality opinion).  Parental obligations toward children include \nthe โโhigh dutyโ to recognize symptoms of illness and to seek and follow medical advice.โ  \nParham, 442 U.S. at 602.  โMost children, even in adolescence, simply are not able to make sound \njudgments concerning many decisions, including their need for medical care or treatment.  Parents \ncan and must make those judgments.โ  Id. at 603.  โNonetheless, [the Court has] recognized that a \nstate is not without constitutional control over parental discretion in dealing with children when \ntheir physical or mental health is jeopardized.โ  Id. \nAlthough the Tenth Circuit has โnever specifically recognized or defined the scope of a \nparentโs right to direct her childโs medical careโ it has expressed confidence in the position that โa \nparentโs general right to make decisions concerning the care of her child includes, to some extent, \na more specific right to make decisions about the childโs medical care.โ  PJ ex rel. Jensen v. \n20 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 21 of 36\nWagner, 603 F.3d 1182, 1197 (10th Cir. 2010) (citation and quotation omitted).  At the same time, \nโparental rights, including any right to direct a childโs medical care, are not absolute.โ  Id. at 1197-\n98 (first citing Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166 (1944); and then citing Parham, 442 \nU.S. at 604).  โIndeed, states have a compelling interest in and a solemn duty to protect the lives \nand health of the children within their borders.โ  Id. (citing Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Ct. \nfor Norfolk Cnty., 457 U.S. 596, 607 (1982)). \nA close examination of Parham and Troxel demonstrates that they do not support the \nconclusion that there is a broad, general right of the type asserted by Plaintiffs.  First, the Parham \ndecision involved procedural due process, which has a far less fraught history than its substantive \ncousin.  See 442 U.S. at 620 n.23.  The question at issue in Parham was whether minors had a due \nprocess right to greater procedural safeguardsโe.g., a judicial hearingโbefore their parents could \ncommit them to a mental health institution.  Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1222-23 (citing Parham, \n442 U.S. at 610).  โParham was concerned about the procedures a state must afford a child prior \nto institutionalization when the parent believes such treatmentโwhich is not only lawful but \nprovided by the state itselfโis necessary.โ  Id. at 1223 (emphasis added).  Because โParham does \nnot at all suggest that parents have a fundamental right to direct a particular medical treatment for \ntheir child that is prohibited by state law,โ it โoffers no supportโ for Plaintiffsโ substantive due \nprocess claim.  Id. \nNext, the Troxel case involved a fractured Court.  530 U.S. at 60.  Four justices joined the \nplurality opinion, two justices concurred in judgment only, and one of those two noted that the \ndecision did not โcall for turning any fresh furrows in the โtreacherous fieldโ of substantive due \nprocess.โ  Id. at 76 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment); see also id. at 80 (Thomas, J., concurring \nin judgment).  One of the dissenting justices noted that โ[d]espite this Courtโs repeated recognition \n21 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 22 of 36\nof [the] significant parental liberty interests, these interests have never been seen to be without \nlimits.โ  Id. at 87 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Another emphasized that โ[o]nly three holdings of [the \nSupreme] Court rest in whole or in part upon a substantive constitutional right of parents to direct \nthe upbringing of their childrenโtwo of them from an era rich in substantive due process holdings \nthat have since been repudiated.โ  Id. at 92 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Further, Troxel did not involve \nparental rights with respect to making medical decisions; it involved parental rights with respect \nto decision-making concerning the visitation of grandparents.  Id. at 61. \nFinally, the Tenth Circuit has avoided specificity, instead directing that, โ[w]hen a childโs \nlife or health is endangered by her parentsโ decisions, in some circumstances a state may intervene \nwithout violating the parentsโ constitutional rights.โ  Doe v. Woodard, 912 F.3d 1278, 1300 (10th \nCir. 2019) (quoting Jensen, 603 F.3d at 1198). \nThis analysis leads to the inevitable conclusion that Plaintiffsโ rights formulation has the \nsame overbreadth issue as the Glucksberg plaintiffsโ rights formulation.  Here, Parent Plaintiffs \nallege that Oklahomaโs ban on the Treatment Protocols violates their right to seek appropriate \nmedical care for their minor children.  Dkt. No. 6 at 25.  In Glucksberg, plaintiffs alleged that \nWashingtonโs ban on physician-assisted suicide violated their right to โmake end-of-life decisions \nfree of undue government interference.โ  521 U.S. at 724.  The Supreme Court rejected this wide \nformulation, instead narrowing the question presented to whether individuals had an affirmative \nright to perform a specific activity:  committing suicide with anotherโs assistance.  Id. \nโGuideposts  for  responsible  decisionmakingโ  regarding  substantive  due  process  are \nโscarce and open-endedโ in the best of circumstances.  Collins, 503 U.S. at 125.  Guideposts \nregarding parental medical decisionmaking are even more nebulous.  โIn interpreting what is \nmeant by the Fourteenth Amendment's reference to โliberty,โ we must guard against the natural \n22 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 23 of 36\nhuman tendency to confuse what that Amendment protects with our own ardent views about the \nliberty that Americans should enjoy.โ  Dobbs, 142 S.Ct. at 2247.  Thus, following the Supreme \nCourtโs direction to โexercise the utmost careโ in carefully describing the asserted fundamental \nliberty interest, the Court concludes that Plaintiffsโ rights formulation is too much of a โvague \ngeneralityโ to satisfy this first step. \nDefendantsโ framing of the issue is consistent with the approach approved by the Supreme \nCourt.  They define the asserted right as โa fundamental right for parents to choose for their \nchildren  to  use  puberty  blockers,  cross-sex  hormones,  and  surgeries  for  the  purposes  of \neffectuating a gender transition.โ  Dkt. No. 86 at 35.  This follows the  method of framing presented \nin Glucksberg and other substantive due process precedents.  See, e.g., 521 U.S. at 724; Lawrence \nv. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003) (examining whether substantive due process includes the right for \nadults to perform consensual homosexual acts in private).  Accord Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1221, \n1224 (emphasizing that โa substantive due process analysis must focus on the specific right \nasserted, rather than simply rely on a related general right,โ and framing the issue as a right to \nโtreat [oneโs] children with transitioning medications subject to medically accepted standardsโ) \n(alteration  in  original).    The  Court  finds  Defendantsโ  definition  is  an  appropriately  careful \ndescription of the allegedly violated right. \nB.  Historical Analysis \nNow that the Court has a definition for the allegedly infringed right, it must โexamine \nwhether the right at issue . . . is rooted in our Nationโs history and tradition and whether it is an \nessential component of what we have described as โordered liberty.โโ  Dobbs, 142 S.Ct. at 2244.  \nPlaintiffs have not provided any historical antecedents demonstrating that a right to the Treatment \n23 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 24 of 36\nProtocols is deeply rooted.13  Plaintiffs have therefore failed to carry their burden of proving the \nliberty interest they seek is so fundamental that it must be protected through a heightened scrutiny \nanalysis.  Seegmiller, 528 F.3d at 770. \nThe Courtโs conclusion is harmonious with the conclusions of numerous courts โreject[ing] \narguments that the Constitution provides an affirmative right of access to particular medical \ntreatments reasonably prohibited by the Government.โ14  Abigail All. for Better Access to Devโl \nDrugs v. von Eschenbach, 495 F.3d 695, 710 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (en banc); see also id. at n.18 (โNo \ncircuit court has acceded to an affirmative access claim.โ).  โWhile our longstanding traditions \nmay give individuals a right to refuse treatment, there is no historical support for an affirmative \nright to specific treatments.โ  Skrmetti, 2023 WL 6321688, at *9 (citing Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at \n725-26).  In fact, except for one district court in Texas in 1980,15 โit appears that every court to \nconsider the issue has rejected the argument that access to a specific treatment or specific provider \n.  .  .  is  a  fundamental  right  protected  by  the  Constitution.โ    Birchansky  v.  Clabaugh,  No. \n417CV00209RGERAW, 2018 WL 10110860, at *18 (S.D. Iowa Oct. 17, 2018), aff'd, 955 F.3d \n \n13  Borrowing Defendantsโ phrasing, โThe reason for this is simple:  The treatments that they seek \nhave only existed for a few decades.โ  Dkt. No. 86 at 35 (citing Dkt. No. 6-16 at ยถ 28).  As the \nEleventh Circuit recently explained, โthe earliest-recorded use of puberty blocking medication and \ncross-sex hormone treatment for purposes of treating the discordance between an individualโs \nbiological sex and sense of gender identity did not occur until well into the twentieth century.โ  \nEknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1220-21. \n14  Some of these cases involved various forms of executive action, such as practitioner licensing \nlaws or patients seeking access to treatments that had issues in the FDA approval process.  Here, \nSB 613 came about through legislative action.  The executive action cases are pertinent because \nthe key inquiry is whether the government (regardless of branch) infringed on constitutional rights.  \nSeegmiller, 528 F.3d at 767 (โAlthough some precedential support exists for [an] executive versus \nlegislative distinction, an overly rigid demarcation between the two lines of cases is neither \nwarranted by existing case law nor helpful to the substantive analysis.โ). \n15  Andrews v. Ballard, 498 F. Supp. 1038 (S.D. Tex. 1980) (holding the constitutional right of \nprivacy included a patient's right to obtain acupuncture treatment). \n24 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 25 of 36\n751 (8th Cir. 2020).  See also Nat'l Ass'n for Advan. of Psych. v. Cal. Bd. of Psych., 228 F.3d 1043, \n1050 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that โsubstantive due process rights do not extend to the choice of \ntype of treatment or of a particular health care provider.โ); Mitchell v. Clayton, 995 F.2d 772, 775 \n(7th Cir. 1993) (explaining that โmost federal courts have held that a patient does not have a \nconstitutional right to obtain a particular type of treatment or to obtain treatment from a particular \nprovider if the government has reasonably prohibited that type of treatment or providerโ).  And \nthe Tenth Circuit reversed a trial courtโs holding that the constitutional right of privacy allowed \npatients to take โwhatever treatment they wished regardless of whether the FDA regarded the \nmedication as โeffectiveโ or โsafe.โโ  Rutherford v. United States, 616 F.2d 455, 456 (10th Cir. \n1980).  The Sixth Circuit effectively summarized the issue: \nThis country does not have a โdeeply rootedโ tradition of preventing governments \nfrom regulating the medical profession in general or certain treatments in particular, \nwhether for adults or their children.  Quite to the contrary in fact.  State and federal \ngovernments have long played a critical role in regulating health and welfare, which \nexplains  why  their  efforts  receive  a  strong  presumption  of  validity.    State \ngovernments have an abiding interest in protecting the integrity and ethics of the \nmedical profession and preserving and promoting the welfare of the child.  These \ninterests give States broad power, even broad power to limit parental freedom when \nit comes to medical treatment. \nSkrmetti, 2023 WL 6321688, at *7 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \nIn the case before this Court, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a fundamental right for \nparents to choose for their children to use puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgeries for \nthe purpose of effectuating a gender transition.  โAbsent a fundamental right, the state may regulate \nan interest pursuant to a validly enacted state law or regulation rationally related to a legitimate \nstate interest.โ  Seegmiller, 528 F.3d at 771.  Accordingly, rational basis review applies. \nVI.  Rational Basis Review \nSince both of Plaintiffsโ constitutional claims call for rational basis review, the Court \nexamines the two claims in tandem to determine whether Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing \n25 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 26 of 36\nthat there is no rational basis for the restrictions in SB 613.  As explained below, it is unlikely that \nPlaintiffsโ claims will survive this level of scrutiny for numerous reasons, many of which are \ndemonstrated by the profound debate concerning this very issue. \nA.  Legislative Debate \nWhere, as here, there is robust scientific and political debate concerning a significant \npublic-policy question, a court should be loath to step in to end the debate and thereby suggest it \nis all-knowing.  The record in this case amply demonstrates that there is no consensus in the \nmedical field about the extent of the risks or the benefits of the Treatment Protocols.  See Section \nVI.B., infra.  Plaintiffs assert throughout their briefing that the Treatment Protocols for minors are \nnot  โexperimental.โ    While  this  is  perhaps  technically  true,  Plaintiffsโ  representations  are \nmisleading.  โNot experimentalโ in this case does not translate to โprovenโ or โestablished.โ16  \nRather, Plaintiffs admit that experiments and scientific studies of the sort generally seen in the \nmedical field have not been done in this area.  Whether such experiments or studies could be done \nethically is a topic of healthy debate between the partiesโ experts.  Compare Dkt. No. 6-16 at 9, 16 \nwith Dkt. No. 86-1 at 30, 132-33.  Nonetheless, it is more accurate to state that the Treatment \nProtocols are not โexperimentalโ only because the experimental phase has truly not yet begun. \nThe Court should not cut off this debate by declaring that only one side has all the answers \nin its corner.  Instead, the โconventional place for dealing with new norms, new drugs, and new \ntechnologies [is] the democratic process,โ and โ[l]ife-tenured federal judges should be wary of \nremoving a vexing and novel topic of medical debate from the ebbs and flows of democracy.โ  \nSkrmetti, 2023 WL 6321688, at *5.  When โAmericans are engaged in an earnest and profound \n \n16  See, e.g., Dkt. No. 132-1 at 10 (โExperiments test treatments by comparing two groups (or \nโarmsโ), one that receives the treatment and one that does not.  Because medicalized transition has \nnot yet been tested with a two-group design, it has not yet passed the experimental stage.โ) \n26 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 27 of 36\ndebate about the morality, legality, and practicalityโ of a life-altering medical intervention, courts \nare wise to โpermit[] this debate to continue, as it should in a democratic society.โ  Glucksberg, \n521 U.S. at 735.17  The Sixth Circuit succinctly applied this general rule to the issue at hand when \nit explained: \nGiven the high stakes of these nascent policy deliberationsโthe long-term health \nof children facing gender dysphoriaโsound government usually benefits from \nmore rather than less debate, more rather than less input, more rather than less \nconsideration of fair-minded policy approaches.  To permit legislatures on one side \nof the debate to have their say while silencing legislatures on the other side of the \ndebate under the Constitution does not further these goals.  That is all the more \ncritical in view of two realities looming over both casesโthe concept of gender \ndysphoria as a medical condition is relatively new and the use of drug treatments \nthat change or modify a childโs sex characteristics is even more recent.  Prohibiting \ncitizens and legislatures from offering their perspectives on high-stakes medical \npolicies,  in  which  compassion  for  the  child  points  in  both  directions,  is  not \nsomething life-tenured federal judges should do without a clear warrant in the \nConstitution. \nSkrmetti, 2023 WL 6321688, at *6.  The legislature in this case weighed in on one side of a \nnationwide dispute over how to balance the truth that parents generally can be expected to know \nwhat is best for their children against the competing reality that state governments have an abiding \ninterest โin protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profession,โ Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at \n731, and โpreserving and promoting the welfare of the child,โ Schall v. Martin, 467 U.S. 253, 265 \n(1984) (citation and quotation marks omitted).18  The very existence of this dispute, and ongoing \n \n17  It is evident that the states are engaged in thoughtful debate over this issue.  See Skrmetti, 2023 \nWL 6321688, at *6 (recognizing numerous state laws similar to those at issue restricting gender \ntransition procedures for minors, as well as state laws providing various protections for those \nseeking treatment for gender dysphoria).  The Sixth Circuit observed that most of this legislative \nactivity has occurred within the last two years and that the โ[f]ailure to allow these laws to go into \neffect would grind these all-over-the-map gears to halt.โ  Id. \n18  โ[I]t is well to remember that the most deeply rooted tradition in this country is that we look to \ndemocracy to answer pioneering public-policy questions, meaning that federal courts must resist \nthe temptation to invoke an unenumerated guarantee to โsubstituteโ their views for those of \nlegislatures.โ  Skrmetti, 2023 WL 6321688, at *7 (citing Dobbs, 142 S.Ct. at 2277). \n27 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 28 of 36\nthoughtful debate, is independent evidence that Plaintiffs are unlikely to establish that there is no \nrational basis for the legislatureโs decision. \nB.  Safeguarding Minors \nIt is rational for the Oklahoma Legislature to regulate the Treatment Protocols for minors \nwhile the democratic process resolves ongoing questions of safety and efficacy.  Courts have long \nrecognized that states have a compelling interest in โsafeguarding the physical and psychological \nwell-being of [] minors.โ  New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 756-57 (1982) (quoting Globe \nNewspaper, 457 U.S. at 607).  For this reason, the judiciary has โsustained legislation aimed at \nprotecting the physical and emotional well-being of youth even when the laws have operated in \nthe  sensitive  area  of  constitutionally  protected  rights.โ    Id.19    Indeed,  courts  have  upheld \nrestrictions designed to protect and prevent minors from engaging in behaviors that are far less \nrisky than the procedures banned by SB 613.  See e.g., City of Dallas v. Stanglin, 490 U.S. 19, 28 \n(1989) (upholding age restriction for dance halls based upon โthe cityโs interest in promoting the \nwelfare of teenagersโ).20 \nThe Court could conclude that Plaintiffsโ challenge to SB 613 is unlikely to succeed based \non nothing more than its own rational speculation, should it choose to do so.  F.C.C. v. Beach \n \n19  See, e.g., In re Hawley, 606 N.W.2d 50, 53 (1999) (decision to charge 15 year old, but not his \n13 year old partner, for conduct arising from the pairโs sexual relationship did not violate Equal \nProtection Clause because the difference in age was a โlegitimate distinguishing factorโ under the \nstatutory scheme); Am. Entโrs, L.L.C. v. City of Rocky Mount, N.C., 888 F.3d 707, 723 (4th Cir. \n2018) (confirming stateโs interest in ensuring that sexually-oriented-business owners are of legal \ndrinking age justified age-based restriction on ownership of such venues). \n20  See also Qutb v. Strauss, 11 F.3d 488, 496 (5th Cir. 1993) (affirming curfew ordinance \nfollowing strict scrutiny review); Rothner v. City of Chicago, 929 F.2d 297, 298 (7th Cir. 1991) \n(affirming ordinance prohibiting minors from playing video games during school hours); Blassman \nv. Markworth, 359 F. Supp. 1, 6 (N.D. Ill. 1973) (concluding stateโs decision to set a minimum \nage for state and local officers was neither unreasonable nor irrational). \n28 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 29 of 36\nCommcโns, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 315 (1993) (noting that, on rational basis review, โlegislative choice \nis not subject to courtroom fact-finding and may be based on rational speculation unsupported by \nevidence or empirical dataโ).  But such speculation is not necessary, as there is ample record \nevidence to establish that SB 613 is rationally related to a legitimate state interest for at least four \ndistinct reasons. \n1.  Difference in Diagnoses \nIt is undisputed that gender transition procedures address a psychological diagnosis, rather \nthan a physiological one.  See Dkt. No. 119-4 at 3 (concession by Plaintiffsโ expert that โ[g]ender \ndysphoria is a psychiatric diagnosisโ).  A diagnosis of gender dysphoria depends upon โpatientsโ \nreports of their symptoms,โ rather than objective diagnostic criteria, and there is no evidence that \na diagnosis of gender dysphoria can be confirmed by any objective measurement or testing \nprotocol.  Id. at 4; Dkt. No. 86-1 at 126-27 (distinguishing a medical diagnosis, which identifies \nthe cause of a patientโs symptoms, and a psychiatric diagnosis, which labels the symptoms \nregardless of cause).  The evidence demonstrates that a diagnosis of gender dysphoria is so tied to \nthe patientsโ subjective beliefs and psychological condition that it cannot be diagnosed over a \npatientโs objection.21  This diagnosis is, therefore, readily distinguishable from the physiological \n \n21  Dkt. No. 86-1 at 127. \n29 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 30 of 36\nconditionsโincluding precocious puberty22 and disorders of sexual development23โthat are \nspecifically exempted from the statutory definition of โgender transition procedures.โ  It is entirely \nwithin the legislatureโs purview to conclude that, while it may be appropriate for a minor to \nundergo hormone therapy and/or surgery to address a physiological condition, it is not appropriate \nfor a minor to undergo such invasive procedures to treat a psychological one.24 \n2.  Difference in Purpose and Risks \nPlaintiffs argue that the same Treatment Protocols are allowed for cisgender (or non-\ntransgender) children but unfairly banned for transgender children.  As an example, Plaintiffs \nsuggest that cisgender children are allowed access to the Treatment Protocols for precocious \npuberty while transgender children are denied the Treatment Protocols.  But this argument misses \n \n22  Precocious puberty is a condition diagnosed by reference to objective facts and measurements, \nincluding the age of the patient, the existence of physical indicia that puberty has begun, and \nincreased testosterone or estrogen production.  Dkt. No. 86-2 at 11 (describing the stages of sexual \ndevelopment and the physical symptoms associated with each); id. at 17 (recognizing that the onset \nof puberty is associated with an increase in the production of sex hormones); id. at 22 (identifying \nages with corresponding stages of pubertal development); Dkt. No. 86-3 at 16-17, 28 (describing \nphysical changes and onset ages associated with Tanner Stage 2 of pubertal development).  Minor \npatients being treated for the physiological condition of precocious puberty are therefore readily \ndistinguishable from minor patients being treated for the psychological condition of gender \ndysphoria. \n23  Dkt. No. 86-1 at 124 (describing disorders of sexual development as โphysical medical \ndisordersโ which can be diagnosed using objective and verifiable criteria).  A physical disorder of \nsexual development that can be observed or detected through objective means is not โlikeโ a \npsychological diagnosis that cannot be ascertained in the absence of a subjective complaint. \n24  Plaintiffs argue that neither the manner in which gender dysphoria is classified nor the \nsubjectivity of the symptoms associated with that condition undermines the validity of a gender \ndysphoria diagnosis.  Dkt. No. 119-4 at 4.  This may be true, but this Court is not being asked \nwhether gender dysphoria is a valid diagnosis; instead, the Court is being asked to determine \nwhether the legislature has a rational basis for banning certain procedures for use in addressing \ngender  dysphoria,  but  permitting  those  procedures  to  treat  other,  physiological  conditions.  \nPlaintiffsโ concession that gender dysphoria is a psychological diagnosis based upon patientsโ \nsubjective reports of their symptoms is particularly salient to the latter question. \n30 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 31 of 36\nan important fact.  Nothing in SB 613 bans the Treatment Protocols to treat any child for \nprecocious  puberty,  a  physiological  malady,  whether  the  child  is  cisgender  or  transgender.  \nConversely, the Treatment Protocols are banned to treat all children for gender dysphoria, a \npsychological condition. \nThe evidence likewise demonstrates that minors who seek to undergo the Treatment \nProtocols for the purpose of affirming perceived gender face risks that are different and more \nextensive than those for minors who would use the same protocols for other diagnoses.  Minors \nwho undergo the Treatment Protocols for purposes of gender affirming careโin contrast to those \nwho use the same protocols to treat precocious pubertyโdo so with the intent and effect of \nundergoing puberty later than it would be physically appropriate to do so.  These are different \ntreatments with different purposes.  As a result, the risks are very different.  See Dkt. No. 86-1 at \n36 (recognizing that the โuse of puberty blockers to treat precocious puberty avoids the medical \nrisks caused by undergoing puberty growth before the body is ready,โ while the use of the same \nmedication on โpatients already at their natural puberty pushes them away from the mean age of \nthe healthy populationโ). \nUndergoing puberty later than the typical range of pubertal onset carries a range of risks, \nincluding impaired brain development25 and poorer psychosocial and educational development.26  \n \n25  See Dkt. No. 86-1 at 99-100 (recognizing an association of brain development with age of \npubertal onset, a correlation between the administration of GnRH-agonists and a decrease in brain \nactivity and cognitive performance, and concerns that โblocking the process of puberty during its \nnatural time could have a negative and potentially permanent impact on brain developmentโ); Dkt. \nNo. 86-2 at 25 (acknowledging that sex hormones can influence the development and maturation \nof the human brain); Dkt. No. 86-3 at 7. \n26  See Dkt. No. 86-1 at 101 (recognizing that โ[u]ndergoing puberty much later than oneโs peers \nis also associated with poorer psychosocial functioning and lesser educational achievementโ); Dkt. \nNo. 86-2 at 25 (noting the importance of peer relationships during adolescence and recognizing \nthat one reason for treating precocious puberty with puberty blockers is the generally accepted \n31 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 32 of 36\nMinors who undergo the Treatment Protocols to delay puberty for gender-transition purposes take \non these risks (whether knowingly or unknowingly); those who use the same protocols for the \npurpose of undergoing puberty at an age-appropriate time, in contrast, attempt to avoid them.  Dkt. \nNo. 86-1 at 36; Dkt. No. 86-2 at 18, 22; Dkt. No. 86-4 at 9-10.  This is a rational basis for the \nlegislatureโs decision. \n3.  Difference in Length of Use \nThe risks associated with the Treatment Protocols also vary depending upon when and for \nhow long they are administered.  For example, the evidence suggests that puberty blockers \nnegatively impact a childโs ability to increase his or her bone density.  See Dkt. 86-1 at 102; Dkt. \nNo. 86-2 at 22-24.  A minor who is prescribed puberty blockers during the teen years, when bone \ndensity โtypically surges by about 8 to 12 percent a year,โ faces a differentโand more seriousโ\nrisk than a minor with precocious puberty whose body is not in a similar stage of growth.  Dkt. \nNo. 86-1 at 102; see Dkt. No. 86-2 at 22-23 (recognizing that peak bone mass is achieved in the \nearly to late twenties for both males and females, and that โfactors which lead to a lowering of \npeak bone mass will predispose a person to future osteoporosisโ).27 \nSimilarly, a five-year-old who undergoes pubertal suppression will delayโfor a timeโ\nsexual development until his or her body is able to withstand the changes associated with puberty, \nat which point puberty will be allowed to resume; a child administered puberty blockers during \nadolescence, by contrast, will inhibit puberty at the precise time his or her body should be \n \nunderstanding in endocrinology that โthere are psychological benefits to adolescents who go \nthrough puberty around the same time as their peersโ). \n27  See also id. at 23-24, Fig. 2 (discussing impact on puberty blocking medication on bone density \nand opining that any pause in normal puberty introduces a risk of inability to obtain peak bone \ndensity and creates a risk of osteoporosis, serious fractures, and impairment of bone growth). \n32 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 33 of 36\nundergoing those same changes.  See Dkt. No. 86-2 at 21-22.  Individuals in the latter group โwill \ncontinue  their  chronological  age  progression  toward  adulthood  and  yet  remain  with \nunderdeveloped genitalia,โ will immediately experience infertility,28 and will run the risk of \nmasking  developmental  milestones  that,  by  their  presence  or  absence,  would  give  medical \npractitioners insight as to the individualsโ overall health.  Dkt. No. 86-2 at 22; Dkt. No. 86-3 at 39 \n(recognizing that puberty blockers, if administered at Tanner Stage 2, โmakes the full maturation \nof the gametes impossibleโ); Dkt. No. 86-3 at 39 (noting that suppressing pubertal development \nmasks the onset of the menstrual cycle, the absence of which can be indicative of underlying \nphysiological  diseases).    The  legislatureโs  decision  can  readily  be  construed  as  a  rational \ndetermination that the risks associated with minorsโ short-term use of the Treatment Protocols to \ntreat precocious puberty are warranted, while the risks associated with minorsโ long-term (and \noften permanent)29 use of the Treatment Protocols for gender dysphoria are not. \n4.  Difference in Intent \nFinally, the legislatureโs decision to ban the Treatment Protocols solely for certain purposes \nis warranted by the fact that the Treatment Protocols are permitted for those who seek to align their \nbodies with the development they would undergo without being in a diseased or disordered state, \nbut not for those who seek to force their bodies out of alignment with such development.  When \nused to treat endocrine disorders, the Treatment Protocols bring the patientโs body back into the \nhormonal states they would have been in but for the disorder.  See Dkt. No. 86-2 at 12.  When used \n \n28  While there is potential for this infertility to be transient, there appears to be scant information \nconcerning the impact of the long-term use of puberty blockers.  See Dkt. No. 86-2 at 20, n.5. \n29  See Dkt. 86-2 at 26 (recognizing that the use of puberty blockers has altered natural desistance \nrates, such that puberty blockers, rather than operating as a โpause button,โ are instead a โpathway \ntowards future sterilizing surgeriesโ). \n33 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 34 of 36\nto treat precocious puberty, the Treatment Protocols allow the patientโs body to go through puberty \nat the appropriate time, rather than at an unhealthy time.  Dkt. No. 86-1 at 105.  When used to treat \na disorder of sexual development, the Treatment Protocols are used to correct a diagnosable \ncondition that occurred โon the way to binary sex development.โ  Dkt. No. 86-2 at 9.  When, \nhowever, the Treatment Protocols are used to treat gender dysphoria, they have the effect of \npushing  the  body  out  of  alignment  with  the  natural  developmental  process  to  permit  the \nindividualโs cosmetic appearance to align with his or her perception.  See Dkt. No. 86-1 at 36.  \nPlaintiffs themselves acknowledge that the goal of the Treatment Protocols is not to cure the state \nof being transgendered.  See Dkt. No. 6 at 8 (โBeing transgender is not itself a condition to be \ncured.โ); Dkt. No. 6-2 at 11 (โ[B]eing transgender or gender nonconforming is not a medical \ncondition or pathology to be treated.โ).  Accord Dkt. No. 86-3 at 7 (โ[I]dentifying as transgender . \n. . is not a pathological condition (i.e., it is not caused by or considered to be a disease.โ).  The \nlegislatureโs decision to permit minors to have access to the Treatment Protocols for medical \ndisorders that can be cured or corrected, but not to permit those same protocols (with greater \nassociated risk) to treat a condition for which no โcureโ is sought, is a rational one. \nIn sum, โstates have a compelling interest in and a solemn duty to protect the lives and \nhealth of the children within their borders.โ  Jensen, 603 F.3d at 1198.  Where there is robust \ndebate concerning whether that interest warrants authorizing a particular medical procedure for a \nminor child, the debate is best left in the hands of the legislature.  Judicial deference is especially \nappropriate where โmedical and scientific uncertaintyโ exists.  Gonzalez v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, \n163 (2007).  It is certainly not the judiciaryโs role to cut into that thoughtful debate and decree that \n34 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 35 of 36\none side has the right of it, and the Court declines Plaintiffsโ invitation to make such a decree.30  \nAs evidenced by the ongoing debate on this issue, Plaintiffs stand little chance of prevailing on \ntheir claim under the rational basis standard, and their motion for injunctive relief is therefore \nDENIED. \nCONCLUSION \nAs to equal protection, SB 613 is not an outright ban on gender affirming care.  Nor is it a \nbill that has the intent or effect of enforcing stereotypical gender norms or discriminating against \nthose who do not conform to those norms.  Instead, SB 613 requires only that, to the extent an \nindividual desires to utilize certain physiological procedures to treat the psychological condition \nof gender dysphoria, he or she must wait until a certain age to do so.  See Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of \nRegents, 528 U.S. 62, 83 (2000) (recognizing that states โmay discriminate on the basis of age \nwithout offending the Fourteenth Amendment if the age classification in question is rationally \nrelated to a legitimate state interestโ).  This permissible, age-based restriction is subject only to \nrational basis review, which is easily satisfied by at least the four alternative grounds identified by \nthe Court in Section VI.B., supra.  Given the state of the record, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs \nhave failed to establish that they are likely to prevail on their claim that there is no rational basis \nfor the legitimate, age-based distinction made by the legislature. \nAs to substantive due process, SB 613 is rationally related to legitimate state interests \nbecause  it  regulates  parental  decision-making  as  to  the  Treatment  Protocols  based  on  the \n \n30  The Courtโs determination that the legislature has a rational basis for the exercise of caution in \nthis realm should not be interpreted as a lack of concern for Plaintiffs or any minor experiencing \nreal psychological suffering.  It should be apparent there is deep concern for the well-being of the \nchildren in this state, such that the legislature has determined caution is warranted given the \nmagnitude of risks involved and the lack of medical and scientific evidence to support the would-\nbe experimental treatment of gender dysphoria by use of the Treatment Protocols. \n35 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 138 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/05/23   Page 36 of 36\nlegislatureโs interests in protecting children, public health, and integrity of the medical profession.  \nThis an area in which medical and policy debate is unfolding and the Oklahoma Legislature can \nrationally take the side of caution before permitting irreversible medical treatments of its children.  \nAs the Eleventh Circuit explained: \nThis case revolves around an issue that is surely of the utmost importance to all of \nthe parties involved:  the safety and well-being of the children of [our state].  But it \nis complicated by the fact that there is a strong disagreement between the parties \nover what is best for those children.  Absent a constitutional mandate to the \ncontrary, these types of issues are quintessentially the sort that our system of \ngovernment reserves to legislative, not judicial, action. \nEknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1231.  Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the \nmerits of their substantive due process claim. \nBecause Plaintiffs have failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits of each of their \nconstitutional claims, their request for injunctive relief must be denied.  State v. U.S. Envโt Prot. \nAgency, 989 F.3d 874, 890 (10th Cir. 2021) (recognizing that where the failure to satisfy one \nrequisite factor for obtaining preliminary injunctive relief is dispositive, a court โneed not consider \nthe other factorsโ). \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ motion for preliminary injunction [Dkt. \nNo. 5] is DENIED. \nDated this 5th day of October 2023. \n \n             \nJOHN F.

Senate Bill 613 (โSB 613โ) conditions the medical \ncare a minor may receive on the sex that person was assigned at birth, prohibiting health care \nproviders from administering medically necessary care for transgender minors with a diagnosis of \ngender dysphoria, while leaving non-transgender minors free to receive the same procedures and \ntreatments. The United States respectfully submits this Statement of Interest under 28 U.S.C. \nยง 5171 to advise the Court of the United Statesโ view that, by denying transgender minorsโand \nonly transgender minorsโaccess to medically necessary and appropriate care, SB 613 violates the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are likely to \nsucceed on the merits of their equal protection claim. See Pls.โ Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (Dkt. 5).2 \nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES \nThe United States has a strong interest in protecting individual and civil rights, including \nthe  rights  of  transgender  persons,  and  in  the  consistent  application  across  the  country  of \nconstitutional standards to the rights of transgender persons. Executive Order 13,988 recognizes \nthe right of all people to be โtreated with respect and dignity,โ โto access healthcare . . . without \n \n1 Under 28 U.S.C. ยง 517, โ[t]he Solicitor General, or any officer of the Department of Justice, may \nbe sent by the Attorney General to any State or district in the United States to attend to the interests \nof the United States in a suit pending in a court of the United States, or in a court of a State, or to \nattend to any other interest of the United States.โ See Gross v. German Found. Indus. Initiative, \n456 F.3d 363, 384 (3d Cir. 2006) (โThe United States Executive has the statutory authority [under \n28 U.S.C. ยง 517], in any case in which it is interested, to file a statement of interest . . . .โ). While \nthe United States does not interpret this statute to require leave to file this brief, the United States \nrespectfully requests leave of Court if the Court interprets this statute differently. \n2 The United States expresses no view on any issues in this case other than those set forth in this \nbrief. \n1 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 61 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 06/09/23   Page 7 of 30\nbeing subjected to sex discrimination,โ and to โreceive equal treatment under the law, no matter \ntheir gender identity or sexual orientation.โ 86 Fed. Reg. 7,023 (Jan. 25, 2021). \nThe United States has, for example, intervened in litigation challenging an Alabama law \nimposing a felony ban on the provision of gender-affirming care to minors and obtained a \npreliminary injunction to halt enforcement of the law. See Eknes-Tucker v. Marshall, 603 F. Supp. \n3d 1131, 1151 (M.D. Ala. 2022) (enjoining enforcement), appeal filed, No. 22-11707 (11th Cir. \nMay 18, 2022); U.S. Am.

Transgender Youth and Their Need for Medically Appropriate Gender-Affirming \nCare \n \nTransgender people are individuals whose gender identity does not conform with the sex \nthey were assigned at birth. 3 A transgender boy is a child or youth who was assigned a female sex \nat birth but whose gender identity is male; a transgender girl is a child or youth who was assigned \na male sex at birth but whose gender identity is female.

The Text of the Statute \nSB 613 provides that a โhealth care provider shall not knowingly provide gender transition \nprocedures to any child,โ ยง 1(B), defined as any person under the age of eighteen, ยง 1(A)(1). The \nstatute defines โgender transition proceduresโ as โmedical or surgical services performed for the \npurpose of attempting to affirm the minorโs perception of his or her gender or biological sex, if \nthat  perception  is  inconsistent  with  the  minorโs  biological  sex,โ  specifically  โ(1) surgical \nprocedures that alter or remove physical or anatomical characteristics or features that are typical \nfor the individualโs biological sex,โ and โ(2) puberty-blocking drugs, cross-sex hormones, or other \ndrugs to suppress or delay normal puberty or to promote the development of feminizing or \nmasculinizing features consistent with the opposite biological sex.โ ยง 1(A)(2)(a). The statute does \nnot define โbiological sex.โ21 Excluded from the definition of โgender transition procedures,โ and \ntherefore  from  the  statuteโs  prohibitions,  are  โservices  provided  to  individuals  born  with \nambiguous genitalia, incomplete genitalia, or both male and female anatomy, or biochemically \nverifiable disorder of sex development . . . .โ ยง 1(A)(2)(b)(4). โDisorders of sex developmentโ are \nalso known as intersex traits.22 \n \n20 These are: Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, Members of the Oklahoma State \nBoard of Medical Licensure and Supervision, Members of the Oklahoma Board of Nursing, and \nMembers of the Oklahoma State Board of Osteopathic Examiners. See Dkt. 41. \n21 The term โbiological sexโ is less precise than term โsex assigned at birth.โ This is because the \nphysiological aspects of a personโs sex are not always aligned.

Legislative History \nSB 613 was one of fifteen bills introduced during the 2023 Oklahoma legislative session \nthat would prohibit or limit treatment of gender dysphoria.23 In discussing SB 613 and these related \nbills, Oklahoma legislators demonstrated anti-transgender animus. For example, in addressing SB \n613,  one  supporter  of  the  bill  said  that  being  transgender  was  a  path  toward  โdesolation, \ndestruction, degeneracy, and delusion, ending in delusional play acting.โ24 In discussing a different \nbill prohibiting insurance coverage for certain gender-affirming care, the same legislator stated \nthat transgender individuals need โwise and clear biblical guidance.โ25 A co-author of SB 613, in \na floor debate on the bill, referred to gender-affirming care as โmisinformationโ and โa lie.โ26 \nAnother legislator, in voicing support for SB 613, appeared to refer to two transgender individuals \nas โpretending.โ27 See also Compl.

SB 613 does just that. Accordingly, it is subject \nto intermediate scrutiny, which it fails because it is not substantially related to an important \ngovernment  interest.  Plaintiffs  are  therefore  likely  to  succeed  on  the  merits  on  their  equal \nprotection claim concerning SB 613. \nI.  SB 613โs Ban on Gender-Affirming Medical Care Warrants Intermediate Scrutiny \nUnder the Equal Protection Clause. \n \nSB 613 prohibits only transgender youth from obtaining medically necessary gender-\naffirming care but leaves other minors eligible for the same treatments.

And that duty is even \nmore important when it comes to protecting children.โ). \n29 For example, in discussing SB 613, the billโs author referred to gender-affirming care as \nโexperimentalโ and โvery dangerous,โ with the potential to cause โunpredictable, unsettled, and \nirreversible physical conditionsโ in children.

SB 613โs Ban on Gender-Affirming Medical Care is Subject to Intermediate Scrutiny \nBecause It Discriminates on the Basis of Sex. \n \nWhen evaluating sex-based discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause, courts apply \nโheightenedโ or โintermediateโ scrutiny. See Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.S. 456, 461 (1988) (โBetween \n \nthe[]  extremes  of  rational  basis  review  and  strict  scrutiny  lies  a  level  of  intermediate \nscrutiny . . . .โ).  Intermediate scrutiny is appropriate in this case because discrimination against \nindividuals because they are transgender is a form of discrimination based on sex.  \nAs the U.S. Supreme Court held in Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1746 \n(2020), sex discrimination โunavoidablyโ occurs when an individual is treated differently based \non transgender status, because the individual had โone sex identified at birthโ but identifies with a \ndifferent sex โtoday.โ For that reason, โit is impossible to discriminate against a person for \nbeing . . . transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.โ  Id. at 1741. \nAnd the Tenth Circuit has expressly acknowledged that โ[i]n the wake of Bostock, it is now clear \nthat transgender discrimination . . . is discrimination โbecause of sex.โโ Tudor v. Se. Okla. State \nUniv., 13 F.4th 1019, 1028 (10th Cir. 2021). In addition, following Bostock, numerous courts \noutside  the  Tenth  Circuit  have  analyzed  discrimination  against  transgender  people  as  sex \ndiscrimination and applied intermediate scrutiny in the equal protection context. E.g., Adams by & \nthrough Kasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 57 F.4th 791, 803 (11th Cir. 2022) (en banc); Grimm \nv. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 611-13 (4th Cir. 2020).    \nA  district  court  in  Colorado  recently  declined  to  apply  intermediate  scrutiny  to  a \ntransgender pretrial detaineeโs equal protection claims, but that case is both nonbinding and \n10 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 61 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 06/09/23   Page 16 of 30\nwrongly  decided.  See  Griffith  v.  El  Paso  County,  No.  21-cv-00387-CMA-NRN,  2023  WL \n3099625, at *7-*8 (D. Colo. Mar. 27, 2023), appeal filed, No. 23-1135 (10th Cir. Apr. 26, 2023). \nIn Griffith, the court relied on a nearly thirty-year-old Tenth Circuit opinion, Brown v. Zavaras, \n63 F.3d 967 (10th Cir. 1995), in which the court of appeals did not consider or analyze a sex \ndiscrimination claim. Rather, in Brown, the court of appeals considered whether transgender \npeople were a โquasi-suspect classโ entitled to intermediate scrutiny under the Equal Protection \nClause, and declined to make that finding because the pro se plaintiffโs allegations were โtoo \nconclusoryโ to permit analysis of the relevant factors. Id. at 971. Because Brown did not address \nwhether discrimination against transgender individuals constitutes sex discrimination, the Griffith \ncourt was mistaken in construing Brown to preclude application of intermediate scrutiny under a \nsex-discrimination theory. The Court should decline to apply that reasoning here.  See also \nDiscussion ยง I.B., infra (discussing Brown and Griffith in context of quasi-suspect class analysis). \nHere, the Court should conclude that SB 613 discriminates on the basis of sex because the \nmedical treatments available to a minor depend on the sex the minor was assigned at birth. Other \ncourts have recently reached the same conclusion in similar contexts. See Brandt by & through \nBrandt v. Rutledge, 47 F.4th 661, 669-70 (8th Cir. 2022) (holding that โbecause the minorโs sex at \nbirth determines whether or not the minor can receive certain types of medical care underโ a law \nbanning gender-affirming care for minors, that law โdiscriminates on the basis of sexโ and is \ntherefore subject to intermediate scrutiny), rehโg en banc denied, 2022 WL 16957734 (8th Cir. \nNov. 16, 2022); Doe v. Ladapo, No. 4:23-cv-114-RH-MAF, 2023 WL 3833848, at *1, *8  (N.D. \nFla. June 6, 2023) (granting preliminary injunction and holding that Floridaโs ban on gender-\naffirming care draws a โline . . . on the basis of sex, plain and simple[,]โ and is therefore subject \nto intermediate scrutiny); Eknes-Tucker, 603 F. Supp. 3d at 1147 (holding that Alabamaโs felony \n11 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 61 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 06/09/23   Page 17 of 30\ngender-affirming care ban โconstitutes a sex-based classification for purposes of the Fourteenth \nAmendmentโ).  \n \nUnder SB 613, the medical treatments available to a minor depend expressly on โbiological \nsex.โ See ยง 1(A)(2)(a). For example, under SB 613, a minor assigned female at birth cannot receive \ntestosterone to treat gender dysphoria, but a non-transgender minor assigned male at birth can \nreceive testosterone to treat low hormone production because the treatment is consistent with the \nsex the minor was assigned at birth. See id.  \nSB 613 also discriminates on the basis of sex because it conditions the availability of \nparticular medical procedures on compliance with sex stereotypes.31 First, it conditions medical \ncare on the assumption that an individualโs gender identity should match their sex assigned at birth. \nSecond,  it  conditions  medical  care  on  whether  the  care  would  alter  โphysical  or  anatomic \ncharacteristics or features . . . typical for . . . the individualโs biological sex,โ ยง 1(A)(2)(a)(1) \n(emphasis added), and prohibits certain care that would โpromote the development of feminizing \nor masculinizing features consistent with the opposite biological sex,โ ยง 1(A)(2)(a)(2) (emphasis \nadded). The phrases โtypical forโ and โconsistent withโ confirm reliance on sex stereotypes. If the \n \n31 Multiple circuits have held that discrimination against transgender individuals based on their \ngender nonconformity is sex discrimination. See, e.g., Rutledge, 47 F.4th at 670; Grimm, 972 F.3d \nat 611-13 (concluding that school boardโs policy prohibiting transgender students from using \nrestrooms that match their gender identity constitutes sex-based discrimination and transgender \npersons constitute quasi-suspect class); Whitaker by Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 \nBd. of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034, 1051 (7th Cir. 2017) (finding school policy requiring students to use \nbathroom in accordance with sex on studentโs birth certificate to be โinherently based upon a sex-\nclassificationโ), abrogated on other grounds as recognized by Ill. Republican Party v. Pritzker, \n973 F.3d 760, 762 (7th Cir. 2020); Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1317 (11th Cir. 2011) \n(โ[D]iscrimination against a transgender individual because of her gender-nonconformity is sex \ndiscrimination, whether itโs described as being on the basis of sex or gender.โ); Smith v. City of \nSalem, 378 F.3d 566, 572, 577 (6th Cir. 2004) (holding that employee whose employment the City \nsought to terminate because of employeeโs transgender status stated sex-discrimination claim \nunder Title VII and Equal Protection Clause). \n12 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 61 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 06/09/23   Page 18 of 30\nmedical care sought reinforces sex stereotypes, SB 613โs prohibitions are not triggered, such as \nwhen a non-transgender minor assigned female at birth has a voluntary breast reduction procedure \nfor pain-remediation purposes. But SB 613 would prohibit a similar procedureโeven when \nrecommended as medically appropriateโfor a transgender teenage boy who was assigned female \nat birth simply because it would result in certain โcharacteristicsโ or โfeaturesโ not stereotypically \nassociated with individuals assigned female at birth. Third, SB 613โs carve-out for intersex minors, \nยง 1(A)(2)(b)(4), again reflects sex stereotypes. SB 613 permits intersex minors to obtain treatments \nidentical to those it forbids for transgender minors, presumably because those procedures are \nintended to align the intersex minorsโ physical appearance with stereotypes associated with their \nsex assigned at birth.  \nB.  SB 613โs Ban on Gender-Affirming Medical Care is Subject to Intermediate Scrutiny \nBecause It Discriminates Against Transgender Individuals, a Quasi-Suspect Class. \n \nAlthough the Court need not reach the question here, SB 613 warrants intermediate \nscrutiny for the separate and independent reason that it discriminates on the basis of transgender \nstatus, a quasi-suspect classification.32 See Lyng v. Castillo, 477 U.S. 635, 638 (1986) (noting that \nโheightened scrutinyโ applies to constitutional claims of discrimination based on membership in a \nโquasi-suspectโ class). SB 613 penalizes medical practices performed upon a minor โfor the \npurpose of attempting to affirm the minorโs perception of his or her gender or biological sex, if \nthat perception is inconsistent with the minorโs biological sex.โ ยง 1(A)(2)(a). A transgender person \nis, by definition, someone whose gender identity is not consistent with their sex assigned at birth.  \n \n32 Griffith, 2023 WL 3099625, is currently on appeal to the Tenth Circuit and raises the question \nwhether transgender individuals constitute a quasi-suspect class. Because discrimination against \ntransgender  individuals  constitutes  sex  discrimination  and  thus  independently  triggers \nintermediate scrutiny, this Court need not determine whether transgender status is, itself, a quasi-\nsuspect classification. Should the Court reach this question, however, the Court should conclude \nthat transgender persons are a quasi-suspect class. \n13 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 61 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 06/09/23   Page 19 of 30\nNumerous courts have held that transgender status is a quasi-suspect classification under \nthe Equal Protection Clause. See, e.g., Grimm, 972 F.3d at 611, 613; Ray v. McCloud, 507 F. Supp. \n3d 925, 937 (S.D. Ohio 2020); F.V. v. Barron, 286 F. Supp. 3d 1131, 1145 (D. Idaho 2018), \ndecision clarified sub nom. F.V. v. Jeppesen, 477 F. Supp. 3d 1144 (D. Idaho 2020); Flack v. Wis. \nDepโt of Health Servs., 328 F. Supp. 3d 931, 951-53 (W.D. Wisc. 2018); M.A.B. v. Bd. of Educ. of \nTalbot Cnty., 286 F.

Supp. 3d 850, 873-74 (S.D. Ohio 2016); Adkins v. City of New York, 143 F. Supp. \n3d 134, 139-140 (S.D.N.Y. 2015); Norsworthy v. Beard, 87 F. Supp. 3d 1104, 1119 (N.D. Cal. \n2015). See also Karnoski v. Trump, 926 F.3d 1180, 1200-02 (9th Cir. 2019) (concluding that \nintermediate scrutiny, not rational basis review, applies when evaluating a policy that treats \ntransgender persons differently from other persons). \nThe Tenth Circuitโs opinion in Brown v. Zavaras, 63 F.3d 967 (10th Cir. 1995), does not \npreclude this Court from considering this issue. In 1995, the Brown court declined to find that \ntransgender  people  were  a  quasi-suspect  class  entitled  to  intermediate  scrutiny  because  the \nallegations of the pro se plaintiff in that case were โtoo conclusoryโ to permit analysis of the \nrelevant factors.  Id. at 971. The courtโs decision also rested on a since-overruled Ninth Circuit \ncase holding that transgender status was โnot an immutable characteristic.โ Id. (citing Holloway v. \nArthur Andersen & Co., 566 F.2d 659, 663 (9th Cir. 1977)); see also Grimm, 972 F.3d at 611 \n(discussing Brown and noting it โreluctantly followed [the] since-overruled Ninth Circuit opinionโ \nin Holloway). While some courts have suggested Brown still requires, nearly thirty years after it \nwas decided, the application of rational basis review to equal protection claims involving anti-\ntransgender discrimination, see, e.g., Grimm, 972 F.3d at 611; Griffith, 2023 WL 3099625, at *7-\n14 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 61 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 06/09/23   Page 20 of 30\n*8, the Brown decision itself cast doubt on that interpretation. Indeed, even in 1995, the Brown \ncourt  recognized  that  โ[r]ecent  research  concluding  that  sexual  identity  may  be  biological \nsuggest[ed] reevaluatingโ its narrow holding. 63 F.3d at 971. Here, the Plaintiffsโ allegations are \nrobust and far from conclusory, see, e.g., Compl. ยถยถ 50-52, 118, 209-10, 221, and as explained \nbelow, the medical and scientific literature has evolved dramatically over the last thirty years.  \nThis Court should therefore join the chorus of courts cited above and recognize that \ntransgender individuals constitute a quasi-suspect class. To determine whether a group constitutes \na quasi-suspect class, the Supreme Court has analyzed whether the group: (1) has historically been \nsubjected to discrimination, see Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638 (analyzing โclose relativesโ in context of \nfederal benefits program); (2) has a defining characteristic that โfrequently bears no relation to \nability to perform or contribute to society,โ City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. \n432,  440-41  (1985)  (analyzing  persons  with  intellectual  disabilities  in  context  of  zoning \nordinance); (3) has โobvious, immutable, or distinguishing characteristics that define them as a \ndiscrete group,โ Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638; and (4) is a minority lacking political power, Bowen v. \nGilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602 (1987) (analyzing families receiving child-support payments from \nnon-custodial parents in context of federal benefits program). \nFirst, transgender individuals, as a class, have historically been subject to discrimination \nand continue to โface discrimination, harassment, and violence because of their gender identity.โ \nWhitaker, 858 F.3d at 1051 (recognizing transgender people as a quasi-suspect class); accord \nGrimm, 972 F.3d at 611-612 (citing to national survey showing that โ[t]ransgender people \nfrequently experience harassment in places such as schools (78%), medical settings (28%), and \nretail stores (37%),โ โexperience physical assault in places such as schools (35%) and places of \n15 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 61 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 06/09/23   Page 21 of 30\npublic accommodation (8%),โ and โare more likely to be the victim of violent crimesโ); Ray, 507 \nF. Supp. 3d at 937. \nSecond, no โdata or argument suggest[s] that a transgender person, simply by virtue of \ntransgender status, is any less productive than any other member of society.โ Adkins, 143 F. Supp. \n3d at 139; accord Grimm, 972 F.3d at 611-12; Ray, 507 F. Supp. 3d at 937; Highland, 208 F. Supp. \n3d at 874. The American Psychiatric Association has stated that โ[b]eing transgender or gender \ndiverse implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational \ncapabilities.โ33 \nThird, transgender individuals share โobvious, immutable, or distinguishing characteristics \nthat define them as a discrete group.โ See Bowen, 483 U.S. at 602 (quoting Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638). \nSpecifically, transgender individualsโ โgender identity does not align with the gender they were \nassigned  at  birth.โ  M.A.B,  286  F.  Supp.  at  721.  As  many  courts  have  recognized,  โbeing \ntransgender is not a choice. Rather, it is as natural and immutable as being cisgender.โ Grimm, 972 \nF.3d at 612-13; see also Ray, 507 F. Supp. 3d at 937; Highland, 208 F. Supp. 3d at 874 (quoting \nLyng, 477 U.S. at 638).34 \nFourth, people who are transgender lack political power. See Grimm, 972 F.3d at 613 \n(reviewing data on transgender population in the United States and representation in judicial, \nexecutive, and legislative branches, and finding that, โ[e]ven considering the low percentage of \nthe population that is transgender, transgender persons are underrepresented in every branch of \ngovernmentโ). While the number of openly transgender elected officials is growing, they still \nrepresent a small fraction of office-holders. Id.

See M.A.B., 286 F. Supp. \n3d at 721 (noting that courts have had to block numerous laws because they violated rights of \ntransgender individuals). \nBecause SB 613 discriminates against transgender persons, who constitute a quasi-suspect \nclass, the statute is subject to intermediate scrutiny. \nII.  SB 613โs Ban on Gender-Affirming Care Cannot Survive Intermediate Scrutiny. \n \nTo withstand intermediate scrutiny, the government actor must show that the challenged \naction โserves important governmental objectivesโ and that the โdiscriminatory means employed \nare substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.โ United States v. Virginia, 518 \nU.S. 515, 524 (1996) (โVMIโ) (requiring an โexceedingly persuasive justificationโ for a sex-based \nclassification) (quoting Miss. Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 724 (1982)); Craig v. \nBoren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 (1976) (โTo withstand constitutional challenge, previous cases establish \nthat  classifications  by  gender  must  serve  important  governmental  objectives  and  must  be \nsubstantially  related  to  achievement  of  those  objectives.โ).  โThe  burden  of  justification  is \ndemanding and it rests entirely on the State.โ VMI, 518 U.S. at 533. The intermediate scrutiny \ninquiry provides an enhanced measure of protection in circumstances where there is a greater \ndanger that a legal classification results from impermissible prejudice or stereotypes. See City of \nRichmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493 (1989) (plurality opinion). \nMoreover, where intermediate scrutiny applies, the โjustification must be genuine, not \nhypothesized or invented post hoc in response to litigation,โ and it โmust not rely on overbroad \n17 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 61 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 06/09/23   Page 23 of 30\ngeneralizations.โ VMI, 518 U.S. at 533.35 A classification does not withstand intermediate scrutiny \nwhen โthe alleged objectiveโ of the classification differs from the โactual purpose.โ Miss. Univ. \nfor Women, 458 U.S. at 730. โ[A] desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot constitute a \nlegitimate governmental interest.โ U.S. Depโt of Agric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534 (1973); see \nalso Ladapo, 2023 WL 3833848, at *11 (referring to Floridaโs โpurported justificationsโ for the \nstateโs  ban  on  gender-affirming  care,  including  alleged  risks  of  certain  care,  as  โlargely \npretextualโ). \nSB 613โs ban on medically necessary gender-affirming care for transgender youth cannot \nsurvive intermediate scrutiny for two reasons. First, even assuming the Stateโs asserted interest of \nprotecting youth is genuine, SB 613 is not substantially related to that interest because banning \nwell-established, medically necessary, gender-affirming care is harmful, not beneficial. Second, \nthe stated objective of protecting youth from dangerous treatments does not appear to be fully \nโgenuine,โ see VMI, 518 U.S. at 533, and appears instead to be a โlargely pretextualโ justification, \nsee Ladapo, 2023 WL 3833848, at *11, lacking accurate scientific or medical basis. Legislative \nhistory suggests that Oklahomaโs passage of SB 613 reflected a desire to express moral disapproval \nof transgender individuals, โa politically unpopular group,โ see Moreno, 413 U.S. at 534โan \ninterest that is not โlegitimate,โ see id., let alone important or exceedingly persuasive. \nA.  SB 613 is Not Substantially Related to Oklahomaโs Purported Interest of Protecting \nYouth. \n \nEven if lawmakersโ asserted interest of protecting youth were genuine, SB 613โs ban on \ntransgender youth receiving certain forms of medically necessary gender-affirming care is not \n \n35 See also Glenn, 663 F.3d at 1321; SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Abbott Labs., 740 F.3d 471, \n482 (9th Cir. 2014) (โ[The court] must examine [the lawโs] actual purposes and carefully consider \nthe resulting inequality to ensure that our most fundamental institutions neither send nor reinforce \nmessages of stigma or second-class status.โ). \n18 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 61 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 06/09/23   Page 24 of 30\nโsubstantially relatedโ to achieving that objective. See VMI, 518 U.S. at 533. Instead, banning \nthese forms of gender-affirming care will have devastating effects on many transgender children \nwhile providing no countervailing benefit to them or anyone else. See Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 609 \nF.2d 727, 734 (5th Cir. 1979) (courts must โweigh[] the state interest sought to be furthered against \nthe character of the discrimination caused by the statutory classificationโ). \nFirst, it is well-established that the provision of gender-affirming care to treat gender \ndysphoria is helpful, not harmful, to transgender youth. Contrary to the Stateโs asserted position \nthat gender-affirming  care for transgender  youth  is  โvery dangerous,โ  every major medical \nassociation, including the AAP, the American Psychiatric Association, the Endocrine Society, and \nWPATH, has recognized that gender-affirming care is safe, effective, and medically necessary \ntreatment for the health and wellbeing of some youth diagnosed with gender dysphoria.36 In fact, \nthe medical evidence shows that trying to โcureโ a person with a diagnosis of gender dysphoria by \nforcing them to live in alignment with the personโs sex assigned at birth is severely harmful and \nineffective.37 Transgender minors who do not receive gender-affirming care face increased rates \nof victimization, substance abuse, depression, anxiety, and suicidality.38 The medical community \noverwhelmingly agrees that gender-affirming care is medically necessary for some transgender \nyouth.39 \n \n36 Adkins Decl. ยถยถ 29, 47-51; Antommaria ยถ 61; Janssen Decl. ยถยถ 24, 53. \n37 Janssen Decl. ยถยถ 28, 35-36; Turban Decl. ยถ 20. \n38 See Jack L.

Contrary to lawmakersโ assertions, gender-\naffirming  medical  treatment  for  patients  diagnosed  with  gender  dysphoria  is  far  from \nโexperimentalโ or โunsettledโ in nature, and, instead, has long been recognized as part of the \nstandards of care.40 According to the American Medical Association, โ[e]very major medical \nassociation in the United States recognizes the medical necessity of transition-related care for \nimproving the physical and mental health of transgender people,โ which โmay include mental \nhealth  counseling,  non-medical  social  transition,  gender-affirming  hormone  therapy,  and/or \ngender-affirming surgeries.โ41 Clinicians have used these standards of care, which are peer-\nreviewed and based on reviews of scientific literature, for decades.42 Puberty blockers have been \nused in the United States to treat gender dysphoria for approximately twenty years, and for several \ndecades to treat medical conditions such as precocious puberty, a condition in which a child enters \npuberty at a young age.43 \n \nPractice in Pediatric Psychology 302 (2019); see also Adkins Decl. ยถ 29; Janssen Decl. ยถ 48, 62, \n81. \n40 E.g., Antommaria Decl. ยถ 29. \n41 James L.

The carve-out for intersex minors further attenuates any connection between \nthe law and Oklahomaโs purported concern about the health risks to youth. See ยง 1(A)(2)(b)(4). \nThis underscores the mismatch between the โalleged objectiveโ and โactual purposeโ of SB 613. \nSee Miss. Univ. for Women, 458 U.S. at 730. \nSB 613 prevents transgender minors diagnosed with gender dysphoria from receiving care \nthat their physicians and parents agree is appropriate and medically necessary. Therefore, it simply \ndoes not substantially relate to the legislatureโs asserted interest in protecting youth. For these \nreasons, SB 613 fails intermediate scrutiny. \nB.  The Claimed Interest of Protecting Youth is Not โGenuineโ and is Instead Pretextual. \n \nThe medical evidence cited above, in conjunction with SB 613โs text and legislative \nhistory, suggest that Oklahomaโs claimed interest is not fully โgenuine,โ VMI, 518 U.S. at 533, but \nrather a pretext for discrimination. Under any level of scrutiny, a challenged statute cannot \nโimpos[e] a broad and undifferentiated disability on a single named group.โ Romer v. Evans, 517 \nU.S. 620, 632 (1996). Evidence of a motivating purpose for a challenged statute or government \naction may be reflected in lawmakersโ contemporaneous statements and the historical context \nsurrounding the action. See Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, \n268 (1977); see also Depโt of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1915 \n(2020) (applying Arlington Heights factors to assess equal protection animus claim). \nAs noted above, an overwhelming body of medical evidence undermines the claim that \ngender-affirming care is โvery dangerous,โ such that Oklahoma needs to โprotectโ its youth from \nreceiving such care. Rather, this is a pretextual justification lacking accurate scientific or medical \n21 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 61 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 06/09/23   Page 27 of 30\nbasis that ultimately harmsโnot helpsโthe minors it purports to protect. Indeed, even a co-\nsponsor of the bill, when asked about the support of โall major medical associationsโ for these \nallegedly dangerous treatments, conceded that supporters of the bill were not โsaying that [these \ndoctors] are wrong.โ44  \nAs to SB 613โs text, the statute expressly applies only to those minors whose gender \nidentity differs from their sex assigned at birth. And by limiting the receipt of specified forms of \nhealth care only to those minors whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth, SB \n613 imposes โa broad and undifferentiated disability on a single named group.โ See Romer, 517 \nU.S. at 620. Despite the absence of the word โtransgenderโ in the statute, SB 613โs passage indeed \nโseems inexplicable by anything but animus towardโ transgender people. See id.  \nAs  to  legislative  history,  legislatorsโ  remarks  about  SB  613  and  transgender  people \nreinforce the pretextual nature of the supposed goals of SB 613. See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. \nat 268 (noting that โcontemporary statements by members of the decisionmaking bodyโ may be \nโhighly relevantโ in discerning legislative purpose). Moral disapproval appears throughout the \nlegislative record. During discussion of SB 613, lawmakers referred to transgender people as \nleading lives of โdegeneracyโ and โdelusion.โ45 The statement that transgender individuals need \nโwise and clear biblical guidanceโ further reflects this moral disapproval.46 As the Ladapo court \nrecognized, these types of statements are evidence of โsubstantial bigotry directed at transgender \nindividuals.โ  2023 WL 3833848, at  *11 & n.62 (observing that legislatorโs comments that \ntransgender individuals who spoke at a hearing were โmutants,โ that โGod created men, male and \nwomen, female,โ and that these individuals are โdemons and impsโ who โpretend [to be] part of \n \n44 See note 30. \n45 See note 24. \n46 See note 25; see also Compl. ยถยถ 102, 107, 111-13 (other similar statements by legislators).  \n22 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 61 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 06/09/23   Page 28 of 30\nthis worldโ constitute โbigotry directed at transgender individualsโ). And SB 613 was enacted \nagainst a backdrop of multiple proposed bills specifically targeting transgender individuals, further \nreinforcing the statuteโs true discriminatory purpose. See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 267 (โThe \nspecific sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision also may shed some light on the \ndecisionmakerโs purposes.โ).  \nโPrivate biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or \nindirectly, give them effect.โ Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 433 (1984).  Oklahomaโs passage \nof SB 613 appears to do just that.  Though purportedly meant to โprotectโ youth, SB 613 in fact \nprevents transgender minors diagnosed with gender dysphoria from receiving care that their \nphysicians and parents agree is appropriate and medically necessary. Therefore, it does not \nsubstantially  achieve  the  legislatureโs  asserted  interest  in  protecting  youth.  SB  613  fails \nintermediate scrutiny.47 \nCONCLUSION \n  SB 613 bans certain forms of medically necessary care for transgender minors, while \nleaving non-transgender minors free to receive the same procedures and treatments. The law fails \nintermediate scrutiny because banning medically necessary care to treat gender dysphoria is not \nsubstantially  related  to  serving  an  important  government  objective,  and  because  Oklahoma \nlawmakersโ asserted purposeโโprotectingโ minors from certain careโis pretextual. Instead, the \n \n47 Intermediate scrutiny applies in this case. But SB 613โs ban on gender-affirming medical care \nwould not survive even rational basis review because, for the reasons stated above, there is not a \nโrational  relationship  between  the  disparity  of  treatment  and  some  legitimate  governmental \npurpose.โ Heller v. Doe by Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 320 (1993). By restricting medically necessary \nhealth care only to transgender minors but allowing for the same care to be provided to non-\ntransgender minors, Oklahoma shows its hand: the purpose of SB 613 is not to โprotectโ youth, \nbut rather to deprive transgender minors of medically necessary care. A law motivated by prejudice \ntowards a particular group and bearing no rational relationship to the lawโs stated purpose cannot \nsurvive even the lowest level of review. See Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 450; Moreno, 413 U.S. at 534. \n23 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00177-JFH-SH   Document 61 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 06/09/23   Page 29 of 30\nlaw expresses Oklahoma lawmakersโ moral disapproval of transgender people, endangers the \nhealth of transgender youth, blocks parents and health care providers from making individual \ndeterminations regarding the appropriate care of transgender children, and threatens health care \nproviders with criminal and civil liability, as well as professional licensing sanctions, simply for \ntreating minor transgender patients consistent with broadly accepted standards of medical care. SB \n613 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and Plaintiffs are likely \nto succeed on the merits of their equal protection claim. \n \nDated: June 9, 2023  Respectfully submitted, \n   \nCLINTON J.
