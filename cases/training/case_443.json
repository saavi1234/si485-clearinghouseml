    "summary": "<p>On February 23, 1976, six residents of Forest Haven, an institution operated by the District of Columbia for developmentally disabled persons, filed this lawsuit against the District's mayor and its Department of Human Resources. The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia under the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (42 U.S.C. § 6001 et seq.); and 32 D.C. Code § 601 et seq. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought declaratory, injunctive, and equitable relief on behalf of past and present residents of Forest Haven who would benefit from individual treatment and educational programs appropriate to their needs. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that Forest Haven had not provided a level of habilitation consistent with the Constitution by failing to supply a setting that was the least restrictive of the residents' personal liberty.</p><p>Shortly after the filing of the complaint, the United States was granted its motion to intervene as plaintiffs. Evans v. Washington, 459 F. Supp. 483 (D.D.C. 1978). Also, on June 3, 1976, the court (Judge John H. Pratt) granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. Evans v. Williams, 139 F. Supp. 2d 79, 84 (D.D.C. 2001).</p><p>On June 14, 1978, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment. Evans v. Washington, 459 F. Supp. 483, 484 (D.D.C. 1978). The court held that the District had violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which provided the plaintiff class with a constitutional right to habilitative care and treatment. Id. It then entered a decree governing virtually every aspect of the District's operation of Forest Haven. Id.; see also In re U.S., 925 F.2d 490, 1991 WL 17225, *1 (D.C. Cir. 1991). At its core, the decree required the deinstitutionalization of the residents and their placement in \"community living arrangement[s] . . . together with such community-based day programs and services as are necessary to provide the resident[s] with minimally adequate habilitation.\" Evans v. Washington, 459 F. Supp. 483, 487 (D.D.C. 1978). In other words, for all intents and purposes, the judgment called for the closing of Forest Haven. Id.; see also Evans v. Williams, 206 F.3d 1292, 1293 (D.C. Cir. 2000). The judgment also required that the defendants, inter alia, draft an individualized habilitation plan for each resident as well as create and maintain procedures to monitor the defendant's compliance with the injunction. Evans v. Washington, 459 F. Supp. 483, 484, 486 (D. D.C., 1978). In 1981 and 1983, the district court entered additional consent orders reaffirming its 1978 order and further mandating the placement of all Forest Haven residents in community living arrangements by the end of fiscal year 1988. In re United States, 925 F.2d 490, 1991 WL 17225, *1 (D.C. Cir. 1991).</p><p>The Forest Haven facility was permanently closed in the late 1980s, but the case has remained open and continually active, as disputes regarding the execution of the consent orders and the alleged ongoing failure of the District of Columbia to provide adequate care in an integrated, least restrictive setting.  On October 11, 1996, the Court appointed a Special Master, Margaret G. Farrell, to monitor and report on the District's compliance and to make recommendations to the court.</p><p>On March 14, 1999, The Washington Post ran an article characterizing the District's efforts to provide safe community-integrated group homes in a least-restrictive setting as having \"fail[ed] completely.\" The article describes one of the group homes into which Forest Haven residents had been transferred as \"roach-dappled,\" with broken furniture and doors hanging off their hinges, and where at least one resident known to be a sexual predator was roomed next door to one of his victims. (<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/daily/march99/grouphome14.htm\">Washington Post, March 14, 1999</a>).</p><p>On January 30, 2001, Clarence J. Sundram was appointed co-Special Master.</p><p>On March 30, 2001, the court (Judge Stanley S. Harris), pursuant to the recommendation of the Special Master in her \"2001 Plan for Complainance and Conclusion of Evans v. Williams,\" entered a fourth consent order, in which the defendants agreed to create a nonprofit agency to, inter alia, provide independent monitoring of the services available to individuals with intellectual disabilities and developmental disabilities.  The defendants agreed to fund this agency by paying $31.5 million over eleven years, and again made extensive commitments to improve its practices and the services and living conditions available to mentally disabled citizens of the District of Columbia. Evans v. Williams, 139 F.Supp.2d 79, 83 (D. D.C. 2001). </p><p>On March 30, 2007, the Court found that there had been \"systemic, continuous, and serious noncompliance with many of the Court's Orders,\" and held the District of Columbia to be in noncompliance. Evans v. Fenty, 480, F.Supp.2d 280, 325 (D.D.C.2007). The court again had the Special Master produce a report, 2009 Special Masters' Report, in which the Special Master also found the District in non-compliance, and recommended the appointment of an \"Independent Compliance Administrator,\" who would bring the District into compliance. </p><p>On April 7, 2010, the Court Issued an Memorandum Opinion, detailing extensively the prior history of the litigation and the various consent orders up until that point, and denying a motion by the District of Columbia to have the existing consent orders vacated and to have the case closed. Evans v. Fenty, 701 F.Supp.2d 126 (D.D.C. 2010). This was appealed, and the appeal was dismissed. 2010 WL 3447241 (D.C. Cir. 2010).</p><p>On June 1, 2010, the Court adopted the 2009 Special Masters' Report's findings of fact and conclusions of law Evans v. Fenty, 714 F.Supp.2d 116 (D.D.C 2010). As a result of this decision, the Court approved on August 10, 2010, the Special Master's \"2010 Revision to the 2001 Plan for Compliance and Conclusion of Evans v. Fenty.\"</p><p>On October 26, 2012, the court issued an order approving and adopting the Special Master's conclusion that the District of Columbia had achieved compliance in several areas, including the safe guarding of class member's person possessions, and some aspects of staff training. Evans v. Gray, 2012 WL 5305790, (D.D.C. 2012). </p><p>From 2013-2015, the court approved in full the reports and recommendations of the Special Master regarding various aspects of the consent decrees. These areas included protection from harm, vocational, residential, and day programs, as well as many other areas.  See the documents for this case for a complete list. </p><p>On March 31, 2015, the court (Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle) approved and adopted in part the Special Master's report and recommendation regarding individualized habilitation plans.  The court held that: 1) altering the 90% threshold for “high” compliance was unwarranted; 2) the defendants had complied with the occupational therapy services component of outcome criterion focused on implementation; but 3) the defendants failed to demonstrate compliance with the medical services component of outcome criterion focused on implementation; and 4) the defendants failed to demonstrate compliance with the criteria requiring assessment of residents' needs for services and mandating provision of certain adaptive equipment.  87 F. Supp. 3d 1 (D.D.C. 2015)</p><p>On May 10, 2017, the court terminated the case after compliance was achieved.</p><p>Note: Among the several awards of attorneys' fees and costs to the Plaintiffs was a consent order and judgment, filed on May 16, 2011, wherein the court approved an award of $4,000,000, covering fees and costs from April 1, 2006, to June 30, 2010. Because of the age of the case and because the court docket is incomplete, the Clearinghouse has not attempted to calculate the total amount of attorneys' fees awarded.</p>",

Defendants are the District of Columbia (\"the\n281 District\") and the Honorable Adrian Fenty, the City's Mayor.[1] The United States *281 is also a party, having been\n[2]\npermitted to intervene as a plaintiff in January 1977.\nAs described in greater detail below, this litigation has resulted in a series of consent orders and remedial plans\nin which defendants have admitted that class members' constitutional rights have been violated and have agreed\nto take actions necessary to remedy these constitutional violations. Because these measures have been\nunsuccessful in achieving desired outcomes for class members in many critical areas, the litigation has also\nresulted in a series of efforts by plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor to force compliance with the Court's orders\nthrough motions for contempt and other relief. Before the Court is the latest such effort. Plaintiffs have moved for\nan order finding defendants in noncompliance with the prior Court orders and placing the District's Mental\n[3]\nRetardation and Developmental Disabilities Administration (\"MRDDA\") into receivership.  At a July 20, 2006,\nstatus conference, the Court bifurcated proceedings on the motion into a liability and a remedy phase and\ndirected the parties to submit proposed findings of fact on the liability question, i.e., whether there has been\n[4]\nsubstantial noncompliance with Court orders. (July 20, 2006 Hr'g Tr. at 6, 9-10.)  This Memorandum Opinion\nsets forth the Court's factual findings on that issue.\nBACKGROUND\nThis case began in February 1976, when a group of individual plaintiffs filed suit alleging that they and other\nresidents of Forest Haven were not receiving \"a constitutionally minimal level of habilitation\" (Compl. ¶ 1) and\n[5]\nseeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The Honorable John H. Pratt, who presided over this case until his\ndeath in August 1995, certified a plaintiff class consisting of present, former, and future residents of Forest Haven\nin June 1976. Following a period of discovery, plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of\n\nliability in November 1977. Plaintiffs urged the Court to require defendants to \"undertake a phased Court\n282 supervised planning process for remedying the statutory and constitutional *282 violations.\" (Mem. of Law in\nSupport of Pls.' Mot. for Partial S.J. at 52.) Although defendants objected to plaintiffs' characterization of the\nconditions at Forest Haven, noting that changes had been implemented following the filing of plaintiffs' lawsuit,\ndefendants acknowledged that \"the level of care and habilitation at Forest Haven has never been that which any\nof the parties to this action desire.\" (Defs.' Opp'n to Pls.' Mot. for Partial S.J. at 2.) Defendants urged the Court to\ndeny the motion and instead to direct counsel for the parties to enter into discussions as to \"what further actions\ncan and should be done . . . to better provide for the mentally retarded at Forest Haven.\" (Id. at 1, 4.)\nI. The 1978 Consent Order\nOn June 14, 1978, Judge Pratt entered a \"Final Judgment and Order\" (the \"1978 Consent Order\" or the \"1978\nOrder\"), which was consented to by defendants. Evans v. Washington, 459 F.Supp. 483 (D.D.C.1978). The Court\nfound that plaintiffs have a federal constitutional right to habilitative care and treatment, to be free from harm, and\nto receive habilitative care and treatment in the alternative least restrictive of individual liberty and to be kept free\n[6]\nfrom harm. Id. at 484.  The Court went on to find that violations of these constitutional rights had occurred and\nordered extensive permanent injunctive relief, requiring defendants to deinstitutionalize class members and\nimposing a series of requirements governing virtually all aspects of the District's interim operation of Forest\nHaven. Id. at 484-90.\nWith respect to deinstitutionalization, the Court prohibited any further admissions to Forest Haven and ordered\ndefendants to provide all class members with suitable community living arrangements and with the community-\nbased day programs and services necessary to provide them with minimally adequate habilitation in the most\n[7]\nintegrated and least restrictive community settings. Id. at 484-85, 488.  The Court also ordered defendants, \ninter alia, to provide each class member with a written individualized habilitation plan and an individualized\nhabilitation program designed in accordance with the plan; to retain a full-time \"Developmental Disabilities\nprofessional\" (later referred to as the \"Court Monitor\") to assist defendants and the Court in implementing the\nConsent Order, including reporting to the Court at ninety-day intervals regarding the status and progress of\ndefendants' efforts to do so; and, in conjunction with the Court Monitor, to develop and submit for court approval\na detailed implementation plan for the provision of community living arrangements, programs, and services. Id. at\n484-87.\nWith respect to Forest Haven, the Court ordered defendants, again in conjunction with the Court Monitor, to\nprepare a plan for the interim operation of the facility pending the placement of class members in community\n283 living arrangements and set out a series of requirements for the facility's *283 continued operation. Id. at 488-89.\nAmong other things, the Court prohibited all \"[a]cts of physical or psychological abuse, neglect or mistreatment of\nany Forest Haven resident,\" required the prompt investigation of all such incidents, and required \"[a] program of\nmedical, dental and health related services for class members which provides accessibility, quality and continuity\nof care for physical illness or injury.\" Id.\nII. The 1981 and 1983 Consent Orders\nIn January 1981, plaintiff and plaintiff-intervenor filed motions for contempt and for enforcement of the Court's\nJune 1978 Consent Order. The motions were ultimately withdrawn, and the Court entered a further Consent\nOrder on June 25, 1981 (the \"1981 Consent Order\" or the \"1981 Order\"), setting forth a list of agreed-upon\nmeasures \"necessary to the implementation of this Court's Order of June 14, 1978.\" Evans v. Barry, No. 76-293,\n[8]\nConsent Order at 1 (D.D.C. June 25, 1981).  The 1981 Consent Order reaffirmed defendants' obligations under\nthe 1978 Order and imposed a series of further requirements with respect to staffing and staff training at Forest\nHaven; the provision of individualized assessments and habilitation plans to all class members, including the\nidentification of all services required by class members regardless of the current availability of those services;\nprocurement of necessary supplies and performance of routine maintenance and repairs required for class\nmembers' health, safety, and sanitation; outplacement of class members from Forest Haven with appropriate day\nprograms and living arrangements and with adequate case management support; funding for class members;\nand the timely processing of contracts. See generally id.\n\nPlaintiff and plaintiff-intervenor again filed contempt motions in June 1982 that resulted in the entry of a further\nConsent Order on February 8, 1983 (the \"1983 Consent Order\" or the \"1983 Order\"). See Evans, Consent Order\nat 14 (Feb. 8, 1983). The 1983 Order again affirmed defendants' obligations under the earlier Consent Orders\nand required defendants to take certain additional steps to implement those Orders. See generally id. The 1983\nOrder required defendants to ensure that periodic assessments were conducted and that individual habilitation\nplans were developed for all class members; to prepare an assessment of services required by class members;\nto address certain budget and staffing issues, including maintenance of the appropriate case manager to class\n[9]\nmember ratio;  and to properly maintain the facilities at Forest Haven. Id. at 2-9. The Order also imposed\nrequirements with respect to the reporting of \"unusual incidents\" involving class members; safekeeping of class\nmembers' funds; programming; and outplacement of class members, including the requirement that all residents\nof Forest Haven be placed in community settings by the end of Fiscal Year 1988. Id. at 8-14.\nIII. Closure of Forest Haven\nWhen defendants failed to meet the 1983 Consent Order's September 30, 1988 deadline for the outplacement of\n284 all class members, plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor *284 again initiated contempt proceedings in July 1989. The\nCourt did not immediately grant the motion to show cause but instead continued the matter for 120 days to give\nthe parties time to agree to a further consent decree. (Sept. 29, 1989 Hr'g Tr. at 2.) The parties did not agree,\nhowever, and after a January 1990 hearing, the Court issued an Order holding the District in civil contempt,\nobserving that it had \"no alternative except to find that the District of Columbia has been in consistent and\ncontinuing violation of the three Consent Orders [of 1978, 1981 and 1983].\" Evans, Order (Jan. 30, 1990). The\nCourt held a sanctions hearing in March 1990 and issued a further Order imposing a schedule for outplacement\nof the remaining 233 residents of Forest Haven that required all residents to be outplaced by September 30,\n1991, and providing for the imposition of fines in the event that defendants failed to meet quarterly outplacement\nquotas. Evans, Order (Apr. 9, 1990).\nIn July 1990, while outplacement of the remaining Forest Haven residents pursuant to the Court's April 1990\nOrder was underway, plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor again moved for civil contempt sanctions and damages\n[10]\nbased on the conditions at Forest Haven.  The Court denied the motion in May 1991, finding that the level of\nmedical care at Forest Haven, while imperfect, was adequate to meet the needs of the declining population there,\nEvans, Mem. Op. & Order at 6 (May 15, 1991), and the D.C. Circuit affirmed. Evans v. Kelly, No. 91-5237, 1992\n[11]\nWL 337321, at *1 (D.C.Cir. Nov.1992).\nOutplacement of all remaining residents was completed in October 1991.\nIV. Appointment of Special Master\nPlaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor next initiated contempt proceedings in March 1995, filing motions for contempt,\ncontempt sanctions, appointment of a special master, and emergency injunctive relief based on defendants'\nnonpayment of providers of residential and day programming services, failure to maintain the required case\nmanager to class member ratio of one to sixty, mismanagement of class members' personal funds, and\n[12]\nnonpayment of the Court Monitor.  The Court issued an Order to Show Cause in April 1995, finding the District\nto be in violation of the three previously-issued Consent Orders, particularly with respect to the payment of care\n285 providers, but suspended further contempt *285 proceedings and consideration of the requests for emergency\nrelief to afford the parties an opportunity to devise a viable plan to bring the District into compliance. Evans, Order\nto Show Cause at 4 (Apr. 21, 1995). Negotiations between the parties proved unsuccessful, and at a May 1995\nhearing, the Court found the District to be in contempt. See Evans, Findings of Fact & Conclusions of Law at 2\n(Oct. 11, 1995).\nIn October 1995, the Honorable Stanley S. Harris, to whom the case was reassigned upon Judge Pratt's death,\nissued formal Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and an Order of Reference. The Court found the District\nto be in contempt of the prior Consent Orders in three material respects: (1) by being substantially in arrears on\nundisputed payments to care providers; (2) by failing to maintain the required case manager to class member\nratio; and (3) by failing to provide all class members with \"community living arrangements suitable to each, in the\n\nleast separate, most integrated and least restrictive community settings, and to provide all class members with\nsuch community-based day programs and services as are necessary to provide them with minimally adequate\n[13]\nhabilitation.\" Id. at 7-8.  Based on the defendants' long history of noncompliance, the Court determined that\nthe appointment of a Special Master was necessary. Evans, Order of Reference at 1-2 (Oct. 11, 1995). The Court\nappointed Margaret G. Farrell to serve in that capacity and ordered the Special Master to work with the parties to\ndevelop and submit a remedial plan through which defendants could purge themselves of the Court's contempt\nfindings. Id. at 2-3.\nThe Special Master submitted a remedial plan in January 1996, and in August of that year, the Court issued an\nOrder adopting the plan and the Special Master's proposed findings of fact that accompanied it. Evans v. Barry,\nNo. 76-293, 1996 WL 451054, at *1-2 (D.D.C. Aug.2, 1996) (the \"1996 Plan\"). The Court-ordered 1996 Plan\nimposed a series of further requirements with respect to the timely payment of care providers, negotiation of long-\nterm provider contracts, maintenance of the required case management ratio, and implementation of class\n[14]\nmembers' individual habilitation plans. Id. at *3-8. The 1996 Plan also provided for imposition of coercive civil\nfines in the event that defendants failed to meet the Plan's requirements 00 fines that the Court determined were\n97\nnecessary in light of defendants'\"unrelenting contempt\" of the Court's prior Consent Orders and \"seeming inability\n[15]\nto bring themselves into compliance therewith.\" Id. at *2-8.\n286 *286 V. The 2001 Plan\nIn February 1999, as part of its decision imposing contempt fines, Judge Harris also amended the 1996 Plan to\norder the Special Master to work with the parties to develop and, recommend to the Court a plan for the\nconclusion of the litigation and the termination of the Court's jurisdiction in a manner that would ensure that\nplaintiffs' interests would continue to be protected. Evans, Op. at 18-20 (Feb. 10, 1999). Pursuant to the Court's\nOrder, under the direction of Special Master Farrell, and with the assistance of her then-consultant Clarence L.\n[16]\nSundram,  the parties engaged in lengthy negotiations that resulted in a series of agreements intended to\nachieve compliance with the prior Court Orders, to provide for permanent and independent mechanisms to\nsafeguard the rights of class members, and to permit the phased withdrawal of judicial oversight as compliance\nwith the Court Orders was achieved. See Evans v. Williams, 139 F.Supp.2d 79, 81 (D.D.C.2001). In particular, the\nparties agreed to and submitted for Court approval: (1) a set of joint stipulated findings of fact regarding the\nstatus of defendants' compliance with the outstanding Court Orders; (2) the \"2001 Plan for Compliance and\nConclusion of Evans v. Williams\" (the \"2001 Plan\" or the \"Plan\"); and (3) a Consent Order and accompanying\nsettlement agreement regarding the creation of an external monitoring body to protect the interests of class\nmembers and other MRDDA consumers after the end of the case. In March 2001, Judge Harris issued an\n[17]\nOpinion and Order approving these agreements. Id. at 85.\nThe parties' stipulated findings of fact, which the Court adopted, painted a bleak picture as to defendants' record\nof noncompliance. The findings acknowledged that there had been a \"serious breakdown\" in the District's system\nof support for individuals with developmental disabilities and that the system, which had suffered from years of\nneglect and mismanagement, \"urgently need[ed] to be fixed.\" Evans, 139 F.Supp.2d at 96-97; see also, e.g., id.\nat 98 (noting that District's mental retardation and developmental delivery system was \"broken\" and needed to be\n\"redefined and rebuilt\"). The findings noted that defendants' compliance with the prior Court Orders had\n287 deteriorated following the closure *287 of Forest Haven in 1991 and that defendants were not complying with\nmany of the requirements of those Orders. Id at 98. The findings also identified numerous \"fundamental\nproblems,\" including problems with respect to staffing, staff training, and monitoring; management; reporting of\nand response to unusual incidents; safeguarding of class members' funds; the budgeting process; and the\nDistrict's Medicaid Home and Community 00 Based Services waiver. See id. at 98-107.\n97\nIntended to remedy these deficiencies and to provide a means for defendants to come into compliance with the\noutstanding Court Orders, the 2001 Plan was organized thematically around the broad goals of those Orders.\nThe Plan identified the major goals (and sub-goals) of the Orders as follows:\n(1) appropriate individualized habilitation and treatment in the community in, the least separate,\nmost integrated and least restrictive settings, including (a) individualized habilitation plans, (b) the\n\nprovision of residential, vocational, and day services, (c) staff training, and (d) restricted control\nprocedures (including use of medication, restraints, and time out);\n(2) protection from harm;\n(3) safeguarding consumers' personal possessions;\n(4) monitoring, including, (a) case management, (b) quality assurance and fiscal audits, and (c)\nexternal monitoring;\n(5) advocacy for consumers;\n(6) adequate budget; and\n(7) timely payment of vendors.\nFor each of these goals (and sub-goals), the Plan went on to (a) identify the specific provisions of the existing\nCourt Orders that must be complied with; (b) identify the tasks necessary for defendants to meet the\nrequirements of the relevant Court Orders; (c) establish a time frame for implementation of the identified tasks;\n(d) identify specific outcome criteria for determining defendants', compliance with the relevant Court Orders; (e)\n[18]\nestablish a threshold standard of compliance that defendants must meet for the particular Court Orders;  and\n(f) establish a method for assessing compliance. Although the Plan was developed in the context of the Evans\ncase, it referred throughout to \"consumers\" rather than \"class members.\" This choice of words was intentional\nand reflected defendants'\"express[] agree[ment] not to create a bifurcated system of services for its citizens with\ndevelopmental disabilities\" but to \"provide the same level of services to class and nonclass members.\" (2001\nPlan at 5 n. 2.)\nThe Plan made clear that the measure of defendants' compliance with each group of underlying Court Orders\nwould be whether they had satisfied the specific outcome criteria relating to those Orders. (Id. at 7 (\"[W]hile it is\nthe intent of the parties to monitor the timely implementation of the specific tasks that have been identified as\nnecessary for implementation of the Court Orders in each section, the ultimate test of compliance will be in\nsatisfying all of the related outcome criteria.\") (emphasis in Plan); see also id. (\"[T]he Plan identifies specific\noutcome criteria for determining compliance with the related group of Court Orders.\").) The parties agreed that\n288 *288 if the Court finds that defendants have satisfied the outcome criteria, the defendants will also\nbe in compliance with the related Court Orders pursuant to this Plan, and the Court may vacate\nthe related Court Orders.\n(Id. at 7.) Although compliance with the Court Orders depended on defendants' satisfaction of the outcome\ncriteria rather than their completion of the tasks identified therein (see id.) (\"In the final analysis, it is compliance\nwith the specific outcome criteria that is required . . ., and the tasks identified are a means to this end.\"), the\nparties also agreed that \"[t]he failure of the defendants to implement the actions identified in the Plan as\nnecessary to meet the requirements of the related Court Orders is also evidence of noncompliance with those\nCourt Orders.\" (Id.)\nThe Plan contemplated that as defendants satisfied the outcome criteria for particular groups of Court Orders,\nthey would move the Court to have those Orders vacated and dismissed with the ultimate goal that, over time,\ndefendants would\nimplement all of the required actions and meet the specified outcome criteria in order to\nsuccessfully move, the Court to vacate and dismiss the related Court Orders, except the\ndeclaratory judgment on the constitutional rights of the consumers to receive individualized\nhabilitation in the least separate, most integrated and least restrictive environment and to be\nprotected from harm.\n(Id. at 9-10.) Although the Plan itself was \"not intended to be an enforceable document,\" the underlying Court\nOrders, until vacated and dismissed as provided for in the Plan, would \"continue to remain enforceable in federal\ncourt.\" (Id. at 10.) In particular, plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor \"retain[ed] the right to seek appropriate judicial\n\nrelief, based on this evidence of noncompliance with the Court Orders, including Orders requiring specific\nperformance of the Plan.\" (Id.)\nThe final section of the Plan, captioned \"Essential Systemic Conditions,\" addressed certain other actions to be\ntaken by defendants to assist the District in \"developing additional options for the costeffective implementation of\nthe goals of this action 00 namely, \"individualized services in the least restrictive environment to the persons\n97\nserved by the mental retardation and developmental disabilities service delivery system.\" (Id. at 62.) In particular,\nthe Plan addressed the need to amend the District's Medicaid waiver to expand the number of MRDDA\nconsumers served by the waiver and outlined a series of actions to be taken by District in order to achieve this\ngoal. (Id. at 62-64.) The Plan also set forth certain steps to be taken by the parties and the Special Master to\ndevelop and propose legislation to revise and update the existing statutes governing services and supports for\npersons with developmental disabilities to reflect contemporary approaches. (Id. at 64-65.)\nThe third component of the series of agreements approved by the Court in March 2001 concerned the creation of\nthe Quality Trust for Individuals with Disabilities, Inc. (the \"Quality Trust\"), a durable, independent, nonprofit\norganization to \"monitor and advance the individual and collective interests of people with developmental\ndisabilities in the District of Columbia's service delivery system.\" Evans, 139 F.Supp.2d at 86. In the Consent\nOrder, defendants agreed to endow and annually fund the Quality Trust with a total of 831.5 million over eleven\nyears in exchange for a waiver of all claims for past violations of Court's Orders, subject to certain exceptions. \n289 See id. at 85-90. The settlement agreement set forth in detail *289 the structure of the Quality Trust, the control\nand use of the funds to be provided by defendants, and the Trust's right of access to information. See id. at\n90-96. The settlement agreement also described the purpose and obligations of the Quality Trust, which was to\nbe charged with advancing the individual and collective interests of consumers with developmental disabilities\nand, in particular, Evans class members; monitoring the health, safety, and welfare of consumers and the\nprotections, services, and supports provided to these consumers; and providing for individual and collective legal\nservices and lay advocacy services for consumers. Id. at 92-95.\nVI. Post-2001 Plan Developments\nShortly after the 2001 Plan was approved, this case was reassigned to the undersigned upon the retirement of\nJudge Harris. Since that time, the Court has monitored defendants' progress in implementing the Plan through\nperiodic status hearings and through the Court Monitor's written quarterly reports.\nAlthough it quickly became apparent that compliance would not be achieved within the time frames set forth in\nthe Plan itself (see, e.g., April-June 2001 Monitor's Report at 1 (noting defendants' failure to comply with Plan's\ncompletion dates)); in the six years since the Plan's adoption, defendants have made progress in some respects.\nThe Quality Trust has been established, and defendants have endowed and funded the Trust, as required by\nboth the Plan (2001 Plan at 48) and the Consent Order that accompanied it. Evans, 139 F.Supp.2d at 87. An\nindependent financial review of the District's treatment of funds held in custody for class and nonclass members\nserved by MRDDA for the years 1992 to 2001 was completed, and in June 2004, defendants paid approximately\n$1.2 million to reimburse class members and other MRDDA consumers for amounts found to be owed to them as\na result of that review. (See Special Master's Report, Recommended Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\nand Proposed Order Regarding the Independent Financial Review of Consumers' Funds at 6-7; Evans, Order\n(Feb. 25, 2004); Defs.' Proposed Findings of Fact [\"Defs.' Findings\"] at 26.) Defendants have consistently\nmaintained the required ratio of at least one case manager for every thirty class members. (See 2001 Plan ¶¶\nD.1.b.2., D.1.d.iv.) Defendants have also developed policies and procedures required by the 2001 Plan and have\ncreated systems and structures intended to assist them in achieving the Plan's goals. For example, defendants\nhave established an Incident Management and Investigation Unit (\"IMIU\"), a quality assurance unit, a training\nunit, a Fatality Review Committee (\"FRC\"), and an intake process for the reporting of serious incidents.\nNotwithstanding these efforts, problems have persisted with respect to the implementation of defendants' policies\nand procedures and the effectiveness of defendants' systems and structures. Concerns have repeatedly been\nraised, for example, with respect to the performance of case managers and providers; the monitoring of health\nneeds and the delivery of health care services; investigations of class member deaths and other serious incidents\nand the implementation of recommended corrective and preventive actions; and the lack of progress in\nimplementing the Medicaid waiver. Significantly, not one of the underlying Court Orders has been vacated based\n\non a showing by defendants that they have satisfied the standard for compliance with the related outcome criteria\nunder the 2001 Plan.\n290 *290 In January 2004, recognizing that a lack of coordination among the District of Columbia agencies with\nresponsibility for actions necessary to achieve compliance with the 2001 Plan had impeded the timely completion\nof those actions, the Court ordered the Mayor to assign a Deputy Mayor or other senior official who reported\ndirectly to the Mayor to be responsible for the day-to-day efforts of District agencies to achieve compliance with\nthe Plan. Evans, Order at 1-2 (Jan. 21, 2004). The Court further ordered that the Deputy Mayor or other senior\nofficial be required to coordinate the efforts of all District agencies \"as necessary to secure the timely delivery of\n[19]\nappropriate services to class members in compliance with the 2001 Plan and previous [Court Orders],  and\nthat the official be required to report periodically to the Special Masters, the Court Monitor, and the Court. Id. at\n2-3. Since January 2004, several different individuals have served in this capacity, but as explained herein,\nbureaucratic bottlenecks still plague the defendants' ability to achieve results.\nIn the fall of 2005, the parties agreed to a time-limited initiative (the \"ninety-day plan\") to address some of the\nmore persistent concerns for a subset of class members in need of specialized attention. The ninety-day plan\nwas intended to produce specified improvements, over a period of ninety days, for a limited number of class\nmembers and, in the process, to identify and correct some of the systemic barriers that had impeded progress in\nthe past. (See Nov. 28, 2005 Hr'g Tr. at 6; Feb. 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 4.) In particular, defendants agreed:\n(1) to review, revise, and implement health care plans for forty-eight \"at-risk\" class members; (2) to move forty-six\nconsumers, including thirty class members, from unsafe and inappropriate residential programs into smaller,\n[20]\ncommunity-based housing;  and (3) to move forty-two class members out of segregated day programs and\ninto supported employment opportunities. (See Nov. 28, 2005 Hr'g Tr. at 6-8; Feb. 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 1,\n4; U.S. Ex. 6.) When defendants failed to make significant progress towards achieving these goals by the end of\nJanuary 2006, shortly before the ninety-day period was to expire, the Court directed the parties to negotiate a\nfurther Consent Order that would formalize defendants' obligations to address the short-term needs of the\nidentified at-risk class members. (See United States' Notice of the Parties' Failure to Agree at 1, 7-8.) The parties\nwere unable to reach agreement on such an order and so informed the Court in mid-February. (See id.; Pls.'\nEndorsement of United States' Notice; Def. Anthony Williams's Notice of Filing.) At the conclusion of the ninety-\nday period, defendants had made only three out of forty-six promised residential placements and only five out of\n291 forty-two promised *291 supported employment placements, two of which did not even meet the agreed-upon\ncriteria. (Feb. 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 1.) Moreover, although defendants made progress in identifying class\nmembers' health care needs, health interventions were not implemented for the forty-eight at-risk class members\nas promised. (Id.)\nVII. Current Procedural Posture\nDiscouraged by the failure of the ninety-day plan, as well as by the lack of progress under the 2001 Plan,\nplaintiffs filed the instant motion in May 2006, seeking an order finding defendants in noncompliance with the\noutstanding Court Orders and placing MRDDA into receivership. The United States, as plaintiff-intervenor, also\nfiled a motion for a finding of contempt. At a status conference on June 29, 2006, the Court ordered the parties to\nengage in settlement discussions with the goal of agreeing to structural changes that would survive the change in\nadministration at the end of the calendar year. (June 29, 2006 Hr'g Tr. at 27, 31.) See also Evans, Order at 1\n(June 29, 2006). The Court also directed the parties to establish a discovery schedule and ordered further\nbriefing in response to plaintiffs' argument that the Court need not decide the issue of contempt as a threshold\nmanner. Id. at 1-2.\nThe Court held a further status conference on July 20, 2006. Although settlement discussions during the\npreceding weeks had been unsuccessful, the Court encouraged the parties to continue their efforts to reach a\nsettlement. (July 20, 2006 Hr'g Tr. at 4.) With respect to the pending motions, the Court indicated that it would not\nproceed on plaintiff-intervenor's contempt motion, noting that contempt remedies would be ineffective in\n[21]\naddressing the kinds of problems that had been identified by the parties (see id. at 29),  and bifurcated\nproceedings on plaintiffs' receivership motion into a \"liability\" and a \"remedy\" phase. (Id. at 9.) In the \"liability\"\nphase, plaintiffs would be required to show that there had been \"systemic, continuous, serious noncompliance\"\n\nwith Court Orders. (Id. at 6-7, 9, 12.) Only upon a finding of liability would the Court reach the issue of what\nremedy or remedies should be imposed. (Id. at 9-10, 12.)\nThe Court directed plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor to submit proposed findings of fact and supporting evidence\non the issue of liability by August 7, 2006, and directed defendants to file any evidentiary objections to plaintiffs'\nand plaintiff-intervenor's evidence by August 14, 2006. Evans, Order at 1 (July 20, 2006). The parties agreed that\nall evidentiary objections would be resolved by Magistrate Judge John M. Facciola, and that Judge Facciola's\nrulings would be final. Id. (See also July 20, 2006 Hr'g Tr. at 22, 29, 34.) Defendants were directed to submit their\nproposed findings of fact by September 8, 2006, with evidentiary objections by plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor to\n292 be filed by *292 September 15, 2006, and with plaintiffs' and plaintiff-intervenor's reply to be filed by September\n[22]\n22, 2006. Evans, Order at 1-2 (July 20, 2006).\nThe Court informed the parties that they would be afforded an opportunity to take discovery, if they so desired,\npermitting each side a maximum of ten document requests and/or requests for admission, and indicating that\nadditional discovery would be permitted, if necessary, upon agreement of the parties and Magistrate Judge\nFacciola, following receipt of the opposing party's proposed findings of fact. Id. at 2. (See also July 20, 2006 Hr'g\nTr. 11, 16, 27-28, 38-40.) The Court set an evidentiary hearing on the liability phase of plaintiffs' receivership\nmotion for October 2, 2006, and directed the parties to file a joint status report in advance of the hearing to\nindicate what evidence, if any, each side intended to present. Evans, Order at 2 (July 20; 2006).\nAfter plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor submitted their proposed findings, of fact on liability, defendants objected\nthat given the volume of exhibits submitted and the short time-frame in which to make objections, it was\nimpossible for them to do anything more than object to categories of exhibits. (Defs.' Evidentiary Objections to\nPs.' and Pl.-Intervenor's Exs. in Support of Their Respective Proposed Findings of Fact [\"Defs.' Objections\"] at 2.)\nDefendants presented their specific evidentiary objections to plaintiffs' and plaintiff-intervenor's exhibits in chart\nform, listing each exhibit separately, indicating whether defendants objected to the exhibit and, if so, citing the\nparticular rule of evidence on which the objection was based. Defendants objected to the vast majority of the\nexhibits based on Rules 802, 402, 805, and 701-705. (See id. at 4-23.) Defendants also made a general hearsay\nobjection, particularly with respect to reports of investigations of class member deaths and serious incidents\ninvolving class members and certain quality assurance reports. (See id. at 3.) Analogizing such reports to reports\ngenerated in the medical peer review process, which are inadmissible in judicial and administrative proceedings\npursuant to D.C.Code § 44-805(a)(1), defendants argued that these reports should likewise be inadmissible in\norder to avoid chilling the self-improvement process. (See id. at 4.)\nOn August 30, 2006, Judge Facciola issued a Memorandum Order overruling defendants' objections. With\nrespect to defendants' relevance objections pursuant to Rule 402, Judge Facciola found that the exhibits were\n\"legitimately tendered in support of the proposed findings\" and were, therefore, \"unquestionably relevant.\" Evans,\n[23]\n238 F.R.D. 1, 2 (2006).  Judge Facciola also overruled defendants' objections based on Rules 701-705\n(concerning opinion testimony by lay witnesses and experts), noting that defendants had failed to identify the\nparticular portion or portions of the exhibit that they found objectionable. Id. at 2. As to defendants' hearsay\nobjections, Judge Facciola rejected defendants' argument based on D.C.Code § 44-805, finding the statute to be\ninapplicable and noting that defendants had not identified any applicable common law privilege. Id. at 2-3. Judge\nFacciola also found that the reports cited by plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor would be admissible as admissions\n293 of a party opponent *293 to the extent that they were created by the District or its agents and that, even if not\nadmissions, they might be admissible under Rule 803(8)(B) and (C). Id. at 2-3. Finally, Judge Facciola observed\nthat given the Court's years of reliance upon the reports, without objection by defendants, to assess defendants'\ncompliance with the Court Orders, defendants could not now argue that the reports should not be used in\ndetermining liability. Id. at 3. Although Judge Facciola overruled defendants' \"broad brush\" objections, which\nfailed to specify which sections of particular reports were objectionable, he gave defendants five days in which to\ncorrect this deficiency in a supplemental filing. Id. Defendants did not submit anything further with respect to their\nevidentiary objections.\nWhen defendants thereafter filed their proposed findings of fact on liability, neither plaintiffs nor plaintiff-intervenor\nsubmitted any evidentiary objections. Despite the opportunity to do so, no party chose to engage in discovery,\nand no party presented any testimony at the hearing on October 4, 2006. See Evans, Minute Order (D.D.C. Sept.\n\n20, 2006). Instead, the Court heard oral argument, from the parties. The Court also held a status conference the\nfollowing day, at which the Court heard from the Court Monitor and Kathy E. Sawyer, MRDDA's Interim\nAdministrator, as well as from counsel. At the Court's request, the Court Monitor filed a supplemental report on\nNovember 29, 2006, addressing the distribution of serious reportable incidents among providers. As is the\npractice in connection with the Court Monitor's regular quarterly reports, all parties had an opportunity to review\nand comment on the Monitor's supplemental report before the report was filed with the Court. (See Oct. 4, 2006\nHr'g Tr. at 31.)\nThe Court held a further status hearing on February 6, 2007. The day before that hearing, defendants submitted\na notice of filing to inform the Court of their disagreement with certain of the observations in the Court Monitor's\nJanuary 2007 quarterly report and to apprise the Court of progress they had made since the October 2006 status\nhearing. (Defs.' Notice of Filing of Supplemental Information in Response to the Court Monitor's Quarterly Report\n[\"Defs.' Notice of Filing\"] at 2.) The notice of filing, which was accompanied by affidavits from Ms. Sawyer and\nfrom Robert Maruca, the Senior Deputy Director for the Medical Assistance Administration (\"MAA\") of the\nDistrict's Department of Health, urged the Court to hold the motions in abeyance in light of the positive\ndevelopments and the Fenty administration's commitment to the District's newly-created Department of Disability\n[24]\nServices (\"DDS\")  and its consumers. (Id. at 10-11.) At the February 6th hearing, the Court rejected this\nrequest and indicated that it intended to issue a ruling based on the record as of November 29, 2006, when the\nCourt Monitor filed the supplemental report requested by the Court. (Feb. 6, 2007 Hr'g Tr. at 23-24.) But, as\n294 explained more fully herein, the extent of defendants' recent progress in *294 remedying its prior deficiencies will\nbe a critical consideration at the remedy phase.\nLEGAL ANALYSIS\nI. Legal Standard\nThe issue before the Court at this stage is liability: whether defendants have failed to comply, with the Court's\nprior Orders in this case. The Court advised the parties at the July 20, 2006 status conference of the standard by\nwhich defendants' liability would be assessed. Plaintiffs, as the moving party, must demonstrate that there has\nbeen systemic, continuous, and serious noncompliance with Court Orders. (July 20, 2006 Hr'g Tr. at 6-7, 9-10,\n12.) See also Dixon v. Barry, 967 F.Supp. 535, 541, 552-53 (D.D.C.1997) (imposing receivership based on\nfindings that District was \"substantially noncompliant with [prior Court Orders]\"); Gary W. v. Louisiana, No.\n74-2412, 1990 WL 17537, at *32-33 (E.D.La. Feb.26, 1990) (noting state's \"persistent[]\" inability to \"comply\nsubstantially\" with Court Orders and imposing receivership with respect to demonstrated areas of \"protracted\nnon-compliance\"); Newman v. Alabama, 466 F.Supp. 628, 630 (M.D.Ala.1979) (imposing receivership based on\nfindings that, in critical areas, state had not achieved substantial compliance with Court Orders).\nII. Violations of 2001 Plan as Evidence of Noncompliance With Court Orders\nThe 2001 Plan incorporates the relevant portions of the existing Court Orders and sets forth an agreed-upon\n[25]\nmeans by which defendants can come into compliance with those Orders.  The Plan provides that defendants'\nfailure \"to implement the actions identified in the Plan as necessary to meet the requirements of the related Court\nOrders is . . . evidence of noncompliance with those Court Orders.\" (2001 Plan at 7.) See also Evans, 139\nF.Supp.2d at 83. The Court is therefore required, as agreed to by the parties, to consider evidence that\ndefendants have failed to perform the \"tasks\" identified for each set of Court Orders as evidence that defendants\nhave not complied with those Orders.\nDefendants argue, however, that plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor cannot rely on defendants' failure to meet the\nassociated \"outcome criteria\" as further evidence of defendants' noncompliance. (Defs.' Findings at 2-3.)\nDefendants contend that the 2001 Plan and the Court Order approving it limit the manner in which the Plan may\nbe used as evidence of noncompliance with the related Orders, restricting plaintiffs to evidence regarding\ndefendants' failure to implement the \"tasks.\" (Id. at 2,) The \"outcome criteria,\" according to defendants, are\nrelevant only to the extent that defendants are seeking to exit from and terminate the related Court Orders. (Id. at\n3.)\n\nThe Court disagrees. Nothing in either the 2001 Plan or the Order approving it limits the evidence plaintiffs may\n295 rely on to show that defendants have failed to comply with the underlying Court Orders. *295 As noted, the Plan\nspecifies that defendants' failure \"to implement the actions identified in the Plan as necessary to meet the\nrequirements of the related Court Orders is also evidence of noncompliance with those, Court Orders.\" (2001\nPlan at 7 (emphasis added).) But this in no way suggests that only defendants' performance with respect to tasks\nmay be used as evidence of noncompliance. To the contrary, the use of the word \"also\" indicates that tasks are \nnot the only aspect of the Plan that may be used in this manner.\nIn the 2001 Plan, the parties agreed that the measure of defendants' compliance with a particular group of Court\nOrders would be whether defendants had satisfied the associated outcome criteria. (Id.) The Plan itself thus\nmakes defendants' performance with respect to the outcome criteria relevant to a determination as to whether\ndefendants have complied with the underlying Court Orders. See Evans, 139 F.Supp.2d at 82 (commenting that\nin the 2001 Plan, the parties agreed \"on the yardsticks to be utilized in making determinations of compliance\").\nDefendants note that the Plan \"is `not intended to be an independently enforceable document.'\" (Defs.' Findings\nat 2 (quoting Evans, 139 F.Supp.2d at 83); see also 2001 Plan at 10.) Until they are vacated, however, the\nunderlying Court Orders are enforceable. (Id.) See also Evans, 139 F.Supp.2d at 83. The outcome criteria reflect\nthe parties' agreement as to what the underlying Court Orders require, and the Court may therefore consider\ndefendants' performance with respect to the outcome criteria as evidence regarding defendants' compliance with\nthe underlying Orders. (See 2001 Plan at 10 (\"[I]n the event that the defendants do not implement the provisions\nof the Plan effectively and on a timely basis, plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor retain the right to seek appropriate\njudicial relief, based on this evidence of noncompliance with the Court Orders.\").)\nIt is also appropriate to consider defendants' performance with respect to the Plan's outcome criteria for purposes\nof the present motion because the outcome criteria are generally independently relevant to the associated Court\nOrders. For example, the 2001 Plan incorporates the requirement of the 1978 Consent Order that defendants\n\"provide a program of medical, dental and health related services for class members which provides accessibility,\nquality and continuity of care for physical illness or injury.\" (2001 Plan at 12 (citing 1978 Consent Order).) The\noutcome criteria associated with this Court Order, in turn, include the requirement that \"[m]edical and dental\nservices are being provided within professionally acceptable timeframes.\" (Id. ¶ A.1.d.iii.) Whether and to what\nextent class members are actually receiving needed medical and dental services within professionally acceptable\ntimeframes is unquestionably relevant to whether defendants are, in fact, providing a program of medical, dental,\nand healthrelated services that provides accessibility, quality and continuity of care. Likewise, whether case\nmanagers ensure that class members receive all of the supports and services referenced in their Individual\nService Plans, another outcome criterion (id. ¶ D.1.d.ii.), bears directly on whether defendants are providing \"all\nnecessary and proper monitoring mechanisms to assure that community living arrangements, programs, and\nsupportive community services of the necessary quantity and quality are provided and maintained,\" as required\n[26]\nby the 1978 Consent Order. Evans, 459 F.Supp. at 485.\n296 *296 For these reasons, the Court will consider defendants' performance with respect to the outcome criteria as\nevidence of defendants' compliance with the related Court Orders.\nIII. Court Monitor's Reports\nDefendants have also argued that the Court should not rely on the Court Monitor's reports, objecting that the data\nin those reports are unreliable as evidence of defendants' noncompliance with Court Orders because the Court\nMonitor does not perform a proper statistical analysis. (See Oct. 4, 2006 Hr'g Tr. at 70-72.) This objection is\nunpersuasive.\nPrior to the submission of plaintiffs' and plaintiff-intervenor's proposed findings, the Court established a procedure\nand time frame for defendants to lodge their evidentiary objections. Evans, Order (July 20, 2006). At the same\ntime, the Court also established a procedure and time frame for the parties to take additional discovery, if they\ndesired to do so. Id. at 2. (See also July 20, 2006 Hr'g Tr. 11, 16, 27-28, 38-40.) Notwithstanding these rulings,\ndefendants did not object to the use of the Court Monitor's findings on grounds of statistical inaccuracy within the\n\nprescribed time period, nor did they seek to depose the Court Monitor or take discovery regarding her\n[27]\nmethodology.\nMoreover, since the first Consent Order was entered in this case in 1978, the parties have agreed that\ndefendants' implementation of the Court's Orders would be monitored by an outside expert who would report to\nthe Court on a regular basis. The 1978 Consent Order required defendants to hire a full-time Court Monitor\nwhose responsibilities were to include \"fil[ing] a verified report every ninety (90) days . . . detailing the status and\nprogress of the defendants in the implementation of this and any further Order of the Court.\" Evans, 459 F.Supp.\nat 485. The provisions of the 1978 Order concerning the role of the Court Monitor were superceded in November\n2000, when the Court granted the parties' joint motion for the appointment of an independent Court Monitor, but\nthat later Order, to which the parties agreed, again required the Court Monitor to \"regularly monitor the class\nmembers' community residential placements and day or other programs to determine Defendants'\nimplementation of this Court's Orders.\" Evans, Appointment Order at 3 (Nov. 21, 2000); see also id. at 4 (Court\n297 Monitor's duties \"shall be to observe, *297 monitor, report findings, and make recommendations to the parties,\nSpecial Master and the Court concerning the implementation of this Court's Orders\"). The November 2000 Order\nalso contemplated that the Court Monitor's reports could be used as evidence, providing that \"[t]he findings,\nrecommendations and reports of the Court Monitor may be introduced as evidence when relevant and admissible\nin accordance with the Federal Rules of Evidence.\" Id. at 5.\nPursuant to the November 2000 Order, the Court Monitor has submitted regular quarterly reports that reflect the\nresults of her reviews of defendants' progress with respect to randomly selected samples of class members.\nAlthough the Court Monitor's findings are subject to review by the parties before her reports are finalized and filed\nwith the Court, see Evans, Appointment Order at 4 (Nov. 21, 2000) (directing Monitor to submit draft report to the\nparties for comment and directing Monitor to consider the parties' comments before filing a final report with the\nCourt), there is no indication that defendants have objected to her findings. Nor is there any indication that\ndefendants have objected to the Court Monitor's methodology. See id. at 3-4 (directing Monitor to \"consult with\nthe parties and the Special Master concerning the methodologies to be used by the Monitor to assess\nDefendants' compliance with and implementation of Court Orders\"). To the contrary, in their own proposed\nfindings, defendants affirmatively rely on the Monitor's findings to show the extent to which they have satisfied\ncertain requirements 00 the same purpose for which they contend the findings may not be used by plaintiffs. (See,\n97\ne.g., Defs.' Findings at 3 (citing to Monitor's findings that Individualized Service Plans for 90% of class members\nreviewed were current).)\nIn these circumstances, defendants cannot complain that the Court Monitor has not conducted the appropriate\nstatistical analysis. The Monitor has reviewed randomly-selected subsets of class members quarter after quarter,\nand her findings are remarkably consistent in many respects. These reviews provide significant data with respect\nto defendants' overall performance under the 2001 Plan and the underlying Court Orders, and these findings will\n[28]\ntherefore be considered as evidence of whether defendants have complied with Court Orders.\nFACTUAL FINDINGS\nThere is no question that defendants have made progress in some areas under the 2001 Plan. As previously\nnoted, they have funded the Quality Trust's $11 million endowment. They have repaid class members and other\nMRDDA consumers a total of $1.2 million owed to them for the years 1992 through 2001. They have consistently\nmaintained the required case management ratios. And, as defendants note in their proposed findings, they have\ndeveloped many policies and procedures required by the Plan and have created systems for implementing the\nPlan's goals.\nPlaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor, do not dispute that policies and procedures have been adopted or that systems\nhave been created. Rather, plaintiffs challenge the effectiveness of these systems and defendants' failure to\n298 adequately implement *298 their existing policies. Plaintiffs contend that in the core areas that have the most\ndirect impact on the day-to-day welfare of class members 00 the provision of health care, the delivery of services\n97\nand supports necessary for, habilitation, the provision of case management services, and protection from abuse\n\nand neglect 00 defendants are not, and have never been, in compliance with the underlying Court Orders, not one\n97\nof which has been vacated as contemplated by the 2001 Plan.\nAlthough the parties have submitted competing findings of fact, the underlying record, which consists principally\nof materials generated by the Court Monitor's office or by defendants and their agents, is basically uncontested.\nBoth parties rely on the Court Monitor's quarterly reports and on various other data compilations prepared by\ndefendants. Plaintiffs also rely on reports by the Court Monitor's consultants and on reports of investigations of\nclass member deaths or other serious incidents performed by defendants' own IMIU or by their consultant, the\nColumbus Organization. Defendants also cite to numerous policies and procedures, manuals, and training\nmaterials.\nBased on a voluminous but basically uncontested record, the Court finds that plaintiffs have demonstrated, by\nclear and convincing evidence, that defendants have failed to comply with existing Court Orders in the core areas\nof health, safety, and welfare. These failures are systemic in that they affect many class members served by a\ncross-section of providers and occur throughout defendants' service delivery system. They are serious in that\nthey concern matters that are integral to class members' health, safety, and well-being. And, they are continuous\nin that the same issues of noncompliance have persisted year after year. Although the Court has organized its\nfindings in terms of these three broad categories (health, safety, and welfare), there is substantial overlap among\nthem. Noncompliance in the area of case management, for example, impacts all three core areas.\nNotwithstanding defendants' commitment to \"provide the same level of service to class and non-class members\"\n(2001 Plan at 5 n. 2), in evaluating defendants' compliance with the Plan as it relates to defendants' compliance\nwith the underlying Court Orders, the Court has, unless otherwise noted, relied exclusively on evidence\nconcerning class members.\nI. HEALTH\n1. Under the existing Court Orders, defendants are required to provide \"[a] program of medical, dental and health\nrelated services for class members which provides accessibility, quality and continuity of care for physical illness\nor injury.\" Evans, 459 F.Supp. at 489. \"Written policies and procedures governing the safe administration and\nhandling of medications\" must be established, and medications may be administered only by appropriately\ntrained and qualified staff. Id. Class members' medications must be monitored, with at least monthly review by a\nphysician, and class members must be fed in the maximum upright position consistent with their capabilities and\ndisabilities. Id. Defendants are also required to develop and provide for each class member \"a written habilitation\nplan, based upon individualized assessments and formulated in accordance with professional standards.\" Id. at\n484-85. Individual Habilitation Plans, now known as Individual Support Plans or Individual Service Plans (\"ISPs\"),\n299 [29] must be revised annually, Evans,*299 Consent Order at 4 (June 25, 1981); Evans, 459 F.Supp. at 485, and\nmust identify all services required by class members. Evans, Consent Order at 4 (June 25, 1981). Priority in\nimplementing ISPs must be given to \"class members who have been identified as assaultive, self-injurious, self-\nabusive, mentally ill, or who have acute medical needs or identified needs for physical rehabilitation services.\" Id.\nat 6. Defendants must also ensure that appropriate training programs for all staff, including staff assigned to\nresidential settings, are developed and implemented. See Evans, Consent Order at 13 (Feb. 8, 1983); Evans,\nConsent Order at 3 (June 25, 1981); Evans, 459 F.Supp. at 489.\n2. Each of the foregoing Court Orders was incorporated into the 2001 Plan. (2001 Plan ¶¶ A.1.a.iii., A.1.a.vii.,\nA.2.a.vi., A.3.a.ii., A.4.a.i., A.4.a.iv., A.4.a.v.) The \"tasks\" identified in the Plan as necessary to implement these\nCourt Orders require that ISPs identify each class member's service, support and protection needs regardless of\navailability, that they be modified as the class member's needs and circumstances change, and that they be\nimplemented promptly (id. ¶ A.1.b.iv.); that the District develop procedures for including in each ISP an\nassessment of the individual consumer's need for medical and dental care and the means for securing such\nservices within professionally acceptable time frames (id. ¶ A.1.b.v.); and that the District develop and implement\nan ongoing training program for all staff working within the developmental disabilities services delivery system in\norder to develop the skills and competencies required to provide services meeting the standards applicable to the\nprograms in which they work. (Id. ¶ A.3.b.ii.)\n\n3. The parties agreed, as part of the 2001 Plan, that the measure of defendants' compliance with the foregoing\nCourt Orders (i.e., the \"outcome criteria\" for these Orders) would include such factors as whether ISPs are\ndeveloped or revised in accordance with professional standards at least annually and reviewed whenever there is\na significant change in circumstances (2001 Plan ¶ A.1.d.i.); whether ISPs address class members' need for\nmedical, dental, and mental health services and provide for decision making by a guardian for class members\nwith decision making incapacity (id. ¶ A.1.d.iii.); whether needed medical and dental services are provided within\nprofessionally acceptable time frames (id. ¶ A.1.d.iii.); whether class members are fed according to their\nindividual needs by adequately trained staff (id. ¶ A.2.d.iv.); whether, in the event that private providers fail to\ncomply with performance expectations, including the expectation that medical and dental services will be\nprovided within professionally acceptable time frames, the District takes action to ensure compliance or imposes\nsanctions designed to ensure compliance, including terminating provider agreements, where necessary (id. ¶\nA.1.d.viii.); whether staff employed by the District and provider agencies have attended required training\nprograms and satisfactorily demonstrated competence in the skills required for the positions they hold (id. ¶\n300 A.3.d.ii.), and whether defendants have developed and implemented a policy governing the safe administration \n*300 and handling of medications. (Id. ¶ A.4.d.ii.)\n4. MRDDA has a policy setting forth the guidelines to be used in assessing consumers' medical and dental needs\nand identifying `the mechanism for securing treatment. (See Defs.' Ex. 9.) Consistent with the requirement of the\n2001 Plan that defendants develop procedures for including in class members' ISPs an assessment of their need\nfor medical and dental care, the policy requires that written evaluations from medical and dental professionals be\npart of MRDDA consumers' ISPs and requires those assessments to address consumers' comprehensive care\nneeds, including primary and long-term needs. (See id. at 2.) The policy requires MRDDA to work with residential\nproviders to ensure that consumers' medical and dental needs are evaluated annually and integrated into ISPs;\nthat residential records are monitored to track appointments, timeliness of service, follow-up visits, consistency,\ntreatment delivery, and documentation of data that impact consumer habilitation (e.g., diet, vital signs, behaviors);\nthat treatment plans are monitored to ensure that quality service is provided by medical and dental providers; and\nthat residential providers actively communicate with physicians and dentists. (See id. at 5-6.) Defendants\nacknowledge that MRDDA case managers and nurse managers \"are responsible for monitoring the medical care\nprovided to class members.\" (Defs.' Findings at 5.) A separate MRDDA policy addresses the use of psychotropic\nmedications for MRDDA consumers. (See Defs.' Ex. 11.)\n5. MRDDA has also developed a \"Comprehensive Health Plan\" aimed at establishing \"effective and consistent\nhealth, clinical and behavioral supports for persons with mental retardation across the MRDDA system.\" (Defs.'\nEx. 12 at 2.) As part of this Comprehensive Health Plan, ISPs are required to include a Health Management Care\nPlan, also known as a Health Risk Management Plan (hereinafter \"Health Plan\"). (See Defs.' Ex. 12 at 4, 14, 24.)\nHealth Plans also, address the 2001 Plan's requirement that ISPs include an assessment of the consumer's\nmedical needs and the means for securing such services within professionally acceptable time frames. The\nHealth Plan is designed to be \"a clear, comprehensive, and, easily understood description of a consumer's health\nand mental health risks, diagnoses, intervention(s), medical and behavioral history, medication(s), recommended\nscreening(s), and scheduled medical or behavioral events for an MRDDA consumer.\" (Id. at 24.) Health Plans are\nto include responses to any identified diagnoses or recommendations, are to be written in \"clear basic English so\nthat entries can be easily understood by lay persons,\" and must identify an implementation procedure (including\nresponsible parties and oversight staff) for each intervention. (Id.; see also id. at 4 (the Health Plan \"is similar to a\nnursing plan except that it is written for lay people, particularly Direct Support Staff, and it explains each\nintervention or recommendation in detail including documentation requirements\").)\n6. More recently, defendants have contracted with Georgetown University to form the Health Resources\nDevelopment Partnership (the \"Health Partnership\") \"to assist the District in its efforts to assure appropriate\nhealth care is available to people with developmental disabilities in their communities.\" (Defs. Ex. 19 at 3.) The\nHealth Partnership has assisted defendants in developing a database of medical providers that serve individuals\nwith developmental disabilities, recruiting new medical providers, conducting trainings and panels for case\n301 managers and provider agency staff, and providing technical assistance to provider agencies. (See Defs.' *301\nExs. 21-34.) The Health Partnership has also developed a \"health passport,\" a short document intended to\n\naddress the need for a concise method of communicating an individual's health history. (Defs.' Ex. 23 at 6; Defs.'\nEx. 36.)\n7. Notwithstanding defendants' policies and procedures and the work of the Health Partnership, plaintiffs have\npresented compelling evidence that there have been, and continue to be, serious problems with the\nimplementation of defendants' policies, with the result that many class members do not receive needed medical\ncare within professionally acceptable time frames as required by the 2001 Plan and the 1978 Consent Order.\n(2001 Plan ¶¶ A.1.b.iv. (requiring that ISPs, of which Health Plans are a part, be implemented promptly), A.1.d.iii.\n(requiring that medical and dental services be provided within professionally acceptable time frames).) Evans,\n459 F.Supp. at 489 (requiring a program of medical, dental, and health-related services providing for accessibility,\nquality, and continuity of care).\n8. According to MRDDA's own training report for the period from April to June 2006, the vast majority of providers\nhave not completed staff training regarding MRDDA's medical and dental policy, psychotropic medications, or\nbehavior support plans. (Sept. 24, 2006 Monitor's Report at 20 (55 out of 64 providers had not completed training\nabout medical/dental policy; 56 out of 65 providers had not completed training about behavior support plans; 53\nout of 64 providers had not completed training on psychotropic medication).) Although 85 to 86% of case\nmanagers had completed training in these areas, only about half of other relevant MRDDA staff were trained. (Id.\n(43% of other relevant MRDDA staff were trained regarding medical/dental policy, 51% were trained about\npsychotropic medications, 48% were trained about behavior support plans).)\n9. The Court Monitor repeatedly has found that Health Plans do not reference current health problems and do not\n[30]\nprovide for appropriate interventions for a substantial proportion of class members reviewed.  Sixty-three\npercent of Health Plans reviewed by the Court Monitor's office between October 2004 and September 2005 did\nnot reference class members' current health problems or provide for appropriate interventions. (Nov. 3, 2005\nMonitor's Report at 1, 9.) The statistic improved in the Court Monitor's reviews in the first two quarters of 2006,\nbut even so, Health Plans for 34% and 40% of class members reviewed in those quarters did not reference\ncurrent health problems or provide for appropriate interventions. (Sept. 24, .2006 Monitor's Report at 15; June 26,\n2006 Monitor's Report at 15.) These problems were again present in two-thirds of Health Plans reviewed in the\nthird quarter of 2006. (Sept. 24, 2006 Monitor's Report 15, 18.) Deficiencies documented by consultants to the\nCourt Monitor during this time period include, for example, Health Plans that failed to reference one class\nmember's \"recent emergency abdominal surgery, fistula, and open, draining abdominal wound\" (Pls.' Ex. 156(F)\n(1) at 3); another class member's sexually transmitted disease, pulmonic stenosis, and extensive deep vein\nthrombosis (Pls.' Ex. 156(A)(17) at 4); and a third class member's substantial weight loss (Pls.' Ex. 156(A)(29) at\n302 26).[31] MRDDA's *302 own nursing staff have also, identified major problems in a significant number of Health\nPlans. (Sept. 24, 2006 Monitor's Report at 19 (MRDDA's quarterly reviews identified major problems in over one-\nthird of Health Plans).; June 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 15 (major problems in 50% of Health Plans).) As is\nobvious, Health Plans cannot guide the management of class members' health risks if they do not identify those\nrisks and interventions necessary to address them.\n10. Even when health needs are recognized, class members often do not receive prescribed interventions within\nthe appropriate time frames 00 or at all. Recommendations by primary care physicians and/or specialty care\n97\nconsultants were not acted upon in a timely manner in a majority of cases reviewed by the Court Monitor's office\nduring the past two years. (Nov. 3, 2005 Monitor's Report at 2, 10 (recommendations not acted upon in 56% of\nthe cases reviewed between October 2004 and September 2005); Sept. 24, 2006 Monitor's Report at 16, 19\n(recommendations not timely acted upon in 49%, 64%, and 68% of cases reviewed in the first three quarters of\n2006, respectively).) Similarly, lab work and/or physician-ordered diagnostic tests and consults were not\ncompleted as ordered in a significant number of cases reviewed during this time frame. (Nov. 3, 2005 Monitor's\nReport at 2, 10 (lab work/test/consults not completed as ordered in 51% of cases reviewed between October\n2004 and September 2005); Sept. 24, 2006 Monitor's Report at 14, 19 (lab work/tests/consults not completed as\nordered in 45%, 51%, and 38% of cases reviewed in first three quarters of 2006, respectively).) Dining plans,\npositioning plans, and behavioral plans also are not followed for many class members. (Nov. 3, 2005 Monitor's\nReport at 2, 11 (dining and positioning plans not followed in 52% of cases reviewed between October 2004 and\nSeptember 2005; behavioral plans not followed in 40% of cases reviewed); Sept. 24, 2006 Monitor's Report at\n\n23-24 (dining plans not implemented in 32%, 37%, and 43% of cases reviewed in the first three quarters of 2006;\npositioning plans not implemented in 42%, 37%, and 60% of cases; behavioral plans not implemented in 35%,\n32%, and 47% of cases).)\n11. These problems are well documented not only by the Court Monitor but by MRDDA's own nurse managers,\nwho are required to provide quarterly monitoring for class members and other MRDDA consumers identified as\nhaving high health risks. (Defs.' Ex. 12 at 4.) MRDDA nurses identified problems in the implementation of Health\nPlans in two-thirds of the quarterly reviews performed in 2006. (Id. at 19; June 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 5,\n15.)\n12. The same types of problems are also routinely cited in investigations of serious incidents involving class\nmembers done by defendants' IMIU and in fatality investigations done by defendant's consultant, the Columbus\nOrganization. For example, physician-prescribed interventions to reduce or eliminate one class member's chronic\nurinary tract infections were not fully implemented, placing the class member at increased risk of continued\ninfections. (Pls.' Ex. 156(A)(19).) Although a specialist recommended that a lesion with a high probability for\n303 cancer be surgically removed following another class member's colonoscopy, the surgery was not performed \n*303 until eleven months later, and, even then, IMIU investigators were unable to obtain documentation verifying\nthat the surgery had been performed. (U.S. Ex. 21j at 2-3:) A physician's orders that a third class member receive\nweekly blood tests until the class member \"was deemed state\" were not followed. (U.S. Ex. 21w.) The provider\nfor another class member \"failed to ensure implementation of physicians' orders such as weekly blood level\nelectrolytes and adequate documentation of input and output,\" and the class member's physical therapy, speech\ntherapy, and occupational therapy programs were not \"consistently implemented nor [were] recommendations\nfollowed.\" (U.S. Ex. 21bb; see also U.S. Ex. 11b (colonoscopy recommended in May 2004 was not done until\nFebruary 2005); Pls.' Ex. 156(H)(13) (no evidence that various ISP recommendations were implemented,\nincluding follow up with speciality clinics, nutritional evaluation, monitoring of monthly weights).)\n13. Delays in obtaining needed medical care for class members are also the result of defendants' failure to\nensure that guardians are appointed for those class members who need them. Delayed medical care due to the\nlack of a legal guardian has been cited in Columbus mortality investigations for at least five class members in\n2005 and 2006. (Pls.' Ex. 52 at 15 (lack of guardian to provide consent delayed class member's surgery four days\nuntil surgery was determined to be an emergency); Pls.' Ex. 53 at 15 (due to lack of guardian, screening\ncolonoscopy recommended in April 2005 was not completed prior to class member's death eight months later);\nPls.' Ex. 55 at 15 (medical procedures were significantly delayed in at least two instances due to lack of\nguardian); Pls.' Ex. 56 at 27 (lack of legally appointed guardian resulted in delays in treatment and procedures\nduring class member's hospitalization immediately prior to his death); Pls. Ex. 106 at 13 (lack of a legally\nappointed guardian created delays and confusion in obtaining consents for medically necessary treatments at\n\"critical time\" when class member was hospitalized).) In addition, the FRC has repeatedly recommended that\nMRDDA \"ensure that at a minimum, persons with complex medical issues, terminal illnesses and/or other\nsignificant medical compromise have a legal guardian appointed,\" a process that should be reinforced in the ISP.\n(Pls.' Ex. 120.)\n14. The Court Monitor found that, as of June 2006, there were twenty-eight class members whose medical\ntreatment was pending the appointment of a guardian. (June 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 19.) Defendants admit\nthat, as of September 2006, requests for guardians remained pending in nineteen of the fifty-three cases in which\nMRDDA has requested guardians since November 2005. (Defs.' Findings at 12-13; Defs.' Ex. 43.) In virtually all\nof those cases, guardians were requested for medical reasons. (Id.) Yet, in a number of cases, guardian requests\nwere not sent to the Office of the Attorney General (\"OAG\") until months after the case manager was notified of\nthe need for a guardian. (See id. (showing delays of at least three 00 and as many as nine and a half 00 months\n97 97\nbetween the date the case manager was notified and the date the request was sent to OAG in sixteen cases); \nsee also Pls.' Ex. 54 at 19 (although need for guardian was \"obvious\" in July 2001, guardian was not appointed\nuntil January 2005); Pls.' Ex. 107 (noting failure to seek guardian for class member determined to be incompetent\nto make independent and informed decisions); Pls.' Ex. 108 at 10 (guardian never appointed for class member\nwho died in 2004, notwithstanding that guardianship had been explored a decade earlier).)\n304\n\n*304 15. The Court Monitor's office and IMIU and Columbus Organization investigators have also documented\nmany other serious deficiencies in the delivery of health care to class members. The Court Monitor found, for\nexample, that provider nursing assessments were not comprehensive and did not address health risk issues for a\nmajority of the class members reviewed during the past two years. (Sept. 24, 2006 Monitor's Report at 18\n(problem present for 50%, 64%, and 78% of class members reviewed in first three quarters of 2006,\nrespectively); Nov. 3, 2006 Monitor's Report at 10 (problem present in 78% of class members reviewed between\nOctober 2004 and September 2005).) Health Plans were not adequately monitored by provider nurses and\nQualified Mental Retardation Professionals (\"QMRPs\") for a similarly large segment of class members during this\nperiod. (Nov. 3, 2005 Monitor's Report at 2 (82% of Health Plans reviewed from October 2004 to September 2005\nshowed no evidence of monitoring by provider nurses); Sept. 24, 2006 Monitor's Report at 16 (Health Plans not\nadequately monitored by provider nurses in 56%, 52%, and 73% of cases reviewed in the first three quarters of\n2006, respectively); June 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 5, 15 (60% of Health Plans reviewed in second quarter of\n2006 were not adequately monitored by QMRPs); Sept. 24, 2006 Monitor's Report at 18 (three quarters of Health\nPlans reviewed in third quarter of 2006 were not adequately monitored by QMRPs).) Provider residences for a\nmajority of class members reviewed during this same time frame lacked effective systems for tracking class\nmembers' food and fluid intake, tube feedings, seizures, and bowel movements and urine output. (Nov. 3, 2005\nMonitor's Report at 2, 15 (systems lacking in homes for 81% of class members reviewed between October 2004\nand September 2005); Sept. 24, 2006 Monitor's Report at 17 (systems lacking in residences for 53%, 60%, and\n75% of class members reviewed in first three quarters of 2006, respectively).) Moreover, data for these areas\nwere not reviewed by clinicians on a regular basis in a significant portion of cases. (Sept. 24, 2006 Monitor's\nReport at 19 (data not reviewed in two-thirds of cases); June 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 15 (data not reviewed\nin 49% of cases).)\n16. These deficiencies have serious consequences for class members. Columbus investigators have questioned\nwhether the deaths of at least five class members might have been prevented if health problems had been\nmanaged better. (See U.S. Ex. 11a at 27 (citing the lack of a \"well-coordinated effort by [the provider] to\ncomprehensively investigate and address the decedent's weight loss and significant anemia,\" even though two\nother class members with similar weight loss issues, also in the provider's care, had died in the past seven\nmonths, and nursing staff's failure to adequately assess and monitor the decedent when he exhibited a significant\nchange in status months before his death)); U.S. Ex. 11b at 20 (citing failure of decedent's health care team to\n\"adequately address his risk for morbidity and mortality due to his underweight status and GI and pulmonary\ndiagnoses\"); U.S. Ex. 11c at 26 (citing lack of a coordinated effort to \"appropriately and comprehensively\nevaluate, assess, and monitor the decedent when he presented with a change in status\" and lack of an\n\"aggressive approach to the decedent's chronic underweight status\"); U.S. Ex. 11f at 20-21 (citing failure of\nprovider nursing staff to comprehensively assess or adequately monitor class member when she exhibited a\nchange in status in the week prior to her death); U.S. Ex. 11m at 15 (citing monitoring and other problems\nassociated with the effort to taper decedent's anticonvulsant medication).\n305 *305 17. Monitoring failures have also been found to contribute to preventable hospitalizations. For example,\nIMIU investigators found that one class member's emergency inpatient hospital admission for pneumonia could\nhave been avoided had the provider sought appropriate medical attention when the class member's symptoms\nmanifested themselves more than a month earlier. (Pls.' Ex. 156(A)(18).) Columbus investigators concluded that\nappropriate monitoring of a class member's thirty-eight-pound weight loss in a ten-month period may have\nresulted in earlier detection of the class member's gastrointestinal bleeding, which resulted in a fifty-eight-day\nhospitalization, numerous blood transfusions, and extensive surgery. (Pls.' Ex. 156(A)(3).) Columbus\ninvestigators also found that closer monitoring and intervention by provider nursing staff \"could very possibly\nhave prevented\" problems that resulted in a third class member's emergency room visit and hospitalizations.\n(Pls.' Ex. 156(A)(9).) Closer monitoring and evaluation of a fourth class member \"might have prevented the\nexacerbation [of] her cellulitis and subsequent hospitalization.\" (Pls.' Ex. 156(A)(23).)\n18. Serious problems also persist with respect to medications. The Court Monitor's reviews over the past two\nyears consistently have found that a majority of class members who receive psychotropic medications do not\nreceive competent and consistent monitoring of the side effects of those medications. (Nov. 3, 2006 Monitor's\nReport at 2, 11 (monitoring lacking for 82% of class members reviewed); Sept. 24, 2006 Monitor's Report at 15,\n19 (monitoring lacking for 60%, 69%, and 53% of class members reviewed in first three quarters of 2006,\n\nrespectively).) Medications were not consistently and properly stored, administered or accounted for per\nacceptable standards of practice in approximately half of cases reviewed during the past year. (Sept. 24, 2006\nMonitor's Report at 19 (problems in two-thirds of cases reviewed in quarter ending in September 2006); June 22,\n2006 Monitor's Report at 5, 16 (problems in 48% of cases reviewed in quarter ending in June 2006); see also\nFeb. 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 2, 8 (noting pattern of problems with medication administration and\nreconciliation).)\n19. As set forth above, defendants have failed in many significant respect to accomplish the tasks and to achieve\nthe outcome criteria in the 2001 Plan that relate to the Court's Orders regarding the provision of health care and\nto comply with the terms of the Orders themselves. Defendants' deficient performance with respect to these\nmeasures provides ample evidence that defendants have failed to comply with the Court's Order that \"[a]\nprogram of medical, dental and health related services which provides accessibility, quality and continuity of care\nis required,\" as well as with Court Orders requiring development of habilitation plans and programs that\nincorporate all services needed by class members and implementation of appropriate training programs for all\nstaff. See Evans, Consent Order at 13 (Feb. 8, 1983); Evans, Consent Order at 3-4, 6 (June 25, 1981); Evans,\n459 F.Supp. at 485, 489.\nII. SAFETY\n1. In the 1978 Consent Order, the Court recognized that class members' constitutional right to be kept free from\nharm had been violated. Evans, 459 F.Supp. at 484. To remedy such violations, the existing Court Orders prohibit\nall acts of \"physical or psychological abuse, neglect or, mistreatment\" and require that \"each and every alleged\nincident of abuse, neglect or mistreatment . . . be promptly investigated and a report made.\" Id. at 488; see also\n306 Evans, Consent Order at 8 (Feb. 8, 1983) (requiring defendants to *306 submit to the Developmental Disabilities\nProfessional for review and approval their \"Unusual Incident Reporting Form and the procedures undertaken by\ndefendants pursuant to any Unusual Incident Report\"). Incident reports must be maintained by defendants and\nmade available upon reasonable notice to counsel for plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor and members of the\nCommunity Advisory Board. Evans, 459 F.Supp. at 488-89. Defendants must notify the Court Monitor\nimmediately upon the death of a class member, provide the Court Monitor with prompt notice of pending or\nongoing investigations of serious incidents involving class members, and forward to the Court Monitor copies of\nany incident reports related to deaths, autopsies, and/or death summaries of class members, as well as all final\nreports of investigations that involve class members. Evans, Appointment Order at 4 (Nov. 21, 2000). Defendants\nmust also provide \"all necessary and proper monitoring mechanisms to assure that community living\narrangements, programs and supportive community services of the necessary quantity and quality are provided\nand maintained,\" Evans, 459 F.Supp. at 485, ensure that appropriate training programs for all staff, including staff\nassigned to residential settings, are developed and implemented, see Evans, Consent Order at 13 (Feb. 8,\n1983); Evans, Consent Order at 3 (June 25, 1981); Evans, 459 F.Supp. at 489, and ensure that advocates are\nprovided to assist in the protection of class members' rights. Id. at 486.\n2. As part of the 2001 Plan, which incorporates the foregoing Court Orders (2001 Plan ¶¶ A.3.a.ii., B.a.ii., B.a.iii.,\n[32]\nB.a.v., D.2.a.i., D.2.a.ii.),  the parties agreed on numerous \"tasks\" that defendants must complete in order to\nimplement the Court's Orders. With respect to the reporting of incidents, defendants must develop written policies\nand a uniform written incident reporting form and must disseminate the incident reporting form and policies to all\nrelevant entities and personnel. (Id. ¶¶ B.b.i., B.b.ii.) Defendants must also establish and publicize a 24-hour\nhotline for the reporting of consumer incidents, develop an adequate and appropriate intake process, and\ndevelop a computerized system that permits residential and day treatment providers to report incidents on-line. (\nId. ¶¶ B.b.iii., B.b.iv., B.b.v.)\n3. Defendants must develop specific written protocols for the investigation of incidents designated as \"serious,\"\nincluding deaths. (Id. ¶ B.b.vi.; see also id. ¶ D.1.b.iv.) Among other things, such protocols must provide for\n\"prompt, thorough investigations\" of these incidents by trained personnel and must specify the time frames for\ncompletion of investigations and investigation reports and for the implementation of corrective and disciplinary\naction recommendations. (Id. ¶¶ B.b.vi., B.b.vii.) Investigation reports and corrective action plans must be\nsubmitted to the Court Monitor and the Quality Trust within seven days of completion. (Id. ¶ B.b.xiii.) With respect\nto consumer deaths in particular, defendants must ensure that such deaths are investigated \"to determine the\n\ncause of death, the circumstances of the death and the factors which may have contributed to the death, as well\nas any preventive or corrective action that appears warranted to address any issues that may have been\n307 identified during the investigation.\" (Id, ¶ D.1.b.iv.) Defendants must also provide for an interdisciplinary *307 FRC\nthat will have access to death investigation reports, make written recommendations based on a review of the\ncircumstances of consumer deaths, and adopt procedures to ensure that recommendations emanating from the\nfatality review process are implemented and subject to follow-up monitoring by case managers. (Id.)\n4. Defendants must develop a data system within MRDDA capable of aggregating information, about consumer\nincidents, incident reporting, investigations, the investigation process and status, and the implementation of\ncorrective action recommendations and investigation results (id. ¶ B.b.viii.), and they must disseminate aggregate\nand specific information about the overall performance of the system in protecting the health and safety of\nconsumers to the. Court Monitor and the Quality Trust on a quarterly basis. (Id. ¶ B.b.xiv.) Defendants must also\nprovide an effective quality assurance system to ensure the regular, independent review of incident reporting,\ninvestigations, identification of causes of and contributing factors to incidents, and implementation of any\nnecessary corrective actions to protect consumers from harm, and to ensure that providers are made aware of\nproblematic trends and that corrective action is taken on an individual consumer level, a provider-specific level,\nand a systemic level. (Id. ¶ B.b.ix.) Defendants must provide initial training on incident reporting to providers,\ndirect care staff, administrators, investigators, and case managers; reinforce such training through case-specific\ncontinuing education; and provide additional competency-based training to investigators and their supervisors. (\nId. ¶¶ B.b.x., B.b.xi.)\n5. The parties agreed, as part of the 2001 Plan, that defendants' compliance with the Court's Orders would be\nmeasured in terms of a number of factors, including whether all incidents are reported in accordance with District\npolicy (id. ¶ B.d.i.); whether defendants notify family members and guardians, the Court Monitor, and the Quality\nTrust of serous incidents within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of such incidents (id. ¶ B.d.ii.); whether\nserious incidents are reported within the required time frame and thoroughly investigated by trained investigators\nand whether all other incidents are investigated in accordance with policy requirements (id. ¶ B.d.iii.); whether\ninvestigation reports identify appropriate preventive, corrective, and disciplinary actions needed to protect\nMRDDA consumers from harm (id. ¶ B.d.iv.); whether all serious incident investigation reports are reviewed by\nMRDDA quality assurance staff and whether quality assurance staff review all other incidents for patterns and\ntrends (id. ¶ B.d.v.); whether case managers follow up on recommendations for all serious incidents to ensure\nthat appropriate preventive, corrective, or disciplinary actions are implemented promptly and document their\nactions, and whether case managers follow up on all incidents to ensure that all consumers are safe and\nprotected from harm (id. ¶ B.d.vi.); whether MRDDA ensures that necessary preventive, corrective, and\ndisciplinary actions are promptly implemented based on the quality assurance review of incident patterns and\ntrends (id.; see also id. ¶ D.2.d.iii.); whether the Court Monitor and the Quality Trust receive incident reports of all\nserious incidents, all final investigation reports, and all recommendations for preventive and corrective action, as\nwell as quarterly aggregate reports on patterns and trends for all other incidents (id. ¶ B.d.viii); whether deaths\nare reported to and reviewed by the FRC (id. ¶ D.2.d.i.); whether recommendations from the FRC for preventive\n308 and corrective actions are *308 followed up, implemented, and documented (id. ¶ D.2.d.ii.); and whether, when\nprivate providers do not comply with performance expectations, the District takes whatever, immediate actions\nare necessary to correct the deficiency, including providing training or technical assistance to provider staff or\nimposing sanctions, including, where necessary, terminating provider agreements, contracts and licenses. (Id. ¶¶\nB.d.x., D.2.d.v.)\n6. As required by the 2001 Plan, MRDDA policy specifies the types of incidents involving MRDDA consumers that\nmust be reported and designates certain types of incidents, including, for example, consumer deaths, incidents of\nabuse and neglect, serious physical injuries, serious medication errors, and emergency inpatient hospitalizations,\n[33]\nas \"serious reportable incidents.\"  (Defs.' Ex. 53 at 2-10.) Serious reportable incidents are investigated by the\nIMIU. (Defs.' Ex. 57.) The District previously contracted with the Columbus Organization to investigate consumer\ndeaths; however, that contract ended sometime during 2006 and was not renewed due to budget constraints.\n(Oct. 4, 2006 Hr'g Tr. at 79; Oct. 5, 2006 Hr'g Tr. at 44-45.) Responsibility for death investigations has since been\nassigned to the IMIU, whose staff was augmented by a registered nurse and a physician to assist in\ninvestigations of consumer deaths. (Id.)\n\nAlthough both the 1978 Consent Order and the 2001 Plan make clear that abuse, neglect, and mistreatment of\nclass members are prohibited, Evans, 459 F.Supp. at 488; (2001 Plan ¶ B.a.ii. (incorporating 1978 Consent\nOrder); ¶ B.d.i. (defendants' policies and procedures must \"clearly prohibit[]\" abuse, neglect, and mistreatment)),\nincidents of abuse and neglect of class members nevertheless persist. These incidents are well documented by\nthe IMIU. For example, allegations of abuse of class members were substantiated in at least nine cases\ninvestigated by the IMIU between January 2005 and June 2006. (See U.S. Exs. 20b, 11o, 11p, 11r, 20c, 11s,\n20d, 11t.) An IMIU investigator recommended that a tenth abuse case be closed when the provider staff member\ninvolved was criminally charged with abuse of a vulnerable adult based on allegations that she had struck a class\nmember in the face, injuring him in the eye. (U.S. Ex. 20a.) Moreover, IMIU investigators made findings of\n[34]\nprovider neglect or negligence, or concluded that indicia of neglect were present,  in at least fifty-six cases\n309 involving class members that were investigated during this same time period. *309 (See U.S. Exs. 2, 11u-11y,\n21a21ww, 21yy.) These cases include a provider staff member who pled guilty to criminal negligence of a\nvulnerable adult for seating a class member in scalding bath water that had been improperly heated on a stove\ntop, causing second degree burns to the class member's buttocks and legs (U.S. Exs. 1, 2), as well as incidents\nin which provider staff failed to adequately supervise class members, leaving them at risk of injury (see, e.g., U.S.\nExs. 21a, 21e), failed to timely seek or provide medical care for class members (see, e.g., U.S. Exs. 21d, 21h,\n21k), or otherwise failed to address class members' needs (see, e.g., U.S. Ex. 21p). These problems are\nwidespread among providers, involving class members served at twenty-three different provider sites. (See Nov.\n29, 2006 Monitor's Report at 33-34.)\n8. The Court Monitor has also provided recent data regarding serious incidents. Between October 1, 2005 and\nAugust 31, 2006, a total of 230 serious incidents involving both class and non-class members were reported. (Id.\nat 6.) As of November 2006, defendants had investigated 166 of those incidents, and ninety-six incidents had\nbeen substantiated. (Id.) Of the ninety-six substantiated incidents, thirty-six involved incidents of abuse and\n[35]\nneglect. (Id. at 7.)  These incidents occurred at fourteen different provider sites. (Id. at 9.)\n9. Defendants have adopted internal investigative protocols for the IMIU, which require IMIU investigative reports\nto be completed, including supervisory review, within forty-five work days. (Defs.' Ex. 57.) Despite this\nrequirement, serious reportable incidents, including deaths, are not investigated in a timely manner in many\ninstances. Although defendants had reduced the backlog of overdue serious incident investigations for class\nmembers to two as of November 3, 2005 (Nov. 3, 2005 Monitor's Report at 15), there were seventy-one overdue\ninvestigations for class members, including four overdue death investigations, three months later in February\n2006. (Feb. 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 13.) There were 107 overdue serious incident investigations for class\nmembers as of May 2006 (Pls.' Ex. 132), and ninety-two overdue investigations, including eight overdue death\ninvestigations, as of June 2006. (June 22, 2006 Monitor's Report.) And while the extent of defendants' backlog of\noverdue serious incident investigations as of September 2006 was disputed due to problems reconciling\nMRDDA's data with the Quality Trust's data, the backlog remained substantial whether one accepts the District's\n[36]\nestimate (fifty-nine) or the Court Monitor's estimate (ninety-nine). (Sept. 24, 2006 Monitor's Report at 10.)\n310 Investigations of serious *310 reportable incidents are intended to identify those preventive and corrective actions\nnecessary to ensure consumers' heath and safety. (See Defs.' Ex. 53 at 11; 2001 Plan ¶ B.b.vii.) When\ninvestigations are delayed, so too are these needed provider interventions. Indeed, the FRC has identified the\ninability to, timely obtain the information and data required for reviews as one obstacle to the Committee's\neffective operation. (U.S. Ex. 13 at 3.)\n10. Once investigation, reports are completed, defendants must provide them to the Court Monitor within seven\ndays. Evans, Appointment Order at 4 (Nov. 21, 2000). (See also 2001 Plan ¶ B.b.xiii.; Defs.' Ex. 57 at 2.) Yet,\nthere have been serious problems with the accuracy and reliability of the information provided to the Court\nMonitor's office. In June 2006, the Court Monitor determined that at least one of the Columbus death\ninvestigations she had received from the District had been edited to delete information critical of the District prior\nto being distributed. (June 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 9.) When the Court Monitor thereafter requested that\nColumbus send copies of certain reports to her directly, Columbus was instructed not to do so, until Special\nMaster Sundram intervened. (Id.) The Court Monitor later determined, by comparing nineteen Columbus death\ninvestigation reports received directly from Columbus to those distributed by the District, that in eight of the\n\ninvestigation reports forwarded by the District, factual information or recommendations had been deleted from the\noriginal Columbus document. (Aug. 17, 2005 Monitor's Report at 1.) With one exception, these deletions, which\ndescribed gaps in case management, delays in obtaining consent for medical procedures, concerns about health\ncare procedures, concerns about autopsy results and procedures, and difficulties in obtaining information critical\nof the investigation process, were not agreed to by Columbus. (Id.) These significant alterations of death\ninvestigation reports call into question the reliability of information provided by defendants, impede the\nimplementation of needed interventions, and compromise defendants' ability to protect other class members from\nharm. They also constitute clear evidence of defendants' noncompliance with the Court's Orders requiring that\ndeath investigations be provided to the Court Monitor. Evans, Appointment Order at 4 (Nov. 21, 2000); Evans,\n[37]\n459 F.Supp. at 488-89. (See also 2001 Plan ¶¶ B.b.xiii., B.d.viii.)\n11. The Court Monitor has also repeatedly raised concerns regarding the quality of defendants' investigations. In\n311 her December 2004 report, the Court Monitor raised concerns regarding the IMIU's *311 practice of relying on\nprovider interviews rather than conducting independent interviews of key informants, failure to review other recent\nincident reports involving the same class member or the concerning the same provider or residence, failure to\ntake into account pertinent documentation that could be obtained from providers, and overall lack of\nthoroughness. (Dec. 30, 2004 Monitor's Report at 11-12.) Many of these same concerns were still present in\nSeptember 2006, when the Court Monitor again commented on the failure of IMIU investigators to interview\nimportant sources of pertinent information; to review other incidents reports regarding the same class member\nand provider; and to review other relevant records, including staff logs at the residence, emergency room and\nhospital discharge summaries, agency nursing notes, and health records for the alleged victim. (Sept. 24, 2006\nMonitor's Report at 11.)\n12. Moreover, defendants do not consistently ensure that appropriate preventive and corrective actions are\nimplemented based on fatality and serious incident investigations. For example, a September 2005 IMIU\ninvestigation regarding one class member's series of emergency inpatient hospitalizations within a two-month\nperiod recommended that MRDDA assess the class member, who had a long history of noncompliance with diet\nand medications required to control her diabetes and blood pressure, to determine whether additional supports\nwere warranted to ensure compliance with medical and dietary needs. (Pls.' Ex. 129.) Yet, four months later,\nMRDDA had failed to identify interventions to address the class member's identified risks and problems, including\nthe lack of nursing services to monitor her diabetes and hypertension. (Pls.' Ex. 130 at 26-27.) This failure by\nMRDDA is not an isolated incident. A 2005 report regarding the status of IMIU consumer and provider incident\nrecommendations reflected that 463 out of 847 recommendations remained unresolved as of August 2005. (Pls.'\nEx. 128.) The Court Monitor has also consistently criticized defendants for failing to review death investigations\nwith providers in a timely manner. In February 2006, the Court Monitor reported that for a period of over one year,\ndefendants repeatedly failed to notify providers of the results of the Columbus mortality investigations, with the\nresult that corrective actions were not even discussed, let alone implemented. (Feb. 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at\n13.) As of September 2006, there were at least eleven death investigations 00 for class member deaths dating\n97\nback as far as January 2005 00 that had not been reviewed with the responsible provider. (Sept. 24, 2006\n97\nMonitor's Report at 12.) As of November 2006, eight of ten Columbus death investigations concerning class\nmember deaths between October 1, 2005 and August 31, 2006 had not been reviewed with providers, though\nreviews of these death investigations were scheduled to occur between November 2006 and February 2007.\n(Nov. 29, 2006 Monitor's Report at 11-12.)\n13. The serious consequences that flow from defendants' failure to ensure that appropriate corrective and\npreventive actions are promptly implemented are illustrated by the deaths of three class members who had\nsimilar problems with weight loss issues that were not addressed by the same provider over a seven-month\nperiod. (See Pls.' Exs. 100, 61, 56.) Following the death of the first class member in November 2004, Columbus\ninvestigators raised concerns that the class member's nutritional compromise had not been more aggressively\nevaluated and managed and that daily monitoring of intake was not apparent, and as a result, they recommended\n312 that MRDDA and the provider ensure that *312 individuals exhibiting significant weight issues be\n\"comprehensively evaluated to determine the etiology of the problem and are consistently and appropriately\n[38]\nmonitored by all relevant clinical disciplines.\" (Pls.' Ex. 100 at 13.)  Yet two months later, when a second class\nmember died after experiencing significant and rapid weight loss, the death investigation again noted the lack of\n\n\"an aggressive approach to the [class member's] chronic underweight status.\" (Pls.' Ex. 61 at 26.) When a third\nclass member died in the care of the same residential provider five months later, the death investigation again\nnoted the lack of a \"well-coordinated effort by [the provider] to comprehensively investigate and address the\n[class member's] weight loss and significant anemia.\" (Pls.' Ex. 56 at 27.) It is significant that investigators\nquestioned whether the second and third deaths might have been preventable. (Pls.' Ex. 61 at 26; Pls.' Ex. 56 at\n27.)\n14. Defendants have also failed to implement recommendations for preventive and corrective action by the FRC.\nThe FRC's 2004 Annual Report, issued in April 2005, reflects that 41% of the Committee's recommendations had\nnot been implemented as of that date. (Defs.' Ex. 68 at 1.) Moreover, recommendations issued based on the\nreview of one class member's death are re-issued (sometimes repeatedly) when the same underlying problems\nare identified in later reviews. For example, the FRC's recommendation, based on the review of a class member's\n2002 death, that MRDDA \"develop procedures to address coordination of hospital discharge planning, pain\nmanagement and follow-up of end-of-life care\" was re-issued following the review of three separate deaths in\nOctober 2005., (See Pls.' Ex. 115.) Although defendants indicated in April 2004 that the Department of Human\nServices would adopt the FRC's recommendation that MRDDA \"incorporate the integration of End of Life issues\ninto consumers' person-centered plans as appropriate\" and \"develop a training module on End of Life quality\nissues as part of the person-centered planning curriculum,\" this same recommendation was also re-issued in\nOctober 2005. (See Pls.' Ex. 116.) Similarly, while defendants responded in March 2004 to the FRC's\nrecommendation that \"MRDDA ensure that the oversight of clinical reviews and coordination of health care\nservices on medically fragile individuals [be] conducted by appropriate health care professionals,\" including\nassigning adequate numbers of staff, this recommendation was re-issued five times in October 2005. (See Pls.'\nEx. 117; see also, e.g., Pls.' Ex. 118 (FRC recommendation that MRDDA \"develop a general education document\nhighlighting [health care] coordination issues in serving MRDDA customers\" for distribution to relevant health care\ncommunity re-issued five times in October 2005); Pls.' Ex. 120 (FRC's March 2005 recommendation that MRDDA\nensure that guardians are appointed for persons with complex medical issues, terminal illnesses, and other\nsignificant medical compromise re-issued in two cases in October 2005).) The FRC's repeated re-issuance of\nthese and other recommendations for preventive and corrective action is further evidence of defendants' inability\nto implement those recommendations.\n313 15. Defendants have also failed to ensure that all provider and direct care staff, *313 as well as MRDDA's own\ncase managers, are trained in incident reporting. Defendants' quarterly training report for the period from April to\nJune 2006 reflects that MRDDA has completed staff training regarding incident management for only six out of\nsixty-four providers. (U.S. Ex. 19 at 6-9.) For most providers, less than half of all direct support staff have been\n[39]\ntrained. (Id.)  Moreover, 36% of MRDDA case managers and 62% of other MRDDA staff have not been trained\nregarding incident management. (Id. at 9.) Defendants' incident management system cannot function effectively if\nprovider and MRDDA staff do not have the appropriate training.\n16. Finally, there is evidence that defendants fail to take appropriate corrective actions when providers do not\ncomply with performance expectations. One of the key concerns identified as the result of a collaborative review\nof the deaths of four class members and one non-class member undertaken by representatives of MRDDA, the\nInspector General's office, the Health Partnership, University Legal Services, and the Court Monitor's office was\nthe \"lack of enforcement penalties related to poor professional conduct,\" including the fact that staff cited for\nneglect continue to be employed in the system. (June 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 11-12.) At the October 5,\n2006 status conference, the Court Monitor observed that she is aware of only three instances in which providers\nhave been sanctioned, all during Ms. Sawyer's tenure with MRDDA, and that, in each instance, action was taken\nonly as a result of documentation filed by the Monitor's office. (Oct. 5, 2006 Hr'g Tr. at 26.) First, following the\nCourt Monitor's complaints to Ms. Sawyer regarding problems with the administration of medication to one\nconsumer, Ms. Sawyer requested that the Department of Health investigate the matter. (Id.) Second, after the\nCourt Monitor circulated a draft of her September 2006 report, which included a chronology of the serious\nconcerns that had been raised about one residence since 2003, the provider was fined $3,500 for citations noted\nduring a February 2006 licensing visit. (Id. at 26-27.) The Court Monitor also reported that Ms. Sawyer had\ndecided that clients would be moved from the residence, but that had not happened by the time of the hearing. (\nId. at 27.) Third, the Department of Health terminated the provider agreement for one of the residences targeted\n\nin the ninety-day plan, where the Court Monitor had observed clients being neglected and where one non-class\n[40]\nmember had died.  (Id. at 27-28.) The Court Monitor has also expressed concern that there is no evidence\nthat the District sanctions providers for failing to complete their own death investigations, as required. (Sept. 24,\n2006 Monitor's Report at 13.)\n17. As set forth above, defendants have failed in many significant respects to accomplish the tasks and outcome\ncriteria associated with the Court's Orders relating to class member safety and to comply with the terms of the\n314 Orders themselves. Defendants' performance in the areas discussed above provides ample evidence that *314\ndefendants have failed to comply with the Court's Orders prohibiting all acts of \"physical or psychological abuse,\nneglect or mistreatment\" of class members, Evans, 459 F.Supp. at 488, requiring the prompt reporting and\ninvestigation of all such incidents and the prompt dissemination of the reports of such investigations to the Court\nMonitor and other interested parties, Evans, Appointment Order at 4 (Nov. 21, 2000); Evans, Consent Order at 8\n(Feb. 8, 1983); Evans, 459 F.Supp. at 488-89; Evans, requiring the development and implementation of\nappropriate training programs for all staff, including staff assigned to residential settings, Evans, Consent Order\nat 13 (Feb. 8, 1983); Evans, Consent Order at 3 (June 25, 1981); Evans, 459 F.Supp. at 489, and requiring\ndefendants to provide necessary monitoring mechanisms. Id. at 485.\nIII. WELFARE\nA. Least Restrictive, Most Integrated Setting\n1. The 1978 Consent Order recognized that class members' constitutional right \"to receive habilitative care and\ntreatment in the alternative least restrictive of individual liberty\" had been violated. Evans, 459 F.Supp. at 484. To\nremedy these violations, the Court ordered defendants to \"[p]rovide all class members with community living\narrangements suitable to each, together with such community-based day programs and services as are\nnecessary to provide them with minimally adequate habilitation . . . in the least separate, most integrated and\nleast restrictive community settings.\" Id. at 485. Later Court Orders reinforce this requirement. See Evans, Court\nOrder at 10-11 (Feb. 8, 1983) (requiring that class members be provided five hours of daily programming and that\na comprehensive recreation program be implemented for class members).\n2. The tasks identified in the 2001 Plan as necessary to implement these Court Orders, which the Plan\nincorporates (2001 Plan ¶¶ A.2.a.i., A.2.a.iii., A.2.a.iv.), include developing criteria and placement procedures for\nnursing home placements and discharges (id. ¶ A.2.b.i.); using community alternatives whenever possible for\nconsumers with complex medical needs (Id.); and developing and implementing a plan for the placement of\npersons identified as being inappropriately served in nursing homes, day programs, and employment programs\ninto less restrictive, more integrated and appropriate community settings. (Id. ¶¶ A.2.b.ii., A.2.b.iii.)\n3. As part of the 2001 Plan, the parties agreed that the measure of defendants' compliance with the foregoing\nCourt Orders would be, inter alia, whether \"[a]ll class members are served in residential and day or employment\nprograms that are the least restrictive, most integrated settings appropriate to their needs\" and \"are provided with\nadequate supports to allow their participation in recreation and social activities in their communities\" (id. ¶ A.2.d.i.\n) and whether \"[n]o consumers are placed in or remain in large institutions or nursing homes inappropriately, or\nbecause appropriate community alternatives are not available.\" (Id. A.2.d.ii.)\n4. Notwithstanding the plain language of the 1978 Order and the Plan, defendants have admitted that class\nmembers are not placed in the least restrictive setting. Testifying at budget hearings before the District's\nCommittee on Human Services in April 2006, former MRDDA Administrator Marsha Thompson admitted that \"one\nof the critical areas where the District is lagging is the failure to place people in the least restrictive setting based\non their clinical needs and the agreed-upon service plan.\" (U.S. Ex. 10 at 5.) Ms. Thompson went on to\n315 acknowledge that \"[n]o one *315 debates the fact that we have people placed in inappropriate settings.\" (Id.)\nThese admissions are underscored by defendants' agreement, as part of the ninety-day plan, to move forty-six\nMRDDA consumers, including thirty class members, into individualized, integrated, less restrictive residential\nsettings. (Nov. 28, 2005 Hr'g Tr. at 6-8; U.S. Ex. 5.) The parties' decision to focus on residential placements as\npart of the ninety-day plan is particularly significant in light of the plan's purpose to address the \"immediate and\nurgent needs of class members.\" (Nov. 28, 2005 Hr'g Tr. at 6.) Although a total of forty-six class and non-class\nmembers were identified as requiring more appropriate residential placements in November 2005, defendants\n\nhad made only three placements at the conclusion of the ninety-day period in February 2006 (Feb. 22, 2006\nMonitor's Report at 1, 6) and no additional placements into more integrated and individualized settings as of June\n[41]\n2006. (June 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 2.)\n5. Defendants have submitted a declaration from the Chief of MRDDA's Evans Intensive Case Management\nBranch I, indicating that commitment orders issued for 157 class members between October 2005 and July 2006\nreflect findings by D.C. Superior Court judges that those class members were receiving habilitation by the least\n[42]\nrestrictive means as defined in D.C.Code § 7-1301.03(16).  (Defs.' Ex. 69 ¶ 8; see also Defs.' Ex. 70.) While\nthese findings may indicate that some class members are appropriately placed, defendants have admitted that\nmany are not. (U.S. Ex. 10 at 5 (admitting that placing class members in the least restrictive setting was a \"critical\n[43]\narea\" in which the District was \"lagging\").)\n316 *316 6. Day programs also do not serve class members in the most integrated, least restrictive setting in many\ninstances. In April 2003, the Court Monitor's office found that day programs were more restrictive than required by\nthe functioning of the class members enrolled in such programs, with less than 10% of class members involved in\nsupported employment programs. (Apr. 21, 2003 Monitor's Report at 8.) The Court Monitor's review of seventeen\nday program sites in 2004 revealed that a majority of day programs were overcrowded and provided segregated\nservices of low intensity and interest to class members. (Oct. 7, 2004 Monitor's Report at 10.) Four of the\nseventeen day program sites reviewed (24%) provided little substantive activity of any kind, and only two sites\n(12%) were implementing supported employment. (Id. at 9.) More recently, the parties acknowledged that existing\nday programs are often inadequate, agreeing that, as part of the ninety-day plan, forty-two class members should\nbe moved \"out of segregated day programs, which are both expensive and unproductive,\" and into \"integrated\nemployment or day activities.\" (See Nov. 28, 2005 Hr'g Tr. at 6, 8; see also Feb. 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 1.)\nAlthough the parties agreed that these forty-two class members were in need of more integrated, less restrictive\nday programs, employment was secured for only five class members, and two of the employment placements did\nnot meet agreed-upon criteria. (Id. at 1, 11.)\n7. The lack of an effective Medicaid waiver exacerbates the District's inability to meet its obligation to provide all\nclass members with habilitative care and treatment in the least restrictive, most integrated setting. The waiver\nprogram was designed to provide noninstitutional, community-based services to individuals with developmental\ndisabilities who otherwise would remain in or be at risk of being placed in a Medicaid facility such as an ICF/MR. \nSee Residential Services for Persons with Developmental Disabilities: Status and Trends Through 2005\n(\"Residential Services: Status and Trends\") at 59 (July 2006), available at http://rtc.umn. edu/risp05. The waiver\nauthorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to waive certain existing Medicaid requirements to allow\nstates to finance noninstitutional services for Medicaid-eligible individuals. Id. at 58. The waiver is thus an\nimportant source of federal funding for noninstitutional services and supports as an alternative to institutional\ncare, and the District's inability to implement an effective waiver program has resulted in additional costs being\nborne by the District and its taxpayers. (See Oct. 5, 2006 Hr'g Tr. at 53.)\n8. Although defendants object that implementation of the waiver is not Court-ordered (Defs.' Findings at 26),\ndefendants have consistently recognized that an effective waiver is necessary for them to meet their obligations\nunder existing Court Orders. Defendants stipulated, in December 2000, that \"[t]he District's commitment to self-\ndetermination embodied in person centered planning cannot be met without the funding stream provided by an\n317 effective *317 waiver\" and that \"[t]he lack of an effective waiver is in itself sufficient to keep the District from\neffectively implementing person centered planning.\" Evans, 139 F.Supp.2d at 99 (joint stipulated findings of fact\nadopted, by the Court in connection with the 2001 Plan) (emphasis added). Moreover, as part of the 2001 Plan,\nthe parties agreed that the District's existing waiver was too narrowly drawn and served too few consumers and\nthat the District needed to take greater advantage of opportunities available under the waiver in order to\nimplement the goal of providing individualized services in the least restrictive environment to class members and\nother MRDDA consumers. (2001 Plan at 62; see also Feb. 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 14 (\"All parties to this\ncase concur that the redesign and implementation of a carefully amended Medicaid waiver is of paramount\n[44]\nimportance.\").)\n\n9. The District's waiver nevertheless remains too limited in terms of the number of enrollees and ineffective in\nterms of the services actually provided to those who are enrolled. The number of class members enrolled in the\nwaiver has increased slowly over time, with only 219 class members enrolled as of September 2006. (Defs.' Ex.\n111.) Even with this increased enrollment, the District still lags far behind other states in utilizing the waiver\ninstead of more restrictive ICF/MRs. See supra note 43. Moreover, those class members who are enrolled in the\nwaiver do not receive all services and do not receive services in the frequency and duration ordered. (Sept. 24,\n2006 Monitor's Report at 7, 27.) The District's own review of 191 enrolled class members in August 2006\nrevealed that only 51% of these class members received all of the required services and that 13% did not receive\nservices in the frequency and duration ordered. (Id.) Indeed, some consumers do not receive any of their needed\nservices under the waiver. (See Pls.' Ex. 150 (33 class members did not receive any waiver services as of April\n30, 2006; 15 class members did not receive any waiver services as of May 31, 2006); Pls.' Ex. 147 (28 class\nmembers did not receive any waiver services as of September 1, 2005).) The lack of an adequate pool of\nproviders also contributes to this problem. (See U.S. Ex. 9 at 13.)\n10. The waiver is also still too narrowly drawn in ways that prevent class members from being moved into less\nrestrictive settings. For example, the waiver limits the number of hours that nursing services can be provided in\ncommunity settings. (See Oct. 5, 2006 Hr'g Tr. at 15-16.) The waiver thus provides a disincentive for the District\nto move class members out of ICF/MRs to the extent that they would need nursing services in excess of the cap,\nas the \"extra\" nursing services would have to be funded solely by local dollars. (See id.) The Court Monitor has\nnoted that the District recently has made some progress towards amending the waiver, retaining an outside\nconsultant to assist with the amendment of the waiver and drafting needed rule changes. (Sept. 24, 2006\nMonitor's Report at 27.) However, the failure to take these steps for many years has seriously impeded\ndefendants' progress in moving class members into the least restrictive setting. (See Feb. 22, 2006 Monitor's\n318 Report at 1, 14 (noting that District *318 had made insufficient progress on the waiver's amendment, including\nfailure to retain a consultant as promised in September 2005).)\n11. Residential placements for many class members are also unsuitable in other respects. The Court Monitor has\nconsistently found that a quarter or more of class members reviewed during the past two years live in homes that\nare not clean, safe, and environmentally pleasant. (See Sept. 24, 2006 Monitor's Report at 19 (one-third of class\nmembers reviewed \"d[o] not live in clean, safe or environmentally pleasant homes\"); June 22, 2006 Monitor's\nReport at 16 (26% of class members reviewed \"do not live in clean, safe, and pleasant conditions\"); Nov. 3, 2005\nMonitor's Report at 2, 11 (50% of homes reviewed between October 2004 and September 2005 did not evidence\n[45]\nclean and safe environments).)  As part of the ninety-day plan, seven sites with histories of poor performance\nand one site at which residents were placed at continuing risk of neglect were selected for remedial effort. (Feb.\n22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 5.) At least three of these substandard homes remained open as of June 2006.\n(June 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 10.)\n12. Nursing home placements also remain problematic. In 2001, defendants adopted a policy and procedure\nestablishing criteria for the use of nursing homes, as required by the 2001 Plan. (Defs.' Ex. 74; see Special\nMaster's Report & Recommendation Regarding Nursing Home Admissions for Class Members [\"Special Master's\nNursing Home Report\"] at 3; 2001 Plan ¶ A.2.b.i.) Notwithstanding this policy, which the Special Master has found\nto be reasonable as written (Special Master's Nursing Home Report at 5), defendants have continued to place\nclass members inappropriately in nursing homes. (See Pls.' Ex. 13 at 2 (eight of fourteen class members residing\nin nursing home or acute care hospitals in 2001 were inappropriately placed); Pls.' Ex. 14 (class member\ninappropriately placed in a nursing home in 2002); Pls.' Ex. 15 (same in 2003); Sept. 24, 2006 Monitor's Report at\n25 (one of five class members in nursing homes reviewed in 2006 did not require nursing home care).) It is\nparticularly troubling that class members remain in nursing home placements even after those placements have\nbeen identified as inappropriate. For example, a class member identified as not requiring nursing home care in\nAugust 2001 and on three occasions thereafter still remained in the same nursing home placement a year later\nwith \"no indication that any actions ha[d] been taken to secure a more appropriate placement.\" (Pls.' Ex. 14; see\nalso Pls.' Ex. 15 (class member who had been ready for discharge from her nursing home placement since\nDecember 2001 remained in that placement in January 2003); Pls.' Exs. 17, 18 & Sept. 24, 2006 Monitor's\nReport at 25 (class member identified as needing to move out of his nursing home in the spring of 2006 remained\nthere as of September 2006).).\n\n13. Based on defendants' admission that they have failed to place consumers in the least restrictive setting;\ndefendants' identification, as part of the ninety-day plan, of at least thirty class members who needed to move to\n319 more appropriate and *319 integrated settings and at least forty-two class members who needed less restrictive,\nmore integrated day programs; and defendants' failure to implement an effective Medicaid waiver, the Court finds\nthat defendants have not complied with the Court's 1978 Order that all class members be provided with\n\"community living arrangements suitable to each, together with such community-based day programs and\nservices as are necessary to provide them within minimally adequate habilitation . . . in the least separate, most\nintegrated and least restrictive community settings.\" Evans., 459 F.Supp. at 484. Defendants' continued\ninappropriate placement of class members in nursing homes is also evidence of defendants' noncompliance with\nthis Court Order. (2001 Plan ¶ A.2.d.ii.; see also id. ¶¶ A.2.b.ii., A.2.b.iii.)\nB. Individual Support Plans\n1. Defendants are required, under the existing Court Orders, to develop and provide for each class member a\nwritten ISP based upon individualized assessments and formulated in accordance with professional standards\nand an individualized habilitation program designed in accordance with the ISP. Evans, 459 F.Supp. at 484-85; \nsee also Evans, Consent Order at 3-4 (June 25, 1981). ISPs must identify all services and supports required by\nclass members regardless of availability and must be reviewed at least annually. Id.; Evans, 459 F.Supp. at 485.\nPriority in the implementation of ISPs must be given to class members identified as assaultive, self-injurious, self-\nabusive, mentally ill, or having acute medical needs or identified needs for physical rehabilitation services. Evans,\nConsent Order at 6 (June 25, 1981). The existing Court Orders also require that individualized adaptive\nequipment be provided to class members who need such equipment, and that all class members be evaluated to\nassess their needs for such equipment. Evans, 459 F.Supp. at 489.\n2. Each of the foregoing Court Orders was incorporated into the 2001 Plan. (2001 Plan ¶¶ A.1.a.i., A.1.a.ii.,\nA.1.a.iii., A.1.a.viii.) The tasks identified in the Plan as necessary to implement these Orders require that ISPs\nidentify class members' service, support, and protection needs regardless of availability, that they be modified as\nneeds and circumstances change, and that they be implemented promptly (id. A.1.b.iv.); that the District develop\nprocedures and time frames for assessing class members' needs for the acquisition or repair of adaptive\nequipment (id. ¶ A. 1.b.vi.); and that such equipment be provided to consumers within sixty days from the date\nthe need is determined or, in the event that such equipment or repair services are not readily available due to\nspecial needs, as soon as possible. (Id. A.1.b.vi.)\n3. The agreed-upon measure of defendants' compliance with the foregoing Court Orders includes whether class\nmembers receive the services and supports identified in ISPs on a timely basis; whether ISPs provide for\nindividualized adaptive equipment, as needed; whether class members' needs for adaptive equipment are\nassessed within thirty days of a request; and whether adaptive equipment is provided or repaired within sixty\ndays from the date the need is determined. (Id. ¶ A. 1.d.iii.)\n4. ISPs are the means by which class members' constitutional right to habilitative care and treatment in the least\nrestrictive setting is implemented. The ISP \"serves as the single document that integrates all supports a person\nmay receive irrespective of where the person resides.\" (Defs.' Ex. 71 at 3.) The ISP includes measurable goals\n320 and objectives for meeting the person's preferences, choices, and desired outcomes and also \"addresses the \n*320 provision of safe, secure, and dependable supports that are necessary for the person's [well-being],\n[46]\nindependence, and social inclusion.\" (Id.)\n5. The Court Monitor has consistently found ISPs to be current for around 90% of class members reviewed.\n(Sept. 24, 2006 Monitor's Report at 5 (93% of ISPs reviewed were current); June 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 14\n(90% current); Mar. 31, 2005 Monitor's Report at 3 (83% current); Oct. 7, 2004' Monitor's Report at 7 (90%\ncurrent); July-Sept. 2003 Monitor's Report at 31 (90% current); July-Sept. 2002 Monitor's Report at 23 (95%\ncurrent).) These findings indicate that ISPs are being revised annually for most class members, as required by\nCourt Orders and the Plan.\n6. Serious problems nevertheless persist in implementing ISPs and thus in ensuring that class members actually\nreceive the services and supports they require. The Court Monitor repeatedly has found that ISPs are not\n\nimplemented as written in a substantial number of cases reviewed. (See Nov. 29, 2006 Monitor's Report at 3, 13\n(65% of ISPs reviewed not implemented fully as written); June 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 4 (45% of ISPs\nreviewed not implemented fully as written); Mar. 31, 2005 Monitor's Report at 12 (60% of ISPs not implemented\nas written).) Unless ISPs are implemented, class members do not receive the habilitative care and treatment to\nwhich they are entitled under the 1978 Consent Decree and subsequent Court Orders.\n7. Failure to fully implement ISPs as written is a problem that cuts across providers. Between July and October\n2006, the Court Monitor's office reviewed ISPs for 99 class members served by twenty-four different residential\nproviders. (Nov. 29, 2006 Monitor's Report at 13-24.) ISPs were not fully implemented as written for sixty-three of\nthe class members reviewed, who resided at sixteen of the twenty-four residential providers. (Id.)\n8. At the October 2006 hearing, defendants objected to \"full implementation\" as a measure of compliance given\nthe number of services and supports an ISP may require and the varying level of urgency of those services and\nsupports for a class member's well-being. (See Oct. 4, 2006 Hr'g Tr. at 94 (using the example that an ISP might\nrequire both that a class member receive insulin and that he be afforded an opportunity to go to the park).) The\nCourt Monitor responded to this concern in her November 2006 report, demonstrating that the services and\nsupports not provided to class members whose ISPs were found not to be fully implemented are indeed serious.\nIn fact, the services and supports most often found to be lacking included clinical assessments and lab work and\nhealth-related procedures. (Nov. 29, 2006 Monitor's Report at 13.) Other services and supports found to be\nlacking included one-to-one staffing required for protection from harm, transportation services, community-based\nemployment, and complete financial plans. (Id.)\n9. There is also evidence that ISPs may be inadequate for many class members. For example, 40% of the ISPs\n321 reviewed by the Court Monitor's office between July and September 2006 did not *321 include reasonable\ntraining goals and did not accommodate the individual's strengths and level of disability. (Sept. 24, 2006 Monitor's\nReport at 23; see also June 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 16 (36% of class members reviewed did not have\nreasonable and appropriately modified training goals).)\n10. MRDDA has developed a policy establishing guidelines for the proper and timely acquisition, replacement,\nmodification, and repair of adaptive equipment. (Defs.' Findings at 12; Defs.' Ex. 38.) Notwithstanding this policy,\nalmost 30% of class members reviewed by the Court Monitor's office between July and October 2006 who\nneeded adaptive equipment did not have it. The necessary equipment included such items as eyeglasses;\nwheelchairs; a raised toilet seat, bars for the tub, and a shower, seat; hearing aids; electronic communication\ndevices; and dentures. (Nov. 29, 2006 Monitor's Report at 13, 25-27.) In some instances, class members had\nbeen without needed equipment for more than a year. (See, e.g., id. at 25 (class member fitted for eyeglasses in\nJune 2005 still did not have them as of September 2006), at 26 (class members still did not have a sport\nwristband fourteen months after occupational therapist recommended it).) The twenty-one class members who\ndid not have needed adaptive equipment were served by twelve different providers. (Id. at 25-27.)\n11. Defendants' failure to fully implement ISPs, as required under the 2001 Plan, is evidence of defendants'\nnoncompliance with the Court's Orders regarding ISPs. (See 2001 Plan ¶¶ A.1.b.iv., A.1.d.iii.) The failure to fully\nimplement ISPs affects a large proportion of class members served by many different providers, and often\nimplicates class members' health and safety needs. Problems with implementation of ISPs have been well\ndocumented since at least March 2005 and have continued throughout 2006. The Court finds that defendants'\nnoncompliance in this regard has been systemic, serious, and continuous. The Court also finds that defendants\nhave failed to comply with the Court's Orders regarding adaptive equipment.\nC. Case Management\n1. The existing Court Orders require defendants to \"[p]rovide all necessary and proper monitoring mechanisms to\nassure that community living arrangements, programs and supportive community services of the necessary\nquantity and quality are provided and maintained.\" Evans, 459 F.Supp. at 485. Defendants must recruit, hire, and\ntrain \"a sufficient number of qualified community staff to prepare individual exit and community habilitation plans\nfor each [class member] . . . and to assist in the execution of the responsibility to create, develop, maintain, and\nmonitor the community living arrangements, programs and other services required.\" Id. at 486. In particular,\ndefendants must maintain enough case manager positions to meet the required case manager to client ratio. \n\nEvans, Consent. Order at 5 (Feb. 8, 1983); see also Evans, 1996 WL 451054, at *6. Defendants must also\nensure that appropriate training programs for staff, including case managers, are developed and implemented.\nSee Evans, Consent Order at 13 (Feb. 8, 1983); Evans, Consent Order at 3 (June 25, 1981); Evans, 459.\nF.Supp. at 489. Each of these Court Orders is incorporated into the 2001 Plan. (2001 Plan ¶¶ A.3.a.ii., D.1.a.ii.,\n[47]\nD.1.a.iii.)\n322 *322 2. The tasks identified in the 2001 Plan as necessary for defendants to come into compliance with the\nforegoing Court Orders include developing \"procedures to ensure that case managers are informed of\nrecommendations made as a result of all quality assurance/quality improvement activities, including incident\ninvestigations, to enable them to monitor the implementation of the recommendations\" (2001 Plan ¶ D. 1.b.i.);\nproviding for a case manager to client ratio of one to thirty, or even lower depending upon the intensity of\nconsumer needs (id. ¶ D.1.b.ii.); ensuring that all case managers \"receive competency-based training to carry out\ntheir responsibilities prior to being assigned responsibility for individual consumers\" (Id.); and requiring case\nmanagers \"to conduct a minimum of eight monitoring visits a year and [to] file reports regarding compliance with\nISPs and health/safety issues based on these visits.\" (Id. ¶ D. 1.b.iii.)\n3. As part of the 2001 Plan, the parties agreed that the measure of defendants' compliance with these Court\nOrders would be whether case managers and their supervisors have successfully completed the required\ncompetency based training (id. ¶ D. 1.d.i.); whether case managers participate in the development of ISPs for all\nconsumers on their caseloads (Id.); whether case managers ensure that consumers receive all of the services\nand supports identified in their ISPs, and document and attempt to resolve problems encountered in terms of\naccess to, or the quality or timeliness of, such services and supports (id. ¶ D.1.d.ii.); whether case managers\nfollow up when a consumer has been the subject of an incident or recommendation for corrective or preventative\naction to ensure that appropriate actions for the safety and protection of the consumer are implemented (id. ¶\nD.1.d.iii.); and whether defendants maintain the required one to thirty case manager to class member ratio. (Id. ¶\nD.1.d.iv.)\n4. Defendants have consistently maintained the required case manager to class member ratio under the 2001\nPlan.\n5. Despite having what the Court Monitor has described as some of the smallest caseloads in the country (Nov.\n3, 2005 Monitor's Report at 14), MRDDA case managers have consistently failed to visit clients eight times per\nyear, as required under the Plan. In November 2005, the Court Monitor reported that a review of a year's worth of\nrecords for eighty-five class members found evidence of the required eight visits for only 39% of class members\nreviewed. (Id. at 15.) Monitoring tools documenting the required eight visits had been completed for only 31% of\n[48]\nclass members reviewed.  (Id.) Seven months later, in June 2006, the Court Monitor again found that\n323 monitoring tools documenting the required eight visits had been completed for only 30% of the sixty-three *323\n[49]\nclass members reviewed.  (June 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 13.) A total of twenty-four case managers were\nresponsible for the 70% of class members reviewed for whom documentation of the required eight visits was\nlacking. (Id.) Data provided by the District in response to the Court Monitor's draft. June 2006 report confirmed\nthese findings on a broader scale. MRDDA data for 657 class members indicated that only 27% of class\nmembers had eight monitoring tools completed. (Id. at 13-14.) More' recently, the Court Monitor's office and the\nQuality Trust reviewed case management services provided to 222 randomly selected class members and found\nthat eight visits per year had been documented for 68% of the class members reviewed. (Sept. 24, 2006\nMonitor's Report at 22.) Although this is certainly an improvement, approximately one-third of the class members\n[50]\nreviewed did not receive the required eight visits. (Id.)\n6. Case managers have also failed to ensure that class members' ISPs are implemented as written. See supra\nsection III.B. ¶ 6.\n7. There is also evidence that case managers fail to take appropriate action when a class member has been the\nsubject of an incident. Although serious incident reports had been filed for thirty-nine of the eighty-five class\nmembers reviewed by the Court Monitor's office in late 2005, the case manager's notes referenced the serious\nincident only about half of the time. (Nov.. 3, 2005 Monitor's Report at 4, 15.)\n\n8. Defendants' performance with respect to case manager training is also deficient. Defendants highlight the\navailability of training from MRDDA and through the Health Partnership and emphasize that 85% of case\nmanagers who monitor class members have completed training in at least seven of MRDDA's eight cord training\nareas (i.e., adaptive equipment, behavior support, incident management, ISPs, medical and dental, most\nintegrated settings, psychotropic medications, and quality assurance). (Defs.' Findings at 15; see also Defs.' Ex.\n48.) Under the 2001 Plan, however, defendants are required to ensure that \"all case managers receive\ncompetency-based training to carry out their responsibilities prior to being assigned responsibility for individual\nconsumers.\" (2001 Plan ¶ D.1.b.ii. (emphasis added).) Yet, of the twenty-six case managers included in\ndefendants' exhibit, only half had completed the required trainings in all eight areas. (Defs.' Ex. 48.) Moreover,\naccording to MRDDA's training report for April to June 2006, 13% of case managers have not been trained in\nadaptive equipment, ISPs, or most integrated settings (U.S. Ex. 19 at 3, 12, 17); 14% have not been trained in\n324 medical and *324 dental or psychotropic medications (id. at 14, 20); 15% have not been trained in behavior\nsupport plans or quality assurance (id. at 6, 22); and 36% have not been trained in incident management. (Id. at\n9.)\n9. Defendants' failure to ensure that case managers complete the required number of visits and that they take\nappropriate action when a class member has been the subject of a serious incident is evidence of defendants'\nnoncompliance with Court's Orders regarding monitoring and case management. (See 2001 Plan ¶¶ D.1.b.iii.,\nD.1.d.) Defendants' noncompliance in this area affects a significant proportion of class members. Moreover, the\nCourt finds that this noncompliance is serious given case managers' role as \"the principal link between the\nindividuals being served and the systems involved in the provision of services.\" (Defs.' Ex. 63.) As the Court\nMonitor recently remarked, case managers are the front line safeguards for the client, and eight visits should be\nsome guarantee that someone is looking at the care that is being provided, and, when it is negligent or\nincomplete or ineffective, is raising that concern to the appropriate official. (Oct. 5, 2006 Hr'g Tr. at 25.)\nDefendants' failure to ensure that case managers are properly trained before receiving caseloads is also\nevidence of defendants' noncompliance with the Court's Orders (see 2001 Plan ¶¶ D.1.b.ii., D.1.d.i.), as is the\ncase managers' failure to ensure that ISPs are fully implemented. (See id. 4 D.1.d.ii.)\nCONCLUSION\nAll of the Court Orders that plaintiffs seek to enforce through this action were agreed to by defendants.\nDefendants also agreed to the terms of the 2001 Plan. In consenting to the entry of these Orders, and in agreeing\nto the provisions of the Plan, defendants admitted 00 in 1978, 1981, 1983, and again in 2001 00 that the existing\n97 97\nsystem for persons with developmental disabilities in the District of Columbia was seriously flawed. Indeed,\ndefendants stipulated to violations of class members' constitutional rights in the 1978 Consent Order and\nacknowledged, in the factual findings accompanying the 2001 Plan, that their service delivery system was\n\"broken\" and in need of being \"redefined and rebuilt.\" In the Plan, defendants agreed to undertake an ambitious\n(if not totally unrealistic) course of action to remedy these deficiencies and to come into compliance with the\nexisting Court Orders. Although the Plan itself was not court-ordered, defendants agreed that their compliance\nwith the underlying Orders would be measured based on their ability to achieve the outcomes specified in the\nPlan and that their failure to, perform the tasks identified in the Plan would be evidence of noncompliance with\nthose Orders.\nFollowing the Plan's adoption, defendants have made significant progress in some areas, including the\ndevelopment of policies and procedures to guide the various components of their service delivery system. The\nproblem is that defendants have been unable to effectively implement these policies and procedures in many\nimportant respects and have failed to achieve desired outcomes for many class members in the critical areas of\nhealth, safety, and welfare.\nAs a result of these failings, class members continue to be placed in inappropriate and overly restrictive\nresidential and day programs, rather than in the least restrictive, most integrated settings. Provider and MRDDA\nstaff, including case managers, are not adequately trained, and case managers do not visit class members with\n325 the required frequency and do not adequately address deficiencies in class members' *325 care. In many\n\ninstances, class members do not receive the needed services and supports that have been identified in their\nISPs. Protocols necessary to protect class members' health and safety, such as feeding, positioning, and\nbehavioral plans, are routinely not followed. Health risks are not adequately assessed and monitored for many\nclass members, and recommendations by health care providers are not implemented in a timely manner. While\nincidents of abuse and neglect of class members persist, defendants have failed to ensure that these and other\nserious incidents, including class member deaths, are investigated in a timely manner, that the results of such\ninvestigations are shared with providers, and that recommended corrective and preventive actions are\nimplemented. Defendants have also compromised the monitoring process by altering death investigation reports.\nDefendants' progress in achieving compliance with the Court's Orders has been impeded by a lack of consistent\nleadership within MRDDA, which is reported to have had ten different directors or acting directors in the past\neight years. Progress has also been impeded by a lack of inter-agency coordination within the District's\ngovernment. This is particularly true with respect to defendants' implementation of the Medicaid waiver, which is\nadministered by the MAA. The Court Monitor has also noted MRDDA's lack of authority to enforce sanctions\nagainst providers with a record of poor performance. These types of bureaucratic difficulties led the Court to\nrequire Mayor Williams to assign a Deputy Mayor or other senior official to coordinate the efforts of all District\nagencies with responsibility for actions necessary to achieve compliance with the 2001 Plan. Despite these\nefforts, the underlying systemic problems remain unsolved.\nBased on these findings of fact, the Court concludes that there has been systemic, continuous, and serious\nnoncompliance with many of the Court's Orders. Failures have occurred throughout defendants' service delivery\nsystem, from providers and case managers to the managerial level. Nor are these failures limited to a few\nisolated providers or case managers. For these reasons, the Court finds that defendants' noncompliance has\nbeen systemic. Defendants' noncompliance has also been continuous: defendants' service delivery system has\nbeen wholly inadequate, as documented by the Court Monitor and others, for many years. Finally, plaintiffs and\nplaintiff-intervenor have presented compelling evidence that defendants' failures jeopardize class members'\nhealth, safety, and welfare, contributing to deaths and hospitalizations that defendants' own investigators have\nfound were preventable. The Court therefore finds that defendants' noncompliance with the Court's Orders is\nserious.\nThe Court notes that the findings made herein are based on the record as of November 2006, before Mayor\nFenty took office. As a result, they do not take into account more recent improvements that have been made by\nthe Fenty administration and under the leadership of Kathy Sawyer, who has agreed to stay on as the Interim\nDirector of the newly-created DDS until June 1, 2007. (Feb. 5, 2007 Declaration of Kathy E. Sawyer [\"Sawyer\nDeer] ¶ 6.) These improvements, largely attributable to Ms. Sawyer's capable leadership, include the successful\nmodification of seven Medicaid waiver rules to be more flexible in meeting consumers' needs, including\ncoordination between the former MRDDA and MAA over a two-month period to finalize the modifications (id. ¶¶\n19-20); the development and execution of a long-contemplated interstate compact needed to facilitate\n326 participation in the *326 waiver by providers and consumers residing in the State of Maryland (id. ¶ 21); and the\nrevision of the scope of work in the District's contract with Georgetown to increase the physician and nursing\nhours devoted to the Health Partnership project. (Id. ¶ 12.) Moreover, to address concerns about the credibility of\ndeath investigations performed by the Incident Management and Enforcement Unit (\"IMEU\") (formerly the IMIU)\nfollowing the expiration of the Columbus contract, the District has made a commitment to implement an\nindependent death investigation process both to re-do certain death investigations previously completed by the\nIMEU and to conduct future death investigations. (Defs.' Notice of Filing at 2; Feb. 6, 2007 Hr'g Tr. at 18.) The\nDistrict is also negotiating to have serious incident investigations completed under the auspices of the District's\nOffice of the Inspector General, Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (\"MFCU\"). (Defs.' Notice of Filing at 2-3.) These\nrecent developments, which do not alter the Court's finding regarding defendants' noncompliance with Court\nOrders as of November 2006, are encouraging and will be highly relevant to the remedial phase of this action.\nWith respect to remedy, the plaintiffs contend that a receivership is the only appropriate remedy. The Court is not,\nat this time, prepared to endorse such an approach, for receivership is not strictly an issue of noncompliance with\ncourt orders. Rather, as a \"remedy of last resort,\" receivership \"should be undertaken only when absolutely\nnecessary,\" District of Columbia v. Jerry M., 738 A.2d 1206, 1213 (D.C.1999). The Court's determination whether\n\nother remedies are inadequate and whether receivership remains the only viable option to effectuate compliance\nwith court orders is to be guided by a number of factors, including\n(1) `whether there were repeated failures to comply with the Court's orders'; (2) whether further\nefforts to secure compliance would only lead to `confrontation and delay'; (3) whether leadership is\navailable which can `turn the tide within a reasonable time period'; (4) `whether there was bad\nfaith'; (5) `whether resources are being wasted'; and, (6) `whether a receiver can provide a quick\nand efficient remedy.'\nId. (quoting Dixon v. Barry, 967 F.Supp. 535, 550 (D.D.C.1997)). Although it is clear based on the tortured history\nof this case that there have been repeated failures to comply with the Court's Orders, this determination is in no\nway determinative of the question whether plaintiffs are correct in their argument that a receivership should be\nimposed. As is clear from the case law, a host of other considerations bear on this issue, and only now, at the\nremedial stage, is it appropriate for the Court to turn to those considerations.\nIn order to assist the Court in its consideration of these factors, it will enlist the assistance of the Special Masters,\nwho have ably served in this capacity for many years, to make findings and recommendations to the Court that\naddress, inter alia, the current status of defendants' compliance, what are the available options for curing the\nidentified deficiencies, and whether a receivership is the most effective and efficient remedy available to the\nCourt. To the extent that the Court must revise the Order of Reference entered on October 11, 1995, the parties\nshall, in consultation with the Special Masters, submit by April 20, 2007, a new order that conforms to Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 53 and allows the Special Masters to perform the functions delineated herein. In addition,\nthe parties, with the assistance of the Special Masters, must propose a plan for how they will proceed with\n327 respect to *327 the remedy phase. In particular, the parties must consider whether they wish to engage in\ndiscovery and/or present evidence to the Special Masters in order to permit them to make findings and\nrecommendations to the Court. The parties shall submit a joint plan for the remedial phase of this litigation that\naddresses a schedule for proposed discovery, the need for an evidentiary hearing before the Special Masters,\nand/or a briefing schedule. This plan shall also be filed by April 20, 2007.\nIn sum, while the Court has found that plaintiffs' motion should be granted to the extent that they have sustained\ntheir burden as to liability, the daunting task of finding ways to remedy the problems still remains. In this regard,\nthe Court expects the parties to continue their prior efforts to resolve this matter so that the plight of the class\nmembers can be improved as expeditiously as possible, and they will not have to continue to await the outcome\nof this painfully lengthy and cumbersome litigation.\nORDER\nFor the reasons set forth in the accompanying Memorandum Opinion, plaintiffs' Motion to Find the Defendants in\nNoncompliance and to Appoint a Receiver [Dkt. # 809] is GRANTED IN PART on the issue of liability; and it is\nFURTHER ORDERED that plaintiff-intervenor's Motion for an Order to Show Cause Why Defendants Should Not\nBe Held in Contempt [Dkt. # 810] is DENIED.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] Mayor Fenty took office in January 2007 and was thereafter substituted as a named defendant. Between 1976\nand January 2007, a series of his predecessors in office were named. At the time the case was filed, other\nDistrict of Columbia officials were also named as defendants; however, those defendants are no longer parties.\n[2] Between July 1976 and January 1977, the United States participated in the case as an amicus curiae in\nsupport of plaintiffs.\n[3] At the same time that plaintiffs filed their receivership motion, the United States moved for an order to show\ncause why defendants should not be held: in contempt. The Court granted the latter motion to the extent that\n\ndefendants were ordered to submit a response. However, as discussed below, the Court has concluded that\ncontempt is not an appropriate mechanism to address defendants' deficient performance.\n[4] The exhibits submitted by the parties in support of their proposed factual findings include excerpts from the\ntranscripts of various Court hearings in this case and from various reports by the Court Monitor. For ease of\nreference, the Court has cited to the hearing transcripts and Court Monitor reports directly, rather than to the\nparties' exhibits. The Court also notes that certain exhibits submitted by plaintiff-intervenor have been filed under\nseal to prevent the disclosure of class members' names and other identifying information.\n[5] The conditions challenged by plaintiffs included the lack of comprehensive habilitation programs to meet\nindividual needs of residents; the unsafe, unsanitary, and unpleasant condition of the Forest Haven facilities;\ninadequate staffing, lack of training, and abuse of residents by staff; inadequate medical, dental, and mental\nhealth care and nutrition; inadequate recordkeeping; lack of after-care and rehabilitation programs and vocational\ntraining for former residents; and inadequate funding.\n[6] The Court explained that habilitation \"includes, but is not limited to, programs of formal, structured education\nand training\" and that receiving habilitative care and treatment in the alternative least restrictive of individual\nliberty \"means living as normally as possible and receiving appropriate individualized services in the community\nin the least separate, most integrated and least restrictive settings.\" Id.\n[7] The Court ordered defendants to provide class members with such community living arrangements, programs,\nand services \"at the earliest possible opportunity\" but also set targets for the number of residents to be\ndeinstitutionalized in each of the next three Fiscal Years. Id. at 487-88.\n[8] This unpublished Consent Order will hereafter be cited as \"Evans, Consent Order at ___ (June 25, 1981).\"\nCitations to other unpublished opinions and orders in this case will follow a similar format.\n[9] The 1983 Order required defendants to maintain a case manager to class member ratio of one to sixty. Evans,\nConsent Order at 5 (Feb. 8, 1983). This ratio was later reduced to one to thirty. (See 2001 Plan for Compliance\nand Conclusion of Evans v. Williams at 37.)\n[10] Also in July 1990, the plaintiffs petitioned the Court for immediate enforcement of the 1978 Consent Order to\nprevent defendants from placing certain class members in a nursing home rather than in smaller,\ncommunitybased placements. The Court denied the motion in November 1990, finding the nursing home\nplacement to be appropriate for the class members in light of their medical needs. Evans v. Barry, 1990 WL\n201488, at *1 (D.D.C. Nov.28, 1990).\n[11] In November 1990, while the contempt motions were pending, the United States sought to compel the Court\nto act on the pending motions by filing a petition for a writ of mandamus in the D.C. Circuit. The Circuit Court\ndenied the petition in 1991, finding that the two-month delay between the completion of briefing on the sanctions\nmotion and the filing of the mandamus petition was \"not sufficient to establish that [the United States] ha[d] a\n`clear and indisputable right' to issuance of the writ.\" In re United States, No. 90-5371, 1991 WL 17225, at *2\n(D.C.Cir. Feb.11, 1991).\n[12] In addition to seeking an order requiring defendants to remedy these problems and the appointment of a\nSpecial Master, the plaintiff parties also requested that the Court order defendants to prepare and file a Medicaid\nHome and Community-Based Services waiver request to enable the District to obtain financial support for\nservices so that class members could live in less restrictive settings at substantial savings to the District.\n[13] The Court also identified as additional areas of concern the provision of adequate medical, dental, and health\nservices; the provision of adequate funding for the Court Monitor; and the safeguarding of class members'\npersonal funds. (Id. at 6-7.)\n[14] The Special Master also recommended that defendants be required to apply to the Health Care Financing.\nAdministration for a Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services waiver as part of the remedial plan.\nBecause defendants had submitted a waiver application by the time the Court adopted the 1996 Plan, however,\nthe waiver was not included in that Court-ordered Plan. Id. at *3.\n\n[15] Plaintiffs thereafter moved for sanctions under the 1996 Plan, and the Court ultimately granted the motion,\nordering defendants to pay approximately $5 million in fines based on their failure to comply with the purgation\nconditions of the 1996 Plan and failure to purge the 1995 and 1996 findings of contempt. Evans, Judgment (Feb.\n10, 1999), 35 F.Supp.2d 88. The imposition of contempt fines was later reversed by the D.C. Circuit on the\nground that the fines amounted to a criminal sanction that could not be imposed without a criminal trial. Evans v.\nWilliams, 206 F.3d 1292 (D.C.Cir.2000).\n[16] Mr. Sundram was appointed as Co-Special Master in February 2001. Evans, Order (Feb. 20, 2001).\n[17] In November 2000, shortly before these agreements were submitted for Court approval, the Court entered an\nOrder granting the parties' joint motion for the appointment of an independent Court Monitor. Evans, Order\nRegarding the Appointment of an Independent Court Monitor (hereinafter \"Appointment Order\") (Nov. 21, 2000).\nThe 1978 Consent Order had required defendants to retain a Court Monitor (then known as the Developmental\nDisabilities Professional) but provided that the Monitor would report to the Director of the District's Department of\nHuman Resources. Evans, 459 F.Supp. at 485. To comply with the Consent Order, defendants had hired a Court\nMonitor through a contract with a community provider, with the result that the person employed as the Court's\nMonitor was also employed as a contractor of the District. Evans, Appointment Order at 1 (Nov. 21, 2000).\nFinding this contractual arrangement to be inappropriate, the Court created an independent Court Monitor's office\nthat was to be directly responsible to the Court. Id. at 2. The Order specified that the duties of the Court Monitor\nwere to include observing, monitoring, reporting findings, and making recommendations to the parties, the\nSpecial Master, and the Court regarding implementation of the Court's Orders, and in order to perform these\nduties, the Monitor was granted broad access \"to the persons, residences, facilities, buildings, programs,\nservices, documents, records, personnel and materials the Monitor deems necessary or appropriate in\nperforming [her duties].\" Id. at 4-5.\n[18] The Plan set three threshold levels of compliance: \"full\" (95%) compliance, \"high\" (90%) compliance, and\n\"significant\" (80%) compliance, and indicated that the standard of compliance applicable to a particular set of\nCourt Orders was dependent upon the nature of the interest at stake and the degree to which the defendants'\nnoncompliance affected that interest. (2001 Plan at 7-8.)\n[19] The Court specified that such efforts were to include the development of necessary memoranda of\nunderstanding among agencies; the development of appropriate policies and procedures; the publication of rules\nand regulations; the drafting and presentation of legislation to the City Council; monitoring provider agency\ncompliance with performance expectations set forth in licensure, certification, or contractual agreements; and the\ndevelopment of effective procedures for the enforcement of laws, rules, and regulations as needed to implement\nthe District's obligations under the 2001 Plan. Id. at 2.\n[20] The residential component of the ninety-day plan targeted nine residential sites with histories of poor\nperformance or with residents capable of greater independence. (Feb. 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 5.) The\nparties agreed that all residents at these sites, including class members and non-class members, should be\nrelocated to more appropriate settings. (Id. at 6.)\n[21] Plaintiff-intervenor argued that a contempt finding would increase the remedial options available to the Court,\nnoting that possible contempt sanctions included admonishment, ordering specific performance of existing Court\nOrders, issuing additional orders, appointing a monitor and/or a master, and imposing a scheme of fines, as well\nas appointing a receiver. (Pl. Intervenor's Resp. to the Ct.'s Order of June 29, 2006 at 3-4.) As plaintiff-intervenor\nacknowledged, however, the Court has already appointed a monitor and two masters in this case, and the Court's\nprior effort to impose a scheme of fines was struck down by the D.C. Circuit. See Evans, 206 F.3d at 1294-97.\nMoreover, there is little reason to believe that the imposition of fines will ensure compliance with the myriad\nrequirements of the 2001 Plan and existing Court Orders. Accordingly, the Court will deny plaintiff-intervenor's\nmotion.\n[22] These dates were later extended at the parties' request:\n[23] Judge Facciola noted that whether the exhibits in fact proved what plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor claimed\nthey proved was a different question that went to weight, not admissibility. (Id.)\n\n[24] The DDS was established by emergency legislation on December 20, 2006. Developmental Disabilities\nServices Management Reform Emergency Amendment Act of 2006, § 103. The DDS was created as a separate\nCabinet-level agency to serve consumers formerly served by the MRDDA and the Rehabilitation Services Agency\n(\"RSA\"), another entity within the District's Department of Human Services. See id. §§ 105(1), (2). Responsibility\nfor MRDDA consumers was transferred to DDS immediately upon its creation. The legislation contemplates that\nresponsibility for RSA consumers will be transferred to DDS no later than June 30, 2007. See id.\n[25] To the extent that defendants contend that they are no longer bound by certain provisions of the 1978\nConsent Order contained in the section of that Order captioned \"Interim Operation of Forest Haven\" (see Defs.'\nFindings at 4 nn. 5 & 6, 11 n. 9, 16 n. 14), that argument is incorrect. Each of the provisions that defendants\ncontend \"no longer relate[s] to the current system of community care\" (id. at 4 n. 5) was incorporated into the\n2001 Plan as a \"specific provision of [the] outstanding Court Orders that must be complied with.\" (2001 Plan at 6\n(emphasis added).) Having reaffirmed their obligations under these Orders in 2001, nearly a decade after Forest\nHaven was closed, defendants cannot be heard to argue that the Orders apply only to the operation of that\nfacility.\n[26] The Court also notes that the distinction that defendants seek to draw between \"tasks\" and \"outcome criteria\"\nis illusory in many instances as the tasks and outcome criteria associated with a particular group of Court Orders\noften overlap. (Compare, e.g., 2001 Plan ¶ A.1.b.iv. (task requiring that a consumer's Individual Service Plan\nidentify the services and supports needed by the consumer and that Plan be implemented promptly), with id. ¶\nA.1.d.iii. (outcome criterion requiring that consumers receive the services and supports identified in their\nIndividual Support Plans in a timely manner); 2001 Plan ¶ A.3.b.ii. (task requiring defendants to develop and\nimplement an ongoing training program for staff working within defendants' service delivery system in order to\ndevelop the skills and competencies required to provide services meeting applicable standards), with id. ¶\nA.3.d.ii. (outcome criterion requiring that staff employed by the District and provider agencies have attended\nrequired training programs and statisfactorily demonstrated competence in the skills required for the positions\nthey hold).)\n[27] Defendants made certain evidentiary objections to the Court Monitor's reports relied on by plaintiffs and\nplaintiff-intervenor in support of their proposed findings. (See generally Defs.' Objections (Court Monitor reports\nproffered by plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor as exhibits included in chart of exhibits to which defendants\nobjected).) As noted above, however, those objections were overruled by Judge Facciola, Evans, Mem. Order at\n2-3 (Aug. 30, 2006), whose rulings defendants agreed would be final. (See July 20, 2006 Hr'g Tr. at 29.)\n[28] It is worth noting that the method of assessing compliance with the outcome criteria set forth in the 2001 Plan\nis, in many instances, a review of a random sample of a specified percentage of class members. (See, e.g., 2001\nPlan at 20 (method of compliance includes review of \"a 10 percent random sample of consumers in large\ncongregate day programs and in residential programs to determine whether the placements comply with the\ncriteria and procedures adopted in compliance with the Plan\").)\n[29] The ISP \"serves as the single document that integrates all supports a person may receive irrespective of\nwhere the person resides.\" (Defs.' Ex. 71 at 3; see also Defs.' Ex. 12 at 24 (ISPs \"describe[] the services and\nsupport MRDDA provides to consumers\").) The ISP \"presents the measurable goals and objectives identified as\nrequired for meeting the person's preferences, choices, and desired outcomes\" and \"addresses the provision of\nsafe, secure, and dependable supports that are necessary for the person's [well-being], independence, and\nsocial inclusion.\" (Defs.' Ex. 71 at 3.)\n[30] Each quarter since at least November 2004, the Court Monitor's office has reviewed the health care provided\nto a subset of class members identified as having high health risks.\n[31] Similar deficiencies have been documented by defendants and their consultants in reports of mortality\ninvestigations and investigations of serious incidents involving class members. (See, e.g., U.S. Ex. 1 la at 12 (ISP\ndid not list many of class member's serious medical concerns, including his weight loss and anemia); U.S. Ex.\n21q (class member's cardiac condition was not adequately addressed in his Health Plan).)\n\n[32] The Plan does not incorporate the Court's Order regarding the appointment of an independent Court Monitor,\nwhich was entered just before the Plan was submitted for court approval.\n[33] Under MRDDA's policy an incident is \"[a]n event that results in harm or risk of harm to an. MRDDA\nconsumer.\" (Defs. Ex. 53 at 2.) A \"reportable incident\" is a significant event or situation involving a consumer that\nmust be reported to designated authorities within a provider agency for review and internal investigation. (Id.) A\n\"serious reportable incident\" is an incident that, due to its significance or severity, requires \"immediate notification\nto, and possible investigation by, external authorities, in addition to internal review and investigation by the\nprovider agency.\" (Id.)\n[34] MRDDA policy defines neglect as \"[t]he failure to provide sufficient, consistent, or appropriate services,\ntreatment, or care that harms or jeopardizes the customer's health, safety, or welfare, such as: (1) [t]he failure to\nreport or act on health problems of the customer or changes in his or her health condition; (2) [l]ack of attention to\nthe physical needs of a customer, including personal care, hygiene, meals or appropriate nutrition, shelter, and\nsafety; (3) [f]ailure to carry out a plan of treatment or care prescribed by a physician or health care professional;\n(4) [f]ailure to provide services or supports as indicated by the individual's plan of care; or (5) [f]ailure to provide\nproper supervision to the consumer as required within a plan or by a court.\" (Defs.' Ex. 53 at 6.)\n[35] Forty-three of the remaining substantiated serious incidents included in the Court Monitor's data involved\nserious physical injuries, and four involved serious medication errors. (Id. at 7.) It is possible that some of these\nincidents also involved instances of provider neglect. In a number of the IMIU reports that the parties have\nprovided to the Court, for example, investigations regarding class members' serious physical injuries have found\nevidence of negligence on the part of providers and provider staff in connection with those injuries. (See, e.g.,\nU.S. Ex. 21b (finding day program provider to have been negligent in ensuring that class member was kept safe\nfrom harm based on failure to provide class member with proper assistance in using the bathroom); U.S. Ex. 21c\n(finding provider and provider staff to have been negligent in connection with serious physical injury suffered by\nclass member who fell in the shower where staff failed to use a bath chair that had been purchased to prevent\ninjuries).)\n[36] The backlog of investigations of serious incidents is far more substantial for non-class members. (June 22,\n2006 Monitor's Report at 18 (reporting a backlog of 211 overdue incident reports, including six overdue death\nreports, for non-class members)); Pls.' Ex. 132 (backlog of 196 overdue investigations for non-class members as\nof May 2006); Feb. 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 13 (backlog of 298 overdue investigations, including 14 overdue\ndeath investigations, for non-class members); Nov. 3, 2005 Monitor's Report at 15 (backlog of 228 overdue\ninvestigation reports for non-class members). As the Court Monitor has recognized, \"[t]he lack of timely\ninvestigation into the serious reportable incidents filed regarding non-class members erodes the protection from\nharm for class members,\" who share the same residences and have the same staff as non-class members, as\n\"the failure to rectify the problem affecting one person in a residence exposes other people in the house to the\nsame risk.\" (Id. at 15-16.)\n[37] The Court Monitor has also commented on the lack of death and serious incident investigation reports\nreceived by her office on a number of occasions. (March 31, 2005 Monitor's Report at 15 (no Columbus\ninvestigations received by Court Monitor's office between September 2004 and March 2005); June 22, 2006\nCourt Monitor's Report at 8 (no IMIU investigation reports received by Court Monitor's office or Quality Trust\nbetween April 5, 2006 and June 1, 2006).)\n[38] The Court Monitor had filed an alert in May 2004, eight months before this class member's death, informing\nMRDDA that the class member's eating protocol and nutritionist-prescribed diet were not being followed. (Nov. 3,\n2005 Monitor's Report at 9.) Although MRDDA reported that the alert was resolved in May 2004, that was not the\ncase, as the subsequent death investigation revealed.\n[39] Of the fifty-eight providers whose staff had not been fully trained, forty-seven had completed training for less\nthan half of all direct support staff, and eleven had completed training for half or more of all such staff. (U.S. Ex.\n19 at 6-9.)\n\n[40] Although the Court Monitor regarded the termination of this provider agreement as appropriate, she raised\nconcerns about the manner in which the termination was carried out, which resulted in the, five residents being\nmoved without transition planning or preparation, including two class members who went to day programs not\nknowing that they would not be returning to the same residence. (Id. at 27-28.)\n[41] Additional placements of individuals targeted to move under the ninety-day plan had been made by October\n2006; however, the number of class members and other MRDDA consumers who were moved is disputed. (\nCompare Oct. 5, 2006 Hr'g Tr. at 29 (Court Monitor indicated that only three additional placements (for a total of\nsix) had been made), with id. at 59 (Interim MRDDA Administrator indicated that a total of fifteen individuals,\nincluding thirteen class members, had been moved).) Even if the correct number is fifteen, it is clear that the\nDistrict has still fallen far short in moving even the forty-six most needy MRDDA consumers who were identified in\nthe ninety-day plan for immediate placement.\n[42] D.C. Code § 7-1301.03(16) defines the term \"[l]east restrictive alternative\" as \"that living and/or habilitation\narrangement which least inhibits an individual's independence and right to liberty,\" including arrangements that\nmove an individual from \"[m]ore to less structured living,\" \"[l]arger to smaller facilities,\" \"[l]arger to smaller living\nunits,\" \"[g]roup to individual residences,\" \"[s]egregated from the community to integrated with community living\nand programming,\" and \"[d]ependent to independent living.\" According to defendants, approximately 80% of\nclass members are committed. (Defs.' Findings at 21.) Under D.C. law, persons committed to a facility are\nrequired to be reviewed in a court hearing annually to determine whether commitment should be continued,\nD.C.Code § 7-1304.11(a), including that commitment to the facility \"would be the least restrictive means of\nproviding habilitation.\" D.C.Code § 7-1303.04(b)(4). It is unclear, however, whether in making this determination\nthe Court considers all possible alternatives to individual's current living situation or only those alternatives that\nare presently available.\n[43] Plaintiffs contend that defendants' failure to place class members in the least restrictive setting is also\nevidenced by the fact that more than half of class members live in Intermediate Care Facilities for the Mentally\nRetarded (\"ICF/MRs\"), facilities that house and provide institutional care and services for up to eight individuals. (\nSee Oct. 5, 2006 Hr'g Tr. at 4-5 (366 out of 659 class members (55%) were living in ICF/MRs as of October\n2006); Defs.' Ex. 74 at 2 (defining ICF/MR).) Plaintiffs contend that, by definition, ICF/MRs are not the least\nrestrictive setting because the vast majority of class members are capable of receiving more individualized\nservices in a smaller, noninstitutional setting. (See Oct. 4, 2006 Hr'g Tr. at 22.) National trends with respect to the\nnumber of persons living in ICF/MRs versus the number of persons receiving noninstitutional services under the\nMedicaid Health and Community-Based Services waiver program provide some support for plaintiffs' position. \nSee Residential Services for Persons with Developmental Disabilities: Status and Trends Through 2005 at 4, 59\n(July 2006), available at http://rtc.umn.edu/ risp05 (noting that the number of people receiving noninstitutional,\ncommunity-based services under the waiver nationwide was more than four times the number of people living in\nICF/MRs as of June 30, 2005).\n[44] The waiver and its potential to assist defendants in meeting their court-ordered obligations have been\nrecognized by the parties since at least the mid-1990s, when the Special Master recommended that defendants\nbe required to submit a waiver application as part of the proposed 1996 Remedial Plan. Defendants submitted a\nwaiver application before the 1996 Plan was adopted by the Court; hence, this requirement ultimately was not\nincluded in that Plan. Evans, 1996 WL 451054, at *3.\n[45] Poor living conditions documented by the Court Monitor and MRDDA's own Office of Quality Assurance\ninclude, for example, one class member's \"rodent, cockroach and fly infested apartment with serious structural\ndamage\" (Feb. 22, 2006 Monitor's Report at 13) and another residence found to be dirty with rusty cooking\nappliances, broken and outdated furniture, loose and protruding bathroom tile, mildew, and a basement in\n\"deplorable condition\" with an inoperable furnace. (Pls.' Ex. 7.)\n[46] ISPs are to be developed by a planning team consisting, at a minimum, of the class member, his or her\nparent or guardian, if any, and the MRDDA case worker. (Id. at 4; see also Evans, 459 F.Supp. at 485.) The ISP\nplanning team may also include nutritionists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, psychologists, social\n\nworkers, or other clinicians; family members; direct care staff from the person's day, work, and residential\nprograms; and the person's attorney. (Defs.' Ex. 71 at 4-5.)\n[47] In addition, community placements must be regularly monitored by MRDDA and by the Developmental\nDisabilities Professional (now known as the Court Monitor) \"to ensure that the residential arrangements and\nprogramming provided are appropriate to the individual's needs,\" and the results of such monitoring must be\ndocumented. Evans, Consent Order at 8 (June 25, 1981).\n[48] Case managers are required to complete a monitoring tool for each client visit to document the visit. (Defs.'\nFindings at 14; Pls.' Ex. 97 at 3.) According to the Court Monitor, these monitoring tools are the only documents\nthat can be reviewed to determine compliance with case management requirements. (June 22, 2006 Monitor's\nReport at 13; see also Pls.' Ex. 97 at 3 (supervisors obtain signature pages of case managers' completed\nmonitoring tools to determine frequency of visits).) Thus, it cannot be conclusively determined from the data\nwhether a case manager is failing to visit the client the required number of times per year or is not completing the\nappropriate documentation. In either case, it cannot be concluded that defendants are fulfilling the requirements\nof the 2001 Plan with respect to client visits.\n[49] In response to the Court Monitor's draft June 2006 report, the District maintained that monitoring tools had in\nfact been completed for seven additional class members but were not reflected in the data the Court Monitor\nrelied upon because the tools had not yet been entered into MRDDA's computer system. (Id. at 13.) However, the\nCourt Monitor concluded, based on the information provided by the District, that eight monitoring tools had been\ncompleted for only one of the seven additional class members. (Id.)\n[50] Defendants assert that, effective January 1, 2006, MRDDA changed its case management policy to require\ncase managers to visit clients at least monthly for a total of twelve visits per year. (Defs.' Findings at 16; Defs.'\nEx. 52.) Defendants do not suggest that case managers are in compliance with this policy. Nor could they. The\nCourt Monitor's September 2006 report reflects that twelve case manager visits per year were documented for\nonly 50% of 100 randomly selected class members. (Sept. 24, 2006 Monitor's Report at 22.) As noted, one-third\nof the 222 class members reviewed by the Court Monitor's office and the Quality Trust did not even receive eight\nvisits.

We agree with appellant that the fine was a criminal sanction that\ncould not be imposed without a criminal trial; we also agree that the district court abused its discretion in refusing\nto modify the consent decree. We therefore reverse.\nI.\nThis case started back in 1976, when residents of Forest Haven, the District of Columbia's institution for the\nmentally retarded, brought a class action alleging a panoply of constitutional violations resulting from poor\nconditions at the facility. Named as defendants were the Mayor and four other District officials (collectively, the\n\"District\"), all sued in their official capacities. The United States soon intervened on the side of the plaintiffs.\nIn 1978, the parties agreed to a consent judgment that called for closing Forest Haven and placing its residents in\n\"community living arrangements.\" Over the next few years the district court entered additional consent decrees.\nIn 1983 it approved the order that underlies this dispute. That decree governs almost every aspect of the District's\ntreatment of the mentally retarded. In particular, it requires the District to place specified numbers of Forest\nHaven residents in community institutions and to \"insure that all vendors are paid for their goods and services no\nlater than thirty days following their submission of acceptable vouchers.\"\nBy the mid-1990s, the District was confronted with financial problems of \"horrendous proportions\" and faced \"its\nworst crisis in over a century.\" H.R.REP. No. 96, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. 4 (1995). It was running an annual deficit\nof over $600 million, and a congressional committee found that \"[t]he District of Columbia is insolvent: The City\ndoes not have enough cash to pay all of its bills.\" Id. at 5. The District began missing some of the payment\ndeadlines set out in the consent decree. In April 1995, on the motion of the plaintiffs, the district court issued an\norder to show cause why the defendants should not be held in contempt. It ultimately so held but did not impose\n\nsanctions. Instead, it appointed a special master to develop a remedial plan through which the defendants could\npurge themselves of contempt, and it ordered that the plan include \"specific monetary penalties for\nnoncompliance.\"\nThe special master completed her report in January 1996 and issued a supplemental report recommending\nprospective sanctions a few months later. The defendants objected, arguing that the prospective fines proposed\nwere \"unduly harsh and punitive\" and that delays in making payments were \"not due to any unwillingness to pay\nbut due to a cash short fall.\" But the district court adopted the master's proposed remedial plan with only slight\n1294 modifications. *1294 The plan provided that whenever the defendants failed to pay an invoice within thirty days of\nsubmission a fine equal to twice the amount of the invoice would be imposed. Services provided by some of the\nfacilities caring for the mentally retarded qualify for Medicaid reimbursement. Because the District made all\nMedicaid payments for each month at one time, and because the payments due to the care providers averaged\napproximately $2.8 million per month, a fine equal to twice the amount of any Medicaid arrearage would have\nbeen very large. The court therefore applied the doubling fines only to non-Medicaid payments. Late Medicaid\npayments, regardless of amount, were to result in a fine of $5,000 per day.\nThe District continued to miss payment deadlines, and in April 1997 the plaintiffs moved for the imposition of\nsanctions. While the sanctions motion was pending, the District sought to modify the consent decree so that it\nwould require that vendors be paid within 45 days, rather than 30 days. Its motion to that effect included affidavits\nfrom the District's financial officials explaining that cash flow problems required a 45-day payment cycle. The\ncourt referred both motions to the special master.\nThe master concluded that the motion for sanctions was unnecessary because the remedial plans made fines\nautomatic. She thought the fines were civil coercive sanctions, so the defendants were not entitled to the\nprotections of criminal procedures. Although she did not formally find that circumstances had changed so as to\nwarrant modifying the order as the defendants requested, she did recommend three changes to the schedule of\nsanctions which essentially, at least prospectively, gave the District the relief it sought. First, fines for missed\npayments would be forgiven unless the nonpayment continued until the 45th day. Second, fines for delays in non-\nMedicaid payments would be reduced to $1,000 per day, regardless of the amount of the payment, and third,\nfines for delays in Medicaid payments would be increased from $5,000 per day to $10,000 per day.\nThe District objected to the special master's report and demanded a jury trial. In Evans v. Williams, 35 F.Supp.2d\n88 (D.D.C.1999), the district court adopted the special master's factual findings. Although it disagreed with the\nmaster's conclusion that the fines were automatic (noting that automatic fines would amount to summary\npunishment for an indirect contempt, a violation of due process), it granted the plaintiffs' motion to impose fines.\nThe district judge agreed with the special master that the fines were civil rather than criminal. Therefore provision\nof criminal procedures was unwarranted, and the court rejected the District's objection that changed\ncircumstances had made the imposition of sanctions unjust. It also adopted the special master's conclusions with\nrespect to modification of the order and the remedial plan. But it modified the remedial plan only prospectively\nfrom the date of its decision, which was almost two years after the defendants had sought the modification.\nThe court ordered the District to pay $5,096,340 in fines, and the District appealed.\nII.\nThis case turns entirely on the proper characterization of the contempt fine. Was it civil or criminal? If the fine was\ncriminal then it may be imposed only if the District's noncompliance00which the District claims was practically\n97\nunavoidable00is proven beyond a reasonable doubt to be willful. See United States v. Rapone, 131 F.3d 188, 195\n97\n(D.C.Cir.1997). If it was civil the District would have had to show that compliance was impossible to avoid the\nsanction. Perhaps of even greater significance, if the judge's order is criminal in character (and the fine is\nserious), then the District is entitled to a jury trial. See Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194, 198, 88 S.Ct. 1477, 20\nL.Ed.2d 522 (1968).\n1295 Traditionally, whether a contempt is civil or criminal has depended on *1295 the \"character and purpose\" of the\nsanction. A sanction is considered civil if it is \"remedial, and for the benefit of the complainant. But if it is for\n\ncriminal contempt the sentence is punitive, to vindicate the authority of the court.\" Gompers v. Buck's Stove &\nRange Co., 221 U.S. 418, 441, 31 S.Ct. 492, 55 L.Ed. 797 (1911). There also has been a traditional distinction\nbetween mandatory and prohibitory orders. The \"paradigmatic coercive, civil contempt sanction ... involves\nconfining a contemnor indefinitely until he complies with an affirmative command.\" International Union, United\nMine Workers of America v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821, 828, 114 S.Ct. 2552, 129 L.Ed2d 642 (1994). On the other\nhand, a fixed term of imprisonment imposed retroactively to punish an act of disobedience is criminal. This\ndistinction has been extended to fines, so that \"a per diem fine imposed for each day a contemnor fails to comply\nwith an affirmative court order\" is civil, but an unconditional fine imposed \"after a finding of contempt is criminal if\nthe contemnor has no subsequent opportunity to reduce or avoid the fine through compliance.\" Id. at 829, 114\nS.Ct. 2552.\nThe District argues that the fines were indisputably not compensatory (a classic aspect of a civil fine), for they\nwere paid to the court and not at all calibrated to the damage caused by the District's conduct. Moreover, the\nfines, according to the District, were fixed and determinate; there was no opportunity to escape their\nconsequences by altering behavior, i.e., to purge them once they were imposed. In other words, the fines were\ndesigned primarily to punish past acts rather than coerce future conduct and therefore should be thought\n[1]\npunitive.\nAppellees argue instead that the fines should be seen as coercive and therefore civil in character because the\nschedule of prospective fines was announced in advance. The District therefore had the capacity to avoid the\nfines, so to speak to purge itself of contempt, by altering its conduct prior to the time the fines accrued. The\nUnited States makes a similar argument: the fines \"were imposed for each day or month in which the defendants\nfailed to comply with the 30-day payment requirement, and ended once the defendants complied with the\nrequirement.\" In effect, the government would treat the defendants' contempt as one ongoing systemic problem\nof noncompliance with the consent decree. Each missed bill payment deadline would be another instance of the\nongoing contempt. On this view the fines for missed bill payments were coercive sanctions that were imposed\nonly so long as the defendants remained in contempt and that stopped being imposed once the defendants\nbegan to comply.\nRecently the Supreme Court in Bagwell had occasion to struggle with the elusive distinction between civil and\ncriminal contempt fines. In Bagwell a state court had imposed fines of $52 million against the United Mine\nWorkers for repeated violations of an injunction prohibiting the union and its members from engaging in illegal\npicketing practices, including throwing rocks at employees and obstructing access to company facilities. The\ncourt had set forth a prospective schedule of fines, which it too had characterized as \"civil and coercive,\" saying\nthat payment \"would only be required if it were shown the defendants disobeyed the Court's orders.\" Id. at 824,\n114 S.Ct. 2552. The Supreme Court nevertheless held that the sanctions were criminal and that the union was\nentitled (due process) to the protections of criminal procedures.\nThe Supreme Court began its analysis by noting that the fines were not compensatory because they were paid to\nthe court and not the company that was injured by the union's conduct. Then, it recognized the futility of\n1296 distinguishing between *1296 coercing affirmative acts and punishing prohibited conduct (pointing out, for\nexample, that \"an injunction ordering the union: `Do not strike,' would appear to be prohibitory and criminal, while\nan injunction ordering the union: `Continue working,' would be mandatory and civil\"). Id. at 835, 114 S.Ct. 2552.\nNor did it attach significance to the fact that the trial court had prospectively announced a schedule of sanctions,\nreasoning that \"the union's ability to avoid the contempt fines was indistinguishable from the ability of any\nordinary citizen to avoid a criminal sanction by conforming his behavior to the law.\" Id. at 837, 114 S.Ct. 2552. It\nthought that the fines were most closely analogous to fixed, determinate criminal fines that the union had no\nchance to purge once imposed.\nAppellees' and intervenor's effort to lump together each District action or inaction in a continuous course of\nnoncompliance is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's Bagwell analysis. If their approach governed, the United\nMine Workers' contempt would have been treated not as a series of discrete acts but as an ongoing pattern of\nnoncompliance with the order to refrain from violence. Each fine would have been thought imposed not for a\nparticular violent act but as additional coercion (like a per diem fine) for a continuation of the ongoing contempt.\nAccordingly, drawing upon Bagwell, it is improper to regard the District as capable of purging itself of contempt by\n\npaying a bill before the thirtieth day00it simply was not in contempt until it failed to pay on the thirtieth day. Each\n97\nmissed payment was a separate violation of the consent decree and a separate act of contempt. And for each act\nof contempt, the District was subjected to a one-time determinate fine; once it was imposed, there was no\nopportunity to eliminate it through future compliance. To be sure, the District could have avoided liability had it\npaid each bill before the thirtieth day. But as the Bagwell Court pointed out, this is no different from any citizen's\nability to avoid punishment by conforming his conduct to the law.\n[2]\nAppellees also argue that the fines are not large enough to be scrutinized under Bagwell.  They do not suggest\nthat a fine of over $5 million is not \"serious\"00obviously it is. Instead, they contend that the many smaller fines that\n97\nmake up the $5 million should be evaluated separately. This overlooks the large size even of some of the\ncomponent fines (for example, a $104,600 bill paid on the 31st day produced a $209,200 fine). More\nfundamentally, it is at odds with the approach taken by Bagwell, which considered the amount of the total fine. \nSee id. at 837, 114 S.Ct. 2552 (\"The fines assessed were serious, totaling over $52 million.\") (emphasis added); \nsee also NOW v. Operation Rescue, 37 F.3d 646, 660 (D.C.Cir.1994) (Aggregate fine of $193,623 was \"large\nenough to invite our scrutiny under the principles enunciated in Bagwell.\").\nIn any event, it was the nature of the injunction itself, rather than the form or amount of the fines, that appears to\nhave been the key to the Court's determination that the contempt was criminal in character in Bagwell. The Court\ndescribed the injunction as establishing a \"detailed code of conduct,\" Bagwell, 512 U.S. at 836, 114 S.Ct. 2552,\nand it was that \"consideration\" that convinced the Court that the fines were criminal.\nThe union's sanctionable conduct did not occur in the court's presence or otherwise implicate the\ncourt's ability to maintain order and adjudicate the proceedings before it. Nor did the union's\ncontumacy involve simple, affirmative acts, such as the paradigmatic civil contempts examined in \nGompers. Instead, the Virginia trial court levied contempt fines for widespread, ongoing, out-of-\ncourt violations of a complex injunction. In so doing, the court effectively policed petitioners'\n1297 compliance with an entire *1297 code of conduct that the court itself had imposed. The union's\ncontumacy lasted many months and spanned a substantial portion of the State.\nId. at 837-38, 114 S.Ct. 2552.\nIn response to the District's claim that the order before us is just the same kind of complex injunction that was\nbefore the Court in Bagwell, appellees (and the intervenors) argue that we should see the consent decree as only\naddressing various simple discrete acts; in other words, they would disaggregate the decree. But, if anything, the\ndecree here is more farreaching than the Bagwell injunction which, after all, did not seek to control the union's\nbusiness. It only prohibited violence at a strike at one company. Here, by contrast, the decree governs the\nadministration of an entire governmental program in the District of Columbia. It prescribes a complete code of\nconduct00 originally covering everything from bill payments to staffing to air conditioning00 that the district court\n97 97\nhas enforced for years. Even the payment requirement has complex elements because the District paid over one\nhundred non-Medicaid providers each month.\nAppellees complain that if sanctions such as these were deemed criminal and not civil, it would be difficult for the\ncourt to manage litigation seeking institutional reform. That may well be so. Giving alleged wrongdoers the benefit\nof a hearing before a neutral factfinder00particularly a jury00is always in some sense an impediment to judicial\n97 97\npower. And it is not surprising that district courts around the country, reluctant to surrender part of their power to\n[3]\ncoerce obedience to their decrees, have resisted the logic of Bagwell.  But as the Supreme Court noted, there\nare countervailing considerations. When a district judge assumes the responsibility to regulate the activities of a\nlarge institution and then seeks to identify and punish violators of his or her injunction, he or she comes perilously\nclose to fusing the powers which our Constitution separates. See Bagwell, 512 U.S. at 831, 114 S.Ct. 2552\n(\"Unlike most areas of law, ... civil contempt proceedings leave the offended judge solely responsible for\nidentifying, prosecuting, adjudicating, and sanctioning the contumacious conduct.\"). The Court was not unaware\nthat its decision would lay \"burdens on courts' ability to sanction widespread, indirect contempts of complex\ninjunctions,\" id. at 838, 114 S.Ct. 255200 nor are we. Because the defendants were not given the benefit of\n97\n[4]\ncriminal procedures, the order imposing the fine must be reversed.\n\nIII.\nThere remains the propriety of the district court's refusal to modify the consent decree. The practical\nconsequence of this issue has been somewhat attenuated by the special master's decision to modify the fine\nstructure, but the question remains relevant because the fines were modified only prospectively. The District still\nfaces the possibility of being fined for late payments made between April 1997 (when it made the motion to\nmodify) and February 1999 (when the fine schedule was modified).\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) permits a court to modify a judgment or order when \"it is no longer\nequitable that the judgment should have prospective application.\" Appellant argues that under Rufo v. Inmates of\n1298 the Suffolk*1298County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 112 S.Ct. 748, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992), the district court should\nhave granted its motion to modify. Rufo held that the party seeking a modification need not make a \"clear\nshowing of grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions\"00a standard that had been applied since \n97\nUnited States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 119, 52 S.Ct. 460, 76 L.Ed. 999 (1932). It pointed out that flexibility is\nespecially important in institutional reform litigation: \"Because [consent] decrees often remain in place for\nextended periods of time, the likelihood of significant changes occurring during the life of the decree is\nincreased.\" Rufo, 502 U.S. at 380, 112 S.Ct. 748. In particular, \"[m]odification of a consent decree may be\nwarranted when changed factual conditions make compliance with the decree substantially more onerous.\" Id. at\n384, 112 S.Ct. 748. While a modification should not be granted because of \"events that actually were anticipated\"\nby the parties, the party seeking a modification need not show that the changed circumstances were\nunforeseeable. Id.\nTo decide whether the District's financial problems were a changed circumstance, we first must answer the\nantecedent question: changed relative to when? The District looks to the 1983 consent decree, the appellees and\nthe United States to the 1996 remedial plan. But the 1996 remedial plan was designed simply to implement the\nconsent decree and to address the district's failure to make payments in accordance with it. The substantive\nobligations imposed on the district all stem from the 1983 decree. Our focus might be different if the remedial\nplan had been based on a comprehensive reexamination of the obligations in the 1983 decree. In that case, it\nmight be thought that the District was obliged to make its claim of financial hardship then. But the aims of the\nremedial plan were more modest: the judge explained that its purpose was simply \"to bring the District into\ncompliance with its outstanding obligations.\" It is true that the judge also invited the parties to seek appropriate\nmodifications of the consent decree in light of changed circumstances. But even though the District did not in so\nmany words request relief from the 30-day payment requirement, it did object (repeatedly) to being sanctioned for\nlate payments, explaining that it expected to be unable to pay on time. In any event, the parties do not appear to\nhave regarded the remedial plan as a complete solution to all of the problems that had arisen under the consent\ndecree. They thought that the District's financial difficulties still might require a future solution. The special master\nnoted that the possibility of further modifications had been discussed, and the judge observed that the District\nwas in a time of \"transition\" and its ability to make timely payments might be contingent on the actions of\nCongress. We therefore think we must look at whether circumstances have changed since 1983 rather than at\nwhether they have altered only in the last few years.\nThe District makes the obvious point that no one in 1983 anticipated the District's insolvency or its crushing debt\nburden. And as Rufo explained, \"[f]inancial constraints may not be used to justify the creation or perpetuation of\nconstitutional violations, but they are a legitimate concern of government defendants in institutional reform\nlitigation and therefore are appropriately considered in tailoring a consent decree modification.\" Id. at 392-93, 112\nS.Ct. 748. Appellees respond that although this particular financial crisis was not contemplated, the parties\ncertainly had in mind the District's generic inability or refusal to pay the vendors00that was the very reason the 30-\n97\nday requirement was part of the consent decree. But Rufo's modification standard does not require absolute\nunforeseeability. It is enough that the parties did not actually contemplate the changed circumstances. And the\ncrisis of the 1990s was different in kind rather than degree. Moreover, the 30-day payment requirement likely was\nintended to protect the class members against bureaucratic neglect, not against the District's near-bankruptcy. In\n1299 truth, the consent *1299 decree was negotiated with the expectation that the District would be able to pay its bills.\nOnce it could not, circumstances had changed.\n\nThe appellees contend that even with the District's financial problems, a 30-day payment schedule is not\nunreasonable or onerous. But the District submitted affidavits to the contrary, and the district court seems at least\nimplicitly to have resolved this question in its favor, for the effect of its ruling is to give the District the benefit of a\n45-day payment schedule, albeit only after February 1999. The judge offered no reason why the District's relief\nfrom fines should not extend to the point at which it made the motion00nor can we think of one.\n97\nWe do not of course suggest that a party may be relieved from the obligation to comply with an injunction simply\nby making a motion for a modification. But here the District claimed that it could not comply, despite making a\ngood faith effort to do so. If true, this should have relieved it from liability. See Tinsley v. Mitchell, 804 F.2d 1254,\n1256 (D.C.Cir.1986) (\"If a party lacks the financial ability to comply with an order, the court cannot hold him in\ncontempt for failing to obey.\"). And the district court did not find that the District's claim was wrong. Instead, it\nadopted the master's report which simply pointed out that the District's financial situation was no worse than at\nthe time the remedial plan was adopted in 199600a fact that as we have explained is not relevant.\n97\nNor is the United States correct when it invokes the collateral bar rule of Walker v. City of Birmingham, 388 U.S.\n307, 87 S.Ct. 1824, 18 L.Ed.2d 1210 (1967). Walker provides that the invalidity of an injunction is not a defense\nto contempt, so that a party faced with an invalid injunction must have the injunction modified or vacated; he\ncannot simply ignore it. The theory behind that rule is rather obvious, but it does not extend to cases where a\nparty is faced with an injunction with which it is unable to comply. Walker cannot justify subjecting the District to\nliability for the period in which the district court was considering the modification motion.\nWe conclude that it was an abuse of discretion for the district court not to grant the District's motion retroactive to\nthe time at which it was made.\n* * *\nThe order of the district court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\nSo ordered.\n[1] The District does not challenge the per diem fines associated with late Medicaid payments (even to the extent\nof raising an impossibility defense). We therefore discuss only the doubling fines associated with non-Medicaid\npayments.\n[2] Neither the appellees nor the intervenors argue that, even if the fine is criminal, it is nevertheless \"petty\" and\ncould be imposed without a jury trial. Cf. Taylor v. Hayes, 418 U.S. 488, 94 S.Ct. 2697, 41 L.Ed.2d 897 (1974).\n[3]See, e.g., Crowe v. Smith, 151 F.3d 217, 221 (5th Cir.1998) (reversing order \"imposing serious criminal\nsanctions ... via a manifestly civil process\"); Mackler Productions, Inc. v. Cohen, 146 F.3d 126 (2d Cir.1998)\n(reversing a $10,000 punitive fine imposed without criminal procedures); Law v. NCAA, 134 F.3d 1025 (10th\nCir.1998) (reversing retroactively imposed per diem fines); In re E.I. DuPont De Nemours & Co.-Benlate\nLitigation, 99 F.3d 363 (11th Cir.1996) (reversing an over $13,000,000 punitive fine imposed without criminal\nprocedures).\n[4] Because we have determined that the District must be given a criminal trial, we do not address the argument\nthat the district court abused its discretion in refusing to consider the defense of impossibility.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

This \nCertification deals with Protection from Harm. The 2010 Plan establishes a threshold of “high” \ncompliance, generally exceeding 90%. \nThe Court has previously approved a Report and Recommendation from the Special \nMaster  finding  that  the  Defendants  had  achieved  compliance  with  five  of  the  12  criteria \ncontained in the 2010 Plan regarding Protection from Harm. (Dkt. # 1412, filed September 16, \n2013, regarding outcome criteria vi, vii, ix, x and xi).  \n                                                 \n1 2010 PLAN FOR COMPLIANCE AND CONCLUSION OF EVANS V. FENTY, Goal D. 1 (Document #1200), (“2010 Plan”); \nRelated Court Orders: 1978 Final Judgment and Order, sections I.2 and III.14.a. \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1457   Filed 04/04/14   Page 2 of 14\nOn January 31, 2014, the Director of the Department on Disability Services (\"DDS\") \nsubmitted a Certification of Compliance with the remaining seven criteria. As has been the case \nwith most of the certifications to date, much of the evidence of compliance is drawn from the \nresults of a joint monitoring process conducted by a team supervised by the Court Monitor with \nrepresentatives from the Quality Trust and DDS. The joint monitoring process was conducted \nfrom  mid-November  2013  through  mid-January  2014,  and  generally  examined  Defendants' \nperformance during the period June 1, 2013 to October 28, 2013. The team reviewed a random \nsample  of  26  investigations  of  Serious Reportable  Incidents  (“SRI”)  completed  during  this \nperiod, representing a 10% sample of such investigations. The 26 investigations involved 24 \nclass members and 12 provider agencies. In addition, over the Defendant's objection,2 the Court \nMonitor also obtained and reviewed survey reports from the District's Health Regulations and \nLicensing  Administration  (“HRLA”),  which  has  regulatory  responsibility  over  licensed \nproviders, for the period between October 2012 and October 2013. The Court Monitor submitted \na report on the joint monitoring findings on January 17, 2014, and an amended report on January \n31, 2014. (Appendices 1 and 2, to the Director's Certification of Compliance, “Joint Monitoring \nReport”) \nThe 2010 Plan also permits the District of Columbia to submit any additional relevant \nevidence drawn from various sources including their data systems, and licensing, certification \nand monitoring activities. (2010 Plan, ¶ 7) The Defendants have done so and included three \nappendices to the Certification of Compliance. (Appendices #18-20) \nReflecting the overall progress that has been made in meeting the requirements of the \n2010 Plan and the underlying court orders, Plaintiffs and Plaintiff-intervenor, the United States \nDepartment of Justice, (hereinafter “Plaintiffs”) generally concede that the evidence submitted \nby the Defendants supports a finding that the Defendants have met the compliance standard as to \nfive of the seven criteria covered by this Certification, and limit their objections to the remaining \ntwo criteria.  \n                                                 \n2 The essence of Defendants’ objection is that these documents extend the review period farther backwards from \nJune 1, 2013 to include a period during which Defendants had not claimed to be in compliance. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1457   Filed 04/04/14   Page 3 of 14\nSpecial Master's Findings and Conclusions \nIn this section, this report will discuss each of the seven criteria, summarize the evidence \nsubmitted, the Plaintiffs’ objection, if any, and the Special Master's findings, conclusions and \nrecommendations to the Court.  \ni.    All incidents (as defined in District of Columbia regulations and policies) are \nreported in accordance with the policy. Abuse, neglect and mistreatment are \nclearly prohibited by defendants’ policies and procedures. \nDistrict  law  specifically  prohibits  mistreatment,  neglect  or  abuse  in  any  form,  and \nrequires the reporting and investigation of all alleged instances of such behavior. (D.C. Law 2-\n137, codified as amended at DC Official Code §7-1301.01 et seq (2008 Repl.) The requirements \nof this law are implemented through the Incident Management and Enforcement Policy and the \nIncident  Management  and  Enforcement  Procedure  of  June  1,  2013.  (Appendix  #18  to  the \nDirector's  Certification  of  Compliance)  The  results  of  the  Joint  Monitoring  Questionnaire \nadministered by the monitoring team indicated that 96% of the Serious Reportable Incidents \nwere filed timely. The Joint Monitoring Report identifies one incident that occurred on July 18, \n2013 which had not been reported. (Joint Monitoring Report, p. 7) \nPlaintiffs agree that the evidence supports a finding of compliance with this criterion. \nDespite this concurrence, they expressed concern about a few incidents that surfaced in the \nMonitor's review of HRLA documents but which had not been reported as required by the laws, \npolicies and procedures cited above. Plaintiffs correctly note that the reporting of an incident is \nan essential first step not only for the correction of the specific underlying problem, but also for \npreventive measures that might be needed for other consumers in the DDS system.  \nDespite the occasional instances of noncompliance, the evidence on the whole supports a \nfinding of substantial compliance with this criterion.  \nii.   Family members and/or guardians, the Court Monitor and the Quality Trust \nare  notified  of  all  serious  incidents  (as  defined  in  the  District  of  Columbia \npolicies) within 24 hours of the defendants becoming aware of such incidents. \n During the joint monitoring process, the monitoring team attempted to contact family \nmembers, guardians and attorneys representing class members to determine whether they had \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1457   Filed 04/04/14   Page 4 of 14\nbeen  informed  of  SRIs  in  the  sample,  within  24  hours  of  discovery.  This  process  was \nunsuccessful in producing reliable information regarding the Defendants' level of compliance \nwith this criterion. First, for a variety of reasons, the team was able to reach only a small number \nof respondents. Second, some of the respondents did not have a clear recollection of when they \nwere informed. Third, the inquiry conflated the question of whether the respondent received \nnotification of the incident, which is what the criterion requires, with an inquiry into whether the \nrespondent was notified of the outcome of the investigation, which is  not required by this \ncriterion.  \nThe Defendants concluded that they could not rely upon this evidence to support their \nCertification of Compliance with this criterion. Instead, they reviewed the available data from \nthe Immediate Response Committee analyzed by the Quality Management Division for the 26 \nSRIs in the sample, and for all incidents involving class members from June 23, 2013 through \nJanuary 30, 2014. As a result of this review, Defendants reported that 69% of the sample \nincidents had a timely notification. From the larger review of all incidents involving class \nmembers, 89% had a timely notification, with the performance improving steadily from 23% in \nJune 2013 to in excess of 90% for the months of September, October, November and December \n2013. (See,  appendices  #s 19 and 22  Defendants’ Certification of  Compliance) Defendants \nattribute this improved performance to quality assurance activities that identified the reasons for \nthe initial low level of compliance, followed by staff training and close vigilance of performance \nand documentation of the notifications made. Despite the success of their efforts in dramatically \nimproving the level of compliance with this criterion, Defendants candidly acknowledge that \ntheir efforts have fallen slightly short of the required 90% compliance. \nIn light of the evidence and the Defendants' acknowledgment, Plaintiffs could advance an \nargument for a finding of noncompliance. However, they have elected to eschew an insistence on \ntechnical compliance and focus on the success achieved by the Defendants' proactive response to \nthe results of their critical self-examination. Although they do not challenge the Certification \nCompliance with this criterion, Plaintiffs point to continuing examples of cases involving serious \nincidents  where  families  and  guardians  of  class  members  were  not  notified  of  emergency \nhospitalizations, and the need for continuing vigilance regarding the required notifications. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1457   Filed 04/04/14   Page 5 of 14\nI find that the evidence on the whole supports a finding of substantial compliance with \nthis criterion. However, Defendants are directed to submit to the parties, the Court Monitor and \nthe Special Master quarterly reports for the first two quarters of 2014 regarding the rate of \ncompliance with the requirements for timely notifications of serious incidents. \niii.  All serious incidents are reported within the timeframe established by the \npolicies, and thoroughly investigated by trained investigators. All other incidents \nare investigated in accordance with the policy requirements.  \nThere is  some overlap  between this criterion  and criterion  one  above  regarding the \nreporting of serious incidents. The joint monitoring data clearly indicates that the Defendants' \nperformance  meets  the  requisite  compliance  threshold.  Although  the  Plaintiffs  agree  that \nDefendants are in compliance with this criterion, they voice their disagreement with Defendants' \npolicy  that  assigns  responsibility  for  investigating  incidents  other  than  “serious  reportable \nincidents” to providers. Plaintiffs are concerned that “providers cannot or will not conduct \neffective investigations or produce reports that are critical of fellow staff or their own agencies, \nas evidenced by their performance in looking at those SRI's for which they are responsible.” \n(Plaintiffs' Response to Director's Certification of Compliance, March 4, 2014, p. 3, “Plaintiffs’ \nResponse”)  In  support  of  their  concerns,  Plaintiffs  cite  several  examples  of  deficient \ninvestigations performed by providers. (Id. pp.3-4)  \nDefendants' policies recognize the importance of ensuring timely, competent and credible \ninvestigations. All SRIs are investigated by trained investigators employed by DDS/DDA but \nless  serious  incidents  are  assigned  to  provider  agencies  for  investigation.  There  is  nothing \ninherently wrong with placing primary responsibility upon a provider agency, which has been \nentrusted with and paid to provide for the care and safety of class members, to immediately \nrespond to incidents which jeopardize such safety. Such agencies must have the capacity to \ninvestigate what went wrong in their programs, to attend to the safety of people who have been \nentrusted to their care, and to examine root causes of the incident under investigation and to \nimplement preventive, corrective and disciplinary actions as warranted. The case examples cited \nby the Plaintiffs are reminders of the need to hold providers accountable for the performance of \ncritical functions with which they have been entrusted. Although the Defendants have instituted \nrequirements for competence-based training for provider investigators, these cases demonstrate \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1457   Filed 04/04/14   Page 6 of 14\ncontinued shortcomings in some cases. The deficiencies in the provider investigations cited by \nthe Plaintiffs were identified as a result of the review of investigations by the DDS Investigations \nManagement and Enforcement Unit and/or surveillance of provider agency performance by \nHRLA, which is evidence that providers are being supervised and held accountable for their \nperformance of investigations. This is evidence that Defendants have not made an unfettered \ndelegation  to  providers  of  this  important  responsibility  for  conducting  investigations  into \nincidents of lesser severity, but that there are systems in place to monitor how providers are \nfulfilling their obligations and to identify and correct deficiencies should they arise.  \nI find that the evidence supports a finding of substantial compliance with this criterion. \niv.   Investigation  reports  identify  appropriate  preventive,  corrective  and \ndisciplinary actions needed to protect MRDD consumers from harm. \nThe joint monitoring report found that investigations consistently addressed factors that \npotentially  caused  or  contributed  to  the  occurrence  of  the  incident.  Plaintiffs  concur  that \nDefendants are in compliance with this criterion. I find the evidence sufficient to substantiate a \nfinding of substantial compliance.  \nv.   All serious incident investigation reports are reviewed by quality assurance \nstaff in DDS/DDA. All other incidents are reviewed for patterns and trends by \nquality assurance staff in DDA and the Quality Improvement Committee.  \nThis  criterion  was  not  subject  to  the  joint  monitoring  process.  In  support  of  the \nCertification, Defendants have submitted extensive information regarding their quality assurance \nprogram. (Director's Certification of Compliance, pp. 17-19) This information describes the \nmanner in which incidents are reviewed for patterns and trends, information submitted to the \nQuality Improvement Committee, regularly shared with the Plaintiffs and published on the DDS \nwebsite. Pursuant to the Joint Stipulation on Quality Assurance Documents, Defendants have \nbeen submitting on a quarterly basis various reports to the Plaintiffs and the Court Monitor \nincluding Quality Management Division Quarterly Report, which addresses Serious Reportable \nIncidents and other incidents. \nPlaintiffs concur that Defendants are in compliance with this criterion. I find the evidence \nsufficient to substantiate a finding of substantial compliance. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1457   Filed 04/04/14   Page 7 of 14\nviii.  For all serious incidents, case managers3 follow up on recommendations and \nensure that there is prompt implementation of appropriate preventive, corrective \nor  disciplinary  action,  and  document  their  actions.  For  all  incidents,  case \nmanagers follow up to ensure that all consumers are safe and protected from \nharm.   Based  upon  the  quality  assurance  review  of  patterns  and  trends  of \nconsumer incidents, DDS/DDA shall ensure that there is prompt implementation \nof whatever preventive, corrective or disciplinary actions are necessary to protect \nthe consumers from harm.  \nThis  criterion  has  three  separate  requirements.  First,  that  for  Serious  Reportable \nIncidents, case managers follow up and document prompt implementation of recommendations. \nSecond, that for all incidents, case managers follow-up to ensure that consumers are safe and \nprotected from harm. Third, that based upon a quality assurance review of patterns and trends of \nincidents, DDA ensures there is prompt implementation of whatever preventive, corrective or \ndisciplinary actions are necessary to protect consumers from harm. \nThe joint monitoring process produced relevant data regarding two of the three elements \nof criterion viii. Question 192 addresses the first element, the follow-up of serious reportable \nincidents by a compliance specialist4 to ensure prompt implementation of recommendations for \nappropriate preventive, corrective or disciplinary action, with appropriate documentation. There \nwas 100% compliance. Another question, #276, asks whether there was evidence of follow-up by \nthe service coordinator “within 48 hours.” This produced an 84% compliance score. \nRegarding the second element dealing with all incidents, question 193 asks whether the \nservice coordinator followed up to ensure that the individual was safe and protected from harm. \nIt produced a score of 84%.  \nNone of the questions specifically address the third element which addresses quality \nassurance activities and more systemic preventive and corrective actions to protect consumers \nfrom harm, drawn from a review of patterns and trends of incidents. Neither the Defendants' \nCertification of Compliance nor the Plaintiffs' Response specifically addresses this element of \ncriterion viii. Perhaps this is because there is some degree of overlap between this criterion and \n                                                 \n3 Case managers are also referred to as support coordinators. \n \n4 Subsequent to the 2010 Plan, a change in DDS/DDA policy transferred the follow up responsibility from the case \nmanager to a compliance specialist. The parties agreed that the joint monitoring process would review the actions of \nthe compliance specialist instead. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1457   Filed 04/04/14   Page 8 of 14\ncriteria v and xii, and there is information in the Defendant's Certification that is of relevance to \nthis  element.  The  Defendants'  Certification  describes  how  all  incidents  are  aggregated  and \nreviewed for patterns and trends on a quarterly basis, reports are submitted to the Quality \nImprovement Committee, and recommendations are made for further investigations, inquiries or \nsystem  improvements.  It  further  describes  how  the  implementation  of  recommendations  is \nfollowed up by the work of various committees within DDS/DDA. (pp. 17-19) \nThe Certification evidence submitted does not discretely address these three elements, but \ncombines them into a single argument about compliance or noncompliance. Defendants argue \nthat the Joint Monitoring Report improperly combined the results of two questions, 193 and 276, \nand imported the 48 hour timeliness requirement of question 276 to question 193 for the service \ncoordinator's follow-up, resulting in  an 84% compliance rate. They  argue that without this \nimproper importing, the correct rate of compliance for question 193 is 92%. Second, they argue \nthat for the four cases where it was determined that the support coordinator did not follow-up to \nensure that the individual was safe and protected from harm, in two of these cases a DDS nurse \ndid the follow-up, and there was no adverse effect upon the class members. In the other two \ncases where the  service coordinators' follow up occurred outside the 48 hour time frame that had \nbeen improperly imported into question 193, the service coordinator nevertheless had followed \nup within a few days and there was no significant adverse impact upon the class members \ninvolved. Finally, Defendants  report that DDS has implemented a process  whereby service \ncoordination  supervisors  conduct  a  daily  check  of  incidents  to  ensure  that  proper  service \ncoordination of SRIs occurs within 48 hours of the incident. \nThe Plaintiffs' Response, while continuing to object to the Defendants' methodology of \naveraging scores, emphasizes that all four of the serious reportable incidents in the sample that \ndid  not  get  proper  service  coordination  pertain  to  emergency  or  unplanned  inpatient \nhospitalizations of members, one of whom was involved in two of the four incidents at issue. \nWhile agreeing with the Joint Monitoring Report that it was appropriate for DDS nurses to \nperform follow-up visits in two of the four cases, Plaintiffs argue that it is not a substitute for \nservice coordination. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1457   Filed 04/04/14   Page 9 of 14\nMuch as the nurses were doing their jobs, service coordinators must perform their jobs. It \nis critical that class members' service coordinators conduct timely follow-up reviews \nwithin two business days of the incident as mandated in the defendant's own policy. \nService coordinators, along with their supervisors, must oversee the needs and services of \nclass members, especially when they experience SRI's. (Plaintiffs' Response, p. 6) \nIt is inevitable in a case that covers so much ground that, despite the best efforts to craft \ndiscrete areas of Certifications of Compliance, some of the subject areas and their compliance \ncriteria overlap with others. (See, e.g. overlapping requirements regarding Staffing, Adequate \nBudget and Case Management. Special Master’s Report and Recommendation Regarding Staff \nTraining, Dkt. # 1318, July 6, 2012, and Dkt. # 1338, September 28, 2012; Special Master’s \nReport and Recommendation Regarding Adequate Budget, Dkt. #1341, October 5, 2012; Special \nMaster’s Report and Recommendation Regarding Case Management, Dkt. #1374, March 25, \n2013) It is therefore important to focus in each certification on the core interest of class members \nthat is being addressed. It must be kept in mind that this is a certification about Protection from \nHarm and not about the performance of case managers, which is the subject of a separate \ncertification. The essential interest of class members that this criterion was intended to protect is \ntheir safety. The implementation of recommendations for prevention, correction and discipline \nfurthers  that  interest  in  being  protected  from  harm.  From  that  perspective  and  for  this \ncertification,  it  is  of  lesser  importance  to  the  class  member  whether  critical  functions  are \nperformed by service coordinators, compliance specialists or DDS nurses – what matters is that \nthese  functions  are  performed  in  a  reasonably  timely  manner.  This  is  not  to  say  that  the \nperformance by case managers of their duties is unimportant –far from it, they are an essential \nsafeguard for class members in a service system where all of the critical responsibilities for \nservice provision have been assigned to private contractors. But this is not the place to evaluate \nthe performance by case managers of their duties. \nIn  two  of  the  cases  cited  as  evidence  of  noncompliance,  the  follow-up  visit  was \nperformed by a nurse while the class member was still in the hospital. In the third case, which is \ncited as evidence of noncompliance because the service coordinator's visit took place at least two \ndays beyond the 48 hour window for follow-up, the class member was also in the hospital. In \neach of these cases, the class member was in a location where his or her safety and protection \nwas entrusted to the hospital staff, and there is no evidence that the class member was exposed to \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1457   Filed 04/04/14   Page 10 of 14\nany additional risk of harm due to inconsequential delays in service coordinator follow-up, or \nthat the follow-up was performed by a nurse rather than the service coordinator. The fourth case \ncited as evidence of noncompliance involves the failure of a service coordinator to conduct a \nfollow-up visit for a week after the class member had been discharged from an emergency \ninpatient hospitalization due to blood in her stool. The IMEU made a finding of neglect against \nthe provider direct support and nursing staff for failing to adequately monitor the class member's \nbowel movements during the time leading up to her hospitalization. In this case, the lack of \ntimely follow-up by the case manager may well have been responsible for a slower response and \ncorrection of conditions at the class member's home.  \nDespite this deficiency, the evidence overall establishes substantial compliance with the \nrequirement that there is follow-up of incidents to ensure that class members are safe and \nprotected  from  harm,  that  serious  reportable  incidents  are  followed  up  to  ensure  the \nimplementation of recommendations for preventive, corrective or disciplinary action, and that \nDefendants ensure that there is prompt implementation of preventive, corrective or disciplinary \nactions emanating from quality assurance reviews of patterns and trends of incidents. \nxii.   In  the  event  that  private  providers  do  not  comply  with  these  performance \nexpectations,  appropriate authorities within the District government  will take \nwhatever immediate actions are necessary to protect consumers, and take such \nfurther actions as may be necessary to correct the deficiency, including but not \nlimited  to  the  provision  of  training  or  technical  assistance  to  provider  staff, \nand/or the imposition of  sanctions  designed to  assure compliance, including, \nwhere necessary, termination of provider agreements, contracts and licenses. \nThis  criterion  describes the obligation of the Defendants  for enforcement actions to \nensure that providers meet the performance expectations laid out in law and policy for protecting \nclass members from harm. The Director's Certification of Compliance describes the several \nsystems that are in place to report SRI's to other District agencies with oversight responsibilities, \nthe  follow  up  by  the  Department  of  Health  Care  Finance  and  through  the  DDS  Provider \nCertification Review process on recommendations that have been made. It further describes the \ntraining  and  technical  assistance  that  is  an  outgrowth  of  monthly  Incident  Management \nCoordinators meetings with providers, and the work of the DDA Health and Wellness staff, and \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1457   Filed 04/04/14   Page 11 of 14\nQuality Improvement Specialist, as well as the annual development of Continuous Improvement \nPlans by the Provider Resource Management unit for each provider. The certification states:  \nDDS employs the Do Not Refer List, Enhanced Monitoring, Provisional PCR \nCertification and Recommendations for Termination of Medicaid Agreements as \nsanctions designed to assure compliance with DDS policy to ensure protection \nfrom harm. During the time frame covered by the joint monitoring team's review, \nsanctions were necessary for only one provider . ... As a result, . . .was placed on \nthe Do Not Refer and Watch List . . .[and] later remedied the basis for the \nsanctions and was removed from both of these lists. (Director's Certification of \nCompliance, pp.19-20) \nIn their response, Plaintiffs acknowledge that the Defendants have developed systems to \nidentify deficiencies and issue sanctions to poorly performing providers, and that they have taken \nactions against providers consistent with their policies. (Plaintiffs' Response, pp. 7-10) However, \ntheir  essential  objection  to  the  Certification  of  Compliance  for  this  criterion  is  that  the \nDefendants'  enforcement  actions  have  not  been  effective  and  that  they  “continue  to  allow \nproviders with demonstrated deficiencies to support class members. As a result, class members' \nhealth needs suffer and they are at risk of harm.” (Id., p. 7) After describing a series of long-\nstanding deficiencies at several different provider sites, and the actions taken by the Defendants, \nPlaintiffs object that “the actions they have taken have still not corrected the deficiencies as \nrequired under Goal B.b.xii and class members are still not protected from harm.”(Id., p. 9)  \nPlaintiffs conclude: \nOutcome criterion xii requires more than monitoring and the development of sanctions. It \nrequires swift action to correct deficiencies to ensure that class members are protected \nfrom  harm.  Yet,  class  members  still  remain  with  substandard  providers  who  have \ndemonstrated for far too long that they cannot meet the needs of class members. As a \nresult, class members suffer. Therefore, plaintiff's contest the defendants' certification of \ncompliance with this criterion. (Id. p. 10) \nProminent  among  the  examples  cited  by  the  Plaintiffs  is  the  case  of  Individual \nDevelopment Inc. (“IDI”), a provider agency with which the Court is familiar as its performance \nhas been the subject of several reports by the Court Monitor and discussion at parties' meetings \nand status conferences. The long-standing deficiencies at this provider agency, which operated \n11 intermediate care facilities and two support living homes and served approximately 42 class \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1457   Filed 04/04/14   Page 12 of 14\nmembers, and the lack of success  of progressive enforcement actions in  achieving durable \ncorrection of the problems, eventually led the District to consider legal proceedings to terminate \nits operations. A report to the Court by the Defendants on April 6, 2012 described the history of \nenforcement actions which culminated in a plan to transition the operations of IDI to three other \nproviders, and to provide for enhanced independent monitoring during the transitional process \n(Dkt. #1309-1, April 6, 2012)  \nUnfortunately, as noted by the Plaintiffs, “Even after these class members transitioned to \nthree well-established providers, they continue to receive the same substandard care as they did \nwhen they were supported by IDI.” (Id, p. 7)  \nThe Plaintiffs' Response describes the numerous steps taken by the Defendants to address the \nongoing problems affecting the class members after the transition. \n1.  DDS performed a 45 day review of the class members. \n2.  On September 30, 2013, DDS issued a Provider Plan of Correction Performance Review \ncomparing performance of the three providers on key measures to the earlier review. \n3.  As a result of this review, all three providers were placed on the Do Not Refer list, which \nprevents new admissions. \n4.  The Defendants increased their own monitoring of these homes and provided training and \ntechnical assistance to the three providers. \n5.  The Court Monitor's review in the fall of 2013 indicated that many of the deficiencies \npersisted. \n6.  IMEU  conducted  investigations  into  individual  cases  of  alleged  neglect  and  serious \nreportable incidents. \n7.  HRLA conducted surveys of the homes in October, November and December 2013 and \nidentified deficiencies in implementing class members' ISPs and health care plans. \nThe Plaintiffs also cite the example of another provider that supports 36 class members \nwhich has been on the Do Not Refer list for 27 months for a variety of problems including \ncontinuing concerns about health and wellness and inadequate oversight by management. While \nplacement on this list may have prevented new admissions to this provider for more than two \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1457   Filed 04/04/14   Page 13 of 14\nyears,”it  has  not  protected  the  class  members  and  DDS  consumers  stuck  in  those  poorly \nperforming residential placements.” (Id., p. 9) \nIt is clear from this record that the Defendants have taken a variety of enforcement \nactions of varying levels of severity when confronted with deficient practices by providers. In the \nenforcement process, Defendants must be given some latitude in determining the most effective \ncourse of action to produce compliance, before invoking drastic options that may require class \nmembers to undergo the trauma of a forced relocation or transfer to a new provider and a new \nstaff. As the experience of IDI illustrates, even this option is no guarantor of a successful result. \nAlthough responsibility for the class members and other consumers was transferred to other \nwell-established provider agencies, the performance problems persisted.  \nThe question which arises is to what standard should Defendants be held? The obligation \nto take action to address serious deficiencies cannot be satisfied by a process alone, without \nregard to the effectiveness of the result it achieves on behalf of vulnerable class of people. \nAlthough, on paper, it appears that there is a veritable arsenal of tools available to enforce safety \nand  quality  standards  applicable  to  provider  agencies,  these  tools  seem  to  work  best  with \nprovider agencies that are both competent and strongly motivated to deliver a high level of \nquality and safety. They have proven less effective, and even ineffective, in environments that \nhave had a prolonged experience of deficient care that has permeated the organization.  \nTo support a finding of compliance, there must be evidence that when confronted with \npersistent deficiencies, Defendants are vigilant in using the tools at their disposal to improve \nprovider performance. And the tools themselves must be tools that work effectively to produce \nthe desired result within a reasonably prompt time, given the severity of the problem to be \ncorrected. As the language of the criterion states, Defendants must “take such further actions as \nmay be necessary to correct the deficiency.” \nAlthough the Defendants have implemented several systems for enforcement of their \nexpectations for providers, the evidence does not demonstrate the effectiveness of these systems \nin  correcting  deficiencies  that  affect  a  substantial  number  of  class  members'  interests  in \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1457   Filed 04/04/14   Page 14 of 14\nprotection from harm. I find that the Defendants have failed to carry their burden of proof of \ncompliance with this requirement.  \nIn conclusion, I find that the Defendants have met their burden of proof of compliance as \nto criteria I, ii, iii, iv, v, and viii, and have failed to meet their burden of proof as to criterion xii. \n \nPursuant  to  the  Supplemental  Order  of  Reference  (Dkt.  #920),  the  parties  may  file \nobjections to this report within 30 days. \n \n/s/________________ \nClarence J.

Harris and filed March 28, 2001 \nestablished the Monitoring Office's annual budget commencing October 1, 2001. \nWhile the Monitoring Office has been able to maintain operations within the established \nbudget during FY2002, compliance with the budget has required significant changes in \nhow proposed funds were allocated. \nA Monitoring Office budget for FY2003, which is based on experience rather than the \nassumptions of the FY2002 budget, has been submitted to all parties for review and \ncomment.  The defendants, plaintiffs and the plaintiff-intervenor have approved an \nincrease in the Monitoring Office budget from $711,458 to $834,567.  A detail of the \nproposed FY2003 budget as compared to the FY2002 budget and rationale for the \nmodifications is attached. \nI am requesting a Court Order reflecting the increased budget for the Monitoring Office \nin FY2003.  The new budget would require the defendants to deposit the sum of \n$834,567 into the Registry of the Court on October 1, 2002 for payment of the costs of \nthe Court Monitor.  Payments of $208,641.75 would be paid to the Monitoring Office by \nthe Clerk of the Court at the beginning of each quarter in accordance with the present \nConsent Order. \nThank you for consideration of my request.

FENTY, et al.,  ) \n_______________________ \nDefendants.  ) \n) \nDECLARATION OF LAURA L. NUSS \nI, Laura L. Nuss, declare and state as follows: \n1.  I am competent to testify to the matters set forth herein, and testify based on \npersonal knowledge, information and belief. \nI.  Background Information \n2.  I hold a Bachelor of Science in Administration of Justice (1981) and a Master of \nScience in Community Systems Planning and Development (1987), both from the Pennsylvania \nState University. \n3.  My experience in the field oflntellectual and Developmental Disability (\"IDD\") \nincludes learning from the perspective of a family member, private provider and state \ngovernment official.  Specifically, in addition to growing up with my Aunt who had a \ndevelopmental disability, I served as her personal representative and health care decision maker \nfor the last 20 years of her life. \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 3 of 26\n4.  The first 15 years of my professional career in this field were spent working for \nprivate organizations developing and operating small community-based residential (ICF/MR and \nHCBS waiver funded settings) and vocational services for individuals leaving the Pennhurst \nState School and Hospital and the Embreeville State School and Hospital, and for adults who \nsought or needed supports outside of the family home.  I also served on family and consumer \nsatisfaction survey teams through the Embreeville Consumer/Family Satisfaction Teams project. \n5.  I then moved to state government, serving three years as Branch Chief for the \nNorth Carolina Developmental Disabilities Administration, responsible for the management of \nthe DD Home and Community-Based Services (\"HCBS\") waiver serving 6,000 individuals with \na total operating budget of$300 million, department budget matters for a $650 million state \nagency serving 12,000 individuals, and systems change initiatives.  In that capacity, I \nparticipated in the design and submission of the DD HCBS waiver renewal and rate setting \ninitiatives. \n6.  In the state of Connecticut, I served one year as a Connecticut Department of \nMental Retardation Regional Director with comprehensive responsibilities for all case \nmanagement, family support, and private and public residential and vocational services serving \n3,000 individuals with an operating budget of $85 million.  I then served as the state-wide \nDirector of Strategic Leadership for four years with responsibility for the state Medicaid HCBS \nwaivers, Quality Assurance and Improvement, Staff Development, and Planning and Information \nTechnology for the department with a total operating budget of$900 million serving 19,000 \nindividuals.  During that tenure, I re-wrote the \"Comprehensive\" MR/DD waiver for \nConnecticut to include self-determination, and wrote a second \"Supports\" waiver to introduce \ninnovative in-home and self-directed services for individuals served by the Department, the tenth \n2 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 4 of 26\nsuch waiver approved in the country to be designated as an Independence Plus waiver.  I co \nwrote and served as the co-principal investigator for two CMS Systems Change Grants in the \namount of$675,000 over a three-year period under the Independence Plus and the Quality \nAssurance/Quality Improvement under the federal systems change initiatives.  Additionally, I \nplayed an instrumental role in the settlement of a class action \"Waiting List\" lawsuit by assisting \nwith the design of a budget initiative totaling $12 million of state funds over a five-year period to \nserve an additional 750 persons off of the DD waiting list. \n7.  I have also served as a consultant on Medicaid waiver and quality assurance, and, \nin that capacity, co-wrote the District of Columbia (\"District\") DD Medicaid HCBS waiver \nrenewal approved in November 2007.  I have presented extensively at professional meetings \nnationally on quality assurance and improvement designs to meet the CMS Quality Framework \nrequirements, Medicaid waivers, Individual Budgeting and Allocation methodologies, and Self \nDetermination subject matter. \n8.  I was appointed as the Deputy Director of the Department on Disability Services \n(\"DDS\"), responsible for the Developmental Disabilities Administration (\"DDA''), formerly \nknown as the Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Administration (\"MRDDA\"), \neffective August 20, 2007. \nII.  Service Coordination/Individual Service Plans \n9.  DDS/DDA currently employs 71 service coordinators, who are tasked with, \namong other things, meeting at least annually with individual consumers, their families and/or \nsignificant others, and their providers, to gather information in order to develop each consumer's \nIndividual Service Plan (\"ISP\"). \n3 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 5 of 26\n10.  The ISP can be revised or updated more frequently than annually to ensure that \nchanges in an individual's condition and/or needs are taken into consideration in providing \nservices and treatment. \n11.  On a quarterly basis for the past two years, between 86% and 98% of class \nmembers have met personally with their service coordinators.  ISPs have been completed on a \ntimely basis for class members on average 90% of the time for the past two years. \n12.  For the past six (6) years, DDS/DDA has maintained a ratio of one service \ncoordinator to no more than 30 individuals (class and non-class members). \n13.  In October 2008, DDS/DDA designed and implemented a new ISP format that is \nbuilt on best practice and organized around the same eight (8) domains that are used throughout \nthe District's planning and performance measurement systems:  rights and dignity; safety and \nsecurity; health and wellness; choice and decision-making; community inclusion; relationships; \nservice planning and delivery; and satisfaction.  The ISP itself is now an on-line document that is \ncompleted, reviewed, approved, and disseminated via the web application. \n14.  DDA service coordinators facilitate ISPs meetings and complete the document for \nall class members regardless of where he or she lives.  DDA service coordinators assumed this \nresponsibility for individuals residing in HCBS waiver settings on October 2, 2008 and for \nindividuals residing in ICF /ID settings on August 1, 2009 as planned. \nIII.  Home and Community-Based Services Waiver \n15.  DDA's implementation of the Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services \n(\"HCBS\") waiver has enabled the District to redesign its service system to provide expanded \nintegrated-living alternatives and services to consumers. \n4 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 6 of 26\n16.  Through the waiver program, the District is eligible for a federal reimbursement \nof 70%, which has the effect of maximizing more limited local dollars while simultaneously \nproviding more services and supports to the consumers who need them. \n17.  The HCBS waiver is comprised of the following: Professional Services-\nincluding speech, hearing, or language services, occupational and physical therapy, skilled \nnursing, behavior supports, and less traditional therapy such as dance or drama therapy; \nAssistive Supports-including emergency response, vehicle modification, and environmental \nadaptation (such as the addition of ramps or grab bars) without which an individual might need \nto be institutionalized; Residential Supports- including residential habilitation (housing 4-6 \nindividuals), supported living (housing 1-3 individuals), and in-home support or live-in \ncaregivers that allow a person to live as independently as possible; and Day Supports-including \nday habilitation to allow individuals to develop skills to support, or further, community \nintegration opportunities, as well as supported employment to enable an individual to live as \nautonomously as possible through an ability to earn income. \n18.  Each service under the HCBS waiver is available individually so that each \nindividual has the maximum amount of choice consistent with his or her general support, \nmedical, emotional, and/or physical needs. \n19.  In September 2008, the District of Columbia submitted an amendment to add \nskilled nursing and supported living with transportation services to the waiver menu.  The \namendment also sought to increase the payment rate for physical and occupation therapy and \nspeech and nutrition services in order to improve recruitment efforts of new clinicians to the \nprogram.  In April 2009, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (\"CMS\") approved the \namendment, which will be implemented with the passage of :final rulernaking in October 2009. \n5 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 7 of 26\n20.  The District continues to pursue refinements to the HCBS waiver program as part \nof self-directed continuous quality improvement.  During the summer of2009, the District \ncreated an HCBS Waiver Advisory Committee to solicit broad stakeholder participation and \ninput on proposed changes.  To date, this advisory committee has held three meetings that have \nled to the preparation of changes to the waiver in the following areas:  level of care; service \nplanning and delivery; services; qualifications of providers; health and welfare; fmancial \naccountability; administrative oversight; and quality management plan.  As DDA continues to \nenhance and refine its services, operations, policies and practices, those changes are \nsubsequently incorporated into the HCBS waiver application for approval by CMS, and to \ncontinually update CMS of enhancements in the quality management strategy of the District to \nmeet the six required assurances. \n21.  The District has demonstrated improvement in the provision of services under the \nISPs.  For example, for HCBS waiver participants, prior authorizations must be processed in a \ntimely manner in order for services to be offered consistent with the ISPs.  In fiscal year 2008, \nprior authorizations were issued late 70% of the time.  In only a year, the District dramatically \nimproved its performance such that in fiscal year 2009, prior authorizations were issued in \nadvance 70% of the time. \nIV.  Recruitment and Retention of Qualified Providers \n22.  Since January 2009, DDA has successfully recruited five (5) waiver providers, \nincreasing the total number of current waiver providers to 104.  Sixty-four ( 64) percent of all \nresidential services are currently delivered via the waiver program, and more than half of the \nEvans class is currently enrolled in the waiver. \n6 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 8 of 26\n23.  As of September 1, 2009, there are forty-two (4 2) Day Habilitation providers, \nthirty-eight (38) Pre-vocational Services providers, thirty-eight (38) Supported Employment \nproviders, ninety-one (91) Supported Living providers, ninety-four (94) Residential Habilitation \nproviders, forty-five (4 5) Host Home providers, twenty (20) Live-in Caregiver providers and \nsixteen (16) Professional Services providers enrolled in the HCBS waiver. \n24.  In February 2009, DDA developed and implemented a more robust enrollment \nprocess, namely the Provider Readiness Review Protocol, to review new provider applicants \nvigorously through a process of paper application, interview and on-site observation and review \nto ensure that new applicants in fact were prepared to serve DDA consumers effectively upon \nenrollment in the program.  Since the inception of the enhanced protocol, twenty-seven (27) \nproviders passed this process successfully, two (2) failed, and six (6) have been delayed due to \npoor performance in the review process.  This process significantly improves the process agreed \nupon in the \"September 12, 2007 90 Day Order\" as the District no longer needs to be concerned \nabout a sufficient number of providers, but does seek to continually raise the bar on the capacity \nof these provider organizations to deliver high quality services and supports. \n25.  The District through DDA and the Department of Health Care Finance (\"DHCF\") \nremoved three (3) providers from the waiver program in the past 12 months due to performance \ndeficits, providing further evidence that the District's ability and commitment to remove poorly \nperforming providers from the DDA service-delivery system. \nV.  Intermediate Care Facilities for the Intellectually Disabled \n26.  An intermediate care facility for the intellectually disabled (\"ICF/ID\") in the \nDistrict serves no more than eight (8) individuals and provides active treatment to those \nindividuals who require more intermediate levels of care.  To meet the needs of the extremely \n7 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 9 of 26\nmedically-complex and fragile persons who currently reside in hospital settings, DDA issued a \nRequest for Proposal (\"RFP\") for a small ICF/ID setting to effectively serve these individuals in \nthe community.  The RFP was awarded to Volunteers of America (\"VOA''), a national provider \nthat practices person-centered service delivery and specializes in serving medically complex \nindividuals in the District.  VOA believes inclusive, personalized services can also be delivered \nunder the ICF/ID model. \n27.  Many of the individuals served by ICFs/ID are non-ambulatory and have seizure \ndisorders, behavioral support needs, mental illness, visual or hearing impairments, chronic, \nsignificant health conditions or a combination of these. \n28. ·  While the District makes every effort to serve as many consumers as possible via \nthe waiver, this alternate housing option must also continue to be made accessible, as these \nsettings at times can be as or more appropriate to serve the more complicated and complex needs \nof a subset of consumers. \n29.  Through the efforts ofDDA, DHCF and the Money Follows the Person program, \ndiscussed in~ 30, a strategic plan is being fully implemented to reduce all ICF/ID homes to six \n(6) persons or less to improve the ability of these homes to provide more personalized services \nand supports, close older and non-accessible ICF/ID homes and reduce the overall number of \npersons receiving services via the ICF/ID program, consistent with the District's goal of \ntreatment in the least restrictive environment.  In fiscal year 2009, the number of eight-person \nhomes decreased to s_ix {6) persons or less :from 15 to 12 with a plan on file for DC Healthcare to \nreduce all of its homes to six (6) or less via the MFP program;  nine (9)  homes closed or were \nreduced in size and converted to the HCBS waiver program; and in total the number of \n8 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 10 of 26\nindividuals receiving services through the ICF/ID program decreased by 13%  from the start to \nclose of fiscal year 2009, and for class members decreased by 11%. \nVI.  Money Follows the Person Grant \n30.  In July 2008, CMS awarded the District a three-year, multi-million dollar grant \nthrough the Money Follows the Person Rebalancing Demonstration Program (\"MFP\"). \n31.  This initiative has enabled the District to reduce its reliance on ICFs/ID for people \nwith a wide range of developmental and physical disabilities, as well as older adults and \npersons with chronic mental illness. \n32.  The MFP enables the District to receive a 15 percent higher, i.e., from 70% to \n85%, Medicaid matching rate for each person whom it assists to a community setting for the first \n365 days enrolled in a HCBS waiver and the grant is expected to result in an additional $4 \nmillion to $6 million in federal Medicaid funding to the District over the lifetime of the grant. \nThe District uses the higher federal Medicaid match that it receives from the grant to help people \nwho wish to leave intermediate care facilities or nursing homes to move into homes or \napartments of their choice, and to provide the Medicaid waiver services that these consumers \nneed to live in the community.  This program thus allows individuals to avoid being \ninstitutionalized and to exercise far greater choice and control over the essentials of their lives, \nsuch as where and with whom to live; what to do during the week and weekend; and what \nsupports to receive and from whom.  In addition, individuals in this program are participating in \npilots to demonstrate the effectiveness of peer counseling, transition coordination and enhanced \nprimary care coordination. \n33.  From August 2008 through September 2009, DDS transitioned 43 individuals \nwith developmental disabilities from ICFs/ID to smaller settings including apartments in which \n9 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 11 of 26\nthey live alone or with one or two other persons; there are an additional 29 individuals who are in \nsome phase of exploring the MFP process~ As of March 2009, DDS had offered MFP housing \nservices to another fifteen (15) individuals and their families who declined those services. \nSome of these individuals declined MFP services due to deteriorating health; others were \nsatisfied with their current placements; and still others refused because their families were not \nsupportive of the proposed changes.  This program illustrates the District's commitment to \ndeinstitutionalization and individual choice.  It allows an individual with IDD to choose his or \nher environment within a range of professionally acceptable alternatives, rather than imposing a \nstate-selected placement. \nVII.  Health and Welfare \n34.  With the on-the-ground implementation of the Health Care Agreement (\"HCA\") \ninitiated in May 2008, DDS has devoted considerable resources and funding exceeding $2.5 \nmillion and has successfully improved the quality and quantity of health care offered to \nconsumers. \n35.  The HCA established a Health Care Quality Initiative (\"Initiative\") in partnership \nwith George Washington and Georgetown Universities.  The Initiative has been able to recruit \nnew providers such as Seton House (affiliated with Providence Hospital), which now provides \nfor the comprehensive psychiatric service needs of more than 1 00 individuals, and two additional \nprimary care physicians (\"PCPs\").  A third PCP is now being supported as he begins a \nhomebound visiting practice in District of Columbia Wards 7 and 8. \n36.  The HCA has also enabled the District to deliver enhanced primary care \ncoordination for individuals considered to be high-risk who are in the waiver, and as a clinically \nbased research project, has provided outcome findings and recommendations for further \n10 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 12 of 26\nenhancements to the District's IDD and overall health care delivery-system as anticipated by the \nInitiative. Such coordination has occurred for 158 individuals, all class members, since the \ninception of the program, and was designed to be a proactive strategy for DDS/DDA to track the \ntransition of individuals from the Medical Director ICF /IDD model into the waiver program, \nidentify possible barriers to clinical care, and address any patient safety threats that could emerge \nas a result of this transition.  Select findings of the first year of the project included as follows: \naccess to medical services impedes ability to meet timeline requirements established by the IDD \nservice system; access to PCP services during evening and weekend hours contributes to high \nuse of emergency services; PCPs received the pilot project positively to improve communication \nand support for care coordination; care coordination between the PCP and specialist remains a \ncommunication challenge in the fee for service medical model; service coordination \nunderstanding of clinical conditions was adequate in most circumstances; and, clinical issues that \nemerge as significant areas include mobility, fall risks and sub-optimal use of physical therapy. \nThese findings now drive quality improvement initiatives in health care by targeting service \ncoordination training, exploring new health care delivery models with DHCF, and focused \ninterventions targeted toward mobility, fall prevention, and expansion of physical therapy \nservices. \n37.  George Washington University has also hosted webinars for physicians serving \nindividuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities by leading physicians in the field on \nthe following topics during the Initiative to date:  Seizure Disorders; Renal Disease; Asthma; \nBone Health; and, Wound Care.  These webinars are archived and available for viewing for the \nsubsequent 12 months and marketed through the Area Health Education Consortium for the \nDistrict of Columbia (\"AHEC\"). \n11 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 13 of 26\n38.  The District of Columbia's Health Resource Partnership (\"DC HRP\") seeks to \nexpand the community health care capacity for individuals with IDD by (1) providing health and \nmental health services that are accessible; and (2) implementing strategies to promote quality \nhealth outcomes. Since January 2009, DC HRP has added eight (8) full-time clinicians, who \nprovide services in homes and day/vocational settings with a focus on quality, technical \nassistance, and training.  In the last roughly six (6) months alone, the DC HRP interdisciplinary \n41 \nteam has completed 1,058 targeted technical assistance requests  a range of areas including \noccupational and physical therapy, speech, psychology, medicine, health education, and nursing. \nIn addition, the DC HRP medical director has assumed an increasingly active role in facilitating \ncommunication exchange between and among PCPs, the hospitals, medical specialists and \ninterdisciplinary team members.  This information has been useful in reducing hospital stays, \nensuring timely care provision, assisting teams to develop priorities for people with complicated \nhealth conditions and competing needs for treatments.  This has also helped to educate hospital \nstaff about the needs of people with disabilities and to better understand the community-based \nsystem of services and supports. \n39.  To increase the number of experienced practitioners, DC HRP provides \ncommunity-wide training in a variety of areas to teach those who serve individuals with IDD \nhow to provide better care.  Training includes, for example, \"Using Visual Strategies to Prevent \nand Reduce Behavior Problems,\" \"End of Life Planning,\" and \"Substitute Decision-Making in \nHealthcare.\" And in a significant development for the long-term sustainability of the service \ndelivery system, for the third consecutive year, Georgetown University family medicine \nresidents must devote a portion of their residency to the health care of adults with IDD, to assist \nin recruiting providers to this practice area. The additional training to medical students and \n12 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 14 of 26\nespecially residents, specifically addresses the capacity-building and pipeline needs to DC IDD \nresidents. The capacity for PCP panels is currently small and therefore access to care has been \nincreasingly difficult. Without a mechanism to expand the PCP base, reliance on an older \nworkforce of doctors creates unique and multiple service delivery challenges. Without \nthe education efforts through the DC HRP, the current expansion in the provider network \nwould not have become a reality. In order for DC HRP to accomplish the tasks of capacity \nbuilding, increase in quality care and best practices, a strong training component was required, \nnot only through physician consultation, coordination and technical support, but, educational \ntraining for soon-to-be practicing physicians in the local area. The connections and training of \narea resident family practitioners have allowed for physicians to include our individuals with \nIDD into their panel. DC HRP successfully recruited several graduates from the Georgetown \nFamily Practice residency programs who also see our patients at community health centers \n(\"CHC\"). \n40.  I concur with the recent summary report from Dr. Kim Bullock, DC HRP \nMedical Director, regarding the effectiveness of the Health Passport.  Dr. Bullock stated that \"the \nHealth Passport has become a crucial information exchange document for the emergency \ndepartment and the hospitals. Since the health passport has been implemented, providers have \nnoted its value in providing a concise, clear presentation of the client's medical-related history, \ncurrent and past. This information has been crucial in the emergency environment, as well as \nenabling, (1) medication reconciliation for hospitalization, (2) identifying point of contact for \nagency staff, physician, consultants, case worker, which has facilitated in-hospital \ncorrespondence by phone and in writing, (3) improved timing for discharge planning meetings, \nas well as emergency meetings concerning clinical care, (4) Provided timely information for \n13 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 15 of 26\nemergency and acute in-hospital clinical decision-making that impacts on interventions, and (5) \nserves as a life document that has the potential to memorialize the client's health information \novertime. \nOver the last year the health passport has been a portable document accompanying clients to all \narea hospitals. Providence Hospital has received the largest number of IDD clients, and the \npositive impact of the Health Passport has been noted by staff and upper-level administration. In \nthe last three months there have been forty (4 0) patients with complex medical problems either \nseen in the ED or admitted.  In these cases, the health passport has been instrumental in \ninfluencing patient's outcomes. The use of a Health Passport has proven to be invaluable in \nreducing errors, decreasing delays in getting pertinent health information about a complex client \nto the right person at the right time.\" \n41.  DC HRP prepared a report for DDA on Preventative Health Screenings and \nresults from a pilot study of the same for individuals served by DDA in residential settings.  In \n2005, DDA introduced the use ofHealth Form 1, a document to record preventive health \nscreenings that includes the recommendations of the Preventive Services Task Force \n(\"USPSTF\"). This documentation is required in the health records of all individuals receiving \nresidential services funded via the HCBS waiver or ICFs/ID. The USPSTF is an independent \npanel of experts in primary care and prevention that systematically reviews the evidence of \neffectiveness and develops recommendations for clinical preventive services. \n42.  Several entities tracking health care quality cited receipt of preventive health \nscreening and adult immunizations. This includes Health People 2010, the Commonwealth Fund \nNational Scorecard on U.S. Health System Performance, the Agency for Healthcare Research \n14 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 16 of 26\nand Quality, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (Committee on the State of the \nUSA Health Indicators, Board on Population Health and Public Health Practice) and the federal \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (Community Health Status Indicators). Specifically, \nmeasures such as detection of hypertension, colorectal cancer screening and breast cancer \nscreening are important measures ofhealth in the District of Columbia due to the high incidence \nofhypertension, cardiovascular disease and breast and colon cancer among residents of the \nDistrict of Columbia. They are far more important indicators than the rating of completion of \nhealth management care plans. While health management care plans are important documents for \nhealth planning and health care delivery, their usefulness in measuring the extent to which the \nDistrict of Columbia has advanced in the delivery of essential health care to people receiving \nservices from DDA is severely limited. \n43.  DC HRP conducted a study of preventive health screenings, namely colorectal \ncancer, mammography and Pap smears, and clinical breast exams, for individuals served in three \n(3) agencies.  A total of one hundred and forty seven (147) individuals were reviewed, \napproximately 11% of all individuals served by DDA in residential services.  Selected findings \ndemonstrate that these sample screening rates meet and in most instances exceed the national and \ntarget rates.  This is particularly significant given the barriers to preparation and completion of \nthese invasive procedures.  The full report contains recommendations for continued \nimprovements in the District's health care system for persons with intellectual and \ndevelopmental disabilities that will be reviewed by the DDA Quality Improvement Committee \nfor inclusion in the agency's initiatives. \nVIII.  Payments to Providers \n15 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 17 of 26\n44.  The District has made every effort to pay providers in a timely manner.  Ninety-\neight percent (98%) of all claims are adjudicated in 30 days. \n45.  DHCF has moved to a weekly payment cycle, meaning payments are sent out \nonce a week instead of every other week. \n46.  DDA and DHCF continue weekly conference calls to resolve emerging billing \nconcerns.  DHCF provides on-site provider technical assistance, and DDA and DHCF compare \nbilling reports against prior authorizations under the HCBS waiver program to proactively \nidentify potential billing problems prior to significant delays emerging. \n47.  To further improve financing of services, the District has submitted to CMS a \nState Plan Amendment that provides an alternative method of determining ICF/ID provider \nreimbursement.  DHCF, the District Medicaid State Agency, worked collaboratively with both \nDDS/DDA and the providers to develop the new methodology.  This alternative moves away \nfrom a cost-based reimbursement methodology where providers were locked into rates based on \ncost caps set at the median cost in 1993 inflated forward.  Because the way in which care is \nprovided has changed so much in the interim-for example, minimum wage increases, changes \nin rent, increases in utility costs, staffing ratio changes-these median cost caps do not reflect the \nactual cost of care today.  The new methodology allows providers to set a price for their services \nand they are rewarded for reducing cost so long as they continue to provide quality services. \nIX.  Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (\"CMS\") Monitoring of DDS \n48.  CMS is the federal agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs \nand already provides extensive oversight for services provided by DDS/DDA. \n49.  The District submits to CMS an annual report (known as the 372 report) that \ndetails fiscal and quality performance measures.  In addition, CMS will be initiating expanded \n16 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 18 of 26\n372 quality-reporting in the next fiscal year that mirrors the expanded quality management \nrequirements now found in the HCBS waiver program.  CMS also conducts unannounced \nrandom audits on various areas of its six ( 6) assurances, including level of care, service plan, \nqQalified providers, health and welfare, administrative oversight, and financial accountability. \nMost recently, in August 2009, DHCF and DDS/DDA were evaluated on Provider Enrollment \nprotocols. \n50.  From February 2007 to March 2009, CMS engaged in even more intensive \nmonitoring to ensure the then MAA and DDS/DDA's compliance with the federal HCBS waiver \nrequirements.  This included monthly written and telephonic monitoring of a corrective action \nplan in three of the six assurances: Plan of Care; Health and Welfare; and. Administrative \nOversight.  In March 2009, however, CMS determined that the District had \"made major \nchanges in the performance, structure, oversight mechanism, and systems sufficient enough to \nengage in continuous Quality Improvement (\"QI\").\" To qualify for such a finding, a state must \ndemonstrate a robust system of \"discovery, remediation and improvement\" in all six assurances. \nBased on DDS/DDA's \"demonstrated effectiveness of the many newly implemented systems to \nmeet the CMS quality requirements,\" CMS discontinued its intensified monitoring. \nX.  The District's Establishment of An Aggressive Internal Quality-Assurance System \n51.  DDA's Quality Management Division (\"QMD\") monitors all aspects of the \nservice-delivery system to ensure compliance with federal and local law, national best practices, \nand applicable court orders.  The QMD focuses on strengthening DDA's ability to discover areas \nof concern, remediate both discrete and systemic issues, and implement strategies for continuous \nimprovement. \n17 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 19 of 26\n52.  The QMD is divided into four (4) functional units:  Health and Wellness, Quality \nEnhancement and Quality Improvement (\"QE/QI\"), Incident Management and Enforcement \n(\"IMEU\"), and Mortality Review.  The Health and Wellness Unit supports the health of \nindividuals by providing oversight and support to individuals residing in natural homes, nursing \nhomes, hospitals, and small and mid-sized provider agencies.  The oversight includes provision \nof technical assistance, community outreach, and monitoring ofhealthmanagement care plans, \nbehavior support plans, meal protocols, and other treatment regimes necessary to realize optimal \nhealth status and outcomes. In the past quarterly reporting period alone, two (2) individuals were \nsuccessfully transitioned from nursing homes to community-based residential settings as a result \nof this focused assistance. The DDA Health and Wellness Unit and the DC HRP as a contractor \nto DDA work hand-in-hand in these areas across the DDA service delivery system. \n53.  The Quality Enhancement and Quality Improvement Unit currently uses the \nProvider Certification Review (\"PCR\") process as the mechanism that measures provider \nperformance, determines whether the provider/vendor does or does not meet the minimum \nthresholds for performance, and acknowledges each provider as able to deliver services and \nsupports to people served by DDA.  The PCR replaced the Basic Assurance Standards \nAuthorization (\"BASA\") review and is a far superior tool to evaluate quality.  The new PCR \nprocess (1) allows for the identification of positive practices and areas for improvement in \nproviders' services and supports; (2) allows for the ability to aggregate, analyze, and compare \ndata from various sources including information from the Department of Health Health \nRegulation and Licensing Administration (\"HRLA\"), the IMEU, Service Coordination, Provider \nResource Management, Mortality and Fatality Review Committees, and DDS's Contracts \nDepartment; and (3) provides evidence that providers are operating in accordance with HCBS \n18 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 20 of 26\nwaiver regulations, D.C. Rules and Regulations, and DDS/DDA approved policies. Further, \nunder BASA, only a small sub-set ofliving settings, including ICFs/ID, group homes, and \nsupported living residential service providers, were reviewed.  Moreover, only 10% or less of \ntotal recipients of the agency were evaluated.  In contrast, the PCR is applied to a broader range \nof providers including in-home supports, host home services, day habilitation, pre-vocational \nservices and supported employment, and expands the sampling methodology to be statistically \nsignificant for each service delivered by the provider agency.  The implementation of the PCR \nprocess is yet another example of the agency's ability to improve the quality assurance capacity \nof the District. DDS/DDA completed the Request For Proposal (\"RFP\") process to award the \ncontract to a nationally recognized vendor to assume responsibility for certifying all HCBS \nwaiver providers using the PCR and is pending Council approval. The Quality contract also \nincludes an independent audit of the DDA Service Coordination service delivery, providing the \nDDA Director and DHCF with an independent performance evaluation of this critical function. \nA third component ofthis contract includes a 10% sample of all ISPs to assess implementation of \nall services per the ISP on an annual basis.  Both elements are critical performance measures for \nCMS as described in the DDA Quality Management Strategy, and to provision of services to the \nEvans class.  DDA included these elements for an additional high quality, arm's length source of \nperformance measurement ofDDA service delivery, and did so independent of any direction or \nrequirement from an external party. \n54.  DDS/DDA recently undertook an initiative to ensure that Quality Improvement \nSpecialists in the Technical Assistance (\"TA'') Unit increase the number of unannounced visits \nand contacts that occur on a monthly basis.  The QMD began tracking the number of contacts in \nAugust 2008, and since that time, there has been a more than 200% increase in the number of \n19 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 21 of 26\nmonthly contacts (including initial visits, re-visits, unannounced visits, and telephone contact) \nmade by TA staf£  This has allowed the TA Unit to more effectively discover and remediate · \nissues in a timely manner.  Further, QE/QI assumes the responsibility of data integration for all \ninformation that reflects provider performance and its impact on people served through the DDA \nservice-delivery system. \n55.  The IMEU is critical as it provides the mechanism to track and remediate \nproblems, or incidents.  There have been several developments implemented by the District that \nhave contributed to the improvement of the investigatory process.  These include requiring all \ninvestigators to pass LRA Level I certification to improve investigatory skills; assigning \ninvestigators to specifip providers enabling each investigator to better recognize trends in the \nquality of services; providing trainings; and conducting quality assurance review of \ninvestigations submitted by providers.  In fiscal year 2009, IMEU provided training to more than \n20 provider agencies, conducted more than 100 quality assurance reviews, and made \napproximately 40 technical assistance contacts with providers.  In addition, a recent update to the \nConsumer Information System (\"MCIS\") allows DDA to track the outcome of an investigation \nand capture the responsible provider, allowing IMEU to accurately track and trend data for \nspecific providers.  Although the role of the District, and all state DD agencies, is to seek to \nprevent the occurrence of abuse, neglect, theft or a serious injury, these incidents do occur, hence \nthe CMS requirements for a robust system of safeguards for prevention, discovery and \nremediation.  In fiscal year 2009, it is important to note that only 7% of the entire class \nexperienced a substantiated incident of this type. \n56.  The District also has a mortality-review process (consisting of the Fatality Review \nCommittee \"FRC\" and the Mortality Review Committee \"MRC\"), which allows DDS/DDA to \n20 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 22 of 26\nidentify and, as necessary, address potential quality-of-care issues.  In fiscal year 2009, the FRC \nmaintained a 90% compliance rate of reviewing all cases within 90 days.  Further, as of this \nfiling, DDA's MRC has concluded reviews of all completed death investigations pending in \nfiscal year 2009. \n57.  Finally, the HRLA licenses and inspects group homes for persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities and certifies ICFs/ID.  HRLA conducts annual on-site and ad hoc \nmonitoring surveys to ensure that these facilities maintain compliance with District and federal \nhealth, safety, sanitation, and habilitative requirements.  Regulated facilities include Certified \n(Federal) Intermediate Care Facilities and Group Homes for Persons with Mental Retardation. \nXI.  Additional Healthcare Agreement Initiatives \n58.  The Crisis Intervention beds RFP was awarded in the spring of2009, and two (2) \nbeds opened at National Children's Center (\"NCC\") in August 2009. \n59.  The Values Based Training Initiative underwent several ''best and final offers\" \nwith an award being offered at this writing for implementation in fiscal year 2010. \n60.  DDS/DDA developed a comprehensive pre-employment competency-based \ntraining curriculum, associated tests and new Training Policy to enhance the competency of \ndirect support professionals in day/vocational and residential support services throughout the \nDDA service delivery system.  The new requirements are effective October 12, 2010.  The \npolicy, PowerPoint curriculum and competency tests can be accessed on line at www.dds.dc.gov. \n61.  The District obtained permission from CMS and the State of Connecticut to adopt \nthe Connecticut Level of Need Assessment and Risk Screening tool, which is a web-based \ndatabase system producing clear person-centered planning assessment results detailing strengths, \npreferences and support needs in the areas of health and medical supports, behavioral supports, \n21 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 23 of 26\nmental health, mobility, personal care, daily living, comprehension, communication, social life, \nsafety, and caregiver supports.  This tool also generates a \"risk screening\" to assist the individual \nand the team to systematically ensure that each potential risk has been fully explained, evaluated \nand addressed by the person and the team, and is clearly documented in the record.  The software \nand user's guide are being modified for the District's use at this time.  Training and the roll-out \nof the tool is scheduled for the first quarter of this fiscal year. \n62.  As part of the behavioral health initiatives, the DC HRP clinical psychologist \nworks in collaboration with the DDA clinical psychologist on individual, agency and systemic \nissues. He has introduced the use of a Best Practice Guide. This is a method for working with the \nindividual and their direct support staff to identify strategies that promote well-being, identify \nwhen stressors are beginning and how to respond, and identify what to do in the event of a crisis. \nThese simple tools are complementary to the formal behavior support plan, but are easier for the \ndirect support professional (\"DSP\") to understand. In addition, because the DSP is integral to the \ndevelopment of this tool, they are more likely to remember and follow the outlined strategies. \nBest Practice Guides was developed for all of the individuals transitioning from St. Elizabeth's \nto the community, and it has played an important role in transferring the knowledge from the St. \nElizabeth's staff to the new residential setting. \n63.  The clinical psychologist and speech therapist have collaborated on training and \ntechnical assistance aimed at increasing the use of visual teaching strategies, which is an \nessential component of a comprehensive approach for people with autism. The team has also \nworked with community therapists to increase their skills in identifying autism spectrum \ndisorders, particularly in older adults who may have been misdiagnosed. \n22 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 24 of 26\n64.  Health and clinical services training offerings are being developed and held, open \nto the DDA service delivery system. In the period between July and September 2009 alone, DC \nHRP developed and hosted 19 different training sessions on best practice topics in health, \nclinical and behavioral health topics. \nXII.  Inter-Agency Collaboration \n65.  I have chaired the Mayor's Inter-Agency Task Force on Coordination and \nManagement of the Supports and Services Delivery System for Persons with Intellectual and \nDevelopmental Disabilities, as established by Mayor's Order 2009-119 dated June 25, 2009, \nhaving held three (3) meetings to date, to further strengthen the collaboration among agencies. \nComposed ofhigh-levelleadership from DDS/DDA, DHCF, HRLA, and the City \nAdministrator's Office, the Task Force has established a mission statement, and framework \nwithin which to focus problem-solving and initiatives to advance the effectiveness of and \ninnovation in services to persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  Goal/Mission \nStatement:  Because of interagency coordination and collaboration, people with intellectual and \ndevelopmental disabilities (\"ID/DD\") in the District of Columbia will have the supports and \nservices to live full and meaningful lives.  Core Task Force Work Elements: Enhance supports \nand services options; Expand accessible and affordable housing; Grow meaningful work \nopportunities; Improve coordination of school to work transitions; Develop age appropriate \nsupports and living options for elders with ID/DD; Expand accessible transportation options; \nBuild an interagency workforce development initiative; Establish an interagency plan for health \nand wellness; Develop an interagency plan for family supports; Create an interagency early \nintervention plan (birth to three).  This framework addresses a lifespan and inclusive approach to \nservices and supports.  Initial topics of collaborative problem-solving leading to improvements \n23 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 25 of 26\ninclude work on the Nursing Assistive Personnel Training Regulations, and the MTM 1915(b)4 \nwaiver application to design improved transportation services for persons with IDD/DD in the \nMedicaid program. \n66.  The DHCF Medicaid Infrastructure Grant is being used to fund the DDA's \nparticipation in the State Employment Leadership Network (\"SELN\") as evidence of the \nDHCF's support of an employment first agenda to advance the quality of day and vocational \nservices in the District.  DDS/DDA joined the SELN, a cross-state cooperative venture of state \ndevelopmental disability agencies that are committed to improving employment outcomes for \nadolescents and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  The District is one of \nonly 16 participating states. \n67.  DHCF, HRLA and DDA are collaborating on a training initiative for ICF/ID \nproviders aimed at improving the quality of services and supports delivered through that \nresidential service option. \n68.  DHCF, DDS and the District of Columbia Housing Authority have entered into a \nMemorandum of Understanding to improve coordination between the agencies and subsequent \naccess to housing authority vouchers, and to track affordable housing units across the District to \nfacilitate movement to the least restrictive living alternatives. \nXIII.  Conclusion \n69.  The structure and management staff ofthe DDA has remained in place now for \nmore than one and a half years.  I have been in this position for just over two years, two of \nDDA's three Division Directors for eighteen (18) months, the third has been with the \norganization for eight (8) months now, and all of the remaining managers have been in place for \nmore than one year.  Although to those outside of the District that may seem short-lived, for this \n24 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 26 of 26\nhistory, it is evidence of a team committed to the residents of the District and the Evans class \nmembers.  It is this team that seeks to continue to fulfill the obligations of the state DD agency \nto the residents of the District of Columbia without the necessity of further judicial intervention \nand oversight. \nI declare under penalty of petjury that the foregoing statements are true and correct to the \nbest of my information, knowledge and belief.  Executed on October 7, 2009. \nLaura L. Nuss, Deputy Director \nDevelopmental Disabilities Administration \nD.C. Department on Disability Services \n25 ",

This  is a  class action seeking declaratory,  injunctive and \nequitable relief on  behalf of the  named  plaintiffs and  all other \nsimilarly situated residents  of Forest Haven,  an  institution estab-\nIi shed  for the  custody,  care;  education,  training and  treatment  of \nsubstantially retarded persons  of the  District  of Columbia.  Plain-\ntiffs allege that  they  and  all others  similarly  situated are  not \nreceiving a  constitutionally minimal  level of habilitation,  a  term \nwhich  incorporates  care,  treatment,  education and  training.  The \ntreatment,  services and habilitation for a  person with developmen-\ntal disabilities should be  designed to maximize  the  developmental \npotential of the  individual,  and  should be  provided in a  setting \nwhich  is least restrictive of the  individual's personal  liberty. \nPlaintiffs assert  that  every  individual at Forest  Haven  has  pot en. \ntial for greater development  and  that  the  capacities of each resi-\ndent  are  not  presently being developed  to  their fullest.  Plaintiff \nfurther assert that Forest  Haven presently provides  only  the most \nmeager  custodial care which,  while  a  prerequisite  for habilitation, \ndoes  not  accomplish the  goals  of habilitation. \nII \nJURISDICTION \n2.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.s1331.  Claims \ninvolved herein arise under the  First, Fourth,  Fifth and Eighth \nAmendments  to the United States  Constitution and under  42  U.S.C. \n§600l et.  seq.  as  amended.  Such  claims  exceed  $10,000  exclusive  of \ninterest and  costs.  This  Court has pendent  jurisdiction to hear \nclaims  that may  arise  under  32  D.C.  Code  §601  et.  seq. \n-2-\nII \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH -JMF   Document 1028    Filed 02/23/76   Page 3 of 17\nIII \nDECLARATORY  JUDGMENT \n3.  An  actual,  substantial controversy now  exists between PLAINTIFF \nand DEFENDANTS  in that PLAINTIFFS  contend  that  the  conduct  of DEF-\nENDANTS  is unlawful  and  unconstitutional.  DEFENDANTS  have  deliber-\nately subjected PLAINTIFFS  and the  class  they represent to  inade-\nquate,  improper  and  impermissible  conditions,  care and  treatment. \nFurthermore,  and  in derogation of their rights  so  secured by  law, \nEFENDANTS  have  failed to  provide  PLAINTIFFS  with training and  edu-\ncation appropriate to their needs.  Unless  there  is a  declaration \nof the  rights  of  the  PLAINTIFFS  and  of the members  of the  class the \nrepresent,  these unlawful  acts,  practices and  omissions  of DEFEN-\nANTS  will continue.  This  Court  may  issue a  declaratory  judgment \nursuant  to  28  U.S.C.§§2201  and  2202. \nIV \nINJUNCTIVE  RELIEF \n4.  PLAINTIFFS  and  the  class they  represent have  suffered and  will \ncontinue to suffer irreparable harm,  injury and  loss,  for which \nthey have  no  adequate  remedy  at  law,  unless  DEFENDANTS  are  restrain \ned  from  continuing the acts,  practices and  omissions  referred to \nherein,  and unless  DEFENDANTS  are  required to take  affirmative \nactions  to dissipate the effects of their unlawful behavior.  The \nCourt  may  issue an  injunction pursuant to Rule  65  of the  Federal \nRules  of Civil Procedure. \nV \nPLAINTIFFS \n5.  PLAINTIFF JOY  EVANS,  age  17,  brings  this action by  and  through \nher parents and next  friends  BETTY  JANE  EVANS  and HAROLD  G.  EVANS. \nPLAINTIFF EVANS  has  been a  resident  of Forest Haven  by  civil order \nof the  court  since April 1967.  PLAINTIFF EVANS  suffers from  sever-\nal physical disabilities associated with the disease which  has \ncaused her retardation.  Especially troublesome  are  heart  complica-\n-3-\n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH -JMF   Document 1028    Filed 02/23/76   Page 4 of 17\nions,  liver damage,  and  a  hernia.  These  conditions  combine  to re \nuire  that PLAINTIFF  EVANS  be  treated in a  special manner  different \nfrom  other persons  at Forest Haven.  Such a  treatment  program does \not  exist. \nDuring her first  few  months  of residency at  Forest Haven,  PLAI  -\nTIFF EVANS  sustained numerous  injuries.  In addition,  it was  neces \nsary  for her to be  treated by  the  family's  personal physician for \nan ulcerated skin condition caused by her being restrained on  a \nurine-covered mattress.  This  condition was  neither diagnosed nor \ntreated by medical staff at Forest  Haven.  In September 1968,  PLAIN \nTIFF EVANS  was  hospitalized at D.C.  General Hospital with several \ninjuries whose  origin was  attributed first to  the  staff and  later \nto  other residents.  PLAINTIFF EVANS  was  discharged from D.C.  Gener \nal Hospital to the  care  of her parents  in November 1968,  and  she \nremained  at her parents'  home  until June 1970,  when  she was  returne \nto Forest  Haven.  She  has  since that  time  suffered lacerations, \nscratches and bruises,  apparently inflicted by  other residents. \nAlthough  she has received one  dental  examination during her resi \ndency  at Forest Haven,  PLAINTIFF EVANS  has  received no  dental treat \nment  whatsoever. \nPLAINTIFF  EVANS  has  had the benefit of approximately eight \nmonths  of education and  training during her residency at Forest \nHaven;  this took place  from  approximately January  through August \n1975.  She  has  received no  other substantive education or training \nbefore or since that  time.  To  the  best of her parents'  knowledge, \nthere  exists no  treatment  plan of any kind  for PLAINTIFF  EVANS. \n6.  PLAINTIFF VENITA  FELTON,  age  26,  brings this  action by  and \nthrough her mother and  next  friend,  THERESSA  FELTON.  PLAINTIFF \nFELTON  was  admitted  to Forest  Haven  by  civil court  order in May \n1955.  She  remained  there until 1965, when  she was  transferred to \n-4-\n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH -JMF   Document 1028    Filed 02/23/76   Page 5 of 17\nSt.  Elizabeth's Hospital.  She was  returned to Forest Haven  in \n1970,  and was  again transferred to St.  Elizabeth's Hospital in 1971; \nshe  remained there until 1973.  She  has  resided at Forest  Haven \nsince 1973. \nPrior to her initial commitment  to Forest  Haven  in 1955,  PLAIN \nTIFF FELTON  was  able partially to  fend  for herself,  including put \nting on her socks,  brushing her hair,  getting drinks  of water,  and \nattempting to use  the  toilet.  She  has  now  regressed in all of thes \nareas,  although records  of her stays at St.  Elizabeth's Hospital \nindicate that  she made  some  progress  in some  of these areas  during \nher time there. \nPLAINTIFF  FELTON  has  been restrained on  several occasions. \nShe  has  suffered various  injuries caused by bed  strap restraints. \nOn  at  least three  occasions,  PLAINTIFF FELTON  suffered burns, \nbruises and  lacerations over  various parts of her body.  PLAINTIFF \nFELTON  has  received no  dental  care whatsoever while  a  resident at \nForest  Haven.  PLAINTIFF  FELTON  is so heavily and  continually se \ndated with medication that  she  often falls  asleep  during the  day. \nThere exists no  individual treatment  or educational plan for \nPLAINTIFF  FELTON. \nSome  of PLAINTIFF FELTON's  transfers to and  from  the D.C. \nChildren's Center and  St.  Elizabeth's Hospital were made  without \nthe mother's  knowledge  or consent. \n7.  PLAINTIFF  CHRISTINE  EXTON,  age  30,  brings  this action by  and \nthrough her mother and  next  friend,  ALICE  DE  GRAFFENREIDT.  PLAIN \nTIFF EXTON  was  admitted to Forest Haven  by  civil court  order in \n1959.  She  has  resided there  since that time.  When  she  lived at \nhome,  PLAINTIFF EXTON  could eat with a  fork or  spoon;  now  she  eats \nwith her hands.

PLAINTIFF JOSEPH  SCATES,  age  21,  brings  this  action by and \nthrough his mother and  next  friend,  VICTORIA  SCATES.  PLAINTIFF \nSCATES  was  admitted to Forest  Haven  by  civil court  order in 1969; \nhe  has  resided there  since that time.  Before his residency began \nat  Forest  Haven,  PLAINTIFF  SCATES  was  able  to bathe himself and \nspell simple words;  now  he  has  lost these  skills.  Although  he  was \na  lively and  active  child before 1969,  he  is now  generally sleepy \nand  listless, apparently  due  to heavy  sedation.  He  is presently \nnot  attending school an~ is not  receiving any  form  of education  or \nv \ntreatment. \nPLAINTIFF  SCATES  has  suffered welts and  bruises on his  legs  as \nthe result  of beatings;  his teeth were  knocked  into his  gums  in \n1974.  In 1974,  PLAINTIFF  SCATES's  arms  and  shoulders received cig \narette burns.  During the  summer  of 1975,  he  suffered severe burns \nas  the result of hot  water being sprayed on him  in the  shower room. \nThe  mother has never been  notified of these  injuries to her son  by \nofficials at Forest  Haven,  but  discovered them when  she  visited him \nthere.  In at least  one  instance,  PLAINTIFF  SCATES  was  treated by  a \nprivate phYSician at  the  initiative of his mother.  PLAINTIFF  SCATE  ' \nteeth are  presently in. need  of dental  care. \n-6-\n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH -JMF   Document 1028    Filed 02/23/76   Page 7 of 17\n9.  PLAINTIFF  WILLIAM  BROWN,  age  13,  brings  this action by  and \nthrough his mother and  next  friend,  RETHA  BROWN.  PLAINTIFF  BROWN \nwas  committed to Forest  Haven  by  civil court  order in 1967.  While \nhe  has not  resided at Forest Haven  continuously,  he  has  spent  sub \nstantial periods  of time  there.  Prior to his more  recent  residency \nat Forest Haven,  PLAINTIFF  BROWN  could read at  the  third grade  leve  , \nhang up  his own  clothing,  and  cook  simple meals.  He  has  now  signi \nficantly regressed in his  abilities to do  these  tasks. \nPLAINTIFF  BROWN  has  experienced  heightened  sexual impulses  as \nhe  approached adolescence.  While  at Forest Haven,  he was  denied \nsocial contact with  females.  He  developed aggressive  homosexual \ntendencies  and  began to think of himself as  a  female.  PLAINTIFF \nBROWN  did not  receive any  counseling or treatment  during his resi \ndency  at  Forest Haven,  except  on  one  occasion in December 1974. \nThe  lack of recreational  or other therapy has  caused PLAINTIFF \nBROWN  to become  overly concerned with sex. \nDuring PLAINTIFF  BROWN's  second residency at Forest Haven,  his \nmother's visiting privileges were  restricted to Sunday.  He  was \nprovided by  staff at Forest  Haven with  clothing which was  ragged or \ntoo small.  New  clothing brought  him  by  his  mother disappeared. \nPLAINTIFF  BROWN  was  continually denied  enough  food  considering his \nheight  and weight. \n10.  PLAINTIFF  JOHN  KENNEDY,  Jr.,  age  23,  brings  this action by  an \nthrough his mother and  next  friend MARY  M.  MUSE.  PLAINTIFF  KENNEDY \nwas  committed to Forest  Haven  by  civil court  order in approximately \n1960.  He  resided  there until approximately 1968,  when  he  was  put \non an  extended  leave  status.  His  mother was  told to keep  him as \nlong as  she  could control him.  He  has  been returned to Forest \nHaven  several times  in the past  few  years.  PLAINTIFF  KENNEDY  is \npresently confined in Lorton Reformatory. \n-7-\n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH -JMF   Document 1028    Filed 02/23/76   Page 8 of 17\nPLAINTIFF KENNEDY  received psychological testing at  the  time  0 \nhis admission to Forest  Haven;  he  has  received no  testing since  tha \ntime.  While  a  resident  at Forest Haven,  PLAINTIFF  KENNEDY  received \nno  educational,  vocational,  or other training,  or any mental health \ntreatment.  In addition,  PLAINTIFF  KENNEDY  experienced problems \nwith the  staff and  was  punished with  extended periods  of confinemen \nin a  separate residence. \nSince PLAINTIFF  KENNEDY  has  been placed on  extended  leave,  his \nmother has made  extensive  efforts through Forest  Haven,  as well  as \nthrough the Department  of Vocational Rehabilitation and  several \nother sources,  to  secure vocational and  educational training for he \nson.  During this time,  DEFENDANTS  have  failed to provide PLAINTIFF \nKENNEDY  with suitable training and treatment.  As  a  result,  PLAIN-\nTIFF KENNEDY  has  been  left on his  own  and  has  developed  a  criminal \nrecord.  DEFENDANTS  claim that  there  is no  program to help  their \nward,  PLAINTIFF  KENNEDY.  Because  of this  claim,  PLAINTIFF  KENNEDY \nhas  been ordered by  a  court  to  be  transferred to a  federal rehabili \ntation center in Springfield, Missouri. \nVI \nDEFENDANTS \n11.  DEFENDANT  WALTER  E.  WASHINGTON  is sued  individually and  in his \nofficial capacity as Mayor  of the District of Columbia.  He  exer-\ncises overall responsibility for the operation  of all public  insti-\ntutions. \n12.  DEFENDANT  JOSEPH  P.

As  such,  he  is responsible  for providing the  super-\nvision and  control of public  facilities pertaining to the mental \nhealth of the  citizens  of the District of Columbia. \n14.  DEFENDANT  LEONARD  W.  ALLEN,  M.D.,  is sued individually and  in \nhis  official capacity as  Chief of the  Bureau  of Developmental Dis-\nabilities, in the  Department  of Human  Resources  for the  District of \nColumbia.  He  is responsible  for oversight  of the development  of \nfacilities and programs  for  those  citizens of the District of Colum \nbia who  have  developmental disabilities. \n15.  DEFENDANT  ROLAND  J.  QUEEN  is sued individually and  in his offi \ncial capacity  as  Superintendent  of Forest Haven.  As  such,  he  is th \nchief executive  officer of the  institution and  is charged with the \nresponsibility for its overall operation. \nVII \nCLASS  ACTION \n16. \na.  PLAINTIFFS  bring this action pursuant  to Rule  23(b)(2)  of \nthe  Federal Rules  of Civil Procedure.  It is brought  on behalf of \nall residents of Forest  Haven  both past  and  present,  who  could bene \nfit  from  individual treatment  and  educational programs  appropriate \nto their needs.  The  class  consists  of over 1,000 members  and  is  so \nnumerous  that  joinder of all its members  is impracticable.  The \nnamed  PLAINTIFFS  will adequately represent the  class as  a  whole. \nb.  The  claims,  age,  sex and  capacity to benefit  from habili-\ntation,  including suitable  care,  treatment,  education and training \nof the  named  individual  PLAINTIFFS,  are not  precisely identical to \neach class member.  Nevertheless,  they  are typical and  representa-\ntive of the  claims  and  characteristics of the  members  of the  class. \nTherefore,  the named  PLAINTIFFS  will adequately  represent  the  in-\nterests of all class members. \nc.  DEFENDANTS  have  acted or refused to act  on  grounds  general y \napplicable to the  class,  thereby  making  final injunctive relief \n-9-\n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH -JMF   Document 1028    Filed 02/23/76   Page 10 of 17\nand/or corresponding declaratory relief appropriate with respect  to \nthe  class as  a  whole. \nd.  The  questions  of law and  fact  common  to the  class include \nquestions  whether the acts,  practices,  omissions  and  conditions \nperpetrated by DEFENDANTS  are  unconstitutional and  impermissible. \ne.  For the  foregoing reasons,  it is apparent  that a  class \naction is the most  appropriate method  for  adjudicating the  claims \nraised in this action. \nVIII \nSTATEMENT  OF  FACTS \n17. \na.  Forest Haven  is located in Maryland,  twenty-two miles \nnortheast  of Washington,  D.C.  It was  built in 1925,  and  consists \nof seventeen one- and two~storey buildings in various  stages  of \ndisrepair and neglect. \nb.  The  least  severely retarded residents live in cottages. \nThe  most  severely retarded residents live in the Curley Building \nwhich  accommodates  approximately two  hundred people. \nc.  The  approximately 1050  residents are  overwhelmingly  black \nand  from  low-income  backgrounds.  The  ages  parallel those  of the \ncommunity  at  large,  while  intellectual functioning ranges  from  very \nlow  to nearly normal.  Segregation of the  sexes  is strictly main-\ntained;  partly as a  result,  homosexuality  flourishes. \nd.  All of the named  PLAINTIFFS  and  almost  all of the other \nresidents of Forest Haven  have  been  committed there  by  order of a \ncivil court. \n18.  While  the purpose  of commitment  to Forest Haven  includes  trea -\nment,  education and  training,  residents receive virtually no  treat \nment.  No  comprehensive habilitation program is designed  at  the \ntime  of admission or at any  subsequent  time  to meet  the  individual \ntreatment,  educational and  custodial needs  of each resident.  This \n-10-\n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH -JMF   Document 1028    Filed 02/23/76   Page 11 of 17\nis true  for  the  residents with other special needs  in addition to \nmental  retardation,  as well as  for  those whose  needs  derive  solely \nfrom  retardation.  Frequently,  social and personal  care  skills ac \nquired prior to  admission to Forest Haven  are  lost  as  a  result of \na  lack of any  habilitation programs. \n19. \na.  Doors  are  often locked without  reason  so  that the  resi-\ndents'  movements  are  unduly  restricted.  Residents  are  forced there \nby  to regard themselves  as  prisoners rather than as  people  in need \nof special care and  treatment. \nb.  Many  Forest  Haven  residents  live in buildings  and  cottages \nwhich  are  extremely old and poorly designed,  creating both  fire  and \nsafety hazards.  Many  structures are  filthy;  only emergency  main \ntainance  is performed.  Dim  lights,  broken  steps and  falling paint \nadd  to the depressing atmosphere.  The  buildings are  often either \ntoo hot  or too  cold for  the health and  comfort  of residents. \nc.  The  areas  in --which most  residents  live are  sparsely fur \nnished and  are  strikingly devoid of lamps,  sofas,  rugs,  comfortable \nchairs,  pictures,  magazines,  books,  toys,  games  and  the  other ac \ncoutrements of normal  living. \nd.  Many  residents are required to  sleep  in large,  20-person, \nbarren dormitories;  beds  have  little space  between them.  Residents \nhave  no  privacy and  no  place  to keep  personal possessions  because \nthese  large rooms  lack partitions and  closets. \ne.  Toilets often do  not  have  seats.  There are  generally no \nwalls,  partitions or curtains between toilets.  In  some  buildings \nthe  toilet facilities are kept  locked. \nf.  Residents  are  often locked  in isolation rooms  without  fur \nnishings  other than  a  vinyl mattress.  These  rooms  lack material 0 \nthe walls  and  on the  floor which would  adequately protect their \nresidents  from  inadvertent  or self-inflicted injury. \n-11-\n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH -JMF   Document 1028    Filed 02/23/76   Page 12 of 17\ng.  Dining room facilities are  so unsanitary as  to discourage \nany normal person from  eating there. \nh.  Residents  or their families  often find themselves  forced \nto buy  soap  and  other supplies because  of the extreme  shortage  of \nsupplies provided the  residents by  officials at the  institution. \n20. \na.  Inadequate  staffing at  Forest Haven  results in the  resi \ndents being provided with  only marginally adequate  custodial care. \nb.  Some  residents have  been beaten or physically abused  by \nForest'Haven staff; other residents have  been beaten or abused, \neither physically or sexually,  by  their peers. \nc.  Because  of inadequate  staffing at  Forest Haven,  only  a  fe \nresidents have  any  opportunity to engage  in any  kind  of schooling, \ntraining,  recreational or vocational experiences.  The  vast major \nity of residents  spend their days  at  Forest  Haven  in forced  inac \ntivity.  Many  are over-medicated and exhibit  such  behavior as  head \nnodding and/or body posturing.  These  behaviors  are more  the  resul \nof prolonged deprivation than of mental retardation. \nd.  The  number  of employees  authorized for Forest  Haven  is \nmarkedly  inadequate.  There  are  numerous  vacancies as  a  result  of \njob  freeze  instituted by DEFENDANTS.  Many  staff members  have  left \nForest  Haven and the  institution has  not  been permitted by  those \nDEFENDANTS  to fill the  vacancies,  a  situation unlike that  in some \nother departments within the District of Columbia. \ne.  In addition,  Forest  Haven  experiences a  very high absente \nrate.  As  a  result,  the  number of staff members  available  to care \nfor residents on  a  daily basis is  substantially less than that \nlisted in the  employment  records. \nf.  Forest Haven  does  not provide an  adequate  in-service trai -\ning program for its existing employees.  The  absence  of such a  pro \ngram diminishes  the  effectiveness of the  staff which  remains. \n-12-\n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH -JMF   Document 1028    Filed 02/23/76   Page 13 of 17\n21. \na.  Forest  Haven does  not  employ  sufficient medical and  clini-\ncal personnel to provide  adequate physical and  mental health  care \nfor its residents. \nb.  Drugs  are  frequently  used  to  control patients who  are \ndifficult to manage;  medication is often administered  by  unlicensed \nattendants without  medical  training.  Physi'cal restraints such as \nstraight-jackets and wrist  straps are  used to excess. \nc.  Some  residents are not  promptly treated for their injuries \nand  illnesses.  In  some  cases,  no  treatment has  been  given despite \nrequests  for it by  the  residents or their parents.  There  is  appar \nently no  continuing program of health care  Dr prevention,  including \ninitial and  annual medical,  dental and  developmental  examinations. \nd.  Dental care  is totally inadequate and  programs  of preven \ntive dental treatment  appear to be  completely  lacking. \ne.  Residents  are  not  provided an  adequate,  nutritious and \nwell-balanced diet.  Many  residents do  not  get  enough  to eat;  some \nare unable  to  eat  enough  because  they  are  unable  to feed  themselves. \nSome  residents are  not  provided with  eating utensils. \nf.  Forest Haven  has  yet to compile  adequate,  complete  records \non every resident.  Sucn records  that  do  exist do  not  necessarily \ninclude the resident's admission history, medical,  dental and  dev \nelopmental diagnosis  and progress,  or the  therapeutic  and  education \nal goals and  achievements  during her/his residency at Forest Haven. \ng.  Neither residents nor their parents  are  notified in writ \ning of their rights and responsibilities when  the  resident  is ad \nmitted to Forest  Haven,  or at  any  subsequent  time.  Major  decisions \nconcerning residents are  often made  by  Forest Haven  officials with \nout  consulting with the parents or  the  residents. \n22.  After-care and  rehabilitation programs  and vocational training \nfor  former  residents of Forest Haven  are  non-existent.  This  result \n-13-\n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH -JMF   Document 1028    Filed 02/23/76   Page 14 of 17\nin severe difficulty for both the former resident  and  for  the par-\nent  as  each tries to integrate the  former  resident  into the  commun-\nity at  large. \n23.  The  District of Columbia Government  has  budgeted  for,  and  the \nCongress  of the United States has  approved,  a  plan under which \nForest  Haven's  annual budget would  be  increased from  $8  million to \n$16  million for personnel,  supplies,  and  programs,  over an  eight-\nyear period beginning in the  1974  fiscal year.  Congress  approved \nthis increase because  of widespread protest  over conditions  at the \ninstitution.  So  far only  $675,000  of the new  funds  have material-\nized over the past  two  years,  despite the  fact  that  $1.2 million \nthe  first year and  $2.2 million the  second year have  been author-\nized. \n24.  The  Department  of Human  Resources  has  either failed to apply \nfor or is ineligible to receive  grants  from the United States gov-\nernment  because  of its failure  to  spend  the  monies  authorized by \nthe  actions  detailed in paragraph  23  herein.  Grants  or other funds \nwhich might  have  been available were  not  in fact  forthcoming  be-\ncause  the  institution failed  to  comply with  appropriate  standards. \nIX \nFIRST CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n25.  As  a  first  cause  of action,  PLAINTIFFS  allege as  follows: \nPLAINTIFFS  incorporate by  reference paragraphs  17  through  24. \nThe  conditions,  practices and  omissions  alleged in paragraphs  17 \nthrough  24  constitute a  denial of rights guaranteed PLAINTIFFS \nunder the Fifth Amendment  to the  United  States  Constitution. \nX \nSECOND  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n26.  As  a  second  cause  of action,  PLAINTIFFS  allege as  follows: \nPLAINTIFFS  incorporate by  reference paragraphs  17  through  22. \n-14-\n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH -JMF   Document 1028    Filed 02/23/76   Page 15 of 17\nThe  conditions,  practices and  omissions alleged in paragraphs 17 \nthrough  22  constitute a  denial of rights guaranteed PLAINTIFFS \nunder the Eighth Amendment  to the  United States Constitution. \nXI \nTHIRD  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n27.  As  a  third cause  of action,  PLAINTIFFS  allege as  follows: \nPLAINTIFFS  incorporate  by  reference paragraphs  17  through 22. \nThe  conditions,  practices and  omissions  alleged in paragraphs  17 \nthrough  22  constitute a  denial of rights  guaranteed PLAINTIFFS \nunder the  First Amendment  to the United States Constitution. \nXII \nFOURTH  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n28.  As  a  fourth  cause  of action,  PLAINTIFFS  allege as  follows: \nPLAINTIFFS  incorporate by reference paragraphs  17  through  22. \nThe  conditions,  practices and  omissions  alleged in paragraphs  17 \nthrough 22  constitute a  violation of rights guaranteed PLAINTIFFS \nunder the  Fourth Amendment  to  the  United States Constitution. \nXIII \nFIFTH  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n29.  As  a  fifth cause  of action,  PLAINTIFFS  allege as  follows: \nPLAINTIFFS  incorporate  by  reference paragraphs 17 through  22. \nThe  conditions,  practices and  omissions  alleged in paragraphs  17 \nthrough  22  constitute a  violation of rights guaranteed  PLAINTIFFS \nunder the  \"Developmentally Disabled Assistance and  Bill of Rights \nAct,\"  42  U.S.C.§6001  et.  seq.  as  amended. \nXIV \nSIXTH  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n30.  As  a  sixth cause of action,  PLAINTIFFS  allege as  follows: \nPLAINTIFFS  incorporate by  reference  paragraphs  17  through 22. \nThe  conditions,  practices and  omissions alleged in paragraphs  17 \nthrough 22  constitute violations of 32  D.C.

That  the  Court  enter a  judgment  declaring that Forest Haven \ndoes  not  meet  constitutionally minimum  standards  of adequate hab-\nilitation,  including care,  treatment,  education and  training.  That \nit further declare that the acts and  omissions  complained of here-\nin violate the First, Fourth,  Fifth and  Eighth Amendments  to the \nUnited  States Constitution;  42  U.S.C.§6001  et.  seq.  and  32  D.C. \nCode  §601  et.  seq. \n2.  That  the  Court permanently enjoin DEFENDANTS  from  continuing to \noperate Forest Haven  in a  manner which violates the rights of its \nresidents and  that  the  Court  require DEFENDANTS  to provide  for the \nresidents of Forest Haven,  such appropriate  and  additional habili-\ntation as may  be  necessary to prevent  further regression and deter-\nioration they have  suffered as  a  result  of being residents at \nForest  Haven. \n3.  That  the Court maintain continuing jurisdiction of this  case. \n4.  That  PLAINTIFFS  be  ~warded the  costs of this proceeding. \n5.

DECLARATORY AND PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n1. The mentally retarded residents of Forest Haven who constitute the plaintiff class (hereinafter class members)\nhave a federal constitutional right to habilitative care and treatment based upon the Due Process Clause of the\nFifth Amendment.\n2. Each class member has a federal constitutional right to be free from harm based upon the Fifth and Eighth\nAmendments.\n3. Each class member has a federal constitutional right, based upon the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\nAmendment, to receive habilitative care and treatment in the alternative least restrictive of individual liberty and to\nbe kept free from harm.\nHabilitation is the process by which a resident is assisted in acquiring and maintaining those life skills which\nenable him to cope more effectively with the demands of his own person and of his environment and to raise the\nlevel of his physical, mental, and social capabilities. Habilitation includes but is not limited to, programs of formal,\nstructured education and training.\nHabilitative care in the alternative least restrictive of individual liberty means living as normally as possible and\nreceiving appropriate individualized services in the community in the least separate, most integrated and least\nrestrictive settings.\nAs used in this Order, \"integrated\" refers to the integration of mentally retarded persons with nonretarded persons\nin the community.\n\n4. The Court finds that violations of the federal constitutional rights of class members, as set forth in paragraphs 1\nthru 3, supra, have occurred.\nII.

Such community living arrangements, programs and other services shall be provided in the least\nseparate, most integrated and least restrictive community settings.\nc) Develop a Plan of Implementation as referenced at paragraph 7, infra, for the provision of such community\nliving arrangements, programs and supportive services. The community living arrangements to be provided shall\nin no event house in a single residence more than eight mentally retarded persons; except that if defendants find\nthat the medical needs of certain residents are such as to require, in defendants' estimation, placement in\nfacilities housing more than eight mentally retarded persons, defendants shall (i) identify such residents in the\nPlan and in the reports provided for in paragraph 6, infra, as the situation may arise and (ii) set forth proposed\ntypes of placements for such residents and the rationales therefor.\nd) Provide all necessary and proper monitoring mechanisms to assure that community living arrangements,\nprograms and supportive community services of the necessary quantity and quality are provided and maintained.\ne) Defendants shall make every reasonable effort, including seeking such additional funding as may be required,\nto secure the expert services of an independent private organization for the preparation of a demographic study,\nto be completed by December 31, 1978, of the capacity of the District of Columbia area to accommodate Forest\nHaven residents in appropriate community living arrangements.

Farrell, Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll, Washington, DC, Special Master.\nOPINION AND ORDER\nHARRIS, District Judge.\nOn February 10, 1999, the Court issued an Opinion and Order by which it granted the motions of plaintiffs and\nthe United States to find defendants in contempt for their failure to comply with certain earlier Orders in this case.\nThe Court imposed contempt fines of $5,096,340.00 against defendants. In addition, the Court ordered the\nSpecial Master, in cooperation and conjunction with the parties, if possible, to develop a plan for the conclusion of\nthis action which would address the disposition of the fines to have been paid by defendants and make\nsuggestions for post-litigation mechanisms to ensure the protection of the plaintiff class' continuing interests in\nadequate habilitation. Evans v. Williams, 35 F.Supp.2d 88, 97 (D.D.C.1999).\nAmong other things, the plan was to address:\n(1) A summary and articulation of the goals of this lawsuit;\n(2) The status of compliance with various Court Orders;\n(3) The quality assurance methods to be developed and implemented by defendants to monitor the performance\nof public and private providers of service;\n81 *81 (4) The standards, including outcomes standards to be developed and implemented by defendants, that\nshould be used to determine defendants' continuing compliance with Court-ordered requirements, and the way in\nwhich compliance with such standards should be measured;\n(5) The degree of compliance that should be required with respect to each of the standards recommended;\n(6) The steps necessary to establish permanent, objective, efficient, and effective post-termination monitoring of\nthe programs serving consumers by independent entities; and\n(7) The steps necessary to coordinate existing mechanisms and to develop needed mechanisms for the\nadvocacy of the interests of consumers on an individual and community-wide basis.\n\nDefendants appealed the Court's imposition of contempt fines. On March 31, 2000, the Court of Appeals\nreversed this Court's decision on the majority of the contempt fines. Evans v. Williams, 206 F.3d 1292\n(D.C.Cir.2000).\nPursuant to the Court's February 1999 Order, under the direction of the Special Master, Margaret G. Farrell, with\nthe assistance of her then-consultant, Clarence J. Sundram, the parties engaged in lengthy negotiations that\nresulted in a series of agreements that have been presented for acceptance and approval. The documents now\nbefore the Court include:\n(1) The 2001 Plan for Compliance and Conclusion of Evans v. Williams (hereinafter the Plan);\n(2) A Consent Order and accompanying Settlement Agreement, filed on February 2, 2001; and\n(3) The Parties' Joint Stipulated Findings of Fact, filed on December 22, 2000.\nTaken together, these documents, fashioned collaboratively by the parties who are represented by able and\nexperienced counsel, set forth a careful and detailed blueprint for achieving compliance with the Court's Orders,\nfor the development of permanent and independent mechanisms to safeguard the rights of class members, and\nfor the phased withdrawal of judicial oversight of the District of Columbia's mental retardation system as\ncompliance with the Court's Orders is achieved.\nThe Stipulated Findings of Fact and the Consent Order00with the Settlement Agreement00will be sent for\n97 97\npublication with this Opinion and Order.

Williams\nResponding to this Court's Order of February 10, 1999, the Plan identifies the eight goals of the existing Court\nOrders as follows:\n(1) Appropriate individual habilitation in the community in the least separate, most integrated, and least restrictive\nenvironment;\n(2) Protection from harm;\n(3) Safeguarding consumers' personal possessions;\n(4) Monitoring the service system;\n(5) Advocacy for consumers;\n(6) Adequate budget;\n(7) Timely payment of vendors; and\n(8) Essential systemic conditions.\nFor each of these broad goals of the prior Court Orders, the Plan identifies clear and measurable expectations of\nperformance by providers of service and by the District of Columbia government. It identifies the relevant Court\nOrders, the specific tasks that must be performed to implement those Orders, and time frames within which the\n82 tasks must be performed. *82 For each set of Court Orders, the Plan identifies specific outcome criteria for\nmeasuring compliance therewith. This agreement by the parties on the yardsticks to be utilized in making\ndeterminations of compliance provides clear guidance to providers as well as to the District of Columbia\ngovernment in implementing the Plan. Moreover, the Plan also identifies a specific standard of compliance for\neach set of Court Orders, and sets forth the methods by which evidence will be collected and evaluated to assess\ncompliance.\n\nThe Plan details a process for identifying individualized needs for services and supports, with input from class\nmembers, their families or guardians, case managers, clinical professionals and direct care staff, and advocates.\nIt requires the aggregation of information regarding the needs for services and supports to enable its use in\nplanning and budgeting for the overall mental retardation service system. It provides for an explicit opportunity for\nplaintiffs to review and comment upon the adequacy of proposed budgets to meet the needs of individuals who\nrely upon the mental retardation system for services and supports. Furthermore, it creates a process for external\nand independent monitors to have input into the budget-making process based upon their findings during\nmonitoring of the services and supports available to individuals with mental retardation and developmental\ndisabilities.\nThe Plan requires a broad range of competency-based training to be provided to staff who deliver services and\nsupports to individuals with metal retardation and developmental disabilities. It also requires that a wide range of\npolicies and procedures be revised and updated to reflect the goals of the Court Orders, in a process that is open\nand accessible to plaintiffs, the United States, and other interested stakeholders.\nThe Plan requires audits of the class members' accounts going back for at least ten years and includes a\ncommitment by the District of Columbia government to repay any sums of money that may be owed to them.\nThe Plan creates several new safeguards for individuals with mental retardation and developmental disabilities in\nthe District of Columbia. First, it calls for a complete revision of the existing statutes to establish in law the rights\nthat have been declared in the Court's Orders, while also updating the laws, consistent with a set of legislative\nprinciples agreed upon by the parties, to reflect contemporary standards and practices. Second, it requires the\ncreation of a new quality assurance program, the implementation of a new procedure for the reporting and\ninvestigation of unusual incidents, the creation of a Fatality Review Board, and the adoption of new mechanisms\nto prevent the misuse or overuse of control procedures such as restraints, time-outs, and psychotropic\nmedications. Third, it recognizes that the enforcement of rights that have been legally declared requires access to\neffective legal and lay advocacy. A cornerstone of the Plan is the creation of a new, independent, and durable\nnonprofit agency called the Quality Trust for Individuals with Disabilities (the Quality Trust) and the provision of a\nmethod of financing its operations so as eventually to provide for its financial independence from the annual\nDistrict of Columbia budgeting process.\nThe Quality Trust will have three essential functions. First, it will provide independent monitoring of the quality of\nservices and supports available to individuals with mental retardation and developmental disabilities, and serve\nas an independent voice for consumers in dealing with the District of Columbia government. Second, it will\n83 provide lay advocacy to represent *83 consumers with respect to day-to-day issues that affect their quality of life\nand their access to services and supports, including representation in grievance and administrative proceedings.\nThird, it will not only provide legal representation for those individuals who have no lawyers but also will be a\nresource to other legal advocates and help raise the standard of legal representation of individuals with mental\nretardation and developmental disabilities. Such legal representation and lay advocacy services are intended to\nsupplement, not supplant, the services that already are required by law.\nUntil this case is terminated, the Court Monitor also will remain as a safeguard for class members. The Plan\nprovides for a close working relationship between the Court Monitor and the Quality Trust to avoid unnecessary\nduplication of effort. As defendants achieve compliance with the outcome criteria in the Plan, and the related\nCourt Orders are vacated, the jurisdiction for monitoring conditions will shift from the Court Monitor to the Quality\nTrust.\nWhile the Plan is not intended to be an independently enforceable document, the parties do intend that there will\nbe accountability for its implementation. The Plan requires periodic progress reports to the Special Master on its\nimplementation and calls for status conferences with the Court to be scheduled at least bimonthly. The parties\nagree that if the Court finds that defendants have satisfied the outcome criteria set forth in the Plan, they also will\nbe in compliance with the related Court Orders. Any failure of defendants to implement the tasks identified in the\nPlan so as to meet the requirements of the related Court Orders would be evidence of noncompliance with those\nOrders. The Plan provides that until the existing Court Orders are vacated, plaintiffs may seek appropriate judicial\nrelief, including requesting orders requiring compliance with the Order(s) underlying the objectives of the Plan.\n\nFinally, the Plan provides for a phased and orderly withdrawal of judicial oversight of the District of Columbia's\nmanagement of its mental retardation service system. The mechanisms set forth in the Plan provide that\ndefendants may move the Special Master for a finding of compliance with particular Orders when they believe\nthat they have achieved compliance. Plaintiffs and the United States have the right to object to any such motion\nand to have an evidentiary hearing before the Special Master. The Special Master then is to submit to the Court\nproposed findings of fact and conclusions of law based upon the evidence introduced during the hearing. If the\nCourt concludes that defendants have achieved compliance, it may vacate and dismiss the related Court Order\n(s). Once all of the Court Orders are vacated after defendants establish that they have achieved compliance, the\ndeclaratory judgment in this case will remain.\nThe Consent Order and the Settlement Agreement\nThe Consent Order and the Settlement Agreement (with the latter being Exhibit A to the former) create an\nexternal monitoring body to permanently protect the interests of the class members once this case ends.\nConsent Order. In the Consent Order, defendants have agreed to fund the Quality Trust with a total of $31.5\nmillion over the next eleven years. Initially, defendants shall endow the Quality Trust with $11 million in order to\nbetter ensure its financial independence in carrying out its duties. The $11 million endowment is to be deposited\n84 in an interest bearing account for the sole use of the Quality Trust. So that the endowment may grow, defendants \n*84 have agreed to provide $2 million in annual funding for the exclusive use of the Quality Trust for the first five\nfull years of its existence. During that time, the endowment will be allowed to grow earnings so as to increase the\nprincipal. For the next five years, defendants have agreed to fund the Quality Trust with gradually decreasing\namounts of annual funding: in 2006, $1.9 million; in 2007, $1.8 million; in 2008, $1.7 million; in 2009, $1.6 million;\nand in 2010, $1.5 million. If needed during this time, the annual earnings of the endowment's principal may be\nused as supplementary money to fund the operations of the Quality Trust. Between now and the beginning of the\nfirst fiscal year, defendants have agreed to pay to the Quality Trust an additional $2 million, prorated for the\nperiod of time left before the start of the fiscal year. Defendants have agreed to provide the Quality Trust with the\nresidual prorated amount in 2011. The Consent Order specifies that all of the monies to be paid are to be paid in\nYear 2000 dollars. The Consent Order also provides for access rights to facilities, persons, documents, and other\nmaterials for the Quality Trust.\nIn exchange for defendants' endowment and annual funding of the Quality Trust, plaintiffs and the United States\nhave agreed to waive all claims for past contumacious conduct of defendants as of the date of the entry of the\nConsent Order and approval of the Settlement Agreement. There are important exceptions to this waiver. For\nexample, no matter what the time frame, plaintiffs and the United States have reserved the right to seek claims\non class members' behalf related to: the safeguarding and/or management of the benefits, personal possessions,\nwages, bank accounts, and/or funds of class members; the failure to provide adequate legal representation and\nlay advocacy services to class members; and claims for damages based on other possible causes of action\nindependent of the Court's Orders. To that end, defendants have agreed to push back the statutory limitation\nperiods, thus enabling class members to bring suits for prior claims as of January 15, 1998. Plaintiffs and the\nUnited States retain the right to seek monetary or non-monetary contempt sanctions for defendants' acts after the\ndate of the entry of the Consent Order.\nSettlement Agreement. In addition to the Consent Order, the parties have negotiated a separate Settlement\nAgreement (Exhibit A to the Consent Order). This was necessary for a number of reasons. First, a designated\nmember of the Quality Trust is to sign the Settlement Agreement, so that the Quality Trust will be bound by its\nterms. Second, the Quality Trust is to exist beyond the life of this class action. Once compliance with the existing\nOrders is achieved and the case is dismissed, there will be a surviving document that will enable interested\nparties to hold the Quality Trust accountable for advancing the interests of individuals with mental retardation and\ndevelopmental disabilities.\nThe Settlement Agreement sets forth in detail the structure of the Quality Trust, the control and use of the funds\nto be provided by defendants, the obligations of the Quality Trust, and the Trust's access rights.\n\nApproval of the Consent Order and the Settlement Agreement\nThe complaint in this case was filed on February 23, 1976, and it was assigned to Judge John H. Pratt. Judge\nPratt granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification on June 3, 1976. On June 16, 1978, Judge Pratt issued a\nFinal Judgment and Order, which unfortunately proved to be about as final as peace in the Balkans. Judge Pratt,\nlong an exceptional jurist as a member of this court, died in 1995, and the case was reassigned to the\n85 undersigned on August *85 29 of that year. Margaret G. Farrell was appointed as Special Master on October 1,\n1995; Clarence J. Sundram (who had contributed significantly to this case as a consultant) was appointed as co-\nSpecial Master on February 20, 2001.\nThe dispute seemed intractable until last year, towards the end of which there were commendable and extensive\nefforts by Mrs. Farrell, Mr. Sundram, and counsel for the parties seeking to resolve the problems faced by all.\nThose efforts led to the documents now before the Court. The first to have been filed was the Parties' Joint\nStipulated Findings of Fact (December 22, 2000), which the Court hereby adopts. After the submission of the\n2001 Plan for Compliance and Conclusion of Evans v. Williams (February 2, 2001), the Consent Order, of which\nExhibit A thereto was the Settlement Agreement, was tendered. The Consent Order was approved conditionally\nby the undersigned on March 4, 2001, with what has been characterized as a fairness hearing having been\nscheduled for March 5. Prior to that hearing, proper notice duly having been given, plaintiffs' counsel met\nextensively with class members (and, where applicable, members of their families) and defendants' counsel met\nwith providers of services to the class members. A hearing was held on March 5. The status of the case then was\ndealt with fully by the co-Special Masters and by counsel for all parties, and testimony was received from several\nclass members and the president of The Arc of the District of Columbia. No opposition of any sort has been\nexpressed to the very carefully designed proposals for the resolution of this case.\nUnder Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a compromise of a class action may not be effectuated\nwithout approval of the court. This case is unusual, in that a \"final judgment\" in plaintiffs' favor was entered more\nthan 20 years ago; the problem has lain in actually meeting the needs of the members of the plaintiff class. The\nCourt commends the co-Special Masters and all counsel not only for resolving their differences, but for the\nexceptionally thorough manner in which they have agreed upon procedures for dealing with the problems that\nhave persisted for so long. The Court readily concludes that the proposed compromise of the controversy, which\nwill be of substantially greater benefit to the class than would continued litigation over how to deal with past\nconduct by defendants, is fair, reasonable, and adequate.\nAccordingly, on consideration of all of the foregoing factors, it hereby is\nORDERED, that the Parties' Joint Stipulated Findings of Fact are adopted. It hereby further is\nORDERED, that the 2001 Plan for Compliance and Conclusion of Evans v. Williams is approved as, in effect, a\nstatement of the conditions for the expected vacating of the Court's relevant prior Orders. It hereby further is\nORDERED, that the Consent Order formally is entered and the Settlement Agreement attached thereto is\napproved.\nSO ORDERED.\nCONSENT ORDER\nI. Background\nOn February 10, 1999, this Court imposed contempt fines of $5,096,340.00 for Defendants' failure to comply with\ncertain Court Orders in this case. Evans v. Williams, 35 F.Supp.2d 88 (D.D.C.1999). On March 31, 2000, the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed and remanded this matter for further\n86 proceedings. Evans v. Williams, 206 F.3d 1292 (D.C.Cir.2000). The Court of Appeals determined that the *86\n\ncontempt fines were criminal in nature and could not be imposed in the absence of appropriate procedural\nsafeguards. Id. at 1297 n. 4.\nIn order to address the issues still before the Court on remand, the parties have agreed to the following Consent\nOrder. In this Consent Order, the Defendants and/or the District of Columbia agree to endow and annually fund,\npursuant to the provisions below, a durable, independent, nonprofit organization that will monitor and advance the\nindividual and collective interests of people with developmental disabilities in the District of Columbia's service\ndelivery system, including Evans class members, in exchange for the waiver of any and all claims for past\nviolations of the Court's Orders in this case as specified in section II of this Consent Order. The specifics of the\nparties' agreement are set forth below.\nII. Resolution of Past Non-Compliance with the Court Orders\nThe parties have agreed to this Consent Order which resolves all issues related to Defendants' past non-\ncompliance with the Orders in this case, including those related to the Court's February 10, 1999 finding of\ncontempt and the imposition of fines, subject to the following:\nA. Except as otherwise stated in this section, the Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff-Intervenor agree to\nwaive any and all claims for past violations of the Court's Orders in this case based on\nDefendants' past non-compliance with the existing Court Orders in this case during the period up\nto and including the date of the Court's entry of this Consent Order. The parties agree that this\nConsent Order does not affect the previously negotiated Settlement Agreement, dated September\n22, 2000, as to the Symbral Foundation and the class members receiving services therefrom. In\naddition, Plaintiffs do not waive the claim for costs and reimbursement for the care of class\nmember Beverly Sutton. Plaintiffs do not waive claims regarding University Legal Services, Inc.,\nProtection and Advocacy Program's costs, expenses and attorneys' fees in this case that may\nhave arisen prior to the date of this Order, subject to any available defenses or objections raised\nby the Defendants.\nB. The Plaintiffs and Plaintiff-Intervenor agree to waive any claim for damages based on\nDefendants' past non-compliance with the existing Court Orders in this case during the period up\nto and including the date of the Court's entry of this Consent Order. However, the Plaintiffs and the\nPlaintiff-Intervenor specifically do not waive any claim they may have for damages or equitable\nrelief due to Defendants' conduct prior the date of the Court's entry of this Consent Order, with\nregard to the following categories of claims only:\n1. safeguarding and/or management of the benefits, personal possessions, wages, bank accounts\nand/or funds of class members;\n2. the failure of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia to provide legal representation and\nlay advocacy services as required by the Orders of this Court in this case and by statute (see Title\n6 D.C.Code Section 1901 et seq.); and\n3. claims by class members for damages or other relief based on causes of action independent of\nthe Court Orders in this case. In relation to such claims only, Defendants have agreed to waive the\nrequirements of Title 12 D.C.Code Section 309 for class members who first suffered damages on\n87 or after January 15, 1998, through the date this Order is *87 entered by the Court, except\nDefendants expressly do not waive the requirements of Title 12 D.C.Code Section 309 for claims\nbrought under wrongful death or survival statutes.\nC. Nothing in this Consent Order shall be construed to prevent the Plaintiffs or Plaintiff-Intervenor\nfrom seeking equitable relief to remediate current violations (that exist as of the date of the Court's\nentry of this Consent Order) or new violations of this Court's Orders. Evidence of Defendants'\nconduct prior to the date this Order is entered by the Court shall be admissible in such\nproceedings, subject to any available defenses or objections raised by Defendants.\n\nD. Nothing in this Consent Order modifies the current Court-ordered fine schedule and process\nwith respect to findings of contempt based on violations of this Court's Orders which may occur\nafter the Court's entry of this Order.\nE. The Quality Trust shall not provide direct legal representation to class members with regard to\nany claims based on violations of the Court Orders in this case which occurred prior to the date\nthis Order is entered by the Court.\nIII. Creation and Funding of the Quality Trust\nA. The parties agree to the creation of an independent, nonprofit organization to be named the\nQuality Trust for Individuals with Disabilities, Inc., (hereinafter \"Quality Trust\" or \"QT\").\nB. Within 15 days of the Court's entry of this Consent Order, the Quality Trust shall be\nincorporated as a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) corporation under the District of Columbia Nonprofit\nCorporation Act, approved August 6, 1962 (76 Stat. 265; D.C.Code Section 29-501 et seq.). The\nQuality Trust is to be incorporated as an independent entity to insulate it from control by the\nparties.\nC. The mission and purpose of the Quality Trust is set forth in a Settlement Agreement (attached\nas Exhibit A) which is to be signed by the parties and a designated representative of the Quality\n[1]\nTrust, who is legally competent to bind the Quality Trust, and filed with this Court.  The\nSettlement Agreement specifies that the Quality Trust will provide, inter alia, monitoring, legal\n[2]\nservices and lay advocacy services for individuals with developmental disabilities  in the District\n88 of Columbia's *88 service delivery system.\nD. Within 30 days of the filing of the Settlement Agreement signed by the Quality Trust, the\nDefendants and/or the District of Columbia agree to pay the sum of eleven million dollars for\ndeposit into an interest bearing fund for the exclusive use of the Quality Trust.\nE.

The Defendants and/or the District of Columbia shall provide annual operating funding to the\nQuality Trust on or before October 1 of each Fiscal Year for which the funds are intended (Fiscal\nYears 2001 to 2011), or as soon thereafter as the budget process will allow.\n\nI. Nothing in this Consent Order is intended to preclude any party or the Board of Directors of the\nQuality Trust from advocating for funds to increase those available to the Quality Trust above two\nmillion dollars in Year 2000 dollars in any given year.\nIV. Quality Trust's Right to Access and Information\nA. The employees, contractors and consultants retained by the Quality Trust shall have full access\nto information that the Quality Trust deems reasonably necessary and appropriate in performing\nthe monitoring and lay advocacy duties described in the Settlement Agreement. More specifically,\n89 the employees, contractors and consultants retained by the Quality Trust *89 shall have full\naccess to consumers, and their residences, facilities, buildings, programs, services, documents,\nrecords (including medical and departmental) and other materials that the Quality Trust deems\nreasonably necessary and appropriate in performing the duties of the Quality Trust's monitoring\nand lay advocacy functions.

The United States does not waive its right to pursue any other claims against the Defendants or\nthe District of Columbia with regard to disputes or claims that involve incidents or events that\noccurred during any period arising under laws, statutes and regulations other than the existing\nCourt Orders in this case.\nWHEREFORE, the parties to this action, having agreed to the provisions in the Consent Order set forth above,\nand the Court being advised in the premises, this Court hereby GRANTS CONDITIONAL APPROVAL of this\nConsent Order pending final approval after a fairness hearing pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure.\nWHEREFORE, the parties to this action, having agreed to the provisions in the Consent Order set forth above,\nand the Court being advised in the premises and having concluded that this Consent Order is a fair resolution of\nthese matters after a fairness hearing held on March 5, 2001, this Consent Order is hereby entered as the\nORDER and JUDGMENT of this Court.\nEXHIBIT A\nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\nPursuant to the attached Consent Order, the parties and the Quality Trust for Individuals with Disabilities, Inc.,\n(hereinafter the \"Quality Trust\" or \"QT\"), hereby agree to the following:\nI. Structure of the Quality Trust\nA. The bylaws of the Quality Trust shall provide that the Quality Trust will have an independent\nBoard of Directors and a body of non-voting members. The Mayor shall appoint the initial board\nfrom a list of nominees jointly developed by Defendants, Plaintiffs and Plaintiff-Intervenor. Each\nnominee on the list of proposed board members shall be agreed to by all parties. The Board shall\nthereafter be self-perpetuating. Specifically:\n1. The composition and responsibilities of the Board will be established by the organization's\nbylaws and will include the following:\na. Each director shall be a natural person of adult age. A director need not be a citizen of the\nUnited States. At least eight members of the Board must be residents of the District of Columbia.\nb. The initial Board of Directors shall consist of the directors named in the Quality Trust's Articles\nof Incorporation and shall hold office until their successors have been duly appointed and\nqualified.\nc. At all times following the appointment of the first full thirteen member Board of Directors, the full\nBoard of Directors shall consist of thirteen adult persons designated as follows:\n91 i. Two family members of people with mental retardation and/or developmental *91 disabilities.\nThe initial terms of family members shall be two years, and all subsequent terms shall be three\nyears;\nii.

Following the initial term of each Board Member, the remaining Board Members, whose terms\nare not ending, will vote to replace the departing Board Member. A majority vote of those\nremaining Board Members is required to fill a vacancy. Further, the Board Member must replace a\ndeparting Board Member with an adult person who fits the designated category (e.g., family\nmember, non-legal advocate, person with mental retardation and/or other developmental disability\nprofessional with ten years experience, attorney, citizen residing in the District of Columbia) of the\ndeparting Board Member. A Board Member may succeed himself or herself. A Board Member may\nresign prior to the expiration of the full term. If a Board Member resigns prior to the expiration of\nthe full term, the other Board Members shall replace that Board Member for the remainder of the\nunexpired term through the voting process outlined in this section. Votes regarding the\nappointment, removal, or replacement of a member of the Board of Directors may not be\ndelegated to a committee of the Board.\n2. The Quality Trust will be a member organization with non-voting members. The non-voting\nmembers shall be individuals with mental retardation, as well as people with other developmental\ndisabilities, who are applicants for or are receiving protections, supports and services in the\nDistrict of Columbia's developmental disabilities service delivery system, and all Evans class\nmembers.\nB. The Quality Trust's scope of activities shall include review of services to all Evans class\nmembers, as well as non-class members who are applicants for or are receiving protections,\nsupports and services in the District of Columbia's developmental disabilities service delivery\n[1]\nsystem.  Pursuant to the attached Consent Order and this Settlement Agreement, the Quality\n92 Trust will monitor the protections, services *92 and supports provided to these individuals and\noffer legal services and provide lay advocacy services to these \"consumers.\" The term\n\"consumers\" refers to all recipients and applicants for services from the District of Columbia's\nservice delivery system for individuals with mental retardation and developmental disabilities. The \nEvans class members (i.e., those individuals who have at one time resided at Forest Haven)\ncomprise a subset of this overall group of consumers.\nII. Control and Use of the Quality Trust Fund\nA. The investment fund, created with the eleven million dollars paid by the Defendants and/or\nDistrict of Columbia pursuant to the attached Consent Order, shall be controlled by the Quality\nTrust. The Quality Trust shall invest the fund in a reasonable and prudent manner. The Quality\nTrust shall make reasonable efforts to increase its assets, raise funds and/or find additional\nresources in order to increase the principal and income of the fund.\nB. From the outset, the earnings from the fund shall be reinvested to increase the principal. The\nearnings of this fund shall not be used to support the operations of the Quality Trust until October\n1, 2006. The Quality Trust shall not use the principal to carry out its functions and operations prior\n\nto October 1, 2011. After October 1, 2011, the Quality Trust, by a vote of three-quarters of its\nBoard Members, may utilize a reasonable portion of the principal to support its mission.\nC. Nothing in this Settlement Agreement shall preclude the Quality Trust, in accordance with\napplicable law, from creating a separate corporate entity, consistent with the Quality Trust's\nmission, to achieve the Quality Trust's operational goals.\nIII. Obligations of the Quality Trust\nIn general, the Quality Trust shall: advance the individual and collective interests of consumers with\ndevelopmental disabilities, and in particular Evans class members; monitor the health, safety and welfare of\nthese consumers; and monitor the protections, services and supports provided to these consumers. The Quality\nTrust also shall provide for individual and/or collective legal services and lay advocacy services for consumers as\nset forth in greater detail below. The Board of Directors shall periodically determine how to apportion its\nresources among monitoring, legal representation services and lay advocacy or other strategies, consistent with\nthe Quality Trust's mission and functions, to advance the individual and/or collective interests of consumers with\ndevelopmental disabilities, and in particular Evans class members. This process shall be informed by the\nDefendants' and/or the District of Columbia's level of compliance with the Evans 2001 Plan.\nA. Monitoring\nThe Quality Trust shall create a Monitoring Unit which shall:\n1. Develop an annual monitoring plan with input from the parties, consumers, families, providers\nand advocates.\n2. Monitor the adequacy, safety and quality of consumers' residential and habilitation programs\nand supports.\n3. Receive and review with regard to consumers from the District's Mental Retardation and\nDevelopmental Disabilities Administration (\"MRDDA\") or its successor, all of MRDDA's serious\n93 incident reports and investigation reports of *93 serious incidents, including deaths, and aggregate\ninformation regarding all incidents.\n4. Write annual reports, and, in addition, such other periodic reports as the Quality Trust may\ndetermine to be necessary. Such reports are to be made public and provided to: (A) the Special\nMaster and the parties' counsel of record (until this case is no longer subject to Court supervision);\n(B) the Defendants and/or the branches of the District of Columbia, including the Departments of\nHuman Services and Health (or their successors), the Chief Financial Officer and the Mayor; and\n(C) the District of Columbia Council. The reports shall make observations with regard to the\nadequacy of the protections, services, and supports provided to consumers and offer\nrecommendations for any needed improvements. The Defendants and/or the District of Columbia\nshall respond promptly to these reports in writing, including specific corrective action steps they\nwill implement or have implemented, along with timelines if the actions have not been\nimplemented, to address current problems.\n5. Receive and review information with regard to the District of Columbia budget requests for\nMRDDA or its successor sufficient to permit its timely monitoring and comment about District of\nColumbia budget decisions affecting consumers.\n6. Annually inform the Defendants and/or the District of Columbia of the consumer needs, based\non information collected during monitoring activities, in a timely manner, to permit such information\nto be considered in developing the District of Columbia's proposed budget for the service delivery\nsystem for individuals with developmental disabilities for the following Fiscal Year.\n\n7. Apply at least the following standards in its monitoring and reviews: (A) the specific outcome\ncriteria developed as part of the Evans 2001 Plan; (B) certification and private accreditation\nstandards; (C) the District of Columbia's own standards including licensing requirements; (D)\nMedicaid and Medicare regulations and conditions of participation; and (E) the District of\nColumbia's performance standards in private provider contracts.\n8. Be physically co-located with the Evans Independent Court Monitor so as to enhance\ncommunication regarding monitoring activities in order to avoid redundancy, until the Evans case\nis no longer subject to regular Court supervision. The Independent Court Monitor shall remain\ndirectly responsible to the Court, and not to the Quality Trust. As each Evans Order is vacated by\nthe Court, monitoring of corresponding operations shall be transferred from the Independent Court\nMonitor to the Quality Trust, and shall no longer be subject to Court supervision.\nB. Legal Services\n1. The Quality Trust shall work to raise the level of advocacy among court-appointed attorneys by,\nfor example, providing training, drafting model pleadings and developing in-house appellate\nadvocacy capacity. The Quality Trust's legal representatives will supplement (not replace) the\nexisting pool of attorneys appointed by Superior Court and will seek to be appointed in cases of\nconsumers who have heretofore been deprived competent representation.\n2. The Quality Trust shall contract with or otherwise arrange for legal representation services for\nconsumers. The scope and content of the contract shall be negotiated by the Quality Trust and the\nprovider. The Quality Trust will oversee the performance of the provider under this contract to\n94 ensure that the *94 consumers are getting the legal representation services they require.\n3. The Quality Trust shall not provide direct legal representation to any individual but may contract\nor make other arrangements for direct representation from other independent legal services\nproviders. Nothing herein shall preclude lay advocates from assisting consumers in administrative\nproceedings.\nC. Lay Advocacy Services\nBecause some of the advocacy needs of the consumers do not require the services of an attorney and can be\nprovided more effectively and less expensively through the availability of lay advocates, the Quality Trust will\ncreate a Lay Advocacy Program which shall provide the following services:\n1. Attend Individual Support Plan (\"ISP\") and other team meetings for consumers for whom they\nare responsible and advocate for the needs and choices of the consumers at these meetings. The\nadvocates will attempt at all times to facilitate the consumers' self-expression, or in the alternative,\nwill consult with duly appointed representatives or surrogate decision-makers, where appropriate.\n2. Regularly interact with the case managers of the consumers on their caseloads to keep abreast\nof any issues impacting on the protections, services and supports provided to consumers.\n3. Receive and review serious incident reports and investigation reports for consumers for whom\nthey are responsible, and advocate for the consumers' safety and well-being in the course of such\ninvestigations.\n4. Receive and review all monitoring reports related to the consumers on their caseloads and\nfollow up to ensure that necessary corrective action is taken.\n5. Periodically visit consumers receiving residential and day treatment services to ensure that\nconsumers are safe and satisfied with the services and supports they are receiving and that the\nservices and supports are adequate to meet the individualized needs of the consumers.\n\n6. Advocate on behalf of individuals and/or groups of consumers to ensure that their complaints\nare investigated in a timely fashion and that the consumers are satisfied with the resolution. In the\nevent that the time frames required for resolution are not complied with or that the proposed\nresolution is otherwise unsatisfactory, the advocate shall consult with the consumer(s), or other\nappropriate decision-maker, to determine the appropriate course of action.\na. The Lay Advocacy Program and the Legal Services component shall establish a program to\nfacilitate the immediate referral and coordination of cases requiring the assistance of an attorney.\nb. Consumers may seek immediate referral to the Legal Services component from the Lay\nAdvocacy Program.\n7. Attend court hearings for the consumers on their caseloads and work with the assigned\nattorneys in ensuring that consumers' needs for protections, services and supports are met.\n8. Some consumers will have family members, guardians or friends who will serve as their\nadvocates while others will rely on the services of paid lay advocates. The advocacy program will\nprovide training not only to the lay advocates, but also to such volunteer advocates.\n9. This advocacy unit will supplement (not replace) the existing pool of advocates acting on behalf\n95 of family, friends, or those appointed by Superior Court or *95 appointed pursuant to existing\nOrders in this case. The Lay Advocacy Program will prioritize cases of consumers who heretofore\nhave not received advocacy services.\nIV. Quality Trust's Right to Access and Information\nA. The employees, contractors and consultants retained by the Quality Trust shall have full access\nto information that the Quality Trust deems reasonably necessary and appropriate in performing\nthe monitoring and lay advocacy duties described in the Settlement Agreement. More specifically,\nthe employees, contractors and consultants retained by the Quality Trust shall have full access to\nconsumers, and their residences, facilities, buildings, programs, services, documents, records\n(including medical and departmental) and other materials that the Quality Trust deems reasonably\nnecessary and appropriate in performing the duties of the Quality Trust's monitoring and lay\nadvocacy functions. The Quality Trust may obtain copies of the aforementioned documents,\nrecords, and other materials. The Defendants and/or the District of Columbia shall provide the\nQuality Trust with information upon request relevant to individual supports and services provided\nin the District of Columbia's service delivery system and the Quality Trust may request written\nresponses from the Defendants and/or the District of Columbia in this regard. Advance notice of\nany visit or inspection by the Quality Trust shall not be required. Representatives of the Quality\nTrust may conduct private interviews and meetings with any individual including employees,\ncontractors or agents of the District of Columbia, as well as all provider staff. The Defendants and/\nor the District of Columbia shall require its employees, contractors, agents, as well as provider\nstaff, to cooperate with the Quality Trust representatives.\nB. Attorneys who provide direct legal representation of consumers under a contract or other\narrangements with the Quality Trust shall have the right to access their clients' records and any\nand all information regarding their clients that flow from their attorney-client relationship. In\nlitigation involving the Defendants and/or the District of Columbia, attorneys shall comply with the\napplicable rules of discovery and procedure.\nC. The Quality Trust shall safeguard the information obtained pursuant to paragraph IV.A., as\nrequired by all applicable laws and Court Orders protecting the confidentiality of such information.\nD. The Defendants and/or the District of Columbia shall keep the Quality Trust informed in a timely\nfashion of relevant budgetary information regarding MRDDA or its successor. The areas about\n\nwhich the Defendants and/or the District of Columbia shall provide information to the Quality Trust\ninclude the following:\n1. The portions of the budget that address specific consumer needs for residential and day\nprogram services, equipment, medical and clinical care, etc.;\n2. The portions of the budget that address system needs for managing, monitoring, and\noverseeing the system of services for consumers;\n96 3. The portions of the budget that address any capital appropriations that *96 may be required to\nmeet the needs of the consumers (e.g., for construction or renovation of program sites or\nresidences);\n4. The amount of the appropriation being requested by the Mayor from the City Council to meet\nconsumer needs;\n5. The final appropriation; and\n6. The District of Columbia Department of Health's proposed and actual budgets which include the\nDistrict of Columbia's share of payments to Medicaid providers.\nV. Legislative Principles\nThe Plaintiffs and the Defendants agree that if the appropriate legislative body does not enact legislation to\nimplement the Legislative Principles (attached to the Evans 2001 Plan), before the end of the 2001 legislative\nsession, the parties will accomplish the objectives of the Principles through alternative means. The United States\ndoes not take a position with regard to such proposed and/or pending legislation or to the Legislative Principles\nattached to the Plan.\nVI. Judicial Review\nUntil the Evans case is dismissed, this Court shall retain jurisdiction to enforce the Settlement Agreement as to\nclass members only, with remedies available to the parties to the Settlement Agreement under applicable\ncontract law. Upon dismissal of this action, the Settlement Agreement shall be enforceable as a contract in the\nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia.\nPARTIES' JOINT STIPULATED FINDINGS OF FACT\nDec. 22, 2000\nI. Introduction\nOn February 10, 1999, this Court ordered the Special Master to develop findings of fact with regard to the status\nof Defendants' compliance with Court Orders in this case. In order to assist the Special Master to comply with this\nOrder, the parties, in order to resolve their differences, avoid costly and unnecessary litigation, and continue their\ncollaborative relationship, have agreed on the following stipulated findings of fact. The stipulations apply to the\ntime period up to and including the date of the statement or report that is the source of the information.\nII. Stipulations\n\nGENERAL FINDINGS\n1. Issues related to the District of Columbia's system of support for individuals with developmental disabilities\n(hereinafter \"District's system\") represent one of the most serious breakdowns in the District government over the\nlast two decades. The measure of a society is how it treats its most vulnerable citizens. In this case, the District\ngovernment failed. Prepared Statement of Anthony A. Williams, Mayor of the District of Columbia (hereinafter\n\"Mayor's Prep. Stmnt.\"), June 1, 2000 at 1 (Master's Exh. J, June 30, 2000).\n2. Mistakes in the District's system of support for individuals with developmental disabilities cover 20 years of\nneglect and mismanagement. Mayor's Prep. Stmnt. at 1.\n3. The District government is seriously broken from years of disinvestment, mismanagement, poor oversight and\nneglect. Mayor's Prep. Stmnt. at 1.\n4. The breakdown in services to clients with developmental disabilities in the District's system had been 19 years\nin the making. Mayor's Prep. Stmnt. at 1.\n5. The Mayor and his administration were aware of problems in the District's Mental Retardation and\n97 Developmental Disabilities Administration (\"MRDDA\") but were not aware that some of the systemic *97\nproblems could lead to threats to the life and safety of some of the most vulnerable citizens in the District's\nsystem. Mayor's Prep. Stmnt. at 2.\n6. In spite of some progress in fixing the District's system of support for individuals with developmental disabilities\nin recent months, much remains to be done. Mayor's Prep. Stmnt. at 2.\n7. Two decades of neglect in the District's system has taken a toll on the clients served in the system. Mayor's\nPrep. Stmnt. at 3.\n8. The District government has fundamentally failed its obligation to disabled persons and their families. Painful\nexperience has taught that the District's MRDDA system is not a system. Mayor's Prep. Stmnt. at 3.\n9. The District's system of support for individuals with developmental disabilities must do a better job assessing\nrisks and being proactive. Mayor's Prep. Stmnt. at 4.\n10. The District's support system is a problem that urgently needs to be fixed. Mayor's Prep. Stmnt. at 4.\n11. The District government inherited by Mayor Williams was almost completely decimated as a result of years of\ndisinvestment, mismanagement, and poor performance. Prepared Statement of Carolyn N. Graham, Deputy\nMayor of the District of Columbia (hereinafter \"Deputy Mayor's Prep. Stmnt.\"), May 22, 2000 at 1 (Master's Exh.\nK).\n12. Problems existed in MRDDA under the present administration. Deputy Mayor's Prep. Stmnt. at 2.\n13. The District was aware of problems of poor care provided at group homes, systemic failures and other issues\nas a result of a Washington Post article in February 1999. Deputy Mayor's Prep. Stmnt. at 3.\n14. MRDDA needed legal representation in guardianship hearings that involve citizens with developmental\ndisabilities. Deputy Mayor's Prep. Stmnt. at 4.\n15. MRDDA has had trouble getting provider contracts processed in a timely manner. Deputy Mayor's Prep.\nStmnt. at 5.\n16. The problems in the District's support system for individuals with developmental disabilities were even more\negregious than originally and subsequently described. Deputy Mayor's Prep. Stmnt. at 6.\n17. The Mayor issued a report that acknowledged that the District's entire mental retardation and developmental\ndisabilities system was fundamentally unable to deliver even the most basic services. It is definitive that the\n\ncurrent system failed because of a poor design and years of neglect and disinvestment. The District's system\nintended to address the needs of those with developmental disabilities suffers from fundamental problems.\nExamples of such fundamental problems in the District's system include; there are no clearly defined quality\nservice standards; there is no quality improvement process; there are no significant penalties for lack of\ncompliance with existing system's requirements; there is fragmentation and poor coordination in government\nbusiness processes; there is no investment in technology to augment business processes internal and external to\ngovernment; there is a poorly trained workforce both in and outside of government; there is a highly inconsistent,\nunderpaid workforce external to government; and there are limited supported employment opportunities. Well\nover sixty percent of the population in the District's community residential facilities (\"CRF's\") could benefit from\nsuch opportunities. The District's system favors high cost institutional-based care as opposed to a system that\n98 supports and encourages *98 independence and inclusion. Deputy Mayor's Prep. Stmnt. at 7-9.\n18. The District's support system requires a major overhaul that will not happen overnight. Deputy Mayor's Prep.\nStmnt. at 10. While there have been some recent accomplishments, far more remains to be done. Deputy\nMayor's Prep. Stmnt. at 14.\n19. Painful experience has taught that the District government currently lacks the capacity to adequately deliver\nthe services that the individuals with developmental disabilities in the District's system require. Deputy Mayor's\nPrep. Stmnt. at 17.\n20. The entire mental retardation and developmental disabilities service delivery system is incapable of providing\nquality service. Preliminary Findings on the Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Service Delivery\nSystem, Government of the District of Columbia, Office of the Deputy Mayor for Children and Families, Jan. 18,\n2000 (hereinafter \"D.C. Prelim. Rep.\") at 1 (emphasis in original).\n21. The District's mental retardation and developmental disabilities service delivery system is broken. D.C.\nPrelim. Rep. at 5, 39.\n22. The District's system is highly dysfunctional and unable to execute its mission at its most basic level through\nits current structure and procedures. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 2.\n23. After the closure of Forest Haven, compliance with the Evans v. Williams Court-Ordered mandates began to\ndeteriorate. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 11 (fn.5). Many of the requirements of the Evans Court Orders are not being\ncomplied with. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 14. While Court Orders in the Evans case apply only to a portion of the\ncustomers served by MRDDA, there is no programmatic or clinical reason to differentiate between class\nmembers and other customers. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 17.\n24. The District is mired in a philosophy of service delivery that is reminiscent of approaches that are more than\n20 years old and that consequently, neither MRDDA's mission statement nor its operation reflects the most\ncurrent philosophy demonstrated nationally in best practice models. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 22.\n25. The entire District service delivery system must be redefined and rebuilt. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 2.\n26. The need for reform in the District's system ranges from the broadest to the smallest of issues and simply\n\"tinkering around the edges\" will not solve the systemic problems in the system. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 11.\n27. Fixing the District's system requires a combination of short and long-term initiatives that are integrated and\ncoordinated. Previous attempts to analyze and fix problems have been too narrow in scope and did not take into\naccount the overall impact of piecemeal solutions. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 5, 39.\n28. MRDDA does not and cannot meet its stated mission which is to serve individuals with mental retardation and\nother developmental disabilities. Defendants' staffing pattern and approach has been and still is designed to\nserve only people with mental retardation. MRDDA is not adequately meeting the needs of people with mental\nretardation and is not capable of effectively meeting the aspect of its mission to serve people with developmental\ndisabilities other than mental retardation. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 21.\n29. Upon further review of the system, Defendants re-confirmed their earlier conclusion that communication and\n99 coordination between departments and even agencies within departments is inadequate. *99 Addendum to\n\nPreliminary Findings on the Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Service Delivery System,\nGovernment of the District of Columbia, Office of the Deputy Mayor for Children and Families, Mar. 2, 2000\n(hereinafter \"D.C. Addendum Rep.\") at 3.\n30. There is no single coordinated plan to ensure lifetime support to individuals with mental retardation and\ndevelopmental disabilities. D.C. Addendum Rep. at 3.\nLEAST RESTRICTIVE COMMUNITY SETTING\n31. The District relies on a facility-based model of service delivery that does not lend itself to providing community\nliving and support services that are fully integrated, customer-directed, flexible, cost efficient, and which promote\nan optimum quality of life. Final Report to the Government of the District of Columbia, Office of the City\nAdministrator, Office of the Deputy Mayor for Operations, Georgetown University Child Development Center, Jan.\n18, 2000 (hereinafter \"D.C. Georgetown Rep.\") at 2.\n32. There is a general lack of communication between MRDDA and the Office of Program Operations which\nresults in a lack of coordination in planning to ensure that the appropriate types of facilities are available for the\nplacement of MRDDA clients by MRDDA. D.C. Addendum Rep. at 9. Ultimate decision-making in person\ncentered planning rests with MRDDA even though it is \"demonstrably ill-equipped\" to carry out this function. D.C.\nGeorgetown Rep. at 15. There are no structural mechanisms within the District system for people with disabilities\nand their families to select where and with whom they live; participate in the design of services they receive;\ndetermine from whom they receive services; and participate in program evaluation including customer\nsatisfaction surveys. D.C. Georgetown Rep. at 15.\n33. The District's operating philosophy is the same as it was prior to the closing of Forest Haven resulting in\n\"mini-Forest Havens\" rather than a person-centered planning philosophy. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 2.\n34. The District's Medical Assistance Administration (\"MAA\") and MRDDA have failed to implement an effective\nMedicaid Home and Community Based Waiver. The District's commitment to self-determination embodied in\nperson centered planning cannot be met without the funding stream provided by an effective waiver. D.C. Prelim.\nRep. at 35-36.\n35. The lack of an effective home and community based waiver is in itself sufficient to keep the District from\neffectively implementing person centered planning. D.C. Addendum Rep. at 4.\n36. The District does not have a functioning home and community based waiver program. D.C. Addendum Rep.\nat 8. Defendants acknowledge that the District has \"lagged behind\" in instituting a fully functional waiver. D.C.\nAddendum Rep. at 6.\n37. The District's competitive procurement process is not suitable for the procurement of service to the MRDDA\npopulation in that awarding the contract to the lowest bidder sometimes results in awards that do not support the\ngoals of person centered planning and respect for individual self-determination. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 31.\n38. MRDDA and provider managers and supervisors may lack sensitivity to the right of persons with mental\nretardation and developmental disabilities to make choices. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 16.\n100 STAFF TRAINING\n*100\n39. Formal training programs and requirements for both District and private sector employees are nearly non-\nexistent in the mental retardation and developmental disabilities service delivery system. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 3.\n40. MRDDA employees have not been provided adequate training for the jobs that they do. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at\n17.\n41. Residential and transportation provider employees within the District's system have not been provided\nadequate training for the jobs that they do. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 17.\n\n42. There has been a lack of appropriate training of MRDDA managers and employees. There is no formal\ntraining program in place. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 18.\nPROTECTION FROM HARM/INCIDENT REPORTING/INVESTIGATIONS\n43. There is no formal policy or procedure detailing the difference between an unusual incident report and an\n\"alert,\" that MRDDA staff had different understandings of these two instruments. Defendants acknowledge that\nmore review of the \"alert\" process is necessary. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 14.\n44. There is a lack of basic policies and procedures in the District system. There was no policy to allow\nemployees to call 911 without first getting a supervisor's approval until December 1999. There was no policy to\nprovide for safe transportation of customers in existence prior to late 1999, and that it was developed only after a\ncustomer died after being left unattended in a van. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 19.\n45. Policies and procedures are often not followed in the District's system. For example, many providers do not\nprovide MRDDA with unusual incident reports within 24 hours and do not submit reports on all incidents that\nshould be reported pursuant to current MRDDA policies. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 19.\n46. MRDDA staff do not always track down the outcome of matters referred for action. Once items are referred to\nother agencies for action, little follow-up is done to determine the status of investigations. This problem is\nexacerbated by a general failure to share information among involved organizations. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 20.\n47. There is a large backlog of unusual incident reports within the Bureau of Program Operations and Contracts\n(\"BPOC\") which is to review them and forward them for appropriate action. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 24. Since at least\nNovember 1, 1999, all unusual incident reports are not sent to the Office of Inspection and Compliance (\"OIC\")\nper current policy requirements. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 25.\n48. There has been a lack of appropriate management at the District's Department of Human Services (\"DHS\")\nregarding OIC functions. From March to December 1999, more than 600 unusual incident reports were received,\nyet little action was taken to address workload issues. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 27.\n49. The District's Internal Affairs Division (\"IAD\") has a growing backlog of investigations related to alleged\nabuses within MRDDA. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 27.\n50. DHS' Policies and Procedures for Reporting Unusual Incidents are not always followed with regard to the\ntimely submission of unusual incident reports or currently with the submission of all reports to OIC. The process\nfor submitting incident reports to OIC/IAD is delayed through MRDDA. The delay in receiving notification can\nhinder an investigation since evidence may be removed or destroyed or persons involved may be moved. D.C.\nPrelim. Rep. at 28.\n101 *101 51. There is no formal communication structure between the District's Licensing and Regulation\nAdministration (\"LRA\"), OIC, and MRDDA and that this lack of communication has created gaps in monitoring\nand handling routine complaints and incident reports. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 29.\n52. There is no formal communication structure that requires providers or clients to report complaints or incidents\nto LRA. In some cases, complaints and incident reports are never reported to LRA or MRDDA. D.C. Prelim. Rep.\nat 29.\n53. OIC does not adequately coordinate with the District's Department of Health (\"DOH\"), the District's\nMetropolitan Police Department (\"MPD\"), case managers, or others involved in the incident reporting process.\nThe agencies charged with gathering, disseminating, investigating, and reporting on unusual incident reports do\nnot coordinate or communicate on a routine basis. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 29.\n54. MRDDA's unusual incident tracking system does not interface with that of LRA or OIC. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at\n29. Information systems between DOH and DHS or that systems within DOH are not standardized. D.C. Prelim.\n\nRep. at 29-30. There is no complete file of the complaints and incidents that occur in an individual facility. D.C.\nPrelim. Rep. at 30.\n55. There is no automated tracking system in place in the District's system to log the unusual incident reports and\ntrack action through disposition. It is difficult to track unusual incidents across all involved agencies. D.C. Prelim.\nRep. at 30.\n56. A lack of investigative powers within OIC and IAD hinders the investigative process. The OIC function is\nunknown to case managers and vendors who often ask for supervisory clearance before cooperating with an\ninvestigation, which delays interviews and document collection and analysis. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 30.\nSAFEGUARDING PERSONAL POSSESSIONS\n57. MRDDA lacks sufficient internal procedures and automation to accurately account for all funds allocated to\nclient accounts. Customers in the District's system are entitled to personal care allowance of approximately\n$70.00 per month. Deposits over $50.00 are to be placed in interest bearing accounts and any interest must be\ncredited to that account. After the cost of care allocation is disbursed to providers, MRDDA has no specific\nprocedures in place to ensure that allocations of funding goes directly to the cost of care and personal care.\nEvidence set forth by a June 1998 DHS audit indicate that at least $73,000.00 is owed to customers. Audits to\nidentify allocations or misuse of funds are disjointed and funds are tracked through agencies that communicate\nall information through documentary evidence that does not exist in some cases and is not updated in others.\nAutomation between agencies for audit purposes of funds is non-existent and therefore allocations of funds are\nnot able to be tracked or monitored. Budgetary and Financial Analysis of MRDDA, Final Report to Government of\nthe District of Columbia, Office of the City Administrator, Management Analysis, Inc., Jan. 13, 2000 (hereinafter\n\"D.C. MAI Budget Rep.\") at 3-6, 7.\n58. Community bank accounts are not adequately managed by MRDDA. There is no formal control, monitoring or\nreporting. MRDDA cannot identify how many such accounts exist, or who has them, how much money is in them,\nor how they are being managed. MRDDA senior staff and case managers do not have the staff to track these\naccounts down, and are aware that numerous accounts in the community exist outside the knowledge of MRDDA\ncase managers. D.C. MAI Budget Rep. at 3-9.\n102 *102 59. The District has no controls in place to monitor community bank accounts of clients. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at\n37.\n60. The District has no controls in place to monitor customer burial accounts. MRDDA has neither procedures for\nthe establishment nor the maintenance of burial accounts and similarly lacks procedures for monitoring or\nadministering any existing accounts. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 37.\n61. There is no mechanism in the District's system to effectively monitor the implementation of individual financial\nplans. Providers often fail to get approval from case managers before withdrawing funds from individual\naccounts. The District rarely insists upon receipts from providers indicating what was actually bought with the\nfunds. There are inadequate asset control mechanisms in place so that case managers and others can determine\nwhat property customers own. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 36.\n62. MRDDA does not enforce penalties or monitor providers' transactions associated with client accounts.\nMRDDA has no formal procedures for review of the providers' financial statements except upon the case\nmanagers' inspection of the providers' residence or if the provider sends MRDDA a copy of the bank statements.\nDocumentation of client accounts, balances and transactions are not systematically tracked and therefore\nMRDDA is unable to ascertain providers' compliance with Federal and District regulations or whether funds have\nbeen commingled or expended on unauthorized allocations. D.C. MAI Budget Rep. at 3-8.\n63. Individual Financial Plans (\"IFP's\") are not used to manage the disbursement of client funds in the District's\nsystem. Because the IFP's serve as general guidelines only, they have little or no relevance in monitoring actual\ncustomer expenditures. It would be \"impossible\" for a case manager to manually review all clients' IFP's to\nascertain actual expenditures given the lack of automation and lack of records. D.C. MAI Budget Rep. at 3-8.\n\n64. Clients' individual financial plans are not drafted with sufficient or meaningful detail and the monitoring of\nthese plans is inadequate in the District's system. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 36.\nQUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAMS, MONITORING AND CASE\nMANAGEMENT\n65. Not until December 21, 1999, had the District ever undertaken to conduct an operational review of the entire\nDistrict system of service delivery to persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities in an attempt\nto identify systemwide issues. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 1.\n66. The management and oversight of both District employees and private sector providers has been inadequate.\nD.C. Prelim. Rep. at 2.\n67. Communication and coordination occurs on a limited, ad hoc basis throughout the District's system. D.C.\nPrelim. Rep. at 2.\n68. In most parts of the District's system, there has been and continues to be a lack of managers with solid\nmanagement skills and recognized expertise in the mental retardation or developmental disabilities field or other\nrelated fields. The common use of acting or temporary managers causes uncertainty in the District's system and\ninhibits change within the organization, cementing in place antiquated practices. The District's system is unable to\nmove forward without permanent managers in key positions. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 3.\n69. Both District and private sector employees lack the updated position descriptions, training, and supervision\n103 that is consistent *103 with an effective service delivery system. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 3.\n70. In many cases, policy and procedure statements are not available in the District's system. In some cases,\npolicies and procedures are not circulated to employees or are so out of date, that they are useless. Informal\ncommunication of policies and procedures during \"on the job training\" has served to continue a system of bad\nhabits and poor methods. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 3-4.\n71. All policies and procedures in the District's system are in need of review and revision. Where policies and\nprocedures do not exist, they need to be created in accordance with updated philosophies, processes, and\nsystems. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 4.\n72. One of the most striking findings of the Defendants' own operational review of the District's system was the\ncomplete lack of communication and coordination within the mental retardation and developmental disabilities\nservice delivery system. Each organization within the system operates in nearly complete isolation from the other\norganizations. This has resulted in total dysfunction of the service system and the complete lack of leadership\nsystemwide. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 4.\n73. Automation is lacking throughout the District's service delivery system. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 4.\n74. In addition to failures at MRDDA, a multitude of governmental agencies and various levels of governmental\noversight all contribute to the District's broken service delivery system. Bureaucratic processes hinder cross-\nagency collaboration. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 10.\n75. DHS has failed to take appropriate actions regarding the provision of services to persons with mental\nretardation and developmental disabilities. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 14.\n76. Top level DHS management responses to issues concerning service provision and quality of care of its\nMRDDA customers has been both reactive and inadequate. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 14-5. Appropriate DHS\nleadership has been severely lacking in the District's system. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 15.\n77. There has been a dearth of persons with solid managerial skills in key positions at MRDDA for a number of\nyears which has produced general dysfunction within the entire system. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 15.\n\n78. MRDDA has not had an Administrator with an appropriate technical background in either mental retardation or\ndevelopmental disabilities for approximately six years. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 3, 15.\n79. Neither the Bureau of Case Management (\"BCM\") nor the BPOC has a permanent Bureau Chief. D.C. Prelim.\nRep. at 15.\n80. In some cases, persons holding management positions regarding the intake and case management functions\nhave not ensured the existence of appropriate procedures or the adherence to existing procedures in the\nDistrict's system. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 16.\n81. Position descriptions for managers in the District's system are outdated and do not appropriately reflect either\nthe correct tasks or newer philosophies regarding persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities.\nD.C. Prelim. Rep. at 16.\n82. A significant number of MRDDA employees do not have position descriptions suitable for the jobs they\nperform. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 16.\n83. MRDDA employees have not had adequate supervision. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 16. Comments in favorable\n104 performance *104 ratings are often inconsistent with such ratings. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 16-7.\n84. There are insufficient numbers of employees to do the work required in the District's system. Monitoring staff\nis inadequate; there are no staff trained or qualified to create or review draft legislation, procedures or policies;\nthere are no staff specifically charged with tracking compliance with the multiple Court Orders; and there are only\ntwo employees charged with making court appearances that occur almost every day. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 17.\n85. There are insufficient numbers of employees in the District's system to do the work required. As an example,\na Court Order in the Evans case requires a ratio of case managers of no more than 1:60 for Evans class\nmembers. The District has determined that a more appropriate ratio is 1:30 and is attempting to achieve this ratio\nfor all customers. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 17. Case management position descriptions should be modified to reflect\nthe best and current practices in the coordination of services. D.C. Georgetown Rep. at 4.\n86. There are inadequate methods for background checks on providers and the employees of providers in the\nDistrict's system. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 18.\n87. MRDDA neither has the statutory nor administrative authority to require the interagency coordination and\ncollaboration necessary across District governmental agencies. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 19.\n88. Case managers do not visit all customers on their caseloads at least once per quarter per MRDDA policy.\nD.C. Prelim. Rep. at 19.\n89. There is no document management policy within MRDDA in spite of the fact that all District agencies are to\nhave one. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 19.\n90. There is a lack of adequate communication within sections of MRDDA, as well as with other District\norganizations. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 19-20.\n91. There is almost no automation used for the intake and case management functions in the District's system.\nMRDDA as a whole lacks e-mail. Most processes are paper driven. Case managers record their notes by hand.\nUnusual incident reports are done by hand. A contractor has been hired to develop databases which should allow\nMRDDA to track such information as demographics of its customer base, the residence of each customer, the\nstatus of Individual Habilitation Plans (\"IHP's\"), incidents involving customers and providers. In addition, this lack\nof automation contributes to MRDDA failing to comply with Court Orders. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 20.\n92. The District's MRDDA Monitoring Unit had been dismantled for years, and although it has recently been\nreestablished, no written policies exist for this unit. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 23.\n93. Two positions that directly affect the administration of LRA (the Director and the Director for State Affairs) are\nnot permanently filled. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 26.\n\n94. District monitoring functions are understaffed. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 27.\n95. LRA only provides monitoring at the minimum level required by the United States Health Care Financing\nAdministration (\"HCFA\"). This level of monitoring does not support the mission statement of the District's DOH\nwhich seeks to assure safe and healthy environments through licensing and regulation, reducing or preventing\nthe risk of disease, dysfunction and premature death. LRA does not perform enough monitoring of facilities to\ncarry out this mission. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 28.\n105 *105 96. There is no coordination between the MRDDA monitoring unit and LRA to ensure that inspections\nperformed complement, as opposed to overlap, each other. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 29.\n97. The MRDDA monitoring unit does not have an automated way to track inspections. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 29.\n98. There have been significant delays in the District's system in negotiating and completing contracts for non-\nMedicaid services, partly due to significant understaffing. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 32.\n99. Medicaid provider agreements and District contracts with providers lack quality controls, effective monitoring\nprovisions, and incentives or disincentives for superior or substandard service. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 32.\n100. Twenty-seven District employees have been detailed or reassigned from Forest Haven to MRDDA since\n1991 with no current position descriptions or any formal determination that they possess the skills and training to\nperform the tasks to which they are now assigned. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 32-33.\n101. Many, if not most, of the positions at MRDDA lack accurate, up-dated position descriptions. MRDDA\nsupervisors need assistance in proper performance evaluation preparation. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 33.\n102. Defendants acknowledge that there is no true system for providing services to MRDDA customers; rather\nthere are a number of agencies that perform functions that impact the MRDD population in relative isolation from\neach other. D.C. Addendum Rep. at 4.\n103. MAA is currently doing no provider reviews to determine if MRDDA customers are receiving the level of care\nfor which MAA is paying. D.C. Addendum Rep. at 4.\n104. There is currently no formal procedure that requires coordination between the District of Columbia's Public\nSchools (\"DCPS\") and MRDDA when an individual leaves the DCPS system and enters MRDDA's. D.C.\nAddendum Rep. at 4.\n105. There is insufficient staff assigned to conduct utilization reviews to ensure that the appropriate level of care\nis being provided to customers within the District's system. D.C. Addendum Rep. at 9.\n106. Based on Defendants own review, written policies and procedures are lacking in the District's system. While\nmany policies and procedures are established by HCFA, the Defendants' review indicated that MAA has not\nformulated or disseminated internal written policies and procedures. D.C. Addendum Rep. at 10.\n107. Automation in the system is outdated in the District's system. D.C. Addendum Rep. at 10.\n108. There is a lack of communication between DCPS divisions and between DCPS and MRDDA. D.C.\nAddendum Rep. at 11.\n109. The position description of the Administrator of MRDDA is obsolete and outdated. D.C. Georgetown Rep. at\n17.\n110. The District's CMD is understaffed to protect the rights of people with mental retardation and other\ndevelopmental disabilities. D.C. Georgetown Rep. at 19.\n111. The position descriptions for non-licensed MRDDA staff do not cite minimum educational requirements. If\nMRDDA administrative staff were effectively performing the duties and responsibilities as specified in the position\ndescriptions, the agency would not be experiencing multiple and ongoing crises. A significant proportion of\n106 MRDDA's staff is former direct care/service personnel. An analysis of the available forms for these personnel \n\n*106 fails to demonstrate that re-training or continuing education has occurred to provide personnel with the\nknowledge and competencies required to fulfill current duties and responsibilities. D.C. Georgetown Rep. at 23.\n112. In a recent review of performance ratings for MRDDA personnel, a majority had no performance ratings.\nD.C. Georgetown Rep. at 24.\nBUDGET, TIMELY PAYMENT OF VENDORS\n113. Since 1995, the District's budget allocation for CRF's and other non-Medicaid supported services has been\nreduced as a result of fiscal crises. These funds have yet to be restored to meet current demands. Adjusted for\ninflation, total spending for services for individuals with mental retardation and/or developmental disabilities in the\nDistrict declined 2 percent during 1991-1996; nationally during the same period, total spending for individuals with\nmental retardation and/or developmental disabilities advanced 24 percent in inflation adjusted terms. D.C.\nGeorgetown Rep. at 14.\n114. The District's budget process is not designed to support MRDDA and customer requirements. There is no\neffective system in place for identifying MRDDA's actual budgetary requirements in terms of District appropriated\nfunds. MRDDA cannot readily identify its current customer demographics and has no projection of future\ncustomer demographics. MRDDA does not track, and is unable to identify costs by customer category. D.C. MAI\nBudget Rep. at 3-1.\n115. IHPs are not used as input to project MRDDA resource requirements. The IHPs document the range of\nservices needed by a current customer, and of course, will change over time. Lack of IHP input tends to\nunderstate requirements since MRDDA's population is aging. D.C. MAI Budget Rep. at 3-2.\n116. The budget process begins with the prior year's baseline as the starting point. However, MRDDA has not\nbeen providing a fully satisfactory level of service. There are deficiencies in staff training, quality control, case\nmanagement, and other areas. Yet baseline budgeting tends to perpetuate existing problems and does not\nprovide management with alternatives and associated costs for addressing these issues. Plus, baseline\nbudgeting does not take into account the differential costs of person centered planning or the changing\nrequirements due to changes in the number or mix of clients. D.C. MAI Budget Rep. at 3-1, 3-2.\n117. Financial tracking and reporting are not adequate for program management purposes in the District's\nsystem. MRDDA has no timely tracking of expenditures and does not have a precise picture of funds available at\nany given point during the fiscal year. Despite the existence of many urgent requirements, the agency\nsignificantly underspent its FY 1999 general fund budget by $2.6 million. D.C. MAI Budget Rep. at 3-2.\n118. MRDDA's appropriated budget is not developed based on any real analysis of the expected expenditures of\nthe agency. Instead, the MRDDA appropriated budget, approximately $24 million per year, is based on no more\nthan guesswork and the use of the prior year's appropriations to estimate budgetary needs. This does not allow\nfor an accurate forecast of expected needs that would support rational policy decisions within the budget\ndevelopment process. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 34.\n119. The District does not know what its true cost is to provide services to individual customers, such that\n107 attempts to recover cost of care amounts from individual *107 customers may be inappropriate. D.C. Prelim. Rep.\nat 36.\n120. Fiscal issues have not been appropriately addressed within the District's system. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 2.\n121. The District does not know the total amount expended to operate the MRDDA program and provide services\nto the client population. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 34.\n122. There is inadequate information exchange between MRDDA and the DHS Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\").\nD.C. Prelim. Rep. at 34.\n\n123. MRDDA underspent its budget by approximately $2 million or ten percent of MRDDA's appropriated budget\n(which excluded Medicaid expenses), in part because the DHS CFO and MRDDA failed to communicate about\nquarterly budgetary forecasts. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 34.\n124. Amounts currently available for case manager trips to visit customers who live outside of the District are\ninsufficient. D.C. Prelim. Rep. at 34.\n125. The vendor payment system within the District's system is inadequate and should be redesigned. D.C.\nAddendum Rep. at 9.\n126. Audits of provider cost data are not timely conducted in the District's system. D.C. Addendum Rep. at 9.\n127. The total cost of the MRDDA-related programs is not captured by existing financial systems. D.C. MAI\nBudget Rep. at 3-3.\n128. Provider contracts in the District's system are vague and overly broad with no uniform provisions governing\nthe maintenance and custodianship over customer accounts and other property. The lack of specific procedural\nor contractual guidance, either by incorporation or reference, invites all sorts of abuses, and likely preclude the\nrecovery of any misappropriated funds. D.C. MAI Budget Rep. at 3-9, 3-10.\n129. Provider contracts in the District's system lack specific guidance for noncompliance with applicable\nregulations or contractual terms and afford no means of recourse for breach by the provider. D.C. MAI Budget\nRep. at 3-10.\nThe following Defendants' reports are referenced above:\nA.

The Consent\nOrder and Settlement Agreement are related documents. The Consent Order sets out the obligations of the\nparties regarding the endowment and funding of the Quality Trust in exchange for the waiver of certain fines and\nother liability. The Consent Order is to be adopted by the Court and shall be enforceable for procedures and\nremedies available for violations of a court order. The Settlement Agreement is an agreement amongst the\nparties and the Quality Trust which sets forth the Quality Trust's operations and duties in order to ensure that the\nQuality Trust complies with the parties' agreement regarding its mission and functions. This Court shall retain\njurisdiction to enforce the Settlement Agreement as to class members only, with remedies available to the parties\nto the Settlement Agreement under applicable contract law. Upon dismissal of this action, the Settlement\nAgreement shall be enforceable as a contract in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.\n\n[2] This Consent Order provides throughout that the Quality Trust's scope of activities shall include review of\nservices to \"consumers\" rather than just \"Evans class members.\" \"Consumers\" refers to all applicants and/or\nrecipients of services of the District of Columbia's developmental disabilities service delivery system. The Evans\nclass members (i.e., those individuals who have at one time resided at Forest Haven) comprise a subset of this\noverall group of consumers. Defendants desire not to create a bifurcated system of services for its citizens with\ndevelopmental disabilities, and therefore, agree that the Quality Trust's scope of activities shall include review of\nservices to class and non-class members. This unified system does not extend the Court's jurisdiction to non-\nclass members.\n[1] The extension of the Quality Trust functions to class members and non-class members does not extend the\nCourt's jurisdiction to non-class members.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Nickles, DC Government, Washington,\nDC, for Defendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nELLEN SEGAL HUVELLE, District Judge.\nIn 1976, residents of Forest Haven, then the District of Columbia's institution for persons with developmental\ndisabilities, filed this class action alleging that they were receiving constitutionally-deficient care, treatment,\neducation, and training. In 1978, the Court entered a consent decree pursuant to which defendants agreed that\nplaintiffs' constitutional rights had been violated and that they would take certain actions to remedy those\n[1]\nviolations.  A series of consent orders and remedial plans followed in which defendants admitted that they were\n129 still violating class *129 members' constitutional rights and agreed to take additional actions to remedy those\nconstitutional violations. The last such consent order and remedial plan was entered into in 2001, when the\nparties jointly agreed to a Plan for Compliance, pursuant to which defendants could demonstrate compliance with\nthe Court's orders and terminate the litigation.\nIn 2006, plaintiffs filed a motion to find defendants in noncompliance and to appoint a receiver. On March 30,\n2007, the Court granted that motion in part, concluding, based on extensive factual findings, that there had been\n\"systemic, continuous, and serious noncompliance with many of the Court's Orders.\" Evans v. Fenty, 480\nF.Supp.2d 280, 325 (D.D.C. 2007) (\"March 2007 Liability Opinion\"). With respect to remedy, the Court asked the\nSpecial Masters to assist by making findings and recommendations to the Court that address, inter alia, \"the\ncurrent status of defendants' compliance, what are the available options for curing the identified deficiencies, and\nwhether a receivership is the most effective and efficient remedy available to the Court.\" Id. at 326.\nNow before the Court is the Special Masters' Report and Recommendation, which concludes that, as of\nDecember 2008, defendants were still in noncompliance with the Court's orders and recommends the\nappointment of an \"Independent Compliance Administrator\" to bring defendants into compliance and to end to\nthis litigation. (Special Masters' Report and Recommendation Regarding A Remedy For Defendants'\nNoncompliance With Court Orders at 128, Aug. 14, 2009 [\"2009 Special Masters' Report\"].) Defendants have\n\n[2]\nfiled limited objections to the report and oppose the imposition of the proposed remedy;  plaintiffs have no\nobjections to the report and ask that the Court adopt the findings of the Special Masters and their recommended\nremedy. Also before the Court is a motion the District filed, after the Special Masters concluded their proceedings\nin January 2009, to vacate all consent orders and to dismiss the entire case. For the reasons stated herein,\ndefendants' motion to vacate and dismiss will be denied. The Court will address, in a future memorandum opinion\nand order, defendants' objections to the Special Masters' Report and Recommendations.\nBACKGROUND\n130 The lengthy procedural history of this litigation prior to March 30, 2007, will not *130 be repeated here, as it was\nfully summarized in the Memorandum Opinion filed on that date. See Evans, 480 F.Supp.2d at 281. Certain\nevents, however, are relevant to defendants' pending motions and will be briefly noted below, followed by a more\n[3]\ndetailed summary of the facts and procedural history that post-date that decision.\nI. KEY EVENTS PRIOR TO THE MARCH 30, 2007 LIABILITY OPINION\nA. 1978 Final Judgment and Order\n[4]\nOn June 14, 1978, the Court  entered a \"Final Judgment and Order\" providing for permanent injunctive relief. \nEvans v. Washington, 459 F.Supp. 483 (D.D.C.1978) (\"1978 Consent Order\"). The 1978 Consent Order was\npremised on the recognition, which was consented to by the parties, that plaintiffs had federal constitutional rights\nunder the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment \"to be kept free from harm\" and \"to receive habilitative care\nand treatment in the alternative least restrictive of individual liberty\" and that \"violations of [those] federal\nconstitutional rights... have occurred.\" Id. at 484. To remedy those violations, the 1978 Consent Order required\ndefendants and their successors to take a number of specific actions, see id. at 484-90, that, loosely classified,\nfell into three categories: health care, safety, and welfare/habilitation. Defendants \"consented to the entry of [the\n1978 Consent Order] so as to assure protection of the rights of plaintiffs.\" Id. at 484.\nB. 1981 Consent Order\nIn 1981, plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor filed motions for contempt, based on defendants' noncompliance with\nthe 1978 Consent Order. Those motions led to the entry of a second Consent Order, which supplemented\ndefendants' obligations under the 1978 Consent Order with a list of agreed-upon \"measures necessary to the\nimplementation of this Court's Order of June 14, 1978.\" (Consent Order at 1, June 25, 1981 [\"1981 Consent\nOrder\"].) The 1981 Consent Order did not revisit the legal conclusions of the 1978 Consent Order nor did it\n\"release defendants from their obligations\" thereunder. (Id. at 10.) Rather, the parties came to an agreement that\ndefendants needed to take additional measures to assure protection of plaintiffs' constitutional rights. The\nagreed-upon measures supplemented defendants' obligations in each area addressed by the 1978 Consent\nOrder00health, safety and welfare/habilitation. (Id. at 1-10.)\n97\nC. 1982 Supreme Court Decision (Youngberg v. Romeo)\nIn 1982, the Supreme Court decided Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982),\naddressing for the first time the constitutional rights of an individual who had been involuntarily committed to a\nstate institution for the mentally retarded. As discussed infra, defendants' motion to vacate is based in part on the \nYoungberg decision and defendants' contention, made for the first time in the 28 years since Youngberg was\n131 decided, that Youngberg changed the law and established that the 1978 Consent *131 Order rested on\n\"extraconstitutional\" rights.\n\nD. 1983 Consent Order\nIn 1982, plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor again filed motions for contempt, which led to the entry of a third\nConsent Order. (Consent Order, Feb. 8, 1983 [\"1983 Consent Order\"]). The 1983 Consent Order similarly did not\nrevisit the legal conclusions of the 1978 Consent Order nor did it release defendants from their obligations under\nprior orders; it merely added to those obligations \"to assist in the implementation of those orders.\" (Id. at 14-15.)\nAgain, the agreed-upon measures supplemented defendants' obligations in each area addressed by the 1978\nConsent Order00health, safety and welfare/habilitation. (Id. at 2-14.)\n97\nE. 1990 Contempt Order\nIn 1989, plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor again filed motions for contempt. In 1990, the Court issued an Order\nholding the District in civil contempt based on its \"consistent and continuing violation of the three Consent Orders\n[of 1978, 1981 and 1983].\" Evans, 480 F.Supp.2d at 284 (quoting Order, Jan. 30, 1990 [\"Jan.1990 Contempt\nOrder\"].) After a sanctions hearing, the Court issued an Order that, inter alia, required defendants to complete the\noutplacement of the 233 plaintiffs remaining at Forest Haven by September 30, 1991. Id. (citing Order, Apr. 9,\n1990 [\"Apr.1990 Contempt Order\"]). By October 1991, all plaintiffs had been moved from Forest Haven and the\ninstitution was closed.\nF. 1995 Contempt Order, Appointment of Special Master, 1996\nRemedial Plan\nIn 1995, four years after the closure of Forest Haven, plaintiff and plaintiff-intervenor filed motions for contempt,\nfor remedial sanctions and for appointment of a Special Master. After two hearings, the Court again found the\nDistrict to be in contempt based on \"clear and convincing evidence, including defendants' conceded violations,\nthat the District is not in compliance with the consent orders in this case....\" (Findings of Fact & Conclusions of\n[5]\nLaw at 7, Oct. 11, 1995 [\"1995 Contempt Order\"].) In its decision, the Court  observed that as of 1995, it had\n\"entered numerous orders, including consent orders between the parties, to safeguard the rights of class\nmembers and ensure their adequate and appropriate habilitation.\" (Id. at 1.) The Court further noted that\n\"[d]efendants admit that the District has a continuing responsibility to provide the class members with habilitation\nin accordance with their needs\" and \"admit that they also are required to provide adequate medical care,\npsychological care, day programming, community residential placements and other support systems as set forth\nin the class members' [individual habilitation plans].\" (Id. at 5-6 (emphasis added).) The Court proceeded to find\nthe District in contempt because it (1) was delinquent in ensuring timely payment of providers, in violation of the\n1983 Consent Order; (2) permitted inadequate case manager ratios, in violation of the 1983 Consent Order; and\n(3) offered inadequate \"community living arrangements\" and \"community-based day programs and services as\n132 are necessary to provide them with minimally adequate habilitation,\" in *132 violation of the 1978 Consent Order.\n(Id. at 7-8.)\nThe Court further found that defendants' \"history of noncompliance, compounded by the complicated and\nfactually elusive nature of the matters under consideration,\" required the appointment of a \"Special Master\"\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53 to \"evaluate and ensure defendants' compliance with the Court's\nOrders and Consent Decrees ... and to recommend remedies for any deficiencies in defendants' compliance with\n[6]\nthe Orders.\" (Order of Reference at 2, Oct. 11, 1995 [\"1995 Reference Order\"].)\nIn August 1996, the Court, based on a Report and Recommendation from the Special Master, adopted a\n\"Remedial Plan,\" designed \"to enable defendants to come into compliance with the terms of this Court's multiple\nConsent Orders\" and to establish the conditions by which defendants could purge their civil contempt. Evans v.\nBarry, No. 76-CV-293, 1996 WL 451054, at *1-*2 (D.D.C. Aug. 2, 1996) (\"1996 Order & Remedial Plan\"). In\nadopting the Remedial Plan, the Court observed that\n\n[d]efendants have, for over two years, chronically and unapologetically violated the terms of nearly\nevery aspect of this Court's multiple Consent Orders. Defendants' unrelenting contempt of this\nCourt's orders, and their seeming inability to bring themselves in compliance therewith, have\ncreated chaos for the care providers vested with day-to-day responsibility for the members of this\nplaintiff class. The plaintiffs comprising this class, as defendants well know, are ill-equipped to\nadjust to or defend against the city's failure to assist their care providers in giving them the care\nand treatment they desperately need.\nId. at *2. The Court also warned defendants that:\nthe point has been reached beyond which this Court will not tolerate further and continuing\nincidences of contempt by defendants. Any further noncompliance with this Court's longstanding\nConsent Orders, and noncompliance with the Remedial Plan issued this date, must be expected\nby defendants to result in serious consequences.\nId. The remedial plan concerned defendants' obligations in each area addressed by the 1978 Consent\nOrder00health, safety and welfare/habilitation. Id. at *3-*8\n97\nG. 1999 Sanctions Order\nIn April 1997, less than a year after the Court adopted the 1996 Remedial Plan, plaintiffs moved for sanctions\nbased on the District's admitted failure to pay providers within 30 days, as required under that Plan. In February\n[7]\n1999, the Court granted the motion and imposed a $5 million fine on defendants. Evans v. Williams, 35\nF.Supp.2d 88 (D.D.C.1999). As part of that decision, the Court modified the 1996 Remedial Plan to order the\nSpecial Master to work with the parties to \"develop and recommend to the Court a plan for the conclusion of the\n[litigation]\" and the termination of the Court's jurisdiction in a manner that would ensure that plaintiffs' interests\nwould continue to be protected. Id. at 97. As envisioned by the Court, the plan would include \"recommended\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the following topics\":\n133 *133 a. Goals. A summary and articulation of the goals of this lawsuit as reflected in the 1978 and\n1983 Consent Orders, the 1996 Remedial Plan, and all other Court-ordered obligations (hereafter\ncollectively \"Court-ordered requirements\").\nb. Current compliance. An evaluation of existing programs to determine the extent of defendants'\ncompliance with requirements for the protection of the health and safety of the plaintiff class and\ntheir effectiveness in meeting the goals described in subparagraph a, including but not limited to\nthe provision of necessary medical and other health services and the compliance of private\nvendors with District of Columbia licensing and payment requirements governing community\nresidence facilities, intermediate care facilities, foster care, day treatment programs, day\nprograms, employment programs, representative payment and guardianship.\nc. Adequate habilitation. The extent of defendants' compliance with Court-ordered requirements\nfor the provision of adequate habilitation in the least restrictive setting and their effectiveness\n(strengths and weaknesses) in meeting the goals described in subparagraph a, including\nindividual habilitation planning, individual financial planning, case management, appropriate\nresidential services, adequate habilitation services, and the safeguarding of client funds.\nd. Payment of providers. The extent of defendants' compliance with Court-ordered requirements\nfor the timely payment of private providers who provide the plaintiff class with appropriate\nresidential services, day treatment programs, vocational and supported employment services, day\nprograms, medical, mental health, dental, and other services required by the Court.\ne. Quality assurance. The quality assurance methods to be developed and implemented by\ndefendants to monitor continually the performance of public and private providers of service in\nmeeting the goals of the suit.\n\nf. Standards and compliance measurement. The standards, including outcome standards to be\ndeveloped and implemented by defendants, that should be used to determine defendants'\ncontinued compliance with Court-ordered requirements, and the way in which compliance with\nsuch standards should be measured.\ng. Substantial compliance standards. The degree of compliance that should be required with each\nof the standards recommended.\nh. Permanent monitoring. The steps necessary to establish permanent, objective, efficient, and\neffective post-termination monitoring of the programs serving class members by independent\nentities (for example, private accreditation services and independent monitoring bodies).\nI. Individual and community advocacy. The steps necessary to coordinate existing mechanisms\nand to develop needed mechanisms for the advocacy of the interests of class members, on a[n]\nindividual and community-wide basis, in compliance with Court-ordered requirements, including\nbut not limited to the use of court-appointed attorneys, guardianships, and medical decision-\nmaking procedures for class members.\nId. at 97-98.\nH. Appointment of Independent Court Monitor\nIn November 2000, the Court entered an Order granting the parties' joint motion for the appointment of an\nindependent Court Monitor. (Order Regarding the Appointment of an Independent Court Monitor, Nov. 21, 2000.)\n134 The Order specified that the duties of the Court Monitor were *134 to include observing, monitoring, reporting\nfindings, and making recommendations to the parties, the Special Master, and the Court regarding\nimplementation of the Court's Orders, and to submit quarterly reports on defendants'\"compliance\" with the Court's\nOrders. (Id. at 2-5.) The Order also provided that the \"findings, recommendations and reports of the Court\nMonitor ... may be introduced as evidence when relevant and admissible in accordance with the Federal Rules of\nEvidence.\" (Id. at 5.) In order to perform these duties, the Monitor was granted broad access \"to the persons,\nresidences, facilities, buildings, programs, services, documents, records, personnel and materials the Monitor\n[8]\ndeems necessary or appropriate in performing [her duties].\" (Id. at 4.)\nI. 2001 Opinion and Order: Joint Stipulated Findings of Fact; Plan for\nCompliance; Consent Order and Settlement Agreement\nIn 2001, after \"lengthy negotiations\"00 almost two years of work by the Special Master, the parties, and an expert\n97\nto the Special Master00the parties came to a series of agreements that \"set forth a careful and detailed blueprint\n97\nfor achieving compliance with the Court's Orders, for the development of permanent and independent\nmechanisms to safeguard the rights of class members, and for the phased withdrawal of judicial oversight of the\nDistrict of Columbia's mental retardation system as compliance with the Court Orders [wa]s achieved.\" Evans v.\nWilliams, 139 F.Supp.2d 79, 81 (D.D.C.2001) (\"2001 Consent Order\"). Upon consideration of these agreements,\n[9]\nthe Court, on March 30, 2001, (1) adopted the Parties' Joint Stipulated Findings of Fact, id. at 96-107;  (2)\n[10]\napproved the 2001 Plan for Compliance and Conclusion of Evans v. Williams, id. at 85 (\"2001 Plan\");  and (3)\nentered a Consent Order, with a Settlement Agreement attached thereto. Id. at 85-96. Two aspects of these\nagreements remain critically important today: the 2001 Plan to achieve compliance and the creation of the Quality\nTrust in exchange for plaintiffs' waiver of claims on noncompliance.\n135  1. 2001 Compliance Plan\n*135\nThe 2001 Plan started from the premise \"that there is already in place a declaratory judgment and permanent\ninjunction recognizing a federal constitutional right to receive individualized habilitative care and treatment in the\n\nleast separate, most integrated, and least restrictive settings, and to be kept free from harm.\" (2001 Plan at 6.)\nThe Plan then identified (as the Court's 1999 Order had requested) the agreed-upon \"goals\" of the existing Court\norders. According to the Plan, the parties agreed that existing Court Orders embodied eight goals:\n(1) Appropriate individual habilitation in the community in the least separate, most integrated, and\nleast restrictive environment;\n(2) Protection from harm;\n(3) Safeguarding consumers' personal possessions;\n(4) Monitoring the service system;\n(5) Advocacy for consumers;\n(6) Adequate budget;\n(7) Timely payment of vendors; and\n(8) Essential systemic conditions.\n[11]\nEvans, 139 F.Supp.2d at 81.  For each goal (or subgoal), the Plan identified the \"relevant Court Orders,\" the\n\"specific tasks that must be performed to implement those Orders,\" the \"time frames within which the tasks must\nbe performed,\" the \"specific outcome criteria for measuring compliance,\" the \"standard of compliance,\" and the\n\"methods by which evidence will be collected and evaluated to assess compliance.\" Id. at 81-82.\nThe Court approved the 2001 Plan \"as, in effect, a statement of the conditions for the expected vacating of the\nCourt's relevant prior Orders.\" Id. at 85. It was anticipated that\n[w]hile the Plan is not intended to be an independently enforceable document, the parties do\nintend that there will be accountability for its implementation. The Plan requires periodic progress\nreports to the Special Master on its implementation and calls for status conferences with the Court\nto be scheduled at least bimonthly. The parties agree that if the Court finds that defendants have\nsatisfied the outcome criteria set forth in the Plan, they also will be in compliance with the related\nCourt Orders. Any failure of defendants to implement the tasks identified in the Plan so as to meet\nthe requirements of the related Court Orders would be evidence of noncompliance with those\nOrders. The Plan provides that until the existing Court Orders are vacated, plaintiffs may seek\nappropriate judicial relief, including requesting orders requiring compliance with the Order(s)\nunderlying the objectives of the Plan.\nId. at 83.\n2. Creation of the Quality Trust\nThe Consent Order and attached Settlement Agreement provided that, in exchange for the plaintiffs waiving \"any\nand all claims for past violations of the Court's Orders,\" the District would \"endow and annually fund ... a durable,\nindependent, nonprofit organization that will monitor and advance the individual and collective interests of people\nwith developmental disabilities in the District of Columbia's service delivery system.\" Id. at 86. Defendants agreed\n136 to fund the organization, denominated the Quality Trust, with a total of $31.5 million over eleven years.[12]*136\nUltimately, the goal was for the Quality Trust to be \"an external monitoring body to permanently protect the\ninterests of the class members once this case ends.\" Id. at 83.\n\n* * *\nThe 2001 agreements, which the Court accepted and adopted, contemplated that as defendants satisfied the\noutcome criteria in the 2001 Plan for particular groups of Court Orders, they would move the Court to have those\nOrders vacated and dismissed with the ultimate goal that, over time, defendants would\nimplement all of the required actions and meet the specified outcome criteria in order to\nsuccessfully move the Court to vacate and dismiss the related Court Orders, except the\ndeclaratory judgment on the constitutional rights of the consumers to receive individualized\nhabilitation in the least separate, most integrated and least restrictive environment and to be\nprotected from harm.\n(2001 Plan at 9-10 (emphasis added).) Once the Court orders were vacated and dismissed, the plaintiffs agreed\nthat they would not \"seek recourse to the federal court to litigate individual violations of rights in this case\npursuant to the declaratory judgment which will remain unless: (1) there are systemic violations of the declaratory\njudgment; or (2) legal remedies are unavailable in Superior Court (e.g., due to repeal of the statutes); or (3) there\nis a failure to adequately fund the Quality Trust pursuant to the Consent Order dated January 19, 2001.\" (Id.)\nSince 2001, however, defendants have not invoked the procedures set forth in the 2001 Plan, to which they\nagreed, to vacate any Court Orders based on their implementation of the necessary tasks and satisfaction of the\n[13]\nspecified outcome criteria.  Accordingly, the Court Orders \"continue to remain enforceable in federal court.\" (\nId.) Moreover, even though the 2001 Plan itself was \"not intended to be an enforceable document,\" the parties\nagreed that plaintiffs \"have a great interest in ensuring that the agreed upon actions identified in this Plan are in\nfact implemented effectively and in a timely manner by defendants to secure the benefits and protections\nprovided for by the Court Orders,\" and provided, therefore, that \"in the event that defendants do not implement\nthe provisions of this Plan effectively and on a timely basis, plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor retain the right to\nseek appropriate judicial relief, based on this evidence of noncompliance with the Court Orders, including Orders\nrequiring specific performance of the Plan.\" (Id.)\nJ. 2004 Order\nIn 2004, after several years of receiving discouraging monitor reports on the implementation of the 2001 Plan,\n[14]\nthis Court  issued an order to address the \"need for greater coordination among District of Columbia agencies\nwhich have responsibilities for actions that are necessary to achieve compliance with the 2001 Plan.\" (Order at 1,\n137 Jan. 21, 2004 [\"2004 Coordination Order\"].) *137 As described therein, the parties had met with the Court on\nDecember 12, 2003, and agreed that \"the current lack of such coordination has impeded the timely completion of\nnecessary tasks identified in the 2001 Plan.\" (Id. at 1-2.) The 2004 Order reiterated that the District remained\nsubject to the Court's previous orders, which were issued \"to effectuate the rights of class members to adequate\nhabilitation in a manner least restrictive of their liberty\" and that the purpose of the 2001 Plan was to require\ndefendants to take certain actions to achieve compliance with those orders. (Id. at 1.) The Order required, inter\nalia, that the Mayor appoint a Deputy Mayor or other senior official \"to be responsible for the day-to-day efforts of\nDistrict of Columbia agencies to achieve compliance with this Court's orders and the 2001 Plan.\" (Id. at 2.) That\nindividual was to \"have the necessary authority to supervise and direct the activities of\" and \"coordinate the\nefforts of all District of Columbia agencies\" as necessary to \"carry out their obligations under the 2001 Plan and\nprevious orders of this Court,\" and was to \"cooperate with and report periodically to the Special Masters and\nCourt Monitor on defendants' progress,\" and \"appear before this Court at each status conference and report to\nthe Court on behalf of defendants regarding the status of defendants' compliance with the 2001 Plan and orders\n[15]\nof this Court.\" (Id. at 3.)\n\nII. MOTION FOR RECEIVERSHIP: LIABILITY PHASE\nIn May 2006, plaintiffs filed a motion asking the Court to find defendants in noncompliance with the outstanding\nCourt Orders and to place the District's Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Administration\n[16]\n(\"MRDDA\") into receivership.  The Court bifurcated proceedings into a \"liability\" and a \"remedy\" phase. Evans,\n480 F.Supp.2d at 291 (\"March 2007 Liability Opinion\").\nWhile the liability phase was ongoing, several notable events occurred. On December 20, 2006, the\n\"Developmental Disabilities Services Agency,\" later renamed the \"Department on Disability Services,\" was\nestablished by emergency legislation as a separate Cabinet-level agency to serve consumers formerly served by\nthe MRDDA, including the Evans class members. Developmental Disabilities Services Management Reform\nEmergency Amendment Act of 2006, §§ 103, 105(1), (2). In January 2007, Adrian Fenty took office as Mayor for\nthe District of Columbia. On February 5, 2007, defendants asked the Court to delay its liability ruling in light of the\nnew administration's \"commitment to DDS and its consumers\" and its newly adopted \"Systems Improvement\nPlan\" in order \"to allow sufficient time for the DDS to appropriately address the continuing concerns of the Court,\nthe Monitor, the Department of Justice, and plaintiffs.\" (Defs.' Notice of Filing of Supplemental Information in\nResp. to the Ct. Monitor's Quarterly Report at 10, Feb. 5, 2007.) In making its request, the District indicated that it\nwas \"cognizant that much remains to be done to bring DDS into compliance with outstanding court orders and\n138 the 2001 Plan,\" but promised the Court that the \"Fenty Administration is fully committed *138 to the success of\nthe new agency, the delivery of improved services and care to the consumers served by the agency, and\ncompliance with the 2001 Plan.\" (Id. at 8.) At a status hearing the next day, the Court rejected this request and\nindicated that it intended to issue its liability ruling based on the record as of November 29, 2006, when the Court\nMonitor had filed her supplemental report as requested by the Court, but that information about improvements\nand accomplishments after that date would be considered in any remedy phase. (Hr'g Tr. at 23-24, Feb. 6, 2007.)\nOn March 30, 2007, the Court issued its liability ruling, concluding that plaintiffs had met their burden to show that\nthere had been \"systemic, continuous, and serious noncompliance\" with the Court's prior Orders. Evans, 480\nF.Supp.2d at 325.\nA. Findings: Health, Safety and Welfare\nThe Court organized its findings in terms of these three broad subject areas: health, safety and welfare. Based on\na record that closed in November 2006, the Court found that\nplaintiffs have demonstrated, by clear and convincing evidence, that defendants have failed to\ncomply with existing Court Orders in the core areas of health, safety, and welfare. These failures\nare systemic in that they affect many class members served by a cross-section of providers and\noccur throughout defendants' service delivery system. They are serious in that they concern\nmatters that are integral to class members' health, safety, and well-being. And, they are\ncontinuous in that the same issues of noncompliance have persisted year after year.\nId. at 298. A brief summary of the Court's findings follows.\nIn the category of \"health,\" the Court found that:\ndefendants have failed in many significant respects to accomplish the tasks and to achieve the\noutcome criteria in the 2001 Plan that relate to the Court's Orders regarding the provision of health\ncare and to comply with the terms of the Orders themselves. Defendants' deficient performance\nwith respect to these measures provides ample evidence that defendants have failed to comply\nwith the Court's Order that \"[a] program of medical, dental and health related services which\nprovides accessibility, quality and continuity of care is required,\" as well as with Court Orders\nrequiring development of habilitation plans and programs that incorporate all services needed by\nclass members and implementation of appropriate training programs for all staff.\n\nId. at 305 (citations omitted).\nIn the category of \"safety,\" the Court found that:\ndefendants have failed in many significant respects to accomplish the tasks and outcome criteria\nassociated with the Court's Orders relating to class member safety and to comply with the terms\nof the Orders themselves. Defendants' performance in the areas discussed above provides ample\nevidence that defendants have failed to comply with the Court's Orders prohibiting all acts of\n\"physical or psychological abuse, neglect or mistreatment\" of class members, requiring the prompt\nreporting and investigation of all such incidents and the prompt dissemination of the reports of\nsuch investigations to the Court Monitor and other interested parties, requiring the development\nand implementation of appropriate training programs for all staff, including staff assigned to\n139 residential settings, and requiring defendants to *139 provide necessary monitoring mechanisms.\nId. at 313-314 (citations omitted).\nFinally, in the category of \"welfare,\" the Court found that defendants were not in compliance in several respects.\nFirst, in terms of the \"least restrictive, most integrated setting requirement,\" the Court found that:\ndefendants have not complied with the Court's 1978 Order that all class members be provided\nwith \"community living arrangements suitable to each, together with such community-based day\nprograms and services as are necessary to provide them within minimally adequate habilitation ...\nin the least separate, most integrated and least restrictive community settings.\"\nId. at 319 (quoting Evans, 459 F.Supp. at 484). The Court also found serious problems in the areas of\nimplementing \"individual support plans\" (\"ISPs\") and thus in \"ensuring that class members actually receive the\nservices and supports they require,\" id. at 320, and a failure to comply with orders regarding \"adaptive\nequipment.\" Id. at 321. Finally, the Court found problems in the area of case management, concluding that:\ndefendants \"fail[ed] to ensure that case managers complete the required number of visits and that\nthey take appropriate action when a class member has been the subject of a serious incident\";\n\"[f]ail[ed] to ensure that case managers are properly trained before receiving caseloads\"; and that\ncase managers \"fail[ed] to ensure that ISPs are fully implemented.\"\nId. at 324.\nThe Court summarized its findings as follows:\nAs a result of these failings, class members continue to be placed in inappropriate and overly\nrestrictive residential and day programs, rather than in the least restrictive, most integrated\nsettings. Provider and MRDDA staff, including case managers, are not adequately trained, and\ncase managers do not visit class members with the required frequency and do not adequately\naddress deficiencies in class members' care. In many instances, class members do not receive\nthe needed services and supports that have been identified in their ISPs. Protocols necessary to\nprotect class members' health and safety, such as feeding, positioning, and behavioral plans, are\nroutinely not followed. Health risks are not adequately assessed and monitored for many class\nmembers, and recommendations by health care providers are not implemented in a timely\nmanner. While incidents of abuse and neglect of class members persist, defendants have failed to\nensure that these and other serious incidents, including class member deaths, are investigated in\na timely manner, that the results of such investigations are shared with providers, and that\nrecommended corrective and preventive actions are implemented. Defendants have also\ncompromised the monitoring process by altering death investigation reports.\nId. at 324-25. These findings were the basis for the Court's ultimate conclusion that defendants' noncompliance\nwith Court orders had been \"systemic, continuous and serious.\" Id. at 325.\n\nB. Remedy\nAs for the remedy of receivership sought by the plaintiffs, the Court observed:\nAlthough it is clear based on the tortured history of this case that there have been repeated\nfailures to comply with the Court's Orders, this determination is in no way determinative of the\n140 question *140 whether plaintiffs are correct in their argument that a receivership should be\nimposed.\nId. at 326. Rather, receivership is a \"remedy of last resort,\" that \"should be undertaken only when absolutely\nnecessary.\" Id. (quoting District of Columbia v. Jerry M., 738 A.2d 1206, 1213 (D.C.1999)).\nIn light of the complexity of this inquiry, and the fact that \"recent developments ... are encouraging and will be\nhighly relevant to the remedial phase of this action,\" the Court determined that it would \"enlist the assistance of\nthe Special Masters, who have ably served in this capacity for many years, to make findings and\nrecommendations to the Court that address, inter alia, the current status of defendants' compliance, what are the\navailable options for curing the identified deficiencies, and whether a receivership is the most effective and\nefficient remedy available to the Court.\" Id. at 326. The Court instructed that the \"determination whether other\nremedies are inadequate and whether receivership remains the only viable option to effectuate compliance with\ncourt orders is to be guided by a number of factors, including\"\n(1) \"whether there were repeated failures to comply with the Court's orders\"; (2) whether further\nefforts to secure compliance would only lead to \"confrontation and delay\"; (3) whether leadership\nis available which can \"turn the tide within a reasonable time period\"; (4) \"whether there was bad\nfaith\"; (5) \"whether resources are being wasted\"; and, (6) \"whether a receiver can provide a quick\nand efficient remedy.\"\nId. (quoting Jerry M., 738 A.2d at 1213 (quoting Dixon v. Barry, 967 F.Supp. 535, 550 (D.D.C.1997))). The Court's\nfinal observation was that \"the daunting task of finding ways to remedy the problems still remains. In this regard,\nthe Court expects the parties to continue their prior efforts to resolve this matter so that the plight of the class\nmembers can be improved as expeditiously as possible, and they will not have to continue to await the outcome\nof this painfully lengthy and cumbersome litigation.\" Id. at 327.\nIII. MOTION FOR RECEIVERSHIP: REMEDY PHASE\nA. Supplemental Order of Reference to the Special Masters\nFollowing the issuance of the March 30, 2007 decision, the parties conferred and jointly agreed on a\nsupplemental order of reference to the Special Masters. (Supp. Order of Reference, May 3, 2007 [\"2007\nReference Order\"].) The 2007 Reference Order provided, inter alia, as follows:\nBoth Margaret G. Farrell and Clarence J. Sundram have served as Special Masters in this case\nfor many years under prior Orders of Reference. The Court finds that it is justified and necessary\nto continue their appointment to assist the Court for as long as the Court deems necessary in this\nmatter.\n(Id. at 1.) It further provided that:\nThe Masters are authorized to conduct proceedings relating to the necessity for remedial relief,\nincluding, as needed, discovery, hearings, mediation and settlement negotiations. At the\nconclusion of such proceedings, the Masters will issue a report to the Court making recommended\nfindings of fact, conclusions of law and recommendations regarding appropriate remedies.\n\n(Id. at 2.) Following the issuance of the Special Masters' report and recommendations, the parties were to \"file\nobjections to (or file a motion to adopt or to modify) such order, report or recommendations.\" (Id. at 4.) The\n141 parties were directed that all objections should \"specifically identify *141 the portions of the order, or report\ncontaining proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommendations for remedial action, to which\nobjection is made and the basis for the objection.\" (Id.) Finally, the Order provided that this Court would review de\nnovo \"all objections to the Masters' proposed findings of fact and recommendations regarding remedial relief\" and\n\"all objections to conclusions of law made or recommended by the Masters.\" (Id.)\nB. September 12, 2007 Consent Order (\"90-Day Order\")\n[17]\nAfter a quarterly status conference on August 9, 2007,  the parties agreed to develop, and the Court ultimately\nentered, a consent order \"setting forth a limited number of concrete, short-term goals related to retaining and\nincreasing the number of qualified providers and improving the health and safety of class members\" that the\nDistrict agreed to achieve \"during the three-month period from October 1, 2007, to December 31, 2007.\" (Order\nat 1, Sept. 12, 2007 [\"2007 90-Day Consent Order\"]). Pursuant to that Order, defendants agreed to take a\nnumber of specific actions that were focused on these two critical goals. (Id. at 2.) The Special Masters were\ntasked with determining defendants' compliance with the 2007 90-Day Consent Order, beginning in January\n2008. (Id. at 1.)\nOn August 18, 2008, the Special Masters filed their Report and Recommendation regarding defendants'\ncompliance with the 2007 90-Day Order. (Special Masters' Report & Recommendation Regarding Defs.'\nCompliance with the Consent Order of Sept. 12, 2007, Aug. 18, 2008 [\"2008 Special Masters' Report\"].) The\n2008 Special Masters' Report concluded that overall defendants \"did not demonstrate substantial compliance\nwith six out of the 13 provisions of the Consent Order that they recently agreed-upon, and whose obligations they\n[18]\nconcede they clearly understood.\" Id. at 107.\nC. Monitoring Compliance\nAt the same time it issued the 2007 90-Day Consent Order, the Court ordered the parties to \"file with the Court\nthe agreed-upon methodology to be used by the Court Monitor to monitor defendants' compliance with the\nrequirements of the 2001 Plan and the existing Court Orders by January 10, 2008.\" (Minute Order, Sept. 12,\n2007). Following the issuance of this Order, the Court Monitor circulated to the parties and the Special Masters a\nproposed monitoring protocol. On November 21, 2007, defendants filed a notice stating:\nBy communication of November 16, 2007, faced with the expenditure of substantial resources and\ntime to develop the above-referenced methodology, Defendants informed the Court Monitor that a\n142 meeting to develop a methodology *142 would not be needed since Defendants would not assert\nthat conditions have so fundamentally changed at this point that such comprehensive monitoring\nis appropriate. Accordingly, Defendants expressed the view that there was no need for the\ncomprehensive monitoring proposed by the Court Monitor and the significant expense attendant\nthereto that would be incurred.\n(Defs.' Notice Concerning Proposed Comprehensive Monitoring at 2, Nov. 21, 2007 (emphasis added).) By May\n2008, a monitoring protocol had still not been agreed upon. Just prior to the status conference set for May 15,\n2008, defendants filed a motion to stay discovery during the remedial phase of the case, which was denied by the\nCourt. (Hr'g Tr. at 38, May 15, 2008.) On May 19, 2008, the Court issued a scheduling order to govern the\nremedy phase.\nOn June 13, 2008, plaintiffs, in response to the Court's request, filed a summary of the remedies they were\nseeking. That filing set forth a range of possible remedies, \"running from no action by the Court up to court-\nappointed receivership over the entire Department on Disability Services, with oversight of all District agency\nfunctions pertaining to Evans class members and other individuals with developmental disabilities served by the\ndefendants.\" (Pls.' Filing on Remedies at 1, June 13, 2008.) Among these alternatives, plaintiffs endorsed the\n\nremedy of appointing a \"Special Administrator,\" who would \"oversee[] government agencies and functions\npertaining to class members until the District achieves substantial compliance with the Court's Orders,\" but who\nwould not have all the powers of a receiver. (Id. at 3.)\nD. Proceedings Before the Special Masters\nFollowing additional discovery and pretrial proceedings, the Special Masters conducted a three-day trial on\nDecember 10-12, 2008. Direct testimony from both fact and expert witnesses was presented by declaration or\nexcerpts from depositions. (Special Masters' Final Pretrial Order at 6, Nov. 28, 2008.) All witnesses were subject\nto live cross-examination. (Trial Tr., Dec. 10, 2008; Trial Tr., Dec. 11, 2008.) Plaintiffs presented the testimony of\n[19] [20]\ntwo fact witnesses  and two expert witnesses.  Defendants presented the testimony of six fact witnesses\n[21] [22]\n and three expert witnesses.  In addition, more than 200 exhibits were introduced into evidence.\nSubsequently, both parties submitted Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, as well as post-trial\nbriefs. The Quality Trust for Individuals with Disabilities filed an amicus brief in support of plaintiffs' motion and for\n143 the appointment *143 of a Special Administrator. On February 9, 2009, closing arguments were heard by the\nSpecial Masters.\nE. Districts' Motions to Vacate: April 20, 2009\nOn April 20, 2009, shortly before the Special Masters issued a draft of their Report and Recommendation,\ndefendants filed a motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) to vacate all consent orders and\ndismiss the case. Defendants asserted that \"[c]ontinued federal-court oversight is no longer equitable, as there is\nno question that the District has remedied the alleged constitutional and statutory violations that gave rise to the\n1978 Consent Order and its progeny\" and \"there is no reasonable basis for asserting that the District will revert to\nviolating the law if the Court's orders are lifted.\" (Defs.' Mot. to Vacate Consent Orders and Dismiss Action at 1,\nApr. 20, 2009.) For the first time, in a litigation that has been ongoing for more than 30 years and despite\nrepeated promises to comply with the existing Court orders, defendants took the position that their\nnoncompliance was irrelevant to the question of whether the Court should continue enforcing its orders because\nthose orders went \"beyond minimum standards necessary to satisfy constitutional requirements.\" (Id. at 3.) In a\nminute order filed on May 1, 2009, the Court advised the parties that no opposition to defendants' motion should\nbe filed because it intended to hold it in abeyance until it received the Special Masters' final Report and\nRecommendation.\nF. Special Masters' Report and Recommendations\nOn May 22, 2009, the Special Masters circulated, as required by the 2007 Supplemental Order of Reference, a\ndraft of their proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law for comment. In that draft, the Special Masters\n\"recommended that the Court's 2004 Order be amended to provide for a Special Compliance Officer to be jointly\nappointed by the Court and the Mayor with enhanced authority to coordinate and direct the activities of the\nvarious District agencies urgently needed to deliver constitutionally acceptable services to the plaintiff class.\"\n(2009 Special Masters' Report at 4.) The draft recommended \"that the Court appoint the Deputy Director of DDS/\nDDA, Laura Nuss, as the Special Compliance Officer merging in one person the legal responsibility under local\nlaw with the responsibilities and authority to be conferred by the Court, to lead defendants' efforts to achieve\ncompliance with the court orders.\" (Id. at 135.) The Special Masters believed that \"this least intrusive, and least\nexpensive, remedy was most likely ... to achieve compliance with Court Orders.\" (Id. at 4.) However, this remedy\n\"required the Mayor's agreement.\" (Id.) On July 6, 2009, the parties filed their comments on and objections to the\ndraft report. Defendants' comments indicated that the Mayor would not agree to the proposal to appoint a Special\nCompliance Officer, making that remedy \"no longer a viable one.\" (Id. at 135.)\nOn August 14, 2009, the Special Masters filed their final Report and Recommendations, based on the record\nfrom November 29, 2006, the close of the record for the liability phase, through December 2008, when they\nclosed the record before them. (Id. at 3.) As described herein, the Special Masters found that \"plaintiffs had\n\nproved by clear and convincing evidence that defendants continue to be in serious noncompliance with critical\nprovisions of outstanding court orders\" in the areas of health, safety, and welfare. (Id.) They recommended as a\nremedy the appointment of an \"Independent Compliance Administrator accountable only to the Court to supervise\n144 *144 and coordinate defendants' serial compliance with individual court ordered obligations so that the suit may\nbe dismissed in three years time or less.\" (Id. at 4-5).\n1. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\na. Health\nIn the area of health, the Special Masters found that defendants were noncompliant in several significant\nrespects. First, regarding medical care, they found that defendants had \"failed to completely perform some or all\nof the following duties\": \"documenting significant health problems in class members' health management plans;\nmonitoring implementation of health plans; implementing recommendations put forward by class members'\nphysicians and medical specialists and completing lab work and physician-ordered diagnostic tests.\" (Id. at\n26-27.) Thus, they concluded:\nThe evidence in the record indicates that a significant portion of the plaintiff class have health care\nneeds that are not identified in their health plans. Furthermore, too often needs identified in health\nplans are not met because health plans are not implemented00i.e. diagnostic tests, consultations\n97\nand treatments and follow up appointments are not provided or documented in their health\nrecords.\n(Id. at 31.) The Special Masters also found \"ongoing and significant problems with the delivery of timely and\nappropriate mental health and behavioral healthcare.\" (Id. at 35.) These problems included:\na) lack of access to sufficient psychiatric and psychological services; b) improper professional\npractices that are inconsistent with professional standards; c) recommended clinical therapies not\nbeing implemented; d) the failure to integrate the use of psychotropic medications into an overall\ntreatment plan; e) the failure to obtain informed consent and approval from Human Rights\nCommittees for use of these restrictive measures; and f) the lack of monitoring of the usage and\nside effects of psychotropic medications.\n[23]\n(Id.)  Finally, the Special Masters found that \"delays in obtaining guardianship for the provision of informed\nconsent for medical and dental treatment of class members... have continued\" (id. at 45), sometimes \"for months,\nsometimes more than a year, after the need for a guardian is first identified.\" (Id. at 50.) As a result, treatment is\ndelayed and class members suffer harmful consequences. (Id. at 49-50.)\nBased on these findings, the Special Masters concluded that \"plaintiffs have established by clear and convincing\nevidence\" that defendants continue \"to be in non-compliance with ... outstanding consent orders\" with regard to\n(1) \"class members' health\" (id. at 31); (2) \"mental and behavioral health care\" (id. at 41-42); and (3) timely\nappointment of guardians. (Id. at 49-50.)\nb. Safety and Protection from Harm\nThe Special Masters found the following problems with respect to defendants' obligations to ensure plaintiffs'\nsafety and protection from harm: (1) \"a significant number of untimely investigations\" into \"serious reportable\nincidents\" and deaths (id. at 52-53); (2) \"some IMEU reports continue to fail to thoroughly investigate serious\nreportable incidents\" (id. at 54); (3) except for Level I incidents, \"the investigation report format does not inquire\n145 about potential causes and contributory factors leading to the incident under investigation\" *145 (id. at 56); (4) an\ninability to \"identif[y] and address[] systemic issues arising in investigations\" (id. at 57); (5) \"numerous instances\nof providers filing late incident reports or no reports at all, conducting inadequate investigations, or failing to\nconduct required investigations with no recommendations for or evidence of enforcement actions being taken in\n\nresponse to these deficiencies\" (id. at 60); (6) \"[i]ncidents of harm ..., including serious physical injury, physical\nabuse and neglect\" (id. at 60); (7) harm resulting from \"delays in treatment due to problems with getting informed\nconsent\" (id. at 61); (8) \"harm due to inadequate health care management\" (id.); and (9) harm resulting from\nproblems with the District's \"transportation broker contract.\" (Id. at 64).\nBased on these findings, the Special Masters concluded that \"while there are some nascent signs of progress in\na few areas,\" there was \"clear and convincing evidence that the problems being experienced by class members\nin the area of safety and protection from harm are continuing, serious and systemic.\" (Id. at 67.)\nc. Welfare\nIn terms of court orders concerning plaintiff's \"welfare,\" the Special Masters found the plaintiffs had \"not sustained\ntheir burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence non-compliance with court orders requiring residential\nplacements in less restrictive settings\" (id. at 72); with court orders requiring that \"all class members have written\nISPs containing current habilitation plans, behavioral support plans and health plans\" (id. at 78); or with court\norders requiring a minimum of eight visits per year by a service coordinator/case manager. (Id. at 82). However,\nthey did find continuing problems in the following areas: (1) segregated day programs with arts and crafts as the\nprimary activity and a lack of opportunity for community experiences (id. at 73-74); (2) supported employment (id.\nat 74); (3) implementation of ISPs (id. at 77-79); and (4) service coordinators not ensuring that ISPs are fully\nimplemented or following up when they are not. (Id. at 81-84.)\nBased on these findings, the Special Masters concluded that there is \"clear and convincing evidence\" that\ndefendants have \"not met their obligation ... to provide adequate habilitation in non-residential, least restrictive,\ncommunity-integrated settings\" (id. at 74), or to \"[p]rovide all necessary and proper monitoring mechanisms to\nassure that community living arrangements, programs and supportive community services of the necessary\nquantity and quality are provided and maintained.\" (Id. at 83-84).\nd. Interagency Coordination\nAs the Special Masters noted,\n[a]lthough the primary responsibility for providing timely and effective services and supports to\nclass members rests with DDS/DDA, the success of this enterprise depends upon the coordinated\nefforts of several District agencies, including MAA/DHCF (formerly the Medical Assistance\nAdministration (MAA) in the Department of Health (DOH) and now the Department of Health Care\nFinance (DHCF)), through which most of the funding is provided, the Health Regulation and\nLicensing Agency (HRLA) in the DOH, which is responsible for licensing and enforcement with\nrespect to ICFs/MR, the Office of the Inspector General, which has investigative responsibilities\nfor Medicaid fraud and abuse, the Office of Attorney General which files petitions for\nguardianships in court, and other agencies involved in the personnel, procurement, and budget\n146 process... includ[ing] the Office of Contracts and Procurement, which has a *146 significant role in\nthe contracting process.\n(Id. at 84.) As described supra, the 2004 Coordination Order was aimed at improving interagency communication\ncoordination. The Special Masters found that despite evidence of improvement, \"[t]here has been little evidence\nsubmitted regarding specific compliance with [the 2004 Order].\" (Id. at 90.) According to the Special Masters\n[w]hat is missing is evidence of leadership or coordination by the Mayor's designee00the central\n97\npoint of the order00to give focus, direction and priority to interagency communication and\n97\ncoordination, to identify planned actions of one agency that may adversely affect the mission of\nanother and to take proactive steps to prevent such a consequence. In the absence of evidence of\nsuch efforts, the interagency efforts at the staff level between agencies have not been consistently\nsuccessful, and gaps in communication and coordination have resulted in harm to class members.\n\n(Id. at 90.) Indeed, the Special Masters found that \"[t]he evidence is that leaders in the key agencies that have\nthe most significant interagency relationship ... were unaware of the existing court order or of the responsibility of\nthe Mayor's designee in implementing it.\" (Id. at 92.) These findings led the Special Masters to conclude that\nthe current lack of awareness by key senior officials of the Order's existence and its requirements,\ncoupled with the absence of evidence of regular interagency meetings or communications with the\nMayor's designee regarding significant initiatives, and the evidence of breakdowns in interagency\ncoordination leading to the problems discussed above, are all clear and convincing evidence of\nongoing noncompliance with this court order which was that this Court Order has not been\nimplemented as intended to remedy a long-standing problem of lack of interagency coordination.\n(Id. at 93.)\n2. Remedy\nThe Special Masters concluded \"that the plaintiffs have demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that\nthere is a need for additional remedial measures ordered by the Court.\" (Id. at 133.) Having been unsuccessful in\ntheir attempt to get defendants to agree to their first choice of remedy, and after many years of futile attempts to\nreach an agreement with the Fenty Administration as to a workable remedy, the Special Masters' final report\nrecommended the appointment of an \"Independent Compliance Administrator\" who \"would be appointed by the\nCourt, be accountable only to the Court and would not hold an executive appointment.\" (Id. at 134.) As described\nby the Special Masters, the Independent Compliance Administrator would not have the same powers of a\nreceiver but would\nserve as the focal point for the compliance efforts of the defendants and work in close\ncollaboration with them, resulting in regular submissions of compliance reports as set forth in the\n2001 Plan, and phased judicial disengagement from active supervision of the defendants'\ndevelopmental disabilities service system within three years. The Independent Compliance\nAdministrator is not intended to have the powers of a receiver or to generally displace the power\nand authority of agency heads or subordinate officers. Rather, the authority and role of the\nIndependent Compliance Administrator is limited to actions necessary to achieve compliance with\n147 the court orders within a three year period. All District *147 agencies and personnel should be\ndirected to cooperate with the Independent Compliance Administrator. If there is a lack of\ncooperation, or resistance or intransigence, the Independent Compliance Administrator should be\nrequired to report it immediately to the Special Masters or the Court.\n(Id. at 134-35.)\nIV. CURRENT PROCEDURAL POSTURE\nAt a status conference on August 19, 2009, the Court set a briefing schedule for plaintiffs to respond to\ndefendants' motion for vacatur and dismissal, combined with a timetable for filing objections to the 2009 Special\nMasters' Report. Pursuant to the Court's order, defendants renewed their motion to vacate the consent orders\nand dismiss the action and combined it with their objections to the 2009 Special Masters' Report. (Defs.'\nRenewed Mot. to Vacate Consent Orders and To Dismiss Action, Oct. 7, 2009 [\"Defs.' Mot. to Vacate\"].) On\nNovember 6, 2009, plaintiffs filed their opposition to that motion (combined with their endorsement of the Special\nMasters' Report and Recommendations (Pls.' Resp. to Defs.' Objections to the Special Masters' Report &\nRecommendation, and Opp'n to their Mot. to Vacate All Prior Orders and Dismiss the Case, Nov. 6, 2009 [\"Pls.'\nOpp'n\"]). Plaintiff-intervenor, the United States, and the Quality Trust, as amicus curiae, also filed oppositions to\ndefendants' motion. (Pl. Intervenor's Opp'n to Defs.' Renewed Mot. to Vacate Consent Orders and To Dismiss\nAction, Nov. 6, 2009; Amicus Curiae Br. of Quality Trust for Individuals with Disabilities, Inc., Nov. 11, 2009\n[\"Quality Trust Opp'n\"].) Defendants filed their reply on December 2, 2009. (Defs.' Consolidated Reply in Support\nof Mot. to Vacate Consent Orders and To Dismiss Action, Dec. 2, 2009.) On December 17-18, 2009, the Court\n\nheard argument on defendants' motions to vacate and to dismiss and on whether to adopt the 2009 Special\nMasters' Report. The Court will address herein defendants' motions and will address plaintiffs' request that the\nCourt adopt the 2009 Special Masters' Report in a subsequent memorandum.\nANALYSIS\nDefendants have moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5), \"at the conclusion of a period of\n[24]\nmonitoring not to exceed three months,  to vacate the Consent Order entered on June 14, 1978 ... together\nwith all subsequent remedial orders, and to dismiss the action.\" (Defs.' Mot. to Vacate at 1.)\nRule 60(b)(5) provides that \"the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order,\nor proceeding\" if \"the judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged; it is based on an earlier judgment that\nhas been reversed or vacated; or applying it prospectively is no longer equitable ....\" Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5)\n(emphasis added). Defendants seek relief solely on the ground that enforcing the existing orders prospectively is\n\"no longer equitable.\" (Defs.' Mot. to Vacate at 4.) Conceding they are not in compliance with existing court\norders (see 12/17/09 Tr. at 14-16), defendants nonetheless contend that all court orders should be vacated\n148 because they have \"remedied the alleged constitutional and *148 statutory violations that gave rise to the 1978\nConsent Order and its progeny, and continued federal-court oversight is therefore no longer either equitable or\npermissible.\" (Mem. in Supp. of Defs.' Mot. to Vacate at 3 [\"Defs.' Mem.\"] (citing Horne v. Flores, ___ U.S. ___,\n129 S.Ct. 2579, 174 L.Ed.2d 406 (2009)).\nA party seeking modification of a judgment or order on the ground that applying it prospectively is no longer\nequitable \"bears the burden of establishing that a significant change in circumstances warrants revision of the\ndecree.\" Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 383, 112 S.Ct. 748, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992); \nHorne, 129 S.Ct. at 2593. A party seeking relief \"may meet its initial burden by showing ... a significant change in\neither factual conditions or in law.\" Rufo, 502 U.S. at 384, 112 S.Ct. 748 (emphasis added); Horne, 129 S.Ct. at\n2593. Changed factual conditions may include when \"`the objects of the decree have been attained.'\" Horne, 129\nS.Ct. at 2596 (quoting Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431, 442, 124 S.Ct. 899, 157 L.Ed.2d 855 (2004)). \"To\ndetermine the merits of this claim, [a court] `need[s] to ascertain whether ongoing enforcement of the original\norder [is] supported by an ongoing violation of ... law.'\" Id. at 2597 (citing Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 282,\n97 S.Ct. 2749, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977)); see also Frew, 540 U.S. at 442, 124 S.Ct. 899 (\"The federal court must\nexercise its equitable powers to ensure that when the objects of the decree have been attained, responsibility for\ndischarging the State's obligations is returned promptly to the State and its officials.\") If the party seeking\nmodification or vacatur can establish that the \"objective of the [district court's] order ... has been achieved\" and \"a\ndurable remedy has been implemented, continued enforcement of the order is not only unnecessary, but\nimproper.\" Horne, 129 S.Ct. at 2595. In the alternative, a significant change in law may warrant modification or\nvacatur of a decree \"when the statutory or decisional law has changed to make legal what the decree was\ndesigned to prevent.\" Rufo, 502 U.S. at 388, 112 S.Ct. 748; see also Horne, 129 S.Ct. at 2595 (\"[C]ourts must\nremain attentive to the fact that `federal-court decrees exceed appropriate limits if they are aimed at eliminating a\ncondition that does not violate [federal law] or does not flow from such a violation.'\" (quoting Milliken, 433 U.S. at\n282, 97 S.Ct. 2749)).\nIn considering a request for modification in an institutional reform case, a district court must take a \"flexible\napproach.\" Horne, 129 S.Ct. at 2594; see also Rufo, 502 U.S. at 381, 112 S.Ct. 748; Frew, 540 U.S. at 441, 124\nS.Ct. 899. \"A flexible approach allows courts to ensure that `responsibility for discharging the State's obligations\nis returned promptly to the State and its officials' when the circumstances warrant.\" Horne, 129 S.Ct. at 2595\n(quoting Frew, 540 U.S. at 442, 124 S.Ct. 899). \"If the State establishes reason to modify the decree, the court\nshould make the necessary changes; where it has not done so, however, the decree should be enforced\naccording to its terms.\" Frew, 540 U.S. at 442, 124 S.Ct. 899. Relief is warranted if the significant change\n\"renders continued enforcement `detrimental to the public interest.'\" Horne, 129 S.Ct. at 2593 (quoting Rufo, 502\nU.S. at 384, 112 S.Ct. 748).\nDefendants contend that there has been both a significant change in law and a significant change in factual\nconditions and that these changes satisfy Horne's requirements for vacatur. Defendants could, of course, obtain\n\nvacatur by complying with the court orders. However, they concede they have not achieved compliance.\n149 (12/17/09 Tr. at 20-21.) Nonetheless, they argue that the objects of the court orders *149 have been attained\nbecause (1) the scope of the right to habilitation recognized in the 1978 Consent Order and the many subsequent\nconsent orders is premised on an incorrect understanding of the law, as established by the Supreme Court's\n1982 decision in Youngberg and, therefore, those parts of the consent orders that are dependent on that\ndefinition are \"extraconstitutional,\" (i.e., not based on any constitutional violation) and thus are legally\nunenforceable; and (2) the remaining parts of the 1978 Consent Order and subsequent consent orders impose\nrequirements that exceed minimal constitutional standards, and thus, under Horne, defendants are entitled to\nvacatur once they achieve the minimum, which they claim to have done.\nDefendants' argument for vacatur fails because (1) Youngberg does not represent a significant change in law\n(Section I(A)); (2) even if Youngberg constituted a significant change, defendants failed to make that argument\nwithin a reasonable time after Youngberg was decided (Section I(B)); (3) no matter how Youngberg is interpreted,\nit can only support a limited modification of the consent orders (Section I(C)); (4) defendants have misinterpreted \nHorne when arguing that the objectives of the consent decrees have been met because they have satisfied the\nconstitutional floor (Section II(A)); and (5) defendants have failed to establish that a durable remedy is in place\n(Section II(B)).\nI. DEFENDANTS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO VACATUR BASED ON A\nCHANGE IN LAW\nA. Youngberg Was Not a Significant Change in Law\nAccording to defendants, Youngberg was a significant change in law because \"[i]n its 1978 Consent Order, this\nCourt adopted a much more expansive definition of the Fifth Amendment right to habilitative care and treatment\"\nthan Youngberg recognizes or permits. (Defs.' Mem. at 16 n. 13.) Specifically, defendants take issue with the\nportions of the 1978 Consent Order, to which they agreed, emphasized below:\nEach class member has a federal constitutional right, based upon the Due Process Clause of the\nFifth Amendment, to receive habilitative care and treatment in the alternative least restrictive of\nindividual liberty and to be kept free from harm.\nHabilitation is the process by which a resident is assisted in acquiring and maintaining those life\nskills which enable him to cope more effectively with the demands of his own person and of his\nenvironment and to raise the level of his physical, mental, and social capabilities. Habilitation\nincludes but is not limited to[] programs of formal, structured education and training.\nHabilitative care in the alternative least restrictive of individual liberty means living as normally as\npossible and receiving appropriate individualized services in the community in the least separate,\nmost integrated and least restrictive settings.\nAs used in this Order, \"integrated\" refers to the integration of mentally retarded persons with\nnonretarded persons in the community.\n(Id. (quoting 1978 Consent Order at 2 ¶ 3) (emphases added).) According to defendants, \"[t]he portions of this\ndefinition emphasized above are not required by the Fifth Amendment's due process clause but, rather, reach far\nbeyond any constitutionally guaranteed minimum.\" (Id. at 16-17 n. 13) Defendants maintain, for the first time in\nover 30 years, that they \"cannot now be bound by their three-decades-old consent to the use of an overly\n150 expansive, *150 erroneous definition.\" (Id.) Rather, they argue, \"this Court should disregard the 1978 Consent\nOrder's incorrect statement of the applicable standard and implement the correct standard, which the District has\nmore than satisfied.\" (Id. at 17 n. 13.)\nIt is well-established that a Court can modify or vacate a consent decree based on a significant change in law. In\nmany cases where this type of argument has been raised, it is undisputed that the law has in fact changed, that a\n\nlegal basis for the decree has evaporated, and the only question for the Court is whether the change in the legal\nlandscape warrants modification (or vacatur) of the decree. See, e.g., Sys. Fed'n No. 91, Ry. Employees' Dep't,\nAFL-CIO v. Wright, 364 U.S. 642, 652, 81 S.Ct. 368, 5 L.Ed.2d 349 (1961) (\"The parties have no power to require\nof the court continuing enforcement of rights the statute no longer gives.\"); Sweeton v. Brown, 27 F.3d 1162,\n1164-65 (6th Cir. 1994) (en banc) (dissolving injunction pertaining to state parole procedures where subsequent\ncontrolling caselaw established that there was no federal due process interest at stake and thus that the \"legal\ntheory and analysis upon which the consent decree was formulated was erroneous\"); Evans v. City of Chicago,\n10 F.3d 474, 480 (7th Cir.1993) (en banc) (vacating consent decree because its \"continued enforcement\" was\n\"inequitable\" where the underlying \"substantial claim\" under federal law had evaporated); Doe v. Briley, 511\nF.Supp.2d 904, 923-26 (M.D.Tenn. 2007) (dissolving consent decree precluding publication of names of persons\narrested but not convicted due to Supreme Court decision holding that due process did not protect against\nstigmatizing publications by law enforcement officials), aff'd,562 F.3d 777 (6th Cir.2009).\nHere, however, the first question for the Court is whether there has in fact been a significant change in the law. \nSee, e.g., United States v. Rueth Dev. Co., 335 F.3d 598, 604 (7th Cir.2003) (refusing to modify or vacate\nconsent decree where Supreme Court decision \"did not expressly make [the relevant regulation] illegal\" even\nthough that \"reading might be the only logical extension of the case\"); see also Rufo, 502 U.S. at 389, 112 S.Ct.\n748 (\"To hold that a clarification in the law automatically opens the door for relitigation of the merits of every\naffected consent decree would undermine the finality of such agreements and could serve as a disincentive to\nnegotiation of settlements in institutional reform litigation.\") That is, does the 1978 Consent Order, in defendants'\nwords, use \"an overly expansive, erroneous definition\" of the right to habilitative care and treatment. (Defs.' Mot.\nat 14 n. 2.) As explained herein, the answer to this question is simply that defendants cannot argue for vacatur\nbased on a significant change in the law.\n1. Youngberg\nIn Youngberg, the Supreme Court considered \"for the first time the substantive rights of involuntarily committed\nmentally retarded persons under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.\" 457 U.S. at 314, 102 S.Ct.\n2452. The plaintiff in Youngberg, Nicholas Romeo, had been involuntarily committed under the laws of\nPennsylvania to a state institution. As described in the Supreme Court's decision, he was \"profoundly retarded,\"\nwith \"the mental capacity of an 18-month old child, with an I.Q. between 8 and 10,\" who could not \"talk and lack\n[ed] the most basic self-care skills.\" Id. at 309, 102 S.Ct. 2452. He had been committed to a state facility at the\nage of 26 because his mother could no longer care for him after his father's death. After he suffered a number of\n151 injuries, both self-inflicted and from other residents, his mother filed a complaint in *151 federal district court. The\nprecise question before the Supreme Court was whether a person involuntarily committed to a state institution for\nthe mentally retarded had \"substantive rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to (I)\n[25]\nsafe conditions of confinement; (ii) freedom from bodily restraints; and (iii) training, or `habilitation.'\" Id. at 309,\n102 S.Ct. 2452.\nBased on its prior decisions, the Court concluded, without the need for explication, that the plaintiff's right to safe\nconditions and right to freedom from bodily restraint were the \"core of the liberty protected by the Due Process\nClause,\" noting that since both rights survived criminal conviction and incarceration, they certainly survived\ninvoluntary commitment. Id. at 315-16, 102 S.Ct. 2452 (quotations omitted). As for the right to habilitation, the\nCourt had never before considered whether such a right existed or what its scope might be. Ultimately, it held that\nplaintiff had a right to the habilitation he sought00a right to \"minimally adequate or reasonable training to ensure\n97\nsafety and freedom from undue restraint.\" Id. at 319, 102 S.Ct. 2452. In reaching this conclusion, the Court noted\nthat because the plaintiff \"seeks only training related to safety and freedom from restraints, this case does not\npresent the difficult question whether a mentally retarded person, involuntarily committed to a state institution,\nhas some general constitutional right to training per se, even when no type or amount of training would lead to\nfreedom.\" Id. at 318, 102 S.Ct. 2452 (emphasis added). In a footnote, the Court added:\nIt is not feasible, as is evident from the variety of language and formulations in the opinions below\nand the various briefs here, to define or identify the type of training that may be required in every\ncase. A court properly may start with the generalization that there is a right to minimally adequate\n\ntraining. The basic requirement of adequacy, in terms more familiar to courts, may be stated as\nthat training which is reasonable in light of identifiable liberty interests and the circumstances of\nthe case.\nId. at 319 n. 25, 102 S.Ct. 2452.\nHaving concluded that the plaintiff in Youngberg retained liberty interests in safety, freedom from bodily restraint,\nand minimally adequate habilitation, the Court addressed the question of how a court should identify possible\nviolations of those rights. It held that whether Romeo's rights had been violated \"must be determined by\nbalancing his liberty interests against the relevant state interests,\" but that this balancing \"cannot be left to the\nunguided discretion of a judge or jury.\" Id. at 321, 102 S.Ct. 2452. Rather, \"the proper standard for determining\nwhether a State adequately has protected the rights of the involuntarily committed mentally retarded\" is for a\ncourt to \"make certain that professional judgment was in fact exercised.\" Id. (quotations omitted). Thus, the Court\nconcluded, \"the State [was] under a duty to provide respondent with such training as an appropriate professional\n152 would consider reasonable to ensure his safety and to facilitate his ability *152 to function free from bodily\nrestraints.\" Id. at 324, 102 S.Ct. 2452.\nIn a concurring opinion, Justice Blackmun, joined by Justices Brennan and O'Connor, noted that the majority\nopinion \"properly leaves unresolved\" \"whether respondent has an independent constitutional claim, grounded in\nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to that `habilitation' or training necessary to preserve\nthose basic self-care skills he possessed when he first entered\" the state institution. Id. at 325, 327, 102 S.Ct.\n2452. Justice Blackmun opined that \"it would be consistent with the Court's reasoning today to include within the\nminimally adequate training required by the Constitution such training as is reasonably necessary to prevent a\nperson's pre-existing self-care skills from deteriorating because of his commitment.\" Id. at 327, 102 S.Ct. 2452\n(quotation and citation omitted). As explained by Justice Blackmun,\nIf a person could demonstrate that he entered a state institution with minimal self-care skills, but\nlost those skills after commitment because of the State's unreasonable refusal to provide him\ntraining, then, it seems to me, he has alleged a loss of liberty quite distinct from00and as serious\n97\nas00the loss of safety and freedom from unreasonable restraints. For many mentally retarded\n97\npeople, the difference between the capacity to do things for themselves within an institution and\ntotal dependence on the institution for all of their needs is as much liberty as they ever will know.\nId. at 327, 102 S.Ct. 2452.\nThus, contrary to defendants' suggestion, there is absolutely nothing in the Supreme Court's decision in \nYoungberg that overrules the 1978 Consent Order and the subsequent orders that were entered both before and\nafter Youngberg regarding plaintiffs' constitutional right \"to receive habilitative care and treatment in the\nalternative least restrictive of individual liberty\" or the definition of what that right means. Indeed, the Court in \nYoungberg expressly stated that it was not answering the \"difficult question whether a mentally retarded person,\ninvoluntarily committed to a state institution, has some general constitutional right to training per se.\" Id. at 318,\n102 S.Ct. 2452.\n2. Post-Youngberg Cases\nIn the almost 30 years since Youngberg was decided, the Supreme Court has not revisited the daunting task of\nexplicating the constitutional rights of the involuntarily-committed developmentally disabled, and the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has not had the occasion to ever address this issue.\nThus, there is no controlling precedent, other than Youngberg, and there is no consensus among the courts\nregarding defendants' proposed interpretation of Youngberg. On the contrary, courts and judges have reached\ndiffering conclusions about Youngberg's scope.\nFor example, in Clark v. Cohen, 794 F.2d 79 (3d Cir.1986), the court held that plaintiff's rights were violated where\nshe was confined at an institution \"in the face of unanimous professional opinion that she should be placed in a\nfar less restrictive environment....\" Id. at 87. In a concurring opinion, Judge Edward Becker elaborated on his\n\n[26]\nview of the scope of the constitutional right to habilitation,  which he believed Youngberg did not address. See\n153 id. at 92-98 (Becker, J., concurring). In his view, \"Youngberg dealt exclusively *153 with training related to\nphysical restraints; the Court expressly stated that it was neither considering nor ruling on any broader right to\nhabilitation.\" Id. at 95. Citing Justice Blackmun's concurrence in Youngberg, Judge Becker stated that he also\n\"would endorse the non-deterioration principle,\" because \"[t]he mentally disabled cannot have meaningful\nautonomy, and hence meaningful liberty, without basic skills; therefore, for the state to allow disabled persons'\nskills to deteriorate is as sure a denial of their liberty as is their confinement to an institution.\" Id. at 96. He then\nwent further than Justice Blackmun, endorsing what he called a \"[m]odified non-deterioration principle\":\nthe State should be required to provide such a person with at least as much training as would\nmatch the improvement that he or she would have experienced if never committed. The reasoning\nbehind this position is analogous to the reasoning supporting the non-deterioration principle: by\ncommitting people and preventing them from developing self-care skills, the state is effectively\ndepriving them of the opportunity to develop and exercise their autonomy. This is a deprivation of\ntheir due process right to liberty.... [Thus,] involuntarily civilly committed persons have a right to\ntreatment sufficient to develop their self-care skills to at least the level at which they would be if\nthe persons had not been institutionalized.\n794 F.2d at 96. As he explained:\nBecause [the plaintiff's] institutionalization has led to her debilitation, the modified non-\ndeterioration principle requires the state to provide [her] ... with training and treatment sufficient to\nput her in the position in which she would have been had she never been institutionalized.\nBecause it appears from the numerous, uncontradicted doctors' reports in the record that\nplacement in a [community living arrangement] is the only or best way for [her] to receive the\ntraining she is due, I believe she has a right to placement in the [community living arrangement],\nuntil she has acquired the skills she would have had had she never been institutionalized.\nId. at 97. Finally, and significantly, Judge Becker's opinion left open \"the question whether the involuntarily civilly\ncommitted have a right to even greater habilitation than the modified non-deterioration principle would allow.\" Id.\nat 98. For example, as noted in the concurring opinion,\n[i]t might be argued ... under the theories discussed here or some other theory of habilitation, that\nthe involuntarily civilly committed have a right to as much habilitation as their capacity will allow.\nAlternatively, one might argue that all involuntarily civilly committed persons are entitled to\ntreatment up to an absolute level, regardless of their status upon entrance to the institution.\nId. at 98 (emphasis added). Thus, according to this circuit judge, Youngberg is merely the starting point for\ndefining the constitutional right to habilitation; it by no means precludes recognition of additional rights for\nplaintiffs who, unlike the plaintiff in Youngberg, could benefit from more extensive habilitation.\nThe court's decision in Thomas S. v. Flaherty, 699 F.Supp. 1178, 1184 (W.D.N.C.1988),aff'd,902 F.2d 250 (4th\nCir.1990), is another example of a post-Youngberg case that endorses a broader right to habilitation than\n154 defendants advocate here.[27] In Thomas S., the court held *154 that the State of North Carolina was violating\nthe constitutional rights of approximately four hundred mentally retarded persons who were confined in the state's\nfour psychiatric hospitals. The court approved the parties' agreement that in terms of habilitation, \"minimum\nprofessional standards require developmentally oriented habilitation for persons with mental retardation.\" Id. at\n1192. Such developmental habilitation requires, inter alia; \"[a]dequate involvement in community activities,\"\ndefined as \"being as involved as that individual is capable of being at the time\"; \"a good interdisciplinary\nevaluation\" that provides an \"adequate assessment of the individual needs of each class member\"; \"[p]roperly\ntrained staff\"; \"[h]umane living conditions,\" which includes more than \"endless days of boredom without variation\";\n\"treat[ment] in as normal a setting as possible\" featuring \"access to ordinary activities,\" and the chance \"to learn\nand grow through observing and participating in the commonplace events of daily life,\" \"developmental training\nand structured programs,\" including \"training in basic self-care skills, community living skills, speech therapy, and\nvocational services.\" Id. at 1192-94. The court also found that \"[b]ecause vocational activities are often a key to\n\ngreater independence and enjoyment of liberty, they are for most class members an essential service to avoid\nunnecessary restraint.\" Id. at 1194. The court relied on its finding that there was \"professional consensus that\ndevelopmental, behavior-based treatment called `habilitation' is the appropriate milieu for people with mental\nretardation.\" Id. at 1185. Finally, the court found that habilitation \"is defined as ... [t]he process by which the staff\nof an agency assists an individual to acquire and maintain those life skills that enable the individual to cope more\neffectively with the demands of his or her own person and environmental and social functioning. Habilitation\nincludes, but is not limited to, programs of formal structured education and treatment.\" Id. at 1184 (quoting\nAccreditation Council for Services for Mentally Retarded and Other Developmentally Disabled Persons (1981 ed.)\n(quotation and citation omitted)). Not only did the court recognize a broad right to habilitation, it emphasized that\nplaintiffs were entitled both to appropriate professional decisionmaking and implementation of those decisions. \nSee id. at 1185 (faulting defendants for not implementing community placement recommendations by treating\nprofessionals and noting that \"[t]he record is replete with other examples of placement and treatment\n[28]\nrecommendations being ignored or their implementation being unjustifiably delayed\").\nCertainly there are cases in which courts applying Youngberg have defined the right to habilitation more narrowly\nthan the Court and the parties did in the 1978 Consent Order. For example, in Society for Good Will to Retarded\nChildren, Inc. v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239 (2d Cir.1984), the Second Circuit held that the right to freedom from\nundue restraint included the right to be free from \"excess locking of doors, locking of otherwise ambulatory\n155 persons into wheelchairs, and failing to put on leg braces for individuals who can walk *155 with their assistance,\"\nbut it did not include \"visiting shops, restaurants and recreational facilities in the outside community.\" Id. at 1247.\nIt also held that there was no \"entitlement to community placement or a `least restrictive environment' under the\nfederal Constitution,\" and that \"[w]here the state does not provide treatment designed to improve a mentally\nretarded individual's condition, it deprives the individual of nothing guaranteed by the Constitution; it simply fails\nto grant a benefit of optimum treatment that it is under no constitutional obligation to grant.\" Id. at 1250; see also \nLelsz v. Kavanagh, 807 F.2d 1243, 1250-51 (5th Cir.1987) (no \"right to habilitation in the least restrictive\nenvironment\" because \"[t]he constitutional minimum standard of habilitation ... relate[s], not to the qualitative\nbetterment of a retarded person's life, but only to the training necessary to afford him safety and freedom from\nbodily restraint\"); Phillips v. Thompson, 715 F.2d 365, 368 (7th Cir.1983) (\"With respect to training, Youngberg\nteaches that, at the most, the class members were entitled to minimally adequate training as is reasonable in light\nof their interest in freedom of movement and that deference must be shown to the professional judgment of those\ndirecting the operation of the institution. Such training as is required, therefore, is training to enhance the ability of\nthe class members to exercise their right to liberty of movement.\"); Jackson v. Fort Stanton Hosp. & Training\nSch., 757 F.Supp. 1243, 1309 (D.N.M.1990) (\"no substantive due process right to habilitation in the least\nrestrictive environment and there is no constitutional right to placement in a community setting\"), rev'd in part,\n964 F.2d 980 (10th Cir.1992); S.H. v. Edwards, 886 F.2d 292 (11th Cir.1989) (affirming district court's denial of\n\"plaintiffs' claims for relief in the nature of habilitation in the least restrictive environment in accordance with the\nrecommendation of professional treatment staff\" (quotation omitted)).\nAnd then there are cases that fall somewhere in between. For example, in Association for Retarded Citizens of\nNorth Dakota v. Olson, 561 F.Supp. 473 (N.D.1982),aff'd,713 F.2d 1384 (8th Cir.1983), the court held that\nthe right to freedom from undue restraint... imposes a standard for the court's determination\nwhether professional judgment is being exercised in the use of medication and physical means to\nrestrain residents. This right obligates the state to provide capable retarded residents with\nreasonable opportunities to make trips into the outside communities. It also tests the freedoms\nallowed to residents, such as the opportunity to make small personal decisions concerning what to\nwear, what to eat, recreation, etc. This right against unreasonable restraint also involves the much\ndiscussed question of alternatives to institutionalization, such as community homes. Prior to the \nYoungberg decision, this court held that the [F]ourteenth [A]mendment secures a right to the least\nrestrictive practicable alternatives to institutionalization. While the Youngberg decision does not\ndirectly address this specific right, the Court's analysis indicates that it would reject an absolute\nright to the least restrictive alternatives.... Following this analysis, this court must conclude that a\nconstitutional right to the least restrictive method of care or treatment exists only insofar as\n\nprofessional judgment determines that such alternatives would measurably enhance the resident's\nenjoyment of basic liberty interests.\nId. at 486 (emphasis added; citation omitted). As for \"the right to minimally adequate training,\" the court held that\n156 \"the *156 resident possesses a right to training only insofar as that training serves to enhance or further that\nresident's exercise of basic liberty.\" Id. at 486-87. Thus, it does not include \"training in music or vocational skills,\"\nbut it does include \"training in walking or basic communication ... if the resident could benefit therefrom....\" Id. at\n487. It also includes \"a right to reasonable training which enables the resident to acquire or maintain minimum\nself-care skills00skills in feeding, bathing, dressing, self-control, and toilet training.\" Id. (emphasis omitted). The\n97\ncourt also adopted Justice Blackmun's view that the right to training includes training \"to enable them to maintain\nthe minimum self-care skills that they possessed when they entered the institution,\" and based on this view, it\nheld that the \"the acquisition and maintenance of those skills [are] essential to the exercise of basic liberties.\" Id.\nat 487 (emphasis added).\nAccordingly, all that can be said about the post-Youngberg cases, none of which is controlling precedent, is that\nthey disagree about how narrowly Youngberg should be interpreted and even if interpreted narrowly, how it\nshould be applied to everyday situations. This very lack of clarity dooms defendants' suggestion that Youngberg\nprecludes recognition of a constitutional right to habilitation as described in the 1978 Consent Order.\nIn the end, the critical question in a Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry is whether defendants have met their burden to show\nthat Youngberg was a \"significant change\" in the law. They have not. There is language in Youngberg that\narguably contradicts defendants' reading of the case; there is no subsequent Supreme Court decision or post-\nYoungberg decision from our circuit court regarding the meaning of Youngberg; and among those that have\naddressed it, there is no agreement. In the face of disagreement about what the law is and no controlling\nprecedent, the mere fact that some courts have adopted the interpretation defendants propose here is not\nsufficient to meet that burden. Moreover, as explained herein, defendants' position that Youngberg is a significant\nchange in law is seriously undermined by the fact that for almost 28 years they have accepted the constitutional\nstandard in the 1978 Consent Order and promised to achieve compliance with court orders based on that\nstandard.\nB. Defendants' Argument Regarding Youngberg Was Not Made Within\na Reasonable Time\nDefendants concede that if Youngberg is not treated as a significant change in law, their motion to vacate must\n[29]\nfail.  But even if the Court agreed with defendants that Youngberg represented a significant change in the law,\n[30]\nthat does not ensure success under Rule 60(b)(5). See Rufo, 502 U.S. at 384, 112 S.Ct. 748. It remains for\nthe Court to decide whether modification in light of that change is warranted. See id. at 391, 112 S.Ct. 748. Given\n157 the particular (and probably unique) *157 facts of this case, the Court does not believe that the relief sought by\ndefendants is warranted.\nRule 60(b)(5) requires that a motion for modification be made within \"a reasonable time.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5).\n\"[W]hat constitutes `reasonable time' for a filing under Rule 60(b) depends on the facts of each case.\" Ingram v.\nMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 371 F.3d 950, 952 (7th Cir.2004); see also McCorvey v. Hill, 385 F.3d\n846, 849 n. 4 (5th Cir.2004); Fed. Land Bank of St. Louis v. Cupples Bros., 889 F.2d 764, 767 (8th Cir.1989).\nFactors to consider include \"the length of the delay, the explanations for the delay, the prejudice to the opposing\nparty caused by the delay and the circumstances warranting relief.\" Associated Builders & Contractors v. Mich.\nDep't of Labor, 543 F.3d 275 (6th Cir.2008); see also Shakman v. City of Chicago, 426 F.3d 925 (7th Cir.2005)\n(relevant factors include \"the litigants' knowledge of the grounds for relief,\" \"the interest in finality, the reason for\ndelay, the practical ability of the litigant to learn earlier of the grounds relied upon, and [the consideration of]\nprejudice [if any] to other parties\" (quotations omitted)). Even applying the flexible approach a court must take in\nconsidering a Rule 60(b)(5) motion in institutional reform litigation, see Horne, 129 S.Ct. at 2594-95; Rufo, 502\nU.S. at 381, 112 S.Ct. 748, defendants' Youngberg argument comes decades too late, long after the entry of\n\ncountless remedial court orders, many of which defendant agreed to and all of which were relied upon these\nmany years by the Court, the Special Masters, the plaintiffs and the Department of Justice.\nThe Supreme Court decided Youngberg in 1982, almost 30 years ago. Defendants could have sought\nmodification of the 1978 Consent Order at any time thereafter based on the same argument they make\ntoday00that Youngberg effectively overruled parts of this Court's 1978 consent decree, thereby requiring\n97\nmodification of that decree. And if there was any question that a change in law could provide the basis for\nmodification of a consent decree, that question was answered in 1992 by Rufo, 502 U.S. at 393, 112 S.Ct. 748.\nIndeed, there have been a number of cases in the intervening years, which defendants rely upon, where parties\nhave sought and courts have agreed that modifications or vacatur based on a change in law was appropriate. \n[31]\nSee, e.g., Sweeton, 27 F.3d at 1164-65; Evans, 10 F.3d at 480, 482-83; Briley, 511 F.Supp.2d at 927.\nNor is this a case where defendants can justify the delay by claiming that they were \"unaware\" of the existence of\nthe decree or its impact. Cf. Briley, 511 F.Supp.2d at 912 (\"Municipal entities, ... however, do not have perfect\ninstitutional memory, and where a consent decree has gone unenforced for many years, the individuals who\nadminister those entities may not have any knowledge of its existence.\"). To the contrary, defendants have been\nin Court continually and repeatedly since the 1978 Consent Order defending against plaintiffs' charges of\n[32]\nnoncompliance, and when their efforts failed for good reason, numerous substantive court orders resulted.\n158 *158 The only reason defendants give for their 27-year delay in making their Youngberg argument is that they\nonly just realized that the 1978 Consent Order was based on a \"misunderstanding of the governing law.\" (See\n12/17/09 Tr. at 8.) Even assuming such a \"mistake\" could ever justify a delay of this magnitude, it does not do so\nhere. Defendants cannot make a plausible argument that they, along with everyone else involved in this case,\nhave been operating under a misguided view of the law and only now, with the arrival of a new Attorney General,\nhas the law become clear. (See 12/17/09 Tr. at 19.) Not only did it take 27 years for defendants to realize their\npurported mistake, during that period, they entered into a number of additional consent orders and agreements\nthat were designed to achieve the constitutional standards enunciated in the 1978 Consent Order. (See 1983\nConsent Order; 1995 Reference Order; 2001 Joint Findings of Fact; 2001 Plan; 2001 Consent Order; 2007 90-\nDay Consent Order.) For example, in 1995 defendants \"admit[ted] that the District has a continuing responsibility\nto provide the class members with habilitation in accordance with their needs\" and \"admit[ted] that they also are\nrequired to provide adequate medical care, psychological care, day programming, community residential\nplacements and other support systems as set forth in the class members' [individual habilitation plans].\" (1995\nContempt Order at 5-6.) And as recently as September 2007, the current administration under Mayor Fenty\nagreed to take a number of specific actions, including \"recruiting five new providers\" and ensuring that the\nresidences operated by these providers, inter alia, \"are located close to shops, restaurants, community resources\nand public transportation, or there is transportation available to class members in order to access these\nresources\"00 an obligation that clearly flows from the parts of the 1978 Consent Order the District now contends\n97\nare \"extraconstitutional.\" (2007 90-Day Order at 2.) Moreover, the Court's March 2007 Liability Opinion and the\n2009 Special Masters' Report are replete with references to a legal standard that only now does the District find\nconvenient to repudiate. \"Modification of a consent decree may be warranted when changed factual conditions\nmake compliance with the decree substantially more onerous,\" Rufo, 502 U.S. at 384, 112 S.Ct. 748, but not\nsimply because \"it is no longer convenient to live with the terms of a consent decree.\" Id. at 383, 112 S.Ct. 748.\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, defendants' actions over the past 30 years00their repeated representations,\n97\npromises and agreements00have led the Court and the plaintiffs to believe that defendants had every intention of\n97\ncomplying with the existing orders. For example, in asking the Court in February 2007 to delay its liability ruling,\nthe District stated that it was \"cognizant that much remains to be done to bring DDS into compliance with\noutstanding court orders and the 2001 Plan,\" but assured the Court that the \"Fenty Administration is fully\ncommitted to the success of the new agency, the delivery of improved services and care to the consumers served\nby the agency, and compliance with the 2001 Plan.\" (Defs.' Notice of Filing of Supplemental Info. in Resp. to the\nCourt Monitor's Quarterly Report at 8, Feb. 5, 2007 (emphasis added).) Again, in May 2008, Peter Nickles, the\n159 Attorney General for the District, assured the Court \"I am not seeking ... to *159 take away what [the plaintiffs]\nwon.\" (Hr'g Tr. at 37, May 15, 2008.) But that is exactly what the District seeks to do.\n\nEveryone, including the three judges of this Court, who has struggled with this case for over 30 years has relied\non defendants' repeated promises that they intended to comply. Plaintiffs have repeatedly entered into new\nagreements with defendants. (See, e.g., 1981 Consent Decree, 1983 Consent Decree; 2001 Consent Order;\n2001 Plan; 2007 90-Day Consent Order.) Plaintiff have also withdrawn motions to find defendants in\nnoncompliance or in contempt that they might otherwise have successfully pursued. (See, e.g., 1983 Consent\nOrder at 14 (withdrawing motion for contempt); Evans, 139 F.Supp.2d at 84 (waiving \"all claims for past\ncontumacious conduct of defendants as of the date of the entry of the [2001] Consent Order and approval of the\nSettlement Agreement\").)\nMoreover, the Court has on numerous occasions endorsed agreements between the parties and adopted them\nas court orders. (See, e.g., 1981 Consent Decree, 1983 Consent Decree; 2001 Consent Order; 2001 Plan; 2001\nJoint Findings of Fact; 2007 90-Day Order.) Judge Stanley Harris's reliance on defendants' stated intention to\nachieve compliance with existing court orders is especially apparent in his 2001 opinion, wherein he notes that\n\"[t]he dispute seemed intractable until last year, towards the end of which there were commendable and\nextensive efforts by Mrs. Farrell, Mr. Sundram, and counsel for the parties seeking to resolve the problems faced\nby all.\" Evans, 139 F.Supp.2d at 85. The Court commended the Special Masters and counsel not only for\n\"resolving their differences, but for the exceptionally thorough manner in which they have agreed upon\nprocedures for dealing with the problems that have persisted for so long\" and explained that it approved the Plan\nand adopted the parties' consent order and settlement agreement because it \"readily conclude[d] that the\nproposed compromise of the controversy, which will be of substantially greater benefit to the class than would\ncontinued litigation over how to deal with past conduct by defendants, is fair, reasonable, and adequate.\" Id.; (see\nalso 1995 Contempt Order at 1 (emphasizing that \"[a]n integral part of this litigation has been the closure of\nForest Haven and the relocation of class members to community living arrangements with adequate habilitation\nsuitable to each class member\" and \"[t]o this end, the Court has entered numerous orders, including consent\norders between the parties, to safeguard the rights of class members and ensure their adequate and appropriate\nhabilitation.\").)\nIn sum, no factor supports a finding that defendants have filed their Rule 60(b)(5) motion, to the extent it is based \nYoungberg, within a \"reasonable time.\" Defendants have no excuse for their delay; they have repeatedly\nconsented to the constitutional standard as stated in the 1978 Consent Order; they successfully convinced the\nplaintiffs and the Court on numerous occasions that they intended to comply with the court orders; and the\nvulnerable class members, their counsel, the Department of Justice and three judges of this Court have relied to\ntheir detriment on the District's endless promises.\nC. At Most, Defendants' View of Youngberg Supports Only a Limited\nModification of the Consent Orders\nEven if defendants could argue that Youngberg was a significant change in the law (which they cannot), that\nargument would support nothing more than a limited modification of the consent orders. In the first place, even if \n160 Youngberg changed the *160 law with respect to the scope of the constitutional right to habilitation, that would\nnot undermine the legal basis for the host of provisions in the court orders and the 2001 Plan that relate solely to\nhealth care and safety. See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315-16, 102 S.Ct. 2452 (not disputed that plaintiff had \"a\nright to adequate food, shelter, clothing, and medical care\" and Court held that right to safe conditions and right to\nfreedom from bodily restraint were the \"core of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause\"). Requirements\nrelating to these rights (as opposed to habilitation) are a substantial part of the challenged court orders and the\n2001 Plan. (See 1978 Consent Order; Evans, 459 F.Supp. at 484, 488-89; 1981 Consent Order at 6-7; 1983\nConsent Order at 4-8; 2001 Consent Order; 2001 Plan; 2007 90-Day Consent Order.) Moreover, these provisions\nare arguably the most critical and cover areas where defendants have been most deficient. Certainly, in recent\nyears, health and safety have been the primary focus and concern of the Court, the Special Masters, the Court\nMonitor and the parties. See Evans, 480 F.Supp.2d at 298-314 (factual findings in March 2007 Liability Opinion\nregarding health and safety); (2007 90-Day Order (addressing two critical goals: increasing the number of\nqualified providers and improving the health and safety of class members); 2009 Special Masters' Report at\n18-67 (findings and conclusions of law regarding health care, mental and behavioral health care, guardianship,\n\nsafety and protection from harm); Court Monitor's Report, June 11, 2009; and Court Monitor's Report, Dec. 10,\n2009.)\nFor example, according to the 2001 Plan, the crux of plaintiffs' right to be kept free from harm is addressed by six\nspecific directives in the 1978 Consent Order and the 1983 Consent Order. (2001 Plan at 27-28). These\ndirectives\nrequire conducting timely and thorough investigations into serious incidents, including deaths;\nidentifying causes and contributory factors as well as preventive and corrective actions that\nappear to be warranted; and ensuring the implementation of recommendations that are made as a\nresult of the investigations. In addition to responding to individual cases, the defendants are\nrequired to identify systemic patterns and trends and communicate them to providers to facilitate\ncorrective action for recurrent problems on an individual consumer level, provider level and a\nsystemic level .... [and to] ensure that appropriate training programs for all staff, including staff\nassigned to residential settings are developed and implemented.\n(2009 Special Masters' Report at 50.) In March 2007, this Court found \"defendants ha[d] failed in many significant\nrespects to accomplish the tasks and outcome criteria associated with the Court's Orders relating to class\nmember safety and to comply with the terms of the Orders themselves.\" Evans, 480 F.Supp.2d at 313. In late\nNovember 2007, defendants conceded that as of yet, conditions had not fundamentally changed. (Def.'s Notice\nConcerning Proposed Comprehensive Monitoring at 2.) And, as of December 2008, the Special Masters found\nthat \"there is clear and convincing evidence that the problems being experienced by class members in the area\nof safety and protection from harm are continuing, serious and systemic.\" (2009 Special Masters' Report at 67).\nThus, no matter how Youngberg is interpreted, it would not excuse defendants from these obligations.\nMoreover, even if defendants' overly narrow interpretation of Youngberg were to be adopted, it would only entitle\n161 defendants to partial modification of the court *161 orders concerning habilitation. For example, as the 2007\nLiability Opinion makes clear, the right to receive habilitative care and treatment in the alternative least restrictive\nof individual liberty, see Evans, 480 F.Supp.2d at 314-19, is only one aspect of plaintiffs' right to habilitation/\nwelfare. Plaintiffs are also entitled to \"a written ISP based upon individualized assessments and formulated in\naccordance with professional standards\"; \"an individualized habilitation program designed in accordance with the\nISP\"; identification in the ISP of \"all services and supports required by class members regardless of availability\";\nannual review of the ISP; \"adaptive equipment\" if needed; \"enough case manager positions to meet the required\ncase manager to client ratio\"; \"appropriate training programs for staff, including case managers\"; and case\nmanagers who ensure implementation of ISPs and take appropriate action after incidents. See id. at 319, 321-22;\n(see also 2009 Special Masters' Report at 67-75 (same)). Similarly, in the six-page, single-spaced 2007 90-Day\nConsent Order (which defendants agreed to after the Fenty administration took office), the only provision\narguably affected by Youngberg would be the requirement that defendants ensure that residences operated by\nnew providers \"are located close to shops, restaurants, community resources and public transportation, or there\nis transportation available to class members in order to access these resources.\" (2007 90-Day Consent Order at\n2.)\nFinally, one of defendants' primary points about Youngberg is that it rejects any right to community placement,\nbut the present record establishes that plaintiffs failed to prove that defendants are in noncompliance with the\n2001 Plan with respect to moving a significant number of class members into group homes. (See 2009 Special\n[33]\nMasters' Report at 72.)  For those class members who continue to reside in ICF/MR settings, the Report noted\nthat \"there was no evidence submitted to establish that continued placement of all or some subset of these class\nmembers in such settings was improper or contrary to a choice made by the class member or an authorized\nsurrogate decision-maker.\" (Id. at 73.)\nIn the end, then, defendants' argument that Youngberg changed the law on habilitation would, at most, require\npartial modification of a limited number of court orders concerning habilitation; it would not affect the legitimacy of\nany other order, including many critical orders, concerning plaintiffs' health, welfare and safety. But defendants do\n[34]\nnot seek such a limited modification; rather they make an \"all or nothing\" argument for vacatur.\n\n162  II. DEFENDANTS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO VACATUR BASED ON\n*162\nCHANGE IN FACTS\nA. Defendants Are Not in Substantial Compliance with Constitutional\nRequirements\nDefendants argue that, even though they have not achieved compliance with the court orders or the 2001 Plan,\nthe objects of those orders have been attained because defendants have satisfied the \"constitutional minimum.\"\n(Defs.' Mem. at 32 (\"District's current system for serving individuals with intellectual and developmental\ndisabilities ... patently satisfies class members' Fifth ... Amendment rights to be free from harm and to receive\nminimally adequate habilitative care and treatment.\").) Defendants' argument fails because (1) it rests on a\nflawed definition of the constitutional minimum; and (2) its rests on an erroneous interpretation of Horne as\nallowing properly entered consent orders to be vacated, despite defendants' non-compliance with those orders,\nonce defendants achieve the constitutional minimum.\n1. Defendants Cannot Provide a Workable Definition of Constitutional\nRequirements Based on Youngberg\nDefendants' argument that they have satisfied the \"constitutional minimum\" requires that that concept be defined,\nbut defendants' proffered definition is fundamentally flawed. According to defendants, Youngberg establishes as\nthe constitutional minimum that involuntarily committed individuals have only the right to be kept \"free from harm\"\nand the right to \"minimally adequate habilitation,\" defined as \"such training as may be reasonable in light of [the\nindividual's] liberty interests in safety and freedom from unreasonable restraints.\" (Def. Mot. to Vacate at 16\n(quotations omitted) (quoting Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 322, 102 S.Ct. 2452). Defendants then baldly assert that\nthey have met this constitutional minimum because \"[w]e're exercising professional judgment in the care and\ntreatment of consumers within the class. They're free from harm. And they're getting sufficient training and\nhabilitation so that their liberty interests are protected.\" (12/17/09 Tr. at 104.)\n163 Although the constitutional minimum certainly includes the rights articulated in *163Youngberg, defendants'\nargument that no more is required is premised on an error of law. First, as noted, Youngberg did not concern an\ninvoluntarily committed person's constitutional right to \"food, shelter, clothing, and medical care.\" Youngberg, 457\nU.S. at 315, 102 S.Ct. 2452. It is indisputable that any constitutional minimum standard must include protection of\n[35]\nthese rights.  Moreover, as these rights were not at issue in Youngberg, Youngberg provides no guidance as\nto what is required to meet the constitutional minimum with respect to the protection of these rights.\nIn addition, to the extent defendants contend that the constitutional minimum is met as long as there is a system\n[36]\nin place that calls for the exercise of professional judgment (see 12/17/09 Tr. at 103;  Defs.' Mem. at 33 (\"no\ncredible argument can be made that there is a systemic lack of professional judgment exercised by treating\nprofessionals in the IDD system\")), that proposition is not supported by Youngberg. Youngberg expressly states\nthat a court must \"make certain that professional judgment in fact was exercised\" in attempting to protect the\nrights of an involuntarily committed individual. 457 U.S. at 321, 102 S.Ct. 2452 (emphasis added) (quotation\nomitted). As other courts have recognized, in order for this requirement to have any substance, it cannot be met\npurely at the systemic level; rather, professional judgments must be implemented in a timely fashion. See, e.g., \nThomas S., 902 F.2d at 252 (holding that district court properly imposed liability because it \"found that many of\nthe decisions of the treating professionals had not been implemented\" and \"found areas in which the decisions of\nthe treating professional substantially departed from accepted standards\"); Halderman v. Pennhurst, 901 F.2d\n311, 324 (3d Cir.1990) (\"obligations [under the consent decree] clearly run to class members as individuals, not\nas a group\" and thus \"substantial compliance must be measured with respect to the services each individual\nretarded class member is receiving and not with respect to the services received by the class as a whole\").\n\nFinally, defendants again ignore, as discussed above, that Youngberg did not address the right to habilitation\ngenerally; it decided only that the plaintiff, who was profoundly retarded and would not benefit from any other\nhabilitation, was entitled to the limited habilitation he sought00such training as may be reasonable in light of his\n97\n164 liberty interests in safety and freedom from unreasonable restraints. See Youngberg,*164 457 U.S. at 318, 102\nS.Ct. 2452 (because plaintiff \"seeks only training related to safety and freedom from restraints, this case does not\npresent the difficult question whether a mentally retarded person, involuntarily committed to a state institution,\nhas some general constitutional right to training per se\" (emphasis added)). For all these reasons, the rights\nrecognized by Youngberg are necessary, but not sufficient, to give meaning to plaintiffs' basic constitutional\nrights.\n2. Even If Defendants Have Satisfied Minimum Constitutional\nRequirements, This Does Not Justify Vacatur Under Horne\nThe second problem for defendants is that they cannot seek vacatur of all court orders based on Horne. In \nHorne, the district court concluded, after a trial, that the State of Arizona was violating the requirement in the\nEqual Educational Opportunities Act (\"EEOA\") \"to take appropriate action to overcome language barriers that\nimpede equal participation by its students in its instructional programs,\" 20 U.S.C. § 1703(f), because \"the\namount of funding the State allocated for the special needs of ELL students ... was arbitrary and not related to the\nactual funding needed to cover the costs of ELL instruction.\" Horne, 129 S.Ct. at 2589. Pursuant to this judgment,\nthe court ordered the State, inter alia, to \"prepare a cost study to establish the proper appropriation to effectively\nimplement ELL programs,\" \"to provide funding that bears a rational relationship to the actual funding needed,\"\nand to \"appropriately and constitutionally fund\" the ELL program. Id. at 2590 (quotations and citations omitted).\nThe defendants never complied with any of the court's orders, but in 2006 the State Legislature passed a new\nlaw that \"increased ELL incremental funding [by a fixed amount] (with a 2-year per-student limit on such funding)\nand created two new funds00a structured English immersion fund and a compensatory instruction fund00to cover\n97 97\nadditional costs of ELL programming.\" Id. at 2590. Based on this new legislation, the state legislature asked the\ndistrict court to vacate its orders. The district court concluded that Rule 60(b)(5) relief was not warranted because\nthe new law \"did not establish a funding system that rationally relates funding available to the actual costs of all\nelements of ELL instruction.\" Id. at 2591 (quotations omitted). The Ninth Circuit affirmed, emphasizing that\nbecause the original declaratory judgment order centered on the adequacy of ELL incremental funding, relief\nwould be appropriate only if \"there are no longer incremental costs associated with ELL programs in Arizona,\" or\nif \"Arizona had altered its funding model.\" Id. at 2591-92 (quotations omitted).\nThe Supreme Court reversed and remanded, holding that the lower courts had erred by looking only to whether\nthe State was fulfilling the specific terms of the judgment instead of considering whether \"Arizona is now fulfilling\nits statutory obligation by new means that reflect new policy insights and other changed circumstances.\" Id. at\n2589. The Court remanded the case with instructions to consider \"whether the objective of the District Court's\n2000 declaratory judgment order00i.e. satisfaction of the EEOA's appropriate action standard00has been\n97 97\nachieved.\" Horne, 129 S.Ct. at 2595 (quotations omitted).\nUnder Horne and earlier Supreme Court decisions, a motion to vacate, such as defendants have filed here,\nrequires the Court to determine whether the \"objective\" of the court orders has been attained. Id.; Frew, 540 U.S.\n165 at 442, 124 S.Ct. 899 (\"The federal court must exercise its equitable *165 powers to ensure that when the objects\nof the decree have been attained, responsibility for discharging the State's obligations is returned promptly to the\nState and its officials.\"); see also LaShawn, 701 F.Supp.2d at 98, 2010 WL 1270202, at *11 (in addressing motion\nto vacate consent decree, \"it is appropriate to consider whether the objectives of the decree have been\nachieved\").\nDefendants attempt, nevertheless, to read Horne as a new rule of law that equates satisfying the constitutional\nminimum with attaining the objective of a consent decree. (See Defs.' Mem. at 18 (no ongoing constitutional\nviolations because the \"current IDD system administered by DDS/DDA ... not only satisfies but greatly surpasses\nthe minimum constitutional standards established by the Fifth Amendment.\"); 12/17/09 Tr. at 10-11, 13, 16, 42,\n\n48.) This Court cannot accept this exceedingly broad interpretation of Horne, for Horne cannot mean that when a\ndefendant agrees to a series of measures designed to remedy constitutional violations, these agreements are\nnecessarily unenforceable because the measures exceed some ill-defined constitutional floor.\nUnlike Horne, the present case involves a consent decree, not a litigated judgment. A consent decree \"`embodies\nan agreement of the parties' and is also `an agreement that the parties desire and expect will be reflected in, and\nbe enforceable as, a judicial decree that is subject to the rules generally applicable to other judgments and\ndecrees.'\" Frew, 540 U.S. at 437, 124 S.Ct. 899 (quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at 378, 112 S.Ct. 748). \"[A] federal\nconsent decree must spring from, and serve to resolve, a dispute within the court's subject-matter jurisdiction;\nmust come within the general scope of the case made by the pleadings; and must further the objectives of the\nlaw upon which the complaint was based.\" Id. (citing Firefighters, 478 U.S. at 525, 106 S.Ct. 3063). \"Consent\ndecrees entered in federal court must be directed to protecting federal interests.\" Id.; see also LaShawn, 701\nF.Supp.2d at 99-100, 2010 WL 1270202, at *13.\nThe decision in Horne was obviously motivated by the perceived dangers of long-term judicial involvement in\nlocal government institutions, noting that \"Rule 60(b)(5) serves a particularly important function in ... `institutional\nreform litigation'\" because \"injunctions issued in such cases often remain in force for many years, and the\npassage of time frequently brings about changed circumstances00 changes ... in governing law ... and new policy\n97\ninsights00that warrant reexamination of the original judgment.\" Horne, 129 S.Ct. at 2593. The Court in Horne also\n97\nnoted that \"institutional reform injunctions often raise sensitive federalism concerns,\" particularly where they\n\"involve[] areas of core state responsibility\" or \"ha[ve] the effect of dictating state or local budget priorities.\" Id. at\n2593-94. And in dicta it suggests that these problems are exacerbated in cases governed by consent decrees\nrather than litigated judgments because consent decrees often \"go well beyond what is required\" by law, and\n\"thereby `improperly deprive future officials of their designated legislative and executive powers.'\" Id. at 2594\n(quoting Frew, 540 U.S. at 441, 124 S.Ct. 899).\nBut in Horne, the Supreme Court also endorsed and cited its prior decisions in Rufo and Frew00decisions\n97\napproving the use of consent decrees in institutional reform cases. See Horne, 129 S.Ct. at 2593-95; see also \nSalazar v. District of Columbia, 685 F.Supp.2d 72, 75-76 (D.D.C.2010) (concluding that Horne \"reaffirmed the\n166 vitality of [Rufo,] 502 U.S. 367, 368, 112 S.Ct. 748 (1992), the leading case setting *166 forth the standards for\nmodifying a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(5) in institutional reform cases.\"); LaShawn, 701 F.Supp.2d at 94-95,\n[37]\n99-101, 2010 WL 1270202, at *8, *12-*13 (applying Rufo standards).  If, as defendants argue, there is an\ninherent conflict between Horne and Rufo or Frew, the Supreme Court certainly did not acknowledge it. Thus, this\nCourt is bound by those earlier decisions, and it will not adopt defendants' attempt to use Horne to undermine\ntheir holdings. See Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237, 117 S.Ct. 1997, 138 L.Ed.2d 391 (1997) (\"If a\nprecedent of this Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line\nof decisions, the [lower court] should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative\nof overruling its own decisions.\").\nSignificantly for purposes of the present case, Rufo and Frew establish that a consent decree may appropriately\n[38]\ngo beyond the bare bones of what a court could order without the local government's consent. See Rufo, 502\nU.S. at 389, 112 S.Ct. 748 (\"But we have no doubt that, to `save themselves the time, expense, and inevitable\nrisk of litigation,' [the defendants] could settle the dispute over the proper remedy for the constitutional violations\nthat had been found by undertaking to do more than the Constitution itself requires (almost any affirmative decree\nbeyond a directive to obey the Constitution necessarily does that), but also more than what a court would have\nordered absent the settlement.\" (citation omitted)); Frew, 540 U.S. at 437-38, 124 S.Ct. 899 (rejecting argument\nthat consent decree violates the Eleventh Amendment on the ground that \"state officials [may agree] to bind state\ngovernments to significantly more commitments than what federal law requires\"); see also Local No. 93, Int'l\nAss'n of Firefighters v. City of Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501, 525, 106 S.Ct. 3063, 92 L.Ed.2d 405 (1986) (consent\ndecree may properly \"provide[] broader relief than the court could have awarded after a trial\"). Indeed, that is one\nreason why consent decrees are a valuable tool for resolving such cases. See Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383, 112 S.Ct.\n167 748 (noting *167 that if plaintiffs enter into a consent decree \"[a]t least they will avoid further litigation and\nperhaps will negotiate a decree providing more than what would have been ordered without the local\ngovernment's consent\"); Local No. 93, 478 U.S. at 522, 106 S.Ct. 3063 (\"Consent decrees are entered into by\n\nparties to a case after careful negotiation has produced agreement on their precise terms. The parties waive their\nright to litigate the issues involved in the case and thus save themselves the time, expense, and inevitable risk of\nlitigation. Naturally, the agreement reached normally embodies a compromise; in exchange for the saving of cost\nand elimination of risk, the parties each give up something they might have won had they proceeded with the\nlitigation.\" (quoting United States v. Armour & Co., 402 U.S. 673, 681, 91 S.Ct. 1752, 29 L.Ed.2d 256 (1971)); see\nalso LaShawn, 701 F.Supp.2d at 99-101, 2010 WL 1270202, at *12-*13.\nIn addition, federal district courts retain the power to enforce consent decrees in institutional reform cases. A\nconsent decree\" `embodies an agreement of the parties' and is also `an agreement that the parties desire and\nexpect will be reflected in, and be enforceable as, a judicial decree that is subject to the rules generally applicable\nto other judgments and decrees.' \"See Frew, 540 U.S. at 437, 124 S.Ct. 899 (quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at 378, 112\nS.Ct. 748.) \"Federal courts are not reduced to approving consent decrees and hoping for compliance. Once\n[39]\nentered, a consent decree may be enforced.\" Id. at 440, 124 S.Ct. 899.\nBecause Horne did not involve a consent decree, it had no occasion to address defendants' claim that all they\nhave to do is satisfy the constitutional minimum as opposed to provisions of a consent decree that arguably\nexceed the minimum but were agreed to by the parties to cure conditions that flow from constitutional violations.\nBut this very claim was addressed and rejected in Rufo. There, the Supreme Court made clear that where there\nis a consent decree in place, the legally enforceable obligations are \"not confined to meeting minimal\nconstitutional requirements.\" Rufo, 502 U.S. at 390, 112 S.Ct. 748. Moreover, \"[a] proposed modification should\nnot strive to rewrite a consent decree so that it conforms to the constitutional floor,\" Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391, 112\nS.Ct. 748, and a party cannot \"require a court to retrace old legal ground, say, by re-making or rejustifying its\n168 original `constitutional decision every time an effort [is] made to enforce or modify'\" an order. *168Horne, 129\nS.Ct. at 2619 (quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at 389-390, 392, 112 S.Ct. 748); see also LaShawn, 701 F.Supp.2d at\n97-101, 2010 WL 1270202, at *11-*13.\nDespite this binding precedent, defendants cite to a number of cases decided since Horne where courts have\nvacated consent decrees. (See Defs.' Reply at 6 & n. 9; Defs.' Notice of Supplemental Authority, Dec. 9, 2009;\nDefs.' Notice of Supplemental Authority, Mar. 30, 2010). However, none of the cited cases is analogous to our\ncase, for, in each of them, there were compelling circumstances that supported the termination of the consent\ndecree that are not present here.\nIn three of the four cases, defendants were found to be in full compliance with the consent decree. In United\nStates v. Board of Education of the City of Chicago, 663 F.Supp.2d 649 (N.D.Ill.2009), the district court\nterminated a consent decree that addressed segregation in the Chicago school system based on its\ndetermination that defendants had complied in good faith with the consent decree and court orders over a\nreasonable period of time, had eliminated all vestiges of segregation to the extent practicable, and had\ndemonstrated its good faith commitment to the constitutional rights that were the predicate for intervention. Id. at\n654, 660-62. Similarly, in Consumer Advisory Board v. Harvey, No. 91-CV-321-P-S, 697 F.Supp.2d 131, 2010 WL\n1037593 (D.Me. Mar. 19, 2010), defendants had \"achieved substantial compliance\" with the consent decree by\n[40]\nmeeting the benchmarks set forth in the decree itself. Id. at 134, at *3.  Finally, in Basel v. Bielaczyz, No.\n74-40135-BC, 2009 WL 2843906 (E.D.Mich. Sept. 1, 2009), the court vacated a consent judgment that was\nentered to correct the substantial backlog of hearing requests before a state agency after noting that \"[i]n the\nyears closely following entry of the consent judgment, there is no suggestion on the docket or by the parties that\nDefendants were ever held in contempt based on a failure to comply with the consent judgment.... The terms of\nthe consent judgment and the history of apparent compliance suggest that the consent judgment served its\npurpose, and at some point, the need for the injunction passed.\" Id. at *7.\nIn contrast, defendants here have a proven 30-year history of noncompliance. And, in fact, based on the\nrepresentations of defense counsel at oral argument, there is a serious question as to whether defendants are\n[41]\neven trying to comply with these orders.\n169 *169 The fourth post-Horne case cited by defendants is also inapposite. In Cleveland Fire Fighters for Fair Hiring\nPractices v. City of Cleveland, No. 1:00-CV-301, 2009 WL 2602366 (N.D.Ohio Aug. 20, 2009), the district court\ndenied a Rule 60(b)(5) motion to extend the term of a consent decree that had been entered in 1975 to address\n\ndiscrimination in the hiring practices of the Cleveland Fire Department. Id. at *3, *16. The court declined to extend\nthe decree because if found that (1) defendant City has \"extended its best efforts to achieve the hiring goals\" in\nthe decree; (2) all parties used their best efforts to produce dynamic change; (3) \"changes relating to, among\nother things, this nation's declining economy have taken place, which could not have been anticipated at the time\nthe [decree] was entered into\"00and (4) \"circumstances were ... unforeseen and, hence, despite a good faith\n97\neffort, the City has not satisfied the goals\" in the decree. Id. at *13-*14. The court therefore concluded that \"[t]he\nevidence demonstrates that it was not the City's lack of effort, but rather circumstances beyond its control, that\nresulted in it falling short of satisfying the goals in the [decree].\" Id. at *16. Not only was Cleveland Fire Fighters\nin a different procedural posture because movants were seeking to extend a decree past an already established\ntermination date, but unlike Cleveland Fire Fighters, the record before the Court does not support a finding that\ndefendants have \"extended [their] best efforts\" to satisfy the obligations in the consent orders or that there are\n[42]\n\"circumstances beyond its control\" that have caused it to fall short.  To the contrary, defendants freely admit\n[43]\nthat they are determined to seek vacatur and not compliance.\n170 *170 Indeed, what the courts did in these cases is similar to the analysis courts engaged in before Horne, which\nwas, in considering whether the objects of a consent decree had been met, to look to whether defendants had in\ngood faith complied with the decree. For example, in Board of Education v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 111 S.Ct. 630,\n112 L.Ed.2d 715 (1991), the Supreme Court remanded with instructions to the district court to decide \"whether\nthe [defendant] had complied in good faith with the desegregation decree since it was entered, and whether the\nvestiges of past discrimination had been eliminated to the extent practicable.\" Id. at 249-50, 111 S.Ct. 630.\nSimilarly, in Labor/Community Strategy Center v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, 564\nF.3d 1115 (9th Cir.2009), the court affirmed the district court's decision not to extend a consent decree\naddressing the day-to-day operations of the Los Angeles County bus system because \"the evidence presented\nsupported the district court's finding that the imperfections with respect to load factor targets were de minimis in\nrelation to the overall scheme of things.\" Id. at 1123. And, in McDonald v. Bowersox, No. 89-1086 C(2), 1995 WL\n17013058 (E.D.Mo. Sep. 18, 1995), aff'd, McDonald v. Carnahan, 109 F.3d 1319, 1321-22 (8th Cir.1997), the\ndistrict court dissolved a consent decree regulating day-to-day life on death row, describing the critical question\nas whether \"the underlying constitutional rights addressed through the decree are ensured through defendants'\ncompliance with the decree's provisions in good faith for a reasonable period of time.\" Id. at *3.\nIn none of these cases is there support for defendants' novel proposition that they can attain the objects of the\nconsent orders without complying with their terms as long as they meet some ill-defined \"constitutional minimum.\"\nSee LaShawn, 701 F.Supp.2d at 109-11, 2010 WL 1270202, at *20-*21; Johnson v. Sheldon, No. 8:87-CV-369,\n2009 WL 3231226, at *7 (M.D.Fla. Sept. 30, 2009) (declining to vacate a consent decree despite defendant's\n171 \"substantial compliance\" and \"sweeping modifications *171 and improvements to the community mental health\nsystem\" where decree specified exit criteria, which defendant had not yet fully satisfied); R.C. v. Walley, 475\nF.Supp.2d 1118, 1123 (M.D.Ala.2007) (\"termination of consent decree is not appropriate unless the decree's\npurposes have been fully achieved\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Nor does Horne support this\nproposition.\nUnlike Horne, this case involves a thirty-year series of consent orders whereby the District committed itself to\ntake certain actions to remedy the violations of plaintiffs' constitutional rights. These consent orders are what\n[44]\ngives content to otherwise vague rights and substance to a remedy when those rights are violated. . Moreover,\nas the Supreme Court has recognized, consent decrees are a valuable tool for resolving litigation00with benefits\n97\nto plaintiffs, defendants and the courts. But if the Court were to permit defendants to walk away from their\nobligations under the consent orders simply because there is a new administration that believes that all it needs\nto do is achieve the constitutional floor (whatever that means), that would mean that there would be no future\nconsent decrees involving governmental entities. Plaintiffs would have no incentive to enter into consent decrees\nif the next administration could attack a prior administration's agreement by saying it promised more than was\nrequired. And, courts would be unlikely to approve a consent decree if each new administration could force a\nretrial based on a claim that the constitutional floor has now been met. While Horne may have provided\nparameters for court involvement in institutional reform litigation and consent decrees, it did not declare their\ndemise. In light of the continued vitality of Rufo and Frew, and as long as the obligations voluntarily assumed by\ndefendants flow from constitutional violations, this Court may not rewrite the existing consent orders so as to\n\nreduce defendants' promise to some ill-defined constitutional floor. See Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391, 112 S.Ct. 748; \nLaShawn, 701 F.Supp.2d at 110-11, 2010 WL 1270202, at *21. Accordingly, as defendants concede they are not\nin compliance with the court orders, they have not satisfied Horne's first requirement of showing that the object of\nthe consent orders has been attained.\nB. Defendants Have Not Yet Implemented a \"Durable Remedy\"\nNor have defendants satisfied Horne's second requirement of showing that a \"durable remedy\" has been\nimplemented. 129 S.Ct. at 2595. What it means to have a \"durable remedy\" is a question that Horne does not\nanswer, but at a minimum, a \"durable\" remedy means a remedy that gives the Court confidence that defendants\nwill not resume their violations of plaintiffs' constitutional rights once judicial oversight ends. See LaShawn, 701\nF.Supp.2d at 110-11, 2010 WL 1270202, at *21; Harvey, 2009 WL 5792159, at *11 (suggesting that a \"durable\nremedy\" is the equivalent of having in place \"a mechanism for future compliance\"). Whether there is a durable\nremedy thus necessarily depends on the actual impacts or outcomes experienced by the plaintiffs. The Court has\nto be persuaded that defendants are no longer violating plaintiffs' constitutional rights and that they will \"not return\n172 to [their] former ways.\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247-48, 111 S.Ct. 630. As was the case in LaShawn,*172 701\nF.Supp.2d at 111-12, 2010 WL 1270202, at *22, defendants ask the Court to conclude that it has a durable\nremedy in place because it has implemented permanent structural changes and will remain subject to extensive\nmonitoring even without judicial involvement.\n1. Permanent Structural Changes\nDefendants focus on the following permanent structural changes: (1) the establishment of the Department on\nDisability Services (\"DDS\") as a cabinet-level department with independent personnel and procurement authority;\n[45]\n (2) the creation of the Department of Health Care Finance (\"DHCF\") as an independent, cabinet-level agency\nthat functions as the single-state Medicaid agency with two (to increase to four) staff dedicated to persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities; (3) increased interagency cooperation between DDS/DDA and DHCF, including\nroutine weekly telephone calls, staff co-location and extensive collaboration on a number of ongoing projects; (4)\nincreased interagency collaboration between DDS/DDA and the Health Regulation and Licensing Administration\n(\"HRLA\"), including sharing findings and conducting joint investigations; and (5) the establishment in July 2009 of\na Task Force including representatives from DDS/DDA, DHCF, and HRLA to advise the Mayor regarding all\nservices for individuals with developmental disabilities. (Defs.' Mem. at 37-43.)\nThese structural changes are all extremely positive developments, but they do not necessarily translate into proof\n[46]\nof a durable remedy.  All of the changes have occurred within the past year or two, and, especially in view of\nthe fact that this litigation has spanned over 30 years and still defendants have not achieved compliance, it is\nsimply too soon to tell whether they will result in improved outcomes for the plaintiffs, and, if so, whether the\nimprovements will be sustained absent judicial involvement. Even defendants admit that systemic change can\n[47]\ntake three to five years.  (Defs.' Mem.' at 70; Defs.' Mem., Ex. 16, Expert Report of Nancy Thaler, July 14,\n2008 (\"In no state have problems been solved over night. The full transformation of a system00the building of\n97\n173 structure and processes and the appointment of *173 strong leaders to manage the way it all works\ntogether00takes several years. Three to five years is the standard time frame assumed to be necessary to turn a\n97\nsystem around. Progress, that is evidence of the effort to change things, becomes evident only over time.\"); see\nalso 12/11/08 Trial Tr. at 353 (Test. of Laura Nuss) (\"you don't see the outcomes that you want to see as fast as\nyou would like to see them. You know, this is a historically plagued service system. So I think it is taking time to\nsee the outcomes. But, you know, we still see the bad outcomes for individual issues. But we're also seeing a lot\nof positive ones\").\nMoreover, with respect to interagency coordination and collaboration, there have been improvements, but the\nDistrict's performance has been less than consistent given the problems in this area as recently as December\n2008. (See 2009 Special Masters' Report at 129 (\"Time has shown that the problems with interagency\ncoordination persist under the Fenty Administration as they had under the previous administration, and have\nresulted in the same sub-standard conditions, lack of necessary medical care, as well as inappropriate and\n\nineffective day programs.\").) For example, defendants' expert, Nancy Thaler, concluded that it was a failure in\ninteragency communication that caused \"[t]he recent decision made by MAA to change the Medical Assistance\ntransportation arrangements [to have] a negative impact on the consumers in the DDA program by limiting their\ncapacity to travel to medical and other appointments.\" (Defs.' Mem., Ex. 16, Addendum to Expert Report of\nNancy Thaler at 11-12, Oct. 7, 2008.) Similarly, as of December 2008, there continued to be problems with\nobtaining guardianships in a timely fashion. (2009 Special Masters' Report at 45, 49 (\"The delays in obtaining\nguardianship for the provision of informed consent for medical and dental treatment of class members ... have\ncontinued in the compliance period,\" leading to defendants continued inability \"to provide class members with\nmedical treatment and health care that is timely, particularly for class members who have acute medical\nneeds.\").)\n2. Monitoring\nThe second part of defendants' durable remedy argument is their claim that their performance is subject to\nextensive monitoring, including monitoring by the Superior Court, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services\n(\"CMS\"), the Quality Trust, and the District's internal monitoring by the Health Regulation and Licensing\nAdministration (\"HRLA\") and the four units of DDA's Quality Management Division00Health and Wellness, Quality\n97\nEnhancement and Quality Improvement, Incident Management and Enforcement, and Mortality Review.\nUnfortunately, there are a number of problems with defendants' contention that this monitoring is proof of a\ndurable remedy.\ni. Superior Court00As described by defendants, the Superior Court for the District of Columbia plays a significant\n97\n174 role in overseeing plaintiffs.[48] However, *174 the Superior Court's authority is limited to treatment decisions\n[49]\nabout individual class members, and although this system has been in place since 1979,  significant systemic\nreforms have not been achieved. Moreover, proposed legislation may signification alter the role of the Superior\nCourt. See D.C. Council, B18-0501, Developmental Disabilities Reform Act of 2009 (introduced Oct. 20, 2009).\nThus, although Superior Court reviews individual cases and does play an important role, its job is limited and in\nlight of the pending legislation, the Court can hardly count on its continued involvement.\nii. CMS00According to defendants, CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid\n97\nprograms, \"already provides extensive oversight for services provided by DDS/DDA.\" (Defs.' Mem. at 44.) For\nexample, the District must submit an annual report to CMS that addresses both fiscal and quality performance\nmeasures, and CMS conducts \"unannounced random audits on various areas of its six assurances, including\nlevel of care, service plan, qualified providers, health and welfare, administrative oversight, and financial\naccountability.\" (Id. (citing Nuss. Decl. ¶ 4, Oct. 7, 2009) (Ex. 4 to Defs.' Mem.).) In addition, according to\ndefendants, \"CMS will be initiating expanded... quality-reporting in the next fiscal year that mirrors the expanded\nquality management requirements now found in the HCBS waiver program.\" (Id.) Finally, defendants assert that:\nFrom February 2007 to March 2009, CMS engaged in even more intensive monitoring to ensure\nthe then-MAA and DDS/DDA's compliance with the federal HCBS waiver requirements. This\nincluded monthly written and telephonic monitoring of a corrective action plan in three of the six\nassurances: Plan of Care; Health and Welfare; and Administrative Oversight. In March 2009,\nhowever, CMS determined that the District had \"made major changes in the performance,\nstructure, oversight mechanism, and systems sufficient enough to engage in continuous Quality\nImprovement (QI).\" To qualify for such a finding, a state must demonstrate a robust system of\n\"discovery, remediation and improvement\" in all six assurances. Citing the \"demonstrated\neffectiveness of the many newly implemented systems to meet the CMS quality requirements,\"\nCMS discontinued its intensified monitoring.\n[50]\n(Defs.' Mem. at 45 (quoting and citing CMS Letter, March 9, 2009 (Ex. 19 to Defs.' Mem.).)  Plaintiff responds\nthat the CMS monitoring \"is irrelevant ... [because] CMS monitors all states that participate in the federal\nMedicaid program. All such states are required to file the type of annual reports that the defendants reference.\"\n(Pls.' Opp'n at 82.) But more importantly, CMS does not perform regular on-site audits to determine the quality of\ncare provided to class members and other DDA consumers. According to the DOJ counsel who represents\n\n175 plaintiff-intervenors, *175 the District conducts the on-site reviews of community placements and the regional\noffice of CMS, \"as part of their quality review that occurs every five years,... requests evidence from the District\nthat it is meeting all the statutory and regulatory assurances required for CMS.\" (12/18/09 Tr. at 195.) Given CMS'\nlimited role in conducting on-site visits so that it can assess the impact of the systems on class members, the\nCourt can take little solace from the increased role of CMS, which is a recent development that will not begin until\nsometime this year and will be a far cry from the type of monitoring that has any direct impact on the day-to-day\nlives of the plaintiffs.\niii. Quality Trust00As part of the 2001 Plan and as part of the settlement of the Evans litigation, the Quality Trust\n97\nwas established in 2001 as an quasi-independent entity tasked with providing \"monitoring, legal services and lay\nadvocacy services for consumers in the District of Columbia.\" (2001 Plan at 45 (footnote omitted).) As part of its\nfunction, the Quality Trust was to monitor services being provided to the over 1400 non-class members and\nwould eventually take over from the Court Monitor the job of monitoring the Evans class members. (Id. at 46; see\nalso supra pp. 135-37.) Specifically, the Quality Trust is tasked with developing and implementing an annual\nmonitoring plan with input from all stakeholders; reviewing all reports and investigations of serious incidents\ninvolving DDS consumers; issuing annual reports; and reviewing and providing input regarding DDS budgeting\ninformation. (2001 Plan at 47-48.) However, although defendants point to the Quality Trust as an important\nmonitoring component, the Quality Trust has informed the Court in its most recent filing that the \"proposal to\ntransition the monitoring function solely to Quality Trust is premature.\" (Quality Trust Opp'n at 21; see also id. at\n27 (\"When adequate structures are in place, and an opportunity for meaningful transition from the Court Monitor\nhas occurred, Quality Trust will be able to assume post-litigation monitoring of the Evans class members along\nwith its current monitoring function.\").) The Quality Trust estimates that it will take 12-18 months \"to have a\nmeaningful transition.\" (12/17/09 Tr. at 140.) Given this assessment, the Court cannot yet look to the Quality Trust\n[51]\nto support defendants' durable remedy argument.\niv. Internal DDS Quality Assurance System00According to defendants, \"internal monitoring methods will ensure\n97\nthat it sustains the extensive reforms now in place.\" (Defs.' Mem. at 48). Within the Developmental Disabilities\nAdministration, the Quality Management Division (\"QMD\") \"monitors all aspects of the service-delivery system to\nensure compliance with federal and local law, national best practices, and applicable court orders.\" (Id. (quoting\n10/7/09 Nuss Decl. ¶ 51).) The QMD is divided into four functional units: Health and Wellness, Quality\nEnhancement and Quality Improvement (\"QE/QI\"), Incident Management and Enforcement (\"IMEU\"), and\nMortality Review. (Defs.' Mem. at 48-50 (quoting 10/7/09 Nuss Decl. ¶ 52).)\n176 *176 While improvements in internal monitoring are critical to the existence of a durable remedy, over the lengthy\nhistory of this case, defendants' monitoring has been woefully inadequate both in terms of the quality and speed\nof internal investigations of both deaths and serious incidents involving class members and DDA consumers. This\nproblem has continued through 2009. (See, e.g., Quarterly Report of the Court Monitor at 7, December 10, 2009;\nQuality Trust for Individuals with Disabilities Monitoring Unit Annual Report and Data Summary at 1, Oct. 1,\n200800Sept. 30, 2009 (concluding that \"progress in improving the systems and supports for people with\n97\ndevelopmental disabilities in the District of Columbia is mixed.... A more consistent and transparent process for\ninvestigating Serious Reportable Incidents at DA is also necessary.... Our data indicates that investigation reports\nare not being completed consistent with policy.)\nThe flaws in the District's internal monitoring also became apparent recently when the District had to put into\nreceivership one of its largest providers, Individual Development, Inc. (\"IDI\"). While the District touts this action as\nan example of \"[t]he new institutional culture and collaborative ethos\" of officials from DDA, DHCF, and HRLA\n(Defs.' Mem. re Alternate Remedy at 5), what it conveniently fails to disclose is that many of the problems with\nthis provider that led to the receivership were uncovered by the Court Monitor and reported by the Court Monitor\nand the plaintiffs, not by the District's internal monitoring apparatus. (See 12/18/09 Tr. at 239.)\nIn sum, defendants have not demonstrated a durable remedy as required by Horne. While it is true that the\nDistrict has made significant strides in the last year or two under new leadership, the Court does not have\nconfidence that the agency's progress is durable and self-sustaining. Accord LaShawn, 701 F.Supp.2d at 110-12,\n2010 WL 1270202, at *21-*22. As documented by the 2009 Special Masters' Report, the three most recent Court\nMonitor Reports and the 2009 Quality Trust's Monitoring Unit Annual Report and Data Summary, results are, at\n\nbest, uneven, and it is far too soon to determine whether the structural changes, some of which are still in the\nimplementation phase, will have the desired impacts on the safety, health and welfare of the class members.\nCONCLUSION\nIn 1978, the parties agreed, and the Court endorsed that agreement in an Order and Judgment, that plaintiffs had\ncertain constitutional rights, that those rights had been violated, and that to remedy those violations, defendants\nwould have to take certain remedial actions. More than 30 years later, defendants ask the Court to relieve them\nof those obligations under Rule 60(b)(5) on the grounds that enforcing those promises prospectively is no longer\nequitable. While defendants certainly have the right to file a 60(b)(5) motion, they have the burden to justify their\nmotion. Defendants have failed: the objectives of the original consent decree and subsequent court orders, as\nincorporated in the 2001 Plan, have not been achieved and defendants have not demonstrated that the\nprospective enforcement of the court orders would be inequitable or \"detrimental to the public interest.\" Horne,\n129 S.Ct. at 2593. Accordingly, defendants' motion for vacatur and dismissal will be DENIED.\n[1] Plaintiffs are a class of former residents of Forest Haven. As of December 2009, there were 600 class\nmembers (see Court Monitor Report at 2, Dec. 10, 2009); the original class has decreased due to the deaths of\nclass members. The sole remaining defendants are the District of Columbia (\"the District\") and the Mayor Adrian\nFenty (collectively \"the District\" or \"defendants\"). The United States is also a party, having been permitted to\nintervene as a plaintiff in January 1977.\n[2] However, on March 29, 201000only a matter of days before the issuance of this Memorandum\n97\nOpinion00defendants, having rebuffed all recent efforts to settle this matter and having resisted offering any\n97\nalternatives to the Special Masters' proposed remedies unless the remedy promised the swift cessation of Court\nsupervision, filed a proposed alternate remedy for ending this litigation. (See Defs.' Mot. for Consideration of\nAlternative to Appointment of Independent Compliance Administrator and for Entry of Exit Plan, March 29, 2010\n[\"Defs.' Mot. for Alternate Remedy\"].) Obviously, there has been insufficient time for plaintiffs to respond to this\nproposal, which, if nothing else, as a matter of fairness, should have been submitted during the remedy phase of\nthis litigation so that the parties, the Special Masters, and the Court could have had some chance to address\ndefendants' new 17-page plan, which, on its face, appears to dramatically depart from the definition of outcomes\nand measurement of success that were agreed to by the parties when they entered into the 2001 Plan.\n[3] Although the Court will address the Special Masters' Report and Recommendation in a separate\nmemorandum opinion and order, many of the relevant facts will be included here as they are also relevant to the\npending motion.\n[4] The Honorable John H. Pratt presided over this case from its inception until his death in August 1995.\n[5] The case was reassigned to the Honorable Stanley S. Harris upon Judge Pratt's death in 1995.\n[6] The Court appointed Margaret G. Farrell to serve as Special Master.\n[7] The imposition of $5 million in contempt fines was reversed by the D.C. Circuit on the ground that the fines\namounted to a criminal sanction that could not be imposed without a criminal trial. Evans v. Williams, 206 F.3d\n1292 (D.C.Cir.2000).\n[8] On January 19, 2001, Dr. Jane Haddad was appointed as the first Independent Court Monitor. After her\nresignation, effective February 10, 2004, the Court appointed, with the concurrence of the parties, Elizabeth\nJones as the Court Monitor. Ms. Jones has continued to serve admirably in that capacity and has been of great\nassistance to the Court and to the parties.\n[9] As previously described by the Court, the joint stipulated findings of fact: \npainted a bleak picture as to defendants' record of noncompliance. The findings acknowledged that there had\nbeen a \"serious breakdown\" in the District's system of support for individuals with developmental disabilities and\nthat the system, which had suffered from years of neglect and mismanagement, \"urgently need[ed] to be fixed.\" \n\nEvans, 139 F.Supp.2d at 96-97; see also, e.g., id. at 98 (noting that District's mental retardation and\ndevelopmental delivery system was \"broken\" and needed to be \"redefined and rebuilt\"). The findings noted that\ndefendants' compliance with the prior Court Orders had deteriorated following the closure of Forest Haven in\n1991 and that defendants were not complying with many of the requirements of those Orders. Id. at 98. The\nfindings also identified numerous \"fundamental problems,\" including problems with respect to staffing, staff\ntraining, and monitoring; management; reporting of and response to unusual incidents; safeguarding of class\nmembers' funds; the budgeting process; and the District's Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services\nwaiver. See id. at 98-107.\nEvans, 480 F.Supp.2d at 286-87.\n[10] Clarence Sundram was the expert to the Special Master who \"conceived, shaped, and drafted significantly\"\nthe 2001 Plan. (2001 Plan at 5 n. 1). He was appointed as a co-Special Master on January 30, 2001. (Order, Jan.\n30, 2001.)\n[11] The Court's order and opinion included extensive factual findings documenting the District's failure to meet\neach of the goals. Id. at 97-107.\n[12] Of that amount, Quality Trust estimates that the District still has $5 million left to contribute. (Hr'g Tr. at 138,\nDec. 17, 2009 [\"12/17/09 Tr.\"].)\n[13] As noted above (see supra note 2), defendants have now made half-hearted reference to a limited number of\norders that they believe should be vacated (Mem. in Supp. of Defs.' Mot. for Alternate Remedy at 3 [\"Defs.' Mem.\nre Alternate Remedy\"]), but prior to this, defendants steadfastly maintained that modification was not realistic;\ninstead, all orders must be vacated and the case dismissed. (See infra note 34.)\n[14] Shortly after the 2001 Plan was approved, Judge Harris retired and this case was reassigned to the\nundersigned.\n[15] Since January 2004, several different individuals have served in this capacity. Presently, the Mayor's\nappointee is Peter Nickles, the Attorney General for the District of Columbia. But see infra pp. 145-46.\n[16] The United States, as plaintiff-intervenor, also filed a motion for an order to show cause why defendants\nshould not be held in contempt. The Court denied that motion on March 30, 2007. (Order, Mar. 30, 2007.)\n[17] At the August 9, 2007 status conference, the director of DDS, Judith Heumann, informed the Court that (1)\nthe name of the MRDDA was changing to the Developmental Disabilities Administration (\"DDA\"); and (2) that\nLaura Nuss would be the new deputy overseeing the DDA. (Hr'g. Tr. at 5, Aug. 9, 2007.)\n[18] On September 15, 2008, defendants filed a motion for an order modifying the 2008 Special Masters' Report\nto find defendants in compliance with the 2007 90-Day Consent Order. (Defs.' Mot. to Modify the Special Masters'\nReport & Recommendation, Consistent with Defs.' Objections, to Find Defs. in Compliance with the Consent\nOrder of Sept. 12, 2007, at 1, Sept. 15, 2008.) On October 6, 2008, the Court held this motion in abeyance and to\nthe extent it is necessary to address this motion, it will be done in the Court's opinion regarding defendants'\nobjections to the 2008 Special Masters' Report and Recommendation.\n[19] John M. Cook, Executive Director, L'Arche, Inc.; Thomas F. Wilds, member of interagency rate-setting task\nforce.\n[20] Martha B. Knisley; Lewis H. Spence, lecturer, Harvard School of Education and Kennedy School of\nGovernment (remedy).\n[21] Laura L. Nuss, Deputy Director of the Department on Disability Services, responsible for the Developmental\nDisabilities Administration; John McCarthy, Deputy Director of the Department of Health Care Finance and\nDistrict of Columbia State Medicaid Director; Kathy Sawyer, former consultant and Interim Director, DDS, former \nEvans Compliance Officer (through Jan. 31, 2008) and former Interim Administrator, MRDDA; Judith Heumann,\nDirector, DDS; Amy Brooks, President of RCM, a provider agency; Lisa Alexander, M.D., DC HRP.\n\n[22] David L. Jackson, M.D., Ph.D, President, Jackson & Assocs. (2007 mortality review and follow-up on\nrecommendations for improvement); Nancy Thaler, Executive Director, National Association of State Directors of\nDevelopmental Disabilities Services; and John Sumner, Ph.D (statistical analysis).\n[23] \"About one third of the class members (228) receive psychotropic medications,\" and \"305 class members\nhave behavior support plans.\" (Id. at 35.)\n[24] Under their latest filing, defendants propose the period of court monitoring and supervision to end at the end\nof 2010. (Defs.' Mot. for Alternate Remedy at 2.). Defendants, however, seek to have the Court accept their\nalternative remedy while still preserving their rights to appeal the denial of their motion for vacatur and dismissal.\n(Id. at 2 & n. 2.)\n[25] It was conceded by the State of Pennsylvania that the plaintiff \"ha[d] a right to adequate food, shelter,\nclothing, and medical care,\" so the Court limited its inquiry to the narrow question of \"whether liberty interests \nalso exist in safety, freedom of movement, and training.\" Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315, 102 S.Ct. 2452 (emphasis\nadded). As discussed infra, this fact is relevant because no matter how Youngberg is interpreted, it has no effect\non a host of issues covered by the consent decrees and the 2001 Plan. See infra pp. 160-61.\n[26] The judge examined two possible theories of the right to habilitation00quid pro quo and parens patriae00and\n97 97\nconcluded that both apply to a person who has been involuntarily committed. Clark, 794 F.2d at 95.\n[27] Although the Fourth Circuit stated that it rejected the idea that class members \"had a right to treatment in the\nleast restrictive environment,\" Thomas S., 902 F.2d at 253-54, it also affirmed the district court's order which\narguably could not exist absent such a right.\n[28] The court in Thomas S. also found that \"the conditions and services at the state psychiatric institutions are\nsubstantially below minimally accepted professional standard\" in part because of \"[i]nadequate treatment plans\nand inadequate documentation of their implementation.\" Id. at 1197. As discussed herein, the constitutional\nrequirement that professional judgment be exercised in making decisions also requires that those decisions be\nimplemented. See infra pp. ___-___.\n[29] At oral argument, the Court asked defense counsel: \"If I say the '78 [order] is a correct statement and that the\nsubsequent orders incorporate and flow from [it], what happens then? End of my analysis?\" Defendants' counsel\nreplied: \"I think it is the end of your analysis, Your Honor.\" (12/17/09 Tr. at 49.)\n[30] As discussed infra, defendants also ignore the fact that even if the Court accepts their Youngberg argument,\nit would justify, at most, partial modification of some court orders pertaining to plaintiffs' right to habilitation and\nwould have no impact on those portions of the orders, arguably the most critical provisions, which address\nplaintiffs' constitutional rights to safety and health care. (See infra pp. 163-64.)\n[31] Significantly, defendants cannot justify their delay by arguing that Horne is the change in law that they are\nrelying on. In fact, defendants filed their motion even before Horne was decided on June 25, 2009.\n[32] (See, e.g., 1981 Consent Order; 1983 Consent Order; Jan. 1990 Contempt Order; Apr. 1990 Contempt\nOrder; Order Denying Motion for Civil Contempt Sanctions, May 15, 1991; 1995 Contempt Order; 1996 Order &\nRemedial Plan; 2001 Joint Findings of Fact, Consent Order, Plan for Compliance; 2004 Coordination Order; 2007\nOrder and Opinion on Liability; 2007 90-Day Consent Order; 2008 Special Masters' Report re 90-Day Consent\nOrder; 2009 Special Masters' Report.)\n[33] As described in the 2009 Special Masters' Report: \nThe unchallenged testimony of defendants' witness, Laura Nuss, is that there have been 250 placements into\nless restrictive environments. Defendants have moved a significant number of class members to apartments and\ngroup homes. The evidence during the liability phase of this action was that 55% of class members resided in\nICFs/MR (366 of 659 class members, 480 F.Supp.2d at 315 n. 43.) That number is down to a little over 250 class\nmembers (approximately 40% of the class), and defendants reasonably expect to accelerate that movement with\nthe further development of the community-based waiver and the Money Follows The Person Grant, which is\n\nexpected to further reduce the utilization of ICFs/MR by 60% (Nuss Trial Tr. 275:18-21). Based on these findings\nof fact, the Special Masters find that plaintiffs have not sustained their burden of proving by clear and convincing\nevidence non-compliance with court orders requiring residential placements in less restrictive settings.\n(Id. at 72.)\n[34] (See 12/17/2009 Tr. at 22 (\"Your Honor, I do not think there is a middle ground.\"); id. at 24 (\"modification as\nto the plan would be something that would almost be a futile act\").) In defendants' brief, they state that if the\nCourt rejects this option, \"[i]n the alternative, the Court should at the very least modify the orders currently in\nforce, to eliminate any provisions that are not reasonably necessary to remedy a current and ongoing\nconstitutional violation.\" (Defs.' Mem. at 7.) However, if defendants want a modification, it is their burden to show\nthe Court that the modification is narrowly tailored to the change in circumstances. Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383, 112\nS.Ct. 748 (\"[A] party seeking modification of a consent decree bears the burden of establishing that a significant\nchange in circumstances warrants revision of the decree. If the moving party meets this standard, the court\nshould consider whether the proposed modification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance.\").\nDefendants have made no effort to offer a modification suitably tailored to the arguably changed circumstances. (\nSee 12/17/09 Tr. at 39 (\"Your Honor, in all candor, if you do not vacate the orders, we would have to look at them\nanew and see if any00 if00what modifications could be made to them that are realistic.\")); see also See LaShawn v.\n97 97\nFenty, No. 89-CV-1754, 701 F.Supp.2d 84, 110-11, 2010 WL 1270202, at *21 (D.D.C. Apr. 5, 2010) (defendants\nsimilarly did not \"propose[] a modification tailored to the alleged changed circumstances\" leaving the court\nwithout \"an adequate proposal to consider\"). Moreover, they have steadfastly refused to invoke the procedures\nprovided for by the 2001 Plan (see 2001 Plan at 6-10) or under Rule 60(b)(5) for modification or termination of\norders that have been achieved or those that are no longer relevant or obtainable.\n[35] When asked to explain what a minimal right to medical care encompasses, defense counsel suggested that\nplaintiffs' right to medical care was limited to the \"health implications\" of the \"very minimal\" \"duty to keep them\nsafe and free from unreasonable restraints.\" (12/17/09 Tr. at 100.) As an example of what might be covered,\ndefense counsel suggested \"if a person needs certain treatment so that they can be free from unreasonable\nrestraints, yes, that is part of what Youngberg dictates.\" (Id.) Or, if a person has a tumor, there may be a some\nduty to act if the person \"may not be safe, depending on the invasiveness of the tumor.\" (Id. at 101.) Not only is it\nincomprehensible that an involuntarily committed developmentally disabled person is not entitled to more than\ncounsel's meaningless and inadequate level of care, but counsel's inability to provide any workable definition\nillustrates the inherent difficulty prescribing in the abstract what services are required so that a constitutionally\nprotected right will be something more than a hollow promise.\n[36] During oral argument, the Court asked defense counsel whether it mattered if \"the healthcare provider's\nrecommendations as to the class members are not implemented in a timely manner,\" to which counsel\nresponded, \"I don't think Youngberg speaks to the timeliness of the matter.\" (12/17/09 Tr. at 103.)\n[37] As noted by Judge Hogan, 701 F.Supp.2d at 100-1, 2010 WL 1270202, at *13, the D.C. Circuit in LaShawn\nupheld a decree even assuming that it \"imposes requirements beyond those of District law.\" LaShawn A. v. Barry,\nNo. 94-7044, 1996 WL 679301, at *1 (D.C.Cir. Oct. 30, 1996).\n[38] Even without consent, a court may impose a remedy that goes beyond ordering defendants to satisfy the\nconstitutional floor. Federal court decrees \"exceed appropriate limits if they are aimed at eliminating a condition\nthat does not violate the Constitution or does not flow from such a violation,\" Milliken, 433 U.S. at 282, 97 S.Ct.\n2749, but \"where ... a constitutional violation has been found, the remedy does not `exceed' the violation if the\nremedy is tailored to cure the condition that offends the Constitution.\" Id. (quotation omitted). For example, in \nMilliken, \"[t]he `condition' offending the Constitution is Detroit's de jure segregated school system, which was so\npervasively and persistently segregated that the District Court found that the need for the educational\ncomponents flowed directly from constitutional violations by both state and local officials. These specific\neducational remedies, although normally left to the discretion of the elected school board and professional\neducators, were deemed necessary to restore the victims of discriminatory conduct to the position they would\nhave enjoyed in terms of education had these four components been provided in a nondiscriminatory manner in a\nschool system free from pervasive de jure racial segregation.\" Id.\n\nSignificantly, this same principle was adopted in Horne, where the Court recognized that federal court decrees\nare not limited to the constitutional floor in awarding relief for a violation of law. Rather, federal court decrees do\nnot \"exceed appropriate limits if they are aimed at eliminating a condition that ... flow[s] from such a violation.\" \nSee Horne, 129 S.Ct. at 2595.\n[39] As noted by the Supreme Court in Local No. 93:\nParties may choose to settle their disputes by consent decree rather than by private contract for a number of\nreasons. As one commentator points out, [p]ublic law settlements are often complicated documents designed to\nbe carried out over a period of years, ... so any purely out-of-court settlement would suffer the decisive handicap\nof not being subject to continuing oversight and interpretation by the court.... A consent decree has several other\nadvantages as a means of settling litigation. It is easier to obtain enforcement of a consent decree because it will\nbe unnecessary to prove many facts that would otherwise have to be shown in order to establish the validity of an\nordinary contract. A court that maintains continuing jurisdiction over a consent decree will have a more flexible\nrepertoire of enforcement measures. And it is likely to be easier to channel litigation concerning the validity and\nimplications of a consent decree into a single forum-the court that entered the decree-thus avoiding the waste of\nresources and the risk of inconsistent or conflicting obligations.... For all of these reasons, consent decrees have\nbecome widely used as devices to facilitate settlement.\n478 U.S. at 524 n. 13 (quotations and citations omitted).\n[40] Notably, Clarence Sundram was the Special Master in Harvey, which had a similar factual history to our\ncase. One key difference, though, is that in his final report to the district court, Special Master Sundram\nconcluded that the defendants were in compliance and the time was ripe for a Rule 60(b)(5) motion to vacate the\nconsent decree. See Final Report of the Special Master, Consumer Advisory Bd. v. Harvey, 2009 WL 5792159, at\n*11-*12 (D.Me. Oct. 9, 2009).\n[41] As explained by defense counsel: \nMS. EFROS: I think what matters is, looking at it today, this is not something that this administration embraces. It\nis not something that this administration necessarily needs to embrace.\nTHE COURT: It does as long as the orders exist. I'm sorry to tell you that. You may not like to embrace it happily,\nbut there are Court orders out there.\nMS. EFROS: That is the purpose of our motion today.\nTHE COURT: Sure.\nMS. EFROS: If you deny our motion, then we're left with an appeal or conforming to the Court order. But the very\npurpose of our motion today is to say that these orders should be vacated.\nTHE COURT: Yes. But until and unless they are, you are, I hope, agreeing they bind you?\nMS. EFROS: Until they are vacated, we are not consciously ignoring any Court order.\nTHE COURT: Well, that's not much of a consolation. All you are saying is you are not intentionally committing\ncontempt of Court.\n(12/17/09 Tr. at 20-21.)\n[42] While defendants refer to the obligations imposed on the District as having become ever more \"exacting and\nonerous\" (Defs.' Mot. to Vacate at 2), it is unclear whether defendants argue that any circumstance or obstacle\nmakes the decree \"unworkable\" or \"substantially more onerous.\" Rufo, 502 U.S. at 384, 112 S.Ct. 748; see also \nNLRB v. Harris Teeter Supermarkets, 215 F.3d 32, 36 (D.C.Cir.2000) (\"Compliance over an extended period of\ntime is not in and of itself sufficient to warrant relief.... [P]arties who have successfully sought modification have\nalso established events or changed circumstances which `make compliance with the decree substantially more\nonerous,' make the decree `unworkable because of unforeseen obstacles,' or make `enforcement [of the decree]\n\ndetrimental to the public interest.'\"). But of course, Rufo teaches that \"[i]nternal compliance mechanisms\ninstituted to effectuate the decree ... and hurdles inherent in a consent decree's entry do not count as `obstacles.'\n\"Harris Teeter Supermarkets, 215 F.3d at 35-36 (citing Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391, 112 S.Ct. 748). Moreover, other\nthan a reference to the District's financial situation (see infra note 43), defendants, as in LaShawn, 701 F.Supp.2d\nat 101-2, 2010 WL 1270202, at *14, provide no substance to their conclusory claim that the consent decrees and\n2001 Plan should be viewed as \"exacting and onerous.\"\n[43] Defendants also argue in passing that the Court must take account of the District's dire economic climate\nand budget shortfall of $583.5 million. (Defs.' Mem. at 54.) But defendants do not complain about the costs of\nproviding services to the class members, but rather they want to be relieved of the costs associated with the\nSpecial Masters, the Court Monitor, the Quality Trust, and the attorneys' fees incurred in litigating this case. (Id. at\n55.) While \"[f]inancial constraints may not be used to justify the creation or perpetuation of constitutional\nviolations, ... they are a legitimate concern of government defendants in institutional reform litigation and\ntherefore are appropriately considered in tailoring a consent decree modification.\" Rufo, 502 U.S. at 392-93, 112\nS.Ct. 748. However, in this case, as in LaShawn, 701 F.Supp.2d at 101-2, 2010 WL 1270202, at *14, defendants\nhave failed to demonstrate that financial circumstances warrant modification. \nMost importantly, the District's lengthy history of intransigence and noncompliance have been the major factors in\nthe increased need for monitoring, reliance on Special Masters, and the large costs and fees incurred by plaintiffs\nand their counsel. Second, the funding of the Quality Trust has almost been completed and is arguably not within\nthe Court's power to modify; the responsibilities of the Special Masters have declined; and the Monitor returned\nover $180,000 of her budget in an effort to reduce costs. (12/17/09 Tr. at 115.) Third, this litigation has actually\nresulted in cost savings for the District, since as a result of the efforts of the Court, the plaintiffs, and the Special\nMasters, many class members and DDA customers have been put on the waiver, thereby shifting costs from the\nDistrict to the federal government. (Id. at 27-28.) This effort, while now reaching fruition (see supra p. 161), was\nstarted long before this administration and thus can hardly be credited only to the efforts of the current\nleadership. Fourth, as Judge Hogan held, the costs of monitoring are not properly considered to be obstacles. \nLaShawn, 701 F.Supp.2d at 101-2, 2010 WL 1270202, at *14 (citing Agostini, 521 U.S. at 216, 117 S.Ct. 1997\n(holding that anticipated costs of compliance with an injunctive order are not changed circumstances under Rufo\n)). Fifth, defendants do not address the impact from the three-year multi-million dollar grant the District received\nfrom CMS in July 2008 via its \"Money Follows the Person Rebalancing Demonstration Program\" (Defs.' Mem. at\n27) or the \"Medicaid Infrastructure Grant,\" that was \"awarded to DHCF by CMS to improve the DDA's day and\nvocational service system.\" (Defs.' Mem. re Alternate Remedy at 7.) Finally, if financial concerns are truly a\nproblem, it is incumbent on the District to propose a specific modification for addressing the shortfall, as opposed\nto advocating for wholesale dismissal of the case so that the District can escape future court supervision and\nindependent monitoring.\n[44] (See Pls.' Opp'n, Ex. 27 (charting flow of orders, starting with the rights recognized in the 1978 Consent\nOrder and then identifying the remedial actions defendants were ordered to take to remedy the violations of those\nrights).)\n[45] Defendants also refer to the fact that \"the District has recruited high-quality and dedicated leadership for the\nnew agency\" (Defs.' Mem. at 38), which is clearly an important development in this case given the often\ninadequate and transitory nature of management over the last 30 years. However, as defense counsel conceded\nduring argument, a \"durable\" remedy cannot depend on the retention of particular personnel. (12/17/09 Tr. at 29\n(\"I don't think it does depend on Ms. Nuss staying, although we certainly want Ms. Nuss to stay\").) Indeed,\ndefendants' recent filing suggests that if the Court imposes the remedy recommended in the 2009 Special\nMasters' Report, Ms. Nuss will decline to remain in her job. (See Defs.' Mem. re Alternate Remedy at 3-8.)\n[46] Similar arguments were raised by the District and rejected by LaShawn, 701 F.Supp.2d at 101-2, 2010 WL\n1270202, at *13-*14 and by the D.C. Circuit in Harris Teeter, 215 F.3d at 36, where the Court refused to terminate\na consent decree even though defendant had instituted personnel changes and an internal reorganization.\n[47] Even in their latest filing, defendants acknowledges that there are remaining systemic weaknesses specific\nto the District's IDD system: access to high-quality behavioral health services; clinical services, including physical\ntherapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT), speech therapy (SPL), and nutrition services; and transformation of the\n\nlegacy facility-based day services to person-centered habilitation and vocational-preparation programs that\nprovide quality habilitative, vocational and community-integrated services appropriate to each consumer's needs\nand preferences. \n(Defs.' Mem. re Alternate Remedy at 11-12.)\n[48] According to defendants, \nany person brought before the Court (to be admitted or committed to DDS/DDA) has a right to be represented by\nretained or appointed counsel. See SCR-MRP 11; see also D.C OFFICIAL CODE § 7-1304.12(2) (authorizing\nfees to be a paid to appointed counsel). Moreover, any interested party has the right to initiate an action in\nSuperior Court to compel DDS to accord persons with IDD the rights afforded them under District law. D.C\nOFFICIAL CODE § 7-1305.13(a). Indeed, each person committed to DDS/DDA supervision is entitled to an\nannual judicial hearing to determine whether the person has \"benefitted from... habilitation.\" Id. at § 1304.11(a)\n(1). These procedures conclusively demonstrate that members of the Evans class have an adequate remedy at\nlaw for any potential future failure by the District to provide them with appropriate treatment.\n(Defs.' Mem. at 43-44.)\n[49]See The Mentally Retarded Citizens Constitutional Rights and Dignity Act of 1978, effective March 3, 1979\n(D.C. Law 2-137; D.C. Official Code § 7-1301.02 33 et seq.).\n[50] Of course, prior to CMS issuing its Letter of March 9, 2009, the District had been put on a \"corrective action\nplan\"00a program of intensified monitoring00due to the fact that the District failed to substantially meet three of the\n97 97\nsix waiver assurances. (Defs. Mem., Ex. 19; see also Court Monitor Rep. at 27, Jan. 26, 2007.)\n[51] The District's proposed alternate remedy, set forth in a motion filed just days ago (see supra note 2), the\nQuality Trust's responsibility for on-the-ground monitoring appears to have shrunk and it is now described as an\n\"active[] members of oversight committees that review findings generated by these systems and initiatives and\ncontribute to recommendations for improvements going forward.\" (Defs.' Mem. re Alternate Remedy at 13.)\nObviously, if its remedy were to be adopted, the Quality Trust's role (despite the District's obligation to fund it with\nover $30 million) would be reduced to \"ad hoc monitoring.\" (Id., Ex. A at 7.)\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Fenty,” (“2010 Plan”),1 the Special Master, Clarence J. Sundram, has submitted a \nReport and Recommendation regarding the “Certification of Compliance” submitted by the \nDirector of the Department of Disability Services (“DDS”) as to the remaining seven outcome \ncriteria for Goal B – Consumers Must Be Kept Free From Harm.  (Special Master’s Report and \nRecommendation Regarding Protection from Harm – Part II, Apr. 4, 2014 [ECF No. 1457] \n(“R&R”).)  As explained herein, the Court agrees with the Special Master that defendants have \nachieved compliance with six of the remaining criteria (i, ii, iii, iv, v, and viii), but have not \ndemonstrated compliance with criterion xii.     \n                                                 \n1 The 2010 Plan was filed on July 13, 2010 [ECF No. 1200], and approved on August 10, 2010 \n[ECF No. 1204]. \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1490   Filed 09/10/14   Page 2 of 11\nBACKGROUND \n \n  The 2010 Plan groups existing court orders into nine subject areas.  For each area, the \nPlan sets forth “specific outcome criteria for determining compliance with the related group of \nCourt Orders,” assigns a standard of compliance (full, high, or significant), and “identifies the \nmethod by which the Special Master, and ultimately the Court, will assess compliance for each \nset of outcome criteria.”  (2010 Plan at 5-6.)  For Goal B–Consumers Must Be Kept Free From \nHarm, the 2010 Plan identifies two related court orders and sets forth twelve specific outcome \ncriteria as to which defendants must meet a “high” standard of compliance.2  (2010 Plan at 20-\n21.)  The related court orders require that: \ni.   Acts of physical or psychological abuse, neglect or mistreatment including \nbut not limited to assaults, fractures, cuts, bruises, abrasions, burns, bites, \nlacerations, drug overdoses and verbal abuse are prohibited.  (1978 Final \nJudgment and Order, section III.14.a) \n \nii.   Each and every alleged incident of abuse, neglect, or mistreatment shall be \npromptly investigated and a report made.  The manner and mechanism of \nsuch investigation shall be developed and established by the defendants.  \nA chronological compilation of the above reports shall be maintained by \nthe defendants and made available to the Master and the parties. (1978 \nFinal Judgment and Order, section III.14.a). \n \n                                                 \n2 “High Compliance” is defined in the 2010 Plan as follows: \nThis threshold requires compliance with the indicator at a rate generally \nexceeding 90 percent  compliance.  Where instances of noncompliance with the \nindicator are found, none can involve a serious and substantive violation of the \nCourt Order with significant adverse impact upon class members (i.e., actual harm \nor a serious risk of harm) in the judgment of the Court and Special Master (e.g., \nexcusable noncompliance may involve failure to comply with documentation or \nsome aspect of process, without significant adverse impact).  Generally speaking, \nthis level of compliance will be expected for important programmatic aspects of \nthe Court Orders. \n(2010 Plan at 6.) \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1490   Filed 09/10/14   Page 3 of 11\n(2010 Plan at 20.)   The twelve outcome criteria that defendants must satisfy for the Court to find \ncompliance with Goal B are: \ni.  All incidents (as defined in District of Columbia regulations and \npolicies) are reported in accordance with the policy. Abuse, neglect and \nmistreatment are clearly prohibited by defendants’ policies and \nprocedures. \n \nii. Family members and/or guardians, the Court Monitor and the Quality \n          \nTrust are notified of all serious incidents (as defined in the District of \nColumbia policies) within 24 hours of the defendants becoming aware \nof such incidents. \n \niii.  All serious incidents are reported within the timeframe established by \nthe policies, and thoroughly investigated by trained investigators. All \nother incidents are investigated in accordance with the policy \nrequirements. \n \niv.     Investigation reports identify appropriate preventive, corrective and \ndisciplinary actions needed to protect [DDA] consumers from harm. \n \nv.       All serious incident investigation reports are reviewed by quality \nassurance staff in DDS/DDA. All other incidents are reviewed for \npatterns and trends by quality assurance staff in DDA and the Quality \nImprovement Committee. \n \nvi.   All deaths are reported to and reviewed by the Fatality Review \nCommittee. \n \nvii.   Recommendations from the Fatality Review Committee for preventive and \ncorrective actions are followed up, implemented and documented. \n \nviii.    For all serious incidents, case managers follow up on recommendations \nand ensure that there is prompt implementation of appropriate \npreventive, corrective or disciplinary action, and document their actions.  \nFor all incidents, case managers follow up to ensure that all consumers \nare safe and protected from harm.   Based upon the quality assurance \nreview of patterns and trends of consumer incidents, DDS/DDA shall \nensure that there is prompt implementation of whatever preventive, \ncorrective or disciplinary actions are necessary to protect the consumers \nfrom harm. \n \nix.   The appropriate licensing/contracting agency is informed of all serious \nincidents and of the outcomes and recommendations for preventive and \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1490   Filed 09/10/14   Page 4 of 11\ncorrective action from all investigations, and has taken appropriate action \nfor prevention and correction. \n \nx.  The Court Monitor and the Quality Trust have received incident reports of \nall serious incidents and all the final investigation reports, as well as all \nrecommendations for preventive and corrective action. Each quarter, the \nCourt Monitor and the Quality Trust have received aggregate reports on \npatterns and trends for all other incidents. \n \nxi.   Incident reporting is on-line in 90 percent of residential and day treatment \nprovider sites. \n \nxii.  In the event that private providers do not comply with these \nperformance expectations, appropriate authorities within the District \ngovernment will take whatever immediate actions are necessary to \nprotect consumers, and take such further actions as may be necessary to \ncorrect the deficiency, including but not limited to the provision of \ntraining or technical assistance to provider staff, and/or the imposition of \nsanctions designed to assure compliance, including, where necessary, \ntermination of provider agreements, contracts and licenses. \n \n(2010 Plan at 20-21.) \n  Outcome criteria vi, vii, ix, x, and xi were covered by an earlier report and \nrecommendation.  (See Special Master’s Report and Recommendation regarding Protection from \nHarm, Aug. 15, 2013 [ECF No. 1402].)  The Special Master concluded that defendants had \nsatisfied those criteria, plaintiffs filed no objections, and the Court adopted the report and \nrecommendation.  (See Order, Sept. 16, 2013 [ECF No. 1412].)   \n  As for the seven remaining Goal B outcome criteria, the certification process began on \nOctober 28, 2013, when the Independent Compliance Administrator (“ICA”) notified the parties, \nthe Court Monitor, and the Special Master that the DDS Director intended to file a certification \nof compliance for those criteria in 60 days.3 After the Court Monitor and the parties completed \n                                                 \n3 After the adoption of the 2010 Plan, the Special Master established procedures for the DDS \nDirector to certify compliance with outcome criteria, for his review of that certification and \nsubmission of a report and recommendation to the Court, and for the parties to submit to the \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1490   Filed 09/10/14   Page 5 of 11\nthe required discussion on methodology,4 the Court Monitor, the Quality Trust and the Joint \nMonitoring Team began their review.  (See Court Monitor’s Report, Review of Goal B: \n                                                                                                                                                             \nCourt any objections to the report and recommendation.   (See Procedure for Director’s \nCertification of Compliance, Aug. 14, 2012 [ECF No. 1332] (“Certification Procedure”).)  In \nbrief, the certification process begins when the Independent Compliance Administrator (“ICA”) \nnotifies the Court Monitor that defendants intend to certify compliance with a specified area of \nthe 2010 Plan in 60 days.  (Id. ¶ 1.)  The Court Monitor then confers with the parties “to discuss \nand reach agreement on the methods to be employed in the Joint Monitoring in assessing \ndefendants’ compliance.”  (Id. ¶ 2.)  The Joint Monitoring, which is conducted jointly by the \nOffice of the Court Monitor, DDS staff, and the Quality Trust, must “adhere to compliance \nmeasurement criteria and methodology as set forth in the 2010 Plan.”  (Id. ¶ 3.)  After the Joint \nMonitoring is completed, the Court Monitor prepares a written report summarizing the findings, \nwhich is provided to the parties, the Special Master and the ICA.  (Id.)  The DDS Director may \nthen file its Certification of Compliance with the Special Master.  (Id. ¶ 4.)  Although the parties \nhave agreed that the results of joint monitoring activities will be the primary method for \nevidencing compliance, the certification may include “additional relevant evidence drawn from \nvarious sources including [defendants’] data systems, and licensing, certification and monitoring \nactivities.”  (See 2010 Plan at 7.)  Plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor have 30 days to file any \nresponse to the certification (Certification Procedure ¶ 7), and then the Special Master prepares a \nreport for the Court with “findings of fact, conclusions and recommendations.”  (Id. ¶ 10.)  The \nparties have 30 days to file objections to the Special Master’s report in accordance with Section \nV of the Supplemental Order of Reference.  (Id. ¶ 11.) \n4 For the Goal B outcome criteria, the 2010 Plan provides three methods for assessing \ncompliance: \ni.  Review a 10 percent random sample of serious and other incident reports \nand the related investigations, Quality Assurance documents, Human \nRights Committee minutes, reports to the Quality Trust, documentation of \ncase manager follow up of the implementation of recommendations, and \ndocumentation of the implementation of sanctions where warranted.  \n \nii.  Interview case managers and advocates assigned to the consumers \ninvolved in the incidents in the sample above, regarding compliance with \nthe policy. \n \niii.  Review documents and interview staff at a 10 percent sample of \nresidential and day program sites to ensure that all incidents are being \nreported in compliance with the policy. \nFor method (i), the parties and Court Monitor agreed that the 10% sample of serious and other \nincident reports “would focus only on Serious Reportable Incidents, as defined in District \npolicies,” “that the incident investigations would have been completed between June 1, 2013 and \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1490   Filed 09/10/14   Page 6 of 11\nProtection From Harm, Jan. 17, 2014 (amended Jan. 24, 2014)) [ECF 1457-3] (“Joint Monitoring \nReport”)).)  The final Joint Monitoring Report was provided to defendants on January 24, 2014, \nand the DDS Director submitted a certification of compliance for Goal B outcome criteria i, ii, \niii, iv, v, viii, and xii on January 31, 2014.  (Director’s Certification of Compliance, Jan. 31, 2014 \n[ECF No. 1457-1] (“Certification”).)  Plaintiffs’ response agreed that defendants had achieved \ncompliance with criteria i through v, but challenged the certification as to criteria viii and xii.  \n(Pls.’ Resp. to Certification, Mar. 4, 2014 [ECF 1457-2].)   \n  Based on the evidence before him, the Special Master concluded that defendants had \nachieved compliance with all of the remaining Goal B outcome criteria, except criterion xii.   \n(R&R at 13.)  No objections have been filed to his recommendation that defendants be found in \ncompliance with criteria i-v and viii.  As for criterion xii, defendants raise several objections to \nthe Special Master’s analysis and have asked the Court to find compliance based on their \n“substantive  arguments and objections to the Report and Recommendation asserted in this \n                                                                                                                                                             \nOctober 28, 2013,” and “that twenty-six incident investigations would be randomly selected for \nreview from this time period.”  (Joint Monitoring Report at 3.)  They did not agree on the scope \nof “Quality Assurance documents to be reviewed,” and “the Court Monitor made the decision to \nreview HRLA documents for a period of twelve months (October 28, 2012 to October 28, 2013) \nin order to ensure sufficient documentation for review.”  (Id.)  Defendants objected to this \ndecision, but provided the necessary documents to the Court Monitor.  (Id.)  For method (ii), the \nparties and Court Monitor agreed that service coordinators (“case managers” is the term used in \nthe 2010 Plan) would be asked three questions from the Joint Monitoring Questionnaire.  (Id.)  \nThe parties and the Court Monitor discussed the questions to be asked of “advocates” (e.g. \nfamily members, guardians, attorneys), but the Court Monitor made the final decision on those \nquestions.  (Id.)  For method (iii), the parties and the Court Monitor agreed “that the 10% sample \nof residential sites would not include natural homes and that the 10% sample of day program \nsites would not include supported employment.”  (Id.) \n \n   \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1490   Filed 09/10/14   Page 7 of 11\nfiling,” their “Certification and the evidence submitted in support thereof,” and the “evidence of \ncompliance in this filing.”  (Defs.’ Objections to the Special Master’s Report and \nRecommendation Regarding Protection From Harm – Part II, at 6, May 5, 2014 [ECF No. 1463] \n(“Defs.’ Objs.”).)  Plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenors filed a response to defendants’ objections, \nagreeing with the Special Master’s recommendation.  (Pls.’ & Pl.-Intervenor’s Resp. to Defs.’ \nObjs. at 4, May 14, 2014 [ECF No. 1465] (“Pls.’ Resp. to Objs.”).)  The Court’s review of the \nSpecial Master’s recommendation as to criterion xii is de novo.   (See 2007 Supplemental Order \nof Reference ¶ (V)(4) at 4, May 3, 2007 [ECF No. 920] (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 53(f)(3)).) \nANALYSIS \n  In light of the parties’ agreement as to Goal B outcome criteria i-v and viii, the sole issue \nfor the Court to address is whether defendants have established compliance with criterion xii.  \nCriterion xii provides: \nIn the event that private providers do not comply with these performance \nexpectations, appropriate authorities within the District government will take \nwhatever immediate actions are necessary to protect consumers, and take such \nfurther actions as may be necessary to correct the deficiency, including but not \nlimited to the provision of training or technical assistance to provider staff, \nand/or the imposition of sanctions designed to assure compliance, including, \nwhere necessary, termination of provider agreements, contracts and licenses. \n \nIn analyzing what this criterion requires, the Special Master concluded that “to support a finding \nof compliance,” there “must be evidence that when confronted with persistent deficiencies, \n[d]efendants are vigilant in using the tools at their disposal to improve provider performance” \nand that “the tools themselves must be tools that work effectively to produce the desired result \nwithin a reasonably prompt time, given the severity of the problem to be corrected.”  (R&R at \n13.)  Applying this standard, the Special Master concluded that defendants “have failed to carry \ntheir burden of proof of compliance” because even though they have “implemented several \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1490   Filed 09/10/14   Page 8 of 11\nsystems for enforcement of their expectations for providers” and “taken a variety of enforcement \nactions of varying levels of severity when confronted with deficient practices by providers,” “the \nevidence does not demonstrate the effectiveness of these systems in correcting deficiencies that \naffect a substantial number of class members’ interests in protection from harm.”  (Id.)      \n  In their objections, defendants argue that the Special Master has read Goal B outcome \ncriterion xii “far too broadly.”  As they see it, he has read it “to encompass any provider \ndeficiency such that the defendants’ actions and sanctions activities are deemed ‘ineffective’ \nbecause poorly performing providers continue to provide services to class members.”  (Defs.’ \nObjs. at 6.)  Although the Court agrees that such a reading would be too broad, it does not \nbelieve that defendants have accurately characterized the Special Master’s interpretation.   In his \nReport and Recommendation, the Special Master expressly limits criterion xii to deficiencies \nrelating to the overall goal of protection from harm.  (See R&R at 10 (criterion xii “describes the \nobligation of the [d]efendants for enforcement actions to ensure that providers meet the \nperformance expectations laid out in law and policy for protecting class members from harm” \n(emphasis added).)  And while the Court agrees with defendants that the “performance \nexpectations” referenced in criterion xii must be read in light of the requirements of criteria i-xi \nand the “incident management system” addressed therein (see Defs.’ Objs. at 8), those \nexpectations should also be construed in light of Goal B’s overall goal of protection from harm \nand the related orders it seeks to implement.  As defendants themselves recognize, Goal B \n“addresses the sufficiency and efficacy of DDS’s incident management system” (id. at 6 \n(emphasis added)), and “the overarching ‘core interest of class members’ in Goal B is to ensure \nthat incidents of abuse, neglect and mistreatment are reported, investigated, and reviewed, that \nrecommendations are followed up by the appropriate entity, and that providers who fail to meet \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1490   Filed 09/10/14   Page 9 of 11\n‘these performance expectations’ are subjected to action to ‘assure compliance.’”  (Id. at 8 \n(quoting R&R at 9-10) (emphasis added).)  The Special Master’s interpretation of criterion xii \naccounts for all of these goals while respecting the parameters of Goal B.  Accordingly, the \nCourt does not agree with defendants that the Special Master’s interpretation “requir[es] more \nthan contemplated by Goal B outcome criterion xii.”  (Id. at 9.) \n  Defendants also object to the Special Master’s conclusion that they have not met their \nburden of showing compliance with criterion xii.  Although the record before Court includes \nevidence that was not before the Special Master,5 the Court reaches the same conclusion.  In \norder for defendants to demonstrate compliance with criterion xii, the record must answer the \nfollowing question: are there current providers whose deficiencies persist and against whom \ndefendants have not taken appropriate action.  The record before the Court and arguments of the \nparties provide no satisfactory answer to this question.  For example, the Special Master and \nplaintiffs rely heavily on the District’s handling of a former provider, IDI, as evidence that they \nhave not proven compliance.  (R&R at 11-12; Pls.’ Resp. to Certification at 7.)  However, IDI is \nno longer a provider and, while defendants’ past actions are not irrelevant, defendants must be \nallowed to rely on current facts to demonstrate compliance.  Another point emphasized by both \nthe Special Master and plaintiffs is that after class members who were served by IDI transitioned \nto new providers, the problems did not disappear.  However, while the change in providers was \nnot a quick “fix,” defendants closely monitored the post-transition situation and the most recent \ndata from the Court Monitor (which was not before the Special Master) shows marked \nimprovement.  (See Court Monitor’s Report to the Court at 4-7, June 9, 2014 [ECF No. 1468] \n                                                 \n5 Defendants attached to their objections to the Special Master’s Report and Recommendation \ncopies of a number of official policies and procedures.  (See Defs.’ Objs. Exs. 1-12.)   \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1490   Filed 09/10/14   Page 10 of 11\n(noting that while “continuation of onsite monitoring is essential,” defendants have taken “a \nnumber of actions to address the continuing deficiencies” previously identified by the Court \nMonitor and those actions “have resulted in commendable progress”).) \n  In the end, in order for defendants to prove that they are taking effective action against \nproviders (who are deficient with respect to the goal of protection from harm), the record must \ninclude data showing what deficiencies that have been recently identified among current \nproviders have led to sanctions, and what sanctions, if any, have been imposed, and the efficacy \nof the sanctions imposed.  In addition, plaintiffs first must identify who are the current providers \nthat they consider deficient and against whom they believe defendants have failed to take \nnecessary action, what action(s) should have been taken and when, and if there are existing \nproviders whom plaintiffs believe should be terminated, who are those providers.   \nCONCLUSION \n  Accordingly, upon consideration of the Special Master’s Report and Recommendation, \nand the entire record herein, it is hereby \n  ORDERED that the Court APPROVES AND ADOPTS the Special Master’s Report \nand Recommendation Regarding Protection From Harm – Part II [ECF No. 1457]; and it is \nfurther  \n  ORDERED that defendants have achieved compliance with Goal B outcome criteria i, ii, \niii, iv, v, and viii; and it is further \n  ORDERED that defendants have not yet demonstrated compliance with Goal B outcome \ncriterion xii.  The issue of defendants’ compliance with criterion xii is returned to the Special \nMaster to allow him to consult with the parties, the ICA, and the Court Monitor and to develop a \n   \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1490   Filed 09/10/14   Page 11 of 11\nplan, in accordance with the foregoing opinion, for defendants to resubmit their certification as to \ncriterion xii. \n \n \n/s/    Ellen Segal Huvelle     \n  ELLEN SEGAL HUVELLE \n  United States District Judge \n \nDate:  September 10, 2014 \n11 \n ",

FENTY, et al.,  ) \n_______________________ \nDefendants.  ) \n) \nDECLARATION OF LAURA L. NUSS \nI, Laura L. Nuss, declare and state as follows: \n1.  I am competent to testify to the matters set forth herein, and testify based on \npersonal knowledge, information and belief. \nI.  Background Information \n2.  I hold a Bachelor of Science in Administration of Justice (1981) and a Master of \nScience in Community Systems Planning and Development (1987), both from the Pennsylvania \nState University. \n3.  My experience in the field oflntellectual and Developmental Disability (\"IDD\") \nincludes learning from the perspective of a family member, private provider and state \ngovernment official.  Specifically, in addition to growing up with my Aunt who had a \ndevelopmental disability, I served as her personal representative and health care decision maker \nfor the last 20 years of her life. \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 3 of 26\n4.  The first 15 years of my professional career in this field were spent working for \nprivate organizations developing and operating small community-based residential (ICF/MR and \nHCBS waiver funded settings) and vocational services for individuals leaving the Pennhurst \nState School and Hospital and the Embreeville State School and Hospital, and for adults who \nsought or needed supports outside of the family home.  I also served on family and consumer \nsatisfaction survey teams through the Embreeville Consumer/Family Satisfaction Teams project. \n5.  I then moved to state government, serving three years as Branch Chief for the \nNorth Carolina Developmental Disabilities Administration, responsible for the management of \nthe DD Home and Community-Based Services (\"HCBS\") waiver serving 6,000 individuals with \na total operating budget of$300 million, department budget matters for a $650 million state \nagency serving 12,000 individuals, and systems change initiatives.  In that capacity, I \nparticipated in the design and submission of the DD HCBS waiver renewal and rate setting \ninitiatives. \n6.  In the state of Connecticut, I served one year as a Connecticut Department of \nMental Retardation Regional Director with comprehensive responsibilities for all case \nmanagement, family support, and private and public residential and vocational services serving \n3,000 individuals with an operating budget of $85 million.  I then served as the state-wide \nDirector of Strategic Leadership for four years with responsibility for the state Medicaid HCBS \nwaivers, Quality Assurance and Improvement, Staff Development, and Planning and Information \nTechnology for the department with a total operating budget of$900 million serving 19,000 \nindividuals.  During that tenure, I re-wrote the \"Comprehensive\" MR/DD waiver for \nConnecticut to include self-determination, and wrote a second \"Supports\" waiver to introduce \ninnovative in-home and self-directed services for individuals served by the Department, the tenth \n2 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 4 of 26\nsuch waiver approved in the country to be designated as an Independence Plus waiver.  I co \nwrote and served as the co-principal investigator for two CMS Systems Change Grants in the \namount of$675,000 over a three-year period under the Independence Plus and the Quality \nAssurance/Quality Improvement under the federal systems change initiatives.  Additionally, I \nplayed an instrumental role in the settlement of a class action \"Waiting List\" lawsuit by assisting \nwith the design of a budget initiative totaling $12 million of state funds over a five-year period to \nserve an additional 750 persons off of the DD waiting list. \n7.  I have also served as a consultant on Medicaid waiver and quality assurance, and, \nin that capacity, co-wrote the District of Columbia (\"District\") DD Medicaid HCBS waiver \nrenewal approved in November 2007.  I have presented extensively at professional meetings \nnationally on quality assurance and improvement designs to meet the CMS Quality Framework \nrequirements, Medicaid waivers, Individual Budgeting and Allocation methodologies, and Self \nDetermination subject matter. \n8.  I was appointed as the Deputy Director of the Department on Disability Services \n(\"DDS\"), responsible for the Developmental Disabilities Administration (\"DDA''), formerly \nknown as the Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Administration (\"MRDDA\"), \neffective August 20, 2007. \nII.  Service Coordination/Individual Service Plans \n9.  DDS/DDA currently employs 71 service coordinators, who are tasked with, \namong other things, meeting at least annually with individual consumers, their families and/or \nsignificant others, and their providers, to gather information in order to develop each consumer's \nIndividual Service Plan (\"ISP\"). \n3 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 5 of 26\n10.  The ISP can be revised or updated more frequently than annually to ensure that \nchanges in an individual's condition and/or needs are taken into consideration in providing \nservices and treatment. \n11.  On a quarterly basis for the past two years, between 86% and 98% of class \nmembers have met personally with their service coordinators.  ISPs have been completed on a \ntimely basis for class members on average 90% of the time for the past two years. \n12.  For the past six (6) years, DDS/DDA has maintained a ratio of one service \ncoordinator to no more than 30 individuals (class and non-class members). \n13.  In October 2008, DDS/DDA designed and implemented a new ISP format that is \nbuilt on best practice and organized around the same eight (8) domains that are used throughout \nthe District's planning and performance measurement systems:  rights and dignity; safety and \nsecurity; health and wellness; choice and decision-making; community inclusion; relationships; \nservice planning and delivery; and satisfaction.  The ISP itself is now an on-line document that is \ncompleted, reviewed, approved, and disseminated via the web application. \n14.  DDA service coordinators facilitate ISPs meetings and complete the document for \nall class members regardless of where he or she lives.  DDA service coordinators assumed this \nresponsibility for individuals residing in HCBS waiver settings on October 2, 2008 and for \nindividuals residing in ICF /ID settings on August 1, 2009 as planned. \nIII.  Home and Community-Based Services Waiver \n15.  DDA's implementation of the Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services \n(\"HCBS\") waiver has enabled the District to redesign its service system to provide expanded \nintegrated-living alternatives and services to consumers. \n4 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 6 of 26\n16.  Through the waiver program, the District is eligible for a federal reimbursement \nof 70%, which has the effect of maximizing more limited local dollars while simultaneously \nproviding more services and supports to the consumers who need them. \n17.  The HCBS waiver is comprised of the following: Professional Services-\nincluding speech, hearing, or language services, occupational and physical therapy, skilled \nnursing, behavior supports, and less traditional therapy such as dance or drama therapy; \nAssistive Supports-including emergency response, vehicle modification, and environmental \nadaptation (such as the addition of ramps or grab bars) without which an individual might need \nto be institutionalized; Residential Supports- including residential habilitation (housing 4-6 \nindividuals), supported living (housing 1-3 individuals), and in-home support or live-in \ncaregivers that allow a person to live as independently as possible; and Day Supports-including \nday habilitation to allow individuals to develop skills to support, or further, community \nintegration opportunities, as well as supported employment to enable an individual to live as \nautonomously as possible through an ability to earn income. \n18.  Each service under the HCBS waiver is available individually so that each \nindividual has the maximum amount of choice consistent with his or her general support, \nmedical, emotional, and/or physical needs. \n19.  In September 2008, the District of Columbia submitted an amendment to add \nskilled nursing and supported living with transportation services to the waiver menu.  The \namendment also sought to increase the payment rate for physical and occupation therapy and \nspeech and nutrition services in order to improve recruitment efforts of new clinicians to the \nprogram.  In April 2009, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (\"CMS\") approved the \namendment, which will be implemented with the passage of :final rulernaking in October 2009. \n5 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 7 of 26\n20.  The District continues to pursue refinements to the HCBS waiver program as part \nof self-directed continuous quality improvement.  During the summer of2009, the District \ncreated an HCBS Waiver Advisory Committee to solicit broad stakeholder participation and \ninput on proposed changes.  To date, this advisory committee has held three meetings that have \nled to the preparation of changes to the waiver in the following areas:  level of care; service \nplanning and delivery; services; qualifications of providers; health and welfare; fmancial \naccountability; administrative oversight; and quality management plan.  As DDA continues to \nenhance and refine its services, operations, policies and practices, those changes are \nsubsequently incorporated into the HCBS waiver application for approval by CMS, and to \ncontinually update CMS of enhancements in the quality management strategy of the District to \nmeet the six required assurances. \n21.  The District has demonstrated improvement in the provision of services under the \nISPs.  For example, for HCBS waiver participants, prior authorizations must be processed in a \ntimely manner in order for services to be offered consistent with the ISPs.  In fiscal year 2008, \nprior authorizations were issued late 70% of the time.  In only a year, the District dramatically \nimproved its performance such that in fiscal year 2009, prior authorizations were issued in \nadvance 70% of the time. \nIV.  Recruitment and Retention of Qualified Providers \n22.  Since January 2009, DDA has successfully recruited five (5) waiver providers, \nincreasing the total number of current waiver providers to 104.  Sixty-four ( 64) percent of all \nresidential services are currently delivered via the waiver program, and more than half of the \nEvans class is currently enrolled in the waiver. \n6 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 8 of 26\n23.  As of September 1, 2009, there are forty-two (4 2) Day Habilitation providers, \nthirty-eight (38) Pre-vocational Services providers, thirty-eight (38) Supported Employment \nproviders, ninety-one (91) Supported Living providers, ninety-four (94) Residential Habilitation \nproviders, forty-five (4 5) Host Home providers, twenty (20) Live-in Caregiver providers and \nsixteen (16) Professional Services providers enrolled in the HCBS waiver. \n24.  In February 2009, DDA developed and implemented a more robust enrollment \nprocess, namely the Provider Readiness Review Protocol, to review new provider applicants \nvigorously through a process of paper application, interview and on-site observation and review \nto ensure that new applicants in fact were prepared to serve DDA consumers effectively upon \nenrollment in the program.  Since the inception of the enhanced protocol, twenty-seven (27) \nproviders passed this process successfully, two (2) failed, and six (6) have been delayed due to \npoor performance in the review process.  This process significantly improves the process agreed \nupon in the \"September 12, 2007 90 Day Order\" as the District no longer needs to be concerned \nabout a sufficient number of providers, but does seek to continually raise the bar on the capacity \nof these provider organizations to deliver high quality services and supports. \n25.  The District through DDA and the Department of Health Care Finance (\"DHCF\") \nremoved three (3) providers from the waiver program in the past 12 months due to performance \ndeficits, providing further evidence that the District's ability and commitment to remove poorly \nperforming providers from the DDA service-delivery system. \nV.  Intermediate Care Facilities for the Intellectually Disabled \n26.  An intermediate care facility for the intellectually disabled (\"ICF/ID\") in the \nDistrict serves no more than eight (8) individuals and provides active treatment to those \nindividuals who require more intermediate levels of care.  To meet the needs of the extremely \n7 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 9 of 26\nmedically-complex and fragile persons who currently reside in hospital settings, DDA issued a \nRequest for Proposal (\"RFP\") for a small ICF/ID setting to effectively serve these individuals in \nthe community.  The RFP was awarded to Volunteers of America (\"VOA''), a national provider \nthat practices person-centered service delivery and specializes in serving medically complex \nindividuals in the District.  VOA believes inclusive, personalized services can also be delivered \nunder the ICF/ID model. \n27.  Many of the individuals served by ICFs/ID are non-ambulatory and have seizure \ndisorders, behavioral support needs, mental illness, visual or hearing impairments, chronic, \nsignificant health conditions or a combination of these. \n28. ·  While the District makes every effort to serve as many consumers as possible via \nthe waiver, this alternate housing option must also continue to be made accessible, as these \nsettings at times can be as or more appropriate to serve the more complicated and complex needs \nof a subset of consumers. \n29.  Through the efforts ofDDA, DHCF and the Money Follows the Person program, \ndiscussed in~ 30, a strategic plan is being fully implemented to reduce all ICF/ID homes to six \n(6) persons or less to improve the ability of these homes to provide more personalized services \nand supports, close older and non-accessible ICF/ID homes and reduce the overall number of \npersons receiving services via the ICF/ID program, consistent with the District's goal of \ntreatment in the least restrictive environment.  In fiscal year 2009, the number of eight-person \nhomes decreased to s_ix {6) persons or less :from 15 to 12 with a plan on file for DC Healthcare to \nreduce all of its homes to six (6) or less via the MFP program;  nine (9)  homes closed or were \nreduced in size and converted to the HCBS waiver program; and in total the number of \n8 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 10 of 26\nindividuals receiving services through the ICF/ID program decreased by 13%  from the start to \nclose of fiscal year 2009, and for class members decreased by 11%. \nVI.  Money Follows the Person Grant \n30.  In July 2008, CMS awarded the District a three-year, multi-million dollar grant \nthrough the Money Follows the Person Rebalancing Demonstration Program (\"MFP\"). \n31.  This initiative has enabled the District to reduce its reliance on ICFs/ID for people \nwith a wide range of developmental and physical disabilities, as well as older adults and \npersons with chronic mental illness. \n32.  The MFP enables the District to receive a 15 percent higher, i.e., from 70% to \n85%, Medicaid matching rate for each person whom it assists to a community setting for the first \n365 days enrolled in a HCBS waiver and the grant is expected to result in an additional $4 \nmillion to $6 million in federal Medicaid funding to the District over the lifetime of the grant. \nThe District uses the higher federal Medicaid match that it receives from the grant to help people \nwho wish to leave intermediate care facilities or nursing homes to move into homes or \napartments of their choice, and to provide the Medicaid waiver services that these consumers \nneed to live in the community.  This program thus allows individuals to avoid being \ninstitutionalized and to exercise far greater choice and control over the essentials of their lives, \nsuch as where and with whom to live; what to do during the week and weekend; and what \nsupports to receive and from whom.  In addition, individuals in this program are participating in \npilots to demonstrate the effectiveness of peer counseling, transition coordination and enhanced \nprimary care coordination. \n33.  From August 2008 through September 2009, DDS transitioned 43 individuals \nwith developmental disabilities from ICFs/ID to smaller settings including apartments in which \n9 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 11 of 26\nthey live alone or with one or two other persons; there are an additional 29 individuals who are in \nsome phase of exploring the MFP process~ As of March 2009, DDS had offered MFP housing \nservices to another fifteen (15) individuals and their families who declined those services. \nSome of these individuals declined MFP services due to deteriorating health; others were \nsatisfied with their current placements; and still others refused because their families were not \nsupportive of the proposed changes.  This program illustrates the District's commitment to \ndeinstitutionalization and individual choice.  It allows an individual with IDD to choose his or \nher environment within a range of professionally acceptable alternatives, rather than imposing a \nstate-selected placement. \nVII.  Health and Welfare \n34.  With the on-the-ground implementation of the Health Care Agreement (\"HCA\") \ninitiated in May 2008, DDS has devoted considerable resources and funding exceeding $2.5 \nmillion and has successfully improved the quality and quantity of health care offered to \nconsumers. \n35.  The HCA established a Health Care Quality Initiative (\"Initiative\") in partnership \nwith George Washington and Georgetown Universities.  The Initiative has been able to recruit \nnew providers such as Seton House (affiliated with Providence Hospital), which now provides \nfor the comprehensive psychiatric service needs of more than 1 00 individuals, and two additional \nprimary care physicians (\"PCPs\").  A third PCP is now being supported as he begins a \nhomebound visiting practice in District of Columbia Wards 7 and 8. \n36.  The HCA has also enabled the District to deliver enhanced primary care \ncoordination for individuals considered to be high-risk who are in the waiver, and as a clinically \nbased research project, has provided outcome findings and recommendations for further \n10 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 12 of 26\nenhancements to the District's IDD and overall health care delivery-system as anticipated by the \nInitiative. Such coordination has occurred for 158 individuals, all class members, since the \ninception of the program, and was designed to be a proactive strategy for DDS/DDA to track the \ntransition of individuals from the Medical Director ICF /IDD model into the waiver program, \nidentify possible barriers to clinical care, and address any patient safety threats that could emerge \nas a result of this transition.  Select findings of the first year of the project included as follows: \naccess to medical services impedes ability to meet timeline requirements established by the IDD \nservice system; access to PCP services during evening and weekend hours contributes to high \nuse of emergency services; PCPs received the pilot project positively to improve communication \nand support for care coordination; care coordination between the PCP and specialist remains a \ncommunication challenge in the fee for service medical model; service coordination \nunderstanding of clinical conditions was adequate in most circumstances; and, clinical issues that \nemerge as significant areas include mobility, fall risks and sub-optimal use of physical therapy. \nThese findings now drive quality improvement initiatives in health care by targeting service \ncoordination training, exploring new health care delivery models with DHCF, and focused \ninterventions targeted toward mobility, fall prevention, and expansion of physical therapy \nservices. \n37.  George Washington University has also hosted webinars for physicians serving \nindividuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities by leading physicians in the field on \nthe following topics during the Initiative to date:  Seizure Disorders; Renal Disease; Asthma; \nBone Health; and, Wound Care.  These webinars are archived and available for viewing for the \nsubsequent 12 months and marketed through the Area Health Education Consortium for the \nDistrict of Columbia (\"AHEC\"). \n11 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 13 of 26\n38.  The District of Columbia's Health Resource Partnership (\"DC HRP\") seeks to \nexpand the community health care capacity for individuals with IDD by (1) providing health and \nmental health services that are accessible; and (2) implementing strategies to promote quality \nhealth outcomes. Since January 2009, DC HRP has added eight (8) full-time clinicians, who \nprovide services in homes and day/vocational settings with a focus on quality, technical \nassistance, and training.  In the last roughly six (6) months alone, the DC HRP interdisciplinary \n41 \nteam has completed 1,058 targeted technical assistance requests  a range of areas including \noccupational and physical therapy, speech, psychology, medicine, health education, and nursing. \nIn addition, the DC HRP medical director has assumed an increasingly active role in facilitating \ncommunication exchange between and among PCPs, the hospitals, medical specialists and \ninterdisciplinary team members.  This information has been useful in reducing hospital stays, \nensuring timely care provision, assisting teams to develop priorities for people with complicated \nhealth conditions and competing needs for treatments.  This has also helped to educate hospital \nstaff about the needs of people with disabilities and to better understand the community-based \nsystem of services and supports. \n39.  To increase the number of experienced practitioners, DC HRP provides \ncommunity-wide training in a variety of areas to teach those who serve individuals with IDD \nhow to provide better care.  Training includes, for example, \"Using Visual Strategies to Prevent \nand Reduce Behavior Problems,\" \"End of Life Planning,\" and \"Substitute Decision-Making in \nHealthcare.\" And in a significant development for the long-term sustainability of the service \ndelivery system, for the third consecutive year, Georgetown University family medicine \nresidents must devote a portion of their residency to the health care of adults with IDD, to assist \nin recruiting providers to this practice area. The additional training to medical students and \n12 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 14 of 26\nespecially residents, specifically addresses the capacity-building and pipeline needs to DC IDD \nresidents. The capacity for PCP panels is currently small and therefore access to care has been \nincreasingly difficult. Without a mechanism to expand the PCP base, reliance on an older \nworkforce of doctors creates unique and multiple service delivery challenges. Without \nthe education efforts through the DC HRP, the current expansion in the provider network \nwould not have become a reality. In order for DC HRP to accomplish the tasks of capacity \nbuilding, increase in quality care and best practices, a strong training component was required, \nnot only through physician consultation, coordination and technical support, but, educational \ntraining for soon-to-be practicing physicians in the local area. The connections and training of \narea resident family practitioners have allowed for physicians to include our individuals with \nIDD into their panel. DC HRP successfully recruited several graduates from the Georgetown \nFamily Practice residency programs who also see our patients at community health centers \n(\"CHC\"). \n40.  I concur with the recent summary report from Dr. Kim Bullock, DC HRP \nMedical Director, regarding the effectiveness of the Health Passport.  Dr. Bullock stated that \"the \nHealth Passport has become a crucial information exchange document for the emergency \ndepartment and the hospitals. Since the health passport has been implemented, providers have \nnoted its value in providing a concise, clear presentation of the client's medical-related history, \ncurrent and past. This information has been crucial in the emergency environment, as well as \nenabling, (1) medication reconciliation for hospitalization, (2) identifying point of contact for \nagency staff, physician, consultants, case worker, which has facilitated in-hospital \ncorrespondence by phone and in writing, (3) improved timing for discharge planning meetings, \nas well as emergency meetings concerning clinical care, (4) Provided timely information for \n13 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 15 of 26\nemergency and acute in-hospital clinical decision-making that impacts on interventions, and (5) \nserves as a life document that has the potential to memorialize the client's health information \novertime. \nOver the last year the health passport has been a portable document accompanying clients to all \narea hospitals. Providence Hospital has received the largest number of IDD clients, and the \npositive impact of the Health Passport has been noted by staff and upper-level administration. In \nthe last three months there have been forty (4 0) patients with complex medical problems either \nseen in the ED or admitted.  In these cases, the health passport has been instrumental in \ninfluencing patient's outcomes. The use of a Health Passport has proven to be invaluable in \nreducing errors, decreasing delays in getting pertinent health information about a complex client \nto the right person at the right time.\" \n41.  DC HRP prepared a report for DDA on Preventative Health Screenings and \nresults from a pilot study of the same for individuals served by DDA in residential settings.  In \n2005, DDA introduced the use ofHealth Form 1, a document to record preventive health \nscreenings that includes the recommendations of the Preventive Services Task Force \n(\"USPSTF\"). This documentation is required in the health records of all individuals receiving \nresidential services funded via the HCBS waiver or ICFs/ID. The USPSTF is an independent \npanel of experts in primary care and prevention that systematically reviews the evidence of \neffectiveness and develops recommendations for clinical preventive services. \n42.  Several entities tracking health care quality cited receipt of preventive health \nscreening and adult immunizations. This includes Health People 2010, the Commonwealth Fund \nNational Scorecard on U.S. Health System Performance, the Agency for Healthcare Research \n14 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 16 of 26\nand Quality, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (Committee on the State of the \nUSA Health Indicators, Board on Population Health and Public Health Practice) and the federal \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (Community Health Status Indicators). Specifically, \nmeasures such as detection of hypertension, colorectal cancer screening and breast cancer \nscreening are important measures ofhealth in the District of Columbia due to the high incidence \nofhypertension, cardiovascular disease and breast and colon cancer among residents of the \nDistrict of Columbia. They are far more important indicators than the rating of completion of \nhealth management care plans. While health management care plans are important documents for \nhealth planning and health care delivery, their usefulness in measuring the extent to which the \nDistrict of Columbia has advanced in the delivery of essential health care to people receiving \nservices from DDA is severely limited. \n43.  DC HRP conducted a study of preventive health screenings, namely colorectal \ncancer, mammography and Pap smears, and clinical breast exams, for individuals served in three \n(3) agencies.  A total of one hundred and forty seven (147) individuals were reviewed, \napproximately 11% of all individuals served by DDA in residential services.  Selected findings \ndemonstrate that these sample screening rates meet and in most instances exceed the national and \ntarget rates.  This is particularly significant given the barriers to preparation and completion of \nthese invasive procedures.  The full report contains recommendations for continued \nimprovements in the District's health care system for persons with intellectual and \ndevelopmental disabilities that will be reviewed by the DDA Quality Improvement Committee \nfor inclusion in the agency's initiatives. \nVIII.  Payments to Providers \n15 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 17 of 26\n44.  The District has made every effort to pay providers in a timely manner.  Ninety-\neight percent (98%) of all claims are adjudicated in 30 days. \n45.  DHCF has moved to a weekly payment cycle, meaning payments are sent out \nonce a week instead of every other week. \n46.  DDA and DHCF continue weekly conference calls to resolve emerging billing \nconcerns.  DHCF provides on-site provider technical assistance, and DDA and DHCF compare \nbilling reports against prior authorizations under the HCBS waiver program to proactively \nidentify potential billing problems prior to significant delays emerging. \n47.  To further improve financing of services, the District has submitted to CMS a \nState Plan Amendment that provides an alternative method of determining ICF/ID provider \nreimbursement.  DHCF, the District Medicaid State Agency, worked collaboratively with both \nDDS/DDA and the providers to develop the new methodology.  This alternative moves away \nfrom a cost-based reimbursement methodology where providers were locked into rates based on \ncost caps set at the median cost in 1993 inflated forward.  Because the way in which care is \nprovided has changed so much in the interim-for example, minimum wage increases, changes \nin rent, increases in utility costs, staffing ratio changes-these median cost caps do not reflect the \nactual cost of care today.  The new methodology allows providers to set a price for their services \nand they are rewarded for reducing cost so long as they continue to provide quality services. \nIX.  Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (\"CMS\") Monitoring of DDS \n48.  CMS is the federal agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs \nand already provides extensive oversight for services provided by DDS/DDA. \n49.  The District submits to CMS an annual report (known as the 372 report) that \ndetails fiscal and quality performance measures.  In addition, CMS will be initiating expanded \n16 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 18 of 26\n372 quality-reporting in the next fiscal year that mirrors the expanded quality management \nrequirements now found in the HCBS waiver program.  CMS also conducts unannounced \nrandom audits on various areas of its six ( 6) assurances, including level of care, service plan, \nqQalified providers, health and welfare, administrative oversight, and financial accountability. \nMost recently, in August 2009, DHCF and DDS/DDA were evaluated on Provider Enrollment \nprotocols. \n50.  From February 2007 to March 2009, CMS engaged in even more intensive \nmonitoring to ensure the then MAA and DDS/DDA's compliance with the federal HCBS waiver \nrequirements.  This included monthly written and telephonic monitoring of a corrective action \nplan in three of the six assurances: Plan of Care; Health and Welfare; and. Administrative \nOversight.  In March 2009, however, CMS determined that the District had \"made major \nchanges in the performance, structure, oversight mechanism, and systems sufficient enough to \nengage in continuous Quality Improvement (\"QI\").\" To qualify for such a finding, a state must \ndemonstrate a robust system of \"discovery, remediation and improvement\" in all six assurances. \nBased on DDS/DDA's \"demonstrated effectiveness of the many newly implemented systems to \nmeet the CMS quality requirements,\" CMS discontinued its intensified monitoring. \nX.  The District's Establishment of An Aggressive Internal Quality-Assurance System \n51.  DDA's Quality Management Division (\"QMD\") monitors all aspects of the \nservice-delivery system to ensure compliance with federal and local law, national best practices, \nand applicable court orders.  The QMD focuses on strengthening DDA's ability to discover areas \nof concern, remediate both discrete and systemic issues, and implement strategies for continuous \nimprovement. \n17 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 19 of 26\n52.  The QMD is divided into four (4) functional units:  Health and Wellness, Quality \nEnhancement and Quality Improvement (\"QE/QI\"), Incident Management and Enforcement \n(\"IMEU\"), and Mortality Review.  The Health and Wellness Unit supports the health of \nindividuals by providing oversight and support to individuals residing in natural homes, nursing \nhomes, hospitals, and small and mid-sized provider agencies.  The oversight includes provision \nof technical assistance, community outreach, and monitoring ofhealthmanagement care plans, \nbehavior support plans, meal protocols, and other treatment regimes necessary to realize optimal \nhealth status and outcomes. In the past quarterly reporting period alone, two (2) individuals were \nsuccessfully transitioned from nursing homes to community-based residential settings as a result \nof this focused assistance. The DDA Health and Wellness Unit and the DC HRP as a contractor \nto DDA work hand-in-hand in these areas across the DDA service delivery system. \n53.  The Quality Enhancement and Quality Improvement Unit currently uses the \nProvider Certification Review (\"PCR\") process as the mechanism that measures provider \nperformance, determines whether the provider/vendor does or does not meet the minimum \nthresholds for performance, and acknowledges each provider as able to deliver services and \nsupports to people served by DDA.  The PCR replaced the Basic Assurance Standards \nAuthorization (\"BASA\") review and is a far superior tool to evaluate quality.  The new PCR \nprocess (1) allows for the identification of positive practices and areas for improvement in \nproviders' services and supports; (2) allows for the ability to aggregate, analyze, and compare \ndata from various sources including information from the Department of Health Health \nRegulation and Licensing Administration (\"HRLA\"), the IMEU, Service Coordination, Provider \nResource Management, Mortality and Fatality Review Committees, and DDS's Contracts \nDepartment; and (3) provides evidence that providers are operating in accordance with HCBS \n18 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 20 of 26\nwaiver regulations, D.C. Rules and Regulations, and DDS/DDA approved policies. Further, \nunder BASA, only a small sub-set ofliving settings, including ICFs/ID, group homes, and \nsupported living residential service providers, were reviewed.  Moreover, only 10% or less of \ntotal recipients of the agency were evaluated.  In contrast, the PCR is applied to a broader range \nof providers including in-home supports, host home services, day habilitation, pre-vocational \nservices and supported employment, and expands the sampling methodology to be statistically \nsignificant for each service delivered by the provider agency.  The implementation of the PCR \nprocess is yet another example of the agency's ability to improve the quality assurance capacity \nof the District. DDS/DDA completed the Request For Proposal (\"RFP\") process to award the \ncontract to a nationally recognized vendor to assume responsibility for certifying all HCBS \nwaiver providers using the PCR and is pending Council approval. The Quality contract also \nincludes an independent audit of the DDA Service Coordination service delivery, providing the \nDDA Director and DHCF with an independent performance evaluation of this critical function. \nA third component ofthis contract includes a 10% sample of all ISPs to assess implementation of \nall services per the ISP on an annual basis.  Both elements are critical performance measures for \nCMS as described in the DDA Quality Management Strategy, and to provision of services to the \nEvans class.  DDA included these elements for an additional high quality, arm's length source of \nperformance measurement ofDDA service delivery, and did so independent of any direction or \nrequirement from an external party. \n54.  DDS/DDA recently undertook an initiative to ensure that Quality Improvement \nSpecialists in the Technical Assistance (\"TA'') Unit increase the number of unannounced visits \nand contacts that occur on a monthly basis.  The QMD began tracking the number of contacts in \nAugust 2008, and since that time, there has been a more than 200% increase in the number of \n19 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 21 of 26\nmonthly contacts (including initial visits, re-visits, unannounced visits, and telephone contact) \nmade by TA staf£  This has allowed the TA Unit to more effectively discover and remediate · \nissues in a timely manner.  Further, QE/QI assumes the responsibility of data integration for all \ninformation that reflects provider performance and its impact on people served through the DDA \nservice-delivery system. \n55.  The IMEU is critical as it provides the mechanism to track and remediate \nproblems, or incidents.  There have been several developments implemented by the District that \nhave contributed to the improvement of the investigatory process.  These include requiring all \ninvestigators to pass LRA Level I certification to improve investigatory skills; assigning \ninvestigators to specifip providers enabling each investigator to better recognize trends in the \nquality of services; providing trainings; and conducting quality assurance review of \ninvestigations submitted by providers.  In fiscal year 2009, IMEU provided training to more than \n20 provider agencies, conducted more than 100 quality assurance reviews, and made \napproximately 40 technical assistance contacts with providers.  In addition, a recent update to the \nConsumer Information System (\"MCIS\") allows DDA to track the outcome of an investigation \nand capture the responsible provider, allowing IMEU to accurately track and trend data for \nspecific providers.  Although the role of the District, and all state DD agencies, is to seek to \nprevent the occurrence of abuse, neglect, theft or a serious injury, these incidents do occur, hence \nthe CMS requirements for a robust system of safeguards for prevention, discovery and \nremediation.  In fiscal year 2009, it is important to note that only 7% of the entire class \nexperienced a substantiated incident of this type. \n56.  The District also has a mortality-review process (consisting of the Fatality Review \nCommittee \"FRC\" and the Mortality Review Committee \"MRC\"), which allows DDS/DDA to \n20 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 22 of 26\nidentify and, as necessary, address potential quality-of-care issues.  In fiscal year 2009, the FRC \nmaintained a 90% compliance rate of reviewing all cases within 90 days.  Further, as of this \nfiling, DDA's MRC has concluded reviews of all completed death investigations pending in \nfiscal year 2009. \n57.  Finally, the HRLA licenses and inspects group homes for persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities and certifies ICFs/ID.  HRLA conducts annual on-site and ad hoc \nmonitoring surveys to ensure that these facilities maintain compliance with District and federal \nhealth, safety, sanitation, and habilitative requirements.  Regulated facilities include Certified \n(Federal) Intermediate Care Facilities and Group Homes for Persons with Mental Retardation. \nXI.  Additional Healthcare Agreement Initiatives \n58.  The Crisis Intervention beds RFP was awarded in the spring of2009, and two (2) \nbeds opened at National Children's Center (\"NCC\") in August 2009. \n59.  The Values Based Training Initiative underwent several ''best and final offers\" \nwith an award being offered at this writing for implementation in fiscal year 2010. \n60.  DDS/DDA developed a comprehensive pre-employment competency-based \ntraining curriculum, associated tests and new Training Policy to enhance the competency of \ndirect support professionals in day/vocational and residential support services throughout the \nDDA service delivery system.  The new requirements are effective October 12, 2010.  The \npolicy, PowerPoint curriculum and competency tests can be accessed on line at www.dds.dc.gov. \n61.  The District obtained permission from CMS and the State of Connecticut to adopt \nthe Connecticut Level of Need Assessment and Risk Screening tool, which is a web-based \ndatabase system producing clear person-centered planning assessment results detailing strengths, \npreferences and support needs in the areas of health and medical supports, behavioral supports, \n21 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 23 of 26\nmental health, mobility, personal care, daily living, comprehension, communication, social life, \nsafety, and caregiver supports.  This tool also generates a \"risk screening\" to assist the individual \nand the team to systematically ensure that each potential risk has been fully explained, evaluated \nand addressed by the person and the team, and is clearly documented in the record.  The software \nand user's guide are being modified for the District's use at this time.  Training and the roll-out \nof the tool is scheduled for the first quarter of this fiscal year. \n62.  As part of the behavioral health initiatives, the DC HRP clinical psychologist \nworks in collaboration with the DDA clinical psychologist on individual, agency and systemic \nissues. He has introduced the use of a Best Practice Guide. This is a method for working with the \nindividual and their direct support staff to identify strategies that promote well-being, identify \nwhen stressors are beginning and how to respond, and identify what to do in the event of a crisis. \nThese simple tools are complementary to the formal behavior support plan, but are easier for the \ndirect support professional (\"DSP\") to understand. In addition, because the DSP is integral to the \ndevelopment of this tool, they are more likely to remember and follow the outlined strategies. \nBest Practice Guides was developed for all of the individuals transitioning from St. Elizabeth's \nto the community, and it has played an important role in transferring the knowledge from the St. \nElizabeth's staff to the new residential setting. \n63.  The clinical psychologist and speech therapist have collaborated on training and \ntechnical assistance aimed at increasing the use of visual teaching strategies, which is an \nessential component of a comprehensive approach for people with autism. The team has also \nworked with community therapists to increase their skills in identifying autism spectrum \ndisorders, particularly in older adults who may have been misdiagnosed. \n22 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 24 of 26\n64.  Health and clinical services training offerings are being developed and held, open \nto the DDA service delivery system. In the period between July and September 2009 alone, DC \nHRP developed and hosted 19 different training sessions on best practice topics in health, \nclinical and behavioral health topics. \nXII.  Inter-Agency Collaboration \n65.  I have chaired the Mayor's Inter-Agency Task Force on Coordination and \nManagement of the Supports and Services Delivery System for Persons with Intellectual and \nDevelopmental Disabilities, as established by Mayor's Order 2009-119 dated June 25, 2009, \nhaving held three (3) meetings to date, to further strengthen the collaboration among agencies. \nComposed ofhigh-levelleadership from DDS/DDA, DHCF, HRLA, and the City \nAdministrator's Office, the Task Force has established a mission statement, and framework \nwithin which to focus problem-solving and initiatives to advance the effectiveness of and \ninnovation in services to persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  Goal/Mission \nStatement:  Because of interagency coordination and collaboration, people with intellectual and \ndevelopmental disabilities (\"ID/DD\") in the District of Columbia will have the supports and \nservices to live full and meaningful lives.  Core Task Force Work Elements: Enhance supports \nand services options; Expand accessible and affordable housing; Grow meaningful work \nopportunities; Improve coordination of school to work transitions; Develop age appropriate \nsupports and living options for elders with ID/DD; Expand accessible transportation options; \nBuild an interagency workforce development initiative; Establish an interagency plan for health \nand wellness; Develop an interagency plan for family supports; Create an interagency early \nintervention plan (birth to three).  This framework addresses a lifespan and inclusive approach to \nservices and supports.  Initial topics of collaborative problem-solving leading to improvements \n23 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 25 of 26\ninclude work on the Nursing Assistive Personnel Training Regulations, and the MTM 1915(b)4 \nwaiver application to design improved transportation services for persons with IDD/DD in the \nMedicaid program. \n66.  The DHCF Medicaid Infrastructure Grant is being used to fund the DDA's \nparticipation in the State Employment Leadership Network (\"SELN\") as evidence of the \nDHCF's support of an employment first agenda to advance the quality of day and vocational \nservices in the District.  DDS/DDA joined the SELN, a cross-state cooperative venture of state \ndevelopmental disability agencies that are committed to improving employment outcomes for \nadolescents and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  The District is one of \nonly 16 participating states. \n67.  DHCF, HRLA and DDA are collaborating on a training initiative for ICF/ID \nproviders aimed at improving the quality of services and supports delivered through that \nresidential service option. \n68.  DHCF, DDS and the District of Columbia Housing Authority have entered into a \nMemorandum of Understanding to improve coordination between the agencies and subsequent \naccess to housing authority vouchers, and to track affordable housing units across the District to \nfacilitate movement to the least restrictive living alternatives. \nXIII.  Conclusion \n69.  The structure and management staff ofthe DDA has remained in place now for \nmore than one and a half years.  I have been in this position for just over two years, two of \nDDA's three Division Directors for eighteen (18) months, the third has been with the \norganization for eight (8) months now, and all of the remaining managers have been in place for \nmore than one year.  Although to those outside of the District that may seem short-lived, for this \n24 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-4   Filed 10/07/09   Page 26 of 26\nhistory, it is evidence of a team committed to the residents of the District and the Evans class \nmembers.  It is this team that seeks to continue to fulfill the obligations of the state DD agency \nto the residents of the District of Columbia without the necessity of further judicial intervention \nand oversight. \nI declare under penalty of petjury that the foregoing statements are true and correct to the \nbest of my information, knowledge and belief.  Executed on October 7, 2009. \nLaura L. Nuss, Deputy Director \nDevelopmental Disabilities Administration \nD.C. Department on Disability Services \n25 ",

WILLIAMS \nIn his February 10, 1999 Order, Judge Stanley Harris ordered the Special Master, in \ncooperation and conjunction with the parties, if possible, to develop a plan for the conclusion of \nthis action, addressing the disposition of the fines paid by defendants and including suggestions \nfor post- litigation mechanisms to ensure the protection of the plaintiff class' continuing interests \nin adequate habilitation.  Evans v. Williams, 35 F. Supp.2d 88, 97 (D.D.C. 1999).2 \nAmong other things, the Plan is to address: \na.  A summary and articulation of the goals of this lawsuit; \nb. The status of compliance with various Court Orders; \nc. The quality assurance methods to be developed and implemented by the \ndefendants to monitor the performance of public and private providers of service; \n1 \nTHIS PLAN WAS CONCEIVED, SHAPED, AND DRAFTEDSIGNIFICANTLYBYEXPERTTO THE SPECIAL MASTER, \nCLARENCE/ SUNDRAM, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE NEW YORK STATE COMMISSION ON QUALITYO  F CARE \nFOR THE MENTALLY DISABLED, WHO WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE SPECIAL MASTER AND PARTIES OVER \nTHE TWO YEARS OF ITS DEVELOPMENT. \n2 THE EXISTING ORDERS IN THIS CASE ONLY REFERENCE THE EVANS CLASS MEMBERS (I.E., \nTHOSE INDIVIDUALS WID HAVE AT ONE TIME RESIDED AT FOREST HAVEN), AND THEREFORE, \nDO NOT INCLUDE ALL INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IN DEFENDANTS' \nSERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM.  HOWEVER, DEFENDANTS HAVE EXPRESSLY AGREED NOT TO \nCREATE A BIFURCATED SYSTEM OF SERVICES FOR ITS CITIZENS WITHDEVELOPMENTAL \nDISABILITIES, AND THEREFORE, HAVE AGREED TO IMPROVE SERVICES WITHIN THEIR SYSTEM \nAND TO PROVIDE THE &\\ME LEVEL OF SERVICE> TO CLASS AND NON-CLASS MEMBERS. As A \nRESULT, THIS PLAN REFERS TO \"CONSUMERS\" RATHER THAN \"CLASS MEMBERS\" \nTHROUGHOUT. CONSUMERS SHALL REFER TO ALL INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVElOPMENTAL \nDISABILITIES, INCLUDING ALL EVANS CLASS MEMBERS, THAT THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \nGOVERNMENT AND DEFEND\\NTS SERVE IN THEIR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM. THIS \nNOMENCLATURE DOES NOI' EXPAND THE COURT=S JURISDICTION TO NCN-CLASS MEMBERS. \n5 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-3   Filed 10/07/09   Page 7 of 75\nd.  The  standards,  including  outcomes  standards  to  be  developed  and \nimplemented by defendants, that should be used to determine defendants' continued \ncompliance with Court- ordered requirements, and the way in which compliance with \nsuch standards should be measured; \ne. The degree of compliance that should be required with each of the standards \nrecommended; \nf. The steps necessary to establish permanent, objective, efficient, and effective \npost-termination monitoring of the programs  serving consumers by independent \nentities; and \ng. The steps necessary to coordinate existing mechanisms and to develop needed \nmechanisms for the advocacy of the interests of consumers on an individual and \ncommunity-wide basis. \nTHE PLAN STRUCTURE \nThe Plan has the following structure: \n1. It recognizes that there is already in place a declaratory judgment and permanent \ninjunction recognizing a federal constitutional right to receive individualized habilitative care \nand treatment in the least separate, most integrated, and least restrictive settings, and to be kept \nfree from harm. It also recognizes that there are Court Orders, which are outdated or no longer \nrelevant, which need to be disposed of. 3 \n2.  Under each of the broad goals of the Court Orders, it summarizes  the specific \nprovisions of outstanding Court Orders that must be complied with as they relate to these broad \ngoals. These Court Orders are grouped so that all related Court Orders are included under the \ngoal to which they most closely relate. The Plan then identifies the specific actions that must be \ntaken by the defendants to come into compliance with this group of outstanding Court Orders. \nThese actions fall into three broad categories: \na. Changes in the service delivery system; \nb. Creation and permanent funding of an independent External Monitoring Body;4 \nand \nc. Creation and permanent funding of legal representation and lay advocacy services. \n3 THE PARTIES SHALL ATTEMPT TO REACH AGREEMENT ON WHAT ORDERS liMY BE VACATED \nAND SHALL SUBMIT A JOINT MOTION TO THAT EFFECT TO THE COURT. \n4 As DESCRIBED MORE FULLY IN SECTION D.3 OF THE PLAN, THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED THAT \nTHIS EXTERNAL MONITORING BODY WILL BE THE QUALITY TRUST FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH \nDISABiliTIES, INC., A DURABLE, INDEPENDENT, NONPROFIT AGENCY{ HEREINAFTER \nREFERRED TO AS A QUALITY TRUST.@} \n6 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-3   Filed 10/07/09   Page 8 of 75\nThe Plan attempts to define with reasonable specificity the actions that are necessary to \nmeet the requirements of the Court Orders. In many areas, the actions include the adoption of \nnew policies and procedures and staff training to address particular issues. The Plan could \napproach these issues in different ways. One option is to provide for detailed prescriptions of \nwhat the policies and procedures and staff training ought to contain. The shortcoming of this \napproach is  that it significantly restricts  the room for judgment by those responsible for \nmanaging the system. An alternative approach that the Plan adopts is to provide for an open \nand accessible process of policy-making, where the parties and experts that they recommend, \nhave a meaningful opportunity to provide input into proposed policies and training initiatives \nprior to their adoption and dissemination, and that the defendants give careful consideration to \nsuch input. In each section of the Plan where a need for new or revised policies and procedures \nis identified, the Plan requires that the process of policy-making will involve close collaboration \nwith the plaintiffs5 and the plaintiff-intervenor, and experts whom they recommend, prior to the \nadoption of these policies and procedures. However, the final decision about the policies and \nprocedures and training programs will remain with the defendants, understanding that if they fail \nto address serious concerns raised by the plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor, this may result in \ncompliance issues down the road. 6  In the final analysis, it is compliance with the specific \noutcome criteria that is required (see paragraph 4 below), and the tasks identified are a means to \nthis end. \n3.  For each set of actions, a timetable for implementation is  established.  These \ntimetables recognize up to three stages of implementation and establish interim time frames for \neach stage to enable the parties and the Special Master to monitor the defendants= progress in \nthe implementation process. The parties anticipate that periodic progress reports to the Special \nMaster will be required as the process of implementation progresses, and that status conferences \nwill be scheduled with the Court at least bi-monthly, and more frequently as the Special Master \nor the Court determines to be warranted. Thirty days prior to the scheduled date for a status \nconference, the Special Master will establish an agenda for the conference, and require a written \nprogress report from the defendants on the items on the agenda. Such progress report will be \nprovided within 14 days, with copies to the plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor. The plaintiffs and \nplaintiff-intervenor will have 10 days  from the receipt of the progress report to file  any \ncomments on such report with the Special Master, with copies to the defendants. \n4.  For each set of actions, the Plan identifies specific outcome criteria for determining \ncompliance with the related group of Court Orders.  These criteria put the parties on notice \nabout the results that must be achieved to satisfy the standard of compliance. Thus, while it is \nthe intent of the parties to monitor the timely implementation of the specific tasks that have \nbeen identified as necessary for implementation of the Court Orders in each section, the ultimate \ntest of compliance will be in sati.ifjing all of the related outcome criteria. The parties agree that if the Court \nfinds  that defendants  have  satisfied  the  outcome criteria,  the  defendants will also be in \ncompliance with the related Court Orders pursuant to this Plan, and the Court may vacate the \n5 THROUGHOUT THIS PLAN, THE TERM APLAINTIFFS@ IS INTENDED TO INCLUDE THE \nPLAINTIFF-INTERVENOR, THE UNITED STATES. \n6 \nSUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES AND TRAINING ALSO REQUIRES THAT OTHER \nINTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS HA VB ACCESS TO THE PROCESS AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO HA VB \nTHEIR CONCERNS HEARD AND CONSIDERED IN DEVELOPING POLICYA  ND TRAINING \nINITIATIVES AND PLANNING THEIR IMPLEMENTATION. \n7 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-3   Filed 10/07/09   Page 9 of 75\nrelated Court Orders subject to the provisions in paragraph 7 below.  The failure  of the \ndefendants to implement the actions identified in the Plan as necessary to meet the requirements \nof the related Court Orders is also evidence of noncompliance with those Court Orders. In any \nevent, pursuant to paragraph 7 below, the Court will ultimately decide whether or not the \ndefendants have complied with the outcome criteria. \n5. Measuring compliance does not lend itself to a mathematically precise formula. The \nmeasure of compliance depends on the nature of the interest at stake and the degree to which \nthe defendants= noncompliance affects that interest.? It is evident that some of the Court \nOrders are of more importance to the protection of critical interests of plaintiffs than others and \ntherefore will require a higher threshold of demonstrated compliance. \nFor each set of actions, the Plan assigns a standard of compliance, consistent with the \nCourt Order ofFe bruary 10, 1999. 8  The three threshold levels proposed are: \n1)  Full Compliance. This threshold level essentially requires full  compliance (95 \npercent) with specific, objectively measurable requirements contained in the Court Order itself. 9 \nWhere there is specificity in the Court Order, obviously it cannot be disregarded lightly. This \nthreshold anticipates that the defendants will completely meet these specific legal obligations, \nalthough it would give the Court and the Special Master discretion to disregard minor and \ninconsequential failures of total compliance which: (i) do not affect substantial interests of the \nplaintiff class; and (ii) are due to genuinely unanticipated or unforeseeable circumstances; or (iii) \n7 \nFORTIN V.

DEP=T OF HUMAN SERVICES, 69 F.3D 1081 (lOTH CIR. 1995), CERT. \nDENIED, 517 U.S.1190 (1996). \n8  THIS PROVISION OF THE PLAN HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF ON-GOING AND SUBSTANTIAL \nDISCUSSION BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND THE SPECIAL MASTER AND, ULTIMATELY, THE PARTIES \nDID NOT REACH AN AGREEMENT ON IT.  THE POSITION OF THE PLAINTIFFS AND PLAINTIFF \nINTERVENOR IS THAT THERE SHOUW BE TWO LEVELS OF COMPLIANCE: FULL (100PERCENT}AND \nHIGH (90 PERCENT).  THE DEFENDANTS ACCEPT THE  THREE  TIERED STRUCTURE AND \nRECOMMEND DIFFERENT THRESHO  W LEVELS FOR COMPLIANCE: FULL (85 PERCENT): HIGH (80 \nPERCENT}AND SIGNIFICANT (75 PERCENT). AFTER CAREFULLY CONSIDERING THE POSITIONS OF \nTHE PARTIES, THE SPECIAL MASTER RECOMMENDS THE STRUCTURE AND THRESHOW LEVELS \nCONTAINED IN THE PLAN. \n9 THIS THRESHOW IS SET AT 95 PERCENT TO ACCOMMODATE THE DEFENDANTS= CONCERN \nNOT TO BE PENALIZED FOR OCCASIONAL AND TEMPORARY SLIPPAGE IN TOTAL COMPLIANCE \nLEVELS. \n8 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-3   Filed 10/07/09   Page 10 of 75\nare due to the actions of independent actors outside the control of the defendants which \noccurred despite the best good faith efforts of the defendants. Generally speaking, this level of \ncompliance will be expected in implementing the structural aspects of the Court Orders which \nare essential conditions to implementing the programmatic aspects of the Court Orders. \n2) High Compliance. This threshold requires compliance with the indicator at a rate \ngenerally exceeding 90 percent compliance. Where instances  of noncompliance with the \nindicator are found, none can involve a serious and substantive violation of the Court Order with \nsignificant adverse impact upon class members (i.e., actual harm or a serious, risk of harm) in \nthe judgment of the Court and Special Master (e.g., excusable noncompliance may involve \nfailure to comply with documentation or some aspect of process, without significant adverse \nimpact).  Generally  speaking,  this  level  of compliance  will  be  expected  for  important \nprogrammatic aspects of the Court Orders. \n3) Significant Compliance. This threshold requires compliance with the indicator at a \nrate generally exceeding 80 percent compliance. Where instances of noncompliance with the \nindicator are found which involve a serious and substantive violation of the Court Order with \nsignificant adverse impact upon class members, this threshold may nevertheless be met if, in the \njudgment of the Court and Special Master, these instances were sporadic or isolated in nature \nand prompdy addressed by effective corrective action. \n6. The Plan identifies the method by which the Special Master, and ultimately the Court, \nwill assess compliance for each set of outcome criteria.  Thus, the parties will be aware at the \noutset of the manner in which different types of data will be evaluated in determining whether \nthe standard of compliance has been met as to particular areas of the Court Orders. \n7.  The Plan provides that as the implementation process proceeds, defendants will \nutilize information generated from internal monitoring processes to determine when they \nbelieve they have met the standards for compliance with the identified outcome criteria for each \nset of actions related to a group of Court Orders. At this point, defendants shall approach the \nplaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor to see if they concur that there is compliance with the set of \nactions and outcome criteria. If there is no agreement,  the defendants can move the Special \nMaster for a finding of compliance as to these Court Orders and can seek to have the related \nCourt Orders vacated and dismissed.10  In doing so, the defendants, who have the burden of \nproof of establishing compliance, will offer evidence of compliance with the outcome criteria. \nIf the plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor do not challenge the evidence of compliance within 30 \ndays, the parties may move joindy for an Order vacating and dismissing the related Court \nOrders. The plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor may contest the contention of compliance within \n30 days, by filing written reasons for their objections with the Special Master. After such filing, \nthe plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor will have an additional 45 days to submit evidence in \n10 IN FREEMAN V.

The plaintiffs and the plaintiff-intervenor shall have the right to \naccess all persons, residences, facilities, buildings, programs, services, documents, records and \nmaterials necessary to determine if defendants have complied with existing Orders in this case \nor the provisions of this Plan that are related to class members or the care and/ or services \nprovided to class members in this case.  Such access shall include all departmental and/ or \nindividual class member records. The Special Master shall schedule a hearing on the issue of \ncompliance and may retain independent consultants to evaluate the status of compliance. If \nindependent consultants are retained by the Special Master, upon receipt of the report of the \nindependent consultants, the parties will have 30 days to file their comments.  Any party may \nchallenge the fmdings and conclusions of these consultants, leading to a fact-fmding hearing \nbefore either the Special Master or the Court. Upon the conclusion of such hearings, the Special \nMaster shall present the Court with proposed findings of fact and conclusions oflaw consistent \nwith Fed. R. Civ. P. 53. The ultimate decision on whether particular Court Orders are to be \nvacated and/ or whether this case is to be dismissed rests with the Court and not the Special \nMaster. Unless there is a joint motion to vacate particular Court Orders, no Court Order shall be \nvacated without a hearing before the Court at which evidence of compliance with the Order is \nprovided. \n8. The Plan anticipates that, over time, the defendants will implement all of the required \nactions and meet the specified outcome criteria in order to successfully move the Court to \nvacate  and  dismiss  the  related  Court  Orders,  except  the  declaratory  judgment  on  the \nconstitutional rights of the consumers to receive individualized habilitation in the least separate, \nmost integrated and least restrictive environment and to be protected from harm. It is also \nanticipated that in the course of implementation, the existing District of Columbia statutes will \nbe revised and a new set of updated legal standards will be adopted, incorporating the goals of \nthe Court Orders, and will be enforceable in Superior Court and that plaintiff class members will \nhave access to legal representation services as described in the Plan to enforce their rights. The \npermanent injunctions shall not be vacated until all other Orders are vacated. \n9.  The Plan itself generally is not intended to be an enforceable document.  However, \nclass members have a great interest in ensuring that the agreed upon actions identified in this \nPlan are in fact implemented effectively and in a timely manner by the defendants to secure the \nbenefits and protections provided for by the Court Orders. Until the Plan is implemented and \nthe compliance standards are met as described above and related Court Orders are vacated and \ndismissed as  provided for in the Plan, the underlying Court Orders continue to remain \nenforceable in federal  court.  More specifically, in the event that the defendants do not \nimplement the provisions of this Plan effectively and on a timely basis, plaintiffs and plaintiff \nintervenor retain the right to  seek appropriate  judicial relief,  based on this  evidence  of \nnoncompliance with the Court Orders, including Orders requiring specific performance of the \nPlan. \n10. Once the Court Orders are vacated and dismissed, as described in paragraphs 7 and \n8 above, the Plan anticipates that the Quality Trust will assume full monitoring responsibilities \nfor class members and that any cases involving individual rights violations will be litigated in \nSuperior Court under District of Columbia statutes  and with the assistance of the legal \nrepresentatives and lay advocates provided under the Plan.  The Plan does not anticipate that \nplaintiffs or the plaintiff-intervenor will seek recourse to the federal court to litigate individual \nviolations of rights in this case pursuant to the declaratory judgment which will remain unless: \n10 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-3   Filed 10/07/09   Page 12 of 75\n(1)  there  are  systemic violations  of the  declaratory  judgment;  or  (2)  legal  remedies  are \nunavailable in Superior Court (e.g., due to repeal of the statutes); or (3) there is a failure to \nadequately fund the Quality Trust pursuant to the Consent Order dated January 19, 2001. \n11 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-3   Filed 10/07/09   Page 13 of 75\n11 \nA.

Consumers  will  have  ISPs  developed  or  revised  in  accordance  with \nprofessional standards at least annually, and reviewed whenever there is a \nsignificant change in circumstances, based upon individualized assessments, \nwith the active participation of the consumer, case manager, advocate, staff who \nknow the consumer best and any available family members or guardians, at a \nminimum. ISPs will be disseminated to members of the planning team and \nplaced in the consumer=s  chart within  30  days  of the planning meeting. \nDefendants shall notify the Court Monitor and the counsel for the plaintiffs of \nthe dates of the assessments and the ISP meetings for all class members on an \nannual basis.  The defendants  shall notify parents/g uardians when serious \ninjuries or serious illness require a doctor=s attention. \nii. ISPs will be computerized. \niii. Consumers receive the services and supports identified in the ISP on a timely \nbasis in the least separate, most integrated and least restrictive environment. \nISPs  must address the consumers=  need for  suitable living arrangements, \ntogether with community-based day programs and services; employment as \nappropriate; recreation; medical, dental and health and mental health services \nwhich provide for accessibility, quality and continuity of care. If the person has \ndecision-making incapacity, the ISP will provide for decision-making by a \nguardian or other appropriate surrogate decision-maker.  For persons with \nphysical  disabilities,  the  ISP  must  provide  for  individualized  adaptive \nequipment, as needed, based on appropriate professional evaluations of the \nneed for such equipment. \n(A) An assessment of the need for adaptive equipment is completed \nwithin 30 days of a request therefor. \n(B) Acquisition and repair of adaptive equipment occur within 60 days \nfrom  the  date the need is  determined, unless  the District can \ndemonstrate that the acquisition or repair of the adaptive equipment \nin a specific case was not reasonably possible due to circumstances \noutside its control, such as lack of availability of the equipment or \nrepair service needed.  In such cases,  the District will make all \nreasonable efforts to provide such equipment or repair services as \nsoon as possible. \n(C) Medical and dental services are being provided within \nprofessionally acceptable timeframes. \nJ4 THE FEBRUARY 10,1999 ORDER REQUIRES THE PLAN TO PROVIDE FOR ATHE STANDARDS, \nINCLUDING OUTCOME STANDARDS TO BE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED BY THE DEFENDANTS, \nTHAT SHOULD BE USED TO DETERMINE THE DEFENDANTS= CONTINUED COMPLIANCE WITH \nCOURT-ORDERED REQUIREMENTS •.•. @ ID.

Specific Outcome Criteria for Determining Compliance \n1.  All MR/DD consumers for whom Restricted Control Procedures are used \nhave individualized behavior support plans. Control procedures are used when \nalternative techniques have failed and only when they are determined to be the \nleast restrictive alternatives.  Such behavior support plans clearly identify the \nproactive, positive approaches that will be used to minimize and/ or ameliorate \nthe need for control procedures. No consumers are subject to PRN medication, \nseclusion, time-out, or use of aversives. If consumers are restrained, they will be \nchecked every 30 minutes and a record kept contemporaneously with the check. \n11.  Defendants have developed and implemented a policy governing the safe \nadministration and handling of medications. \n111.  When  medication  is  used  for  sedation  prior  to  medical  appointments, \ndesensitization plans describing the positive, proactive approaches that will be \nutilized to reduce the need for sedation, will be implemented. \n1v.

(See Goal A (1) above.)  For budgetary purposes, it is important that the \naggregation of needs occurs early enough in the budget cycle so that the parties can be \ninformed of the amount of the appropriation that will be required to meet the identified \nneeds of the consumers. \nB. The portion of the budget that addresses !)'Stem needs for managing, monitoring and overseeing the \n!)'Stem of services to consumers.  These needs would include appropriations for the support of \nstaff who perform quality assurance, investigations, management information, and \nmonitoring and case management functions.  The determination of needs should be \nbased upon agreed-upon staffing ratios for these functions, similar to the ratios for the \ncase  management  function.  Such  ratios  would  permit  an  objective  process  of \ndetermination of need, and permit external review of adequacy of the budget using \nobjective criteria, by the Court Monitor, plaintiffs, plaintiff-intervenor and by the \nQuality Trust and its lay advocacy program. Also included would be the staffmg needs \nof the MRDDA Administrator=s office to perform the various policy-making and \npolicy-executing functions of the office, as well as other administrative needs. \nC. The portion of the budget that addresses a'!Y capital appropriations that mqy be required to meet the \nneeds of the consumers (e.g.,for construction or renovation ofp rogram sites, or residences). \nSpecifically, the plaintiffs, plaintiff-intervenor, Special Master, and Court Monitor will be \ninformed of:21 \n1.  The  total  amount of the appropriation  that would be required under \nparagraphs A, B and C; \n21 THE QUALITY TRUST=S ACCESS TO BUDGET INFORMATION IS ADDRE5SED EARLIER IN THE PLAN UNDER \nGOALD.3.B. SECTIONIII.D ON P. 47. \n57 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-3   Filed 10/07/09   Page 59 of 75\n2. The amount of the appropriation that will be requested by the MRDDA in its \nbudget request within  the  Department of Human  Services,  prior  to  the \nsubmission of the MRDDA budget request; \n3. The amount of the appropriation being requested from the Mayor=s Office \nof Management and Budget by the Department of Human Services and other \nunits of the District Government for services to MRDDA consumers; \n4. The amount of the appropriation being requested by the Mayor from the City \nCouncil to meet the needs identified in paragraphs A, B, & C; and \n5. The final appropriation that will be available to meet the needs identified in \nparagraphs A, B, & C, as well as the means that will be used to meet these needs \nif the appropriation is less than that initially determined to be necessary. \nc. Time Frames for Implementation \nStage I B120 Days from the Filing of the Plan with the Court \n1.  Defendants will develop a set of data driven criteria for the staffmg needs \ndescribed in paragraph B. \n11.  Defendants will develop a fiscal calendar to implement this process in the next \nbudget cycle. \nStage II B 180 Days from the Filing of the Plan with the Court \nThe budget information will be forwarded to the Quality Trust and advocacy \nagencies as well as the plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor. \nStage III B 240 Days from the Filing of the Plan with the Court \nThe budget information should be sent to the Quality Trust and advocacy agencies, \nphasing out the plaintiffs= and plaintiff-intervenor=s routine receipt of this information \nas the Court Orders are vacated and dismissed. \nd. Specific Outcome Criteria for Determining Compliance \ni. Defendants will develop the objective criteria for determining staffmg needs \nfor various functions in paragraph B, and will utilize these criteria in formulating \nbudget requests. \nii. The computerized ISP process will be used to aggregate consumers= needs for \nthe purposes of planning and budget making, and these needs will determine the \nbudget requests for services and supports required. \n58 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-3   Filed 10/07/09   Page 60 of 75\niii. The defendants will develop a Fiscal Calendar which identifies the dates or time \nperiods within which information about the budget process will be provided to the \nSpecial Master, Court Monitor, plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor or their successors \nas described above. \ne. Standard of Compliance \nFull Compliance \nf. Method of Assessing Compliance \nActual provision of this information to the Special Master, Court Monitor, plaintiffs and \nplaintiff-intervenor or their successors as described above for two successive years, \ndemonstrating that the staffing ratios and computerized ISP process are being utilized to \ndetermine the budget for the support of MRDDA consumers. \nG.

Necessary Tasks to Implement the Court Orders \nThe defendants continue to report monthly on the timeliness of the Medicaid and non \nMedicaid payments, with copies to the Special Master, the Court Monitor and plaintiffs and the \nplaintiff-intervenor (and when the Quality Trust is created, to the Quality Trust and its lay \nadvocacy program). The report should clearly indicate the payments that have not been made on \na timely basis, based on the date of submission of vouchers by vendors. \nDefendants will comply with the contracting provisions of the Court Orders. \n61 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-3   Filed 10/07/09   Page 63 of 75\nc. Time Frames for Implementation \nThis obligation is immediate and continuing. \nd. Specific Outcome Criteria for Determining Compliance \n1.  Defendants comply with the provisions regarding budgeting. \n11.  All payments are made on a timely basis for two consecutive years as required \nby the Court Orders. \n111.  Defendants comply with the contracting provisions of the Court Orders. \ne. Standard of Compliance \nFull Compliance \nf. Method of Assessing Compliance \ni.  Review of a 10 percent random sample of vouchers/requests for payment by \nMedicaid and non-Medicaid providers. \nii. Interviews with representatives of 10 percent of the providers selected at random. \nH. ESSENTIAL SYSTEMIC CONDITIONS \nIn addition to the specific actions described above, the parties also discussed several \nother actions that would assist the District in developing additional options for the cost-effective \nimplementation of the goals of this action -- individualized services in the least restrictive \nenvironment to the persons served by the mental retardation and developmental disabilities \nservice delivery system. \nA.  Medicaid Reforms \nAs  the  Committee  reviewed  the  present  mental retardation  and  developmental \ndisabilities service system, it became clear that there are significant opportunities to expand the \nrange of services and supports available to consumers and others in need of assistance from \nMRDDA, while offsetting the cost of this expansion to the District. The vehicle for achieving \nthis result is an amendment to the District=s Medicaid plan to take fuller advantage of options \nunder the Medicaid waiver program. The current Medicaid waiver is narrowly drawn and has \nthus far served a very limited number of consumers. Unlike almost every state where Medicaid \nwaiver funded services serve more than half of the persons with mental retardation and \ndevelopmental disabilities, in the District, waiver-funded services account for only a small \n62 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-3   Filed 10/07/09   Page 64 of 75\nhandful of consumers. At the same time, the cost of some of the existing programs that could \nbe eligible for Federal Financial Participation is  borne entirely by the District. Thus, the \ncommittee deems it important that the District take fuller advantage of the opportunities \navailable under the Medicaid waiver. \n1.  Medicaid waiver to provide adequate funding of implementation of the Plan \nThe Planning Committee agreed that the District would direcdy or through contract: \n(a)  Articulate policy options for the District to carry out purposes ofHome \nand Community Based Services (HCBS) and will propose changes in the \nwaiver to maximize reimbursement and the provision of services and \nsupports in the least restrictive, most integrated, community-based \nsettings. \n(b)  Conduct  quality  reviews  of  the  provider  network  to  evaluate \nappropriateness and timeliness of care and recommend procedures for \nMedicaid compliance, potential quality improvement and improved \naccess to services. \n(c)  Recommend criteria to assess consumers' level of functioning in order \nto determine the appropriate utilization of ICF /MR facilities. \n(d)  Assess Community Residential Facilities= (CRFs) current compliance \nwith Medicaid HCBS standards and recommend a plan for qualifying \nCRFs for Medicaid reimbursement under the HCBS waiver. \n(e)  Evaluate  first year of HCBS implementation, consumer screening, \nutilization management and access to services in order to: \n(1)  Identify target population and deftne eligibility criteria; \n(2)  Assess  needs  of  the  population  and  identify  alternative \nresidential and day programs needed; \n(3)  Develop billing documentation necessary for waiver \n(4 )  Identify consumers who can stay in their current residential \nsettings, receive the quality of service currendy provided and \nqualify for waiver reimbursement, (e.g., CRF residents receiving \nappropriate quality of care); \n(5)  Identify consumers who can stay in their current residential \nsettings  and qualify to receive waiver reimbursable services \nwhen Medicaid waiver quality standards of care are achieved; \n(6)  Identify consumers currendy residing in ICFs/MR who, in light \nof available HCBS, do not need ICF /MR level of care and \nrecommend a plan for the development of new less intensive \nprograms or the conversion of existing ICF /MR programs to \nless restrictive service models; \n(7)  Recommend optimal organizational structure and management \npolicies for implementation of the waiver; and \n(8)  Develop options regarding the schedule for obtaining federal \n2.  Day Treatment \nThe defendants will: \n(a) modify the defmition of day treatment program for purposes of \nMedicaid reimbursement so as to permit habilitation services to be \n63 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-3   Filed 10/07/09   Page 65 of 75\nprovided in the least separate, most integrated and least restrictive \ncommunity setting appropriate to the needs of each consumers; or \n(b)  modify  the  Medicaid  waiver  so  as  to  include  day  treatment \nprograms in such settings. \nThe District will allocate funds for the performance of these functions direcdy or \nthrough a contract with an appropriate vendor. Funds necessary to implement the \nMedicaid recommendations that are adopted by the D.C. government will be secured \nthrough MRDDA and MAA appropriations.  Funds  necessary to provide waiver \nreimbursable services will be secured through Medicaid. \n3.  Completion dates \nStage I B 90 Days from the Filing of the Plan with the Court \n1.  Produce plans of improvement for HCFA   compliance. \n2.  Recommend a plan for quality improvement, performance indicators \nand outcome measures. \nStage liB 180 Days from the Filing of the Plan with the Court \n1.  The District will conduct and report findings of an evaluation of the \nprogrammatic effects and the fiscal impact of the reformed waiver. \n2.  Defendants will: \n(a)  Transfer a minimum of 75 people to the waiver and develop a \nphase-in schedule for complete implementation and authorize \nand complete service plans for people in CRFs  who meet levels \nof care and service quality criteria and transfer them to the \nwa1ver. \n(b)  Assist providers to convert to HCBS programs and provide \ntechnical assistance, business plans and improvement plans. \nStage III B 240 Days from the Filing of the Plan with the Court 22 \nEvaluate and expand the waiver to create opportunities for provision of services and \nsupports in the least restrictive environment. \nB.  Legislation \nThe parties recognize that many of the existing statutes governing services and supports \nto persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities require revision and updating \nto reflect contemporary approaches to the provision of services and supports. The parties have, \nthrough discussion, developed a set of Legislative Principles to guide them through the process \nof developing and proposing legislation (see Appendix). To this end, the parties intend to work \ncooperatively to develop and propose legislation as follows: \n1.  Steps needed to effectuate the Plan: \n1.  Access to services  (class members exempted from fund availability \ncondition); \n22 THE PLAINTIFF-INTERVENOR, UNITED STATES, TAKES NO POSITION WITH REGARD TO THE \nDEVELOPMENT OF LEGISLATION AS REFERENCED IN THE PLAN OR TO THE LEGISLATIVE \nPRINCIPLES APPENDED TO THIS DOCUMENT. \n64 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-3   Filed 10/07/09   Page 66 of 75\n2.

People with disabilities have the same rights as all other citizens and residents. \nThey will establish, with assistance when necessary, where they want to live, with whom they \nwant to live, and how their time will be occupied. \n2.  All recipients shall enjoy fundamental rights relative to the provision of services \nand supports. These fundamental rights, consistent with personal choice, include the right \nto: \nA.  Be treated with respect and enjoy personal privacy; \nB.  Worship in accordance with the individual=s beliefs; \nC.  Manage one's own financial affairs and assets and if unable to do so, receive \nregular accounts of all  funds  belonging to the individual that are held or \nadministered by others; \nD.  Normal  living  conditions,  including  the  areas  of dress,  grooming, \nmovement, sexual expression and relationships, and use of personal time; \nF.  Be taught skills needed for the tasks of daily living; \nG.  To have reasonable visits, exercise, communication, diet and nutrition; \nH.  Receive all services and supports identified in an individual plan for services and \nsupports within a reasonably prompt period of time, including medical, dental, adaptive \nequipment and other health related services, in a manner which insures accessibility, \nquality and continuity of care. \nFREEDOM FROM HARM \n3. Individuals shall be free from mental and physical abuse, seclusion and other \nharm, including clinically inappropriate physical restraint. \n4. Chemical restraints shall not be administered on an Aas needed® basis (PRN), \nand shall be considered a controlled procedure subject to review under District policy \ngoverning controlled procedures. \n5. Upon reasonable belief that a recipient is at imminent risk of serious harm due \nto his or her circumstances or situation, the District shall take all steps necessary to \nimmediately protect the individual. \n68 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-3   Filed 10/07/09   Page 70 of 75\n6. Any individual or entity who subjects an applicant or recipient of services to harm \nor otherwise violates the fundamental rights of an individual with developmental disabilities \nshall be subjected to the imposition of civil fines or other appropriate sanctions. \n7. The District must refer abuse and neglect to appropriate law enforcement agencies \nfor prosecution under law and shall recommend the enactment of such penal statutes as may \nbe necessary to protect vulnerable adults.z3 \nINDIVIDUAL CHOICE \n8. The needs and desires of the individual shall govern the development of all plans of \nservices and supports. To that end, all District agencies must establish a structure that enables \nthem to coordinate their efforts to facilitate the provision of services appropriate according to \nthe individual=s needs and desires.  Coordination contemplates the removal of administrative \nobstacles for the provision of services for an individual, as well as the transition from one \nagency=s service system to that of another. \n9. All recipients shall receive services and supports in the least restrictive environment, \nleast separate, most integrated that is appropriate to an individual=s needs.  Toward this end, \neach individual shall be offered a choice of services and supports: \n(A) in less rather than more structured settings; \n23 \nTHE FOLLOWING HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS LANGUAGE TO BE INCLUDED IN \nSUCH PENAL STATUTES: \nA. ANYP  ERSON WHO KNOWINGLY OR WILLFULLY OR THROUGH CULPABLE \nNEGLIGENCE, FAILS TO DISCHARGE A DUTY TO PROVIDE CARE AND SERVICES \nNECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OF A \nVULNERABLE ADULT (AS DEFINED IN STATUTE} THAT A PRUDENT PERSON \nWOULD DEEM ESSENTIAL FOR THE WELL-BEING OF THE ADULT IS GUILTY OF \nCRIMINAL NEGLECT OF THE VULNERABLE ADULT. \nB. ANYP  ERSON WHO INTENTIONALLY OR KNOWINGLY ASSAULTS OR \nTHREATENS TO ASSAULT, UNREASONABLY CONFINES OR INVOLUNTARILY \nSECLUDES A VULNERABLE ADULT (AS DEFINED IN STATUTE} IS GUILTY OF \nCRIMINAL ABUSE OF THE VULNERABLE ADULT. \n69 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-3   Filed 10/07/09   Page 71 of 75\n(B) in smaller rather than larger living homes; \n(C) in independent rather than dependent living situations; \n(D) in integrated community settings; \n(E) that are consistent with and based upon an individual=s voluntary and \ninformed choices and preferences; \n(F) that are culturally and linguistically competent. \n10.  Each individual shall be presumed to be competent (irrespective of commitment \nstatus) and to have capacity to make choices and decisions.  An individual with developmental \ndisabilities who lacks cognitive, communicative and educational capacity to make autonomous \ndecisions shall be provided with assistance in making decisions and/ or expressing consent. \nSUBSTITUTED TUDGMENT \n-\n11.  In the event that an individual lacks capacity to make decisions: \nA.  Assistance in decision making should be the least restrictive intervention  and for \nB.  Surrogate decision makers must use the substituted judgment standard rather \nthan the best interests standard (i.e.,, the decision should be based on what the \nperson would have decided if the person had capacity, rather than what the \nsurrogate believes to be in the person=s best interest); \nC.  Limited guardianship is preferable to plenary guardianship; \nD.  Guardians and other surrogates shall be required to have regular training \nabout the rights, roles and responsibilities of a substitute decision maker; \nE.  No individual who operates or is an employee of an entity in which an \nincapacitated person receives treatment, support and services can serve as \nguardian for the incapacitated person; \nF.  Guardianships will be reviewed at least semi-annually at which point the \nguardian will make a report in writing to the Court. \nTRAINING \n12. Any entity or individual C including administrative and community support staff- \nproviding supports and services will receive training and will be, consistent with this training \nrequirement, demonstrably competent and knowledgeable prior to providing supports and \nservices and at all other times. \n13. Any individual providing supports and services shall have demonstrable knowledge \nof the needs of the individual to whom they provide service and supports, including but not \nlimited to the contents of the individual service plan, the medical needs of the individual and \n70 \n\nCase 1:76-cv-00293-ESH   Document 1138-3   Filed 10/07/09   Page 72 of 75\nother critical information.  Persons providing itinerant services (e.g., transportation) will have \ndemonstrable knowledge of relevant medical and other health related needs of those individuals \nto whom services are provided. \n14.  All District staff with oversight, certification, case management and investigative \nresponsibilities must demonstrate competence in the areas enumerated above in Principle #12. \nSERVICES AND SUPPORTS \n15.  All services required by a recipient shall be identified in full in all assessments and \nplans of services and supports, whether or not such services are currently available. The District \n[Administration], moreover, must provide each recipient all supports and services identified in \nthat person=s plan of supports and services within a reasonably prompt period of time. \n16.

Fenty,”1 (“2010 Plan”), Special Master Clarence J. Sundram has submitted a Report and \nRecommendation regarding defendants’ certification of compliance with the remaining outcome \ncriteria for Goal A.1, Individualized Habilitation Plans.  (See Special Master’s Report and \nRecommendation Regarding Individualized Habilitation Plans – Part II, Dec. 9, 2014 [ECF No. \n1506], as amended, see Errata, Jan. 7, 2015 [ECF No. 1510] (“R&R-Part II”); Director’s \nCertification of Compliance, Evans Goal A.1, Individualized Habilitation Plan (Outcome Criteria \nii, iii, vii, viii, ix, x, xii, xvi and xvii), June 30, 2014 (filed with the Court as Exhibit 1 to the \n                                                 \n1 The 2010 Plan was filed on July 13, 2010 [ECF No. 1200], and approved on August 10, 2010 \n[ECF No. 1204]. \n\nR&R-Part II [ECF No. 1506-1]) (“Certification-Part II”).)  Following the Special Master’s first \nReport and Recommendation regarding Goal A.1 (see Special Master’s Report and \nRecommendation Regarding Individualized Habilitation Plans, Oct. 15, 2013 [ECF No. 1418] \n(“R&R-Part I”) and the Court’s Order approving and adopting that Report and Recommendation \n(see Order, Nov. 27, 2013 [ECF No. 1426]), eight criteria from Goal A.1 remained outstanding \nin full (ii, iii, vii, ix, x, xii, xvi, xvii), and one criterion (viii) remained outstanding in part.  The \nSpecial Master now recommends that the Court find that defendants (1) have met their burden of \nproof of compliance with respect to criteria ii, vii, xvi, and xvii; (2) have achieved partial \ncompliance with respect to criteria iii, viii, x (part C), and xii (parts B-D); and (3) have not met \ntheir burden of proof of compliance with respect to criteria ix and the remaining parts of criteria \niii, viii, x (parts A, B and part of D), and xii (part A).  Plaintiffs have not filed any objections, but \ndefendants challenge the Special Master’s adherence to the 2010 Plan’s threshold for “high” \ncompliance as well as his recommended findings of noncompliance as to criteria viii, x.D, and \nxii.A.  (Defs.’ Objections to the R&R-Part II at 1, Jan. 8, 2015 [ECF No. 1512-1] \n(“Objections”).)  For the reasons explained herein, the Court will partially sustain defendants’ \nobjection as to criteria viii, but will otherwise approve and adopt the pending Report and \nRecommendation in its entirety.2   \nI.  THRESHOLD FOR “HIGH” COMPLIANCE \nUnder the 2010 Plan, the standard of compliance for Goal A.1 is “high” (2010 Plan at \n                                                 \n2 Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53(f)(3) and the 2007 Supplemental Order of \nReference in this case, when objections to a special master’s findings of fact and/or \nrecommendations are raised, those findings/recommendations are subject to de novo court \nreview.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 53(f)(3); see also 2007 Supplemental Order of Reference ¶ (V)(4) at \n4, May 3, 2007 [ECF No. 920].) \n2 \n\n12),3 which is defined as follows: \nThis threshold requires compliance with the indicator at a rate generally \nexceeding 90 percent compliance. Where instances of noncompliance with the \nindicator are found, none can involve a serious and substantive violation of the \nCourt Order with significant adverse impact upon class members (i.e., actual harm \nor a serious risk of harm) in the judgment of the Court and Special Master (e.g., \nexcusable noncompliance may involve failure to comply with documentation or \nsome aspect of process, without significant adverse impact). Generally speaking, \nthis level of compliance will be expected for important programmatic aspects of \nthe Court Orders. \n \n(2010 Plan at 6 (emphasis added).)   \nIn defendants’ Certification-Part II, they suggested, for the first time, that the 2010 Plan’s \ndefinition of “high compliance” was too demanding.  (Certification-Part II at 3.)  They pointed \nout therein that they had never “agreed” to a 90% threshold for “high” compliance, that certain \noutcome criteria do not lend themselves to numerical analysis, and that requiring 90% \ncompliance was virtually unprecedented in any intellectual and developmental disability service \ndelivery system across the country.4  (Certification-Part II at 3.)  After an extensive discussion, \nthe Special Master concluded that, while determining a numerical “rate” of compliance was not \nalways easy, none of defendants’ concerns merited jettisoning the approach established by the \n2010 Plan.  (See R&R-Part II at 3-7.)   \n                                                 \n3 As the parties are well aware, for each of the nine subject areas covered by existing court \norders, the 2010 Plan sets forth “specific outcome criteria for determining compliance with the \nrelated group of Court Orders,” assigns a standard of compliance (“full,” “high,” or \n“significant”), and “identifies the method by which the Special Master, and ultimately the Court, \nwill assess compliance for each set of outcome criteria.”  (2010 Plan at 5-6.)   \n4 To support this last point, defendants pointed out that the federal Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid (“CMS”) recently decided “to use 86% as the threshold for performance in reviewing \nquality assurances by states for the Home and Community-Based Services (“HCBS”) waiver \nprogram, before requiring a quality improvement project to improve performance.”  (R&R-Part \nII at 3 (citing Certification-Part II at 3).) \n3 \n\nDefendants now object to the Special Master’s “discussion” of the threshold of \ncompliance, raising the same arguments they made in their certification, and ask the Court for \ntwo specific things: (1) that a percentage compliance rate of less than 90% on a particular JMQ \nquestion should not be “summarily held as a showing of non-compliance”; and (2) that “the \n[90%] threshold of [high] compliance can and should be revisited by this Court in evaluating the \nremaining elements of the 2010 Plan and the underlying court orders in recognition of the \nprogress that has been made as evidenced by the Court orders to date finding compliance with 59 \nof 70 or more than 84 percent of the outcome criteria in the 2010 Exit Plan.”  (Objections at 12-\n13.)   \nThe Court agrees with defendants’ first point, which does not actually conflict with \nanything said by the Special Master in his Report and Recommendation.  The 90% threshold for \n“high” compliance is to be measured with respect to the outcome criteria in the 2010 Plan; it \ndoes not require a score of 90% or above for each individual question on the Joint Monitoring \nQuestionnaire (“JMQ”) assigned to that outcome criterion.  Thus, an underlying JMQ score may \nfall below the 90% threshold without precluding defendants from demonstrating compliance.   \nAs for defendants’ second point, it is not entirely clear what defendants mean by asking \nthe Court to “revisit” the standard for high compliance, but the Court does not believe that any \nsuch change is necessary.  As defendants acknowledge, “high” compliance at 90% is the \nstandard set forth in the 2010 Plan and approved by the Court, and they maintain that they are \nnot suggesting “that the 90 percent compliance standard should be fully obviated at this late date \nand a wholesale revision to another standard should be adopted.”  (Objections at 10.)  As the \nSpecial Master notes, “it can hardly be concluded that the subsequent 2010 revision of the 2001 \nPlan set an unreasonable threshold for demonstrating compliance.”  (R&R-Part II at 5.)  \n4 \n\nMoreover, although certain outcome criteria may lend themselves more to quantitative analysis, \nthe Court agrees with the Special Master that that does not render the approach of the 2010 Plan \nunworkable, but rather that “[i]n interpreting and enforcing compliance, the Court has had no \ndifficulty in assessing whether the evidence proffered by the parties met the obligations \nembodied in these orders.”  (R&R-Part II at 5; see also id. at 4 (“[T]hese thresholds of \ncompliance have been used consistently in the certification process since 2010 by the Court \nMonitor in the Joint Monitoring review, by the Plaintiffs, by the Independent Compliance \nAdministrator, by the Defendants themselves, by the Special Master and by the Court -- without \nobjection from any party until now.”).  Accordingly, the Court agrees with the Special Master \nthat there is no need to alter the 2010 Plan’s requirement that sets 90% as the threshold for \nachieving a “high” standard of compliance and that all of defendants’ valid concerns can be \naccommodated within the existing compliance framework.    \nII.  CRITERION viii   \nCriterion viii for Goal A.1 requires that “[c]onsumers receive the services and supports \nidentified in the ISP on a timely basis.”  (2010 Plan at 11 (emphasis added).)  In the first R&R \nregarding individual habilitation plans, the Special Master advised defendants to develop a “Plan \nof Correction” as to criterion viii to address deficiencies with respect to “nutrition, OT \n[occupational therapy], medical and mental health services.”  (R&R-Part I at 14; see R&R-Part II \nat 22.)5  The Special Master now recommends finding defendants in compliance with criterion \nviii with respect to nutrition and mental health services, but not in compliance as to occupational \n                                                 \n5 The Special Master recommended finding defendants in compliance with respect to other \nservices and supports in the ISP (R&R-Part I at 14), and the Court adopted that recommendation.  \n(Order at 2, Nov. 27, 2013 [ECF No. 1426].) \n5 \n\ntherapy or medical services.  (R&R-Part II at 25.)  Defendants object to the Special Master’s \nrecommended findings of non-compliance.  As explained herein, the Court agrees with \ndefendants that they have demonstrated compliance as to occupational therapy services, but \nagrees with the Special Master that they have not yet demonstrated compliance as to medical \nservices. \nA.  Occupational Therapy (“OT”) Services \nThe Special Master’s negative recommendation with respect to OT services appears to \nrest primarily on the responses to JMQ question 102(B) which asked whether, if recommended \nby a therapist or ordered by a doctor, there was “a current occupational therapy assessment” in \nthe ISP.  (Objections at 19.)  Out of a sample size of 4, there was only a single positive response, \nwhich suggested that recommendations for follow up OT assessments were completed only 25% \nof the time.  (Id.)  Although JMQ question 102(B) was not formally assigned to criterion viii, the \nSpecial Master concluded that “deficiencies in completing recommendations for OT assessments \nduring the ISP plan year” were “relevant in assessing the timely delivery of services” under \ncriterion viii.  (R&R-Part II at 24.)  The Special Master also noted that defendants had \n“acknowledged the inadequacies of their network of providers to timely deliver some of the \nrequired clinical services,” and that there was a lack of evidence to date that defendants’ actions \nto build capacity pursuant to the Plan of Correction have taken effect or improved the situation.   \nDefendants’ objections to the Special Master’s recommendation with respect to OT \nservices are persuasive.  As defendants point out, the evidentiary significance of the 25% score \nin response to JMQ question 102(B) is questionable given the small sample size.  In addition, the \nCourt does not agree with the Special Master that the failure to complete recommended follow-\nup assessments is directly relevant to criterion viii.  JMQ question 102(B), along with a number \n6 \n\nof other similar questions, was assigned by the parties to criterion iii, while other JMQ questions \nwere assigned to criterion viii.  Criterion iii requires that “ISPs will be based upon individualized \nassessments” while criterion viii “simply asks whether the services and supports identified in the \nplan are delivered.”  (R&R-Part I at 10.)  In the Court’s view, the failure to complete a follow up \nOT assessment is relevant to criterion iii, which focuses on the content of the ISP, but is not \nrelevant to criterion viii, which focuses on its implementation.6  Finally, in terms of the specific \nquestions about OT services that were assigned to criterion viii, there are two reported scores that \nfall below 90% (JMQ 118a and JMQ 248a), but defendants address both and identify flaws in the \nanalysis of the underlying data that, if corrected, would bring both numbers close to or above \n90%.  (See Objections at 20-22.)  Accordingly, having considered defendants’ objections and the \nentire record herein, the Court will reject the Special Master’s recommendation and find \ndefendants in compliance as to the OT services component of criterion viii. \nB.  Medical Services \nThe Special Master concludes that defendants have not demonstrated compliance with \nthe medical services component of criterion viii based on the low scores in response to JMQ \nquestion 81, subparts (b) and (d), the underlying deficiencies that resulted in the negative \nresponses (which were described by plaintiffs in their objections to the certification), and \ndefendants’ failure to counter either the low scores or plaintiffs’ objections with other evidence \nof compliance: \nIn the face of low compliance scores for some relevant questions on the JMQ \nrelating to healthcare and medical services, and a series of objections to a finding \n                                                 \n6 Defendants have not challenged the finding of noncompliance as to the OT services component \nof criterion iii.  In light of the Court’s opinion, the Special Master may wish to revisit his \nconclusion not to consider the responses to JMQ Question 102(B) in his consideration of any \nfuture certification on criterion iii. \n7 \n\nof compliance in the Plaintiffs’ Response (pp. 7-9), Defendants have not \nsubmitted adequate evidence to sustain their burden of proof that the actions that \nthey have taken or are taking have yet produced the outcomes for class members \nthat is necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligation to provide the \nservices and supports identified in the ISP on a timely basis.   \n \n(See R&R-Part II at 24-25.) \nIn this instance, the Court agrees with the Special Master’s reasoning and conclusion.  \nJMQ question 81(b) asks: “Is the individual receiving the services identified in the ISP” with \nrespect to “medical” services?  JMQ question 81(d) asked the same question with respect to \n“healthcare” services.  The responses indicate that only 82.4% (42/51) of the class members in \nthe sample were receiving the medical services identified in the ISP, while only 69.2% (36/52) \nwere receiving the healthcare services identified in the ISP.7  (Certification-Part II at 19, 50-51.)  \nDefendants suggest that these scores should be discounted because the nature of JMQ question \n81 means that a single failure to timely provide an identified medical or healthcare service will \nresult in a “no” response even if all other identified services are timely provided:   \n[T]here are a significant number of contributing JMQ measures that can result in a \nnegative response.  This question is a ‘summary result’ in the defendants’ view \nand one that rules the District in compliance (Yes) if found to be 100% correct out \nof multiple outcome measures, or out of compliance (No) regardless if 14 out of 5 \nmeasures were met, or 1 out of 15 measures were met, and as such is not fairly \nreflective of the defendants’ status of compliance.  Thus, if class member John \nDoes has 30 health care needs identified in his ISP (measured by JMQ question \n81(d) and of those 30 needs 29 are being addressed, but one is not, then, per the \nCourt Monitor the defendants are out of compliance with JMQ question 81(D) \nrelative to this John Doe.  The more appropriate result would be that the \ndefendants are 97% compliant (29/30) with JMQ question 81(d) relative to class \nmember John Doe.  It is the academic equivalent of not getting any credit for your \nwork on a mathematics problem even though there was a single mistake in \ncomputation.  Thus the defendants disagree that JMQ question 81 is a strong \nindicator of compliance with this outcome criterion and would request that the \n                                                 \n7 Although the Plan of Correction for criterion viii refers only to medical services, the applicable \nJMQ questions distinguish between medical and healthcare services. \n8 \n\nCourt make a finding, based on the defendants’ Plan of correction and whatever \nweight it deems appropriate to JMQ question 81. \n \n(Objections at 23.)  In theory, defendants are right about the shortcomings of JMQ question 81 \nand the arguably reduced significance of negative responses thereto, but they have not made any \nattempt to establish that any particular “no” response is due only to the failure to provide one out \nof many medical services in an ISP.  Perhaps that information can be gleaned from the existing \nJMQs, but it is not before the Court.  In addition, even without these low scores, the examples of \ndeficiencies cited by plaintiffs remain unrebutted by defendants.  Accordingly, the Court will \nadopt the Special Master’s recommendation and find that defendants have not yet demonstrated \ncompliance as to the medical services component for criterion viii. \nIII.  CRITERION x.D \nCritierion x.D provides that “ISPs must address the consumers’ need for . . . medical, \ndental and health and mental health services which provide for accessibility, quality and \ncontinuity of care.”  (2010 Plan at 11.)  The Special Master has concluded that “the evidence \nsupports a finding of compliance with respect to dental and mental health services, but that the \nDefendants have failed to carry their burden of proof of compliance with respect to health and \nmedical services” due to the “Joint Monitoring findings regarding deficiencies in preventive \nservices.”  (R&R-Part II at 19-20.)  Specifically, the Special Master is referring to the responses \nto JMQ question 148, which asks: “Is there evidence that age and gender appropriate \npreventative health care is provided in a consistent and current manner?”  (R&R-Part II at 18-\n19.)  The answer to this question was yes for only 66.5% (33/50) of the class members surveyed.  \n(R&R-Part II at 19.)  Defendants attempted to address this low score by submitting to the Special \nMaster a comprehensive report on the health screenings received by over 500 of the Evans class \nmembers (see Defs.’ Reply in Support of Certification Ex. 1 (“Short Report: Adherence To \n9 \n\nPreventive Health Services Study,” Georgetown University Center for Excellence in \nDevelopmental Disabilities (2014) (“Georgetown Report”) (filed with the Court as Exhibit 16 to \nthe R&R-Part II [ECF No. 1506-16]), but the Special Master concluded that while the \nGeorgetown Report showed that there “are clearly areas of strong performance regarding \npreventive services,” it also confirmed deficiencies in the types of screenings that had led to the \nnegative responses to JMQ question 148.8   \nDefendants object, arguing that the Special Master has misinterpreted the data in the \nGeorgetown Report because “citation to percentages for preventive screenings . . . in the absence \nof knowing the risk factors that would otherwise necessitate such screenings for people in the \nsample, is not a particularly meaningful measure of whether the ISPs address a person’s need \n[for a screening].”  (Objections at 16-17.)  They further assert that: \nThe authors of the report have verified that the results in fact did not ascertain \nwhether each person should have had each of the identified screenings but rather \nwas a report of the frequency by which the relevant population is receiving such \nscreenings, and without a deeper analysis of a person’s full health and lifestyle \nprofile a reviewer cannot determine if each screening is required. In the \ndefendants’ view, being held in non-compliance for all health and medical \nservices on the grounds of questionable data regarding preventive health care \nscreenings which the class members receive at a significantly high rate is an \noverly broad determination. \n \n(Objections at 17.)  The weakness in defendant’s argument is twofold.  First, they assert that the \nauthors of the report have “verified” that the screening percentages do not account for whether a \nscreening was required for that individual, but cite no source to support that assertion.  Second, \n                                                 \n8 Specifically, the negative responses to JMQ question 148 reflected missed screens for skin \ncancer, hepatitis, glaucoma, diabetes and liver function (see Pls.’ Resp. to Certification-Part II at \n18), while the Georgetown Report showed that of the class members surveyed “only 27.7% \nreceived a skin cancer screen; 69.4 % screened for hepatitis B and C; [and] 88.2% for \nglaucoma.”  (R&R-Part II at 19.)   \n10 \n\nthat assertion appears to contradict the report itself which presents the data as showing the \n“proportion of individuals receiving appropriate preventive health screenings.”  (Georgetown \nReport at 3.)  In addition, even if defendants’ interpretation of the data in the Georgetown Report \nis correct, that does not negate the evidence from the JMQ that all necessary screenings were \nprovided (or at least reflected in the ISP) only 63.5% of the time.  As defendants bear the burden \nof proving compliance, the absence of evidence to counter this low score leads the Court to agree \nwith the Special Master that defendants have not yet demonstrated compliance with the medical \nand health care components of criterion x.D.  Accordingly, the Court will adopt the Special \nMaster’s recommendation and find that defendants have not yet demonstrated compliance with \nthese components of criterion x.D.     \nIV.  CRITERION xii.A \nCriterion xii provides that: “For persons with physical disabilities, the ISP must provide \nfor individualized adaptive equipment, as needed, based on appropriate professional evaluations \nof the need for such equipment.”  (2010 Plan at 11.)  Subpart A provides that “An assessment of \nthe need for adaptive equipment is completed within 30 days of a request therefor.”  (Id.)  \nDespite the lack of objection from plaintiffs, the Special Master concluded that defendants had \n“not met their burden of proof of compliance with respect to this criterion” because “there are no \nJMQs addressing this provision, nor is there any other evidence in the record specifically \naddressing the timeliness of assessments regarding the need for adaptive equipment.”  (R&R-\nPart II at 11.)  Defendants object on the ground that “[i]n the absence of a disagreement \nregarding compliance,” the Special Master should not have “intervene[d].”  (Objections at 14.)  \nThey “respectfully request that the Court disregard the Special Master’s recommendation relative \nto Goal A.1., outcome criterion xii.A, and enter a finding of the defendants’ compliance for this \n11 \n\noutcome measure.”  (Objections at 14.) \n  In support of their contention that the Special Master should not have “intervene[d]” \nabsent an objection from plaintiffs, defendants point to language in the 2010 Plan and in the \nSpecial Master’s order setting forth procedures for the certification of compliance.  (See 2010 \nPlan ¶ 7; Procedure for Director’s Certification of Compliance ¶ 9, Aug. 16, 2012 [ECF No. \n1332] (“Procedure Order”).)  Paragraph 7 in the 2010 Plan includes the following language:   \nThe Plan provides that as the implementation process proceeds, defendants will \nutilize information generated from internal monitoring processes to determine \nwhen they believe they have met the standards for compliance with the identified \noutcome criteria for each set of actions related to a group of Court Orders.  At this \npoint, defendants shall approach plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor to see if they \nconcur that there is compliance with the set of actions and outcome criteria.  If \nthere is no agreement, the defendants can move the Special Master for a finding \nof compliance as to these Court Orders and can seek to have the related Court \nOrders vacated and dismissed.   \n \n(2010 Plan ¶ 7.)  Paragraph 9 in the Procedure Order states:  \nIf the plaintiffs of plaintiff-intervenor object to any portion of the Director’s \nCertification, the Special Master shall, in consultation with the parties, issue a \nScheduling Order to hear and resolve the objection. The procedure for resolution \nof the objection may include informal conferences with the parties, submission of \ndocumentation evidence and briefs, or an evidentiary hearing on the record as the \nSpecial Master deems appropriate.” \n \n(Procedure Order ¶ 9.)  With respect to criterion xii.A, though, defendants did not obtain \nplaintiffs’ concurrence as to compliance prior to their submission to the Special Master.9  (2010 \nPlan ¶ 7.)  Rather, in accordance with the Procedure Order, they submitted their certification of \ncompliance to the Special Master for his review, plaintiffs filed their response to the certification, \nand the Special Master submitted a “Report to the Court with findings of fact and conclusions of \n                                                 \n9 Nor have the parties “move[d] jointly for an Order vacating and dismissing the related Court \nOrders.”  (2010 Plan ¶ 7.)   \n12 \n\nlaw regarding the defendants’ compliance with the relevant provisions of the 2010 Plan and \nrelated court orders.”  (Procedure Order ¶¶ 8, 10.)  Irrespective of whether plaintiffs object to the \ncertification, defendants bear the “burden of proof of compliance” (id. ¶ 5), and the Special \nMaster’s submission of a report is required even if there are no objections to the certification by \nplaintiffs or plaintiff-intervenor.  (Id. ¶ 8.)  Accordingly, the Court concludes that even though \nplaintiffs did not object to defendants’ certification as to criterion xii.A, the Special Master \nproperly “assess[ed] compliance for each set of outcome criteria” submitted to him by \ndefendants and submitted his recommendations to the Court.  (2010 Plan ¶ 6.)  As the Special \nMaster did not improperly “intervene,” and as defendants suggest no substantive basis for \nrejecting his recommendation as to criterion xii.A, the Court will adopt this recommendation and \nfind that defendants have not yet demonstrated compliance with criterion xii.A. \nCONCLUSION \nAccordingly, upon consideration of the Special Master’s Report and Recommendation, \ndefendants’ objections thereto, and the entire record herein, it is hereby \n  ORDERED that the Court APPROVES AND ADOPTS IN PART the Special Master’s \nReport and Recommendation Regarding Individual Habilitation Services – Part II, as amended \n[ECF Nos. 1506, 1510]; it is further  \n  ORDERED that the Court SUSTAINS defendants’ objections insofar as the report \nrecommends finding noncompliance as to the occupational therapy services component of Goal \nA.1, criterion viii; it is further  \nORDERED that the Court agrees with the Special Master that defendants have achieved \ncompliance with Goal A.1 outcome criteria ii, vii, xvi, and xvii, and have achieved partial \ncompliance with outcome criteria iii [specify], viii (nutrition and mental health services), x (part \n13 \n\nC), and xii (parts B, C, and D (dental and mental health services)); it is further \nORDERED that the Court agrees with the Special Master that defendants have not yet \ndemonstrated compliance with Goal A.1 outcome criterion ix, the remainder of criterion iii, the \nmedical services component of criterion viii, criterion x (parts A, B and part of D (medical and \nhealth services), and criterion xii (part A).  It is further \nORDERED that the parties, in conjunction with the Special Master, the Independent \nCompliance Administrator, and the Court Monitor, shall develop a plan for defendants to \nresubmit their certifications as to the remaining outcome criteria for Goal A.1. \n \n \n \n/s/   Ellen Segal Huvelle       \n  ELLEN SEGAL HUVELLE \n  United States District Judge \n \nDate:  March 31, 2015 \n14 ",

HARRIS, District Judge. \nBefore the Court are plaintiffs' motion for sanctions, plaintiff-intervenor's memorandum in \nsupport thereof, defendants' motion for modification of the 1983 Consent Order, the Special \nMaster's Recommended Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law regarding the preceding \nmotions, and related pleadings. Also before the Court are defendants' demand for a jury \ntrial and related pleadings. On July 22, 1998, the parties presented their positions to the \nCourt in a hearing on the legal issues pertinent to the pending motions. Upon full \nconsideration of all the pleadings and the entire record, the Court adopts in part, and rejects \nin part, the Special Master's Recommended Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.[1] \nBackground \nPlaintiffs are members of a class consisting of former residents of the long-since closed \nForest Haven facility. An integral part of this litigation has been the relocation of the class \nmembers from Forest Haven to community living arrangements with adequate habilitation \nsuited to each class member. To this end, the Court has entered numerous orders, \n\nincluding consent orders agreed to by the parties to safeguard the rights of class members \nand ensure their adequate and appropriate habilitation. \nA Consent Order was entered on February 8, 1983 (\"1983 Consent Order\"). To help ensure \na viable network of private vendors which would provide the class members with \nappropriate care (\"Evans, care providers\"), the Consent Order required defendants to pay \nfor goods and services within 30 days of the receipt of an acceptable voucher. Consent \nOrder, Feb. 8, 1983, Section IX, Para. 10. On October 11, 1995, the Court found \ndefendants in contempt of the 1983 Consent Order for failure to make timely vendor \npayments during the years 1994 and 1995. The Court appointed a Special Master to \nrecommend a plan for purgation of defendants' contempt. \nThe Special Master submitted a report on January 22, 1996, and a supplemental report on \nJune 17, 1996. On August 2, 1996, the Court issued an Order adopting in large part the \nSpecial Master's recommendations. In that Order, the Court updated its October 11, 1995, \nfinding of contempt by concluding that defendants continued to be in contempt between \nOctober 11, 1995, and June 17, 1996 (when the Special Master submitted her supplemental \nreport). In the \"Order Adopting Proposed Findings of Fact of Special Master,\" the Court \nstated in part: \nDefendants have, for over two years, chronically and unapologetically violated the terms of \nnearly every aspect of this Court's multiple Consent Orders. Defendants' unrelenting \ncontempt of this Court's orders and their seeming inability to bring themselves into \ncompliance therewith, have created chaos for the care providers vested with day-to-day \nresponsibility for the members of this plaintiff class.... \n... Now, the point has been reached beyond which this Court will not tolerate 90*90 further \nand continuing incidences of contempt by defendants. Any further noncompliance with this \nCourt's longstanding Consent Orders, and noncompliance with the Remedial Plan issued \nthis date, must be expected by defendants to result in serious consequences. \nAccompanying that Order, the Court also issued a Remedial Plan (\"Remedial Plan\"). The \nRemedial Plan reasserted defendants' obligation (originally imposed in the 1983 Consent \nOrder) to pay acceptable vendors' vouchers within 30 days of their submission (Section I.B). \nThe Remedial Plan also established the conditions by which defendants could purge their \ncivil contempt as adjudicated by the Court's October 11, 1995, and the August 2, 1996, \nOrders. Section I.D of the Remedial Plan states: \nAccordingly, it hereby is \nORDERED, that should defendants fail to purge their contempt by paying acceptable \nprovider invoices within 30 days of submission, as required by this Remedial Plan, at the \nend of the first month in which defendants report that there are outstanding Medicaid \npayments due but not paid within 30 days of submission of an acceptable invoice, \ndefendants shall be assessed a coercive civil fine of $5,000 a day, until the overdue \npayments are made.... It hereby further is \nORDERED, that with respect to non-Medicaid payments found to be overdue, defendants \nshall be assessed a coercive civil fine of twice the amount overdue.... It hereby further is \n\nORDERED, that civil fines shall be paid to the Clerk of the Court and placed in a segregated \naccount, from which the Court, at the recommendation of the Special Master, may order \npayment to providers. \nSuch fines are to be calculated by relying upon the information provided by defendants' \nsworn monthly submissions to the Court (required by Section I.C of the Remedial Plan) \nlisting Medicaid and non-Medicaid vendors who have not been paid within the required 30-\nday time period. \nOn April 2, 1997, plaintiffs filed a motion for sanctions for defendants' alleged violation of \nthe provisions of the Remedial Plan requiring timely payment of Evans care providers.[2] \nDefendants filed their opposition to plaintiffs' motion for sanctions as well as their own \nmotion for modification of the 30-day payment period which was established by the 1983 \nConsent Order and reaffirmed by the Remedial Plan. \nPlaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor contend that defendants have conceded, in their sworn \nsubmissions to the Court, their failure to comply with the provisions of the Remedial Plan \nregarding timely payment of vendors, and that sanctions should therefore be imposed. \nDefendants contend that no sanctions should be imposed because they were unable to \ncomply with the timeliness provisions of the Remedial Plan. Defendants also request \nmodification of both the 1983 Consent Order and the Remedial Plan pursuant to Federal \nRules 60(b)(5) and (6) to extend the 30-day payment period to 45 days, a proposal which is \nopposed by both plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor. Defendants further contend that even if \nsanctions were applicable, the sanctions may not properly be imposed absent a criminal \njury trial because the proposed fines allegedly are criminal rather than civil in nature. \nUpon consideration of plaintiffs' and defendants' motions, the Special Master filed her \nRecommended Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on January 26, 1998. The Special \nMaster concluded that defendants owed more than $6 million in fines pursuant to the \nRemedial Plan.[3] She concluded that half of that amount is due for defendants' failure to \npurge their 1995 contempt by complying with the timeliness provisions of the 91*91 \nRemedial Plan. She found that the other half is due for defendants' violation of the \nRemedial Plan's independent provision reasserting the 1983 Consent Order's requirement \nthat defendants pay uncontested vendors' vouchers within 30 days of submission. Such \nfines, the Special Master concluded, automatically are triggered by the Remedial Plan's \nown provisions upon defendants' admission of noncompliance and, thus, no motion by \nplaintiffs should be necessary to prompt defendants' payment of the appropriate fines. She \nalso proposed amendment of the Remedial Plan to clarify that the fines are automatic and \nto provide for their implementation. The Special Master also recommended rejecting \ndefendants' motion to modify the 30-day payment period for vendors, as required in the \n1983 Consent Order and the Remedial Plan. \nIn addition, the Special Master offered several independent modifications to the 1983 \nConsent Order and the Remedial Plan: (1) changing the amount of the per diem fines for \ndelinquent Medicaid payments and replacing the current fines for delinquent non-Medicaid \npayments with per diem fines; (2) including a provision that would permit forgiveness of per \ndiem fines assessed for failure to make timely payments if defendants paid vendors within \n45 days of the submission of uncontested vouchers; and (3) requiring the Special Master, \n\nwithin a year of the date of this Opinion, to propose a plan for the disposition of the fines \npaid by defendants, including suggestions regarding their utilization to establish a \nmechanism to protect the habilitation interests of the plaintiff class after the hoped-for \nconclusion of this now 23-year-old lawsuit. \nOn February 9, 1998, defendants appealed the Special Master's recommendations to this \nCourt. On February 20, 1998, defendants filed a jury demand and their objections to the \nSpecial Master's Recommended Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. Also on that \ndate, plaintiffs filed their response and objections to the Special Master's Recommended \nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and the United States filed a memorandum in \nsupport of the Special Master's recommendations.[4] On July 22, 1998, the Court held a \nhearing on the legal issues raised by the pending motions and the Special Master's \nRecommended Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (and the objections and responses \nthereto). \nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law \nThe Court adopts the Special Master's conclusion that defendants owe substantial fines due \nto their noncompliance with the purgation conditions of the Remedial Plan, and relies on her \nfactual determinations in calculating the amount owed.[5] Thus, the Court grants plaintiffs' \nmotion for sanctions. However, the Court does not adopt the Special Master's position that \nsuch fines are automatic in nature and that no action on the part of plaintiffs, plaintiff-\nintervenor, or the Court is necessary to render them due. Accordingly, the Court also \ndeclines to accept her recommendation that the Remedial Plan 92*92 be amended to clarify \nthe automatic nature of the fines and to provide an administrative mechanism for their \ncollection. As to defendants' motion for modification of the 30-day period for payment of \nvouchers, the Court adopts the Special Master's recommendation that it be denied. \nThe Court also adopts the Special Master's independent suggestions that, for the sake of \ncomparability and efficiency, the per diem fine for delinquent payment of Medicaid vouchers \nbe increased and that the non-Medicaid fine be changed to a per diem fine. Furthermore, \nthe Court adopts her recommendation that the Remedial Plan be amended to permit \nforgiveness of fines accrued by defendants for failure to make required payments within the \n30-day period when payment is made within 45 days of the submission of an uncontested \nMedicaid or non-Medicaid voucher. Finally, the Court adopts the Special Master's \nrecommendation that the Remedial Plan be amended to require the Special Master to \nsubmit a report including suggestions for the disposition of the fines paid by defendants and \nfor steps to bring this extraordinarily protracted litigation to an end, both with the goal of \nprotecting the plaintiff class' habilitation needs. \nI. Sanctions \nA. The Imposition of Sanctions \nIt is indisputable that defendants were held in contempt by the Court's Orders of October \n11, 1995, and August 2, 1996, for their failure to comply with the timely payment provisions \nof the 1983 Consent Order. It also is not disputed that the Remedial Plan included \n\nprovisions allowing defendants to purge their adjudicated contempt by paying acceptable \nvouchers within 30 days of their submission, and that the Remedial Plan imposed penalties \nfor noncompliance with the timeliness requirement. Defendants — as indicated by their own \nsworn submissions to this Court and acknowledged in their pleadings — do not dispute that \nthey failed repeatedly to make timely payments of vendors as required by the Remedial \nPlan to purge their contempt. \nNonetheless, defendants assert that they should not be subject to sanctions because they \nwere simply incapable of paying all acceptable vouchers within 30 days of their submission, \nand thus, compliance with the purgation condition requiring timely payment was impossible. \nThey further argue that the proposed sanctions are criminal rather than civil in nature, and, \ntherefore, that they are entitled to criminal procedures prior to the imposition of such \nsanctions. The Court adopts the Special Master's findings and conclusions in Sections II.E, \nII.F, and III of her report and thus rejects defendants' contention that changed \ncircumstances render the imposition of sanctions impermissible or unjust. The Court also \nadopts the Special Master's analysis in Section II.C regarding the nature of the sanctions to \nbe imposed and concludes, as she did, that they are civil rather than criminal in nature and \nthat provision of criminal procedures prior to the imposition of sanctions is thus \nunwarranted. Accordingly, the Court finds that defendants have failed to comply with the \npurgation conditions of the Remedial Plan and that the imposition of sanctions is warranted \nfor defendants' failure to purge the 1995 and 1996 findings of contempt.[6] \n93*93 B. The Nature of the Fines \nPlaintiffs, plaintiff-intervenor, and the Special Master contend that the Remedial Plan \nestablishes automatic fines for noncompliance with its conditions of purgation or its \nindependent requirement that defendants pay vendors within 30 days of the submission of \nan acceptable voucher. The Court rejects the characterization of the fines as being \nautomatic. This Opinion requires defendants to pay sanctions for their failure to comply with \nthe Remedial Plan's purgation and payment requirements, thereby ending, as of the date of \nthis Opinion, the period of contempt established by the Court's Order of October 11, 1995, \nas updated by its August 2, 1996, Order. The imposition of fines after the date of this \nOpinion therefore would require a future finding of contempt.[7] A new finding of contempt \nrequires notice and a hearing. The automatic imposition of sanctions upon the required \nsubmission of statements by defendants indicating any noncompliance with the timeliness \nprovisions of the 1996 Order would present both due process concerns and administrative \ndifficulties. \nFirst, the Court believes that making the fines automatic presents a due process problem. \nBy characterizing the fines as automatic, plaintiffs essentially seek summary imposition of \nfines for an indirect contempt.[8] The requirement of due process prohibits summary \nadjudication of indirect contempts. United Mine Workers v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821, 833, 114 \nS.Ct. 2552, 129 L.Ed.2d 642 (1994). Instead, the party charged with indirect civil contempt \nmust receive notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the imposition of sanctions for \nsuch conduct. Id. at 827, 828, 114 S.Ct. 2552; Newton v. A.C. & S., Inc., 918 F.2d 1121, \n1127 & n. 5 (3d Cir.1990) (explaining that notice and a hearing before the imposition of \ncontempt sanctions is important so that the \"parties have an opportunity to explain the \nconduct deemed deficient ... and that a record will be available to facilitate appellate \n\nreview.\"). Furthermore, during such civil proceedings, the party moving for contempt bears \nthe burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that (1) a court order was in effect, \n(2) the order required certain conduct by the respondent, (3) and the respondent failed to \ncomply with the court's order. SEC v. Bankers Alliance Corp., 881 F.Supp. 673, 678 \n(D.D.C.1995). The party facing contempt sanctions must be allowed the opportunity to raise \nany applicable defenses. See Bagwell, 512 U.S. at 827, 114 S.Ct. 2552; Bankers Alliance \nCorp., 881 F.Supp. at 678 (noting the potential availability of an impossibility defense to a \nparty opposing the imposition of sanctions). \nIn light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the automatic imposition of fines would \nviolate the prohibition against summary adjudication of an indirect contempt by depriving \ndefendants of an opportunity to be heard and by eliminating the moving party's burden of \ndemonstrating the propriety of the imposition of sanctions. \nEven if no due process concerns existed, the Court would not treat the fines as automatic \nbecause of the practical difficulties which would ensue. Imposing automatic fines would shift \nthe burden of several monitoring responsibilities from the plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor to \nthe Court, i.e., defendants' compliance with the Remedial Plan, defendants' submission of \n\"automatic fines\" to the Clerk's Office, and the correctness of their calculations regarding \nthe amount of fines. If the fines were treated as automatic, the Court would be required to \nreview all of defendants' submissions from March of 1997 94*94 through the present to \ndetermine the amount of sanctions due for their violations of the Remedial Plan's timeliness \nprovisions without the benefit of briefing by the parties and analysis by the Special Master. \nThe Court would have to undertake such a review also for the violation of other purgation \nconditions (such as those regarding case worker/patient ratios). Furthermore, disputes \nwould likely arise regarding the precise amount of sanctions due even if defendants were to \nsubmit automatic fines for delinquent payments. \nThe Court believes that the Special Master's and parties' legitimate desire for quick \nresolution of motions for sanctions can be balanced with due process concerns by requiring \nthe submission of such motions directly to the Court, which would then refer them to the \nSpecial Master for a report when some exceptional condition requires it.[9] Accordingly, the \nCourt concludes that characterization of the fines as automatic would have little practical \nbenefit and would tend to increase the chances of error in the assessment of fines. The \nCourt therefore limits its imposition of fines at this time to the conduct specifically raised as \nthe basis for the imposition of sanctions in plaintiffs' motion.[10] \nC. Calculation of Sanctions \nPlaintiffs' motion, citing defendants' sworn submissions to the Court, asserts that \ndefendants made delinquent payments to vendors in the months of October, November, \nand December of 1996 and January and February of 1997. The Court adopts the Special \nMaster's calculations in Section II.D for the number of days that defendants were delinquent \nin paying Medicaid vouchers and the amount of the overdue non-Medicaid vouchers for this \nperiod.[11] \nRegarding the Medicaid vouchers, defendants made no overdue payments for the months \nof October and November. However, their payments were overdue by 13 days in \n\nDecember, 5 days in January, and 13 days in February, for a total of 31 days. The \nRemedial Plan provides that a $5,000 per diem fine shall be imposed for each voucher that \nis not paid within the required 30-day period. Accordingly, the Court imposes $155,000 in \ncivil sanctions for defendants' failure to comply with the purgation conditions established by \nthe Remedial Plan with respect to the timely payment of Medicaid vouchers for the period of \nOctober 1996 through February 1997. \nRegarding the non-Medicaid vouchers, defendants made 31 late non-Medicaid payments \ntotaling $632,312 in October, 71 late payments totaling $1,141,896 in November, 35 late \npayments totaling $414,534 in December, 18 late payments totaling $156,678 in January, \nand two late payments in February totaling $125,250. The total of the late payments during \nthese months is $2,470,670. The Remedial Plan provides that, if defendants make late \npayments of non-Medicaid vouchers (i.e., more than 30 days after the submission of an \nacceptable voucher), defendants must pay a fine equaling twice the amount of each \nvoucher. Accordingly, the Court imposes $4,941,340 in civil sanctions on defendants for \ntheir failure to pay non-Medicaid vouchers timely during the period October 1996 through \nFebruary 1997. Therefore, for their delinquent payment of both Medicaid and non-Medicaid \nvouchers, defendants owe a total of $5,096,340 in civil sanctions. Defendants shall submit \nsuch funds to the Clerk of the Court within 90 days of the date of this Opinion. \n95*95 II. Modification of the Remedial Plan \nThe Court adopts the Special Master's findings and conclusions regarding defendants' \nmotion for modification of the Remedial Plan (Section III) and, accordingly, rejects \ndefendants' motion to expand the payment period from 30 days to 45 days. The Court \nadopts in part, and rejects in part, the Special Master's proposed modifications of the \nRemedial Plan. \nA. Modification To Forgive Fines for Failure to Pay \nVendors Within 30 Days When Defendants Make \nPayment Within 45 Days \nThe Court adopts the Special Master's recommendation, with slight modification of her \nproposed language, that the Remedial Plan be modified to permit defendants to purge any \nfuture contempt for not paying vendors within 30 days by making payment within 45 days of \nsubmission of the vendors' vouchers.[12] See Section IV of the Special Master's \nRecommended Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. This modification differs from \ndefendants' motion to modify the 30-day payment period for vendors to allow a 45-day \npayment period. Under the Court's modification, defendants still are required to make \npayment within 30 days, but if defendants make payment between the 31st day and the \n45th day, defendants will have purged the per diem fines incurred since the 31st day and \nneed not pay any fines. If, however, defendants do not make payment after the 45th day, \nthe defendants will have missed their opportunity to purge their contempt, and the per diem \nfines will be assessed from the 31st day forward. \n\nCurrently, the provisions of Section I.D of the Remedial Plan articulating sanctions for \nuntimely payments state: \nAccordingly, it hereby is \nORDERED, that should defendants fail to purge their contempt by paying acceptable \nprovider invoices within 30 days of submission, as required by this Remedial Plan, at the \nend of the first month in which defendants report that there are outstanding Medicaid \npayments due but not paid within 30 days of submission of an acceptable invoice, \ndefendants shall be assessed a coercive civil fine of $5,000 a day, until the overdue \npayments are made. \n* * * * * * \nIt hereby further is \nORDERED, that with respect to non-Medicaid payments found to be overdue, defendants \nshall be assessed a coercive civil fine of twice the amount overdue.... \nThese provisions shall be amended to read:[13] \nAccordingly, it hereby is \nORDERED, that should defendants fail to pay acceptable Medicaid invoices within 30 days \nof their submission, as required by this Remedial Plan, defendants shall be assessed a \ncoercive fine of $10,000 a day for each day, beginning from the 31st day, that each overdue \ninvoice remains unpaid, except that no fines shall be assessed if payment of such \nacceptable Medicaid invoices is made on or before the 45th day after the submission of \nsuch invoices. \n* * * * * * \nIt hereby further is \nORDERED, that should defendants fail to pay acceptable non-Medicaid invoices within 30 \ndays of their submission, as required by this Remedial Plan, defendants shall be assessed \na coercive fine of $1,000 a day for each day that each overdue invoice remains unpaid, \nexcept that no fines shall be assessed if payment of such acceptable non-Medicaid invoices \nis made on or before the 45th day after the submission of such invoices. \n96*96 B. Modification of the Amount of the Medicaid \nPer Diem Fines and the Structure of the non-Medicaid \nFines \nThe Court adopts the Special Master's proposal that the fine provisions of the Remedial \nPlan be modified to increase the per diem fine for untimely Medicaid payments to $10,000 \nand to replace the existing sanction for non-Medicaid payments (doubling the amount of \n\noverdue payments) with a per diem fine of $1,000 for each overdue invoice that remains \nunpaid. The purpose of altering these payments is to make the fines assessed for untimely \nvendor payments more comparable and efficient.[14] The text of the sanctions provisions as \namended appears in the preceding section. \nC. Modification of Reporting Requirements \nThe Court also adopts, as modified, the Special Master's recommendation that defendants' \nreporting requirements be amended to reflect the preceding modification in the structure of \nsanctions for untimely payments. Currently, Section I.C of the Remedial Plan requires \ndefendants to submit a sworn statement to the Court each month which includes the \nfollowing information: \n1. A list of care providers for the class who have not been paid full Medicaid reimbursement \nwithin 30 calendar days after the submission of their invoices to First Health or another \nMedicaid processing contractor. The list shall indicate for each unpaid care provider the \namount of overdue payment and the number of days by which the payment is overdue. \n2. A list of all other class care providers to whom payment has not been made within 30 \ncalendar days of their submission of acceptable invoices to MRDDA, or any other agency of \nthe District of Columbia, for services provided to plaintiffs ordered by the Court's several \nConsent Orders. As with requirement [1] above, the list shall contain for each care provider \nthe amount of overdue payment and the number of days by which the payment is overdue. \n(A provider invoice submitted to MRDDA is \"overdue\" if it has not been paid within 8 \nworking days or 15 calendar days, whichever is longer, after the DHS Controller has \nassigned the invoice a voucher number.) \nThose provisions shall be amended to read as follows: \n1. A list of care providers for the class who have not been paid full Medicaid reimbursement \nwithin 30 calendar days after the submission of their acceptable invoices to First Health or \nanother Medicaid processing contractor. The list shall indicate for each unpaid care provider \nthe amount of overdue payment and the number of days by which the payment is overdue. \nThe number of days for which each payment — excluding vouchers which were paid within \n45 days of submission — is overdue shall be added together by defendants and the \nresulting total shall be included in an easily identifiable section of defendants' submission. \nDefendants shall also include a clear and separate statement of any reduction (due to the \npayment of vouchers within 45 days of their submission since the previous month's \nstatement to the Court) in the total number of days forming the basis for the calculation of \nany fines for the preceding month. \n2. A list of all other class care providers to whom payment has not been made within 97*97 \n30 calendar days of their submission of acceptable invoices to MRDDA, or any other \nagency of the District of Columbia, for services provided to plaintiffs ordered by the Court's \nseveral Consent Orders. As with requirement 1 above, the list shall contain for each care \nprovider the amount of overdue payment and the number of days by which the payment is \noverdue. (A provider invoice submitted to MRDDA is \"overdue\" if it has not been paid within \n8 working days or 15 calendar days, whichever is longer, after the DHS Controller has \n\nassigned the invoice a voucher number.) The number of days for which each payment — \nexcluding vouchers which were paid within 45 days of their submission — is overdue shall \nbe added together by defendants and the resulting total shall be included in an easily \nidentifiable section of defendants' submission. Defendants shall also include a clear \nstatement of any reduction (due to the payment of vouchers within 45 days of their \nsubmission since the previous month's statement to the Court) in the total number of days \nforming the basis for the calculation of any fines for the preceding month. \nD. Report by the Special Master Regarding the \nDisposition of the Fines and Closure \nFinally, the Court adopts, as modified, the Special Master's recommendation that the \nRemedial Plan be amended to require her submission of a report within a year of the date of \nthis Opinion — developed, it is hoped, with the full cooperation of all parties — suggesting \n(1) constructive ways to use the fines owed by defendants and (2) steps toward ending the \nCourt's jurisdiction over this case. Specifically, the Court directs submission of this report by \nNovember 1, 1999. The uses for the fines and the steps to be taken by the parties that \nwould permit the Court to terminate the case should be formulated in a way that would \nprotect the interests of the plaintiff class thereafter. \nAlthough defendants object to use of fines owed by defendants stemming from these civil \nsanctions toward habilitation of the plaintiff class, the Court strongly agrees with the Special \nMaster that such a use is not only permissible, but would be in the interest of all the parties, \nincluding defendants. Formulating a plan by means of which plaintiffs' adequate habilitation \ncould be permanently assured would facilitate achieving the end of a case which has been \nbefore the Court for over twenty years and has considerably expended the resources and \nenergy of all involved. \nFurthermore, the Court finds meritless defendants' contention that requiring the Special \nMaster to submit a report on the disposition of the fines would constitute an impermissible \nexpansion of her authority to supervise remediation. The issuance of such a report easily \nfalls within the \"well-established tradition of allowing use of special masters to oversee \ncompliance\" with court orders. See United States v. Microsoft Corp., 147 F.3d 935, 954 \n(D.C.Cir.1998). Such a report would merely suggest ways in which the coercive fines could \nbe used to implement the goals of the multiple Consent Orders in this case without the \ncontinuous, direct supervision of the Court or Special Master. \nAccordingly, Section IV of the Remedial Plan is amended to include the following language: \n[i]t hereby is \nORDERED, that the Special Master, in cooperation and conjunction with the parties, if \npossible, shall develop a plan for the disposition of the fines paid by defendants which shall \ninclude suggestions for post-litigation mechanisms to ensure the protection of the plaintiff \nclass' continuing interest in adequate habilitation following the conclusion of this lawsuit. It \nhereby further is \n\nORDERED, that the Special Master, in cooperation and conjunction with the parties, if \npossible, shall develop and recommend to the Court a plan for the conclusion of the above-\ncaptioned action, which shall include recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law \nregarding the following topics: \na. Goals. A summary and articulation of the goals of this lawsuit as reflected in 98*98 the \n1978 and 1983 Consent Orders, the 1996 Remedial Plan, and all other Court-ordered \nobligations (hereafter collectively \"Court-ordered requirements\"). \nb. Current compliance. An evaluation of existing programs to determine the extent of \ndefendants' compliance with requirements for the protection of the health and safety of the \nplaintiff class and their effectiveness in meeting the goals described in subparagraph a, \nincluding but not limited to the provision of necessary medical and other health services and \nthe compliance of private vendors with District of Columbia licensing and payment \nrequirements governing community residence facilities, intermediate care facilities, foster \ncare, day treatment programs, day programs, employment programs, representative \npayment and guardianship. \nc. Adequate habilitation. The extent of defendants' compliance with Court-ordered \nrequirements for the provision of adequate habilitation in the least restrictive setting and \ntheir effectiveness (strengths and weaknesses) in meeting the goals described in \nsubparagraph a, including individual habilitation planning, individual financial planning, case \nmanagement, appropriate residential services, adequate habilitation services, and the \nsafeguarding of client funds. \nd. Payment of providers. The extent of defendants' compliance with Court-ordered \nrequirements for the timely payment of private providers who provide the plaintiff class with \nappropriate residential services, day treatment programs, vocational and supported \nemployment services, day programs, medical, mental health, dental, and other services \nrequired by the Court. \ne. Quality assurance. The quality assurance methods to be developed and implemented by \ndefendants to monitor continually the performance of public and private providers of service \nin meeting the goals of the suit. \nf. Standards and compliance measurement. The standards, including outcome standards to \nbe developed and implemented by defendants, that should be used to determine \ndefendants' continued compliance with Court-ordered requirements, and the way in which \ncompliance with such standards should be measured. \ng. Substantial compliance standards. The degree of compliance that should be required \nwith each of the standards recommended. \nh. Permanent monitoring. The steps necessary to establish permanent, objective, efficient, \nand effective post-termination monitoring of the programs serving class members by \nindependent entities (for example, private accreditation services and independent \nmonitoring bodies). \ni. Individual and community advocacy. The steps necessary to coordinate existing \nmechanisms and to develop needed mechanisms for the advocacy of the interests of class \nmembers, on a individual and community-wide basis, in compliance with Court-ordered \n\nrequirements, including but not limited to the use of court-appointed attorneys, \nguardianships, and medical decisionmaking procedures for class members. \nThe Court strongly believes that development of such a plan to utilize the fines and to \nconclude the Court's jurisdiction over this case would serve the interests of all parties \ninvolved. \nConclusion \nIn sum, the Court imposes civil sanctions on defendants for their failure to comply with the \nRemedial Plan's conditions of purgation, denies defendants' motion for modification and \ndemand for a criminal jury trial, and amends certain provisions of the Remedial Plan. \n[1] This opinion, as would be expected, has been in preparation for some time, and the Court wishes to avoid any \nfurther delay in issuing it. Accordingly, it is issued without regard to the motion that plaintiffs filed on February 2, 1999. \nThe release of this Opinion undoubtedly affects the relief sought by the new motion, and the other parties need not \nrespond to that motion with reference to its date of filing. To establish a schedule for pleadings directed to that \nmotion, plaintiffs are directed within 14 days of the date of this Opinion to file a pleading expressing how the new \nmotion is affected by this Opinion and clarifying their current position, following which the other parties may submit \nresponsive pleadings in accordance with the normal scheduling rules.  \nIn connection with the passage of time, although the undersigned never before has made any reference to personal \nfactors in an opinion, he feels constrained to note that two unanticipated hospitalizations, with coronary artery surgical \nprocedures, contributed (along with many other judicial responsibilities) to delaying the completion of this task. \n[2] The United States, as plaintiff-intervenor, filed a memorandum in support of plaintiffs' motion for sanctions on April \n21, 1997. \n[3] The Special Master calculated this amount based on defendants' violations for the period between September \n1996 (after the Court's finding of contempt on August 2, 1996) and September 1997. As explained later in this \nOpinion in footnote 11, the Court calculates its fines based on defendants' violations for a shorter period between the \nCourt's finding of contempt on August 2, 1996, and the filing of plaintiffs' motion for sanctions on April 2, 1997. \n[4] On March 6, 1998, the United States and plaintiffs filed oppositions to defendants' jury demand. On March 23, \n1998, defendants filed a reply to the United States' and plaintiffs' oppositions to their jury demand and a supplemental \nmemorandum in support of their objections to the Special Master's Recommended Findings of Facts and Conclusions \nof Law. \n[5] The Court notes that defendants briefly allude in their objection to the Special Master's report to their \"right\" to an \nevidentiary hearing prior to the imposition of sanctions. It is uncontested that defendants have never requested a \nformal hearing before the Special Master regarding the pending matters. The Referral Order states in part that \"[a]t a \nhearing before the Court, the parties shall be precluded from submitting evidence to the Court that could reasonably \nhave been submitted to the Special Master.\" See Oct. 10, 1996, Order of Reference, Para. 18. At the July 22, 1998, \nhearing on the legal issues raised by the pending motions, defendants failed to point to any evidence which they \nwould introduce — were this Court to hold an evidentiary hearing — which they could not reasonably have presented \nto the Special Master. Their pleadings also fail to make any such showing. In sum, defendants have failed to \nestablish or even hint at the existence of any evidence which would be admissible at an evidentiary hearing were one \nto be held. Accordingly, the Court denies defendants' request for an additional opportunity to submit evidence which \nalready has or should have been submitted. The Court notes, however, that it has carefully considered in its decision \nof the pending motions the evidence properly submitted by defendants in support of their pleadings. \n[6] The Special Master characterizes half of the sanctions as being due for failure to purge the contempts adjudicated \nby the October 11, 1995, Order and the August 2, 1996, Order, and the other half as \"new\" or \"continuing\" contempts \n(of the Remedial Plan's independent timeliness requirement) for which fines are due automatically. Because the \nCourt does not agree with the Special Master's conclusion that the fines provided for by the Remedial Plan are \n\nautomatic, it currently imposes fines only for defendants' failure to purge the contempts adjudicated by this Court's \n1995 and 1996 Orders and only for the period prior to the filing of the plaintiffs' motion for sanctions.  \nAs noted by the Special Master, the language of the Remedial Plan's sanctions provisions regarding timely payment \nmandates the imposition of specified fines for failure to comply with those purgation conditions. Defendants provide \nthe Court with no persuasive justification for disregarding this mandatory language and permitting them additional \nopportunities to purge their contempt. The Court concludes that such laxity — after the Court's clear admonition to \ndefendants in its 1996 Order that future noncompliance with the timeliness requirements would result in severe \nconsequences — would effectively negate the coercive effect of such fines. Accordingly, the Court concludes that \ndefendants have failed to comply with the purgation conditions of the Remedial Plan, and that the fines set forth in \nthat Plan are due without the necessity for further proceedings. \n[7] Plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor are free to move for new findings of contempt for any contemptuous conduct \noccurring after the date of this Opinion. Under the Remedial Plan, as amended by Section II.A of this Opinion, \ndiscussed infra, each instance in which defendants are delinquent in paying provider vouchers within 30 days will be \nconsidered a separate contempt, and each failure to pay the vouchers within 15 days thereafter will be considered a \nfailure to purge the contempt. \n[8] An indirect contempt is conduct that occurs outside the presence of the court. The classic example of an indirect \ncontempt is the failure of a party to obey a court order, such as the conduct at issue in this case. \n[9] See Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53(b) regarding referrals to masters. In fact, this procedure was followed with \nrespect to the current motions. \n[10] The Court notes that plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor are free to move for sanctions for the period of March 1997 \nto the date of this Opinion under the original terms of the Remedial Plan. Any contemptuous conduct occurring after \nthe issuance of this Opinion will be subject to the terms of the Remedial Plan, as modified by this Opinion. \n[11] As explained in footnote 3, the Court's calculation of fines differs from the Special Master's calculation because it \nbases the fines on a shorter period of contemptuous conduct beginning from the August 2, 1996, finding of contempt \nand tolled by plaintiffs' motion for sanctions filed on April 2, 1997. The actual calculation is based on plaintiffs' \ndocumentation of delinquent payments from October 1996 to February 1997, which plaintiffs submitted with their \nmotion for sanctions. \n[12] Defendants make the wholly unpersuasive assertion that such a modification would constitute an attempt by the \nCourt to amend the Quick Payment Act in violation of the principle of separation of powers. The Court notes that the \nSpecial Master clearly (and correctly) stated that the Quick Payment Act does not apply to this case and that she \nconsidered it only for guidance in crafting the present modification. \n[13] As noted in the following section, the Court also adopts the Special Master's recommendations that the Medicaid \nper diem fine be increased and that the non-Medicaid fine be changed to a per diem fine. \n[14] The Special Master explained in her Recommended Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law why the current \nsystem of fines creates an illogical result. \"In the case of Medicaid invoices, the fines are based on the number of \ndays of delinquency. In the case of non-Medicaid invoices, the fines are twice the amount of overdue payments \nreported in defendants' monthly statements to the Court.... As a result, defendants' failure to pay large amounts due \non Medicaid invoices incurs modest fines of $5,000 per delinquent day regardless of the magnitude of the overdue \npayments. For example, $2 million in Medicaid payments ten days overdue would incur a fine of $50,000. On the \nother hand, failure to pay several non-Medicaid invoices can result in relatively large fines based on the amounts \noverdue and not on the number of days such payments are overdue. For example, three unpaid non-Medicaid \ninvoices totaling $240,000 incur fines of $480,000 if they are one day overdue or ten days overdue, and defendants \nare still obligated to pay the vendors $240,000.\" (Recommended Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, at 25.) \n ",
