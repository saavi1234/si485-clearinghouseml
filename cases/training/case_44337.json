    "summary": "<p>On September 6, 2022, three high school students filed a complaint in the District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, naming the Oklahoma Department of Education, the individual members of the Oklahoma Board of Education, the Oklahoma Attorney General, and Oklahoma School Districts nos. 40, 2, and 89, as well as the Harding Independent Charter District. The complaint concerns SB 615, an Oklahoma state law that mandates that all public and charter schools designate public restrooms for exclusive use by either the male or female sex, as identified in an individual's birth certificate. Refusal by a school to enforce SB 615 carries with it a punishment of denial of 5% of state school funding to the school in question. The plaintiffs, all of whom are transgender, allege that SB 615 is an undue burden on their civil rights, and are thus suing the defendants based on two causes of action: first, denial of equal protection under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 for denial of their rights based on sex and their transgender status; second, a violation of Title IX under 20 U.S.C. &sect; 1681. The plaintiffs are seeking declaratory judgments under both causes of action, a preliminary injunction preventing enforcement of SB 615 and relief allowing plaintiffs use of bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity, symbolic damages to be paid to the defendants, and attorneys' fees. The plaintiffs are represented by Lambda Legal, the ACLU, and private counsel. On September 29, 2022, plaintiffs entered a motion for a preliminary injunction along these lines. Judge Jodi D. Wishman was assigned to the case.</p>\r\n<p>Defendants entered a motion to dismiss the suit on October 26, 2022. The defendants' motion argued that plaintiffs' equal protection claim cannot survive since SB 615 (1) treats similarly situated individuals the same and as such discriminatory treatment necessary for an equal protection claim does not exist, and (2) the law withstands intermediate scrutiny due to pursuing an important government interest, protecting students' intimacy in a private space. Defendants also argud that the Title IX claim could not survive, due to the fact that Title IX allows separation of students on the basis of sex. Defendants did not accept plaintiffs' argument that 'sex' in this case refers to subjective gender identity only.</p>\r\n<p>While the court's judgment on the motion to dismiss was pending, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit issued an en banc judgment in a similar case, <a href=\"../../../../case/43948/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Adams v. The School Board of St. John's County, Florida</a>. In its en banc opinion, the Eleventh Circuit held that a school bathroom policy which separates students on the basis of biological sex does not violate Title IX or the equal protection clause. On January 5, 2023, Judge Wishman issued an order allowing both parties to file supplemental briefs to address this ruling.</p>\r\n<p>Defendants' motion to dismiss and plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction are still pending before the district court. The case is ongoing as of December 13, 2023.</p>",

Real physiological differences between men \nand women exist, and they are enduring and immutable. These differences give rise to privacy \ninterests in places where persons routinely disrobe, either partially or completely, such as \nrestrooms and changing areas. Accordingly, our laws and courts have long permitted, with \nlittle fanfare, separating those places of heightened privacy into male and female spaces.  \nUntil very recently, it was also undisputed that the word “sex” (and even “gender”) \nmeant biological sex. Plaintiffs’ legal theories seek to turn this well-established precedent and \nhistory upside-down and supplant, entirely, objective sex with subjective gender identity. \nPlaintiffs apparently regard the real physiological differences between males and females as \ngender stereotypes, and they claim that laws (like Oklahoma’s) that designate intimate spaces \nbased  on  those  real  physiological  differences  between  males  and  females  are  invidious \ndiscrimination in violation of the U.S. Constitution. Although Plaintiffs couch their claims as \nprotecting transgender individuals, they really seek to prohibit Oklahoma from recognizing \nbiological sex altogether. The Constitution in no way requires this radical policy preference. \nThe Oklahoma law Plaintiffs challenge, Senate Bill 615, simply and permissibly requires \nstudents to use the multiple occupancy restroom or changing area corresponding with their \nsex, as determined by objective physiological factors and as identified on the individual’s \noriginal birth certificate. See OKLA. STAT. tit. 70, § 1-125. The statute also provides an \naccommodation: Students may opt-out and use a single-occupancy restroom or changing \nroom, which must be provided. While S.B. 615 does separate based on biological sex, it does \nso in a way long recognized as permissible, and it otherwise treats all students the exact same \n1 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 10 of 34\nregardless of transgender status or gender identity. All students may either use the restroom \nor changing area corresponding with their biological sex or may use a single-occupancy \nrestroom accommodation. \nBecause S.B. 615 treats all similarly situated individuals the same, Plaintiffs cannot \nestablish intentional discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. And even if \nthey could, the law withstands intermediate scrutiny because its separation of the two sexes \nsubstantially relates to well-recognized, important government interests: protecting privacy \nand safety in intimate spaces. Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claims fail as a matter of law. \nPlaintiffs’ Title IX claim likewise cannot succeed as a matter of law. Title IX expressly \nallows schools to separate living spaces, restrooms, and similar facilities on the basis of sex. \nAnd Plaintiffs’ argument that “sex” refers only to subjective gender identity is squarely \nforeclosed by Title IX’s text, statutory context, legislative history, and original meaning.  \nPlaintiffs’ far-sweeping legal claims and theories have no basis in law or precedent. \nAccordingly, no set of facts could establish a plausible claim for relief, and dismissal under \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) is proper. \nBACKGROUND \nOn May 25, 2022, Senate Bill 615 was signed into law and codified as OKLA. STAT. tit. \n70, § 1-125 (“S.B. 615”), after passing in the Oklahoma House and Senate with overwhelming \nsupport. See S.B. 615, 2022 O.S.L. 323.1 “To ensure privacy and safety” in areas “where \nindividuals may be in various stages of undress in the presence of other individuals[,]” S.B. \n615 requires every public school and charter school serving students in pre-kindergarten \n \n1 Available at http://www.oklegislature.gov/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=SB615&Session=2200. \n2 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 11 of 34\nthrough twelfth grades to designate “every multiple occupancy restroom or changing area” \n“[f]or the exclusive use of the male sex; or . . . [f]or the exclusive use of the female sex.” OKLA. \nSTAT. tit. 70, § 1-125(B). S.B. 615 defines “sex” as “the physical condition of being male or \nfemale based on genetics and physiology, as identified on the individual’s original birth \ncertificate  .  .  .  .”  Id.  at  1-125(A).  Schools  are  also  required  to  “provide  a  reasonable \naccommodation  to  any  individual  who  does  not  wish  to  comply  with  the”  law,  the \naccommodation being defined as “access to a single-occupancy restroom or changing room.” \nId. at 1-125(C). \nARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES  \nI.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint “must contain sufficient factual matter, \naccepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)); see also Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). While the Court must view a complaint in a light most favorable to the \nnonmoving  party,  courts  need  not  accept  as  true  “labels  and  conclusions,”  legal \ncharacterizations, unwarranted deductions of fact, or “naked assertions devoid of further \nfactual enhancement.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678-679 (citation omitted).  \nWhen a complaint presents a question of law and “it is clear that no relief could be \ngranted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations,” the \ncomplaint “must be dismissed, without regard to whether it is based on an outlandish legal \ntheory or on a close but ultimately unavailing one.” Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 327 \n(1989) (citation omitted). Rule 12(b)(6) “authorizes a court to dismiss a claim on the basis of \n3 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 12 of 34\na dispositive issue of law . . . .” Id. at 326; see also Wyoming v. United States, 279 F.3d 1214, 1222 \n(10th Cir. 2002). \nII.  PLAINTIFFS CANNOT STATE A PLAUSIBLE CAUSE OF ACTION FOR VIOLATION OF \nTHE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT. \nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment generally directs that “all \npersons similarly situated should be treated alike[,]” but it “doesn’t guarantee equal results for \nall, or suggest that the law may never draw distinctions between persons in meaningfully \ndissimilar situations.” City of Cleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985); \nSECSYS, LLC v. Vigil, 666 F.3d 678, 684 (10th Cir. 2012). “The Equal Protection Clause does \nnot forbid classifications,” nor does it create substantive rights. Taylor v. Roswell Indep. Sch. Dist., \n713 F.3d 25, 54 (10th Cir. 2013) (citation omitted); see also Teigen v. Renfrow, 511 F.3d 1072, \n1083  (10th  Cir.  2007).  Instead,  it  “keeps  governmental  decision  makers  from  treating \ndifferently persons who are in all relevant respects alike.” Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 10 \n(1992).  \nTo state a plausible claim under the Equal Protection Clause, a plaintiff must first \nestablish “the challenged state action intentionally discriminates between groups of persons.” \nSECSYS, 666 F.3d at 685; see also Barney v. Pulsipher, 143 F.3d 1299, 1312 (10th Cir. 1998) (a \nplaintiff “must first make a threshold showing that [she was] treated differently from others \nwho were similarly situated to [her]”). Once a plaintiff overcomes this threshold burden, he or \nshe must establish the state’s intentional discrimination is not “justified by reference to some \nupright government purpose.” SECSYS, 666 F.3d at 686. Here, courts presume the relevant \nlegislation is “valid and will be sustained if the classification drawn by the statute is rationally \nrelated to a legitimate state interest.” City of Cleburne, Tex., 473 U.S. at 440. Only when a plaintiff \n4 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 13 of 34\nestablishes the intentional discrimination targets a fundamental right or a suspect classification \ndoes a heightened standard of review apply. Id.; see also Tonkovich v. Kan. Bd. of Regents, 159 F.3d \n504, 532 (10th Cir. 1998). \nA.  Plaintiffs cannot establish that S.B. 615 intentionally discriminates based on \ntransgender status. \nA  plaintiff  bringing  an  Equal  Protection  Clause  claim  bears  the  burden  of  first \nestablishing the challenged law intentionally discriminates between similarly situated groups of \nindividuals. See SECSYS, 666 F.3d at 685. “[W]hen the law under review is generally applicable \nto all persons, no presumption of intentional discrimination arises; proof is required.” Id. After \nall,  “many  laws,  perhaps  most  and  often  unavoidably,  affect  some  groups  of  persons \ndifferently than others . . . .” Id. \nHere, S.B. 615 separates multiple occupancy restroom facilities based on biological sex \nbut  does  not  otherwise  account  for  or  distinguish  students  based  on  gender  identity, \ntransgender status, or any other characteristic of any kind. To respect the safety and privacy \nof all students in areas where they may be partially undressed, S.B. 615 simply requires all \nstudents to use the restroom or changing facilities that correspond with their biological sex. \nAlthough S.B. 615 does separate restroom facilities by biological sex, it treats every similarly \nsituated individual the same. It requires all biological males to use the boy’s restroom (or a \nsingle-occupancy accommodation restroom). Conversely, all biological boys are excluded \nfrom using the girl’s restroom, and thus all male classmates are treated the exact same \nregardless of their gender identity. The law likewise requires all biological females to use the \ngirl’s restroom (or a single-occupancy accommodation restroom). All biological girls are \nexcluded from using the men’s restroom, and thus all female classmates are treated the exact \n5 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 14 of 34\nsame regardless of their gender identity. This separation based on biological sex requires no \nknowledge or awareness of gender identity, and as a result, necessarily does not discriminate \nbased on transgender status or gender identity. \nPlaintiffs cannot escape the fact that transgender status or gender identity are not at \nissue  by  conflating  subjective  gender  identity  with  sex—treating  the  two  as  entirely \ninterchangeable. Such an argument is foreclosed by U.S. Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit \nauthorities indicating that transgender status cannot exist separate and apart from biological \nsex. See Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., Georgia, 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1743 (2020) (“For an employer to \ndiscriminate against employees for being homosexual or transgender, the employer must \nintentionally discriminate against individual men and women in part because of sex.”); see also \nTudor v. Se. Oklahoma State Univ., 13 F.4th 1019, 1028 (10th Cir. 2021) (“In the wake of Bostock, \nit is now clear that transgender discrimination, like that complained of by Dr. Tudor, is \ndiscrimination ‘because of sex’ prohibited under Title VII.”). \nPut  differently,  Bostock  taught  that  these  adverse  employment  actions  against \ntransgender individuals in the Title VII context are cognizable because they are based on \nstereotypes about biological sex, which is sex-based discrimination. This holding is logically \nimpossible if biological sex does not exist apart from gender identity. Indeed, the Bostock opinion \nwas built on the foundational fact that “sex” at a baseline refers “to biological distinctions \nbetween  male  and  female.”  Bostock,  140  S.  Ct.  at  1739.  Only  by  recognizing  that \n“homosexuality and transgender status are distinct concepts from sex[,]” could the Court \nfind that the adverse employment action at issue there was discrimination because of sex in the \nTitle VII context. Id. at 1746 (emphasis added). \n6 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 15 of 34\nTo give an example, discrimination against a transgender female for wearing a dress at \nwork is only sex discrimination because the transgender female is a biological male, and the \nstereotype at issue is (presumably) that a male cannot wear a dress to work. There is no sex \nstereotype State Defendants are aware of that says a female cannot wear a dress to work, and \nthe entire theory of stereotypes in Bostock relies on the view that biological sex is immutable \nregardless of gender identity. See, e.g., id. at 1749 (“Employer hires based on sexual stereotypes? \nSimple test. Employer sets pension contributions based on sex? Simple test. Employer fires \nmen who do not behave in a sufficiently masculine way around the office? Simple test.”). If \nbiological sex doesn’t exist, then nothing is simple in this area. \nThat is almost certainly why Bostock stressed it did “not purport to address bathrooms, \nlocker rooms, or anything else of the kind.” Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1753. Not only are there \nmany textual differences between Title VII and laws like Title IX, see infra Section III, but \nadverse employment actions are vastly different from laws permissibly taking into account real \nphysiological differences between the two sexes. Laws separating bathrooms, locker rooms, \nand similar facilities based on biological sex serve a compelling interest of protecting privacy \ninterests in places where individuals may partially or completely undress. See infra Section II(B); \ncf. Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 10 (1992) (“The Equal Protection Clause does not forbid \nclassifications. It simply keeps governmental decisionmakers from treating differently persons \nwho are in all relevant respects alike.”). Such privacy interests were not implicated in Bostock. \nPlaintiffs simply assume that sex equates to gender identity or transgender status \nwithout engaging with this fundamental distinction found in binding case law. Put another \nway, Plaintiffs’ claims hinge on setting aside a key presupposition of Bostock by denying the \n7 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 16 of 34\nexistence  of  objective  biological  sex.  That  is  why  their  complaint  spends  so  little  time \ndiscussing the actual distinction being made here (male/female sex) and instead focuses on \nimpacts to Plaintiffs where no classification or discrimination occurs (transgender status). See, \ne.g., Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 131-133. Their claim fails as a matter of law unless this Court sets aside \nprecedent and conflates objective biological sex with subjective gender identity. Contra United \nStates v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); Michael M. v. Superior Ct. of Sonoma Cnty., 450 U.S. \n464, 469 (1981) (recognizing immutable physiological differences between the two sexes). \nAs many authorities have found, conflating sex with subjective gender identity would \nwreak havoc in the context of laws separating the two sexes based on real and significant \nphysical  differences.  In  the  context  of  sex-based  classifications  in  athletic  activities,  for \nexample, the Sixth Circuit highlighted: \nit must be apparent that its basis is the distinct differences in physical \ncharacteristics and capabilities between the sexes . . . . It takes little \nimagination to realize that were play and competition not separated by \nsex, the great bulk of the females would quickly be eliminated from \nparticipation  and  denied  any  meaningful  opportunity  for  athletic \ninvolvement. \nCape v. Tennessee Secondary Sch. Athletic Ass’n, 563 F.2d 793, 795 (6th Cir. 1977), abrogated in part \non different grounds in Brentwood Acad. v. Tennessee Secondary Sch. Athletic Ass’n, 190 F.3d 705, 706 \n(6th Cir. 1999). Other courts have likewise noted the distinction between discrimination based \non sex and gender identity. See, e.g., Ulane v. E. Airlines, Inc., 742 F.2d 1081, 1085 (7th Cir. 1984) \n(“[A] prohibition against discrimination based on an individual’s sex is not synonymous with \na  prohibition  against discrimination  based  on  an  individual’s  sexual  identity  disorder  or \ndiscontent with the sex into which they were born.”). \n8 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 17 of 34\nTo the extent this separation based on biological sex, with equal treatment regardless \nof gender identity, disproportionately affects certain individuals, that alone is insufficient to \nestablish intentional or purposeful discrimination. See SECSYS, LLC v. Vigil, 666 F.3d 678, \n685 (10th Cir. 2012). Id.2 Consequently, Plaintiffs have not and cannot demonstrate S.B. 615 \nintentionally discriminates or treats similarly situated individuals differently. On this basis \nalone, Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claims should be dismissed.  \nB.  S.B. 615 is substantially related to an important government interest.  \nThe mere fact S.B. 615 separates multiple occupancy restroom facilities based on \nbiological sex does not establish the law intentionally or invidiously discriminates in violation \nof the Equal Protection Clause. After all, not all classifications based on sex are constitutionally \nimpermissible. See, e.g., Caskey Baking Co. v. Virginia, 313 U.S. 117, 121 (1941) (“Classification \nis not discrimination.”); United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996) (“Sex classifications \nmay be used to compensate women for particular economic disabilities [they have] suffered, \nto promot[e] equal employment opportunity, to advance full development of the talent and \ncapacities of our Nation’s people.” (citations omitted)); F.S. Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 \nU.S. 412, 415 (1920) (“[T]he ‘equal protection of the laws’  required by the Fourteenth \nAmendment does not prevent the states from resorting to classification for the purposes of \nlegislation. Numerous and familiar decisions of this court establish that they have a wide range \nof discretion in that regard.”).  \n \n2 Nor can this Court infer improper motive from the fact that S.B. 615 may negatively impact \nsome transgender individuals. See Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 631 (1996) (“[M]ost legislation \nclassifies  for  one  purpose  or  another, with  resulting disadvantage  to  various  groups or \npersons.”). \n9 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 18 of 34\nThe invidious nature of some statutory classifications based on sex does not render sex \nclassifications altogether disposable. The Equal Protection Clause does not aim to eliminate \n“dispositive realities” of sex, only assumptions, stereotypes, and over-broad generalizations \nabout the tendencies or preferences of men or women. Virginia, 518 U.S. at 549-50; see also \nMichael M. v. Superior Ct. of Sonoma Cnty., 450 U.S. 464, 469 (1981) (“Underlying these decisions \nis the principle that a legislature may not ‘make overbroad generalizations based on sex which \nare entirely unrelated to any differences between men and women or which demean the ability \nor social status of the affected class.’” (citation omitted)). Indeed, in Virginia the U.S. Supreme \nCourt emphasized that “‘[i]nherent differences’ between men and women, we have come to \nappreciate, remain cause for celebration . . . .” Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533 (emphasis added). \nThe Supreme Court has long recognized that “sex, like race and national origin, is an \nimmutable  characteristic.”  Frontiero  v.  Richardson,  411  U.S.  677,  686  (1973).  “Physical \ndifferences between men and women . . . are enduring: ‘[t]he two sexes are not fungible; a \ncommunity made up exclusively of one [sex] is different from a community composed of \nboth.’” Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533 (citing Ballard v. United States, 329 U.S. 187, 193 (1946)). As a \nresult, the Supreme Court has explained: “[t]o fail to acknowledge even our most basic \nbiological differences—such as the fact that a mother must be present at birth but the father \nneed not be—risks making the guarantee of equal protection superficial, and so disserving it.” \nTuan Anh Nguyen v. I.N.S., 533 U.S. 53, 73 (2001). In other words, the distinction between men \nand women is a real one, and “the principle of equal protection does not forbid Congress to \naddress” problems in a way specific to each sex. Id. \n10 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 19 of 34\nAccordingly, the Supreme Court has declined to adopt strict scrutiny to evaluate sex \nclassifications and has not hesitated to uphold sex classifications “used to compensate women \n‘for particular economic disabilities [they have] suffered,’ . . . to ‘promot[e] equal employment \nopportunity,’ . . . to advance full development of the talent and capacities of our Nation’s \npeople.” Id. (internal citations omitted); see also Michael M., 450 U.S. at 469 (“[T]his Court has \nconsistently  upheld  statutes  where  the  gender  classification  is  not  invidious,  but  rather \nrealistically reflects the fact that the sexes are not similarly situated in certain circumstances.”).  \nIn other words, sex-based classifications are subject, at most, to intermediate scrutiny. \nUnder this standard, a law or government action must be upheld if it “serve[s] important \ngovernmental objectives and . . . the discriminatory means employed must be substantially \nrelated to the achievement of those objectives.” Wengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co., 446 U.S. 142, \n150 (1980); see also Virginia, 518 U.S. at 531 (“Parties who seek to defend gender-based \ngovernment  action  must  demonstrate  an  ‘exceedingly  persuasive  justification’  for  that \naction.”). Under intermediate scrutiny, unlike strict scrutiny, the state need not prove the law \n“is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest . . . .”Ashaheed v. Currington, 7 F.4th \n1236, 1251 (10th Cir. 2021) (citation omitted). \nHere, S.B. 615 withstands intermediate scrutiny, as requiring  students to use the \nrestroom and locker room associated with their biological sex is substantially related to a \nsufficiently important government interest: protecting the privacy of students to disrobe and \nshower outside of the presence of the opposite sex. This compelling government interest has \nbeen repeatedly upheld and recognized by courts. See, e.g., Carcaño v. McCrory, 203 F. Supp. 3d \n615, 641 (M.D.N.C. 2016) (collecting cases); Johnston v. Univ. of Pittsburgh of Com. Sys. of Higher \n11 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 20 of 34\nEduc., 97 F. Supp. 3d 657, 669-670 (W.D. Pa. 2015); Michael M. v. Superior Ct. of Sonoma Cnty., \n450 U.S. 464, 478 (1981) (Stewart, J., concurring) (“[W]e have recognized that in certain narrow \ncircumstances men and women are not similarly situated; in these circumstances a gender \nclassification based on clear differences between the sexes is not invidious, and a legislative \nclassification realistically based upon those differences is not unconstitutional.”). \nImportantly, the Tenth Circuit has held that requiring “employees use restrooms \nmatching their biological sex does not expose biological males to disadvantageous terms and \ndoes not discriminate against employees who fail to conform to gender stereotypes . . . .” \nEtsitty v. Utah Transit Auth., 502 F.3d 1215, 1225 (10th Cir. 2007). To be sure, the Tenth Circuit  \noverruled much of Etsitty in Tudor v. Se. Oklahoma State Univ., 13 F.4th 1019 (10th Cir. 2021), \nbut it only did so “to the extent that [Etsitty] conflicts with Bostock.” Id. at 1028. And the Bostock \nmajority expressly stated that “we do not purport to address bathrooms, locker rooms, or \nanything else of the kind.” Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1753. Thus, this specific portion of Etsitty is \nstill good law, as it does not conflict with Bostock.  Moreover, as one court succinctly explained \nin a similar case: “separating students by sex based on biological considerations—which \ninvolves the physical differences between men and women—for restroom and locker room \nuse simply does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.” Johnston,97 F. Supp. 3d at 670. \nThese authorities confirm that the physiological differences between the two sexes are \nreal and not rooted in stereotypical assumptions. Cf. Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 \n(1989) (addressing invidious sex stereotyping in the context of Title VII). These biological \ndifferences give rise to legitimate privacy interests justifying the exclusion of the opposite sex \nfrom certain facilities like restrooms. See Etsitty, 502 F.3d at 1224 (“However far Price Waterhouse \n12 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 21 of 34\nreaches, this court cannot conclude it requires employers to allow biological males to use \nwomen’s restrooms. Use of a restroom designated for the opposite sex does not constitute a \nmere failure to conform to sex stereotypes.”). A law acknowledging these interests is likewise \nnot rooted in stereotypical assumptions, nor hypothesized or pretextual justifications. Cf. \nVirginia, 518 U.S. at 533 (requiring that a justification be “genuine, not hypothesized or \ninvented post hoc in response to litigation”). \nThe fact that transgender individuals may be affected by the exclusion of the opposite \nsex in facilities like restrooms, or may not prefer that policy choice, is insufficient to render \nthe choice unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause. In a similar equal protection \nchallenge in the Western District of Pennsylvania, the court explained:  \n[r]egardless of how gender and gender identity are defined, the law \nrecognizes certain distinctions between male and female on the basis of \nbirth sex. Thus, even though Plaintiff is a transgender male, his sex is \nfemale, a fact alleged in Plaintiff's complaint and a fact that has legal \nsignificance in light of Plaintiff's discrimination claim.  \nJohnston v. Univ. of Pittsburgh of Com. Sys. of Higher Educ., 97 F. Supp. 3d 657, 671 (W.D. Pa. 2015).  \nBy continuing the long-standing practice of separating multiple occupancy restrooms \nand similar facilities based on biological sex, S.B. 615 furthers the important state interest of \nprotecting students’ safety and privacy rights. As Plaintiffs recognize, school attendance is \ncompelled by law. See Doc. 1 at ¶ 59. The State is entrusted to provide all students with a safe \nand healthy learning environment in public schools. See Bd. of Educ. of Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 92 of \nPottawatomie  Cnty.  v.  Earls,  536  U.S.  822,  830  (2002)  (describing  “in  a  public  school \nenvironment[,] ... the State is responsible for maintaining discipline, health, and safety.”). This \nincludes a responsibility to its students to ensure their privacy while engaging in personal \n13 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 22 of 34\nbathroom functions, disrobing, dressing, and showering outside of the presence of members \nof the opposite sex. This interest involves not just the State, but also the parents and the \nstudents who share similar interests. And these interests are particularly compelling in a school \nenvironment where children are still developing, physically and emotionally. See, e.g., Safford \nUnified Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. Redding, 557 U.S. 364, 375 (2009) (“[A]dolescent vulnerability \nintensifies the patent intrusiveness of the exposure.”). \nAlthough these interests extend to both sexes, women are likely the predominant \nbeneficiary and would suffer particular harm under Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection theory. As \nJustice Ginsburg informally observed in an incident involving a school official strip-search of \na teenage girl: “Maybe a 13-year-old boy in a locker room doesn’t have that same feeling about \nhis body. But a girl who’s just the age where she is developing, whether she has developed a \nlot ... or ... has not developed at all (might be) embarrassed about that.” Joan Biskupic, Ginsburg: \nCourt Needs Another Woman, USA Today (May 5, 2009).3 As a result, “[s]eparate places to \ndisrobe, sleep, [and] perform personal bodily functions are permitted, in some situations \nrequired, by regard for individual privacy.” Ruth Bader Ginsburg, The Fear of the Equal Rights \nAmendment, Wash. Post at A21 (Apr. 7, 1975). \nIf biological males can have unrestricted access to female-only restrooms, changing \nareas, locker-rooms, dormitories, and showers, based solely on how they identify or claim to \nidentify, female students would suffer mental, emotional, and developmental harm. “[L]eaving \naside the risk of assault, sex-segregated bathrooms give women the peace of mind of knowing \n \n3  Available  at  https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/judicial/2009-05-05-\nruthginsburg_N.htm. \n14 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 23 of 34\nthey can use the bathroom, attend to their menstrual needs and to small children, with a degree \nof privacy and dignity that would otherwise not exist.”  Cambridge Radical Feminist Network, \nThere Is Nothing Progressive About Removing Women-Only Bathrooms, Medium (Jan. 13, 2019). And \nthe loss of that private space will fall most heavily on “those individuals who — due to having \na history of sexual assault, or for religious reasons — do not feel comfortable using a shared \nintimate space with male strangers.”  Id.   \nPlaintiffs  attempt  to  downplay this  interest  by  claiming  that  “[s]tudents  who  are \ntransgender pose no risks to the privacy or safety of others students . . . .” Doc. 1 at ¶ 52. But \nPlaintiffs misunderstand that the mere presence of a member of the opposite sex in a restroom \nor changing area is a violation of privacy, regardless of whether any incident occurs. And \nPlaintiffs’ assurances that they pose no safety risk to others does not moot the legitimate safety \ninterest justifying separate facilities. Moreover, Plaintiffs do not explain in any way how a \nschool is supposed to distinguish between a person identifying in good faith as transgender \nand a person merely claiming a different identity to access otherwise off-limits facilities and \npotentially prey on the vulnerable. There is no apparent way to discern this objectively; rather, \nschools are apparently, under this theory, supposed to take people’s word for it.  That is \nentirely insufficient when it comes to the responsibility schools have to protect the privacy \nand safety of their students.   \nLaws and policies like S.B. 615 have long provided sex-separated restrooms, locker \nrooms, and dormitories as a means to protect all individuals in their most vulnerable moments \nand when partially or completely undressed. What makes facilities like restrooms private also \nmakes them susceptible to abuse by bad actors. The examples of abuse and assault, attempted \n15 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 24 of 34\nor actual, occurring in restrooms and similar facilities are not hypothetical. Take, for example, \nthe 2013 assault of an eight-year-old Oklahoma girl who was locked inside a restroom by “a \nmostly naked man” who “got between her and the door[,] … wrapped a … coat around her \nneck[,] and began choking her.” Update: Homeless Man Suspected of Attacking Child in Gas Station \nBathroom, Oklahoma’s News 4 (Sept. 16, 2013).4 Or last year’s nationally recognized story of a \n“15-year-old [Virginia] boy” who “sexually assault[ed] a female classmate in a school bathroom \n. . . .”  Laura Wainman & Nicole DiAntoniao, Teen boy sexually assaulted classmate in a school \nbathroom, judge says, WUSA 9 (Oct. 26, 2021).5  Neither the State nor Oklahoma women need \nwait for further assaults to materialize before adopting laws and policies that substantially \nrelate to this compelling safety interest.6 \nWhat these incidents have in common is a male perpetrator exploiting a bathroom’s \nprivacy to prey on vulnerable female victims. Plainly, these safety interests are not pretextual; \nand laws that exclude the opposite sex from restrooms and similar facilities are substantially \nrelated to this compelling interest. To be clear: the argument is not that transgender individuals \nare more likely to be bad actors, but that others could exploit the seemingly standardless \nconcept of “gender identity” in order to gain access to vulnerable persons.  \n \n4 Available at https://kfor.com/news/police-okc-homeless-man-attacks-8-year-old-girl-in-\nbathroom/. \n5 Available at https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/legal/teen-found-guilty-loudoun-\ncounty-bathroom-sexual-assault/65-e383c241-afd1-4539-8fa3-4ccb01562ea9. \n6  These  safety  interests  are  again  heightened  by  the  fact  S.B.  615  applies  in  a  school \nenvironment where children are still developing. Studies show that sexual assault remains one \nof the most underreported crimes, particularly in child victims with only 12% of child sexual \nabuse being reported to authorities. See Rochelle F. Hanson, et al., Factors related to the reporting \nof childhood rape, 23 Child Abuse and Neglect 559–569 (1999); see also Callie Marie Rennison, \nPh.D., Rape and Sexual Assault: Reporting to Police and Medical Attention, 1992-2000, U.S. Dep’t of \nJustice (Aug. 2002) available at https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/rsarp00.pdf. \n16 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 25 of 34\nAccordingly, there is not only a rational basis, but a substantially related basis for the \nState  to  require  students  to  use  the  multiple  occupancy  restroom  and  changing  room \nassociated with their biological sex (or a single-occupancy accommodation). \nIII.  PLAINTIFFS CANNOT STATE A PLAUSIBLE CAUSE OF ACTION FOR VIOLATION OF \nTITLE IX. \nTitle  IX  provides  that  no  person  “shall,  on  the  basis  of  sex,  be  excluded  from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \neducation program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \nNotwithstanding this broad pronouncement, Title IX then clarifies that “nothing contained \nherein shall be construed to prohibit any educational institution receiving funds under this \nAct, from maintaining separate living facilities for the different sexes.” Id. § 1686 (emphasis added). As \nthe U.S. Supreme Court summarized: “Title IX is a broadly written general prohibition on \ndiscrimination, followed by specific, narrow exceptions to that broad prohibition.” Jackson v. \nBirmingham Bd. of Educ., 544 U.S. 167, 175 (2005). \nThe narrow exceptions continue in regulations promulgated decades ago that, among \nother things,7 expressly allow schools to provide “separate toilet, locker room, and shower \nfacilities on the basis of sex,” so long as the facilities “provided for students of one sex shall \nbe comparable to such facilities provided for students of the other sex,” 34 C.F.R. § 106.33 \n(May 9, 1980). \n \n7 Title IX regulations also allow covered programs to “operate or sponsor separate teams for \nmembers of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the \nactivity involved is a contact sport,” 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b), and even requires universities to \nconsider sex in allocating athletic scholarships, id. at § 106.37(c). \n17 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 26 of 34\nIn 2021, the federal government attempted to adopt a new interpretation of 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.33 to include concepts such as gender identity. In a challenge brought by the State of \nOklahoma and others, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee enjoined \nthe federal government from implementing its interpretation. See Tennessee v. U.S. Dep’t of Ed., \nE.D. Tenn. Case No. 3:21-cv-308, Doc. 86 (July 15, 2022). The court explained that the federal \ngovernment’s new interpretation improperly “create[d] rights for students and obligations for \nregulated entities not to discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender identity that appear \nnowhere in Bostock, Title IX, or its implementing regulations.” Id. at 41.  \nBy suggesting that this Court can simply read “gender identity” into Title IX and its \nregulations, Plaintiffs seek to have this Court promulgate by fiat a federal regulatory change, \nwithout the federal government present, that another Court has already rejected with both \nOklahoma and the federal government as parties. \nBecause S.B. 615 separates restroom facilities on the basis of biological sex, Plaintiffs’ \nTitle IX claims can only succeed if the term “sex” in Title IX eschews biological sex and \ninstead means only subjective gender identity. Cf. Doc. 1 at ¶ 24 (“Therefore, someone’s sex \nor  gender  is  properly  understood  to  be  the  same  as  their  gender  identity.”).  Such  an \ninterpretation is foreclosed by the plain text and original understanding of Title IX. \nOut  of  the  gate,  Plaintiffs’  Title  IX  claim  face  a  significant  textual  hurdle:  the \ncongressional  decision  to  use  the  term  “sex”  and  not  “gender  identity[,]”  as  Plaintiffs \napparently prefer. To avoid this hurdle, Plaintiffs attempt to rewrite the plain and ordinary \nunderstanding of “sex” as one and the same as “gender identity,” suggesting that “someone’s \n18 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 27 of 34\nsex or gender is properly understood to be the same as their gender identity.”  Doc. 1 at ¶ 24. \nPlaintiffs’ interpretation of “sex” as “gender identity” finds no textual support in Title IX.  \nWhen Congress wants to protect against gender-identity discrimination, it does so \nexplicitly. See 18 U.S.C. § 249(a)(2) (defining hate crimes as causing willful bodily injury to \nanother on the basis of “actual or perceived . . . gender, sexual orientation, [or] gender identity \n. . . .”); 20 U.S.C. § 1092(f)(1)(F)(ii) (requiring the collection of data related to hate crimes \n“because of the actual or perceived . . gender, . . . sexual orientation, [or] gender identity . . . \n.”);  34  U.S.C.  §  30503(a)(1)(C)  (providing  financial  assistance  in  the  investigation  or \nprosecution of any crime motivated by “actual or perceived . . . gender, sexual orientation, [or] \ngender identity . . . .”). The Violence Against Women Act (“VAWA”), for example, prohibits \nfunded programs or activities from discriminating based on either “sex” or “gender identity.” \n42 U.S.C. § 13925(b)(13)(A). “Sex” and “gender identity” must have meant distinct things to \nthe Congress that enacted VAWA, for equating sex with gender identity would create an \nobvious surplusage. See, e.g., Nat’l Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat’l Bank & Tr. Co., 522 U.S. \n479, 501 (1998) (rejecting agency interpretation for making statutory language surplusage). The \nsubsequent use of the term “gender identity” in some contexts shows that Congress means \nsomething different when it fails to use that term — as it did in Title IX. See, e.g., Cardoza-\nFonseca v. INS, 480 U.S. 421, 432 (1987) (“The contrast between the language used in the two \nstandards, and the fact that Congress used a new standard to define the term ‘refugee,’ certainly \nindicate that Congress intended the two standards to differ.”)  \nStatutory context confirms “sex” as used in Title IX refers to traditional biological \nsex—not subjective gender identity. Surrounding provisions reveal the biological dichotomy \n19 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 28 of 34\nthat informs the two, distinct sexes. See 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(2) (describing how an institution \nmay change “from . . . . admit[ting] only students of one sex to . . . admit[ting] students of both \nsexes”)  (emphasis  added));  id.  §  1681(a)(6)(B)  (referring  to  ‘‘Men’s’’  and  ‘‘Women’s’’ \nassociations and organizations for ‘‘Boy[s]’’ and ‘‘Girl[s],’’ “the membership of which has \ntraditionally been limited to persons of one sex”) (emphases added)); see also id. § 1681(a)(5), (a)(7), \n(a)(8), (a)(9), (b).  \nIn stark contrast, Plaintiffs define sex as “multifaceted and comprised of many distinct \nbiologically-influenced characteristics,” but ultimately understood as “the sex or gender the \nindividual knows themselves to be.” Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 24-25. Plaintiffs’ subjective understanding \nof “sex” would render Title IX’s clear distinctions between two sexes, men and women, and \nboys and girls, entirely superfluous. For example, what purpose would Title IX’s permissive sex-\nbased distinctions between “Men’s” and “Women’s” associations serve if such identities are \nfluid and shift with an individual’s self-perception over time? If sex was as subjective as \nPlaintiffs propose, akin to a feeling and not a biological reality, Congress will have spilled a \ngreat deal of ink for no discernable purpose. \nThe legislative history and ordinary public meaning of the term “sex” at the time Title \nIX was enacted likewise confirms “sex” cannot be interpreted as subjective gender identity. \nSee Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., Georgia, 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1738 (2020) (“This Court normally \ninterprets a statute in accord with the ordinary public meaning of its terms at the time of its \nenactment.”); see also Sandifer v. United States Steel Corp., 571 U.S. 220, 227 (2014) (“It is a \n“fundamental canon of statutory construction” that, “unless otherwise defined, words will be \ninterpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.” (citation omitted)).  \n20 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 29 of 34\nAt  the  time  Title  IX  was  enacted  in  1972,  “sex”  carried  a  “narrow,  traditional \ninterpretation.” Ulane v. E. Airlines, Inc., 742 F.2d 1081, 1085–86 (7th Cir. 1984). During that \ntime, “virtually every dictionary definition of ‘sex’ referred to the physiological distinctions \nbetween males and females.” Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 632 (4th Cir. \n2020), as amended (Aug. 28, 2020) (Niemeyer, J. dissenting) (collecting dictionary definitions); \nsee also The Oxford English Dictionary 578 (1961) (“[t]he sum of those differences in the structure \nand function of the reproductive organs on the ground of which beings are distinguished as \nmale and female, and of the other physiological differences consequent on these.”); The \nAmerican  College  Dictionary  1109  (1970)  (“the  sum  of  the  anatomical  and  physiological \ndifferences with reference to which the male and the female are distinguished . . .”); The Random \nHouse College Dictionary 1206 (rev. ed. 1973) (“either the male or female division of a species, \nesp. as differentiated with reference to the reproductive functions.”); The American Heritage \nDictionary 1187 (1976) (“[t]he property or quality by which organisms are classified according \nto their reproductive functions”); Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary 1054 (1979) (“the sum of \nthe  structural,  functional,  and  behavioral  characteristics  of  living  beings  that  subserve \nreproduction by two interacting parents and that distinguish males and females”); The Random \nHouse College Dictionary 1206 (rev. ed. 1980) (“either the male or female division of a species, \nesp. as differentiated with reference to the reproductive functions”); The American Heritage \nDictionary of the English Language 1187 (1980) ( “two divisions” of organisms, “designated male \nand female,” classified “according to their re-productive functions.”).8 \n \n8 That definition of “sex” continues even to today. See, e.g., Webster’s New World College Dictionary \n1331 (5th ed. 2014) (“either of the two divisions, male or female, into which persons, animals, \nor plants are divided, with reference to their reproductive functions”); The American Heritage \n21 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 30 of 34\nAdditionally, “[t]he phrase ‘gender identity’ did not exist” in 1972 “outside of some \nesoteric psychological publications.” Ryan T. Anderson, Ph.D, and Melody Wood, Gender \nIdentity Policies in Schools: What Congress, the Courts, and the Trump Administration Should Do, The \nHeritage Foundation Backgrounder (Mar. 23, 2017).9 In fact, “the word ‘gender’” itself “had \nbeen coined only recently in contradistinction to sex.”  Id.   \nThe  earliest  Title  IX  rulemaking  codified  sex-separated  “toilet,  locker  room,  and \nshower facilities” without any discussion of gender identity. See 39 Fed. Reg. 22,227, 22,230 \n(June 20, 1974) (proposing the rule that is now C.F.R. § 106.33 without explanation); 40 Fed. \nReg. at 24,127, 24,141 (June 4, 1975) (finalizing the same rule without justification or response \nto  commentary).  Similarly,  proponents  of  Title  IX  included  an  amendment  expressly \npermitting schools to maintain separate living facilities on the basis of sex without any \ndiscussion or dissent regarding gender identity. See 117 Cong. Rec. 39260, 39263 (1971); H.R. \nConf. Rep. No. 92-1085 at 222. \nThe undisputable purpose of Title IX also confirms the ordinary understand of “sex” \nas biological. Title IX was initially introduced as the Women’s Equality Act of 1971. See Paul \nC. Sweeney, Abuse Misuse & Abrogation of the Use of Legislative History: Title IX & Peer Sexual \nHarassment, 66 UMKC L. Rev. 41, 54 (1997). The senator who introduced the legislation \ndescribed its aim to “eradicate the pervasive, divisive, and unwarranted discrimination against \n \nDictionary 1605 (5th ed. 2011) (“Either of the two divisions, designated female and male, by \nwhich most organisms are classified on the basis of their reproductive organs and functions”); \nMerriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 1140 (11th ed. 2011) (“either of the two major forms of \nindividuals that occur in many species and that are distinguished respectively as female or male \nesp. on the basis of their reproductive organs and structures”). \n9 Available at https://www.heritage.org/education/report/gender-identity-policies-schools-\nwhat-congress-the-courts-and-the-trump. \n22 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 31 of 34\na majority of our citizens, the women of this country.” Id. (quotation omitted) (emphasis added). \nThe senator went on: “[w]hat we are trying to do is provide equal access for women and men \nstudents to the educational process and the extracurricular activities in a school, where there \nis not a unique facet such as football involved.” Id. at 59 (citing 117 Cong. Rec. 30399, 30406 \n(1971)); see also id. at 61 (describing Senator Bayh’s remarks on the goal to end “corrosive and \nunjustified discrimination against women” that was “overt and socially acceptable within the \nacademic community”).  \nThe statute’s proponents focused on prohibiting “sex discrimination,” see 118 Cong. \nRec. 5803 (1972), but at the same time sought to preserve schools’ ability to separate males \nand females to preserve “personal privacy,” see 118 Cong. Rec. 5807 (1972); see also Doe v. \nLuzerne Cty., 660 F.3d 169, 176–77 (3d Cir. 2011) (recognizing that an individual has “a \nconstitutionally protected privacy interest in his or her partially clothed body” and that this \n“reasonable expectation of privacy” exists “particularly while in the presence of members of \nthe opposite sex”); Brannum v. Overton Cty. Sch. Bd., 516 F.3d 489, 494 (6th Cir. 2008) (explaining \nthat “the constitutional right to privacy . . . includes the right to shield one’s body from \nexposure to viewing by the opposite sex”) (citing 118 Cong. Rec. 5803 (1972)); Sepulveda v. \nRamirez, 967 F.2d 1413, 1416 (9th Cir. 1992) (explaining that “[t]he right to bodily privacy is \nfundamental” and that “common sense, decency, and [state] regulations” require recognizing \nit in a parolee’s right not to be observed by an officer of the opposite sex while producing a \nurine sample); Lee v. Downs, 641 F.2d 1117, 1119 (4th Cir. 1981) (recognizing that, even though \ninmates in prison “surrender many rights of privacy,” their “special sense of privacy in their \ngenitals”  should  not  be  violated  through  exposure  unless  “reasonably  necessary”  and \n23 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 32 of 34\nexplaining that the “involuntary exposure of [genitals] in the presence of people of the other \nsex may be especially demeaning and humiliating”). \nNothing in Bostock dictates otherwise. See supra Section II(A).  The facts of Bostock are \ndistinguishable: here, S.B. 615 involves no invidious discrimination nor adverse employment \naction. The law at issue is also distinguishable: here, the text of Title IX is different from Title \nVII. See Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1753 (noting its holding concerned only Title VII, that “other \nfederal or state laws that prohibit sex discrimination”—like Title IX—were not “before” the \nCourt, and refusing to “prejudge any such question” about what those statutes require); \nMeriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3d 492, 510 n.4 (6th Cir. 2021) (“Title VII differs from Title IX in \nimportant respects.”); cf. Pelcha v. MW Bancorp, Inc., 988 F.3d 318, 324 (6th Cir. 2021) (“[T]he \nCourt in Bostock was clear on the narrow reach of its decision and how it was limited only to \nTitle VII itself.”). Title IX prohibits discrimination “on the basis of sex,” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) \n(emphasis added), rather than “because of . . . sex,” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Additionally, \nTitle  IX—unlike  Title  VII—expressly  authorizes  separation  based  on  sex  in  certain \ncircumstances, including in restroom facilities. \nIn the four decades after the enactment of Title IX, there was no question that sex \nmeant sex as it has always been understood. See, e.g., N. Haven Bd. of Educ. v. Bell, 456 U.S. 512, \n523 n.13 (1982); Cannon v. Univ. of Chi., 441 U.S. 677, 680 (1979) (describing that Title IX grew \nfrom a concern about discrimination against women). That was the implicit, if not explicit, \nholding of nearly every court to consider the issue until very recently. See, e.g., supra Section \nII(B); Etsitty v. Utah Transit Auth., 502 F.3d 1215, 1221–22 (10th Cir. 2007) (Title VII); Sommers \nv. Budget Mktg., Inc., 667 F.2d 748, 750 (8th Cir. 1982) (Title VII); but see Whitaker By Whitaker \n24 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 33 of 34\nv. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034 (7th Cir. 2017); Grimm v. Gloucester \nCnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586 (4th Cir. 2020), as amended (Aug. 28, 2020). Although some recent \ncases have emerged adopting Plaintiffs’ erroneous and atextual gender identity discrimination \ntheories:  “[n]ot long ago, a suit challenging the lawfulness of separating bathrooms on the \nbasis of sex would have been unthinkable.” Adams v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 3 F.4th 1299, \n1321 (11th Cir. 2021), reh’g en banc granted, 9 F.4th 1369 (11th Cir. 2021) (Pryor, C.J., dissenting). \nThe overwhelming authorities cited herein, as well as basic logic, establish that should still be \nthe case. \nSince there can be no legitimate dispute that “sex” in Title IX does not encompass \n“gender identity” or an individual’s subject feeling of gender, Plaintiffs’ Title IX claims must \nfail. The State does not violate Title IX by requiring schools to separate multiple occupancy \nrestrooms and changing areas consistent with students’ biological sex. To the contrary, Title \nIX and its regulations expressly permit such a law.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor the many reasons stated herein, Plaintiffs claims fail as a matter of law. State \nDefendants respectfully this Court dismiss the Complaint in its entirety and grant all other and \nfurther relief as the Court deems appropriate. \n \n \n   \n   \n25 \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 47   Filed 10/26/22   Page 34 of 34\n  Respectfully submitted, \n \ns/ Audrey A.

Plaintiffs  Andrew  Bridge,1  Mark  Miles,  and  Sarah  Stiles,2  minors \nrepresented in this lawsuit  by their  respective parents and next  friends (collectively, \n“Plaintiffs”), are Oklahoma public school or public charter school students.  They are just \nlike every other middle and high school student, teenagers coming of age as they seek to \nfit in, navigate life’s challenges, obtain support and encouragement, and learn.  Just like \ntheir peers, Plaintiffs enter their school’s doors each morning filled with dreams for their \nfuture careers and lives.  And just like their peers, each one of them is entitled to an \neducation without being singled out for discriminatory unequal treatment. \n2.  After the last Oklahoma legislative session, the 2022–2023 school year \nbrought a cruel and harmful burden targeting Plaintiffs simply because they happen to be \n \n1 Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2(h), Plaintiff Andrew Bridge, a minor, waives the privacy \nprotections afforded by Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2(a) as to his name only. \n2 For the reasons set forth in a motion contemporaneously filed with this Complaint for \nDeclaratory, Injunctive, and Other Relief, Plaintiffs Mark Miles and Sarah Stiles proceed \nunder pseudonyms. \n2 \n \n\n     \ntransgender—meaning that they consistently, persistently, and insistently identify as a sex \nthat is different than the sex each was assigned at birth.  Plaintiffs and other youth who are \ntransgender in Oklahoma schools now face mandated discipline, possibly even suspension, \nsimply for using the restroom and other facilities at school corresponding with who they \nare. \n3.  On  May  25,  2022,  Oklahoma  Governor  Kevin  Stitt  signed  into  law \nOklahoma Senate Bill 615, which has been codified as Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § 1-125 (“SB \n615”), and which is now in effect.3  Section 1 of SB 615 mandates that each Oklahoma \npublic school and public charter school serving pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade \nstudents designate all multiple occupancy restrooms or changing areas exclusively for the \nuse of either the “male sex” or the “female sex.”  Under SB 615, “sex” is defined as “the \nphysical condition of being male or female based on genetics and physiology, as identified \non the individual’s original birth certificate.”  This is so even when the individual knows \nthemself to be a different sex, and even when others perceive the individual to be a different \nsex than is identified on their original birth certificate.  \n4.  Under  SB  615,  the  Oklahoma  State  Board  of  Education  is  required  to \npromulgate and enforce rules to implement the provisions of Section 1 of SB 615. \n \n3 While SB 615 applies to students, school staff, and visitors to the campus of each school, \nthe Complaint focuses specifically on the student population since Plaintiffs are students. \n3 \n \n\n     \n5.  Oklahoma school districts and public charter school governing boards are \nrequired by SB 615 to adopt a disciplinary action policy for individuals who refuse to \ncomply with the provisions of Section 1 of SB 615. \n6.  If the Oklahoma State Board of Education finds that a school district or \npublic charter school is not complying with SB 615, SB 615 requires that the noncompliant \nschool district or public charter school receive a 5% decrease in state funding for the fiscal \nyear following the year of noncompliance. \n7.  Plaintiffs bring this action to challenge the legality of recently-enacted SB \n615, to preliminarily and permanently enjoin enforcement of SB 615, to obtain declaratory \nrelief  regarding  SB  615,  and  to  obtain  nominal  damages  on  the  basis  that  SB  615 \ndiscriminates on its face against students who are transgender, and as applied to each of \nthe Plaintiffs on the basis of their sex, gender identity, and transgender status, in violation \nof the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Title IX of the \nEducation Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”), 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE  \n8.  This action arises under the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \nand Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq.  \n9.  This Court has original jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action \npursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §  1331  because  the  matters  in  controversy  arise  under  the \nConstitution and laws of the United States, and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) and (4) \nbecause the action is brought to redress deprivations, under color of state authority, of \nrights, privileges, and immunities secured by the U.S. Constitution, and seeks to secure \n4 \n \n\n     \nnominal damages and equitable relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which provides a cause of \naction for the protection of civil rights. \n10.  This Court has the authority to enter a declaratory judgment and to provide \npreliminary and permanent injunctive relief pursuant to Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure, and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n11.  Venue is proper in the Western District of Oklahoma under 28 U.S.C. § \n1391(b)(1) and (2) because Defendants and/or agents of Defendants reside and/or may be \nfound in this District, and a substantial portion of the communications, transactions, events, \nor omissions underlying Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this District. \nPARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs  \n12.  Plaintiff Andrew Bridge (“Andy”) is a 16-year-old boy enrolled as a student \nin 12th grade at Noble High School, a public school operated by Defendant Noble Public \nSchools.  Andy is a hard-working, high-achieving student, who enjoys reading, painting, \nand competing as a Varsity member of the Noble High School Academic Team.  Andy is \nalso transgender, and therefore harmed by SB 615 and his school’s discipline policy, which \nprohibits him from using the boys’ restrooms at school.  This prohibition applies even \nthough Andy used the boys’ restrooms at his school without issue during the 2021–2022 \nacademic year.  Andy is a resident of Oklahoma and, as a minor, brings this action pursuant \nto Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(c) by and through his parents and next friends, Eli \nBridge and Aysha Prather. \n5 \n \n\n     \n13.  Plaintiff Mark Miles (“Mark”) is a boy enrolled as a student at a public school \noperated by Defendant Moore Public Schools.  Mark is also transgender, and therefore \nharmed by SB 615 and his school’s discipline policy, which prohibits him from using the \nboys’ restrooms at school.  Mark is a resident of Oklahoma and, as a minor, brings this \naction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(c) by and through his parents and \nnext friends, Max and Mia Miles. \n14.  Plaintiff Sarah Stiles (“Sarah”) is a girl enrolled as a student at a public \ncharter school operated by Defendant Harding Independent School District, Inc.  Sarah is \nalso transgender, and therefore harmed by SB 615, and her school’s discipline policy, \nwhich prohibits her from using the girls’ restrooms at school.  Sarah is a resident of \nOklahoma and, as a minor, brings this action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n17(c) by and through her parents and next friends, Steve and Sue Stiles. \nB.  Defendants  \n15.  Defendant Oklahoma State Department of Education (“OSDE”) is charged \nwith determining the policies and directing the administration and supervision of the public \nschool system of Oklahoma.  Okla. Stat. tit.70, § 1-105(A).  OSDE is a recipient of Federal \nfinancial assistance and, therefore, subject to Title IX. \n16.  Defendant Joy Hofmeister is the State Superintendent of Public Instruction \n(“State Superintendent”) in Oklahoma.  She controls and directs OSDE and also serves as \na member and chairperson of the State Board of Education (“SBOE”).  Okla. Stat. tit.70 §§ \n1-105(C), 3-107.1.  In addition to concurrent responsibilities with the other members of the \nSBOE, the State Superintendent “adopts polices and makes rules for the organization, \n6 \n \n\n     \noperation and administration” of OSDE.  Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § 3-107.1(2).  The State \nSuperintendent  is  also  “responsible  for  interpretation  of  policy  and  rules  set  by  the \n[SBOE].”  Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § 3-107.1(6).  The State Superintendent’s “control” extends \nto any “other operations necessary to carry out the powers, duties and functions of the State \nSuperintendent and the [SBOE].”  Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § 3-107.1(3).  Defendant Hofmeister \nis a person within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and is sued in her official capacity for \nprospective equitable relief.  At all relevant times, Defendant Hoffmeister has acted and \ncontinues to act under color of state law. \n17.  Defendants  Carlisha  Bradley,  Jennifer  Monies,  Estela  Hernandez,  Brian \nBobek, Trent Smith, and Sarah Lepak (collectively, “Appointed Board Members”) are \nmembers of the SBOE.  The State Superintendent and Appointed Board Members have \nconcurrent responsibility as the SBOE to, inter alia, adopt policies and operate the public \nschool system of the state.  Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § 3-104.  On August 25, 2022, the SBOE \nadopted emergency rules governing the implementation of SB 615 in public schools and \npublic charter schools.  Defendants Appointed Board Members are each a person within \nthe meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and are sued in their official capacities for prospective \nequitable relief.  At all relevant times, Defendant Appointed Board Members acted and \ncontinue to act under color of state law. \n18.  Defendant John O’Connor (“OAG” or “Oklahoma Attorney General”) is the \nAttorney General for the State of Oklahoma.  Defendant O’Connor has demonstrated a \nwillingness to exercise his duties and powers as Oklahoma Attorney General to exclude \nstudents who are transgender from multiple occupancy school restrooms and other sex-\n7 \n \n\n     \nseparated facilities that align with such students’ gender.  Upon information and belief, \nDefendant O’Connor will, directly or indirectly, enforce SB 615, through his duties and \npowers as Oklahoma Attorney General. Okla. Stat. tit. 74, § 74-18b.  See, e.g., Attorney \nGeneral O’Connor Releases Statement Following the Signing of SB 615 and HB 4327, \nMay 26, 2022 (stating “[t]he Attorney General has been working vigorously on this issue \nfor months now” and has “already begun pushing back… and will continue to do so….”).  \nDefendant O’Connor is a person within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and is sued in his \nofficial  capacity  for  prospective  equitable  relief.    At  all  relevant  times,  Defendant \nO’Connor has acted and continues to act under color of state law. \n19.  Defendant  Independent  School  District  No.  40  of  Cleveland  County, \nOklahoma (“Noble Public Schools” or “NPS”) is a body corporate that acts by and through \nits governing body, the Noble Board of Education (“Noble BOE”).  See Okla. Stat. tit. 70, \n§§ 5-105, 5-106.

Every  individual’s  sex  is  multifaceted  and  comprised  of  many  distinct \nbiologically-influenced  characteristics,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  chromosomal \nmakeup,  hormones,  internal  and  external  reproductive  organs,  secondary  sex \ncharacteristics,  and  gender  identity.    Where  there  is  a  divergence  between  these \ncharacteristics, gender identity is the most important and determinative factor.  Therefore, \nsomeone’s sex or gender is properly understood to be the same as their gender identity. \n25.  All human beings have a gender identity—the sex or gender the individual \nknows themself to be.  A person’s gender identity is a fundamental component of their \nidentity that is durable and deeply rooted.  Although the detailed mechanisms are unknown, \nthere is a medical consensus that there is a significant biologic component underlying \ngender identity.  It cannot be changed by social or medical intervention. \n26.  When a child is born, healthcare providers typically make a sex designation \nat birth based on a visual assessment of the infant’s external genitalia.  This is the sex that \nis most commonly listed on a person’s original birth certificate.  Most people are cisgender, \nmeaning that their gender identity aligns with the sex they were assigned at birth.  A girl \nwho is cisgender has a female gender identity and was assigned female at birth.  A boy \nwho is cisgender has a male gender identity and was assigned male at birth.  \n27.  Not everyone’s gender identity aligns with the sex they were assigned at \nbirth.  A person is transgender if they have a gender identity that does not align with their \nsex assigned at birth.  A girl who is transgender has a female gender identity although she \n10 \n \n\n     \nwas assigned male at birth.  A boy who is transgender has a male gender identity although \nhe was assigned female at birth.  \n28.  Individuals who are transgender have a consistent, persistent, and insistent \nunderstanding that their sex is different from the sex they were assigned as at birth.  \nIndividuals who are cisgender have a consistent, persistent, and insistent understanding \nthat their sex is the same as the sex they were assigned at birth. \n29.  Some  people  who  are  transgender  experience  sustained  and  clinically \nsignificant distress caused by the incongruence between their gender and their sex assigned \nat birth.  The American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of \nMental Disorders (“DSM-5”) diagnostic term for this sustained and clinically significant \ndistress is “Gender Dysphoria.”  Not all people who are transgender experience gender \ndysphoria. \n30.  In order to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria, the incongruence must have \npersisted for at least six months and be accompanied by clinically significant distress or \nimpairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.  \n31.  Being transgender is not itself a medical condition.  But gender dysphoria is \na serious medical condition that, if left untreated, can result in debilitating anxiety, severe \ndepression, suicidal ideation, self-harm, and suicide.  \n32.  The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (“WPATH”) \nand the Endocrine Society have published widely accepted standards of care for treating \ngender dysphoria.  The medical treatment for gender dysphoria is to eliminate the clinically \nsignificant distress by helping a person who is transgender live in alignment with their \n11 \n \n\n     \ngender identity.  This treatment is sometimes referred to as “gender transition,” “transition-\nrelated care,” or “gender-affirming care.”  These standards of care are recognized by the \nAmerican  Academy  of  Pediatrics,  which  agrees  that  this  care  is  safe,  effective,  and \nmedically necessary treatment for the health and well-being of youth suffering from gender \ndysphoria.  \n33.  The goal of treatment for gender dysphoria is to align the body and life of a \nperson who is transgender with their gender identity.  Generally, treatment in accordance \nwith the WPATH Standards of Care may include: (1) social transition; (2) hormone \ntherapy; and/or (3) gender-affirming surgeries.  The precise treatment for gender dysphoria \ndepends upon each person’s individualized needs, and the medical standards of care and \ntreatment differ across age groups, depending on whether the person suffering from gender \ndysphoria is a prepubertal child, adolescent, or adult.  \n34.  Treatment  of  gender  dysphoria  for  prepubertal  children  with  gender \ndysphoria is limited to social transition.  Social transition for this age group entails allowing \na child who is transgender to live and be socially recognized in accordance with their \ngender identity in all aspects of their lives.  Typically, social transition includes allowing \nchildren to wear clothing, cut or grow their hair, adopt other appearance styles, use names \nand pronouns, and use restrooms and other sex-separated facilities in accordance with their \ngender, instead of the sex assigned to them at birth.  \n35.  For example, for a boy who is transgender, social transition can include, \namong other things, changing his first name to a name typically associated with boys, using \nmale pronouns, changing his identity documents to reflect his male gender, wearing \n12 \n \n\n     \nclothing and modifying his appearance to that stereotypically associated with boys, using \nrestrooms and other facilities for boys, and otherwise living as a boy in all aspects of life.  \nAnd vice versa for a girl who is transgender.  \n36.  Social transition as part of treatment for gender dysphoria requires that a boy \nwho is transgender be recognized as a boy and treated the same as all other boys by those \nin their lives, including family members, friends, educators, peers, and others in the \ncommunity, as well as by government agencies and officials and private entities with which \nhe interacts, or else he may experience significant harm.  The same is true for social \ntransition as part of treatment for gender dysphoria for a girl who is transgender.  A girl \nwho is transgender must be recognized as a girl and treated the same as all other girls by \nthose in her life, her community, and all government agencies and officials, as well as \nprivate entities with which she interacts, or else she may experience significant harm.  \n37.  Under the WPATH Standards of Care, when a child begins to enter puberty, \nthey have the option, under medical supervision and with the informed consent of their \nparents or guardians, to receive endogenous puberty-delaying medical treatment.  The \npuberty-delaying  treatment  helps  prepubertal  children  who  are  transgender  live  in \nalignment with their gender identity and treats the symptoms of gender dysphoria.  Puberty-\ndelaying treatment is reversible.  It is also the same treatment provided to children who are \nexperiencing precocious puberty—a condition when young children experience puberty \nyears before the typical onset of puberty.  Because puberty-delaying treatment allows youth \nwho are transgender to avoid going through their endogenous puberty, it helps mitigate \n13 \n \n\n     \ngender  dysphoria  and  prevents  permanent  physical  changes  that  would  otherwise \naccompany their endogenous puberty that are inconsistent with their gender. \n38.  For adolescents who are transgender and who are ready to begin puberty \n(after either puberty-delaying treatment or starting endogenous puberty), the WPATH \ntreatment  protocols  recommend  the  initiation  of  gender  identity  congruent  hormone \ntherapy.  Hormone therapy, which, upon informed consent by a parent or guardian of the \nadolescent, is provided under the supervision of a medical professional.  Hormone therapy \nreplaces the individual’s endogenous hormones with gender identity congruent hormones, \nat appropriate and standard levels for their age.  Boys who are transgender undergo \ntestosterone therapy, and girls who are transgender undergo estrogen therapy.  Gender \nidentity congruent hormone therapy allows an adolescent who is transgender, depending \non a variety of factors and to various degrees, to experience the same physical changes to \nsecondary sexual characteristics experienced by their cisgender peers. \nII.     Youth Who Are Transgender and Their Schools  \n39.  The ability to live consistently with one’s gender identity is critical to the \nhealth and well-being of people who are transgender, but particularly youth who are \ntransgender.  \n40.  Students who are transgender have been, are, and will continue to attend \nschools across the country and in Oklahoma.  While students who are transgender have \nlong been part of school communities, in recent decades they have had more widespread \naccess to the medical and psychological support that each needs to live as the person they \ntruly are and to thrive.  \n14 \n \n\n     \n41.  Because of increased access to care and support from health care providers, \ntheir families, and their communities, many students who are transgender attend school \nwithout classmates and peers knowing they are transgender.  For example, many students \nhave already socially transitioned to the sex they know themselves to be before beginning \nschool and many others transfer to a new school after transitioning.  \n42.  With hormone therapy, adolescent students who are transgender develop \nphysical sex characteristics typical of their gender identity—not the sex they were assigned \nat birth.  For example, hormone therapy affects muscle tone and structure and produces \nsecondary sex characteristics such as a lower voice and an increase in facial and body hair \nin boys and breasts and wider hips in girls.  \n43.  According to every major medical and mental health organization, including \nthe American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American \nPsychiatric Association, and the American Psychological Association, excluding boys and \ngirls who are transgender from using the same restrooms as other boys and girls is harmful \nto the health and wellbeing of those transgender students.  When excluded from the \nmultiple occupancy restrooms, students who are transgender often avoid using the restroom \nentirely.  This may be because using single-occupancy restrooms would reveal that they \nare transgender to others, is stigmatizing, or is impractical to use given how far the single-\noccupancy restroom may be from a student’s classes or for other reasons.  Those who avoid \nusing restrooms at school may suffer infections and other negative health consequences as \na result of avoiding being forced to use a restroom that does not align with their gender.  \nTreating boys and girls who are transgender differently than their peers and excluding them \n15 \n \n\n     \nfrom the same restrooms used by peers of the same gender also increases their risk of or \nworsens, their anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, and self-harm; could lead to suicide; \nand interferes with the treatment of, and may cause or increase the intensity of, their gender \ndysphoria.  \n44.  Educators and school administrators across the country also recognize that \nexcluding boys and girls who are transgender from multiple occupancy restrooms that align \nwith their gender interferes with their ability to learn and thrive at school.  It impairs their \nability to develop a healthy sense of self, peer relationships, and the cognitive skills \nnecessary to succeed in adult life.  In light of these harms, the National Association of \nSchool Psychologists, National  Association of Secondary School Principals, National \nAssociation  of  Elementary  School  Principals,  and  the  American  School  Counselor \nAssociation have all called upon schools to allow boys and girls who are transgender to \nuse the same restrooms as their cisgender counterparts.  \n45.  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics and other major medical \nand mental health organizations, there is no evidence that allowing boys and girls who are \ntransgender to use the same restrooms as their cisgender counterparts causes any harm to \ncisgender students.  \n46.  Schools can provide accommodations for all students—whether transgender \nor not—to enhance their own sense of privacy without discriminating against students who \nare transgender by excluding them from multiple occupancy restrooms used by students of \nthe same gender as the students who are transgender.  \n16 \n \n\n     \n47.  Plaintiffs and other students in Oklahoma who are transgender, as well as \nstudents across the country who are transgender, already use the same multiple occupancy \nfacilities in public as other boys and girls.  \n48.  Permitting boys and girls who are transgender to simply exist as who they \nare, and treating them the same as any other boy or girl, harms no one, and it is the only \nway that students who are transgender can equally participate in education, employment, \nand society at large.  \nIII.     SB 615 \n49.  SB 615 was originally introduced by Oklahoma State Senator David Bullard \non January 21, 2022, as a bill to amend Oklahoma’s law regarding inspection of sex \neducation curriculum to, among other things, define “sexual behavior or attitudes” to \ninclude “sexual orientation and gender identity.”  On April 28, 2022, following an untimely \namendment, the Oklahoma House of Representatives voted to suspend Rule 8.8 of the \nHouse Rules4 to introduce an amendment to SB 615.  This amendment removed the original \nlanguage and title of the bill, changing it from a bill regarding sex education curricula to \none discriminating against students who are transgender by denying them equal access to \nmultiple occupancy restrooms and changing areas. \n \n4 Rule 8.8(c) “An amendment to a main floor amendment must be filed no later than forty-\neight (48) hours after a bill or joint resolution is initially published on the Floor Calendar, \nto be eligible for consideration.” House Rules of the Oklahoma House of Representatives \nfor the 58th Oklahoma Legislature (2021-2022). \n17 \n \n\n     \n50.  SB 615 in its current form was passed by the Oklahoma Legislature and \nthereafter signed by Oklahoma Governor Stitt on May 25, 2022, when it immediately went \ninto full force and effect pursuant to Section 2 of SB 615.  \n51.  As enacted, SB 615 provides that it was adopted “to ensure privacy and \nsafety”  at  each  public  school  and  public  charter  school  that  serves  students  in  pre-\nkindergarten through twelfth grades in Oklahoma.   \n52.  The purported “privacy” and “safety” concerns are unfounded pretext to \ntarget students who are transgender.  Students who are transgender pose no risks to the \nprivacy or safety of other students, whether in using multiple occupancy facilities or in any \nother context.  \n53.  In a press release following the passage of SB 615, Senator Bullard explained \nthe purpose of the bill as “removing all forms of indoctrination,” noting “how far we \nslipped in our society” that “we are willing to fail our kids by coercing them into living in \nsomeone else’s fantasy,” presumably referring to the existence of transgender people as a \n“fantasy.”  \n54.  On August 25, 2022, Defendant SBOE adopted emergency rules pursuant to \nSection 1(H) of SB 615 (“SBOE Emergency Rules”).  The SBOE Emergency Rules are set \nforth in Title 210 of the Oklahoma Administrative Code as new Section 35-3-186(h).  They \nmirror SB 615 by requiring every public school and public charter school that serves \nstudents in prekindergarten through twelfth grades in Oklahoma to designate all multiple \noccupancy restrooms or changing areas for the exclusive use of either the male sex or the \nfemale sex, defined as “the physical condition of being male or female based on genetics \n18 \n \n\n     \nand physiology, as identified on the individual’s original birth certificate.”  SB 615 and the \nSBOE Emergency Rules also require that schools provide a “Reasonable Accommodation” \nby providing access to a single-occupancy restroom or changing room for individuals who \ndo not wish to utilize the multiple occupancy restroom or changing area designated for \ntheir “sex” (as defined in SB 615). \n55.  These restroom “accommodations” provided to Plaintiffs by their respective \nschools are not accommodations at all.  Offering students who are transgender a choice \nbetween single-occupancy restrooms, restrooms designated for a gender incongruent with \nwho they are, or no restrooms at all is discrimination.  These so-called “accommodations” \nreinforce the differential treatment and trauma associated with living under SB 615, \nviolating Plaintiffs’ constitutional and statutory rights under the Equal Protection Clause \nof the U.S. Constitution and Title IX. \n56.  The legislature included a punitive 5% budget cut to school districts found \nto violate SB 615, delegating enforcement authority to Defendant SBOE.  For Oklahoma \nschools, particularly those that are already underfunded and forced to limit or cut vital \nprograms  and  services  for  students  year  after  year,  any  decrease  in  state  funding  is \nunpalatable. \n57.  SB 615 further provides a new “cause of action” for any “parent or legal \nguardian enrolled in and physically attending a public school district or public charter \nschool” for “noncompliance” with its mandate to bar transgender students from access to \nmultiple occupancy restrooms that align with their gender.  The threat of private lawsuits \n19 \n \n\n     \nand accompanying expenses against Oklahoma public schools and public charter schools \nunderscores the coercive nature of SB 615. \n58.  SB 615, the SBOE Emergency Rules, and  LEA Defendants’ respective \ndisciplinary policies or practices harm students who are transgender, including Plaintiffs, \nby excluding them from the same multiple occupancy facilities that are provided to peers \nof their same gender. \nIV.        Plaintiffs’  Experiences  in  Oklahoma  Schools  as  Students  Who  Are \n  Transgender \n \n59.  Plaintiffs attend school under compulsion of State law.  Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § \n10-105.  Like most students, Plaintiffs attend school to learn, develop friendships, and \nprepare themselves for higher education and success throughout their adult lives. \nA. Andy Bridge \n60.  Plaintiff Andy Bridge is a boy.  He also is transgender. \n61.  Andy is 16 years old, and is a registered student at Noble High School, which \nis part of the Noble Public Schools in Noble, Oklahoma.  He began his senior year on \nAugust 10, 2022. \n62.  Andy is an honor student whose academic record is extremely important to \nhim.  He competes on the Varsity team in the Academic Bowl.  After high school, he plans \nto attend a four-year university to study Psychology.  Ultimately, he would like to be either \na clinical psychologist or psychiatrist.  In his free time, he loves to paint and read. \n63.  At birth, Andy was designated as “female” on his birth certificate, even \nthough he is a boy.  At the onset of puberty, Andy started to feel uncomfortable with his \n20 \n \n\n     \nbody.  After many discussions with his therapist, physician, and supportive friends, and \nafter extensive reading and thinking about gender identity, Andy felt ready to come out to \nhis family as transgender, which he did during the summer of 2020.  \n64.  As he came to understand his identity as a boy, Andy began taking steps \ntowards aligning his lived experience with his gender.  Andy cut his hair short and began \nwearing more masculine clothing.  He informed his close friends of his name and pronouns.  \nEach gradual step of his transition brought him a sense of relief and happiness, and he felt \nlike he was finally starting to live the way he was meant to live. \n65.  Andy has since been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, and that diagnosis \nhas been confirmed by multiple health providers.  \n66.  Andy began pursuing medical treatment for gender dysphoria in June 2021 \nat Oklahoma Children’s Adolescent Medicine Clinic (“OU Health”).  He has been under \nthe care of health care professionals at OU Health since May 2018 after he was referred \nthere by his primary care physician. \n67.  During Andy’s junior year at Noble High School in August 2021, he lived as \nhis authentic self, meaning as the boy he is.  His name was changed on his school records \nwhere possible and teachers were informed that he uses male pronouns.  At school, he is \ngenerally perceived by students and staff alike as a boy.  His peers and teachers generally \nuse male pronouns to refer to him, and he is generally treated as the boy he is in every \nrespect.  \n68.  Andy consistently used the boys’ restrooms at school for the entire 2021–\n2022 school year with the knowledge and support of school administration.  He knew that \n21 \n \n\n     \nhe belonged in the boys’ restroom, so he simply used the boys’ restrooms along with all \nthe other boys.  Andy always used one of the stalls, just as he continues to do in every other \nsetting where he uses male restrooms. \n69.  Before school started this year, Andy and his mother spoke with the vice \nprincipal and principal of his school regarding the school district’s restroom policy.  The \nprincipal and vice principal called a district-level administrator who stated that NPS’s \npolicy is that transgender students would have a single-occupancy restroom made available \nto them.  If there was a complaint about a transgender student using the “wrong” restroom \n(that is, a multiple occupancy restroom used by students of the same gender), they would \nbe counseled to use other restrooms.  If Andy persisted in using the boys’ restroom after \nbeing counseled to use other restrooms, he would be subject to further discipline.  At the \nend of the conversation, both Andy and his mother made it clear that Andy planned to \ncontinue using the boys’ restroom this school year. \n70.  Since school has started again, Andy has either used the boys’ restroom \nbetween classes or returned home during extended breaks in his schedule to use the \nrestroom at home. \n71.  Being banned from the boys’ restroom makes Andy feel singled out and \nstigmatized.  Andy just wants to be treated with the same dignity and respect as all other \nboys. \nB. Mark Miles \n72.  Plaintiff Mark Miles is a boy.  He also is transgender. \n22 \n \n\n     \n73.  Mark  is  a  student  enrolled  at  a  Moore  Public  Schools’  high  school  in \nOklahoma City, Oklahoma.  He began the current school year on August 11, 2022. \n74.  Mark’s favorite subject in school is AP music theory.  He loves music and \nplays guitar.  After he finishes high school, he would like to attend college and study music \ntheory.  Ultimately, he would like a career in music production. \n75.  At birth, Mark was designated as “female” on his birth certificate, even \nthough he is a boy.  From a very young age, Mark knew he was a boy.  He would tell people \nthat he was a boy, and if they did not agree he would argue with them.  He never wanted \nto wear feminine clothing, such as dresses and skirts.  He also never wanted to play with \nwhat  are  traditionally  thought  of  as  “girl”  toys  and  would  only  play  with  what  are \ntraditionally thought of as “boy” toys.  \n76.  It was not until Mark was ten that he knew what being “transgender” was.  \nDuring the summer of 2018, shortly after finding the language to describe himself, he came \nout to his family as transgender.  Mark’s family had a positive reaction to him coming out \nas transgender—everyone was accepting and supportive of him.  \n77.  After  coming  out,  Mark  began  taking  steps  towards  aligning  his  lived \nexperience with his gender identity.  Mark cut his hair short, and his family began to use \nhis correct pronouns and name.  The day he cut his hair short was one of the happiest days \nof his life.  With each step he took, Mark began to feel more and more like his true self.  \n78.  Mark has since been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, and that diagnosis has \nbeen confirmed by multiple health providers. \n23 \n \n\n     \n79.  Mark began pursuing medical treatment for gender dysphoria in July 2019 at \nOU Health after he was referred there by his primary care physician. \n80.  Mark has consistently used male restrooms in public since 2019 without \nincident.  Initially during junior high, he would use the faculty restroom because he felt \nmore comfortable doing so.  School ended up being remote during Mark’s eighth-grade \nyear due to the COVID-19 pandemic so there was no need to address restroom use at \nschool. \n81.  During Mark’s freshman year, which began in August 2021, Mark was living \nas his authentic self, meaning as the boy he is.  He had obtained a legal name change, which \nwas reflected in his school records.  At school, he was generally perceived by students and \nstaff alike as a boy.  His peers and teachers generally used male pronouns, and Mark was \ngenerally treated as a boy in every respect.  \n82.  Mark began using the boys’ restroom at the start of the 2021-2022 school \nyear.  He always used one of the stalls, as he continues to do in every other setting where \nhe uses the male restrooms. \n83.  In January 2022, a teacher informed the freshman principal that Mark was \nusing the boys’ restroom.  The freshman principal contacted both Mark and his parents and \ninformed them that it was Moore Public School’s policy that students must use the restroom \nthat that matches the sex they were assigned at birth.  Mark was no longer allowed to use \nthe boys’ restroom and was told that he was required to use the single-occupancy faculty \nrestroom. \n24 \n \n\n     \n84.  Mark’s parents asked for a written copy of the policy on transgender students \nand  restrooms.    On  February  9,  2022,  they  received  an  email  from  an  Assistant \nSuperintendent at Moore Public Schools stating that “[t]he district does not have a specific \npolicy with regard to this issue” and instead had a “consistent practice.”  The email also \nstated that transgender students would have access to a private restroom facility.  \n85.  After receiving this email, Mark’s parents requested a copy of the MPS’s \nTitle IX grievance policy and shortly thereafter filed a Title IX grievance with the school \ndistrict.  On June 15, 2022, Mark’s family received a final Decision and Opinion in the \nAppeal of the Title IX Grievance.  It denied all relief they had sought under Title IX \nbecause of Oklahoma’s enactment of SB 615. \n86.  While  this  process  was  pending,  Mark  was  required  to  use  a  single-\noccupancy restroom.  This caused Mark’s anxiety and depression to worsen.  Due to this \ndistress, Mark was pulled out of in-person classes and allowed to finish the school year \nonline.  \n87.  Not being allowed to use the boys’ restroom at school makes Mark very upset \nand heightens his gender dysphoria.  Mark also feels that being required to use a separate \nrestroom makes it more likely that his classmates will discover he is transgender.  Worrying \nabout this often distracts Mark from his schoolwork. \n88.  On August 8, 2022, the Moore BOE adopted a new discipline policy for \nMoore  Public  Schools  entitled,  “Use/Misuse  of  School  Restrooms  and  Changing \nFacilities” to comply with SB 615.  In relevant part, students at MPS, including Mark, are \nsubject to “disciplinary action outlined in the school discipline policy” if they do not use a \n25 \n \n\n     \nsingle-occupancy restroom or designated multiple occupancy restrooms “based on genetics \nand physiology; as identified on the individual’s original birth certificate.”  \n89.  The MPS school discipline policy includes a non-exclusive list of potential \ndisciplinary  actions,  including  a  conference  with  student/parent,  detention,  in-school \nsuspension, restriction of privileges, behavior contract, and suspension, among others.  See \nMPS Board Policy, Section 7115. \n90.  Mark began in-person classes at his high school in August 2022.  Despite \nMPS’s policy, Mark has continued to use the boys’ restroom at school just as he uses male \nrestrooms in all other public spaces.  \nC. Sarah Stiles \n91.  Plaintiff Sarah Stiles is a girl.  She is also transgender. \n92.  Sarah is enrolled as a student at Independence Charter Middle School, which \nis operated by HICD in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  She began school on August 11, 2022. \n93.  Sarah’s favorite subject at school is history.  In the future she would like to \nbe a drama or music teacher.  For fun, she likes to bowl, play video games, and play the \ncornet. Sarah is also very active in her church’s youth group and a local LGBTQ center’s \nyouth group. \n94.  At birth, Sarah was designated as “male” on her birth certificate, even though \nshe is a girl.  Sarah began questioning her gender in 2020 and, over time, Sarah started to \nbecome more certain that she is transgender.  \n95.  In  the  summer  of  2021,  Sarah  first  let  her  parents  know  that  she  was \nquestioning her gender identity.  The idea of going through male puberty brought Sarah \n26 \n \n\n     \ndiscomfort.  As an initial step, Sarah’s family began using her correct pronouns and started \ndoing research to better understand and support her.  Coming out to her family gave Sarah \na huge sense of relief.  When she told her family, it felt like a huge weight off of her chest.  \nAs her family began using her correct name and pronouns, it made her feel very happy and \neuphoric. \n96.  Sarah has since been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, and that diagnosis \nhas been confirmed by healthcare providers.  Sarah began pursuing medical treatment for \ngender dysphoria in April 2022 at OU Health.  \n97.  Sarah attended another middle school during the 2021-2022 school year.  \nThroughout the school year, Sarah was harassed and bullied for being transgender.  Most \nof the bullying and harassment stemmed from the school’s restroom policy that required \nSarah to use the boys’ restroom.  In the boys’ restroom, Sarah was assaulted on multiple \noccasions, including being struck on her backside and being shoved in the chest. \n98.  Because Sarah’s parents were unhappy with how Sarah was being treated at \nher former school, they decided to enroll her at ICMS after Sue Stiles heard that HICD \nschools were doing all they could to make sure that transgender students were accepted \nand treated equally. \n99.  Sue Stiles subsequently met with the principal and a counselor at ICMS, as \nwell as HICD Superintendent Steven Stefanik.  They were supportive and assured Sue \nStiles that Sarah would be able to use the multiple occupancy girls’ restrooms at ICMS.  \nThey noted that the ICMS Student Bill of Rights guaranteed Sarah’s access to multiple \n27 \n \n\n     \noccupancy girls’ restrooms.  Sarah was very excited about this because using the girls’ \nrestroom feels the most normal for her. \n100.  On August 10, 2022, Sarah used the girls’ restroom at ICMS without incident \nduring the school day.  Given news reports of several Oklahoma school districts enacting \ndiscipline policies in response to SB 615, Sue Stiles contacted the Principal at ICMS that \nday,  asking  whether  Sarah  would  be  permitted  to  use  the  multiple  occupancy  girls’ \nrestroom used by other girls at her school and, if not, what consequences she could face if \nshe does. \n101.  In response to Sue Stiles’ inquiry, Superintendent Stefanik responded that, \ndespite the assurances previously provided to Sarah Stiles’ parents, SB 615 was passed and \nthat ICBS and HICD’s governance board are obligated to follow the laws passed in \nOklahoma.  He quoted provisions of SB 615 to Sue Stiles, noted that ICMS has created a \nsingle-occupancy restroom that Sarah could use, and explained that “the HICD staff and \ncommunity will support the non-discrimination policy set forth by the governance board \nand help your student feel safe and comfortable at school, outside of the provisions \nprovided  in  SB  615.”    Superintendent  Stefanik  thus  acknowledged  that  SB  615  is \ndiscriminatory and will cause Sarah and other HICD students who are transgender to feel \nunsafe and uncomfortable at school.  \n102.  Defendant HICD, acting through its board, has delegated authority to enforce \nboard policy and rules regarding the discipline of students, including students at ICMS, to \nthe HICD Superintendent. \n28 \n \n\n     \n103.  The  single-occupancy  restroom  that  was  made  available  to  Sarah  is  a \nrestroom located in the classroom that is used for in-school suspension (“ISS”).  To use the \nrestroom, Sarah must walk through the ISS classroom.  The restroom is also used partially \nfor storage, including an unused wheelchair, empty picture frames, and plants. \n104.  Students who attend ISS view that Sarah uses this specific restroom.  This \nmakes Sarah nervous that students will discover that she is transgender because she uses \nthat restroom and will begin to treat her differently.  Sarah has already been approached by \na student and asked why she was using that specific restroom. \n105.  A trip to the single-occupancy restroom typically takes Sarah 4-6 minutes \nfrom her classrooms, and on occasions she has to wait for others to use the restroom, \nextending the time that she is out of the classroom.  On most trips, Sarah passes three \nmultiple occupancy girls’ restrooms.  It takes longer for Sarah to get  to the single-\noccupancy  restroom  during  her  four-minute  passing  periods  because  there  are  other \nstudents in the hallway; therefore, she can only use the restroom during class time.  This \nhas led to Sarah missing parts of class.  \n106.   Despite all teachers being notified that Sarah has to use the single-occupancy \nrestroom, a teacher has already complained about the length of time it takes Sarah to use \nthe restroom.  The teacher stated that Sarah’s restroom trip took too long and that in the \nfuture she has three minutes to use the restroom.  A trip from that specific classroom to the \nsingle-occupancy restroom is impossible for Sarah to make in under three minutes.  \n107.  By excluding Sarah from the girls’ restroom, ICMS treats her differently than \nall of her girl classmates.  This has already had a negative impact on Sarah and Sarah’s \n29 \n \n\n     \nparents fear that this will harm her wellbeing.  The policy also puts Sarah at risk of the \ndisclosure that she is transgender and significantly disrupts Sarah’s education by forcing \nher to choose between disruptive physical discomfort and missing extended periods of \nclass. \n108.  Sarah is upset because her exclusion from the girls’ restroom treats her \ndifferently than every other girl at school and because it takes away from her opportunity \nto learn at school for no good reason.  All she wants is to use the restroom that makes sense \nfor her to use because of whom she knows herself to be and because of how she appears to \nothers, just like every other student. \nV.    Oklahoma Public Charter Schools and the HICD Charter With Significant \nAssistance By, and Entwinement With, Defendants OSDE and OKCPS.  \n109.  As required by the Oklahoma Charter School Act (“OCSA”), Okla. Stat. tit. \n70, § 3-130 et seq., HICD and/or Families for Excellence in Education, Inc. filed an \napplication with Defendant OKCPS to operate ICMS as a public charter school.  ICMS has \nbeen sponsored by OKCPS since its inception in approximately 2000.   \n110.  OKCPS renewed its charter sponsorship of ICMS in 2021.  ICMS is currently \noperating under the charter contract between OKCPS and HICD with a term of July 1, \n2021, through June 30, 2026 (hereinafter, “Charter Contract”). \n111.  The OCSA authorizes students like Plaintiff Sarah Stiles to attend a public \ncharter school.  Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § 3-140.  Sarah was admitted to ICMS after being \nselected for admission pursuant to standards and procedures established by the OCSA.  The \n30 \n \n\n     \nOCSA and the Charter Contract are intended to benefit students attending ICMS, like \nSarah. \n112.  The OCSA prohibits charter schools, including ICMS, from charging tuition \nor fees.  Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § 3-136(A)(10);  see also id. at § 3-135(A)(9) (requiring \ncontractual provision that charter schools must “be as equally free and open to all students \nas traditional public schools”).  Therefore, students like Sarah are provided a free education \nat ICMS without tuition or fees.  Additionally, charter schools must be nonsectarian.  Okla. \nStat. tit. 70, § 3-136(A)(2). \n113.  The OCSA provides that charter schools are public schools within the public \nschool system of Oklahoma. Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § 1-106; see also Charter Contract, Art. IV, \n4.2 (stating that ICMS “shall be deemed a public school….”).  Like other public schools, \nICMS must comply with the Oklahoma Open Meeting Act and the Oklahoma Open \nRecords Act.  Id., at 4.4. \n114.  The  OCSA  provides  that  public  funds  be  allocated  to  charter  schools, \nincluding HICD, from funds otherwise allocated to the local school district in accordance \nwith a statutorily-established formula.  Okla. Stat. tit. 70, §§ 3-142.  The allocation is non-\ndiscretionary. \n115.  The  OCSA,  with  limited  exceptions  not  applicable  here,  prohibits \ndiscriminating against any student in admission on the basis of “ethnicity, national origin, \ngender, income level, disabling condition, proficiency in the English language, measures \nof achievement, aptitude, or athletic ability.”  Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § 3-140(D). \n31 \n \n\n     \n116.  State law establishes standards regulating student assessment, proficiency, \nand promotion standards.  See, e.g., Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § 11-103.6. State standards apply to \nHICD public charter  schools, including  ICMS.   Charter Contract,  Art. V, 5.2 (“The \nSchool’s educational program shall meet current Oklahoma Academic Standards, as set by \nstate statutes or the Oklahoma State Department of Education.”)  If HICD students fail to \nmeet academic performance criteria established by the SBOE, Defendant HICD may lose \nthe charter for ICMS.  \n117.  The SBOE issues a “School Report Card” for ICMS, as it does for all other \nOklahoma public schools. \n118.  The OCSA empowers HICD to discipline students, specifically mandating \nthat it shall comply with student suspension requirements in Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § 24-101.3.  \nPolicies adopted by HICD governing student conduct must be consistent with the United \nStates and Oklahoma Constitutions. \n119.  The Charter Contract requires compliance with “all applicable provisions of \nlocal, state and federal law and regulation, specifically including but not limited to health \nand safety, civil rights… except to the extent such provisions are inapplicable to charter \nschool….”  Charter Contract, Art. IV, 4.2; see also Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § 3-136(A)(1).  SB \n615  is  expressly  applicable  to  charter  schools,  placing  federal  law  in  conflict  with \nOklahoma state law. \n120.  OKCPS may terminate the Charter Contract during the term of the contract \n“for violations of the law.”  Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § 3-137(C); OKCPS Policy I-22(12.1).  In \naddition, the Charter Contract, after process specified therein, provides for “[p]robation, \n32 \n \n\n     \ntermination or nonrenewal” if OKCPS “has reason to believe [ICMS] has failed to meet or \nviolated any provision of state or federal law.”  Charter Contract, Art. VII, 7.1. \n121.  OKCPS has entered into one or more lease agreements with Families for \nExcellence in Education, Inc. and/or HICD for operation of a charter school authorized by \nOKCPS, including but not limited to the real property used for the operation of ICMS.  In \n2021, the charter school lease agreement applicable to real property used for the operation \nof ICMS was “amended to reflect the change in name” replacing Families for Excellence \nin Education, Inc. with HICD as the tenant. \n122.  HICD  is  under  the  general  direction  and  control  of  the  SBOE  and  is \nfinancially dependent on OSDE support.  \n123.  At all relevant times, HICD’s conduct causing the deprivation of Sarah \nStiles’ federal rights is also fairly attributable to the State.  The State’s exercise of “coercive \npower” or “significant encouragement” of SB 615, the SBOE Emergency Rules, the OCSA \nand  other  state  education  laws,  the  Charter  Contract,  or  any  combination  thereof, \ndemonstrates a sufficiently close nexus between HICD and the State.  In addition, the \nprovision of a free, uniform public education has been the traditional and exclusive \nfunction of the State of Oklahoma.  Defendant HICD is also pervasively entwined with \nOKCPS and/or OSDE. \n124.  For purposes of claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Defendant HICD deprived \nPlaintiff Sarah Stiles of equal protection, and HICD has acted and continues to act under \ncolor of state law. \n \n33 \n \n\n     \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF  \nCOUNT I \nDenial of Equal Protection \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n(Against Defendants State Superintendent, Appointed Board Members and \nOAG, in their Official Capacities, as well as Defendants NPS, MPS, and HICD) \n \n125.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 124 as \nthough fully set forth herein.  \n126.  Plaintiffs  bring  this  Count  against  Defendants  State  Superintendent  Joy \nHofmeister, the Appointed Board Members (Bradley, Monies, Hernandez, Bobek, Smith, \nand Lepak), and Attorney General O’Connor in their respective official capacities. \n127.  Plaintiff Andy Bridge brings this Count against Defendant Noble Public \nSchools.  Plaintiff Mark Miles brings this Count against Defendant Moore Public Schools.  \nPlaintiff Sarah Stiles brings this Count against Defendants Harding Independent Charter \nDistrict, Inc. \n128.  Plaintiffs state this cause of action against all Defendants sued in this Count \nfor purposes of seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and nominal damages (except that \nPlaintiffs do not seek damages from defendants sued in their official capacities), and \nchallenge Defendants’ respective policies under SB 615 of excluding students who are \ntransgender from the multiple occupancy facilities at their schools that align with their \ngender, both facially and as applied to them. \n129.  Each of the Defendants sued in this Count is a person acting under color of \nstate law for purposes of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  \n34 \n \n\n     \n130.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, enforceable pursuant \nto 42 U.S.C. § 1983, provides that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction \nthe equal protection of the laws.  \n131.  Defendants’ exclusion of students who are transgender, including Plaintiffs, \nfrom the multiple occupancy facilities aligned with their gender treats students who are \ntransgender  differently  from  similarly-situated  students  who  happen  to  be  cisgender.  \nUnder Defendants’ discriminatory policies, students who are cisgender are able to use \nmultiple occupancy facilities consistent with their gender, but students who are transgender \nare banned from multiple occupancy facilities consistent with their gender.  \n132.  Discrimination based on Sex:  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth  Amendment  to  the  U.S.  Constitution,  discrimination  based  on  sex  is \npresumptively unconstitutional and subject to heightened scrutiny. \na.  Discrimination based on sex includes, but is not limited to, discrimination \nbased on transgender status, gender nonconformity, sex stereotyping, gender expression, \nand gender transition.  \nb.  Defendants’ exclusion of Plaintiffs from multiple occupancy facilities that \nalign with their gender discriminates against them on the basis of sex.  \nc.  Defendants’ respective policies discriminate against Plaintiffs based on their \ntransgender status by treating them differently from similarly-situated students who happen \nto be cisgender. \nd.  Defendants’ policy also discriminates against Plaintiffs based on gender \nnonconformity and sex stereotyping by treating them differently from other students based \n35 \n \n\n     \non  assumptions  derived  from  Plaintiffs’  sex  assigned  at  birth  and/or  derived  from \nPlaintiffs’ genetics and/or physiology. \n133.  Discrimination based on Transgender Status:  Under the Equal Protection \nClause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  discrimination  based  on  transgender  status  is \npresumptively unconstitutional and subject to strict, or at least heightened, scrutiny. \na.  People  who  are  transgender  have  suffered  a  long  history  of  extreme \ndiscrimination  in  Oklahoma  and  across  the  country  and  continue  to  suffer  such \ndiscrimination to this day.  This year alone, Oklahoma has passed three laws targeting \npeople who are transgender.  Across the country, more than 140 bills targeting transgender \nyouth were introduced in 2022 alone and at least 30 laws targeting people who are \ntransgender have been enacted by states in just the last two years.  People who are \ntransgender are a discrete and insular group and lack the political power to protect their \nrights through the legislative process.  People who are transgender have largely been unable \nto secure explicit statutory protections against discrimination.  \nb.  A  person’s  gender  identity  or  transgender  status  bears  no  relation  to  a \nperson’s ability to contribute to society.  \nc.  Gender identity is generally fixed at an early age and highly resistant to \nchange through intervention.  \n134.  Defendants’ discrimination against Plaintiffs is  not  narrowly tailored or \nsubstantially  related  to  furthering  any  compelling  or  important  government  interest.  \nIndeed, it is not even rationally related to any legitimate government interest.  SB 615 and \nDefendants’ respective policies do not promote the safety or privacy of students or any \n36 \n \n\n     \nother valid governmental interest.  They do, however, undermine the health, safety, and \nprivacy of Plaintiffs, who are publicly marked as different and inferior each and every time \nthey are denied access to facilities available to their peers who happen to be cisgender.  \n135.  SB 615 deprives Plaintiffs and students who are transgender like them of \ntheir rights to equal dignity, liberty, and autonomy by branding them as second-class \ncitizens.  Defendants thus have denied and continue to deny Plaintiffs equal protection of \nthe laws in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n136.  As a result, Plaintiffs have been irreparably harmed by Defendants’ unlawful \nconduct, including their enforcement of SB 615 and their respective policies (including \ndiscipline policies), practices, and actions and are therefore entitled to declaratory and \ninjunctive relief, as well as nominal damages as specified. \nCOUNT II \n \nViolation of Title IX \n20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. \n \n(Against Defendants OSDE, NPS, MPS, HICD, and OKCPS) \n \n137.   Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 124 as \nthough fully set forth herein.  \n138.  Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of \nsex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination  under  any  education  program  or  activity  receiving  Federal  financial \nassistance.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n37 \n \n\n     \n139.  Plaintiffs bring this Count against Defendant Oklahoma State Department of \nEducation, which is a recipient of Federal financial assistance and not immune “under the \nEleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States from suit in Federal court \nfor a [Title IX] violation.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7(a)(1). \n140.  Plaintiff Andy Bridge brings this Count against Defendant Noble Public \nSchools.  Plaintiff Mark Miles brings this Count against Defendant Moore Public Schools.  \nPlaintiff Sarah Stiles brings this Count against Defendants Harding Independent Charter \nDistrict, Inc. and Oklahoma City Public Schools. \n141.  The LEA Defendants are recipients of Federal financial assistance.  \n142.  Under Title IX, discrimination “on the basis of sex” includes, but is not \nlimited to, discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, gender identity, and transgender \nstatus.  By definition, a person who is transgender is someone who lives and identifies with \na sex different than the sex assigned to the person at birth. \n143.  SB 615, the SBOE Emergency  Rules,  and  each of the  respective LEA \nDefendants’ disciplinary policies, procedures, or practices discriminate against Plaintiffs \nand other Oklahoma public school and public charter school students who are transgender \n“on the basis of sex” by singling them out for different treatment from students who are \ncisgender, and by preventing Plaintiffs and other Oklahoma public school and public \ncharter  school  students  who  are  transgender  from  accessing  the  multiple  occupancy \nfacilities that align with their gender, in violation of their rights under Title IX. \n144.  In addition, Title IX regulations, at § 106.31(b)(6), state in relevant part that \n“a recipient shall not … aid or perpetuate discrimination against any person by providing \n38 \n \n\n     \nsignificant assistance to any agency, organization, or person which discriminates on the \nbasis of sex in providing any aid, benefit or service to students.” \n145.  Independent from the discriminatory treatment allegations above, Defendant \nOklahoma State Department of Education also is aiding and perpetuating discrimination \nagainst all Plaintiffs in violation of Title IX, by providing significant assistance to the LEA \nDefendants, including through, inter alia, a substantial relationship between OSDE and \neach of the LEA Defendants; state aid (or reduction thereof), including aid contingent upon \nadherence to and enforcement of SB 615; and, education programs or activities by the LEA \nDefendants that relate so closely to OSDE that they fairly should be considered education \nprograms or activities of OSDE itself. \n146.  Defendant  Oklahoma  City  Public  Schools  is  aiding  and  perpetuating \ndiscrimination against Plaintiff Stiles in violation of Title IX, by providing significant \nassistance to Defendant HICD, including though, inter alia, financial support (e.g., state \naid and other payments), the provision of tangible resources (e.g., facilities and equipment), \nintangible benefits (e.g., charter sponsorship and recognition), and a regular and long-term \nrelationship with HICD. \n147.  Plaintiffs are, and will continue to be, irreparably harmed by OSDE and the \nLEA Defendants’ unlawful conduct, including their enforcement of SB 615 and their \nrespective policies (including discipline policies), practices, actions, and/or significant \nassistance, all in violation of Title IX.  Plaintiffs therefore are entitled to declaratory and \ninjunctive relief, as well as nominal damages as specified. \n \n39 \n \n\n     \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enter judgment in each \nof their favor and against Defendants, as follows: \nA. Enter a declaratory judgment against the Defendants sued in Count I of this \nComplaint finding that the provisions of and enforcement by Defendants of Okla. Stat. tit. \n70,  §  1-125,  Okla.

Enter a declaratory judgment against the Defendants sued in Count II of this \nComplaint finding that the provisions of and enforcement by Defendants of Okla. Stat. tit. \n70,  §  1-125,  Okla.  Admin.  Code  210:35-3-186(h),  and  LEA  Defendants’  respective \ndiscipline policies as discussed above violate Plaintiffs’ rights under Title IX; \nC. Issue preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining enforcement by all \nDefendants of Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § 1-125, Okla. Admin. Code 210:35-3-186(h), and any \nother law, custom, or policy (including LEA Defendants’ respective discipline policies) \nthat  prohibit  (i)  Plaintiffs  from  using  multiple  occupancies  restrooms  and  changing \nfacilities located in public school and public charter school buildings that correspond with \neach Plaintiff’s respective gender identity, rather than the gender assigned to them at birth; \nand (ii) any students, including those who are transgender, from using multiple occupancy \nfacilities that are in accordance with their gender identity;  \nD. Issue preliminary and permanent injunctive relief requiring Defendants to permit \n(i) Plaintiffs to use multiple occupancies restrooms and changing facilities located in public \n40 \n \n\n     \nschool and public charter school buildings that correspond with each Plaintiff’s respective \ngender identity, notwithstanding the provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § 1-125, Okla. Admin. \nCode 210:35-3-186(h), or any other law, custom or policy (including LEA Defendants’ \nrespective discipline policies) that provide otherwise; and (ii) any students, including those \nwho are transgender, from using multiple occupancy facilities that are in accordance with \ntheir gender identity, notwithstanding the provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § 1-125, Okla. \nAdmin.  Code  210:35-3-186(h),  or  any  other  law,  custom  or  policy  (including  LEA \nDefendants’ respective discipline policies) that provide otherwise; \nE. Award each Plaintiff, by and through their next friends, against the Defendants \nOklahoma State Department of Education, Noble Public Schools, Moore Public Schools, \nHarding Independent Charter District, Inc., and Oklahoma City Public Schools nominal \ndamages in the amount of $1.00 for violation of each Plaintiff’s rights under the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution and/or Title IX; \nF. Award Plaintiffs their costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys’ fees pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1988 and other applicable laws; and \nG. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. \nH. The declaratory and injunctive relief requested in this action is sought against \neach Defendant and their successors; against each Defendant’s officers, board members, \nemployees, and agents; and against all persons acting in active concert or participation with \nany Defendant or under any Defendant’s supervision, direction, or control. \n \n \n41 \n \n\n     \nJURY DEMAND \n \nPlaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury of all issues so triable pursuant to Rule 38 \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nDated: September 6, 2022 \n  Respectfully submitted, \n/s/ Megan Lambert \nMegan Lambert \n \nJon W.

My name is Andrew Bridge, although I have not yet petitioned for a \nchange of name through a guardian or next friend.  I typically go by “Andy.”  I am a \nplaintiff in the above-captioned action.  I make this declaration of my own personal \nknowledge, and, if called as a witness, I could and would testify competently to the \nmatters stated herein. \n2.  I am 16 years old.  I reside in Oklahoma with my mother, Aysha \nBridge;  father,  Eli  Bridge;  and  older  brother,  Oliver  Bridge.    My  parents  are \nbiologists, and we also have two dogs, three cats, and several chickens and goats that \nlive with us or in our yard. \n3.  I am a registered student at Noble High School, which is part of the \nNoble Public Schools (“NPS”) in Noble, Oklahoma.  I began my senior year on \nAugust 10, 2022.   \n \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 24-1   Filed 09/29/22   Page 3 of 7\n4.  A photograph of me taken earlier this year is below. \n \n \n5.  I am an honor student.  My academic record is extremely important \nto me.  I am on the Varsity team in the Academic Bowl, where I have competed \ninterscholastically throughout my high school career.   \n6.  After high school, my plans are to attend a four-year university to \nstudy Psychology.  Ultimately, I would like to be either a clinical psychologist or \npsychiatrist.  \n7.  I love to paint and read in my free time.  I also worked part-time in a \nrestaurant, but I recently left to focus on my course load at school.  \n8.  I am a boy.  \n9.  I am also transgender.   \n10.  When I was born, my sex was designated as “female” on my birth \ncertificate, even though I am a boy. \n11.   At the onset of puberty, I started to feel uncomfortable with my \nbody.  After many discussions with my therapist, physician, and supportive friends \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 24-1   Filed 09/29/22   Page 4 of 7\nin addition to extensive reading and thinking about my gender identity, I felt ready to \ncome out to my family as transgender.  \n12.  During the summer of 2020, I came out to my mother as being a boy.  \nMy mother was not surprised that I was a boy and was immediately accepting and \nsupportive of me.  Next, I came out to my brother and father who both also were \nsupportive of me. \n13.  After informing my family, with their support, I began taking steps \ntowards aligning my lived experience with my gender.  I cut my hair short and began \nwearing more masculine clothing.  I also informed close friends of my name and \npronouns.  \n14.  Each gradual step of my transition brought me a sense of relief and \nhappiness, and I felt like I was finally starting to live the way I was meant to live.  This \nconfirmed  for  me  that  transitioning  was  the  only  way  I  would  ever  feel  fully \ncomfortable in my own skin. \n15.  I have since been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, and that diagnosis \nhas been confirmed by multiple healthcare providers. \n16.  I began pursuing medical treatment for gender dysphoria in June \n2021 at Oklahoma Children’s Hospital Adolescent Medicine Clinic (“OU Health”).  \nI have been under the care of health care professionals at OU Health since May 2018 \nafter I was referred there by my primary care physician.  \n17.  During my junior year at Noble High School in August 2021, I was \nliving as my authentic self, meaning as the boy that I am.  The school changed my \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 24-1   Filed 09/29/22   Page 5 of 7\nname on my school records where possible and teachers were informed that I use \nmale pronouns.  We also spoke to the assistant principal who was supportive. \n18.  At school, I am generally perceived by students and staff alike as a boy.  \nMy peers and my teachers generally used male pronouns to refer to me, and generally \ntreated me as the boy I am in every respect.   \n19.   I consistently used the boys’ restrooms at school for the entire 2021-\n2022 school year with the knowledge and support of school administration.  I knew \nthat I belonged in the boys’ restroom, so I simply used the boys’ restrooms along with \nall the other boys.   I always used one of the stalls, as I continue to do in every other \nsetting where I use male restrooms. \n20.  During my junior year, there was only one issue involving a small \ngroup of students who are known to bully and harass other students.  That small group \nmade a complaint to the assistant principal.  This was quickly resolved by the \nassistant principal who allowed me to continue to use the boys’ restrooms but also \ngave me the option to use a single occupancy restroom in the front office.  \n21.  My mother made me aware of SB 615.  I was very upset when it \npassed because it implies that transgender students are unfit to share a communal \nspace with others – as if we are dangerous or perverted. \n22.  Before this school year started, my mother and I spoke with the vice \nprincipal and principal of my school regarding the school district’s restroom policy.  \nThe principals called a district-level administrator who stated that the NPS’s policy \nis that transgender students would have a single occupancy restroom made available \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 24-1   Filed 09/29/22   Page 6 of 7\nto them, and if there was a complaint about a transgender student using the “wrong” \nrestroom (that is, a multiple occupancy restroom used by students of the same \ngender), they would be counseled to use other restrooms.  I was also told that if I \ncontinued to use the boys’ restroom after being counseled, I would be subject to \ndiscipline.  At the end of the conversation, both my mother and I made it clear that I \nplanned to continue using the boys’ restroom at school \n23.   Since I began my senior year in August 2022.  I have continued to \nuse the boys’ restroom at my school.  I have done so without incident. I either use the \nboys’  restroom  between  classes  or  return  home  during  extended  breaks  in  my \nschedule to use the restroom at home. \n24.  The only single occupancy restroom at my school that I am aware of \nthat is not a faculty restroom is the restroom located in the front office.  It would be \nout of the way of my class schedule to use that restroom.  Additionally, being forced \nto use this restroom would make me feel singled out and stigmatized, as if there is \nsomething wrong with me that means I should not use the same restroom as the other \nboys at my school.  \n25.  Throughout the years, I have seen anti-transgender bills across the \ncountry and have found it very disheartening that politicians would target people like \nme.  Now with the Oklahoma legislature choosing to make the lives of transgender \npeople, like myself, more difficult, I no longer feel safe and welcome in the only \nplace I have ever called home. \n \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 24-1   Filed 09/29/22   Page 7 of 7",

[Doc. No. 64]. Pursuant to LCvR7.1(g), the Court set this \nmatter for expedited briefing. Order [Doc. No. 65]. Plaintiffs responded in opposition. \n[Doc. No. 66]. The matter is fully briefed and at issue. \nState Defendants ask the Court to strike affidavits attached to Plaintiffs’ Reply in \nsupport of the Motion for Preliminary Injunction [Doc. No. 62]. Those include a \nsupplemental affidavit by Sue Stiles, a parent of Plaintiff Sarah Stiles, [Doc. No. 62-1], a \nsupplemental affidavit by Dr. Stephanie Budge [Doc. No. 62-2], and two affidavits \n \n1 State Defendants mean (1) Oklahoma State Department of Education, (2) Joy \nHofmeister, in her official capacity as the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, (3)–\n(8) Carlisha Bradley, Jennifer Monies, Estela Hernandez, Brian Bobek, Trent Smith, and \nSarah Lepak, all in their official capacities as members of the Oklahoma Board of \nEducation, and (9) John O’Connor, in his official capacity as Oklahoma Attorney \nGeneral.   \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 67   Filed 12/20/22   Page 2 of 5\nsubmitted by witnesses in cases before other courts [Doc. No. 62-3]. Alternatively, State \nDefendants seek leave to submit a surreply in response to these materials.  \nThis lawsuit concerns the enactment of Senate Bill 615 by the Oklahoma \nLegislature. S.B. 615, codified at Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § 1-125, mandates that public and \ncharter schools “require every multiple occupancy restroom or changing area” to be \ndesignated “for the exclusive use of” the male or female sex, which is defined by the \nstatute as “the physical condition of being male or female based on genetics and \nphysiology, as identified on the individual’s original birth certificate.” The statute states \nthat it is meant “[t]o ensure privacy and safety.” Id. § 1-125(B). \nPlaintiffs argue in their Motion for Preliminary Injunction that S.B. 615 causes \nthem irreparable harm as an infringement on their constitutional and statutory rights and \nbecause it results in shame, stigma, and invalidation. Plaintiffs each submitted affidavits \nexplaining how S.B. 615 harms them. State Defendants responded, arguing that \n“complaints of experiencing feelings of shame, stigma, marginalization, emotional \ndistress, and the like from using the single-occupancy accommodation restroom are \nspeculative and insufficient to establish irreparable harm.” Response to the Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction [Doc. No. 54] at 26. Plaintiffs then attached to their reply a \nsupplemental affidavit by Sue Stiles, which describes an event that occurred after she \nexecuted her initial affidavit relating to her claim that S.B. 615 harms Plaintiff Sarah \nStiles.  \nIn her affidavit attached to the Motion for Preliminary Injunction [Doc. No. 24], \nDr. Budge explains that “excluding students from facilities consistent with their gender \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 67   Filed 12/20/22   Page 3 of 5\nidentity” causes them harm. [Doc. No. 24-7 at ¶¶ 54–68]. She also explains that “the \nevidence does not support” the contention that “transgender people are a threat to the \nsafety of other people when they use restrooms that do not correspond to the sex they \nwere assigned at birth.” Id. at ¶ 69. State Defendants responded, arguing in support of the \nprivacy and safety rationales for S.B. 615. With their response, State Defendants also \nsubmitted affidavits by two witnesses who challenge Dr. Budge’s opinions: Dr. Debra \nSoh and Dr. James Cantor. [Doc. Nos. 54-5, 54-6]. Plaintiffs then attached to their reply a \nsupplemental affidavit by Dr. Budge [Doc. No. 62-2], which in turn attacks the \nqualifications of Dr. Soh and Dr. Cantor along with their opinions. \nFinally, in support of their argument that S.B. 615 has no compelling, important, \nor legitimate government interest, Plaintiffs attached to their reply two affidavits \nsubmitted in other cases before other courts. [Doc. No. 62-3]. According to the reply, \nthese declarations by “law enforcement officials” also explain that there is no evidence \nsupporting the contention that a government interest in safety is furthered by laws like \nS.B. 615. [Doc. No. 62 at 19]. \nIn the Motion before the Court, State Defendants ask the Court to strike all or \nsome of these affidavits. As authority for this request, they cite to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 6(c)(2), which requires that “[a]ny affidavit supporting a motion must be \nserved with the motion.” They also point to cases stating that courts disfavor new \narguments and evidence in a reply brief. Motion at 2.  \nThe Court agrees with State Defendants that reply briefs should not raise new \narguments or present evidence on new matters. Local Civil Rule 7.1(i) clearly \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 67   Filed 12/20/22   Page 4 of 5\ncontemplates that reply briefs should be limited to responding to arguments asserted in a \nresponse brief. Typically, courts either permit a non-movant to respond to new matters \nraised in a reply brief or disregard the new matters in the ultimate decision on the motion. \nSee Pippin v. Burlington Res. Oil & Gas Co., 440 F.3d 1186, 1192 (10th Cir. 2006). \nEach of the affidavits submitted with Plaintiffs’ reply brief includes something \nnew. The affidavit submitted by Sue Stiles is evidence of a new incident that is not \nincluded in Plaintiffs’ initial motion materials, the supplemental affidavit by Dr. Budge \nraises new issues, and the two affidavits submitted in other cases before other courts are \nclearly new to this case. These materials all generally relate to issues and arguments \nraised by Plaintiffs in the initial motion, but they are new materials to which State \nDefendants have not been afforded an opportunity to respond. \nRather than striking them or disregarding them in the Court’s ultimate decision on \nthe Motion for Preliminary Injunction [Doc. No. 24], the Court finds that the better \nsolution is to permit State Defendants to submit a limited surreply that raises no new \nissues and responds only to the new matters in the reply brief identified by State \nDefendants in the Motion. \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that State Defendants’ Motion to Strike \nPlaintiffs’ Reply Affidavits in Support of Motion for Preliminary Injunction or, in the \nAlternative, Motion to File Surreply [Doc. No. 64] is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED \nIN PART. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that State Defendants may file a limited surreply as \nset forth herein by Friday, January 6, 2023. The surreply shall not exceed 20 pages. \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:22-cv-00787-JD   Document 67   Filed 12/20/22   Page 5 of 5\nIT IS SO ORDERED this 20th day of December 2022. \n \n           \n   \n \n \n5 \n ",
