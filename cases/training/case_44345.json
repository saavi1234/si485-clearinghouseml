The plaintiff was represented by private counsel.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />The plaintiff alleged that the Baton Rouge Police Department maintained a policy and/or practice of strip-searching individuals who had not been arrested. They alleged that the defendants strip searched individuals prior to establishing probable cause to bring criminal charges and do so to serve the purpose of obtaining evidence to be used against the individual.</p>\r\n<p>On February 21, 2024, the court held the first scheduling conference, during which the parties discussed their failure to file a timely joint status report. The court scheduled another conference for March 20, 2024, and directed the plaintiff to file an amended complaint, which was filed on March 22, 2024.

Strip searches are a uniquely invasive tactic, and it is used by Baton Rouge officers to \nhumiliate, denigrate, and intimidate individuals. It is clearly established that Baton Rouge Police \nDepartment’s strip search policy and/ or practice violate the Fourth Amendment.  \n  Bobby Hardnett brings this action on behalf of himself and on behalf of a class of \nnumerous others who were strip searched by the Baton Rouge Police Department who without \nprobable cause or individualized reasonable suspicion, to vindicate their clearly established \n\nCase 3:23-cv-01393-BAJ-SDJ     Document 26    03/22/24   Page 2 of 10\nconstitutional rights. Plaintiff seeks monetary damages for himself and each member of the \nproposed class, a declaration that the Baton Rouge Police Departments strip-search policies \nand/ or practices are unconstitutional, and an injunction precluding the Baton Rouge Police \nDepartment from continuing to systematically violate the rights of those taken into their \ncustody. Wherefore, Plaintiff complains as follows: \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE  \n1.  Jurisdiction exists in this Honorable Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 \nbecause it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive damages, and injunctive \nrelief to redress the deprivation of rights secured by the Fourth Amendment of the \nUnited States Constitution, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   \n2.  Jurisdiction also exists pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 because it is filed to obtain \ndeclaratory relief relative to the constitutionality of the policies and/ or practices of a \nmunicipal government.   \n3.  Venue is proper in this Honorable Court under 28 U.S.C. § 2201 because the events \ngiving rise to Plaintiff’s claim and the claims of the proposed class occurred in the Middle \nDistrict of Louisiana.  \nPARTIES \n4.  Plaintiff Bobby Hardnett (“Hardnett”) is an adult resident of the State of Louisiana. In \nJanuary of 2023 he was taken into custody by a Baton Rouge police officer, taken to a \npolice building, and strip-searched without probable cause or individualized reasonable \nsuspicion that he was in possession of a weapon or other contraband.  The strip search \ndid not produce any evidence of criminal activity and Hardnett was released without \nbeing charged with a crime.   \n\nCase 3:23-cv-01393-BAJ-SDJ     Document 26    03/22/24   Page 3 of 10\n5.  Defendant City of Baton Rouge- Parish of East Baton Rouge is a local government entity \nand body being a political subdivision of the State of Louisiana, is responsible for the \ncustoms, practices, and policies, supervision, training, and discipline of the Baton Rouge \nPolice Department.  At all times relative hereto, City of Baton Rouge was responsible for \npolice officers’ actions conducted in the course and scope of their employment.  \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \nIN SUPPORT OF CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n6.  Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated individuals who \nwere strip searched by Baton Rouge Police Officers without probable cause or \nindividualized reasonable suspicion.  \n7.  The class that Plaintiff seeks to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been or will be taken into the custody of the \nBaton Rouge Police Department and were or will be strip searched \nby Baton Rouge Police Officers without probable cause  or \nindividualized reasonable suspicion, pursuant to the policy and/ or \npractice of the Baton Rouge Police Department  The class period \ncommences on September 29, 2020 and extends to the present or \nuntil the defendants are enjoined from, or otherwise cease, their \nunconstitutional policy and/ or practice of conducting strip \nsearches absent probable cause  or individualized reasonable \nsuspicion. Specifically excluded from the class are Defendants and \nany and all of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, \nsuccessors, employees or assignees. \n \n8.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action under \nFederal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n9.  The numerous members render joinder impracticable. Upon information and belief, there \nare hundreds of individuals who were taken into custody by the Baton Rouge Police \n\nCase 3:23-cv-01393-BAJ-SDJ     Document 26    03/22/24   Page 4 of 10\nDepartment and strip searched without probable cause or individualized Reasonable \nSuspicion- all of whom are members of the proposed class.  \n10. Upon information and belief, joinder of all of these individuals is impracticable because \nof the large number of class members and the potential that some members presently \nresiding outside of this Judicial District. Furthermore, upon information and belief, many \nmembers of the class, having been denigrated and humiliated by defendants, are likely \nhesitant to pursue their rights individually. \n11.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in that they all had \ntheir right to be free from invasive strip searches absent probable cause or individualized \nreasonable suspicion. All members of the class were or will be strip searched in violation \nof the clearly established law in the Fifth Circuit.  \n12. Plaintiff's  claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class.  Plaintiff and \nall members of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendant’s policy and/ or \npractice of strip-searching individuals without probable cause or individualized \nsuspicion. The harm suffered by Plaintiff is typical of the harms suffered by the class \nmembers. \n13. This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. As such, the Plaintiff seeks \nclass certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members were subject to \nthe same Baton Rouge Police Department policy and/ or practice of strip-searching \nindividuals without probable cause or individualized suspicion. Baton Rouge acted on \ngrounds generally applicable to all class members. \n14. In addition to certification under Rule 23(b)(2), and in the alternative, Plaintiff seeks \ncertification under Rule 23(b)(3). \n15. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the class and predominate \n\nCase 3:23-cv-01393-BAJ-SDJ     Document 26    03/22/24   Page 5 of 10\nover any questions that affect only individual members of the Class. These common \nquestions of law and fact include, without limitation, the common and predominate \nquestion of whether the Baton Rouge Police Department’s policy and/ or practice of \nstrip-searching individuals without probable cause or individualized reasonable \nsuspicion is a violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and \nwhether the policy and/ or practice existed during the class period. \n16. A class action is superior to other available methods for fair and efficient adjudication  of \nthis controversy.  Absent  a class action, it would  be economically  impractical for the \nvast majority of the Class members to prosecute individual actions because the \namounts that may be recovered  by individual  Class members would  be insufficient \nin amount  to support separate actions. However, the amounts which may be recovered \nby individual Class members will be large enough  in relation to the expense and \neffort in administering  the action to justify  a class action. Plaintiffs know of no \ndifficulty to be encountered in the management of this action that would preclude its \nmaintenance as a class action. \n17. Upon information and belief, there are no other class actions pending to address the Baton \nRouge Police Department’s policy and/ or practice of strip-searching individuals without \nprobable cause or individualized reasonable suspicion.  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n18. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits strip-searches \nexcept in very limited circumstances because it is uniquely and extremely invasive. \n19. Even when individuals have been formally arrested and incarcerated, strip searches are \nprohibited unless there is probable cause or individualized reasonable suspicion to \n\nCase 3:23-cv-01393-BAJ-SDJ     Document 26    03/22/24   Page 6 of 10\nbelieve that they are in possession of weapons or contraband. \n20. Despite these clearly established prohibitions against strip searching, the Baton Rouge \nPolice Department maintains a policy and/ or practice of strip-searching individuals who \nhave not been arrested in intentionally denigrating circumstances.  \n21. The Baton Rouge Police Department’s strip search policy and/ or practice permits \nofficers to take individuals that they suspect of engaging in criminal activity to police \nproperties throughout Baton Rouge and strip search them prior to establishing probable \ncause to bring criminal charges. \n22. The Baton Rouge Police Department’s strip search policy and/ or practice served the \nillegitimate purpose of attaining evidence against individuals suspected of criminal \nactivity. \n23. Baton Rouge Police Department’s strip search policy and/ or practice served the \nillegitimate purpose of humiliating, denigrating, and intimidating individuals suspected \nof criminal activity. \n24. The officers who created, maintained and executed Baton Rouge Police Department’s \nstrip-search policy had knowledge that the policy violated the Fourth Amendment as the \nFifth Circuit has repeatedly rejected such policies.  \n25. As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip-searches conducted pursuant to \npolicy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches - each member of the class, including \nthe named Plaintiff - has suffered or will suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering \nand mental anguish. \nFacts Applicable to the Bobby Hardnett \n26.  In January 2023 Hardnett was sitting on the front porch of his friend’s apartment.  \n27. Three Baton Rouge Police Officer pulled in front of the building. One of the officers told \n\nCase 3:23-cv-01393-BAJ-SDJ     Document 26    03/22/24   Page 7 of 10\nthe other two officers to “throw his ass in the car”.  \n28. Two officers then approached Hardnett and took him into custody, placing him into a \npolice vehicle. Hardnett was not given any information regarding why he was taken into \ncustody. \n29. Hardnett was taken directly to the back of a police building on Plank Road in Baton \nRouge.  \n30. Baton Rouge Police Officers forced Hardnett to strip naked, bend over, and spread his \nbuttocks while police officers examined his entire body with a flashlight, including his \ngenitals.  \n31. Hardnett remained naked and exposed for approximately 12 minutes. \n32. Hardnett was never informed that he was accused of any specific crime.  \n33. Hardnett’s humiliating ordeal did not produce evidence of any crime.  \n34. However, the strip search had accomplished the officers’ goal.  Hardnett had been \nhumiliated and traumatized by their unconscionable and unconstitutional search.  \n35. Following the strip search, the Baton Rouge Police Officers drove Hardnett back to the \nlocation where they had picked him up.  \n36. Hardnett was never charged with any crime.  \n37. The fact that Hardnett was never charged with a crime lays bare that the strip search he \nsuffered through was not based on probable cause or any other legitimate purpose.  \n38. Hardnett was informed by the officers as they dropped him off that he, and others would \nbe forced to go through the same ordeal again if they saw him. \n39. The implication of the officers’ communication was that they would conduct illegal strip \nsearches on anyone they suspected of criminal behavior, regardless of whether there was \nany evidence to support that suspicion, let alone probable cause to arrest.  \n\nCase 3:23-cv-01393-BAJ-SDJ     Document 26    03/22/24   Page 8 of 10\n40. The unconstitutional strip search that Hardnett experienced has caused ongoing pain, \nsuffering trauma, and mental anguish.  \n41. Hardnett’s mental anguish and anxiety are compounded due to his knowledge that his \nstrip-search was ratified and supported by the law enforcement apparatus that should \nprotect him, not traumatize him.  \nCOUNT I: 42 U.S.C. § 1983 FOURTH AMENDMENT VIOLATION \n42.  Plaintiff hereby incorporates all preceding paragraphs as if fully stated herein.  \n43. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens from \nunreasonable searches by law enforcement officers. \n44. It is clearly established in the 5th Circuit that strip-searches are unreasonable unless \nsupported by probable cause or individualized reasonable suspicion. that an \nindividual has weapons or contraband.  \n45. The Baton Rouge Police Department maintains a policy and/ or practice of strip-\nsearching individuals who have been taken into their custody without probable \ncause or individualized reasonable suspicion. \n46. The Baton Rouge Police Department has knowledge that its strip-search a policy \nand/ or practice is unconstitutional but continues to maintain the policy in order to \nhumiliate, denigrate, and intimidate the individuals who have been taken into \ncustody \n47. The members of the Baton Rouge Police Department who have established, maintained, \nand executed the strip search policy and/ or practice are state actors acting in the course \nand scope of their law enforcement positions.   \n48. As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, Plaintiff \nand members of the proposed class have been irreparably injured. \n\nCase 3:23-cv-01393-BAJ-SDJ     Document 26    03/22/24   Page 9 of 10\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n             Plaintiff Bobby Hardnett on his own behalf of and on behalf of a class of others \nsimilarly situated, requests that this Honorable Court grant the following relief: \nA.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23. \nB.  A judgment against Defendant for Plaintiff's First Cause of Action detailed \nherein, awarding Compensatory and Punitive Damages to the named Plaintiff \nand each member of the proposed class in an amount to be determined by a \nJury and/or the Court on both an individual and a class wide basis. \nC.  A declaratory judgment against Defendant declaring the Baton Rouge Police \nDepartment’s policy and/ or practice of strip-searching individuals who have \nbeen taken into their custody without probable cause or individualized \nreasonable suspicion unconstitutional. \nD.  A preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Defendant from continuing \nto strip-searching individuals who have been taken into their custody \nwithout probable cause or individualized reasonable suspicion. \nE.  A monetary award for attorney’s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1985 and 1988, \nand Fed. R. Civ.

Strip searches are a uniquely invasive tactic, and it is used by Baton Rouge officers to \nhumiliate, denigrate, and intimidate individuals. It is clearly established that Baton Rouge Police \nDepartment’s strip search policy and/ or practice violates the Fourth Amendment.  \n  Bobby Hardnett brings this action on behalf of himself and on behalf of a class of \nnumerous others who were strip-searched by the Baton Rouge Police Department who without \nprobable cause or individualized reasonable suspicion, to vindicate their clearly established \nconstitutional rights. Plaintiff seeks monetary damages for himself and each member of the \n\nCase 3:23-cv-01393-BAJ-SDJ     Document 1    09/29/23   Page 2 of 10\nproposed class, a declaration that the Baton Rouge Police Departments strip-search policy and/ \nor practice is unconstitutional, and an injunction precluding the Baton Rouge Police \nDepartment from continuing to systematically violate the rights of those taken into their \ncustody. Wherefore, Plaintiff complains as follows: \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE  \n1.  Jurisdiction exists in this Honorable Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 \nbecause it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive damages, and injunctive \nrelief to redress the deprivation of rights secured by the Fourth Amendment of the \nUnited States Constitution, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   \n2.  Jurisdiction also exists pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 because it is filed to obtain \ndeclaratory relief relative to the constitutionality of the policy and/ or practice of a \nmunicipal government.   \n3.  Venue is proper in this Honorable Court under 28 U.S.C. § 2201 because the events \ngiving rise to Plaintiff’s claim and the claims of the proposed class occurred in the Middle \nDistrict of Louisiana.  \nPARTIES \n4.  Plaintiff Bobby Hardnett (“Hardnett”) is an adult resident of the State of Louisiana. In \nJanuary of 2023 he was taken into custody by a Baton Rouge police officer, taken to a \npolice building, and strip-searched without probable cause or individualized reasonable \nsuspicion that he was in possession of a weapon or other contraband.  The strip search \ndid not produce any evidence of criminal activity and Hardnett was released without \nbeing charged with a crime.   \n5.  Defendant City of Baton Rouge- Parish of East Baton Rouge is a local government entity \nand body being a political subdivision of the State of Louisiana,  responsible for the \n\nCase 3:23-cv-01393-BAJ-SDJ     Document 1    09/29/23   Page 3 of 10\ncustoms, practices, policies, supervision, training, and discipline of the Baton Rouge \nPolice Department.  At all times relative hereto, City of Baton Rouge- Parish of East \nBaton Rouge was responsible for police officers’ actions conducted in the course and \nscope of their employment.  \n6.  Defendant Murphy Paul is an adult resident of the State of Louisiana and was at all \nrelevant times the Chief of the Baton Rouge Police Department. He is sued in his Official \nCapacity.  \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \nIN SUPPORT OF CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n7.  Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated individuals who \nwere strip-searched by Baton Rouge Police Officers without probable cause or \nindividualized reasonable suspicion.  \n8.  The class that Plaintiff seeks to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been or will be taken into the custody of the \nBaton Rouge Police Department and were or will be strip-searched \nby Baton Rouge Police Officers without probable cause  or \nindividualized reasonable suspicion, pursuant to the policy and/ or \npractice of the Baton Rouge Police Department  The class period \ncommences on September 29, 2020 and extends to the present or \nuntil the Defendants are enjoined from, or otherwise cease, their \nunconstitutional policy and/ or practice of conducting strip \nsearches absent probable cause  or individualized reasonable \nsuspicion. Specifically excluded from the class are Defendants and \nany and all of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, \nsuccessors, employees or assignees. \n \n9.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action under \nFederal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n\nCase 3:23-cv-01393-BAJ-SDJ     Document 1    09/29/23   Page 4 of 10\n10. The numerous members render joinder impracticable. Upon information and belief, there \nare hundreds of individuals who were taken into custody by the Baton Rouge Police \nDepartment and strip searched without probable cause or individualized Reasonable \nSuspicion- all of whom are members of the proposed class.  \n11.  Upon information and belief, joinder of all of these individuals is impracticable because \nof the large number of class members and the potential that some members presently \nresiding outside of this Judicial District. Furthermore, upon information and belief, many \nmembers of the class, having been denigrated and humiliated by defendants, are likely \nhesitant to pursue their rights individually. \n12. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in that they all had \ntheir right to be free from invasive strip searches absent probable cause or individualized \nreasonable suspicion. All members of the class were or will be strip searched in violation \nof the clearly established law in the Fifth Circuit.  \n13. Plaintiff's  claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class.  Plaintiff and \nall members of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendant’s policy and/ or \npractice of strip-searching individuals without probable cause or individualized \nsuspicion. The harm suffered by Plaintiff is typical of the harms suffered by the class \nmembers. \n14. This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. As such, the Plaintiff seeks \nclass certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members were subject to \nthe same Baton Rouge Police Department policy and/ or practice of strip-searching \nindividuals without probable cause or individualized suspicion. Baton Rouge acted on \ngrounds generally applicable to all class members. \n15. In addition to certification under Rule 23(b)(2), and in the alternative, Plaintiff seeks \n\nCase 3:23-cv-01393-BAJ-SDJ     Document 1    09/29/23   Page 5 of 10\ncertification under Rule 23(b)(3). \n16. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the class and predominate \nover any questions that affect only individual members of the Class. These common \nquestions of law and fact include, without limitation, the common and predominate \nquestion of whether the Baton Rouge Police Department’s policy and/ or practice of \nstrip-searching individuals without probable cause or individualized reasonable \nsuspicion is a violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and \nwhether the policy and/ or practice existed during the class period. \n17. A class action is superior to other available methods for fair and efficient adjudication  of \nthis controversy.  Absent  a class action, it would  be economically  impractical for the \nvast majority of the Class members to prosecute individual actions because the \namounts that may be recovered  by individual  Class members would  be insufficient \nin amount  to support separate actions. However, the amounts which may be recovered \nby individual Class members will be large enough  in relation to the expense and \neffort in administering  the action to justify  a class action. Plaintiffs know of no \ndifficulty to be encountered in the management of this action that would preclude its \nmaintenance as a class action. \n18. Upon information and belief, there are no other class actions pending to address the Baton \nRouge Police Department’s policy and/ or practice of strip-searching individuals without \nprobable cause or individualized reasonable suspicion.  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n19. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits strip-searches \nexcept in very limited circumstances because it is uniquely and extremely invasive. \n\nCase 3:23-cv-01393-BAJ-SDJ     Document 1    09/29/23   Page 6 of 10\n20. Even when individuals have been formally arrested and incarcerated, strip searches are \nprohibited unless there is probable cause or individualized reasonable suspicion to \nbelieve that they are in possession of weapons or contraband outside of institutional \nintake.  \n21. Despite these clearly established prohibitions against strip searching, the Baton Rouge \nPolice Department maintains a policy and/ or practice of strip-searching individuals who \nhave not been arrested in intentionally denigrating circumstances.  \n22. The Baton Rouge Police Department’s strip search policy and/ or practice permits \nofficers to take individuals that they suspect of engaging in criminal activity to police \nproperties throughout Baton Rouge and strip search them prior to establishing probable \ncause to bring criminal charges. \n23. The Baton Rouge Police Department’s strip-search policy and/ or practice served the \nillegitimate purpose of attaining evidence against individuals suspected of criminal \nactivity. \n24. Baton Rouge Police Department’s strip-search policy and/ or practice served the \nillegitimate purpose of humiliating, denigrating, and intimidating individuals suspected \nof criminal activity. \n25. The officers who created, maintained and executed Baton Rouge Police Department’s \nstrip-search policy had knowledge that the policy violated the Fourth Amendment as the \nFifth Circuit has repeatedly rejected such policies.  \n26. As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip-searches conducted pursuant to \npolicy, the victims of the unlawful strip-searches  each member of the class, including the \nnamed Plaintiff has suffered or will suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and \nmental anguish. \n\nCase 3:23-cv-01393-BAJ-SDJ     Document 1    09/29/23   Page 7 of 10\nFacts Applicable to the Bobby Hardnett \n27.  In January 2023 Hardnett was sitting on the front porch of his friend’s apartment.  \n28. Three Baton Rouge Police Officer pulled in front of the building. One of the officers told \nthe other two officers to “throw his ass in the car”.  \n29. Two officers then approached Hardnett and took him into custody, placing him into a \npolice vehicle. Hardnett was not given any information regarding why he was taken into \ncustody. \n30. Hardnett was taken directly to the back of a police building on Plank Road in Baton \nRouge.  \n31. Baton Rouge Police Officers forced Hardnett to strip naked, bend over, and spread his \nbuttocks while police officers examined his entire body with a flashlight, including his \ngenitals.  \n32. Hardnett remained naked and exposed for approximately 12 minutes. \n33. Hardnett was never informed that he was accused of any specific crime.  \n34. Hardnett’s humiliating ordeal did not produce evidence of any crime.  \n35. However, the strip search had accomplished the officers’ goal.  Hardnett had been \nhumiliated and traumatized by their unconscionable and unconstitutional search.  \n36. Following the strip search, the Baton Rouge Police Officers drove Hardnett back to the \nlocation where they had picked him up.  \n37. Hardnett was never charged with any crime.  \n38. The fact that Hardnett was never charged with a crime lays bare that the strip search he \nsuffered through was not based on probable cause or any other legitimate purpose.  \n39. Hardnett was informed by the officers as they dropped him off that he, and others would \nbe forced to go through the same ordeal again if they saw him. \n\nCase 3:23-cv-01393-BAJ-SDJ     Document 1    09/29/23   Page 8 of 10\n40. The implication of the officers’ communication was that they would conduct illegal strip \nsearches on anyone they suspected of criminal behavior, regardless of whether there was \nany evidence to support that suspicion, let alone probable cause to arrest.  \n41. The unconstitutional strip search that Hardnett experienced has caused ongoing pain, \nsuffering trauma, and mental anguish.  \n42. Hardnett’s mental anguish and anxiety are compounded due to his knowledge that his \nstrip-search was ratified and supported by the law enforcement apparatus that should \nprotect him, not traumatize him.  \nCOUNT I: 42 U.S.C. § 1983 FOURTH AMENDMENT VIOLATION \n43.
