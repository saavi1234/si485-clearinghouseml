The case was initially assigned to Magistrate Judge Scott T. Varholak. The DOJ brought this lawsuit after issuing a letter of findings of civil rights violations to Colorado Governor Jared Polis on March 3, 2022. The lawsuit alleged that Colorado&rsquo;s Medicaid service system violated Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 12131-12134 (as interpreted in <em>Olmstead v. L.C.</em>, 527 U.S. 581 (1999) and Title II&rsquo;s implementing regulation, 28 C.F.R. pt. 35), by failing to ensure that individuals with disabilities can receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. The DOJ sought a declaratory judgment that Colorado had violated Title II of the ADA and an injunction requiring the state to cease discriminating against covered individuals and take steps to prevent discriminatory practices in the future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The implementing regulations of Title II include an &ldquo;integration mandate,&rdquo; which requires public entities to &ldquo;administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.&rdquo; The DOJ alleged that Colorado&rsquo;s provision of Medicaid to disabled individuals fell short of this standard and amounted to unjustified segregation as defined in Olmstead. The DOJ alleged a number of facts supporting its claim, including:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>That the state failed to maintain sufficient community-based service provider capacity;</li>\r\n<li>That it failed to make its services sufficiently available to qualified individuals;</li>\r\n<li>That it gave preference to nursing facilities over community-based providers with its reimbursement policies; and</li>\r\n<li>That it failed to ensure adequate contingency plans when community-based provider staff miss shifts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The case was reassigned to Judge Philip A. Brimmer and drawn to Magistrate Judge Michael E. Hegarty for non-dispositive matters on October 18, 2023.</p>\r\n<p>On April 11, 2024, Magistrate Judge Hegarty issued an order staying proceedings on the case in light of ongoing settlement discussions through May 24, 2024. On May 24, the stay was extended through July 28. On July 12, 2024, the stay was extended through August 1, 2024.</p>\r\n<p>On October 31, 2024, the parties made a joint motion to dismiss the case and for the court to retain jurisdiction over the settlement agreement. The state agreed to make in-reach counseling available to institutionalized people in the state, including mandatory group counseling sessions to institutionalized people every 6 months, with the aim of helping them make educated choices about where they wish to live. The state also agreed to ensure that each institutionalized person who wishes to live outside of an institutionalized setting has access to a transition coordinator and team to ease their return to their communities. In addition, the state agreed to create a system to identify at-risk population members by June 30, 2025, to connect them with case managers and a transition manager. Finally, the state agreed to administer community-based services to help ease the transition of institutionalized people into their communities and implement a quality assurance and performance improvement system to track how well the settlement is serving target populations. Under the agreement, the state would provide regular reports until June 2028, with a status conference to be held two years into the term of the agreement. Melanie Reeves Miller was chosen as a monitor. The settlement was set to last four years, through October 2028.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Brimmer granted the motion on November 5, 2024, and retained jurisdiction over the settlement agreement.</p>\r\n<p>The case has been administratively closed, though monitoring on the settlement agreement continues.</p>",

INTRODUCTION \nA.  In November 2019, the United States Department of Justice (the “United States”) \ninitiated an investigation under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (the “ADA”), 42 \nU.S.C. § 12101, et seq., and its implementing regulations, into the adequacy of the State of \nColorado’s (the “State”) services for adults with physical disabilities who wish to transition to, or \nremain in, the community. \nB.  On March 3, 2022, the United States issued a Letter of Findings stating that Colorado \ndoes not comply with the integration mandate of Title II of the ADA (the “Letter of Findings”). \nC.  After the Parties did not reach a resolution of those findings, the United States filed suit \nagainst the State on September 29, 2023 in the United States District Court for the District of \nColorado (the “Court”), captioned United States of America v. The State of Colorado, Civil \nAction No. 23-cv-2538 (the “Case”).  \nD.  This Settlement Agreement (the “Agreement”) now resolves the United States’ Letter of \nFindings and the Case. \nE.  The State does not concede the accuracy of any of the statements in the Letter of \nFindings, the Case, or the conclusion that it has violated Title II of the ADA as interpreted by the \nUnited States Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999). This Agreement does not \nserve as an admission by the State that corrective measures are necessary to meet the \nrequirements of the ADA or the Olmstead decision, or that the State is not currently complying \nwith the ADA. The State enters into this Agreement on its own accord and in the best interest of \nthe State, to preserve judicial economy and state resources, and to best serve individuals with \ndisabilities who are Medicaid members or Medicaid eligible. \nF.  The State has cooperated fully with the investigation and has worked collaboratively with \nthe United States to resolve the identified concerns, even though the State disputes many of the \nfindings and conclusions. The Parties agree that it is in their mutual interest to avoid further \nlitigation. \nG.  The United States acknowledges that the State has begun implementing certain \nprovisions of this Agreement before the Effective Date. \nII.  GOVERNING PRINCIPLES \nA.  Individuals with disabilities should have control over where and how they live. They \nshould have the opportunity to live in and engage with the community.  \nB.  Individuals with disabilities should also have the opportunity to make an Educated \nChoice of service setting. \nU.S. v. Colorado, No. 1:23-cv-2538 (D. Colo.)    Page 1 of 32 \nSettlement Agreement  \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538-PAB-MEH     Document 62-1     filed 10/31/24     USDC Colorado \nDocusign Envelope ID: E064C111-FD86-4662-87B3-E15A735B2463 pg 2 of 32\nC.  Individuals with disabilities should receive the services described in this Agreement in an \nindividualized, Person-Centered manner consistent with each individual’s preferences, goals, \nneeds, and abilities, as well as Educated Choice. \nD.  The intended outcomes of this Agreement include increased self-determination, \nindependence, and community integration for the Target Population members, by delivering \ncommunity-based services, considering the needs of other individuals with disabilities. To \nachieve this goal, the State will develop and implement effective measures to prevent \nunnecessary admissions to nursing facilities and to transition nursing facility residents to the \ncommunity when appropriate and unopposed. \nE.  Individuals with disabilities should have access to sufficient affordable, accessible \nhousing and reliable community-based services. \nF.  Individuals with disabilities who reside in institutional settings should be afforded \nopportunities to engage in community activities to ensure an Educated Choice in where they \nchoose to live and receive services.  \nIII.  TARGET POPULATION \nA.  For the purposes of this Agreement, the Target Population consists of individuals with a \nphysical disability over the age of 21 who are either enrolled in Medicaid or presumptively \neligible for Medicaid and have a persistent condition likely requiring the use of State-\nadministered long-term services and supports to live in the Community. The Target Population \nconsists of the following two sub-populations: \n1.  The “At-Risk Population.” Medicaid members or presumptively eligible Medicaid \nmembers who live outside of a nursing facility (including those who have been in a \nnursing facility for 30 days or less) and (a) have received a Level of Care Screening to \naccess Medicaid nursing facility services; or (b) may need nursing facility services as \nidentified by the Case Manager or Care Coordinator; or (c) are otherwise at risk for \ninstitutionalization as the State has determined through the methodology described in \nSection VII(A). \n2.  The “Institutionalized Population.” Medicaid members or presumptively eligible \nMedicaid members living in a nursing facility for more than 30 days who are receiving \nMedicaid-funded nursing facility services. \nB.  An Institutionalized Population member who completes Community Transition as \ndescribed in Section VI will continue to be regarded as a member of the Target Population for the \npurposes of this Agreement. \nC.  The presence of a co-occurring disability (such as mental illness or an intellectual or \ndevelopmental disability) does not exclude an individual with a physical disability from the \nTarget Population. \nD.  An individual is not excluded from the Target Population by virtue of having or lacking \nUnpaid Supports. \nU.S. v. Colorado, No. 1:23-cv-2538 (D. Colo.)

DEFINITIONS \nThis Agreement references the following capitalized defined terms throughout: \nCare Coordinator: A Care Coordinator is an individual contracted or employed with a Regional \nAccountable Entity, tasked with coordinating the delivery of health care and behavioral health \nsupport services for certain Target Population members. A Care Coordinator is distinct from, and \nnot considered, a Case Manager. \nCase Manager: A Case Manager coordinates certain Community-Based Services for Target \nPopulation members. Case Managers have specialized knowledge and training to (1) arrange \ncertain Community-Based Services and (2) facilitate Person-Centered planning for Target \nPopulation members. A Case Manager liaises and coordinates with Providers and (as \nappropriate) Unpaid Supports to help the Target Population member complete a Person-Centered \nservice plan that enables that member to receive certain services, and to transition to or remain \nsafely in the Community.  \nCase Management Agency: A Case Management Agency is a public or private agency that is \ncontracted by HCPF to provide case management services to Target Population members for \nspecific Community-Based Services.  \nCommunity: Community refers to integrated settings in which people live, work, recreate, and \nreceive services. A Target Population member’s Community residence will be the most \nintegrated setting that is appropriate to the member’s needs and that the member does not \noppose. This will usually be a non-disability-targeted residence owned or rented by the member \nor the member’s Unpaid Support(s). Community residences do not include nursing facilities or \nassisted living facilities. \nCommunity-Based Services: Community-Based Services are individualized, Person-Centered, \nflexible, and culturally and linguistically competent services, delivered in integrated settings, to \nhelp Target Population members live in the Community. These services include those services \nand supports provided through a waiver authorized in Section 1915(c) or 1915(k) of the Social \nSecurity Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396n(c), 1396n(k), and other services and supports such as long \nterm home health, private duty nursing, program of all-inclusive care for the elderly, Housing \nServices, care coordination services for Target Population members, and case management \ndescribed in this Agreement, including Transition Coordination Services. \nCommunity Transition: Community Transition occurs when an Institutionalized Population \nmember transitions from a nursing facility and into the Community. \nDiversion: Diversion is the Person-Centered process that occurs to enable an At-Risk Population \nmember who requires Community-Based Services to receive the services described in the \nDiversion Plan in the Community rather than a nursing facility.  \nDiversion Planning: Diversion Planning is the Person-Centered process through which the State \nprovides and arranges services to enable an At-Risk Population member to avoid admission to a \nnursing facility and live instead in the Community. \nU.S. v. Colorado, No. 1:23-cv-2538 (D. Colo.)

Educated Choice requires reasonable, \ndocumented efforts to identify and address any concerns or objections to community living \nraised by the Target Population member or by any Unpaid Support. \nHealth Care Policy & Financing (“HCPF”): The Colorado Department of Health Care Policy \n& Financing is the State agency that administers Colorado’s Medicaid program. HCPF is the lead \nagency for the State’s implementation of this Agreement. \nHome Maintenance Allowance: The Home Maintenance Allowance is the amount a Target \nPopulation member can reserve for maintenance of the member’s home in accordance with the \nrequirements set forth in HCPF regulation at 10 Code Colo. Regs. § 2505-10:8.100.7.V.3.g.ii. \nHome Modifications: Home Modifications are physical adaptations to a Target Population \nmember’s current or prospective private residence, which are necessary for that member’s health, \nwelfare, and safety or to enable the member to function with greater independence in the home \nor avoid nursing facility placement. A private residence may be an owner-occupied home or a \nrental unit. \nHousing Navigation Services: Housing Navigation Services are services that help Target \nPopulation members obtain stable housing in the Community.  \nHousing Services: Housing Services are Housing Navigation Services, Home Modifications, \nhousing voucher administration, the Home Maintenance Allowance program, and tenancy \nsupports, as set forth in this Agreement. \nIn-Reach: In-Reach is the act of actively seeking to engage an Institutionalized Population \nmember, and providing the Institutionalized Population member with: (1) full and accurate \ninformation about Housing Services and other Community-Based Services, as an alternative to \nnursing facility-based services; (2) responses to any questions or concerns raised by the member \nor the member’s Unpaid Support(s); and (3) referrals to Case Management Agencies, Transition \nCoordination Agencies, or other agencies, as identified by the State, that help members meet \ntheir needs in the Community. The goal of In-Reach is to actively support Institutionalized \nPopulation members in making an Educated Choice about transitioning to the Community. \nIn-Reach Counselor: An In-Reach Counselor is a person not affiliated with, employed, or \nenriched by any nursing facility, who conducts group and/or individual In-Reach. \nLevel of Care Screening: A Level of Care Screening is the comprehensive evaluation of a \nTarget Population member to determine the member’s functional eligibility for admission or \ncontinued stay in certain long-term services and supports programs. \nMonitor: The Monitor is the individual defined in Section X of this Agreement. \nParties: The Parties are the United States and the State. \nU.S. v.

Transition Coordination \nServices help Target Population members transition into or remain in the Community. Transition \nCoordination Services include coordinating with nursing facility staff, Unpaid Supports, and \nProviders; facilitating Transition Planning; and arranging Housing Services and other \nCommunity-Based Services as needed. For purposes of this Agreement, Target Population \nmembers need Transition Coordination Services if they: (1) have Unstable Housing, (2) meet an \ninstitutional level of care at the time of Community Transition or Diversion, (3) could not \nsuccessfully complete Community Transition without Transition Coordination Services to \nresolve documented medical, logistical, or service needs (i.e., a lack of Unpaid Supports, \ndifficulty supporting a member’s instrumental activities of daily living in the Community, or \nchallenges arranging skilled nursing care, durable medical equipment, and/or behavioral health \nservices before Community Transition), or (4) could not successfully complete Community \nTransition without Transition Coordination Services to resolve psychological and emotional \neffects of institutionalization that pose a documented barrier to Community Transition. \nTransition Coordinator: A Transition Coordinator provides Transition Coordination Services to \nTarget Population members who want to move to the Community. Transition Coordinators have \nspecialized knowledge and training in arranging identified Community Based-Services for \nU.S. v. Colorado, No. 1:23-cv-2538 (D. Colo.)

Transition Coordinators may not be affiliated with \nany nursing facility. \nTransition Planning: Transition Planning is the Person-Centered process of transitioning an \nInstitutionalized Population member into the Community. Transition Planning must comply with \nSection VI and begins on the Transition Start Date and is completed once the Institutionalized \nPopulation member is safely housed in the Community. \nTransition Plan: A Transition Plan is an Institutionalized Population member’s Person-Centered \nplan as described in Section VI to effectuate the member’s Community Transition.  \nTransition Start Date: A Transition Start Date is the day a Transition Coordinator accepts the \nreferral to support the Institutionalized Population member’s Community Transition. \nUnpaid Support: An Unpaid Support is a person who: (1) is not employed by a Provider; (2) \nknows a Target Population member personally; and (3) regularly, voluntarily, and with the Target \nPopulation member’s consent, helps the Target Population member access services, perform \nactivities of daily living, obtain and maintain housing, and otherwise engage in the Community. \nUnstable Housing: Target Population members have Unstable Housing when they would benefit \nfrom assistance with accessing adequate and/or safe housing because they may, for example: (1) \nmove frequently for financial reasons, e.g. two or more times during the last 60 days; (2) pay \nmore than 30 percent of their income for housing, and have difficulty paying for necessities like \nfood, clothing, transportation, and medical care; (3) live in another person’s home because of \neconomic hardship; (4) be threatened with eviction or have been otherwise notified that their \nright to occupy their current housing or living situation will be terminated within 21 days; (5) \nlive in a hotel or motel; (6) live in severely overcrowded housing, such as a single-room \noccupancy or efficiency apartment unit where more than two people reside or live in a larger \nhousing unit where more than 1.5 people reside per room; (7) be experiencing homelessness, \nincluding residing in a homeless shelter or transitional housing; or (8) live in housing that has \ncharacteristics associated with instability and an increased risk of homelessness, e.g. substandard \nhousing, a home where emotional or physical abuse, threat of violence, exploitation, neglect, \nillegal drug use or other illegal activities commonly occur, or any other location detrimental to \nthe member’s health and safety. \n \nV.  IN-REACH COUNSELING AND PUBLIC OUTREACH \nA.  Nursing Facility In-Reach. The State will ensure that In-Reach counseling is provided to \nInstitutionalized Population members to provide them the opportunity to make an Educated \nChoice of service setting.  \n1.  Group In-Reach. The State will begin providing, at least once every six months, \ngroup-based In-Reach counseling at every nursing facility where Institutionalized \nPopulation members reside in accordance with the following: \na.  By January 31, 2025, the State will have provided Group In-Reach at least \nonce to 75 percent of nursing facilities where Institutionalized Population \nmembers reside. \nU.S. v. Colorado, No. 1:23-cv-2538 (D. Colo.)    Page 6 of 32 \nSettlement Agreement  \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538-PAB-MEH     Document 62-1     filed 10/31/24     USDC Colorado \nDocusign Envelope ID: E064C111-FD86-4662-87B3-E15A735B2463 pg 7 of 32\nb.  The In-Reach Counselor providing Group In-Reach will record members’ \nrequests for Individual In-Reach and refer them for Individual In-Reach. The In-\nReach Counselor will refer members who express a desire to transition directly to \na Transition Coordination Agency, or other agency, for further assessment and to \nsupport the transition. Referrals will take place within six business days. \nc.  By April 30, 2025, the State will have provided Group In-Reach at least \nonce at every nursing facility where Institutionalized Population members reside. \n2.  Individual In-Reach. By February 28, 2026, the State will begin providing \nIndividual In-Reach counseling to each Institutionalized Population member, as follows: \na.  Individual In-Reach occurs when an In-Reach Counselor provides In-\nReach during a meeting with one Institutionalized Population member and their \nlegal guardian, if applicable. If the member has Unpaid Supports and wants them \nto attend a meeting, then they will be encouraged to attend. An Individual In-\nReach meeting will occur in person except for health or safety reasons or if the \nInstitutionalized Population member wishes to meet virtually. \nb.  The State will provide Individualized In-Reach to Institutionalized \nPopulation members in a manner and frequency sufficient to provide them with an \nEducated Choice of service setting. In-Reach Counselors will have sufficient \ncontact with members to respond to a member’s, legal guardian’s, or Unpaid \nSupport’s questions or concerns about Community Transition.  \nc.  When a member requests Individual In-Reach at a Group In-Reach event, \nthe Individual In-Reach meeting will take place within 10 business days of the \nreferral for Individual In-Reach. \nd.  In-Reach Counselors will individualize their efforts to engage members \nbased on their understanding of the member’s concerns, preferences, and needs.   \ne.  At a minimum, In-Reach Counselors will document the member’s name, \ndate of meeting, and the member’s level of interest in Community Transition. \nUpon learning that a member is interested in Community Transition, the In-Reach \nCounselor will refer the member, within six business days, to a Transition \nCoordination Agency, or other agency, for further assessment and to support the \ntransition unless the member already has a Transition Coordinator or has recently \nengaged in the Community Transition process. The In-Reach Counselor must do \nso without assessing the feasibility of transition. \nf.  Institutionalized Population members will not be required to speak with \nIn-Reach Counselors, but will have regular opportunities to do so. \ng.  By December 31, 2026, all Institutionalized Population members will have \nreceived, or have opted out of, Individual In-Reach at least once. If an \nInstitutionalized Population member declines In-Reach, the In-Reach Counselor \nU.S. v. Colorado, No. 1:23-cv-2538 (D. Colo.)

Nursing Facility Role in In-Reach. The State will require nursing facilities to \nmake private space available for In-Reach counseling, out of the presence of nursing \nfacility staff, unless the member requests the presence of nursing facility staff. The State \nwill prohibit nursing facilities from interfering with In-Reach and will respond to reports \nof interference with In-Reach activities. \nB.  Informational Materials. By June 30, 2025, the State will publish on its website and make \navailable accessible information for Target Population members, their guardians, if applicable, \nand their Unpaid Supports about how to obtain Community-Based Services, designed to support \ntheir Educated Choice of service setting. The State will update this information as needed and \ndisseminate it to agencies and organizations that serve as referral sources for Community-Based \nServices, Target Population members, and Target Population members’ Unpaid Supports. These \nmaterials will describe the various Community-Based Services available to Target Population \nmembers. \nC.  Outreach. The State will develop and disseminate information about: (1) the services \navailable to Target Population members under the Agreement; (2) the array of available \nCommunity-Based Services; and (3) how Target Population members can access these services. \nD.  Records. The State will record and maintain the information related to its implementation \nof this Section, including: \n1.  The date, location, and number of attendees for every Group In-Reach event; \n2.  The number of Institutionalized Population members attending Group In-Reach \nwho subsequently ask (i) to receive Individual In-Reach, or (ii) to be connected to a \nTransition Coordinator or other Provider supporting their transition; \n3.  The number of Institutionalized Population members who received Individual In-\nReach;  \n4.  The number of Institutionalized Population members receiving Individual In-\nReach who subsequently ask to be connected to a Transition Coordinator or other \nProvider to support the transition; and \n5.  The documentation described in Section V(A)(2)(g) for each Institutionalized \nPopulation Member who declines In-Reach. \nVI.  COMMUNITY TRANSITIONS \nA.  Assignment of Transition Coordinators. When an Institutionalized Population member \nwho has decided to transition to the Community is referred for Transition Coordination Services, \nthe State will ensure, except in rare circumstances, that a Transition Coordinator accepts \nassignment to serve the Institutionalized Population member within five business days of that \nU.S. v. Colorado, No. 1:23-cv-2538 (D. Colo.)

The Transition Coordinator will facilitate Transition Planning for an Institutionalized \nPopulation member who wants to transition to the Community.  \nB.  Commencement of Transition Planning. Transition Planning and the facilitating of \nTransition Coordination Services will begin on an Institutionalized Population member’s \nTransition Start Date.  \nC.  Transition Team. For each Institutionalized Population member who wants to transition to \nthe Community, the assigned Transition Coordinator will work with the member to form a \ntransition team relevant to the member’s Transition Planning. Within 10 business days of the \nTransition Start Date, the Transition Coordinator will have an initial meeting with the member \nand form the transition team. Transition team members will be available for consultation as \nneeded. To the extent possible, the State will ensure that nursing facility staff work in concert \nwith the transition team, providing records and information about the member’s strengths, needs, \npreferences, and interests. The Transition Coordinator will serve as the lead contact with the \nmember leading up to Community Transition. Transition teams will include without limitation \nthe following, as appropriate: \n1.  Individuals knowledgeable about Housing Services and other Community-Based \nServices that the member may require to transition;  \n2.  Individuals with the linguistic and cultural competence to serve the member; \n3.  A Peer Mentor (if available); and \n4.  With the member’s consent, other individuals, including the member’s Unpaid \nSupport(s). \nD.  Transition Plans. Transition Plans will be Person-Centered, drafted within 52 days of the \nTransition Start Date, and updated consistent with the member’s transition progress and \nneeds. Transition Plans will document the Planned Transition Date and specify all needed \nservices; the member’s nursing facility; any barriers to transition; and the steps the transition \nteam will take to avoid or overcome those barriers. The Planned Transition Date will not be \nunreasonably delayed. A Community Transition will be considered feasible except where a \nmember’s needs cannot be met in the Community, even with the services described in this \nAgreement. Determinations that a transition is not feasible should be rare. \nE.  Transition Escalation. By April 30, 2026 and thereafter, Community Transition will occur \nby the Planned Transition Date, absent unavoidable circumstances. If the Community Transition \nis not completed within 120 days of the member’s Transition Start Date, the State will refer the \nmatter to the HCBS Escalation Team, which will review the matter, document why the \nCommunity Transition is taking longer, and, as appropriate, assist the Transition Coordination \nAgency and Transition Coordinator assigned to that member to expedite the Community \nTransition. \nU.S. v.

Transition Totals. \n1.  To calculate the total number of Community Transitions for purposes of this \nSection, a Community Transition means any Institutionalized Population member \ntransitioned from a nursing facility into the Community, except Community Transitions \ndo not include discharges: (a) from a nursing facility to a hospital, assisted living facility, \nor different nursing facility, (b) occurring within 30 days from admission to the nursing \nfacility, or (c) where a member returns to a nursing facility (excluding brief or \nrehabilitative stays) caused in substantial part by insufficient provision of Community-\nBased Services.  \n2.  If an Institutionalized Population member, who is counted toward either required \ntotal in paragraphs (3) or (4) below, then returns to a nursing facility, then the State will \nreport the event to the Monitor. The Monitor may require the State to provide \ndocumentation of facts supporting a conclusion that the member’s departure from the \nCommunity was not caused in substantial part by insufficient provision of Community-\nBased Services. In their discretion, the Monitor may conduct interviews, review records, \nand verify whether the individual’s prior transition can be counted toward the totals. The \nParties will have an opportunity to review the facts and provide comment. \n3.  Of Institutionalized Population members who need Transition Coordination \nServices and Community-Based Services to successfully transition to the Community, the \nState shall ensure that at least 950 receive Transition Coordination Services and \nsuccessfully complete Community Transition within the term of the Agreement. \n4.  Separate from paragraph (3), the State will ensure that at least 1,050 additional \nInstitutionalized Population members complete Community Transition within the term of \nthis Agreement while receiving Community-Based Services within six months after \nCommunity Transition. If the State exceeds the transition total in paragraph (3), it may \ncount that excess toward its transition total in paragraph (4). \n5.  In achieving these requirements, the State will prioritize Community Transitions \nfor Institutionalized Population members whose nursing facility stays began before the \nEffective Date of this Agreement. \n6.  The State may not count the same individual at once toward both its obligations in \nparagraphs (3)–(4) of this Subsection, and its obligations in Section VII(E). \n7.  The State will achieve 35% of the transition totals in paragraphs (3)–(4) by the \nend of the second year of the Agreement’s term. If the State is unable to do so, then the \nUnited States may utilize the dispute resolution procedures described in Section XIV(H)–\n(I). \n8.  During the third year within the Agreement’s term, the Monitor will begin \nconducting a study based on records, interviews, and other established methodology, to \ndetermine the number of Institutionalized Population members who: (a) can appropriately \nlive in the Community if Community-Based Services are provided; (b) do not oppose \nliving in the Community; (c) are not already receiving effective State transition supports \nU.S. v.

Before the Monitor begins the study, the Parties will have \nthe opportunity to submit comments to the Monitor on the study’s design and \nmethodology. The Monitor will begin the study early enough in the third year of the \nAgreement’s term to report the study’s results to the Parties by August 31, 2027. If \nnecessary, the Monitor may ask the Parties for a reasonable extension of the deadline for \nthis report, to which the Parties will not unreasonably withhold consent. The Parties may, \nwithin 45 days of that report, provide the Monitor with written responses to the study. \n \nIf, after the Monitor reviews the Parties’ written responses, the evidence indicates that \nfewer than 450 remaining Institutionalized Population members meet criteria (a)–(d), \nthen the numerical requirements of paragraphs (3)–(4) above will at that point be waived. \nIf the evidence indicates that more than 450 remaining Institutionalized Population \nmembers meet criteria (a)–(d), then the Parties will, with the assistance of the Monitor, \nnegotiate any appropriate modifications to the Agreement that would best achieve the \ngoals of the 450-person benchmark. These negotiations will include modifying the \nnumerical requirements in paragraphs (3)–(4) so that fewer than 450 Institutionalized \nPopulation members meeting criteria (a)–(d) will remain in nursing facilities by the end \nof the fourth year of the Agreement’s term. If the Parties are unable to reach a resolution \non any such modifications, then the United States may, before the Agreement’s scheduled \ntermination date, seek a judicial remedy pursuant to Section XIV(I)(1)(e). \nG.  Essential Services. All essential services the member’s Transition Plan identifies as \nnecessary to ensure basic health and safety must be arranged before Community Transition \noccurs.  \nH.  Transition Data Analysis. By October 31, 2025, the State will review and analyze the data \ncollected pursuant to Section VI(L) to monitor transition times for Institutionalized Population \nmembers transitioning to the Community. \nI.  Documentation of Educated Choice. Starting April 30, 2025, if an Institutionalized \nPopulation member decides not to complete Community Transition, the Transition Coordinator \nwill document what information was provided to the member, the reason the member (and the \nmember’s Unpaid Supports or guardian, if relevant) gave for deciding not to complete \nCommunity Transition, and any information the Transition Coordinator provided in response. \nThe Transition Coordinator will promptly transmit this documentation to the HCBS Escalation \nTeam. On a monthly basis, the HCBS Escalation Team will review the documentation to assess \nwhether the member was provided sufficient information and opportunities to make an Educated \nChoice. If the HCBS Escalation Team determines that the member (or the member’s Unpaid \nSupports or guardian, if relevant) could benefit from additional information to address their \nconcerns about transition, then the HCBS Escalation Team will work with Transition \nCoordination Agencies to continue the process of Educated Choice, including the resolution of \ntransition barriers.  \nU.S. v.

Eligibility Determinations. To reduce transition times, by October 31, 2025, the State will \ntake steps to simplify and streamline functional and financial eligibility determinations for \nCommunity-Based Services. \nK.  Post-Transition Monitoring. To ensure that Institutionalized Population members who \ntransition out of a nursing facility are adequately supported in the Community, the State will \nconduct post-transition monitoring as required by 10 Code Colo. Regs. § 2505-\n10:8.519.27.F.1.c–d (2024). \nL.  Records. The State will record and maintain the information related to its implementation \nof this Section, including: \n1.  For any member referred to the HCBS Escalation Team, the member’s name, a \ncopy of that member’s current Transition Plan, the reason the Community Transition did \nnot occur within 120 days, and actions the HCBS Escalation Team took to address any \ntransition barriers. \n2.  For each Institutionalized Population member who is referred to Transition \nCoordination: (a) the date when the member was referred to a Transition Coordinator; \nand (b) the date when the Transition Coordinator accepted the referral; \n3.  For each Institutionalized Population member who begins Transition Planning: (a) \nthe member’s name; (b) the Transition Start Date; (c) the facility where the member lived \non the Transition Start Date; (d) whether the member had access to housing outside of a \nnursing facility as of the Transition Start Date, and if so, whether the housing needed \nHome Modifications as of the Transition Start Date; and (e) the date (if any) on which the \nmember’s Transition Plan was completed during Transition Planning; \n4.  For every member who completes Community Transition: (a) the date on which \nCommunity Transition occurred; (b) the date of service activation or first date of service; \nand (c) the address of the member’s residence; and \n5.  For any Institutionalized Population member who decided not to complete \nCommunity Transition, the Educated Choice documentation required by Section VI(I). \nVII.  DIVERSION, RAPID REINTEGRATION, AND PLANNING FOR AT-RISK \nPOPULATION MEMBERS \nA.  Identifying At-Risk Population Members. By June 30, 2025, the State will develop and \nimplement a system that, after that point, timely and regularly identifies At-Risk Population \nmembers described in Section III(A)(1). \n1.  Within 30 days after the Effective Date or five business days of the State entering \ninto a Contract with the Monitor, whichever is later, the State will submit to the Monitor \nand the United States a proposed methodology for establishing criteria to identify \nmembers at risk of institutionalization. \nU.S. v. Colorado, No. 1:23-cv-2538 (D. Colo.)    Page 12 of 32 \nSettlement Agreement  \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538-PAB-MEH     Document 62-1     filed 10/31/24     USDC Colorado \nDocusign Envelope ID: E064C111-FD86-4662-87B3-E15A735B2463 pg 13 of 32\n2.  By January 31, 2025, the State will have completed stakeholder engagement, data \ncollection, and analysis to determine factors that place a member at risk of nursing \nfacility admission. \n3.  By February 28, 2025, the State will submit to the Monitor and the United States \na report outlining the analysis used, proposed methods for identifying and updating the \nAt-Risk Population, and approach by which the methods will be validated. \n4.  The Monitor and the United States will provide feedback within 30 days of \nreceiving the methods and report identified in the preceding paragraph. The State will \naddress this feedback within 30 days. Before implementing its methodology, the State \nmust make any revisions necessary to obtain the Monitor’s approval.  \n5.  Within two months after the Monitor approves the methodology, the State will \nuse the methodology to identify At-Risk Population members. Thereafter, those members \nidentified through the methodology will be considered members of the At-Risk \nPopulation for purposes of this Agreement. \n6.  Within six months of implementing the methodology to identify At-Risk \nPopulation members, the State will ensure that at least 95% of At-Risk Population \nmembers are assigned a Case Manager or Care Coordinator and contacted by that Case \nManager or Care Coordinator to discuss the topics identified in Section VII(B). The State \nwill continue to maintain this 95% rate over the duration of the Agreement’s term. \n7.  One year following the implementation, the State will validate the accuracy of the \nmethodology and refine as necessary. \n8.  If the State changes the methodology, the State will submit to the Monitor and the \nUnited States a report outlining the analysis used, proposed changes to the methods for \nidentifying and updating the At-Risk Population, and the approach by which the new \nmethods will be validated. The Monitor and the United States will provide feedback \nwithin 30 days of receiving the submission. The State will address this feedback within \n30 days of receipt. Before implementing its methodology, the State must make any \nrevisions necessary to obtain the Monitor’s approval. \nB.  Contact with Newly Identified At-Risk Population Members. After the six-month \nimplementation period discussed in Section VII(A)(6), a Case Manager or Care Coordinator will \ncontact newly identified At-Risk Population members within 10 business days of receiving a \nreferral from the State. The Care Coordinator or Case Manager will discuss with the member, \nand, when requested by the member, any Unpaid Supports or guardian involved in decision-\nmaking about the member’s care, the Community-Based Services, Housing Services, and other \nservices needed to remain in the Community. \nC.  Diversion. For an At-Risk Population member who receives a Level of Care Screening; \nmay need nursing facility services as identified by the Case Manager or Care Coordinator; or \nindicates that they are seeking nursing facility services, the State will take the following steps: \nU.S. v. Colorado, No. 1:23-cv-2538 (D. Colo.)    Page 13 of 32 \nSettlement Agreement  \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538-PAB-MEH     Document 62-1     filed 10/31/24     USDC Colorado \nDocusign Envelope ID: E064C111-FD86-4662-87B3-E15A735B2463 pg 14 of 32\n1.  The State will require the Case Manager to provide the member with all \ninformation necessary to make an Educated Choice of service setting. The State will also \nrequire the Case Manager to document all steps taken to ensure Educated Choice and all \nfacts indicating whether the member opposes or does not oppose Community living.  \n2.  For an At-Risk Population member who does not oppose living in the Community \nand has not been admitted to a nursing facility, the State will require the Case Manager or \nCare Coordinator to immediately begin Diversion Planning and to do the following: \na.  Commence or Increase Services in the Community. The Case Manager or \nCare Coordinator will refer to or arrange for the member appropriate and \nnecessary Community-Based Services, as identified through Diversion Planning, \nto meet the member’s service needs in the Community. \nb.  Refer Members with Unstable Housing. For an At-Risk Population \nmember with Unstable Housing, the Case Manager or Care Coordinator will refer \nto or arrange appropriate Housing Services, as identified through Diversion \nPlanning, to meet the member’s needs in the Community. \nD.  Rapid Referral and Rapid Reintegration. Starting April 30, 2026, for every At-Risk \nPopulation member who is admitted to a nursing facility and does not oppose living in the \nCommunity, the State will ensure that the member’s Case Manager effectuates Rapid \nReintegration or Rapid Referral. For members experiencing Unstable Housing, the State will \nRapidly Refer those members to Transition Coordination Services, as described in Subsection (1) \nbelow. For those members that are not experiencing Unstable Housing, the State will effectuate \nRapid Reintegration as described in Subsection (2) below. \n1.  Rapid Referral. If an At-Risk Population member who does not oppose living in \nthe Community is to be admitted to a nursing facility and is also experiencing Unstable \nHousing, the State will ensure that the member’s Case Manager promptly refers the \nmember to a Transition Coordinator to receive necessary Transition Coordination \nServices to return to the Community. This referral process will be known as a “Rapid \nReferral.”  \na.  Timing of Rapid Referral. A Rapid Referral must occur within two \nbusiness days of the Case Manager learning that an At-Risk Member is to be \nadmitted to a nursing facility and the member does not oppose living in the \nCommunity. \nb.  Preliminary Referral Documentation. Before Rapidly Referring the \nmember to a Transition Coordinator, the member’s Case Manager will document \nand identify any barrier to transitioning the member back into the Community, the \nrationale for any contemplated nursing facility stay, and any other information the \nCase Manager determines necessary to help accelerate the Community Transition \nprocess once the member is Rapidly Referred. \nc.  Accepting Referral. Transition Coordinators must accept a Rapid Referral \nof a member within two business days of receiving the referral. If the Transition \nU.S. v. Colorado, No. 1:23-cv-2538 (D. Colo.)

Rapid Transition Coordination Services. Upon accepting a Rapid Referral, \na Transition Coordinator will promptly begin the Community Transition process \nas set forth in Section VI of this Agreement. \n2.  Rapid Reintegration. If an At-Risk Population member who does not oppose \nliving in the Community is to be admitted to a nursing facility and the member is not \nexperiencing Unstable Housing, the member’s Case Manager will immediately begin \ndeveloping a Rapid Reintegration Plan to effectuate a Rapid Reintegration. \na.  Timing of Rapid Reintegration Plan. The State will ensure that the Case \nManager develops a Rapid Reintegration Plan during the Level of Care Screening \nfor nursing facility admission. The Rapid Reintegration Plan will be amended and \nupdated as necessary. \nb.  Components of Rapid Reintegration Plan. The Rapid Reintegration Plan \nwill include the following, as appropriate: \ni.  Any barriers to Rapid Reintegration, and the steps that will be \ntaken to avoid or overcome those barriers;  \nii.  The tasks that must occur before, during, and after Rapid \nReintegration to ensure that Rapid Reintegration is successful, with \ntimeframes for completing each task and responsibilities assigned to \nspecific people; \niii.  The date on which Rapid Reintegration is intended to occur, and \nthe intended duration of the contemplated nursing facility stay;  \niv.  The rationale for any contemplated nursing facility stay and for the \nlength of that contemplated stay; and  \nv.  Post-reintegration plan, for the Case Manager to follow up with the \nmember. \nc.  Execution of Plan. The member’s Case Manager will initiate and monitor \nRapid Reintegration efforts and will be responsible for communicating with \nothers who are assigned tasks in the Rapid Reintegration Plan. \nd.  Escalation of Rapid Reintegration. A Rapid Reintegration occurs within 30 \ndays of nursing facility admission. If a Rapid Reintegration does not occur within \nthat timeframe, the HCBS Escalation Team will review the matter, update the \nRapid Reintegration Plan with a determination of why the transition is taking \nlonger, and provide assistance to the Case Management Agency or Case Manager \nto expedite the reintegration.  \nU.S. v. Colorado, No. 1:23-cv-2538 (D. Colo.)

Rapid Referral and Rapid Reintegration Data Analysis. By April 30, 2026, the \nState will review and analyze the data collected pursuant to this Section to monitor \nreintegration times. \n4.  Post-Reintegration Planning for Waiver Service Recipients. The State will ensure \nthat At-Risk Population members who complete Rapid Reintegration and receive HCBS \nwaiver services receive adequate case management to remain in the Community. \nE.  Diversion Metrics. \n1.  Upon implementation of the methodology described in Section VII(A), the State \nwill use the methodology to identify the number of At-Risk population members as of \ntwelve months before the date of implementation. The State will calculate the percentage \nof those identified At-Risk Population members who remained in the Community \nthroughout that twelve-month baseline period.  \n2.  For purposes of this Section, there will be a first compliance period that will begin \nthe day after the baseline period ends. This first compliance period will end on the first \ndate that is both (a) at least 180 days after the first day of the first compliance period, and \n(b) exactly 90 days before an anniversary of the Effective Date. After the first compliance \nperiod ends, each subsequent full one-year period within the term of the Agreement will \nconstitute a subsequent compliance period. \n3.  For each compliance period described in paragraph (2), the State will calculate a \npercentage using the same methodology and formula described in paragraph (1). The \npercentage in the first compliance period shall improve on the percentage from the \nbaseline period by (a) the number of percentage points required in the following table \nmultiplied by (b) the number of days in the compliance period divided by 365. The \npercentage in each subsequent compliance period shall improve on the percentage from \nthe immediately preceding compliance period by the number of percentage points \nrequired in the table. \nPercentage for baseline period or for  Required improvement in subsequent \npreceding compliance period  compliance period \n86–100%  0 percentage points \n76–85%  2.5 percentage points \n66–75%  5.0 percentage points \n56–65%  7.5 percentage points \n0–55%  10.0 percentage points \n \n4.  If the methodology in Section VII(A) changes pursuant to procedures described in \nSection VII(A)(8), then the most recent prior percentage described in paragraph (1) or (3) \nwill be recalculated using the new methodology. \n5.  If a Party believes that the required improvement percentage should be adjusted \nup or down, then the Party will provide all facts supporting that belief to the other Party \nU.S. v. Colorado, No. 1:23-cv-2538 (D. Colo.)

For purposes of calculating any percentage in paragraph (1) or (3), an At-Risk \nPopulation member remains in the Community if the member lives in the Community at \nthe end of the baseline period or compliance period and was not, within that period, \nadmitted to a nursing facility for more than 75 days. \n7.  No individual may be counted at once toward both (a) the State’s obligations in \nparagraphs (1)–(6), and (b) the State’s obligations in Section VI(F) (Transition Totals). \nF.  General Policies and Procedures. The State will develop and implement the following \ngeneral policies and procedures to facilitate Diversion and Rapid Reintegration. \n1.  Housing Retention During Rapid Reintegration Planning. In order to increase \nutilization of the Home Maintenance Allowance program by At-Risk Population members \nto maintain housing during brief nursing facility stays, the State will take the following \nsteps by June 30, 2025: \na.  The State will provide regular training to Case Managers, Transition \nCoordinators, nursing facility staff, and other relevant Providers to ensure these \nindividuals are knowledgeable of the Home Maintenance Allowance program and \nits role in reintegrating At-Risk Population members to the Community. \nb.  The State will ensure that the Case Manager responsible for developing \nthe Rapid Reintegration Plan with the At-Risk Population member, assists in and \nfacilitates, as appropriate, the submission of the necessary verifications to \ncalculate the Home Maintenance Allowance and the transmittal of required \ndocumentation to the appropriate county staff. \nc.

If the Parties reach agreement, they will modify the Agreement as set \nforth in Section XIV(C)(2).  \nc.  If the Parties cannot reach agreement on a revised plan for continued \nimplementation of the affected provisions at a reasonable pace, the United States \nmay withdraw its consent to the Agreement and the Parties may revive any claims \nor defenses otherwise barred by its operation.  \nXIII.  GENERAL PROVISIONS \nA.  Binding Agreement. This Agreement is binding on the Parties, by and through their \nofficials, agents, employees, and successors for the term of this Agreement.

Third Parties Involved in Implementation. The Parties acknowledge that either Party may \ncontact or speak alone with any third party involved in the implementation of this Agreement, \nincluding but not limited to nursing facility staff and residents, Providers, Case Managers, \nTransition Coordinators, and In-Reach Counselors. However, the State has no obligation to \nrequire any third party who is not a State employee or contractor to speak with the United States. \nFor the purposes of this section, the term “contractor” does not include Providers. \nF.

Term, Changes to Term, and Other Modifications.  \n1.  Base Term. The State will begin implementing this Agreement immediately. The \nterm of this Agreement is four years, subject to any terminations or extensions. \n2.  Modifications in Writing. The Parties may jointly modify the Agreement for any \nreason, but only in a signed writing. The Parties will file any such modifications with the \nCourt, other than modifications of any timeframes or deadlines for completion of an act \ndue before the Agreement’s scheduled termination date. If necessary, the Parties will \nsimultaneously request that the Court extend jurisdiction over the Agreement as modified. \n3.  Post Monitor Study Conferral. If it is determined, pursuant to Section VI(F)(8), \nthat fewer than 450 remaining Institutionalized Population members meet the criteria \ndescribed in that Section, then the Parties will meet and confer to discuss, in consultation \nwith the Monitor, whether the State is in substantial compliance with the Agreement as a \nwhole. If the Parties agree in writing that the State is in substantial compliance with the \nAgreement as a whole, then the Agreement will terminate at that time. If the Parties do \nnot agree that the State is in substantial compliance with the Agreement as a whole, then \nthe State may file a motion to find the State to be in substantial compliance with the \nAgreement as a whole. In such a proceeding, the State will have the burden to prove that \nit is in substantial compliance with the Agreement as a whole. If the Court determines \nthat the State is in substantial compliance with the Agreement as a whole, then the \nAgreement will terminate on the date of the Court’s order.  \nD.  Scheduled End of Term.  \n1.  Termination Due to Substantial Compliance. If the Agreement is not terminated \nearly pursuant to Section XIV(C)(3), and if the Parties agree as of the last day of the \nAgreement’s term that the State is in substantial compliance with the Agreement, then the \nAgreement will expire as scheduled. \n2.  Noncompliance. If the United States believes that as of the last day of the \nAgreement’s term that the State will be out of compliance with the Agreement, and if the \nParties cannot agree on a modification to the Agreement resolving this noncompliance, \nthen the United States may file a motion submitting the dispute to the Court, seeking \nrelief for the noncompliance, and requesting that the Court schedule a proceeding to \nadjudicate the dispute.

The United States may file such a motion during the last six months of the \nAgreement’s term. \nE.  Substantial Compliance. For purposes of this Agreement, “Substantial Compliance” will \nmean something less than strict or literal compliance, consistent with applicable law. \nNoncompliance with mere technicalities, or isolated or temporary failure to comply during a \nU.S. v. Colorado, No. 1:23-cv-2538 (D. Colo.)

Impossibility. Noncompliance with this Agreement due to circumstances outside of the \nState’s control that are unanticipated, unpreventable, and unavoidable will not constitute a breach \nof this Agreement.  \nG.

Upon \ndismissal of the Case, the United States releases and discharges the State from liability, known or \nunknown, for all ADA and Section 504 claims of the United States Attorney General described in \nthe Letter of Findings and the Complaint, pleaded in the Complaint, or resolved by this \nAgreement. The United States represents that it has authority to deliver this release and that this \nrelease shall be effective. \nH.  Informal Dispute Resolution. The Parties agree to work collaboratively to achieve the \npurpose of this Agreement and will attempt to resolve informally any disputes that may arise. \nThis includes timely responses to reasonable information requests related to the dispute. If a \ndispute arises over the language or construction of this Agreement or its requirements, the Parties \nagree to meet and confer in an effort to achieve a mutually agreeable resolution before initiating \nany judicial proceeding. Either party may request the assistance of the Monitor to help the Parties \ninformally resolve a dispute. \nI.  Formal Dispute Resolution. \n1.  If the United States believes that the State is failing to achieve substantial \ncompliance with any obligation of this Agreement that is due before the Agreement’s \nscheduled termination date, then: \na.  The United States will request a meeting with the State and the Monitor to \ndetermine whether the Parties can agree on how to resolve the alleged \nnoncompliance. \nb.  If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement through the meeting \ndescribed above, the United States will notify the State in writing of the alleged \nfailure and request that the State correct the alleged failure. The State will have 45 \ndays to respond to the United States in writing. \nc.  In such written response, the State will, for each allegation of failure to \nachieve or maintain substantial compliance, either (i) accept (without necessarily \nadmitting) the allegation of noncompliance and propose a curative action plan \ndescribing all steps that the State will take to cure the noncompliance and by \nwhen it will take these steps; or (ii) deny noncompliance. \nd.

COMPLAINT \nSTATE OF COLORADO,   \n      Defendant. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  Thousands of Coloradans with physical disabilities are unnecessarily segregated or at risk \nof being unnecessarily segregated in nursing facilities due to the State’s failure to make \ncommunity services available to them.  \n2.  People with physical disabilities, including older adults, often need help with their daily \nactivities and to care for their health conditions.  For example, some people with chronic health \nconditions, like diabetes, may need daily help taking and keeping track of their medications.  \nOthers need help getting dressed, bathing, or eating because of mobility challenges caused by \ndisabilities like multiple sclerosis, severe arthritis, spina bifida, or paralysis.  \n3.  Like other states, Colorado funds and administers services, through Medicaid and other \npublicly funded programs, for their low-income residents who have physical disabilities.  The \nservices Colorado provides include nursing services; speech, physical, and occupational therapy; \nhelp getting and keeping track of medicines and medical equipment, like a wheelchair or a \n1 \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538   Document 1   filed 09/29/23   USDC Colorado   pg 2 of 21\nventilator; help finding and maintaining housing; and help with everyday activities, like using the \nbathroom, taking a bath, getting dressed, and eating. \n4.  These services can be provided to people in their own homes.  But thousands of people \nwith physical disabilities in Colorado can only access these services by giving up their homes \nand moving into a nursing facility.  \n5.  Each year, many Coloradans with physical disabilities move into nursing facilities after \nbecoming injured, sick, or homeless, or when friends, relatives, or paid caregivers can no longer \ntake care of them.   \n6.  For some, a brief rehabilitative stay turns into a long-term nursing facility placement \nwhen the State does not provide the services they need to move back to their homes.  As a result, \nsome people who want to return home have stayed in nursing facilities for many years.   \n7.  In 1990, Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act (the “ADA”), which \nrecognized that historically, society has discriminated against people with disabilities by \nisolating and segregating them away from their communities.  So, in Title II of the ADA, \nCongress prohibited states from needlessly segregating people with disabilities.  When a state \nprovides services to people with disabilities, it must provide those services in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to recipients’ needs unless doing so would fundamentally alter its service \nsystem.  This allows people who receive these services to live and participate in their \ncommunities, alongside their non-disabled family members, friends, and neighbors, rather than \nbeing separated from society. \n2 \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538   Document 1   filed 09/29/23   USDC Colorado   pg 3 of 21\n8.  Most Coloradans with physical disabilities who have had to move to nursing facilities \n(the “Institutionalized Individuals”) could live at home, alone or with family or friends, if they \ncould access the services they need there.   \n9.  Many of these people would choose to live in the community if provided a meaningful \nopportunity to do so.   \n10.  Coloradans with physical disabilities who are at serious risk of institutionalization (the \n“At-Risk Individuals”) currently live in the community but might have to move to nursing \nfacilities in the near future to receive the services they need.  At-Risk Individuals generally want \nto stay in the community. \n11.  Moving into a nursing facility not only separates people from their communities, but also \ndeprives them of the ability to make basic choices about their daily lives.  For example, most \nnursing facility residents cannot choose their roommate, what they eat, or how they spend their \ndays.   \n12.  Entering a nursing facility can also lead to bad health outcomes.  People’s physical, \nemotional, and mental health can worsen when they are separated from their communities, \nfriends and families, and opportunities to be active and independent.  For example, nursing \nfacility staff members, in a hurry to get many residents to the dining hall for mealtimes, tend to \npush residents in wheelchairs even if the residents’ mobility impairments are modest.  As a \nresult, even though these residents are capable of walking with walkers or canes, or “self-\npropelling” their own wheelchairs, they do not do so.  Nursing facility residents have little to do, \nso even people who can move around tend to spend all day in bed or in a chair.  And people who \n3 \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538   Document 1   filed 09/29/23   USDC Colorado   pg 4 of 21\nonce did all or some of their own chores—like laundry, meal preparation, and bill paying—lose \nthose skills in facilities where staff members do these tasks for them.   \n13.  As the COVID-19 pandemic made clear, segregating people with disabilities in nursing \nfacilities also makes them uniquely vulnerable to easily transmissible infections, loneliness, and \nextreme loss of liberty.   \n14.  In 2020, the State acknowledged in a strategic action planning document that “those who \nare older and living in congregate care settings are significantly more at risk [of mortality as a \nresult of COVID-19] than community-dwelling older adults.”  Indeed, more than 2,000 Colorado \nnursing facility residents have died of COVID-19.   \n15.  The State could prevent discrimination against Coloradans with physical disabilities by \nchanging its policies and practices to ensure that people have the information they need to make \na meaningful choice about staying at home or moving into a nursing facility; to make services in \nthe community more reliably available; and to make it easier for people to stay in their homes, or \nto move back to the community when they are ready.   \n16.  The United States has received several complaints alleging disability discrimination \nagainst Colorado nursing facility residents.  These complaints alleged that people with \ndisabilities wanted to live in the community but were stuck in Colorado nursing facilities because \nState policies and practices made it hard for them to move back to their homes. \n17.  The United States brings this lawsuit, seeking a judicial order compelling the State to \nmake reasonable modifications, as the ADA requires, to its services for low-income Coloradans \nwith physical disabilities.  Changes to the State’s policies and practices would enable many more \n4 \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538   Document 1   filed 09/29/23   USDC Colorado   pg 5 of 21\nColoradans with physical disabilities to live in their homes, contribute to their communities, and \ndevelop and maintain bonds with their friends and loved ones. \nJURISDICTION \n18.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1345, because it \ninvolves claims arising under federal law.  See 42 U.S.C. § 12133.  The Court may grant the \nrelief sought in this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–02. \n19.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because a substantial part of \nthe acts and omissions giving rise to this action occurred in the District of Colorado.  28 U.S.C. \n§ 1391(b). \nPARTIES \n20.  Plaintiff is the United States of America. \n21.  Defendant, the State of Colorado, is a “public entity” within the meaning of the ADA, 42 \nU.S.C. § 12131(1), and is therefore subject to Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131–34, and \nits implementing regulation, 28 C.F.R. Part 35.   \nSTATUTORY AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND \n22.  Congress enacted the ADA in 1990 “to provide a clear and comprehensive national \nmandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 12101(b)(1).  It found that “historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals \nwith disabilities, and despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against \nindividuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.”  Id. \n§ 12101(a)(2).   \n5 \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538   Document 1   filed 09/29/23   USDC Colorado   pg 6 of 21\n23.  For those reasons, Congress prohibited discrimination against individuals with disabilities \nby public entities: “[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, \nbe excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”  Id. § 12132.   \n24.  Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by public entities.  \nA “public entity” includes any state or local government, as well as any department, agency, or \nother instrumentality of a state or local government, and it applies to all services, programs, and \nactivities provided or made available by public entities, such as through contractual, licensing, or \nother arrangements.  Id. § 12131(1); 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(i). \n25.  Congress directed the Attorney General to issue a regulation implementing Title II of the \nADA.  42 U.S.C. § 12134.  The Title II regulation includes an “integration mandate,” which \nrequires public entities to “administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).  \nThe most integrated setting is one that “enables individuals with disabilities to interact with \nnondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible . . . .”  Id., App. B., at 711 (2020). \n26.  In Olmstead, the Supreme Court held that Title II prohibits the unjustified segregation of \nindividuals with disabilities.  527 U.S. 581, 597 (1999).  The Court explained that its holding \n“reflects two evident judgments.”  Id. at 600.  “First, institutional placement of persons who can \nhandle and benefit from community settings perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons \nso isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life.”  Id.  “Second, \nconfinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, \n6 \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538   Document 1   filed 09/29/23   USDC Colorado   pg 7 of 21\nincluding family relations, social contacts, work options, economic independence, educational \nadvancement, and cultural enrichment.”  Id. at 601.  \n27.  Under Title II, as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in the Olmstead \ndecision, public entities are required to provide community-based services when (a) such \nservices are appropriate, (b) the affected individuals do not oppose community-based treatment, \nand (c) community-based services can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the \nresources available to the entity and the needs of other people with disabilities.  Id. at 607. \nCOLORADO’S SERVICE SYSTEM FOR ADULTS WITH PHYSICAL DISABILITIES \n28.  Colorado administers and funds services for adults with physical disabilities through \nvarious agencies, departments, and programs.   \n29.  Low-income individuals with physical disabilities typically need long-term care services \ndelivered where they live, which are frequently referred to as “long-term services and supports,” \nor “LTSS.”  LTSS include nursing care, medication management, therapies, care planning, \ndietary services, and personal care services.  LTSS provide recipients with medical care and help \nwith “activities of daily living.”  Activities of daily living, or “ADLs,” include tasks associated \nwith personal hygiene, toileting, dressing, getting in and out of bed or a chair, walking, and \neating. \n30.  Colorado uses Medicaid financing to fund and administer most of these services.  Some \nof the State’s service recipients receive these services in nursing facilities, while others receive \nthe services in home- and community-based settings (e.g., in their private owned or rented \nhome). \n7 \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538   Document 1   filed 09/29/23   USDC Colorado   pg 8 of 21\n31.  Medicaid is a health care system created by federal law but administered by states who \nare subject to certain federal statutory requirements.  In broad terms, Medicaid’s purpose is to \nprovide government-funded health coverage and related services for low-income individuals and \nindividuals with disabilities.  When these individuals receive authorized services from providers \nthat are enrolled with Medicaid, the providers’ costs are reimbursed with Medicaid funds. \n32.  Federal law requires every state that participates in Medicaid to designate a state agency \nto administer its Medicaid services.  That agency must create a “Medicaid State Plan,” which \ndescribes and defines the services that it will cover through Medicaid.  These services are called \n“medical assistance.”   \n33.  The state agency may provide certain home- and community-based services (or “HCBS”) \nfor people with disabilities through so-called “Medicaid waivers.”1  Services provided through \nthese waivers are “medical assistance” under the State Plan. \n34.  The state agency that administers Colorado’s Medicaid system is the Department of \nHealth Care Policy & Financing, or “HCPF.”  Through HCPF, the State has created a Medicaid \nState Plan and a Medicaid waiver called the “Elderly Blind and Disabled” waiver (the “EBD \nWaiver”).  The Medicaid State Plan and the EBD Waiver cover the Medicaid-funded services \nrelevant to this matter.   \n \n1 The federal agency that oversees state Medicaid programs is the Centers for Medicare & \nMedicaid Services, or “CMS.”  The term “waiver” refers to CMS “waiving” certain program \nrequirements to services a State offers through its Medicaid State Plan.  CMS waives the \nrequirements that State Plan services be provided to beneficiaries across the entire state and that \nthese services be comparable among all individuals within certain groups, and income and \nresource restrictions to allow states to target services to groups of people at serious risk of \ninstitutionalization.  MEDICAID.GOV, Home and Community Based Services, 1915(c), \nhttps://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/hcbs/authorities/1915-c/index.html.   \n8 \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538   Document 1   filed 09/29/23   USDC Colorado   pg 9 of 21\n35.  HCPF delegates certain critical functions, like Medicaid eligibility assessments, to \npolitical subdivisions of the State, like county departments of human services.  \n36.  When a Coloradan with physical disabilities lives in a nursing facility (and is thus an \n“Institutionalized Individual”), the provider who coordinates and delivers the individual’s LTSS \nis the nursing facility, to which Medicaid (through HCPF) pays a daily rate.  This daily rate \naccounts for the cost of providing LTSS, including nursing and personal care assistance; capital \ncosts, including fair rental value of the building; and administrative and overhead costs, \nincluding food and laundry service, property taxes, property insurance, mortgage interest, and \nbuilding repairs and improvements.   \n37.  For At-Risk Individuals, who live in the community, LTSS are coordinated either by the \nindividuals themselves (an arrangement known as “self-direction”), or by case management \nagencies, known as Single Entry Points, or “SEPs,” that contract with HCPF.  The case manager \nis responsible for arranging for the services the individual needs.  Community-based providers \nthen bill Medicaid (through HCPF) for each unit of service provided to the individual. \n38.  At-Risk Individuals and Institutionalized Individuals can receive a variety of transition \ncoordination and housing services to help them move to, or remain in, the community.   \n39.  HCPF administers transition coordination services through Medicaid.  Transition \ncoordination services include assessment, pre-transition planning, and coordination of the \nservices needed to live in the community. \n40.  HCPF administers some housing services through Medicaid.  For example, HCPF \noversees “housing navigation services.”  These are Medicaid services, provided by a housing \n9 \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538   Document 1   filed 09/29/23   USDC Colorado   pg 10 of 21\nnavigator, that help individuals find community-based rental housing and connect them to rental \nsubsidies. \n41.  HCPF also oversees “home modifications,” another Medicaid service.  Home \nmodifications are alterations that are made to homes to make them more accessible, e.g. by \ninstalling wheelchair ramps or roll-in showers.  HCPF partners with another State agency, the \nDivision of Housing (“DOH”) within the Department of Local Affairs (“DOLA”) to administer \nthe home modifications benefit. \n42.  DOH provides tenancy support services to help individuals navigate the responsibilities \nof tenancy.  For example, these services include help maintaining and submitting eligibility \ndocumentation for housing services, communicating with neighbors and landlords, and \ncomplying with lease terms.   \n43.  Rental assistance is provided through a combination of federal and State funds.  HCPF \nand DOH partner to offer rental assistance and supportive services to individuals moving out of \ninstitutions like nursing facilities.   \n44.  DOH and the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority (“CHFA”) fund affordable \nhousing development in Colorado.  DOH makes grants and loans to private housing developers \nand local governments for affordable housing development.  CHFA administers federal and State \ntax credits through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program, the largest source of \naffordable housing development in the country.  Through the LIHTC program, the State \nincentivizes private housing developers to create affordable rental housing opportunities for \nColoradans, in alignment with public policy goals.   \n10 \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538   Document 1   filed 09/29/23   USDC Colorado   pg 11 of 21\n45.  The State fails to maintain a sufficient capacity of community-based service providers, \nincluding those providers responsible for creating and connecting individuals to housing \nopportunities. \n46.  Institutionalized and At-Risk Individuals often experience significant difficulty accessing \nneeded services like home health services, personal care, homemaker services, and housing-\nrelated services, because the State has not made these services sufficiently available.  \n47.  Individuals need these services to manage their health conditions, conduct activities of \ndaily living, and live stably in the community.   \n48.  The State’s failure to maintain a sufficient network of community-based LTSS providers \nprevents Institutionalized Individuals from returning to their communities, and leads many At-\nRisk Individuals to enter nursing facilities unnecessarily.   \n49.  Insufficient access to community-based care is especially acute for individuals who need \novernight care or assistance several times throughout the day, and for individuals in rural and \nfrontier communities.     \n50.  Colorado uses a starkly different reimbursement methodology for nursing facilities as \ncompared to community-based service providers.  Nursing facilities receive an automatic annual \nrate adjustment, but community-based service providers do not.   \n51.  The State’s disparate reimbursement methodologies result in reimbursement rates for \ncommunity-based services that are inadequate to develop a sufficiently robust provider network.   \n52.  As HCPF stated in a recent funding request, “Personal care and homemaker attendants \nplay a vital role in keeping Colorado’s elders, aging parents and grandparents, and people with \ndisabilities in their homes and communities.  If there are not enough people in Colorado who are \n11 \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538   Document 1   filed 09/29/23   USDC Colorado   pg 12 of 21\nwilling to perform these tasks, individuals cannot stay in their homes; the alternative care \nsettings are more expensive, such as placement in nursing facilities or assisted living facilities.”  \n53.  The State also fails to ensure that the provider agencies with which it contracts develop \nand implement reliable contingency plans when staff members miss shifts.  The resulting \nunreliability of services places individuals at serious risk of unnecessary nursing facility \nadmission.  This unreliability also places family caregivers—many of whom are older adults or \npeople with disabilities themselves—under the physical and financial strain of filling regular \ngaps in care for their loved ones, exacerbating the risk of unnecessary nursing facility \nadmissions.     \n54.  Colorado also limits its housing navigation service, which is intended to connect eligible \nInstitutionalized Individuals to community-based housing.  As a result, many Institutionalized \nIndividuals experience prolonged unnecessary segregation while struggling to identify \nappropriate community-based housing opportunities.  The State does not offer the service at all \nto At-Risk Individuals with housing needs.  Many At-Risk Individuals who are experiencing \nhomelessness or have unstable housing thus find themselves with little choice but to move into a \nnursing facility.     \n55.    The State also limits its home modification service.  It offers a home modification \nservice through its waiver programs, but only reimburses home modifications for individuals \nalready living in the community, making the benefit effectively unavailable to Institutionalized \nIndividuals seeking to move to the community.   \n56.  The low lifetime cap on Colorado’s home modification service also discourages some \nindividuals with significant mobility impairments from taking advantage of the service because \n12 \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538   Document 1   filed 09/29/23   USDC Colorado   pg 13 of 21\nthe benefit may not be enough to pay for all necessary home modifications.  Although DOH \noffers tenancy support services to individuals who need help managing the responsibilities of \ntenancy, the State does not make the service widely available to Institutionalized and At-Risk \nIndividuals.  The absence of this service can place at serious risk of unnecessary segregation \nthose whose disabilities, including a history of long-term institutionalization, may interfere with \nlease compliance.  \n57.  The State also fails to adequately inform Institutionalized and At-Risk Individuals about \ncommunity-based alternatives to institutionalization.  \n58.  A Colorado regulation requires information about community-based alternatives to be \nprovided to all individuals considering entering a nursing facility.  See 10 Colo. Code Regs. \n§ 2505–10:8.402.11.   \n59.  Information about community-based alternatives is frequently not provided to individuals \nconsidering entering a nursing facility.  This lack of information leads many At-Risk Individuals \nto become unnecessarily institutionalized, in violation of Title II of the ADA.  \n60.  Once individuals are admitted to a nursing facility (and thus become Institutionalized \nIndividuals), the State identifies individuals who want information about transitioning back to \nthe community by relying on data generated from a portion of a federally required standardized \nsurvey (called the “Minimum Data Set” or “MDS”).   \n61.  Section Q of the MDS asks surveyed residents whether they want “to talk to someone \nabout the possibility of leaving this facility and returning to live and receive services in the \ncommunity.”   \n13 \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538   Document 1   filed 09/29/23   USDC Colorado   pg 14 of 21\n62.  Because community-based services often are not presented, many individuals enter or \nremain in nursing facilities without knowing options about where they could live and what \nservices would be available in the community to support them.   \n63.  As a result, the State fails to determine their preferences, and many who would like to \nreceive information about community living are incorrectly recorded as lacking interest in \ncommunity living.  These individuals then commonly receive no information about community-\nbased alternatives. \n64.  It is the State’s policy that nursing facility residents who are properly recorded as wanting \ninformation about community living should be referred to the State’s “options counseling” \nprogram to receive information about community living opportunities. \n65.  Most nursing facility residents recorded as interested in learning about community living \nare not referred for options counseling, do not receive the information they need, and are not \nprovided with services to help them to return to the community.  \n66.  When Institutionalized Individuals do manage to get connected to a State-contracted \nTransition Coordination Agency, transitions often take several months to a year.  Some take even \nlonger.   \n67.  Individuals routinely experience long delays while awaiting financial eligibility \ndeterminations the State requires for Medicaid-funded waiver services.   \n68.  Many of these financial eligibility determinations are unnecessary. \n69.  As a 2016 State document indicates, the State has known for years that “many individuals \nthat are already enrolled in Medicaid and . . . transitioning from long-term care facilities to \ncommunity-based services are required to go through a new financial eligibility determination \n14 \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538   Document 1   filed 09/29/23   USDC Colorado   pg 15 of 21\neven though it is not necessary.  In many cases, when an individual is already enrolled in \nMedicaid and meets the functional eligibility and targeting criteria for an LTSS program, a \nsimple administrative change in the financial eligibility system is all that is necessary to reflect \nthe current program status.”   \n70.  Delays also result from extended times for processing requests for certain community-\nbased services that must be in place for transition to occur.  These services include skilled home \nhealth services and durable medical equipment.  \n71.  The significant delays associated with these lengthy processing times by the State’s \ndelegated entities cause prolonged unnecessary segregation for Institutionalized Individuals.  \nThey also jeopardize individuals’ housing opportunities and create additional obstacles and \ncomplications to completing transition.   \n72.  The longer individuals are institutionalized, the weaker their support networks and self-\nconfidence become.  These frustrations lead some individuals to give up and withdraw from the \nprocess of transitioning to the community, remaining in nursing facilities even though they prefer \nto receive services in the community. \nTHOUSANDS OF ADULTS WITH PHYSICAL DISABILITIES RESIDE IN SEGREGATED NURSING \nFACILITIES IN COLORADO, WHILE NUMEROUS OTHERS ARE AT RISK OF SEGREGATION. \n73.  Approximately 9,000 Institutionalized Individuals live in Colorado nursing facilities. \n74.  Nursing facilities are segregated service settings.  They usually have several centrally \nlocated nurses’ stations and medication carts in the hallways outside of residents’ rooms.  \nResidents’ lives tend to be subject to schedules and routines dictated by the needs of their \ninstitutions, leaving residents with little to no control over their daily activities.  Residents \n15 \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538   Document 1   filed 09/29/23   USDC Colorado   pg 16 of 21\ntypically live in shared rooms with little privacy or choice of roommate and spend their days in \nbed or sitting in a common area.   \n75.  Staff determine when and what residents eat, and, frequently, when they get in and out of \nbed, bathe, dress, and take care of personal hygiene and toileting needs.  Residents rarely leave \nnursing facilities to attend social, recreational, vocational, or religious activities of their choosing \noutside of the facility.  Many residents do not leave the facility at all except for medical \nappointments.  Nursing facility residents have limited to no interaction with individuals without \ndisabilities other than facility staff.  \n76.   Many other Coloradans with physical disabilities are at serious risk of having to move to \nnursing facilities to access the services they need.  State policies and practices make it harder for \nindividuals to access these services in the community than in nursing facilities, especially when \nthere are time-sensitive needs.  Changes in personal circumstances, like an injury or deteriorating \ncondition, the loss of a family caregiver, a financial setback, or loss of housing, can create a need \nfor additional community-based services that goes unmet, driving unnecessary \ninstitutionalization.  \nMANY INSTITUTIONALIZED AND AT-RISK INDIVIDUALS ARE QUALIFIED TO RECEIVE \nSERVICES IN MORE INTEGRATED SETTINGS AND WOULD NOT OPPOSE PLACEMENT IN SUCH \nSETTINGS. \n77.  Institutionalized Individuals are Medicaid-eligible adult nursing facility residents with \nphysical disabilities.  A physical disability is a physical impairment that substantially limits one \nor more major life activities, as defined in 28 C.F.R. § 35.108.   \n78.  At-Risk Individuals are Medicaid-eligible adults with physical disabilities, as defined in \n28 C.F.R. § 35.108, who need LTSS to avoid unnecessary nursing facility admission, and for \n16 \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538   Document 1   filed 09/29/23   USDC Colorado   pg 17 of 21\nwhom a State-contracted entity charged with long-term care service planning or information-\nsharing for older adults and people with disabilities has been contacted about nursing facility \nservices.   \n79.  If they were provided with access to LTSS in the community, many Institutionalized \nIndividuals could and would live in integrated, community-based settings, and At-Risk \nIndividuals could be relieved of the risk of unnecessary placement in nursing facilities.   \n80.  Institutionalized and At-Risk Individuals are qualified to receive community-based \nservices.  \n81.  Community-based services are appropriate for the vast majority of Institutionalized \nIndividuals.  An estimated 13 percent of Coloradans residing in nursing facilities have low care \nneeds, meaning they often require only a few hours of personal care services a day or each week \nto help with medication management, grooming, housekeeping, shopping, and meal preparation.  \nAnd community-based services are also appropriate to meet the needs of individuals who need \nmore intensive services to help toilet, transfer, bathe, eat, or breathe.   \n82.  The State has shown that it is possible to serve adults with physical disabilities in the \ncommunity.  For example, the State serves the majority of Coloradans with intellectual and \ndevelopmental disabilities in the community, including those with complex needs.  Further, most \nformer nursing facility residents who moved to the community live there successfully, and there \nis no reason to believe that the care needs of these former residents are atypical. \n83.  Community-based services are also appropriate for virtually all At-Risk Individuals, who \nalready live in the community.   \n17 \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538   Document 1   filed 09/29/23   USDC Colorado   pg 18 of 21\n84.  Many Institutionalized Individuals, if presented with individualized, realistic alternatives \nto nursing facility placement, would be interested in receiving services in community-based \nsettings.   \n85.  The State’s Strategic Action Planning Group on Aging has found “a clear desire by older \nColoradans for improved capacity to stay in their homes with the use of assistive services and \ntechnologies and in-home modifications.”  And a 2017 State survey revealed that 92 percent of \nformer nursing facility residents living in the community for 24 months liked where they lived, \ncompared with only 35 percent of individuals residing in facilities.  \n86.  Essentially all At-Risk Individuals, who already live in the community, would choose to \ncontinue receiving services in the community if the State improves access to those services. \nPROVIDING SERVICES IN INTEGRATED SETTINGS CAN BE ACCOMMODATED THROUGH \nREASONABLE MODIFICATIONS OF THE STATE’S EXISTING SERVICES. \n87.  Colorado can implement reasonable modifications that would enable many of its current \nnursing facility residents to transition to, and live successfully in, the community, and prevent \nthe serious risk of institutionalization for numerous other Coloradans with physical disabilities.   \n88.  Serving Institutionalized and At-Risk Individuals in the community is a cost-effective \nalternative to institutionalization.   \n89.  According to a 2023 State report, the average annual cost of community-based care for \nindividuals on the Elderly, Blind, and Disabled waiver is $30,401, while the cost of nursing \nfacility care averages $84,197 per year.  \n90.  Colorado has acknowledged in budget documents that nursing facility care costs more \nthan community integration, with “savings [] compound[ing] over time as more people are able \nto transition into community living.”   \n18 \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538   Document 1   filed 09/29/23   USDC Colorado   pg 19 of 21\n91.  The State could expand its capacity of community-based services to ensure their \nadequacy.  For example, the State could take steps to expand the direct care workforce, including \nin rural and frontier areas, and ensure effective contingency planning for when individual direct \ncare workers are unable to staff a shift as planned.  The State could also incentivize the \nproduction of affordable, accessible community-based housing available for Institutionalized and \nAt-Risk Individuals, and expand housing navigation, home modification, and tenancy support \nservices to connect Institutionalized and At-Risk Individuals to available units and help them \nmaintain tenancy.  \n92.  The State could also ensure that Institutionalized and At-Risk Individuals are fully \ninformed of their options in choosing between community-based services and nursing facility \nservices.   \n93.  The State can also ensure that all Institutionalized Individuals who do not oppose \ncommunity placement, and for whom such placement is appropriate, promptly transition to \ncommunity-based long-term care—for example, by streamlining eligibility determinations and \nprocessing times. \nVIOLATION OF TITLE II OF THE ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131–34 \n94.  The allegations of Paragraphs 1 through 93 of this Complaint are hereby realleged and \nincorporated by reference. \n95.  Defendant, the State of Colorado, is a public entity subject to Title II of the ADA, 42 \nU.S.C. § 12131(1). \n19 \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538   Document 1   filed 09/29/23   USDC Colorado   pg 20 of 21\n96.  The Institutionalized and At-Risk Individuals are persons with disabilities covered by \nTitle II of the ADA, and they are qualified to participate in the State’s services, programs, and \nactivities, including home and community-based services.  42 U.S.C. §§ 12102, 12131(2). \n97.  Community-based services are appropriate for the Institutionalized and At-Risk \nIndividuals, many of whom do not oppose community integration. \n98.  The State violates the ADA by administering its service system for individuals with \nphysical disabilities in a manner that fails to ensure the Institutionalized and At-Risk Individuals \nreceive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.  42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n99.  The State’s actions constitute discrimination in violation of Title II of the ADA, 42 \nU.S.C. § 12132, and its implementing regulation at 28 C.F.R. Part 35. \n100.  Providing services to the Institutionalized and At-Risk Individuals in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to their needs can be accomplished without fundamentally altering the State’s \nsystem of providing LTSS to Institutionalized and At-Risk Individuals.   \n101.  All conditions precedent to the filing of this Complaint have been satisfied.  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 9(c); 28 C.F.R. Part 35, Subpart F. \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nThe United States of America respectfully requests that the Court: \n(A)  Grant judgment in favor of the United States on its Complaint and declare that the State \nof Colorado has violated Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131–34, by failing to \nadminister its services, programs, and activities for the Institutionalized and At-Risk \nIndividuals in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.   \n \n20 \n\nCase No. 1:23-cv-02538   Document 1   filed 09/29/23   USDC Colorado   pg 21 of 21\n(B)  Enjoin the State of Colorado to: \n1.  cease discriminating against the Institutionalized and At-Risk Individuals, and \ninstead provide them appropriate, integrated community-based services consistent \nwith their individual needs; \n2.  take steps as may be necessary to prevent the recurrence of any discriminatory \nconduct in the future and to eliminate the effects of Defendant’s unlawful \nconduct. \n(C)  Order other appropriate relief as the interests of justice may require. \nDated: September 29, 2023  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n  KRISTEN CLARKE \n  Assistant Attorney General \n   \n  REBECCA B.
