    "summary": "<p>This case centers around Idaho&rsquo;s HB 500, which bans women and girls who are transgender and many women and girls who are intersex from participating in sports by requiring them to present proof of &ldquo;biological sex.&rdquo; On April 15, 2020, the plaintiffs in this case&mdash;a transgender college athlete at Boise State University (BSU) and a cisgender high school athlete who has been described by her classmates as &ldquo;masculine&rdquo;&mdash;brought this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Idaho against the government of Idaho, BSU, a school district in Boise, Idaho, and the members of the Idaho Code Commission. The plaintiffs in this case are represented by the ACLU of Idaho and private counsel. The complaint alleges that HB 500 discriminates against the plaintiffs because of their gender identity in violation of Title IX and of their equal protection and due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. The complaint further alleges that the government-compelled proof of &ldquo;biological sex&rdquo; constitutes an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Finally, the complaint alleges that HB 500 misleads and induces school officials and other actors into violating the constitution by failing to notify them that HB 500 is unconstitutional. The plaintiffs ask for attorneys&rsquo; fees and an injunction enjoining the government of Idaho and the Idaho schools from enforcing HB 500. This case was initially assigned to Judge Candy W. Dale but was quickly reassigned to Judge David C. Nye on May 6, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout the spring of 2020, the parties filed several key motions in this case. First, on April 30, 2020, plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction, asking that the court enjoin defendants from enforcing HB 500 while the case was pending. On May 26, 2020, two cisgender athletes at Idaho State University filed a motion to intervene. They argued that as cisgender women who had competed against a transgender woman the previous school year, they supported HB 500 and wanted their personal concerns represented in the case. Finally, on June 1, 2020, defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that plaintiffs lacked standing, that the case was not yet ripe because HB 500 had not yet prevented either plaintiff from competing in women&rsquo;s sports, and that plaintiffs&rsquo; facial challenge to HB 500 failed because it could be constitutionally enforced. On June 19, 2020, the United States Department of Justice, under the Trump administration, filed a Statement of Interest in the case, arguing that HB 500 was constitutional.</p>\r\n<p>On August 17, 2020, Judge Nye issued an opinion ruling on all three motions. The district court granted in part and denied in part defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss. On the one hand, the district court found that both plaintiffs had standing to bring this case, since both alleged disparate, less favorable treatment under the law on the basis of sex. Additionally, the court found that this case was ripe for judicial review because the questions presented in this case were primarily legal in nature and as such required little factual development to be ripe. Furthermore, the court found that should it withhold consideration, plaintiffs could suffer significant hardship because HB 500, if enforced, would have a direct effect on their daily lives. However, the court also acknowledged that facial challenges to a law are difficult to sustain, since the plaintiff must show that there are no circumstances under which the law could be constitutional. Because it has been found constitutional for the government to prohibit cisgender men from competing in women&rsquo;s sports, barring people from participating in women&rsquo;s sports based on sex is not unconstitutional in all circumstances. The district court therefore dismissed plaintiffs&rsquo; facial Fourteenth Amendment challenges, but the court did not dismiss plaintiffs&rsquo; as-applied Fourteenth Amendment challenges to the Act. 479 F.Supp.3d 930.</p>\r\n<p>Regarding the motion to intervene, the district court found that the cisgender athletes had cognizable and protectable interest in maintaining &ldquo;female-only competitions&rdquo; which could be impaired should plaintiffs prevail. As such, the court granted their motion to intervene. 479 F.Supp.3d 930.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the district court granted plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for preliminary injunction, finding that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their as applied Fourteenth Amendment challenges to HB 500. The court reasoned that defendants&rsquo; argument that HB 500 never used the term &ldquo;transgender&rdquo; and differentiated between students only on the basis of &ldquo;biological sex&rdquo; did &ldquo;not overcome the inescapable conclusion that the Act discriminate[d] on the basis of transgender status.&rdquo; Because HB 500 unconstitutionally discriminated against transgender women, Idaho needed to present an important government interest substantially related to HB 500. While plaintiffs did not dispute that promoting sex equality and providing opportunities for female athletes were important governmental interests, they argued that HB 500 was not substantially related to that interest. For the purposes of preliminary injunction, the court agreed with the plaintiffs. The district court found that there was no evidence on the record that allowing transgender women to compete in women&rsquo;s sports would displace cisgender women, and that there was in fact evidence that transgender athletes would not displace cisgender athletes in women&rsquo;s sports. Additionally, the court found that the terms of HB 500 itself reinforce the notion that the true interest of the state is to exclude transgender women and girls. Specifically, the act requires women athletes to present proof of &ldquo;biological sex,&rdquo; which can include reproductive anatomy, genetic makeup, or the level of testosterone the body produces without medical intervention. Based on this record, the court found the plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits of their equal protection claim, and as such enjoined defendants from enforcing HB 500 pending the outcome of this case. 479 F.Supp.3d 930.</p>\r\n<p>On September 16, 2020, the defendants and the intervenors appealed the district court&rsquo;s order to the Ninth Circuit (docket nos. 20-35813 and 20-35813). Over the next six months, interested groups and entities filed many amicus briefs arguing from both sides of the case, including states, women&rsquo;s rights groups, and LGBTQ+ rights groups.</p>\r\n<p>The Ninth Circuit remanded the case back to the district court on June 24, 2021 for the sole purpose of determining whether the claim of one of the plaintiffs&mdash;the transgender college athlete&mdash;was moot because she had withdrawn from BSU, although she intended to re-enroll in the winter of 2022. The trial court ruled on the issue on July 18, 2022, at which point the plaintiff had re-enrolled at BSU, played on the women&rsquo;s club soccer team, and intended to try out for the women&rsquo;s track and cross-country teams in the fall. As such, the trial court found that her claim was not moot, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed that decision on January 30, 2023. 2023 WL 1097255.</p>\r\n<p>On August 17, 2023, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the trial court&rsquo;s granting of preliminary injunction in a two-to-one decision with one justice concurring in part and dissenting in part. The majority followed the reasoning of the trial court, finding that the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims warranted heightened scrutiny, and as such, plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their equal protections claim. 79 F.4th 1009.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants and intervenors filed a petition for rehearing en banc, and their petitions are pending with the Ninth Circuit as of October 8, 2023.</p>",

Compl. ¶¶ 138-\n51, ECF No. 1.  Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on their equal-protection claim on \nApril 30.  Pls.’ Mem. in Support of Motion for Preliminary Inj. at 1, ECF No 22-1 (Br.).  The \nUnited States submits this Statement to aid this Court in its application of the Equal Protection \nClause in deciding the preliminary-injunction motion as well as in this case more generally.    \nINTRODUCTION \nIt is common ground that some sex-based classifications are constitutional because \ncertain “differences between men and women” are “enduring.”  Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533.  \nApplying this principle, the Ninth Circuit has held that the Equal Protection Clause permits an \nathletics policy that “preclude[s] boys from playing on girls’ teams, even though girls are \npermitted to participate on boys’ athletic teams” in light of the real biological differences \nbetween men and women.  Clark ex rel. Clark v. Arizona Interscholastic Ass’n, 695 F.2d 1126, \n1127 (9th Cir. 1982) (Clark I); see also Clark ex rel. Clark v. Arizona Interscholastic Ass’n, 886 \nF.2d 1191, 1192 (9th Cir. 1989) (Clark II) (same).   \n                                                 \n1 The Fairness Act does not go into effect until July 2020.  The United States’ citations refer to \nwhere the Act will appear in the Idaho statutory code.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 53   Filed 06/19/20   Page 3 of 16\nPlaintiffs neither challenge this precedent nor dispute that Idaho’s Fairness Act adopts the \nsame framework.  Instead, they appear to ask this Court to create an exception to this settled \nunderstanding of the Equal Protection Clause when the biological males who seek to participate \non a female-specific team identify as transgender.  But the Fairness Act is on all fours with the \npolicy the Ninth Circuit upheld in the Clark decisions, and nothing about an athlete’s transgender \nstatus requires a different result here.  The Equal Protection Clause does not require States to \nabandon their efforts to provide biological women with equal opportunity to compete for, and \nenjoy the life-long benefits that flow from, participation in school athletics in order to \naccommodate the team preferences of transgender athletes.  Put differently, the Constitution does \nnot require Idaho to provide the special treatment Plaintiffs request, under which biological \nmales are allowed to compete against biological females if and only if the biological males are \ntransgender.  \nSTATUTORY BACKGROUND \nIdaho’s Fairness Act contains two key substantive provisions.  First, covered athletic \nteams “shall be expressly designated as one (1) of the following based on biological sex: \n(a) Males, men, or boys; (b) Females, women, or girls; or (c) Coed or mixed.”  Idaho Code Ann. \n§ 33-6203(1).  Second, “[a]thletic teams or sports designated for females, women, or girls shall \nnot be open to students of the male sex.”  Id. § 33-6203(2).  The Fairness Act does not contain a \ncomparable limitation for biological females who wish to participate on a team designated for \nbiological males.  \nIn codified legislative findings, the Idaho Legislature explained why it was adopting the \nFairness Act.  Idaho Code Ann. § 33-6202.  Specifically, the Act explains:  “Having separate sex \nspecific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality.  Sex-specific teams accomplish this by \nproviding opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their skill, strength, and athletic \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 53   Filed 06/19/20   Page 4 of 16\nabilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain recognition and accolades, \ncollege scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that flow from success in \nathletic endeavors.”  Id. § 33-6202(12).  In support of this conclusion, the Act cites authority \nestablishing that inherent physiological differences between men and women generally include a \ndifference in “strength, speed, and endurance” that results in “different athletic capabilities,” \nwhich generally give men a significant advantage in head-to-head competition.  Id. § 33-\n6202(1)-(10) (citations omitted).  In addition, the Act’s findings reference a 2019 study that \nconcluded biological males retain their athletic performance advantage over biological females \neven after engaging in hormone treatments that attempt to diminish a biological male’s natural \ntestosterone.  Id. § 33-6202(11) (citing Tommy Lundberg et al., Muscle strength, size and \ncomposition following 12 months of gender-affirming treatment in transgender individuals: \nretained advantage for the transwomen, Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26, 2019)).   \nDISCUSSION \nIdaho’s Fairness Act Complies with the Equal Protection Clause. \nA.  The Equal Protection Clause Does Not Prohibit States From Generally Requiring \nSeparate Athletic Teams For Biological Females And Biological Males. \nThe Equal Protection Clause allows Idaho to recognize the average physiological \ndifferences between the biological sexes in athletics.  Because of these differences, the Fairness \nAct’s limiting of certain athletic teams to biological females provides equal protection because \nthe limitation is based on the same exact interest that allows the creation of sex-segregated \nathletic teams in the first place—namely, the goal of ensuring that biological females have equal \nathletic opportunities.  Plaintiffs’ arguments to the contrary directly conflict with Ninth Circuit \nprecedent.  Indeed, the Ninth Circuit’s Clark decisions upheld athletic policies that were \nmaterially indistinguishable from the Fairness Act. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 53   Filed 06/19/20   Page 5 of 16\n1.  The Equal Protection Clause provides that a State cannot “deny to any person \nwithin its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.  The \nClause “is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.”  City \nof Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985).  The converse, of course, is that \nStates may treat differently situated persons differently.  And for sex-based classifications, the \nSupreme Court has recognized that “the sexes are not similarly situated in certain \ncircumstances.”  Michael M. v. Superior Court, 450 U.S. 464, 469 (1981) (plurality opinion).  \nNotably, “[p]hysical differences between men and women . . . are enduring,” and the “two sexes \nare not fungible.”  Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533 (citation omitted).   \nAccordingly, the Ninth Circuit has repeatedly rejected equal-protection challenges to an \nathletics policy that “preclude[d] boys from playing on girls’ teams, even though girls are \npermitted to participate on boys’ athletic teams.”  Clark I, 695 F.2d at 1127; see also Clark II, \n886 F.2d at 1192.  In upholding one such policy that prohibited biological males from \nparticipating on volleyball teams limited to biological females, the Ninth Circuit explained that \n“due to average physiological differences” between the sexes, “males would displace females to \na substantial extent if they were allowed to compete for positions on the [female] team” and \n“athletic opportunities for women would be diminished.”  Clark I, 695 F.2d at 1131; see also \nClark II, 886 F.2d at 1192 (reaffirming this conclusion).    \n2.  In light of this background, the substantive provisions of Idaho’s Fairness Act \neasily comply with the Equal Protection Clause.  Even assuming arguendo that these provisions \ntrigger intermediate scrutiny—on the theory that they permit only biological females (and not \nbiological males) to participate on teams designated for the opposite sex, see Br. 16—they \nreadily withstand this form of review.  To survive this standard, Idaho must show only that the \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 53   Filed 06/19/20   Page 6 of 16\nalleged sex discrimination “serves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory \nmeans employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.”  Virginia, 518 \nU.S. at 524 (citation and quotation marks omitted).  Plaintiffs’ Motion does not dispute that the \nobjective of the Fairness Act—“promot[ing] sex equality” through “[s]ex-specific teams” that \n“provid[e] opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their skill, strength, and athletic \nabilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain recognition and accolades, \ncollege scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that flow from success in \nathletic endeavors”—is an important governmental objective.  Idaho Code Ann. § 33-6202(12); \nsee Br. 17.  Nor could it, given that the Ninth Circuit has already held that “[t]here is no \nquestion” that “promoting equality of athletic opportunity between the sexes” is an “important \ngovernmental interest.”  Clark I, 695 F.2d at 1131; see also Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533 (“Sex \nclassifications may be used to” promote “equal employment opportunity,” and “to advance full \ndevelopment of the talent and capacities of our Nation’s people.”) (citations omitted).  Instead, \nPlaintiffs contend only that the Fairness Act’s alleged sex classification is “not substantially \nrelated” to this undeniably important goal.  Br. 17.  Each of their arguments lacks merit. \nFirst, Plaintiffs contend that Idaho could use “circulating testosterone levels” as a better \nproxy for physical ability than biological sex.  Br. 18.  But even assuming that premise were \ntrue,2 the Ninth Circuit has already held that biological sex is a constitutionally acceptable proxy \n                                                 \n2 Here, the Idaho Legislature found otherwise.  In its findings, the Act explains:  “The benefits \nthat natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished through the use of puberty \nblockers and cross-sex hormones.  A recent study on the impact of such treatments found that \neven ‘after 12 months of hormonal therapy,’ a man who identifies as a woman and is taking \ncross-sex hormones ‘had an absolute advantage’ over female athletes and ‘will still likely have \nperformance benefits’ over women.”  Idaho Code Ann. § 33-6202(11) (quoting Tommy \nLundberg et al., Muscle strength, size and composition following 12 months of gender-affirming \ntreatment in transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen, Karolinksa \nInstitutet (Sept. 26, 2019)).  Plaintiffs never address this study in their Motion. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 53   Filed 06/19/20   Page 7 of 16\nthat satisfies intermediate scrutiny’s “substantially related” requirement.  In Clark I, the Ninth \nCircuit explained that with respect to “average physiological differences,” “there is no question \nthat the Supreme Court allows for these average real differences between the sexes to be \nrecognized or that they allow gender to be used as a proxy in this sense if it is an accurate \nproxy”—even if biological sex is not a perfect proxy in every case.  695 F.2d at 1131.   \nIn fact, the Ninth Circuit expressly rejected the argument Plaintiffs advance here—\nnamely, that the “substantially related” requirement demands that participation on athletic teams \n“be limited on the basis of specific physical characteristics other than sex.”  Id.  Although the \ncourt of appeals knew that a “sexual classification could be avoided by classifying directly on the \nbasis of physical differences such as height or weight,” for example, id. at 1130, it explained that \n“[t]he existence of these alternatives shows only that the exclusion of boys is not necessary to \nachieve the desired goal.”  Id. at 1131.  And given that “absolute necessity is not required before \na gender based classification can be sustained” under intermediate scrutiny, “even the existence \nof wiser alternatives than the one chosen does not serve to invalidate the policy here since it is \nsubstantially related to the goal.”  Id. at 1131-32.  Thus, even if Plaintiffs believe that the \nFairness Act “may not maximize equality,” the Equal Protection Clause entitles Idaho to make \n“trade-offs between equality and practicality” under intermediate scrutiny.  Id.  Accordingly, \nPlaintiffs’ lengthy discussion of circulating testosterone levels (Br. 17-19) is beside the point.    \nSecond, Plaintiffs assert (Br. 19-20) that the premise that biological males “are physically \nsuperior” to biological females is a “paternalistic” “sexual stereotype.”  Again, Clark I forecloses \nthis assertion.  The Ninth Circuit specifically held that the exclusion of biological males from \nteams designated for biological females did not rest on “archaic and overbroad’ generalizations,” \n“sexual stereotypes,” “invidious discrimination against women,” “or stigmatization of women.”  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 53   Filed 06/19/20   Page 8 of 16\n695 F.2d at 1131 (citations omitted).  Rather, that exclusion “simply recogniz[ed] the \nphysiological fact that males would have an undue advantage competing against women.”  Id.  \nIndeed, the Supreme Court itself engaged in similar reasoning in Virginia when it observed that \nadmitting women to a previously all-male military academy “would undoubtedly require” that \ninstitution “to adjust aspects of the physical training programs.”  518 U.S. at 550 n.19.  And, the \nFourth Circuit took the same approach in Bauer v. Lynch, 812 F.3d 340 (4th Cir. 2016), when it \nexplained:  “Men and women simply are not physiologically the same for the purposes of \nphysical fitness programs.  The Supreme Court recognized as much in its discussion of the \nphysical training programs addressed in the [Virginia] litigation.”  Id. at 350.    \nMoreover, if Plaintiffs were correct that the Equal Protection Clause prevented \nrecognizing these physiological differences, then Idaho (and every other State) would be \nconstitutionally compelled to maintain only co-ed teams and sports—a situation that would \nobviously harm women.  Indeed, the Ninth Circuit considered and rejected the same assertion \nbecause such a scheme would diminish opportunities for girls and women:  It is “clear” that \n“males would displace females to a substantial extent” and thus “athletic opportunities for \nwomen would be diminished.”  Clark I, 695 F.2d at 1131. \nThird, Plaintiffs urge (Br. 20-21) that the Fairness Act deprives biological males who \nwish to participate on female-only teams of various “benefits” associated with “school \nathletics”—namely, the availability of a forum for “students to develop skills, make friends, \nincrease physical activity, and learn valuable life lessons.”  That is simply false, however, as the \nFairness Act in no way deprives biological males who are transgender of those benefits, but \nrather simply requires them to obtain those benefits on a male-only or co-ed team, just as \nbiological males who are not transgender must do.  Indeed, for that reason, this is a far easier \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 53   Filed 06/19/20   Page 9 of 16\ncase than in Clark, where the male plaintiffs had no ability whatsoever “to participate on their \nhigh school volleyball teams” because “[t]heir schools only sponsor[ed] interscholastic \nvolleyball teams for girls.”  Clark I, 695 F.2d at 1127; see also Clark II, 886 F.2d at 1192 \n(same).  The policy in the Clark cases obviously deprived those plaintiffs of the “benefits” \nassociated with “school athletics” in the particular sport of their choice, but the Ninth Circuit still \nupheld the policy as substantially related to an important interest, given that those plaintiffs \ncould participate in many other sports (including some not available to women).  See Clark II, \n886 F.2d at 1193 (noting that at the plaintiff’s school, biological females were not permitted to \ncompete on the wrestling team); Clark I, 695 F.2d at 1131 (explaining that in the plaintiffs’ \nsituation, “boys’ overall opportunity” for athletic participation was “not inferior to girls’”).  \nPlaintiffs here need not even choose a different sport; they simply must play on the team that \ncorresponds to their biological sex, just like everyone else. \nAs the Clark cases confirm, the Equal Protection Clause permits Idaho to ensure equal \nathletic opportunities for girls and women by limiting some athletic competitions and teams to \nbiological females.  As part of ensuring equal opportunities, Idaho may prevent biological \n“males [from] displac[ing] females.”  Clark I, 695 F.2d at 1131.  Plaintiffs have not provided and \ncannot provide any explanation for why the Equal Protection Clause entitles transgender athletes \nto these benefits at the expense of their biological female peers.  \nB.  An Athlete’s Transgender Status Does Not Change The Analysis. \nGiven the discussion above, Plaintiffs do not (and cannot) seriously maintain that every \nbiological male has a constitutional right to participate on athletic teams limited to biological \nfemales.  Instead, Plaintiffs appear to ask this Court to create an exception to equal-protection \nprecedent for biological males who identify as transgender.  But an athlete’s transgender status \ndoes not alter the equal-protection analysis here.  Refusing to provide a special exemption for \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 53   Filed 06/19/20   Page 10 of 16\nbiological males if and only if they are transgender is hardly a denial of equal protection on the \nbasis of sex, especially when such an exemption would harm biological females.  Rather, \nPlaintiffs’ requested special exemption would actually require Idaho to engage in discrimination \non the basis of gender identity, by compelling the State to discriminate against biological males \nwhose gender identity reflects their biological sex.  \n1.  To start, Plaintiffs cannot evade the Ninth Circuit’s Clark decisions by claiming \nthat it is “unlikely that significant numbers” of biologically male transgender individuals will \n“ever participate in athletics in Idaho, let alone displace” female athletes, particularly with \nrespect to scholarship opportunities.  Br. 23.  Even assuming that this speculative assertion were \ntrue, it would get Plaintiffs nowhere.  The equal-protection analysis in the Clark decisions does \nnot turn on whether biological males displace biological females across the board or only at the \nmargins.  Contra Br. 20 n.15 (contending that under Clark I, female athletes must be displaced \n“‘to a substantial extent’” for a policy to survive intermediate scrutiny).  Notably, in Clark II, the \nNinth Circuit upheld the exclusion of a single male from the women’s volleyball team on the \nground that “[i]f males are permitted to displace females on the school volleyball team even to \nthe extent of one player like Clark, the goal of equal participation by females in interscholastic \nathletics is set back.”  886 F.2d at 1193 (emphasis added).  That holding was consistent with the \nanalysis in Clark I, where the Ninth Circuit explained that even though schools could allow \n“boys’ participation . . . in limited numbers” while still preserving athletic opportunities for \nwomen, the Equal Protection Clause did not prohibit the categorical exclusion of biological \nmales from teams limited to biological females.  695 F.2d at 1131. \n  Adopting Plaintiffs’ desired exception also would considerably weaken the \njustification—plainly viewed as legitimate by the Ninth Circuit—for excluding biological males \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 53   Filed 06/19/20   Page 11 of 16\nwho identify as male from female-specific teams.  After all, Plaintiffs have not identified any \nnon-transgender biological male who wishes to participate on female-only teams.  Nor have \nPlaintiffs provided any reason to believe that the population of non-transgender biological males \nwho wish to participate on female-only teams, whether in Idaho or elsewhere, is a substantial \none.  Yet the displacement of even some biological females from school athletics, and from all of \nthe educational benefits that flow from such participation, would have real consequences for \nthose women and for the ability of government to remedy past discrimination against women in \nathletic educational opportunities and “to advance full development of” their talents and \ncapacities.  Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533. \nMoreover, to create Plaintiffs’ proposed transgender exception, this Court would have to \norder Idaho to engage in discrimination on the basis of gender identity.  Specifically, Plaintiffs \nwould have this Court allow only those biological males who identify as female to participate on \nfemale-specific teams.  Under those circumstances, Idaho would be denying non-transgender \nbiological males (such as the Clark plaintiffs) the same opportunity solely because their gender \nidentity reflected their biological sex.  That penalty would be in addition to the penalty imposed \non non-transgender biological females who are displaced from their teams by biological males.         \n2.  Plaintiffs fare no better in repeatedly contending that the Fairness Act \ndiscriminates on the basis of transgender status.  The Fairness Act’s substantive provisions do \nnot even mention a student’s transgender status or gender identity, much less draw classifications \non those bases.  Idaho Code Ann. § 33-6203(1), (2).  Indeed, Plaintiffs complain that the Act \ndoes “not permit consideration of gender identity.”  Br. 4.  Instead, the Fairness Act’s substantive \nprovisions draw permissible classifications based on biological sex.  Idaho Code Ann. § 33-\n6203(1), (2).  The provisions prohibit all biological males from participating on a team \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 53   Filed 06/19/20   Page 12 of 16\ndesignated for biological females, regardless of whether those biological males are transgender \nor not.  Id.  Likewise, the provisions treat all biological females the same, regardless of whether \nthose biological females are transgender or not.  Id.  An athlete’s transgender status and gender \nidentity are irrelevant.  \nThe Fairness Act therefore does not, as Plaintiffs contend, exclude students from \nparticipating in sports “for no other reason than because they are transgender.”  Br. 21.  Despite \nPlaintiffs’ repeated declaration (e.g., Br. 1, 4, 10, 12) that the Act “categorically” “bars” all \ntransgender athletes who identify as female from competing in any athletic activities, no such bar \nexists.  Transgender athletes are permitted under the Act to compete in any athletic activities \nconsistent with their biological sex.  While the United States does not doubt the personal \nobjection that some transgender athletes who identify as female may have to competing on male \nteams—though, under the Fairness Act, such teams are open to all biological males and all \nbiological females—this personal objection does not transform the Fairness Act into a \ncategorical bar.  Transgender athletes retain the option of participating on teams that align with \ntheir biological sex or co-ed teams.   \nEven if the requirement that athletes participate on the teams that align with their \nbiological sex were to have a disparate impact on transgender individuals, it is blackletter law \nthat such an effect does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.  As the Supreme Court has \nrepeatedly explained, “the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees equal laws, not equal results.”  \nPersonnel Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 273 (1979).  For this reason, the Supreme \nCourt in Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976), explained that “our cases have not embraced \nthe proposition that a law or other official act, without regard to whether it reflects a racially \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 53   Filed 06/19/20   Page 13 of 16\ndiscriminatory purpose, is unconstitutional solely because it has a racially disproportionate \nimpact.”  Id. at 239.    \nThus, while Plaintiffs may dislike that the Fairness Act does “not permit consideration of \ngender identity,” Br. 4—and thus does not exempt transgender athletes from the ordinary rule—\nthe Equal Protection Clause guarantees equal treatment, not special treatment. \nContrary to Plaintiffs’ assertion, Karnoski v. Trump, 926 F.3d 1180 (9th Cir. 2019), did \nnot unsettle that basic principle by holding that a “policy forcing people to serve in the military \nconsistent with ‘biological sex’ amounted to discrimination based on transgender status.”  Br. 14.  \nRather, the Ninth Circuit concluded only that the challenged policy “on its face treats \ntransgender persons differently than other persons” based on its belief that the policy required \nonly “[t]ransgender persons”—as opposed to all servicemembers—to “serve in their biological \nsex.”  926 F.3d at 1201 (ellipsis omitted).  In fact, the court in Karnoski stated that “[b]ecause the \n2018 Policy discriminates on the basis of transgender status on its face, we need not address \nwhether” facial discrimination on the basis of “gender dysphoria and transition” “constitutes \ndiscrimination against transgender persons.”  926 F.3d at 1201 n.18.  That express reservation \nwould have been unnecessary if, as Plaintiffs maintain, Karnoski had held that any facially \nneutral requirement that all individuals adhere to the standards associated with their biological \nsex invariably constitutes discrimination based on transgender status.   \nSuch a holding also would have put the Ninth Circuit at odds with the D.C. Circuit, \nwhich held that the same military policy did not constitute “a blanket transgender ban” simply \nbecause it required servicemembers “to serve in their biological sex.”  Doe 2 v. Shanahan, 755 \nFed. Appx. 19, 24 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (per curiam).  As the D.C. Circuit explained, “not all \ntransgender persons seek to transition to their preferred gender”; rather, the typical definition of \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 53   Filed 06/19/20   Page 14 of 16\n“transgender persons”—including the one offered by Plaintiffs—is simply those individuals who \n“‘identify[]’ with a gender other than their biological sex.”  Id.; see also Br. 2 n.1 (“A \ntransgender person has a gender identity that does not align with the sex they were assigned at \nbirth.”).  As multiple sources confirm, “the transgender community is not a monolith in which \nevery person wants to take steps necessary to live in accord with his or her preferred gender \n(rather than his or her biological sex).”  Doe 2 v. Shanahan, 917 F.3d 694, 722 (D.C. Cir. 2019) \n(Williams, J., concurring in result) (collecting evidence); see also id. at 701 (Wilkins, J., \nconcurring) (noting “the term transgender is often defined to include persons who identify with \nanother gender but who do not wish to live or work in accordance with that preferred gender”).   \nNor does the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Bostock v. Clayton Cty., Georgia, No. \n17-1618, 2020 WL 3146686 (U.S. June 15, 2020), alter the equal-protection analysis here.  First, \nBostock said nothing about and did not consider anything about the Constitution.  See id. at *17 \n(warning that “[t]he only question before us is whether an employer who fires someone simply \nfor being homosexual or transgender has discharged or otherwise discriminated against that \nindividual ‘because of such individual’s sex’” as that term is used in a particular provision of \nTitle VII).  Second, nothing in the Fairness Act discriminates on the basis of transgender status, \nso even assuming arguendo that Bostock had any relevance in a constitutional case, it would not \nhelp Plaintiffs.    \nIn sum, the Fairness Act neither bars transgender athletes from competing in school \nathletics nor draws distinctions based on transgender status or gender identity.  Instead, it draws \ndistinctions solely based on biological sex, restricting all biological males from participating on \nathletic teams designated for biological females.  And it does so in the same way and for the \nsame purpose the Ninth Circuit recognized as valid in Clark I—“to promot[e] equality of athletic \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 53   Filed 06/19/20   Page 15 of 16\nopportunity between the sexes.”  695 F.2d at 1131.  Plaintiffs’ challenge to the Act under the \nEqual Protection Clause must fail. \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should find that the substantive provisions of Idaho’s Fairness Act comply \nwith the Equal Protection Clause. \n                  Respectfully submitted,  \n \nBART M.

INTRODUCTION \nOn June 24, 2021, the Ninth Circuit remanded the appeal by the Defendants and \nIntervenors to this Court for the limited purpose of determining whether Plaintiff Lindsay \nHecox’s claim is moot in light of her changed enrollment status at Boise State University \n(“BSU”).1 Dkt. 79. Although it otherwise retained jurisdiction over the appeal, the Ninth \n \n1 The Ninth Circuit noted that the parties have agreed Plaintiff Jane Doe’s claim is now moot because she \nhas graduated from high school and is attending college out of state. Dkt. 79, at 1 n. 1. While the remand \nissue was pending, the parties stipulated to the dismissal of the Defendants against whom solely Doe’s \nclaims were asserted. Dkt. 104. The parties agreed the stipulated dismissal should not extend to the Court’s \nmemorandum decision. Id. at ¶ 4. However, the Ninth Circuit remanded to this Court solely to decide \nwhether Plaintiff Lindsay Hecox’s claim is moot. The Ninth Circuit did not itself dismiss Doe’s claims (or \ndirect this Court to do so) and also retained jurisdiction over Defendants and the Intervenors’ appeal. As \nsuch, the Court finds dismissing all claims in this case against the Independent School District of Boise \nCity #1, Coby Dennis, and members of the Independent School District of Boise City #1, would exceed the \nORDER –  1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 2 of 25\nCircuit directed this Court to “develop the record, resolve any factual disputes, and apply \nthe required caution and care to the initial mootness determination.” Dkt. 79, at 4. As \ndetailed below, the parties have submitted supplemental briefs and stipulated facts with \nrespect to the mootness issue. \nHaving reviewed the record, the Court determines the parties have adequately \npresented the facts and legal arguments in their briefs. Accordingly, in the interest of \navoiding delay, and because the Court conclusively finds that the decisional process would \nnot be significantly aided by oral argument, the Court decides the mootness issue on the \nrecord and without oral argument.2 Dist. Idaho Loc. Civ. R. 7.1(d)(1)(B). \n  For the reasons set forth below, the Court holds Hecox’s claim is not moot. \nII. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n  On March 30, 2020, Idaho Governor Bradley Little signed the Fairness in Women’s \nSports Act (the “Act”) into law. Idaho Code § 33-6201 et seq.3 Plaintiff Lindsay Hecox, a \ntransgender woman, was then in her freshman year at BSU. The Act excludes transgender \nwomen students from participating on women’s school athletic teams. Idaho Code § 33-\n6203(2).  \nOn April 15, 2020, Hecox filed this lawsuit to challenge the Act’s constitutionality. \nIn her Complaint, Hecox alleged she is a life-long runner who intended to try out for BSU’s \n \nlimited scope of the remand order, and declines to dismiss either the aforementioned Defendants, or Doe’s \nclaim, at this stage of the litigation. \n \n2 The parties informally advised the Court that they do not believe an evidentiary hearing is required.  \n \n3 The Act went into effect on July 1, 2020. Id. \n  \nORDER –  2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 3 of 25\nwomen’s cross-country team and track teams during her Fall 2020 semester, but that she \nwas barred from doing so under the Act. Dkt. 1, ¶ 33. Hecox also alleged that the Act barred \nher from participating in college athletics at all. Id., ¶ 38.4 \nOn August 17, 2020, this Court preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the Act, \nholding, inter alia, that Hecox was likely to succeed on the merits of her claim that the Act \nviolates the Equal Protection Clause. See generally, Dkt. 63.5 Defendants and Intervenors \nappealed the Court’s preliminary injunction.  \nIn  her  briefing  on  appeal,  Hecox  informed  the  Ninth  Circuit  of  relevant \ndevelopments since Defendants and Intervenors noticed their appeal on September 16, \n2020. Specifically, Hecox notified the Ninth Circuit that with the Act enjoined, she was \npermitted to try out for the BSU’s women’s cross-country and track teams during her Fall \n2020 semester,6 but did not make the teams, and had subsequently withdrawn from BSU. \nHecox advised the Ninth Circuit that she planned to re-enroll at BSU in January 2022, after \nachieving in-state residency. Dkt. 79, at 2. Members of the Ninth Circuit panel asked \n \n4 Although Hecox could still participate on men’s college athletics under the Act, Hecox alleged in her \nComplaint that competing on a men’s team is not an option for her. Id., ¶ 36. Hecox explained as a woman \nwho is transgender, “it would be painful and humiliating to be forced to be the only woman on a men’s \nteam.” Id. Hecox alleged playing on a men’s team would also be contrary to her “medical treatment plan \nfor gender dysphoria, which requires that she live her life in all respects as the woman she is.” Id. Finally, \nHecox alleged she feared harassment from other members of the men’s team or competitors if she was \nforced to compete on a men’s team. Id. \n \n5 The Court recognizes that Defendants have not yet disclosed experts or submitted evidence on the issue \nof whether transgender women athletes have an unfair advantage over biological females. However, the \ndelay in resolving the merits of Hecox’s claim is due to the interlocutory appeal, and not to the Court’s \npreliminary injunction. \n \n6 Tryouts for walk-on athletes for the women’s track and cross-country teams occur once a year during the \nfall semester. Dkt. 92, ¶ 13. \nORDER –  3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 4 of 25\nquestions during oral argument about whether Hecox’s claim was moot because she was \nnot then enrolled at BSU, and ordered supplemental briefing on the issue. After finding the \nsupplemental briefing “served only to raise further questions,” the Ninth Circuit remanded \nto this Court for “the limited purpose of  determining whether Lindsay Hecox’s claim is \nmoot in light of her changed enrollment status at BSU.”  Id. at 3. \nThe  Ninth  Circuit  identified  several  questions  to  aid  this  Court’s  mootness \ndetermination, including:  \n(1) “Is Hecox still an admitted student who can re-enroll at BSU whenever she \ndesires, or are there barriers to re-enrollment?” \n(2)  “Does  she  have  evidence  of  savings,  discussions  with  administrators,  or \nanything else that shows a concrete plan to re-enroll?” \n(3) What was “the Fall deadline for dropping classes[,] and the penalty for dropping \nout after that deadline?”; \n(4) Would Hecox “be eligible to play for BSU if she re-enrolled and made the \nteam”? \n(5) “[D]oes the fact that she withdrew from classes before the deadline to drop \nclasses impact her status for NCAA eligibility purposes?” \n(6) Has the “NCAA created any COVID-related exceptions to its requirements that \napply to Hecox?” \n(7) “[I]f Hecox is not eligible to play on the NCAA teams or does not make those \nteams, are there BSU women’s club teams that she plans to join instead?” \nDkt. 79, at 3–4. \nORDER –  4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 5 of 25\nTwo business days after the Ninth Circuit issued its June 24, 2021 Remand Order \n(“Remand Order”), this Court’s law clerk contacted the parties to establish a plan and \nschedule for the remand proceedings. It took the parties another month, until July 27, 2021, \nto reach an agreement to informally exchange information, to thereafter provide the Court \nwith stipulated facts responsive to the Ninth Circuit’s questions, and to brief the mootness \nissue in light of such facts.  \nThree  months  after  the  parties  reached  the  agreement,  the  parties  submitted \nstipulated facts in response to the Remand Order. Dkt. 92. After a subsequent unopposed \nMotion for Extension of time, the parties submitted briefing, and the remand issue became \nripe on December 3, 2021.  \nGiven its significant case load7 and a backlog of criminal cases due to the COVID-\n19 pandemic, the Court was unable to immediately address the parties’ submissions. As \nsuch, on March 16, 2022, the Court ordered the parties to submit supplemental stipulated \nfacts. Dkt. 101. The Court directed the parties to specifically update the Court on: (1) the \nstatus of Hecox’s enrollment at BSU; (2) if she was enrolled at BSU, how many credits \nHecox was taking and whether she was still attending such classes; (3) whether Hecox had \njoined and was playing for the BSU Women’s club soccer team; and (4) whether Hecox \nstill intends to try out of the BSU Women’s cross-country and track teams in the Fall 2022 \nsemester. Id. \n \n7 The undersigned is the only active judge in Idaho. The only senior judge is still taking a full load of cases, \nbut was on a sabbatical in March and April, 2022, and has been presiding over a months-long criminal trial \nsince May, 2022.   \n \nORDER –  5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 6 of 25\nThe parties filed Supplemental Stipulated Facts on April 13, 2022. Dkt. 102.  \nIII. FACTUAL FINDINGS8 \nHaving carefully reviewed the record on remand, the Court makes the following \nfindings with respect to the issues outlined in the Remand Order.  \nA. Barriers to Re-Enrollment \nHecox’s withdrawal from classes during the Fall 2020 semester did not pose a  \nbarrier to enrolling in classes at BSU in the Spring 2022 semester. Hecox is enrolled at \nBSU and took 9 credits during the Spring 2022 semester.  \nB. Discussions with Administrators,  Evidence of Savings, and Concrete Plans \nto Re-enroll \n \nPrior to the Spring 2022 semester, Hecox met with Joshua Wilkins in the BSU \nRegistrar’s Office to discuss her plans to establish in-state residency before returning to \nBSU. On November 18, 2020, Wilkins advised Hecox via email that she could establish \nIdaho residency by proving that she had worked full-time for 12 months and by filing an \nIdaho tax return. When the parties filed stipulated facts on October 15, 2021, Hecox had \nbeen working full-time in Idaho since December 2020, had filed an Idaho state tax return, \nand planned to file Idaho state tax returns in the future.  \nHecox registered for 9 credits of courses for the Spring 2022 semester. Hecox \nsubsequently qualified for in-state tuition at BSU of approximately $4,030.00 per semester.  \n \n8 Unless otherwise referenced, the following facts are taken from the parties’ October 15, 2021 Stipulated \nFacts and/or from their April 13, 2022 Supplemental Stipulated Facts. Dkt. 92; Dkt. 102. \nORDER –  6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 7 of 25\nAs of September 23, 2021, Hecox had $23,949.27 available for tuition, textbooks, living \nexpenses, and other costs associated with attending BSU in her bank account. Hecox also \napplied for financial aid, anticipated receiving some support from family members, and \napplied for the Pride Foundation Scholarship.9 \nC. Fall 2020 Deadlines for Dropping Classes and Associated Penalties \nThere were two relevant deadlines for withdrawing from classes in the Fall 2020  \nsemester at BSU. The first deadline was September 4, 2020. Students who withdrew from \nclasses by that deadline had nothing recorded on their transcript related to the withdrawal \nand received a tuition refund. The second deadline was October 30, 2020. Students who \nwithdrew from classes by that deadline had a “W” marked on their transcript for dropped \nclasses and did not receive a tuition refund. Students who withdrew from classes after \nOctober 30, 2020 had an “F” marked on their transcript for dropped classes. A “W” would \nnot affect the student’s GPA, but an “F” would affect the student’s GPA.  \nHecox withdrew from some of her classes on October 26, 2020, and from the  \nremainder of her classes on October 28, 2020. She received “Ws” on her transcript, but \nwithdrew early enough from all of her classes to avoid having any “Fs” on her transcript. \nHecox did not receive a tuition refund, and she had to repay $793.00 of her Pell Grant. \nD. NCCA Eligibility10 \n \n9 In their Supplemental Stipulated Facts, the parties did not address whether Hecox ultimately received \nfinancial aid, financial assistance from her family, or the Pride Foundation Scholarship for the Spring 2022 \nsemester. \n \n10 Hecox retained an expert witness, Ellen Staurowsky, to offer an expert opinion on the NCAA’s eligibility \nrules. Dkt. 99-2.  \nORDER –  7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 8 of 25\nIn her Fall 2022 semester, Hecox will be considered a third-year student for  \npurposes of NCAA eligibility because she will have attended classes in four previous \nsemesters (Fall 2019, Spring 2020, Fall 2020, and Spring 2022). NCAA Bylaw 14.4.3.2 \nrequires a student-athlete to complete 40% of the requirements for their degree program by \nthe start of the student-athlete’s third year of collegiate enrollment. During her Fall 2020 \nsemester, Hecox selected psychology as her degree program. A psychology major at BSU \nrequires 120 credits. To satisfy the minimum number of credits to complete 40% of her \ndegree program, Hecox would need to earn a total of 48 credits by the end of her Spring \n2022 semester. Hecox has earned 24 credits at BSU, received 18 credits based on her SAT \nand AP test scores in high school, and was enrolled in 9 credits during the Spring 2022 \nsemester. Hecox has accordingly completed 51 credits, and has satisfied NCAA Bylaw \n14.4.3.2. \nNCAA Bylaw 14.01.2.1 requires a student-athlete to be in good academic  \nstanding. An undergraduate at BSU is deemed to be in good academic standing if they have \nearned a minimum of a 1.75 cumulative grade point average while earning between 0 to 25 \nacademic credits, or a minimum of a 2.00 cumulative grade point average while earning 26 \nor more academic credits. As of October 15, 2021, Hecox’s cumulative grade point average \nwas 3.38. Although her Spring 2022 grades are not before the Court, Hecox would still \nmeet the 2.0 minimum grade point average required to be in good academic standing even \nif she received a 1.0 for the Spring 2022 semester. \nNCAA Bylaw 14.4.3.1(c) requires a student athlete to complete 6 credit hours  \nORDER –  8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 9 of 25\nduring the semester preceding the competition. Hecox was enrolled in 9 credit hours during \nthe Spring 2022 semester, and has met NCAA Bylaw 14.4.3.1(c). \nNCAA Bylaw 14.4.3.1(b) requires a student athlete to complete 18 credit  \nhours since the beginning of the previous fall term, or since the beginning of BSU’s \npreceding two semesters. Because she has completed 9 credits since the beginning of the \nFall 2021 term, as well as since the beginning of the preceding two semesters (Spring 2022 \nand Fall 2021), Hecox does not meet this standard.  \nHowever, NCAA Bylaw 14.4.3.6(a) provides a student athlete “may” qualify for a \none-time exception to NCAA Bylaw 14.4.3.1(b). This exception allows a student athlete \nwho has withdrawn from school to complete a prorated requirement of 9 credits per term \nof actual attendance. Hecox completed 24 credits at BSU prior to the Spring 2022 semester. \nAlthough she took an additional 9 credits during the Spring 2022 semester, Hecox cannot \nsatisfy the 14.4.3.6(a) exception for the Fall 2022 semester because she has 33 total \ncredits—3 credits short of the 36 she would need to have 9 credits for each of her four \nterms of actual attendance. \nNCAA  Bylaw  14.4.3.6(b)  provides  that  a  student  athlete  “may”  qualify  for  a \nseparate exception to Bylaws 14.4.3.1(b) if the student was not recruited, did not receive \nathletically  related  financial  assistance,  has  never  practiced  or  participated  in \nintercollegiate athletics, and is otherwise eligible under all institutional, conference, and \nNCAA rules. Hecox was not recruited and has not received athletically related financial \nassistance. However, it appears she has played intercollegiate athletics because she now \nORDER –  9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 10 of 25\nplays for the women’s club soccer team.11 As such, it appears that Hecox cannot qualify \nfor the 14.4.3.6(b) exception.  \nIf Hecox makes the women’s cross-country or track teams in the Fall 2022 semester, \nbut is not eligible under one or more NCAA Bylaw—either because the Bylaws do not \nprovide for an exception or because she does not qualify for an exception—BSU can \nnevertheless submit a waiver request to the NCAA. BSU does not submit waiver requests \nto the NCAA until after a student athlete has made a team. BSU’s general practice is to \nsubmit waiver requests when there is a reasonable and good faith justification for the \nrequest. If Hecox makes the women’s cross-country or track teams, BSU will treat Hecox \nthe same as all other student athletes and will submit a waiver request if it determines that \nthere is a reasonable and good-faith justification for doing so. The NCAA decides whether \nto grant waivers, and the NCAA’s waiver guidelines provide that waivers can be granted \nfor unforeseeable hardships. \nFinally, NCAA policy required Hecox to complete at least 12 months of testosterone  \nsuppression treatment leading up to the Fall 2022 semester to compete on the women’s \ntrack and cross-country teams. Hecox contends, and the Defendants and Intervenors do not \ncurrently  dispute,  that  she  has  undergone  testosterone  suppression  treatment  from \n \n11 NCAA Bylaw 12.8.3.7 suggests that playing club soccer counts as participation in intercollegiate \nathletics, since an individual participating on a club team “is charged with a season of competition for \nparticipation  in  intercollegiate  competition.”  NCAA  Division  1  Manual,  available  at \nhttps://web3.ncaa.org/lsdbi/reports/getReport/90008. Further, the NCAA’s definition of “intercollegiate \ncompetition” creates an exception for participation on club teams only if the athlete’s school does not have \na varsity team in the same sport. Id. This exception does not appear to apply because BSU has a varsity \nwomen’s soccer team. See https://broncosports.com/sports/women-soccer. \nORDER –  10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 11 of 25\nSeptember 2019 until the present. Hecox thus meets the NCAA’s policy with respect to \ntestosterone suppression. \nE. Impact of Withdrawal on NCAA Eligibility \nBecause Hecox attended classes during the Fall 2020 semester, the semester  \ncounts as an attempted semester for NCAA eligibility purposes even though she ultimately \nwithdrew. For example, the Fall 2020 semester counts in determining Hecox will be a third-\nyear student in the Fall 2022 semester for purposes of NCAA Bylaw 14.4.3.2, and in \ncalculating the amount of credits she is required to have completed for purposes of NCAA \nBylaw 14.4.3.1(b).  \nGiven her apparent inability to qualify for the NCAA Bylaw 14.4.3.6(a) and (b) \nexceptions, Hecox can only obtain NCAA eligibility in the Fall 2022 semester if she makes \nthe women’s cross-country or track teams, BSU determines there is a reasonable and good \nfaith justification for submitting a waiver request, and the NCAA grants the waiver request \nbased on an unforeseeable hardship. The committee designated to make determinations on \nwaiver requests, known as the “NCAA-Progress-Towards-Degree Waiver Committee,” \nalso has “the authority to waive all other progress-toward degree requirements based on \nobjective evidence that demonstrates circumstances that warrant the waiver of the normal \napplication of those regulations.” Dkt. 99-2, ¶ 11 (citing NCAA Bylaw 14.4.3.10). There \nis  no  information  in  the  record  to  clarify  what  type  of  evidence  would  meet  the \naforementioned criteria.  \nF.  COVID-19 Waivers \nThe NCAA has not implemented COVID-19 waivers that would apply to Hecox  \nORDER –  11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 12 of 25\nif she makes the women’s cross-country or track teams in the Fall 2022 semester. \nG. Plans to Play on Other Teams \nHecox intends to try out for the BSU Women’s cross-country and track teams in her  \nFall 2022 semester. If Hecox does not make the women’s cross-country or track teams, or \ndoes make the teams but does not receive a waiver of the NCAA eligibility requirements \nin in the Fall 2022 semester, she plans to try out for the cross-country and track teams again \nin her senior year, and may then satisfy the NCAA eligibility requirements depending on \nthe number of credits she takes during the 2022-2023 school year. In addition, Hecox has \njoined, and is playing for, the BSU women’s club soccer team.  \nIV. LEGAL STANDARD \n  “The  jurisdiction  of  federal  courts  depends  on  the  existence  of  a  ‘case  or \ncontroversy’ under Article III of the Constitution.” Pub. Utils. Comm’n of Cal. v. FERC, \n100 F.3d 1451, 1458 (9th Cir. 1996). Although this Court determined there was an actual \ncase and controversy when Hecox filed her Complaint, Dkt. 63, at 31–41, a party must \nmaintain a live controversy throughout all stages of the litigation process.12 Doe v. Madison \nSch. Dist. No. 321, 177 F.3d 789, 797 (9th Cir. 1999) (citation omitted). If an action or \nclaim loses its character as a live controversy, then the action or claim becomes moot, and \nfederal courts lack jurisdiction to resolve the underlying dispute. Id. at 798 (citing Ruiz v. \n \n12 The case and controversy limitation on federal judicial authority underpins the doctrines of both standing \nand mootness. Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., 528 U.S. 167, 180 (2000). The two \ninquiries differ in that standing is assessed by the facts that exist at the time a complaint is filed, while \nmootness involves changing circumstances that arise after a complaint is filed. Clark v. City of Lakewood, \n259 F.3d 996, 1006 (9th Cir. 2001).  \n \nORDER –  12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 13 of 25\nCity of Santa Maria, 160 F.3d 543, 549 (9th Cir. 1998); see also Lindquist v. Idaho State \nBd. of Corr., 776 F.2d 851, 853–54 (9th Cir. 1985) (“A case, or an issue in a case, is \nconsidered moot if it has lost its character as a present, live controversy of the kind that \nmust exist if we are to avoid advisory opinions on abstract propositions of law”) (cleaned \nup).  \n  Mootness must be approached “cautiously and with care to ensure that the party \nclaiming the benefit of mootness . . . has carried its burden of establishing that the claim is \nmoot.” United States v. Larson, 302 F.3d 1016, 1020 (9th Cir. 2002); S. Oregon Barter \nFair v. Jackson Cty., 372 F.3d 1128, 1134 (9th Cir. 2004) (“Barter Fair”) (“The party \nasserting  mootness  bears  the  burden  of  establishing  that  there  is  no  effective  relief \nremaining that the court could provide.”).13 Because it “is no small matter to deprive a \nlitigant of the rewards of its efforts,” a case will be dismissed for mootness “only if it [is] \nabsolutely clear that the litigant no longer ha[s] any need for the judicial protection” sought. \nLarson, 302 F.3d at 1020. \nV. DISCUSSION \nBefore addressing the parties’ arguments regarding the mootness issue, the Court \ncorrects a misconception perpetuated throughout the briefing by Defendants. Defendants \n \n13 Defendants devote much of their opening brief to arguing they do not have the burden to show mootness \nbecause this is not a case involving voluntary cessation by a defendant. Dkt. 96, at 5–10. However, in Barter \nFair, the Ninth Circuit held the defendant had the burden of establishing mootness even where, as here, the \nplaintiff ceased the relevant conduct. 372 F.3d at 1134. Further, Defendants argue, without citing any \nauthority, that they do not have the burden to show Hecox’s claim is moot because the Ninth Circuit raised \nthe mootness issue sua sponte. Regardless of how the issue arose, Defendants still seek the benefit of \nmootness, and thus bear the burden of establishing Hecox’s claim is moot. Id.; Larson, 302 F.3d at 1020. \nNevertheless, for the reasons explained below, even if Hecox has the burden of establishing her claim is \nnot moot given the procedural posture of this case, the Court finds she has met this burden. \nORDER –  13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 14 of 25\nopen their brief with the contention: “For over a year, the Court enjoined a law that did not \napply to Lindsay Hecox because she withdrew from Boise State University in October \n2020.” Dkt. 96, at 2. Defendants go on to suggest “for over a year” this Court’s preliminary \ninjunction order “was unconstitutional,” “impinged Idaho’s sovereignty,” and “violated \nprinciples of federalism and representative government.” Id. at 3–4, 8.  \nDefendants’ claim ignores that this case was already pending on an appeal they \ninitiated before Hecox withdrew from BSU. Every decision and ruling from this Court prior \nto the appeal occurred while Hecox was enrolled at BSU and while mootness was not an \nissue. Also, while Hecox was still enrolled at BSU, the parties—including Defendants—\nasked the Court to stay these proceedings during Defendants and Intervenors’ interlocutory \nappeal to the Ninth Circuit. Dkt. 70. It is blatantly wrong for Defendants to suggest that \nthis Court issued a preliminary injunction that did not apply to Hecox because she was not \nenrolled at BSU. Hecox absolutely was enrolled at BSU when the injunction issued.  \nDefendants also ignore that the Court was unaware that Hecox did not make the \ncross-country team, or that she had withdrawn from BSU, until the Ninth Circuit remanded \nthis case on June 24, 2021. Dkt. 79. Further, as Hecox points out, Defendants’ claim of \nharm to their sovereignty rings hollow given that Defendant BSU knew in October 2020 \nthat Hecox had withdrawn from school to establish in-state residency, yet BSU did nothing \nto notify either this Court, or the Ninth Circuit, about any mootness concerns. Dkt. 99, at 7 \nn. 3. Although the Court lacks clairvoyance, it did not impinge Idaho’s sovereignty or \nviolate principles of federalism by failing to address changed circumstances of which it \nwas unaware, or by honoring the parties’ stay request. \nORDER –  14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 15 of 25\nThe Court turns next to the parties’ contentions regarding mootness. \nA. Hecox’s Status as a BSU Student  \nAmong other things, the Act prevents transgender women from participating on \nwomen’s sport teams that are sponsored by public institutions of higher education. Idaho \nCode § 33-6203(1)–(2). As such, Hecox’s changed enrollment status at BSU, effective \nafter the case went up on appeal, called into question whether the Ninth Circuit could grant \nHecox “any effectual relief whatever,” since the Act would not apply to Hecox if she was \nnot, or did not have concrete plans to become, a college student. Dkt. 79, at 3 (quoting \nChurch of Scientology of Cal. v. United States, 506 U.S. 9, 12 (1992)). Many of the \nquestions  regarding  mootness  the  Ninth  Circuit  identified  thus  involved  Hecox’s \nenrollment status at BSU. After assessing each of these questions based on the stipulated \nfacts, the Court finds Hecox not only had concrete plans to re-enroll, but in fact followed \nthrough with such plans. \nWhen this case was before the Ninth Circuit, Hecox declared she had plans to re-\nenroll in January 2022, after achieving in-state residency. Dkt. 79, at 2. Hecox withdrew \nfrom her classes in 2020 in time to receive “Ws” on her transcript, and did not face any \nbarriers to re-enrollment. Dkt. 92, ¶¶ 1, 9–12. Hecox subsequently established in-state \nresidency, qualified for in-state tuition for the Spring 2022 semester, re-enrolled in nine \ncredits for the Spring 2022 semester, and was attending her classes as of April 13, 2022. \nDkt. 102, ¶¶ 1–4.  \nQualifying for in-state tuition required Hecox to satisfy multiple contingencies. \nSpecifically, Hecox had to show that she received less than 50% of her financial support \nORDER –  15 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 16 of 25\nfrom her parent or guardian and had “continuously resided and maintained a bona fide \ndomicile in the state of Idaho primarily for purposes other than educational for twelve (12) \nmonths preceding the opening day of the term for which the student matriculates.” Idaho \nCode § 33-3717B(1)(b). To establish she maintained a bona fide domicile in Idaho, Hecox \nhad to prove at least five of the following criteria for the twelve months before the term \n(Spring 2022) for which she obtained in-state residency: (1) ownership or leasing of a \nresidence in Idaho; (2) registration and payment of Idaho taxes or fees, other than sales tax; \n(3) registration to vote in Idaho; (4) holding an Idaho driver’s license or ID card; (5) \nevidence of abandonment of previous domicile; (6) establishment of accounts with Idaho \nfinancial institutions; or (7) other similar factors such as enrollment of dependent children \nin Idaho elementary or secondary schools, acceptance of permanent employment in Idaho, \ndocumentation of need to care for relative in Idaho, utility statements, or employment \ndocumentation. Dkt. 92, ¶ 4 (citation omitted). \nTo meet these requirements, Hecox leased a residence in Idaho since August 2020, \nbegan working full-time in Idaho in December 2020, has been registered to vote in Idaho \nsince September 2019, obtained an Idaho ID card in January 2020, abandoned her domicile \nin California when she relocated her personal possessions to Idaho in August 2019, had the \nability  to  present  employment  documentation  and  pay  stubs  reflecting  her  full-time \nemployment  in  Idaho  since  December  2020,  had  the  ability  to  provide  employment \ndocumentations such as work schedules and pay stubs reflecting her full-time employment \nin Idaho since December 2020, and received less than 50% of her financial report from her \nORDER –  16 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 17 of 25\nparents.14 Id. Hecox also amassed considerable savings during her absence from BSU, and \nsaved  nearly $24,000.00 prior to the Spring 2022 semester. Id., ¶ 6.  \nWhile Defendants and the Intervenors fault Hecox for withdrawing in October 2020, \nand argue she may have another change of heart, Hecox has illustrated far more than a \n“bare statement of intention,” and has instead steadfastly followed through with her plans \nto obtain in-state residency and to re-enroll in BSU. Dkt. 95, at 6 (quoting Fox v. Bd. of \nTrs. of State Univ. of N.Y., 42 F.3d 135, 143 (2d Cir. 1994)); see also Dkt. 96, at 12–15. To \nthe extent Defendants and the Intervenors suggest Hecox may change her mind and decide \nnot to enroll for the Fall 2022 semester, such arguments are not only belied by the record, \nbut are also misplaced. When assessing mootness, the Ninth Circuit has held it is the \ndefendant’s burden to show a plaintiff will not take certain action, rather than the plaintiff’s \nburden to show that it will do so. Rosemere Neighborhood Assoc. v. U.S. Envtl. Prot. \nAgency, 581 F.3d 1169, 1174 (9th Cir. 2009) (“[W]hen there is an argument about whether \na plaintiff will again encounter a challenged activity, this court has required little more than \nwhat Rosemere has already supplied: a stated intention to resume the actions that led to the \nlitigation”). Hecox has expressed her intent to continue as a BSU student and has actually \nreenrolled and continued as a BSU student. There is no evidence in the record to suggest \nHecox will not continue as a BSU student this fall, and Hecox has expressed an intent to \ncontinue as a BSU student. See, e.g., Dkt. 97-1, ¶¶ 17, 24. Defendants and the Intervenors’ \nspeculation that Hecox’s plans may change falls far short of establishing her claims are \n \n14 Although each of these facts are as of October 15, 2021, the Court assumes they did not change through \nDecember 2021 since Hecox qualified for in-state tuition for the Spring 2022 semester. Id.; Dkt. 102, at 1.  \nORDER –  17 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 18 of 25\nmoot. Rosemere, 581 F.3d at 1174; Barter Fair, 372 F.3d at 1134 (holding plaintiff had a \nsufficient ongoing interest in the outcome of the case to preclude mootness where plaintiff \nstated it intended to hold an event in the future if the challenged statute was declared \nunconstitutional); Clark, 259 F.3d at 1012 (finding plaintiff’s constitutional challenge to \nadult cabaret ordinance was not moot even where plaintiff’s license to operate an adult \ncabaret had expired because plaintiff’s stated intention was to return to business). \nDefendants and the Intervenors also attempt to cast doubt on Hecox’s financial \nstability. Dkt. 95, at 6–7; Dkt. 96, at 13–15. Such arguments overlook that Hecox had \nenough money saved to pay for approximately six semesters of in-state tuition—even \nwithout any financial aid—as of October 15, 2022. Dkt. 92, ¶ 6. Hecox’s financial stability \ndoes not require “speculation and guesswork,” as Defendants contend, but is instead \nestablished by the stipulated facts. Dkt. 96, at 13. By taking multiple material steps toward \nher stated goals of establishing in-state residency and saving money prior to re-enrolling in \nthe Spring 2022 semester, Hecox has ensured that she can afford the remainder of her \neducation at BSU. \nIn sum, Hecox did not face any barriers to re-enrollment, has evidence of significant \nsavings, took concrete steps to re-enroll and has re-enrolled at BSU, and withdrew from \nher classes by the October 30, 2020 deadline for doing so.   \nB. NCAA Eligibility \n1.  Qualifying for the BSU women’s cross-country or track teams \nDefendants and the Intervenors argue Hecox’s claims are moot because she may not \nqualify for the BSU women’s cross-country or track teams. Dkt. 95, at 4–5, 8–10; Dkt. 96, \nORDER –  18 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 19 of 25\nat 2, 12. Defendants and the Intervenors highlight that the only evidence in the record about \nHecox’s capability as a runner is that she was unable to post a qualifying time during the \nFall 2020 try-outs for the BSU women’s cross-country and track teams. Dkt. 95, at 4–5; \nDkt. 96, at 12. As such, Defendants and the Intervenors argue Hecox’s interest in running \nfor  the  BSU  women’s  cross-country  or  track  teams  is  based  on  nothing  more  than \nspeculation. Id. \nAs this Court previously emphasized, absent an injunction, the Act categorically \nbars Hecox from trying out for BSU’s women’s cross-country and track teams. The Act \nmandates “[a]thletic teams or sports designated for females, women, or girls shall not be \nopen to students of the male sex.” Idaho Code § 33-6203(2) (emphasis added). The Act \nalso provides that “any student” who suffers “any” unspecified “direct or indirect harm” as \na result of a violation of the Act can sue BSU for injunctive relief and damages. Id. at § 33-\n6205(1). Thus, if BSU were to violate the Act by allowing Hecox to try out for its women’s \ncross-country or track teams, it could be liable to essentially any student who claims any \ninjury as a result. BSU cannot “open” its try-outs for the women’s cross-country or track \nteams to Hecox without being exposed to such liability. Id. at § 33-6203(2). Defendants \nand the Intervenors’ suggestion that Hecox cannot be adversely affected by the Act unless \nshe first makes the BSU women’s cross-country or track teams ignores that the express \nterms of the Act bar Hecox from trying out for the teams at all.  \nFurther, the Supreme Court has long held that the “injury in fact” required for \nstanding in equal protection cases is denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition \nof  a  barrier,  not  the  ultimate  inability  to obtain  the  benefit.  Ne.  Florida  Chapter  of \nORDER –  19 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 20 of 25\nAssociated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993) \n(“When the government erects a barrier that makes it more difficult for members of one \ngroup to obtain a benefit than it is for members of another group, a member of the former \ngroup seeking to challenge the barrier need not allege that he would have obtained the \nbenefit but for the barrier in order to establish standing”); Clements v. Fashing, 457 U.S. \n957, 962 (1982) (finding political officers had standing to challenge a provision of the \nTexas Constitution requiring automatic resignation for some officeholders upon their \nannouncement of candidacy for another office because their injury was the “obstacle to \n[their] candidacy” for a new office, not the fact that they would have been elected to a new \noffice but for the law’s prohibition); Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 281 \nn. 14 (1978) (“Bakke”) (holding twice-rejected white male applicant had standing to \nchallenge medical school’s admissions program which reserved 16 of 100 places in the \nentering  class  for  minority  applicants,  because  the  requisite  “injury”  was  plaintiff’s \ninability to compete for all 100 places in the class, simply because of his race, not that he \nwould have been admitted in the absence of the special program). \nThus,  even  if  the  Court  accepted  Defendants  and  the  Intervenors’  arguments \nregarding Hecox’s ability to qualify for the BSU women’s cross-country or track teams, \nher claims are not moot because, but for the Court’s injunction, Hecox cannot compete for \na spot on the women’s cross-country or track teams. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 281 n. 14. Nor, as \nfurther discussed below, could Hecox continue to play for the BSU women’s club soccer \nteam absent an injunction. \n2.  NCAA Eligibility \nORDER –  20 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 21 of 25\nHecox filed a declaration stating she is committed to trying out for the BSU  \nwomen’s cross-country and track teams in the Fall 2022 semester. Dkt. 97-1, ¶ 24. If she \ndoes not make the teams during the Fall 2022 try out, she intends to try out for both teams \nagain the following year.15 Id.  \nAs noted, Hecox cannot try out for the teams at all absent an injunction. However, \nif Hecox is permitted to try out for, and makes the women’s cross-country or track teams, \nshe will have to obtain an eligibility waiver from the NCAA to run for either team in her \njunior  year.  The  Court  lacks  information  to  assess  either  whether  BSU  will  find  a \nreasonable and good faith justification for submitting an eligibility waiver, or whether the \nNCAA will grant a  waiver based on an unforeseeable hardship  or other  unspecified \ncircumstances. 16 Yet, Hecox may not need an eligibility waiver to run for the teams if she \ntries out again in the Fall 2023 semester, depending on the number of credits she takes \nduring her junior year. Hecox’s expressed intent to try out again in the Fall of 2023 appears \nto satisfy the Ninth Circuit’s mootness concerns, particularly because Hecox is currently \nan enrolled BSU student. Dkt. 79, at 2–4. If “the person who initially brought the suit may \n \n15 Hecox alleged in her Complaint that she only has five potential years to participate in NCAA sports. Dkt. \n1, ¶ 34. The parties did not address this issue in their stipulated facts or briefing, but it appears Hecox will \nstill be within her five total years of NCAA eligibility during the 2023-2024 school year. \n \n16 Indeed, there is simply no way to accurately predict whether the NCAA will grant a waiver. As one \nreporter noted, “[w]hen it comes to being unpredictable, nothing tops Chicago weather, moody teenagers \nand the NCAA.” Shannon Ryan, Denying a Waiver to Illinois Tight End Luke Ford is Another Illogical \nMove From the NCAA After Recent Improvements to Transfer Rules, CHICAGO TRIBUNE (Apr. 24, 2019), \navailable at https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/ct-spt-illinois-luke-ford-ncaa-transfer-waiver-\n20190424-story.html.  \nORDER –  21 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 22 of 25\nagain be subject to the challenged conduct, she has a stake in preserving the court’s \nholding.” Camreta v. Greene, 563 U.S. 692, 703 (2011) (citations omitted).  \nIn short, Hecox may again be subjected to the Act because she intends to try out for \nthe women’s cross-country and track teams in the Fall 2022 and Fall 2023 semesters. \nC. BSU Women’s Club Soccer Team \nEven if Hecox cannot obtain an NCAA eligibility waiver, or qualify for the BSU \nwomen’s cross-country or track teams, her claim is not moot because she is currently \nplaying for the BSU women’s club soccer team. Club soccer is not an NCAA sport and \nHecox  can  play  for  the  BSU  women’s  club  soccer  team  regardless  of  the  NCAA’s \neligibility rules. Hecox expressed her desire to join the women’s club soccer team in the \nparties’ October 15, 2021 Stipulated Facts. Dkt. 92, ¶ 25. As with her plans to re-enroll at \nBSU and to obtain in-state residency, Hecox followed through with her intention and joined \nthe women’s club soccer team during her Spring 2022 semester. Dkt. 102, ¶ 5.  \nDefendants argue Hecox’s complaint, and the Court’s preliminary injunction, solely \ninvolved Hecox’s interests in track and cross-country, and suggest the Court’s preliminary \ninjunction does not apply to Hecox’s interest in club soccer. The Court disagrees. In her \nComplaint, Hecox alleged that the Act barred her from preventing in college athletics at \nall.17 Dkt. 1, ¶ 38. Hecox explained she is shy and that being on sports teams gave her a \nway to make friends. Id. She alleged that if the Act were in effect at the start of the Fall \n2020 season, she would miss the opportunity to make friends, as well as the motivation, \n \n17 See, supra, text accompanying note 4. \nORDER –  22 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 23 of 25\nchallenge, camaraderie, and joy that sport had brought her in the past. Id. Moreover, \nmultiple allegations in the Complaint addressed the injury the Act causes transgender \nwomen student athletes in general, and were not limited to track or cross-country. Id., ¶¶ \n2–5, 38, 57, 59–65, 107, 121–124, 127–137.  \nSimilarly,  the  Court’s  preliminary  injunction  was  not  limited  to  Hecox’s \ninvolvement with the cross-country and track teams. When assessing whether Hecox had \nstanding to challenge the Act, the Court noted the harm she alleged—the inability to \nparticipate on women’s teams—arose when the Act went into effect on July 1, 2020. Dkt. \n63, at 33. The Court’s analysis of Hecox’s likelihood of success also involved Hecox’s \nability to participate in women’s student sports in general, rather than to specifically \nparticipate on the women’s cross-country or track teams. Id. at 60–79.  \nFor instance, the Court held: “Based on the dearth of evidence in the record to show \nexcluding transgender women from women’s sports supports [the justification for the Act], \n[Hecox] is likely to succeed in establishing the Act violates her right to equal protection.” \nId. at 76 (emphasis added). The Court went on to note Defendants failed to identify “a \nlegitimate interest served by the Act that the preexisting rules in Idaho did not already \naddress, other than an invalid interest of excluding transgender women and girls from \nwomen’s sports entirely, regardless of their physiological characteristics. As such, [Hecox] \nis likely to succeed on the merits of her equal protection claim.” Id. at 79 (emphasis added).  \nThe Court also held the Act subjected Hecox to irreparable harm due to the latter \nconstitutional violation, as well as because the Act communicated the State of Idaho’s \n“moral disproval” of her identity. Id. at 84. Neither of these harms were limited to Hecox’s \nORDER –  23 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 24 of 25\nability to join the cross-country or track teams.18 With respect to the balance of the equities \nand the public interest, the Court explained:  \nIn stark contrast to the deeply personal and irreparable harms Plaintiffs face, \na preliminary injunction would not harm Defendants because it would simply \nmaintain the status quo while Plaintiffs pursue their claims. If an injunction \nis issued, Defendants can continue to rely on NCAA policy for college \nathletes and IHSAA policy for high school athletes, as they did for nearly a \ndecade prior to the Act. In the absence of any evidence that transgender \nwomen threatened equality in sports, girls’ athletic opportunities, or girls’ \naccess to scholarships in Idaho during the ten years such policies were in \nplace, neither Defendants nor the Intervenors would be harmed by returning \nto the status quo. \n \nId. at 85.  \n \nIn short, nothing in the Court’s Equal Protection Clause analysis of Hecox’s claim \nturned on the specifics of running as compared to other school athletics.  \nFinally, Hecox has proven that she has a real and imminent need for relief because \nshe cannot continue to play for the BSU women’s club soccer team absent an injunction. \nDefendants speciously suggest “[n]othing in the record suggests that [the Act] prevents \nHecox from joining the club soccer team.” Dkt. 98, at 5. Under its express terms, the Act \napplies  to  all  “[i]nterscholastic,  intercollegiate,  intramural,  or  club  athletic  teams  or \nsports,”  that,  like  the  BSU  women’s  club  soccer  team,  are  sponsored  by  “a  public \ninstitution of higher education[.]” Idaho Code § 33-6203(1) (emphasis added).19 As such, \n \n18 In light of such harms, that the Court’s irreparable harm analysis also considered Hecox’s loss of a year \nof NCAA eligibility without an injunction does not undermine the propriety of the injunction with respect \nto Hecox’s interest in soccer, as Defendants contend. Dkt. 96, at 11. \n \n19 Notably, in its preliminary injunction order, the Court also specifically highlighted that the Act’s \npurported interest in advancing athletic scholarships for women was undermined by the fact that the Act \napplies to club and intermural athletic teams, whether sponsored by a public primary or secondary school, \nor by a public institution of higher education. Id. at 75–76. \nORDER –  24 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00184-DCN   Document 105   Filed 07/18/22   Page 25 of 25\nHecox needs the judicial protection she seeks through this litigation in order to continue \nplaying on the BSU women’s club soccer team. Larson, 302 F.3d at 1020.  \nVI. CONCLUSION \nHecox has re-enrolled at BSU and is participating on the women’s club soccer team. \nShe also intends to try out for the women’s track and cross-country teams in the Fall 2022 \nsemester, and again in the Fall 2023 semester. Although there are some questions about \nHecox’s NCAA eligibility, she cannot continue to play soccer, or compete for a spot on \nthe women’s track or cross-country teams, absent an injunction. Thus, Hecox’s claim is \nnot moot. \nVII. ORDER \nNow, therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED: \n1.  Hecox’s claim is not moot; \n2.  Pursuant to the Remand Order, the parties shall advise the Ninth Circuit of the \ninstant decision within seven (7) days; \n3.  The parties’ Stipulated Dismissal (Dkt. 104) is DENIED; \n4.  This case is, once again, STAYED pending the Ninth Circuit’s resolution of the \nDefendants and Intervenors’ appeal of this Court’s preliminary injunction order.  \nJuly 18, 2022\nORDER –  25 ",

Carson, 347 F.3d 742, 745 (9th Cir. 2003) (citation \nomitted).  However, because “[i]t is no small matter to deprive a litigant of the \nrewards of its efforts,” we dismiss a case for mootness “only if it [is] absolutely \nclear that the litigant no longer ha[s] any need of the judicial protection” sought.  \nUnited States v. Larson, 302 F.3d 1016, 1020 (9th Cir. 2002) (emphasis added) \n(quoting Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Slater, 528 U.S. 216, 224 (2000) (per \ncuriam)).  Hecox is not currently enrolled at BSU, but declared she plans to re-\nenroll in January 2022, after achieving in-state residency.  Whether an actual case \nor controversy remains in these circumstances is a close question.  Compare \n \n1 The parties agree that Jane Doe’s claim is now moot because she graduated \nfrom high school and is planning to attend college out of state.  See, e.g., Bd. of \nSch. Comm’rs of City of Indianapolis v. Jacobs, 420 U.S. 128, 129 (1975) (case \nmoot where all plaintiffs had graduated); Doe v. Madison Sch. Dist. No. 321, 177 \nF.3d 789, 797–99 (9th Cir. 1999) (same). \n2 \n     \n\nCase: 20-35813, 06/24/2021, ID: 12153687, DktEntry: 143, Page 3 of 5\n \nJacobs, 420 U.S. 128, 129 (case moot where students graduated) and Fox v. Bd. of \nTrustees of State Univ. of New York, 42 F.3d 135, 137, 142–43 (2d Cir. 1994) (case \nmoot where students no longer attending and could not show they were actually \nplanning or able to return) with Clark v. City of Lakewood, 259 F.3d 996, 1006, \n1011–12 (9th Cir. 2001), as amended (Aug. 15, 2001) (case not moot even where \nbusiness was not currently operating, because of expressed intent to re-start \noperation in the future).   \nThe post-argument briefing and declarations by the parties on the question of \nmootness failed to resolve the issue, and served only to raise further questions.  \nThere are currently too many open factual questions to determine “cautiously and \nwith care,” Larson, 302 F.3d at 1020, whether we can grant Hecox “any effectual \nrelief whatever,” Church of Scientology of California v. United States, 506 U.S. 9, \n12 (1992) (citation omitted).  In particular, it is essential to know whether Hecox \nwould be eligible to play for BSU if she re-enrolled and made the team.  In a May \n12, 2021, declaration, Hecox asserted, without explanation or support, that she \nremains eligible to play under NCAA rules.  The Defendants argue, based on their \ninterpretation of the NCAA rules, that Hecox is not eligible because she did not \ntake enough credits in her first two years at BSU.  Neither side provided evidence \nregarding how the NCAA rules apply in Hecox’s specific situation.  For instance, \ndoes the fact that she withdrew from classes before the deadline to drop classes \n3 \n     \n\nCase: 20-35813, 06/24/2021, ID: 12153687, DktEntry: 143, Page 4 of 5\n \nimpact her status for NCAA eligibility purposes?  Has the NCAA created any \nCOVID-related exceptions to its requirements that apply to Hecox?  It would be \nbest to hear from a school administrator, NCAA representative, or other authority \non NCAA eligibility.  \nThe mootness analysis would also be aided by more information regarding \nthe BSU re-enrollment process, the steps Hecox has taken toward re-enrollment, \nand the availability of BSU women’s sports outside of NCAA teams.  Is Hecox \nstill an admitted student who can re-enroll at BSU whenever she desires, or are \nthere barriers to re-enrollment?  Does she have evidence of savings, discussions \nwith administrators, or anything else that shows a concrete plan to re-enroll?  That \nHecox dropped out of BSU within a week of not making the track or cross-country \nteams is also troubling.  It would be useful to know what the Fall 2020 deadline for \ndropping classes was, and the penalty for dropping out after that deadline.  And if \nHecox is not eligible to play on the NCAA teams or does not make those teams, \nare there BSU women’s club teams that she plans to join instead?   \nWe are not well positioned to answer these questions, or any other issues of \nfact regarding Hecox’s enrollment status or NCAA eligibility.  We remand so that \nthe district court can develop the record, resolve any factual disputes, and apply the \nrequired caution and care to the initial mootness determination.  See Larson, 302 \nF.3d at 1020.   \n4 \n     \n\nCase: 20-35813, 06/24/2021, ID: 12153687, DktEntry: 143, Page 5 of 5\n \nThis court otherwise retains jurisdiction over this appeal.  Submission of this \ncase is vacated, and further proceedings are held in abeyance pending the district \ncourt’s decision on the remanded issue.  The parties shall advise this court within \nseven (7) days of the district court’s decision.  See FRAP 12.1(b).   \n  IT IS SO ORDERED.  \n \n \n5 \n     ",

However, “[c]onsideration of new facts may even be mandatory ... when developments render a \ncontroversy moot and thus divest us of jurisdiction.” Id. As the facts in Hecox’s declaration bear directly on the \nquestion of mootness, we grant her motion to supplement the record on appeal. \n \n2  Intervenors additionally argue that the district court “inappropriately saddled Defendants with the burden of \n  producing more evidence.” However, the district court found that even if Hecox had the burden of production, she \nhad met that burden. Moreover, the party asserting the benefits of mootness bears the burden of establishing \n2 \n \n\nHecox v. Little, Not Reported in Fed. Rptr. (2023)   \n2023 WL 1097255 \n \nmootness. See Nw.

CONCLUSION  3. The Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. 22) is \nGRANTED. \nThe Court recognizes that this decision is likely to be    \ncontroversial. While the citizens of Idaho are likely to \neither vehemently oppose, or fervently support, the Act,  All Citations \nthe Constitution must always prevail. It is the Court’s \n479 F.Supp.3d 930 \nrole—as  part  of  the  third  branch  of  government—to \n \ninterpret the law. At this juncture, that means looking at \nthe  Act,  as  enacted  by  the  Idaho  Legislature,  and \nFootnotes \n \n1  The Act went into effect on July 1, 2020. Idaho Code § 33-6201. \n \n \n2  The Court relies on various declarations filed in support of the Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Motion to \n  Intervene for medical definitions of the terms used herein, and to identify the proposed intervenors and their \narguments. The Court also considers extra-pleading materials when assessing Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction. The Court does not, however, rely on extra-pleading materials (other than those of which it takes judicial \nnotice) in its assessment of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, and accordingly does not treat the Motion to Dismiss as \na Motion for Summary Judgment. Olsen v. Idaho State Bd. of Med., 363 F.3d 916, 921–22 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding a \nrepresented party’s submission of extra-pleading materials justified treating the motion to dismiss as a motion for \nsummary judgment). Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201(c), the Court has discretionary authority to take \njudicial notice, regardless of whether it is requested to do so by a party, and does in fact do so in this case as it \nrelates to certain materials identified below. Fed. R. Evid. 201. \n30 \n \n\nHecox v. Little, 479 F.Supp.3d 930 (2020)   \n \n \n3  Plaintiffs Jean, John, and Jane Doe have been granted permission to proceed under pseudonyms. Dkt. 48. \n \n \n4  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Mountain West conference in which BSU participates recently postponed sports \n  competitions for fall sports. However, as of the date of this decision, BSU has not announced whether it will alter \nthe training programs or tryouts for the cross-country team, and the Court has been advised by Plaintiffs’ counsel \nthat Lindsay is continuing her individual training program in preparation for tryouts. \n \n5  Although try-outs for the Boise High soccer team have recently been postponed, the Court has been advised that \n  small group training for the girls’ soccer team may begin as early as August 17, 2020. \n \n6  On the same day, Governor Little also signed another bill into law, H.B. 509, which essentially bans transgender \n  individuals from changing their gender marker on their birth certificates to match their gender identity. Id. at ¶ \n93–94.  Enforcement  of  H.B.  509  is  currently  being  litigated  in  F.V.  and  Dani  Martin  v.  Jeppesen  et  al., \n1:17-cv-00170-CWD, because another judge of this Court previously permanently enjoined Idaho from enforcing a \nprior law that restricted transgender individuals from altering the sex designation on their birth certificates. F.V. v. \nBarron, 286 F. Supp. 3d 1131, 1146 (D. Idaho 2018). \n \n7  While a federal statute does not authorize intervention by the Proposed Intervenors, the United States is statutorily \n  authorized to intervene in cases of general public importance involving alleged denials of equal protection on the \nbasis of sex. 28 U.S.C. § 517; see also United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 523, 116 S.Ct. 2264, 135 L.Ed.2d 735 \n(1996). The United States filed its Statement of Interest in support of the Act pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 517. Dkt. 53. \n \n8  Plaintiffs also argue the outcome of this lawsuit will not advance the Proposed Intervenors’ claimed interests \n  because Madi and MK, as collegiate athletes, will still be required to compete against non-Idaho teams and athletes \nwho are subject to the rules of the NCAA, which allow participation of women who are transgender after one year of \ntestosterone suppression. Yet, the fact that a challenged law may only partially protect an intervenor from harm \ndoes not mean that the intervenor does not have an interest in preserving that partial protection, and Plaintiffs do \nnot cite any authority to the contrary. \n \n9  In Prete, the Court explained that while “it is unclear whether this ‘assumption’ rises to the level of a second \n  presumption, or rather is a circumstance that strengthens the first presumption, it is clear that ‘in the absence of a \nvery compelling showing to the contrary,’ it will be presumed that the Oregon government adequately represents \nthe interests of the intervenor-defendants.” Id. at 957 (quoting Arakaki, 324 F.3d at 1086). \n \n10  As Plaintiffs note, although Attorney General Wasden issued an opinion letter explaining that H.B. 500 was likely \n  unconstitutional at the request of a legislator, Attorney General Wasden is statutorily required to represent the \nState in all courts, Idaho Code section 67-1401(1), and his Deputy Attorney General vigorously defended the Act in \nboth briefing on the pending motions and during oral argument. As such, there is no evidence to suggest that \n31 \n \n\nHecox v. Little, 479 F.Supp.3d 930 (2020)   \n \nAttorney General Wasden will not fulfill his statutory duties. In addition, the Proposed Intervenors contend BSU will \nnot adequately represent their interests because BSU has a Gender Equality Center that advances the interests of \ntransgender students. Dkt. 30-1, at 11–13. However, as Plaintiffs highlighted during oral argument, BSU could have \nrealigned itself as a party if it felt it could not support the Act, but instead gave over representation to the State and \nhas accordingly adopted the positions of the State. Dkt. 62, at 28: 10–15. The Proposed Intervenors’ arguments \nregarding Attorney General Wasden and BSU are not a compelling showing of inadequate representation. \n \n11  The Court does not take issue with identifying Lindsay (or any other transgender women) as a transgender woman \n  or transgender female, a male-to-female transgender athlete or individual, or as a person whose sex assigned at \nbirth (male) differs from her gender identity (female). Edmo, 935 F.3d at 772. Each of these descriptions makes \ncounsel’s point without doing so in an inflammatory and potentially harmful manner. \n \n12  Personal preferences or beliefs and organizational perceptions or positions notwithstanding, the Court expects \n  courtesy between all parties in this litigation. In an ever contentious social and political world, the Courts will remain \na haven for fairness, civility, and respect—even in disagreement. \n \n13  Defendants do not challenge the causation and redressability elements of standing. \n \n \n14  Defendants also maintain that “because HB 500 has not yet come into effect, all alleged harm is future harm—and \n  Plaintiffs have not shown that the alleged injuries are certainly impending, or that there is substantial risk of harm \noccurring.” Dkt. 40-1, at 6. Since the Act went into effect July 1, 2020, this argument is moot. \n \n15  Citing Braunstein v. Arizona Dep’t of Transp., 683 F.3d 1177, 1185 (9th Cir. 2012), Defendants argue that even where \n  the government discriminates on the basis of a protected category, only those who are “personally denied equal \ntreatment have a cognizable injury under Article III.” Dkt. 59, at 3. In Braunstein, the Ninth Circuit considered a \nwhite male engineer’s lawsuit alleging the Arizona Department of Transportation violated his right to equal \nprotection by giving general contractors a financial incentive to hire minority-owned subcontractors. Braunstein, \n683 F.3d at 1184. Braunstein alleged that these preferences prevented him, as a non-minority business owner, from \ncompeting for subcontracting work on an equal basis. Id. at 1185. However, Braunstein did not submit a quote or \nattempt to secure subcontract work from any of the prime contractors who bid on the government contract. Id. at \n1185. The Ninth Circuit held that because Braunstein’s surviving claim was for damages, rather than for declaratory \nand injunctive relief, Braunstein had to show more than that he was “able and ready” to seek subcontracting work. \nId. at 1186. The Court determined Braunstein had not established an injury for purposes of his claim for damages \nbecause Braunstein had “done essentially nothing to demonstrate that he [was] in a position to compete equally \nwith the other contractors.” Id. By contrast, Lindsay seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, and has demonstrated \nshe is “able and ready” to join the BSU cross-country and track teams. Id. at 1186 (citing Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. \n244, 261–62, 123 S.Ct. 2411, 156 L.Ed.2d 257 (2003)) (holding plaintiff had standing to challenge university’s \nrace-conscious  transfer  admissions  policy,  even  though  he  never  applied  as  a  transfer  student,  because  he \ndemonstrated that he was “able and ready to do so.”) Lindsay has adequately alleged that she is ready and able to \njoin BSU’s women’s cross-country and women’s track teams and also that she is in a position to compete with other \nstudents who try out for BSU’s women’s track and cross-country teams. Specifically, Lindsay alleges she has been \ntraining hard to qualify for such teams, that she is a life-long runner who competed on track and cross-country \nteams in high school, and that she will try out for the cross-country team in fall 2020 and track team in spring 2020 if \n32 \n \n\nHecox v. Little, 479 F.Supp.3d 930 (2020)   \n \nBSU allows her to do so. Dkt. 1, at ¶¶ 6, 25, 33. Such allegations are sufficient to establish standing for Lindsay’s \nclaims. Braunstein, 683 F.3d at 1185–86. \n \n16  The Court takes judicial notice of such articles because they are matters in the public realm. “When a court takes \n  judicial notice of publications like websites and newspaper article, the court merely notices what was in the public \nrealm at the time, not whether the contents of those articles were in fact true.” Prime Healthcare Services, Inc. v. \nHumana Ins. Co., 230 F. Supp. 3d 1194, 1201 (C.D. Cal. 2017) (citing Heliotrope Gen. Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 189 F.3d \n971, 981 n. 118 (9th Cir. 1999)). The Court references such articles solely to illustrate that this case has received \nlocal and national attention, and not for the truth of the contents of the articles. Id. \n \n17  As mentioned, BSU cannot allow Lindsay this opportunity under section 33-6203(2) of the Act. Given BSU’s \n  awareness that Lindsay is a transgender woman, the Act directs that BSU “shall not” permit her to join the women’s \nteam, regardless of whether a third-party challenges Lindsay’s sex. Idaho Code § 33-6203(2). \n \n18  The  OCR  Letter  was  filed  by  the  OCR  in  Connecticut  court  cases  involving  claims  by  three  high  school \n  student-athletes and their parents due to the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference’s policy of permitting \ntransgender women to compete on women’s teams. Dkt. 41, at 25. Although the parties do not raise the issue, the \nCourt takes judicial notice of the OCR Letter, filed by Defendants in support of their Opposition to the Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction, and cited by Defendants in their Motion to Dismiss, because the Court may take judicial \nnotice of “proceedings in other courts, both within and without the federal judicial system, if those proceedings \nhave a direct relation to the matters at issue.” United States ex rel. Robinson Rancheria Citizens Council v. Borneo, \nInc., 971 F.2d 244, 248 (9th Cir. 1992). \n \n19  During oral argument, Plaintiffs’ counsel stated that they would be happy to consider entering into a consent decree \n  if Defendants were willing to agree that this interpretation of the statute was authoritative and binding in Idaho. \nDkt. 62, at 70:16–21. Defendants did not respond to this suggestion, and the parties have not notified the Court of \nany subsequent talks regarding a potential consent decree. \n \n20  The Court uses the specific terms “girl” and “girl’s teams” for Jane, and “transgender woman” and “woman’s teams” \n  for Lindsay, due to their respective ages and year in school. The terms are generally interchangeable, however, since \nthe Act applies to nearly all girls and women student athletes in Idaho. Idaho Code § 33-6203(1). \n \n21  Defendants suggest Melendres is inapposite because each of the plaintiffs in Melendres had been subjected to \n  targeted traffic stops, and because plaintiffs presented evidence that the defendants had an ongoing policy of \ntargeting Latinos. Dkt. 59, at 2–3 n. 1. Defendants argue this case is distinguishable because no one has challenged \neither Plaintiff’s sex, and because Defendants have no policy or practice to mount such challenges in the future. Id. \nThis argument ignores that regulated entities, such as BSU and Boise High, are statutorily required to ensure that \ntransgender women or girls do not play on female sports’ teams, are also responsible for resolving sex disputes, and \nrisk significant civil liability if they fail to comply with the statute. Idaho Code §§ 33-6203(3), 6205. The requirements \nthe statute itself places on regulated entities is evidence that the policy will be enforced. \n \n33 \n \n\nHecox v. Little, 479 F.Supp.3d 930 (2020)   \n \n22  Standing and ripeness are closely related. Colwell v. Dep’t of Health and Human Services, 558 F.3d 1112, 1123 (9th \n  Cir. 2009). “But whereas standing is primarily concerned with who is a proper party to litigate a particular matter, \nripeness addresses when that litigation may occur.” (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks and citations \nomitted). \n \n23  Although Defendants again highlight that the Department of Education has not yet established the rules and \n  regulations applicable to the sex verification process, Defendants do not articulate how the forthcoming rules and \nregulations could possibly change the Act’s core prohibitions and requirements; could allow transgender women \nathletes to participate on women’s teams; could exempt a girl or woman whose sex is disputed from the verification \nprocess; or could add to the narrow list of criteria that can be used to verify a girl’s or woman’s biological sex. \nDefendants are simply mistaken that impending regulations could possibly alleviate Plaintiffs’ concerns, or that such \nrules must be established before Lindsay can be excluded from women’s sports and before Jane can be subjected to \na sex verification challenge. \n \n24  Lindsay will not have even this choice unless BSU violates the Act, exposing itself to civil suit, and allows her to join \n  the women’s team. \n \n25  “Facial and as-applied challenges do not enjoy a neat demarcation, but conventional wisdom defines facial \n  challenges as ‘ones seeking to have a statute declared unconstitutional in all possible applications,’ while as-applied \nchallenges are ‘treated as the residual, although ostensibly preferred and larger, category.’ ” Standing--Facial Versus \nAs Applied Challenges--City of Los Angeles v. Patel, 129 HARV. L. REV. 241, 246 (2015)(“Facial Versus As Applied \nChallenges”) (quoting Richard H. Fallon, Jr., Fact and Fiction About Facial Challenges, 99 CAL. L. REV. 915, 923 \n(2011)). However, as many scholars note, the distinction, if any, between a facial and an as-applied challenge is \ndifficult to explain because there is a disconnect between what the Supreme Court has outlined and what happens \nin actual practice. Facial Versus As Applied Challenges, 129 HARV. L. REV. at 247; see also Gillian E. Metzger, Facial \nChallenges and Federalism, 105 COLUM. L. REV. 873, 882 (2005). \n \n26  Exceptions to Salerno’s “no set of circumstances” test have been developed but are not applicable here. For \n  instance, Salerno does not apply to certain facial challenges to statutes under the First Amendment. Planned \nParenthood of S. Arizona v. Lawall, 180 F.3d 1022, 1026 (9th Cir. 1999). The Supreme Court also held Salerno’s “no \nset of circumstances” test does not apply to “undue burden” challenges to statutes regulating abortion in Planned \nParenthood of Se. Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 895, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992). \n \n27  Plaintiffs also bring facial challenges under the Fourth Amendment. Given the confusion created by Patel and \n  uncertainty as to whether Patel applies here, the Court will deny dismissal of Plaintiffs’ facial Fourth Amendment \nchallenges without prejudice. However, even if the Court later determines that all of Plaintiffs’ facial challenges fail, \nthe Court rejects Defendants’ suggestion that if the Court dismisses all facial challenges, all of Plaintiffs’ other \nrequests for relief, including all requests for injunctive relief, should be dismissed. Dkt. 59, at 8. Plaintiffs seek \npreliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining enforcement of the Act both facially and as applied. Dkt. 1, at \n53 (Prayer for Relief, paragraph D, requesting injunctive relief “as discussed above” which includes reference to \nPlaintiffs’ as-applied challenges in paragraphs A and B). Dismissal of Plaintiffs’ facial challenges does not require \ndismissal of their requests for injunctive relief. \n34 \n \n\nHecox v. Little, 479 F.Supp.3d 930 (2020)   \n \n \n28  Heightened scrutiny is also referred to as “intermediate scrutiny.” See, e.g., Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.S. 456, 461, 108 \n  S.Ct. 1910, 100 L.Ed.2d 465 (1988). The Court uses the term “heightened” scrutiny for consistency. \n \n29  As the Barron Court explained, the Supreme Court employs a four-factor test to determine whether a class qualifies \n  as suspect or quasi-suspect: (1) when the class has been “historically subjected to discrimination;” (2) has a defining \ncharacteristic bearing no “relation to ability to perform or contribute to society;” (3) has “obvious, immutable, or \ndistinguishing characteristics;” and (4) is “a minority or is politically powerless.” Id. at 1144 (quoting United States v. \nWindsor, 570 U.S. 744, 133 S.Ct. 2675, 186 L.Ed.2d 808 (2013)). The Barron Court determined transgender \nindividuals meet each of these criteria. Id. This test has also been employed by district courts in other states to find \ntransgender people are a quasi-suspect class. For instance, in Adkins v. City of New York, 143 F. Supp. 3d 134, 139 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2015), the court determined: (1) transgender individuals have a history of persecution and discrimination \nand, moreover, “this history of persecution and discrimination is not yet history”; (2) transgender status bears no \nrelation to ability to contribute to society; (3) transgender status is a sufficiently discernible characteristic to define a \ndiscrete minority class; and (4) transgender individuals are a politically powerless minority. Id. at 139. \n \n30  Yet, even under rational basis review, if a court finds that a classification is “born of animosity toward the class of \n  persons affected,” a law that implicates neither a suspect classification nor a fundamental right may be ruled \nconstitutionally invalid. Romer, 517 U.S. at 634, 116 S.Ct. 1620; United States Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, \n413 U.S. 528, 93 S.Ct. 2821, 37 L.Ed.2d 782 (1973) (striking down provision of Food Stamp Act that denied food \nstamps to households of unrelated individuals where the legislative history suggested Congress passed the provision \nin an effort to prevent “hippie communes” from receiving food stamps). Thus, even under rational basis review, a \npolicy that is primarily motivated by animus will not pass constitutional muster. Id. at 534, 93 S.Ct. 2821. \n \n31  However, as noted supra, the Ninth Circuit has explicitly held heightened scrutiny applies if a law or policy treats \n  transgender persons in a less favorable way than all others. Karnoski, 926 F.3d at 1201. \n \n32  While maintaining heightened scrutiny is appropriate, Plaintiffs also argue the Act fails even rational basis review. \n  Dkt. 22-1, at 12, 25–26. Because the Court finds provisions of the Act fail to withstand heightened scrutiny, it does \nnot further address this argument. \n \n33  The Intervenors rely on an expert opinion from Dr. Stephen Levine claiming gender-affirming policies (such as \n  allowing transgender individuals to play on sports teams consistent with their gender identity) are instead harmful \nto transgender individuals. See generally, Dkt. 46-2. However, another judge of this Court previously determined \nthat Dr. Levine is an outlier in the field of gender dysphoria and placed “virtually no weight” on his opinion in a case \ninvolving a transgender prisoner’s medical care. Edmo v. Idaho Dep’t of Corr., 358 F. Supp. 3d 1103, 1125 (D. Idaho \n2018) (vacated in part on other grounds in Edmo v. Corizon, 935 F.3d 757 (9th Cir. 2019)); see also Norsworthy v. \nBeard, 87 F. Supp. 3d 1164, 1188–89 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (noting Dr. Levine’s expert opinion overwhelmingly relied on \ngeneralizations about gender dysphoria, contained illogical inferences, and admittedly included references to a \nfabricated anecdote). At this stage of the proceedings, the Court accepts Plaintiffs’ evidence regarding the harm \nforcing transgender individuals to deny their gender identity can cause. \n35 \n \n\nHecox v. Little, 479 F.Supp.3d 930 (2020)   \n \n \n34  The United States suggests the Ninth Circuit held participation by just one cisgender boy on the girls’ volleyball team \n  would “set back” the “goal of equal participation by females in interscholastic sports.” Dkt. 52, at 10 (citing Clark by \nand through Clark v. Arizona Interscholastic Ass’n, 886 F.2d 1191, 1193 (1989)) (“Clark II”). The part of Clark II the \nUnited States references responded to plaintiff’s “mystifying” argument that the Arizona school association had \nbeen “wholly deficient in its efforts to overcome the effects of past discrimination against women in interscholastic \nathletics, and that this failure vitiate[d] its justification for a girls-only volleyball team.” Id. The Ninth Circuit noted \nthat it was true that participation in Arizona interscholastic sports was still far from equal. Id. In light of this inequity, \nthe Clark II Court could not see how plaintiff’s “remedy” of allowing him to play on the girl’s team would help. Id. \nThus, the Clark II Court’s statement regarding participation by one male athlete was in the context of plaintiff’s \nargument that he should be permitted to play on the girl’s team because there was no justification for women’s \nteams. Id. The Clark II Court remained focused on the risk that a ruling in plaintiff’s favor would extend to all boys \nand would engender substantial displacement of girls in school sports. Id. (observing that the issue of “males ... \noutnumber[ing] females in sports two to one” in school sports would “not be solved by opening the girls’ team to \nClark and other boys.”) (emphasis added); see also id. (“Clark does not dispute our conclusion in Clark II that ‘due to \nphysiological differences, males would displace females to a substantial extent if they were allowed to compete for \npositions on the volleyball team.”) (quoting Clark, 695 F.2d at 1131) (emphasis added). \n \n35  As Attorney General Wasden advised the legislature before it passed the Act: “The issue of a transgender female \n  wishing to participate on a team with other women requires considerations beyond those considered in Clark and \npresents issues that courts have not yet resolved.” Letter from Attorney General Wasden to Rep. Rubel (Feb. 25, \n2020), https://www.idahostatesman.com/latest-newsarticle240619742.ece/BINARY/HB% 20500% 20Idaho% 20AG% \n20response.pdf. \n \n36  Rep. Ehardt also vaguely referenced a college transgender athlete, but it is not clear from the record who this \n  athlete is or where she competed. Dkt. 22-3, Ex. B, at 8. \n \n37  The legislative findings and the citations in the Proponents’ briefs cite this study as Tommy Lundberg et al., Muscle \n  strength, size and composition following 12 months of gender-affirming treatment in transgender individuals: \nretained advantage for transwomen, Karolinska Institute (Sept. 26, 2019). The correct reference for the published \nstudy is Anna Wiik et al.,  Muscle Strength, Size, and Composition following 12 Months of Gender-affirming \nTreatment in Transgender Individuals, J. CLIN. METAB., 105(3):e805-e813 (2020). \n \n38  In  their Response to  the Motion  for Preliminary  Injunction, Defendant’s  highlight  the circumstances of  one \n  transgender woman athlete who competed in women’s sports after suppressing her hormones, Cece Telfer, to \nsuggest testosterone suppression does not eliminate the physiological advantages of transgender women athletes. \nDkt. 41, at 17–18. The Court finds, and Defendants concede, that such anecdotal evidence does not establish that \nhormone therapy is ineffective in reducing athletic performance advantages in transgender women athletes. Id. at \n18. \n \n39  Moreover, males were already excluded from female sports teams under the long-standing rules in Idaho prior to \n  the Act’s passage. Defendants do not explain why women must risk being subject to the onerous sex verification \nprocess in the name of equality in sports when women already had single sex teams without the risk of a sex dispute \n36 \n \n\nHecox v.

Hecox II, \n2023 WL 1097255 at *1. Lindsay followed through on those plans by re-enrolling at BSU after she established Idaho \nstate residency and training to participate in women’s sports teams. Id. Indeed, Lindsay plans to try out again for the \nBSU women’s cross-country and track teams in Fall 2023, and has been playing for the BSU women’s club soccer \nteam since Fall 2022. Id. at *2. Absent the preliminary injunction against the Act’s enforcement, Lindsay would be \nbanned from participating on the BSU women’s club soccer team. Id. \n \n8  In supplemental briefing, Appellants also argue that the Supreme Court’s recent decisions in Dobbs v. Jackson \n  Women’s Health Org., ––– U.S. ––––, 142 S. Ct. 2228, 213 L.Ed.2d 545 (2022) and N.Y. State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n, Inc. \nv. Bruen, ––– U.S. ––––, 142 S. Ct. 2111, 213 L.Ed.2d 387 (2022) “are fatal to Hecox’s claim” because the ratifiers of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment would have understood “male” to correspond to the definition of “biological male” \nwritten into the Act. We fail to see how Dobbs, a substantive due process decision about whether the federal \nConstitution protects a woman’s right to obtain an abortion, and Bruen, a Second Amendment decision about gun \nrights, are relevant to an equal protection claim based on sex discrimination, unless Appellants are suggesting that \nthe Framers would have understood the term “biological sex” by reference to reproductive anatomy, genetic \nmake-up, or normal endogenously produced testosterone levels. Indeed, the ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment \nwould certainly not have understood the Act’s definition of “biological sex.” For example, the drafters of the \nFourteenth Amendment would have had no concept of what “endogenously produced testosterone levels” meant in \n1868, because testosterone was not named and isolated as a hormone until 1935. See John M. Tomlinson, The \nTestosterone Story, Trends in Urology & Men’s Health 34, 35 (2012). Similarly, the ratifiers would not have \nunderstood how “genetic makeup” influences sex, as chromosomes were first discovered by Walther Flemming in \n1882. D.W. Rudge, The Man Who Invented the Chromosome, 97 Heredity 136, 136 (2006) (reviewing Oren Harman, \nThe Man Who Invented the Chromosome: A Life of Cyril Darlington (2004)). \nMoreover, there is evidence that transgender people have existed since ancient times. See generally Lauren Talalay, \nThe Gendered Sea: Iconography, Gender, and Mediterranean Prehistory, in THE ARCHEOLOGY OF MEDITERRANEAN \nPREHISTORY 130–33 (Emma Blake & A. Bernard Knapp eds., 2005). Appellants appear to argue that because \ntransgender people were marginalized in 1868, they should be afforded no constitutional protections on the basis of \ntheir transgender status. But this argument would undermine decades of Supreme Court precedent striking down \n27 \n \n\nHecox v. Little, 79 F.4th 1009 (2023)   \n \nlaws that discriminate on the basis of sex. See Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 76, 92 S.Ct. 251, 30 L.Ed.2d 225 (1971) \n(holding that an Idaho statute that preferenced men as administrators of estates “ma[d]e the very kind of arbitrary \nlegislative choice forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment”); Frontiero v.

In Witt, we applied a “heightened \nscrutiny” approach to the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy for gay and lesbian servicemembers, determining \nthat “when the government attempts to intrude upon the personal and private lives of homosexuals ... the \ngovernment must advance an important governmental interest, the intrusion must significantly further that interest, \nand the intrusion must be necessary to further that interest.” 527 F.3d at 819. \n \n12  See also Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial \n  Assistance, 87 Fed. Reg. 41390, 41571 (proposed July 12, 2022) (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. pt. 106) (clarifying that \n“discrimination  on  the  basis  of  sex”  under  Title  IX  includes  discrimination  based  on  “sex  stereotypes,  sex \ncharacteristics ... and gender identity”). \n \n13  Both Idaho and the Intervenors note that the Eleventh Circuit expressed “grave doubt” in a footnote in Adams that \n  transgender people constitute a “quasi-suspect class.” Adams, 57 F.4th at 803 n.5 (internal quotation marks \nomitted). This dicta is unpersuasive, as the Eleventh Circuit declined to decide the issue or further opine on its \n“doubts.” In any event, as a three-judge panel we cannot overrule the binding precedent of our circuit. See Miller v. \nGammie, 335 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003). \n \n14  While the ban discriminates on the basis of transgender status, it is important to discuss how it discriminates against \n  all young women and girls. The partial concurrence reads the sex dispute verification provision as applicable to men \nand  boys  who  wish  to  participate  on  women  and  girls’  teams.  But  this contention  disregards  that,  as  the \nconcurrence itself elsewhere acknowledges, “[e]xisting rules already prevented boys from playing on girls’ teams \nbefore the Act.” Partial Concurrence at 1042 (quoting Hecox, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 982). The record is devoid of any \nevidence of “men and boys who wish to participate on teams designated for women or girls,” id. at 1045, in Idaho. \nHowever, if they exist, male-identifying students who wish to play on girls’ teams will never be subject to the sex \ndispute verification process, because they are already banned from participation in women’s teams by virtue of \ntheir identity under existing IHSSA policies. Only women and girls will be subject to the degrading specter of having \n28 \n \n\nHecox v. Little, 79 F.4th 1009 (2023)   \n \ntheir sex disputed and undergoing invasive and unnecessary medical testing. \n \n15  Although today the IOC and NCAA policies evaluate eligibility for transgender participation in athletics on a \n  sport-by-sport basis, neither policy endorses the categorical exclusion of transgender women. They instead favor an \n“evidence-based approach” with “no presumption of advantage.” Int’l Olympics Comm., IOC Framework on Fairness, \nInclusion  and  Non-Discrimination  on  the  Basis  of  Gender  Identity  and  Sex  Variations  4  (2021), \nhttps://stillmed.olympics.com/media/Documents/Beyond-the-Games/Human-Rights/IOC-Framework-Fairness-Inclu\nsion-Non-discrimination-2021.pdf#page=4 (last visited June 6, 2023); see also Nat’l Collegiate Athletics Ass’n, \nTransgender  Student-Athlete  Participation  Policy  (April  17,  2023), \nhttps://www.ncaa.org/sports/2022/1/27/transgender-participation-policy.aspx  (last  visited  May  24,  2023).  And \nwhile the World Athletics Council, the international governing body for track and field, recently adopted a more \nstringent policy of categorically excluding post-pubescent transgender women from elite athletic competitions, its \npolicy does not bar transgender women who have not experienced endogenous puberty from eligibility. See Press \nRelease, World Athletics Counsel, World Athletics Council Decides on Russia, Belarus, and Female Eligibility (Mar. 23, \n2023), https://worldathletics.org/news/press-releases/council-meeting-march-2023-russia-belarus-female-eligibility \n(last visited May 24, 2023). \n \n16  Other federal and state courts have enjoined transgender sports bans, and no categorical ban has yet been upheld \n  on appeal. See Doe v. Horne, No. CV-23-00185-TUC-JGZ, 2023 WL 4661831, at *1 (D. Ariz. July 20, 2023) (granting a \npreliminary injunction against Arizona’s categorical ban under the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX); A.M. by E.M. \nv. Indianapolis Pub. Sch., 617 F. Supp. 3d 950, 969 (S.D. Ind. July 26, 2022), appeal dismissed, No. 22-2332, 2023 WL \n371646, at *1 (7th Cir. Jan. 19, 2023) (granting a preliminary injunction against transgender participation in athletics \nunder Title IX); Roe v. Utah High School Activities Ass’n, No. 220903262, 2022 WL 3907182, at *1 (Utah Dist. Ct. Aug. \n19, 2022) (granting a preliminary injunction against a categorical ban under the Utah Constitution’s equivalent of an \nequal protection clause); see also Barrett v. State of Mont., No. DV-21-581B, at *5–7 (Mont. Dist. Ct. Sept. 14, 2022) \n(granting summary judgment against a categorical ban on the ground that only Montana public university officials \nhave the authority to regulate athletic competition in public universities). \nWe note that in B. P. J. v. W. Va. State Bd. of Educ., 550 F. Supp. 3d 347 (S.D.W. Va. 2021), a district court enjoined \nWest Virginia’s similar categorical ban, finding that B.P.J., a twelve-year-old transgender girl who wished to play \nmiddle school athletics, was likely to succeed on the merits of her equal protection and Title IX claims. See id. at \n353–57. In January 2023, the district court reversed course and granted summary judgment to the state, dissolving \nthe injunction and holding that the state’s definition of “biological sex” was “substantially related to athletic \nperformance and fairness in sports.” B. P. J. v. W. Va. State Bd. of Educ., No. 21-00316, 2023 WL 111875, at *8 \n(S.D.W. Va. Jan. 5, 2023). The Fourth Circuit stayed the district court’s January order pending appeal, and the \nSupreme Court denied the application to vacate that injunction. See W. Va. v. B. P. J., by Jackson, ––– U.S. ––––, 143 \nS. Ct. 889, ––– L.Ed.2d –––– (2023). As of this writing, transgender girls such as B. P. J. may participate in West \nVirginia school athletics. \n \n17  Idaho contends that we should dismiss the challenge to the sex dispute verification provision of the Act, because the \n  district court primarily analyzed the provision’s constitutionality as to Jane’s claim, which the parties have stipulated \nis now moot. However, Lindsay brought the same constitutional challenges to the sex dispute verification provision \nas Jane did in her complaint, and argued in her motion for preliminary injunction that she also would be subjected \nto the sex dispute verification process. Indeed, Appellants recognized that Lindsay challenged the sex dispute \nverification provision when they argued in front of the district court that “Lindsay [could not] establish an injury in \nfact  because the  State Board  of Education ha[d]  not  yet promulgated  regulations governing third-party  sex \nverification disputes,” Hecox, 469 F. Supp. 3d at 962, and that Lindsay would not have to go through the sex dispute \n29 \n \n\nHecox v. Little, 79 F.4th 1009 (2023)   \n \nprocess because her “health care provider [could] simply sign[ ] an ‘other statement’ stating that Lindsay is female.” \nId. at 964. \nThe district court reviewed these arguments and concluded that Lindsay had standing to challenge the sex dispute \nverification provision, because “it is not speculative to suggest Lindsay’s sex would be disputed.” Id. at 961. The \ncourt then held that the sex dispute verification provision likely did not survive heightened scrutiny because of the \n“injury and indignity inflicted on Jane and all other female athletes,” which includes Lindsay. Id. at 987. Thus, we \ndecline to dismiss the challenge to the sex dispute verification provision. \n \n18  The IOC has expressly disavowed invasive sex verification procedures, stating that “[c]riteria to determine eligibility \n  for  a  gender  category  should  not  include  gynecological  examinations  or  similar  forms  of  invasive  physical \nexaminations, aimed at determining an athlete’s sex, sex variations or gender.” See Int’l Olympic Comm., supra, at 5. \n \n19  Most states that have instituted categorical bans on transgender participation in student athletics have verified sex \n  via a student’s birth certificate. Oklahoma and Kentucky require a student or a student’s parent or legal guardian \nsubmit sworn affidavits to confirm their “biological sex.” See Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 70, § 27-106(D); Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. \n§ 164.2813(2). \n \n20  The partial concurrence states that it is unclear whether the Court was “enjoining all provisions of the Act or only \n  some of them.” Partial Concurrence at 1049. However, the district court granted the motion for preliminary \ninjunction in full, see Hecox, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 989, and the motion asked the district court to enjoin “enforc[ement \nof] any of the provisions of” the Act. It does not appear from the record that either party argued that the injunction \nshould apply to only certain provisions of the Act. Thus, no genuine confusion exists regarding whether the entirety \nof the Act is enjoined. \n \n21  The partial concurrence argues that we should remand this case to the district court to tailor the injunction to \n  provide the specificity that Rule 65(d)(1) requires because it is unclear whether the injunction is limited to \n“transgender women and girls who either have never undergone puberty or have suppressed their testosterone \nlevels through hormone therapy.” Partial Concurrence at 1049. The concurrence also suggests that the scope of the \ninjunction is overbroad because it might “appl[y] to transgender female athletes” who have gone through puberty \nand have not received hormone therapy. Id. at 1050. However, the district court explicitly preserved the “status \nquo” in Idaho when fashioning the injunction, stating: \n[A] preliminary injunction would not harm Defendants because it would merely maintain the status quo while \nPlaintiffs pursue their claims. If an injunction is issued, Defendants can continue to rely on the NCAA policy for \ncollege athletes and IHSSA policy for high school athletes, as they did for nearly a decade prior to the Act ... \n[N]either Defendants nor the Intervenors would be harmed by returning to this status quo. \nHecox, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 988. At the time of the injunction, both policies allowed transgender women and girls “to \ncompete on girls’ teams after completing one year of hormone therapy suppressing testosterone under the care of a \nphysician.” Id. at 947. Thus, the district court specifically stated how the injunction would apply to transgender \nfemale athletes who have gone through puberty and not received hormone therapy: those individuals would be \nrequired to conform to current NCAA and IHSSA policies circumscribing the extent of their participation in female \nathletics. \nIn any event, there is no evidence that Idaho believes the terms of the injunction “have no reasonably specific \n30 \n \n\nHecox v. Little, 79 F.4th 1009 (2023)   \n \nmeaning.” Holtzman, 762 F.2d at 726. To the contrary, only Intervenors, not Idaho, argued on appeal that the \ninjunction was vague and overbroad, indicating that Idaho school administrators have clearly understood over the \npast three years what conduct is permissible under the injunction. \n \n22  Intervenors, but not Idaho, contend that the injunction is overbroad because it extends to non-plaintiffs in light of \n  the district court’s dismissal of Lindsay’s facial challenge. However, in Doe, the Supreme Court explained that an \nas-applied claim could be “ ‘facial’ in that it is not limited to plaintiffs’ particular case, but challenges application of \nthe law more broadly.” Doe, 561 U.S. at 194, 130 S.Ct. 2811. Because the district court found that the Act harmed \n“the constitutional rights of every girl and woman athlete in Idaho,” Hecox, at 479 F. Supp. 3d at 988, it did not \nabuse its discretion in issuing a preliminary injunction against the entire category of applications of the Act. \nIn addition, as the partial concurrence persuasively argues, the district court could not accord Lindsay full relief \nwithout enjoining the Act in its entirety consistent with the principle that “an injunction ‘should be no more \nburdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs before the court.’ ” City & \nCounty of San Francisco v. Barr, 965 F.3d 753, 765 (9th Cir. 2020) (quoting L.A. Haven Hospice, Inc. v. Sebelius, 638 \nF.3d 644, 664 (9th Cir. 2011)); see also E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v.

They are all integral parts \n  of the statutory plan to exclude transgender women and girls from women’s and girls’ sports. Section 33-6203(2) \neffects a ban, or prohibition, on transgender athletes participating in sports designated for women or girls. Section \n33-6203(3), the sex verification provision, is the enforcement mechanism for the ban. Section 33-6203(2) operates \nexclusively against transgender female athletes for the reasons explained in the text. But any student—male or \nfemale, transgender or cisgender—who participates in sports designated for women or girls is subject to the \nverification provision in § 33-6203(3). \n \n2  I do not conclude that the ban is a transgender-based classification because it has a disproportionate adverse impact \n  on transgender women and girls. The Supreme Court has made clear that disproportionate impact alone does not \ntrigger heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. See Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 242, 96 S.Ct. \n2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976). \n31 \n \n\nHecox v. Little, 79 F.4th 1009 (2023)   \n \n \n3  Under the Act, cisgender men and boys may participate on men’s and boys’ teams and may do so without being \n  subject to the sex verification procedure. So can transgender men and boys. Cisgender women may participate on \nathletic teams designated for women and girls, though like all athletes on these teams, they are subject to the sex \nverification procedure that serves as the Act’s enforcement mechanism. Transgender women and girls are uniquely \ndisadvantaged under the Act: \n \n   Allowed to Participate on  Subject to Verification \n  Team Aligned with Gender  Provision if Playing on \nIdentity  Team Aligned with Gender \nIdentity \n \n \nCisgender men and boys  Yes  No \n     \nTransgender men and boys  Yes  No \n     \nCisgender women and girls  Yes  Yes* \n     \nTransgender women and  No*  Yes* \ngirls \n   \n \nAn asterisk (*) indicates a change from the policies in place before the Act’s passage. \n \n4   The verification process applies to both male and female students, as long as they join, or try to join, teams \n  designated for women or girls. It applies to: (1) cisgender female students who play on women’s and girls’ teams, as \nthe Act allows; (2) transgender female students who play on women’s and girls’ teams, as the Act prohibits; (3) \ntransgender male students (i.e., students who are assigned female at birth but identify as male) if they choose to \nplay on women’s and girls’ teams, as the Act permits; and (4) cisgender male students who play on women’s and \ngirls’ teams, as the Act prohibits, or who, like the plaintiffs in the Clark litigation discussed below, desire to do so. \nThe verification procedure does not apply to any students playing on teams designated for men or boys. \n \n5  See Hecox I, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 977 (“[T]he Act’s categorical exclusion of transgender women and girls entirely \n  eliminates their opportunity to participate in school sports.”); see id. (noting that “forcing a transgender woman to \nparticipate on a men’s team would be forcing her to be cisgender, which is ‘associated with adverse mental health \noutcomes’ ”); id. (“Participating in sports on teams that contradict one’s gender identity ‘is equivalent to gender \nidentity conversion efforts, which every major medical association has found to be dangerous and unethical.’ ”); \nLindsay Hecox decl. ¶ 37 (“I would not compete on a men’s team. I am not a man, and it would be embarrassing and \npainful to be forced onto a team for men—like constantly wearing a big sign that says ‘this person is not a “real” \n32 \n \n\nHecox v. Little, 79 F.4th 1009 (2023)   \n \nwoman.’ I would be an outcast on the men’s team.”). \n \n6  This appeal has been pending for nearly three years due to a backlog in the district court’s docket arising from the \n  COVID-19 pandemic and this court’s limited remand—conditions that the district court could not have anticipated at \nthe time it granted the preliminary injunction. \n \n7  In  January  2022,  the  NCAA  adopted  “a  sport-by-sport  approach  to  transgender  participation  that  preserves \n  opportunity for transgender student-athletes while balancing fairness, inclusion and safety for all who compete.” \nPress  Release,  NCAA,  Board  of  Governors  Updates  Transgender  Participation  Policy  (Jan.  19,  2022), \nhttps://www.ncaa.org/news/2022/1/19/media-center-board-of-governors-updates-transgender-participation-policy\n.aspx  [https://perma.cc/7ZFT-GA6L]  (last  visited  July  27,  2023).  Under  the  NCAA  standards,  transgender \nstudent-athletes are allowed to compete but may be required to “document sport-specific testosterone levels.” Id.; \nsee  also  Press  Release,  NCAA,  Transgender  Student-Athlete  Participation  Policy, \nhttps://www.ncaa.org/sports/2022/1/27/transgender-participation-policy.aspx [https://perma.cc/FH8V-VVKA] (last \nupdated  Apr.  17, 2023).  The  IOC  likewise  follows  a  sport-by-sport  approach.  See  Int’l Olympic  Comm.,  IOC \nFramework on Fairness, Inclusion and Non-Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity and Sex Variations 1 (Nov. \n22,  2021), \nhttps://stillmed.olympics.com/media/Documents/Beyond-the-Games/Human-Rights/IOC-Framework-Fairness-Inclu\nsion-Non-discrimination-2021.pdf [https://perma.cc/MX6D-Y4RG] (last visited July 27, 2023). The IOC framework \nstates that “[n]o athlete should be precluded from competing or excluded from competition on the exclusive ground \nof an unverified, alleged or perceived unfair competitive advantage due to their sex variations, physical appearance \nand/or transgender status,” and that, “[u]ntil evidence ... determines otherwise, athletes should not be deemed to \nhave an unfair or disproportionate competitive advantage due to their sex variations, physical appearance and/or \ntransgender status.” Id. at 4, 97 S.Ct. 2120. It also states that “criteria to determine eligibility for a gender category \nshould not include gynaecological examinations or similar forms of invasive physical examinations, aimed at \ndetermining an athlete’s sex, sex variations or gender.” Id. at 5, 97 S.Ct. 2120. \n \n \n \n \nEnd of Document   \n \n \n \n \n33 \n ",
