    "summary": "<p>In 2021, the Tennessee legislature passed H.B. 1182, which would require businesses and other entities that were open to the public and allowed transgender people to use the restroom of their gender to post a government-prescribed warning sign. On June 25, 2021, two Tennessee business owners filed a lawsuit challenging the law in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, the plaintiffs claimed that H.B. 1182 violated their First Amendment right against compelled speech. They brought suit against Carter Lawrence, who was the Tennessee State Fire Marshal, Christopher Bainbridge, who was the Director of Codes Enforcement, Glenn Funk, who was the District Attorney General for the 20th judicial district, and Neal Pinkston, who was the District Attorney General for the 11th judicial district. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was assigned to Judge Aleta A. Trauger.</p>\r\n<p>Along with the complaint, the plaintiffs also filed a motion for preliminary injunction on June 25, 2021, which was granted by the court on July 9, 2021. 548 F.Supp.3d 666. The defendants argued in opposition that the plaintiffs did not have standing, their claims were not ripe, and they would not be able to establish the unconstitutionality of the Act in question.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Addressing the standing issue, the court looked to see whether there was (1) injury-in-fact, (2) causation, and (3) redressability. Whether there was an injury-in-fact was the issue in this case. The court reasoned that the law was part of the state&rsquo;s formal building code, which plaintiffs must comply with, and there was a reasonable and concrete fear of enforcement that the defendants had not disproved. Therefore, it concluded that standing was not an issue in granting the preliminary injunction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In regards to whether the claims were ripe, the court stated that the ripeness requirement exists to prevent courts from getting involved in abstract disagreements. In this case, the court stated that this looked like a straightforward First Amendment challenge to a straightforward statute, so ripeness did not interfere with the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, the court looked to the merits of the plaintiff&rsquo;s First Amendment challenge. The plaintiffs contended that the law could not be upheld if it was not narrowly tailored to satisfy a compelling government purpose. The defendants argued that a lesser standard of First Amendment review should apply; however, the court stated that strict scrutiny applied in this case. Furthermore, the court reasoned that the plaintiffs had a meaningful likelihood of success even under a lesser standard. Additionally, the defendants argued that the mandated message was merely factual and uncontroversial. However, the court disagreed. It found that the legislative history of the act demonstrated that it was formulated in response to issues involving the transgender community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Then the court looked to the remaining preliminary injunction factors. The first factor the court looked at was irreparable injury to the plaintiffs. The court determined that since there was a high likelihood that this Act violated First Amendment rights, it was enough to conclude that plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm if the preliminary injunction was not granted. The second factor the court looked to was harm to the defendants/public interest. The court found that there was a high likelihood that the plaintiffs would be successful in their constitutional challenges, and it found a low likelihood that injunctive relief would harm Tennessee&rsquo;s state powers. Lastly, the court assessed the balancing of factors. Because the plaintiffs were likely to succeed, granting a preliminary injunction would help ensure that there was no irreparable harm. Therefore, the Court stated that a preliminary injunction should be granted.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 17, 2022, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, stating that the law in question was a violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution. 603 F.Supp.3d 584. The court permanently enjoined the defendants from enforcing H.B. 1182 and declared that enforcement of the law would violate the First Amendment. In addition, the court awarded the plaintiffs attorney&rsquo;s fees. It entered judgment and directed the clerk to close the case. The case is now closed.&nbsp;</p>",

Funk,  and  DAG  Neal  Pinkston  have  filed  a \nResponse (Doc. No. 21). For the reasons set out herein, the motion will be granted. \nI. INTRODUCTION \nThe State of Tennessee has enacted a law ordering the plaintiffs to say something that \nthey do not wish to say, in furtherance of a message they do not agree with. The plaintiffs \nchallenge that law on the basis that the First Amendment typically does not permit such a \nmandate unless it is narrowly tailored to satisfy a compelling government purpose. Because the \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 1 of 31 PageID #: 201\n\nplaintiffs are likely to succeed on their challenge to that law and because allowing the law to be \nenforced while this litigation proceeds would harm them irreparably, the court will grant a \npreliminary injunction against the lawโs enforcement. \nII. BACKGROUND \n   \nA. The Parties \n1.  Plaintiffs.  Bongo  is  a  Nashville-based  limited  liability  company  that  operates  a \nnumber of coffeehouses and restaurants, namely Bongo Java, Bongo East, Game Point, Grins \nVegetarian Cafe, andโparticularly relevant to this caseโFido. Robert Bernstein is Bongoโs \nfounder and chief manager. (Doc. No. 7-1 ยถยถ 1โ2.) Bernstein states that โBongo has employed \ntransgender  people,โ  โBongoโs  and  Fidoโs  patrons  include  members  of  the  transgender \ncommunity,โ and Bongo has โworked over the years to create a welcoming environment for \nmembers  of  the  LGBTQ  community.โ  (Id.  ยถยถ  6โ7.)  Recently,  โFidoโs  staff  decorated  the \nrestaurantโs specialty drinks sign with transgender and LGBTQ pride flag colors.โ (Id. ยถ 8.) Like \nmany  restaurants,  Fido  โhas  multi-user  sex-designated  restroom  facilities.โ  (Id.  ยถ  3.)  Until \nrecently, Fidoโs management, according to Bernstein, never gave much thought to its rules, if \nany, about who could use which restroom, but its โinformal policy was to never tell any person \nthat they could not use a particular sex-designated restroom, and to allow transgender people to \nuse the restroom that matched their gender identity.โ (Id. ยถ 11.) No one ever complained to \nBernstein about that approach. (Id. ยถ 12.) \nSanctuary is โa performing arts venue, community center and safe haven located in \nChattanooga,  Tennessee.โ  (Doc.  No.  7-2  ยถ  3.)  It  was  โfounded  by  .  .  .  members  of  the \ntransgender community in December 2020 to serve the needs of transgender and intersex people \nof all ages, as well as other LGBTQ people and allies.โ (Id. ยถ 4.) Most of its staff and volunteers \n2 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 2 of 31 PageID #: 202\n\nare transgender. (Id. ยถ 5.) Sanctuary has three restrooms, two of which are multi-user restrooms. \nNone of the restrooms has a sex or gender designation, and anyone is free to use any restroom. \n(Id. ยถ 7.)  According to Sanctuary owner and  co-founder Kye Sayers, however,  โSanctuary \nintends [in July of 2021] to begin operating a full-service cafรฉ and will be required by the local \nbuilding code to post a sex-designation on its two multi-user restrooms.โ (Id. ยถ 8.) Once those \ndesignations are added, Sanctuaryโs policy will be to โcontinue to allow transgender people to \nuse the restroom that accords with their gender identity.โ (Id.) \n2. Defendants. Carter Lawrence is the Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of \nCommerce  and  Insurance.  Part  of  his  duties,  as  Commissioner,  is  serving  as  the  State  of \nTennesseeโs Fire Marshall. The State Fire Marshall is one of several officials with concurrent \njurisdiction to enforce the State of Tennesseeโs building code. Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 68-120-106. \nChristopher Bainbridge is Commissioner/Marshall Lawrenceโs Director of Codes Enforcement. \nSee Heun Kim v. State, No. W201800762COAR3CV, 2019 WL 921039, at *3 (Tenn. Ct. App. \nFeb.  26,  2019).  Glenn  R.  Funk  and  Neal  Pinkston  are  the  District  Attorneys  General  of, \nrespectively, Tennesseeโs 20th and 11th Judicial Districts. They are attorney public officials \nempowered to represent the State of Tennessee in criminal prosecutions. See Tenn. Code Ann. \nยงยง 8-7-103, 40-3-104. \nB. The Act \n  Tennessee law requires that โ[p]ublicly and privately owned facilities where the public \ncongregates shall be equipped with sufficient temporary or permanent restrooms to meet the \nneeds of the public at peak hours.โ Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 68-120-503(a). The law also envisions \nthat, generally speaking, there will be restrooms โprovided for womenโ as well as restrooms \nโprovided . . . for men,โ which must be available in adequate ratios. Id.; see Tenn. Comp. R. & \n3 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 3 of 31 PageID #: 203\n\nRegs. 0780-02-18-.03 (discussing โminimum number of water closetsโ). Outside of those basic \nrequirements, however, the State of Tennessee has, historically, not been much in the business of \nregulating  how  private  businesses  navigate  the  question  of  who  is  permitted  to  use  which \nrestroom. \n  On April 29, 2021, however, the Tennessee General Assembly passed H.B. 1182/S.B. \n1224, which the Governor signed into law on May 17, 2021 and which this court will refer to as \nโthe Act.โ (See Doc. No. 1-1 at 4.) The Act went into effect on July 1, 2021. (Id.) Subsection (a) \nof the Act, in its own words, requires that any  \npublic or private entity or business that operates a building or facility open to the \ngeneral public and that, as a matter of formal or informal policy, allows a member \nof either biological sex to use any public restroom within the building or facility \nshall post notice of the policy at the entrance of each public restroom in the \nbuilding or facility. \n \nAct ยง 1(a). The Act defines โpolicyโ to mean โthe internal policy of a public or private entity or \nsuch policy as the result of a rule, ordinance, or resolution adopted by an agency or political \nsubdivision of this state.โ Act ยง 1(d)(1). It defines โpublic restroomโ as any โlocker room, \nshower facility, dressing area, or other facility or area that is . . . [o]pen to the general public; \n[d]esignated for a specific biological sex; and [a] facility or area where a person would have a \nreasonable expectation of privacy.โ Act ยง 1(d)(2).1 That definition โ[e]xcludes a unisex, single-\n \n1 The language stating that the Act applies only to restrooms โ[d]esignated for a specific biological sexโ is \nsomewhat  confusing.  The  court  doubts  that  many,  if  any,  restrooms  in  the  state  used  the  phrase \nโbiological sexโ on their signage prior to the enactment of the Act. However, the legislative history of the \nAct, which the court will discuss infra, makes clear that the General Assembly intended the Act to reach \nany restroom with a verbal designation such as โmenโ or, by extension, a visual designation such as an \nicon appearing to wear gendered clothing. Tennessee caselaw is clear that, โ[w]hen construing a statute, \nthe intent of the legislature must prevail,โ at least as long as the legislatureโs intent can be reconciled with \nthe โnatural and ordinary meaning of the language in the statute, within the context of the entire statute.โ \nYoung v. Frist Cardiology, PLLC, 599 S.W.3d 568, 571 (Tenn. 2020) (citing Lee Med., Inc. v. Beecher, \n312 S.W.3d 515, 526โ27 (Tenn. 2010)). This court, moreover, is constitutionally bound to interpret the \nAct in the manner that it believes that the Tennessee Supreme Court would. In re Fair Fin. Co., 834 F.3d \n651, 671 (6th Cir. 2016) (discussing Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S. Ct. 817 (1938)).The \ncourt, accordingly, construes the statute to apply to restrooms that, in addition to meeting the other \n4 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 4 of 31 PageID #: 204\n\noccupant  restroom  or  family  restroom  intended  for  use  by  either  biological  sex.โ  Act  ยง \n1(d)(2)(B). \nAlthough  subsection  (a)  of  the  Act,  on  its  face,  requires  only  a  posted  โnotice,โ \nsubsection (b) mandates, in detail, the form that that notice must take: \nSignage of the notice must be posted in a manner that is easily visible to a person \nentering the public restroom and must meet the following requirements:  \n \n(1) Be at least eight inches (8โ) wide and six inches (6โ) tall;  \n \n(2) The top one-third (1/3) of the sign must have a background color of red \nand state โNOTICEโ in yellow text, centered in that portion of the sign;  \n \n(3) The bottom two-thirds (2/3) of the sign must contain in boldface, block \nletters the following statement centered on that portion of the sign:  \n \nTHIS  FACILITY  MAINTAINS  A  POLICY  OF  ALLOWING \nTHE USE OF RESTROOMS BY EITHER BIOLOGICAL SEX, \nREGARDLESS OF THE DESIGNATION ON THE RESTROOM  \n \n(4) Except as provided in subdivision (b)(2), have a background color of \nwhite with type in black; and  \n \n(5) Be located on a door to which the sign must be affixed or have its \nleading edge located not more than one foot (1โ) from the outside edge of \nthe frame of a door to which the sign must be affixed. \n \nAct ยง 1(b). The Act gives any entity or business that is in violation of the Act thirty days from \nbeing โnotified that it is not in complianceโ to post the required signage, after which โactionโ \nmay be โtaken against the entity or business.โ Act ยง 1(c). Because the Act is situated in the \nstateโs building code, a violation of the Actโthat is, not placing a sign and then refusing, after \nthirty days, to do soโis a Class B misdemeanor. Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 68-120-108(a). Violations \nof the building code may also lead to a โstop workโ order from the State Fire Marshall directed at \n \nrequirements of the statute, are designated for use by any specific sex or gender in the ordinary manner in \nwhich such designations are typically made in Tennessee, such as, for example, with a sign reading \nโMenโ or โWomen.โ \n \n5 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 5 of 31 PageID #: 205\n\nany โerection, construction or alteration, execution or repairโ of the regulated building. Tenn. \nCode Ann. ยง 68-120-107(a). \nWhy did the General Assembly adopt the Act, more than two centuries into the Stateโs \nexistence  and  after  seemingly  many  decades  of  public  restrooms  being  commonplace  in \nTennessee, and in America, without the need for such signage? The court, of course, cannot \npurport to know all of the dynamics that go into each legislatorโs individual decision to support a \nbill. However, the Actโs sponsor, Representative Tim Rudd, explained that he introduced the Act \nbecause he was concerned about โ[n]ew executive orders . . . and new legislation proposed in \nCongress giving transgenders [sic] rights and extending those rights.โ He explained, though, that \nthe law was โnot aimed at transgenders [sic].โ2 Rather, he was concerned, he said, about the \npossibility  of  hypothetical  sexual  predators  who  would  โtake  advantage  ofโ  some  public \nrestroom policies to โassault[] or rape[]โ other restroom users.3 Shortly before that declaration, \nRudd was asked by Tennessee House Speaker Pro Tempore Pat Marsh whether the State was \nโhaving a problem with this now, that you know of . . . anywhere.โ Rudd was unable to provide \nany examples or evidence of such a problem. Instead, he explained that โ[w]e shouldnโt wait for \npeopleโs rights to be abusedโ in order to act and potentially prevent โan attack.โ4 At another \nhearing a few weeks later, Representative Rudd offered an alternative explanation for the law: \nthat it is โshocking and a danger to people when they walk into a restroom marked โmenโ or \n \n2 Debate of H.B. 1182 Before the H.

The plaintiffs have filed a Declaration by Dr. Shayne Sebold \nTaylor, M.D., to provide some medical background regarding issues related to the Act. (Doc. No. \n7-3.) Dr. Taylor is an Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics at Vanderbilt \nUniversity Medical Center and the Monroe Carrell Jr. Childrenโs Hospital, both in Nashville. (Id. \nยถ 2.) Dr. Taylor explains that, from a medical perspective, the category of โsexโ is โfar more \ncomplex than what is seen on genital examโโthe mechanism through which individuals are \ntypically assigned a sex designation at birth. (Id. ยถ 13.) Rather, the concept of sex implicates \na complex compilation of multiple factors including oneโs chromosomal make up \n(XX for those assigned female at birth, XY for those assigned male at birth), \ngonadal sex (presence of ovaries or testes), fetal hormonal sex (production of sex \nhormones by the fetus or exogenous exposure of sex hormones to the developing \nfetus), pubertal hormonal sex (the change in hormonal milieu that results in the \ndevelopment of secondary sexual characteristicsโfacial hair and deep voice for \nthose assigned male at birth, breasts and menstrual cycles for those assigned \nfemale), hypothalamic sex (variations in brain structure and function as a result of \nembryonal exposure of sex hormones), and gender identity. \n \n(Id.) Unsurprisingly, given the general diversity of human minds and bodies, there โcan be \nvariationsโ among the many potential combinations of those factors. (Id. ยถ 14.) Dr. Taylor \nexplains  that,  โ[f]or  example,  many  children  are  born  with  ambiguous  genitalia,โ  a  sexual \npresentation generally described as being โintersex.โ (Id.)  \nSuch variations are not limited to outward characteristics. Dr. Taylor explains that, while \nthere are two โtypical human chromosomal make upsโ considered male and female, there are \nalso other chromosomal configurations that naturally occur in the human population. (Id.) Male \n \n5  Discussion of H.B. 1182 Before H. Floor Sess., 18th Legis. Day at 1:51:00, 112th Gen. Assemb. (Mar. \n29, 2021), at http://tnga.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=610&clip_id=24423&meta_id=579987. \n7 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 7 of 31 PageID #: 207\n\npatients with Klinefelter Syndrome, for example, have an extra X chromosome, while female \npatients with Turner Syndrome are, compared to most individuals assigned female at birth, \nmissing  an  X  chromosome.  These  chromosomal  variations  often  lead  to  physical  and \ndevelopmental differences, such as the development of breasts in patients genitally identified as \nmale. (Id.) In light of this complexity and variation, Dr. Taylor explains, the term โbiological \nsexโ โhas no place or meaning in either science or medicine, because experts who study sex and \ngender understand that the biology and identity of a human being is far more complex than what \ncan be identified on an individualโs genital anatomy or chromosomal evaluation.โ (Id. ยถ 28.) \n  Dr. Taylor explains that โgender identityโ is an internal, psychological phenomenon that \nis conceptually distinct from any particular physical trait. Rather, โ[g]ender identity is a personโs \ninner sense of belonging to a particular gender.โ (Id. ยถ 15.) Although there may be disagreement \namong Americans about the normative question of what role gender identity should play in \nvarious  situations,  the  purely  descriptive  fact  that  gender  identity,  as  a  type  of  internally \nexperienced phenomenon, exists is supported by both medical research and, at least for many \npeople, confirmed by the ordinary experience of being a human. Also beyond reasonable dispute \nis the fact that many people report experiencing a gender identity that is inconsistent with the sex \nthat they were assigned at birth based on a genital exam. If an individualโs gender identity differs \nfrom their sex assigned at birth, that person is typically referred to as โtransgender.โ (Id. ยถ 17.) \nAccording to Dr. Taylor, a 2016 study estimated that about 31,000 transgender people live in \nTennessee. (Id. ยถ 27.) \n  As Dr. Taylor explains, the โlack of alignment of assigned sex and gender identity can \nresult in severe distress, depression, [and] anxiety,โ a โconstellation of symptoms . . . termed \ngender dysphoria.โ (Id. ยถ 19.) As with any psychological condition that has a demonstrated \n8 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 8 of 31 PageID #: 208\n\nnegative  effect  on  individualsโ  lives,  treatments  have  been  developed  to  address  gender \ndysphoria. In particular, many individuals who have experienced gender dysphoria elect to \nundergo  โgender  transition,โ  a  โlengthy  process  with  multiple  components,โ  including, \npotentially, โsocial transition, medical transition,6 and surgical transition.โ (Id. ยถ 21.) โSocial \ntransition can include going by a different name, using different pronouns, or changing oneโs \nhaircut . . . or clothing to match oneโs gender identity.โ (Id. ยถ 22.) At least for many individuals, \nsuccessful social transition means being able to โseamlessly incorporate into their communities \nwith a presentation that matches with their gender identity.โ (Id. ยถ 23.) In order to do so, the \nindividual, if confronted with a situation in which they need to select a restroom designated as \nfor men or for women, may select the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity. (Id.) \nThe plaintiffs have provided medical publications establishing that Dr. Taylorโs view of these \nmatters is not uniqueโnamely, a piece from The Lancet regarding the โmisuses of โbiological \nsexโโ and a publication of the Annals of Internal Medicine entitled โCare of the Transgender \nPatient.โ (Doc. Nos. 7-5 & -6.) \n2. The Plaintiffsโ Concerns. Bernstein and Sayers have both expressed a desire not to \npost the required signage in their respective businesses. Bernstein states that he believes that \nโposting the warning notice required by H.B. 1182 will offend [Fidoโs] staff, customers, friends, \nand familyโ and that Bongo โcould lose staff and customers if forced to post this sign.โ (Doc. \n \n6 Dr. Taylor explains that medical and surgical transition can lead to changes in physical presentation \neven greater than changes to clothing, hair, makeup, or other non-medical external gender expressions. \nFor example, a transgender man might undergo testosterone treatments that would allow him to grow a \nfull beard and develop a deep voice, although the individual had been designated female at birth and, \nprior to medical transition, had not had those physical characteristics. (Doc. No. 7-3 ยถ 26.) Accordingly, \nan individual who has undergone medical transition, but who is then required to use the restroom \ncorresponding to their sex assigned at birth, might, as a practical matter, give other users of the restroom \nthe impression that the individual was disregarding the restroomโs gender or sex designation by, for \nexample, having a full beard and deep voice, as well as potentially male-coded clothing, in a restroom \ndesignated as for women. \n9 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 9 of 31 PageID #: 209\n\nNo. 7-1 ยถ 14.) He is also โconcerned that the required warning notice could create confusion for \n[the restaurantโs] customers, clients and employees.โ (Id. ยถ 15.) On a personal level, he states that \nhe  โfind[s]  the  message  communicated  by  H.B.  1182  offensive,  and  [he]  object[s]  to  the \ngovernment requiring [him] to post a controversial warning notice in [his] businessesโ that he \nperceives to be โideologically motivated and inaccurate.โ (Id. ยถ 16.)  \nSayers  is  โconcerned  that  the  warning  notice  will  make  transgender  and  intersex \npeople . . . feel that their presence is viewed as alarming, and that they will be offended by the \nterm  โbiological  sexโ  because  of  the  political  controversy  and  anti-transgender  animus \nsurrounding that phrase.โ (Doc. No. 7-2 ยถ 10.) Sayers claims to have โimmediately understood \nthe term โbiological sexโ to be stigmatizing to transgender people and believe[s] [Sanctuaryโs] \nclients will as well.โ (Id. ยถ 11.) Sayers also objects that the Act โwill send a message that erases \nthe existence of intersex people by suggesting that there are only two โbiological sexes.โโ (Id. ยถ \n12.) Sayers โfear[s] that Sanctuary will lose staff, community members and supporters if [it] \ndisplay[s] the warning notice.โ (Id. ยถ 14.) \nD. This Litigation \n  On June 25, 2021, the plaintiffs filed their Complaint in this case. (Doc. No. 1.) They \nstate a single count, Count 1, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, for โviolat[ing] Plaintiffsโ rights \nunder the First Amendment to the United States Constitution by compelling them, on pain of \ncriminal penalty, to communicate a misleading and controversial government-mandated message \nthat they would not otherwise display.โ (Id. ยถ 85.) Contemporaneously with the Complaint, they \nfiled a Motion for Preliminary Injunction asking the court to enjoin the enforcement of the Act. \n(Doc. No. 6 at 1.) \n \n10 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 10 of 31 PageID #: 210\n\nIII. LEGAL STANDARD \nโFour factors determine when a court should grant a preliminary injunction: (1) whether \nthe party moving for the injunction is facing immediate, irreparable harm, (2) the likelihood that \nthe movant will succeed on the merits, (3) the balance of the equities, and (4) the public interest.โ \nD.T. v. Sumner Cnty. Sch., 942 F.3d 324, 326 (6th Cir. 2019) (citing Benisek v. Lamone, 138 S. \nCt. 1942, 1943โ44 (2018); Wright & Miller, 11A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. ยง 2948 (3d ed. & Supp. \n2019)). The district court must โweigh the strength of the four factors against one another,โ with \nthe qualification that irreparable harm is an โindispensableโ requirement, without which there is \nโno need to grant relief now as opposed to at the end of the lawsuit.โ Id. (citing Friendship \nMaterials,  Inc.  v.  Mich.  Brick,  Inc.,  679  F.2d  100,  105  (6th  Cir.  1982)).  Aside  from  the \nirreparable harm requirement, โno one factor is controlling, [but] a finding that there is simply no \nlikelihood of success on the merits is usually fatal.โ Gonzales v. Natโl Bd. of Med. Examโrs, 225 \nF.3d 620, 625 (6th Cir. 2000) (citing Mich. State AFLโCIO v. Miller, 103 F.3d 1240, 1249 (6th \nCir. 1997)). \nIV. ANALYSIS \nA. Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nA moving party must establish at least a meaningful โ[p]robability of successโ in order \nfor a preliminary injunction to issue.7 Garlock, Inc. v. United Seal Inc., 404 F.2d 256, 257 (6th \nCir. 1968); see also Golf Vill. N. LLC v. City of Powell, Ohio, 333 F. Supp. 3d 769, 775 (S.D. \nOhio 2018). The defendants argue that the plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed for three reasons: (1) \n \n7 โThe courts use a bewildering variety of formulations of the need for showing some likelihood of \nsuccessโthe most common being that plaintiff must demonstrate a reasonable probability of success. But \nthe verbal differences do not seem to reflect substantive disagreement. All courts agree that plaintiff must \npresent a prima facie case but need not show a certainty of winning.โ Wright & Miller, 11A Fed. Prac. & \nProc. Civ. ยง 2948.3 (3d ed.) (citations omitted). \n11 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 11 of 31 PageID #: 211\n\nthey lack standing; (2) their claims are not ripe; and (3) they are unlikely to establish that the Act \nis unconstitutional. \n1. Standing. Article III of the Constitution grants the federal courts jurisdiction only over \nโcases and controversies,โ of which the component of standing is an โessential and unchanging \npart.โ Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992); see also Warth v. Seldin, 422 \nU.S. 490, 498 (1975). A party seeking to invoke the courtโs jurisdiction must establish the \nnecessary standing to sue before the court may consider the merits of that partyโs cause of action. \nWhitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 154 (1990). To establish standing under the Constitution, a \nplaintiff must show that: (1) he has suffered an โinjury in factโ that is (a) concrete and (b) \nparticularized, as well as (c) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) the injury is \nfairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to \nmerely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by the relief requested. Gaylor v. Hamilton \nCrossing CMBS, 582 F. Appโx 576, 579โ80 (6th Cir. 2014) (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560โ61); \nsee also Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180โ81 \n(2000).  These  mandatory  minimum  constitutional  requirementsโcommonly  known  as  (1) \ninjury-in-fact, (2) causation, and (3) redressabilityโapply in every case. The defendants argue \nthat the plaintiffs cannot meet the first requirement, an injury-in-fact that is imminent, not merely \nconjectural or hypothetical, because the Act has not yet been enforced against them and they do \nnot know, with certainty, that it will be. \nAs the plaintiffs note, however, Article III does not require a plaintiff to engage in โcostly \nfutile  gestures  simply  to  establish  standing,  particularly  when  the  First  Amendment  is \nimplicated.โ Lac Vieux  Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians v. Mich. Gaming \nControl Bd., 172 F.3d 397, 406 (6th Cir. 1999) (citing Virginia v. Am. Booksellers Assโn, Inc., \n12 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 12 of 31 PageID #: 212\n\n484 U.S. 383, 392โ93 (1988); Clements v. Fashing, 457 U.S. 957, 962 (1982)). To the contrary, \nit is well established that โan actual arrest, prosecution, or other enforcement action is not a \nprerequisite to challengingโ the constitutionality of a law regulating an organizationโs ongoing \nand expected future behavior. Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014) \n(citing MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, 128โ29 (2007); Steffel v. Thompson, \n415 U.S. 452, 459 (1974)). Nor is a plaintiff required to โexpose himself to liability before \nbringing suit.โ MedImmune, 549 U.S. at 129. A plaintiff may, for example, establish an injury-\nin-fact  based  on  its  โintention  to  engage  in  a  course  of  conduct  arguably  affected  with  a \nconstitutional interest, but proscribed by a statute.โ Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat. Union, \n442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979).  \nA plaintiff can also establish an imminent injury by showing that it was forced to alter its \nbehavior based on a reasonable fear of enforcement. See Clements, 457 U.S. at 962 (finding \nstanding where plaintiffs alleged that, โbut for the . . . provision they seek to challenge, they \nwould engage in the very acts that would trigger the enforcement of the provisionโ). Finally, the \ncaselaw recognizes that an injury-in-fact can arise, not merely out of actual or even expected \nenforcement  actions,  but  also  โcostly,  self-executing  compliance  burdensโ  or  because  the \nchallenged law โchills protected First Amendment activity.โ Natโl Rifle Assโn of Am. v. Magaw, \n132 F.3d 272, 279 (6th Cir. 1997) (citation omitted); accord Hyman v. City of Louisville, 53 F. \nAppโx 740, 743 (6th Cir. 2002); see also Am. Booksellers, 484 U.S. at 392 (finding standing \nbecause  โplaintiffs  .  .  . ,  if  their  interpretation  of  the  statute  is  correct,  will  have  to  take \nsignificant and costly compliance measures or risk criminal prosecutionโ) (citing Craig v. Boren, \n429 U.S. 190, 194 (1976); Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 188 (1973)); Ohio Coal Assโn v. Perez, \n192 F. Supp. 3d 882, 902 (S.D. Ohio 2016) (โ[A]dditional compliance burdens may serve as an \n13 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 13 of 31 PageID #: 213\n\ninjury in fact.โ) (citing All. for Nat. Health U.S. v. Sebelius, 775 F. Supp. 2d 114, 120โ21 \n(D.D.C. 2011)). A plaintiff can establish standing to challenge a law by showing that the law โis \ndirected at [the plaintiff] in particular[,] . . . requires [the plaintiff] to make significant changes in \n[its]  everyday . . . practices[,  and]  .  .  .  expose[s  the  plaintiff]  to  the  imposition  of  strong \nsanctionsโ for noncompliance. Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 154 (1967), abrogated on \nother grounds, Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977).  \nThe plaintiffsโ claims fall well within the ordinary, well-established boundaries of pre-\nenforcement standing in the First Amendment context. The Act is not some obscure provision \nthat might plausibly fall to the wayside, be forgotten and never be enforced. It is part of the \nstateโs  formal  building  code,  a  code  with  which  businesses  such  as  the  plaintiffsโ  have \nlongstanding and well-established expectations that they must comply. Conspicuously, although \nthe defendants attempt to foster a sense of mystery regarding how, whether, and when the Act \nwill be enforced, they do not actually take the position that Tennessee businesses can safely \nignore the portions of the building code they disagree with. The legislative history of the Act, \nmoreover,  shows  an  affirmative  intent  that  the  Act  be  enforced  immediately,  before  any \nsupposed risk of harm can materialize, and there is no evidence that the Stateโs executive \nbranchโled by the Governor who promptly signed the Actโdisagrees with that position.  \nThe defendants point out that DAG Funk has reportedly voiced an intention not to \nenforce the Act, but that is little comfort to Sanctuary, which is not in Nashville, where the 20th \nJudicial District is located. Moreover, the defendants have not identified any reason why a \nsupposed promise of non-enforcement from DAG Funk would prevent the state-level defendants \nfrom exercising their own authority to find Bongo in violation of the Act. It would be one thing \nif DAG Funk had, in effect, the unilateral power to suspend any portion of the stateโs building \n14 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 14 of 31 PageID #: 214\n\ncode within the boundaries of his jurisdiction. The defendants, however, make no such claim. \nQuite to the contrary, the stateโs building code explicitly envisions โconcurrent jurisdictionโ that \nincludes the State Fire Marshall, who โis authorized to employ such technicians as [he] may \ndeem necessary for the proper enforcement ofโ the code. Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 68-120-106(a); see \nalso Barry v. Commissioners of Com. & Ins. for State of Tenn., No. 01A01-9404-CH-00156, \n1994 WL 485588, at *1 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 9, 1994) (โThe Commissioner is empowered . . . to \nserve as the state fire marshall and to enforce the . . . building safety standards.โ). \nThis might be quite a different case if each of the defendant officials had given the court \na meaningful reason to expect that he will not enforce the Act. The defendants, however, seek to \nhave it both waysโto pretend that no one knows how the Act will be enforced, despite the fact \nthat, of course, they know, because they will be among the ones doing the enforcing, and they are \nsimply keeping their plans to themselves. Once the plaintiffs made a sufficient showing of an \ninjury-in-fact based on their reasonable and concrete fear of enforcement (and fear of the harms \nthat would arise if they complied with the Act to avoid enforcement), the defendants could have \nnegated that showing by presenting evidence that the plaintiffsโ fears were unfoundedโthat \nthere was nothing to worry about, because the State of Tennessee was going to, or even likely \nwould, use its enforcement discretion to leave the plaintiffs alone. The defendants offered no \nsuch assurances and made no such showing.8 The issue of standing, therefore, does not pose an \nimpediment to the plaintiffsโ likelihood of success. \n \n8 Indeed, even DAG Funk himself filed no declaration stating that he will decline to enforce the Act, and \nmembers of the General Assembly have begun to take steps to attempt to force or pressure DAG Funk to \nenforce the Act, because nonenforcement would be a โtransgressionโ of DAG Funkโs duty to enforce the \nStateโs criminal laws in the 20th Judicial District. See Mariah Timms, Nashville DA maintains opposition \nto law; Won't apply transgender bathroom usage measure, Tennessean, June 10, 2021, at A5.  And \nRepresentative John D. Ragan, the Chair of the House Government Operations Committee, is seeking an \nopinion from the Stateโs Attorney General and Reporter regarding whether DAG Funk could be subjected \n15 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 15 of 31 PageID #: 215\n\n2. Ripeness. โA claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon โcontingent future \nevents that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.โโ Texas v. United States, \n523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998) (quoting Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co., 473 U.S. 568, \n580โ81  (1985)).  The  ripeness  requirement  exists,  in  part,  to  โprevent  the  courts,  through \navoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements.โ \nAbbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 148. The Supreme Court has suggested that the analysis of whether a \ncase is ripe for review is best conducted โin a twofold aspect, requiring the Court โto evaluate \nboth the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding \ncourt consideration.โโ Magaw, 132 F.3d at 285 (quoting Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 149).  \nโThe ripeness doctrine,โ as it has traditionally been understood, โis drawn both from \nArticle III limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to exercise \njurisdiction.โ Beech v. City of Franklin, Tenn., 687 F. Appโx 454, 457 (6th Cir. 2017) (quoting \nNatโl Park Hosp. Assโn v. Depโt of Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 808 (2003)). Recent cases have raised \nsome doubt with regard to whether the latter, purely prudential aspects of ripeness continue to \nprovide an independent basis for dismissing a case. See Miller v. City of Wickliffe, Ohio, 852 \nF.3d 497, 503 n.2 (6th Cir. 2017) (discussing questionable vitality of prudential ripeness in the \nwake of Lexmark Intโl, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 125โ28 (2014)); \nsee also Driehaus, 573 U.S. at 167 (same); Clark v. City of Seattle, 899 F.3d 802, 809 n.4 (9th \nCir. 2018) (same); but see Wyoming v. Zinke, 871 F.3d 1133, 1141 (10th Cir. 2017) (treating \nprudential ripeness as an exception to Lexmark). As a practical matter, however, even if the \n \nto โdisciplinary action or removalโ for his apparent disinclination to enforce the Act. See Mariah Timms, \nNashville DA maintains opposition to law; Lawmaker asks attorney general if Nashville DA not enforcing \nanti-trans law is grounds for removal, June 17, 2021, at \nhttps://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2021/06/17/tennessee-attorney-general-review-nashville-\nda-decision-enforce-anti-trans-bathroom-law/7733386002/.  \n \n16 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 16 of 31 PageID #: 216\n\nprudential foundations of ripeness have been undermined, no party to this case has identified any \nsubstantive change in the law of ripeness corresponding to such developments. \nAs the Sixth Circuit has observed, โ[t]he line between Article III standing and ripeness in \npreenforcement First Amendment challengesโ is so slim that it has, in effect, โevaporated.โ \nWinter v. Wolnitzek, 834 F.3d 681, 687 (6th Cir. 2016) (citing Driehaus, 573 U.S. at 165โ67). \nEven if there were some fine distinction between the two, moreover, the defendants have not \nidentified any basis for the courtโs analysis on the constitutional aspects of ripeness to differ \nfrom its analysis regarding standing. Insofar as there are any prudential considerations that might \nbear on the issue of ripeness, they similarly provide no obstacle to the courtโs consideration of \nthe plaintiffsโ claims. Although the defendants make general gestures in the direction of the need \nfor more โfactual developmentโ of the plaintiffsโ claims, it is not clear to the court why such \ndevelopment  would  be  necessary,  let  alone  required.  (Doc.  No.  21  at  9.)  This  is  a  fairly \nstraightforward, single-count First Amendment  challenge to  a fairly straightforward, single-\npurpose statute. The plaintiffs chose to go forward without waiting to develop more of a record, \nand, because all of the constitutional requirements for considering the case have been met, that \nwas their choice to make. The issue of ripeness, like the issue of standing, does not stand in the \nway of the plaintiffsโ demonstrating a likelihood of success on the merits, if that is what the \nsubstantive law supports. \n3. Merits of First Amendment Challenge. โ[T]he right of freedom of thought protected \nby the First Amendment against state action includes both the right to speak freely and the right \nto refrain from speaking at all.โ Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 714 (1977). Moreover, when \na law not only requires an individual to speak but mandates what he will say, then courts must \ntreat  the  law  as  โtarget[ing]  speech  based  on  its  communicative  contentโ  and  therefore \n17 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 17 of 31 PageID #: 217\n\nโpresumptively unconstitutional,โ only to be upheld โif the government proves that [the law is] \nnarrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests.โ EMW Womenโs Surgical Ctr., P.S.C. v. \nBeshear, 920 F.3d 421, 425 (6th Cir. 2019) (quoting Natโl Inst. of Fam. & Life Advocs. v. \nBecerra, 138 S. Ct. 2361, 2371 (2018)). In short, โ[c]ompelling individuals to mouth support for \nviews they find objectionable violates [a] cardinal constitutional commandโ unless justified by \nthe strongest of rationales. Janus v. Am. Fedโn of State, Cnty., & Mun. Emps., Council 31, 138 S. \nCt. 2448, 2463 (2018).  \nThe caselaw on this subject does not mince words. For example, the Sixth Circuit has \nrecognized that โcompelling an individual โto utter what is not in [her] mindโ and indeed what \nshe might find deeply offensiveโ is โthe most aggressive form of viewpoint discrimination.โ \nWard  v.  Polite,  667  F.3d  727,  733  (6th  Cir.  2012).  Particularly  repugnant  to  the  First \nAmendment is when the government forces a private party to voice the governmentโs compelled \nmessage, not merely in private or in direct dealings with government itself, but โin public,โ as an \ninvoluntary โinstrument for fostering public adherence to an ideological point of view.โ Wooley, \n430 U.S. at 715. The Supreme Court has even suggested that โsuch compulsion so plainly \nviolates the Constitutionโ that it is rare for the courts to even have to step in to enforce the \nprohibition against it. Janus, 138 S. Ct. at 2464. On its face, the Act unambiguously mandates \nthat the plaintiffs and other regulated parties speak a particular message, in public, that they have \nshown, with evidence, that they earnestly consider to be anathema to their beliefs and values. It \neven tells them what colors to use: red and yellow, like a hazard sign. That the First Amendment \nwould look askance at such a practice, therefore, should surprise no one. \nThe requirement that a law, due to its encroachment on core constitutional protections, \ncan only be reconciled with the Constitution if it is narrowly tailored to serve compelling state \n18 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 18 of 31 PageID #: 218\n\ninterests is typically referred to as the lawโs being subject to โstrict scrutiny.โ Ams. for Prosperity \nFound. v. Bonta, No. 19-251, 2021 WL 2690268, at *7 (U.S. July 1, 2021). The defendants do \nnot expressly argue that the Act would survive strict scrutiny, although they do passingly suggest \nthat it is โnarrowly tailoredโ to serve a โcompelling interest,โ which is effectively the same thing. \n(Doc. No. 21 at 17.) In any event, the defendants were wise not to put too many of their eggs in \nthe โsurviving strict scrutinyโ basket, because there is simply no basis whatsoever for concluding \nthat the Act is narrowly tailored to serve any compelling governmental purpose. Although at \nleast one key supporter of the Act in the General Assembly justified its requirements in relation \nto supposed risks of sexual assault and rape, there is (1) no evidence, in either the legislative \nrecord or the record of this case, that there is any problem of individualsโ abusing private \nbathroom  policies  intended  to  accommodate  transgender  and  intersex  individuals  for  that \npurpose and (2) no reason to think that, if such a problem existed, the mandated signs would \naddress it. Indeed, the defendants do not even attempt to argue that such fears are well-founded, \nlet alone compelling. See Janus, 138 S. Ct. at 2465 (holding that, even assuming a compelling \npurpose, the law at issue would fail judicial review because there was โno evidence that the \npandemonium . . . imagined would result if [the law] were not allowedโ). \nEven  if  one  were  to  assume,  more  modestly,  that  there  is  a  compelling  interest  in \nallowing patrons of a business to know its bathroom policiesโwhich the court finds doubtfulโ\nthen that purpose could still be served by simply requiring businesses to disclose that information \nwhen asked or to keep it filed away somewhere accessible. There would certainly be no need to \ndictate  the  precise  language  required  for  the  notice,  the  precise  size  and  location  of  the \ndisclosure, or that the sign have a red-and-yellow, warning-sign color scheme, as if to say, โLook \nOut: Dangerous Gender Expressions Ahead.โ There is, in short, no plausible argument that this \n19 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 19 of 31 PageID #: 219\n\nlaw would come anywhere close to surviving strict scrutiny. If, therefore, the plaintiffs are able \nto demonstrate that strict scrutiny applies, they will also demonstrate a likelihood of success on \nthe merits. \nUnable to defend the Act under a strict scrutiny standard, the defendants argue that that \nstandard should not apply based on, essentially, a single premise: that the signs required by the \nAct are merely value-neutral, helpful statements of fact and that the plaintiffs are โ[s]trainingโ to \nsee  some  message  they  object  to  when  none  is  actually  there.  (Doc.  No.  21  at  12.)  The \ndefendants are right that, as the Supreme Court has held, strict scrutiny typically does not apply \nto  laws  compelling  commercial  actors  to  disclose  โpurely  factual  and  uncontroversial \ninformation about the terms under which [their] services will be available.โ Zauderer v. Off. of \nDisciplinary  Couns.  of Supreme  Ct.  of  Ohio,  471  U.S.  626,  651  (1985).  That  is  why,  for \nexample,  the  government  can  require  truthful  warning  labels  on  dangerous  products,  Disc. \nTobacco City & Lottery, Inc. v. United States, 674 F.3d 509, 527 (6th Cir. 2012), or require \nbusinesses to disclose their fee structures to prevent hidden costs, Zauderer, 471 U.S. at 653. The \nplaintiffs,  however,  protest  that  the  message  required  by  the  Act  is  neither  truthful  nor \nuncontroversial. In particular, the plaintiffs object to the compelled use of the contested term \nโBIOLOGICAL SEXโ and the suggestion that individuals using the bathroom that corresponds \nto their gender identity are doing so โREGARDLESS OF THE DESIGNATION ON THE \nRESTROOM,โ when, in fact, the plaintiffs believe that such an individual would, if anything, \nactually be complying with the designation of the restroom, not ignoring it. \nThe  Supreme  Court  has  expressly  recognized  that  โsexual  orientation  and  gender \nidentityโ  are,  generally  speaking,  โcontroversial  subjects.โ  Janus,  138  S.  Ct.  at  2476.  The \nplaintiffs have provided ample evidence that the signs mandated by the Act do, in fact, address \n20 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 20 of 31 PageID #: 220\n\nthe issue of gender identity by making certain assumptions about the nature of biological sex and \nthe standard social practices surrounding what it means to use a particular restroom โregardlessโ \nof its โdesignation.โ In order for the defendants to prevail on their argument that the mandated \nmessage is, nevertheless, merely factual and uncontroversial, then, they must offer some reason \nwhy, despite that evidence and despite the controversial nature of the subject matter implicated, \nthe mandated statement itself is simply an innocent factual disclaimer. To do so, the defendants \nhave primarily relied on adopting a tone of incredulity while pointing out that the language of the \nrequired message does not expressly include any overt statement about transgender individuals, \nintersex individuals, or gender identity. \nThere are at least two big, foundational problems with the defendantsโ argument. First is \nthat the governing caselaw is clear that courts, when considering First Amendment challenges, \nare permitted to exercise ordinary common sense to evaluate the content of a message in context \nto  consider  its  full  meaning,  rather  than  simply  robotically  reading  the  messageโs  text  for \nplausible deniability. For example, the Supreme Court has recognized that compelling a student \nto salute the flag, in context, sends a message about โnationalismโ and โnational unityโ that โis \nlikely to include what some disapprove or to omit what others think essential.โ W. Va. State Bd. \nof Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 634 (1943). There is nothing inherent in the act of a personโs \nholding his body in a particular pose toward a particular patterned cloth that conveys such a \nmessage in any objective sense. But we all have an idea of what saluting the flag means. That \nmeaning is rooted in a shared contextual understanding of the society and message at issue, and \nthe court, like an ordinary person, can consider that context.  \nBy way of further example, the Sixth Circuit has recognized, in the First Amendment \ncontext,  that  the  phrase  โChoose  Life,โ  at  least  when  presented  in  some  ways,  โis  highly \n21 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 21 of 31 PageID #: 221\n\ncontroversial,โ with โlarge numbers of participants in the public discourseโ holding โan opposing \nview.โ ACLU of Tenn. v. Bredesen, 441  F.3d 370, 379  (6th Cir. 2006). That  widely held \nopposing view, suffice it to say, is not that people should โchoose death.โ The Sixth Circuit \nrecognized that, despite the apparent positivity and harmlessness of the phrase โchoose life,โ that \nmessage was, in context and against the existing cultural backdrop, really a statement about \nabortion. Of course it was. And of course the signs required by the Act are statements about the \nnature of sex and gender and the role of transgender individuals in society.9 Justice is blind, but \nthe court does not have to play dumb.  \nThe second big, foundational problem with the defendantsโ argument is that, to state the \nobvious, the people on one side of a disagreement do not get to unilaterally declare their position \nto be uncontroversial, because that is not how the concept of โcontroversyโ works. Put another \nway, the defendants might be wise to accept that, once you are in a heated argument with \nmultiple folks about whether your position is uncontroversial, there is a good chance that you \nmay have already lost. โThe First Amendment mandates that [courts] presume that speakers, not \nthe government, know best both what they want to say and how to say it.โ Riley v. Natโl Fedโn of \nthe Blind of N. Carolina, Inc., 487 U.S. 781, 790โ91 (1988) (citing Tashjian v. Republican Party \nof Conn., 479 U.S. 208, 224 (1987)). As such, the best way to determine whether a topic is a \ncontroversial matter of public concern is simply to observe whether members of the public and \n \n9 The defendants appear to have scoured the world (or at least searched some databases) for examples in \nwhich speakers have used the phrase โbiological sexโ in plausibly inoffensive ways. (Doc. No. 21 at 13โ\n15.)  None  of  these  examples  involves  mandatory  restroom  warning  signs  or  the  suggestion  that \ntransgender individuals who use the restroom of their choice are doing so โREGARDLESS OF THE \nDESIGNATION ON THE RESTROOM.โ The defendantsโ argument, in this respect, highlights the \ndegree to which the case for the Actโs constitutionality hinges on a disregard of context unsupported by \nprecedent and contrary to any reasonable understanding of how human beings communicate. \n \n22 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 22 of 31 PageID #: 222\n\nother relevant actors โdisagree sharply aboutโ it. Janus, 138 S. Ct. at 2475. To ignore such \ndisagreement merely because it is constitutionally inconvenient โis to deny reality.โ Id.  \nSupporters of the Act may look at some of the plaintiffsโ contentionsโsuch as that there \nare not two objective โbiological sexesโ and that it is offensive to them to be forced to say \notherwiseโand  react  in  disbelief.  But  that  does  not  make  the  plaintiffsโ  earnestly  held \nviewpoints  go  away,  and,  when  the  court  performs  its  analysis  of  whether  a  message  is \ncontroversial, the key question is whether the alleged societal disagreement exists, not who is \nright. On the current record, the only way to argue that the message mandated by the Act is \nuncontroversial is to argue that the plaintiffs are simply lying about both the social realities they \nhave observed and their own disagreement with the required message.10 But the court sees no \nevidence whatsoever that the plaintiffs have failed to tell the truth about that or anything else. To \nthe contrary, the legislative history of the Act shows that it was devised, quite consciously and \nexplicitly, as a direct response to social and political trends involving transgender people. It is \nonly now, in the context of litigation, that officials of the State suggest otherwise.  \nThe record, moreover, confirms that the plaintiffs are not simply inventing a controversy. \nThe plaintiffsโ account is supported by the Declaration of Dr. Foster, whose relevant expertise \nthe defendants have not undermined in the slightest, as well as publications from credible \nsources echoing Dr. Fosterโs and the plaintiffsโ position. It is hard to see how the plaintiffs could \nbe โstraining,โ when there are so many others pulling in the same direction. The only way to \n \n10 It is particularly baffling that the defendants accuse the plaintiffs of having โunfounded opinions.โ \n(Doc. No. 21 at 12.) This court has no idea what an โunfounded opinionโ is in this context, but apparently \nthe defendants mean to suggest that the First Amendment protection against compelled speech only \nrecognizes the need to protect points of view that are โwidely accepted.โ (Id.) The version of the First \nAmendment envisioned by the defendantsโone reserved for โwidely acceptedโ opinionsโis certainly \nnew to this court. See Bonta, 2021 WL 2690268, at *6 (noting that it is โespecially importantโ for the \nFirst Amendment to โshield[] dissident[s] . . . from suppression by the majorityโ). In any event, however, \nthe plaintiffs have, in fact, introduced a good deal of evidence that their positions are not idiosyncratic to \nthem, and are, in fact, embraced by many individuals in Tennessee and elsewhere. \n23 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 23 of 31 PageID #: 223\n\nreach the defendantsโ position that, despite all this evidence, the message of the required signs is \nuncontroversial is to assume that positions contrary to the governmentโs simply do not existโor \nat least do not count. That kind of disregarding of one position to favor another is precisely what \nthe First Amendment, in cases such as this, exists to prevent. \nFinally, for the sake of efficiency, the court will also consider the possibility that the \ndefendants may be correct about the governing standard here and that the Act is subject only to \nrational basis review. โUnder rational basis review, a law is upheld so long as it is rationally \nrelated to a legitimate government purpose. There is a strong presumption of constitutionality \nand the regulation will be upheld so long as its goal is permissible and the means by which it is \ndesigned to achieve that goal are rational.โ Liberty Coins, LLC v. Goodman, 748 F.3d 682, 694 \n(6th Cir. 2014) (citing Natโl Assโn for Advancement of Psychoanalysis v. Cal. Bd. of Psych., 228 \nF.3d 1043, 1050 (9th Cir. 2000)). The Supreme Court has made clear, however, that, โeven in the \nordinary . . . case calling for the most deferential of standards,โ a law may be struck down if its \nsubstance is โso discontinuous with the reasons offered for itโ that any pretense of rationality \ncannot  be  sustained.  Romer  v.  Evans,  517  U.S.  620,  632  (1996).  That  review  includes \nconsidering whether, โin practical effect, the challenged [provision] simply does not operate so \nas rationally to furtherโ the legitimate purpose professed. U.S. Depโt of Agric. v. Moreno, 413 \nU.S. 528, 537 (1973). The court may also consider whether the challenged policy is โeither \ncounterproductive or irrationally overinclusive.โ Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. LaFleur, 414 U.S. \n632, 653 (1974) (Powell, J., concurring in the result).  \nAs the Supreme Court has recognized, applying rational basis review with at least some \nteeth is particularly appropriate when necessary to constrain the government from improperly \nsingling out and punishing a โpolitically unpopular groupโ that, though vulnerable, has never \n24 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 24 of 31 PageID #: 224\n\nbeen recognized by the Supreme Courtโs jurisprudence as a suspect class. Trump v. Hawaii, 138 \nS. Ct. 2392, 2420 (2018) (citing Moreno, 413 U.S. at 534). Rational basis review has, for \nexample,  been  used  to  invalidate  laws  unfairly  and  irrationally  targeting  the  intellectually \ndisabled, City of Cleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 448 (1985), people forced \nby poverty to live in group housing arrangements, Moreno, 413 U.S. at 537โ38, and, perhaps \nmost prominently in recent years, gays and lesbians, Romer, 517 U.S. at 635. The court sees little \nreason to doubt that a law affecting particularly transgender and intersex people would raise \nsimilar red flags, even under rational basis review. \nThe  defendants  argue  that  the  Act  is  rationally  related  to  Tennesseeโs  โinterest  in \nensuring that patrons are informed of the bathroom-use policy at businesses they frequentโ\nespecially  when  the  bathroom-usage  policy  differs  in  practice  from  the  existing  bathroom \nsignage used by business owners.โ (Doc. No. 21 at 17.) It may be true that rational basis review \nwould support some kind of law furthering the interest of transparency in private bathroom \npolicies. But the plaintiffsโ challenge is not to a hypothetical law, but to this law. The Act \ncontains provisions that do far more than further transparency and may, in fact, be deleterious to \nit. For example, mandating this precise formulation for the language of the sign, despite the fact \nthat the language itself is, if anything, unnecessarily confusing, has no rational basis. Similarly, \nthere  is  no  rational  basis  for  adopting  a  color  scheme  that  any  reasonable,  contemporary \nAmerican viewer will know to convey a sense of warning and alarm. Finally, there is certainly \nno rational, transparency-based reason to require disclosure signage by businesses that allow \nindividuals to use restrooms based on their gender identity, but not requiring disclosure by \nbusinesses that require individuals to use the restroom corresponding to their gender assigned at \nbirth  or  their  genitals.  A  rational,  content-neutral  signage  law  would  not  use  a  businessโs \n25 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 25 of 31 PageID #: 225\n\nviewpoint on this issue to determine whether transparency and disclosure should be required. \nAccordingly, while the court holds that strict scrutiny applies in this case, it also holds that the \nplaintiffs would have at least a meaningful likelihood of success under a lesser standard of First \nAmendment review. \nB. Remaining Preliminary Injunction Factors \n1. Irreparable Injury to the Plaintiffs. The caselaw of this circuit has long recognized \nthat a violation of a personโs constitutional rights is, in and of itself, an irreparable harm. Bonnell \nv. Lorenzo, 241 F.3d 800, 809 (6th Cir. 2001) (citing Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976)). \nIn addition to that general rule, the Supreme Court has recognized that โ[t]he loss of First \nAmendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable \ninjury.โ Elrod, 427 U.S. at 373โ74 (citing New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 \n(1971)). The courtโs conclusion that the Act very likely violates the plaintiffsโ First Amendment \nrights therefore mandates a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer an irreparable harm if the Act is \nnot enjoined from enforcement. \nThe irreparable harm posed by the Act, however, does not end with the abstract question \nof constitutionality. Restaurants and performing spaces are businesses, but that is not all they are; \nthey are also among the most important physical locations in which communitiesโso often \nconsigned, in this era, to electronic spaceโcan gather and grow together in a manner rooted in a \nparticular neighborhood, in a particular city, in a particular state. The plaintiffs have presented \nevidence that they have strived to be welcoming spaces for communities that include transgender \nindividuals and that the signage required by the Act would disrupt the welcoming environments \nthat they wish to provide. That harm would be real, and it is not a harm that could simply be \nremedied by some award at the end of litigation. \n26 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 26 of 31 PageID #: 226\n\nThe defendants may think that the plaintiffs should not mind displaying the required \nsigns, but that is not their call to make. For all the plenary power that state governments have in \nour constitutional system, they do not have the authority to tell the plaintiffs what to feel or to \ntell communities of private individuals what attitudes they should shun or embrace. Just as, for \nexample, the government cannot simply unilaterally reject the professions of earnest religious \nfaith raised by an individual bringing a challenge based on his religious liberty, see Burwell v. \nHobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 717 & n.28 (2014), so is the government bound to \naccept the plaintiffsโ accounts of what they do not want to say, why they do not want to say it, \nand how important that preference is to them and the people with whom they associate. Because \nthe plaintiffsโ evidence shows that the Act would be an invasion on private communitiesโ power \nto define themselves and their norms in accordance with their own consciences, the plaintiffs \nhave more than carried their burden of showing that irreparable harm would occur absent an \ninjunction.11 \n2.  Harm  to  the  Defendants/Public  Interest.  The  third  and  fourth  factors  of  the \npreliminary  injunction  analysisโharm  to  others  and  the  public  interestโโmerge  when  the \nGovernment is the opposing party.โ Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). The plaintiffs \npoint  out  that,  as  always,  โthe  public  interest  is  served  by  preventing  the  violation  of \nconstitutional rights.โ Chabad of S. Ohio & Congregation Lubavitch v. City of Cincinnati, 363 \n \n11 That harm, moreover, could not be avoided by issuing a narrowly crafted injunction applying, for \nexample, only to enforcement of the Act against the plaintiffs themselves. If every other comparable \nbusiness in the State of Tennessee that allows individuals to use the restroom of their choice is required to \ndisplay a warning sign, but these businesses are not, the natural impression given to customers will be that \nthese businesses require their patrons to use only the restroom that has been designated for them based on \ntheir sex assigned at birth. The only way to prevent the plaintiffsโ being harmed by the Act, therefore, is \nto prevent the State from imposing a regime of forced signage altogether. The court finds no meaningful \nrisk  of  significant  harm  from  such  an  injunction,  because  the  defendants  have  not  identified  any \nconstitutionally permissible action that would be enjoinedโand, of course, any business that wishes to \npost a sign about its restroom policies would remain free to do so. \n27 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 27 of 31 PageID #: 227\n\nF.3d 427, 436 (6th Cir. 2004). The defendants, however, appeal to another, frequently cited \nprinciple: that โ[a]ny time a State is enjoined by a court from effectuating statutes enacted by \nrepresentatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable injury.โ Maryland v. King, 133 S. Ct. \n1, 3 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers12) (quoting New Motor Vehicle Bd. of Cal. v. Orrin W. \nFox Co., 434 U.S. 1345, 1351 (1977) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers)). Those two rules seem, at \nleast superficially, to be in tension. That apparent tension, however, is based on two closely \nrelated misunderstandings: first, that unconstitutional laws are nevertheless duly โenactedโ as \nlong as they receive enough legislatorsโ votes (and, if required, the signature of a governor); and, \nsecond,  that,  when  the  State  of  Tennessee  is  constrained  by  the  U.S.  Constitution,  those \nconstraints have been foisted upon the state by some outside authority contrary to the stateโs \nsovereignty and its accountability to its people. But neither of those assumptions is true. No \nlegislature can enact a law it lacks the power to enact, and the constraints on Tennesseeโs power \nthat come along with the U.S. Constitution were voluntarily assumed by the State of Tennessee \nby virtue of its entry into the federal system. \nโWhen  a  State  enters  the  Union,  it  surrenders  certain  sovereign  prerogatives.โ \nMassachusetts v. E.P.A., 549 U.S. 497 (2007). The State of Tennessee was admitted to the Union \nby Act of Congress in 1791โafter the overwhelming victory of a referendum seeking statehood. \n4 Cong. Ch. 47, June 1, 1796, 1 Stat. 491; Stanley J. Folmsbee et al., History of Tennessee 209 \n(1960) (detailing referendum vote of โ6,504 in favor of statehood . . . and 2,562 againstโ; see \nalso U.S. Const. art. IV, ยง 3, cl. 1 (โNew States may be admitted by the Congress into this \n \n12 An โin chambersโ opinion is an opinion written and issued by a single judge of a multi-judge court, \npursuant to a court rule allowing a lone judge to address certain secondary matters without obtaining \nconcurrence from the full court or a panel thereof. The Supreme Court allows a single justice, serving in \nhis or her capacity as Circuit Justice, to deny requests for interim relief, such as stays, in chambers. See \nDaniel M. Gonen, Judging in Chambers: The Powers of A Single Justice of the Supreme Court, 76 U. \nCin. L. Rev. 1159, 1173 (2008). In Maryland v. King, Chief Justice Roberts, writing in chambers, denied \nan application for a stay of judgment. 133 S.Ct. at 3. \n28 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 28 of 31 PageID #: 228\n\nUnion . . . .โ). There was, at the time, no doubt that, by accepting statehood, Tennessee was also \naffirmatively  agreeing  to  abide  by  the  U.S.  Constitution.  Indeed,  Tennesseeโs  own  first \nConstitution, propounded the same year, asserted the territoryโs โright of admission into the \nGeneral Government as a member State thereof, consistent with the Constitution of the United \nStates and the act of Cession of the State of North Carolina.โ Tenn. Const. of 1796, prmbl. \n(emphasis added). The U.S. Constitution to which Tennessee assented specifically provided, as it \nstill provides, that it would be the โsupreme Law of the Land,โ the โLaws of any State to the \nContrary notwithstanding.โ U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. Several decades after Tennessee first \naccepted  that  limitation,  moreover,  the  stateโs  political  leadership  reaffirmed  the  stateโs \nconstitutional obligations by ratifying the Fourteenth Amendment and obtaining recognition, \nfrom Congress, of Tennesseeโs renewed commitment to the Union. 39 Res. No. 73, July 24, \n1866, 14 Stat. 364.  \nWhen this court is faced with a seemingly unconstitutional Tennessee policy, then, the \nissue is not merely whether state or federal prerogatives should prevail; it is whether Tennesseeโs \ncurrent  government  should  be  allowed  to  contravene  the  valid  and  binding  foundational \ndecisions of previous generations of state leadersโindeed, the very leaders who made the \nexistence and continuation of a state called โTennesseeโ possible. The choices of those earlier \nTennessee leaders are no less worthy of constitutional solicitude than the choices Tennesseeโs \nGeneral Assembly makes today. In this respect, enforcing the United States Constitution against \na state government is a vindication, not  a derogation, of the enduring importance of state \nautonomy. Because the court finds a high likelihood of success with regard to the plaintiffsโ \nconstitutional challenges, it finds a low likelihood that the injunctive relief would intrude on any \n29 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 22   Filed 07/09/21   Page 29 of 31 PageID #: 229\n\npowers legitimately retained by the State of Tennessee. Ultimately, then, these factors weigh \nstrongly in favor of granting the injunction. \n3. Balancing of Factors. As the court has held, each of the factors guiding the decision \nto grant a preliminary injunction favors granting such an injunction here. The plaintiffs are likely \nto succeed on the merits; if they are not granted a preliminary injunction now, they will be \nharmed in a way that cannot be repaired; and requiring the State of Tennessee to abide by the \nU.S. Constitution, sooner rather than later, vindicates the public interest in rule by law and the \nacceptance, by States, of constitutional government. The court, therefore, has little difficulty \nconcluding that the preliminary injunction should issue. \nSome messages do not have to be compelled to be repeated; they surface, time and again, \nby dint of their persuasiveness and their importance. More than a dozen times, the Supreme \nCourt,  or  a  Justice  of  that  Court  writing  separately,  has  repeated  the  classic  declaration, \noriginally set forth by the Court in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, that, โ[i]f \nthere is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can \nprescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or \nforce citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.โ 319 U.S. at 642.13 That rule is not \nfounded simply on an abstract love of unfettered and uncompelled speech. The First Amendment \nholds  its  privileged  place  in  our  constitutional  system  because,  โ[w]henever  the  Federal \nGovernment or a State prevents individuals from saying what they think on important matters or \n \n13 See Janus, 138 S.

Because that principle retains its vitality today, and because the law at issue \nin this case is a brazen violation of it, the court will grant the plaintiffsโ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction. \nV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the plaintiffsโ Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Doc. No. 7) \nwill be granted. \nAn appropriate order will enter. \n \n              ______________________________ \n                ALETA A.

INTRODUCTION \n1.  Plaintiffs are Tennessee businesses and service providers and their owners. They \nserve the public, and provide public access to their restrooms. Plaintiffs welcome transgender \ncustomers, clients, and staff, and allow transgender people to use the restrooms or facilities that \naccord with their gender identity.  \n2.  Under newly enacted H.B. 1182/S.B.1224, 112th Gen. Assemb., 1st Reg. Sess. \n(Tenn. 2021) (โthe Actโ) (attached as Exhibit A and to be codified at Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 68-120-\n1 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 1   Filed 06/25/21   Page 1 of 19 PageID #: 1\n\n     \n \n101, et seq.), Plaintiffsโand any other business or public entity in Tennessee that allows \ntransgender people to use the appropriate public restroomโwill be required to post a \ncontroversial and misleading warning notice advising that โTHIS FACILITY MAINTAINS A \nPOLICY OF ALLOWING THE USE OF RESTROOMS BY EITHER BIOLOGICAL SEX, \nREGARDLESS OF THE DESIGNATION ON THE RESTROOM.โ  See Exh. B. \n3.  Plaintiffs do not want to display this notice. They do not agree with this \ncharacterization of their policies, and they do not want to convey the Tennessee General \nAssemblyโs controversial and stigmatizing message to customers, clients, and staff.  \n4.  If H.B. 1182 is allowed to go into effect, Plaintiffs and all other similarly situated \nbusinesses and entities open to the public in Tennessee will be forced to either display this \ngovernment-mandated warning notice, or risk being charged with a Class B misdemeanor for \nviolating the Tennessee building code, with a maximum penalty of six months in prison or $500. \n5.  By forcing Plaintiffs to display a government-mandated warning notice with \nwhich they disagree, the Act violates the Plaintiffsโ First Amendment right against compelled \nspeech. \n6.  Plaintiffs bring this action to challenge the constitutionality of the Act. Unless \nenjoined by this Court, the Act will take effect on July 1, 2021, irreparably harming Plaintiffs \nand their customers, clients, and staff, and violating Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights. \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  Jurisdiction is conferred on this Court by 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343.  \n8.  Plaintiffsโ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. \nยงยง 2201 and 2202, Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the general legal \nand equitable powers of this Court.  \n2 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 1   Filed 06/25/21   Page 2 of 19 PageID #: 2\n\n     \n \n9.  Venue is appropriate under 28 U.S.C ยง 1391(b) because one or more of the \nDefendants resides in this judicial district and because a substantial part of the events or \nomissions giving rise to Plaintiffsโ claims occurred in this judicial district. \nIII.  PARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs \n10.  Plaintiff Bongo Productions, LLC (โBongoโ) owns several restaurants, coffee \nshops and a coffee roasting company all located in Nashville, Tennessee. See Bongo Roasting \nCo., available at https://bongojava.com/ (last visited Jun. 24, 2021). \n11.  Plaintiff Robert M. Bernstein is Bongoโs founder and chief manager.   \n12.  Mr. Bernstein is responsible for decisions regarding compliance with state and \nlocal building codes for Bongoโs establishments. \n13.  Mr. Bernstein opened Fido in 1996. Fido is a restaurant located in the Hillsboro \nVillage neighborhood of Nashville.  \n14.  Fido has 25 employees currently on staff and has employed hundreds of people \nover the years.  \n15.  In the past, Bongo has employed transgender people. Bongoโs and Fidoโs patrons \ninclude members of the transgender community.  \n16.  Bongo and Mr. Bernstein have worked over the years to create a welcoming \nenvironment in their business for the LGBTQ community. In reaction to the rash of anti-\ntransgender laws that passed this year and to show their support for transgender people, Fidoโs \nstaff decorated one of their drink menu signs with transgender and LGBTQ pride flag colors.   \n3 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 1   Filed 06/25/21   Page 3 of 19 PageID #: 3\n\n     \n \n17.  Fido has three restrooms. One is a single-user unisex restroom, which is not \nsubject to the Act. The other two restrooms have multiple stalls and/or urinals and bear sex \ndesignations.  \n18.  Prior to the passage of the Act, Fidoโs management and Mr. Bernstein had never \nthought about a formal policy as to who could use which restroom. Their informal policy was to \nallow people to use the sex-designated restroom that best matches their gender identity. Mr. \nBernstein has never received any complaints or concerns about their restroom policy. \n19.  Plaintiff Sanctuary Performing Arts LLC (โSanctuaryโ) is a performing arts \nvenue, community center and safe haven located in Chattanooga, Tennessee. See Sanctuary \nPerforming Arts, available at www.Sanctuaryperformingarts.com (last visited Jun. 24, 2021). \nSanctuary was founded by members of the transgender community in December 2020 to serve \nthe needs of transgender and intersex people of all ages, as well as other LGBTQ people and \nallies.  \n20.  Plaintiff Kye Sayers is Sanctuaryโs owner and one of its co-founders. She is a \nTennessee native. \n21.  Ms. Sayers makes decisions for Sanctuary regarding compliance with state and \nlocal building codes. \n22.  Sanctuary has two employees on staff, as well as many volunteers. The majority \nof the people who work and volunteer there and those who participate in Sanctuaryโs programs \nare transgender. Since Sanctuary opened its doors in late 2020, approximately 400 people have \nbeen involved with Sanctuary as volunteers or participants. \n23.  Sanctuary has three restrooms. One is a single-user unisex restroom, which is not \nsubject to the Act. The other two restrooms have multiple stalls or urinals and do not have a sex \n4 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 1   Filed 06/25/21   Page 4 of 19 PageID #: 4\n\n     \n \ndesignation at this time. Next month, Sanctuary intends to begin operating a full-service cafรฉ and \nwill be required by the local building code to post a sex designation on its two multi-user \nrestrooms. Sanctuary will continue to allow transgender people to use the restroom that best \naccords with their gender identity. \n24.  Sanctuary has never received any complaints about their restroom policies. \n25.  Ms. Sayers and Sanctuary have worked hard to create a safe space for transgender \nand intersex people and their families in a state that is frequently perceived as unwelcoming to \nLGBTQ people.   \nB.  Defendants \n26.  Defendant Carter Lawrence is the Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of \nCommerce and Insurance, and in that capacity, is also the Tennessee Fire Marshal. He has \nconcurrent responsibility for enforcement of the state building code. See Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 68-\n120-106. Mr. Lawrence is sued in his official capacity.   \n27.  Defendant Christopher Bainbridge is the Director of the Codes Enforcement \nSection of the Tennessee State Fire Marshalโs Office. The Codes Enforcement Section has \nenforcement authority over statewide building codes and standards, including the Act. See Tenn. \nComp. R. & Regs. 0780-02-16.01. Mr. Bainbridge is sued in his official capacity. \n28.  Defendant Glenn R. Funk is the District Attorney General for the 20th Judicial \nDistrict which covers Metropolitan Davidson County and Nashville, Tennessee. He is \nresponsible for prosecuting all violations of the state criminal statutes occurring in the judicial \ndistrict. Violations of the Act are Class B misdemeanors, see Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 68-120-108, \nand are punishable by up to six monthsโ imprisonment and a fine not to exceed $500, see Tenn. \nCode Ann. ยง 40-35-111(e)(2). General Funk is sued in his official capacity. \n5 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 1   Filed 06/25/21   Page 5 of 19 PageID #: 5\n\n     \n \n29.  Defendant Neal Pinkston is the District Attorney General for 11th Judicial District \nwhich covers Hamilton County and Chattanooga, Tennessee. He is responsible for prosecuting \nall violations of the state criminal statutes occurring in the judicial district. Violations of the Act \nare Class B misdemeanors, see Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 68-120-108 and are punishable by up to six \nmonthsโ imprisonment and fine not to exceed $500, see Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 40-35-111(e)(2). \nGeneral Pinkston is sued in his official capacity.  \nIV.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Legislative History of H.B. 1182 \n30.  As enacted, H.B. 1182 requires โ[a] public or private entity or business that \noperates a building or facility open to the general public and that, as a matter of formal or \ninformal policy, allows a member of either biological sex to use any public restroom within the \nbuilding or facilityโ to post a government-prescribed sign at the entrance of each sex-designated \npublic restroom in the building or facility with a red and yellow โNOTICEโ text at the top, and \nboldface black block letters on white background stating that โTHIS FACILITY MAINTAINS A \nPOLICY OF ALLOWING THE USE OF RESTROOMS BY EITHER BIOLOGICAL SEX, \nREGARDLESS OF THE DESIGNATION ON THE RESTROOM.โ See Exh. B. \n31.  The Act defines covered entities to โincludeโ those with facilities that are \ndesignated for โa specific biological sex,โ and to โexcludeโ โa unisex, single-occupant restroom \nor family restroom intended for use by either biological sex.โ   \n32.  The Act does not define โbiological sex.โ  \n6 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 1   Filed 06/25/21   Page 6 of 19 PageID #: 6\n\n     \n \n33.  The legislative history shows that the Act is intended to apply to entities that \nallow transgender people1 to use a restroom facility that accords with their gender identity, rather \nthan the sex they were assigned at birth. \n34.  During the legislative debates on H.B. 1182, the sole justification offered by its \nsponsor, Representative Tim Rudd, was that the bill was necessary to โprotect[] women and \nchildren againstโ people who could โtak[e] advantage of policies, executive orders, or \nlegislation[] that [] allow the โopposite biological sexโ to enter a [multi-occupancy] restroom, \nshower, or locker room.โ2 He explained, with โnew [laws] . . . giving transgenders [sic] [more] \nrights . . . I donโt want women . . . or children calling me next year [about] how they have been \nraped or molested [while using the bathroom facility].โ3  \n35.  During a subsequent committee meeting, Representative Rudd stated that โa \nwoman has the right to know whether a man is going to be in her bathroom and vice versa for a \nman.โ4 This too was a reference to transgender people using the restrooms that accord with their \ngender identity. \n36.  When questioned by other representatives about the need for this bill, \nRepresentative Rudd responded that the bill was suggested by a constituent at a fundraiser, and \n \n1 Transgender people are people whose gender identityโtheir deeply held internal understanding \nof who they areโdiffers from the sex they were assigned at birth. See Wylie C. Hembree, et al., \nEndocrine Treatment of Gender-Dysphoric/Gender Incongruent Persons: An Endocrine Society \nClinical Practice Guideline, 102 J. of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism 3869 (Sept. 13, \n2017), available at https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2017-01658. \n2 Debate of H.B. 1182 Before the H. Pub. Serv. Comm. at 19:50, 112th Gen. Assemb. (Mar. 10, \n2021), available at https://tnga.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=610&clip_id=24150. \n3 Id. at 31:49 \n4 Debate of H.B. 1182 Before the H. State Govโt Comm. at 1:04:40, 112th Assemb. (Mar. 23, \n2021), available at http://tnga.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.phpview_id=610&clip_id=24337 \n&meta_id=575940.  \n7 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 1   Filed 06/25/21   Page 7 of 19 PageID #: 7\n\n     \n \nhe felt that the bill was needed because of the executive orders regarding rights for transgender \npeople โcoming out of Washington.โ5  \n37.  There was no testimony offered in support of the bill. The committee nonetheless \nvoted to move the bill forward.6  \n38.  During House floor debates on March 29, Representative Mike Stewart asked \nabout the public policy underlying H.B. 1182. Representative Rudd once more responded that \nwith the new executive orders and policies from Washington, it would be โgood to put on \nnotice.โ7 He also stated that it is โshocking and a danger to people that enter a bathroom marked \nโmenโ or โwomenโ and someone of the opposite sex is standing there, which could scare people \nand provoke violence.โ8  \n39.  The bill passed the House and moved to the Senate, where it passed on April 29, \n2021.  \n40.  Governor Bill Lee signed H.B. 1182 into law on May 17, 2021. \n41.  H.B. 1182 will go into effect on July 1, 2021. \nB.  Application of H.B. 1182 to Plaintiffs \n42.  While transgender people long have been part of our communitiesโattending \nschools, working, and using public restrooms without incidentโrights for transgender people are \nnonetheless a subject of hotly contested debate in this state, and across the country. This is \nespecially true around the right to access restrooms that match peopleโs gender identity. In just \n \n5 Id. at 1:14:40. \n6 Id. at 1:24:00. \n7 Discussion of H.B. 1182 Before H. Floor Sess., 18th Legis. Day at 1:49:40, 112th Gen. \nAssemb. (Mar. 29, 2021), available at http://tnga.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=610& \nclip_id=24423&meta_id=579987.  \n8 Id. \n8 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 1   Filed 06/25/21   Page 8 of 19 PageID #: 8\n\n     \n \n2021, the Tennessee General Assembly has passed, and Governor Lee has signed into law, five \nbills targeting transgender people in Tennessee. Over a hundred anti-transgender bills were \nintroduced nationwide in 2021 alone. See Am. Civil Liberties Union, Legislation Affecting LGBT \nRights Across the Country, https://www.aclu.org/legislation-affecting-lgbt-rights-across-country \n(last updated May 28, 2021).  \n43.  Transgender people are frequent targets of harassment and face widespread \ndiscrimination in all facets of life. Being forced to use restrooms that do not align with their \ngender puts transgender people at greater risk of harassment or violence, and also causes \npsychological and physical harm.9  \n44.  Policies that allow transgender people to use the correct sex-designated \nrestroomโthe restroom that best matches their identityโdo not legalize harassment, stalking, \nviolence, or sexual assault. Nor do these policies change the sex-segregated nature of these \nfacilities. In other words, allowing transgender people to use restrooms and other facilities that \nalign with their gender identity simply ensures that everyone has access to spaces that match who \nthey are. These policies do not permit unfettered access for anyone, regardless of sex, to spaces \nrestricted to one sex. \n \n9 See Timothy Wang, et al., State Anti-Transgender Bathroom Bills Threaten Transgender \nPeopleโs Health and Participation in Public Life, The Fenway Inst. (2016), \nhttps://fenwayhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/COM-2485-Transgender-Bathroom-Bill-\nBrief_v8-pages.pdf. \n9 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 1   Filed 06/25/21   Page 9 of 19 PageID #: 9\n\n     \n \n45.  Law enforcement officials10 and sexual assault advocates11 in states and cities \nwith policies that prohibit discrimination based on transgender status, including with respect to \nuse of single-sex facilities, have rejected the contention that these policies cause safety problems. \n46.  Plaintiffs recognize that people who are transgender may need to use the restroom \nwhile out in public, just like everyone else. Plaintiff Bongo has sex-designated restrooms and has \ninformal policies allowing transgender people to use the restrooms that align with their gender \nidentity. Plaintiff Sanctuary does not have sex-designated restrooms at this time, but will shortly, \nand intends to allow transgender people to use the restrooms that align with the sex they know \nthemselves to be. \n47.  All Plaintiffs recognize that requiring transgender people to use restrooms \nassociated with the sex they were assigned at birth would mean that their transgender customers, \nclients, and staff could not use the restroom without significant risk to their safety and dignity.  \n48.  In order to avoid being subject to the Actโs compelled speech requirements, \nPlaintiffs would need to change their policies to bar transgender people from using the restrooms \nthat accord with their gender identity. They do not wish to do so.  \n49.  Plaintiffs do not want to police whether transgender people are using their \nrestrooms or attempt to verify their customersโ, clientsโ, or employeesโ โbiological sex.โ \n \n10 Lou Chibbaro Jr., Predictions of Trans Bathroom Harassment Unfounded, Washington Blade \n(Mar. 31, 2016), https://www.washingtonblade.com/2016/03/31/predictions-of-trans-bathroom-\nharassment-unfounded/. \n11 Press Release, Natโl Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women, \nNational Consensus Statement of Anti-Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence Organizations in \nSupport of Full and Equal Access for the Transgender Community (Apr. 21, 2016), \nhttps://endsexualviolence.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/STATEMENT-OF-ANTI-SEXUAL-\nASSAULT-AND-DOMESTIC-VIOLENCE-ORGANIZATIONS-IN-SUPPORT-OF-EQUAL-\nACCESS-FOR-THE-TRANSGENDER-COMMUNITY.pdf. \n10 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 1   Filed 06/25/21   Page 10 of 19 PageID #: 10\n\n     \n \n50.  It is impossible to ascertain whether or not someone is transgender by looking at \nthem. Many transgender people have a physical appearance that is typical of the sex that matches \ntheir gender identity, not the sex they were assigned at birth. And many people who are not \ntransgender may dress or appear in ways that are not stereotypically associated with their sex \nassigned at birth. \n51.  Plaintiffs do not have anyone guarding their restroom doors to ask for their birth \ncertificates, inspect anyoneโs genitals, or interrogate any other aspect of their sex. They do not \neven know how they would attempt to do so without gross intrusions into the privacy of their \nemployees, customers, and clients. Yet unless they do so, Plaintiffs and indeed all other \nbusinesses or other entities with restroom facilities open to the public throughout Tennessee will \nbe required to display the specific sign required by the Act. \n52.  Fido has sex-designated multi-user restrooms. Mr. Bernstein is concerned that the \nActโs required warning notice will create confusion for his customers, clients, and employees.   \n53.  Based on the legislative history of the Act, Plaintiffs Bongo and Mr. Bernstein are \nreasonably concerned that the Act applies to them, because they allow all women, including \ntransgender women, to use the womenโs restroom, and all men, including transgender men, to \nuse the menโs restroom.   \n54.  Plaintiff Sanctuary has two multi-user restrooms that are not presently sex-\ndesignated. Anyone is welcome to use any of Sanctuaryโs restrooms. Sanctuary intends to begin \noperating a cafรฉ next month, and will then display a sex designation on its two multi-user \nrestrooms because such a designation will be required by municipal building codes. Sanctuary \nand Ms. Sayers are reasonably concerned that the Act applies to Sanctuary now because its all-\ngender multi-user facilities are not โexcludedโ under the Actโs definition of covered entities. \n11 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 1   Filed 06/25/21   Page 11 of 19 PageID #: 11\n\n     \n \nThey are also concerned that the Act will apply to Sanctuary in the future once it adds a sex \ndesignation on its multi-user restrooms. At that time, Sanctuary will allow all women, including \ntransgender women, to use the womenโs restroom, and all men, including transgender men, to \nuse the menโs restroom.   \nC.  HB 1182 requires Plaintiffs to communicate a controversial and ideological \nviewpoint. \n \n55.  The phrase โbiological sexโ is a relatively recent one with no fixed definition.  \nSee, e.g., Katrina Kazarkis, The Misuses of โBiological Sex,โ 394 The Lancet 1898 (Nov. 23, \n2019), available at https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(19)32764-3.  \n56.  The Endocrine Societyโs guideline explains that the terms โ[b]iological sex, \nbiological male or femaleโ โrefer to physical aspects of maleness and femaleness. As these may \nnot be in line with each other (e.g., a person with XY chromosomes may have female-appearing \ngenitalia), the terms biological sex and biological male or female are imprecise and should be \navoided.โ12  \n57.  In fact, a personโs sex encompasses a number of different biological attributes, \nincluding sex chromosomes, certain genes, gonads, sex hormone levels, internal and external \ngenitalia, other secondary sex characteristics, and gender identity.13 \n58.  These components of sex do not all align neatly in every human being. Where \nthey do not, best practice medical care recognizes that for purposes of social and legal \nrecognition, a personโs gender identity should be the basis for their sex classification. See World \nPro. Assโn for Transgender Health, Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, \n \n12 Hembree, et al., supra note 1, at 3875 Table 1. \n13 See id.; see also Joshua D. Safer & Vin Tangpricha, Care of Transgender Persons, 381 New \nEng. J. Med. 2451, available at https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMcp1903650.   \n12 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 1   Filed 06/25/21   Page 12 of 19 PageID #: 12\n\n     \n \nTransgender, and Gender Nonconforming People (2012), available at \nhttps://www.wpath.org/publications/soc. Although the detailed mechanisms are not fully \nunderstood, there is a medical consensus that there is a significant biologic component \nunderlying gender identity.14   \n59.  The Act also ignores entirely the existence of intersex people, by suggesting that \nthere are only two possible sexes with the use of the mandated phrase โeither biological sex.โ  \n60.  โIntersexโ is an umbrella term for unique variations in reproductive or sex \nanatomy. Variations may appear in a personโs chromosomes, genitals, or internal organs like \ntestes or ovaries. Some intersex traits are identified at birth, while others may not be discovered \nuntil puberty or later in life. There are over thirty medical terms for specific combinations of \nintersex traits. See InterAct, Intersex Definitions (last updated Feb. 19, 2021), available at \nhttps://interactadvocates.org/intersex-definitions/.   \n61.  Despite this guidance from medical professionals, the phrase โbiological sexโ is \nfrequently used by those seeking to limit rights for transgender people in order to not recognize \ntheir gender identity. \n62.  Prior to this year, there was no mention of โbiological sexโ in Tennessee law.  \nWhen Tennessee law referenced restrooms, it used the terms โmenโ and โwomen,โ โmaleโ or \nโfemale,โ or simply โsex.โ  See, e.g., Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 68-120-503 (requiring equitable \nrestrooms in public spaces); Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 4-24-303 (addressing restrooms and other sex \nsegregated spaces in fire houses). \n \n14 See Safer & Tangpricha, supra note 13; Joshua D.

Since 2013, state legislatures across the country have introduced bills to restrict \ntransgender peopleโs ability to access single-sex spaces such as restrooms. Many of these \nexclusions use the phrase โbiological sex.โ For example, North Carolinaโs House Bill 2 (the \nโPublic Facilities Privacy & Security Actโ), restricted access to multiple occupancy restrooms \nbased on โbiological sexโ, which the bill defined as โ[t]he physical condition of being male or \nfemale, which is stated on a person's birth certificate.โ H.B. 2, ยง 1.2, 2015 Gen. Assemb., 2nd \nExtra Sess. (N.C. 2016).  \n64.  Some statutes that use the term โbiological sex,โ like the Act, do not define it. \nSee, e.g., 2020 Or. Laws 1st Spec. Sess. Ch. 19, ยง 7a(3)(b)(L). Others use different and \nsometimes conflicting definitions. See, e.g., W. Va. Code Ann. ยง 18-2-25d (West 2021) (defining \nโbiological sexโ as โan individualโs physical form as male or female based solely on the \nindividualโs reproductive biology and genetics at birthโ); Idaho Code Ann. ยง 33-6203 (West \n2020) (providing that โbiological sexโ may be โverifiedโ relying on โreproductive anatomy, \ngenetic makeup, or normal endogenously produce testosterone levels,โ or a combination of those \nfactors); Miss. Code Ann. ยง 11-62-3 (2016) (stating โbiological sexโ is โimmutableโ and \nโobjectively determined by anatomy and genetics at time of birthโ); see also S.B. 1367/H.B. \n1233, 112th Gen. Assemb., 1st Reg. Sess. (Tenn. 2021) (providing that โโsexโ means a personโs \nimmutable biological sex as determined by anatomy and genetics at the time of birth,โ and that \nโ[e]vidence of a personโs biological sex includes, but is not limited to, a government issued \ndocument that accurately reflects a personโs sex listed on the personโs original birth certificateโ). \n65.  Since 2016, the Tennessee General Assembly has introduced multiple bills that \nwould restrict transgender peopleโs access to the restroom that accords with their gender identity \nin schools or other public spaces.  See, e.g., H.B. 2414/S.B. 2387, 109th Gen. Assemb., 2nd Reg. \n14 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 1   Filed 06/25/21   Page 14 of 19 PageID #: 14\n\n     \n \nSess. (Tenn. 2015) (requiring public schools to restrict access to restrooms based on sex assigned \non original birth certificates) (did not pass); H.B. 888/S.B. 771, 110th Gen. Assemb., 1st Reg. \nSess. (Tenn. 2017) (requiring public schools and higher education institutions to have each \nstudent use the restroom and locker room facilities consistent with the studentโs sex indicated on \ntheir original birth certificate) (did not pass); H.B. 2620/S.B. 2480, 110th Gen. Assemb., Reg. \nSess. (Tenn. 2018) (requiring the attorney general to defend or pay legal expenses for any school \ndistrict that restricts access to multiuser restrooms on the basis of โbiological sexโ) (did not \npass); S.B. 1297/H.B. 1151, 111th Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (Tenn. 2019) (expanding offense of \nindecent exposure to apply to restrooms or locker rooms) (passed with amendments); H.B. \n1274/S.B. 1499, 111th Gen. Assemb., 1st Reg. Sess. (Tenn. 2019) (similar to H.B. 2620); S.B. \n1367/H.B. 1233, 112th Gen. Assemb., 1st Reg. Sess. (Tenn. 2021) (creating a private right of \naction for a student, teacher, or school employee who encounters โa member of the opposite sex \nin a multi-occupancy restroom or changing facilityโ). These bills, and similar bills nationwide, \nhave been hotly contested and the subject of intense legislative and social debate.15  \n66.  In 2018, federal efforts to rescind regulatory protections for transgender people \nwere also framed in terms of exclusions based on โbiological sex.โ See, e.g., Erica Green, Katie \nBenner, & Robert Pear, โTransgenderโ Could Be Defined Out of Existence Under Trump, N.Y. \nTimes (Oct. 21, 2018), https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/us/politics/transgender-trump-\nadministration-sex-definition.html (citing leaked memo from Trump administration Department \nof Health and Human Services proposing to define โgender as a biological, immutable condition \ndetermined by genitalia at birthโ). This draft policy prompted protests, rallies and extensive \n \n15 See, e.g., Jonathan Mattise, Kimberlee Kruesi, & Lindsay Whitehurst, Tennessee Moves to the \nForefront with Anti-Transgender Laws, Associated Press (May 23, 2021), https://apnews.com/ \narticle/tennessee-transgender-laws-b8d81d56287d6ed9d56c5da2203596b0. \n15 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 1   Filed 06/25/21   Page 15 of 19 PageID #: 15\n\n     \n \npublic debate. See, e.g., Sarah Mervosh & Christine Hauser, At Rallies and Online, Transgender \nPeople Say They #Wonโt Be Erased, N.Y. Times (Oct. 22, 2018), available at \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/22/us/transgender-reaction-rally.html; Open Letter from Over \n2600 Scientists Opposing Proposed Legal Definition of Gender (Oct. 26, 2018), available at \nhttps://not-binary.org/statement/ (โThe proposal is in no way โgrounded in scienceโ as the \nadministration claims. The relationship between sex chromosomes, genitalia, and gender identity \nis complex, and not fully understood. There are no genetic tests that can unambiguously \ndetermine gender, or even sex. Furthermore, even if such tests existed, it would be \nunconscionable to use the pretext of science to enact policies that overrule the lived experience \nof peopleโs own gender identities.โ). \n67.  This politicized usage of the phrase โbiological sex,โ as contrasted with a \ntransgender personโs gender identity, is at odds with the medical consensus that gender identity \nitself has a biological basis. See, e.g., Editorial, Anatomy Does Not Define Gender, 365 Nature 5 \n(Oct. 30, 2018), available at https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07238-8.   \n68.  As used in the Act, the term โbiological sexโ carries an anti-transgender \nconnotation that reflects the General Assemblyโs viewpoint regarding sex and gender. \n69.  The Act also implies that allowing transgender people to use the restroom is \nsufficiently alarming to require a sign bearing a large red and yellow โNOTICEโ warning.   \n70.  The Act further requires Plaintiffs to appear to endorse the General Assemblyโs \nviewpoint about โbiological sexโ by characterizing their own policy in the General Assemblyโs \ncontroversial language (โTHIS FACILITY MAINTAINS A POLICY . . .โ).  \n71.  Plaintiffs do not want to communicate these messages on the walls of their \nbusinesses.  \n16 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 1   Filed 06/25/21   Page 16 of 19 PageID #: 16\n\n     \n \n72.  The speech compelled by the Act also requires Plaintiffs with sex-designated \nrestrooms to misrepresent their restroom policies by suggesting that they do not have sex-\ndesignated restrooms. \n73.  Plaintiffs understand that the Actโs mandated phrase โeither biological sexโ in the \npolitical context of H.B. 1182 is offensive to transgender and intersex people because it asserts \nthat transgender people are not the sex they know themselves to be and ignores the existence of \nintersex people. \n74.  Bongo and Mr. Bernstein believe that posting the warning notice required by H.B. \n1182 will offend their staff, customers, friends, and family. Mr. Bernstein worries he would lose \nstaff and customers if he is forced to post this sign. \n75.  Mr. Bernstein is uncomfortable with the government telling him to post a sign that \nhe believes is ideologically motivated and inaccurate. He believes that the warning notice \nmandated by the Act is offensive and inaccurate because it uses the loaded phrase โbiological \nsexโ in a way that does not align with current scientific understandings of sex and gender.  \n76.  Sanctuary and Ms. Sayers believe that posting the warning notice required by \nH.B. 1182 would send a message to transgender and intersex people that they are not welcomeโ\nwhich would undermine Sanctuaryโs mission and is the exact opposite of the message Sanctuary \ntries to cultivate in everything it does.   \n77.  Sanctuary and Ms. Sayers believe that Sanctuary will lose community members \nand supporters they have worked hard to bring to Sanctuary since its doors opened last \nDecember if Sanctuary displays the warning notice. \n78.  Sanctuary and Ms. Sayers object to the General Assemblyโs use of the term \nโbiological sexโ as communicated by the Act and do not want to be forced to use that phrase. \n17 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 1   Filed 06/25/21   Page 17 of 19 PageID #: 17\n\n     \n \nV.  IRREPARABLE HARM AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n79.  Under the Act, โ[i]f an entity or business is notified that it is not in compliance \nwith this section, the entity or business has thirty (30) days in which to comply before any action \nis taken against the entity or business.โ  \n80.  If Plaintiffs do not erect the Actโs required warning notice after notification that \nthey are not in compliance, they face up to six months imprisonment and/or a fine of up to $500, \nas well as other enforcement actions or civil penalties under Title 68, Chapter 120. \n81.  Plaintiffs do not want to display the government-mandated warning notice \nrequired by the Act. They also do not want to risk criminal penalties for exercising their right to \navoid unwanted speech. \n82.  Enforcement of the Act will chill Plaintiffsโ speech, subjecting them to irreparable \nharm. \n83.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT 1 \n(First AmendmentโCompelled Speech) \n84.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in \nparagraphs 1 through 83.  \n85.  The Act violates Plaintiffsโ rights under the First Amendment to the United States \nConstitution by compelling them, on pain of criminal penalty, to communicate a misleading and \ncontroversial government-mandated message that they would not otherwise display. \n86.  The Act is not rationally related to any legitimate government interest, let alone \nnarrowly tailored to advance a compelling government interest. \n18 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 1   Filed 06/25/21   Page 18 of 19 PageID #: 18\n\n     \n \n \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \nA.

Funk, and \nDAG Neal Pinkston have filed a Response (Doc. No. 39), and the plaintiffs have filed a Reply \n(Doc. No. 41). For the reasons set out herein, the plaintiffsโ motion will be granted. \nI. INTRODUCTION \nโWhen the government wishes to state an opinion [or] to speak for the community, . . . it \nnaturally chooses what to say and what not to say.โ Shurtleff v. City of Bos., Mass., No. 20-1800, \n2022 WL 1295700, at *4 (U.S. May 2, 2022) (citing Walker v. Texas Div., Sons of Confederate \nVeterans, Inc., 576 U.S. 200, 206โ07 (2015). That broad discretion, however, comes with a \ncaveat:  if  the  government  wishes  to  speak  freely,  it  must  speak  in  its  own  voice.  If  the \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 1 of 40 PageID #: 1131\n\ngovernment  instead  uses  its  police  powers  to  โcompel  private  persons  to  convey  the \ngovernmentโsโ message, then the First Amendmentโs Free Speech Clause comes into play and \nโmay constrainโ the exercise of that power. Walker v. Texas Div., Sons of Confederate Veterans, \nInc., 576 U.S. 200, 208 (2015). \nThat does not mean that compelled speech is always unconstitutional. Rather, courts have \nclosely looked at the various situations in which compelled speech issues ariseโfrom product \nlabeling1  to  compulsory  displays  of  patriotism2โand  have  concluded  that  some  types  of \ncompelled speech are more constitutionally suspect than others. Although a complex range of \nfactors may come into play, the type of forced-speech policy most likely to run afoul of the First \nAmendment is, generally speaking, one in which โindividuals are coerced into betraying their \nconvictionsโ by โinvoluntar[ily] affirm[ing]โ the governmentโs position on a โcontroversialโ \ntopic. Janus v. Am. Fedโn of State, Cnty., & Mun. Emps., Council 31, 138 S. Ct. 2448, 2464, \n2476 (2018). That is particularly true when the controversial speech being compelled is not \nโpurely factualโ in nature. Natโl Inst. of Fam. & Life Advocs. v. Becerra, 138 S. Ct. 2361, 2372 \n(2018) (โNIFLAโ) (quoting Zauderer v. Off. of Disciplinary Couns. of Supreme Ct. of Ohio, 471 \nU.S. 626, 651 (1985)) \nThe  Supreme  Court  has  expressly  recognized  that  โsexual  orientation  and  gender \nidentityโ are among the โcontroversial subjectsโ capable of raising such constitutional concerns. \nJanus, 138 S. Ct. at 2476. In 2021, however, the Tennessee General Assembly passed a law \nmandating that private parties voice a specific message on precisely that issue. The newly-\nenacted law requires any qualifying business with what the court will, for efficiencyโs sake, refer \n \n1 See, e.g., Disc. Tobacco City & Lottery, Inc. v. United States, 674 F.3d 509 (6th Cir. 2012). \n \n2 See, e.g., W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943). \n \n2 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 2 of 40 PageID #: 1132\n\nto as a โtrans-inclusiveโ restroom policyโthat is, a  formal or informal policy of allowing \ntransgender  and  nonbinary  patrons  to  use  the  restrooms  that  they  earnestly  believe  to  be \nappropriate for themโto post a garish warning sign announcing that policy in specific language \nof the governmentโs, not their, choice. This First Amendment challenge predictably followed. \nThe defendants in this case, public officials charged with enforcing that law, do not \ndispute that, if Tennessee had adopted a statute requiring private individuals to endorse or \ndenounce a particular view of transgender individuals or transgender rights, that law would be \nunconstitutional. Rather, the defendants argue that Tennesseeโs law is nothing but a harmless, \ncontent-neutral rule directed at clarifying restroom signage, not a public jab at transgender \nTennesseans  or  an  endorsement  of  a  particular  vision  of  how  gender  identity  should  be \nunderstood. Even a cursory examination of the facts, however, reveals that the governmentโs \ndefense of the law is, at best, a thin and unconvincing veneer applied to a law that does exactly \nwhat the plaintiffs say it does. Because that kind of forced affirmance of a contestable message \nviolates the Constitution, the plaintiffs argue, the enforcement of the Act should be enjoined. \nII. BACKGROUND \n   \nA. The Parties \n1. Plaintiffs. Bongo owns several restaurants and coffee shops, as well as a coffee \nroasting operation. Bernstein is its founder and chief manager. In that capacity, Bernstein is \nresponsible for overseeing the operations of Bongoโs businesses and making decisions regarding \nday-to-day issues, including those involving the businessesโ compliance with building codes. \n(Doc. No. 40 ยถยถ 1โ3.) \nOne of Bongoโs most prominent restaurants is Fido, located in Nashvilleโs Hillsboro \nVillage  neighborhood.  Since  Bernstein  opened  Fido  in  1996,  it  has  employed  hundreds  of \n3 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 3 of 40 PageID #: 1133\n\nindividuals and served many more, and it has counted transgender individuals among both its \ncustomers and its employees. (Id. ยถยถ 45โ47.) According to Bernstein, he and Bongo have made a \nconcerted effort to create a โwelcoming environment . . . for the LGBTQ communityโ at Fido. \n(Id. ยถ 48.) For example, Bernstein states that Fidoโs employees โdecorated one of their drink \nmenu  signs  with  transgender  and  LGBTQ  pride  flag  colors.โ  (Id.)  That  step,  according  to \nBernstein, was a direct response to perceived hostility to transgender people in the form of a \nโrash of anti-transgender laws.โ (Id.) \nFido  has  three  restrooms,  including  two  multiple-user  restrooms  bearing  โsex \ndesignations.โ (Id. ยถ 49.) Before the law at issue in this case was enacted, Bernstein and the rest \nof Fidoโs management โhad never thought about a formal policy as to who could use which \nrestroom.โ (Id. ยถ 51.) However, the restaurantโs โinformal policy was to allow people to use the \nsex-designated restroom that best matches their gender identity.โ (Id. ยถ 52.) \n2. State-Level Defendants. Carter Lawrence is the Commissioner of the Tennessee \nDepartment of Commerce and Insurance. Part of his duties, as Commissioner, is serving as the \nState of Tennesseeโs Fire Marshall and heading the State Fire Marshallโs Office (โSFMOโ). It is \nundisputed that Fire Marshall Lawrence is โauthorized by statute to enforce the state building \ncode.โ (Id. ยถ 4 (citing Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 68-120-106).)  \nChristopher Bainbridge is the SFMOโs Director of Codes Enforcement. It is undisputed \nthat  Director  Bainbridge,  like  Commissioner  Lawrence,  โhas  enforcement  authority  over \nstatewide building codes and standards.โ (Id. ยถ 5.) \n The SFMOโs duties include โreceiving, reviewing, and responding to complaints from \nthe public about violationsโ of that code. (Id. ยถ 25.) When SFMO receives a complaint, it is \nauthorized to send a building inspector to perform a physical inspection of the subject building at \n4 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 4 of 40 PageID #: 1134\n\nissue and to โissue a notice of violation to the building occupant informing them of the violation \nand directing them to remedy the violation by a set deadline.โ (Id. ยถ 26.)  \nThe  SFMO  considers  some  parts  of  Tennessee  to  be  what  it  refers  to  as  โexempt \njurisdictions.โ (Id. ยถ 27.) See Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 68-120-101(b)(1)(B). An exempt jurisdiction, \nhowever, is not actually exempt from compliance with the building code or from enforcement by \nthe SFMO. Rather, the parties agree that, in an exempt jurisdiction, the SFMO โshares the \nauthority  to  enforce  the  provisions  of  the  Tennessee  Building  Code  .  .  .  with  [exempt \njurisdictionsโ]  local  law  enforcement  agenciesโ  in  a  โconcurrentโ  manner.  (Id.  ยถ  28.)  The \nDefendants  concede  that,  โ[w]here  there  is  a  conflict  between  SFMO  and  the  local  law \nenforcement agency, SFMO is authorized to resolve the conflict.โ (Id. ยถ 29.) What this means, in \npractice, is that the SFMO โallow[s]โ local authorities in exempt jurisdictions to be the โprimary \nenforcement authorityโ when it comes to matters on which the SFMO and those authorities \nagree, but not if โthere is a conflictโ between the two. (Doc. No. 37-9 at 21 (testimony of Rule \n30(b)(6) witness representing the SFMO).) \nโWhen an exempt jurisdiction refuses or otherwise fails to enforce the provisions of the \nTennessee Building Code, SFMO is authorized to notify the exempt jurisdiction of the failure \nand to take further enforcement action if the local authority persists in its failure to enforce.โ \n(Doc.  No.  40  ยถ  30.)  The  SFMO  does  not,  however,  have  a  general  statutory  authority  to \ncommence criminal prosecutions of building code violations, which, like other state-law criminal \nprosecutions, are in the purview of the stateโs local DAGs. \n3. Prosecutor Defendants. Glenn R. Funk is the DAG of Tennesseeโs 20th Judicial \nDistrict. In that capacity, he โis responsible for prosecuting all violations of the state criminal \nstatutes occurring in the judicial district.โ (Id. ยถ 6 (citing Tenn. Code Ann. ยงยง 8-7-103, 40-3-\n5 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 5 of 40 PageID #: 1135\n\n104).) Neal Pinkston is the DAG for Tennesseeโs 11th Judicial District. His duties in that district \nare the same as Funkโs in the 20th. (Id. ยถ 7.) \nB. The Act \n  1. Express Provisions of the Act. On April 29, 2021, the Tennessee General Assembly \npassed H.B. 1182/S.B. 1224, which the Governor signed into law on May 17, 2021 and which \nthis court will refer to as โthe Act.โ (See Doc. No. 1-1 at 4.) The Act went into effect on July 1, \n2021. (Id.) Subsection (a) of the Act requires that any  \npublic or private entity or business that operates a building or facility open to the \ngeneral public and that, as a matter of formal or informal policy, allows a member \nof either biological sex to use any public restroom within the building or facility \nshall post notice of the policy at the entrance of each public restroom in the \nbuilding or facility. \n \nAct ยง 1(a). The Act defines โpolicyโ to mean โthe internal policy of a public or private entity or \nsuch policy as the result of a rule, ordinance, or resolution adopted by an agency or political \nsubdivision of this state.โ Act ยง 1(d)(1). It defines โpublic restroomโ as any โlocker room, \nshower facility, dressing area, or other facility or area that is . . . [o]pen to the general public; \n[d]esignated for a specific biological sex; and [a] facility or area where a person would have a \nreasonable expectation of privacy.โ Act ยง 1(d)(2). That definition โ[e]xcludes a unisex, single-\noccupant  restroom  or  family  restroom  intended  for  use  by  either  biological  sex.โ  Act  ยง \n1(d)(2)(B). \nAlthough  subsection  (a)  of  the  Act,  on  its  face,  requires  only  a  posted  โnotice,โ \nsubsection (b) mandates, in detail, the form that that notice must take: \nSignage of the notice must be posted in a manner that is easily visible to a person \nentering the public restroom and must meet the following requirements:  \n \n(1) Be at least eight inches (8โ) wide and six inches (6โ) tall;  \n \n6 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 6 of 40 PageID #: 1136\n\n(2) The top one-third (1/3) of the sign must have a background color of red \nand state โNOTICEโ in yellow text, centered in that portion of the sign;  \n \n(3) The bottom two-thirds (2/3) of the sign must contain in boldface, block \nletters the following statement centered on that portion of the sign:  \n \nTHIS  FACILITY  MAINTAINS  A  POLICY  OF  ALLOWING \nTHE USE OF RESTROOMS BY EITHER BIOLOGICAL SEX, \nREGARDLESS OF THE DESIGNATION ON THE RESTROOM  \n \n(4) Except as provided in subdivision (b)(2), have a background color of \nwhite with type in black; and  \n \n(5) Be located on a door to which the sign must be affixed or have its \nleading edge located not more than one foot (1โ) from the outside edge of \nthe frame of a door to which the sign must be affixed. \n \nAct ยง 1(b).  \nThe Act gives any entity or business that is in violation of the Act thirty days from being \nโnotified that it is not in complianceโ to post the required signage, after which โactionโ may be \nโtaken against the entity or business.โ Act ยง 1(c). Because the Act is situated in the stateโs \nbuilding code, a violation of the Actโthat is, not placing a required sign and then refusing, after \nthirty days, to do soโis a Class B misdemeanor. Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 68-120-108(a).  \n  2.  The  Actโs  Scope.  The  language  stating  that  the  Act  applies  only  to  restrooms \nโ[d]esignated for a specific biological sexโ is somewhat confusing, given that few, if any, public \nrestrooms in Tennessee make any express reference to โbiological sexโ in their signage. The \nlegislative history of the Act, however, which the court will discuss in the next subsection, makes \nclear that the General Assembly intended the Act to reach any restroom with a verbal designation \nsuch as โmenโ or, by extension, a visual designation such as an icon appearing to wear gendered \nclothing.  \nThis court is constitutionally bound to interpret the Act in the manner that it believes that \nthe Tennessee Supreme Court would. In re Fair Fin. Co., 834 F.3d 651, 671 (6th Cir. 2016) \n7 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 7 of 40 PageID #: 1137\n\n(discussing Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S. Ct. 817 (1938)). Tennessee caselaw is \nclear that, โ[w]hen construing a statute, the intent of the legislature must prevail,โ at least as long \nas the legislatureโs intent can be reconciled with the โnatural and ordinary meaning of the \nlanguage in the statute, within the context of the entire statute.โ Young v. Frist Cardiology, \nPLLC, 599 S.W.3d 568, 571 (Tenn. 2020) (citing Lee Med., Inc. v. Beecher, 312 S.W.3d 515, \n526โ27 (Tenn. 2010)). In this case, the meaning expressly intended by the Tennessee General \nAssembly is among the readings consistent with the plain language of the Act, and that is that the \nAct applies to restrooms that are designated for use by any specific sex or gender in the ordinary \nmannerโsuch as, for example, with a sign reading โMenโ or โWomenโโif the establishmentโs \nformal or informal policy does not restrict access to those restrooms by โbiological sex,โ as the \nterm was understood by the General Assembly. \n3.  Circumstances  of  Enactment.  The  Actโs  sponsor,  Representative  Tim  Rudd, \nexplained  that  he  introduced  the  Act  because  he  was  concerned  about  โ[n]ew  executive \norders . . .  and  new  legislation  proposed  in  Congress  giving  transgenders  [sic]  rights  and \nextending those rights.โ3 He initially suggested, however, that he did not consider the law to be \nโaimed at  transgenders  [sic].โ4 Rather, he was  concerned, he said, about the possibility of \nhypothetical sexual predators who would โtake advantage ofโ trans-inclusive public restroom \npolicies to โassault[] or rape[]โ other restroom users.5 Shortly before that declaration, Rudd was \nasked by Tennessee House Speaker Pro Tempore Pat Marsh whether the State was โhaving a \nproblem with this now, that you know of . . . anywhere.โ Rudd was unable to provide any \n \n3 Debate of H.B. 1182 Before the H. Pub. Serv. Comm. at 31:49, 112th Gen. Assemb. (Mar. 10, 2021), at \nhttps://tnga.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=610&clip_id=24150. \n \n4 Id. \n \n5 Id. \n \n8 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 8 of 40 PageID #: 1138\n\nexamples or evidence of such a problem. Instead, he explained that โ[w]e shouldnโt wait for \npeopleโs rights to be abusedโ in order to act and potentially prevent โan attack.โ6  \nAt a later committee hearing, however, Representative Rudd explained that the Act was \njustified, at least in part, by the fact that, in his view, โa woman has the right to know whether a \nman is going to be in her bathroom and vice versa for a man.โ (Doc. No. 40 ยถ 20.) During floor \ndebates, Representative Rudd stated that it is โshocking and a danger to people when they walk \ninto a restroom marked โmenโ or โwomenโ and [someone of] the opposite sex is standing there. It \ncould scare them. It could provoke violence.โ7 The General Assembly ultimately approved the \nAct, and the Governor signed it into law. (Doc. No. 40 ยถ 23.) \nC. This Case \n  On June 25, 2021, the plaintiffs, along with two other plaintiffs who are no longer part of \nthis litigation,8 filed a Complaint in this court stating a single count pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \nfor โviolat[ing] Plaintiffsโ rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution by \ncompelling them, on pain of criminal penalty, to communicate a misleading and controversial \ngovernment-mandated message that they would not otherwise display.โ (Doc. No. 1 ยถ 85.) \nContemporaneously with the Complaint, they filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction asking \nthe court to enjoin the enforcement of the Act. (Doc. No. 6 at 1.) The defendants opposed the \nmotion, arguing, among other things that, (1) the plaintiffs lacked standing, (2) the plaintiffsโ \n \n6 Id. at 31:17.  \n \n7 Discussion of H.B. 1182 Before H. Floor Sess., 18th Legis. Day at 1:51:00, 112th Gen. Assemb. (Mar. \n29, 2021), at http://tnga.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=610&clip_id=24423&meta_id=579987. \n \n8 Because those plaintiffs, who were from Hamilton County, are no longer part of this case, the court will \ndismiss any remaining claim specifically against DAG Pinkston, who lacks any enforcement authority \nover the remaining plaintiffs and therefore cannot be tied to a cognizable injury-in-fact against those \nplaintiffs. \n9 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 9 of 40 PageID #: 1139\n\nclaims were not ripe, and (3) the plaintiffsโ claims were unlikely to succeed on the merits. (Doc. \nNo. 21.) \n  On July 9, 2021, the court granted the plaintiffsโ motion. (Doc. Nos. 22โ23.) On the issue \nof standing, the court noted that the plaintiffs were subject to โlongstanding and well-established \nexpectations  that  they  must  complyโ  with  the  stateโs  building  code,  even  if  enforcement \nproceedings had not yet been formally instituted against them. (Doc. No. 22 at 14.) The court \nalso noted that their claims โf[e]ll well within the ordinary, well-established boundaries of pre-\nenforcement standing in the First Amendment context.โ (Id.) The court rejected the defendantsโ \nargument regarding ripeness on the same general groundsโthat, because the plaintiffs already \nfaced an injury caused by the imposition and enforceability of the Act, they did not need to \nactually wait until proceedings were specifically threatened or formally instituted against them to \nhave  a  constitutionally cognizable  injury.  (Id.  at  17.)  Finally,  the  court  concluded  that  the \nplaintiffs had demonstrated a strong likelihood of success under well-established precedents \napplying strict constitutional scrutiny to laws mandating private individuals to voice their support \nof  a  government-mandated  message  on  a  contestable  ideological  issue.  (Id.  at  17โ26.) \nAccordingly, the court enjoined the defendants from enforcing the Act. (Id. at 23.) \n  The parties proceeded to discovery, and, on January 31, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a motion \nfor summary judgment (Doc. No. 35), which the defendants have opposed (Doc. No. 39). The \nparties have supported their respective positions with depositions, interrogatory responses, and \nother documentary evidence. \nD. Additional Evidence Relevant to Summary Judgment \n1. Evidence Regarding Enforcement of the Act. Under Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure, a litigant โmay, by oral questions, depose any person, including a partyโ to the \n10 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 10 of 40 PageID #: 1140\n\ncase,  if  the  proposed  deponent  possesses  relevant  information  and  otherwise  meets  the \nrequirements of the Rule. Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(a)(1). The practice of relying on oral depositions, \nhowever,  poses  a  challenge  when  what  is  needed  is  not  the  view  or  position  of  a  single \nindividual, but of an organization as a whole. To that end, Rule 30(b)(6) permits a party to โname \nas the deponent a public or private corporation, a partnership, an association, a governmental \nagency, or other entity,โ after which the party from whom the deposition was sought โmust \ndesignate one or more officers, directors, or managing agents, or designate other persons who \nconsent to testify on its behalf.โ Id. The plaintiffs in this case sought a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition \non behalf of the SFMO and the offices of the two DAG defendants. The defendants elected for \nthose three offices to testify through the same representative, Joyce Leigh Ferguson. (See Doc. \nNo. 37-9 at 5.) \nAlthough Fergusonโs testimony was at times unclear, the parties agree that she ultimately \nโtestified that an entity that permits transgender people to use the restroom that aligns with their \ngender identity but refused to post the sign mandated by the Act would be in violation of the \nAct.โ (Doc. No. 40. ยถ 35.) That is to say, she confirmed that the SFMOโs interpretation of the Act \nwas the same one espoused in the General Assembly. Ferguson further confirmed that the \nSFMOโs position was that โany person who violates that provision would commit a Class B \nmisdemeanor.โ (Doc. No. 37-9 at 65.) Ferguson explained that, in SFMOโs view, the agency was \nโbound by the statuteโ to take that position and act accordingly. (Id.) As such, if SFMO was \ninformed of any instance that met its definition of a violation of the Act , it โwould likely send a \nnotice to the property owner that we received the complaint and that they had 30 days to notify \nus if they were in compliance with the Act.โ (Id. at 62.) The parties agree that the business \n11 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 11 of 40 PageID #: 1141\n\nownerโs response to such a demand by the SFMO would be subject to Tennesseeโs criminal \nprohibition on submitting false information to a state regulatory agency. (Doc. No. 40 ยถ 34.) \nFerguson was asked about what steps the SFMO might take in response to a violation of \nthe Act, other than issuing a notice of violation and demanding a response. She responded that \nโmost of the other remediesโ directly available to the SFMO โare limited to . . . hazards from \nfireโ and that the Agency โdoes not consider the violation of the Act to present a hazard from \nfire.โ (Doc. No. 37-9 at 63.) Accordingly, if the SFMO was โnot . . . able to obtain compliance \nthrough [its] actions, [it] would refer [the matter] to the local District Attorney for them to \nreview.โ (Id.) \nFerguson also testified that, if the SFMO concluded that an exempt jurisdiction had failed \nor refused to enforce the stateโs building code, including the Act, the SFMO could initiate \nproceedings before an administrative law judge to have that jurisdictionโs exempt status revoked. \n(Id. at 81โ82.) Ferguson also confirmed that, even if an exempt jurisdiction has not lost its \nexempt status, the SFMO considers itself to have the authority toโand willโtake action if it \ndeems such steps necessary. (Id. at 83โ84.) Those actions, however, would be subject to the \ngeneral  statutory  enforcement  structure  that  Ferguson  described,  which  relies  on  local \nprosecutors to bring criminal charges after the SFMOโs own efforts fail. \n2. Evidence Regarding Biology and Gender Identity. The plaintiffs have filed an \nexpert  report  by  Dr.  Shayne  Sebold  Taylor,  M.D.,  to  provide  some  medical  background \nregarding issues related to the Act.9 (Doc. No. 37-4.) Dr. Taylor is an Assistant Professor of \n \n9 Earlier in this case, Dr. Taylor provided a Declaration memorializing the same general opinions and \nconclusions, which the plaintiffs filed in support of their Motion for Preliminary Injunction. (See Doc. \nNo. 7-3.) As a result, this portion of the courtโs opinion will repeat many facts that the court has already \ndiscussed. Such repetition is necessary, given the distinct procedural postures of the two motions. \n12 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 12 of 40 PageID #: 1142\n\nInternal  Medicine  and  Pediatrics  at  Vanderbilt  University  Medical  Center  and  the  Monroe \nCarrell Jr. Childrenโs Hospital, both in Nashville. (Id. ยถ 2.)  \nDr. Taylor explains that, from a medical perspective, the category of โsexโ is โfar more \ncomplex than what is seen on genital examโโthe mechanism through which individuals are \ntypically assigned a sex designation at birth. (Id. ยถ 15.) Rather, the concept of sex implicates \na complex compilation of multiple factors including oneโs chromosomal make up \n(XX for those assigned female at birth, XY for those assigned male at birth), \ngonadal sex (presence of ovaries or testes), fetal hormonal sex (production of sex \nhormones by the fetus or exogenous exposure of sex hormones to the developing \nfetus), pubertal hormonal sex (the change in hormonal milieu that results in the \ndevelopment of secondary sexual characteristics- facial hair and deep voice for \nthose assigned male at birth, breasts and menstrual cycles for those assigned  \nfemale), hypothalamic sex (variations in brain structure and function as a result of \nembryonal exposure of sex hormones), and gender identity. \n \n(Id.) Unsurprisingly, given the general diversity of human minds and bodies, there โcan be \nvariationsโ among the many potential combinations of those factors. (Id. ยถ 16.) Dr. Taylor \nexplains  that,  โ[f]or  example,  many  children  are  born  with  ambiguous  genitalia,โ  a  sexual \npresentation generally described as being โintersex.โ (Id.)  \nSuch variations are not limited to outward characteristics. Dr. Taylor explains that, while \nthere are two โtypical human chromosomal make up[s]โ associated with designation as male and \nfemale, there are also other chromosomal configurations that naturally occur in the human \npopulation. (Id.) Males with Klinefelter Syndrome, for example, have an extra X chromosome, \nwhile females with Turner Syndrome are, compared to most individuals assigned female at birth, \nmissing  an  X  chromosome.  These  chromosomal  variations  often  lead  to  physical  and \ndevelopmental differences, such as the development of breasts in patients genitally identified as \nmale. (Id.)  \n13 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 13 of 40 PageID #: 1143\n\n  Dr. Taylor explains that, according to the current understanding in his field, โgender \nidentityโ  is  an  internal,  psychological  phenomenon  that  is  conceptually  distinct  from  any \nparticular physical trait. Rather, โ[g]ender identity is a personโs inner sense of belonging to a \nparticular gender.โ (Id. ยถ 17.) Although there may be disagreement among people about the \nnormative question of what role gender identity should play in various situations, the purely \ndescriptive  fact  that  gender  identity,  as  a  type  of  internally  experienced  and  reported \nphenomenon,  exists  is  supported  by  both  medical  research  and,  at  least  for  many  people, \nconfirmed by the ordinary experience of being a human. (Id.)  \nMany people report experiencing a gender identity that is inconsistent with the sex that \nthey were assigned at birth based on a genital exam. If an individualโs gender identity differs \nfrom their sex assigned at birth, that person is typically referred to as โtransgender.โ (Id. ยถ 20.) \nAccording to Dr. Taylor, a 2016 study estimated that about 31,000 transgender people live in \nTennessee, amounting to around 0.6% of the stateโs population (Id. ยถ 29.)  \nDr. Taylor states that the โlack of alignment of assigned sex and gender identity can \nresult in severe distress, depression, [and] anxiety,โ a โconstellation of symptoms . . . termed \ngender dysphoria.โ (Id. ยถ 21.) As with any psychological condition that has a demonstrated \nnegative  effect  on  individualsโ  lives,  treatments  have  been  developed  to  address  gender \ndysphoria. In particular, many individuals who have experienced gender dysphoria elect to \nundergo  โgender  transition,โ  a  โlengthy  process  with  multiple  components,โ  including, \npotentially, โsocial transition, medical transition, and surgical transition.โ10 (Id. ยถ 23.) โSocial \n \n10 Dr. Taylor explains that medical and surgical transition can lead to changes in physical presentation \neven greater than changes to clothing, hair, makeup, or other non-medical external gender expressions. \nFor example, a transgender man might undergo testosterone treatments that would allow him to grow a \nfull beard and develop a deep voice, although the individual had been designated female at birth and, \nprior to medical transition, had not had those physical characteristics. (Doc. No. 37-4 ยถ 28.) Accordingly, \nan individual who has undergone medical transition, but who is then required to use the restroom \n14 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 14 of 40 PageID #: 1144\n\ntransition can include going by a different name, using different pronouns, or changing oneโs \nhaircut . . . or clothing to match oneโs gender identity.โ (Id. ยถ 24.) At least for many individuals, \nsuccessful social transition means being able to โseamlessly incorporate into their communities \nwith a presentation that matches with their gender identity.โ (Id. ยถ 25.) In order to do so, the \nindividual, if confronted with a situation in which they need to select a restroom designated as \nfor men or for women, may select the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity. (Id.)  \nThe plaintiffs have provided medical publications establishing that Dr. Taylorโs view of \nthese  matters  is  not  uniqueโnamely,  a  piece  from  The  Lancet  regarding  the  โmisuses  of \nโbiological sexโโ and a publication of the Annals of Internal Medicine entitled โCare of the \nTransgender Patient.โ (Doc. Nos. 37-7 & -8.) \n  3. Defendantsโ Responses to Plaintiffsโ Asserted Facts. Under this courtโs local rules, \nโany motion for summary judgment . . . must be accompanied by a separate, concise statement of \nthe material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue for trial,โ and \nโ[e]ach fact must be supported by specific citation to the record.โ L.R. 56.01(b). After that \nstatement of undisputed material facts is filed, any party opposing the motion must โrespond to \neach fact set forth by the movant by either (i) agreeing that the fact is undisputed; (ii) agreeing \nthat the fact is undisputed for the purpose of ruling on the motion for summary judgment only; or \n(iii) demonstrating that the fact is disputed.โ L.R. 56.01(c). In compliance with this Rule, the \nplaintiffsโ Statement of Undisputed Material Facts includes a number of discussions of and \ncitations to Dr. Taylorโs report, to which the defendants have responded. While the defendantsโ \nresponses do challenge a few genuinely factual components of Dr. Taylorโs claims, the bulk of \n \ncorresponding to their sex assigned at birth, might, as a practical matter, give other users of the restroom \nthe impression that the individual was disregarding the restroomโs gender or sex designation by, for \nexample, having a full beard and deep voice, as well as potentially male-coded clothing, in a restroom \ndesignated as for women. \n15 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 15 of 40 PageID #: 1145\n\ntheir responses serve not so much to actually refute Dr. Taylorโs factual assertions, but to (1) \ndemonstrate that there are other, competing viewpoints and (2) explain how individuals who hold \nthose other, competing viewpoints would characterize the same basic facts.  \nFor example, the plaintiffs cite Dr. Taylorโs opinion to discuss the process by which \ninfants are โassigned male [or female] at birth.โ (Doc. No. 40 ยถ 60.) The defendants flag those \nstatementsโand many others involving assignment of sex at birthโas โ[d]isputedโ because, \naccording to the defendants, โsex is not assigned at birth; it is recorded as male or female.โ (Id. ยถ \n62.) But, of course, that is not a factual dispute at all; the plaintiffs and defendants are simply \ncharacterizing the exact same social practice, which both sides agree occurs, in different ways, \nbased on different  underlying assumptions about the norms and terminology at issue. This \npattern occurs over and over. Indeed, at one point, the defendants abandon even bothering to cite \ncountervailing evidence, simply dismissing the plaintiffsโ assertions, supported by citation to Dr. \nTaylorโs report, by stating that โ[t]hese novel ideas are merely theories, and a transgender \nindividualโs  gender  identity  is  not  determined  by  the  biological  reality  of  how  his  or  her \nreproductive system is organized.โ (Doc. No. 40 ยถ 64.)  \nThe picture ultimately conveyed by this mostly unproductive back-and-forth is not one of \nfactual disagreement. Rather,  the plaintiffsโ assertions and the defendantsโ responses, taken \ntogether, serve to demonstrate what many observers likely already know: that there are, in \nTennessee and in the United States more broadly, starkly differing viewpoints regarding how \nconcepts and terminology related to sex and gender should be regarded and used. \nIII. LEGAL STANDARD \nRule 56 requires the court to grant a motion for summary judgment if โthe movant shows \nthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a \n16 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 16 of 40 PageID #: 1146\n\nmatter of law.โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party has the initial burden of informing the \ncourt of the basis for its motion and identifying portions of the record that demonstrate the \nabsence of a genuine dispute over material facts. Rodgers v. Banks, 344 F.3d 587, 595 (6th Cir. \n2003.) The moving party may satisfy this burden by presenting affirmative evidence that negates \nan element of the non-moving partyโs claim or by demonstrating an absence of evidence to \nsupport the non-moving partyโs case. Id.  \nAccordingly, to win summary judgment as to its own claims, a moving plaintiff must \ndemonstrate that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to all essential elements of its claims. \nOnce the moving party makes its initial showing, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to \nprovide evidence beyond the pleadings, โset[ting] forth specific facts showing that there is a \ngenuine issue for trial.โ Moldowan v. City of Warren, 578 F.3d 351, 374 (6th Cir. 2009); see also \nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986). โIn evaluating the evidence, the court \nmust draw all inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.โ Moldowan, 578 \nF.3d at 374 (citing Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986)). \nAt this stage, โโthe judgeโs function is not . . . to weigh the evidence and determine the \ntruth of the matter, but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.โโ Id. (quoting \nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249 (1986)). But โ[t]he mere existence of a \nscintilla of evidence in support of the [non-moving partyโs] position will be insufficient,โ and the \npartyโs proof must be more than โmerely colorable.โ Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. An issue of fact \nis โgenuineโ only if a reasonable jury could find for the non-moving party. Moldowan, 578 F.3d \nat 374 (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252). \nIV. ANALYSIS \nA. Standing/Ripeness \n17 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 17 of 40 PageID #: 1147\n\nThe defendantsโ arguments regarding standing and ripeness are essentially the same at \nthis stage as they were when the court considered the plaintiffsโ request for a preliminary \ninjunction.  Specifically,  the  defendants  argue  that  the  plaintiffs  have  failed  to  present  a \njusticiable case or controversy because the Act has not yet been enforced against them and they \nhave not yet received the required 30-day notice that a prosecution under the Act is forthcoming. \nThe facts developed in discovery, however, bear out the conclusion that the court previously held \nwas likely: that the plaintiffs have demonstrated a rational, substantial, and concrete fear of the \nimminent consequences of being deemed out of compliance with the stateโs building code, \ngiving rise to a concrete and particularized injury-in-fact sufficient to support standing and \nprovide the basis for a ripe claim. \n1. Standing. Article III of the Constitution grants the federal courts jurisdiction only over \nโcases and controversies,โ of which the component of standing is an โessential and unchanging \npart.โ Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992); see also Warth v. Seldin, 422 \nU.S. 490, 498 (1975). A party seeking to invoke the courtโs jurisdiction must establish the \nnecessary standing to sue before the court may consider the merits of that partyโs cause of action. \nWhitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 154 (1990). To establish standing under the Constitution, a \nplaintiff must show that: (1) he has suffered an โinjury in factโ that is (a) concrete and (b) \nparticularized, as well as (c) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) the injury is \nfairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to \nmerely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by the relief requested. Gaylor v. Hamilton \nCrossing CMBS, 582 F. Appโx 576, 579โ80 (6th Cir. 2014) (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560โ61); \nsee also Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180โ81 \n(2000).  These  mandatory  minimum  constitutional  requirementsโcommonly  known  as  (1) \n18 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 18 of 40 PageID #: 1148\n\ninjury-in-fact, (2) causation, and (3) redressabilityโapply in every case. The defendants argue \nthat the plaintiffs cannot meet the first requirement, an injury-in-fact that is imminent, not merely \nconjectural or hypothetical, because the Act has not yet been enforced against them and they do \nnot know, with certainty, that it will be. \nAs the defendants ultimately concede, however, Article III does not require a plaintiff to \nengage  in  โcostly  futile  gestures  simply  to  establish  standing,  particularly  when  the  First \nAmendment is implicated.โ Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians v. Mich. \nGaming Control Bd., 172 F.3d 397, 406 (6th Cir. 1999) (citing Virginia v. Am. Booksellers \nAssโn, Inc., 484 U.S. 383, 392โ93 (1988); Clements v. Fashing, 457 U.S. 957, 962 (1982)). To \nthe contrary, it is well established that โan actual arrest, prosecution, or other enforcement action \nis not a prerequisite to challengingโ the constitutionality of a law regulating an organizationโs \nongoing and expected future behavior. Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 \n(2014) (citing MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, 128โ29 (2007); Steffel v. \nThompson, 415 U.S. 452, 459 (1974)). Nor is a plaintiff required to โexpose himself to liability \nbefore bringing suit.โ MedImmune, 549 U.S. at 129. A plaintiff may, for example, establish an \ninjury-in-fact based on its โintention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a \nconstitutional interest, but proscribed by a statute.โ Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat. Union, \n442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979).  \nA plaintiff can also establish an imminent injury by showing that it was forced to alter its \nbehavior based on a reasonable fear of enforcement. See Clements, 457 U.S. at 962 (finding \nstanding where plaintiffs alleged that, โbut for the . . . provision they seek to challenge, they \nwould engage in the very acts that would trigger the enforcement of the provisionโ). The caselaw \nalso recognizes that an injury-in-fact can arise, not merely out of actual or even expected \n19 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 19 of 40 PageID #: 1149\n\nenforcement  actions,  but  also  โcostly,  self-executing  compliance  burdensโ  or  because  the \nchallenged law sufficiently โchills protected First Amendment activity.โ Natโl Rifle Assโn of Am. \nv. Magaw, 132 F.3d 272, 279 (6th Cir. 1997) (citation omitted); accord Hyman v. City of \nLouisville, 53 F. Appโx 740, 743 (6th Cir. 2002); see also Am. Booksellers, 484 U.S. at 392 \n(finding standing because โplaintiffs . . . , if their interpretation of the statute is correct, will have \nto take significant and costly compliance measures or risk criminal prosecutionโ) (citing Craig v. \nBoren, 429 U.S. 190, 194 (1976); Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 188 (1973)); Ohio Coal Assโn v. \nPerez, 192 F. Supp. 3d 882, 902 (S.D. Ohio 2016) (โ[A]dditional compliance burdens may serve \nas an injury in fact.โ) (citing All. for Nat. Health U.S. v. Sebelius, 775 F. Supp. 2d 114, 120โ21 \n(D.D.C. 2011)). A plaintiff can establish standing to challenge a law by showing that the law โis \ndirected at [the plaintiff] in particular[,] . . . requires [the plaintiff] to make significant changes in \n[its]  everyday . . . practices[,  and]  .  .  .  expose[s  the  plaintiff]  to  the  imposition  of  strong \nsanctionsโ for noncompliance. Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 154 (1967), abrogated on \nother grounds, Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977).  \nThe plaintiffsโ claims fall well within the well-established boundaries of pre-enforcement \nstanding in the First Amendment context. As the court previously observed, the Act is not some \nobscure provision tucked away in a seldom-referenced corner of Tennesseeโs statutes; it is part of \nthe stateโs formal building code, a code with which businesses such as the plaintiffsโ have well-\nestablished expectations that they must comply. The legislative history of the Act, moreover, \nshows an affirmative intent that the Act be enforced immediately, before any supposed risk of \nharm can materialize, and there is no evidence that the Stateโs executive branch disagrees with \nthat position.  \n20 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 20 of 40 PageID #: 1150\n\nThe defendants point out that DAG Funkโs apparent public statements regarding the Act \nsuggest that he is unlikely to pursue a criminal case based on a violation by Bongo or any other \nbusiness. No such assurance, however, actually appears in any admissible form in the record, \ndespite DAG Funkโs being a party in this case, nor have the defendants explained how they \nwould establish such a policy, if it exists, at trial. The defendants, moreover, have not identified \nany caselaw suggesting that a prosecutorโs non-binding statement in support of exercising his \nenforcement discretion is sufficient to defeat what is otherwise a plainly sufficient constitutional \ninjury.  \nMoreover, as the plaintiffs have now demonstrated, the defendants have tools that they \nare empowered and foreseeably likely to wield against violators, even without the cooperation of \nDAG Funk. A business that violates the Act openlyโthe only way that the Act can be violated, \ngiven  that  it  involves  public  signageโeffectively  invites  an  investigation  and  demand  for \ninformation from a state building inspector that the business otherwise would not receive and \nmay even be subject to a physical inspection. The SFMOโs Rule 30(b)(6) witness confirmed, \nmoreover, that, once a building inspector has turned his eye to an establishment, he mayโand \nindeed is expected toโnote certain other violations he notices, even if those violations were not \nthe original impetus for scrutiny. (Doc. No. 37-9 at 61 (testifying that an inspector should note \nany โserious life safety hazards or violations that they see on their way to conduct [an] inspection \nof [an] underlying allegationโ of a general building code violation). The result is that, even \nwholly aside from the prospect of an eventual potential criminal prosecution, the Act effectively \nsubjects those who defy it to a heightened level of potentially costly scrutiny under the stateโs \nbuilding code.  \n21 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 21 of 40 PageID #: 1151\n\nEven  in  cases  where  that  regulatory  scrutiny  does  not  result  in  an  actual  criminal \nprosecution, it is likely to require time, attention, and resources that regulated businesses do not \nwish to, and otherwise would not have to, expendโincluding by responding to the SFMOโs \ndemands for information. The imposition of such a regulatory burden is, in and of itself, a legally \ncognizable injury-in-fact. See Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged v. Sebelius, 6 F. Supp. \n3d  1225,  1235  (D.  Colo.  2013)  (finding  constitutionally  sufficient  injury-in-fact  based  on \nplaintiffโs having to devote time and clerical resources to filling out a โself-certification formโ), \naffโd sub nom. Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged, Denver, Colo. v. Burwell, 794 F.3d \n1151 (10th Cir. 2015), vacated and remanded on other grounds without finding lack of standing \nsub nom. Zubik v. Burwell, 578 U.S. 403 (2016).  \nThe court, moreover, need not take the plaintiffsโ word for it that the SFMOโs actions \nunder the Act would be meaningfully coercive. SFMOโs own Rule 30(b)(6) witness confirmed \nthat  the  purpose  of  SFMOโs  system  of  notices,  demands,  and  inspections  is  โto  obtain \ncompliance through [the agencyโs] actions.โ (Doc. No. 37-9 at 63.) It is unsurprising that that \nstrategy often works; the court doubts that any experienced business owner would sign on to the \nposition that an unwanted notice or demand for information from state building inspectors is \nnothing  to  worry  about  until  the  situation  reaches  the  advanced  stage  in  which  criminal \nprosecution is at hand. The fact that a violation of the building code can ensnare a business in a \ntime-consuming regulatory process, the threat of which itself encourages compliance, is part of \nhow the building code works in the first place. The same is true of the Act, as a component of \nthat code. \nThe defendantsโ argument is, in effect, that there is no injury in the fact that the plaintiffs \nmust choose between posting the required signage or trying to move forward, as a functioning \n22 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 22 of 40 PageID #: 1152\n\nbusiness, knowing that the government has a building code violation in its back pocket to use \nany time it pleases, either to prosecute it or merely to bog it down in scrutiny from building \ninspectors. That would be a questionable proposition, even if the business was only putting itself \nat risk. A business that proceeds in violation of the stateโs building code, however, does not have \nthe luxury of shouldering its risk alone. Under Tennessee law, โany architect, builder, contractor, \nperson or corporation who has constructed or designed, or who has assisted in the construction or \ndesigning of the building, structure, or premisesโ in which a violation is found can be held to \nhave โcommitted a separate offenseโ based on his involvement. Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 68-120-\n108(b). Accordingly, if a business were simply to proceed in open violation of the Act, it would \nnot only subject itself to legal exposure, it would run the same risk for any third party it involved \nin any project potentially bearing on the issue of bathroom signage and design. Each of those \npotential third parties would have its own business to preserve, its own reputation for compliance \nto maintain, and its own insurance policies and carriers to worry about. The idea that the \nplaintiffs can simply ask anyone they do relevant business with to set those concerns aside is \ndifficult to accept, to say the least. \nThe defendants attempt to liken this case to California v. Texas, 141 S. Ct. 2104, 2116 \n(2021), in which the Supreme Court held that an ostensible federal mandate that lacked any \nenforcement  mechanism  was  insufficient  to  give  rise  to  standing.  If  anything,  though,  the \ncontrast with California v. Texas highlights the degree to which the plaintiffs have, in fact, \nsuffered a concrete and particularized injury in this case. The provision at issue in California v. \nTexas  had  โno  means  of  enforcementโ  whatsoever.  Id.  at  2114.  There  was  not  a  single \ngovernment official empowered to take any action against a violator. The plaintiffsโ alleged \nโinjuryโ was therefore irremediable, because there was โno one, and nothing, to enjoin.โ Id. at \n23 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 23 of 40 PageID #: 1153\n\n2116. The Act, in contrast, is, if anything, notable for the number of officials empowered to \nenforce it. Most Tennessee laws are not formally and explicitly commended to the โconcurrent \njurisdictionโ  of  both  state-level  and  local  authorities.  There  are,  moreover,  a  number  of \nenforcement actions available to the defendants in their enforcement of the Act. The SFMO has \nthe  power  to  initiate  investigations  based  on  the  Act;  the  power  to  declare  a  building  in \nnoncompliance; the power to demand a response from the violator under penalty of perjury; and \nthe power to refer the matter for prosecution. Indeed, the SFMO even has the power to move to \nreplace a jurisdictionโs friendly local regulators with harsher state-level ones, if it feels that those \nlocal regulators are failing to pursue violations of the Act. And, of course, the Act, unlike the \nwholly vestigial provision at issue in California v. Texas, actually carries criminal liability for a \nviolator. Indeed, insofar as California v. Texas even presented what could be characterized as a \nclose questionโand the court notes that Tennessee was a party to that case and argued that there \nwas standing11โthen the question of whether standing exists here, where businesses are really at \nrisk and noncompliance is actually criminal, would seem to present a much easier call. \nIn short, the defendantsโ argument on standing fails for at least three reasons. First, the \ndefendants  cannot  overcome  the  well-established  recognition  of  pre-enforcement  challenges \nbased  on  imminent  enforcement  as  a  not  only  permissible,  but  an  indispensable,  tool  in \nprotecting the right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment. A world in which a private \nperson has to choose between complying with a controversial law or putting his business at risk, \nonly then to be able to sue, is not a world in which the First Amendment is being adequately \nprotected, and the caselaw recognizes as much. Second, the defendants ignore the large number \nof  damaging  enforcement-related  steps  that  the  defendants  are  empowered  to  take  before \n \n11 See Brief for Respondent/Cross-Petitioner States 19โ30, available at \nhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/19/19-840/146332/20200625125704552_Brief.pdf. \n24 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 24 of 40 PageID #: 1154\n\nescalating to criminal prosecution as a last resort. The existence and purpose of those steps, \nhowever, were confirmed by the defendantsโ own Rule 30(b)(6) witness. Finally, the defendantsโ \nposition rests on a faulty assumption for which they have failed to muster any meaningful factual \nsupport: that a Tennessee business can safely and without worry operate in open defiance of the \nstateโs  building  code,  based  solely  on  its  assumption  that  the  formal  commencement  of  a \ncriminal prosecution is hopefully unlikely and would be preceded by a warning. The court \ndoubts that any Tennessee state officialโlet alone the stateโs Fire Marshallโwould espouse \nsuch a position outside of the context of litigation. In any event, that line of reasoning is both \nimplausible and unsupported by the facts or law. The stateโs building code is a direct command, \nbacked  by  multiple  enforcement  mechanisms,  that  the  defendants  are  expected  to  honor \nimmediately, not only on the eve of criminal charges. Because a business that violates the Act \nsuffers a concrete and particularized injury-in-fact based on the consequences of noncompliance, \nincluding but not limited to the risk of criminal prosecution, the plaintiffs have established \nstanding. \n2. Ripeness. โA claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon โcontingent future \nevents that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.โโ Texas v. United States, \n523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998) (quoting Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co., 473 U.S. 568, \n580โ81  (1985)).  The  ripeness  requirement  exists,  in  part,  to  โprevent  the  courts,  through \navoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements.โ \nAbbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 148. The Supreme Court has suggested that the analysis of whether a \ncase is ripe for review is best conducted โin a twofold aspect, requiring the Court โto evaluate \nboth the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding \ncourt consideration.โโ Magaw, 132 F.3d at 285 (quoting Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 149).  \n25 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 25 of 40 PageID #: 1155\n\nโThe ripeness doctrine,โ as it has traditionally been understood, โis drawn both from \nArticle III limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to exercise \njurisdiction.โ Beech v. City of Franklin, Tenn., 687 F. Appโx 454, 457 (6th Cir. 2017) (quoting \nNatโl Park Hosp. Assโn v. Depโt of Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 808 (2003)). Recent cases have raised \nsome doubt with regard to whether the latter, purely prudential aspects of ripeness continue to \nprovide an independent basis for dismissing a case. See Miller v. City of Wickliffe, Ohio, 852 \nF.3d 497, 503 n.2 (6th Cir. 2017) (discussing questionable vitality of prudential ripeness in the \nwake of Lexmark Intโl, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 125โ28 (2014)); \nsee also Driehaus, 573 U.S. at 167 (same); Clark v. City of Seattle, 899 F.3d 802, 809 n.4 (9th \nCir. 2018) (same); but see Wyoming v. Zinke, 871 F.3d 1133, 1141 (10th Cir. 2017) (treating \nprudential ripeness as an exception to Lexmark). As a practical matter, however, even if the \nprudential foundations of ripeness have been undermined, no party to this case has identified any \nsubstantive change in the law of ripeness corresponding to such developments. \nAs the Sixth Circuit has observed, โ[t]he line between Article III standing and ripeness in \npreenforcement First Amendment challengesโ is so slim that it has, in effect, โevaporated.โ \nWinter v. Wolnitzek, 834 F.3d 681, 687 (6th Cir. 2016) (citing Driehaus, 573 U.S. at 165โ67). \nEven if there were some fine distinction between the two, moreover, the defendants have not \nidentified any basis for the courtโs analysis on the constitutional aspects of ripeness to differ \nfrom its analysis regarding standing. The defendants point to the fact that neither the plaintiffs \nnor anyone else knows exactly how the Act will be enforced if it is permitted to go fully into \neffect, which, the defendants suggest, means that these claims need more factual development. \nBut the fact that the Act puts businesses at the mercy of officialsโ enforcement discretion is part \nof the alleged problem with the Act in the first place, and no amount of waiting would fix that \n26 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 26 of 40 PageID #: 1156\n\nproblem. If the Act went into effect, and officials enforced it one way for the first month, that \nwould be no guarantee of how it would be enforced the next month or the next. If anything, the \nuncertainty regarding the Actโs  enforcement sheds a light on the degree to which the Act \nfunctions as a trap that the state can spring at any time on a business that it considers too friendly \nto its transgender patrons. But a trap is a trap, even before it goes off. The plaintiffsโ claims are \nripe now, and the court can consider them on the merits. \nB. Merits \n1. The Act Compels Private Speech to Which the Plaintiffs Object. โ[T]he right of \nfreedom of thought protected by the First Amendment against state action includes both the right \nto speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all.โ Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, \n714 (1977) (citations omitted). When a law not only requires an individual to speak but also \nmandates what a person will say, then courts must treat the law as โtarget[ing] speech based on \nits communicative contentโ and therefore โpresumptively unconstitutional,โ only to be upheld โif \nthe government proves that [the law is] narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests.โ \nEMW Womenโs Surgical Ctr., P.S.C. v. Beshear, 920 F.3d 421, 425 (6th Cir. 2019) (quoting \nNFILA, 138 S. Ct. at 2371). That standard is typically known as โstrict scrutiny.โ Ams. for \nProsperity Found. v. Bonta, No. 19-251, 2021 WL 2690268, at *7 (U.S. July 1, 2021).  \nThe caselaw on this subject could not be clearer in declaring the extreme constitutional \ndisfavor afforded to laws requiring individuals to voice support for ideological viewpoints that \nthey do not believe. For example, the Sixth Circuit has recognized that โcompelling an individual \nโto utter what is not in [her] mindโ and indeed what she might find deeply offensiveโ is โthe most \naggressive form of viewpoint discrimination.โ Ward v. Polite, 667 F.3d 727, 733 (6th Cir. 2012). \nParticularly repugnant to the First Amendment is when the government forces a private party to \n27 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 27 of 40 PageID #: 1157\n\nvoice the governmentโs compelled message, not merely in private or in direct dealings with \ngovernment itself, but โin public,โ as an involuntary โinstrument for fostering public adherence \nto  an  ideological  point  of  view.โ  Wooley,  430  U.S.  at  715.  The  Supreme  Court  has  even \nsuggested that โsuch compulsion so plainly violates the Constitutionโ that it is rare for the courts \nto even have to step in to enforce the prohibition against it. Janus, 138 S. Ct. at 2464. When the \ngovernment  does  attempt  such  a  step,  however,  the  caselaw  is  clear  that  โ[c]ompelling \nindividuals to mouth support for views they find objectionable violates [a] cardinal constitutional \ncommand,โ unless justified by the strongest of rationales. Id. at 2463. \nThere can be no serious dispute that the Act involves compelled speech. The required \nsignage must be posted on a business ownerโs premises. It is directed at the businessโs customers \nand purports to describe the businessโs own policy. The business owner is responsible for \nprocuring the sign, adhering to the mandated design, and making sure it remains hanging and \nvisible. In other words, while the message of the sign is one selected by the Tennessee General \nAssembly, the speaker is the business or other establishment subject to the Act. See Shurtleff, \n2022  WL  1295700,  at  *5  (discussing  distinction  between  government  speech  and  private \nspeech).  \nIt is similarly beyond reasonable dispute that the plaintiffs object to the message required. \nโThe First Amendment mandates that [courts] presume that speakers, not the government, know \nbest both what they want to say and how to say it.โ Riley v. Natโl Fedโn of the Blind of N. \nCarolina, Inc., 487 U.S. 781, 790โ91 (1988) (citing Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479 \nU.S. 208, 224 (1987)). There is no evidence that Bernstein or anyone else has lied about finding \nthe  signs  objectionable.  The  plaintiffs,  moreover,  have  provided  a  methodically  detailed, \ncoherent explanation for why they find the message of the signs objectionable. The defendantsโ \n28 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 28 of 40 PageID #: 1158\n\nonly response has been to state that they do not find the signs objectionable and do not think \nother people should either. That, though, is beside the point. The relevant constitutional question \nis not whether the plaintiffs should object to the signs on moral, political, or ideological grounds. \nThe Constitution says nothing about how any private party should feel about anything. The \nrelevant constitutional question is whether the Act compels the plaintiffs to voice a message to \nwhich they earnestly object, based upon their disagreement with its content. The undisputed \nevidence shows that it does. \n2. The Mandated Signage is Neither โPurely Factualโ Nor Commercial. Although \nthe defendants passingly assert that the Act was โnarrowly tailoredโ to serve a โcompelling \ninterest,โ they do not ultimately stake their defense of the Act on its surviving strict scrutiny. \n(Doc. No. 39 at 16.) As the court noted in its earlier opinion and will discuss again later in this \none, that is a wise decision; there is no serious argument that this law could meet that demanding \nstandard. (See Doc. No. 22 at 18โ19.) Rather, the defendants argue that the Act is constitutional \npursuant to an exception to the usual rule that strict scrutiny applies to laws mandating speech of \na particular message. Specifically, the Supreme Court has recognized that a less demanding level \nof scrutiny applies to laws that merely compel commercial actors to disclose โpurely factual and \nuncontroversial information about the terms under which [their] services will be available.โ \nZauderer, 471 U.S. at 651. The defendants suggest that the Act is such a law. \nThe  exception  allowing  greater  leeway  for  compelled  statements  of  true  facts  in  a \ncommercial setting plays an important role in First Amendment law, particularly with regard to \nthe  governmentโs  ability  to  foster  transparency  and  accuracy  in  the  interest  of  protecting \nconsumers. That exception, for example, allows the government to require truthful warning \nlabels on dangerous products, Disc. Tobacco City & Lottery, Inc, 674 F.3d at 527, and to require \n29 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 29 of 40 PageID #: 1159\n\ncertain businesses to disclose their fee structures to prevent hidden costs, Zauderer, 471 U.S. at \n653. The Act, however, is a poor fit to that model of permissible regulation. For one thing, the \nAct applies to any โpublic or private entity or business that operates a building or facility open to \nthe general public,โ regardless of the commercial nature of the facility involved. Act ยง 1(a). The \nAct, accordingly, is untethered to any particular commercial transaction. Moreover, even when \nthe facility at issue is commercial in nature, like Bongoโs are, the matters governed by the Act \nare, at best, tangentially related to the relevant commercial activity. Public restrooms exist for the \nconvenience of a businessโs customers, not as the businessโs actual product. A restaurant sells \nfood, not access to plumbing. Accordingly, even when the Act is applied in a commercial setting, \nthe speech involved is not itself commercial in nature, at least not as that term has been used by \nthe Supreme Court. See NIFLA, 138 S. Ct. at 2372 (holding that commercial speech standard did \nnot apply to law requiring disclosure that โin no way relate[d] to the services that [the regulated \nbusinesses] provide[d]โ). \nThe even greater problem for the Act, however, is that the content of the required signage \nis  not  โpurely  factual.โ  It  is  not  difficult  to  imagine  a  law  that  did require  purely  factual \ndisclosure of facilitiesโ restroom policies. Such a law could, for example, simply require every \nqualifying facility to fully and accurately disclose its policies in language of its choosing. \nWhether that approach might ultimately salvage the constitutionality of the Act is not before the \ncourt, but it would, at the very least, be closer to the kind of factual transparency law typically \nupheld. The Act, however, does not simply require a facility to accurately disclose its policies; it \nrequires  the  facility  to  voice  the  governmentโs  characterization  of  those  policies.  That \ncharacterization,  moreover,  is  not  itself  simply  some  neutral,  non-ideological  statement. \n30 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 30 of 40 PageID #: 1160\n\nEmbedded in the language required by the Act are normative premises that, whether or not a \nperson agrees with them, simply cannot plausibly be characterized as factual in nature. \nFirst, it is not an assertion of fact that a facility with a trans-inclusive restroom policy \nnecessarily allows individuals to use a restroom โregardless of the designation of the restroom.โ \nAs the court has already noted, most restrooms do not expressly endorse any particular paradigm \nof thinking about sex or gender; they just say whether the restroom is for โMenโ or โWomenโ \nwithout elaborating further. Accordingly, a restroom designated as for โMenโ could be construed \nin at least two ways, depending on oneโs underlying assumptions. It could be interpreted as for \nboth transgender and cisgender men, as the plaintiffs would suggest, or it could be construed as \nonly for individuals who meet the defendantsโ preferred definition of โmen,โ which relies on \nobserved biology at birth. Only the latter of those two interpretations, however, would suggest \nthat, when a transgender man uses a menโs room, he does so โregardless ofโ its designation. The \nunderlying disagreement is not one of fact; rather, it occurs on the shifting and continuously up-\nfor-grabs level of language and norms. The warning mandated by the Act requires the plaintiffs \nto adopt and, by extension, endorse the governmentโs preferred but unambiguously contested \nview of how gender works. It therefore goes far beyond merely requiring a purely factual \ndisclosure. \nThe same issue arises out of the fact that the plaintiffs would be required to use the \nphrase โeither biological sex.โ The evidence in this case plainly establishes that the question of \nwhether  humans  should  be  organized  into  two  binary  and  all-inclusive  โbiological  sexesโ \ninvolves contested ideological premises, not merely a statement of fact. The fact that the Act \noffers no alternative to using that phrase means that the Act requires a regulated establishment to \ntake a position on those contested issues that may be against its will. \n31 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 31 of 40 PageID #: 1161\n\nIndeed, insofar as the required signage does address questions of fact, it is, if anything, \npotentially misleading, or at least confusing, in relation to its own purpose. Despite the fact that \nthe  Act  was,  according  to  its  own  legislative  history,  plainly  and  expressly  directed  at \nestablishments  with  trans-inclusive,  but  gender-segregated,  restroom  policies,  the  required \nsignage does not actually describe such a policy. Rather, the clear implication of the required \nsignage is that the regulated establishment permits any person to use any restroomโdespite the \nfact that that is not actually what a trans-inclusive policy would necessarily entail. A business \ncan allow a transgender man to use a menโs restroom without opening that restroom to everyone. \nThe  Act,  however,  requires  establishments  that  employ  gender-segregatedโbut  trans-\ninclusiveโrestrooms to post signage that plainly obfuscates that fact. The Act, in other words, \ndoes not actually require businesses with trans-inclusive policies to accurately disclose their own \npolicies; rather, it forces them to endorse an inaccurate version of those policies that does not \nappear  to  exist  much  of  anywhere  outside  of  the  imaginations  of  people  who  oppose  the \nrecognition of transgender identities altogether. \nA list of ingredients is a statement of fact. A warning that smoking causes cancer is a \nstatement of fact. A disclosure that the ostensible price of a service will be supplemented by a \nsubstantial transaction fee is a statement of fact. And a neutral description of who is permitted to \nuse a restroom would be a statement of fact, even if a potentially unnecessary one. But the Act, \nby requiring private parties to speak as if they agree with contestable ideological premises that \nthey in fact find highly objectionable, ventures far beyond the realm of pure facts, into the zone \nof values and judgments. Individualsโincluding public officialsโare of course permitted to \nadopt whatever values and judgments they ultimately prefer. The bar for forcing a person to echo \nsomeone elseโs values and judgments, however, is high, and it cannot be lowered by comparing \n32 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 32 of 40 PageID #: 1162\n\nthe Act to factual disclosure obligations that are plainly inapposite. Strict scrutiny, therefore, \napplies. \n3. The Mandated Signage Expresses a Controversial Message. Finally, insofar as the \nquestion of whether the required signage is purely factual is not determinative of the standard of \nreview, the court holds that the plaintiffs have established that strict scrutiny applies because the \nunderlying message is unambiguously controversial. The Supreme Court has recognized that, \neven if a regulation nominally requires only factual disclosures, the government can still wield \nthat regulation in a way that improperly privileges one highly contestable viewpoint over another \nin violation of the First Amendment. In NIFLA v. Becerra, the Supreme Court considered a \nCalifornia law requiring facilities offering reproductive health-related services, including โcrisis \npregnancy centers,โ to โdisseminate a government-drafted notice on site.โ 138 S. Ct. at 2369. \nThe notice was purely factual, informing the recipient that โCalifornia has public programs that \nprovide immediate free or low-cost access to comprehensive family planning services (including \nall FDA-approved methods of contraception), prenatal care, and abortion for eligible women.โ \nId. The Supreme Court nevertheless held that the law violated the First Amendment because it, \nin effect, โco-opt[ed] the [regulated] facilities to deliver its messageโ on the highly controversial \ntopics of contraception and abortion. Id. at 2376. That holding, moreover, did not depend on the \nunderlying statuteโs requiring anyone to expressly endorse or decry abortion or contraception; it \ndid no such thing. Rather, the Supreme Court recognized that, even if the required notices were \ntechnically factual in nature, their function and context made it inappropriate to judge them \npursuant to a standard designed for โhealth and safety warnings long considered permissible, or \npurely factual and uncontroversial disclosures about commercial products.โ Id. at 2376. \n33 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 33 of 40 PageID #: 1163\n\nThe plaintiffs have offered overwhelming evidence confirming the controversial nature of \nthese issues. Dr. Taylorโs report and the sources on which he relies illustrate the struggles that \ntransgender  individuals  have  faced  in  American  society,  as  do  Bernsteinโs  account  of  the \nexperiences  of  his  own  employees  and  customers.  The  legislative  history  of  the  Act  itself \nprovides a number of examples of the kind of fear and derision that transgender individuals face. \nAnd, as is always the case, this court is permitted to โjudicially notice [facts] that [are] not \nsubject  to  reasonable  disputeโ  and  โgenerally  known  within  the  .  .  .  courtโs  territorial \njurisdiction.โ F. R. Evid. 201(b). The ongoing controversies surrounding gender identity in \nAmerica are there for anyone to see, and the court is not required to ignore that fact. See Janus, \n138 S. Ct. at 2476 (recognizing controversial nature of issues surrounding gender identity). In \nfact, the defendants themselves concede that the plaintiffsโ understanding of the concept of \ngender identity has been โpopularizedโ through a process of considering the nature of sex and \ngender stretching back until at least โthe 1950s.โ (Doc. No. 40 ยถ 63.) Such a characterization is \nincompatible with the contention that the Act only bears on settled issues of fact. \nIt bears noting, moreover, that there is a well-established recent history of controversy, \nnot merely around gender identity generally, but specifically surrounding the issue of how \ngender identity relates to public restrooms. Indeed, the โmessage that gender identity protections \ncreate peril in bathroomsโ is so commonplace that it even has a colloquial name: the โbathroom \nargument.โ Marie-Amรฉlie George, Framing Trans Rights, 114 Nw. U. L. Rev. 555, 581 (2019). \nThe practice of directing discussions of transgender identity back to an exaggerated specter of \ndanger in public restrooms has been ongoing for over a decade and has surfaced across states and \nregions. See id. at 581โ83. The plaintiffs find themselves on one side of this argument, with the \ndefendants apparently on the other. The issue in this context is not who is right. Rather, what \n34 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 34 of 40 PageID #: 1164\n\nmatters under the Supreme Courtโs caselaw is the fact that the controversy exists, that it is hard-\nfought and substantial, that it is ideological in nature, and that it would be incompatible with the \nFirst Amendment to force a person on any one side of that disagreement to endorse the opposing \nposition. \nThe defendants focus a substantial amount of their briefing on this point to arguing that \nthe phrase โbiological sexโ is not inherently controversial. But the Act does not require the \nplaintiffs to simply utter the phrase โbiological sexโ into the wind. It requires them to post a \nspecific  statement,  formatted  in  a  specific  way,  in  a  specific  context.  And  the  potentially \ncontroversial nature of the mandated signs must be judged in that context, because that is how \ncommunication works. The phrase โItโs green!โ serves a different purpose and conveys different \ninformation whether the speaker is at a stoplight, shopping for a sweater, or trying to identify a \nsnake in her garden. For the same reason, a law mandating a โKEEP OUTโ sign at the entrance \nof an abandoned mine would pose a far different constitutional question than a law mandating \nthe same sign at a church or a bookstore. The fact that context matters to the meaning of a \nstatement is, to put it bluntly, so obviously true that it should not require pointing out. \nThere is, moreover, no formalistic legal rule that would require a court to ignore the role \nof context in understanding a message. To the contrary, the Supreme Courtโs First Amendment \ncaselaw is rife with close readings of context. For example, in the recent opinion of Shurtleff v. \nCity of Bos., Massachusetts, the Supreme Court devoted several paragraphs to exploring the \nways in which โ[n]ot just the content of a flag, but also its presence and position have long \nconveyed important messages about government.โ12 Shurtleff, 2022 WL 1295700, at *5. The \nSupreme Court has similarly recognized that compelling a student to salute the flag, in context, \n \n12 For example, โ[a] foreign flag outside Blair House, across the street from the White House, signals that \na foreign leader is visiting,โ whereas the same flag in a different context would convey no such thing. \nShurtleff, 2022 WL 1295700, at *5. \n35 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 35 of 40 PageID #: 1165\n\nsends a message about โnationalismโ and โnational unityโ that โis likely to include what some \ndisapprove or to omit what others think essential.โ W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 \nU.S. 624, 634 (1943). And the Sixth Circuit has recognized that the phrase โChoose Life,โ in \ncontext, refers to the controversial issue of abortion. ACLU of Tenn. v. Bredesen, 441 F.3d 370, \n379 (6th Cir. 2006). It would be a foolish judiciary indeed that artificially rendered itself unable \nto acknowledge these obvious facts. Context matters, both in real life and under the Constitution. \nThe  defendants  therefore  do  themselves  no  favors  by  couching  their  arguments  so \naggressively in terms of whether the free-floating phrase โbiological sexโ is โcontroversialโ in \nsome  abstract  sense.  Whether  any  particular  mandated  message  is  controversial  must  be \nascertained by considering that message in the context of the society and setting in which the \nmessage is being required. Are the signs mandated by the Act controversial? Maybe not in a \nhypothetical world where everyone thought like the Actโs authors. But in the actual world we \nlive in, there  are people who would  welcome the signs and people  who would find them \nrepellant. That is the very definition of a controversy.  \nUltimately, the best way to determine whether a topic is a controversial matter of public \nconcern is simply to observe whether members of the public and other relevant actors โdisagree \nsharply aboutโ it. Janus, 138 S. Ct. at 2475. In this instance, the evidence overwhelmingly \nmandates a conclusion that people do, in fact, genuinely and sharply disagree about the topic \naddressed and characterized, in a non-neutral fashion, by the signs required by the Act. The Act, \ntherefore, requires the plaintiffs to endorse a position they do not wish to endorse and falls well \nwithin the boundaries of laws subject to strict scrutiny. \n4. The Act Fails Strict Scrutiny. Because the Act is subject to strict scrutiny, it must be \nnarrowly tailored to further a compelling government interest, or else it violates and must be \n36 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 36 of 40 PageID #: 1166\n\nsuperseded by the First Amendment. Although at least one key supporter of the Act in the \nGeneral Assembly justified its requirements in relation to supposed risks of sexual assault and \nrape, there is (1) no evidence, in either the legislative record or the record of this case, that there \nis any significant problem of individualsโ abusing trans-inclusive restroom policies for that \npurpose and (2) no reason to think that, if such a problem existed, the mandated signs would \naddress it. Indeed, the defendants do not even attempt to argue that such fears are well-founded, \nlet alone compelling. See Janus, 138 S. Ct. at 2465 (holding that, even assuming a compelling \npurpose, the law at issue would fail judicial review because there was โno evidence that the \npandemonium . . . imagined would result if [the law] were not allowedโ). \nInstead, the defendants argue that the Act furthers Tennesseeโs โcompelling interest in \nensuring that patrons are informed of the bathroom-use policy at businesses they frequent.โ \n(Doc. No. 39 at 16.) The defendants do not offer any meaningful evidence that would establish \nthe โcompellingโ nature of such an interest, resting instead on their claim that that interest is \nโreadily apparent.โ (Id.) That is debatable, to say the least, and the Supreme Court has frowned \nupon similar vague appeals to โcommon senseโ to overcome โevidentiary shortcomingsโ of the \ngovernmentโs stated rationale for a law restricting speech. FEC v. Cruz, No. 21-12, 2022 WL \n1528348, at *12 (U.S. May 16, 2022). In any event, even if the interest that the defendants have \nidentified is compelling, the Act does not even come close to satisfying the narrow tailoring \nrequirement, as it is replete with provisions that could be narrower or even wholly omitted in \nfavor of a less coercive and stigmatic alternative. The Act could, for example, merely require all \nbusinesses to disclose their policies upon request. It could permit businesses to choose their own \nfactually accurate language for describing their policies. It could, at the very least, permit a \nbusiness to design its signage without a cartoonishly alarmist color scheme. Whether or not those \n37 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 37 of 40 PageID #: 1167\n\nalternatives would be constitutional, they would certainly be far more narrowly tailored than the \nAct is now. There is, moreover, no reason to think that such alternatives would be less effective \nthan the Act. The Act therefore fails strict scrutiny and cannot be constitutionally enforced. \n5. The Act is Questionable Even Under Rational Basis Review. Finally, the plaintiffs \nargue that, even if the Act were held to be subject to the most deferential standard of review \npossibleโrational basis reviewโit would still fail. โUnder rational basis review, a law is upheld \nso  long  as  it  is  rationally  related  to  a  legitimate  government  purpose.  There  is  a  strong \npresumption  of  constitutionality  and  the  regulation  will  be  upheld  so  long  as  its  goal  is \npermissible and the means by which it is designed to achieve that goal are rational.โ Liberty \nCoins, LLC v. Goodman, 748 F.3d 682, 694 (6th Cir. 2014) (citing Natโl Assโn for Advancement \nof Psychoanalysis v. Cal. Bd. of Psych., 228 F.3d 1043, 1050 (9th Cir. 2000)). The Supreme \nCourt has made clear, however, that, โeven in the ordinary . . . case calling for the most \ndeferential of standards,โ a law may be struck down if its substance is โso discontinuous with the \nreasons offered for itโ that any pretense of rationality cannot be sustained. Romer v. Evans, 517 \nU.S.  620,  632  (1996).  That  review  includes  considering  whether,  โin  practical  effect,  the \nchallenged [provision] simply does not operate so as rationally to furtherโ the legitimate purpose \nprofessed. U.S. Depโt of Agric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 537 (1973).   \nAs the Supreme Court has recognized, applying rational basis review with at least some \nteeth is particularly appropriate when necessary to constrain the government from improperly \nsingling out and punishing a โpolitically unpopular groupโ that, though vulnerable, has never \nbeen recognized by the Supreme Courtโs jurisprudence as a suspect class. Trump v. Hawaii, 138 \nS. Ct. 2392, 2420 (2018) (citing Moreno, 413 U.S. at 534). Rational basis review has, for \nexample,  been  used  to  invalidate  laws  unfairly  and  irrationally  targeting  the  intellectually \n38 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 38 of 40 PageID #: 1168\n\ndisabled, City of Cleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 448 (1985), people forced \nby poverty to live in group housing arrangements, Moreno, 413 U.S. at 537โ38, and, perhaps \nmost prominently in recent years, gays and lesbians, Romer, 517 U.S. at 635. The court sees little \nreason to doubt that a law addressing transgender people would raise similar red flags, even \nunder rational basis review. \nThat said, the court ultimately declines to issue what would, in essence, be an advisory \nopinion regarding whether the Act would survive rational basis review, because that is simply \nnot the standard that applies. It would do a disservice to the First Amendment to judge the Act \nfor anything other than what it is: a brazen attempt to single out trans-inclusive establishments \nand  force  them  to  parrot  a  message  that  they  reasonably  believe  would  sow  fear  and \nmisunderstanding about the very transgender Tennesseans whom those establishments are trying \nto provide with some semblance of a safe and welcoming environment.  The Act fails the \nconstitutional standard that actually applies to it, and the inquiry should end there. \nThe plaintiffs have explained, in detail and with evidence, why they do not wish to echo \nthe governmentโs preferred characterization of their trans-inclusive policies. In response, the \ndefendants, rather than taking those objections seriously, have suggested that the plaintiffs have \nmerely โimagined an idiosyncratic, hidden undertone to the [required] signage,โ which in reality \nrequires only โa simple truthful statement of fact . . . aimed at informing the public.โ (Doc. No. \n39 at 12.) The only thing that is imaginary in this case, though, is the imagined consensus on \nissues of sex and gender on which the defendants seek to rely. Transgender Tennesseans are real. \nThe businesses and establishments that wish to welcome them are real. And the viewpoints that \nthose individuals and businesses hold are real, even if they differ from the views of some \nlegislators or government officials. While those government officials have considerable power, \n39 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 42   Filed 05/17/22   Page 39 of 40 PageID #: 1169\n\nthey have no authority to wish those opposing viewpoints away. The plaintiffs, accordingly, are \nentitled to summary judgment. \nV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the plaintiffsโ Motion for Motion for Summary Judgment \n(Doc. No. 35) will be granted. \nAn appropriate order will enter. \n \n              ______________________________ \n                ALETA A.

R. Civ. P. 56 and Local Rule 56.1, Plaintiffs Bongo Productions, Inc. \nand Robert Bernstein move for summary judgment on all counts to be entered against \nDefendants, Carter Lawrence, in his official capacity as Tennessee State Fire Marshall; \nChristopher Bainbridge, in his official capacity as Director of Codes Enforcement; Glenn R. \nFunk, in his official capacity as District Attorney General for the 20th Judicial District; and Neal \nPinkston, in his official capacity as District Attorney General for the 11th district.  \nIn support of their Motion, Plaintiffs contemporaneously file a memorandum of law, \nstatement of undisputed facts, and declaration of Malita Picasso, counsel for Plaintiffs, with \nexhibits. Plaintiffs state in support of their Motion as follows:  \n1.  Plaintiffs are Tennessee businesses and service providers with formal or informal \npolicies allowing their transgender employees, customers, or clients to use the public \nrestrooms that accord with their identity. \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 35   Filed 01/31/22   Page 1 of 5 PageID #: 273\n\n2.  Tennessee Code Annotated ยง 68-120-120 (โthe Actโ) forces Plaintiffsโ businesses to \npost a warning sign. The sign must appear with large red and yellow โNOTICEโ text \nat the top, and boldface black block letters on a white background stating that โTHIS \nFACILITY MAINTAINS A POLICY OF ALLOWING THE USE OF \nRESTROOMS BY EITHER BIOLOGICAL SEX, REGARDLESS OF THE \nDESIGNATION ON THE RESTROOM.โ \n3.  Under the Act, โ[i]f any entity or business is notified that it is not in compliance with \nthis section, the entity or business has thirty (30) days in which to comply before any \naction is taken against the entity or business.โ Tenn. Code Ann. ยง68-120-120(c).  \n4.  If Plaintiffs do not erect the Actโs required notice after notification that they are not in \ncompliance, they face up to six months imprisonment and/or a fine of up to $500, as \nwell as other enforcement actions or civil penalties under Title 68, Chapter 120.  \n5.  The legislatureโs viewpoint about sex, as expressed in the Act, is controversial and \noffensive.  \na.  โBiological sexโ is a highly controversial term regularly used by those who \noppose and seek to restrict and eliminate the legal recognition and protection \nof transgender people. Plaintiffs have demonstrated that its uses within the \nfields of science and medicine reflect differing and inconsistent \ninterpretations. \nb.  The Actโs legislative history also belies the fact that the Act was intended to \nstigmatize transgender people and target businesses that permit transgender \npeople to use the bathroom that accords with their gender identity.  \n2 \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 35   Filed 01/31/22   Page 2 of 5 PageID #: 274\n\n6.  The Actโs compelled message creates confusion and presents fundamental problems \nof enforceability.   \na.  As worded, the Actโs message implies that anyone could use Plaintiffsโ sex-\ndesignated restroomsโthe very โissueโ the Act purports to address.  \nb.  Moreover, Plaintiffs have no way to verify anyoneโs โbiological sex,โ nor do \nthey wish to undertake the type of invasion into their customersโ, employeesโ \nor clientsโ privacy that is inherent to such a task.  \n7.  Defendants have not advanced a compelling interest in requiring Plaintiffs to post the \nActโs required message, nor have Defendants shown that the Act is narrowly tailored \nto further that interest.   \na.  Defendants have failed to provide evidence that allowing transgender people \nto use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity impedes the level of \nprivacy, comfort, and safety that a patron would otherwise expect.  \nb.  As stated above, the Actโs message implies that anyone could use Plaintiffsโ \nsex-designated restroomsโthe very โissueโ the Act purports to address.  \n8.  Moreover, the Act does not even bear a rational relationship to a legitimate \ngovernment purpose.  \na.  The Act only requires disclosure of certain bathroom policies: those the \nlegislature does not agree with. All other entities do not have to disclose their \nbathroom policies to their patrons.  \nb.  Defendants have failed to show that the requirement of the use of red and \nyellow โNOTICEโ text and boldface, black block lettersโclearly meant to \nalarm the viewerโrationally furthers its interest.  \n3 \nCase 3:21-cv-00490   Document 35   Filed 01/31/22   Page 3 of 5 PageID #: 275\n\n9.  Based on the undisputed facts, the Act violates Plaintiffsโ First Amendment rights and \nsummary judgment is appropriate as a matter of law.  \nAccordingly, based on the undisputed facts, the Plaintiffs respectfully ask this Court to \ngrant summary judgment in the Plaintiffsโ favor on all counts and to enter the following relief: \n(1) a permanent injunction, restraining Defendants, their employees, agents and successors in \noffice from enforcing the Act; (2) a judgment declaring that the Act is unconstitutional under the \nFirst Amendment to the United States Constitution; and (3) a judgment awarding Plaintiffs their \nreasonable costs and attorneyโs fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988. \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/ Stella Yarbrough    \nStella Yarbrough (No. 33637) \nThomas H.
