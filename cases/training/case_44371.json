    "summary": "<p>This case is about a new policy implemented in 2019 by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) to exclude Catholic charities from serving in the foster system unless they affirmatively recommend same-sex couples as foster and adoptive parents. In January 2017, two same sex couples had filed lawsuits against DHHS and CSA to prohibit agencies from contracting with faith-based providers who don&rsquo;t recommend or license same-sex couples as foster and adoptive parents. See <a href=\"../../../../case/16166/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Dumont v. Lyon</em></a>, No. 2:17-cv-13080-PDB-EAS (E.D. Mich. 2017). In March 2019, parties to Dumont entered into a settlement agreement which required MDHHS to maintain a nondiscrimination provision in its foster care and adoption agency contracts &ldquo;[u]nless prohibited by law or court order.&rdquo; See Notice of Removal, Exhibit A, 25. Several cases were filed by faith-based providers of foster and adoptive services, including this one.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A month after the settlement in <em>Dumont</em>, on April 24, 2019, Catholic Charities of West Michigan filed a complaint against MDHHS, seeking declaratory judgment and injunctive relief in Michigan state court to ensure MIHHS &ldquo;correctly interpret and comply&rdquo; with state statutes and prevent MDHHS from enforcing the new policy. Notice of Removal, Exhibit A (Case No. 19-000072-MM). The claims were brought under state law and 42 USC 1983. Catholic Charities of West Michigan challenged the defendants&rsquo; new policy as violating Michigan statutes guaranteeing faith-based providers cannot be compelled to provide services that conflict with their &ldquo;sincerely held religious beliefs.&rdquo; Mich. Comp. Laws ss 77.124e(2), 722.124f(1). District Judge Denise Page Hood was assigned the case.</p>\r\n<p>Several days before the plaintiffs in this case filed their complaint, a separate religious Michigan foster care agency had also filed a complaint on similar facts and issues. See <a href=\"../../../../case/17302/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buck v. Gordon.&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n<p>On June 5, the plaintiffs filed a notice of removal to federal court, citing constitutional claims under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as federal and state laws. Plaintiffs filed a motion to change venue on June 19, and a week later, a motion for preliminary injunction to enjoin the defendants from enforcing the policy against the plaintiff. The court set a date to hear arguments on both motions on August 7, 2019 (later moved to August 21). In <em>Buck v. Gordon</em>, plaintiffs had already filed a motion for preliminary injunction the month earlier.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On the same day, the plaintiffs in <em>Dumont</em> moved to intervene to enforce their settlement. Two months later, on July 17, 2019, the Dumont plaintiffs also moved to intervene to preserve their settlement.</p>\r\n<p>On August 21, the Court cancelled the hearing on the motions, and filed a notice of determination on them without oral argument. Before the court in this case made a finding on the pending motions, a month later, the court granted the plaintiffs in <em>Buck v. Gordon </em>their motion for preliminary injunction, which prevented the defendants from suspending the <em>Buck</em> plaintiffs contracts. MDHHS appealed and on October 10, filed a motion to stay the <em>Buck</em> injunction. A day later, on October 11, MDHHS notified the court in this case of their appeal in <em>Buck</em>. In October and November, the trial and appellate courts in <em>Buck</em> denied MDHHS&rsquo;s motions for stays, which the court in this case was notified of. On January 16, 2020, the plaintiffs notified the court in this case that MDHHS had filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss their appeal of the preliminary injunction in <em>Buck</em>. On February 20, the defendants filed a motion to expedite judgment on the motion for preliminary injunction. Defendants also asked the court to certify to the Michigan Supreme Court the question of proper interpretation of relevant state laws, specifically whether the state laws &ldquo;authorizes a child placing agency &hellip; to refuse to provide state-supervised children with contracted services that conflict with the CPA&rsquo;s sincerely held religious beliefs.&rdquo; The next week, the court set a date for a hearing on the motion for April 8.</p>\r\n<p>A month before the initial hearing date, plaintiffs in <em>Buck</em> filed a motion to stay their case pending the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in <em>Fulton v. City of Philadelphia</em>, which the <em>Buck</em> court granted in May. The court in this case also pushed back the hearing on the motion to expedite to July 9, 2020. After the hearing, but before the court ruled on the motion, defendants filed another response to the plaintiffs motion of supplemental authority for the preliminary motion on August 4. In their response, defendants addressed the relevance of the Second Circuit&rsquo;s July holding in <em>New Hope Family Services, inc. v. Poole</em>, another case involving a faith-based adoption agency in which MDHHS had filed and subsequently appealed the ruling on a motion to dismiss.</p>\r\n<p>In mid-June 2021, the plaintiffs notified the court of the U.S. Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in <em>Fulton</em>, which determined that refusal to contract with a religious organization for foster care services unless the organization agrees to certify same-sex couples as foster parents violated the Free Exercise Clause.</p>\r\n<p>The court granted the parties&rsquo; stipulated order and stayed the case on November 8, 2021, while parties attempted to settle outside litigation.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, following negotiations, the court signed the parties stipulation and order resolving all claims on March 21, 2022. In the order, MDHHS maintained discretion to approve plaintiff&rsquo;s request to return the referral of a foster child previously placed by the plaintiffs when in the best interests of the child. Parties also agreed that the plaintiff would likely prevail on their Free Exercise claim, and agreed to enter judgment against the defendant. The order required MDHHS to not take any action against the plaintiff&rsquo;s license, or terminate or not renew their contracts due to their religious beliefs. In response, plaintiff also agreed to voluntarily dismiss all claims with prejudice, except for the stipulated judgment on Free Exercise. Performance was the sole remedy of the case, and no damages were included. On the same day, the Court entered the judgment. This case is now closed.</p>",

    "summary_short": "Following the Eastern district of Michigan's judgment in Dumont v. Lyon, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) admended their policy to exclude Catholic charities from serving in the foster system unless they agreed to recommend same-sex couples as foster and adoptive parents. Catholic Charities filed a complaint against MDHHS seeking declaratory judgment interpreting state statutes, and injunctive relief to prevent MDHHS from enforcing the new policy. Plaintiffs filed their complaint under USC 1983, alleging violations of state law and the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The case was initially filed in state court in April 2019. Plaintiffs subsequently moved to remove the case to the federal Eastern District of Michigan, and filed a motion for preliminary injunction. While the court considered the motions, several concurrent cases had judgments on similar issues, notices of which the plaintiffs filed with the court over the course of several months. \r\nThe court granted the parties’ stipulated order and stayed the case on November 8, 2021, while parties attempted to settle outside litigation. Finally, following negotiations, the court signed the parties stipulation and order resolving all claims on March 21, 2022. In the order, MDHHS maintained discretion to approve plaintiff’s request to return the referral of a foster child previously placed by the plaintiffs when in the best interests of the child.

P. 25(d) the current Children’s Services \nAgency Executive Director JooYeun Chang is substituted for Acting \nChildren’s Services Agency Executive Director Jennifer Wrayno, who \nwas named in her official capacity.   \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 06/05/19    PageID.3    Page 3 of 11\nCase No. 19-000072-MM, from the Michigan Court of Claims to the \nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1441(a) and 1446.  The grounds for removal \nare as follows:  \n1.  This Notice of Removal is timely filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1446(b)(1) because it was filed within 30 days after receipt of the \ncomplaint by any DHHS Defendant, and Defendant Nessel consents to \nremoval pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1446(b)(2)(C).     \n2.  Defendant Dana Nessel was served on May 9, 2019; \nhowever, the Attorney General’s Office received a courtesy copy of the \ncomplaint from the Michigan Court of Claims on-or-around May 2, \n2019.  Defendants DHHS and DHHS Director Robert Gordon were \nserved with the complaint on May 9, 2019.  Defendants CSA and \nJennifer Wrayno, as CSA’s then-Acting Executive Director, were served \nvia email, at Plaintiff’s counsel’s request, on May 15, 2019.   \n3.  A true-and-correct copy of the summons and complaint is \nattached as Exhibit A. \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 06/05/19    PageID.4    Page 4 of 11\n4.  On May 15, 2019, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction2, with supporting Brief and Affidavit, a copy of which are \nattached as Exhibit B. \n5.  On May 24, 2019, the parties filed a Proposed Stipulated \nOrder Extending Deadlines, setting June 28, 2019 as the deadline for \nDefendants to respond to the complaint and to the Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction filed in the Michigan Court of Claims.  A copy of \nthis proposed order is attached as Exhibit C.   \n6.  Removal is warranted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a) \nbecause the complaint constitutes a civil action with several counts \narising under the Constitution of the United States.  28 U.S.C. § 1331.  \nSpecifically, Plaintiff Catholic Charities claims that DHHS’s purported \n“new policy” announced via a directive issued by the DHHS Defendants \nin April 2019, violates Plaintiff’s rights under the First and Fourteenth \n                                                 \n2 Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1446(a), this Notice includes “a copy of all \nprocess, pleadings, and orders served upon … defendants” in the state \ncourt action.  Plaintiff’s Motion for a Preliminary Injunction with \nsupporting Brief and other documents is included herewith for sake of \ncompleteness.   The state court case can proceed no further.  28 U.S.C. § \n1446(d)   If Plaintiff desires to proceed with this motion after removal, \nDefendants assume it will file the motion anew in accordance with Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 65.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 06/05/19    PageID.5    Page 5 of 11\nAmendment to the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, as well \nas other federal and state laws. (Ex. A,  Compl., ¶¶ 10, 131, 196-226.)  \nFederal court is the appropriate forum for this dispute.   \n7.  Moreover, the United States District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Michigan is the appropriate venue.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1441(a), a civil action may be removed “to the district court of the \nUnited States for the district and the division embracing the place \nwhere such action is pending.”  This case is currently pending before the \nMichigan Court of Claims.  The Court of Claims “sit[s] in the court of \nappeals district where a court of appeals judge serving as a judge of the \ncourt of claims sits, unless otherwise determined by the chief judge of \nthe court of claims.”  Mich. Comp. Laws § 600.6413 (LexisNexis 2019).  \nThe Honorable Judge Cynthia Stephens is the court of appeals judge \nassigned to this matter, and she sits in Michigan Court of Appeals \nDistrict 1 which is located in Detroit, Michigan.  See Mich. Court of \nClaims Home Page, Court of Claims Judges, \nhttps://courts.michigan.gov/courts/coc/pages/default.aspx; see also Mich. \nCourt of Appeals Office and Courtroom Locations, District 1, \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 06/05/19    PageID.6    Page 6 of 11\nhttps://courts.michigan.gov/Courts/COA/clerksoffice/Pages/Locations.as\npx.  \n8.  Not only does this Court have original jurisdiction over the \nfederal claims, but this Court’s supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 1367(a) encompasses the state law claims.  Such claims are \nso related to Plaintiff’s federal constitutional claims that “they form \npart of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United \nStates Constitution.”  28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).    \n9.  Specifically, the  “case or controversy” at issue here is a \ncollateral challenge to a Settlement Agreement executed by the \nplaintiffs and DHHS Defendants in Dumont v. Gordon, et al., No. 17-cv-\n13080 (E.D. Mich. 2018).  Per Order dated March 22, 2019, Judge \nBorman dismissed Dumont with prejudice pursuant to the terms of the \nSettlement Agreement while expressly “retain[ing] jurisdiction over the \nenforcement of the Settlement Agreement in [Dumont].” (“Dumont \nConsent Decree”) (Dumont, No. 2:17-cv-13808, Doc. 83, Page ID ## \n1468-69.) Page ID # 1468).   \n10.  The Dumont Consent Decree, and DHHS’s alleged actions in \ncompliance with it, are at the heart of this case.  Several paragraphs in \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 06/05/19    PageID.7    Page 7 of 11\nPlaintiff’s Complaint are devoted to describing the Dumont litigation \nand the settlement in that lawsuit.  (Ex. A, Compl., ¶¶ 125-30.)  \nPlaintiff claims that a so-called “new policy” arose from a DHHS \nDirective issued in April 2019 – less than a month after the Dumont \nConsent Decree was entered.  The directive apparently notified Child \nPlacement Agencies (CPA’s), like Plaintiff, that they would be in \nviolation of their contract with DHHS if they refer or turn away an \notherwise qualified LGBTQ individual or same-sex couple when \nproviding a child in care with foster care and adoptive services under \nthe CPA contract.  (Compl., ¶¶ 132-133.)  Defendants disagree with the \ncharacterization as a “new policy,” but regardless, this policy is part of \nthe Settlement Agreement and forms the basis for Plaintiff’s federal \nclaims.  (Comp., ¶¶ 134, 200-26. )   No court can grant the relief that \nPlaintiff requests, to wit, an injunction or declaration allowing \ndiscrimination in the context of services provided under CPA contract – \nwithout requiring the DHHS Defendants to be in violation of the \nConsent Decree. The proper forum for enforcing the Consent Decree is \nbefore this Court that entered it.  This is true of an enforcement action \nbrought by a party to the Consent Decree and also, where, as here, a \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 06/05/19    PageID.8    Page 8 of 11\nnon-party to the Consent Decree claims its rights are violated by it.  \nKokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 381, 114 S. Ct. \n1673 (1994);  Pedreira v. Sunrise Children Servs., 802 F.3d 865, 867-68 \n(6th Cir. 2015) (claim(s) brought by a “religiously oriented” organization \nthat provided foster care services under contract with the state should \nbe heard before the court that entered the consent decree, when the \nconsent decree affected the organization’s contract with the state);  \nLessard v. City of Allen Park, 247 F.Supp.2d 843 (E.D. Mich. 2003) \n(supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims after finding original \njurisdiction over consent decree).   \n11.  Moreover, even without the Consent Decree, this Court’s \nsupplemental jurisdiction extends to Plaintiff’s state law claims.   Such \njurisdiction extends to “all [non-federal] claims that are so related to \nclaims in the action within [the Court’s] original jurisdiction that they \nform part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United \nStates Constitution” and derive from a common nucleus of operative \nfacts.  28 U.S.C. § 1367(a); Blakely v. United States, 276 F.3d 853, 861 \n(6th Cir. 2002), quoting Ahearn v. Charter Township of Bloomfield, 100 \nF.3d 451, 454-55 (6th Cir. 1996).   \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 06/05/19    PageID.9    Page 9 of 11\n \n12.  Plaintiff Catholic Charities can hardly argue that the state \nlaw claims do not derive from a common nucleus of operative facts.  The \nfirst 155 paragraphs in Plaintiff’s complaint detail the facts alleged \nhere, and all are incorporated by reference (an \n \n13.  d without exception) into each Count thereafter.   As \nexplained above, Plaintiff challenges an April 2019 directive from \nDHHS, describing a purported “new policy” that prohibits CPAs from \nreferring or turning away LGBTQ individuals and same-sex couples \nwhen providing services to a child in care under CPA contract with the \nDHHS.  Plaintiff’s claim that this “new policy” purportedly violates \nMichigan law for much the same reasons as they claim it violates \nfederal law. Both original and supplemental jurisdiction warrant \nremoval of this case to the United States District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Michigan.  \n14.  Defendants have provided written notice of this Notice to \ncounsel for Catholic Charities, and a true and complete copy of this \nNotice will be filed in the Michigan Court of Claims.  \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 06/05/19    PageID.10    Page 10 of 11\n   WHEREFORE, the DHHS Defendants and Defendant Nessel \nremove this action, previously commenced in the Michigan Court of \nClaims, to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \nMichigan.   \n \nDate: June 5, 2019    /s/ Toni L.

Lyon, Case No. 2:17-cv-13080, in which the plaintiffs \nalleged that the MDHHS Officials permitted a practice of allowing \nMDHHS’s contracted child placing agencies (CPAs) to discriminate \nagainst LGBTQ couples and individuals for religious reasons.  Bursch \nwas defending MDHHS Officials against those allegations when he put \non his second hat, as Vice President of Appellate Advocacy at the \nAlliance Defending Freedom (ADF)2 law firm.  In this role, he \nrepresented ADF and helped author an amicus brief, which advocated a \nposition contrary to what MDHHS Officials would ultimately take in \nDumont.  More importantly, several months after Bursch took the \nposition at the ADF law firm, ADF agreed to represent Plaintiffs \nCatholic Charities in this lawsuit against MDHHS, challenging a \nConsent Decree entered in Dumont in which the MDHHS Officials \n                                                 \n2 See https://www.adflegal.org/detailspages/biography-details/john-\nbursch.  Last accessed June 11, 2019. \n1 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 7   filed 06/12/19    PageID.284    Page 14 of 35\nagreed to maintain and enforce the non-discrimination provisions in the \nCPA contracts.   \n  At the time he joined ADF, Bursch had access to thousands of \ndocuments containing confidential MDHHS information gathered \nthrough discovery in the Dumont litigation, and he participated in \nconfidential client meetings during which additional information was \nshared.  Bursch’s prior representation of the MDHHS Officials in \nDumont disqualifies him from representing Plaintiff in this matter, and \nsuch conflict is imputed to all attorneys at ADF.  Mich. Rules Prof’l \nConduct 1.09, 1.10.  \n  While ADF claims that it erected a conflict screen, it was not put \nin place until several months after Bursch joined ADF, while the parties \nin Dumont were engaged in extensive discovery.  No notice was \nprovided to the MDHHS Officials, MDHHS, or the Department of \nAttorney General, despite the fact that Bursch’s representation was \npursuant to contract through which he served as a Special Assistant \nAttorney General (SAAG).  This Contract includes agreements to avoid \nconflicts of interests absent prior written approval from MDHHS.  (Ex. \nA, ¶ 5.2.)   But ADF failed to notify either the MDHHS Officials or the \n2 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 7   filed 06/12/19    PageID.285    Page 15 of 35\nDepartment of Attorney General of ADF’s representation of the present \nPlaintiff and any effort to screen Bursch from this matter until after \nthis lawsuit was filed, via letter dated May 6, 2019.  Such notice was \nineffective and untimely.   \nThis Court has both the authority and an obligation to disqualify \nthe ADF law firm.  The paramount concern in situations like this, \nwhere an attorney and, indeed, an entire law firm has switched sides, is \nto protect client confidences and avoid the appearance of impropriety.  \nADF and their local counsel, David, Wierenga & Lauka P.C., cannot \nalleviate these concerns.  This Court should disqualify them from \nrepresenting Plaintiff in this case and provide 30 days for Plaintiff to \nfind new counsel or dismiss this lawsuit.   \n3 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 7   filed 06/12/19    PageID.286    Page 16 of 35\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nOn November 20, 2017, Bursch signed a contract with the \nMichigan Department of Attorney General (AG) whereby he committed \nto provide legal services to the Michigan Department of Health and \nHuman Services (MDHHS) in Dumont v. Lyon, Case No. 2:17-cv-13080 \n(E.D. Mich. 2017) (SAAG Contract, Ex A, ¶ 1.2.)   \n   Both Dumont and the present litigation involve the \nnondiscrimination clause in MDHHS’ standard contract with private \nCPAs and its applicability to private agencies objecting on religious \ngrounds to the provision of services to LGBTQ individuals or couples.  \nThe plaintiffs in Dumont challenged MDHHS’s alleged “practice of \npermitting state-contracted and taxpayer-funded child placing agencies \nto use religious criteria to screen prospective foster and adoptive \nparents for children in the foster care system and to turn away qualified \nfamilies on the basis of sexual orientation.”  (Dumont Cplt., No. 2:17-cv-\n13080, Doc. 1, Pg. ID 1, Ex. F.) \n  Dumont was resolved through a Consent Decree, entered on \nMarch 22, 2019, by Judge Paul Borman of the United States District \nCourt for the Eastern District.  The Stipulated Order dismissed Dumont \n4 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 7   filed 06/12/19    PageID.287    Page 17 of 35\n“with prejudice pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement,” \nwith Judge Borman retaining jurisdiction over enforcement.  (Dumont \nOrder on Stipulation of Dismissal, No. 2:17-cv-13080, Doc. 83, Pg. ID \n1469, Ex. G.)  The Consent Decree requires that MDHHS’s standard \ncontracts with CPAs continue to include a Non-Discrimination \nProvision that precludes, among other things, any contracted, licensed \nCPA from turning away or sending a potentially qualified LGBTQ \nindividual or same-sex couple to another licensed CPA for services \nunder the contract including orientation, training, and home studies.  \n(Dumont Consent Decree, Ex. H.)  It also requires MDHHS to enforce \nthe Non-Discrimination Provision against any CPA that is determined \nto be in violation of such provision “up to and including termination of \nthe Contracts.” (Id. at Pg. ID 1446.)   \n  The Dumont Consent Decree forms the heart of the present \nlawsuit.  Catholic Charities claims that, after the Consent Decree was \nentered in Dumont, MDHHS “sent a directive to Michigan’s child \nplacing agencies, including Catholic Charities, purporting to implement \nthe Dumont settlement” that purportedly “forces faith-based providers \nthat believe marriage is between a man and a woman to abandon or \n5 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 7   filed 06/12/19    PageID.288    Page 18 of 35\nviolate that belief as a condition to receiving government contracts.”  \n(Doc. 1-2, Pg. ID 46-47, ¶¶ 131, 135.)   Plaintiff claims that Defendants, \nthrough this “new policy” are violating its rights under the state and \nfederal constitution, as well as Michigan law.  (Doc. 1-2, Pg. ID 51-62, \n¶¶ 156-232.)   Plaintiff seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction, \nas well as monetary damages to remedy the alleged violations.  (Doc. 1-\n2, Pg. ID 62-63.) \n  MDHHS compensated Bursch well for his services in Dumont.  He \nreceived $558 per hour, which totaled more than $60,000 during \napproximately a 14-month period. \n  Both as a member of the Bar and by signing the SAAG Contract, \nBursch agreed that his work would be governed by the “Rules of \nProfessional Conduct applicable to members of the Michigan Bar \nAssociation.” (Ex. A, ¶ 5.10.)  He also agreed that his work was, and \nwould continue to be, free from conflicts.  Specifically, Bursch agreed \nnot to “undertake representation against the State of Michigan if the \nrepresentation is related to the subject matter of th[e] Contract and \nwould require [Bursch] to take a position adverse to the State” absent \nthe AG’s prior, written approval.  (Ex. A, ¶ 5.2.) \n6 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 7   filed 06/12/19    PageID.289    Page 19 of 35\n  The commitment to avoiding conflicts extended to “other lawyers” \nin Bursch’s firm, who were to “be advised of [Bursch’s] representation of \nthe Department [of Attorney General]” and who  “agreed not to accept, \nwithout prior written approval from the [AG] any employment from \nother interests related to the subject matter of [the] Contract.”  (Id.)  No \nmention is made of any affiliation, much less employment or acceptance \nof an executive position, by ADF.  The only firm identified in the SAAG \nContract is Bursch Law, PLLC, and it agreed to “carefully monitor any \nsignificant change in assignments or clients of the firm in order to avoid \nany situation which might affect [Bursch’s] ability to effectively render \nlegal services.”  (Id.)  Bursch signed a First Amendment to the SAAG \nContract on August 16, 2018.  (Ex. B.) \n  When Bursch signed the First Amendment to the SAAG Contract \nin August 2018, he had apparently joined ADF, the law firm that now \nrepresents Plaintiff Catholic Charities in this lawsuit as its the Vice \nPresident of Appellate Advocacy.  (John Bursch Resume, available at \nlinkedin.com/in/appellate, Ex. I.)  \nADF filed an amicus brief in Dumont on January 30, 2018.  \n(Dumont ADF Amicus, Ex. D.)  And on September 4, 2019, Bursch \n7 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 7   filed 06/12/19    PageID.290    Page 20 of 35\njoined other ADF attorneys in an amicus brief filed in Fulton v. City of \nPhiladelphia, 922 F.3d 140 (3d Cir. 2019), a case involving similar \nallegations brought by Catholic Social Services in Philadelphia. (Ex. E.)   \nThe Department had no knowledge that Bursch took a position at \nADF while representing MDHHS Officials under the SAAG Contract.  \nThree attorneys representing Plaintiff Catholic Charities are attorneys \ndirectly associated with ADF.  In addition, Attorney James Wierenga, \nthe local counsel of record, is described as an “ADF-allied attorney” in a \npress release published on ADF’s website.3  This press release describes \nADF’s representation in a pending federal case, for which Wierenga \nserved as “local counsel.”  Bursch worked with Wierenga on this case, as \nhe is one of two ADF attorneys identified as available to meet with the \npress to discuss it.4 \n                                                 \n3 News Release, Alliance Defending Freedom, Michigan Farmer to \nCourt: Stop City’s Religious Hostility, Let Me Sell Food to Everyone \n(Apr. 10, 2019), https://www.adflegal.org/detailspages/press-release-\ndetails/michigan-farmer-to-court-stop-city-s-religious-hostility-let-me-\nsell-food-to-everyone.  Last accessed June 11, 2019. \n4 Indeed, both Bursch and Wierenga are listed as counsel for plaintiffs \nin Country Mill Farms, LLC v. City of East Lansing, 280 F.Supp.3d \n1029, 1037 (W.D. Mich. 2017).   \n8 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 7   filed 06/12/19    PageID.291    Page 21 of 35\n  It was not until May 6, 2019, several months after the SAAG \nContract was terminated and after ADF filed this complaint, that ADF \nfirst prepared a letter to Defendants Gordon and Chang, notifying them \nthat John Bursch had been screened from this case.  The letters were \nreceived by the Department on May 10, 2019.  (Ex. C.)    \nARGUMENT \nI.  The Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct require this \nCourt to disqualify Plaintiffs’ counsel because there is an \nunexcused conflict of interest.   \nThis Court must disqualify the ADF law firm and its local counsel \nfrom representing Plaintiff Catholic Charities because John Bursch, \nADF’s Vice President of Appellate Advocacy, the MDHHS Officials in \nDumont v. Lyon, a substantially related matter to the present case, \nrepresented mere months before this Complaint.  This conflict has not \nbeen excused and is imputed to both the ADF firm and allied attorneys \nsuch as David, Wierenga & Lauka, P.C. \n“The power to disqualify an attorney from a case is incidental to \nall courts and is necessary for the preservation of decorum, and for the \nrespectability of the profession.”  El Camino Res. LTD. V. Huntington \nNat’l Bank, 623 F.Supp.2d 863, 875-76 (W.D. Mich. 2007) (internal \n9 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 7   filed 06/12/19    PageID.292    Page 22 of 35\nquotations omitted).  It is a judicial obligation.  Specifically, this Court \nis “obliged to take measures against unethical conduct occurring in \nconnection with any proceeding before it[,]” including without \nlimitation, the disqualification of counsel when impermissible conflicts \nexist.  Musicus v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 621 F.2d 742, 743-44 (5th \nCir. 1980); see also Debiasi v. Charter County of Wayne, 284 F. Supp.2d \n760, 770 (E.D. Mich. 2003).  \nAlthough the decision whether to disqualify is a question of \nfederal law, this Court must consider the Michigan Rules of \nProfessional Conduct in making this determination.  In re Ralph \nRoberts Realty, LLC, 500 B.R. 862, 864-65 (Bankr. E.D. Mich. 2013) \n(citing El Camino, 623 F.Supp.2d at 876).  See also Local Rule 83.22(b).  \nThe paramount concerns here are protecting client confidences and \navoiding any appearance of impropriety.  Manning v. Warring, Cox, \nJames, Skylar, & Allen, 849 F.2d 222, 225-26 (6th Cir. 1988).   \nA.  Bursch’s association with the ADF law firm \ndisqualifies it from representing Plaintiff Catholic \nCharities in this lawsuit.   \nBursch’s representation of the MDHHS Officials in Dumont while \nholding an executive counsel position at ADF, without any screen or \n10 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 7   filed 06/12/19    PageID.293    Page 23 of 35\nother protection in place to prevent disclosure of his client’s confidential \ninformation, clearly disqualifies Bursch from representing Defendants.  \nThat disqualification is also imputed to and thus warrants the \ndisqualification of both the ADF firm and allied attorneys, including \nWierenga, from representing Plaintiff Catholic Charities here.  \n1.  The Rules of Professional Conduct prohibit ADF \nfrom representing Plaintiff in this claim against \na former client.   \nRule 1.9(a) of the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct \nunequivocally bars an attorney from representing a party whose \ninterests are adverse to that of a former client in the same or a \nsubstantially similar matter: \nA lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter \nshall not thereafter represent another person in the same or \na substantially related matter in which that person’s \ninterest are materially adverse to the interest of the former \nclient unless the former client consents after consultation. \n \nAccording to the Michigan Court of Appeals, “[i]t is … clear that \nan attorney may only undertake to represent a new client against a \nformer client” where, among other things, “the subject matter of the \ncurrent representation is not substantially related to a matter in which \nthe attorney represented the former client and, further, where there is \n11 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 7   filed 06/12/19    PageID.294    Page 24 of 35\nno confidential information received from the former client that is in \nany way relevant to the representation of the current client.”  Barkley v. \nCity of Detroit, 514 N.W.2d 242, 246 (Mich. App. 1994) (emphasis \nadded.)  The Sixth Circuit had made similar observations.  Nat’l Union \nFire Ins. Co. v. Alticor, Inc., 466 F.3d 456, 459 (6th Cir. 2006), vacated \nin part on other grounds, 472 F.3d 436 (6th Cir. 2007). \nAs explained below, neither of these factors apply.  The subject \nmatter of this case is substantially related to Dumont, and Bursch \ngained client confidences during his representation of the MDHHS \nofficials in this earlier, substantially related litigation.  \n2.  Dumont is a substantially related litigation. \nThere can be no reasonable dispute that Dumont is substantially \nrelated to the present lawsuit.  A substantial relationship does not \nrequire identical clients or issues, but merely that “facts pertinent to \nproblems for which the original legal services sought are relevant to the \npresent litigation.”  Anchor Packing Co. v. Pro-Seal, Inc., 688 F. Supp. \n1215, 1220-21 (E.D. Mich. 1988), quoting United States Football League \nv. Nat’l Football League, 605 F. Supp. 1448, 1459 (S.D.N.Y. 1985).   \n12 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 7   filed 06/12/19    PageID.295    Page 25 of 35\nBoth Dumont and the present litigation involve constitutional \nchallenges to a nondiscrimination clause in MDHHS’s standard contract \nwith CPAs and actions taken in enforcement thereof.  Both concern \nwhether CPAs in contract with MDHHS can turn away same-sex \ncouples or LGBTQ individuals who request services under the contract. \nIn other words, the cases are two sides of the same coin.  \nThe Dumont plaintiffs alleged that MDHHS Officials violated \ntheir constitutional rights by maintaining contracts with CPAs that \nturned away individuals or couples based on sexual orientation.  Here, \nCatholic Charities claims that MDHHS Officials have violated or will \nviolate its constitutional rights by not allowing it to turn away same-sex \ncouples or LGBTQ individuals who request services under the contract.  \n(Cplt., ¶¶ 94-95, 131-36, 144; Doc. 1-2, Pg ID 46-49.)  Accordingly, the \nfacts pertinent to resolving this dispute are the same or substantially \nsimilar to those in Dumont.   \nB.  Bursch received confidential information through his \nrepresentation of the MDHHS Officials in Dumont.  \nThe presence of the substantial relationship creates a strong \npresumption that ADF will use MDHHS’s client confidences against it \n13 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 7   filed 06/12/19    PageID.296    Page 26 of 35\nin the present litigation.  Nathan v. Shea (In re Marks & Goergens), 199 \nB.R. 922, 925 (E.D. Mich. 1996).  This could be significant.   \nAs lead counsel for the MDHHS Officials in Dumont, Bursch had \naccess to thousands of client-documents.  Numerous documents were \nflagged for Bursch’s review and evaluation and in many cases withheld \nfrom production on the grounds of privilege.  He also participated in \nnumerous confidential meetings with high-ranking officials regarding \nthe Dumont litigation and MDHHS’ policy and procedure when working \nwith CPAs like Plaintiff Catholic Charities.  Bursch received \nconfidential information from MDHHS as lead counsel in Dumont. \nNotably, Defendants need not prove, nor must the Court inquire \ninto whether Bursch actually disclosed confidential information to the \nADF attorneys assigned to this case, or whether ADF is employing that \nconfidential information here.  The purpose for requiring a substantial \nrelationship between the subject matter of the current and past \nrepresentations is to avoid requiring the Court to directly inquire into \nwhether client confidences were disclosed—an inquiry that would \nnecessarily require the divulgence of such confidences.  Anchor Packing \nCo., 688 F. Supp. at 1226.  It is sufficient that Bursch’s prior \n14 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 7   filed 06/12/19    PageID.297    Page 27 of 35\nrepresentation of the MDHHS Officials, while holding an executive \nposition at ADF, provided him access to a significant amount of client \nconfidences that are presumed available in this litigation, and that the \nlitigations are substantially related. \nC.  Bursch’s conflict is imputed to all ADF attorneys. \nMoreover, Bursch’s conflict is imputed to all attorneys associated \nwith him at ADF.  This is not a situation where Bursch joined ADF \nafter his representation of the MDHHS Officials ended.  To the \ncontrary, the attorneys representing Plaintiff were, presumably, \nassociated with Bursch since, at least, July 2018 when he joined ADF as \nexecutive counsel.  (Ex. I.)  The following month, he signed a First \nAmendment to the SAAG Contract and led the representation of the \nMDHHS Officials in Dumont for four months after this.5  (During that \ntime, he collaborated with other ADF attorneys in at least one case with \nsubstantially the same facts and legal issues as raised here.  Fulton v. \nCity of Philadelphia, 922 F.3d 140 (3d Cir. 2019).  (Ex. E.)    \n                                                 \n5 The SAAG Contract terminated in January 2019. \n15 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 7   filed 06/12/19    PageID.298    Page 28 of 35\nNone of these attorneys can undertake representation from which \nBursch himself is conflicted.  The Michigan Rules of Professional \nConduct are clear:  “While attorneys are associated in a firm, none of \nthem shall knowingly represent a client when any one of them \npracticing alone would be prohibited from doing so by Rules 1.7, 1.8(c), \n1.9(a), or 2.2.”  Mich. Rule of Prof’l Conduct1.10(a).  \nThe situation is akin to Analytica, Inc. v NPD Research, Inc. \nwhere “the firm itself changed sides.”  708 F.2d 1263, 1267 (7th Cir. \n1983).  Without a screen or other protection against disclosure of client \nconfidences among the firm, the Seventh Circuit found it “irrelevant” \nwhether different attorneys handled the matters at issue in the conflict \nanalysis. Id.  The crucial factor is whether an attorney “could have \nobtained confidential information in the first representation that would \nhave been relevant in the second.”  Id. \nSimilarly, the Michigan Court of Appeals relied on Rule 1.10(a) to \ndisqualify a law firm from representing a potential cross-claimant of a \nformer client in a substantially related litigation.  Avink v. SMG, 761 \nN.W.2d 826, 827-31 (Mich. Ct. App. 2009).  Like the Seventh Circuit, \nthe Michigan Court of Appeals was not persuaded by the firm’s \n16 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 7   filed 06/12/19    PageID.299    Page 29 of 35\nassertion that different attorneys were employed in the respective \nlitigations.  The court recognized that such an argument “ignores MRPC \n1.10(a),” through which the court “impute[s] conflict of interest to the \nentire firm.”  Id. at 831.   \n  This imputed conflict extends to David, Wierenga & Lauka, P.C., \nPlaintiff’s local counsel.  While Wierenga may not be employed by ADF \nfull-time, he is described as an “ADF-allied attorney” in a press release \npublished on ADF’s website.6  He also, apparently, worked with Bursch \nand another ADF attorney as local counsel in the federal district court \ncase described in the above-cited press release, which challenged the \napplication of a local ordinance prohibiting discrimination based on \nsexual orientation.  Id.  Rule 1.10 extends to attorneys “associated” in a \nlaw firm and, Defendants maintain that Wierenga is an “associated” \nattorney as local counsel and as Bursch’s “allied attorney” at ADF. \nD.  ADF’s May 6, 2019 Letter does not evidence a timely or \neffective screen.  \nNeither Bursch nor ADF undertook the steps necessary to avoid \nthis conflict.  The SAAG Contract, at least, placed Bursch on notice of a \n                                                 \n6 See Alliance Defending Freedom, supra note 3. \n17 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 7   filed 06/12/19    PageID.300    Page 30 of 35\nduty to obtain prior written approval before accepting employment with \nADF regarding interests related to the subject matter of the SAAG \nContract.  (Ex. A, ¶¶ 5.2, 5.10.)  There is no record that he did this.  Nor \nis there any record that at the time Bursch associated himself with ADF, \nADF implemented a screen that protected the MDHHS Officials’ \nconfidences from being shared among Bursch’s associates at ADF.   \nThe May 6, 2019 letter states that ADF decided to screen Bursch \n“at the very beginning of its representation” of Plaintiff Catholic \nCharities in this matter.  The letter did not provide a date as to when \nthe representation began, but presumably, it was after the Dumont \nConsent Decree was filed and, therefore, several months after Bursch’s \nassociation with ADF began.  No emails or other records were provided \nin support of this conclusory statement.   \nADF also failed to comply with Rule 1.11 of the Michigan Rules of \nProfessional Conduct.  Subsection (a) permits lawyers to represent \nprivate clients in matters in which an attorney in the same firm \n“participated personally and substantially as a public officer or \nemployee” only if the conflicted attorney is screened and  “written notice \nis promptly given to the appropriate government agency to enable it to \n18 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 7   filed 06/12/19    PageID.301    Page 31 of 35\nascertain compliance with the provisions of this rule.”  Id.  “Matter” is \ndefined broadly to include, among other things, a claim or controversy.  \nMich. Rules Prof’l Conduct 1.11(d)(1).   \nThe “matter” at issue here is whether MDHHS’s policy or practice \nauthorizes CPAs like Plaintiff to turn away same-sex couples or LGBTQ \nindividuals who requests services under the CPA contract.  As \nexplained above, this was the central issue in the Dumont litigation, \nand Bursch personally and substantially participated in Dumont as a \nSAAG.  In August 2018, while Bursch was under contract to represent \nMDHHS Officials in Dumont, ADF was involved in litigation of a same, \nor at least, nearly identical matter in Fulton.  Rule 1.11(a) permits this \nonly by implementing a screen and providing prompt notice to MDHHS.  \nNeither was done.  In fact, rather than screen Bursch and segregate \nhim from such representation, ADF authorized Bursch’s participation, \nco-authoring a September 2018 amicus brief for ADF that was filed in \nin Fulton.  Plaintiff’s counsel should be disqualified for failure to comply \nwith Rule 1.11. \nNotably, even if ADF had implemented a timely screen, no notice \nof the conflict or the screen was provided to MDHHS at the time.  Rule \n19 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 7   filed 06/12/19    PageID.302    Page 32 of 35\n1.11(a) requires the ADF law firm not only to implement a screen, but \nalso to provide prompt written notice of the screen to the government \nagency so that the agency can sufficiently ascertain ADF’s compliance \nwith the rule. \nThe May 6, 2019 letter does not demonstrate prompt notice.  \nDefendants Gordon and Chang received it on May 9, 2019–almost two \nweeks after the complaint had been filed.  While the letter states that a \ndecision to screen Bursch “occurred at the very beginning of \nrepresentation,” it provides no details as to when this representation \nbegan.  It is unlikely the 42-page complaint, with significant details \nregarding the services purportedly provided by Catholic Charities under \nthe CPA contract, was drafted overnight.  Nor are there details as to \nwhat efforts were being taken to screen Bursch, other than a \nrepresentation that he agreed not to participate in discussion regarding \nthe case.   \nIn Cobb Publishing v. Hearst Corporation, this Court disqualified \na firm from continuing representation because its notice to the tribunal \ncame 16 days after the conflicted lawyer began working at the firm.  \n907 F.Supp. 1038, 1048-49 (E.D. Mich. 1995).  This Court found this did \n20 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 7   filed 06/12/19    PageID.303    Page 33 of 35\nnot qualify as “prompt” notice to the tribunal as required by Rule \n1.10(b) of the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct.  It also found the \nscreen untimely because it was not in place until ten days after the \nattorney started working at the firm.  Id. at 1044, 1048-49.  Given the \ntiming of the May 6, 2019, letter and the vague information provided \ntherein, similar findings are appropriate here. \n21 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 7   filed 06/12/19    PageID.304    Page 34 of 35\nCONCLUSION AND RELIEF REQUESTED \nFor the reasons explained above, the Defendants respectfully \nrequest this Court enter an order disqualifying Alliance Defending \nFreedom and David, Wierenga, & Lauka, P.C. from representing \nPlaintiff Catholic Charities West Michigan in this case.

The Litigation was removed to this Court on June \n5, 2019 (ECF No. 1). \nThe Parties wish to resolve all Claims, and the Parties agree that \nthey are entering into the Agreement for that purpose only.  Defendants \ndo not admit the facts alleged in the Complaint or liability on any claim, \nexcept as set forth in the following paragraph. \nIn the Contracts, MDHHS maintains discretion to approve \nPlaintiff’s request to return the referral of a foster child previously \nplaced with Plaintiff.  MDHHS chooses to exercise this discretion based \non its consideration of the best interests of the child.  Because MDHHS \nexercises this discretion, and as a result of the Supreme Court’s decision \nin Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, 593 U.S. ___ (2021), the Parties agree \nthat Plaintiff would likely prevail on Count V (Free Exercise) of the \nComplaint. On this basis alone, Defendants agree to the entry of a \njudgment on Count V against MDHHS. \nTerms of the Agreement and Order \nNOW, THEREFORE, in the interest of resolving the Litigation, \nPlaintiff and MDHHS hereby STIPULATE AND AGREE as follows: \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 54, PageID.2082   Filed 03/21/22   Page 5 of 15\n \n1.

HON. DENISE PAGE HOOD \n   \nMICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF  MAG. J. DAVID R. GRAND \nHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES;   \nROBERT GORDON, in his official  MOTION TO INTERVENE \ncapacity as the Director of the Michigan   \nDepartment of Health and Human  ORAL ARGUMENT \nServices; MICHIGAN CHILDREN’S  REQUESTED \nSERVICES AGENCY; JOOYEUN \n \nCHANG, in her official capacity as \n  \nExecutive Director of Michigan \nChildren’s Services Agency; DANA \nNESSEL, in her official capacity as \nAttorney General of Michigan, \n \nDefendants. \n \nKristy  Dumont  and  Dana  Dumont  (collectively,  “the  Dumonts”) \nrespectfully move this Court under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2) and \n(b)(1) for leave to intervene in the above-captioned action (the “Action”) for the \nreasons below and explained more fully in the brief filed in support of this motion \n(the “Motion”) and the Proposed Answer, attached hereto as Exhibit A.  \n1.  The Dumonts respectfully seek intervention as of right in this Action.  \nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2).  The Dumonts satisfy the four required prongs for \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 20   filed 07/17/19    PageID.834    Page 2 of 32\nintervention as of right: “(1) that the motion to intervene was timely; (2) that they \nhave a substantial legal interest in the subject matter of the case; (3) that their ability \nto protect that interest may be impaired in the absence of intervention; and (4) that \nthe parties already before the court may not adequately represent their interest.”  \nGrutter v. Bollinger, 188 F.3d 394, 397–98 (6th Cir. 1999). \n2.  First, the Motion is timely because it is filed at the very early stages of \nthis  Action,  before  any  party  has  responded  to  the  Plaintiff’s  motion  for  a \npreliminary injunction or the commencement of discovery.  Second, the Dumonts \nhave  a  substantial  legal  interest  in  the  subject  matter  of  the  case  because  the \ncomplaint filed by Catholic Charities West Michigan (“CCWM”) directly implicates \nthe Dumonts’ rights under the Equal Protection and Establishment Clauses of the \nUnited States Constitution.  The Dumonts sought to vindicate these rights in  Dumont \net al. v. Gordon et al., 2:17-cv-13080-PDB-EAS (E.D. Mich. 2019) (“Dumont”), \nwherein the Dumonts reached a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) \nwith the State of Michigan to end discrimination by state-contracted child placing \nagencies (“CPAs”).  The Dumonts have a substantial interest in preserving the \nSettlement Agreement that in turn protects their constitutional rights and protects \nthem against being exposed to further discrimination as they pursue adopting a child \nout of foster care.  Third, the Dumonts’ interests in preserving the relief obtained \nthrough the Settlement Agreement and avoiding further constitutional injury may be \nii \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 20   filed 07/17/19    PageID.835    Page 3 of 32\nimpaired in the absence of intervention because if CCWM succeeds in its claims, the \nDumonts’ Settlement Agreement would be rendered meaningless.  The Dumonts \ndismissed their previous claims in exchange for a settlement that provided them the \nrelief  they  sought,  and  would  be left  without  recourse.    And  finally,  no  party \ncurrently before the Court can adequately represent the Dumonts’ interests because \nDefendants are unlikely to assert many of the defenses the Dumonts intend to raise. \n3.  Alternatively, the Dumonts respectfully ask the Court to exercise its \ndiscretion to allow permissive intervention because the Dumonts’ defenses share \nwith the pending litigation “a common question of law or fact,” Fed. R. Civ. P. \n24(b)(1)(B), and intervention will not “unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of \nthe original parties’ rights.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(3); Purnell v. City of Akron, 925 \nF.2d 941, 951 (6th Cir. 1991).  Both the Plaintiff and the Dumonts raise claims or \ndefenses related to whether the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution require the State of Michigan to permit state-contracted CPAs to \nviolate  the  contracts’  non-discrimination  requirement  that  includes  sexual \norientation.  Granting the Dumonts’ motion to intervene will not result in delay or \nprejudice because the case is in its very early stages, and the Dumonts are prepared \nto proceed according to the schedule ordered by the Court. \n4.  In accordance with the Eastern District of Michigan’s Local Civil Rule \n7.1(a), the Dumonts conferred with counsel for Plaintiffs and Defendants via e-mail \niii \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 20   filed 07/17/19    PageID.836    Page 4 of 32\non July 17, 2019 to determine if they would oppose the Motion to Intervene.

Whether Kristy and Dana Dumont satisfy the requirements for intervention as \nof right where Plaintiff Catholic Charities West Michigan seeks relief that \nwould  impair  the  Dumonts’  rights  under  the  Establishment  and  Equal \nProtection Clauses, nullify the settlement agreement they executed with the \nState in Dumont v. Gordon, and impose stigmatic and practical harms by \nrequiring them to navigate a foster care and adoption system that permits \ndiscrimination against families like them. \n \n2.  Whether the Court should grant the Dumonts permissive intervention where \nboth the Dumonts and Plaintiffs will raise common questions of law regarding \nwhether  the  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  United  States \nConstitution require state-contracted child placing agencies to be permitted to \ndiscriminate against prospective foster and adoptive parents. \n \n \nv \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 20   filed 07/17/19    PageID.843    Page 11 of 32\n \n \nCONTROLLING OR MOST APPROPRIATE AUTHORITY \nGrutter v. Bollinger, 188 F.3d 394, 399 (6th Cir. 1999) (finding that prospective \nminority applicants had a “direct, substantial, and compelling” legal interest to \nsupport intervention as of right in a lawsuit brought by white applicants challenging \na university’s race-conscious admissions policy, where the proposed intervenors’ \ninterest in gaining admission could be impacted if the university were ordered to \nstop considering race as a factor in admissions); Jansen v.

Gordon et al., 2:17-cv-13080-\nPDB-EAS  (E.D.  Mich.  2019)  (“Dumont”).    If  CCWM  prevails,  the  settlement \nagreement  (“Settlement  Agreement”)  reached  in  Dumont  will  be  rendered \nmeaningless.   \nAfter being subjected to discrimination by two CPAs, the Dumonts \nsued the State claiming that allowing state-contracted, taxpayer-funded CPAs to use \nreligious criteria to exclude same-sex couples violated the Establishment and Equal \nProtection Clauses.  The core legal issues raised in this action (the “Action”) were \nalso asserted in Dumont, in which another CPA, St. Vincent Catholic Charities \n(“STVCC”), intervened as a defendant and raised the identical federal constitutional \narguments CCWM now raises in this case.  After denial of the State’s and STVCC’s \nmotions to dismiss, the State ultimately settled with the Dumonts and, in so doing, \nagreed to enforce the non-discrimination provisions in its CPA contracts and take \ncorrective action against CPAs that failed to comply with those provisions.  The \nDumont court then dismissed the case “pursuant to the terms of the Settlement \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 20   filed 07/17/19    PageID.845    Page 13 of 32\n \nAgreement.”  Dumont, ECF No. 83 at PageID.1469; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2) \n(“[A]n action may be dismissed at the plaintiff’s request only by court order, on \nterms that the court considers proper.”).  That settlement meant that the Dumonts \ncould pursue their goal of adopting a child out of foster care in Michigan without \nbeing denied access to the same array of CPAs that are available to heterosexual \ncouples and without being further subjected to the stigma of discrimination.  CCWM \nnow threatens to render that settlement meaningless, depriving the Dumonts of the \nrelief procured. \nBecause the Dumonts meet all prongs of the Sixth Circuit’s inquiry for \nintervention as of right—(1) a timely motion; (2) a substantial legal interest that will \nbe impaired; and (3) inadequate representation from the parties before the Court—\nand,  in  the  alternative,  for  permissive  intervention,  they  should  be  allowed  to \nintervene in this Action to protect their constitutional rights and their interest in the \nState’s enforcement of the non-discrimination provision in its CPA contracts.   \nBACKGROUND \nIn  2016  and  2017,  Kristy  and  Dana  Dumont  contacted  two  state-\ncontracted CPAs, STVCC and Bethany Christian Services, to inquire about adopting \na child from foster care and were turned away because the agencies stated that they \n“do[] not work with same-sex couples.”  Dumont, ECF No. 1 at PageID.16–17.   On \nSeptember  20,  2017,  the  Dumonts,  along  with  Erin  and  Rebecca  Busk-Sutton \n2 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 20   filed 07/17/19    PageID.846    Page 14 of 32\n \n(collectively the “Dumont Plaintiffs”),1 filed a complaint against Nick Lyon, in his \nofficial capacity as the Director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human \nServices (“MDHHS”), and Herman McCall, in his official capacity as the Executive \nDirector of the Michigan Children’s Services Agency (collectively the “Dumont \nState Defendants”), in the Eastern District of Michigan. The suit challenged the \nState’s apparent practice of permitting state-contracted, taxpayer-funded CPAs to \nuse  religious  criteria  to  exclude  same-sex  couples  from  fostering  or  adopting \nchildren in State custody.  See generally id.  The Dumont Plaintiffs claimed that \ndelegating  the  public  function  of  providing  foster  care  services  to  a  religious \norganization and then authorizing the organization to exclude participants based on \nreligious criteria violated the Establishment Clause.  Id. at PageID.1–4.  The Dumont \nPlaintiffs further claimed that discrimination based on sexual orientation in this \ngovernment program violated the Equal Protection Clause because it furthered no \nlegitimate government interest and, to the contrary, undermined the State’s interest \nin finding families for children by reducing their placement options.  See id. at \nPageID.20–21. \n                                                 \n1   The claims of another Plaintiff, Jennifer Ludolph, who claimed only taxpayer \nstanding, were dismissed.  Dumont v. Lyon, 341 F. Supp. 3d 706, 714 (E.D. Mich. \n2018).  None of the other Dumont Plaintiffs are currently moving to intervene \nalongside the Dumonts.   \n3 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 20   filed 07/17/19    PageID.847    Page 15 of 32\n \nSTVCC moved for leave to intervene in Dumont, which the Dumont \ncourt granted.  Dumont, ECF Nos. 18, 33 & 34.  The Dumont State Defendants and \nSTVCC both moved to dismiss the Dumont complaint.  Dumont, ECF Nos. 16 & 19.  \nSTVCC’s motion asserted (like CCWM’s complaint here) that the court could not \nconstitutionally grant the relief sought by the Dumont Plaintiffs because it would \nviolate STVCC’s free exercise and free speech rights.  See Dumont, ECF No. 19, at \nPageID.3.  Following oral argument, the Dumont court denied the motions to dismiss \nthe Dumont Plaintiffs’ claims, holding that their allegations that the State authorized \nstate-contracted, taxpayer-funded agencies to use religious criteria to exclude same-\nsex couples stated claims under the Establishment and Equal Protection Clauses of \nthe United States Constitution.  Dumont v. Lyon, 341 F. Supp. 3d 706, 714 (E.D. \nMich. 2018); see also id. at 740, 743 (holding that the allegations of the complaint \n“surely  ‘implicate’  the  Establishment  Clause  and  plausibly  suggest  ‘excessive \nentanglement’” and that the Dumont Plaintiffs were “entitled to an opportunity to \nconduct discovery to support their claim that the State’s practice of continuing to \ncontract with faith-based agencies that . . .  turn away same-sex couples lacks a \nrational basis”).  The court was also “unconvinced” that STVCC could “prevail on \na claim that prohibiting the State from allowing the use of religious criteria by those \nprivate agencies hired to do the State’s work would violate [STVCC’s] Free Exercise \nor Free Speech rights.”  Id. at 749.   \n4 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 20   filed 07/17/19    PageID.848    Page 16 of 32\n \nFollowing denial of the motions to dismiss, the parties engaged in \nsubstantial  discovery.    This  included  the  exchange  of  written  discovery  and \ndocument production (totaling over 66,600 pages produced by the parties), through \nwhich it was revealed, inter alia, that:  \n  Pursuant to their contracts, MDHHS requires CPAs to provide services \nincluding recruitment, evaluation and licensure of prospective families \n(Buck et al. v. Gordon et al., 1:10-cv-00286-RJJ-PJG (W.D. Mich. \n2019), ECF No. 1-7 at PageID.123–24); \n  It is MDHHS’ position that CPAs under contract with MDHHS must \nwork with all prospective foster or adoptive parents who need or seek \nsuch services (Buck, ECF No. 1-4 at PageID.94–95); \n  MDHHS  previously  determined,  through  special  investigation,  that \nCCWM  had  policies  of  not  accepting  same-sex  couples,  and  took \ncorrective action against it (see Buck, ECF No. 34-3 at PageID.977–\n78);  \n  MDHHS had initiated investigations, still in process, against STVCC \nand Bethany Christian Services for alleged anti-discrimination policy \nviolations as a result of the allegations in the Dumont complaint (id.; \nsee also Buck, ECF No. 6-16 at PageID.379); and \n  MDHHS was aware that certain CPAs were discriminating against \nsame-sex  parents,  but  ultimately  allowed  this  discrimination  to \ncontinue (see Dumont, ECF No. 16 at PageID.76–77). \nBefore depositions and the briefing of dispositive motions, the Dumont Plaintiffs \nand the Dumont State Defendants began settlement discussions and jointly moved \non January 23, 2019 for a stay of the proceedings.  Dumont, ECF No. 74.  On January \n24 and February 22, the Dumont court entered orders staying the case for a total of \n60 days to facilitate settlement.  Dumont, ECF Nos. 76 & 81.  On March 22, 2019, \n5 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 20   filed 07/17/19    PageID.849    Page 17 of 32\n \nshortly before expiration of the stay, the Dumont Plaintiffs and Defendants Robert \nGordon, in his official capacity as Director of MDHHS, and Jennifer Wrayno, in her \nofficial capacity as Acting Executive Director of the Michigan Children’s Agency, \nentered into the Settlement Agreement to resolve the Dumont Plaintiffs’ claims.  \nDumont, ECF No. 82. \nPursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Dumont State Defendants \nagreed, among other things, to continue including a provision in their CPA contracts \nthat prohibits discrimination “against any individual or group because of race, sex, \nreligion, age, national origin, color, height, weight, marital status, gender identity or \nexpression,  sexual  orientation,  political  beliefs,  or  disability,”  and  to  enforce \ncompliance with the non-discrimination provision by, in the case of CPAs unwilling \nto comply, terminating those contracts.  Dumont, ECF No. 82 at PageID.1444–46.  \nThe Settlement Agreement made clear that “turning away or referring to another \ncontracted CPA an otherwise potentially qualified LGBTQ individual or same-sex \ncouple that may be a suitable foster or adoptive family for any child accepted by the \nCPA for services under a [state contract]” violates the non-discrimination provision.  \nId. at PageID.1445.  In exchange, the Dumont Plaintiffs agreed to dismiss their \nclaims against the Dumont State Defendants with prejudice.  Upon entering into the \nSettlement Agreement, the Dumont Plaintiffs and the Dumont State Defendants filed \na stipulation of voluntary dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n6 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 20   filed 07/17/19    PageID.850    Page 18 of 32\n \n41(a)(2).  Dumont, ECF No. 82.  The court dismissed the Dumont case “pursuant to \nthe terms of the Settlement Agreement.”  Dumont, ECF No. 83 at PageID.1469.   \nBecause of the protections afforded by the State’s representations in \nexecuting the Settlement, the Dumonts have “resumed evaluating child placing \nagencies and inquiring about fostering and adopting a child from the Michigan child \nwelfare system.”  (Declaration of Kristy Dumont ¶ 9, attached hereto as Exhibit B; \nDeclaration of Dana Dumont ¶ 9, attached hereto as Exhibit C.)  As they actively \npursue fostering and adopting children, they “want to have the full range of options \navailable to [them] that everyone else has.”  (Kristy Dumont Decl. ¶ 10; Dana \nDumont Decl. ¶ 10.) \nCCWM  filed  this  Action  on  April  25,  directly  implicating  the \nconstitutional rights that the Dumonts sought to protect, and succeeded in protecting \nvia the Settlement Agreement reached in Dumont.  Allegations regarding Dumont, \nthe  Dumont  Settlement  Agreement  and  the  State’s  actions  to  comply  with  the \nSettlement  Agreement  form  the  crux  of  CCWM’s  Complaint.    ECF  No.  1  at \n¶¶ 125-134. \nLEGAL STANDARD \nIntervention should be granted as of right where a proposed intervenor \n“claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the \naction, and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair \n7 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 20   filed 07/17/19    PageID.851    Page 19 of 32\n \nor  impede  the  movant’s  ability  to  protect  its  interest,  unless  existing  parties \nadequately represent that interest.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2).  Thus, to intervene as a \nmatter of right, proposed intervenors must establish: “(1) that the motion to intervene \nwas timely; (2) that they have a substantial legal interest in the subject matter of the \ncase; (3) that their ability to protect that interest may be impaired in the absence of \nintervention; and (4) that the parties already before the court may not adequately \nrepresent their interest.”  Grutter v. Bollinger, 188 F.3d 394, 397–98 (6th Cir. 1999). \nThe court may also permit a party to intervene where she “has a claim \nor defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.”  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 24(b)(1)(B); see also Purnell v. City of Akron, 925 F.2d 941, 950 (6th Cir. \n1991)  (“Rule  24(b)  grants  the  district  court  discretionary  power  to  permit \nintervention if the motion is timely, and if the applicant’s claim or defense and the \nmain action have a question of law or fact in common.”) (internal citation and \npunctuation omitted).  The court must also “consider whether the intervention will \nunduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.”  \nPurnell, 925 F.2d at 951 (internal citation omitted); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(3). \nIn considering a motion to intervene, the court “‘must accept as true the \nnon-conclusory allegations of the motion.’”  Horrigan v. Thompson, No. 96-4138, \n1998 WL 246008, at *2 (6th Cir. May 7, 1998) (quoting Lake Inv’rs Dev. Grp. v. \nEgidi Dev. Grp., 715 F.2d 1256, 1258 (7th Cir. 1983)); see also Parkwest Dev., LLC \n8 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 20   filed 07/17/19    PageID.852    Page 20 of 32\n \nv. Ellahi, No. 18-CV-10385, 2018 WL 3640433, at *2 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 1, 2018) \n(“Rule 24 . . . does not require that the proposed intervenor conclusively establish \nits claim before intervention is allowed.  By its terms, the rule applies to anyone who \n‘claims’ an interest in the action . . . ”). \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE  DUMONTS  ARE  ENTITLED  TO  INTERVENTION  AS  OF \nRIGHT. \nA.  The Dumonts’ Motion Is Timely. \nThe Motion is timely filed because this Action is in its initial stage.  In \nassessing timeliness under Rule 24, the court must consider: \n(a) the point to which the suit has progressed; (b) the \npurpose for which intervention is sought; (c) the length of \ntime preceding the application during which the applicant \nknew or reasonably should have known of its interest in \nthe case; (d) prejudice to the original parties due to the \nfailure of the applicant to apply promptly for intervention \nupon acquiring the knowledge of its interest; and (e) any \nunusual circumstances of the case. \nLinton v. Comm’r of Health and Env’t., State of Tenn., 973 F.2d 1311, 1317 (6th \nCir. 1992).  In Michigan State AFL-CIO v. Miller, a motion to intervene was held \n“timely as a matter of law” where it was filed when “the case was obviously in its \ninitial stage.”  103 F.3d 1240, 1245 (6th Cir. 1997).  Here, the Motion was filed \nbefore any party has responded to the motion for preliminary injunction and before \nthe commencement of discovery.  This clearly satisfies the timeliness requirement.   \n9 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 20   filed 07/17/19    PageID.853    Page 21 of 32\n \nB.  The Dumonts Have a Substantial Legal Interest in the Action. \nThe Sixth Circuit “has opted for a rather expansive notion of the interest \nsufficient to invoke intervention of right,” and has held that any “close cases should \nbe resolved in favor of recognizing an interest under Rule 24(a).”  Miller, 103 F.3d \nat 1245, 1247.  CCWM seeks to force the State, in violation of its obligations under \nthe Settlement Agreement, to contract with organizations that discriminate in the \nprovision of adoption and foster care services.  The Dumonts have a substantial \ninterest in this Action for two reasons.  First, the Dumonts have an interest in \nprotecting the hard-fought Settlement Agreement they obtained in exchange for the \ndismissal of their constitutional claims.  The relief CCWM seeks would vitiate the \nDumonts’ contractual rights under the Settlement Agreement.  Second, the relief \nCCWM seeks would mean that the Dumonts would be subjected to unconstitutional \nunequal treatment, causing further practical and stigmatic injuries by requiring the \nDumonts to pursue their desire to adopt a child from foster care in a system in which \nagencies may, once again, discriminate against them. \nFirst, a party has a substantial interest warranting intervention as of \nright where, as here, the proposed intervenor is party to a court-endorsed settlement \nagreement that is directly challenged in a separate litigation.  See Jansen v. City of \nCincinnati, 904 F.2d 336, 342 (6th Cir. 1990) (granting motion to intervene where \n“[t]he proposed intervenors . . . are parties to the consent decree challenged in this \n10 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 20   filed 07/17/19    PageID.854    Page 22 of 32\n \naction”) (emphasis in original).  The Jansen v. City of Cincinnati case dealt with a \ncollateral challenge by a group of white firefighters to a consent decree regarding \nrace-based employment practices entered into by the City of Cincinnati and a group \nof black firefighters.  Id. at 339.  The black firefighters moved to intervene in the \nwhite firefighters’ case to defend the consent decree.  Id.  The Sixth Circuit held that \nthe black firefighters had a “significant legal interest in the subject matter of the \nlitigation” where they were “parties to [a] consent decree challenged in” the pending \naction and where “[a]t stake in this litigation is the proposed intervenors’ interest in \ncontinuing” the mandates of the consent decree.  Id. at 341, 42; see also City of St. \nLouis v. Velsicol Chem. Corp., 708 F. Supp. 2d 632, 669 (E.D. Mich. 2010) (granting \nmotion by United States to intervene as of right in suit brought by City of St. Louis \nagainst  trustees  challenging  certain  trusts  established  pursuant  to  settlement \nagreement to which United States was party).  As in  Jansen, where the white \nfirefighters’ lawsuit sought to undo the affirmative action program established by \nthe City’s consent decree, here, CCWM seeks to undo the Settlement Agreement.  \nSpecifically,  CCWM  wants  to  prevent  the  State  from  enforcing  the  non-\ndiscrimination provision in its CPA contracts.  The Dumonts litigated against the \nState and another CPA for over a year to achieve a commitment from the State that \ndiscrimination against families like theirs would no longer be permitted in the State \nof Michigan.  However Plaintiff may characterize it, the Action seeks to completely \n11 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 20   filed 07/17/19    PageID.855    Page 23 of 32\n \neviscerate the Settlement Agreement.  The Dumonts, like the intervenors in Jansen, \nhave  a  substantial  interest  in  protecting  the  relief  secured  through  adversarial \nnegotiations with the State.2 \nThe relief CCWM seeks would, if granted, infringe on the Dumonts’ \nexisting  contractual  rights.    The  Sixth  Circuit  has  recognized  that  a  proposed \nintervenor has a sufficient legal interest for intervention where the resolution of a \nlitigation would directly impair her contractual rights.  See, e.g., Linton, 973 F.2d at \n1319 (reversing district court denial of motion by nursing homes to intervene as of \nright in suit brought by medical patients against state agency administering Medicaid \nprogram because the district court “failed to recognize the alleged impairment of the \nmovants’ contractual and statutory rights”); Dumont, ECF No. 34 at PageID.783 \n(“[T]his action directly involves [proposed intervenors’] ability to continue to use \nreligious criteria when performing child welfare services for the State of Michigan” \npursuant to its contracts.); cf. Blount-Hill v. Bd. of Educ. of Ohio, 195 F. App’x 482, \n486  (6th  Cir.  2006)  (affirming  denial  of  motion  to  intervene  where  proposed \nintervenor was “not a party to any challenged contract nor [was] it directly targeted \nby  plaintiffs’  complaint”).    Over  more  than  two  months,  and  after  substantial \n                                                 \n2   The fact that the settlement in Jansen was a consent decree does not change \nthe analysis: the  black  firefighters  had  an  interest in protecting the  relief  they \nsecured, just like the Dumonts do. \n12 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 20   filed 07/17/19    PageID.856    Page 24 of 32\n \ndiscovery and motion practice, the Dumonts negotiated the terms of the Settlement \nAgreement, which requires that MDHHS enforce the non-discrimination provision \nof their CPA contracts and provides for specific performance if MDHHS fails to \ninvestigate or enforce alleged violations of the non-discrimination provision, up to \nand  including termination of such contracts.   See  Dumont,  ECF  No. 82.   The \nSettlement Agreement, therefore, contractually binds MDHHS to ensure its non-\ndiscrimination provision protects the Dumonts and others similarly situated.  If \nCCWM succeeds in forcing Defendants to continue contracting with CCWM to \nprovide  foster  care  and  adoption  services  despite  CCWM’s  continued \ndiscrimination,  see  Compl.,  ECF  No.  1-2  at  PageID.62–63,  it  will  render  the \nSettlement Agreement a nullity and eliminate the entire benefit of the Dumonts’ \nbargain with the Dumont State Defendants.   \nSecond, the relief CCWM seeks here—the right to dictate the terms of \na  contract  to  provide  public  child  welfare  services  while  employing  religious \neligibility criteria to exclude qualified same-sex couples—is precisely what was \nchallenged in Dumont.  In considering the Dumonts’ allegations, the Dumont court \ndetermined that such conduct constitutes a cognizable injury-in-fact.  Dumont, 341 \nF. Supp. 3d at 720–22.  The Dumont court recognized that the Dumonts faced a \npractical barrier; because fewer agencies will work with them, “‘it [is] more difficult \nfor [same-sex couples to adopt] than it is for [heterosexual couples]’”) (quoting Ne. \n13 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 20   filed 07/17/19    PageID.857    Page 25 of 32\n \nFla. Chapter of Assoc. Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. \n656, 666 (1993)) (second and third alterations in original).  Further, the Dumont \ncourt recognized that the stigma of “personally encounter[ing] . . . unequal treatment \n. . . through that act of being turned away as prospective adoptive parents” was itself \nan injury.  See also Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, 922 F.3d 140, 164 (3d Cir. 2019).  \n(“The harm is not merely that gay foster parents will be discouraged from fostering.  \nIt is the discrimination itself.”)  Now CCWM seeks to again expose the Dumonts to \nunconstitutional unequal treatment and thus further practical and stigmatic injury.  \n(See Kristy Dumont Decl. ¶¶ 8–10; Dana Dumont Decl. ¶¶ 8–10.) \nThe Dumonts’ substantial interest in avoiding the injury that would \nresult from the relief sought by CCWM is well-recognized.  Usery v. Brandel, 87 \nF.R.D. 670, 676 (W.D. Mich. 1980) (“It is well-established that an applicant has ‘a \nsignificant protectable interest’ in rights which may be affected by interpretation in \na pending case. . . .”).  For example, in Grutter v. Bollinger, the Sixth Circuit found \nthat prospective minority applicants to the University of Michigan had a “direct, \nsubstantial, and compelling” legal interest to support intervention as of right in a \nlawsuit brought by white applicants challenging the University’s race-conscious \nadmissions policy, where the proposed intervenors’ chances of “gaining admission \nto  the  University”  could  be  impacted  if  the  University  were  ordered  to  stop \nconsidering race as a factor in admissions.  188 F.3d at 399–400; see also Coal. to \n14 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 20   filed 07/17/19    PageID.858    Page 26 of 32\n \nDefend Affirmative Action v. Granholm, 240 F.R.D. 368, 371, 375 (E.D. Mich. 2006) \n(granting motion to intervene by white prospective applicant to University in lawsuit \nchallenging state constitutional amendment “bar[ring] the use of race, sex, color, \nethnicity, or national origin to promote diversity in public hiring, contracting, and \nuniversity admission decisions” because “if the present plaintiffs are successful in \nobtaining  a  ruling  that  the  constitutional  amendment  is  invalid,  [proposed \nintervenor’s] chances of gaining admission . . . may be diminished”).  Here too, the \nDumonts have a “direct, substantial, and compelling” legal interest in the resolution \nof CCWM’s claims; if CCWM’s claims are successful, the protections against \ndiscrimination that they secured in the Dumont Settlement Agreement would be \neviscerated.  \nC.  The Dumonts’ Interests May Be Impaired Without Intervention. \nThe Dumonts meet the “minimal” burden to show that “impairment of \n[their] substantial legal interest is possible if intervention is denied.”  Miller, 103 \nF.3d at 1247.  Here, the Dumonts’ substantial legal interests in preserving the relief \nobtained through their Settlement Agreement and avoiding further constitutional \ninjury may be impaired without intervention because if CCWM succeeds in their \nclaims, the Dumonts’ Settlement Agreement would become meaningless and the \nDumonts’ constitutional rights would again be infringed.  The Dumonts dismissed \n15 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 20   filed 07/17/19    PageID.859    Page 27 of 32\n \ntheir previous claims in exchange for a settlement that provided them the relief they \nsought, and would be left without recourse.   \nJansen  is  directly  on  point.    There,  the  Sixth  Circuit  found  that \n“disposition of the present action without the proposed intervenors would indeed \nimpair or impede their ability to protect their rights guaranteed under the consent \ndecree” because the resolution of the pending litigation could leave the defendant \n“with obligations to the proposed intervenors under the consent decree that are \ninconsistent with its obligations to plaintiffs” and any finding about the consent \ndecree  would  bind  the  proposed  intervenors  “in  any  subsequent  enforcement \nactions.”  904 F.2d at 342.  Likewise, here, adjudication of CCWM’s claims could \npreclude the Dumonts from enforcing the Settlement Agreement if it prevails on its \nclaims that the Constitution gives it the right to obtain a government contract to \nperform public child welfare services and use religious eligibility criteria when \nperforming  those  services  to  turn  away  qualified  families  headed  by  same-sex \ncouples.  The Dumonts have a right to intervene in this case to protect the Settlement \nAgreement that protects them from facing further discrimination, and defend against \nan inconsistent resolution in this Court of the constitutionality of the State’s practice \nwith respect to its adoption and foster care contracts. \n16 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 20   filed 07/17/19    PageID.860    Page 28 of 32\n \nD.  No Other Party Adequately Represents the Dumonts’ Interests. \nFinally, the Dumonts are entitled to intervene as of right because no \ncurrent party adequately represents their interests.  In assessing the final prong under \nRule 24(a)(2), the Sixth Circuit has explained that “proposed intervenors are ‘not \nrequired to show that representation will in fact be inadequate.’”  Grutter, 188 F.3d \nat 400 (quoting Miller, 103 F.3d at 1247).  Instead, a proposed intervenor need only \nshow that representation may be inadequate, including by showing “that the existing \nparty who purports to seek the same outcome will not make all of the prospective \nintervenor’s arguments.”  Id.  The burden of showing inadequate representation \n“should be treated as minimal.”  Trbovich v. United Mine Workers of Am., 404 U.S. \n528, 538 n.10 (1972). \nWhile the existing Defendants may seek the same relief as the Dumonts \nand may make some of the arguments that the Dumonts would make,3 based on the \nparties’  positions  in  the  Dumont  action,  and  their  respective  papers  filed  in \nopposition to the motion for preliminary injunction in the related case of Buck et al. \n                                                 \n3  For example, both may argue that there is nothing in the Free Exercise or Free \nSpeech Clauses that entitles a private organization to force the government to offer \nit a contract to perform a government service even though it is unwilling to comply \nwith the contract’s terms.  See Fulton, 922 F.3d at 158, 161 (no likelihood of success \non claim that enforcing non-discrimination policy in public foster care contracts \nviolates free exercise or free speech rights of agencies that have religious objection \nto complying). \n17 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 20   filed 07/17/19    PageID.861    Page 29 of 32\n \nv.  Gordon  et  al.,  1:19-cv-00286-RJJ-PJG  (W.D.  Mich.  2019),  the  Dumonts \nanticipate that they will assert different arguments than the Defendants in defense of \nthe State’s practice of enforcing the non-discrimination provision in its adoption and \nfoster care contracts with CPAs.  For example, the Dumonts will argue that allowing \nstate-contracted,  taxpayer-funded  CPAs  to  exclude  same-sex  couples  based  on \nreligious  grounds—the  relief  requested  by  CCWM—would  violate  the \nEstablishment and Equal Protection Clauses.4  When the Dumont Plaintiffs made \nthese very arguments in Dumont, the State Defendants did not concur; rather, they \nmoved to dismiss and argued against them.  See Grutter, 188 F.3d at 401 (“The \nproposed intervenors . . . have presented legitimate and reasonable concerns about \nwhether  the  University  will  present  particular  defenses  of  the  contested  race-\nconscious admissions policies.”); Meriwether v. Trs. of Shawnee State Univ., 2019 \nWL 2052110, at *12 (S.D. Ohio May 9, 2019) (no adequate representation where \nproposed intervenors “articulated specific and reasonable concerns that [defendant] \nwill not present their relevant defenses under Title IX, the Equal Protection Clause, \nand other anti-discrimination laws”). \n                                                 \n4   The Dumonts also intend to assert heightened equal protection scrutiny for \ndiscrimination against married same-sex couples, a position the State Defendants \ncontested in Dumont. \n18 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 20   filed 07/17/19    PageID.862    Page 30 of 32\n \nII.  IN  THE  ALTERNATIVE,  THE  COURT  SHOULD  EXERCISE  ITS \nDISCRETION TO ALLOW PERMISSIVE INTERVENTION. \nShould  the  Court  determine  that  the  Dumonts  are  not  entitled  to \nintervene as of right, the Court should exercise its discretion pursuant to Rule \n24(b)(1) to grant permissive intervention.  Permissive intervention is appropriate \nwhere a prospective intervenor’s claim or defense shares with the pending litigation \n“a  common  question  of  law  or  fact,”  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  24(b)(1)(B),  and  where \nintervention will not “unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the \noriginal parties.”  Purnell, 925 F.2d at 951.  In this case, for the reasons stated above \nand in the Proposed Answer, both CCWM and the Dumonts raise claims or defenses \nrelated  to  whether  the  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  United  States \nConstitution  require  the  State  to  permit  state-contracted  CPAs  to  violate  the \ncontracts’ non-discrimination requirement that includes sexual orientation.  Granting \nthe Dumonts’ motion to intervene will not result in delay or undue prejudice because \nthe case is in its very early stages and proposed intervenors are prepared to proceed \naccording to the schedule set by the Court. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, we respectfully ask that the Court grant \nthe Dumonts’ motion to intervene in this Action. \n \n \n19 \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 20   filed 07/17/19    PageID.863    Page 31 of 32\n \nDated:  July 17, 2019   \n  Respectfully submitted, \n \n  s/ Ann-Elizabeth Ostrager \n   \nJay Kaplan (P38197)  Leslie Cooper \nDaniel S.

R. Civ. P. 65, \nrequiring Defendants to comply with Mich. Comp. Laws §§ 722.124e, \n722.124f, 710.23g, and 400.5a, and enjoining them from enforcing a new \npolicy against Catholic Charities that forces the religious organization \nto start recommending and facilitating foster and adoptive placements \nwith same-sex couples in violation of its religious beliefs or be stripped \nof the ability to provide such services to children in Michigan’s child \nwelfare system—a religious ministry that Catholic Charities has been \nperforming for over 70 years. In support of this motion, Catholic \nCharities states as follows: \n1.  On May 15, 2019, Catholic Charities filed a motion for \npreliminary injunction while this case was pending before the Michigan \nCourt of Claims; \n2.  Before the Michigan Court of Claims could rule on that \nmotion, however, Defendants removed the case to this Court; \n3.  To preserve its rights and avoid any prejudice, Catholic \nCharities is refiling its motion for preliminary injunction in \nconformance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 65 and Local Rules 7.1 and 65.1. \n4.  Nevertheless, Catholic Charities contends that this Court is \nnot the proper venue for this case. Catholic Charities filed a motion to \nchange venue to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of \nMichigan on June 19, 2019. (See ECF No. 9.)  \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.589    Page 4 of 40\n5.  The proper venue for hearing this case and motion is the \nWestern District of Michigan. \n6.  As explained in more detail in the accompanying brief, a \npreliminary injunction is warranted. In short, Defendants’ new policy \nviolates Catholic Charities’ statutory and constitutional rights; Catholic \nCharities and the children and families it serves will suffer irreparable \nharm in the absence of a preliminary injunction; the balance of \nhardships tips strongly in Catholic Charities’ favor; and protecting \nCatholic Charities’ rights and the children and families it serves is in \nthe public interest.  \n7.  A preliminary injunction is necessary to preserve the Court’s \nability to render a meaningful decision on the merits. \n8.  In support of this motion, Catholic Charities relies on the \naccompanying brief, the Declaration of Chris Slater, and the Verified \nComplaint (see ECF No. 1-2). \n9.  Pursuant to Local Rule 7.1(a), Plaintiff’s counsel conferred \nwith Defendants’ counsel, explained the nature of this motion and its \nlegal basis, and requested but did not obtain concurrence in the relief \nsought. \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.590    Page 5 of 40\nDated:  June 26, 2019  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n   \n  /s/David Cortman       \nJames R.

Despite this, \nDefendants are acting to reduce the services available to foster children, \nimplementing a new policy in April 2019 that promises to exclude \nCatholic Charities from serving unless it affirmatively recommends \nsame-sex couples as foster and adoptive parents.1  \nThis new policy does not help a single child find a home; it only \ncoerces effective, caring, and reliable providers out of the system. It also \nblatantly violates statutory protections for faith-based providers, which \nguarantee that private child placing agencies cannot be compelled to \nprovide services that conflict with their “sincerely held religious beliefs.” \nMich. Comp. Laws §§ 722.124e(2), 722.124f(1). Although Defendant \nAttorney General Dana Nessel believes that the “only purpose” of those \nlaws is “to discriminate against people,”2 that religious providers like \nCatholic Charities “dislike gay people more than [they] care about the \n                                      \n1 Although Catholic Charities cannot recommend or facilitate child \nplacements with same-sex couples consistent with its faith, it will refer \nsuch couples to other child placing agencies and routinely serves them \nthroughout its numerous other ministries. (Slater Decl. ¶¶ 14, 16.) \n2 Ed White, Dem AG candidate: Adoption law discriminates against \ngays, Associated Press (Sept. 27, 2018), https://bit.ly/2Fq3YgU. \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.601    Page 16 of 40\nneeds of foster kids,”3 and that such providers are “hate mongers,”4 \nDefendants cannot run roughshod over the Legislature. Nor may they \nviolate Catholic Charities’ free-exercise and free-speech rights protected \nby the Michigan and U.S. Constitutions.  \nA preliminary injunction is thus absolutely essential, not just to \nprevent statutory and constitutional violations and the shuttering of a \n70-plus-year old religious ministry, but also to prevent irreversible \nharm to the families and children entrusted to Catholic Charities’ care. \nIndeed, having partnered with the State for decades, Catholic Charities \nmanages hundreds of foster-care-related cases. By preserving the status \nquo, this Court can guarantee that foster families licensed through \nCatholic Charities will continue to receive reimbursement payments \nneeded to care for their children; ensure that foster children maintain \nthe crucial relationships they have spent months and years developing \nwith Catholic Charities’ case workers; and guard against foster children \nbeing traumatically transferred, once again, to new families.  \n                                      \n3 Rick Pluta, Faith-based adoption bills headed to House floor, Michigan \nRadio NPR (Mar. 4, 2015), https://bit.ly/2KCYAet.  \n4 Fox 2 Detroit, Opponents say adoption bill discriminates against gays \nand lesbians (Mar. 5, 2015, 10:43 AM), https://bit.ly/2Dcr49R; see also \nDana Nessel (@dananessel), Twitter (Apr. 14, 2019, 1:57 PM), \nhttps://bit.ly/2Ya8bwp.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.602    Page 17 of 40\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA.  Catholic Charities’ services are religious ministry \nmotivated by religious beliefs. \n  Catholic Charities is a nonprofit religious organization affiliated \nwith the Roman Catholic Diocese of Grand Rapids that has been feeding \nthe hungry, counseling those who struggle, and building strong families \nfor over 70 years. (Slater Decl. ¶ 3, attached as Ex. 1.) It is one of \nwestern Michigan’s largest social services providers, offering a broad \nspectrum of child welfare, family preservation, behavioral health, and \ncommunity outreach services. (Id. ¶ 6.)  \nAs a Catholic organization, Catholic Charities believes and \nadheres to the teachings and doctrines of the Catholic Church. (Id. ¶ 5.) \nIts services are offered in accord with Catholic social teaching and \ndesigned to support individuals and families in their “emotional, social \nand spiritual development.” (Id. ¶ 5.) Serving a diverse community, \nCatholic Charities ministers to over 21,000 individuals each year \nwithout regard to race, religion, sex, marital status, gender identity, \nsexual orientation, or any other protected characteristic. (Id. ¶ 6.) \nCatholic Charities also obeys historic teachings of scripture and \nthe Church by providing foster care and adoption services to vulnerable \nchildren. (Id. ¶ 7; Verified Compl. (“VC”) ¶¶ 23–26, 53 [ECF No. 1-2].) \nAs one of Michigan’s largest providers, Catholic Charities has \napproximately 100 employees dedicated exclusively to foster care and \nadoption services, and about 170 licensed foster homes ready to help \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.603    Page 18 of 40\nchildren in need. (Slater Decl. ¶ 8.) Catholic Charities has over 300 \nfoster children in its care and custody each day, and serves about 450 \nfoster children annually. (Id.) In the past decade, Catholic Charities has \nplaced around 4,500 children in loving adoptive or foster homes. (Id.) \nTo be clear about and protect its religious beliefs, Catholic \nCharities has a written statement of faith for its foster care and \nadoption ministry. (Id. ¶ 9.) While Catholic Charities cannot \nrecommend or facilitate child placements with same-sex couples \nwithout violating its Catholic faith, it will refer such couples to other \nchild placing agencies and routinely serves them throughout its \nnumerous other ministries. (Id. ¶¶ 14, 16.)  \nB.  Michigan Public Acts 53, 54, and 55 protect Catholic \nCharities’ beliefs and practices. \nIn 2015, the Michigan Legislature enacted Public Acts 53, 54, and \n55, expressly protecting the right of faith-based foster care and adoption \nproviders to operate according to their consciences and beliefs. Mich. \nComp. Laws §§ 722.124e, 722.124f, 710.23g, and 400.5a.  \nUnder these laws, “a child placing agency” cannot be forced to \nprovide services or accept referrals from the State that conflict with its \n“sincerely held religious beliefs.” Id. §§ 722.124e(2), 722.124f(1), \n710.23g.5 Further, the child placing agency retains “sole discretion” to \n                                      \n5 A “child placing agency” is defined as a governmental organization or \nnonprofit agency organized “for the purpose of receiving children for \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.604    Page 19 of 40\ndecide whether to perform pre-referral activities and services “related to \nthat referral,” such as recruiting, training, studying, and recommending \nprospective foster care and adoptive parents. Id. Because such services \nare not publicly funded, see id. § 722.124e(1)(h), the government “shall \nnot control the child placing agency’s decision whether to engage in \nthose activities or perform those services.” Mich. Comp. Laws § \n722.124f(1). If an agency is unable to provide any service due to its \nreligious beliefs, it must “[p]romptly refer” the “applicant” to a list of \nother providers or to a provider “that is willing and able to provide the \ndeclined services.” Id. § 722.124e(4).  \nNor may the government “cancel[ ] the child placing agency’s \nfunding,” “cancel[ ] a contract with the child placing agency,” or take \nany other “adverse action” against an agency that has declined any \nservice or referral based on its religious beliefs. Id. §§ 722.124e(3), \n722.124f(2), 710.23g, 400.5a.  \nIn enacting these statutory protections, the Michigan Legislature \nfound that faith-based organizations “have a long and distinguished \nhistory” of providing foster care and adoption services in Michigan, that \nallowing them to continue serving consistent with their faith \nconvictions “will benefit the children and families who receive publicly \nfunded services,” and that “[h]aving as many possible qualified adoption \n                                      \nplacement in private family homes for foster care or for adoption.” Mich. \nComp. Laws § 722.111(d). \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.605    Page 20 of 40\nand foster parent agencies” is “a substantial benefit” to children in \nneed. Mich. Comp. Laws §§ 722.124e(1)(c), (f) & (g). The Legislature \nfurther found that private agencies “have the right to free exercise of \nreligion,” including the right to “abstain from conduct that conflicts with \n[their] sincerely held religious beliefs.” Id. § 722.124e(1)(e). \nC.  Catholic Charities partners with DHHS to serve \nMichigan’s foster children. \nIn Michigan, there are about 13,000 children in foster care.6 While \nthis incredible need is largely met by private child placing agencies, \nprivate agencies are prohibited from overseeing foster care placements \nor facilitating foster care adoptions unless they enter into an agreement \nto accept referrals from DHHS. (Slater Decl. ¶ 22.) Under such \nagreements, DHHS reimburses the approved agency for foster or \nadoption services provided to referred children, at agreed rates. (Id. ¶¶ \n18–19.) Recognizing the “long and distinguished history” that both \n“[f]aith-based and non-faith-based child placing agencies have for \nproviding adoption and foster care services in this state,” Mich. Comp. \nLaws § 722.124e(1)(f), DHHS contracts with a broad spectrum of both \nfaith-based and secular agencies. (Slater Decl. ¶ 17.)  \nFor decades, the State has entered into agreements with Catholic \nCharities to serve Michigan’s abused, neglected, and abandoned \nchildren. (Id. ¶ 18.) And for good reason. Catholic Charities exceeds \n                                      \n6 MDHHS, Hope for a Home, https://bit.ly/2XvIYQi.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.606    Page 21 of 40\nstate minimum requirements, offering a plethora of extra services that \nare paid for entirely through private contributions, including \nhealthcare, clothing, transport, extracurricular funds, and even a \n“Family Visit House.” (Id. ¶ 21.) Because of its distinctly religious \nnature and beliefs, Catholic Charities also attracts foster and adoptive \nparents that the State and secular agencies do not, and cannot, recruit.  \n(Id. ¶ 10.) While Catholic Charities does not limit those it serves to any \nparticular religion, it successfully recruits many foster families and \nadoptive parents who share its faith and religious beliefs. (Id. ¶ 10.) \nUnder its current contracts, DHHS refers both foster care and \npublic adoption services to Catholic Charities, agreeing to reimburse \nCatholic Charities for certain services performed. These agreements \nacknowledge that Catholic Charities “has the sole discretion to decide \nwhether to accept or not accept a referral.” (VC, Ex. 6 at 7; Ex. 7 at 5.) \nFor foster care referrals, DHHS provides a per diem to cover expenses \nonce the child is placed with a foster family. (Slater Decl. ¶ 19.) While \nCatholic Charities retains a portion to help cover its own costs, the rest \ngoes to the foster family to defray the costs of caring for the child. (Id.) \nFor public adoption referrals, DHHS provides lump sum payments \nwhenever the child is placed, the adoption is finalized, and the adoption \nbecomes permanent. (Id.) DHHS generally does not pay for any of \nCatholic Charities’ pre-placement services such as training, studying, \nand recommending parents for foster care or adoption. (Id. ¶ 20.) \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.607    Page 22 of 40\nD.  Defendants adopt a new policy that violates state law \nand targets Catholic Charities’ religious beliefs. \nDHHS’s decades-long respect for Catholic Charities’ religious \nbeliefs changed shortly after Dana Nessel was elected attorney general \nin 2018. Before her election, Ms. Nessel stated that the “only purpose” \nof Michigan’s statutory protections for faith-based foster care and \nadoption providers was “to discriminate against people” and she \nattacked religious providers like Catholic Charities as “hate mongers.” \n(VC ¶¶ 141– 42.) Promptly after her election, AG Nessel instructed \nDHHS to settle a lawsuit challenging the State’s longstanding practice \nof accommodating faith-based providers’ religious beliefs. DHHS settled \nthat lawsuit in March 2019, essentially agreeing to violate Michigan \nlaw by excluding faith-based providers from serving Michigan’s foster \nchildren unless they agreed to recommend same-sex couples as foster \nand adoptive parents. (VC, Ex. 8.) \nIn April 2019, Defendants sent a directive to Michigan’s child \nplacing agencies, including Catholic Charities, purporting to implement \nthe settlement. (VC, Ex. 9.) The directive says that “regardless of \nwhether the individual or couple being considered has identified a \nparticular child for foster or adoptive placement,” Catholic Charities can \nno longer refer a same-sex couple to another agency or decline to \nrecruit, train, evaluate, or recommend a same-sex couple as prospective \nfoster or adoptive parents. (VC, Ex. 9 at 1–2.) If Catholic Charities \n“refuses to comply” with this new policy, the directive states that \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.608    Page 23 of 40\nDefendants will terminate Catholic Charities’ contracts, and thus \nprohibit it from serving foster children. (VC, Ex. 9 at 2.) \nRELEVANT LEGAL STANDARD \nIn deciding whether to grant a preliminary injunction, a court \nmust consider “(1) the likelihood of success on the merits; (2) \nirreparable harm absent injunctive relief; (3) substantial harm to others \nfrom the proposed injunction; and (4) the broader public interest.” Nat’l \nCredit Union Admin Bd. v. Jurcevic, 867 F.3d 616, 622 (6th Cir. 2017). \n“The purpose of a preliminary injunction is always to prevent \nirreparable injury so as to preserve the court’s ability to render a \nmeaningful decision on the merits.” United Food & Commer. Workers \nUnion, Local 1099 v. Sw. Ohio Reg’l Trans. Auth., 163 F.3d 341, 348 \n(6th Cir. 1998). The Sixth Circuit thus recognizes that “preservation of \nthe court’s ability to exercise meaningful review may require \naffirmative relief in order to prevent some future irreparable injury.” Id. \nARGUMENT \nI.  The new policy violates Michigan’s statutory protections \nfor faith-based foster care and adoption providers. \nThe Michigan Legislature anticipated situations like this one. In \n2015, it enacted Public Acts 53, 54, and 55, expressing its will that \nMichigan “child placing agencies” remain “free[ ] to abstain from \nconduct that conflicts with [their] sincerely held religious beliefs.” Mich. \nComp. Laws § 722.124e(1)(e). Because Defendants’ new policy violates \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.609    Page 24 of 40\nboth the text and intent of those laws, Catholic Charities is likely to \nsucceed on its state statutory claim (Count I).   \nWhen the U.S. Supreme Court issued its same-sex marriage \nruling in 2015, it determined that believing marriage is a union of one \nman and one woman is a “decent and honorable” belief that continues to \nbe held “in good faith by reasonable and sincere people.” Obergefell v. \nHodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2594, 2602 (2015). And because the First \nAmendment protects that belief, “religious organizations and persons” \nmust be “given proper protection” to “continue the family structure they \nhave long revered.” Id. at 2607.  \nPublic Acts 53, 54, and 55 provide this “proper protection.” \nTogether, they guarantee that faith-based providers like Catholic \nCharities can continue to serve foster children consistently with their \nreligious beliefs, while at the same time ensuring that no person’s \nability to adopt or participate in foster care is denied.  \nSpecifically, under Public Act 53, DHHS may not cancel or refuse \nto renew a contract or take any other “adverse action” against a child \nplacing agency whose sincerely held religious beliefs prevent it from \nproviding “any service” or accepting a referral. Mich. Comp. Laws §§ \n722.124e, 722.124f. Although the law does not allow an agency to \ndecline “foster care case management and adoption services” for a \nparticular child after it accepts a referral to perform those services, id. § \n722.124e(7)(b), the agency can decline the referral “if the services would \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.610    Page 25 of 40\nconflict with” its religious beliefs, id. § 722.124f(1). Further, Public Act \n53 clarifies that the child placing agency retains “sole discretion” to \ndecide whether to perform pre-referral activities and services “related to \nthat referral,” such as recruiting, training, studying, and recommending \nprospective foster care and adoptive parents. Id.  \nPublic Act 54 bolsters these religious protections by extending \nthem to all adoption services, including foster-care-related adoptions. \nId. § 710.23g. Public Act 55, which amended the law regulating DHHS, \nreiterates that “the department shall not take an adverse action against \na child placing agency” because the agency has not or will not provide \nservices that conflict with its beliefs. Id. § 400.5a.        \nHere, Defendants’ new policy violates both “the purpose and \nintent” of these laws. Adair v. Michigan, 785 N.W.2d 119, 125 (Mich. \n2010). Defendants threaten to “terminate” the contracts needed to serve \nfoster children if Catholic Charities continues to follow its sincerely held \nreligious beliefs and “refuses to comply” with the new policy by \n“referring” same-sex couples to other providers, or by declining to train, \nevaluate, or license such couples as prospective foster or adoptive \nparents. (VC, Ex. 9 at 2.) But Public Acts 53, 54, and 55 forbid \nDefendants from taking adverse action on these grounds. While \nDefendants may disagree with the legislative policies reflected in those \nlaws, they are not at liberty to impose contradictory ones and ignore \nwhole statutes. \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.611    Page 26 of 40\nII.  The new policy violates Catholic Charities’ free-exercise \nand free-speech rights under the Michigan and U.S. \nConstitutions. \nAlthough Michigan’s strong statutory protection makes reaching \nthe other claims unnecessary, a preliminary injunction is also \nwarranted because Catholic Charities is likely to succeed on its state \nand federal constitutional claims. \nA.  Strict scrutiny applies under Article I, § 4 of the \nMichigan Constitution. \nThe Michigan Constitution, which includes a free exercise clause, \nan establishment clause, and a freedom of conscience and to worship \nclause, provides broader religious protections than its federal \ncounterpart. Mich. Const. 1963, art 1, § 4; Country Mill Farms, LLC v. \nCity of East Lansing, 280 F. Supp. 3d 1029, 1056 (W.D. Mich. 2017). \nCourts evaluate alleged violations of Article 1, § 4 of the Michigan \nConstitution using a five-factor compelling-interest test that asks: (1) \nwhether plaintiff’s belief, or conduct motivated by belief, is sincerely \nheld; (2) whether that belief or conduct is religious; (3) whether that \nbelief or conduct is burdened by state action; (4) whether that burden is \njustified by a compelling state interest; and (5) whether the state could \nsatisfy its interest through a less obtrusive regulation. Country Mill, \n280 F. Supp. 3d at 1056. In other words, if government action burdens \nsincere religious beliefs, it must pass strict scrutiny. Defendants cannot \nsatisfy that test. \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.612    Page 27 of 40\nThe first two elements—the sincerity and religious nature of \nCatholic Charities’ beliefs—are easily satisfied here. (See Slater Decl. \n¶¶ 9, 14; VC ¶¶ 22–32.) As to the third element, Defendants’ new policy \nheavily burdens Catholic Charities’ religious beliefs and practices. \nIndeed, if Catholic Charities follows its beliefs about marriage, \nDefendants will cancel its contracts and in fact bar it from ministering \nto children by providing any foster services. This substantially burdens \nCatholic Charities’ religion because it “coerce[s]” Catholic Charities \n“into violating [its] religious beliefs” and “penalize[s] religious activity \nby denying [Catholic Charities] an equal share of the rights, benefits, \nand privileges enjoyed by other citizens.” People v. DeJonge, 501 N.W.2d \n127, 136 (Mich. 1993) (quoting Lyng v. Nw. Indian Cemetery Protective \nAss’n, 485 US 439, 449 (1988)).  \nBecause Defendants’ new policy substantially burdens Catholic \nCharities’ sincerely held religious beliefs and practices, it must survive \nstrict scrutiny under the fourth and fifth elements. As explained below, \nit cannot satisfy that heightened level of review. \nB.  Strict scrutiny applies under the Free Exercise Clause \nof the U.S. Constitution. \nThe new policy also triggers, and fails to satisfy, strict scrutiny \nunder the federal free exercise clause for several independent reasons. \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.613    Page 28 of 40\n1. The new policy completely excludes Catholic \nCharities from a long-established religious ministry \nbecause of its beliefs about marriage. \nAlthough courts often evaluate federal free-exercise claims under \nEmployment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), that case does not \nalways govern. The Supreme Court has rejected the idea that “any \napplication” of a neutral and generally applicable law is “necessarily \nconstitutional under the Free Exercise Clause.” Trinity Lutheran \nChurch of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 137 S. Ct. 2012, 2021 n.2 (2017).  \nIn Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & School v. \nEEOC, 565 U.S. 171 (2012), for example, the Supreme Court \nunanimously held that the government may not apply a neutral and \ngenerally applicable nondiscrimination law to a religious school if it \nwould interfere with the school’s selection of its teachers and ability to \noperate consistently with its faith. And in Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd v. \nColorado Civil Rights Comm’n, 138 S. Ct. 1719, 1727 (2018), the Court \nagreed that the government could not invoke a nondiscrimination rule \nto compel clergy “to perform [a same-sex wedding] ceremony,” \nregardless of whether the government imposed that rule on secular \nofficiants and regardless of any offense caused to same-sex couples. \nThe same respect and deference to Catholic Charities’ religious \nautonomy is owed here. Like clergy’s involvement in marriage \nceremonies and the church’s involvement in education, religious groups \nhave been serving orphans and abandoned children for centuries. The \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.614    Page 29 of 40\ngovernment cannot now drive them off the field, demanding that they \nbow the knee to the government’s preferred views on topics that have \nalways been central to religious faith and teachings: marriage, family, \nand the proper raising of the next generation. The Free Exercise Clause \nprohibits the government from conducting such a hostile takeover of \nlong-established religious ministries—whether that be marriages \n(Masterpiece), schools (Hosanna-Tabor), or caring for abused, neglected, \nand abandoned children. \n2. The new policy discriminates against Catholic \nCharities by conditioning a government benefit on \ngiving up its religious beliefs and identity. \nIn Trinity Lutheran, 137 S. Ct. at 2021, the Supreme Court held \nthat any “policy [which] expressly discriminates against otherwise \neligible recipients by disqualifying them from a public benefit solely \nbecause of their religious character … imposes a penalty on the free \nexercise of religion that triggers the most exacting scrutiny.” There, the \nCourt concluded that the State of Missouri could not exclude a church-\noperated preschool and daycare from a playground safety grant \nprogram because of the preschool’s religious nature. 137 S. Ct. at 2025. \nThe Free Exercise Clause, the Court explained, forbids the government \nfrom requiring an organization “to renounce its religious character in \norder to participate in an otherwise generally available public benefit \nprogram, for which it is fully qualified.” Id. at 2024.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.615    Page 30 of 40\nYet that is precisely what the new policy does. Defendants are \nconditioning a public benefit—the ability to participate in state foster \ncare and adoption programs and receive reimbursement payments—on \nCatholic Charities’ willingness to renounce its religious beliefs and \ncharacter as it pertains to marriage and family. Such a rule “imposes a \npenalty on the free exercise of religion that must be subjected to the \nmost rigorous scrutiny.” Id. \n3. The new policy singles out religious beliefs and is \nbased on religious hostility.  \nThe government may in certain circumstances be permitted to \n“burden faith-based conduct” through the enforcement of “neutral and \ngenerally applicable rules.” Ward v. Polite, 667 F.3d 727, 738 (6th Cir. \n2012) (citing Smith, 494 U.S. at 890). However, when the policy or rule \n“appears to be neutral and generally applicable on its face, but in \npractice is riddled with exemptions or worse is a veiled cover for \ntargeting a belief or a faith-based practice,” id., it “must run the \ngauntlet of strict scrutiny.” Id. at 740.  \nHere, Defendants’ new policy is hostile, not neutral. Instead of \nprotecting faith-based providers as Michigan law requires, the new \npolicy penalizes religious providers that adhere to certain beliefs about \nmarriage and family that are despised by AG Nessel (and DHHS under \nher instruction). Indeed, the new policy immediately followed the \nState’s settlement of a lawsuit challenging its partnership with certain \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.616    Page 31 of 40\nfaith-based providers, and the plain text of the policy demonstrates that \nits purpose is to single out those providers’ religious beliefs and \npractices. (VC, Ex. 9 at 1–2) (describing prohibited practices exclusively \nin terms of declining services to “LGBTQ individual[s]” or “same-sex \ncouple[s],” despite assertion that policy was enforcing broad \nnondiscrimination provision). The Supreme Court has made clear that a \nlaw or regulation is not neutral if its practical effect or “object” is to \n“infringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious \nmotivation.” Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, \n508 U.S. 520, 533–34 (1993). \nMoreover, the driving force behind the new policy—AG Nessel—\nhas labeled those that share Catholic Charities’ beliefs about marriage \nas “a radical fringe,” “reprehensible,” and “hate mongers,” and \ndisparaged them as “dislik[ing] gay people more than [they] care about \nthe needs of foster care kids.” (VC ¶¶ 138–42.)7 Through both actions \nand words, Defendants have violated their “duty under the First \nAmendment not to base laws or regulations on hostility to a religion or \nreligious viewpoint.” Masterpiece, 138 S. Ct. at 1731. \n                                      \n7 Defendant Nessel’s assertion that religious service providers are \nignoring the needs of foster children is false and grimly ironic, since \nDHHS does not dispute that Catholic Charites has an outstanding \nrecord of placing children rapidly and placing them in healthy \nenvironments. It is Defendant Nessel and DHHS that are seeking to \ndeny the children of Michigan the benefit of these services solely to \nenforce their ideology and punish dissent. \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.617    Page 32 of 40\n4. The new policy is woefully underinclusive. \nThe new policy also triggers strict scrutiny because it is not \n“generally applicable.” In Lukumi, the Supreme Court struck down an \nordinance that prohibited ritual animal sacrifice but allowed animal \nkillings in many other contexts. The Court explained that a law is not \ngenerally applicable if it exempts nonreligious conduct that undermines \nthe government’s interests “in a similar or greater degree than \n[religious conduct] does.” 508 U.S. at 543–44. \nThe State’s purported interest here is eliminating discrimination \nin child placements, but the new policy cannot be reconciled with the \nmultitude of regulations and organizations that discriminate on other \nprotected characteristics. In fact, Michigan regulations require child \nplacing agencies to assess prospective foster and adoptive parents based \non otherwise protected characteristics such as race, religion, gender, \nand marital status. For example, agencies must assess applicants’ \n“[m]arital and family status” and “[s]pirituality or religious beliefs.” \nMich. Admin. Code, R. 400.12310(3)(a), R. 400.12605(3)(a). They must \nalso make placements based on the applicants’ preferred “gender, race, \n[and] ethnic background.” Id., R. 400.12605(3)(k), R. 400.12709(2), R. \n400.12310(3)(h), R. 400.12404(3). Moreover, agencies must take into \naccount the “child and child’s family’s religious preference” when \nmaking foster placements, id., R. 400.12404(4)(d), and consider race, \nethnicity, and cultural identity when recruiting adoptive parents, id., R. \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.618    Page 33 of 40\n400.12706(2)(b). Because these exemptions undermine any claimed \ninterest in “nondiscrimination” as much or more than Catholic \nCharities’ faith-driven selections, strict scrutiny applies. Lukumi, 508 \nU.S. at 543–44. \nC.  Strict scrutiny applies because the new policy \ncompels Catholic Charities’ speech. \nA preliminary injunction should also issue because Defendants’ \nnew policy would require Catholic Charities to convey, in writing, \nrepeatedly, an opinion that it believes to be false—namely, that same-\nsex parents will be in the child’s best interests. This violates both the \nFirst Amendment and the Michigan’s free speech guarantee.8 \nA long line of Supreme Court precedent precludes the government \nfrom forcing a citizen “to utter what is not in his mind,” W. Va. State \nBd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 634 (1943), or to affirm “a belief \nwith which the speaker disagrees,” Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, \nLesbian & Bisexual Group of Boston, 515 U.S. 557, 573 (1995). Courts \nthus apply strict scrutiny to government actions that compel speech, \nparticularly when sincere religious beliefs are at stake. See, e.g., Hurley, \n515 U.S. 557 (1995) (using public accommodations law to force a parade \nto include an LGBT group was compelled speech).  \n                                      \n8 Thomas M. Cooley Law Sch. v. Doe 1, 833 N.W.2d 331, 348 (Mich. Ct. \nApp. 2013) (“right to free speech under the Michigan Constitution is \ncoterminous with the right to free speech under the First Amendment”). \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.619    Page 34 of 40\nNor does “professional speech”—that is, speech made by \n“individuals who provide personalized services to clients and who are \nsubject to a generally applicable licensing and regulatory regime”—\nreceive diminished constitutional protection. Nat’l Institute of Family & \nLife Advocates v. Becerra, 138 S. Ct. 2361, 2371–72 (2018) (state \nregulation forcing pro-life pregnancy centers to publish notices about \nabortion failed strict scrutiny).  \nStrict scrutiny thus applies here. Catholic Charities evaluates \ncandidate foster and adoptive parents, and must provide written \nassessments and recommendations to the State about whether \nparticular candidate parents should be approved, and whether it is in \nthe best interests of particular children to be placed in particular \nhomes. (Slater Decl. ¶ 13.) The new policy would force Catholic \nCharities to affirm, in official submissions to the State, that placements \nwith same-sex couples will be in the best interests of children, when in \nfact Catholic Charities’ religious beliefs about human nature, marriage, \nand family teach it that those placements will not be in the best \ninterests of children. Doing so would “alter the content of [Catholic \nCharities’] speech,” and strict scrutiny must apply. Id. at 2371. \nD.  The new policy, as applied to Catholic Charities, does \nnot survive strict scrutiny. \nBecause strict scrutiny applies, Defendants must prove that their \nnew policy “advance[s] interests of the highest order and [is] narrowly \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.620    Page 35 of 40\ntailored in pursuit of those interests.” Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 546. \nDefendants cannot satisfy this “highest level of review.” Susan B. \nAnthony List v. Driehaus, 814 F.3d 466, 473 (6th Cir. 2016). \nTo determine whether there is a compelling interest, courts must \n“scrutinize the asserted harm of granting specific exemptions to \nparticular religious claimants.” Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, 573 U.S. 682, \n726–27 (2014) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Even \n“plausible hypotheses are not enough to satisfy strict scrutiny,” \nContractors Ass’n of E. Pa. v. City of Phila., 6 F.3d 990, 1008 (3d Cir. \n1993), and “ambiguous proof will not suffice,” Brown v. Entm’t Merchs. \nAss’n, 564 U.S. 786, 800 (2011). Accordingly, generalized speculations or \nassertions do not even come close to satisfying strict scrutiny.  \nHere, there is no compelling governmental interest in forcing \nCatholic Charities to violate its faith to continue its religious ministry \nto foster children. Rather, the policy undermines the State’s asserted \ninterest in “[h]aving as many possible qualified adoption and foster \nparent agencies” serving “the children of this state.” Mich. Comp. Laws \nAnn. § 722.124e. The policy, if it is not enjoined, will result in faith-\nbased agencies like Catholic Charities no longer being allowed to \nprovide placement services to foster kids, thereby diminishing the \nalready scarce resources available to these needy children.  \nDefendants may assert that they are generally interested in \nstopping “discrimination,” but such “broadly formulated interests” are \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.621    Page 36 of 40\ninsufficient to carry the heavy burden under strict scrutiny. Hobby \nLobby, 573 U.S. at 726–27. And in any event, closer inspection shows \nthat the State’s own actions undermine any interest it ostensibly has in \neliminating discrimination. As noted, Michigan law contains numerous \nexemptions allowing child placing agencies—including state-operated \nones—to make distinctions based on otherwise protected characteristics \nsuch as race, religion, gender, and marital status in foster care and \nadoption licensing and placements.  \nIn fact, Defendants concede that private child placing agencies \nmay decline referrals from DHHS for any reason. (See VC, Ex. 8 at 5.) \nSo, for example, if DHHS referred a same-sex couple for licensing, \nCatholic Charities would be allowed to decline the referral based on its \nreligious beliefs. But under the challenged policy, if that same couple \nwalked into Catholic Charities’ office on their own accord, Catholic \nCharities could not refer the couple to another agency without being \npunished by the State. This makes no sense. Requiring Catholic \nCharities to train, study, and recommend same-sex couples as adoptive \nor foster parents in violation of its religious beliefs “cannot be regarded \nas protecting an interest of the highest order” when existing exemptions \nalready permit “appreciable damage to that supposedly vital interest.” \nLukumi, 508 U.S. at 547. \nNor can Defendants show that their policy is the least restrictive \nmeans of satisfying their purported interest. This requirement is \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.622    Page 37 of 40\n“exceptionally demanding” and requires the government to “sho[w] that \nit lacks other means of achieving its desired goal without imposing a \nsubstantial burden on the exercise of religion by the objecting part[y].” \nHobby Lobby, 573 U.S. at 728. A policy fails this prong if the “interests \ncould be achieved by narrower [policies] that burde[n] [the right] to a \nfar lesser degree.” Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 546.  \nAnd here, the State legislature has already identified a less \nrestrictive alternative. Faith-based providers can refer to numerous \nother child-placing agencies when needed to abide by their sincerely \nheld religious beliefs. Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 722.124e(4). \nAdditionally, the policy fails because Michigan law allows—and in some \ncases requires—agencies to make distinctions based on other protected \ncharacteristics. Forcing Catholic Charities to choose between its \nreligious beliefs and serving vulnerable children is thus unnecessary. \nSee Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 546 (“underinclusive” ordinances cannot \nsatisfy strict scrutiny). \nIII.  A preliminary injunction would prevent Catholic Charities \nfrom suffering irreparable harm, result in no harm to \nanyone, and be in the public interest. \nThe remaining preliminary injunction factors—irreparable harm, \nbalance of equities, and public interest—also weigh in favor of a \npreliminary injunction. \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.623    Page 38 of 40\nAgain, Defendants’ new policy violates Catholic Charities’ \nconstitutional rights. And the loss of constitutional rights, “for even \nminimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.” \nElrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976). Furthermore, because a child \nplacing agency is prohibited from performing foster care and public \nadoption services in the absence of a contract with DHHS, the new \npolicy would force Catholic Charities to close its 70-plus-year-old \nministry to foster children. (Slater Decl. ¶¶ 22–23.) \nThe balance of equities likewise weighs in favor of Catholic \nCharities. A preliminary injunction would prevent statutory and \nconstitutional violations and protect the hundreds of children and \nfamilies in Catholic Charities’ care while this case is pending. \nPreserving the status quo as it has existed for decades would not \nirreparably harm Defendants because same-sex couples interested in \nfostering or adopting may do so through numerous other agencies, \nincluding state-operated ones. Moreover, Defendants can have no \nlegitimate interest in violating existing law or enforcing an \nunconstitutional policy. See Bays v. City of Fairborn, 668 F.3d 814, 825 \n(6th Cir. 2012) (“[I]f the plaintiff shows a substantial likelihood that the \nchallenged law is unconstitutional, no substantial harm to others can be \nsaid to inhere its enjoinment.”).  \nFinally, protecting constitutional rights “is always in the public \ninterest.” G & V Lounge, Inc. v. Michigan Liquor Control Comm., 23 \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 11   filed 06/26/19    PageID.624    Page 39 of 40\nF.3d 1071, 1079 (6th Cir. 1994). So too is ensuring that faith-based \nproviders like Catholic Charities can continue providing adoption and \nfoster care services “to the children of this state who are in need of these \nplacement services.” Mich. Comp. Laws § 722.124e(1)(c) As the \nMichigan Legislature recognized, “the more qualified agencies taking \npart in this process, the greater the likelihood that permanent child \nplacement can be achieved.” Id. \nCONCLUSION \nBecause existing state law and the Michigan and U.S. \nConstitutions prohibit Defendants from forcing Catholic Charities to \nchoose between its religious beliefs and serving vulnerable and needy \nchildren, this Court should grant the requested preliminary injunction. \n \nDated:  June 26, 2019  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n  /s/David Cortman       \nJames R.

The Supreme Court unanimously held that it \ndoes. This notice explains why the unanimous ruling supports Catholic \nCharities’ pending motion for preliminary injunction. See Lee v. \nMcDonald, No. 05-CV-60238-AA, 2008 WL 597287, at *1 (E.D. Mich. \nMar. 3, 2008) (“The filing of such notices of supplemental authority has \nprecedent in this district.”). \nSubstantial Burden. First, Fulton makes clear that Defendants’ \npurported nondiscrimination policy substantially burdens Catholic \nCharities’ religious exercise.  \nDefendants have argued that their policy does not burden religion \nbecause it just asks Catholic Charities “to assess whether an Applicant \nmeets legal licensing requirements, not to endorse any relationship.” \nECF No. 22, PageID.929. Not so. Fulton explains that because Catholic \nSocial Services (CSS) sincerely believed “certification” was “tantamount \nto endorsement,” the city was not just asking CSS to apply “statutory \ncriteria.” 2021 WL 2459253, at *4. Rather, it was putting CSS to the \n“choice of curtailing its mission or approving relationships inconsistent \nwith its beliefs.” Id. This made it “plain” that the city’s actions \nsubstantially burdened CSS’s religious exercise. Id. at *4. So too here.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 49, PageID.2004   Filed 06/22/21   Page 4 of 9\nGeneral Applicability. Next, Fulton shows that the challenged \npolicy is not generally applicable—and thus subject to strict scrutiny.  \nIn Fulton, the city asserted that its nondiscrimination policy \ncategorically prohibited CSS from declining to certify a same-sex couple \nas foster parents based on CSS’s beliefs about marriage. But the \nrelevant contract provision allowed exceptions at the city’s “sole \ndiscretion.” 2021 WL 2459253, at *5. This created “a system of \nindividual exemptions,” making the policy not generally applicable. Id. \nat 6. And it did not matter if the city had ever granted an individualized \nexemption; the Court held that the existence of a “formal mechanism for \ngranting exceptions” alone destroyed general applicability. Id. at *7. \nThe same analysis again applies here. Like Philadelphia, \nDefendants insist that their foster care and adoption contracts \ncategorically prohibit discrimination. But those contracts, like \nPhiladelphia’s contract, allow for exceptions. Child placing agencies \nmay “decline the referral” of a child or individual for any reason. ECF \nNo. 1-2, PageID.85, 141; accord ECF No. 22, PageID.942 (admitting an \nagency “may decline a referral of a child or individual in need of foster \ncare and adoption services for any reason”). And even when agencies \naccept a referral, they can “refer the case back to the Department . . . \nupon the written approval of the County Director, the Children’s \nServices Agency Director, or the Deputy Director.” ECF No. 1-2, \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 49, PageID.2005   Filed 06/22/21   Page 5 of 9\nPageID.85, 141 (emphasis added). This “written approval” is not based \non any objective standards but given at the Department’s discretion.1    \nTo be sure, Defendants may say they refuse to grant any \nexceptions in practice, no matter what the contracts say. See ECF No. \n22, PageID.935 (“No CPA can claim a religious exception”). But Fulton \nsays that doesn’t matter: “The creation of a formal mechanism for \ngranting exceptions renders a policy not generally applicable, regardless \nwhether any exceptions have been given.” 2021 WL 2459253, at *7.  \nIt also does not matter that the exception language and \nnondiscrimination provision are in separate sections of the contracts. \nSee id. (rejecting same argument). As Fulton explains, the exceptions \n“also must govern” the nondiscrimination provision, lest the \n“reservation of the authority to grant such an exception be a nullity.” Id.  \nNor can Defendants evade Fulton by arguing that they do not \nrefer prospective foster and adoptive parents, so that the “system of \nindividual exemptions” applies only to referrals of children. See ECF \nNo. 22, PageID.935 (suggesting this argument in footnote 3). Indeed, \nthe contracts contradict that argument. Referrals are made for “foster \ncare case management services” and “adoption services.” ECF No. 1-2, \n \n1 The contracts’ exceptions are required by state law. See Mich. Comp. \nLaws § 722.124e(2) (agency “shall not be required to provide any \nservices” that conflict with its religious beliefs); id. § 722.124f(1) (agency \nmay decline referral for “foster care case management or adoption \nservices” if the services would conflict with its religious beliefs). \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 49, PageID.2006   Filed 06/22/21   Page 6 of 9\nPageID.85, 141. And Defendants have said those services include the \nevaluation and certification of prospective foster and adoptive parents. \nSee ECF No. 22, PageID.935. Moreover, the contracts explicitly \nreference the fact that MDHHS will make “referrals” of “relative \ncaregivers” to agencies “for possible licensure of a foster family home.” \nECF No. 1-2, PageID.94.  \nIn any event, referring only children (and stopping referrals of \nprospective parents) would not make the challenged policy generally \napplicable. Defendants cannot insist on nondiscrimination at one stage \nof the process (parent certification) yet completely disregard that \npurported interest at another (child referral). Said another way, \nDefendants cannot insist a faith-based agency certify a same-sex couple \nin violation of its beliefs while allowing another agency to decline a \nchild referral because the child would be placed with a same-sex couple \n(e.g., when a relative would be first in line to foster or adopt the child). \nBecause the latter situation “undermines the government’s asserted \ninterests in a similar way” to the former, such a policy would not be \ngenerally applicable. Fulton, 2021 WL 2459253, at *5.2  \n \n2 The policy also is not generally applicable because it allows child \nplacing agencies to assess prospective parents based on otherwise \nprotected characteristics such as race, religion, gender, and marital \nstatus. See ECF No. 11, PageID.617-618; Tandon v. Newsom, 141 S. Ct. \n1294, 1296 (2021) (policy is not “generally applicable . . . whenever [it] \ntreat[s] any comparable secular activity more favorably than religious \nexercise”). \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 49, PageID.2007   Filed 06/22/21   Page 7 of 9\nWhether for a child or prospective parent, the decisive point is \nthat an agency may decline the referral for any reason and may even \nsend accepted referrals back to the Department upon written approval. \nSuch a policy “invites the government to decide which reasons for not \ncomplying with the policy are worthy of solicitude.” Fulton, 2021 WL \n2459253, at *7. Strict scrutiny therefore applies. \nStrict Scrutiny. Finally, Fulton shows that the challenged policy \ncannot survive strict scrutiny.3 \nDefendants say two compelling state interests justify any religious \nburden caused by their policy: (1) “ending invidious discrimination”; and \n(2) “maximizing the number of qualified foster and adoptive parents.” \nECF No. 22, PageID.943-44. But the city made the same two arguments \nin Fulton. Not one Justice found them compelling. \nAs for ending discrimination, the Fulton Court stated that courts \ncannot rely on “broadly formulated interests” but must “scrutinize the \nasserted harm of granting specific exemptions to particular religious \nclaimants.” 2021 WL 2459253, at *8. The question, then, is not whether \nthe government has “a compelling interest in enforcing its non-\ndiscrimination policies generally, but whether it has such an interest in \n \n3 Besides its federal free-exercise claim, strict scrutiny also applies to \nCatholic Charities’ other constitutional claims. And its free-exercise \nclaim under the Michigan Constitution triggers strict scrutiny \nregardless of whether the challenged policy is neutral or generally \napplicable. See ECF No. 11, PageID.611-612. \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 49, PageID.2008   Filed 06/22/21   Page 8 of 9\ndenying an exception to [Catholic Charities].” Id. Thus, when “properly \nnarrowed,” the “asserted interests are insufficient.” Id. at *9 (explaining \nthat the system of exemptions “undermines” the “contention that its \nnon-discrimination policies can brook no departures”). \nAs for “[m]aximizing the number of foster families,” the Supreme \nCourt noted that was a worthy goal. Id. But it determined that granting \na religious exception would not put that goal at risk. Id. “If anything,” \nthe Court explained, “including CSS in the program seems likely to \nincrease, not reduce, the number of available foster parents.” Id. The \nsame is true here. As the Michigan Legislature has found, excluding \nfaith-based providers like Catholic Charities does not further any \ncompelling state interest; it only undermines it. See Mich. Comp. Laws \n§ 722.124e(1)(c) & (f) (it is “a substantial benefit to the children” to have \n“as many possible” qualified agencies, and “faith-based . . . child placing \nagencies have a long and distinguished history of providing adoption \nand foster care services in this state”). \n \nDated:  June 22, 2021  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n  /s/ Jeremiah Galus     \n  Jeremiah Galus (AZ Bar #030469) \n  Alliance Defending Freedom \n15100 N. 90th Street \nScottsdale, AZ 85260 \n(480) 444-0020 \njgalus@ADFlegal.org \n   \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 49, PageID.2009   Filed 06/22/21   Page 9 of 9\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \n  I hereby certify that on June 22, 2021, I caused the foregoing to be \nfiled with the Clerk of the Court using the ECF system, which will \nprovide electronic copies to counsel of record. \n \n/s/ Jeremiah Galus     \nJeremiah Galus (AZ Bar #030469) \nAlliance Defending Freedom \n15100 N. 90th Street \nScottsdale, AZ 85260 \n(480) 444-0020 \njgalus@ADFlegal.org \n \n8 \n ",

Defendants are subject to potentially competing and \ncontrary legal obligations to two different parties who sued \nor are suing the State in different courts.  The first is two \nformer plaintiffs in Dumont et al. v. Gordon et al., Case No. \n17-cv-13080 (E.D. Mich. Borman, J.), demanding that the \nDepartment enforce its nondiscrimination policy against \nPlaintiff Catholic Charities West Michigan and threatening \nto file an enforcement action with United States District \nCourt Judge Borman. The second is Plaintiff Catholic \nCharities West Michigan requesting that this Court \npreliminarily enjoin Defendants from enforcing the State’s \nnondiscrimination policy against it.  Should this Court grant \nexpedited consideration of Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary \ninjunction to avoid the risk of having different courts impose \non Defendants competing and contrary legal obligations to \ntwo different parties? \n \n2.  Federal courts have discretion to certify questions of state \nstatutory interpretation to a state’s highest court to promote \ncooperative judicial federalism and efficiencies and to avoid \nthe potential for friction-generating error.  Michigan courts \nhave not had the occasion to interpret 2015 PA 53, codified \nas Michigan Compiled Laws §§ 722.124e and 722.124f \n(2015), to determine whether it authorizes state-contracted \nchild placing agencies to refuse to provide state-supervised \nchildren with state-contracted services that conflict with an \nagency’s sincerely held religious beliefs.  Should this Court \ncertify to the Michigan Supreme Court the question of the \nproper interpretation of 2015 PA 53? \n \nv \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1591    Page 15 of 40\n \nINTRODUCTION \nDefendants are facing potentially competing and contrary legal \nobligations to two different parties who sued or are suing the State in \ndifferent courts.  The first is two former plaintiffs in Dumont et al. v. \nGordon et al., Case No. 17-cv-13080 (E.D. Mich. Borman, J.), \ndemanding that the Department enforce its nondiscrimination policy \nagainst Plaintiff Catholic Charities West Michigan (“Catholic \nCharities”) and threatening to file an enforcement action with United \nStates District Court Judge Borman.  The other is Plaintiff Catholic \nCharities West Michigan, seeking to preliminarily enjoin Defendants \nfrom enforcing the State’s nondiscrimination policy against it.  Stuck \nbetween a rock and a hard place, Defendants respectfully requested \nexpedited consideration of Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction–\n–namely to decide whether Catholic Charities is likely to succeed on the \nmerits of its state and federal claims under its erroneous interpretation \nof state law.  No state court has interpreted this statute, and an \ninterpretation is critical before plenary litigation proceeds. \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1592    Page 16 of 40\n \nAs for the state law at issue, the parties agree that Michigan law1 \nauthorizes a state-contracted child placing agency (“CPA”) to reject a \nMichigan Department of Health and Human Services (“MDHHS” or \n“Department”) referral of a state-supervised child needing foster care \ncase management or adoption services for any reason, including the \nCPA’s sincerely held religious beliefs.2  Michigan law also authorizes a \nCPA to refuse to provide private and direct adoption services that \nconflict with the CPA’s sincerely held beliefs.3 \nBut the parties are diametrically opposed on the legal issue of \nwhether Michigan law authorizes a state-contracted CPA to refuse to \nprovide state-supervised children in the agency’s care with state-\ncontracted foster care case management and adoption services that \nconflict with the CPA’s sincerely held religious beliefs.   And no state \ncourt has interpreted Mich. Comp. Laws §§ 722.124e and 722.124f. \nMichigan’s highest state court is the proper court to have the first \nopportunity to interpret this important state-law question.  The proper \n \n1 The Michigan law at issue is 2015 Public Act 53, codified as Michigan \nCompiled Laws § 722.124e and § 722.124f. \n2 Mich. Comp. Laws § 722.124f  (2015). \n3 Mich. Comp. Laws § 722.124e(2) and (4) (2015). \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1593    Page 17 of 40\n \ninterpretation is a matter of first impression, unique to Michigan, and \nsignificant to the State’s jurisprudence. \nRather than predicting what the state court might do, this Court \nshould certify to the Michigan Supreme Court the question of the \nproper interpretation of 2015 Public Act 53, codified as Mich. Comp. \nLaws §§ 722.124e and 722.124f  (the “2015 Michigan law”).  Specifically, \nthis Court should certify:  \nWhether the 2015 Michigan law authorizes a child placing \nagency (CPA) under contract with the state to provide foster \ncare case management or adoption services, to refuse to \nprovide state-supervised children with contracted services \nthat conflict with the CPA’s sincerely held religious beliefs.   \nCertifying this question to the Michigan Supreme Court advances \ncooperative judicial federalism and conserves federal judicial resources.  \nCertification also recognizes and respects the state court’s authority and \ninterest in interpreting state law in the first instance on significant \nstate jurisprudential issues.   \nThe Michigan Supreme Court’s interpretation of the 2015 \nMichigan law will assist this Court in analyzing key issues in this case \nand could be dispositive.  Moreover, certifying this question to the \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1594    Page 18 of 40\n \nMichigan Supreme Court will not cause undue delay or prejudice, as \nthere is a Motion for Preliminary Injunction pending before this Court.    \n \nFACTS \nOn March 22, 2019, the Department entered into a settlement \nagreement with Dana and Kristy Dumont and Rebecca and Erin Busk-\nSutton, the plaintiffs in Dumont et al. v. Gordon et al., Case No. 17-cv-\n13080 (E.D. Mich. Borman, J.), to dispose of the claims in the litigation \n(the “Settlement Agreement”).  (Exhibit 1.)  That same day, the \nDepartment and the Dumont plaintiffs filed a Stipulation of Voluntary \nDismissal with Prejudice, with the executed Settlement Agreement \nattached as Exhibit A.  (Dumont, Case No. 17-cv-13080, ECF No. 82.)  \nJudge Borman entered an order dismissing the Dumont plaintiffs’ \nclaims “with prejudice pursuant to the terms of the Settlement \nAgreement” and retaining jurisdiction over the enforcement of the \nSettlement Agreement.  (Dumont, Case No. 17-cv-13080, ECF No. 83, \nPageID.1469.)   \nUnder the terms of the Settlement Agreement, unless prohibited \nby law or court order, the Department is required to enforce its \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1595    Page 19 of 40\n \nlongstanding nondiscrimination policy (Non-Discrimination Provision) \nagainst a child placing agency (CPA) “that the Department determines \nis in violation of, or is unwilling to comply with” the Provision, up to \nand including terminating the CPA’s foster care case management \nservices contract or adoption services contract.4  (Exhibit 1, Settlement \nAgreement, Section 1(c).) \nOn April 25, 2019, Plaintiff Catholic Charities West Michigan \n(Catholic Charities) initiated the instant lawsuit against the \nDepartment and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel in her official \ncapacity (collectively, Defendants), challenging the Department’s long-\nestablished nondiscrimination policy as violative of state and federal \nlaw and the Michigan and U.S. constitutions.5   \n \n4 The Settlement Agreement acknowledges that the Department’s \ncontracts for foster care case management services and adoption \nservices mandate “that contracted CPAs comply with the Department’s \nnon-discrimination statement prohibiting discrimination “against any \nindividual or group because of race, sex, religion, age, national origin, \ncolor, height, weight, marital status, gender identity or expression, \nsexual orientation, political beliefs, or disability” in the provision of \nservices under contract with the Department (the “Non-Discrimination \nProvision”). \n5  Catholic Charities West Michigan originally filed its state and federal \nclaims in the Michigan Court of Claims.  (Court of Claims Case No. 19-\ncv-000072MM, Stephens, J.)  Michigan law prohibits claimants from \nfiling claims against the State and its departments in the Court of \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1596    Page 20 of 40\n \nOn June 26, 2019, Catholic Charities filed a motion for \npreliminary injunction, seeking to enjoin the State from taking adverse \naction against Catholic Charities for refusing to comply with the terms \nof it foster care case management services contract and adoption \nservices contract with the Department, as well as the Non-\nDiscrimination Provision.  (ECF No. 11.)  That motion was fully briefed \nas of August 7, 2019 and remains pending.  (ECF Nos. 22 and 25.)   \nIn correspondence dated January 23, 2020 (Exhibit 2, Exh. A), the \nDumonts invoked the notice and cure provision in Section 7 of the \nSettlement Agreement, demanding that the Department enforce the \nnondiscrimination provisions in its contracts with Catholic Charities, \nstating: \na.  “Catholic Charities West Michigan (‘Catholic Charities’), a \nMichigan state-contracted CPA, has made clear in its \nlitigation against the State, Catholic Charities v. Michigan \nDepartment of Health and Human Services et al., No. 2:l 9-\ncv-11661-DPHDRG (E.D. Mich.), that it will not comply with \nthe Non-Discrimination Provision of its Contracts and that it \nhas engaged and will continue to engage in practices \nprohibited by the Non-Discrimination Provision.” (Exhibit 2, \nExh. A, p. 1.) \n \n \nClaims where the claimant “has an adequate remedy upon his claim in \nthe federal courts.”  Mich. Comp. Laws § 600.6440.    \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1597    Page 21 of 40\n \nb.  Pursuant to Section 7 of the Settlement Agreement, the \nDepartment has ninety (90) days to cure noncompliance \nallegations. If the alleged breach is not cured within 90 days \nof notice, the Dumonts may take appropriate action to \nenforce their rights and seek specific performance of the \nSettlement Agreement. (Exhibit 2, Exh. A, p. 2.) \n \nDefendants believe the Settlement Agreement comports with state \nand federal law and is constitutionally firm.  They are defending the \nNon-Discrimination Provision in the instant case. \nThe Dumonts’ January 23, 2020 demand letter and Catholic \nCharities’ motion for preliminary injunction seek to impose potentially \ncompeting obligations on the Department.  This tension necessitates \nexpedited consideration of Catholic Charities’ motion for preliminary \ninjunction.  Otherwise, Defendants will be subject to two separate \nlawsuits pending before different judges in the same district court.  \nEach judge could reach different conclusions as to the main issue– \nwhether 2015 Public Act 53, Mich. Comp. Laws §§ 124e and 124f (2015 \nMichigan law), authorizes a child placing agency under contract with \nthe State to provide foster care case management or adoption services, \nto refuse to provide state-supervised children with contracted services \nthat conflict with the CPA’s sincerely held religious beliefs.   \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1598    Page 22 of 40\n \nMichigan courts have not had occasion to interpret the 2015 \nMichigan law.  In another case filed by St. Vincent Catholic Charities \nagainst Defendants (Buck et al. v. Gordon et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00286 \n(Jonker, J.))6, pending in the Western District of Michigan, Defendants \nasked Judge Jonker certify the following question of state law \ninterpretation to the Michigan Supreme Court: \nWhether the 2015 Michigan law authorizes a child placing agency \n(CPA) under contract with the State to provide foster care case \nmanagement or adoption services, to refuse to provide state-\nsupervised children with contracted services that conflict with the \nCPA’s sincerely held religious beliefs.  [Buck, E.D. Mich. Case No. \n1:19-cv-00286, ECF Nos. 87 and 88.] \n \nDefendants’ certification motion in Buck is fully briefed and \nremains pending before Judge Jonker.7  Defendants ask this Court to \ncertify this same question to the Michigan Supreme Court.   \n \n6 Chad and Melissa Buck and Shamber Flore, the individual plaintiffs \nin Buck v. Gordon, were dismissed as plaintiffs for lack of standing.  \n(Buck, E.D. Mich. Case No. 1:19-cv-00286, ECF No. 70.) \n7 Judge Jonker granted St. Vincent’s motion for preliminary injunction, \nenjoining Defendants from enforcing the State’s non-discrimination \npolicy if St. Vincent refuses to provide state-contracted services to state-\nsupervised children if such services conflict with its sincerely held \nreligious beliefs.  (Buck, E.D. Mich. Case No. 1:19-cv-00286, ECF No. \n69.)  Defendants appealed, and the Sixth Circuit denied Defendants’ \nmotion to stay the injunction pending appeal.  (Buck v. Gordon, Sixth \nCir. Case No. 19-2185, Docs. 29).  Defendants moved to voluntarily \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1599    Page 23 of 40\n \nConcurrent with filing this motion, Defendants filed a Notice \n(Brief, Exhibit 2) in Dumont et al. v. Gordon et al., Case No. 17-cv-13080 \n(Borman, J.), notifying Judge Paul D. Borman (i) that Defendants would \nbe filing this motion, and (ii) that the Dumont plaintiffs served notice on \nthe Department, demanding that it enforce its longstanding \nnondiscrimination policy—the same policy that Catholic Charities West \nMichigan moved this Court to enjoin Defendants from enforcing against \nCatholic Charities.  (ECF No. 11.)    \nARGUMENT \nI.  Expedited consideration of the motion for preliminary \ninjunction is necessary to avoid subjecting the State to \npotentially competing obligations. \nThe Department fully intends to continue enforcing its long-\nestablished nondiscrimination policy in accordance with the 2015 \nMichigan law.  But the Department is faced with a dilemma of \npotentially competing and contrary legal obligations.  It is a named \ndefendant in a separate lawsuit—also pending in this district—where it \n \ndismiss the appeal to file a motion to certify the question of statutory \ninterpretation and, thereafter, hasten a decision on the merits.  Id., \nDocs. 33 and 38.  St. Vincent opposed voluntarily dismissal, and the \nmotion remains pending.  Id., Doc. 34. \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1600    Page 24 of 40\n \nexecuted the Settlement Agreement and agreed to continue enforcing \nits long-established nondiscrimination policy.  (Buck et al. v. Gordon et \nal., Case No. 1:19-cv-00286 (Jonker, J.)).  Kristy and Dana Dumont, two \nof the plaintiffs in that case, allege the Department is not complying \nwith the Settlement Agreement and demand the Department enforce its \nnondiscrimination policy against Catholic Charities for refusing to \ncomply based on statements in its Complaint in this case.  (Exhibit 2.)  \nThe Dumonts indicate that they may seek to re-open the Dumont case \nand file an enforcement action under the Settlement Agreement.  \n(Exhibit 2.)  Meanwhile, Catholic Charities’ motion for preliminary \ninjunction is pending and seeks to preliminarily enjoin the Defendants \nfrom enforcing the nondiscrimination policy.     \nThese potentially competing and contrary legal obligations put the \nDepartment between a rock and a hard place.  This Court’s expedited \ndecision on the preliminary injunction motion will guide the \nDepartment’s conduct and minimize the risk of violating one court’s \norder.  Consequently, Defendants respectfully request that this Court \ngrant expedited consideration of the motion. \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1601    Page 25 of 40\n \nII.  An authoritative decision on the interpretation of the 2015 \nMichigan law by Michigan’s highest court is necessary to \ndetermine the nature of this case going forward and could \nbe outcome determinative. \nBoth federal and state courts recognize that a proper adjudication \nof a federal case may first require a state to authoritatively interpret its \nown law.  See, e.g., Cty. of Wayne v. Philip Morris, Inc., No. 99-76097, \n2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22956 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 25, 2000) (Exhibit 3); In \nre Certified Question (Wayne Cty. v. Philip Morris, Inc.), 638 N.W.2d \n409 (Mich. 2002).  This Court’s local court rules, as well as the Michigan \nCourt Rules, facilitate cooperation between federal and state courts by \nproviding mechanisms to request and accept certified questions of state \nlaw.  See E.D. Mich. L.Civ.R 83.40; Mich. Ct. Rule 7.308(A)(2).   \nCertification benefits federal courts because it “save[s] time, \nenergy, and resources and help[s] build a cooperative judicial \nfederalism.”  Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 77 \n(1997) (internal citation omitted).  Moreover, “[s]ubmitting uncertain \nquestions of state law to the state’s highest court by way of certification \nacknowledges that court’s status as the final arbiter on matters of state \nlaw and avoids the potential for ‘friction-generating error’ which exists \nwhenever a federal court construes a state law in the absence of any \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1602    Page 26 of 40\n \ndirection from the state courts.”  Planned Parenthood of Cincinnati \nRegion v. Strickland, 531 F.3d 406, 410 (6th Cir. 2008) (quoting \nArizonans for Official English, 520 U.S. at 79).   Both principles apply \nhere and warrant certifying the first-time question of the 2015 \nMichigan law’s interpretation to the Michigan Supreme Court. \nA.  The Michigan Supreme Court should have the \nopportunity to decide issues of first impression \nto its courts and of primary and jurisprudential \nsignificance to its citizens. \nThe importance of the 2015 Michigan law’s proper interpretation \nin this case cannot be overstated.  The U.S. Supreme Court and the \nSixth Circuit have recognized that importance.  See, e.g., Arizonans for \nOfficial English, 520 U.S. at 77; Bankey v. Storer Broadcasting Co., 882 \nF.2d 208, 210 (6th Cir. 1989) (Sixth Circuit unanimously certified \nquestion where the interpretation “proffered by appellant presents a \nquestion of Michigan law that is not controlled by Michigan Supreme \nCourt precedent.”)  Equally important is providing Michigan state \ncourts the first opportunity to decide significant issues of state \njurisprudence by interpreting state laws involving issues of state \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1603    Page 27 of 40\n \nconcern—in this case, children under the State’s care and supervision \nand in need of foster care case management and adoption services. \nSimilar to federal courts’ recognition of the value of certified \nquestions, the Michigan Supreme Court also recognizes the importance \nof accepting a certified question.  And it has accepted certified questions \nin cases like this, which present the “opportunity to clarify an important \naspect of Michigan [] law,” and provide “practical guidance and \ncertainty” for Michigan citizens.8   See In re Certified Questions (Bankey \nv. Storer Broadcasting Co.), 443 N.W.2d 112, 114, n.4 (Mich. 1989) \n(accepting certified question in an employment law case because it \nwould  “resolve some of the uncertainty” concerning the scope of an \nexception to Michigan’s at-will doctrine).   \n \n8 The Michigan Supreme Court accepts certified questions from both \nfederal district courts and the federal courts of appeal.  See In re \nCertified Question (Mattison v. Social Security Comm’r), 825 N.W.2d \n566, 567 (Mich. 2012) (certifying question from the U.S. District Court \nfor the Western District of Michigan); In re Certified Question (Philip \nMorris Inc., v. Jennifer Granholm, Attorney General, ex rel., State of \nMichigan), 638 N.W.2d 409 (Mich. 2002) (certifying question from the \nU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan); In re Certified \nQuestion (Deacon v. Pandora Media, Inc.), 885 N.W.2d 628 (Mich. 2016) \n(certifying question from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit). \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1604    Page 28 of 40\n \nNow is the appropriate time to present this certified question.  \nThe parties’ briefing on preliminary injunction relief and other matters \nis complete.  Neither federal judicial resources nor the parties’ time or \nresources has been expended on discovery and dispositive briefing prior \nto a final adjudication on the issues in this case.  See Heimbach v. \nAmazon.com Inc. (In re Amazon.com), 942 F.3d 297, 300 (6th Cir. 2019) \n(time to request certification is before the district court has resolved the \nissue); State Auto Property & Cas. Ins. Co. v. Hargis, 785 F.3d 189, 194 \n(6th Cir. 2015) (certification disfavored when it is sought only after the \ndistrict court has entered an adverse ruling on summary judgment); see \nalso BKB Props., LLC v. Suntrust Bank, 453 F. App’x 582, 588 (6th Cir. \n2011) (denying request for certification where movant failed to request \ncertification in the district court, “resulting in the considerable \nexpenditure of judicial resources by the federal courts on the issue.”).    \nAnother important consideration is that a proper interpretation of \nthe 2015 Michigan law is of significant interest to the State.  Foster \ncare legislation presents “issues of unusual delicacy, … where \nprofessional judgments regarding desirable procedures are constantly \nand rapidly changing[]” and warrants federal judicial restraint.  Smith \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1605    Page 29 of 40\n \nv. Org. of Foster Families for Equality and Reform, 431 U.S. 816, 855–\n56 (1977).   Additionally, Michigan courts recognize that “[t]he care and \nprotection of children has long been a matter of utmost state concern,” \neven when faced with allegations that state laws intended to facilitate \ncare and protection of children contradict the free exercise of religion.  \nFisher v. Fisher, 324 N.W. 2d 582, 584 (Mich. Ct. App. 1982). Certifying \nthe question of the 2015 Michigan law’s interpretation will allow the \nMichigan Supreme Court to determine whether the statute authorizes \nCPAs to refuse to provide state-supervised children with state-\ncontracted services that conflict with their sincerely held religious \nbeliefs.   \nNo Michigan state court has spoken on the proper interpretation \nof the 2015 Michigan law.  The Michigan Supreme Court should have \nthe first opportunity to interpret this important statute, and the \nposture of this case presents an opportune time to do that.  If the \nMichigan Supreme Court interprets the 2015 Michigan law as proposed \nby Catholic Charities, then this Court may not need to reach the \nconstitutional issues presented.  If, however, the Michigan Supreme \nCourt interprets the 2015 Michigan law as MDHHS does, then the \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1606    Page 30 of 40\n \nnature of this case could significantly change.  In either scenario, the \nclarification would resolve a crucial issue in this case, which in turn \nwould allow the case to proceed in a much more efficient manner.  \n1.  The interpretation of the 2015 Michigan law is a \nthreshold issue at the forefront of Catholic \nCharities’ state and federal claims.  \nThe proper interpretation of the 2015 Michigan law is at the heart \nof Catholic Charities’ state and federal claims.   Michigan courts have \nnot considered this important issue of state law, and the importance of \nhaving the State’s highest court interpret state law in the first instance \ncannot be overstated.      \nCount I of the Complaint alleges that Defendants violate the 2015 \nMichigan law by enforcing the State’s longstanding nondiscrimination \npolicy if Catholic Charities refuses to provide state-supervised children \nwith state-contracted services that conflict with its sincerely held \nreligious beliefs.  (Compl., ECF No. 1-2, PageID.51.)  And Catholic \nCharities describes the 2015 Michigan law as providing “proper \nprotection” for its First Amendment rights.   (PI Mot., ECF No. 11, \nPageID.609).  Thus, the question of proper interpretation cannot be \nseparated from Catholic Charities’ federal claims.   \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1607    Page 31 of 40\n \nYet, throughout its Complaint and in briefs filed in support of its \nmotion for preliminary injunction, Catholic Charities misinterprets and \nmisapplies the 2015 Michigan law.  Specifically, Catholic Charities \nclaims that the 2015 Michigan law “protects” the agency from adverse \naction by the Department in the event Catholic Charities refuses to \nprovide contracted-services to state-supervised children in care.  (See, \ne.g., Compl., ECF No. 1-2, PageID.41, ¶102  [“Generally, under these \nlaws, a ‘child placing agency’…cannot be required to provide services . . . \n.”]; PI Mot., ECF No. 11, PageID.603-604  [“Under these laws, a ‘child \nplacing agency’ cannot be forced to provide services . . . that conflict \nwith its ‘sincerely held religious beliefs.’”]).  But Plaintiff’s \ninterpretation is fatally flawed because it ignores the definition of \n“services” in Mich. Comp. Laws § 722.124e(7), which expressly excludes \nstate-contracted foster care case management and adoption services \nfrom the services that an agency can refuse to provide if in conflict with \nits sincerely held religious beliefs.  Thus, an agency can refuse to \nprovide private and direct placement services that conflict with its \nsincerely held religious beliefs––not state-contracted services for state-\nsupervised children in its care.  See Mich. Comp. Laws § 722.124e. \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1608    Page 32 of 40\n \nIn summary, the 2015 Michigan law allows a CPA to reject the \nDepartment’s referral of a child or individual in need of foster care case \nmanagement or adoption services.  But the 2015 Michigan law does not \nallow a CPA to refuse state-contracted services for those children for \nwhom the child-placing agency accepted the Department’s referral.  (See \nResp. to PI Mot., ECF No. 22, PageID.931-33, 935-36.)  To avoid this \nCourt speculating on how state courts might rule on this important \nstate law question involving a significant matter of state jurisprudence, \nthe Michigan Supreme Court should be given the opportunity to decide \nthis state law question first.     \nBecause the proper interpretation of the 2015 Michigan law is at \nthe forefront of this federal case and may control the outcome or, at the \nvery least, impact the nature of this case as the parties proceed on the \nmerits.  Cf. L.Civ.R. 83.40(a)(2).  This Court should grant the \nDefendants’ Motion.   \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1609    Page 33 of 40\n \n2.  The importance of asking the Michigan Supreme \nCourt to interpret state law first is not lessened \nbecause the State removed Plaintiff’s state and \nfederal claims from the Michigan Court of Claims \nto this Court.  \nAs explained above, Catholic Charities originally filed its \nComplaint––which asserts violations of state and federal law––in the \nMichigan Court of Claims.  (Court of Claims Case No. 19-cv-\n000072MM.)  The case was assigned to Judge Cynthia Stephens.  \nRather than dismissing the federal claims under Mich. Comp. Laws § \n600.6440 and litigating Catholic Charities’ state claims in state court \nand its federal claims in federal court, Defendants removed the case to \nthis Court (ECF No. 1).  But “removal does not foreclose the opportunity \nto seek certification[.]” Bailey v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., No. 14-53-\nHRW, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87744 (E.D. Ky. July 7, 2015) (denying \ncertification sought after receiving an unfavorable decision on a \ndispositive motion).  (Exhibit 4.)   \nFederal courts––including this Court––regularly certify questions \nof state law in cases, like this one, that are properly removed to federal \ncourt.  See, e.g., Cty. of Wayne v. Philip Morris, Inc., 2000 U.S  Dist \nLEXIS 22956, at *5 (Borman, J.) (granting certification after the case \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1610    Page 34 of 40\n \nwas removed from Wayne County Circuit Court to the United States \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Michigan) (Exhibit 3);  Eliason \nv. Clark County,  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48486 (USDC for Nevada \n2019)(granting defendant’s motion to certify after co-defendant removed \ncase) (Exhibit 5); Wigginton v. Centracchio, 205 F.3d 504, 507-08, 518  \n(1st Cir. 2000) (granting plaintiff’s motion to certify after removal based \non federal question jurisdiction); Vitanza v. Upjohn Co., 214 F.3d 73, 75 \n(2d Cir. 2000) (certifying question at plaintiff’s request after removal \nbased on diversity jurisdiction); Murray v. Alaska Airlines, Inc., 522 \nF.3d 920, 922-24 (9th Cir. 2008) (certifying question at plaintiff’s \nrequest after removal based on diversity jurisdiction).     \nUnlike in Bailey, Defendants’ request for certification here is \ntimely, as no issues in this case have been adjudicated on the merits.  \nIndeed, the Sixth Circuit has repeatedly held that “the appropriate time \nfor a party to seek certification of a state-law issue is before, not after \nthe district court has resolved the issue.”  Vance v. Amazon.com, Inc., \n852 F.3d 601, 607 (6th Cir. 2017) (internal citations and quotations \nomitted).  See also,  Heimbach v. Amazon.com, Inc., 942 F.3d 297, 300 \n(6th Cir. 2019) (granting a timely filed motion to certify and pointing to \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1611    Page 35 of 40\n \nthe timely filing as a distinction with an earlier case involving a similar \nquestion, but presented in a belated motion to certify.  Heimbach v. \nAmazon.com, Inc., 942 F.3d 297, 300 (6th Cir. 2019).   \nFurthermore, certification remains available and appropriate in \nthe event this Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over \nCatholic Charities’ state law claims.  Although the Michigan Supreme \nCourt’s decision on the certified question will not adjudicate Catholic \nCharities’ state law claims, its answer will provide an authoritative \ninterpretation of a controlling legal issue, i.e., the 2015 Michigan law, \nrelevant to Plaintiff’s federal claims.  See Bohus v. Restaurant.com, Inc., \n784 F.3d 918, 925-26 (3d Cir. 2015) (explaining that the answer to a \ncertified question decides a controlling issue of state law but does not \nindependently resolve a dispute in federal litigation).   \nIn summary, that this case was removed from state court to \nfederal court has no bearing on whether certification of a state law \nquestion is appropriate or available.  Because the proper interpretation \nof the 2015 Michigan law will likely control the outcome of Catholic \nCharities’ state and federal claims, this Court should exercise its \ndiscretion and grant Defendants’ motion to certify.   \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1612    Page 36 of 40\n \nB.  Certification of the proper interpretation of the 2015 \nMichigan law would clarify unsettled issues, affect the \nnature of this case going forward, and would not \ncause undue delay or prejudice. \nCertification rests in the discretion of this Court.  See E.D. Mich. \nL.Civ.R 83.40; Glover v. Nationwide Mutual Fire Ins. Co., 676 F. Supp. \n2d 602, 622 (W.D. Mich. 2009) (citing Lehman Brothers v. Schein, 416 \nU.S. 386, 390–91 (1974)).  And this Court should exercise its discretion \nto certify the question to the Michigan Supreme Court for three reasons.   \nFirst, there is no authoritative interpretation of the 2015 \nMichigan law on which this Court can rely, leaving it to predict how \nMichigan courts would decide the issue.  And, the state court's \ninterpretation of its own law is important here.  An authoritative \ninterpretation of the 2015 Michigan law from the Michigan Supreme \nCourt could “avoid in whole or in part the necessity for federal \nconstitutional adjudication” of Catholic Charities’ federal claims \nbecause the Department is required to follow state law.  Am. Booksellers \nFound. for Free Expression v. Strickland, 560 F.3d 443, 446 (6th Cir. \n2009) (quoting Bellotti v. Baird, 428 U.S. 132 (1976)).   \nFederal courts in the Sixth Circuit, faced with unsettled questions \nof interpretation of state law, have recognized the value of allowing the \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1613    Page 37 of 40\n \nMichigan Supreme Court to carry out its appropriate role of \ninterpreting Michigan law.  See, e.g., Cty. of Wayne v. Philip Morris, \nInc., 2000 U.S  Dist LEXIS 22956, at *7 (certifying question concerning \nthe scope of a Michigan official’s authority because there was no \ncontrolling precedent) (Exhibit 3); Thiss v. A.O. Smith Corp., No. 1:91-\nCV-239, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11846, at *6 (W.D. Mich. June 29, \n1993) (certifying question where district court had no basis to predict \nthe course of state law on what was “essentially a policy decision \nbetween competing doctrines.”) (attached as Exhibit 6).   \nSecond, the Michigan Supreme Court’s interpretation of the 2015 \nMichigan law could affect the outcome of this case, or at least materially \nchange the nature of the issues.  Even if having an authoritative \ninterpretation does not completely dispose of the case, it would likely \nsignificantly narrow the issues to be decided by this Court. \nThird, certification will not cause undue delay or prejudice.  Any \nrisk of delay is mitigated by having a proper interpretation of the 2015 \nMichigan law, which will conserve this Court’s “time, energy, and \nresources.” Lindenberg v. Jackson Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 912 F.3d 348, 371 \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1614    Page 38 of 40\n \n(6th Cir. 2018) (quoting Lehman Bros. 416 U.S. at 391) (internal \ncitation and quotation marks omitted)).   \nIn deciding Catholic Charities’ motion for preliminary injunction, \nthis Court will determine whether Plaintiff is likely to succeed on the \nmerits of its claims based on its proposed interpretation of the 2015 \nMichigan law.  But this Court’s decision on the preliminary injunctive \nmotion is not a decision on the merits of the case.  Whether preliminary \ninjunctive relief is granted, plenary litigation will proceed.  And the \ninterpretation of the 2015 Michigan law will play a pivotal role.  \nCertifying the question of statutory interpretation now, rather than \nlater, will avoid undue delay or prejudice and allow the parties to get to \nthe merits of the case quicker and more efficiently.      \nCONCLUSION AND RELIEF SOUGHT \nFor the reasons stated in their motion and this brief in support, \nDefendants respectfully request that grant expedited consideration of \nCatholic Charities’ motion for preliminary injunction, and certify to the \nMichigan Supreme Court the proper interpretation of 2015 PA 53, \ncodified as Michigan Compiled Laws § 722.124e and § 722.124f. \n \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 38   filed 02/20/20    PageID.1615    Page 39 of 40\n \nRespectfully submitted,   \n \nDana Nessel \nAttorney General \n \n \n/s/Toni L.

July 21, 2020), is not dispositive of the \nquestion before this Court.  This Court must decide whether Plaintiff \ncarried its burden of demonstrating entitlement to an extraordinary \nrelief – i.e., a preliminary injunction overriding Michigan law, \nMDHHS’s non-discrimination policy, and Plaintiff’s own voluntarily-\nentered, state-funded contracts, by essentially sanctioning \ndiscrimination in services provided to children in state-supervised care.   \n  As explained below, New Hope Family Services is instructive, but \nnot for the reasons Plaintiff asserts.  While the Second Circuit’s holding \nwas in favor of New Hope, a faith-based adoption agency which sought \nto operate in accordance with its religious beliefs, the analysis the \nappellate court used to arrive at this decision actually supports \nDefendants’ position in its response to Plaintiff’s motion for a \npreliminary injunction.  Plaintiff’s motion should be denied.  \n  Notably, the Second Circuit did not decide that New Hope was \nentitled to a preliminary injunction – as Plaintiff requests.  In fact, it \nremanded the case to the district court for this decision.  The Second \nCircuit merely held that New Hope’s pleadings were sufficient to state a \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 48   filed 08/04/20    PageID.1995    Page 4 of 9\n \nlegally cognizable claim.  New Hope Family Services, Inc. v. Poole,       \nNo. 19-1715, *8, *31 (2d Cir. July 21, 2020).  The sufficiency of \nPlaintiff’s pleadings is not at issue here.    \n  However, Plaintiff’s request for injunctive relief is– and as a \nresult, a markedly different standard applies.  In New Hope Family \nServices, the Second Circuit considered a motion to dismiss by \nappropriately accepting all factual allegations as true, drawing \nreasonable inferences in New Hope’s favor, and determining whether \nthe allegations – as pled – were sufficient to state a claim.  New Hope \nFamily Services, Inc. at *31.    \n  In this case, this Court must apply an entirely different analysis. \nPlaintiff seeks a preliminary injunction – an “extraordinary form of \nrelief” – which can only be granted if Plaintiff demonstrates, among \nother things, a substantial likelihood of success on the merits and that  \npublic interest is served by issuance of the injunction.  SEIU Local 1 v. \nHusted, 698 F.3d 341, 343-44 (6th Cir. 2012) (internal citations and \nquotations omitted).  As Defendants explained in their response to \nPlaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction, Plaintiff has not satisfied \nits burden with respect to any of the four factors and,  therefore, \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 48   filed 08/04/20    PageID.1996    Page 5 of 9\n \nPlaintiff’s  motion should be denied.  (Defs.’ Resp., Doc. 22, Page ID # \n935-51.)  \n  The reasons the Second Circuit provided to distinguish New \nHope’s claims from those of Catholic Social Services, in Fulton v. City of \nPhiladelphia, 922 F.3d 140 (3d Cir. 2019), cert. granted, 140 S.Ct 1104, \ndemonstrate this.  In Fulton, the Third Circuit upheld denial of a \npreliminary injunction brought on behalf of a faith-based provider of \nfoster care services, which would have allowed it to carry out \ncontracted-services counter to the City’s nondiscrimination policy.   \n  The Second Circuit found New Hope Family Services distinct from \nFulton because the relationship between the parties in Fulton was \n“contractual and compensatory” and, also, Fulton involved a motion for \na preliminary injunction – not a motion to dismiss.  New Hope Family \nServices, Inc. at *41-42.  Applying this same analysis demonstrates the \nthat the Third Circuit’s analysis and holding in Fulton applies here.  \n  The distinction of the standard of review has been addressed \nabove.  At issue here (as in Fulton) is Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary \ninjunction, and, as the Second Circuit emphasized, “[n]owhere in Fulton \ndoes the Third Circuit suggest that CSS’s allegations, if assumed true, \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 48   filed 08/04/20    PageID.1997    Page 6 of 9\n \nwere insufficient to state a Free Exercise claim.”  New Hope Family \nServices, Inc. at *42.  The same is applicable here.       \n  The distinction in the parties’ relationship is even more \nsubstantial.  Unlike New Hope Family Services, the relationship \nbetween Plaintiff and MDHHS is “contractual and compensatory.”  Cf. \nNew Hope Family Services, Inc. at *41-42.  As explained in Defendants’ \nresponse, “[a]ll CPAs sign the same master contract for foster parent \nand adoption services.” (Defs.’ Resp., Doc. 22, Page ID # 928.)  And \nPlaintiff acknowledges that it receives compensation for these services. \n(Pl.’s Mot., Doc. 10, Page ID # 606.) \n  This is significant.  The Sixth Circuit has already recognized that \na government-funded contract does not provide a forum for protected \nspeech, nor does the free exercise clause authorize an entity operating \npursuant to this contract to re-write that contract to accommodate its \nreligious beliefs.  Teen Ranch v. Udow, 479 F.3d 403. (6th Cir. 2007).  \nThis precedent is binding.  It is also important because the services that \nPlaintiff provides are to children in state-supervised care.  The State’s \ninterest in setting the terms for these contracted-for services is \nsignificant, while Plaintiff’s ability to facilitate private, direct \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 48   filed 08/04/20    PageID.1998    Page 7 of 9\n \nplacement adoption services is not in dispute.  Plaintiff’s motion should \nbe denied.  \n  Also important in the Second Circuit’s analysis was a question \nwhether the regulation at issue was consistent with the statute it \npurported to implement.  New Hope Family Services, Inc. at *44-45.   \nNot so here.  As the Defendants explained in their response to the \nmotion for preliminary injunction, MDHHS neutral, non-discrimination \npolicy aligns with Michigan law.  Under Michigan law and MDHHS \npolicy, every CPA – regardless of any religious affiliation – may accept \nor reject a referral of a child or individual in need of foster care and \nadoption services for any reason.  However, no CPA may discriminate in \nservices provided to such child or individual, under the publicly funded \nfoster care case management and adoption contracts.  (See Defs.’ Resp., \nDoc. 22, Page ID # 934-35; see also Mich. Comp. Laws § 722.124f(1) and \nMich. Comp. Laws § 722.124e(7).)  Home studies, orientations and \ntrainings provided to prospective foster care and adoptive parents are \nservices provided under these publicly-funded contracts, and Plaintiff’s \ncomplaint seeks the right to discriminate in the provision of them.  To \nthe extent there is a question of state law, Defendants request this \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-11661-DPH-DRG   ECF No. 48   filed 08/04/20    PageID.1999    Page 8 of 9\n \nCourt certify this question to the Michigan Supreme Court – the \nappropriate forum for resolving unanswered questions of state law.  \n(Defs.’ Mot., Doc. 39, Page ID # 1724-29.)  Absent interpretation from \nthe courts to the contrary, neither federal or state law, nor MDHHS \npolicy, nor Plaintiff’s voluntarily entered, state-funded contract, \nauthorize this.  Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction should be \ndenied.     \nCONCLUSION AND RELIEF REQUESTED \nFor the reasons explained above, Defendants respectfully request \nthis Court deny Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction and \ngrant such other relief as may be appropriate.  \nRespectfully submitted,   \n \nDana Nessel \nAttorney General \n \n/s/ Elizabeth R.
