There are three fully-briefed motions to dismiss before the Court 30, 31 and 49 . Accordingly, the Court will take the motions to dismiss under advisement as of April 19, 2018. Additionally, the Court GRANTS Governor Kate Brown and Oregon Department of Education's motion for leave to appear as amicus curiae 50 . Lastly, regarding Basic Right Oregon's (BRO) motion to intervene as defendant 24, the Court considers the following requirements for determining whether permissive intervention is appropriate. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b)(1)(B) as applied in the Ninth Circuit, there must be: (1) independent grounds for jurisdiction; (2) the motion must be timely; and (3) there must be a common question of law and fact between the movant's claim or defense and the main action. Freedom from Religion Found., Inc. v. Geithner, 644 F.3d 836, 843 (9th Cir. 2011). The Court concludes that BRO has satisfied each requirement outlined above and its proposed permissive intervention in this case is appropriate. Therefore, the Court exercises its discretion to GRANT BRO's motion 24 . Ordered by Judge Marco A. Hernandez. (jp) (Entered: 04/19/2018)"

    "summary": "<p>This case is a challenge to an Oregon school&rsquo;s policy of allowing transgender students to use the restroom that aligned with their gender identity, claiming that it violated the rights of cisgender students and parents.</p>\r\n<p>On November 13, 2017, Parents for Privacy, Parents Rights in Education, and a few private plaintiffs on behalf of their children (collectively, &ldquo;Parents for Privacy&rdquo;) sued Dallas School District No. 2, Oregon Department of Education, the Superintendent of Public Instruction for Oregon, the United States Department of Education (the &ldquo;DOE&rdquo;), the United States Secretary of Education, United States Department of Justice (the &ldquo;DOJ&rdquo;), and the United States Attorney General (collectively, &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo;) in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon. Represented by private counsel, Parents for Privacy alleged that the DOE and DOJ promulgated rules that mandated school districts who wished to keep their federal funding had to treat a student&rsquo;s gender identity as their sex for purposes of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (\"Title IX\"). Dallas School District No. 2 fully adopted and implemented a broad nondiscrimination policy that prohibited discrimination on the basis of gender identity. Thus, students were allowed to use the bathroom or locker room that aligned with their gender identity (the &ldquo;Bathroom Policy&rdquo;), which Parents for Privacy took issue with.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Against the US Department of Justice, the US Attorney General, US Department of Education, and the US Secretary of Education (collectively, &ldquo;Federal Defendants&rdquo;), Parents for Privacy alleged that the Bathroom Policy violated the Administrative Procedure Act, students&rsquo; fundamental right to privacy, parents&rsquo; right to direct the education and upbringing of their children, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and their First Amendment Right to free exercise of religion.</p>\r\n<p>Against the Oregon Department of Education and the Superintendent of Public Education of Oregon (collectively, &ldquo;State Defendants&rdquo;), Parents for Privacy alleged that the Bathroom Policy violated Oregon&rsquo;s prohibition against public accommodation discrimination.</p>\r\n<p>Against Dallas School District No. 2 (&ldquo;District Defendant&rdquo;), Parents for Privacy alleged that the Bathroom Policy violated students&rsquo; fundamental right to privacy, parents&rsquo; right to direct the education and upbringing of their children, Title IX, First Amendment Right to free exercise of religion, Oregon&rsquo;s prohibition against public accommodation discrimination, and Oregon&rsquo;s prohibition of discrimination in education.</p>\r\n<p>Parents for Privacy sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as statutory and compensatory damages. This case was assigned to District Judge Marco A. Hernandez.</p>\r\n<p>On December 13, 2017, the State Defendants filed a motion to dismiss arguing that the sole claim against them was barred by sovereign immunity, and two days later, the parties filed a stipulated notice of dismissal with prejudice. On January 1, 2018, the court found State Defendants' motion to dismiss moot due to the stipulated notice.</p>\r\n<p>On February 20, 2018, Basic Rights Oregon (&ldquo;BRO&rdquo;), represented by the ACLU, filed a motion to intervene on behalf of the defendants, granted by the court on April 19, 2018, as well as a motion to dismiss. BRO argued that the Bathroom Policy did not violate any of Parents for Privacy&rsquo;s rights and the injunctive relief they sought would itself be a discriminatory policy because it would target transgender students.</p>\r\n<p>On February 20, 2018, the District Defendant filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. First, it argued that the United States does not have a general right to privacy, there is only protection for certain personal privacy rights that do not include the right to share a bathroom or locker room with cisgender students only. Second, the District Defendant did not infringe Parents for Privacy&rsquo;s alleged privacy right because students were allowed to use private facilities and the school did not compel their students to &ldquo;expose themselves&rdquo; to the opposite sex. Third, the District Defendant did not violate parents&rsquo; right to raise their children because parents are free to enroll their children into private institutions that align with their beliefs. This right does not give parents the right to dictate the policies of public educational institutions. Lastly, Parents for Privacy did not allege a Title IX claim because Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex or gender identity and the District Defendant adopted the opposite: that is, a policy that forbids discrimination based on sex or gender identity.</p>\r\n<p>On March 15, 2018, the Federal Defendants filed their own motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, in which they argued Parents for Privacy lacked standing and had not stated a plausible claim against them. The Federal Defendants argued that the federal government did not compel Dallas School District No. 2 to adopt its non-discrimination policy and so Parents for Privacy failed to meet the traceability element required for standing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 24, 2018, the court granted BRO&rsquo;s, District Defendant&rsquo;s, and Federal Defendants&rsquo; motions to dismiss with prejudice. The court found that Parents for Privacy did not allege that their purported injuries were fairly traceable to the Federal Defendants so they lacked standing regarding the Administrative Procedure Claim. The court then found that there was no fundamental privacy right to not sharing school bathrooms and locker rooms with transgender students. Third, Parents for Privacy failed to make the necessary elements for their Title IX claim. The court agreed that ordering Dallas District No. 2 students to use the bathroom according to their biological sex would be a violation of Title IX. For similar reasons to the Title IX claim, Parents for Privacy claims do not hold up under Oregon state law. Lastly, the court found there was no religious discrimination as the policy did not promote a certain religious ideology and parents were free to enroll their students in institutions that aligned with their religious beliefs but did not have the right to direct public schools.</p>\r\n<p>On August 21, 2018, Parents for Privacy appealed to the Ninth Circuit of Appeals. On February 12, 2020, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court&rsquo;s opinion. The Appeals Court found there was no Fourteenth Amendment fundamental privacy violation nor did parents have a Fourteenth Amendment right to determine the bathroom policies of public school and the Bathroom Policy sought to avoid discrimination under Title IX and was rationally related to a legitimate state purpose and did not violate the First Amendment.</p>\r\n<p>On July 30, 2020, Parents for Privacy filed a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, which was denied on December 11, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>This case is closed as of December 11, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "In 2017, Parents for Privacy, Parents Rights in Education, and a few private plaintiffs on behalf of their children (collectively, “Parents for Privacy”) sued Dallas School District No. 2, Oregon Department of Education, the Superintendent of Public Instruction for Oregon, the United States Department of Education, the United States Secretary of Education, United States Department of Justice, and the United States Attorney General (collectively, “Dallas”) in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon. Parents for Privacy alleged that Dallas School District No. 2’s policy of allowing transgender students to use the bathroom or locker room that aligns with their gender identity violated the Fourteenth Amendment, First Amendment, Religious Freedom Act, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and Oregon state law. In 2018, all claims were dismissed with prejudice, which was upheld by the Ninth Circuit Appeals Court in 2020. This case is closed as of December 11, 2020.",

This case is about protecting the privacy ofevery student within Dallas\nSchool District No. 2 (\"Dallas School District\" or \"DISTRICT' or \"District\nDefendant\")—privacythat Defendantsviolate each school day through new rules and\npolicies that radically changed the meaning of \"sex\" in Title IX. Defendants have\nunilaterally rejected the Title IX meaning of sex, which for 40 years has meant\nbiologically male and female, two objectively determined, fixed, binary sexes rooted\nin our human reproductive nature. In lieu of this unambiguous meaning of sex,\nDefendants inject a distinct and altogether different concept ofgender identitywhich\nis subjectively discerned, fluid, and nonbinary. The Department of Education and\nDepartment ofJustice (collectively \"Federal Defendants\") acted without regard for\nPage | 2 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 3 of 65\nstatutory authority or required rule-making procedures, and created and\npromulgated a new ultra vires rule (\"Federal Rule\" or \"Rule\") through the artifice of\nissuing \"guidelines\" (\"Federal Guidelines\" or \"Guidelines\") and then enforcing those\nguidelines against several schools. Those enforcement actions put all school districts\nnationwide on notice that they must treat a student's gender identity as their sex for\nthe purpose of Title IX if they wish to retain federal funding. The Federal Rule\nredefines \"sex\" in Title IX and requires school districts to regulate access to sex-\nspecific private facilities such as locker rooms, restrooms, shower rooms, and hotel\nrooms on overnight school-sponsored trips by gender identity rather than by sex.\nDALLAS SCHOOL DISTRICT (\"District\") fully adopted and implemented the\nFederal Defendant's Rule as their own district policy in the form ofa Student Safety\nPlan. The consequence of the Federal Rule and the District policy is unavoidable:\nadolescent students, in the midst of disrobing within private intimate spaces, will\nencounter an adolescent student ofthe opposite sex in their midst. The risk ofsuch\nencounters, and the encounters themselves, merit prompt judicial intervention to\nenjoin Federal Defendants' rules and guidelines as well as DISTRICTS Student\nSafety Plan and policies and protect Plaintiffs' bodily privacy.\nJURISDICTION ANDVENUE\n2. This action arises under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983et seq. (the \"CivilRightsAct\"),\n5 U.S.C. §§500 et seq. (the \"Administrative Procedure Act\" or the \"APA\"), 20 U.S.C.\n§§ 1681etseq.

Subsequently,\nDefendant JEFF SESSIONS became the Attorney General in early 2017 and is\ncurrently the final policymaker for the operation and management of the USDOJ.\nSESSIONS is sued in his official capacity only.\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n31. Plaintiffs believe no student can or should be forced to use private\nfacilities at school, like locker rooms, showers and restrooms, with students of the\nopposite sex. Plaintiffs further believe no government agency can legitimately hold\nhostage education funding to advance an unlawful agenda enacted unlawfully, and\nPage | 11-COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 12 of 65\nno school district should trade its students' constitutional and statutory rights for\ndollars and cents from the U.S. Government. This is especially true when it means\nabandoning a common-sense practice that has long protected every student's privacy\nand access to education.\n32. Bypassing congressional intent, judicial rulings, and more than 40\nyears ofTitle IX history enforcing the unambiguous term \"sex\" (meaning males and\nfemales), the Federal Defendants decreed by unlawful agency fiat a new legislative\nrule redefining \"sex\" in Title IX and its implementing regulations to include \"gender\nidentity\", thereby requiring that a school must treat a student's gender identity as\nthe student's sex for purposes of Title IX and its implementing regulations.1 The\n1The term \"sex,\" as used in both Title IX and this Complaint, is a binary\nconcept that refers to one's biological status as either male or female\ndetermined at birth and manifest by biological indicators such as\nchromosomes, gonads, hormones, and genitalia. See, e.g., Am. Psychological\nAss'n, Answers to Your Questions About Transgender People, Gender Identity\nand GenderExpression 1, http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.pdfCSex\nis assigned at birth, refers to one's biological status as either male or female,\nand is associated primarily with physical attributes such as chromosomes,\nhormone prevalence, and external and internal anatomy.\"); Am. Psychological\nAss'n, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 451 (5th ed.\n2013) (\"DSM-5\") (noting that sex \"refer[s] to the biological indicators of male\nand female (understood in the context ofreproductive capacity), such as in sex\nchromosomes, gonads, sex hormones, and nonambiguous internal and external\ngenitalia.\"). When \"male\" and \"female\" are used in this Complaint, they are\nused consistently with this definition. \"Gender identity\" as defined by the\nDepartment ofEducation \"refers to an individual's internal sense ofgender. A\nperson's gender identity may be different from or the same as the person's sex\nassigned at birth.\" U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Department of\nEducation, Dear Colleague Letter: Transgender Students 1 (May 13, 2016).\nExhibit K. It is also subjective, fluid, and not rooted in human reproduction\nor tied to birth sex. Lawrence S. Mayer & Paul R. McHugh, Sexuality and\nGender:Findings from the Biological, Psychological, and Social Sciences, New\nPage | 12 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 13 of 65\nFederal Defendants' new Rule is succinctly stated this way: a school must \"treat a\nstudent's gender identity as the student's sex for purposes of Title IX and its\nimplementing regulations.\" May 13, 2016 Dear Colleague Letter: Transgender\nStudents (Ex. K).\n33. Federal Defendants created and promulgated this new legislative rule\n(\"Rule\") through a series of Federal Guidelines that were sent to school districts\nbetween April 2014 and May 2016, including:\n• U.S. Department ofEducation, Office for Civil Rights, Questions and\nAnswers on TitleIXand Sexual Violence, 5 (Apr. 2014) (Ex. H)\n• U.S. Department ofEducation, Office for Civil Rights, Questions and\nAnswers on Title IX and Single-Sex Elementary and Secondary\nClasses and ExtracurricularActivities, 25 (Dec. 2014) (Ex. I)\n• U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, Title IX\nResource Guide, 1, 15, 16, 19, 21-22 (Apr. 2015) (Ex. J) and\n• Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students (Ex. K).\n34. Contemporaneously, Federal Defendants enforced the policies\nannounced in these Guidelines as \"a condition of receiving Federal funds\", publicly\nthreatening to remove all federal funding from school districts that did not submit to\ntheir Guidelines. (Ex. K).\nAtlantis, at 87-93 (2016). When \"gender identity\" is used in this Complaint, it\nis used consistently with this definition.\nPage | 13 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 14 of 65\n35. The Rule made two radical changes to the law that are directly at issue\nin this case: It (1) redefined the term \"sex\" in Title IX to include gender identity, and\n(2) prohibited school districts from providing sex-specific facilities including locker\nrooms, shower rooms, restrooms, and hotel rooms on school sponsored trips.\n36. Under the Rule, school districts must provide any male student who\nprofesses a female gender identity unrestricted use of girls' private facilities and any\nfemale studentwho professes a male gender identity unrestricted use ofboys' private\nfacilities.\n37. The Rule is ultra vires because it violates both substantive and\nprocedural requirements ofthe Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") in that it was\nconsideredoradoptedthrough notice andcommentrulemakingandwas not approved\nor promulgated by the President ofthe United States.\n38. The Rule is unlawful because it mandates a school policy that creates a\nsexually harassing hostile environment and violates privacy.\n39. Subsequently, on or about February 22, 2017, USDOE and USDOJ\nissueda letterwithdrawingthe guidance intheirMay 13, 2016 Dear Colleague Letter\n(Ex. K) and an April 2015 Letter \"in order to further and more completely consider\nthe legal issues involved.\" Additionally, on or about March 3, 2017 the U.S. District\nCourt for the Northern District ofTexas dismissed without prejudice the multi-state\nlawsuit challenging the Rule and dissolving its preliminary injunction. Finally, on or\nabout March 6, 2017 the United States Supreme Court stayed and ultimately\nremanded Gloucester County School Board v. G.G., 2016 WL 1567467, F3d\nPage | 14 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 15 of 65\n(4th Cir. 2016). for further consideration. Gloucester County SchoolBoard v. G.G, 132\nS.Ct. 2442 (2016). More recently, USDOE's Office of Civil Rights has instructed its\nfield offices to continue investigation and potential enforcement of claims from\ntransgender students on a case-by-case basis. Ex. N. Notwithstanding the foregoing,\nthe Rule has not been formally repealed, and it has continuing legal force and effect\nbinding DISTRICT.\n40. In response to the foregoing Federal Guidelines and enforcement, the\nDISTRICTstoppedits historic and lawfulpractice ofsex-separatinglockerrooms and\nrestrooms and adopted and implemented the DISTRICT Student Safety Plan. Ex. A.\nDespite the actions recited in 1 39 above, DISTRICT has not changed its policies or\nthe Student Safety Plan complained ofherein.\n41. The StudentSafetyPlanregulates allDISTRICTschools, programs, and\nstudents aged pre-school through 12th grade, including the Student Plaintiffs.\n42. Because ofthe Student Safety Plan, Student A currently uses both the\nboys' locker rooms and the boys' restrooms at DALLAS HIGH SCHOOL, which\ncreates an intimidating and hostile environment for male students attending there,\nsome ofwhom are as young as 14, because Student A—who is biologically a female\nbut professing a male gender identity—regularly uses their private facilities at the\nsame times as Boy Plaintiffs.\n43. As a direct result of Defendants' policies and actions, every day\nbiologically male and female students go to school, where they have experienced, or\nmay experience, embarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, fear, apprehension, stress,\nPage | 15-COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 16 of 65\ndegradation, and loss ofdignity because they will have to use locker rooms, showers\nand restrooms with a student ofthe opposite biological sex.\n44. Because ofDefendants' policies and actions, these students are afraid of\nbeingseenby, andbeingforced to share intimate spaceswith a studentofthe opposite\nbiological sex while they are in various stages ofundress.\n45. Because of Defendants' policies and actions, these students are afraid\ntheywillhave to see other students ofthe opposite biologicalsexin a state ofundress.\n46. Because of Defendants' policies and actions, male and female students\nare afraid ofhaving to attend to their most personal needs, especially during a time\nwhen their body is often undergoing what they and other students may regard as\nembarrassing changes as they transition from childhood to adulthood, in a locker\nroom, shower or restroom with a student of the opposite biological sex present.\nAdditionally, no provision has been made in the Student Safety Plan or otherwise for\nappropriate disposal ofStudentA's feminine hygiene products in facilities previously\nreserved for male students, thereby creating sanitation and health concerns.\n47. The Student Safety Plan has had and continue to have a profoundly\nnegative effect on the students' access to educational opportunities, benefits,\nprograms, and activities at their schools in one or more ofthe following particulars:\na. Some students actively avoid using the locker rooms, restrooms\nand showers at school;\nb. One or more students have dropped physical education classes to\navoid havingto encounterotherstudentsofthe oppositebiological\nPage | 16 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 17 of 65\nsex in the locker room, as documented in the minutes of the\nDecember 14, 2015 school board meeting;\nc. Other students change as quickly as possible in the locker room,\navoiding all eye contact and conversation, all the while\nexperiencing great stress and anxiety over whether a student of\nthe opposite biological sex will walk in while they are undressing\nor changing; and\nd. Some students avoid the restroom altogether, and others wait as\nlong as possible to use the restroom, so they won't have to share\nit with a student of the opposite biological sex, thus potentially\nrisking a variety ofhealth problems.\n48. These negative effects on the students' access to educational\nopportunities, benefits, programs, and activities at their school are a direct result of\nUSDOE's adoption and enforcement ofthe Rule redefining the term \"sex\" in Title IX\nto include \"gender identity\", which in turn forms the justification for the Student\nSafety Plan.\n49. USDOE's action violates the Administrative Procedure Act, and the\nStudent Safety Plan violates the student plaintiffs' right to privacy, discriminates on\nthe basis of sex under Title IX by creating a hostile environment, and violates\nadditional constitutional and statutory rights of Student Plaintiffs, for which they\nseekrelieffrom this Court. Additionally, the aforementionedviolationsviolate Parent\nPlaintiffs' rights as parents to exercise their constitutional right to direct the\nPage | 17-COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 18 of 65\nupbringing and education of their children, for which they too seek relief from this\nCourt.\nFederal Defendants' Unlawful Title IXPolicy\n50. Congress passed Title IX of the Education Amendments of the Civil\nRights Act in 1972 pursuant to its Spending Clause power to prohibit invidious sex\ndiscrimination. Title IX states that \"[n]o person in the United States shall, on the\nbasis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be\nsubjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving\nFederal financial assistance....\" 20 U.S.C. § 1681.\n51. Title IX was designed to \"expand basic civil rights and labor laws to\nprohibit the discrimination against women which has been so thoroughly\ndocumented.\" 118 Cong. Rec. 3806 (1972) (Statement of Senator Birch Bayh of\nIndiana).\n52. Congress delegated authority to federal agencies to \"effectuate the\nprovisions of section 1681 of this title...by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of\ngeneral applicability which shall be consistent with achievement ofthe objectives of\nthe statute...\" but specified that \"no such rule, regulation, or order shall become\neffective unless and until approved by the President.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1682.\n53. Regulations implementing Title IX in relevant part provide that \"no\nperson shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the\nbenefitsof, orbe subjectedto discrimination under any academic, extracurricular...or\nother education program or activity operated by a recipient which receives Federal\nPage | 18-COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 19 of 65\nfinancial assistance,\" and that no funding recipient shall on the basis of sex \"treat\none persondifferentlyfrom anotherin determiningwhethersuchperson satisfies any\nrequirement or condition for the provision ofsuch aid, benefit, or service; ... Provide\ndifferent aid, benefits, or services or provide aid, benefits, or services in a different\nmanner; ... Deny any person any such aid, benefit, or service; ... Subject any person\nto separate or different rules of behavior, sanctions, or other treatment; ...[or]\nOtherwise limit any person in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or\nopportunity.\" 34 C.F.R. § 106.31.\n54. Title IX does not authorize Federal Defendants to regulate the content\nof speech or discriminate on the basis of viewpoint, which is presumptively\nunconstitutional under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n55. Title IX and its implementing regulations use the term \"sex\" to\ncategorize the persons protected from invidious discrimination by the law.\n56. The term \"sex\" in Title IX and its implementing regulations means the\nimmutable, genetic, reproductively-based binary male-female taxonomy. See p. 12,\nfn. 1. The text of Title IX demonstrates this male-female taxonomy by using\nterminology such as \"both sexes,\" \"one sex,\" and \"the other sex.\"\n57. Title IX and its implementing regulations do not use the term \"gender\nidentity,\" or alternate terms referring to the same concept (e.g., \"transgender,\" or\n\"transsexual\"). Nothing in the text, structure, or legislative history of Title IX\nsuggests or supports that the term \"sex\" in Title IX includes \"gender identity.\"\nNothing in the text, structure, and drafting history of Title IX's implementing\nPage | 19-COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 20 of 65\nregulations suggests or supports that the term \"sex\" in these regulations includes\n\"gender identity.\"\n58. Although Senator Al Franken ofMinnesota began in 2011 introducing\nlegislation modeled after Title IX to prohibit gender identity discrimination in\nschools, Congress has repeatedly failed to enact the legislation.\n59. Title IX and its implementing regulations expressly permit sex-specific\nprivate facilities, providing in relevant part: \"nothing contained herein shall be\nconstrued to prohibit any educational institution...from maintaining separate living\nfacilities for the different sexes....\" 20 U.S.C. § 1686.\n60. The implementing regulations confirm that living facilities include\nrestrooms, locker rooms, and shower rooms - \"[school districts] may provide separate\ntoilet, lockerroom, and showerfacilities on the basis ofsex, [as long as] suchfacilities\nprovided for students of one sex [are] comparable to such facilities provided for\nstudents ofthe other sex.\" 34 C.F.R. § 106.33.\n61. Federal Defendants have provided no explanation for the new Rule,\nincludingits basis for the decisionto promulgate the Rule, a description ofthe factors\nrelied upon to formulate the Rule, its recognition of the fundamentally different\nnature ofsex and gender identity, or any recognition or explanation for the reversal\nof long-standing policy that permitted districts to separate private facilities by sex\nwithout regard to a student's professed gender identity.\nPage | 20 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 21 of 65\n62. Federal Defendants also failed to substantively assess how the new Rule\nwould impact privacy rights of all male and female students on a given campus,\nincluding District schools.\n63. Federal Defendants have enforced the Rule through public\ninvestigations, findings, and threats to revoke millions of dollars in federal funding\nfrom several school districts because they provided sex-specific private facilities. U.S.\nDepartment of Education, Resources for Transgender and Gender Nonconforming\nStudents: OCR Resolutions, http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/lgbt.html (last\nvisited August 10, 2016). Federal Defendants have no statutory authority to\ninvestigate a claim based on gender identity or gender nonconformity.\n64. Township High School District 211 (\"District 211\") in Palatine, Illinois\nwas one ofthe districts investigated.\n65. The Office of Civil Rights for the DOE (\"OCR\") issued a Letter of\nFindings against District 211 in November 2015. Township High School District 211,\n05-14-1055 (Office ofCivil Rights November 2, 2015) (letter offindings). (Ex. L). That\nletter stated in relevant part that when OCRinvestigates Title IX complaints it looks\nfor evidence of \"discrimination based on sex, gender identity, or gender\nnonconformity.\" Id.\n66. The letter also stated that District 211 violated Title IX by\ndiscriminating on the basis ofgender identity because District 211 did not let a male\nstudent who professes a female gender identity use girls' locker rooms. OCR then\nPage | 21 -COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 22 of 65\nthreatened to revoke $6 million in federal funding from District 211 ifit continued to\nsex-separate private facilities.\n67. In December 2015, District 211 signed an Agreement with OCR and\ngranted the male student access to the girls' locker rooms. (Ex. M).\n68. Parents andstudentswho sufferedprivacyandconstitutionalharmfiled\na federal lawsuitregardingthatAgreement. StudentsandParentsfor Privacy v.Dep't\nofEduc, et al., No. l:16-cv-04945 (N.D. 111. filed May 4, 2016).\n69. Similarly, in May 2016, Defendant USDOJ sent letters to the North\nCarolina Governor and the University of North Carolina system threatening to\nrevoke Title IX funding from North Carolina schools if the state and University\nSystem enforced a state law that mandates sex-specific private facihties in\ngovernment buildings, including schools.\n70. When the Governor resisted, Defendant USDOJ filed a federal lawsuit\nagainst the State ofNorth Carolina. U.S. v. N.C., No. l:16-cv-00425 (M.D. N.C. filed\nMay 9, 2016).\n71. These enforcement actions, with the Guidelines, sent a clear message to\nschool districts nationwide, including Dallas School District, that they too could lose\nmillions in federal funding for maintaining sex-specific private facihties, specifically\nauthorized pursuant to Title IX.\n72. Despite the subsequent actions taken by USDOE, USDOJ and federal\ncourts (See H 39), DISTRICT continues to implement its Student Safety Plan in\nderogation ofthe rights ofPlaintiffs and others.\nPage | 22 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 23 of 65\n73. Because the Rule has not been repealed (See f 39), DISTRICT stillfaces\npotential legal liability from OCR and others on the basis of \"gender identity\",\nallegedlyinviolationofTitle IX, byrefusinga biologicalfemale, who perceives herself\nto be male, access to the boys' locker and shower rooms.\n74. Per the Dallas School District No. 2 Adopted Operating Budget 2015-\n2016, DISTRICT has faced and potentially continues to face the threat oflosing over\n$2 million dollars in federal funds for each school year from 2015-2016 to the present\nif it fails to grant a biologically female student access to the boys' restroom, locker\nroom and shower rooms.\nDallas School District's Unconstitutional Policy\n75. In response to the threat of OCR enforcement action, on or about\nNovember 15, 2015, DISTRICT developed and implemented the Student Safety Plan\n(Ex.A) grantingStudentA the righttoenteranduse allboy'slockerrooms, restrooms\nand showers at DISTRICT schools according to her perceived gender identity.\nDISTRICT has publicly defended the Student Safety Plan based on USDOE's\nunlawfulactiondescribed above. Despite the actions recitedinf 39 above, DISTRICT\nhas not changed its policies.\n76. Student A is currently a 12th grade student at Dallas High School.\n77. Student A was born a girl and is anatomically female. Throughout most\nof her school career, Student A identified to her classmates, including Student\nPlaintiffs, as a girl, consistent with her biological sex, and used the restrooms, locker\nPage | 23 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 24 of 65\nrooms and showers consistent with her biological sex prior to and including her high\nschool career until September 2015.\n78. In September 2015, Student A decided to publicly identify herself as\nmale, although prior to that time she had been using the girls' facilities in middle\nschoolandhighschool. StudentArequestedthatshebe allowedto use the boys'locker\nrooms and shower facilities, but was unsure which restroom facilities she preferred.\n79. DISTRICT provided Student A with her choice of private facilities to\nchange her clothes for physical education from the fall of2015 through the end ofthe\nschool year in June, 2016. DISTRICT told Student A that she could use the boys'\nlocker rooms and shower facilities while biologically male students are present, even\nthough her presence would invade the privacy of those male students, and even\nthough herparent andlegal guardianobjected. DISTRICTfurther permittedStudent\nA to \"use any ofthe bathrooms in the buildingto which he identifies sexually.\" A true\ncopy of the floor plan of DALLAS HIGH SCHOOL is attached hereto as Ex. 0.\nDISTRICT elected not to accommodate StudentA by granting her access to separate\nexisting unisex restroom, locker room and shower facilities accessible through the\nmainoffice as allegedherein, and Because ofthe StudentSafetyPlan (Ex. A), Student\nA is currently using the boys' locker rooms, showers and restrooms at Dallas High\nSchool while male students are present, including some of the Boy Plaintiffs and\nother biologically male students.\nPage | 24 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 25 of 65\n80. The Student Safety Plan described above was shared with other\nstudents in Student A's PE class, but was not otherwise disclosed or discussed with\nDISTRICT students or parents ofDISTRICT students.\n81. In response to Student A's complaints for accommodation, DISTRICT is\npreparing to make changes to its locker room, shower and restroom facilities for the\nuse ofStudentA and others at a cost variously estimated at $200,000-$500,000. Even\nifsuchchanges are made, DISTRICTwillstillallow allpersons to utilize the facihties\noftheir choice without accommodating those who still desire segregated facilities.\n82. Under DISTRICT'S previous discrimination policy biological females\nwere not expresslyauthorized to enter male locker rooms orotherfacilities. However,\nStudent A has utilized the boys' locker room and shower facilities on numerous\noccasions from November 15, 2015 to the present and has changedclothes while male\nstudents were present.\n83. Similarly, even using toilets in stalls does not resolve the\nembarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, intimidation, fear, apprehension, and stress\nproduced by using the restroom with students ofthe opposite sex, because the stalls\nare notfully private; and, besides, the Student Plaintiffs are still attendingto private\nbodilyneeds inthe immediate presence ofthe opposite sex. Inboththe boys' and girls'\nrestrooms, there are large gaps above and below the stall doors, and gaps along the\nsides ofthe door, that another student could see through even inadvertently. These\ngaps mean that the Student Plaintiffs, both boys and girls, must risk exposing\nthemselves to the opposite sex every time they use the restroom. DISTRICT cannot\nPage | 25 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 26 of 65\nassure Student Plaintiffs' that their partially unclothed bodies will not be exposed to\nmembers ofthe opposite biological sex while using the restroom.\n84. As a consequence, some Plaintiffs and other students are using the\nrestroom as little as possible while at school so they will not have to risk using the\nrestroom with a studentofthe oppositebiologicalsexpresent. This mayincrease their\nrisk for various health conditions, like bladder infections.\n85. Some students risk tardiness by hurrying to distant facihties of the\nschool, duringshort 5-minute passingperiods, to try and find a restroom not likely to\nbe used by a student ofthe opposite biological sex.\n86. The stress and anxiety some students feel over having to use the\nrestroom with biologically opposite-sex students is an ever-present distraction\nthroughout the school day, including during class instruction time.\n87. The DALLAS HIGH SCHOOL Principal has told students that all\nrestroom facilities may be utilized by any student regardless of their biological sex\nand may not object to students ofthe opposite sex utilizing the same facilities, which\nis not acceptable to Parent Plaintiffs for multiple reasons set forth in the following\nparagraphs:\n88. Depending on the classes a student has, this can mean that they travel\nsignificant distances from one class to another in a limited passing period.\n89. Restrooms are often a significant distance apart, so a student's choice to\nfind another restroom may mean there is not enough time to find another restroom,\nPage | 26 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 27 of 65\nattend to their personal needs, and still arrive to class on time. Tardiness may result\nin detention or other sanctions.\n90. The suggested solution is even more unworkable ifthere are lines in the\nrestrooms, or ifthere is an urgent or immediate need to use the restroom.\n91. DISTRICT'S response to Parent Plaintiffs makes the restroom\nenvironment hostile to Student Plaintiffs since each time they use the restroom they\nmust do so knowing that a student ofthe opposite biological sexcan walk inon them.\nIn the same way, in response to the request for a private locker room facility, the\nDALLAS HIGH SCHOOL Principal told Parent Plaintiffs that their students could\nuse the unisex staff lounge, which has no functioning shower. None of these is an\nacceptable alternative.\n92. Students at DALLAS HIGH SCHOOL have expressed their discomfort\nwith the accommodations provided for Student A and attempted to circulate a\npetition objecting to such accommodations. However, Principal Steve Spencer\nconfiscated the petitions being circulated and ordered students circulating them to\ndiscontinue doing so or face disciplinary action.\n93. At Board meetings on December 14, 2015, January 19, 2016 and\nFebruary 11, 2016, despite public opposition from Plaintiffs and many other parents\nand students, DISTRICT defended its policies and practices indefinitely granting\nStudent A right ofentry to and use ofany and all boys' locker rooms, shower rooms\nand restrooms in DALLAS HIGH SCHOOL. DISTRICT represents speakers at these\nPage | 27 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 28 of 65\nmeetings as experts on gender identity issues, all ofwhom have exclusively supported\nthe Student Safety Plan and condemned any objections to these policies.\n94. Based on DISTRICT'S public defense ofthese policies, Plaintiffs further\nbelieve that Student A will similarly be allowed access to other DISTRICT facilities\nofher choice throughout the DISTRICT when attending school or other programs at\nsuch other DISTRICT facilities.\n95. In addition to StudentA, plaintiffs understand on information and belief\nthere are one or more other students attending DISTRICT schools who self-identify\nas transgender or \"gender fluid.\"2\n96. In February, 2017 the staff at DISTRICT'S La Creole Middle School\nadministered a \"Needs Assessment\" to students at La Creole on their school-issued\nChrome Book computers without prior notice, knowledge or consent of parents or\nguardians. Ex. P. Among the students required to take the Needs Assessment was\nA.G. The Needs Assessment asked students to disclose confidentialinformation about\nvarious problems or issues they were experiencing the students might want\nassistance with, includingclothing, school supplies, family food sufficiency, alcohol or\ndrug abuse, suicide, self-image, sexual orientation and gender identity, unhealthy\n2 \"Gender fluidity\" is generally defined to mean that one's gender identity can change\nday-to-day, or even moment-to-moment, and is not limited to the two binary genders\n(i.e., to \"male\" or \"female\"). So, for example, one may identify as female one moment,\nas male the next, and as neutrois (a neutral gender that is neither male nor female)\nthe next. See, e.g., Gender Diversity, \"Gender Fluidity,\" available at\nhttp://www.genderdiversity.org/resources/terminology/A^Q7i6marv.org',\"Genderfluid,\"\navailable at http://nonbinary.org/wiki/Genderfluid (both websites last visited May 3,\n2016).\nPage | 28 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 29 of 65\nrelationships and other subjects of a personal or family nature. After some parents\nlearned of the survey and objected, school officials said participation in the survey\nwas voluntary, whereas A.G. and other students understood their participation was\nrequired.\nDamaging Effects ofDistrict's Actions on\nStudents at Dallas High School\nBoy Plaintiffs\n97. A number of biologically male students, including Boy Plaintiffs, had\nphysical education during the same class period as StudentA, and were forced to use\nthe PE locker room with her in spite oftheir objections to doing so.\n98. Boy Plaintiffs and other biologically male students cannot escape forced\ninteractions with Student A in the locker room because physical education (\"PE\") is\na mandatory course for two or more years of school in DISTRICT, and is a\nrequirement to graduate. Moreover, it is mandatory that all students in PE class\nchange into clothing appropriate for PE class, and all must change their clothes at\nthe beginning and end ofeach PE class.\n99. The main boys' locker room is a square room with four banks oflockers\nand wooden benches, plus communal showers along one wall, used by approximately\n30 students in physical education classes to change clothes during a given class\nperiod. Also within that space are segregatedlockers, showers and restroom facilities\nand coach's office spaces.\nGirl Plaintiffs,\nPage | 29 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 30 of 65\n100. Because of the Student Safety Plan (Ex. A), Girl Plaintiffs and other\nbiologically female students at DALLAS HIGH SCHOOL face living in ongoing\nanxiety, fear, and apprehension that a biological boy will be permitted to walk in at\nany time while they are using the school locker rooms or showers and see them in a\nstate ofundress or while changing.\n101. Because ofthe Student SafetyPlan, Girl Plaintiffs andotherbiologically\nfemale students at DALLAS HIGH SCHOOL hve in constant anxiety, fear, and\napprehension that a biologicalboywill be permittedto walk in at any time while they\nare using the restroom engaged in intimate and private bodily functions.\n102. In that event, Girl Plaintiffs cannot escape forced interactions with\nbiologically male students in the locker room because physical education (\"PE\") is a\nmandatory course for two or more years ofschool in DISTRICT, and is a requirement\nto graduate. Moreover, it is mandatory that all students in PE class change into\nclothing appropriate for PE class, and all must change their clothes at the beginning\nand end ofeach PE class. Some Girl Plaintiffs and other biologically female students\nalso change into sports bras, resulting in even greater bodily exposure while in the\nlocker rooms.\n103. The Girls' locker room is constructed similarly to the boys' locker room.\n104. Girl Plaintiffs object to being forced to use a locker room, shower or\nrestroomwith anybiological male studentas the StudentSafetyPlan mandateswhen\na biological male student informs the DISTRICT ofhis new gender as a female.\nPage | 30 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 31 of 65\n105. The dread, anxiety, stress, and fear the Girl Plaintiffs feel over having\nto use the same locker room, shower or restroom as a biologically male student is a\nconstant distraction during the school day, including during class instruction time.\n106. The Girl Plaintiffs and other biologically female students are also\nanxious, afraid and embarrassed to see any biologically male students in a state of\nundress or naked because he is a biological male.\n107. The Girl Plaintiffs and other female students feel compelled to change\ntheir clothing as quickly as possible during PE classes, while trying not to observe\nother students.\n108. Because ofthe Defendants' actions that allow a biological male into the\ngirls' locker room, Girl Plaintiffs and otherfemale students have come to view the PE\nlocker room as a scary and intimidating environment.\n109. Additionally, DISTRICT has, through various announcements to the\nstudents at DALLAS HIGH SCHOOL and through board and community meetings\non gender identity DISTRICT has organized and sponsored, conveyed to the Student\nPlaintiffs and parents the message that any objection to the Student Safety Plan (Ex.\nA) or restriction on Student A's use of opposite sex facilities based on her gender\nidentity will be viewed by DISTRICT administration as intolerance and bigotry.\n110. Because of DISTRICT'S message that differing views will not be\ntolerated, most of the Student Plaintiffs have been deterred from asking for a\nseparate, private locker room or restroom.\nPage | 31-COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 32 of 65\n111. Because of DISTRICT'S message, at least some Student Plaintiffs are\nafraid to be named publicly in this lawsuit, for fear that other students and their\nschools will retaliate against them.\n112. Third, evenifStudentPlaintiffscoulduse the facilities withoutsuffering\nridicule and harassment, they do not remedy the privacy violation caused by the\npresence ofa person ofthe opposite biological sex sharing the same small, intimate\nsettings where they are naked or in various states ofundress.\nParent Plaintiffs\n113. DISTRICTS response to Parent Plaintiffs does nothing to alleviate the\nstress and anxiety of having their student subjected to the presence of a student of\nthe opposite biological sex already using the locker room, shower or restroom.\n114. All Parent Plaintiffs also adamantly object to their sons and daughters\nusing locker rooms, showers and restrooms with students of the opposite sex while\nthat student is naked or in a state of undress, nor do they want their children to\nattend to their private bodily needs in the presence ofthe opposite biological sex.\n115. Some Parents have asked DISTRICT for private options for their\nstudents to change their clothes and use the restroom, but the options offered are\ninadequate and inferior to the facilities provided to Student A. Additionally, options\noffered are also unworkable in terms ofthe practical locker room and shower needs\nofthe Student Plaintiffs.\nPage | 32 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 33 of 65\n116. The Student Safety Plan (Ex. A) interferes with some Parent Plaintiffs'\npreferred moral and/or religious teaching of their children concerning modesty and\nnudity.\n117. The Student Safety Plan (Ex. A) further interferes with Parent\nPlaintiffs' right to control whether their children will be exposed to the opposite sex\nin intimate, vulnerable settings like restrooms, locker rooms, and showers.\n118. The Student Safety Plan (Ex. A) interferes with Parent Plaintiffs' right\nto control whether their children's partially or fully unclothed body is exposed to the\nopposite sex.\n119. Because ofthe Student Safety Plan (Ex. A), at least one Parent Plaintiff\nhas decided to send his daughter to private school, instead of a DISTRICT school,\nwhen she starts high school.\n120. Some student and parent members of PARENTS FOR PRIVACY,\nincludingJON &KRIS GOLLY and their children, are devout Christians whose faith\nrequires that they preserve their modesty and not use the restroom, shower, or\nundress, in the presence ofthe opposite sex.\n121. These students and parents also believe that they should not be in the\npresence of a member of the opposite sex while that person is using the restroom,\nshowering, or undressing.\n122. The Student Safety Plan (Ex. A)is particularlylikelyto cause emotional\nand psychological trauma to girls who have been sexually assaulted, for whom the\npresence ofa biological male in their private facilities can be especially unnerving, or\nPage | 33 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 34 of 65\neven terrifying. The Centers for Disease Control (the \"CDC\") has observed that\nalmost 12% ofhigh school girls reported that they had already experienced the horror\nof rape. Center for Disease Control, Sexual Violence: Facts at a Glance (2012);\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/sv-datasheet-a.pdf. This means that\nnearly 1 out of every 8 high school girls is likely to have suffered sexual assault, a\nstatistic that compounds the problem with the Student Safety Plan. DISTRICT'S\npolicies thereby cause stress, fright, embarrassment, humiliation, and anxiety for the\nStudent Plaintiffs, they are likely more traumatizing to other students who have been\nsexually assaulted.\nALLEGATIONS OF LAW\n123. All Student Plaintiffs have suffered and continue to suffer the loss of\ntheir constitutionally guaranteed right to bodily privacy, as well as their right under\nTitle IX to an education that is free from a hostile environment based on sex, because\nofthe Defendants' policies and actions, including the Student Safety Plan.\n124. Additionally, all Student Plaintiffs suffer embarrassment, humiliation,\nanxiety, intimidation, fear, apprehension, stress, degradation, and loss ofdignity as\na result ofthe Defendants' actions, including the Student Safety Plan.\n125. Defendants' actions and the Student Safety Plan negatively impacts\nStudent Plaintiffs' ability to receive an education, creating a hostile environment\nwhere Student Plaintiffs experience sexual harassment and loss of dignity at the\nhands oftheir school every day.\nPage I34 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 35 of 65\n126. Federal Defendants have exceeded their statutory authority, acted\narbitrarily and capriciously, and violatedplaintiffs' constitutional rights by adopting\na legislative rule redefining \"sex\" under Title IX to include \"gender identity\" and\nenforcingthat rule in a mannerthat effectively requires DISTRICT to allow students\nto use the locker rooms and restrooms ofthe opposite sex.\n127. Federal Defendants have acted without observing the proper\nadministrative procedure for adopting and enforcing such a new legislative rule,\nwhich includes notice and comment under the APA and presidential approval under\nTitle IX.\n128. It is a violation ofthe right to bodily privacy to force students to have\ntheir partially or fully unclothed bodies viewed by students ofthe opposite sex.\n129. The right to bodily privacy also bars the government from forcing\nstudents into situations where they risk exposure of their unclothed body to the\nopposite sex.\n130. Minors have a fundamental right to be free from compelled intimate\nexposure of their bodies to members of the opposite sex, which is violated when the\ndefendants force them to use the restrooms and locker rooms with students of the\nopposite sex.\n131. Defendants are violating the parental right to control the upbringing\nandeducationofone's childbyexposingParent Plaintiffs' childrento the opposite sex\ninintimate, vulnerable settings like restrooms, locker rooms, and showers, especially\nwhere their children, the opposite-sex children, or both, may be in a state ofundress\nPage | 35 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 36 of 65\nor even naked. District Defendants are further violating the rights of Parent\nPlaintiffs in administering surveys to students delving into personal and family\nmatters without advance notice, knowledge or consent ofparents and guardians.\n132. Providing single-sex restrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities does\nnot violate Title IX, so long as the facilities provided for one sex are comparable to\nthe facilities provided to the other sex.\n133. Defendants' actions and the Student Safety Plan violate Plaintiffs' free\nexercise rights under the United States Constitution and state statutory law.\n134. Plaintiffs are suffering and continue to suffer irreparable harm.\n135. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF (FEDERAL DEFENDANTS):\nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT\n136. Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate all matters set forth in HH 1 through\n135 herein.\n137. Federal Defendants promulgated, and are enforcing, a new legislative\nrule that redefines the term \"sex\" in Title IX and its accompanying regulations to\nmean, or at least include, \"gender identity.\"\n138. USDOE has expressed its intention to enforce this new redefinition of\n\"sex\" as a legislative rule against DISTRICT.\n139. USDOE's new legislative rule contradicts the text, structure, legislative\nhistory, and historical judicial interpretation of Title IX, all of which confirm that\n\"sex\" means male and female in the binary and biological sense.\nPage | 36 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 37 of 65\n140. According to USDOE's new legislative rule, Title IX requires schools to\npermit students to use restrooms, locker rooms, and showers based on their gender\nidentity rather than their biological sex.\n141. USDOE has communicated this new legislative rule to school districts\nnationwide via a \"Dear Colleague\" letter dated May 13, 2016 (Exhibit K) and stated\nthat theirfailure to complywithitwillresult in investigation and enforcement action\nup to and including withdrawal ofmillions ofdollars in federal funding.\n142. USDOE's promulgation and enforcement ofthis new legislative rule are\nreviewable actions under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") pursuant to 20\nU.S.C § 1683.\n143. USDOE's actions are also final, and there is no other adequate remedy\nbecause the Student Safety Plan binds DISTRICT such that Plaintiffs cannot get\nrelief unless the Rule is set aside, and the Federal Defendants are enjoined from\ncontinuingto communicate and enforce the new rule redefiningthe meaningof\"sex.\"\nPlaintiffs continue to be denied an effective remedy, despite the remedial actions\nalleged in ^|39, because the Rule remains in effect.\n144. Plaintiffs have suffered a legal wrong as a direct result of USDOE's\nactions, because Plaintiffs' constitutional and statutory rights were and continue to\nbe violated by the Student Safety Plan, which is the direct result of USDOE's\nenforcement ofits new rule.\n145. Under the APA, a reviewing Court must \"hold unlawful and set aside\nagency action\" in one or more offour instances that apply to this case:\nPage | 37 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 38 of 65\n• Ifthe agency action is \"in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or\nlimitations, or short of statutory right.\" 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C);\n• Ifthe agency action is \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or\notherwise not in accordance with law.\" 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A);\n• Ifthe agency action is \"contraryto constitutionalright, power, privilege,\nor immunity.\" 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B); and\n• If the agency action is \"without observance of procedure required by\nlaw.\" 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).\n146. USDOE's action here violates all four ofthese standards and should be\nheld unlawful and set aside.\n147. Plaintiffs ask this Court (1) to set aside and remove from its official\nwebsite all guidance documents, (See lfl[ 32, 39; Exs. H-N), to the extent that they\nincorporate gender identity within the meaning of\"sex\" for purposes ofTitle IX, as\nwell as the Student Safety Plan, and (2) to declare and enjoin USDOE and USDOJ\nfrom further enforcing Title IX in a manner that requires DISTRICT to give any\nstudentsthe right ofentryto, and use of, the privatefacihties (includinglockerrooms,\nshowers and restrooms) designated for students ofthe opposite sex.\nUSDOE's Action Is Unlawful under the APABecause It is in Excess of\nStatutory Jurisdiction, Authority, or Limitations\n148. USDOE's actions in promulgating and enforcing its new rule are \"in\nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short ofstatutory right,\"\nPage | 38 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 39 of 65\nbecause they redefine the unambiguous term \"sex\" and add gender identity to Title\nIX without the authorization ofCongress.\n149. Congress has not delegated to USDOE the authority to define or\nredefine unambiguous terms in Title IX.\n150. Title IX does not require that DISTRICT or any other school open its\ngirls' restrooms, locker rooms and shower rooms to biological males who identify as\nfemale, nor does it require that DISTRICT open their boys' facilities to biological\nfemales who identify as male.\n151. USDOE's unilateral decree that \"sex\" in Title IX means, or includes,\n\"genderidentity,\" which requires schools to allow maleswho identify as female to use\nthe girls' facilities, and vice versa, requires DISTRICT to give students the right of\nentry and use of opposite sex locker and shower rooms, and requires DISTRICT to\ngive all students right of entry and use of the restrooms that correspond to their\ngender identity, irrespective oftheir biological sex.\n152. This new rule is not supported by Title IX's text, implementing\nregulations, or legislative history.\n153. Therefore, USDOE's rule was promulgated and enforced \"in excess of\nstatutory jurisdiction, authority or limitations, or short of statutory right[,]\" See 5\nU.S.C. § 706(2)(C). This Court should hold USDOE's rule unlawful and set it aside,\nincluding removing it from its official website.\n154. Additionally, even if USDOE's rule was interpretive, it would still\nexceed USDOE's statutory authority and should be declared unlawful and set aside.\nPage | 39 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 40 of 65\nUSDOE'sAction Is Unlawful under the APA Because It isArbitrary,\nCapricious, an Abuse ofDiscretion, orNot in Accordance with Law\n155. USDOE's actions in promulgating and enforcing its new rule are\n\"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with\nlaw.\" See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).\n156. Congress requires that whenever an agency takes action it do so after\nengaging in a process by which it \"examine[s] the relevant data and articulate[s] a\nsatisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made.\" Motor Veh.Mfrs. Ass'n. v. StateFarm Ins., 463 U.S.\n29, 43 (1983) (quotation omitted).\n157. An agency action is \"arbitrary and capricious ifthe agency has relied on\nfactors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an\nimportant aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs\ncounter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be\nascribedto a difference inview orproductofagencyexpertise.\"Motor Veh.Mfrs. Ass's\nv. State Farm Ins., 463 U.S. at 43.\n158. USDOE has given no explanation for its redefinition of\"sex\" in Title IX,\nwhereby USDOE unilaterally decreed that the term \"sex\" in Title IX means, or\nincludes, gender identity; requires DISTRICT to give Student A right of entry and\nuse of opposite sex locker and shower rooms; and requires DISTRICT to give all\nstudents access to the facilities that correspond to their gender identity, if the\nstudents desire to use them.\nPage | 40 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 41 of 65\n159. USDOE has given no explanation ofthe relevant factors that were the\nbasis of its actions, and USDOE has failed to consider important implications and\nadverse consequences caused by allowing biological boys and girls to share intimate\nsettings, including: the language and structure of Title IX and its regulations; the\ncongressional and judicial histories ofTitle IX and its regulations; the practical and\nconstitutional harms created by its unlawful application ofTitle IX; and the violation\nofTitle IX caused by this unlawful application.\n160. USDOE's action was also made without a rational explanation,\ninexplicablydepartedfrom establishedpolicies, orrested onotherconsiderations that\nCongress could not have intended to make relevant.\n161. USDOE has offered no explanation for its rule redefining\"sex\"; the rule\ndeparted from the establishedTitle IX policythat allowed schoolsto maintainprivate\nfacilities separated by biological sex; and the rule rested on considerations related to\n\"gender identity\" despite the fact that the legislative history indicates Congress did\nnot intend \"sex\" to mean anything other than biological sex.\n162. USDOE's legislative action was also taken even though it is contrary to\nlaw or regulation.\n163. USDOE's rule purporting to redefine Title IX violates Title IX as it\napplies to the very group Title IX was created to protect by creating a hostile\nenvironment for Girl Plaintiffs.\n164. USDOE's promulgation and enforcement of its rule is thus arbitrary,\ncapricious, an abuse ofdiscretion, and not in accordance with law. This Court should\nPage | 41 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 42 of 65\ntherefore hold that it is unlawful and set it aside. Additionally, even ifUSDOE's rule\nwas interpretive, it would still be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and\nnot in accordance with law, and so should be declared unlawful, set aside and\nremoved from its official website.\nUSDOE's Action Is Unlawful under the APABecause It is Contrary to\nConstitutional Right, Power, Privilege, or Immunity\n165. For the reasons set forth herein, USDOE's actions are \"contrary to\nconstitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.\" See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B).\n166. USDOE's legislative rule is an unlawful application ofTitle IX contrary\nto the Constitution because it violates the privacy rights ofStudent Plaintiffs, their\nparents' fundamental liberty interest in controlling their children's upbringing and\neducation, and the rights ofsome Student Plaintiffs and their parents to freely live\nout their religious beliefs.\n167. Also, USDOE's legislative rule is in violation ofthe Spending Clause of\nthe United States Constitution, under which Title IX was enacted, in that Congress\nuses its Spending Clause power to generate legislation in the nature ofa contract: in\nreturnforfederalfunds, the States agree to complywithfederallyimposedconditions.\n168. Congress must clearly and unambiguously state the conditions to which\nthe States are agreeing in exchange for federal funds, so that the States can\nknowingly decide whether to accept the funding. The crucial inquiry is whether\nCongress spoke so clearly that it can be fairly said that the State could make an\ninformed choice.\nPage |42 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 43 of 65\n169. Requiring schools to allow biological females access to facilities\ndesignated for males cannot pass this test, no matter how the females identify. Nor\ncan allowingbiological males access to facilities designated for females pass this test,\nno matter how the males identify.\n170. As set forth herein, the plain language of the text, along with the\nlegislative history, clearly indicates that Congress intended that (1) \"sex\" means\n\"biological sex\"; (2) Title IX prevents discrimination based on biological sex; and (3)\nTitle IX allows sex-separated restrooms, locker rooms and showers.\n171. Further, the implementing regulations specifically allow schools to\nmaintain restrooms, locker rooms and showers separated by biological sex. 34 CFR\n106.33.\n172. For over 40 years of Title IX's existence, it has been universally\nunderstood by schools that receive federal education funding that Title IX's definition\nof\"sex\" does not include gender identity.\n173. It has likewise been universally understood by schools that received\nfederal education funding that maintaining separate restrooms, locker rooms,\nshowers and other private facilities on the basis ofbiological sex is consistent with\nTitle IX.\n174. No school could have possibly made an informed choice, because no\nschool could have known that the funds it agreed to accept were conditioned on\nallowing cross-sex private facilities, or otherwise recognizing gender identity as\nwithin the meaning ofthe term \"sex.\"\nPage | 43 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 44 of 65\n175. For these reasons, this Court should hold USDOE's actions unlawful,\nset aside its Guidance Documents (Exs. H-K) and the Student Safety Plan (Ex. A),\nand enjoin it, along with USDOJ, from further communicatingto DISTRICT the new\nrule that \"sex\" in Title IX includes \"gender identity.\"\n176. Additionally, even if USDOE's rule was interpretive, it would still be\ncontraryto constitutionalright, power, privilege, orimmunity and shouldbe declared\nunlawful, set aside and removed from its official website.\nUSDOE's Action Is Unlawful under the APA Because It is Without\nObservance ofProcedure Required by Law\n177. For the reasons set forth herein, USDOE's actions were taken \"without\nobservance ofprocedure required by law.\" 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).\n178. The rule imposes rights and obligations which, through administrative\nenforcement actions, applies generally to and binds all school districts, including\nDISTRICT.\n179. Under the Administrative Procedure Act, any \"rules which do not\nmerely interpret existing law or announce tentative policy positions but which\nestablish new policypositions that the agencytreats as bindingmustcomplywith the\nAPA's notice-and-comment requirements, regardless of how they initially are\nlabeled.\" 72 Fed. Reg. 3433.\n180. The United States Supreme Court has additionally ruled that all\nlegislative rules, which are those having the force and effect oflaw and are accorded\nweight in agency adjudicatory processes, are subject to notice-and-comment\nrequirements. Perezv.MortgageBankersAss'n, 135 S. Ct. 1199, 1204 (2015).\nPage | 44 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 45 of 65\n181. \"Notice-and-comment rulemaking\" requires that USDOE (1) issue a\ngeneral notice to the public of the proposed rule-making, typically by publishing\nnotice in the Federal Register; (2) give interested parties an opportunity to submit\nwritten data, views, or arguments on the proposed rule, and consider and respond to\nsignificant comments received; and (3) include in the promulgation ofthe final rule a\nconcise general statement ofthe rule's basis and purpose.\n182. Notice-and-commentrulemakingalso requires that USDOE consider all\nthe relevant comments offered during the public comment period before finally\ndecidingwhether to adopt the proposed rule.\n183. Additionally, under Title IX all final rules, regulations, and orders of\ngeneral applicability issued by USDOE must be approved by the President of the\nUnited States, who has hitherto declined to do so.\n184. USDOE promulgated and enforced its new rule redefining\"sex\" in Title\nIX to include \"gender identity\" without notice and comment as required by law. 5\nU.S.C. § 553. It promulgated this new legislative rule without signature by the\npresident as required by Title IX. 20 U.S.C. § 1682.\n185. Simply stated, USDOE did not follow the required procedure when it\nadopted its new rule defining \"sex\" in Title IX to mean, or include, gender identity.\nThis Court should therefore hold that it is unlawful, set it aside and remove it from\nits official website.\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the reliefset\nforth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief.\nPage | 45 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 46 of 65\nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n(Against DISTRICT and the FEDERAL DEFENDANTS):\nVIOLATION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY\n186. Plaintiffs re-allege all matters set forth in ^ 1 through 185 and\nincorporate them herein by reference.\n187. \"Fundamental rights\" are rights deeply rooted in this nation's history\nand tradition and are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, grounded in the\nFourteenthAmendment's Due Process Clause.\n188. Numerous courts have recognized a fundamental right to bodilyprivacy,\nwhich right includes a right to privacy ofone's fully or partially unclothed body and\nthe right to be free from State-compelled risk ofintimate exposure ofoneself to the\nopposite sex.\n189. Student Plaintiffs, like everyone else, enjoy the fundamental right to\nbodily privacy.\n190. The right to be free from State-compelled risk of intimate exposure of\noneselfto the opposite sex, while part ofthe right to bodily privacy, is a fundamental\nright grounded in the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\n191. Throughout its history, American law and society have recognized and\nupheld a commitment to protecting citizens, and especially children, from suffering\nthe risk ofexposing their bodies, or their intimate activities, to the opposite sex.\n192. From colonial times, the law allowed civil actions against \"Peeping\nToms\", and as American law developed after the Founding, it criminalized\nsurreptitiously viewing others while they reasonably expect privacy.\nPage | 46 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 47 of 65\n193. These protections are heightened for children.\n194. While pornography involving only adults is legal and cannot be\nconstitutionally banned, federal law makes it a crime to possess, distribute, or even\nview images ofnaked children. Moreover, nearly every state, including Oregon, has\nlaws criminalizing \"sexting,\" which occurs when someone (often a minor) sends a\nnaked picture ofhimsehTherselfvia email, text messaging, or other electronic means\nto a minor.\n195. In the late 1800s, as women began entering the workforce, the law\ndeveloped to protect privacy by mandating that workplace restrooms and changing\nrooms be separated by sex. Massachusetts adopted the first such law in 1887. By\n1920, 43 ofthe (then) 48 states had similarlawsprotectingprivacybymandatingsex-\nseparated facilities in the workplace.\n196. Because of our national commitment to protect our citizens, and\nespeciallychildren, from the risk ofbeingexposed to the anatomy ofthe opposite sex,\nas well as the risk of being seen by the opposite sex while attending to private,\nintimate needs, sex-separated restrooms, locker rooms and showers are an American\nsocial and modesty norm ubiquitous in public places, including public schools.\n197. Historically, purposefullyenteringa restroom orlocker room designated\nfor the opposite biological sex has been considered wrongful, and even criminal,\nbehavior, and historically there has been no mixing ofthe biological sexes in school\nrestrooms, locker rooms or showers.\nPage |47 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 48 of 65\n198. Freedom from the risk of compelled intimate exposure to the opposite\nsex, especiallyfor minors, is a fundamental rightdeeply rootedinthis nation's history\nand tradition and is also implicit in the concept ofordered liberty.\n199. The ability to be clothed in the presence ofthe opposite biological sex,\nalong with the freedom to use the restroom, locker room and shower away from the\npresence ofthe opposite biological sex, is fundamental to most people's sense ofself-\nrespect and personal dignity, including plaintiffs', who should be free from State-\ncompelled risk ofexposure oftheir bodies, or their intimate activities.\n200. Ifgovernment is granted the far-reaching and extreme power to compel\nitscitizens to disrobe or risk beingunclothedinthe presence ofthe opposite sex, little\npersonal liberty involving our bodies would remain.\n201. The government may not infringe fundamental rights, unless the\ninfringement satisfies strict scrutiny review, which requires that the government\ndemonstrate that the law or regulation furthers a compellinginterest using the least\nrestrictive means available.\n202. The StudentSafetyPlanallows StudentA, a biologicalfemale, andother\nbiological females the right of entry to, and use of, the boys' locker rooms, showers\nand restrooms any time she wants.\n203. The Student Safety Plan similarly allows biological male students who\nmay or may not identify as female access and use ofthe girls' locker rooms, showers\nand restrooms, andit similarly allows biologicalfemale students who may or maynot\nidentify as male access and use ofthe boys' locker rooms, showers and restrooms.\nPage | 48 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 49 of 65\n204. For these reasons, the Student Safety Plan requires Student Plaintiffs\nto risk being intimately exposed to those of the opposite biological sex, thereby\ninfringing Student Plaintiffs' fundamental right to privacy in their unclothed bodies,\nas well as their fundamental right to be free from government-compelled risk of\nintimate exposure to the opposite sex, without any compellingjustification.\n205. Defendants have no compellinginterest tojustifyforcing schoolchildren\nto share restrooms and locker rooms with opposite sex classmates, and Defendants\nhave not used the least restrictive means of serving any interest they may have.\n206. Accordingly, the Student Safety Plan fails strict scrutiny review and is\nunconstitutional as applied to any minor, including the Student Plaintiffs.\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the reliefset\nforth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief.\nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n(Against DISTRICT and the FEDERAL DEFENDANTS):\nVIOLATION OF PARENTS' FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO DIRECT THE\nEDUCATION AND UPBRINGING OF THEIR CHILDREN\n207. Plaintiffs re-allege all matters set forth in tH 1 through 185 and\nincorporate them herein.\n208. The right ofparents to make decisions concerningthe care, custody, and\ncontrol of their children is a fundamental right protected by the Fourteenth\nAmendment's Due Process Clause.\n209. Included within that parental fundamental right is the power to direct\nthe education and upbringing of one's children, including the right, as well as the\nPage |49 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 50 of 65\nduty, to instill moral standards and values in their children. Additionally, parents\nenjoy the fundamental right to notice and the opportunity to consent to their\nchildren's participation in surveys seeking personal and family information for use\nby schools and others.\n210. Parents' right and duty to instill moral standards and values in their\nchildren, and to direct their education and upbringing, encompasses the right to\ndetermine whether and when their minor children endure the risk ofbeing exposed\nto members ofthe opposite sex in intimate, vulnerable settings like restrooms, locker\nrooms and showers.\n211. Parents also have a fundamental right to determine whether and when\ntheir children will have to risk beingexposed to opposite sex nudity at school, as well\nas a fundamental right to determine whethertheirchildren, while at school, willhave\nto risk exposing their own undressed or partially unclothed bodies to members ofthe\nopposite sex.\n212. Defendants have no legal authority to dictate whether and when minor\nchildrenwillriskbeingexposedto the opposite sex and/or opposite-sex nudity in such\nsettings in derogation of each parents' right to decide for his or her own child,\nespecially when those children's parents object. Defendants further have no legal\nauthority to seek or obtain personal and family confidential information from\nstudents without the knowledge and consent oftheir parents or guardians.\n213. All Parent Plaintiffs object to the Student Safety Plan and agree that\nthey do not want their minor children to endure the risk of being exposed to the\nPage | 50 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 51 of 65\nopposite sex in intimate, vulnerable settings like locker rooms, showers and\nrestrooms, nor do they want their minor children to attend to their personal, private\nbodily needs in the presence ofmembers ofthe opposite sex.\n214. All Parent Plaintiffs desire to raise their children with a respect for\ntraditional modesty, which requires that one not undress or use the restroom in the\npresence ofthe opposite sex.\n215. All Parent Plaintiffs desire to prevent their children from enduring the\nrisk ofbeing observed while undressing by members ofthe opposite sex, or enduring\nthe risk ofbeing exposed to the unclothed bodies ofmembers ofthe opposite sex.\n216. Some Parent Plaintiffs, includingJONAND KRIS GOLLY, object to the\nStudent Safety Plan for religious reasons because of their sincerely-held religious\nbeliefs about modesty and other religious doctrines.\n217. The Student Safety Plan, instituted and enforced by the Defendants,\nimpermissibly infringes and undermines the right of Parent Plaintiffs to direct the\nupbringing and education oftheir children.\n218. Defendants may not infringe fundamental rights, including parents'\nfundamental right to direct the education and upbringing of their children, unless\nthe infringement satisfies strict scrutiny review, which requires that Defendants\ndemonstrate that the law or regulation furthers a compelling interest using the least\nrestrictive manner available.\n219. Defendants have no compellinginterestto justifyforcing schoolchildren\nto share restrooms, locker rooms and showers with opposite sex students, and\nPage | 51-COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 52 of 65\nDefendants have not used the least restrictive means of serving any interest they\nmay have.\n220. Accordingly, the Student Safety Plan fails strict scrutiny review and\nunconstitutionally infringes on parents' fundamental right to direct the education\nand upbringing oftheir children.\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the reliefset\nforth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief.\nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n(Against DISTRICT):\nVIOLATION OF TITLE IX\n221. Plaintiffs re-allege all matters set forth in f f 1 through 185 and\nincorporate them herein.\n222. Title IX provides that \"[n]o person in the United States shall, on the\nbasis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be\nsubjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving\nFederal financial assistance.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).\n223. Courts have given Title IX broad effect in order to combat sex\ndiscrimination in the educational setting.\n224. Title IX is a broadly-written generalprohibitionon discriminationbased\non sex that does not explicitly list every discriminatory act prohibited.\n225. There is an implied right of action under Title IX and no requirement\nthat a claimant must first exhaust administrative remedies before bringing a Title\nIX claim.\nPage | 52 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 53 of 65\n226. Allowing people to use restrooms, locker rooms or showers designated\nfor the opposite biological sex violates privacy and creates a sexually harassing\nhostile environment.\n227. Exposure to opposite-sex nudity creates a sexually harassing hostile\nenvironment.\n228. The Student Safety Plan allows some students to use locker rooms,\nrestrooms and showers designated for students ofthe opposite biological sex.\n229. The Student Safety Plan needlessly subjects Student Plaintiffs to the\nrisk that their partially or fully unclothed bodies will be exposed to students of the\nopposite sex and thatthey willbe exposedto opposite-sex nudity, causingthe Student\nPlaintiffs to experience embarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, intimidation, fear,\napprehension, stress, degradation, and loss ofdignity.\n230. Some Student Plaintiffs are avoiding the restroom as a result of the\nembarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, intimidation, fear, apprehension, stress,\ndegradation, and loss ofdignity they experience because ofthe Student Safety Plan.\n231. Some Student Plaintiffs are not able to concentrate as well in school as\nthey did before because ofthese policies.\n232. All Student Plaintiffs find that school has become intimidating and\nstressful as a result ofthe Student Safety Plan.\n233. The Student Safety Planviolates Title IX inthat itproduces unwelcome\nsexual harassment and create a hostile environment on the basis ofsex.\nPage | 53 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 54 of 65\n234. As recited below, Student Plaintiffs satisfy the five elements ofa Title\nIX in that they each: (1) belong to a protected group in that they are female and male\nstudents at an educational institution that receives federal funds; (2) were and are\nsubjected to harassment in that the Student Safety Plan allows biological males to\nuse girls' locker rooms, restrooms and showers, and further allows biological females\nto use the boys' locker rooms, restrooms and showers, thereby creating a sexually\nharassing hostile environment; (3) were and are subjected to harassment based on\nsex; (4) were subjected to harassment so pervasive or severe that it altered the\nconditions ofplaintiffs education; and (5) can establish knowledge by school officials.\n235. There are real and significant differences between the biological sexes,\nincludingbut not limited to differences in anatomy and physiology, which differences\ndo not disappear when biological males identify as female, and vice versa.\n236. Biological and anatomical differences between the sexes is the reason\nthat Title IX and its implementing regulations allow for separate living facihties,\nrestrooms, locker rooms and changing areas for each biological sex to recognize that\neach biological sex has unique needs and vulnerabilities when using these facihties.\n237. Title IX and its implementing regulations further allow for separate\nliving facilities, restrooms, locker rooms and changing areas for each biological sex\nbased on the recognition that permitting a biological male to enter and use such\nfacilities designated for females, or permitting a biological female student to enter\nand use such facilities designated for males would be sexually harassing to the\nopposite sex.\nPage | 54 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 55 of 65\n238. Moreover, both male and female Student Plaintiffs experience\nhumiliation, anxiety, intimidation, fear, apprehension, stress, degradation, and loss\nofdignity as a result ofthe Student Safety Plan permitting the opposite sex to be in\nlocker rooms and restrooms designated for their biological sex.\n239. Itisthe significantandrealdifferencesbetweenthe biologicalsexes that\ncreates the hostile environment, which is harassment.\n240. The harassment created by the Student Safety Plan, because it denies\nrealdifferences betweenthe biologicalsexes, is sufficientlysevere orpervasive (either\nofwhich is actionable) in that it is ongoing and continuous, occurring every time any\nofthe StudentPlaintiffs use the lockerroom, showers or restroom. It is further severe\nin that it places the bodily privacy ofboth sexes at risk.\n241. The environment is one that a reasonable person would find hostile or\nabusive, and one that Student Plaintiffs in fact perceive to be so.\n242. The sexually harassing hostile environment is threatening and\nhumiliating, and has altered the conditions of Student Plaintiffs' educational\nopportunities, benefits, programs and/or activities.\n243. DISTRICT officials are aware of the hostile environment and the fact\nDISTRICTS own official policies (including the Student Safety Plan) are the direct\ncause ofthis hostile environment because some Student Plaintiffs, and some Parent\nPlaintiffs, have contacted DISTRICT officials, including the principal and\nsuperintendent, about the hostile environment. Even though these officials have\nauthority to stop the hostile environment, and despite the knowledge that their\nPage | 55 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 56 of 65\npolicies are creating a hostile environment based on sex, Defendants have not\nremedied the situation. Instead, these officials have advised that, if the students\nperceive the environment to be hostile, the students should remove themselves from\nit by accepting an \"accommodation\" or using a different restroom.\n244. Schools cannot escape liability for Title IX violations by requiring the\nvictim of harassment to remove themselves from the hostile environment or\notherwise suggesting they are responsible for the harassment.\n245. Additionally, the accommodations themselves violate Title IX in that\nsome Girl Plaintiffs have been told that instead of using the locker room to change\nfor PE class, they may change their clothing in a nurse's office located on the other\nside of the school. This facility for changing is inferior to the locker room facilities\nprovidedfor boy students in violation of34 CFR§ 106.33, whichprovides that schools\nreceiving federal funding \"may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower\nfacilities on the basis ofsex, [as long as] such facilities provided for students ofone\nsex [are] comparable to such facilities provided for students ofthe other sex.\"\n246. Additionally, the accommodations themselves violate Title IX in that\nsome ofthe Student Plaintiffs have been told that, ifthey are uncomfortable using a\nrestroom because a member of the opposite sex is present, they may find another\nrestroom. Because there are only five minutes between classes, any student leaving\none restroom to find another is almost certain to be tardy and will also miss\ninstructional time.\nPage | 56 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 57 of 65\n247. The Student Safety Plan violates Title IX by creating a hostile\nenvironment on the basis ofsex.\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the reliefset\nforth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief.\nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n(Against FEDERAL DEFENDANTS):\nRELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT\n42 USC §§ 2000bb et seq\n43\n248. Plaintiffs re-allege all matters set forth in UK 1 through 184 and\nincorporate them herein.\n249. Many Student Plaintiffs have religious convictions that they practice\nmodesty. These students have the sincere religious beliefthatthey must not undress,\nor use the restroom, in the presence ofthe opposite biological sex, and also that they\nmust not be in the presence ofthe opposite biological sex while the opposite biological\nsex is undressing or using the restroom.\n250. Some Parent Plaintiffs, including JON AND KRIS GOLLY, have the\nsincere religious beliefthat they must teachtheir children to practice modesty. Their\nreligious faith also requires them to protect the modesty of their children. These\nparents have the sincere religious beliefthat their children must not undress, or use\nthe restroom, in the presence ofa member ofthe opposite biological sex, and also that\nthey must not be in the presence of the opposite biological sex while the opposite\nbiological sex is undressing or using the restroom.\n251. The Student Safety Plan requires Student Plaintiffs to use restrooms,\nlocker rooms and shower rooms, knowing that a student ofthe opposite biological sex\nPage | 57 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 58 of 65\neither is present with them, or could enter while they are using these private\nfacilities.\n252. The Student SafetyPlanprevents StudentPlaintiffs from practicingthe\nmodesty that their faith requires of them, and it further interferes with Parent\nPlaintiffs teaching their children traditional modesty and insisting that their\nchildren practice modesty, as their faith requires ofParent Plaintiffs.\n253. Complyingwiththe requirementsofthe StudentSafetyPlanthusplaces\na substantial burden on the Plaintiffs' exercise ofreligion by requiring Plaintiffs' to\nchoose between the benefit of a free public education and violating their religious\nbeliefs.\n254. Federal Defendants have no \"compelling interest\" that would justify\nburdeningPlaintiffs' exercise ofreligion inthis manner, nor have they used the \"least\nrestrictive means\" to achieve theirpurportedinterestinburdeningPlaintiffs'exercise\nofreligion in this manner.\n255. The Student Safety Plan thus violates Plaintiffs' rights protected by the\nReligious Freedom Restoration Act.\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the reliefset\nforth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief.\nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n(Against DISTRICT and the FEDERAL DEFENDANTS):\nVIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT'S GUARANTEE OF\nFREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION\nPage | 58 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 59 of 65\n256. Plaintiffs re-allege all matters set forth in HI 1 through 255 and\nincorporate them herein.\n257. The First Amendment provides that Congress shall make no law\nrespecting an establishment ofreligion, nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\n258. The Student Safety Plan burdened the free exercise rights of some\nPlaintiffs as previously alleged.\n259. Laws that burden free exercise, but are not neutral or generally\napplicable, are subject to strict scrutiny.\n260. The Student Safety Plan is not generally applicable in that it does not\nexpressly allow all students to use the opposite-sex restrooms, locker rooms and\nshowers, but arguably only students who perceive themselves as a different gender\nthan their biological sex, and further may allow accommodations ofsome, but not all,\nstudents.\n261. Similarly, the Student Safety Plan is not generally applicable in that it\napplies only to one student, Student A, but does not apply to all students, allowing\nthem to access whatever locker and shower rooms they want.\n262. The Student Safety Plan does not even apply to all students who\nperceive their gender identity to be different than their biological sex.\n263. Because the Student Safety Planis not generally applicable, itis subject\nto strict scrutiny, which it fails.\n264. Additionally, the Student Safety Plan is subject to strict scrutiny and\nfails the strict scrutiny standard because, in addition to burdening free exercise\nPage | 59 - COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 60 of 65\nrights, it also burdens other constitutional rights, including the privacy rights of\nStudent Plaintiffs and the parental rights ofParent Plaintiffs as alleged above.\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the\nreliefset forth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief.\nSEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF\nPUBLIC ACCOMMODATION DISCRIMINATION\nORS 659A.400 et sea.

A School'sObligation to Respondto SexualViolence\nA-l. What issexual violence?\nAnswer: Sexual violence, as thatterm isused inthis document and priorOCRguidance,\nrefers to physical sexual acts perpetrated againsta person's willorwhere a person is\nincapable of givingconsent {e.g., due to the student's age or use of drugs oralcohol, or\nbecausean intellectual orotherdisability preventsthe studentfrom having the capacity\ntogive consent). Anumber of differentacts fall intothe categoryofsexual violence,\nincluding rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual abuse, and sexual coercion. Sexual\nviolence can be carried out by school employees, otherstudents, orthird parties. Allsuch\nacts of sexual violence areforms of sex discrimination prohibited byTitle IX.\nA-2. How doesTitle IXapplyto student-on-studentsexualviolence?\nAnswer: UnderTitle IX, federallyfunded schools must ensurethat studentsofall ages are\nnot denied or limited in their abilityto participate in or benefitfrom the school's\neducational programs oractivities on the basis of sex. Aschool violates a student's rights\nunderTitle IX regarding student-on-student sexual violence when the following conditions\nare met: (1)the alleged conduct issufficientlyseriousto limit ordenya student's abilityto\nparticipate inor benefitfrom the school's educational program, i.e. creates a hostile\nenvironment; and (2) the school, upon notice, fails to take promptand effective steps\nreasonablycalculated to end the sexual violence, eliminatethe hostile environment,\nprevent itsrecurrence, and,asappropriate, remedy itseffects.9\nA-3. How does OCRdetermine ifa hostileenvironment has been created?\nAnswer: Asdiscussed morefully in OCR's2001 Guidance, OCRconsidersa varietyof\nrelated factors to determine ifa hostile environment has been created; and also considers\nthe conduct inquestion from both a subjectiveand an objective perspective. Specifically,\nOCR'sstandards require that the conduct be evaluated from the perspective of a\nreasonable person inthe alleged victim's position, consideringallthe circumstances.The\nmore severethe conduct, the less need there isto showa repetitive series ofincidentsto\nprove a hostile environment, particularlyifthe conduct isphysical. Indeed, a singleor\nisolated incidentofsexual violence maycreatea hostile environment.\n9Thisisthestandard foradministrativeenforcementofTitleIXandincourtcaseswhere plaintiffsareseeking\ninjunctiverelief.See2001Guidanceat ii-v,12-13.

When does OCRconsidera schoolto have noticeofstudent-on-studentsexual violence?\nAnswer: OCR deemsa school to have notice ofstudent-on-studentsexual violence if a\nresponsible employee knew, orin the exercise ofreasonable careshould have known,\naboutthe sexual violence. See question D-2regarding who isa responsible employee.\nAschool can receive notice of sexual violence inmany different ways. Some examplesof\nnotice include: a student may havefiled a grievance with orotherwise informed the\nschool'sTitle IX coordinator; a student, parent, friend, orother individual may have\nreported an incidentto a teacher, principal, campus lawenforcement, staffin the office of\nstudentaffairs, orother responsible employee; ora teacherordean may have witnessed\nthe sexual violence.\nThe school mayalso receive notice about sexual violence inan indirect manner, from\nsourcessuch as a memberofthe local community, social networking sites, orthe media.\nInsome situations, ifthe school knows ofincidents ofsexual violence, the exercise of\nreasonable care should triggeran investigation that would lead to the discoveryof\nadditional incidents. For example, ifschool officials receive a credible reportthat a\nstudent has perpetrated several acts ofsexual violence against different students, that\npattern of conductshould trigger an inquiry as to whetherotherstudents have been\nsubjected to sexual violence bythatstudent. Inothercases, the pervasiveness of the\nsexual violence may bewidespread, openly practiced, orwell-known among studentsor\nemployees. Inthose cases, OCR mayconclude thatthe school should have known ofthe\nhostile environment. In otherwords, ifthe school would havefound out aboutthe sexual\nviolence had it made a properinquiry, knowledge ofthe sexual violence willbe imputed\nto the school even ifthe school failed to make an inquiry. Aschool'sfailure to take\npromptand effectivecorrective action insuch cases (as described inquestions G-lto G-3\nand H-lto H-3)would violateTitle IXeven ifthe student did not use the school's\ngrievance proceduresor otherwise inform the school ofthe sexual violence.\nA-5. What are a school's basic responsibilitiesto address student-on-studentsexual\nviolence?\nAnswer: When a school knows or reasonablyshould know ofpossible sexual violence, it\nmusttake immediate and appropriate stepsto investigateorotherwise determine what\noccurred (subjectto the confidentiality provisions discussed inSection E). Ifan\ninvestigation reveals that sexualviolence created a hostile environment, the school must\nthen take promptand effective steps reasonably calculated to end the sexual violence,\neliminatethe hostile environment, prevent its recurrence, and, as appropriate, remedy its\nPage 2- Questionsand Answerson Title IXand SexualViolence\nEXHIBIT VA\nPAGE\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 30 of 73\neffects. Buta school should not wait to take stepsto protect its students until students\nhave already been deprived of educational opportunities.\nTitle IX requiresa school to protectthe complainantand ensure hisor hersafety as\nnecessary, includingtaking interim stepsbeforethefinal outcomeofanyinvestigation.10\nTheschool should takethese steps promptlyonce it has notice ofa sexual violence\nallegation and should providethe complainantwith periodic updates on the statusof the\ninvestigation. Ifthe school determinesthatthe sexual violence occurred, the school must\ncontinue to takethese steps to protectthe complainant and ensure his or hersafety, as\nnecessary.The school should also ensurethatthe complainant isaware of anyavailable\nresources, such as victim advocacy, housing assistance, academic support, counseling,\ndisabilityservices, health and mental health services, and legal assistance, and the right to\nreporta crimeto campus or local lawenforcement. For additional information on interim\nmeasures, see questions G-lto G-3.\nIfa school delays respondingto allegationsof sexual violence or responds inappropriately,\nthe school'sown inaction maysubject the studentto a hostile environment. Ifit does, the\nschool will also be required to remedythe effectsofthe sexual violencethat could\nreasonably have been prevented had the school responded promptlyand appropriately.\nForexample, ifa school's ignoring of a student's complaintsofsexual assault bya fellow\nstudent results inthe complainingstudent havingto remain in classes with the other\nstudentfor several weeks and the complainingstudent'sgradessuffer because he orshe\nwas unableto concentrate in these classes, the school may need to permitthe\ncomplainingstudentto retake the classes without an academic orfinancial penalty(in\naddition to anyother remedies) inorderto addressthe effects ofthesexual violence.\nA-6. DoesTitle IXcoveremployee-on-studentsexualviolence, such as sexual abuseof\nchildren?\nAnswer: Yes.Although this document and the DCLfocus on student-on-studentsexual\nviolence, Title IX also protectsstudentsfrom otherforms of sexual harassment (including\nsexual violence and sexual abuse), such as sexual harassment carried out by school\nemployees. Sexual harassment byschool employees can include unwelcome sexual\nadvances; requestsfor sexual favors; and otherverbal, nonverbal, or physicalconductofa\nsexual nature, including but not limited to sexual activity. Title IX's prohibition against\n\"Throughoutthisdocument, unlessotherwisenoted,theterm\"complainant\"referstothestudentwhoallegedly\nexperiencedthesexualviolence.\nPage3- Questionsand Answers onTitleIXand SexualViolence\nEXHIBIT \\4\nPAGE CD\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 31 of 73\nsexual harassmentgenerallydoes not extend to legitimate nonsexual touchingorother\nnonsexualconduct. Butinsome circumstances,nonsexual conduct maytake on sexual\nconnotations and riseto the levelof sexual harassment. Forexample, ateacher\nrepeatedlyhuggingand putting hisorherarmsaround students under inappropriate\ncircumstances could create ahostile environment. Early signsofinappropriate behavior\nwith achildcan be the key to identifying and preventing sexual abuse by school\npersonnel.\nAschool'sTitle IX obligations regarding sexual harassment by employees can, insome\ninstances, be greaterthan those described inthis document and the DCL. Recipients\nshould refer to OCR's2001 Guidancefor further information aboutTitle IX obligations\nregarding harassmentofstudents by school employees. Inaddition, manystate and local\nlaws have mandatory reporting requirements for schoolsworkingwith minors. Recipients\nshould be carefulto satisfytheirstate and local legalobligations in addition totheirTitle\nIX obligations, includingtrainingto ensurethat school employeesare aware oftheir\nobligations undersuch state and local laws and the consequences for failing to satisfy\nthose obligations.\nWith respectto sexual activity in particular, OCRwill always viewas unwelcome and\nnonconsensual sexual activity between an adult school employee and an elementary\nschool student or any student belowthe legal age ofconsent in his or herstate. Incases\ninvolving astudentwho meetsthe legalage ofconsent in his or herstate, there will still\nbe astrong presumptionthat sexual activitybetween an adult school employee and a\nstudent is unwelcome and nonconsensual. When a school is on noticethat a school\nemployee has sexually harassed astudent, it isresponsible for taking prompt and\neffective steps reasonablycalculatedto end the sexual harassment, eliminatethe hostile\nenvironment, prevent its recurrence, and remedyits effects. Indeed, even if aschool was\nnoton notice, the school is nonetheless responsible for remedying anyeffects ofthe\nsexual harassmenton the student, as well as for endingthe sexual harassmentand\npreventing its recurrence, when the employee engaged inthe sexual activity inthe\ncontextofthe employee's provision ofaid,benefits, or servicesto students {e.g.,\nteaching, counseling, supervising, advising, ortransporting students).\nAschool should take steps to protect its students from sexual abuse by its employees. Itis\ntherefore imperative foraschoolto develop policiesprohibiting inappropriate conduct by\nschool personnel and procedures for identifying and respondingto such conduct. For\nexample, this could include implementingcodes of conduct, which mightaddresswhat is\ncommonly known asgrooming -a desensitization strategycommon inadult educator\nsexual misconduct. Such policiesand procedurescan ensurethat students, parents, and\nPage4-Questionsand AnswersonTitle IXand SexualViolence EXHIBIT W\nPAGE W\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 32 of 73\nschool personnel have clearguidelines on what are appropriate and inappropriate\ninteractions between adults and students ina school setting or in school-sponsored\nactivities. Additionally, a school should provide training for administrators, teachers, staff,\nparents, and age-appropriate classroom information for students to ensure that everyone\nunderstands what types of conduct are prohibited and knows how to respond when\nproblemsarise.11\nB. Students Protected byTitle IX\nB-l. DoesTitle IX protect all students from sexual violence?\nAnswer: Yes.Title IX protects all students at recipient institutions from sex discrimination,\nincludingsexual violence. Anystudentcan experience sexual violence: from elementaryto\nprofessional school students; male and female students; straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual\nand transgender students; part-time and full-time students; students with and without\ndisabilities; and studentsof different races and national origins.\nB-2. How should a school handle sexual violence complaints in which the complainant and\nthe alleged perpetrator are membersofthe same sex?\nAnswer: Aschool's obligation to respond appropriately to sexual violence complaints is\nthe same irrespective of the sex orsexes of the parties involved. Title IX protectsall\nstudentsfrom sexual violence, regardless of the sex of the alleged perpetratoror\ncomplainant, including when they are members of the same sex. Aschool must\ninvestigate and resolve allegations of sexual violence involving parties ofthe same sex\nusing the same procedures and standards that it uses in all complaints involving sexual\nviolence.\nTitle IX'ssex discrimination prohibition extends to claims of discrimination based on\ngender identity orfailure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity orfemininity\nand OCRaccepts such complaints for investigation. Similarly, the actual or perceived\nsexual orientation orgender identity ofthe parties does not change a school's obligations.\nIndeed, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth report high rates of sexual\nharassment and sexual violence. Aschool should investigate and resolve allegations of\nsexual violence regarding LGBTstudents using the same procedures and standards that it\n11Foradditional informational ontrainingpleaseseethe DepartmentofEducation'sResourceand Emergency\nManagementforSchoolsTechnical Assistance Center- AdultSexualMisconduct inSchools: Prevention and\nManagementTraining,available at http://rems.ed.Rov/Docs/ASM Marketing Flyer.pdf.\nPage 5-Questionsand Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence FXHiRIT IX\nPAGE lO-\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 33 of 73\nuses inall complaints involving sexual violence. The fact that incidents ofsexual violence\nmay be accompanied by anti-gay comments or be partly based on a student's actual or\nperceived sexual orientation does not relieve a school of its obligation underTitle IX to\ninvestigate and remedy those instances of sexual violence.\nIfa school's policies related to sexual violence include examples of particular types of\nconduct that violate the school's prohibition on sexual violence, the school should\nconsider including examples of same-sex conduct. In addition, a school should ensure that\nstaffare capable of providing culturally competentcounseling to all complainants. Thus, a\nschool should ensure that its counselors and otherstaff who are responsible for receiving\nand responding to complaints of sexual violence, including investigators and hearing\nboard members, receive appropriate training about working with LGBT and gender-\nnonconforming students and same-sexsexual violence. See questions J-1 to J-4 for\nadditional information regarding training.\nGay-straight alliances and similarstudent-initiated groups can also play an important role\nin creating saferschool environmentsfor LGBTstudents. On June 14, 2011, the\nDepartment issued guidance about the rights ofstudent-initiated groups in public\nsecondaryschools underthe Equal Access Act. That guidance isavailable at\nhttp://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/guid/secletter/110607.html.\nB-3. What issues may arise with respectto students with disabilities who experience sexual\nviolence?\nAnswer: When students with disabilities experience sexual violence, federal civil rights\nlaws other than Title IX may also be relevant to a school's responsibility to investigate and\naddress suchincidents.12 Certainstudents requireadditionalassistance and support. For\nexample, students with intellectual disabilities may need additional help in learning about\nsexual violence, including a school's sexual violence education and prevention programs,\nwhat constitutes sexual violence and how students can report incidentsofsexual\n12OCRenforcestwocivil rights lawsthatprohibitdisabilitydiscrimination.Section 504oftheRehabilitation Actof\n1973(Section504) prohibitsdisabilitydiscrimination bypublicor private entities that receive federal financial\nassistance, and Title II oftheAmerican with DisabilitiesActof1990(TitleII) prohibits disabilitydiscrimination byall\nstate and localpublicentities, regardlessofwhetherthey receivefederal funding.

Postsecondarystudentswho need these additional servicesand supports can\nseekassistancefrom the institution'sdisability resource office.\nAstudent who has not been previously determined to have a disability may, as a resultof\nexperiencingsexual violence, develop a mental health-related disabilitythat could cause\nthestudentto need special education and related services. Atthe elementaryand\nsecondaryeducation level, this maytriggera school'schild find obligations under IDEA\nand the evaluation and placement requirements underSection 504, which together\nrequire a school to evaluate a studentsuspected of having a disabilityto determine ifhe\norshehasadisabilitythat requires special education or relatedaidsandservices.13\nAschool mustalso ensure that anyschool reportingforms, information, ortraining about\nsexual violence be provided ina mannerthat isaccessible to studentsand employees with\ndisabilities, for example, by providingelectronically-accessible versions ofpaperforms to\nindividualswith print disabilities, orby providinga sign language interpreterto a deaf\nindividual attending a training. See questionJ-4 for more detailed information on student\ntraining.\nB-4. What issuesarise with respectto international students and undocumented students\nwho experience sexualviolence?\nAnswer:Title IX protects allstudentsat recipient institutions inthe United States\nregardless ofnational origin, immigration status,orcitizenship status.14Aschool should\nensurethatall students regardless of their immigration status, including undocumented\nstudentsand international students, are aware oftheir rights underTitle IX. Aschool must\nalso ensurethatanyschool reportingforms, information, ortraining aboutsexual violence\nbe provided ina manneraccessibleto studentswho are English language learners. OCR\nrecommendsthat a school coordinate with its international office and its undocumented\nstudent program coordinator, ifapplicable, to help communicate information aboutTitle\nIX inlanguagesthat are accessibleto thesegroups of students. OCRalso encourages\nschoolsto provideforeign national complainantswith information aboutthe U\nnonimmigrantstatusand theTnonimmigrantstatus.The Unonimmigrantstatus isset\n13See34C.F.R.§§300.8;300.111;300.201;300.300-300.311(IDEA);34C.F.R. §§104.3(j)and104.35(Section504).\nSchoolsmustcomplywithapplicableconsentrequirementswithrespect to evaluations.

Forexample, certain student visas require the\nstudent to maintain a full-time course load (generally at least 12 academic credit hours\nper term), but a student may need to take a reduced course load while recovering from\nthe immediate effects ofthe sexual violence. OCRrecommends that a school take steps to\nensure that international students on student visas understand that they must typically\nseek prior approval of the designated school official (DSO) for studentvisas to drop below\na full-time course load. Aschool may also want to encourage its employees involved in\nhandling sexual violence complaints and counseling students who have experienced\nsexual violence to approach the DSOon the student's behalf ifthe student wishes to drop\nbelow a full-time course load. OCRrecommends that a school take steps to ensure that its\nemployees who work with international students, including the school's DSO,are trained\non the school's sexual violence policies and that employees involved in handling sexual\nviolence complaints and counselingstudents who have experienced sexual violence are\naware ofthe special issues that international students may encounter. See questions J-1\nto J-4for additional information regarding training.\nAschool should also be aware that threatening students with deportation or invoking a\nstudent's immigration status in an attempt to intimidate or deter a student from filing a\nTitle IX complaint would violate Title IX'sprotections against retaliation.

Howshould a school respondto sexual violencewhenthe alleged perpetratorisnot\naffiliated withthe school?\nAnswer: The appropriate response willdifferdependingon the level of control the school\nhas overthe alleged perpetrator. Forexample, ifan athlete or band memberfrom a\nvisitingschool sexually assaultsa studentat the home school, the home school may not\nbe ableto discipline ortake otherdirectaction againstthe visiting athlete or band\nmember. However (and subjectto the confidentiality provisions discussed inSection E), it\nshould conduct an inquiry into whatoccurred and should report the incidentto the\nvisiting school and encourage the visitingschool to take appropriate action to prevent\nfurther sexual violence.The home school should also notifythe student of any righttofile\na complaintwith the alleged perpetrator's school or local lawenforcement. The home\nschool mayalso decide notto invitethe visiting school backto its campus.\nEventhough a school's abilityto take directaction againsta particular perpetrator may be\nlimited, the school muststill take stepsto provide appropriate remediesfor the\ncomplainantand, where appropriate, the broaderschool population.This may include\nproviding supportservicesforthe complainant, and issuing new policy statements making\nit clearthatthe school does nottolerate sexual violence and will respond to any reports\naboutsuch incidents. For additional information on interim measures see questionsG-1 to\nG-3.\nC. Title IX Procedural Requirements\nOverview\nC-1. What procedures mustaschool have in placeto preventsexual violenceand resolve\ncomplaints?\nAnswer: TheTitle IX regulations outlinethree key procedural requirements. Each school\nmust:\n(1) disseminate anotice ofnondiscrimination (see question C-2);17\n(2)designate at leastone employee to coordinate itseffortsto complywith and carry\noutitsresponsibilities underTitle IX (see questions C-3 to C-4);18and\n1734C.F.R. § 106.9.\n18Id. §106.8(a).\nPage9- Questionsand Answers onTitle IXandSexualViolence EXHIBIT V-\\\nPAGE LV\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 37 of 73\n(3)adopt and publish grievance procedures providingfor the prompt and equitable\nresolution of student and employee sex discrimination complaints (see questions C-5to\nC-6).19\nThese requirements apply to allforms of sex discrimination and are particularly important\nfor preventing and effectively responding to sexual violence.\nProcedural requirements under otherfederal laws may also applyto complaints of sexual\nviolence, including the requirementsofthe Clery Act.20 Foradditionalinformation about\nthe procedural requirements in the Clery Act please see\nhttp://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/campus.html.\nNotice ofNondiscrimination\nC-2. What information must be included in a school's notice of nondiscrimination?\nAnswer: The notice of nondiscrimination must state that the school does not discriminate\non the basis of sex in its education programs and activities, and that it is required by Title\nIX not to discriminate insuch a manner. The notice must state that questions regarding\nTitle IX may be referred to the school's Title IX coordinatoror to OCR.The school must\nnotify all of its students and employees of the name or title, office address, telephone\nnumber,andemail addressofthe school'sdesignated Title IX coordinator.21\nTitle IXCoordinator\nC-3. What are aTitle IXcoordinator's responsibilities?\nAnswer: ATitle IX coordinator's core responsibilities include overseeing the school's\nresponse to Title IX reports and complaints and identifying and addressing any patterns or\nsystemic problems revealed by such reports and complaints. This means that the Title IX\ncoordinator must have knowledge of the requirements of Title IX, of the school's own\npolicies and procedureson sex discrimination, and of allcomplaints raising Title IX issues\nthroughout the school. Toaccomplish this, subject to the exemption for school counseling\nemployees discussed inquestion E-3,the Title IX coordinator must be informed of all\n19Id.§106.8(b).\n20All postsecondaryinstitutions participatingin theHigher Education Act'sTitle IVstudentfinancial assistance\nprograms mustcomplywith the CleryAct.\n21 Formoreinformation onnotices ofnondiscrimination,pleasesee OCR's NoticeofNondiscrimination(August\n2010), available at http://www.ed.EOv/ocr/docs/nondisc.pdf.\nPage 10-Questionsand Answers on Title IX and SexualViolence cvWiRIT \\A-\nPAGE Vgh\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 38 of 73\nreports and complaints raisingTitleIX issues, even ifthe reportor complaint was initially\nfiledwith another individualor officeor ifthe investigation willbe conducted byanother\nindividualoroffice.The school should ensure thattheTitle IXcoordinatorisgiven the\ntraining, authority, and visibility necessaryto fulfillthese responsibilities.\nBecausetheTitle IXcoordinator must have knowledge of allTitle IX reports and\ncomplaintsatthe school, this individual (when properlytrained) isgenerally inthe best\nposition to evaluate a student's requestfor confidentiality inthe contextofthe school's\nresponsibilityto providea safeand nondiscriminatoryenvironmentfor allstudents. A\nschool maydetermine, however, that anotherindividual should perform this role. For\nadditional information on confidentiality requests, see questions E-l to E-4.

Isa school requiredto use separate grievance procedures for sexual violence\ncomplaints?\nAnswer: No. UnderTitle IX, a school may use studentdisciplinary procedures, general\nTitle IXgrievance procedures, sexual harassment procedures, orseparate proceduresto\nresolve sexual violence complaints. However, any procedures used for sexual violence\ncomplaints, including disciplinary procedures, must meettheTitle IX requirementof\naffordinga complainanta promptand equitable resolution (as discussed in question C-5),\nincluding applyingthe preponderance of the evidencestandard ofreview. Asdiscussed in\nquestion C-3, theTitle IX coordinatorshould review any process used to resolve\ncomplaintsof sexual violence to ensure itcomplieswith requirementsfor prompt and\nequitable resolution of these complaints. When using disciplinary procedures, which are\noften focused on the alleged perpetratorand can take considerabletime, a school should\nbe mindful ofits obligation to provide interim measuresto protectthe complainant inthe\neducational setting.

Which school employeesare obligatedto reportincidentsof possible sexual violenceto\nschool officials?\nAnswer: UnderTitle IX, whetheran individual isobligated to report incidentsofalleged\nsexual violence generallydepends on whetherthe individual isa responsible employee of\nthe school. Aresponsibleemployee must report incidents of sexual violenceto theTitle IX\ncoordinatoror otherappropriate school designee, subjectto the exemption for school\ncounseling employees discussed inquestion E-3.Thisisbecause, as discussed inquestion\nA-4,a school isobligated to address sexual violence about which a responsible employee\nknew or should have known.

Who isa\"responsible employee\"?\nAnswer: According to OCR's2001 Guidance, a responsible employee includes any\nemployee: who hasthe authorityto take action to redress sexual violence; who has been\ngiven the dutyof reporting incidentsof sexual violence or any othermisconduct by\nstudentsto theTitle IXcoordinatororotherappropriate school designee; orwhom a\nstudentcould reasonably believe hasthisauthorityorduty.23\nAschool must make clearto all ofits employeesand studentswhich staffmembersare\nresponsible employeesso that students can make informed decisions about whetherto\ndisclose information to those employees. Aschool must also inform allemployeesoftheir\nown reporting responsibilitiesand the importanceofinforming complainants of: the\nreportingobligations ofresponsible employees; complainants' option to request\nconfidentialityand available confidential advocacy, counseling, orothersupportservices;\nand complainants' rightto file aTitle IXcomplaintwith the school and to report a crime to\ncampusor local law enforcement.\nWhetheran employee isa responsible employeewillvarydepending on factors such as\nthe age and education level of the student, the type of position held by the employee, and\nconsideration ofbothformal and informal school practicesand procedures. For example,\nwhile it may be reasonable for an elementaryschool studentto believe that a custodial\nstaffmemberorcafeteria worker hasthe authorityorresponsibilityto address student\nmisconduct, it is less reasonable for a college studentto believe that a custodial staff\nmemberordining hall employee hasthis same authority.\nAsnoted in response to question A-4,when a responsible employee knows or reasonably\nshould knowof possible sexual violence, OCR deems a school to have notice of the sexual\nviolence.The school musttake immediate and appropriate stepsto investigate or\notherwise determine what occurred (subjectto the confidentiality provisions discussed in\nSection E), and, ifthe school determinesthatsexual violence created a hostile\nenvironment, the school mustthen take appropriate stepsto addressthe situation.The\n23TheSupremeCourtheldthataschoolwillonlybeliableformoneydamagesinaprivatelawsuitwherethereis\nactual noticeto aschool officialwith theauthorityto addressthealleged discrimination andtakecorrectiveaction.\nGebserv.

What information isa responsible employee obligatedto reportaboutan incidentof\npossible student-on-studentsexual violence?\nAnswer:Subjectto the exemption for school counselingemployees discussed in question\nE-3,a responsible employee must reportto the school'sTitle IXcoordinator, orother\nappropriate school designee, all relevant details aboutthe alleged sexual violence thatthe\nstudentoranother person hasshared and thatthe school will need to determine what\noccurred and to resolve the situation.This includesthe names ofthe alleged perpetrator\n(ifknown), the studentwho experienced the alleged sexual violence, otherstudents\ninvolved inthe alleged sexual violence, as well as relevantfacts, includingthe date, time,\nand location. Aschool must make clearto its responsible employeesto whom theyshould\nreport an incidentofalleged sexual violence.\nTo ensure compliance with these reportingobligations, it is importantfor a school to train\nits responsible employees onTitle IX and the school'ssexual violence policies and\nprocedures. For more information on appropriatetrainingfor school employees, see\nquestionJ-1 toJ-3.\nD-4. What should a responsible employeetell a studentwho discloses an incidentofsexual\nviolence?\nAnswer: Before a student reveals information that he orshe maywish to keep\nconfidential, a responsible employee should make everyeffortto ensurethat the student\nunderstands: (i)the employee'sobligation to report the names of the alleged perpetrator\nand student involved inthe alleged sexual violence, as well as relevantfacts regardingthe\nalleged incident (including the date, time, and location), to theTitle IX coordinatoror\notherappropriate school officials, (ii) the student's option to requestthatthe school\nmaintain his or herconfidentiality, which the school {e.g.,Title IX coordinator) will\nconsider, and (iii) the student's abilityto share the information confidentiallywith\ncounseling, advocacy, health, mental health, or sexual-assault-related services {e.g.,\nsexual assault resourcecenters, campus health centers, pastoral counselors, and campus\nmental health centers). Asdiscussed inquestions E-l and E-2,ifthe student requests\nconfidentiality, theTitleIX coordinator or otherappropriate school designee responsible\nfor evaluating requestsfor confidentialityshould make every effortto respectthis request\nPage16- Questionsand Answerson Title IXandSexualViolence\nEXHIBIT &_\nPAGE ^3\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 44 of 73\nand should evaluatethe request inthe context ofthe school's responsibilityto provide a\nsafe and nondiscriminatoryenvironmentfor allstudents.\nD-5. Ifastudentinforms a residentassistant/advisor(RA)that he or shewas subjectedto\nsexual violence bya fellow student, isthe RAobligated underTitle IXto reportthe\nincidentto school officials?\nAnswer: Asdiscussed in questions D-1and D-2,forTitle IX purposes, whetheran\nindividual isobligated underTitle IXto report alleged sexual violenceto the school'sTitle\nIX coordinatororotherappropriate school designee generallydependson whetherthe\nindividual isa responsible employee.\nThe duties and responsibilities ofRAsvaryamong schools, and, therefore, a school should\nconsider its own policies and procedures to determine whether its RAsare responsible\nemployeeswho must report incidents ofsexual violenceto theTitle IX coordinatoror\notherappropriate school designee.24When makingthisdetermination, aschool should\nconsiderifits RAs have the general authorityto take action to redress misconduct orthe\ndutyto report misconductto appropriate school officials, as well as whetherstudents\ncould reasonably believethat RAshavethisauthorityorduty. Aschool should also\nconsiderwhetherit has determined and clearly informed studentsthat RAsare generally\navailable for confidential discussions and do not have the authority or responsibilityto\ntake action to redress any misconduct orto report any misconductto theTitle IX\ncoordinatororotherappropriate school officials. Aschool should pay particularattention\nto its RAs' obligationsto reportotherstudentviolations of school policy {e.g., drug and\nalcohol violations or physical assault). Ifan RA isrequired to report othermisconductthat\nviolatesschool policy, then the RA would be considered a responsible employee obligated\nto report incidentsof sexual violencethat violateschool policy.\nIfan RA isa responsible employee, the RAshould make everyeffort to ensurethat before\nthe student reveals information that he orshe may wish to keep confidential, the student\nunderstandsthe RA's reporting obligation and the student'soption to requestthatthe\nschool maintain confidentiality. Itistherefore importantthat schools widely disseminate\npoliciesand provide regulartrainingclearly identifying the placeswhere students can seek\nconfidential supportservicesso that studentsare aware ofthis information. The RA\n24Postsecondaryinstitutionsshouldbeawarethat,regardlessofwhetheranRAisaresponsibleemployeeunder\nTitleIX, RAsare considered \"campussecurityauthorities\" underthe CleryAct.Aschool's responsibilities inregard\nto crimesreported to campussecurityauthorities arediscussedinthe Department'sregulationsontheCleryActat\n34C.F.R. § 668.46.\nPage 17- Questionsand Answers on Title IXandSexual Violence rx/l lim_\ne EXHIBIT U^\nPAGE ^\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 45 of 73\nshould also explain to the student (again, beforethe student reveals information that he\nor she may wish to keep confidential) that, although the RA must reportthe names ofthe\nalleged perpetrator (ifknown), the studentwho experienced the alleged sexual violence,\notherstudents involved inthe alleged sexual violence, as wellas relevantfacts, including\nthe date, time, and location to theTitle IX coordinatororotherappropriate school\ndesignee, the school willprotectthe student'sconfidentialityto the greatest extent\npossible. Priorto providing information aboutthe incident to theTitle IX coordinator or\notherappropriate school designee, the RAshould consultwith the studentabout how to\nprotect his or hersafetyand the details ofwhatwill beshared with theTitle IX\ncoordinator.The RAshould explain to the student that reportingthis information to the\nTitle IXcoordinatororotherappropriate school designee does not necessarily mean thata\nformal complaintor investigation underthe school'sTitle IXgrievance procedure must be\ninitiated ifthe student requests confidentiality. Asdiscussed in questions E-l and E-2,if\nthestudent requests confidentiality, theTitle IXcoordinatororother appropriate school\ndesignee responsibleforevaluating requestsfor confidentialityshould make everyeffort\nto respectthis request and should evaluatethe request inthe contextofthe school's\nresponsibilityto providea safeand nondiscriminatoryenvironmentfor allstudents.\nRegardless of whethera reportingobligation exists, all RAs should inform studentsoftheir\nrightto file aTitle IX complaint with the school and report a crimeto campus or local law\nenforcement. Ifa student disclosessexual violenceto an RAwho isa responsible\nemployee, the school willbe deemedto have notice of the sexual violence even ifthe\nstudentdoes notfile a Title IX complaint. Additionally, all RAsshould providestudents\nwith information regardingon-campus resources, includingvictim advocacy, housing\nassistance, academicsupport, counseling, disabilityservices, health and mental health\nservices, and legal assistance. RAs should also be familiar with local rape crisis centersor\notheroff-campus resources and providethis information to students.\nE. Confidentialityand a School'sObligationto RespondtoSexual Violence\nE-l. How should a school respondto astudent's requestthat his or hername not be\ndisclosedtothe alleged perpetratororthat no investigation or disciplinaryaction be\npursuedto addressthe alleged sexualviolence?\nAnswer: Students, or parentsof minorstudents, reporting incidents of sexual violence\nsometimesaskthatthe students' names not be disclosed to the alleged perpetratorsor\nthat no investigation or disciplinaryaction be pursued to address the alleged sexual\nviolence. OCR strongly supports a student's interest inconfidentiality incases involving\nsexual violence.There are situations in which a school mustoverridea student's request\nPage18- Questionsand Answers onTitle IXand SexualViolence PYUIRIT \\1\nPAGE ^^\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 46 of 73\nfor confidentiality inorderto meet itsTitle IX obligations; however, these instances will be\nlimited and the information should only be shared with individuals who are responsible\nfor handlingthe school's responseto incidents ofsexual violence. Given the sensitive\nnature ofreportsofsexual violence, a school should ensurethatthe information is\nmaintained inasecure manner. Aschool should be aware that disregarding requests for\nconfidentialitycan have achillingeffectand discourage otherstudents from reporting\nsexual violence. Inthe case ofminors, state mandatory reporting laws may require\ndisclosure, but can generally be followed withoutdisclosing information to school\npersonnel who are not responsible for handlingthe school's response to incidents of\nsexual violence.25\nEven ifastudent does not specificallyask for confidentiality, tothe extent possible, a\nschool should only disclose information regarding alleged incidents ofsexual violenceto\nindividualswho are responsible for handlingthe school's response. To improvetrust in\nthe process for investigating sexual violence complaints, a school should notifystudents of\nthe information that will be disclosed, to whom it will be disclosed, and why. Regardless\nofwhetherastudent complainant requests confidentiality, aschool musttake stepsto\nprotectthe complainantas necessary, includingtaking interim measures beforethe final\noutcomeofan investigation. Foradditional information on interim measures see\nquestionsG-1 to G-3.\nForTitle IX purposes, ifa student requeststhat his or her name not be revealed to the\nalleged perpetratoror asksthatthe school not investigate or seekaction againstthe\nalleged perpetrator, the school should inform the studentthat honoringthe request may\nlimit its abilityto respond fully tothe incident, including pursuing disciplinary action\nagainstthe alleged perpetrator.The school should also explain thatTitle IX includes\nprotections against retaliation, and that school officials will notonlytake stepsto prevent\nretaliation but also take strong responsive action ifitoccurs.This includes retaliatory\nactionstaken by the school and school officials. When aschool knows or reasonably\nshould know of possible retaliation by otherstudents orthird parties, includingthreats,\nintimidation, coercion, or discrimination (including harassment), it musttake immediate\n25Theschoolshouldbeawareoftheallegedstudentperpetrator'srightundertheFamilyEducational Rightsand\nPrivacyAct(\"FERPA\")torequestto inspectandreviewinformationaboutthe allegationsifthe informationdirectly\nrelatesto thealleged studentperpetratorand theinformationismaintainedbytheschool asan education record.\nInsuchacase,the schoolmust eitherredact the complainant'sname andallidentifyinginformation before\nallowingtheallegedperpetrator toinspectandreviewthesectionsofthecomplaintthat relateto himorher,or\nmustinformthe allegedperpetratorofthe specificinformationinthe complaintthatare aboutthe alleged\nperpetrator.See34C.F.R.§99.12(a)Theschoolshouldalsomakecomplainantsawareofthisrightandexplain\nhowitmightaffecttheschool's abilityto maintaincomplete confidentiality.\nPage19- Questionsand Answers onTitle IXand SexualViolence FYHIRIT VA\nPAGE ^Q\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 47 of 73\nand appropriate stepsto investigate or otherwise determine what occurred. Title IX\nrequires the school to protectthe complainantand ensure hisor her safetyas necessary.\nSee question K-l regarding retaliation.\nIfthe student stillrequeststhat hisor her name not be disclosed to the alleged\nperpetratororthatthe school not investigate or seek action againstthe alleged\nperpetrator, the school willneed to determine whetheror not itcan honorsuch a request\nwhile still providing asafe and nondiscriminatoryenvironment for allstudents, including\nthe studentwho reported the sexual violence. As discussed inquestion C-3,theTitle IX\ncoordinator isgenerallyinthe best positionto evaluate confidentiality requests. Because\nschoolsvarywidely in size and administrative structure, OCRrecognizes that a school may\nreasonably determine that an employee otherthan theTitle IX coordinator, such as a\nsexual assault response coordinator, dean, or otherschool official, is bettersuited to\nevaluate such requests. Addressingthe needsofa student reporting sexual violence while\ndetermining an appropriate institutional response requires expertise and attention, and a\nschool should ensure that it assignsthese responsibilitiesto employees with the capability\nand trainingto fulfill them. Forexample, ifaschool has asexual assault response\ncoordinator, that person should be consulted inevaluating requests for confidentiality.\nThe school should identify in its Title IX policiesand proceduresthe employee or\nemployees responsible for making such determinations.\nIfthe school determinesthat it can respectthe student's request notto disclose his or her\nidentityto the alleged perpetrator, it should take allreasonable stepsto respond tothe\ncomplaint consistentwith the request. Although a student's requestto have his or her\nname withheld may limit the school's abilityto respond fully to an individual allegation of\nsexual violence, other means may be availableto addressthe sexual violence.There are\nsteps aschool can take to limit the effects ofthe alleged sexual violence and prevent its\nrecurrence without initiating formal action against the alleged perpetratoror revealing\nthe identityofthe student complainant. Examples include providing increased monitoring,\nsupervision, or securityat locations oractivitieswhere the misconductoccurred;\nproviding training and education materials for students and employees; changing and\npublicizingthe school's policies on sexual violence; and conducting climate surveys\nregarding sexual violence. Ininstancesaffecting manystudents, an alleged perpetrator\ncan be put on noticeofallegations ofharassing behaviorand be counseled appropriately\nwithout revealing, even indirectly, the identityofthe studentcomplainant. Aschool must\nalso take immediate action as necessaryto protectthe student while keeping the identity\nofthe studentconfidential. These actions mayinclude providing support servicestothe\nstudentand changing livingarrangements or course schedules, assignments, or tests.\nPage20- Questionsand Answerson Title IX and SexualViolence rv.lim_ v•\ntXnlDlT W\npage ^=r\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 48 of 73\nE-2. What factors should a school considerin weighing astudent's request for\nconfidentiality?\nAnswer: When weighing a student's requestfor confidentialitythatcould preclude a\nmeaningful investigation or potential discipline ofthe alleged perpetrator, a school should\nconsidera range of factors.\nThesefactors include circumstancesthat suggestthere isan increased riskofthe alleged\nperpetratorcommittingadditional actsof sexual violence orotherviolence (e.g., whether\nthere have been othersexual violence complaintsaboutthe same alleged perpetrator,\nwhetherthe alleged perpetrator hasa historyofarrests or recordsfrom a priorschool\nindicating a historyof violence, whetherthealleged perpetratorthreatened furthersexual\nviolence orotherviolence againstthe studentorothers, and whetherthe sexual violence\nwas committed by multiple perpetrators). Thesefactors also include circumstancesthat\nsuggestthere isan increased riskof future actsof sexual violence undersimilar\ncircumstances (e.g., whetherthe student's report reveals a pattern ofperpetration (e.g.,\nvia illicituse of drugsoralcohol) ata given location or bya particulargroup). Otherfactors\nthat should be considered inassessinga student's requestfor confidentiality include\nwhetherthe sexual violence was perpetrated with a weapon; the age of the student\nsubjected to the sexual violence; and whetherthe school possesses other meansto obtain\nrelevant evidence (e.g., securitycamerasor personnel, physical evidence).\nAschool should take requestsfor confidentialityseriously, while atthe sametime\nconsidering its responsibilityto provide asafe and nondiscriminatoryenvironmentfor all\nstudents, including the studentwho reported the sexual violence. Forexample, ifthe\nschool has credible information thatthe alleged perpetrator has committed one or more\nprior rapes, the balanceoffactors would compel the school to investigate the allegation\nof sexual violence, and ifappropriate, pursue disciplinaryaction in a mannerthat may\nrequire disclosure ofthestudent's identityto the alleged perpetrator. Ifthe school\ndeterminesthat it must disclose a student's identityto an alleged perpetrator, it should\ninform the student priorto making this disclosure. Inthese cases, it isalso especially\nimportantfor schools to take whateverinterim measures are necessaryto protectthe\nstudent and ensurethe safetyofotherstudents. Ifa school has a sexual assault response\ncoordinator, that person should be consulted inidentifyingsafety risksand interim\nmeasuresthat are necessaryto protectthe student. Inthe eventthe student requests\nthatthe school inform the perpetratorthatthe student asked the school notto\ninvestigate orseek discipline, the schoolshould honor this requestand informthe alleged\nperpetratorthatthe schoolmade the decision to goforward. Foradditional information\non interim measuressee questions G-1to G-3.Anyschool officialsresponsible for\nPage21- Questionsand AnswersonTitle IXand SexualViolence FXHIRIT LV\nPAGE 5>r\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 49 of 73\ndiscussing safetyand confidentiality with students should be trained on the effects of\ntrauma and the appropriate methods to communicate with students subjected to sexual\nviolence. See questionsJ-1 to J-3.\nOn the other hand, if,for example, the school has no credible information about prior\nsexual violence committed by the alleged perpetratorand the alleged sexual violence was\nnot perpetrated with a weapon or accompanied by threats to repeat the sexual violence\nagainst the complainant or others or part of a larger pattern at a given location or by a\nparticulargroup, the balance of factors would likelycompel the school to respect the\nstudent's request for confidentiality. Inthis case the school should still take all reasonable\nsteps to respond to the complaint consistent with the student's confidentiality request\nand determine whether interim measures are appropriate or necessary. Schools should be\nmindful that traumatic events such as sexual violence can result in delayed\ndecisionmaking by a student who has experienced sexual violence. Hence, a student who\ninitially requests confidentiality might later request that a full investigation be conducted.\nE-3. What are the reporting responsibilities ofschool employees who provide or supportthe\nprovision ofcounseling, advocacy, health, mental health, or sexual assault-related\nservicesto students who haveexperienced sexual violence?\nAnswer: OCRdoes not require campus mental-health counselors, pastoral counselors,\nsocial workers, psychologists, health centeremployees, or any other person with a\nprofessional license requiring confidentiality, or who issupervised by such a person, to\nreport, without the student's consent, incidents ofsexual violence to the school in a way\nthat identifies the student. Although these employees may have responsibilities that\nwould otherwise make them responsible employeesfor Title IX purposes, OCRrecognizes\nthe importance of protecting the counselor-client relationship, which often requires\nconfidentiality to ensure that students willseekthe help they need.\nProfessional counselors and pastoral counselors whose official responsibilities include\nproviding mental-health counseling to members of the school communityare not\nrequired byTitle IX to report any information regarding an incident of alleged sexual\nviolence totheTitle IX coordinatororotherappropriate school designee.26\n25Theexemptionfrom reporting obligationsforpastoral andprofessional counselors underTitle IX isconsistent\nwiththe CleryAct.Foradditional information on reporting obligations underthe CleryAct,see Officeof\nPostsecondary Education, Handbookfor CampusSafety andSecurityReporting(2011), availableat\nhttp://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/handbook.pdf.Similarto theCleryAct, for Title IX purposes, a pastoral\ncounselorisa personwho isassociated withareligiousorder ordenomination, isrecognized bythat religious\nPage 22-Questions and Answers on TitleIX and SexualViolence\nfcXHlBlT H\nPAGE <^\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 50 of 73\nOCR recognizesthat some peoplewho provide assistance to students who experience\nsexual violence are not professional or pastoral counselors. They include allindividuals\nwhoworkorvolunteer inon-campus sexual assaultcenters, victim advocacyoffices,\nwomen's centers, or health centers (\"non-professional counselors or advocates\"),\nincluding front desk staffand students. OCRwants studentsto feel free to seektheir\nassistance and therefore interpretsTitle IXto give schoolsthe latitude notto require\nthese individuals to report incidents ofsexual violence in awaythat identifiesthe student\nwithoutthe student'sconsent.27These non-professional counselors oradvocates are\nvaluable sources ofsupport for students, and OCRstronglyencourages schoolsto\ndesignate these individuals as confidential sources.\nPastoral and professional counselors and non-professional counselors or advocates should\nbe instructedto inform students oftheir right to file aTitle IX complaint with the school\nand a separate complaint with campus or local law enforcement. Inaddition to informing\nstudentsabout campus resources for counseling, medical, and academic support, these\npersonsshould also indicatethattheyare available to assist students in filing such\ncomplaints.They should also explain thatTitle IX includes protectionsagainst retaliation,\nand that school officialswill notonlytake stepsto prevent retaliation butalso take strong\nresponsive action if it occurs.This includes retaliatoryactionstaken bythe school and\nschool officials.When a school knows or reasonablyshould know of possible retaliation by\notherstudents or third parties, includingthreats, intimidation, coercion, or discrimination\n(including harassment), it musttake immediate and appropriate stepsto investigate or\notherwise determine what occurred.Title IX requiresthe school to protectthe\ncomplainantand ensure his or hersafetyas necessary.\nInorderto identify patterns or systemic problems related to sexual violence, a school\nshould collectaggregate data about sexual violence incidents from non-professional\ncounselorsor advocates intheir on-campus sexual assaultcenters, women's centers, or\norderordenomination assomeonewho providesconfidentialcounseling, and isfunctioningwithin thescopeof\nthatrecognition asapastoralcounselor.

Isa school requiredto investigate information regardingsexual violence incidents\nshared bysurvivors during publicawarenessevents, such as \"Take Backthe Night\"?\nAnswer: No. OCRwants studentsto feel free to participate in preventive education\nprogramsand access resourcesfor survivors. Therefore, publicawarenessevents such as\n'Take Backthe Night\" orotherforums at which students disclose experiences with sexual\nviolence are notconsidered notice to the school forthe purpose oftriggering an\nindividual investigation unless the survivorinitiates a complaint.The school should\ninstead respond to these disclosures by reviewingsexual assault policies, creating\ncampus-wide educational programs, and conductingclimate surveysto learn more about\nthe prevalence of sexual violence atthe school. Although Title IX does not require the\nschool to investigate particularincidents discussed at such events, the school should\nensurethat survivorsare aware of anyavailable resources, includingcounseling, health,\nand mental health services.To ensure thatthe entire school community understandstheir\nTitle IX rights related to sexual violence, theschool should also provide information at\nthese events onTitle IX and howtofile aTitle IX complaintwith the school, as well as\noptionsfor reporting an incidentof sexual violence to campus or local law enforcement.\nF. Investigations and Hearings\nOverview\nF-l. What elements should a school'sTitle IXinvestigation include?\nAnswer: The specific steps ina school'sTitle IX investigation willvary depending on the\nnature ofthe allegation, the age ofthe studentor students involved, the size and\nadministrativestructureofthe school, state orlocal legal requirements (including\nmandatory reporting requirementsfor schoolsworking with minors), and what it has\nlearned from pastexperiences.\nForthe purposesof this documenttheterm \"investigation\" refersto the processthe\nschool usesto resolve sexual violence complaints.This includesthefact-finding\ninvestigation and any hearing and decision-makingprocess the school uses to determine:\n(1)whetheror not the conductoccurred; and, (2)ifthe conductoccurred, what actions\nPage24- Questionsand AnswersonTitle IXand SexualViolence\nEXHIBIT B\nPAGE 3i\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 52 of 73\nthe school willtake to end the sexual violence, eliminatethe hostile environment, and\nprevent its recurrence, which mayinclude imposing sanctionsonthe perpetratorand\nproviding remedies forthe complainantand broaderstudent population.\nInallcases, aschool'sTitle IX investigation must be adequate, reliable, impartial, and\nprompt and includethe opportunity for both partiesto present witnesses and other\nevidence.The investigation may include a hearingto determine whetherthe conduct\noccurred, butTitle IX doesnotnecessarily require ahearing.28 Furthermore, neitherTitle\nIX northe DCLspecifies who should conductthe investigation. Itcould betheTitle IX\ncoordinator, providedthere are no conflicts ofinterest, butit does not haveto be. All\npersons involved in conductinga school'sTitle IX investigations must havetraining or\nexperience in handling complaints ofsexual violence and inthe school'sgrievance\nprocedures. Foradditional information on training, see question J-3.\nWhen investigating an incidentofalleged sexual violence for Title IX purposes, tothe\nextent possible, aschool should coordinatewith anyotherongoing school or criminal\ninvestigations ofthe incident and establish appropriate fact-finding roles for each\ninvestigator. Aschool should also considerwhether information can be shared amongthe\ninvestigators so that complainants are not unnecessarily required to give multiple\nstatements about atraumatic event. Ifthe investigation includes forensic evidence, it may\nbe helpful for a school to consultwith local or campus law enforcement or a forensic\nexpertto ensurethatthe evidence Iscorrectly interpreted byschool officials. For\nadditional information on working with campus or local law enforcement see question\nF-3.\nIfaschool uses its student disciplinary proceduresto meet its Title IX obligation to resolve\ncomplaintsofsexual violence promptly and equitably, it should recognizethat imposing\nsanctions againstthe perpetrator, without additional remedies, likely willnot be sufficient\nto eliminatethe hostile environmentand prevent recurrence as required by Title IX. Ifa\nschool typically processes complaints ofsexual violencethrough its disciplinary process\nand that process, including any investigation and hearing, meetstheTitle IX requirements\ndiscussed above and enablesthe school to endthe sexual violence, eliminatethe hostile\nenvironment, and prevent its recurrence, then the school may use that processto satisfy\nitsTitle IX obligationsand does not needto conduct aseparateTitle IX investigation.

A balanced\nand fair processthat providesthe same opportunitiesto both parties will lead to sound\nand supportable decisions.29 Specifically:\n• Throughout the investigation,the parties must have an equal opportunityto present\nrelevant witnesses and otherevidence.\n• The school must use a preponderance-of-the-evidence (i.e., more likelythan not)\nstandard inanyTitle IX proceedings, includingany fact-finding and hearings.\n• Ifthe school permits one partyto have lawyers or otheradvisors at anystage ofthe\nproceedings, it must do so equally for both parties.

What are the key differences between aschool'sTitle IXinvestigation intoallegationsof\nsexual violenceand a criminal investigation?\nAnswer: Acriminal investigation is intended to determine whetheran individual violated\ncriminal law; and, ifatthe conclusion of the investigation, the individual istried and found\nguilty, the individual may be imprisoned orsubjectto criminal penalties.The U.S.\nConstitution affords criminal defendants whoface the riskofincarceration numerous\nprotections, including, but not limited to, the right to counsel, the right to a speedytrial,\nthe rightto a jurytrial, the rightagainst self-incrimination, and the right to confrontation.\nInaddition, governmentofficials responsible for criminal investigations (including police\nand prosecutors) normally have discretion as to which complaintsfrom the publicthey\nwill investigate.\nBycontrast, a Title IX investigation willnever result in incarceration ofan individual and,\ntherefore, the same procedural protectionsand legal standards are not required. Further,\nwhile a criminal investigation isinitiated atthe discretion oflaw enforcementauthorities,\na Title IX investigation is not discretionary; a school hasa duty underTitle IXto resolve\ncomplaints promptlyand equitablyand to provide a safe and nondiscriminatory\nenvironmentfor all students, free from sexual harassmentand sexual violence. Because\nthestandardsfor pursuingand completing criminal investigationsare differentfrom those\nused forTitle IX investigations, the termination of a criminal investigation without an\narrestorconviction does not affectthe school'sTitle IXobligations.\nOfcourse, criminal investigationsconducted by local or campus law enforcement may be\nuseful for fact gathering ifthe criminal investigation occurswithin the recommended\ntimeframeforTitle IX investigations; but, even ifa criminal investigation isongoing, a\nschool must still conduct its ownTitle IX investigation.\nAschool should notifycomplainantsofthe right to filea criminal complaintand should\nnot dissuade a complainantfrom doing so eitherduringor afterthe school's internalTitle\nIX investigation.Title IX does not require a school to report alleged incidentsof sexual\nviolenceto law enforcement, buta school may have reportingobligations understate,\nlocal, orotherfederal laws.\nPage27- Questionsand AnswersonTitleIXand SexualViolence\nEXHIBIT V\\\nPAGE 3H\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 55 of 73\nF-3. How should aschool proceed when campusor local law enforcement agenciesare\nconductinga criminal investigation whilethe school isconductinga parallelTitle IX\ninvestigation?\nAnswer: Aschool should not waitfor the conclusion of a criminal investigation or criminal\nproceedingto begin its ownTitle IX investigation. Although a school may need to delay\ntemporarilythefact-finding portion of aTitle IXinvestigation whilethe police are\ngatheringevidence, it isimportantfor a school to understand that duringthis briefdelay\nin theTitle IX investigation, it musttake interim measuresto protectthe complainant in\nthe educational setting.The school should also continueto update the partieson the\nstatusofthe investigation and inform the partieswhen the school resumes its Title IX\ninvestigation. Foradditional information on interim measures see questions G-1to G-3.\nIfa school delays thefact-finding portion of aTitle IX investigation, the school must\npromptly resume and complete its fact-finding for theTitle IX investigation once it learns\nthatthe police department has completed its evidencegatheringstage ofthe criminal\ninvestigation.The school should not delayits investigation until the ultimate outcome of\nthe criminal investigation orthefilingof anycharges. OCR recommendsthat a school\nwork with its campus police, local law enforcement, and local prosecutor's office to learn\nwhenthe evidencegatheringstage of the criminal investigation iscomplete. Aschool may\nalso wantto enterinto a memorandum ofunderstanding (MOU) orotheragreementwith\nthese agencies regarding the protocolsand proceduresfor referring allegations ofsexual\nviolence, sharing information, and conductingcontemporaneous investigations.Any MOU\norotheragreement must allowthe school to meet itsTitle IXobligation to resolve\ncomplaints promptlyand equitably, and mustcomply with the FamilyEducational Rights\nand PrivacyAct (\"FERPA\") and otherapplicable privacy laws.\nThe DCLstatesthat in one instance a prosecutor'soffice informed OCRthatthe police\ndepartment's evidencegatheringstagetypicallytakesthree to ten calendardays,\nalthough the delay inthe school's investigation may be longerin certain instances. OCR\nunderstandsthatthis example may not be representative and thatthe law enforcement\nagency's process often takes more than ten days.OCR recognizes thatthe length oftime\nfor evidencegathering bycriminalinvestigators will varydepending on the specific\ncircumstancesofeach case.\nPage 28- Questionsand Answerson Title IXand Sexual Violence\nEXHIBIT &\nPAGE -2,\\\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 56 of 73\nOff-CampusConduct\nF-4. Isa school requiredto process complaintsofalleged sexual violencethat occurred off\ncampus?\nAnswer: Yes. UnderTitle IX, a school must processall complaints ofsexual violence,\nregardless ofwherethe conductoccurred, to determine whetherthe conductoccurred in\nthe contextof an education program or activity or had continuingeffectson campus orin\nan off-campuseducation program oractivity.\nAschool must determine whetherthe alleged off-campussexual violence occurred inthe\ncontextofan education program oractivity of the school; ifso, the school musttreatthe\ncomplaint in the same mannerthatittreats complaints regarding on-campus conduct. In\notherwords, ifa school determinesthatthe alleged misconducttook place inthe context\nof an education program oractivityof theschool, thefact thatthe alleged misconduct\ntook place off campus does not relievethe school ofits obligation to investigatethe\ncomplaintas it would investigate a complaintof sexual violencethatoccurred on campus.\nWhetherthe alleged misconduct occurred inthiscontext may not always be apparent\nfrom the complaint, so a school may needtogatheradditional information in orderto\nmake such a determination. Off-campus education programs and activities are clearly\ncovered and include, butare not limited to: activitiesthattake place at houses of\nfraternities orsororities recognized bytheschool; school-sponsored field trips, including\nathleticteam travel; and eventsforschool clubsthat occuroffcampus {e.g., a debate\nteamtrip to anotherschool orto a weekend competition).\nEven ifthe misconduct did notoccur inthe contextofan education program oractivity, a\nschool must considerthe effectsofthe off-campus misconduct when evaluating whether\nthere isa hostile environment on campus orinan off-campus education program or\nactivity because students often experiencethe continuing effectsof off-campus sexual\nviolence while at school orin an off-campuseducation program oractivity. The school\ncannotaddressthe continuingeffectsof the off-campussexual violence at school or in an\noff-campuseducation program or activity unless it processesthe complaintand gathers\nappropriate additional information inaccordance with its established procedures.\nOnce a school ison notice ofoff-campussexual violence againsta student, it mustassess\nwhetherthere are anycontinuing effectson campus or inan off-campuseducation\nprogram or activitythatare creatingor contributingto a hostile environmentand, ifso,\naddressthat hostile environment in the same manner in which it would address a hostile\nenvironmentcreated byon-campus misconduct.The mere presence on campus or inan\nPage 29- Questionsand Answers on Title IXand Sexual Violence\nEXHIBIT VA\nPAGE gfe>\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 57 of 73\noff-campuseducation program or activity ofthe alleged perpetratorof off-campussexual\nviolence can have continuingeffectsthat createa hostile environment. Aschool should\nalso take stepsto protecta studentwho alleges off-campussexual violence from further\nharassment by the alleged perpetratororhis or herfriends, and a school may haveto take\nstepsto protectotherstudentsfrom possible assault bythe alleged perpetrator. Inother\nwords, the school should protectthe school community inthe same way it would had the\nsexual violence occurred on campus. Even ifthere are no continuingeffectsofthe off-\ncampussexual violence experienced by the studenton campus orin an off-campus\neducation program oractivity, the school still should handlethese incidentsas it would\nhandle otheroff-campus incidentsof misconductorviolence and consistentwith any\notherapplicable laws. For example, ifa school, under its code ofconduct, exercises\njurisdiction over physical altercations between studentsthatoccuroffcampus outsideof\nan education program oractivity, it should also exercisejurisdiction over incidentsof\nstudent-on-studentsexual violencethat occuroff campusoutside ofan education\nprogram or activity.\nHearings30\nF-5. Must a school alloworrequirethe partiesto be presentduringan entire hearing?\nAnswer: Ifa school uses a hearing processto determine responsibilityfor acts ofsexual\nviolence, OCR does not require thatthe school allow a complainantto be presentforthe\nentire hearing; it isup to each school to make this determination. But ifthe school allows\none partyto be presentfor the entiretyofa hearing, it must do so equallyfor both\nparties. Atthe sametime, when requested, a school should make arrangementsso that\nthe complainantand the alleged perpetratordo not haveto be present inthe same room\natthe sametime.Thesetwo objectives may be achieved by using closed circuittelevision\norother means. Because a school has aTitle IX obligation to investigate possiblesexual\nviolence, ifa hearing ispart ofthe school'sTitle IX investigation process, the school must\nnot require a complainantto be presentat the hearing as a prerequisiteto proceed with\nthe hearing.\n30As notedinquestion F-1,theinvestigation mayincludeahearingtodeterminewhethertheconductoccurred,\nbutTitleIXdoesnot necessarilyrequireahearing.AlthoughTitleIXdoes notdictate the membership ofa hearing\nboard,OCRdiscouragesschoolsfromallowingstudentstoserveonhearingboards incasesinvolvingallegationsof\nsexualviolence.\nPage30- Questionsand AnswersonTitle IXandSexualViolence EXHIBIT v_i\nPAGE -%=h-\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 58 of 73\nF-6. May everywitnessatthe hearing, includingthe parties, becross-examined?\nAnswer: OCRdoes not require thata school allowcross-examination ofwitnesses,\nincludingthe parties, ifthey testifyatthe hearing. But ifthe school allowsone partyto\ncross-examine witnesses, it mustdo soequallyfor both parties.\nOCRstrongly discourages a schoolfrom allowingthe partiesto personallyquestion or\ncross-examineeach otherduring a hearingon alleged sexual violence. Allowing an alleged\nperpetratorto question a complainant directly may betraumatic orintimidating, and may\nperpetuatea hostile environment. Aschool maychoose, instead, to allowthe parties to\nsubmitquestionsto a trained third party (e.g., the hearing panel) to askthe questions on\ntheir behalf. OCRrecommendsthatthe third partyscreen the questions submitted by the\npartiesand onlyask those it deems appropriate and relevantto the case.\nF-7. Maythe complainant's sexual history be introduced at hearings?\nAnswer: Questioningaboutthe complainant'ssexual history with anyone otherthan the\nalleged perpetratorshould not be permitted. Further, a school should recognize thatthe\nmere fact of a currentor previous consensual dating orsexual relationship between the\ntwo parties does not itself implyconsentor preclude afinding of sexual violence. The\nschool should also ensure that hearings are conducted ina mannerthat does not inflict\nadditional trauma on the complainant.\nTimeframes\nF-8. What stages ofthe investigation are included inthe 60-daytimeframe referenced inthe\nDCLas the length for atypical investigation?\nAnswer: Asnoted inthe DCL, the 60-calendarday timeframe for investigations is based\non OCR's experience intypical cases.The 60-calendarday timeframe refers to the entire\ninvestigation process, which includes conductingthe fact-finding investigation, holding a\nhearing or engaging inanotherdecision-making processto determine whetherthe alleged\nsexual violence occurred and created a hostile environment, and determiningwhat\nactionsthe school willtaketo eliminatethe hostile environmentand prevent its\nrecurrence, includingimposing sanctionsagainst the perpetratorand providing remedies\nfor the complainantand school community, as appropriate. Althoughthis timeframe does\nnot include appeals, a school should be aware that an unduly long appeals process may\nimpactwhether the school'sresponsewaspromptand equitable as required byTitleIX.\nPage31- Questionsand AnswersonTitle IXand SexualViolence FYHIRIT ii\nPAGE 3g\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 59 of 73\nOCRdoes not require a school to complete investigationswithin 60 days; ratherOCR\nevaluates on a case-by-case basis whetherthe resolution of sexual violence complaints is\npromptand equitable. WhetherOCR considersan investigation to be promptas required\nbyTitle IXwillvary dependingon the complexityof the investigation and the severityand\nextentof the alleged conduct. OCR recognizesthatthe investigation process maytake\nlongerifthere isa parallel criminal investigation orifit occurs partiallyduringschool\nbreaks. Aschool may need to stop an investigation duringschool breaks or between\nschool years, although a school should make everyeffortto tryto conductan\ninvestigation duringthese breaks unless so doingwould sacrifice witness availability or\notherwise compromisethe process.\nBecausetimeframesfor investigationsvaryand a school may need to departfrom the\ntimeframes designated in its grievance procedures, both partiesshould be given periodic\nstatus updatesthroughoutthe process.\nG. Interim Measures\nG-1. Isa school requiredtotake anyinterim measures beforethe completion ofits\ninvestigation?\nAnswer: Title IX requires a school to take stepsto ensureequal accessto its education\nprogramsand activities and protectthe complainantas necessary, includingtaking interim\nmeasures beforethefinal outcome ofan investigation.The school should takethese steps\npromptlyonce it has notice of asexual violence allegation and should provide the\ncomplainantwith periodic updates on the statusofthe investigation. The school should\nnotifythe complainant of hisor heroptionsto avoidcontact with the alleged perpetrator\nand allow the complainantto changeacademicand extracurricularactivities or hisor her\nliving, transportation, dining,and workingsituation as appropriate.The school should also\nensurethatthe complainant isaware of hisor herTitle IX rightsand any available\nresources, such as victim advocacy, housingassistance, academicsupport, counseling,\ndisabilityservices, health and mental health services, and legalassistance, and the right to\nreport acrime to campus or locallawenforcement. Ifa school does not offerthese\nserviceson campus, itshould enter into an MOU with a localvictimservices provider if\npossible.\nEven when a school has determined that itcan respect a complainant's request for\nconfidentialityand therefore maynot beableto respond fully to an allegation ofsexual\nviolence and initiateformal action against an alleged perpetrator, the school musttake\nimmediate action to protectthe complainant whilekeepingthe identityofthe\ncomplainantconfidential.Theseactionsmayinclude: providingsupport servicesto the\nPage32- Questions and AnswersonTitleIXandSexualViolence\nPAGE 3>°f\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 60 of 73\ncomplainant; changing livingarrangementsorcourse schedules, assignments, ortests;\nand providing increased monitoring, supervision, orsecurityat locations oractivities\nwhere the misconduct occurred.\nG-2. How should a school determine whatinterim measurestotake?\nAnswer: The specific interim measures implemented and the processfor implementing\nthose measureswillvarydepending on thefacts ofeach case. Aschool should considera\nnumberoffactors in determiningwhat interim measuresto take, including, for example,\nthe specific need expressed bythe complainant; the age of the students involved; the\nseverityorpervasiveness of the allegations; anycontinuingeffects on the complainant;\nwhetherthe complainantand alleged perpetratorsharethe same residence hall, dining\nhall, class, transportation, orjob location; and whetherotherjudicial measures have been\ntaken to protectthe complainant (e.g., civilprotection orders).\nIngeneral, when taking interim measures, schoolsshould minimizethe burden on the\ncomplainant. Forexample, ifthe complainantand alleged perpetratorshare the same\nclassor residence hall, the school should not, asa matterofcourse, remove the\ncomplainantfrom the class or housing while allowing thealleged perpetratorto remain\nwithout carefullyconsideringthefacts ofthe case.\nG-3. Ifa school providesallstudentswith accessto counseling on a fee basis, does that\nsuffice for providingcounselingas an interim measure?\nAnswer: No. Interim measures are determined bya school on a case-by-case basis. Ifa\nschool determinesthat it needsto offercounselingto the complainantas part ofits Title\nIX obligation to take stepsto protectthe complainantwhile the investigation isongoing, it\nmust not require the complainantto pay for thisservice.\nPage 33- Questionsand Answerson Title IXandSexual Violence\nEXHIBIT \\A\npage m)\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 61 of 73\nH. Remediesand Notice ofOutcome31\nH-l. What remedies should a school consider in a case ofstudent-on-studentsexual\nviolence?\nAnswer: Effective remedial action may include disciplinaryaction againstthe perpetrator,\nproviding counselingforthe perpetrator, remediesforthe complainantand others, as\nwell as changesto the school'soverall servicesor policies. All services needed to remedy\nthe hostile environmentshould be offered to the complainant. These remedies are\nseparatefrom, and inaddition to, any interim measurethat may have been provided prior\nto the conclusion of the school's investigation. Inany instance in which the complainant\ndid nottake advantage ofa specificservice (e.g., counseling) when offered as an interim\nmeasure, the complainantshould still be offered, and isstill entitled to, appropriate final\nremediesthat may includeservicesthe complainantdeclined as an interim measure. A\nrefusal atthe interim stage does not mean the refused service orsetofservices should\nnot be offered asa remedy.\nIfa school uses its student disciplinary proceduresto meet its Title IXobligation to resolve\ncomplaintsof sexual violence promptlyand equitably, it should recognizethat imposing\nsanctionsagainstthe perpetrator, without more, likelywillnot be sufficientto satisfy its\nTitle IXobligation to eliminatethe hostile environment, prevent its recurrence, and, as\nappropriate, remedy its effects. Additional remediesfor the complainantand the school\ncommunity may be necessary. Ifthe school'sstudent disciplinary procedure does not\nincludea processfor determining and implementingthese remediesfor the complainant\nand school community, the school willneed to use another processfor this purpose.\nDependingon the specific nature ofthe problem, remediesfor the complainant may\ninclude, butare not limited to:\n• Providing an effective escortto ensurethatthe complainantcan move safely\nbetween classes and activities;\n31AsexplainedinquestionA-5, ifaschooldelaysrespondingtoallegationsofsexualviolenceorresponds\ninappropriately,the school'sowninactionmaysubjectthestudentto besubjected to ahostileenvironment.

Appeals\n1-1. What arethe requirements for an appeals process?\nAnswer: WhileTitle IX does not require thata school provide an appeals process, OCR\ndoes recommend thatthe school do so where procedural error orpreviously unavailable\nrelevant evidence could significantly impactthe outcome of a case orwhere a sanction is\nsubstantiallydisproportionate to the findings. Ifa school choosesto providefor an appeal\nofthefindings or remedyor both, it must do so equallyfor both parties.The specific\ndesign ofthe appeals process isupto the school, as longas the entiregrievance process,\nincludinganyappeals, provides promptand equitable resolutions ofsexual violence\ncomplaints,and the schooltakes stepsto protectthe complainant inthe educational\nsetting duringthe process.

Whattype oftrainingonTitle IXand sexual violence should a school provideto its\nemployees?\nAnswer: Aschool needsto ensure that responsible employees with the authorityto\naddresssexual violence know howto respond appropriatelyto reports of sexual violence,\nthatother responsible employees knowthattheyare obligated to reportsexual violence\nto appropriate school officials, and thatall otheremployees understand how to respond\nto reports of sexual violence. Aschool should ensurethat professional counselors,\npastoral counselors, and non-professional counselors oradvocates also understand the\nextentto which they may keep a report confidential. Aschool should providetrainingto\nallemployees likelyto witness or receive reports of sexual violence, includingteachers,\nprofessors, school law enforcement unitemployees, school administrators, school\ncounselors, general counsels, athleticcoaches, health personnel, and resident advisors.\nTrainingfor employees should include practical information about how to prevent and\nidentifysexual violence, includingsame-sexsexual violence; the behaviorsthat may lead\nto and result in sexual violence; the attitudes ofbystandersthat mayallow conductto\ncontinue; the potential for revictimization by responders and its effecton students;\nappropriate methodsfor respondingto a studentwho may have experienced sexual\nviolence, includingthe use ofnonjudgmental language; the impactof trauma on victims;\nand, as applicable, the person(s) to whom such misconduct must be reported.

Aschool should also have\nmethodsforverifyingthatthe training waseffective.\nJ-2. How should a school train responsible employeesto report incidents of possible sexual\nharassmentorsexual violence?\nAnswer: Title IX requires a school to take prompt and effective steps reasonably\ncalculated to end sexual harassment and sexual violencethat createsa hostile\nenvironment (i.e., conductthat issufficientlyserious asto limit ordeny a student's ability\nto participate in or benefitfrom the school'seducational program and activity). But a\nschool should notwaitto take stepsto protect its students until students have already\nbeen deprived ofeducational opportunities.\nOCRtherefore recommendsthat a school train responsible employeesto report to the\nTitle IXcoordinatororotherappropriate school official any incidentsofsexual harassment\norsexual violencethat mayviolate the school's code ofconduct or maycreate or\ncontribute to the creation ofa hostile environment.The school can then take stepsto\ninvestigate and preventany harassmentorviolence from recurringorescalating, as\nappropriate. Forexample, the school may separate the complainantand alleged\nperpetratororconductsexual harassment and sexual violence trainingforthe school's\nstudentsand employees. Responsible employeesshould understand thatthey do not\nneed to determine whetherthe alleged sexual harassment orsexual violence actually\noccurred orthat a hostile environment has been created before reporting an incidentto\nthe school'sTitle IX coordinator. BecausetheTitle IX coordinatorshould have in-depth\nknowledge of Title IXand Title IX complaintsatthe school, he orshe is likelyto be in a'\nbetterpositionthan are otheremployeesto evaluate whetheran incidentof sexual\nPage39- Questionsand AnswersonTitle IXandSexualViolence EXHIBIT W\nPAGE m?\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 67 of 73\nharassmentorsexual violence createsa hostile environment and howthe school should\nrespond.There mayalso besituations inwhich individual incidents ofsexual harassment\ndo not, bythemselves, create a hostile environment; howeverwhen considered together,\nthose incidents maycreate a hostile environment.\nJ-3. Whattype oftrainingshould a school provideto employees who are involved in\nimplementingthe school's grievance procedures?\nAnswer:All persons involved in implementinga school'sgrievance procedures (e.g.,Title\nIX coordinators, others who receive complaints, investigators, and adjudicators) must\nhavetraining orexperience in handling sexual violence complaints, and in the operation\nof the school'sgrievance procedures. The trainingshould include information on working\nwith and interviewing persons subjected to sexual violence; information on particular\ntypes of conductthat would constitutesexual violence, includingsame-sexsexual\nviolence;the properstandard of reviewfor sexual violence complaints (preponderance of\nthe evidence); information on consent and the role drugs oralcohol can play inthe ability\nto consent; the importance ofaccountabilityfor individualsfound to have committed\nsexual violence; the need for remedial actionsforthe perpetrator, complainant, and\nschool community; howto determine credibility; howto evaluate evidence and weigh it in\nan impartial manner; howto conduct investigations; confidentiality; the effects oftrauma,\nincluding neurobiological change; and cultural awarenesstraining regarding howsexual\nviolence may impactstudents differentlydepending on theircultural backgrounds.\nInrare circumstances, employees involved in implementinga school'sgrievance\nprocedures may be able to demonstratethat priortrainingand experience has provided\nthem with competencyinthe areas covered inthe school'straining. For example, the\ncombination of effective priortrainingand experience investigating complaintsof sexual\nviolence, together with training on the school'scurrentgrievance procedures may be\nsufficient preparation foran employeeto resolveTitle IXcomplaintsconsistent with the\nschool'sgrievance procedures. In-depth knowledge regardingTitle IX and sexual violence\nisparticularly helpful. Because laws and school policies and procedures maychange, the\nonlywayto ensure thatallemployees involved in implementingthe school'sgrievance\nprocedures havethe requisitetrainingor experience isfor the school to provide regular\ntrainingto all individuals involved in implementing the school'sTitle IXgrievance\nprocedureseven ifsuch individuals also have prior relevant experience.\nPage40- Questionsand AnswersonTitle IXand SexualViolence FXHIRIT (\nPAGE Mq^\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 68 of 73\nJ-4. Whattype oftrainingon sexual violence should a school provideto itsstudents?\nAnswer: Toensurethat students understand their rights underTitle IX, a school should\nprovide age-appropriatetrainingto its students regardingTitle IX and sexual violence. At\nthe elementaryand secondaryschool level, schoolsshould considerwhether sexual\nviolencetraining should also be offered to parents, particularlytrainingon the school's\nprocessfor handling complaints of sexual violence. Training may be provided separately\noras partofthe school's broadertrainingon sexdiscrimination and sexual harassment.\nHowever, sexual violence isa unique topic that should not beassumed to be covered\nadequately inothereducational programmingortraining provided to students.The\nschool maywantto includethistraining inits orientation programsfor newstudents;\ntrainingfor studentathletes and members of studentorganizations; and back-to-school\nnights. Aschool should considereducational methodsthat are most likely to help\nstudents retain information when designing its training, including repeatingthe trainingat\nregularintervals. OCRrecommendsthat, at a minimum, thefollowing topics (as\nappropriate) be covered inthis training:\n• Title IXand whatconstitutessexual violence, includingsame-sexsexual violence,\nundertheschool's policies;\n• the school's definition ofconsentapplicable to sexual conduct, including examples;\n• howthe school analyzeswhetherconductwas unwelcome underTitle IX;\n• howthe school analyzeswhether unwelcome sexual conductcreates a hostile\nenvironment;\n• reporting options, includingformal reporting and confidential disclosure options\nand anytimeframes set by the school for reporting;\n• the school'sgrievance procedures used to processsexual violence complaints;\n• disciplinarycode provisions relatingto sexual violence and the consequences of\nviolatingthose provisions;\n• effects oftrauma, including neurobiological changes;\n• the role alcohol and drugs often play insexual violence incidents, includingthe\ndeliberate use of alcohol and/orotherdrugsto perpetrate sexual violence;\n• strategies and skillsfor bystandersto intervene to prevent possible sexual violence;\n• how to reportsexual violenceto campusor local law enforcement and the abilityto\npursue law enforcement proceedingssimultaneouslywith a Title IXgrievance; and\n• Title IX'sprotectionsagainst retaliation.\nThetrainingshould also encourage studentsto report incidents of sexual violence. The\ntraining should explain that students (and their parentsorfriends) do not need to\ndetermine whetherincidentsofsexual violence orothersexual harassmentcreated a\nPage41- Questionsand AnswersonTitle IXandSexualViolence\nEXHIBIT W-\nPAGE v-fcgr\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 69 of 73\nhostile environment before reporting the incident. Aschool also should be aware that\npersons may be deterred from reporting incidents if,for example, violations ofschool or\ncampus rules regardingalcohol ordrugs were involved. Asa result, a school should review\nits disciplinary policy to ensure it does not have a chilling effecton students' reporting of\nsexual violence offensesor participatingas witnesses. OCRrecommendsthat a school\ninform studentsthatthe school's primaryconcern isstudentsafety, and that use of\nalcohol ordrugs never makesthe survivoratfault forsexual violence.\nItisalso importantfor a school to educate students aboutthe persons on campusto\nwhom theycan confidentially report incidentsofsexual violence. Aschool's sexual\nviolence education and prevention program should clearlyidentifythe offices or\nindividuals with whom studentscan speakconfidentiallyand the officesorindividuals\nwho can provide resources such as victim advocacy, housingassistance, academic\nsupport, counseling, disabilityservices, health and mental health services, and legal\nassistance. Itshould also identifythe school's responsible employeesand explain that if\nstudents report incidents to responsible employees (except as noted in question E-3)\nthese employeesare required to report the incidentto theTitle IX coordinatororother\nappropriate official. This reporting includesthe names ofthe alleged perpetratorand\nstudentinvolved inthe sexual violence, as well as relevantfacts includingthe date, time,\nand location, although effortsshould be made to complywith requestsfor confidentiality\nfrom the complainant. For more detailed information regarding reporting and responsible\nemployeesand confidentiality, see questions D-1to D-5and E-lto E-4.\nK. Retaliation\nK-l. DoesTitle IXprotectagainst retaliation?\nAnswer: Yes.The Federal civilrights laws, includingTitle IX, make it unlawful to retaliate\nagainstan individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by\nthese laws.This meansthat ifan individual bringsconcernsabout possiblecivilrights\nproblemsto a school's attention, including publiclyopposingsexual violence orfiling a\nsexual violence complaintwith the school or anyStateorFederal agency, it is unlawful for\nthe school to retaliate againstthat individual for doing so. Itisalso unlawful to retaliate\nagainst an individual because he orshe testified, or participated in any manner, in an OCR\norschool's investigation or proceeding. Therefore, ifa student, parent, teacher, coach, or\nother individual complainsformally orinformallyabout sexual violence or participates in\nan OCRorschool's investigation orproceedings related to sexual violence, the school is\nprohibitedfrom retaliating (including intimidating, threatening, coercing, or in anyway\nPage42- Questionsand AnswersonTitle IXandSexualViolence _%„\nEXHIBIT t^\nPAGE 44\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 70 of 73\ndiscriminating against the individual) because of the individual's complaint or\nparticipation.\nAschool should take steps to prevent retaliation against a student who filed a complaint\neitheron his or her own behalfor on behalfof another student, or against those who\nprovided information as witnesses.\nSchools should be aware that complaintsof sexual violence may be followed by retaliation\nagainst the complainant or witnesses by the alleged perpetrator or his or her associates.\nWhen a school knows or reasonably should know of possible retaliation by otherstudents\nor third parties, it must take immediate and appropriate steps to investigate or otherwise\ndetermine what occurred. Title IX requires the school to protect the complainantand\nwitnesses and ensure their safety as necessary. Ata minimum, this includes making sure\nthat the complainant and his or her parents, ifthe complainant is in elementary or\nsecondaryschool, and witnesses know how to report retaliation by school officials, other\nstudents, orthird parties by making follow-up inquiries to see ifthere have been any new\nincidents or acts of retaliation, and by responding promptlyand appropriately to address\ncontinuing or new problems. Aschool should also tell complainants and witnesses that\nTitle IX prohibits retaliation, and that school officials will not onlytake steps to prevent\nretaliation, but will also take strong responsive action ifit occurs.\nL. First Amendment\nL-1. How should a school handle its obligation to respond to sexual harassment and sexual\nviolence while still respecting free-speech rights guaranteed bythe Constitution?\nAnswer: The DCL on sexual violence did not expressly address First Amendment issues\nbecause itfocuses on unlawful physical sexual violence, which isnot speech orexpression\nprotected by the First Amendment.\nHowever, OCR's previous guidance on the First Amendment, including the 2001 Guidance,\nOCR's July 28,2003, Dear Colleague Letteronthe FirstAmendment,35 and OCR's October\n26,2010, Dear Colleague Letteronharassmentand bullying,36 remainfully in effect.OCR\nhas made it clear that the laws and regulations itenforces protect students from\nprohibited discrimination and do not restrictthe exercise ofany expressive activities or\nspeech protected under the U.S.Constitution.

OCRrecognizes that the offensiveness of a particularexpression as perceived by\nsome students, standing alone, is not a legallysufficient basis to establish a hostile\nenvironment underTitle IX. Title IX also does not require, prohibit, or abridge the use of\nparticulartextbooks orcurricular materials.37\nM. The Clery Actand the Violence AgainstWomen Reauthorization Act of 2013\nM-1. How does the Clery Act affect the Title IXobligations of institutions of higher education\nthat participate in the federal student financial aid programs?\nAnswer: Institutions of higher education that participate in the federal studentfinancial\naid programs are subject to the requirements ofthe Clery Act as well as Title IX. The Clery\nAct requires institutionsof higher education to provide current and prospective students\nand employees, the public, and the Department with crime statistics and information\nabout campus crime prevention programs and policies. The Clery Act requirements apply\nto many crimes otherthan those addressed byTitle IX. For those areas in which the Clery\nAct and Title IX both apply, the institution must comply with both laws.

L.No. 113-4, including\nSection 304ofthat Act, which amends the Clery Act?\nAnswer: No. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act has no effect on a school's\nobligations underTitle IX orthe DCL. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act\namended the Violence Against Women Act and the Clery Act, which are separate statutes.\nNothing inSection 304 or any other part of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization\nAct relieves a school of its obligation to comply with the requirements ofTitle IX, including\nthose set forth in these Questions and Answers, the 2011 DCL,and the 2001 Guidance.\nFor additional information about the Department's negotiated rulemaking related to the\nViolence Against Women Reauthorization Act please see\nhttp://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2012/vawa.html.\n3734C.F.R. § 106.42.\nPage 44 - Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence\nEXHIBIT ^\nPAGE €T\\\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-1    Filed 11/13/17    Page 72 of 73\nN.

Arethere otherlegal considerations beyondtheTitle IXregulations discussed in this\nguidance documentthatapplyto single-sexclasses?\nAnswer:Yes. Whilethisdocument onlyaddressesthe requirements ofthe Department's\nTitle IX regulations, publicschool districtsand schoolsthat are currentlyofferingorare\ninterested inofferingsingle-sexclasses must complywith the Constitution ofthe United\nStatesand otherapplicable Federal laws. The Equal Protection Clauseofthe Fourteenth\nAmendment prohibitsdiscrimination onthe basis ofsexbypublicschools.4 In addition,Title\nIVofthe Civil Rights Actof1964(Title IV) prohibits publicschool boardsfrom denying\nstudentstheequal protection ofthe laws based onsex,5 andthe Equal Educational\nOpportunitiesAct (EEOA) prohibitssomeforms of studentassignmentto schools ifthe\nassignment results in sexsegregation.6\nTheDepartment'sregulationsclarified inthisdocumentapplytoallsingle-sexclassesandextracurricular\nactivitiescoveredby34C.F.R.§106.34(b).

Doesthis document address single-sexschools?\nAnswer:This documentfocuses on the Department'sTitle IX regulations pertainingto\nsingle-sexclasses in public elementaryand secondaryschools. There are separateTitle IX\nregulations in34 C.F.R.§ 106.34(c) thatgovern public, nonvocational single-sexschools.\nGenerally, a school district mayoffera single-sex nonvocational elementaryorsecondary\nschool underTitle IX only ifit offers a substantiallyequal single-sexorcoeducational school\nto studentsofthe excluded sex.9 However, single-sex nonvocational private schoolsare not\ngoverned bythe Department'sTitle IX regulation requiring a substantiallyequal single-sex\norcoeducational school. Bycontrast, vocational schoolsthat receive Federal financial\nassistance maynever belimited toonesex.10 There arealso DepartmentTitle IX regulations\nthat applyto admissionsto single-sex nonvocational publicand privatecollegesand\nuniversities.11\nAsnoted inthe response to Question 2, publicsingle-sexschoolsare subjectto the Equal\nProtection Clauseofthe Fourteenth Amendmentand other Federal statutes as well asTitle\nIX. The Department requiresgrantapplicantsthat seekfunds orotherforms of Federal\nfinancial assistanceforthe establishmentoroperation ofa publicsingle-sexschool to\ndemonstratethe school'scompliancewithTitle IX, the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment, and all otherapplicable lawsand regulations. Failure to\ndemonstrate compliancewith these requirements may lead to a rejection ofthegrant\napplication or disqualification from receipt ofcontinuation funds orotherfinancial\nassistance.\nPage2- QuestionsandAnswersonTitle IXandSingle-SexClasses EXHIBIT JT\nPAGE *?r\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-2    Filed 11/13/17    Page 8 of 67\nCASE 0:16-cv-03015-WMW-LIB Document 15-3 Filed 09/16/16 Page 9 of 37\n4. May schools offersingle-sexclasses and extracurricularactivities underthe Department's\nTitle IXregulations?\nAnswer:Yes.

Thegeneral rule underTitle IX isthata recipient may notexclude,\nseparate, deny benefitsto, orotherwisetreat differentlyany person on the basis ofsex in\nits education programs oractivities—including classesand extracurricularactivities—unless\nexpresslyauthorized to do so underTitle IX or the Department's implementing\nregulations.12 The Department'sTitle IX regulations identifythefollowing categoriesfor\nwhich a recipient may intentionallyseparatestudentsbysex:13\n• Contactsports inphysical educationclasses;14\n• Classes orportions of classes inelementaryand secondaryschoolsthat deal\nprimarilywith human sexuality;15 and\n• Nonvocational classes and extracurricularactivities within a coeducational,\nnonvocational elementaryorsecondaryschool ifcertaincriteriaare met.16\n5. What kinds ofclasses and activities doesthis document address?\nAnswer:This documentfocuses on the lastexception noted inthe response to Question 4—\nnonvocational classesand extracurricularactivities in a coeducational, nonvocational\nelementaryorsecondaryschool receiving Federal financial assistance. These include any\nsingle-sexcurricularactivity (such as a class ora field trip) and anysingle-sexextracurricular\nactivity (such as a before-school orafter-school activity, lunch, or recess). The requirements\nregardingthisexception applyto single-sexclassesand activitieswhetherthey are provided\ndirectly byaschool district orschool orthrough anotherentity.17\nVocational classesare not discussed further inthis document because they may never be\noffered onasingle-sex basis.18 Forpurposesofthisdocument, vocational classes arethose\nclassesthat have as their primary purposethe preparation ofstudentsto pursue a\ntechnical, skilled, orsemi-skilled occupation ortrade; orto pursuestudy in a technical field,\nconsistent with the definition of\"institution ofvocational education\" in 34C.F.R.\n§106.2(o).19\nOCRdoes not address interscholastic, club, or intramural athletics in this document because\nextracurricularathleticsaregoverned byseparateTitle IX regulations.20\nPage3- QuestionsandAnswersonTitle IXandSingle-SexClasses EXHIBIT ?\nPAGE S\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-2    Filed 11/13/17    Page 9 of 67\nCASE 0:16-cv-03015-WMW-LIB Document 15-3 Filed 09/16/16 Page 10 of 37\n6. Isa classthatis opento all students butin which only membersofone sexenroll covered\nbytheTitle IXregulations described inthis document?\nAnswer: No. The regulations described inthisdocumentapplyto a class that excludes\nstudentsof one sex from enrollingorotherwise participating inthat class.\nBycontrast, a class isnotsubjectto the regulations described inthis document ifit isopen\nto members of both sexes, even ifstudentsofonly one sex, or a substantially\ndisproportionate numberofstudentsof one sex, enroll. Ifsuch disproportion exists ina\ncoeducational class, however, it may be an indication of inappropriate steeringor other\ndiscrimination incounselingor guidance. Title IX requiresthat, ifsuch disproportion exists,\ntheschool ensurethatthe disproportionate enrollment is notthe result of discrimination\non the basis ofsex, including incounseling orguidance of studentsorapplicantsfor\nadmission.21\n7. What criteria must be metto offersingle-sexclasses underthe Department'sTitle IX\nregulations?\nAnswer:The Department'sTitle IX regulations permita nonvocational elementaryor\nsecondaryschool to offera nonvocational single-sexclass ifithas a two-partjustificationfor\ndoingso that demonstratesthat:\n• each single-sexclass isbased on the recipient's \"important objective\" eitherto\no improve its students' educational achievementthrough its overall\nestablished policiesto provide diverse educational opportunities (the\ndiversityobjective), or\no to meetthe particular, identified educational needs ofits students (the\nneeds objective); and\n• thesingle-sex nature ofthe class is\"substantiallyrelated\" to achievingthat\nimportant objective.22\nInaddition to establishingajustificationfor offering a single-sexclass, inorderto comply\nwith the Department'sTitle IX regulations, the recipient must:\n• implement its objective in an evenhanded manner;\n• ensurethat studentenrollment inthe single-sexclass iscompletelyvoluntary;\n• providea substantiallyequal coeducational class in the same subject; and\nEXHIBIT X:\nPage4- Questionsand Answerson Title IXandSingle-SexClasses\nPAGE °i\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-2    Filed 11/13/17    Page 10 of 67\nCASE 0:16-cv-03015-WMW-LIB Document 15-3 Filed 09/16/16 Page 11 of 37\n• conduct periodicevaluationsto determine whetherthe classcomplieswithTitle IX,\nand ifnot, modifyordiscontinuethe classto ensure compliance withTitle IX.\nEach ofthese elements is discussed below.\nJustificationfor Offeringa Single-SexClass\n8. Doesa recipient need ajustification for each single-sexclassoractivityit offers?\nAnswer:Yes. Aspecific, individual justification (demonstratingthe recipient's objective and\nthe substantial relationship between the objective and the single-sex nature ofthe class or\nactivity) isnecessaryfor each single-sexclass or activity. Arecipient may notoffersingle-\nsexclasses in multiplegrades orsubjectswithoutseparatelyjustifyingeach class. Atthe\nelementaryschool level, where a class typically covers manysubjects, the recipient must\nseparatelyjustifythe use of single-sexclassesfor each subject. This requirement appliesto\neach single-sexcurricularactivity and each single-sex extracurricularactivityoffered bythe\nschool.\n9. When musta recipientestablish itsjustification for a single-sex class?\nAnswer:Arecipient mustestablish itsjustification priorto offeringthe single-sexclass.23\nAlthough OCR does not pre-approve class offerings oroffer legal advisoryopinions, OCRwill\nrequest documentation ofthejustification duringa complaint investigation or compliance\nreview. OCRwill reviewthejustificationto ensurethat it wasthe actual reason that\nmotivated the offering of thatsingle-sexclass, ratherthan an after-the-fact explanation\nprepared inresponse tothe complaintorinvestigation.24 Arecipient isnotrequired to\nprepare a writtenjustification, but inthe absence ofa writtenjustification, OCRwillassume\nthatthe recipient did not establish itsjustification priorto offeringthe single-sexclassand\nthatanyjustification was established afterthe initiation ofthe complaint investigation or\ncompliance review, unless the recipientcan prove otherwise. Therefore, it isstrongly\nrecommended thatthe recipient articulate itsjustification inwriting priorto offeringthe\nsingle-sexclassand preservethat documentation for at leastas long as the recipientoffers\nthe single-sexclass in question and for a reasonabletime afterthe class ends. This\ndocumentation mayalso assistthe recipient as it periodicallyevaluates its single-sex\nofferings, as discussed in more detail in response to Questions 23 through 28.\n10.

Comparator Middle School is\nroughlythe samesize as Evidentiary Middle School, and both schools serve\nstudentsatthe same grade level and ofsimilarsocioeconomic status.\nEvidentiary Middle School would liketo implement Comparator Middle School's\nscience program in hopesthat Evidentiary's seventh-grade boyswill achieve\nsimilarsuccess.\nInachieving its gains, Comparator Middle School offered a single-sexscience\nclass for seventh-grade boys. The State science exam scores of malestudents in\nthat class increased significantly.

Boys at Scientific HighSchool do enroll in AP\nChemistry and allstudents otherwisetake advantage ofthe school's widely\ndiverse classofferings. Consistent with the diversity objective, Scientific High\nSchool would liketo improve the educational achievement ofits students by\nincreasing female enrollment inAPChemistry by further expanding its class\nofferingsto include an all-girlsAPChemistry class.\nScientific HighSchool has identifiedtwo schools in nearbydistricts that have\nimplemented an all-girlsAPChemistry class. These schools are approximately\nthe same size as Scientific HighSchool, and allthree schools serve studentsat\nthe same grade level and ofsimilarsocioeconomic status. Allthree are\nneighborhood schoolswith no specificadmissions requirements, and allstudents\nreceive transportation to and from school through the applicable district.\nOverthe last three years, sincethe implementation ofthose classes, the\nenrollment rate offemale students in APChemistry has steadilyincreased at\nboth ofthetwo comparator schools. Female enrollment inthose schools'\ncoeducational APChemistry classes has stayed roughlythe same. The schools\ndid not change any otheraspectoftheirAPChemistry programs; the single-sex\nclassesare identical totheircoeducational counterparts.\nGiven these facts, OCRwould find that, through its overall policyto provide\ndiverse educational opportunities, Scientific HighSchool had shown a substantial\nrelationship between the single-sex nature ofthe girls science class and its\nimportant objectiveofimprovingthe educational achievement ofits students by\nincreasing female enrollment inAPChemistry.\nResearch Evidence: Research evidence demonstrating the effectivenessofsingle-sexclasses\nincircumstances sufficientlysimilar tothe school's circumstances mayalso satisfythe\nsubstantial relationship requirement.

To do this, it\nmust conduct athorough and impartial assessment of what single-sexclassesto offerto\neach sex, andthenofferthoseclasses evenhandedlytoitsstudents.38 Thus, underthe\ndiversityobjective, ifa recipient isableto justifysingle-sexclassesfor both sexes, offering\nsingle-sexclassesfor onlyone sexwill likelyviolatethe evenhandedness requirement,\nPage12- Questionsand AnswersonTitle IXandSingle-SexClasses EXHIBIT \"T\nPAGE l^\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-2    Filed 11/13/17    Page 18 of 67\nCASE 0:16-cv-03015-WMW-LIB Document 15-3 Filed09/16/16 Page 19 of37\nunlessthe recipientcan showthat itevenhandedlygaugedthe interest ofboth sexesand\nthe excluded sex was not interested inhavingthe option to enroll insingle-sexclasses.\nLikewise, ifone sex isoffered single-sexclasses inthe school's core subjects, whilethe other\nsexisonlyoffered single-sexclasses inthe school's non-core subjects, OCRwould not find\nthatthe recipient isoffering classes in an evenhanded manner.\no Example I: Advanced HighSchool would like to use single-sexclassesto increase\nenrollment ofboth male and female students in its AP Physics, English, or\nAmerican History classes. Advanced HighSchool has already determined that it\ncan meetthe requisite regulatory requirements ofthe Department'sTitle IX\nregulations for allofthese classes, but because ofstaffing concerns, the school\ncan onlyoffersingle-sexclasses in one subject. Advanced HighSchool conducted\na surveyto determine which subject male students would prefer;the male\nstudentschose AP Physics. Because it could onlydevote oneteacherto single-\nsexclasses, Advanced HighSchool did notsurveyits female students, but\ndecided instead to offerthe female students asingle-sexAP Physics class, as\nwell.\nThis would violatethe evenhandedness requirement. Eventhough allstudents\nare beingoffered identical single-sexclasses, taught bythe same teacher, the\nassessmentofwhich classto offer favored the male students.\nThis does not mean, however, that male and female students must always beoffered\nsingle-sexclasses inthe same subjects.

How does the evenhandednessanalysisapply if a recipient is assertingthe needs\nobjective?\nAnswer: Ifthe recipientassertsthe needsobjective, the evenhandedness analysis is\ndifferent from the analysis used underthe diversity objective. Underthe needs objective,\nthe recipient must first conduct an assessmentto identifythe educational needsofits\nstudents,andthen determine howto meet those needsonanevenhanded basis.39 Ifa\nrecipient has evidence demonstratingthat a single-sexclass in a particularsubjectwould\nmeetthe particular, identified educational needsofstudents of both sexes and thatthe\nsingle-sexnatureofthe classes issubstantially related to meetingthe needs for both sexes,\nthen ifthe recipientoffers a single-sexclass inthat subject, it must do so for both sexes. On\nthe other hand, ifthe evidence showsthatthe single-sexclass in that subject would meet\nthe particular, identified needsofonlyone sexorthatthe single-sex nature ofthe class\nwould be substantially related to meetingthe needs ofonlyone sex, a recipient maynot\nofferthe single-sexclassto students ofthe othersex. That recipientwould instead haveto\ndetermine, based on its assessment ofthe educational needsofboth sexes, whethera\nsingle-sexclass inanothersubject should be offeredtothe excluded sex, inorderto meet\ntheevenhandedness requirement.40\no Example K: Faraway HighSchool intendsto offeran all-boys APEnglishclass\nbecausethe percentageofits male students passingthe AP English exam isfar\nbelowthe district average.

To meetthe\nevenhandedness requirement, however, in light ofdata showing its female\nstudents' deficiency on the APPhysicsexam, the school must first research\nwhetheran all-girls APPhysicsclasswould be substantially related to increasing\nPage 14- Questions and AnswersonTitle IX and Single-SexClasses tArHbl I jZ\nPAGE *^\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-2    Filed 11/13/17    Page 20 of 67\nCASE 0:16-cv-03015-WMW-LIB Document 15-3 Filed 09/16/16 Page 21 of 37\nfemale students' proficiencyon that exam. Ifso, then the school must offerthe\nfemale-onlyAPPhysics class as well.\nVoluntariness\n16.Who decides whethera studentenrolls in a single-sexclass?\nAnswer:The Department'sTitle IX regulations require thatstudent \"enrollment ina single-\nsexclassorextracurricularactivity\" be\"completelyvoluntary.\"41 To meetthisrequirement,\nOCRstronglyencourages recipientsto obtainthe affirmative consentfrom the parentsto\nenroll astudentinasingle-sexclass.42 Nevertheless, OCR will defertoStatelawto\ndeterminewhethera studentorthe student's parents willhave ultimate decision-making\nauthority regarding whethera studentwill be enrolled in a single-sexclass. IfState law Is\nsilent, a recipient may use its educationaljudgment, based on the age and circumstances of\nits studentsand its normal classassignment procedures. The affirmative consent of the\ndesignated decision-maker, whetherthe parentorthe student, must be received before\nassigning a studentto a single-sexclass.\n17. May a recipientassign studentsto a single-sexclass as longas it permitsstudentsto opt\noutofthe class?\nAnswer: No. Regardlessofwhetherthe authority rests with the studentorthe parent, the\ndecision-maker must affirmativelyopt into a single-sexclass; the student may not simplybe\nassigned to asingle-sexclass bythe school andthen bepermittedto opt out.43 Ifno\naffirmativeconsent isreceived,the student must be enrolled ina coeducational class.44\nOCRrecommendsthat such affirmative consentcome in the form ofa written, signed\ndocument.45\n18. Maya recipientmake it easierto enroll in a single-sexclassthan itis to enroll in a\ncoeducational class?\nAnswer: No. Aschool cannot use a less stringentclassenrollment procedurefor itssingle-\nsexclassesthan it doesfor its coeducational classes. In orderforthe choice to be\ncompletelyvoluntary, a school may not influencethe choiceto enroll inone class overthe\nother. Inassessing whethera decision to enroll ina single-sexclass was voluntary, OCRwill\nconsider, among otherthings, whetherthe choicewas influenced by extraneousfactors.\nFor example, anyauthorization (e.g., a permission slip) or procedure (e.g., a pre-enrollment\nmeetingwith a guidance counselor)that isrequired for enrolling in a coeducational class,\nbut notforenrolling inthe single-sexcounterpartwould renderinvoluntarythe choiceto\nenroll inthe single-sexclass.\nPage15- Questionsand AnswersonTitle IXandSingle-SexClasses EXHIBIT TZ\nPAGE <^0\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-2    Filed 11/13/17    Page 21 of 67\nCASE 0:16-cv-03015-WMW-LIB Document 15-3 Filed 09/16/16 Page 22of37\n19. How doesthe breadth ofclass offeringsaffectvoluntariness?\nAnswer: Forthe single-sexclassto bevoluntary,a recipient must offer a substantially equal\ncoeducational class in thesame subject.46 (Factorsfor determiningsubstantial equalityare\ndiscussed inthe response to Question 22.) Ifastudent isforced to choose between taking a\nsingle-sexclass ina particularsubjectand not taking a class inthatsubject, the choiceto\ntake the single-sexclass isnotvoluntary. Likewise, ifthe only honors class inagiven subject\nisa single-sexclass, a student'sselection of thatsingle-sexclass willnot be considered\nvoluntary. And ifa student musttake a single-sexclass inorderto avoid a coeducational\noption that issetat a remedial level, the single-sexclasswill also not be considered\nvoluntary. (Classes with such differences mayalso violatethe requirement of offering a\nsubstantiallyequal coeducational class, discussed in the responses to Questions 21and 22.)\n20. What additional stepsshould a recipienttaketo ensurethat participation in a single-sex\nclass iscompletelyvoluntary?\nAnswer: Becausean uninformed decision may, in manycircumstances, not be completely\nvoluntary, OCR recommendsthat recipients provide pre-enrollment information abouteach\nclassto studentsand parents insufficienttime and ina mannerthat isaccessibleto those\nwith disabilitiesand with limited English proficiencyso thatthe decision-makercan make an\ninformed choice.47\nThispre-enrollment information should explainthatthe decision-makerhas the option of\nchoosing between thecoeducational and single-sexclass;48describe thesimilaritiesand\ndifferences between the coeducational and single-sexclasses; and provide a summaryof\nthe recipient'sjustificationfor offeringthe single-sex option. OCR recommendsthat pre-\nenrollmentdisclosures specify that parentsand students have the option of reviewing the\nrecipient'sfulljustification (and any periodicevaluations, described inthe responses to\nQuestions 23through 28) upon request. Inprovidingthis pre-enrollmentinformation,\nrecipients must ensurethatthe information isconveyed ina waythat does not pressure\nparentsto enroll students inasingle-sexclass.\no ExampleL: Steering ElementarySchoolisplanning to implementsingle-sex fifth-\ngrade reading and math classesfor both boysand girls.

Must a recipientofferasubstantiallyequal coeducational option for every single-sexclass\noffered?\nAnswer: Yes. Arecipientthatoffers asingle-sexclass must provide allotherstudents,\nincludingstudentsofthe excluded sex,withasubstantiallyequal coeducational class inthe\nsame subject.49 At leastonesubstantiallyequal coeducational section mustbeoffered in\neach subject for whichthere isasingle-sexclass,and more than one section maybe needed\nbecause everystudent who requestsa coeducational option must be enrolled inone.

(Additionally, the school mayalso be\nrequired to provide a substantially equal single-sexclassfor itseighth-gradegirls,\nconsistent with the evenhandedness requirement discussed inthe responses to\nQuestions 13through 15.)50\nAschool isnot obligated to provide a single-sex class to any individual student, even ifthat\nstudentopted intothe single-sexclass. Theschool must considerthe numberofstudents\ninterested inthe option and the school's needto providea substantiallyequal\ncoeducational classfor allotherstudents, includingstudents ofthe excluded sex. Thus, in\nthe exampleabove, ifalloftheeighth-grade boys opted into the single-sexAlgebra class,\nresulting inthe substantiallyequal coeducational class enrolling onlygirls, the school could\nnot honorallof the requestsforthe single-sex boys class, because doing so would denythe\ngirls a substantiallyequal coeducational class.\n22.What factors will OCRconsider in determiningwhethera coeducational class is\nsubstantiallyequaltothe single-sexclass?\nAnswer: OCRwill considerall relevantfactors, both individuallyand in the aggregate, in\ndeterminingwhetheracoeducational class issubstantiallyequal tothesingle-sexclass.51\nAlthough the single-sex and coeducational classes do not need to be identical with respect\nto eachfactor, they need to be substantiallyequal. This meansthat ifone class is\nsignificantly superiorwith respect to onefactor, or slightlysuperiorwith respectto many\nfactors, theclasses arelikely notsubstantiallyequal.52 The Department'sTitle IX regulations\ninclude a non-exhaustive list offactors, each ofwhich isaddressed individually below, that\nOCRwillconsiderwhile conductinga complaintinvestigation orcompliance review.

On these facts, OCR\nwould not considerthe reputation ofthe faculty (an intangible feature) ofthe\ntwo classes to be substantiallyequal.\nPeriodicEvaluations\n23. How often musta recipient conductan evaluation ofits single-sex programs?\nAnswer:The recipient must evaluate each ofits single-sexclasses, and the original\njustification behind each single-sexclass, atleast everytwoyears.55 Arecipient maydecide\nto conduct evaluations more frequently (because its own findings have identified concerns\nor for other reasons). IfOCRinvestigatesa recipient and identifies compliance problems,\nOCR may requiretherecipienttoconduct more frequent evaluations.56\n24.What isthe purposeofthese evaluations?\nAnswer:The recipient must usethese periodic evaluationsto ensure that each single-sex\nclass it offers isbased upon genuine justifications, does not rely on overlybroad\ngeneralizations about eithersex, and continuesto be substantially related to the\nachievement ofthe importantobjective (seethe responsesto Questions7through 12).57\nThe periodicevaluationsshould alsoconfirm that substantiallyequal single-sexclasses are\noffered ifnecessaryto complywith the evenhandedness requirement (see the responsesto\nQuestions 13through 15), and that asubstantiallyequal coeducational alternativeto each\nsingle-sexclassisavailable (see the responsesto Questions 21 and 22). The periodic\nevaluations mustassess evidence and data related tothe recipient's single-sexclasses,\nrather than relyingon the comparatorschool or research evidence used at the justification\nstage (see the response to Question 27).\nPage 20- Questionsand AnswersonTitle IXand Single-SexClasses EXHIBIT HT\nPAGE ^5\"\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-2    Filed 11/13/17    Page 26 of 67\nCASE 0:16-cv-03015-WMW-LIB Document 15-3 Filed09/16/16 Page 27 of 37\n25. Mustthe periodicevaluation addressthe wayasingle-sexclass istaught?\nAnswer: Yes. Because ofthe riskthat single-sex classes may lead to the adoption of\nclassroom methods orstrategiesthat revert to sex stereotypes, the Department'sTitle IX\nregulations require thatthe recipient ensurethateach single-sexclass isoperated ina\nmannerthat does not \"relyon overly broad generalizationsaboutthe differenttalents,\ncapacities, orpreferences ofeithersex.\"58 Thus, classroom methods orstrategiesshould be\nchosen on the basisoftheireffectiveness inteachingthe individual students inthe class,\nwithout regard to the sexofthose students. Ofcourse, it may be difficultto ascertain why\ncertain methods orstrategieswere chosen, so the following information isintended to help\nschools understand howOCRwillconductits analysis during a complaint investigation or\ncompliance review.\nIfidentical classroom methods and strategies—including choices about classroom activities\nand environment—are used in single-sexclassesfor boys and in single-sexclassesforgirls\n(orin a single-sexclassand a coeducational class), the evaluation ofthe waythe classesare\ntaught iscomplete. This is because the use of the same methodsand strategiesfor classes\nfor boys and classesforgirls offers no reason to believethe decision to use those methods\nand strategies was based on overly broad generalizationsabout eithersex.\nBut ifdifferent classroom methods orstrategiesare used insingle-sexclassesfor boysthan\nare used insingle-sexclassesforgirls (or ina single-sexclass incomparison with its\ncoeducational counterpart), then the recipient must evaluate whetherthe decision to adopt\nthese different methodsorstrategieswas made in reliance on overly broad generalizations.\nInsomecases, the different methods orstrategies used insingle-sexclasses maysimply be\nthe resultofthe professional choicesof an individual teacherwithout regard to the sex of\nhisorherstudents. Ifthe recipientcan showthatthe teacherwould have selected identical\nmethods and strategieseven ifhe or she wereteaching a single-sexclass ofthe opposite\nsexora coeducational class, OCRwill likelyconcludethatthe school did not use overly\nbroad generalizationsabout eithersex. Indeterminingwhetherthe recipient has madethis\nshowing, OCRwillconsidersuch factors asthe methods and strategies historically used by\ntheteacher, and the timing of any changes inthe teacher's methods and strategies.\nIf, however, the methods or strategieswere selected because of the sex of the studentsin\nthe class, the riskof sex stereotypes isat itsgreatest because methods and strategiesthat\nare based on sex ignore the differences among studentsofthe samesex. When a teaching\nmethod or strategy is,infact, selected on the basis ofthe sex ofthe students, its use must\nbe directlysupported byevidence demonstratingthat the particular method or strategyis\nmore effectivefor one sexthan the otheror ismore effective when used in a single-sex\nsetting. (Theresponse to Question 12addressesthe appropriate wayto assess whether\nPage21- Questionsand AnswersonTitle IXand Single-SexClasses EXHIBIT X\nPAGE ah\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-2    Filed 11/13/17    Page 27 of 67\nCASE0:16-cv-03015-WMW-LIB Document15-3 Filed 09/16/16 Page 28 of37\nstrategies that are purported to be more effective for onesex may be used inasingle-sex\nsetting.) Itwould not be enough to showthat there isevidence about differences between\nboysand girlsthat does not directly involvethat particular teaching method orstrategy.\nFor example, while there is,of course, evidencethat biological differences between males\nand females exist, evidence of general biological differences isnot sufficient to allow\nteachers to selectdifferentteachingmethodsorstrategiesforboysand girls.60\no Example T: Quiet ElementarySchool created single-sexfourth-grade classesfor\nboth boys and girls. During the school year, the teachers of the single-sexclasses\nbecame aware ofstudies that showthatgirls are born with a significantly more\nsensitive senseof hearingthan boys, and thatthe differences grow larger asthe\nchildren grow older. Relying on those studies, the school decided thatthe boys\nclass would incorporatespeaking in a loud tone, while the girls class would not.\nAperiodicevaluation ofthe boys class would indicate reliance on overly broad\ngeneralizations about the sexes with respectto teaching methods. Use ofthe\nspecific teaching method (loud talking) would not complywith Title IX because\ntheteachers did not rely on evidence that directly linked that particularteaching\nmethod orstrategy to improved educational achievement for boys. Instead,\nthey relied on a purported biological difference (that there are, on average,\nbiological differences in the hearing sensitivityof the sexes) to conclude thatthe\nparticularteaching method orstrategy was appropriate. This general difference\nbetween the sexes, even iftrue, does not by itselfprovide evidence that loud\ntalkingwill be more effective inteachingfor one sexthan the otheror more\neffective in a single-sex setting. The leap from the biological differences to the\nuse of a particularteaching method orstrategyfor students ofone sex, without\nthe support of evidence regarding the educational effectiveness ofthe method\norstrategyfor one sex overthe other, resulted in an overly broad generalization\n(that loud talking would improve boys' abilityto learn). Because of the overly\nbroad generalization, the school would have to discontinue its use of this\nteaching method for the all-boys class.\nThe teaching method itself ispermissible. Arecipient isstill free to incorporate\nloud talking in a coeducational class or insingle-sexclassesfor both boys and\ngirls. But a recipient may not limitthat method of instruction only to the single-\nsex classfor boys on the basis of the overly broad generalization described\nabove.\nPage 22- Questionsand Answers onTitle IX and Single-SexClasses EXHIBIT X-\nPAGE ^\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-2    Filed 11/13/17    Page 28 of 67\nCASE0:16-cv-03015-WMW-LIB Document15-3 Filed09/16/16 Page 29 of37\n26. How shouldthe evaluations be made available tothe public?\nAnswer: OCR recommends wide distribution ofthe evaluations, through the recipient's\nwebsite and otherwise. Like the initialjustification, these evaluations could be useful to\nparents who are deciding whetherto enroll theirchildren insingle-sexclasses and would\nhelp ensurethe choice iscompletelyvoluntary.\n27. How will OCRdetermine whethera periodicevaluation demonstratesthata single-sex\nclass isstill substantially relatedtothe recipient's importantobjective?\nAnswer: OCR willconsiderall relevant sourcesof evidence in determiningwhetherthe\nsingle-sex nature ofthe class remainssubstantially related to the recipient's important\nobjective. Whetherevidence is relevant willdepend on the specificfacts and circumstances\nofeach case, because each single-sexclassseeksto achieve a different objective and may\nbe offered ina differentway. The evidence presented ina recipient's periodicevaluation\nmust be related to the recipient'ssingle-sexclasses, ratherthan the evidence relied upon in\nthejustification stage. Possible sourcesof evidence include, but are not limited to:\nstudents' grades; students' scoreson standardized statewide ordistrictwide exams;\ndiscipline rates; attendance data; enrollmentdata; and educators' observation and\nevaluation ofthe effectivenessofeach class.\nBecausethe biennial evaluations mustshowthatthesingle-sex nature of the class results in\nachievementof, or progresstoward, the recipient's importantobjective, a comparison\nbetween the students inthesingle-sexclass and the substantiallyequal coeducational class\nis appropriate.61 To bestassesstheeffectivenessofeach class, OCR recommendsthat\nschools monitorthe progress ofthe individual students ineach classfrom yearto year. This\nwillhelp ensurethat any comparison between a single-sex class and a substantiallyequal\ncoeducational class controlsfor variationsamongstudents. Positive or negative changes\nrelated to the recipient's objectivefor allstudentsinthe single-sex class should be averaged\ntogether; the same should be done forstudents inthe coeducational class. Theschool can\nthen comparethese averagesto see howstudents inthe single-sexclassfared in\ncomparison to their peers inthe substantiallyequal coeducational class. The same\nprocedure should be used to assess thesingle-sexclassthe followingyear. If, based on\nthese averages, a coeducational classoutperformsa substantiallyequal single-sex class, itis\nlikelythat OCR wouldfindthatthe single-sexclassisnotsubstantiallyrelated to the\nrecipient'sobjective. Ofcourse, the evidence will vary based on the school'sobjective. For\nexample, ifthe school implemented a single-sexclassinan attemptto lower discipline\nrates, discipline statisticsshould be analyzed.\nEXHIBIT\nPage23- Questionsand AnswersonTitleIXandSingle-SexClasses\nPAGE S^\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-2    Filed 11/13/17    Page 29 of 67\nCASE 0:16-cv-03015-WMW-LIB Document15-3 Filed 09/16/16 Page 30 of37\no Example U: Amiddle school offers three substantiallyequal sectionsoftenth-\ngradeAmerican Literature: an all-girlsclass, an all-boys class, and a\ncoeducational class. Theschool'sobjective isto increase proficiency on the State\nEnglishexam. Atthe end ofthefirst school year, to gatherinformationfor the\nperiodicevaluation required at the end ofthe second school year, each student's\nscore on the state Englishexam iscompared to hisorherscore on the previous\nyear's exam. The school averagesthe change inscores of students inthe all-girls\nclass, the all-boys class, and the coeducational class, respectively. The\nproficiency rate of students inthe coeducational class increased slightly. By\ncontrast, the proficiency ratesof the studentsinthe all-boys and all-girls classes\nboth increased significantly. The difference in average increases between the\nsingle-sexclasses and the coeducational class isstatisticallysignificant. The\naverages aresimilarthe following year. Underthese circumstances, the\nevidence inthis periodicevaluation would sufficeto show a continuing\nsubstantial relationship between thesingle-sex nature ofthe classesand the\nobjectiveto increase student's proficiencyon the State English exam. Note,\nhowever, thatthe school mustcontinueto conduct biennial evaluationsto show\nthat a substantial relationship between the single-sex nature of the classesand\ntheschool'sobjective persists.\nEveryrecipient'sabilityto continueeach single-sexclasswill depend on the recipient's\ncircumstances, the particularobjectivearticulated inthe recipient'sjustification, and\nwhetherthe comparative class data overtime demonstrate a substantial relationship\nbetween thatobjective and the single-sexnature ofthe class. Arecipient's evaluation\nshould analyzeand explain allfactors that influenced the achievement of,or failure to\nachieve, the recipient's objective.\n28.What isthe role ofthe recipient'sTitle IXcoordinatorinconductingthese evaluations?\nAnswer: Everyrecipient must designate an employee to coordinate itseffortsto comply\nwithTitle IX.62 TheTitle IX coordinatorisresponsibleforoverseeingthe school'sresponse\nto TitleIX reportsand complaintsand identifyingand addressing any patterns or systemic\nproblemsrevealedbysuchreports andcomplaints.

Inrecent years, we have received an increasing number of questions from\nparents, teachers, principals, and school superintendentsabout civilrights protectionsfor transgender\nstudents. Title IX ofthe Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) and its implementing regulations\nprohibitsex discrimination in educational programs and activities operated by recipients ofFederal\nfinancial assistance.1This prohibition encompassesdiscrimination basedonastudent's gender identity,\nincluding discrimination based on a student's transgenderstatus. This lettersummarizesa school's Title\nIX obligations regarding transgenderstudentsand explains how the U.S. Department of Education (ED)\nand the U.S.Department of Justice (DOJ)evaluate a school's compliance with these obligations.\nED andDOJ (theDepartments)havedeterminedthat thisletter issignificantguidance.2This guidance\ndoes not add requirements to applicable law, but provides information and examples to inform\nrecipients about how the Departments evaluatewhethercovered entities are complying with their legal\nobligations.

Schoolsare encouraged to\nconsultthat documentforpractical waysto meetTitle IX's requirements.3\nTerminology\nD Genderidentity refersto an individual's internalsense of gender.

The District iscomposed offive high schools. The complaint\nalleged that the Districtdiscriminated against StudentA, a transgender high school student, on\nthe basis ofsex. Specifically, the complaintalleged that the Districtdenied StudentA access to\nthe girls' locker rooms because ofher gender identity and gendernonconformity.\nOCR is responsible for enforcing Title IXofthe Education Amendments of1972 (Title IX), 20\nU.S.C. §§ 1681-1688, and its implementing regulation at 34 C.F.R. Part 106. Title IX prohibits\ndiscrimination on the basis ofsex inany education program or activityoperated by recipients of\nFederal financial assistance. As a recipientofFederal financial assistance from the Department,\nthe District is subjectto Title IX. Therefore, OCRhasjurisdictionoverthis complaint.\nDuring its investigation, OCR interviewed StudentA and her mother, toured her high school\n(School), interviewed Districtadministrators and staffmembers, and reviewed documents\nprovided on behalfofStudent A and bythe District. For the reasons set out below, OCRfinds by\napreponderance ofthe evidence that the District is inviolation ofTitle LX for excluding Student\nA from participation in and denying her the benefits ofitseducation program, providing services\nto her ina different manner, subjecting her to differentrules ofbehavior, and subjecting her to\ndifferenttreatmenton the basis ofsex.\nTheDepartmentofEducation'smissionistopromotestudentachievementandpreparationforglobalcompetitiveness\nbyfosteringeducational excellence andensuring equalaccess.\nwww.ed.gov FXHIRIT\nPAGE\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-3    Filed 11/13/17    Page 11 of 53\nCASE 0:16-cv-03015-WMW-LIB Document 15-5 Filed 09/16/16 Page 3 of 15\nPage 2 - OCR Case No. 05-14-1055\nDistrict Policies\nThe Districtmaintains anannual noticeof nondiscrimination that prohibits discrimination,\nincluding discrimination onthe basis ofgender, and posts the notice prominentlyonits website.1\nThe District also maintains a Board Policy that prohibits discrimination, including discrimination\non the basis ofgender and sexual orientation.\" The name and contact information for the\nDistrict's Title IX Coordinatorare available on the District's website/ as are the District's Title\nIX grievance procedures.4\nStatement ofFacts\nStudent A was born male and from a young age has identified as female. During her middle\nschool years. Student A transitioned to living full-time as a young woman. Since then, she has\npresented a female appearance, completed a legal name change, obtained a passport reflecting a\ngender change, received a diagnosis ofand treatment for gender dysphoria, and taken an ongoing\ncourse ofhormone therapy.\nStudent A's parents contacted the School during her eighth-grade year to begin planning her\ntransition to high school. The family and the School communicated extensively about issues such\nas Student A's name change, registration as a female, access to girls' restrooms and locker\nrooms, and eligibility for girls' athletics. The family also informed the School that Student A had\nbeen subjected to harassing comments in middle school when she used the boys' locker rooms.\nThe District has honored Student A's request to be treated as female in all respects except her\nrequest to be provided access to the girls' locker rooms at the School. The District identifies\nStudent A by her female name and uses female pronouns. Its computer system designates Student\nA as female. The District has given Student A unlimited access to all girls' restrooms inthe\nSchool, and, after obtaining permission from the Illinois High School Association, allows her to\nparticipate ingirls' athletics. Student A informed OCR that many students are aware ofher\ntransgender status, and that several students and staffmembers at the School have been\nparticularly supportive and encouraging towards her.\nLocker RoomAccess\nStudent A, her family, and/or their counsel have held a series ofmeetings with District and\nSchool administrators, including the Principal and the former Superintendent, to discuss the issue\nof lockerroomaccessforStudentA.3 StudentArequested anopportunitytochangeclothes\nprivatelywithinthegirls' lockerrooms, inan areasuchas a restroom stall.

The Superintendent\ntold OCRthat Student A explained that she wanted equalaccess to the girls' locker rooms\nbecause\"she wanted to be agirllike every othergirl.\"The Principal's notes from the meeting\nindicate that Student A said she was \"crushed\" by the District's decision, which she said\nindicated that the School did not accept her as female.\nStudent A told OCRduringaninterview in February 2014thatshehasherown sense ofprivacy,\nand,ifgrantedaccessto the girls' locker rooms, would seek out anunobserved areaforchanging,\nsuch asarestroom stall, which she said isacommon practice among some girls. In September\nandOctober2015, Student A informed OCR thatshewould use privacy curtains inthe girls'\nlockerrooms ifthe School made them available.\nThe District's decision denied Student A'saccess to the three girls' locker rooms: the regular PE\nlocker room (PE locker room); the locker room nearthe pool, used forthe swimming unit ofPE\n(swimming locker room); and alocker room used forthe girls' athleticsteams (athletics locker\nroom). Each is discussed in detail below.\nPE Class\nStudents atthe School arerequired to take mandatory PEeach year. It is adaily course that is\nrequired forgraduation. The District requires completion ofacertain numberofcredits in\ntraditional PE,with units on tennis, volleyball, basketball, swimming, and othersports.\nThereafter, students may satisfythe PErequirementwith various electives. PE students wear a\nrequireduniform, issued by the School, ofshortsandat-shirt. If astudent forgets his orher\nuniform on agiven day, he orshe may obtain arentaluniform, which is available inthe boys'\nandgirls' locker rooms. Inaddition, rentaluniforms areavailable inthe PEteacher's office.\nThe requiredPEclassconsists of35 minutes ofinstruction.

The girls' PE\nlockerroom contains lockers on the peripherywalls aswell as several banks oflockers in center\naislesapproximately seven feet high.There isasizableopen shower area. The girls' restroom\nfacilities for PE arelocated in Restroom A, which contains two doors: one to the entrywayand\nstairwellmentioned above, andone to the lockerroom.

She stated that students do\nnot shower afterPEclass,with the exception ofthe swimming unit, which isdiscussed below.\nThe Districtoffered Student A changing facilitiesinaprivaterestroom (Restroom C) down a\nhallway from the gymnasium. Restroom C isapproximately75 feet from the gymnasium\nentrance. Between the gymnasium andthe restroom arethe wrestling room on one side, and the\nweight room and fitness room on the other side. DuringanOCRvisit, manymale studentswere\ninthe hallwayandinthe weight room. Student A must travelthrough this hallway inorderto get\nfrom Restroom C to the gymnasium.\nRestroom C isasingleoccupancy facilitythatiskept locked duringthe school day.The Principal\nexplainedthat Student A does not have akeyto the restroom andthat astaffmemberwho\nmonitors the hallways carriesthe key and must unlockthe door forher.The Principal saidthe\nstaffmemberopens Restroom C several minutes before Student A requires access, leaves it\nunlocked during Student A's PEclass, andthen locks it several minutes after Student A leaves it\nfollowing PEclass.The restroom containsasingle stallandtoilet, amirrorand sink, andatall\nlockerthatthe School installed for Student A.\nStudent A expressed dissatisfaction with Restroom C, andthe Districtofferedan alternative\nlocation to her forchanging before andafter PE.Itoffered to let her change in Restroom A—the\nrestroom that isadjacent to the girls' PElocker room but separated from it by adoor. This would\nhave allowed herto change nearto the gym, like other girls. The Districtofferedto install—and\nin fact did install—a bankoflockers there, and to let Student A choose several female friends\nwho would be comfortable changing alongside her.However, Student A told OCRthat she felt\nthis arrangementwould\"ostracize\" hereven more than Restroom C. She said itwould draw\nattentionto the factthat she mustchangeseparately: othergirlsusing the restroom would seethe\nlockers andknowthat she changed there, whereas some girlsdid not presently know that she had\naseparate changing arrangement.Student A alsonoted that she spoke with several friends from\nPE class, who expressed reluctance to move to lockers in Restroom A. The Districttold OCR\nthattheir lockers could easily be reassigned, but Student A suggested to OCRthat her friends did\nnot seem to want to move.6\nStudent A therefore continued to change forPEclass in Restroom C. She told OCRthat she does\nnot take the most direct route from Restroom C to the gymnasium \"because it's embarrassing.\nEveryone would see me.\" Instead ofentering the gymnasium nearthe door to the girls' locker\n6Onanas-needed basisthroughoutherhighschoolcareer,StudentAalso usedarestroom insidethenurse'soffice.\nNurseAprovidedthis accessto StudentA, and alsoofferedher supportand encouragement.\nEXHIBIT S^_\nPAGE <-f\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-3    Filed 11/13/17    Page 14 of 53\nCASE 0:16-cv-03015-WMW-LIB Document 15-5 Filed09/16/16 Page 6 of 15\nPage5- OCRCase No. 05-14-1055\nroom—where female studentswouldseeherentering separately—StudentA walksthrough\nseveralhallwaysandaroundtothe othersideofthe gymnasium, where she enters.OCRobserved\nduring anonsitevisitthatthegymnasium waslarge andcrowded with students; ifthegymnasium\nwassimilarlycrowdedwhen StudentA entered onthe far side,herentrance might gounnoticed.\nThe PETeachertoldOCR thatshedidnotthink studentspayattentionto who entersand from\nwhere.StudentA saidthatshetakes acircuitousrouteto avoidstandingout.\nThe PETeachertold OCRthat Student A was frequently lateto classduring one ofthe school\nyearsin question. Student A gave various reasons forthis. She contends that, on several\noccasions, Restroom C was locked andno one was availableto open it for her;that she had\ntroubleopeningthe lockerthe School installed forherinRestroom C;thatshemust take alonger\nrouteto class to go unnoticed; and that, on atleastone occasion, she had to obtain auniform\nrental.The Districttold OCRthat itwas unableto verify Student A's problems accessing her\nlocker,andthat inanyevent, itreplacedthe lock onthe locker andresolved that problem. Italso\ndisputed that astaffmemberwas unavailableto unlock Restroom C, except on one occasion. The\nDistrict does not dispute that Student A takes acircuitous routeto gym class, orthat she has had\nto obtain rentaluniforms and cannotdo so inthe PEgirls' locker room like other students.\nAs noted, students requiring arentaluniform may request one in the locker room, or from the PE\nTeacher inheroffice.The PETeacher told OCR thatmost students who requirearentalobtain\none in the lockerroom itself. The District concedesthat, on one occasion, Student A needed a\nrentalbutcould not find the PETeacher to obtain one. Student A eventually found another\nteacherto provide arental uniform. Student A told OCRthat she was once reprimanded for\nentering the girls' PE locker room to obtain arentaluniform even though itwas the middle ofthe\nperiod andthe locker room was empty.\nThe District disputes that Student A hasbeen lateto PEclass because she was unable to find an\nadultto unlock Restroom C. After Student A made this claim on several occasions, the District\nreviewedthe previous two weeks ofvideo records from ahallwaycamera that shows the door to\nRestroom C. The District said the video showed Student A arriving late to Restroom C on several\noccasions, and onlyonce showed herunable to enterthe restroom because itwas locked. On that\noccasion, asubstitute hall monitorreached the restroom shortly after Student A and unlocked it\nforher.The District contends that Student A'stardiness was abroader problem that was not\nlimitedto PEclass, and said itaddressed this with herby adjusting her class schedule. OCR's\ninvestigationconfirmedthatthe classtardiness issuewasaddressedby alteringStudent A's\nclassroom schedule, and that hertardiness has since decreased.\nStudent A also told OCRthat one day, the PETeacher told herclassmates in the locker room\nthey did not needto dress forclassthatday,butthat since she hadto change elsewhere, she did\nnotreceive the message. Student A told OCR that shewas embarrassedwhen she showed up\ndressed in her gym uniform, while the other students were wearing street clothes. Student A\nreturnedto Restroom C and changed back into her streetclothes.\nEXHIBIT t_\nPAGE £~\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-3    Filed 11/13/17    Page 15 of 53\nCASE0:16-cv-03015-WMW-LIB Document 15-5 Filed09/16/16 Page 7 of15\nPage6- OCRCase No. 05-14-1055\nPE Class - Swim Unit\nThe swim unit isrequiredforthe School's mandatoryPEclass.

She saidshehasnot seen students shower fully naked, but\nthat some do pull the top halfoftheir bathing suits down, and arenude to the waist. The PE\nTeacher saidthat students changing afterPEclassduringthe swim unit cannot practicably\nchange inthe bathroom stalls, because there isso littletime. Students have devised various\nmethods ofchanging out oftheir swimsuits modestly. Some students use a\"buddy system,\" by\nhaving a friend hold up atowel to shield them whilethey change. Other students hold atowel in\ntheir mouths, which drapesover their fronts.\"They're naked, but to varyingdegrees,\" saidthe PE\nTeacher.\nStudent A took PEcourses that contained swimmingunits during two school years.

Nurse A stated that she made positive andencouraging statementsto Student A\nin response to her inquiries.\nStudent A said that, as aresult ofbeing denied access to the lockerroom, she has felt excluded\nfrom theteam. She described to OCRtwo incidents in which herteammates excluded her from\nteam activities. One ofthese activities was social in nature and occurred outside ofschool hours;\nthe otherresulted indisparagingtreatment by members ofherathleticteam that appearedon\nsocial media. Student A's mother informed OCRthat Student A was very upset about the\nexclusion involved inthe second incident, andopined that the District's continued denial of\naccess to the locker rooms for Student A from the locker room encouraged this type ofbehavior\nfrom students. The District responded to one ofthe incidents by speaking in general terms to the\notherathletes aboutthe importance ofinclusivity.9\nDuringOCR's investigation, after Student A requestedaprivateareato change inthe girls'\nlocker rooms, the District considered installing privacy curtains in unused space in its locker\nrooms foruse by any student, including Student A.

The District did not provide any additional information at that time.\nOCR observed that, inthe girls' PE locker room, the District installed four privacy curtains in\nunused areas ofthe locker room, and one privacy curtain around a shower. The privacy stalls\nwere inacentral area ofthe locker room, and any student accessing them would necessarily have\nto travel into the locker room itself. OCRalso observed two additional shower stalls, over which\nthe District stated itcould hang privacy curtains to create additional private changing stations.\nThe District has not installed privacy curtains in itsgirls' athletics or swimming locker rooms,\nalthough itstated that it may be willing to ifdirected to do so by OCR. Thus, as ofthe date of\nthis letter, a total often private changing areas are available inthe girls' PE locker room,\nincluding the five shower areas with the new privacy curtains and the five restroom stalls, and the\nDistrict indicated a willingness to install privacy curtains on two presently unused shower stalls\nto create a total oftwelve private changing areas.\nApplicable Legal Standards\nUnder Title IX,\"[n]o person inthe United States shall, on the basis ofsex, be excluded from\nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education\nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). The regulation\nimplementingTitle IX, at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a), provides, inrelevant part, that no person shall,\non the basis ofsex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected\nto discrimination under any academic, extracurricular, or othereducation program or activity\noperated by a recipient which receives Federal financial assistance. The regulation implementing\nTitle IX, at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(b), further provides that a recipient may not, on the basis ofsex,\ndenyany person such aid, benefit or services; treat an individual differently from another in\ndetermining whether the individual satisfies any requirement or condition for the provision of\nsuch aid. benefit, or service; provide different aid. benefits, or services or provide aid, benefits, or\nservices in a different manner; subject any person to separate or different rules ofbehavior; or\notherwise limit any person in the enjoyment ofany right, privilege or opportunity.

Additionally, OCR examines whether\nthe recipienttreatedthe individualinamannerthatwasconsistentwith establishedpoliciesand\nprocedures, andwhether there isanyotherevidence ofdiscrimination based on sex, gender\nidentity, orgender nonconformity.\nAnalysis\nOCR's investigation revealed that, exceptwith respect to locker room access, the Districthas\ntreated StudentA consistentwith hergender identityasagirl.This includes identifying Student\nA by her female name andwith female pronouns, providing herwith full access to all girls'\nrestrooms, andallowing herto participateingirls' interscholasticathletics. However, although\nStudentA mustchange clothes formandatory PEclassand forherteam's practices and\ncompetitions,the Districthasdenied Student A accessto itsgirls' locker rooms. Instead,the\nDistrict has required Student A to use separaterestroom facilities, including facilities that arenot\ncomparable to those provided other students; Student A has also used the nurse's officeto\nchange clothing. Student A has been observed entering orexiting girls' locker rooms several\ntimes, both for PE and athletics, in orderto store herclothes, obtain arental uniform, and change\nherclothes. The Districtreprimanded Student A on multiple occasions forthis. The Districthas\nrecently installed privacy curtains inthe PEgirls' locker room, but ithas not installed privacy\ncurtains inthe two other girls' lockerrooms orgranted Student A access to the PE girls' locker\nroom oranyofthe other girls' locker rooms.\nWith respect to the girls' locker rooms, the District has publicly stated that students should be\nableto use the lockerrooms consistentwith their gender identity, and Student A has stated her\nintention to use the private locker room areaswhen changing herclothes. Still, the District\nrefuses to provide accessto Student A to any partofthe girls' locker rooms, unless itrequiresher\nto usethe privatechanging areas. The evidence shows that,asaresultofthe District's denial of\naccessto the girls' locker rooms, Student A hasnot only received anunequal opportunityto\nbenefit from the District's educational program,but hasalsoexperienced anongoing sense of\nisolationandostracismthroughout herhigh schoolenrollment atthe School.

Nevertheless, OCR's investigation revealedthat inthe PEclass's swim unit, the\nDistrict's separatechanging arrangements(Restroom G) alsosingled out Student A fordifferent\ntreatment from thatofherpeers.Unlike the other female students, who had standardshowering\nfacilities and amenities within a locker room, Student A had access to a\"rinse\" showerand\nlimited amenities. The rinseshower was locatedinanarrowhallway through which all students\nhadto passto enter orexitthe girls' swimming locker room.\nThe District does not dispute that it hasdenied access to Student A to use the girls' locker rooms.\nThe District proffered as its legitimate, nondiscriminatoryjustification that it\"based its decision\non the needs ofallstudents,\" balancing Student A's rights and interests with the privacyconcerns\nofother female students. The District raisedtwo specific constitutional privacyconcerns. First,\nthe Districtcontends that\"permitting Student A to be presentinthe locker room would expose\nfemale studentsto being observed in astateofundress by abiologicallymale individual.\"The\nDistrict's second stated privacy concern isthat itwould be inappropriate for young female\nstudents to viewa naked male in the locker room in a state ofundress. The District stated that\n\"[g]ranting Student A the option to change herclothes inthe girls' lockerroom would expose\nfemale students as young as fifteen years ofage toabiologically male body.\"11 OCR finds the\nconcerns unavailing inthis case.\nThe District also points out that itoffered various alternative changing options for Student A.\nHowever, eachofthe alternatives provided or proposed forStudentA continued orwould\ncontinue to exclude Student A from the girls' lockerrooms and setherapartfrom her female\nclassmates andteammates. Some proposed alternative facilities were not comparable to those\nprovidedforothergirls,suchasthe proposed RestroomE forthe swimming unit.

OCR recognizes that, inpreventingand\nredressing discrimination, schools must formulate, interpret, and apply their rules ina manner\nthat respects the legalrights ofstudents, including constitutional rights relatingto privacy. The\ncivil rights laws that OCR enforces, including Title IX,must be interpreted inways that are\nconsistentwith constitutionallyprotected rights.\nConsistentwiththe Title IX regulations described above permitting school districts to have\nseparate lockerroom facilities, the School's locker rooms are separated by sex, with restricted\naccess to onlymembers ofthe same sex. Thus, the School's students have a reasonable\nexpectation ofprivacy in a lockerroom setting. Students engage in private activities in the locker\nrooms, such are changingclothes, using the bathroom, and showering.\nTo date, the District's position has been that itmust deny StudentA access to the girls' locker\nrooms inorderto protectthe privacy interests ofall ofitsstudents. In fact, however, the District\ncould satisfyits Title IXobligations as well as protectpotential or actual studentprivacy\ninterests. The District's installation and maintenance ofprivacycurtains in one locker room go a\nlongdistance toward achieving such anondiscriminatory alternative because providing sufficient\nprivacycurtainaccess to accommodate anystudentswhowish to beassured ofprivacy while\nchangingwouldallowforprotectionofallstudents' rightsinthiscontext. Those female students\nwishingtoprotecttheirownprivatebodiesfromexposureto beingobserved ina stateofundress\nbyother girls inthe locker rooms, including transgender girls, could change behind a privacy\ncurtain. StudentA has consistentlymade clear that she would use the privacycurtains to change\nifallowed access to the girls' locker rooms. This addresses the privacy interest innot exposing\nyoungfemale students inthe girls' lockerroomstothe intimate bodyparts ofStudent A- a\ntransitioningtransgendergirl- ina stateofundress. The privacy curtains the Districtalready has\ninstalled inone locker room could well besufficientto protectall its students' rights, with\nrespecttoaccesstothatlockerroom,iftheDistrictrescinded itsdiscriminatory denialofaccess\nto the lockerrooms for Student A.

OCRnotified the Districtofits Title IXdetermination on July 13, 2015, and has\nactivelynegotiated with the Districtfrom that date through the date ofthis letter. OCRdiscussed\naproposed agreement with the District onJuly 13,July 16,July 20, August 1,August 13,August\n19,September 16,September25, and October 8,2015. On October 12,2015, the District\ninformed OCRthat itwould not resolve the Title IX violation voluntarily. On October 13, 2015,\nOCR issued a letterdeclaring an impasse in the negotiations. OCR informed the Districtofits\ncontinued willingness to negotiate an agreement, including holding an in-person meetingwith the\nDistrict's Superintendenton October21. Duringthe meeting ofOctober21,2015, the District\npresented OCR diagrams and blueprints ofits locker room facilities that were consistent with\nwhat OCRhad observed during itsonsite. The Districtalso gave OCRa photograph ofa mock-\nupshower curtain asa representation ofwhat itwould usefor privacy curtains within the PE\ngirls' locker room.\nOn October28, 2015, OCRconducted an onsite visit at the School to viewthe privacycurtains\nthat District installed on October27, 2015, and had further negotiations with counsel for the\nDistrict.

The following definitions used\nbyresearch,advocacy and governmental organizations areprovided to assist inunderstanding\nthe guidance presented. Although these are the most commonly used terms, students may use\nother terms to describe theirgender identity, appearance, or expression. Terminology and\nlanguagedescribing transgenderand gender nonconforming individuals can differ based on\nregion, language, race or ethnicity, age, culture, and many other factors. It is recommended that\nschool staffand educators inquire about which terms a student uses to describethemselves and\ntheir experience. A good general guideline isto employthose terms which the student uses to\ndescribethemselves.\nDefinitions:\n1. Assigned sex- Sex recorded at birth, usually on the basis ofexternal genitalia.\n2. Cisgender- Aterm used to describe people who, for the most part, identify with the sex\nthey were assigned at birth.\n3. Gender binary- The assumptionthatthere are only two genders (male and female),\nratherthan morethan two genders or genderfluidity.\n4. Genderexpression - How people express theirgenderexternally based on mannerisms,\ndress, etc. A person's genderexpression/presentation may not always match theirgender\nidentity.\n5. Gender identity - A person's internal sense ofbeing male, female or some othergender,\nregardless ofwhether the individual'sappearance, expression or behavior differs from\n2\nEXHIBIT tA - \\\nPAGE\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-3    Filed 11/13/17    Page 31 of 53\nthattraditionallyassociated withtheindividual's sexassigned atbirth.Genderidentity is\ndistinct from and often unrelated to an individual's sexual orientation.\n6. Gender role-Thesociallydetermined setsofbehaviorsassignedto people basedon\ntheir biological sex.\n7. Gendersensitive- Materials and instruction strategies that issensitive to individual's\nsimilarities and differences regardinggenderrole,gender identity and/or sexual\norientation.\n8. Genderqueer- Apersonwhosegenderidentitycannotbecategorized as solely maleor\nfemale.Theterm isnota synonymfortransgenderandshould only beused ifsomeone\nself-identifies as genderqueer.\n9. Intersex- An umbrellaterm usedforpeoplebornwithreproductiveor sexual anatomy\nand/or chromosome pattern that does notseemto fit the typical definition ofmale or\nfemale. Intersexmay also beknownas DifferenceofSex Developmentand may not\nalways be known at birth, but may be revealed atany stage ofa person's life\n10. Sexual orientation- Means a person's physical, romantic, emotional, aesthetic, orother\nform ofattraction to others. Sexual orientation and gender identity are not the same.\nAlthough, the Oregon Legislature adopted a broaderdefinition of\"sexual orientation\" for\npurposes ofall Oregon statutes to \"mean an individual's actual or perceived\nheterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality or gender identity, regardless ofwhetherthe\nindividual's gender identity, appearance, expression or behaviordiffers from that\ntraditionally associated withtheindividual's sex atbirth.\"8\n11.Transgender- An umbrellaterm for personswhose gender identity, genderexpression,\nor behaviordoes not conform to that typically associated with the sexto which they were\nassigned at birth. Persons who identify as transgendermay or may not pursue medical\ntransition.\n12.Transgender female -This isa person whose assigned sex at birth ismale but identifies\nand lives as a female.\n13.Transgender male- This isa person whose assigned sex at birth isfemale but identifies\nand lives as a male.\n14.Transition - The time when a person begins living as the genderwith which they identify\nratherthan the genderthey were assigned at birth, which often includes changingone's\nfirst nameand dressing and grooming differently. Transition may or may not also include\nmedical and legal aspects, including taking hormones, having surgery, or changing\nidentity documents (e.g. driver's license,Social Security record) to reflect one's gender\nidentity.\n15.Transsexual - An outmoded term that refers to a person who has permanentlychanged -\nor seeksto change -their bodies through medical interventions (including but not limited\nto hormones and/orsurgeries). Unlike transgender, transsexual is not an umbrellaor\npopularterm. Manytransgenderpeopledonotidentifyastranssexual and preferthe word\ntransgender.

As with most other issues involved with creating a safe and\nsupportive environment for transgender students, the best course isto engage the student, and\npossibly the parents, with respect to name and pronoun use. The school district should decide\nwith the student and parents the best plan to reflect the individual student's needs when\ninitiating name and pronoun use.\nThere are no state laws which either require or prescribe requirements for school district issued\nstudent IDs. However, if your school district has chosen to issue student IDs, it is recommended\nthat student IDs be issued in the name reflecting the student's gender identity consistently\nasserted at school. This may require issuing the student a new ID card.\nFor those students who have been attending a school and undergo gender transition while\nattending the same school, school districts inconsultation with the student and parents should\ndevelop a plan for initiating use ofthe chosen name and pronouns consistent with the student's\ngender identity.\nExample: Atransgendergirl wastransferringtoa newhighschool. Sheaskedtheprincipal to\ninformherteachers thateven though herschoolrecords indicate thather name isJohn, shegoes\nbythenameJane and usesfemalepronouns.

That\nplan may include the option to inform and educate the student's peers or to not share the\ninformation with the student's peers.\nWhen atransgender student new to a school isusing a preferred name, the birth name should be\nkept confidential by school district staff. School districts should reviewtheir Student Information\nSystems and ensure that all printed and digital materials generated for classroom and instructor\nuse showthe student's chosen name, not their legal name. Examples include attendance sheets,\ngrade books, etc. School districts are reminded to use reasonable methods for ensuringthat only\nthose with a legitimate educational interesthave access to student records.\nODE will change a student's genderwithin the Secure Student Identification System (SSID)\nupon request from adistrict. ODE will allow the request from the districtto serve as the\n\"documentationto support the change\"that isgenerally required by ODE for changes to the\nSSID. There isno need for the studentto prove their new gender. The student's declaration of\ntheir gender isacceptable.\nSteps to change genderon the student record:\n• Updatethe student's gender inyour student information system\n• Update the student's gender in SSID\n• Checkyourerrors for any collections that do not catch the change\nFirst Name ChangeOptions and Process:\nThe administrative rules ofthe Secretary ofState and State Board ofEducation require that\nstudent records contain at a minimum the full legal name ofthe studentand other\ninformation.19Although ODE maintains ageneral expectation thatthelegal name intheschool\nelectronic record be consistentwith the legal name ofthe student, in the case oftransgender\nstudents itmay benecessary to deviate fromthis policyto support and protect the student.\n18ORS 179.505.\n19OAR166-400-0060(32)and581-022-1670(7).\n7\nEXHIBIT H - \\\nPAGE \"=?-\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-3    Filed 11/13/17    Page 36 of 53\nAdditionally, transgender students often makethe transition instages and may not, yet, be ready\nto complete the legal name change process. Inorderto support students, ODE recommends that\nschool districts enter the name the student iscurrently using (the name that correspondsto the\nstudent's self-identified gender) into the \"Preferred name\" field and retain the legal name inthe\nschool electronic record and generally inthe student records. However, in some student\ninformation systems, the \"preferred name\" does not appear throughoutthe system and the legal\nname may appear indaily use documents likethe gradebook, attendance records, etc. This can\nresult in\"outing\" ofthe studentas a studentwho istransgender.\nIncases such as these, ODE will supportthe following options:\n1. Replace the legal first name ofthe student inthe electronic system with the student's\npreferred name and move the legal name to the middle name field. Monitorfor SSID\nerrors and resolve. Student should retainthe sameSSID and last name inthe system.\n2. Replacethe legalfirst name ofthe student intheelectronic system and make sure you\nmonitorfor SSID errors.\n3. Havea cross-reference system inplace to locatethe student's electronic records by use of\nthe student's legal name.\n4. Retain the same SSID for the student inthe electronic system.\n5. Maintainthe student's legalnamegenerallywithinthe student's record as required by\nSecretaryofState administrative rules relating to the archiving ofstudent records.\nGraduation: Transcripts and Diplomas\nStudents are often still intransition atthe time ofgraduation and have not necessarily completed\nlegal name changesand otherdocumentation. Recommended best practice for graduating\ntransgenderstudents isto provide two diplomas and two sets oftranscripts, one with the legal\nfirst name and one with the preferred first name.\nOnce a student has completed a legal name change, they can request all records be updated in\ntheirstudenteducation record to reflect their legally changed name. This may happen before or\nafter graduation.\nAlthoughthere are no state requirements relating to whethertranscripts contain information\nabout a student's gender, it is recommendedthat studenttranscripts be gender neutral and\ncontain no indicatorofgenderfor any student.\nStudent Health Records\nSchool nurses and otherlicensed health professionals need accurate and reliable information to\nensurethatthe student receives appropriate care to enablethem to coordinate care with other\nhealth care providers. A school nurse should use the transgender student's preferred name and\nidentified genderexceptwhen necessaryto ensure the health and safetyofthe student.\n8\nEXHIBIT M^\\\nPAGE &\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 1-3    Filed 11/13/17    Page 37 of 53\nInstruction and Student Support (Comprehensive Sexuality Education)\nUnderOregon administrative rule, each school district shall provide an age-appropriate,\ncomprehensive plan ofinstruction focusing on human sexuality education. Course material and\ninstruction forall human sexuality education courses that discuss human sexuality inpublic\nelementary and secondary schools shall enhance students* understanding ofsexuality as a normal\nand healthy aspect ofhuman development. Localschool boards shall approve the plan of\ninstruction and require that it be reviewed and updated biennially in accordance with new\nscientific information and effective education strategies. The plan requires inclusive materials,\nlanguage, and strategies that recognizes different sexual orientations, gender identities and\ngender expression. Further, sexualityeducation materials, instructional strategies, and activities\nmust not, in any way, use shame orfear based tactics.2<)\nThe human sexuality education rule (OAR 581-022-1440) allows school districts to use\ninstructional strategies, provide material, and engage inactivities that promote a safe\nenvironment for all students to learn as well as healthy and positive peer\nrelationships. Importantly, comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) includes healthy sexuality\nand violence prevention instruction; itemphasizes dignity and respect for all; and validation for\nall individual and peer differences. Medically accurate, age appropriate, inclusive CSE isatool\nto support student understanding ofgender identity and sexual orientation diversity.\nGender-Based Activities, Rules, Policies, and Practices\nTitle IX prohibits discrimination on the basis ofsex in federally funded education programs and\nactivities. Regulations issued by the OCR authorize schools to offer single-sex classes or\nextracurricularactivities only under certain circumstances. For these reasons, school districts\nshould consult with their Title IX Coordinatoror legal counsel to review such policies, rules and\npractices, and should eliminate any that do not serve a clear pedagogical purpose.\nIn 2014. OCR issued guidance relating to Title IX which stated that: \"All students, including\ntransgender students and students who do not conform to sex stereotypes, are protected from sex-\nbased discrimination under Title IX. Under Title IX, a recipient generally must treat transgender\nstudents consistent with their gender identity inall aspects ofthe planning, implementation,\nenrollment, operation, and evaluation ofsingle-sex classes.**2\nBased on this guidance transgender students should be treated consistent with their gender\nidentity and should not be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be\nsubjected to harassment or other forms ofdiscrimination on the basis ofgender identity inany\nprogram or activity.

Counsel for Defendants did not object.  Plaintiffs never responded to \nIntervenor’s inquiry to meet and confer. \nII.  MOTION \n  Proposed Defendant-Intervenor moves to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint for failure to state \na claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The basis for this Motion are set forth in the \naccompanying memorandum. \nIII.  MEMORANDUM \nA.  Introduction. \n  Plaintiffs have sued Dallas School District No. 2 (the “School District”) and various federal \nofficials and agencies1 because the School District permits a boy who is transgender (“Student A”) \nto use locker room and restroom facilities with other boys in Dallas High School. If the School \nDistrict were to withhold permission for Student A to use facilities with other boys, it would \ndiscriminate against him on the basis of sex and transgender status in violation of the Constitution, \nfederal law, and state law, and it would put him at risk of harm.   \n  Proposed  Defendant-Intervenor  Basic  Rights  Oregon  (“BRO”)  is  a  not-for-profit \norganization committed to ensuring lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) \nOregonians live free from discrimination. See Mot. to Intervene.  BRO works throughout the state \nof Oregon to ensure that transgender students have safe, non-discriminatory environments in which \nto go to school. BRO submits this brief in support of its motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint. \n  Plaintiffs ask this Court to declare that the Student Safety Plan designed to prevent \ndiscrimination and bullying against Student A violates their right to privacy, free exercise, and \n                                                 \n1 Originally, Plaintiffs also sued Governor Kate Brown and the Oregon Department of Education, \nbut those defendants are no longer parties to this action. \nPAGE 1 -  MOTION TO DISMISS AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nLANE POWELL PC \n601 SW SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2100 \n008863.0020/7221893.1  PORTLAND, OREGON 97204-3158 \n503.778.2100  FAX: 503.778.2200 \n \n\n \nparental authority, and as well as Title IX and state anti-discrimination law. 2 They ask this Court \nto order the School District to ban boys who are transgender from boys’ restrooms and locker \nrooms, and girls who are transgender from girls’ restrooms and locker rooms. If Plaintiffs prevail, \ntransgender students will be barred from the facilities used by all other students of their gender, \nand forced to use separate facilities that other students may choose to use, but that only transgender \nstudents will be required to use. This stigmatizes transgender students by singling them out and \nisolating them from their peers. It sends a message that the mere presence of transgender students \nin  the  facilities  used  by  their  peers  is  unacceptable.  Transgender  youth  are  already  highly \nvulnerable to harassment, bullying, violence, and suicide.  See Prescott v. Rady Children’s Hosp.-\nSan Diego, 265 F. Supp. 3d 1090, 1099 (S.D. Cal. 2017) (denying motion to dismiss where mother \nclaimed her transgender son died by suicide following repeated, deliberate use of pronouns “she” \nand “her” for him by hospital staff); Doe by & through Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 276 F. \nSupp.  3d  324  (E.D.  Pa.  2017)  (quoting  expert  testimony  that  “[p]eer  reviewed  research \ndemonstrates that as many as 45% of gender dysphoric adolescents have had thoughts of suicide \ncompared to 17% in this age group); Whitaker By Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1051 (“There is no denying \nthat transgender individuals face discrimination, harassment, and violence because of their gender \nidentity”); Evancho v. Pine-Richland Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 3d 267, 288 (W.D. Pa. 2017) \n(“transgender people as a class have historically been subject to discrimination”). \n  The School District’s practice concerning single-sex facilities does not violate any law; to \nthe contrary, as several courts have recognized, it is the policy and practice sought by Plaintiffs \nthat would violate Title IX and state law, as well as the Equal Protection Clause. \nB.  Factual Background. \n  Based on the allegations in the Complaint, Plaintiffs are two organizations and seven \n                                                 \n2 While Plaintiffs are incorrect that the federal guidance regarding transgender students issued in \nor prior to 2016 violated the Administrative Procedure Act, Religious Freedom Restoration Act, \nU.S. constitution, or any other law, BRO will not address those claims as the federal government \nwithdrew that guidance in 2017.

They object \nto the Student Safety Plan created by the School District to ensure that Student A may safely \nparticipate in school activities. The Student Safety Plan acknowledges Student A as “a transgender \nmale expressing the right to access the boy’s locker room at Dallas High School.” Pls. Ex. A. It \ngoes on to state that staff will receive training and instruction, that teachers will teach about anti-\nbullying and harassment, that the PE teacher will be first to enter and last to leave the locker room, \nand that Student A’s locker will be in direct line of sight of the PE teacher in the coach’s office. \nId. The Student Safety Plan also states that Student A may use restrooms consistent with his \nidentity, i.e., boys’ restrooms, and lists several “Safe Adults” with whom he may share concerns. \nId. \n  Students must change their clothes before and after PE class in Dallas High School.  \nCompl. ¶ 98. There are no allegations that students undress completely or see one another’s \ngenitals while changing their clothes.  There are no allegations that students are required to shower \ntogether or at all, or that students typically take showers at school, or that any of the plaintiffs wish \nto take showers at school. There are no allegations that students must change clothes in common \nareas rather than in stalls. The principal of the School District offered use of a staff lounge if \nstudents  wished  to  change  in  complete  privacy  outside  of  a  multi-occupancy  locker  room. \nCompl. ¶ 91. The School District is also building more facilities with more privacy options. \nCompl. ¶ 81. There are no allegations that Student A has ever done anything harmful to anyone at \nall, inside restrooms and locker rooms or outside of them, other than simply using the restroom \nand locker room at the same time and in the same manner as other boys. \nC.  Argument. \n  Plaintiffs have not stated a plausible claim upon which relief may be granted.  A complaint \nmust contain “sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible \non its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, \n550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). While courts must accept factual allegations as true, they should not \nPAGE 3 -  MOTION TO DISMISS AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nLANE POWELL PC \n601 SW SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2100 \n008863.0020/7221893.1  PORTLAND, OREGON 97204-3158 \n503.778.2100  FAX: 503.778.2200 \n \n\n \n“assume the truth of legal conclusions merely because they are cast in the form of factual \nallegations.” Fayer v. Vaughn, 649 F.3d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir. 2011) (internal citations and \nquotation marks omitted). Nor do “unwarranted inferences” suffice to defeat a motion to dismiss. \nId. Because Plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts that would plausibly entitle them to relief \nunder the law, their claims should be dismissed with prejudice. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. \n1.  The School District’s practices and student safety plan do not violate the \nfundamental right to privacy. Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim that the School District’s \nactions have violated their fundamental right to bodily privacy. Plaintiffs are asserting a new right \nunder the Due Process Clause that has never been recognized by any court in this country, and \nshould not be recognized now: the right to exclude other people from common spaces.  \nThe  Fourteenth  Amendment  may,  in  some  instances,  include  a  “privacy interest  in \nremaining free from involuntary viewing of private parts of the body by members of the opposite \nsex.” Caribbean Marine Services Co., Inc. v. Baldwin, 844 F.2d 668, 677 (9th Cir. 1988). \nHowever, a violation of this interest has typically only been found where a government official \ngratuitously photographed or touched the genital area of someone with a different gender. See e.g., \nByrd v. Maricopa Cty. Sheriff’s Dep’t, 629 F.3d 1135, 1142 (9th Cir. 2011) (finding cross-gender \nsearch unreasonable where, despite availability of male officers and lack of emergency, a female \ncadet conducted a search of a man that included having him strip to his underwear, using her hand \nto move his testicles and scrotum, and placing her hand in between his buttocks to search his anus); \nYork v. Story, 324 F.2d 450, 452 (9th Cir. 1963) (finding that female crime victim stated a claim \nfor violation of her privacy rights where male police officer took pictures of her in the nude for no \nlegitimate reason over her objection and circulated those pictures among other officers).  \nA government official viewing the completely naked body of a person of a different gender \nagainst their will, even in the absence an emergency, does not always constitute a violation of \nprivacy. See Grummett v. Rushen, 779 F.2d 491, 494 (9th Cir. 1985) (finding no privacy violation \nwhere female guards viewed male prisoners infrequently or from a distance while they dressed, \nPAGE 4 -  MOTION TO DISMISS AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nLANE POWELL PC \n601 SW SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2100 \n008863.0020/7221893.1  PORTLAND, OREGON 97204-3158 \n503.778.2100  FAX: 503.778.2200 \n \n\n \nused the toilet, showered, or underwent searches, even without applying lesser scrutiny based on \nthe plaintiffs’ status as prisoners). Furthermore, where cross-gender viewing of genitals may be \navoided simply through inconvenience, there is no privacy violation; nor do privacy considerations \nnecessarily trump anti-discrimination interests. See Caribbean Marine Services Co., Inc., 844 F.2d \nat  677  (finding  the  district  court  abused  its  discretion  in  failing  to  consider  the  “strong \ngovernmental and public interest in nondiscriminatory hiring practices” when granting preliminary \ninjunction to stop a plan  in which women would join men in cramped quarters with common \ntoilets and showers).  \nHere, Plaintiffs have alleged no facts to suggest they have ever been forced to expose their \ngenitals to any government official, much less any student, of any gender. They have not alleged \nthat they must undress completely to prepare for PE. When they partially undress, they may do so \nin latching toilet stalls. The possibility of brief, accidental glimpses of someone through a gap in \na toilet stall partition simply does not rise to the level of a violation of the constitutional right to \nprivacy. But students concerned about the possibility of such glimpses may use the school’s unisex \nfacilities. (ECF 1, ¶ 91.) Plaintiffs have not alleged that the school permits anyone look over or \nunder toilet stalls, or that anyone in the School District has ever done so or threatened to do so, of \nany gender. \nIn Students & Parents for Privacy, a federal district court in Illinois denied a motion for a \npreliminary injunction in a case with facts nearly identical to this one. The district court adopted \nthe magistrate judge’s Report and Recommendation, which explained: \nThere is no reason why a student who does not want to do so would \nhave to take off clothing or reveal an intimate part of his or her body \noutside of the private stalls. Inside the stalls, there is no meaningful \nrisk that any part of a student’s unclothed body would be seen by \nanother person. Therefore, these protections almost entirely mitigate \nany potential risk of unwanted exposure either by or to any Student \nPlaintiff. \nStudents & Parents for Privacy v.

Pa. 2017) (rejecting the school district’s argument that the policy \nimplicated any actual privacy concerns at all “given the actual physical layout of the student \nrestrooms at the High School,” which meant that “anyone using the toilets or urinals at the High \nSchool is afforded actual physical privacy from others”); Bd. of Educ. of Highland Local Sch.

Again, no Student Plaintiffs are compelled to change in front of other students. \nMoreover, those seeking additional privacy may change in private bathroom stalls or the staff \nlounge. (ECF 1, ¶ 91.). What they may not do is exclude students from common facilities that \nmatch their gender identity simply because they are transgender.  \nPlaintiffs allege that their right to privacy is violated by the mere “risk” of being in the \npresence of boys who are transgender in the boys’ facilities, or girls who are transgender in the \ngirls’ facilities. ECF 1, ¶ 190. But the mere presence of transgender people in the common areas \nof these facilities do not violate any fundamental right deeply rooted in this nation’s history and \ntradition. No court in this country has recognized a fundamental right to exclude others from \ncommon spaces. In fact, many courts have recognized that the presence of transgender students in \ncommon restrooms or locker rooms does not infringe anyone’s constitutional right to privacy. Doe \nv.

The School District’s practices and Student Safety Plan do not violate Title IX.  \nPlaintiffs have not pled sufficient facts to support a claim of discrimination on the basis of sex \nunder Title IX.  On the contrary, they seek injunctive relief that would violate Title IX by \ndiscriminating against transgender students. \na.  Plaintiffs have not alleged facts that, if true, would support a finding of \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex.  To sustain a sexual harassment claim under Title IX, Plaintiffs \nmust establish that they were students at a school receiving federal funds, that they experienced \nharassment based on sex, and that the harassment was “so severe, pervasive, and objectively \noffensive”  that it “deprive[s] the victim of access to the educational opportunities or benefits \nprovided by the school.” Reese v.

Rather, they advance a novel \nclaim—that a plan that allows a transgender student to use facilities that accord with his gender \nidentity, in and of itself, creates “a sexually harassing hostile environment” sufficient to state a \nclaim under Title IX. (ECF 1, ¶¶ 226, 227.)  It does not. \nNo court has ever held that permitting transgender students to use bathrooms and locker \nrooms consistent with their gender identity is the equivalent of sexual harassment. Such a \nconclusion would require finding that simply being transgender transforms the ordinary use of a \nbathroom or locker room into an act of harassment. The “mere presence of a transgender student \nin a restroom or locker room does not rise to the level of conduct that has been found to be \nobjectively offensive, and therefore hostile, in other cases.” Students & Parents for Privacy v. U.S. \nDep’t of Educ., No. 16-cv-4945, 2016 WL 6134121, at *32 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 18, 2016); see also Doe \nv. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., No. 17-1249, 2017 WL 3675418, at *67 (E.D. Pa.

The \nregulation states that schools “may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on \nthe basis of sex, but such facilities provided for students of one sex shall be comparable to such \nfacilities provided for students of the other sex.”  This regulation permits, but does not require, \nsingle-sex facilities. It does not permit, much less require, that schools force transgender students \nout of the facilities that will be most consistent with their gender identity, health, safety, or dignity. \nThe Student Safety plan to which Plaintiffs object does not permit sex-based discrimination \nor harassment. It does not say that girls may be treated differently or worse than boys, that sexual \nharassment of students will be tolerated, or that school officials will abstain from taking action \nagainst students, teachers, or staff who discriminate against or harass people on the basis of sex. \nIn fact, the opposite is true.

Plaintiffs have not alleged that Student Plaintiffs are \nbeing treated differently from others, or that they are being singled out based on their sex, or that \nthey are being harassed because they do to do not match sex stereotypes. According to the facts as \nstated in the Complaint, like any other students, Student Plaintiffs are permitted to use a multi-\noccupancy restroom and locker room consistent with their gender identity; like any other students, \nif they do not wish to do so, they may use a single-occupancy facility; and like any other students, \nthey are entitled to protection against sexual harassment and bullying. The substance of Plaintiffs’ \nclaims appears to be not an objection to Student Plaintiffs receiving different or worse treatment \nthan other students, but to transgender students receiving equal treatment. That is not a violation \nof their rights under Title IX. \nPAGE 9 -  MOTION TO DISMISS AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nLANE POWELL PC \n601 SW SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2100 \n008863.0020/7221893.1  PORTLAND, OREGON 97204-3158 \n503.778.2100  FAX: 503.778.2200 \n \n\n \nb.  The injunctive relief Plaintiffs seek would discriminate on the basis of \nsex.  Instead of remedying sex discrimination, the injunctive relief Plaintiffs seek, which would \nbar transgender students from access to restrooms and locker rooms consistent with their gender \nidentity, would violate Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause. See Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified \nSch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034, 1050, 1053-54 (7th Cir. 2017) (Title IX and equal \nprotection); Evancho v. Pine-Richland Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 3d 267 (W.D. Pa. 2017) (equal \nprotection); Highland, 208 F. Supp. 3d at 874-77 (equal protection). \nThe First, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits have recognized that discrimination \nagainst a transgender individual is discrimination because of sex under federal civil rights statutes \nand the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. See Kastl v. Maricopa Cty. Cmty. Coll. Dist., \n325 Fed. App’x 492, 493 (9th Cir. 2009) (holding that under Title VII and Title IX “it is unlawful \nto discriminate against a transgender (or any other) person because he or she does not behave in \naccordance with an employer’s expectations for men and women”); Schwenk v. Hartford, 204 F.3d \n1187, 1201-03 (9th Cir. 2000); Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1051; Dodds v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 845 \nF.3d 217, 221 (6th Cir. 2016); Smith v.

Co., 214 F.3d 213, \n215-16 (1st Cir. 2000).   \nA person’s transgender status is an inherently sex-based characteristic. The incongruence \nbetween gender identity and gender designated at birth is what makes a person transgender. \nTreating  a  person  differently  because  of  the  relationship  between  those  two  sex-based \ncharacteristics is literally discrimination on the basis of “sex.” See Schwenk, 204 F.3d at 1201-\n1203 (finding discrimination on the basis of gender interchangeable with discrimination on the \nbasis of sex for purposes of federal discrimination statutes); see also Roberts v.

By analogy, religious discrimination includes not just discrimination \nagainst Jews and Christians, but also discrimination against people who convert from Judaism to \nChristianity. Cf. Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm’n, 480 U.S. 136, 144 (1987) (refusing \nto adopt interpretation of Free Exercise Clause that would “single out the religious convert for \ndifferent, less favorable treatment”). Similarly, sex discrimination includes discrimination against \npeople who have undergone a gender transition from the gender designated for them at birth. See \nSchroer v. Billington, 577 F. Supp. 2d 293, 306-07 (D.D.C. 2008) (making same analogy); Glenn, \n663  F.3d  at  1314  (firing  employee  because  of  her  “intended  gender  transition”  is  sex \ndiscrimination); Dawson v.

Sept. 15, 2015) (same).  \nIn  addition,  discrimination  against  people  because  they  are  transgender  is  sex \ndiscrimination because it inherently rests on sex stereotypes and gender-based assumptions. As the \nSupreme Court recognized in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, “assuming or insisting that [individual \nmen and women] match[] the stereotype associated with their group” is discrimination because of \nsex. 490 U.S. 228, 251 (1989) (plurality); see also Kastl, 325 Fed. App’x at 493; Schwenk, 204 \nF.3d at 1201-1203 (finding that “the perpetrator’s actions stem from the fact that he believed that \nthe victim was a man who ‘failed to act like’ one” and holding that this constitutes prohibited sex \ndiscrimination).    By  definition,  transgender  people  depart  from  stereotypes  and  overbroad \ngeneralizations about men and women. Indeed, “a person is defined as transgender precisely \nbecause” that person “transgresses gender stereotypes.” Glenn, 663 F.3d at 1316; accord Whitaker, \n858 F.3d at 1048; Dodds, 845 F.3d at 221; see also Schwenk, 204 F.3d at 1201-1203. “[A]ny \ndiscrimination against transsexuals (as transsexuals)—individuals who, by definition, do not \nconform to gender stereotypes—is … discrimination on the basis of sex as interpreted by Price \nWaterhouse.” Finkle v.

Indeed, \n“the most obvious example” of a Title IX violation is “the overt, physical deprivation of access to \nschool resources.” Davis, 526 U.S. at 650; cf. Snyder ex rel. R.P. v.

U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. \n609, 625 (1984). “[D]iscrimination itself, … by stigmatizing members of the disfavored group[,] \n… can cause serious non-economic injuries to those persons who are personally denied equal \ntreatment solely because of their membership in a disfavored group.” Heckler v. Mathews, 465 \nU.S. 728, 729 (1984); cf. J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., 511 U.S. 127, 142 (1994) (explaining that \nwhen a juror is excluded based on gender “[t]he message it sends to all those in the courtroom, and \nall those who may later learn of the discriminatory act, is that certain individuals, for no reason \nother than gender, are presumed unqualified”); United States v.

Ct. 2675, 2694 \n(2013) (explaining that refusal to recognize marriages of same-gender couples “tells those couples, \nand all the world, that their otherwise valid marriages are unworthy of federal recognition”).  \nIn the context of transgender students and separate-sex facilities, this exclusion can also \ncause other harms. See Evancho, 237 F. Supp. 3d at 294 (finding irreparable harm where girls who \nare transgender were marginalized through being prohibited from using girls’ rooms, “causing \nthem genuine distress, anxiety, discomfort and humiliation”); Bd. of Educ. of the Highland Local \nSch.

Plaintiffs have not stated a claim for which relief \nPAGE 13 -   MOTION TO DISMISS AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nLANE POWELL PC \n601 SW SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2100 \n008863.0020/7221893.1  PORTLAND, OREGON 97204-3158 \n503.778.2100  FAX: 503.778.2200 \n \n\n \nmay be granted. \n3.  Plaintiffs’ Oregon discrimination claims fail for similar reasons as their Title \nIX claim.  Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient to state a claim that the School District’s \nactions violate Oregon’s prohibition against discrimination in education, Or. Rev. Stat. Ann. § \n695.850, or public accommodation laws, Or. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 659A.403. Plaintiffs state that they \nhave suffered discrimination based on their sex, sexual orientation and religion because they have \nbeen “deprived of the right to utilize restrooms, locker rooms and showers without encountering \npersons of the opposite biological sex.” (ECF 1, ¶¶ 267-68). Plaintiffs further allege discrimination \nin education because they have not been “provid[ed] reasonable accommodations based on the \nhealth and safety needs of plaintiffs and others coming on school premises.” (ECF 1, ¶ 273).  The \nComplaint is devoid of any facts sufficient to show discrimination under either law. To the \ncontrary, the Complaint alleges numerous facts that show Student Plaintiffs are not receiving \ndifferent or worse treatment than other students.  Rather, Plaintiffs’ Complaint seeks relief that \nwould perpetrate the very harm Oregon’s anti-discrimination laws seek to prevent—discrimination \nbased on sex and gender identity against Student A now and other transgender students in the \nfuture. \nPlaintiffs ask the court to order that Student A, or any other transgender person, be excluded \nfrom school facilities used by Student Plaintiffs.  Such action by the School District, if taken, \nwould violate Oregon anti-discrimination laws.3  Oregon’s protections from discrimination based \non sexual orientation include protections from discrimination based on gender identity. Or. Rev. \nStat.  Ann.  §  174.100  (defining  sexual  orientation  as  “actual  or  perceived  heterosexuality, \n                                                 \n3 While it is true that a federal court possesses the power to remedy constitutional violations \nthrough injunctive relief that violates otherwise valid state laws, Plaintiffs fail to plead facts \nsufficient  to  show  a  federal  constitutional  harm,  nor  does  their  pleading  show  how  the \ndiscriminatory relief sought is essential to remedying the alleged harms. See, Stone v. City & Cty. \nof San Francisco, 968 F2d 850, 862 (9th Cir 1992), as amended on denial of reh’g (Aug. 25, 1992) \n(otherwise valid state laws or court orders cannot stand in the way of a federal court’s remedial \nscheme if the action is essential to enforce the scheme). \n \nPAGE 14 -   MOTION TO DISMISS AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nLANE POWELL PC \n601 SW SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2100 \n008863.0020/7221893.1  PORTLAND, OREGON 97204-3158 \n503.778.2100  FAX: 503.778.2200 \n \n\n \nhomosexuality, bisexuality or gender identity, regardless of whether the individual’s gender \nidentity, appearance, expression or behavior differs from that traditionally associated with the \nindividual’s sex at birth”).  Both Oregon’s education nondiscrimination law and Oregon’s public \naccommodation nondiscrimination law prohibit discrimination against transgender people. Or. \nRev. Stat. Ann. § 659.850 (defining and prohibiting discrimination in education); Or. Rev. Stat. \nAnn. § 659A.403 (prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations).  If the School District \nexcluded Student A from using the boys’ bathroom because he is transgender, it would be a prima \nfacie case of discrimination under Oregon law.  Nothing about Student Plaintiffs’ purported harm \ndue to the alleged discomfort or fear they experience changes that. \na.  Plaintiffs have not alleged facts that, if true, would support a finding of \ndiscrimination in education.  In order to state a claim for discrimination in education, Plaintiffs \nmust allege facts sufficient to show that an act of the School District either (1) “unreasonably \ndifferentiates treatment” or (2) “is fair in form but discriminatory in operation” based on their sex, \nsexual orientation or religion. See Or. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 659.850(1); see also Nakashima v. Oregon \nState Bd. Of Educ., 344 Or. 497, 185 P.3d 429 (2008) (interpreting § 659.850’s differential \ntreatment language as prohibiting “a policy or practice that affirmatively treats some persons less \nfavorably than others based on certain protected criteria”). Under the second theory, an act with \ndiscriminatory impact is only prohibited when it is not “reasonably necessary to a program’s or \nactivity’s successful operation or the achievement of its essential objectives.” Nakashima v. \nOregon State Bd. Of Educ., 344 Or. 497, 515-16, 185 P.3d 429, 440 (2008). Section 659.850 only \nprovides for “reasonable accommodation of an individual based on the health and safety needs of \nthe individual” in the context of dress codes or policies.  \nThe Complaint lacks a single factual allegation showing that the School District has taken \nadverse action against the Student Plaintiffs based on their sex, sexual orientation, or religion. Nor \ndoes the Complaint contain any facts that Student Plaintiffs are subject to differential treatment.  \nStudent Plaintiffs are not being denied any facilities or privileges. The Complaint alleges facts to \nPAGE 15 -   MOTION TO DISMISS AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nLANE POWELL PC \n601 SW SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2100 \n008863.0020/7221893.1  PORTLAND, OREGON 97204-3158 \n503.778.2100  FAX: 503.778.2200 \n \n\n \nthe contrary: Student Plaintiffs have the option to (1) continue to share fully and equally in school \nfacilities, or (2) use a separate facility if they so choose. There is no denial, difference, or disparity. \nLike all other students, Student Plaintiffs are allowed access to facilities consistent with their \ngender identity; like all other students, they may use a single-occupancy facility if they prefer; and \nlike all other students, they are entitled to protection against sexual harassment and bullying. If \nanything, the School District has provided all students an additional advantage on the same terms \nas all other students.  \nStudent Plaintiffs do not have a right to use school facilities to the exclusion of transgender \nstudents.  See, Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., No. 17-1249, 2017 WL 3675418, at *67 (E.D. \nPa. Aug. 25, 2017); see also id. at 55 (“[H]igh school students … have no constitutional right not \nto share restrooms and locker rooms with transgender students whose sex assigned at birth is \ndifferent from theirs.).  Discomfort with sharing spaces with transgender people is not a cognizable \nharm under Oregon’s anti-discrimination laws. \nStudent Plaintiffs also fail to allege facts sufficient to show they were entitled to any \naccommodation based on their health and safety.  The health and safety accommodation in § \n659.850 (1) is rarely litigated and scant case law is available to guide this court’s decision.  \nHowever, the language of the statute itself suggests that the provision is limited to the review of \ndiscriminatory dress code policies.  See Or. Rev. Stat. § 659.850 (1) (“‘Discrimination’ does not \ninclude enforcement of an otherwise valid dress code or policy, as long as the code or policy \nprovides, on a case-by-case basis, for reasonable accommodation of an individual based on the \nhealth and safety needs of the individual.)

To the extent an \naccommodation is required under Oregon law,4 the School District provided a sufficient one—use \nof the staff lounge. (ECF 1, ¶¶ 91, 79). \nb.  Plaintiffs have not alleged facts that, if true, would support a finding of \ndiscrimination in a place of public accommodation.  In order to state a claim for discrimination \nin a place of public accommodation, Plaintiffs must allege facts sufficient to show that the School \nDistrict denied Plaintiffs “full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges” \nbased on their sex, sexual orientation or religion. Or. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 659A.403.5  Plaintiffs again \nfail to allege even one fact that shows they were denied access to a public accommodation, nor is \nthere any fact showing a denial based on their sex, sexual orientation or religion.  \nAccording to the Complaint, the School District policy requires just the opposite.  It \nprovides that all students regardless of their sex, sexual orientation or religion may use facilities \nin accordance with their gender identity.  (ECF 1, Ex. A)  Providing equal access to school facilities \nfor transgender students does not make the facilities limited or unequal for all other students.  Such \na finding would be absurd.  Oregon courts have made clear that a place of public accommodation \nviolates § 659A.403 when it excludes transgender people based on other peoples’ desire not to \nshare the same space. See Blachana, LLC v. Oregon Bureau of Labor & Industries, 273 Or. App. \n806, 819, 359 P.3d 574, 581 (Or. App. 2015) (affirming agency finding that a bar violated § \n659A.403 when it requested a social group primarily comprised of transgender people not return \nto the bar due to other patrons’ perception that when the social group was present, it was a bar for \ntransgender people). Plaintiffs have not alleged that they are being treated any differently from \nother students or parents based on sex, sexual orientation, or religion. \n                                                 \n4  Section  659.850  does  not  include  an  independent  religious  accommodation  requirement. \nNakashima, 344 Or. at 511-12 (rejecting the notion that § 659.850 adopted a duty of reasonable \naccommodation of religion akin to that in Title VII). \n5 To the extent Plaintiffs fail to state a claim against the School District under § 659A.403, \nPlaintiffs’ claim that School District has aided or abetted in any discrimination as prohibited by \n§ 659A.406 is also deficient. Plaintiffs have not alleged any acts prohibited in § 659A.409. \nPAGE 17 -   MOTION TO DISMISS AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nLANE POWELL PC \n601 SW SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2100 \n008863.0020/7221893.1  PORTLAND, OREGON 97204-3158 \n503.778.2100  FAX: 503.778.2200 \n \n\n \nc.  The relief Plaintiffs seek is discriminatory under Oregon law.  As \nexplained above, the relief sought by Plaintiffs would cause the very harm prohibited under Oregon \nlaw by discriminating against transgender students.  Plaintiffs’ claims attempt to turn Oregon’s \nanti-discrimination laws on their head by alleging that the School District is required to exclude \nStudent A because he is transgender.  No such right exists in Oregon law or cases applying anti-\ndiscrimination laws.  This is no surprise because Oregon’s anti-discrimination laws were created \nto allow access to education and places of public accommodation regardless of gender identity. \nOregon Senate Bill 2, Staff Measure Summary at 1 (Mar. 12, 2007) (“WHAT THE MEASURE \nDOES:  .  .  .  Defines  ‘sexual  orientation’  to  mean  an  individual’s  actual  or  perceived \nheterosexuality,  homosexuality,  bisexuality  or  gender  identity,  regardless  of  whether  the \nindividual’s gender identity, appearance, expression or behavior differs from that traditionally \nassociated with the individual’s sex at birth. Establishes that a person may not discriminate based \non an individual’s sexual orientation with regard to employment, housing, public accommodations, \npublic services, public education, adult foster homes and foster parenting, among other things. \nDeclares that the opportunity to obtain employment, housing and use public accommodations, free \nof discrimination based on sexual orientation, religion, age, race, color, sex, national origin, or \nmarital status, is a civil right. Allows an individual who has experienced discrimination based on \nsexual orientation to bring a civil action for injunctive relief, damages and attorney fees.”). \nWhen actions are taken to exclude transgender people based on others’ unwillingness to \nshare the same space, those actions are discriminatory. See, Blachana, 273 Or. App. at 819, 359 \nP.3d at 581 (finding a violation of Oregon’s public accommodation law when a bar excluded \ntransgender people it blamed for reduced patronage). Treating Student A differently by banning \nhim from boys’ restrooms and locker rooms would discriminate against him because his gender \nidentity does not match his assigned sex at birth; it would carry out precisely the evil the legislature \nintended to prevent. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ discrimination claims based on Oregon law should \nbe dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. \nPAGE 18 -   MOTION TO DISMISS AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nLANE POWELL PC \n601 SW SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2100 \n008863.0020/7221893.1  PORTLAND, OREGON 97204-3158 \n503.778.2100  FAX: 503.778.2200 \n \n\n \n4.  The District’s policies and actions do not violate the fundamental right to \nparent children.  Parent Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim that their Fourteenth Amendment \nright to direct the education and upbringing of their children has been infringed upon by the Student \nSafety Plan. No case law suggests that the fundamental right to parent encompasses a right to send \none’s children to school absent the presence of transgender students in common areas of restrooms \nand locker rooms. Moreover, such a rule would violate the Equal Protection Clause, as explained \nin section II(B). Second, Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim that their fundamental right to parent \nwas infringed upon by the distribution of a student survey. \na.  The Student Safety Plan does not violate the right to parent.  Plaintiffs \nallege the Student Safety Plan violates their parental liberty rights by infringing on their right to \n“instill moral standards and values” into their children, which include using public school facilities \nsuch as restrooms and locker rooms without the presence of transgender students. It is clear from \nprecedent in the Ninth Circuit and others that the Fourteenth Amendment encompasses “no such \nspecific right.” Fields v. Palmdale School District, 427 F.3d 1197, 1203 (9th Cir. 2005). \nThe Supreme Court has held the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \nencompasses a parental liberty right. See Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923) (striking down \na Nebraska law prohibiting teaching of foreign language); Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. \n510 (1925) (striking down Oregon’s compulsory attendance law). However, this right is not \nexclusive or absolute. Fields, 427 F.3d at 1204. The Ninth Circuit has made clear that “Meyer, \nPierce, and their progeny ‘evince the principle that the state cannot prevent parents from choosing \na specific educational program,’ but they do not afford parents a right to compel public schools to \nfollow their own idiosyncratic views as to what information the schools may dispense.” Id. at 1206 \n(quoting Brown v. Hot, Sexy & Safer Prods., Inc., 68 F.3d 525, 533 (1st Cir. 1995)). See also Blau \nv. Fort Thomas Public School Dist., 401 F.3d 381, 395-96 (6th Cir. 2005) (holding parents did not \nhave a fundamental right to exempt student from school dress code). The Court concluded “the \nMeyer–Pierce right does not extend beyond the threshold of the school door,” and thus parents \nPAGE 19 -   MOTION TO DISMISS AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nLANE POWELL PC \n601 SW SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2100 \n008863.0020/7221893.1  PORTLAND, OREGON 97204-3158 \n503.778.2100  FAX: 503.778.2200 \n \n\n \nhave no constitutional right to force the state to run its public schools in accordance with their \nparticular moral or religious beliefs. Fields, 427 F.3d at 1207.  \nParents have the right to remove their students from Dallas County schools, but “once \nparents make the choice as to which school their children will attend, their fundamental right to \ncontrol the education of their children is, at the least, substantially diminished.” Id. at 1206. \nPlaintiffs have no fundamental right to prohibit the School District from allowing transgender \nstudents to use facilities consistent with their gender identity because of their own personal moral \nor religious opposition. Therefore, they have failed to state a claim for relief under the Fourteenth \nAmendment against the Student Safety Plan. \nb.  The student survey did not violate the right to parent.  Plaintiffs have \nalso failed to state a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment with respect to the student survey. \nThey allege La Creole Middle School administered a survey to students about “personal and family \nmatters” without parental notice or consent. They allege the survey asked questions pertaining to \nsuch topics as the sufficiency of school and food supplies at home, drug and alcohol use, suicide, \nsexual orientation, and gender identity.  \nThe Ninth Circuit in Fields made clear that schools may conduct surveys that inquire into \npersonal matters, including “exposure to early trauma” or “aggression and verbal abuse.” 427 F.3d \nat 1200 n.1. Numerous courts have also upheld school programs that “educate children in sexuality \nand health” without parental notification or consent. Id. at 1207. See, e.g., Parents United for Better \nSch., Inc. v. School Dist. of Philadelphia Bd. of Educ., 148 F.3d 260, 275 (3d Cir. 1998) (rejecting \nparental  liberty  challenge  to  school  condom  distribution  program  without  parental \nnotification); Doe v. Irwin, 615 F.2d 1162, 1168-69 (6th Cir. 1980) (state operation of a birth \ncontrol clinic that distributed contraceptives to minors without parental consent did not violate \nparental liberty). Plaintiffs allege their students understood the survey as mandatory, while school \nofficials later informed them it was voluntary. Either way, many courts have upheld programs \npertaining to sexual health even when mandatory. See, e.g., Leebaert v. Harrington, 332 F.3d 134 \nPAGE 20 -   MOTION TO DISMISS AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nLANE POWELL PC \n601 SW SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2100 \n008863.0020/7221893.1  PORTLAND, OREGON 97204-3158 \n503.778.2100  FAX: 503.778.2200 \n \n\n \n(2d Cir. 2003) (upholding mandatory health classes); Brown v. Hot, Sexy & Safer Prods., Inc., 68 \nF.3d 525 (1st Cir.1995) (upholding compulsory sex education assembly program). \nThe Ninth Circuit made clear that administration of school surveys, including those \ndistributed to children pertaining to personal family and sexual matters, do not infringe upon a \nfundamental right, whether it be privacy or parental liberty. Fields, 427 F.3d at 1208. Therefore, \nany such actions by the School District would be subject only to rational basis review. Id. There \ncan be no question that “the broad aims of education” or “the state’s interest as parens patriae” \nwould satisfy this level of review. Id. at 1210. Under the Ninth Circuit’s precedent, Plaintiffs have \nfailed to state a claim for relief that the administration of the survey violated their fundamental \nrights. \n5.  The Student Safety Plan does not infringe on the free exercise of religion.  \nCertain plaintiffs allege that the School District has violated their right to free exercise of religion. \nHowever, they have failed to allege any specific facts showing a plausible infringement on \nobservation of their religious beliefs. Had Plaintiffs made such allegations, the Student Safety Plan \nwould still only be subject to rational basis review, because it is a neutral, generally-applicable \npolicy. But even if the Student Safety Plan were subject to strict scrutiny, it would survive that \nscrutiny, because it is narrowly tailored to serve the compelling government interests of student \nsafety and non-discrimination. \na.  The  facts  alleged  in  the  Complaint  do  not  plausibly  support  an \ninfringement of any plaintiff’s ability to practice their religion in any respect.  The Plaintiffs \nhave not alleged sufficient facts to support the claim that the Student Safety Plan interferes with \ntheir freedom to practice their religion. No plaintiff has alleged that the Student Safety Plan has \nforced  them  to  “affirm[]  a  repugnant  belief,”  penalized  them  for  their  religious  beliefs,  or \n“impede[d] the observance” of an aspect of their religion. Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 402, \n404, 83 S. Ct. 1790, 1793, 1794 (1963). The only specific plaintiffs alleged to have sincerely held \nreligious beliefs regarding restroom and locker room use are Kris Golly, Jon Golly, and their \nPAGE 21 -   MOTION TO DISMISS AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nLANE POWELL PC \n601 SW SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2100 \n008863.0020/7221893.1  PORTLAND, OREGON 97204-3158 \n503.778.2100  FAX: 503.778.2200 \n \n\n \nchildren, Lindsay Golly and A.G. See Compl. ¶ 120. None of the four currently attend Dallas High \nSchool. Lindsay is a former student, and A.G. may attend in the future. See Compl. ¶ 16. None of \nthe four have alleged that they have ever been compelled to do anything against their religious \nbeliefs, or prevented from doing something required by their religious beliefs.  \nAssuming that sharing the common areas of public restrooms or locker rooms with a girl \nwho was transgender would interfere with Lindsay’s or her parents’ religious practices, there are \nno allegations that such an event has ever occurred or is likely to occur in the future. In fact, \nPlaintiffs have alleged that the Student Safety Plan only gives one boy who is transgender \npermission to use boys’ locker rooms and restrooms. See Compl. ¶ 261. There are no allegations \nthat there was ever a girl who was transgender who attended Dallas High School while Lindsay \ndid, much less that Lindsay ever met a girl who was transgender at Dallas High School, in or out \nof girls’ locker rooms or bathrooms. Even if there were, Lindsay had the option of using the staff \nlounge or other single-occupancy facility if her religion required her to have complete privacy. See \ne.g. Compl. ¶ 91 (asserting that the principal offered the unisex staff lounge for changing to those \nstudents with objections to the Student Safety Plan); ¶ 79 (asserting that unisex restroom, locker \nroom, and shower facilities are accessible in Dallas High School through the main office). Lindsay \nno longer attends Dallas High School.  \nA.G. is in eighth grade. Compl. ¶ 16. The court may take judicial notice of the fact that \nDallas High School serves grades 9 to 12, as noted on the school’s publicly available web site. See \nhttps://www.dallas.k12.or.us/dallas-high-school. A.G. and Student A do not attend school together \nnow. There are no allegations that Student A will continue to attend Dallas High School next year, \nor that A.G. and Student A will ever attend the same school at the same time. Even if there were, \nA.G. could use the staff lounge or another single-occupancy facility if his religious beliefs required \nhim to have complete privacy. \nTo the extent the Gollys object to the possibility that teachers informed Lindsay of the anti-\nbullying and anti-harassment policy or Student Safety Plan while she attended Dallas High School, \nPAGE 22 -   MOTION TO DISMISS AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nLANE POWELL PC \n601 SW SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2100 \n008863.0020/7221893.1  PORTLAND, OREGON 97204-3158 \n503.778.2100  FAX: 503.778.2200 \n \n\n \nthey do not state a cognizable claim. “[T]he mere fact that a child is exposed on occasion in public \nschool to a concept offensive to a parent’s religious belief does not inhibit the parent from \ninstructing the child differently.”  Parker v. Hurley, 514 F.3d 87, 105 (1st Cir. 2008); see also \nMozert v Hawkins County Bd. of Educ., 827 F.2d 1058 (6th Cir. 1987) (public school requiring \nstudy of evolution does not burden objecting family’s free exercise rights); Beattie v. Line \nMountain Sch. Dist., 992 F. Supp. 2d 384, 394 (M.D. Pa. 2014) (female student could not be \nexcluded from wrestling team to protect students against “the perceived psychological and moral \ndegradation accompanying coeducational wrestling”); Adams ex rel. Adams v. Baker, 919 F. Supp. \n1496, 1504 (D. Kan. 1996) (female student could not be excluded from wrestling team based on \n“student and parent objections based on moral beliefs”).  \nTo the extent that other plaintiffs beside the Gollys have concerns about the free exercise \nof their religious beliefs, those facts have not been plausibly or specifically alleged. To the extent \nthat plaintiffs seek to claim that the Student Safety Plan may infringe on other people’s religious \nliberty, they do not have standing to do so. Accordingly, no plaintiffs have standing to seek \ninjunctive relief on this claim, nor has any Plaintiff asserted sufficient facts to state a claim for \nwhich relief may be granted. \nb.  The Student Safety Plan is neutral and generally applicable because it \ndoes not target religion.  As the Supreme Court explained in Employment Division v. Smith, 494 \nU.S. 872, 879 (1990), “the right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to \ncomply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes \n(or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).” (internal quotation marks \nomitted). A law that is neutral and generally applicable is constitutionally permissible if it is \nrationally related to a legitimate government interest. See Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. \nCity of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993).  \nPlaintiffs claim that the Student Safety Plan is not generally applicable because it is a plan \nfor one student. Compl. ¶ 261. This assertion reflects a misunderstanding of the term “generally \nPAGE 23 -   MOTION TO DISMISS AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nLANE POWELL PC \n601 SW SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2100 \n008863.0020/7221893.1  PORTLAND, OREGON 97204-3158 \n503.778.2100  FAX: 503.778.2200 \n \n\n \napplicable.” “Generally applicable” means that the government action is not “specifically directed \nat” a religious practice. Employment Division, 494 U.S. at 878. To make that determination, the \nSupreme Court has looked at whether the government enforces a law “in a selective manner” to \n“impose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief” and not on similar conduct \nmotivated by other reasons. See Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 543; see also Thomas v. Anchorage Equal \nRights Comm’n, 165 F.3d 692, 701–02 (9th Cir.), reh’g granted, opinion withdrawn on other \ngrounds,  192  F.3d  1208  (9th  Cir.  1999),  and  on  reh’g,  220  F.3d  1134  (9th  Cir.  2000) \n(“Underinclusiveness is not in and of itself a talisman of constitutional infirmity; rather, it is \nsignificant only insofar as it indicates something more sinister.”); Stormans, Inc. v. Wiesman, 794 \nF.3d 1064, 1082 (9th Cir. 2015) (“The mere existence of an exemption that affords some minimal \ngovernmental discretion does not destroy a law’s general applicability”).  \nPlaintiffs have alleged no facts that could plausibly support a claim that the Student Safety \nPlan targets any particular religious group or religious practice, that it has been enforced selectively \nagainst people engaging in religiously-motivated conduct, or that it has as its “object” the \n“suppression” of anyone’s free exercise of religion. Employment Division, 494 U.S. at 878. No \nfacts alleged suggest that the school district implemented the policy to infringe on religious \npractices or beliefs. Cf. Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U.S. 574, 604 n.30 (1983) (finding \nthat IRS policy barring racial discrimination does not “prefer[] religions whose tenets do not \nrequire racial discrimination over those which believe racial intermixing is forbidden”).  \nThe Student Safety Plan was explicitly “aimed to support all students.” Exhibit A. The \nStudent Safety Plan only directly speaks to the conduct of staff, administrators, and teachers, and \nuses the term “all” for the categories of people it addresses. While the Student Safety Plan does \nnot directly apply to students, it can be read to imply that students may not stop Student A from \nusing the boys’ restrooms or locker rooms, and that no student may harass or bully anyone. To that \nextent, it affects all students equally, regardless of their religious beliefs or lack thereof. Unlike in \nLukumi, where “almost the only conduct subject to [the challenged ordinances was] the religious \nPAGE 24 -   MOTION TO DISMISS AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nLANE POWELL PC \n601 SW SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2100 \n008863.0020/7221893.1  PORTLAND, OREGON 97204-3158 \n503.778.2100  FAX: 503.778.2200 \n \n\n \nexercise of Santeria church members,” 508 U.S. at 535, the Student Safety Plan has no exceptions \nor carve-outs that indicate its provisions are actually intended to apply solely to members of one \nor more religious group.  \nThe Student Safety Plan is generally applicable, and any burden on religious practice \nincidental. As such, strict scrutiny does not apply. Furthermore, the “hybrid-rights” exception does \nnot apply because Plaintiffs have not asserted any companion constitutional claims for which they \ncan demonstrate a “fair probability or a likelihood … of success on the merits. Miller v. Reed, 176 \nF.3d 1202, 1207 (9th Cir. 1999). Therefore, rational basis applies, and the Student Safety Plan \neasily meets that threshold. \nc.  Even if strict scrutiny applies, the Student Safety Plan is narrowly \ntailored to serve the compelling government interests of safety and non-discrimination.  Even \nif Plaintiffs’ had alleged sufficient facts to show that their religious exercise were in some way \nrestricted and even if the Student Safety Plan were not generally applicable, the Student Safety \nPlan would survive strict scrutiny. It is narrowly tailored to the compelling government interests \nof promoting student safety and eliminating discrimination on the basis of sex and transgender \nstatus.  \nProtecting student safety is a compelling government interest. See e.g. Goehring v. Brophy, \n94 F.3d 1294, 1300 (9th Cir. 1996) (finding that university had a compelling interest in the health \nand wellbeing of its students); Cheema v. Thompson, 67 F.3d 883, 885 (9th Cir. 1995) (finding \nthat school district had a compelling interest in campus safety). Likewise, the Supreme Court has \nrecognized repeatedly that the government has a compelling interest “of the highest order” in \n“eliminating discrimination and assuring . . . citizens equal access to publicly available goods and \nservices.” Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 624, 104 S. Ct. 3244, 3253 (1984); see also id. \nat  628  (discrimination “cause[s]  unique  evils  that  government  has  a  compelling  interest  to \nprevent”); N.Y. State Club Ass’n, Inc. v. City of N.Y., 487 U.S. 1, 14 n.5 (1988) (recognizing the \n“State’s ‘compelling interest’ in combating invidious discrimination”); Bd. of Directors of Rotary \nPAGE 25 -   MOTION TO DISMISS AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nLANE POWELL PC \n601 SW SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2100 \n008863.0020/7221893.1  PORTLAND, OREGON 97204-3158 \n503.778.2100  FAX: 503.778.2200 \n \n\n \nInt’l v. Rotary Club of Duarte, 481 U.S. 537, 549, 107 S. Ct. 1940, 1948 (1987); Bob Jones Univ., \n461 U.S. at 604.  Likewise, anti-discrimination laws and policies ensure “society the benefits of \nwide participation in political, economic and cultural life.” Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, \n625 (1984). \nThe School Safety Plan is narrowly tailored to serve both of these interests. The only \nalternative—not permitting Student A to use facilities with other boys solely because he is \ntransgender—would perpetrate the very harms the School District sought to avoid. It would \ncompromise Student A’s safety and well-being, and it would discriminate against him on the basis \nof sex and transgender status. See Section II. Avoiding discrimination against Student A furthers \nthe government’s compelling interest in ending the “stigmatizing injury” of discrimination as well \nas “the denial of equal opportunities that accompanies it.” Roberts, 468 U.S. at 625; see also \nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2783 (2014) (“The Government has a \ncompelling interest in providing an equal opportunity to participate in the workforce without \nregard to race, and prohibitions on racial discrimination are precisely tailored to achieve that \ncritical goal.”). Other components of the Student Safety Plan, such as putting Student A’s locker \nin line of sight of the PE teacher, having the PE teacher be the first one in and last one out of the \nlocker room, and teaching students about anti-bullying and harassment, further demonstrate the \nprecise tailoring of the Student Safety Plan to student safety needs.  \nThe School District also sought to accommodate other students through continuing to \npermit them to use multi-occupancy restrooms and locker rooms precisely as they had always \ndone, as well as permitting them to use single-occupancy facilities if they preferred. In fact, the \nSchool District went even further, preparing for construction to provide additional options. Compl. \n¶ 81. Religious objections can be accommodated by providing additional privacy options to those \nwho  seek  them,  but  when  “sincere,  personal  opposition”  to    sharing  common  areas  with \ntransgender people becomes official school policy, “the necessary consequence is to put the \nimprimatur of the [school] itself on an exclusion that soon demeans or stigmatizes those whose \nPAGE 26 -   MOTION TO DISMISS AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nLANE POWELL PC \n601 SW SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2100 \n008863.0020/7221893.1  PORTLAND, OREGON 97204-3158 \n503.778.2100  FAX: 503.778.2200 \n \n\n \nown liberty is then denied.” Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2602 (2015). The School \nDistrict had no other way to serve its paramount interest in the safety and dignity of all students \nthan to permit Student A to use restrooms and locker rooms with other boys. \nD.

LR 7-1 CERTIFICATE \nPursuant to LR 7-1(a)(1)(A), the undersigned counsel for defendant Dallas School \nDistrict No. 2 certifies that the parties have made a good faith effort through conferral to resolve \nthe dispute and have been unable to do so. \n \nII.  MOTIONS \nDefendant Dallas School District No. 2 (the “District”) brings the following motions to \ndismiss plaintiffs Lindsay Golly and Nicole Lillie, and to dismiss all of the claims set forth in \nplaintiffs’ complaint on the basis that plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief can \nbe granted.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). \n \nIII.  INTRODUCTION \n  The Dallas School District is a public school district located in Dallas, Oregon.  The \nDistrict’s mission is to provide opportunities for the full intellectual development of each child.  \nAccordingly, the District prohibits discrimination and harassment on the basis of, among other \nthings, sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity.  Plaintiffs have sued the District over its \ninclusive policies.  Plaintiffs seek to force the District to implement a policy that would \ndiscriminate against some of the District’s students.  The District moves to dismiss several \nparties and all of the claims in this lawsuit, as set forth below. \n/// \n/// \n \nPAGE 1 -   DEFENDANT DALLAS SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 2’S MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n  MERSEREAU SHANNON LLP \n  111 SW COLUMBIA STREET, SUITE 1100 \n  PORTLAND, OREGON 97201-5865 \n  (503) 226-6400 \n \n\n \nIV.  THE COMPLAINT \n  The plaintiffs’ complaint alleges the following facts: \nA.   The Dallas School District \nThe Dallas School District is a public school that provides K-12 education to both male \nand female students.  Dkt. 1, Complaint (“Complaint”) ¶ 20.  The District does not have a written \nschool board policy that specifically applies to the use of facilities by transgender students; \nhowever, the District has a broad nondiscrimination policy that prohibits discrimination on the \nbasis of gender identity.  Complaint Exhibit B.  The District receives federal funding for its \neducational programs.  Complaint ¶ 21. \nStudent A is currently a 12th grade student at Dallas High School.  Complaint ¶ 76.  \nStudent A is a transgender male.  Complaint Exhibit A.  In September 2015, Student A began to \npublicly identify as male and requested permission to use the boys’ facilities at the high school.  \nComplaint ¶ 78.  The District provided Student A the choice of private facilities to change \nclothes for physical education from the fall of 2015 through the end of the school year in June, \n2016.  Complaint ¶ 79.  During the 2015-2016 school year, the District also developed a Student \nSafety Plan.  Complaint Exhibit A.  The Student Safety Plan permitted Student A to access the \nboys’ locker rooms and restrooms at Dallas High School.  Id. \nThe main boys’ locker room at Dallas High School is a square room with four banks of \nlockers and wooden benches, and communal showers along one wall.  Complaint ¶ 99.  The \nboys’ locker room also contains segregated lockers, showers and restroom facilities.  Id.  The \ngirls’ locker room is constructed similarly to the boys’ locker room.  Complaint ¶ 103. \nDallas High School students who desire the use of facilities that afford them additional \n \nPAGE 2 -   DEFENDANT DALLAS SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 2’S MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n  MERSEREAU SHANNON LLP \n  111 SW COLUMBIA STREET, SUITE 1100 \n  PORTLAND, OREGON 97201-5865 \n  (503) 226-6400 \n \n\n \nprivacy are permitted to use the unisex staff lounge and are offered other accommodations.  See \nComplaint ¶¶ 91, 265. \nB.  The Plaintiffs  \nPlaintiff Lindsay Golly no longer attends Dallas High School.  See Complaint ¶ 16.  \nPlaintiff A.G. is an 8th grade student at La Creole Middle School within the District.  Id.  He is \nnot subject to the Student Safety Plan.  See Complaint Exhibit A (stating that Student Safety Plan \napplies to the access to boys’ locker room at Dallas High School).  Plaintiffs Kris Golly and Jon \nGolly are the parents of Lindsay Golly and A.G.  Complaint ¶ 16.  Plaintiff T.F. is an 11th grade \nstudent at Dallas High School.  Complaint ¶ 17.  Plaintiff Melissa Gregory is T.F.’s parent.  Id.  \nPlaintiff Parents Rights in Education is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to protect and \nadvocate for parents’ rights to guide the education of their children.  Complaint ¶ 10.  Plaintiff \nParents for Privacy is an association of current and former students and their parents who are \nconcerned about United States Department of Education regulations and the Student Safety Plan.  \nComplaint ¶ 11.    \n \nV.  CONCEDED MOTIONS \nA.  Motion 1:  Lindsay Golly should be dismissed. \nThe District moves to dismiss Lindsay Golly because she does not have standing.  The \nDistrict and plaintiffs conferred, and plaintiffs consent to this motion. \nB.  Motion 2:  Nicole Lillie should be dismissed. \nThe District moves to dismiss Nicole Lillie.  Lillie is identified as a plaintiff in the \ncaption, but the complaint does not make any allegations regarding her involvement in this \n \nPAGE 3 -   DEFENDANT DALLAS SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 2’S MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n  MERSEREAU SHANNON LLP \n  111 SW COLUMBIA STREET, SUITE 1100 \n  PORTLAND, OREGON 97201-5865 \n  (503) 226-6400 \n \n\n \nmatter.  The District and plaintiffs conferred, and plaintiffs consent to this motion.  Plaintiffs \nintend to amend the complaint to make specific factual allegations regarding Lillie. \nC.  Motion 3:  A.G. and T.F.’s requests for compensatory damages should be \ndismissed. \n \nThe District moves to dismiss the request for compensatory damages brought by \nplaintiffs A.G. and T.F.  The District and plaintiffs conferred, and plaintiffs consent to this \nmotion.  Plaintiffs intend to amend the complaint to plead the right to compensatory damages as \nwell as the amounts sought. \n \nVI.  THE COMPLAINT FAILS TO STATE A CLAIM \nA.  Rule 12(b)(6) Legal Standard  \nIn reviewing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the court’s review is limited \nto the contents of the complaint. Clegg v. Cult Awareness Network, 18 F.3d 752, 754 (9th Cir. \n1994).  A court may also consider documents attached to the complaint, documents incorporated \nby reference into the complaint, or matters of judicial notice.  Van Buskirk v. CNN, 284 F.3d 977, \n980 (9th Cir. 2002).  A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is proper when no cognizable \nlegal theory supports the claim, or when the complaint lacks sufficient factual allegations to state \na facially plausible claim for relief under a cognizable legal theory.  Shroyer v. New Cingular \nWireless Servs., Inc., 622 F.3d 1035, 1041 (9th Cir. 2010).  In evaluating the sufficiency of a \ncomplaint’s factual allegations, the court must accept as true all well-pleaded material facts \nalleged in the complaint and construe them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.  \nWilson v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 668 F.3d 1136, 1140 (9th Cir. 2012).  However, the court “need \n \nPAGE 4 -   DEFENDANT DALLAS SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 2’S MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n  MERSEREAU SHANNON LLP \n  111 SW COLUMBIA STREET, SUITE 1100 \n  PORTLAND, OREGON 97201-5865 \n  (503) 226-6400 \n \n\n \nnot accept as true allegations contradicting documents that are referenced in the complaint.”  \nLazy Y Ranch Ltd. v. Behrens, 546 F.3d 580, 588 (9th Cir. 2008).   \n“While a complaint…does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiff’s obligation to \nprovide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a \nformulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do. Factual allegations must be \nenough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level….” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 \nU.S. 544, 555–56 (2007).  Moreover, “where the…facts do not permit the court to infer more \nthan the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it has not shown”—that \nthe plaintiff is “entitled to relief.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009). “In sum, for a \ncomplaint to survive a motion to dismiss, the non-conclusory ‘factual content,’ and reasonable \ninferences from that content, must be plausibly suggestive of a claim entitling the plaintiff to \nrelief.” Moss v. U.S. Secret Serv., 572 F.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir. 2009). \n \nB.  Motion 4:  Plaintiffs fail to state a claim for a violation of a constitutional \nright to privacy. \n \nIn the third claim for relief, plaintiffs allege that the District has violated a substantive \ndue process right to privacy.  Plaintiffs’ allegations fail to state a claim for at least two reasons:  \n(1) the alleged right to privacy does not exist; and (2) the District’s policies do not infringe on \nthe alleged rights. \n(1) Plaintiffs allege a broad right to privacy that does not exist under the \nUnited States Constitution. \n \nPlaintiffs do not have a constitutional right not to share restrooms and locker rooms with \ntransgender students.  “The Due Process Clause guarantees more than fair process, and the \n \nPAGE 5 -   DEFENDANT DALLAS SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 2’S MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n  MERSEREAU SHANNON LLP \n  111 SW COLUMBIA STREET, SUITE 1100 \n  PORTLAND, OREGON 97201-5865 \n  (503) 226-6400 \n \n\n \n‘liberty’ it protects includes more than the absence of physical restraint.”  Washington v. \nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 719 (1997).  “[I]n addition to the specific freedoms protected by the \nBill of Rights, the ‘liberty’ specially protected by the Due Process Clause includes the right to \nmarry, to have children, to direct the education and upbringing of one’s children, to marital \nprivacy, to use contraception, to bodily integrity, and to abortion.”  Id. at 720.   There is no \ngeneralized “right to privacy.”  See Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967).    Substantive due \nprocess only protects certain personal privacy rights that are “fundamental” or “implicit in the \nconcept of ordered liberty.”  Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 152 (1973).   \nProperly framed, see Stormans, Inc. v. Wiesman, 794 F.3d 1064, 1085-86 (9th Cir. 2015), \nplaintiffs assert a broad, previously unrecognized right to privacy.  They contend that the United \nStates Constitution gives them the right not to encounter their transgender peers in restrooms and \nlocker rooms.  There is no legal support for the proposition that plaintiffs have a fundamental \nprivacy right to avoid coming in contact with transgender students in common spaces.  As two \nfederal courts have recently found, high school students do not have such a right.  Students & \nParents for Privacy v. U.S. Dep’t. of Educ., 2016 WL 6134121, **23-27 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 18, 2016) \n(“Students & Parents”); Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 2017 WL 3675418, **49-55 (E.D. \nPenn. Aug. 25, 2017).   \nThis conclusion is bolstered by the fact that in assessing the existence and potential scope \nof plaintiffs’ alleged privacy rights, the court must “consider the need to preserve the discretion \nof schools to craft individualized approaches to difficult issues that are appropriate for their \nrespective communities.”  Students & Parents, 2016 WL 6134121, at *24.  The public school \nsystem “relies necessarily upon the discretion and judgment of school administrations and school \n \nPAGE 6 -   DEFENDANT DALLAS SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 2’S MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n  MERSEREAU SHANNON LLP \n  111 SW COLUMBIA STREET, SUITE 1100 \n  PORTLAND, OREGON 97201-5865 \n  (503) 226-6400 \n \n\n \nboard members[.]”   Wood v. Stickland, 420 U.S. 308, 386 (1975).  “[Section] 1983 was not \nintended to be a vehicle for federal court-correction of errors in the exercise of that discretion \nwhich do not rise to the level of violations of specific constitutional guarantees.”  Id.  The \nSupreme Court “has repeatedly emphasized the need for affirming the comprehensive authority \nof the States and of school officials, consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards, to \nprescribe and control conduct in the schools.”  Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 \nU.S. 503, 207 (1969).  Thus, the District’s decision to allow students to use restrooms and locker \nrooms that align with gender identity should be given great deference. \n(2) The District has not infringed on plaintiffs’ alleged privacy rights. \n \nPlaintiffs assert the right to privacy in their unclothed bodies and the right to be free from \ngovernment-compelled risk of intimate exposure to the opposite biological sex.  See Complaint \n¶¶198-199. Assuming for the sake of argument that such a broad right exists and is actually at \nissue in this case, plaintiffs have not alleged that District policies infringed upon those rights. \nIn order for a government entity to be responsible for the violation of an individual’s \nconstitutional rights, government action must violate that right.  See, e.g., Whalen v. Roe, 429 \nU.S. 589 (1977).  The government’s interference must be direct or substantial.  Zablocki v. \nRedhail, 434 U.S. 374, 387 n. 12 (1978).  Mere incidental effects are not cognizable.  \nChristensen v. County of Boone, 483 F.3d 454, 463 (7th Cir. 2007). \nHere, the District has authorized Student A to use the main sex-segregated locker rooms \nand restrooms.  Plaintiffs allege that within those locker rooms are “segregated lockers, showers \nand restroom facilities[.]”  Complaint ¶ 99.  Plaintiffs further allege that students who wish to \nuse private facilities have been given the option to do so.  Complaint ¶ 91.  Thus, plaintiffs have \n \nPAGE 7 -   DEFENDANT DALLAS SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 2’S MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n  MERSEREAU SHANNON LLP \n  111 SW COLUMBIA STREET, SUITE 1100 \n  PORTLAND, OREGON 97201-5865 \n  (503) 226-6400 \n \n\n \nnot alleged facts to show that the government has compelled them to risk exposing themselves to \nthe “opposite biological sex.”   \nMoreover, the complaint does not allege that either remaining student plaintiff – A.G. or \nT.F. – has ever seen a transgender student’s unclothed body.   As such, and as was the case in \nStudents & Parents, “this case does not involve any forced or involuntary exposure of a student’s \nbody to or by a transgender person assigned a different sex at birth” and “Plaintiffs are not \nsuffering a ‘direct’ and ‘substantial’ infringement on any substantive due process right.”  \nStudents & Parents, 2016 WL 6134121, at *95.  \n \nC.  Motion 5:  The District’s policy does not violate parents’ rights to control the \nupbringing of their children. \n \nPlaintiffs allege that the District is violating their constitutional right to control and direct \nthe upbringing of their children by (a) allowing District students to access facilities that align \nwith gender identity, and (b) staff conducting a Needs Assessment at La Creole Middle School.  \nPlaintiffs fail to state a claim because the parental right to direct the upbringing of children – the \nso-called Meyer-Pierce right – “does not extend beyond the threshold of the school door.”  \nFields v. Palmdale Sch. Dist., 427 F.3d 1197, 1207 (9th Cir. 2005). \nThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment gives parents and guardians the \nright to control the upbringing of their children.  Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923); Pierce \nv. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 534-535 (1925).  However, this right is limited, and it does \nnot give parents the right to dictate the policies of public educational institutions.  Leebaert v. \nHarrington, 332 F.3d 134, 141 (2d Cir. 2003) (“Meyer, Pierce, and their progeny do not begin to \n \nPAGE 8 -   DEFENDANT DALLAS SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 2’S MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n  MERSEREAU SHANNON LLP \n  111 SW COLUMBIA STREET, SUITE 1100 \n  PORTLAND, OREGON 97201-5865 \n  (503) 226-6400 \n \n\n \nsuggest the existence of a fundamental right of every parent to tell a public school what his or her \nchild will or will not be taught.”)  The right allows parents to remove their children from a public \neducational institution and select a private institution, or school their children at home, in order \nto inculcate the children with their preferred values.  See Blau v. Fort Thomas Pub. Sch. Dist., \n401 F.3d 381, 395-96 (6th Cir. 2005); Brown v. Hot, Sexy & Safer Prods., Inc., 68 F.3d 525 (1st \nCir. 1995).  It does not “afford parents a right to compel public schools to follow their own \nidiosyncratic views as to what information the schools may dispense.”  Fields, 427 F.3d at 1206.  \nTo illustrate, the Constitution protects a parent’s right to teach their children that racial \nsegregation is preferable.  Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 177 (1976).  However, the \nConstitution clearly does not require, or entitle, a school to racially segregate its students in order \nto support such a viewpoint.  Id.  The Supreme Court has clearly stated that, simply because \nsome parents wish to teach their children that racial discrimination is not only permissible but \npositive, schools remain prohibited from doing so, and this prohibition does not violate this \nparental right.  Id.      \nThe District is permitted to institute policies, such as the Student Safety Plan, in order to \neducate and accommodate District students.  The parent plaintiffs’ disagreement with the \nDistrict’s decision-making in this regard does not violate parents’ right to control their child’s \neducation.   \nPlaintiffs also allege that the District violated their constitutional right to direct the \nupbringing of their children because staff at La Creole Middle School administered a “Needs \nAssessment” to students.  This precise assertion was rejected by the Ninth Circuit in Fields.  \nThere, parents complained that a survey administered to their first, third and fifth grade students, \n \nPAGE 9 -   DEFENDANT DALLAS SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 2’S MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n  MERSEREAU SHANNON LLP \n  111 SW COLUMBIA STREET, SUITE 1100 \n  PORTLAND, OREGON 97201-5865 \n  (503) 226-6400 \n \n\n \nwhich included explicit questions on the subject of sex, violated their substantive due process \nrights to parental control.  Fields, 427 F.3d at 1200-1203.  The court rejected the parents’ claim: \nThe parents’ asserted right ‘to control the upbringing of their \nchildren by introducing them to matters of and relating to sex in \naccordance with their personal and religious values and beliefs,’ by \nwhich they mean the right to limit what public schools or other \nstate actors may tell their children regarding sexual matters, is not \nencompassed within the right to control their children’s upbringing \nand education. \n \nId. at 1207.    \nNotwithstanding, plaintiffs have not alleged facts sufficient to hold the school district \nliable based on the Needs Assessment.  There is no vicarious liability under section 1983.  \nMonell v. Dep’t of Social Svs. of City of New York, 436 U.S. 658, 691-94 (1978).  Instead, a \nmunicipal entity – here, the District – rather than the individual employees must have caused the \nalleged constitutional deprivation.  Id. at 692.  Therefore, a plaintiff suing under section 1983 \nmust identify a policy or custom of the government body that caused the constitutional \ndeprivation, and a link between the policy or custom and the alleged deprivation.  Mere \nassertions that a defendant deprived a plaintiff of their constitutional rights are insufficient to \nmaintain a section 1983 claim.  Likewise, a plaintiff’s failure to identify a policy or custom \nwhich led to the deprivations, or to allege facts which would meet the municipal policy \nrequirement, are grounds on which to dismiss section 1983 claims.  That is, so-called Monell \nliability is an element of any section 1983 claim, meaning that “notice” pleading standards \nrequire plaintiffs suing municipal entities under section 1983 to allege that Monell is satisfied, \nand to provide plausibly supporting facts.  AE ex rel. Hernandez v. Co. of Tulare, 666 F.3d 631, \n636-38 (9th Cir. 2012) (so holding). \n \nPAGE 10 -   DEFENDANT DALLAS SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 2’S MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n  MERSEREAU SHANNON LLP \n  111 SW COLUMBIA STREET, SUITE 1100 \n  PORTLAND, OREGON 97201-5865 \n  (503) 226-6400 \n \n\n \nThere are three general ways that a plaintiff making a section 1983 claim can establish \nthat the municipal entity itself caused an alleged constitutional deprivation.  First, a plaintiff can \nprove that the employee who deprived him of a constitutional right did so because he was acting \npursuant to a formal municipal policy, or a custom of the municipal entity so entrenched that it \namounts to a formal policy.  Second, the plaintiff can prove that the person who allegedly \ndeprived him of a constitutional right was an official with “final policymaking” authority such \nthat the official’s act necessarily constitutes a formal municipal policy. Third, a plaintiff can \nprove that an official with final policymaking authority “ratified” a municipal employee’s \nalleged unconstitutional act.  See Gillette v. Delmore, 979 F.2d 1342, 1346-47 (9th Cir. 1992). \nHere, the complaint fails to identify any policy or custom of the District which caused the \nadministration of the Needs Assessment of which they complain.  Nor does the complaint allege \nany facts that would otherwise meet the municipal policy requirement.  Therefore, plaintiffs \nfailed to state a claim predicated on the Needs Assessment. \n \nD.  Motion 6:  Plaintiffs do not allege facts to establish a Title IX hostile \nenvironment claim. \n \nPlaintiffs’ fourth claim is for a Title IX violation based on an allegedly sexually harassing \nhostile environment.  They allege that allowing students to use restrooms, locker rooms, and \nshowers that correspond to gender identity creates a sexually hostile environment.   \nTitle IX provides in part that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, \nbe excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under \nany education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  \n \nPAGE 11 -   DEFENDANT DALLAS SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 2’S MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n  MERSEREAU SHANNON LLP \n  111 SW COLUMBIA STREET, SUITE 1100 \n  PORTLAND, OREGON 97201-5865 \n  (503) 226-6400 \n \n\n \nTo prevail on a Title IX hostile environment claim, plaintiffs must allege and prove the District \nhad 1) “actual knowledge” of, and 2) was “deliberately indifferent” to, 3) harassment “on the \nbasis of sex” by 4) someone the school district controlled, that was 5) so “severe, pervasive, and \nobjectively offensive” that it deprived plaintiffs of access to the educational benefits or \nopportunities provided by the school district.  Davis v. Monroe Co. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, \n644-45, 650 (1999).   \n(1) Plaintiffs have not alleged a hostile environment based on sex.   \n \nPlaintiffs have not alleged that they were harassed or treated differently on the basis of \ntheir sex.  In order to state a claim for harassment in violation of Title IX, the harassment must \nbe “on the basis of sex.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681.   \nPlaintiffs complain about the Student Safety Plan, but they are not being targeted or \nsingled out on the basis of sex, nor are they being treated any differently than any female \nstudents who attend school within the District.  The District’s Nondiscrimination Policy applies \nto all students.  Complaint Exhibit B.  It applies equally to male and female students.  Id.  The \nmere fact that Student A is utilizing the policy to access District facilities, and that it is \nmemorialized in the Student Safety Plan does not demonstrate that the Student Safety Policy \ntargets male students because of their sex.  See Students & Parents, 2016 WL 6134121, at *31.  \nBecause there is no discrimination on the basis of sex, plaintiffs fail to state a claim under Title \nIX. \n(2) A student’s use of school facilities that corresponds to gender identity \nis not severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive.  \n \nThe allegations in the complaint do not come close to the “severe, pervasive, and \n \nPAGE 12 -   DEFENDANT DALLAS SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 2’S MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n  MERSEREAU SHANNON LLP \n  111 SW COLUMBIA STREET, SUITE 1100 \n  PORTLAND, OREGON 97201-5865 \n  (503) 226-6400 \n \n\n \nobjectively offensive” standard required by Title IX.  Davis, 526 U.S. at 633 (holding that an \naction “will lie only for harassment” that meets all three requirements).  Conduct that rises to this \nlevel typically involves multiple instances of physical sexual contact or threatened physical \nsexual contact.  For example, Davis involved several instances of sexual touching and suggestive \nrubbing.  526 U.S. at 653 (describing repeated acts of harassment and noting that the perpetrator \nultimately pleaded guilty to criminal sexual misconduct); see also, Vance v. Spencer County \nPublic School District, 231 F.3d 253, 259 (6th Cir. 2000); Roe ex rel. Callahan v. Gustine \nUnified School District, 678 F.Supp.2d 1008, 1026 (E.D. Cal. 2009).  \nNeither remaining student plaintiff has alleged a single specific instance of harassment or \nimproper use of District facilities.  Instead, they suggest that a transgender student’s use of \nschool facilities that corresponds to that student’s gender identity is per se severe, pervasive, and \nobjectively offensive.  It is not. \nCases that involve sex-based harassment or hostile environment claims predicated on \ntransgender people sharing facilities alongside their cisgender peers have rejected plaintiffs’ \ntheory.  In Cruzan v. Special School District No. 1, 294 F.3d 981 (8th Cir. 2002) (per curium) a \nfemale teacher alleged that the school’s decision to allow a transgender female teacher to use the \nwomen’s faculty restroom created a hostile work environment on the basis of sex.  The Eighth \nCircuit rejected plaintiffs’ argument, finding that a transgender female’s presence in a restroom \nalongside her cisgender female co-worker did not create a hostile working environment:   \n[The plaintiff] does not assert [her transgender female colleague] \nengaged in any inappropriate conduct other than merely being \npresent in the women’s faculty restroom.  Given the totality of the \ncircumstances, we conclude a reasonable person would not have \nfound the work environment hostile or abusive. \n \nPAGE 13 -   DEFENDANT DALLAS SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 2’S MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n  MERSEREAU SHANNON LLP \n  111 SW COLUMBIA STREET, SUITE 1100 \n  PORTLAND, OREGON 97201-5865 \n  (503) 226-6400 \n \n\n \n \nId. at 984; see also Students & Parents, 2016 WL 6134121, at *32 (“mere presence” of \ntransgender student in restroom or locker room is not objectively offensive); Boyertown, 2017 \nWL 3675418, at *66 (same).  \nHere, similarly, there is no allegation that Student A or any other District student has \ndone anything other than use the restrooms and locker rooms for the facilities’ designated \npurpose.  This does not meet the high standard necessary to allege severe, pervasive, and \nobjectively offensive harassment under Title IX.   \n(3) Plaintiffs do not have a Title IX claim predicated on the District’s \noffer to accommodate them. \n \nThe District has offered accommodations to students request to use restrooms and locker \nroom facilities that afford additional privacy.  See Complaint ¶¶ 243-244.  Plaintiffs contend that \nthese accommodations violate Title IX.  Id. at ¶ 245. \nThere is no legal support for this proposition.  The plaintiffs’ complaint alleges that the \nDistrict provides comparable locker room facilities for males and females.  See Complaint ¶ 104.   \nAs the court explained in Students & Parents, “Student plaintiffs who choose to use the alternate \nsingle-use facilities cannot complain that the alternate facilities are not ‘comparable’ to the main \nfacilities offered to boys and girls, which they have chosen not to use.”  2016 WL 6134121, at \n*36. \n \nE.  Motion 7:  Plaintiffs have not stated a Free Exercise claim. \nThe Student Safety Plan does not violate the plaintiffs’ Free Exercise rights.  The \nplaintiffs allege that the District’s actions “burden the free exercise rights of some Plaintiffs[.]”  \n \nPAGE 14 -   DEFENDANT DALLAS SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 2’S MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n  MERSEREAU SHANNON LLP \n  111 SW COLUMBIA STREET, SUITE 1100 \n  PORTLAND, OREGON 97201-5865 \n  (503) 226-6400 \n \n\n \nThis claim is without merit. \n(1) Kris Golly, Jon Golly, and A.G. do not have standing to assert a Free \nExercise claim based on the Student Safety Plan. \n \nThe Gollys and A.G. do not have standing to assert a Free Exercise Claim.  Article III of \nthe Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal district courts to “cases” or “controversies,” a \nrestriction which requires a plaintiff to show that he or she has actually been injured by \ndefendant’s challenged conduct.  DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 342 (2006).  To \nsatisfy the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III which is the “irreducible constitutional \nminimum” of standing, a plaintiff must show three things.  First, that they have suffered an \n“injury in fact,” which is an invasion of a legally protected interest which is concrete and \nparticularized, and actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.”  Lujan v. Defenders of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).  A plaintiff must show, second, that there is a causal \nconnection between the injury and the conduct complained of.”  Id. And third, it “must be likely, \nas opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Id. \nat 561.  In shorthand, a plaintiff must show injury in fact, causation, and redressability.   \nThe only specific allegations concerning the Free Exercise claim involve Kris and Jon \nGolly and their son A.G.1  See Complaint ¶ 120, 216.  They do not allege that the Student Safety \nPlan has compelled them to do anything that violates the teachings of their religion, nor could \nthey make such an allegation.  The Student Safety Plan plainly applies to Dallas High School.  \nComplaint Exhibit A.  Kris Golly, Jon Golly, and A.G. do not attend Dallas High School.  \nTherefore, they do not have standing to bring a Free Exercise claim to challenge the Student \n                                                 \n1 As stated above, plaintiffs have agreed to dismiss Lindsay Golly. \n \nPAGE 15 -   DEFENDANT DALLAS SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 2’S MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n  MERSEREAU SHANNON LLP \n  111 SW COLUMBIA STREET, SUITE 1100 \n  PORTLAND, OREGON 97201-5865 \n  (503) 226-6400 \n \n\n \nSafety Plan.           \n(2) The Student Safety Plan does not violate the Free Exercise clause. \nThe First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause provides that “Congress shall make no \nlaw…prohibiting the free exercise [of religion].”  U.S. Const. amend. I.  The right to exercise \none’s religion freely, however, “does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a \nvalid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or \nprescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).”  Emp’t Div. v. Smith, 494 U.S. \n872, 879 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nThe Student Safety Plan is generally applicable and neutral with respect to religion.  And \nplaintiffs do not allege that the District was motivated to enact the Student Safety Plan to target a \nparticular religion or religion generally.  Thus, it need only be rationally related to a legitimate \ninterest in order to be deemed permissible under the Free Exercise clause.  Smith, 494 U.S. at \n897;  Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 534 (1993) (It is only \nwhen religious practices or groups are particularly targeted by a policy or law that heightened \nscrutiny applies.).   \nThe Student Safety Plan easily satisfies rational basis review.  As plaintiffs’ complaint \nnotes, the Student Safety Plan was adopted in order to support a District student and to comply \nwith the law.  See Complaint ¶ 75; see also Schwenk v. Hartford, 204 F.3d 1187, 1201-03 (9th \nCir. 2000).  Because the District’s policies were instituted for completely secular reasons, are \nneutral with respect to religion, and apply to all students, plaintiffs’ Free Exercise claim fails.    \n \n \nPAGE 16 -   DEFENDANT DALLAS SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 2’S MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n  MERSEREAU SHANNON LLP \n  111 SW COLUMBIA STREET, SUITE 1100 \n  PORTLAND, OREGON 97201-5865 \n  (503) 226-6400 \n \n\n \nF.  Motion 8:  Plaintiffs’ allegations fail to state claims under ORS 659.850 and \nORS 659A.403. \n \nPlaintiffs’ allegations do not state claims under ORS 659A.850 or ORS 659A.403 \nbecause plaintiffs allege that everyone is treated in the same manner.  ORS 659.850 prohibits \ndiscrimination “based on…religion…sex, [and] sexual orientation” in schools which receive \nstate funds.  Oregon courts have interpreted ORS 659.850’s prohibition against “discrimination” \nto mean that a school district cannot commit an act or permit someone to commit an action, that \nsubjects a student to “treatment different from that afforded other children” because of a \nprotected characteristic.  See Powell v. Bunn, 341 Or 306, 313-316, 142 P.3d 1054 (2006).  \nLikewise, ORS 659A.403 prohibits discrimination in public accommodations “on account \nof...religion, sex, [and] sexual orientation.”  ORS 659A.403(1); Klein v. Oregon Bureau of Labor \nand Industries, 289 Or. App. 507, __ P.3d __ (Dec. 28, 2017).    \nPlaintiffs fail to state a claim under these statutes for the same reasons described above \nwith respect to the Title IX claim.  Plaintiffs do not allege facts to show that they have been \ntreated differently than others on the basis of their religion, sex, or sexual orientation.  Rather, \nthey allege everyone is treated in the same manner.  Accordingly, plaintiffs fail to state a claim \nunder ORS 659.850 and 659A.403. \n/// \n/// \n/// \n \n \n \nPAGE 17 -   DEFENDANT DALLAS SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 2’S MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n  MERSEREAU SHANNON LLP \n  111 SW COLUMBIA STREET, SUITE 1100 \n  PORTLAND, OREGON 97201-5865 \n  (503) 226-6400 \n \n\n \nVII.

Sessions III move to dismiss the claims against them.  For the \nreasons set forth below, plaintiffs lack standing to bring their claims against the federal \ndefendants and have not stated any plausible claim against them.  All claims against these \ndefendants must therefore be dismissed.1 \nINTRODUCTION \nIn November 2015, Dallas School District No. 2 implemented a Student Safety Plan that \nchanged the terms on which a transgender high school student was permitted to access sex-\nsegregated facilities such as bathrooms and locker rooms.  In the months that followed, both the \nhigh school principal and the school board expressed their continuing support for the policy, \nwhich plaintiffs challenge here.  Whatever its merits, plaintiffs’ complaint is properly directed \n                                                            \n1 The undersigned counsel certifies that, in conformity with Local Civil Rule 7-1(a), the plaintiffs \nand federal defendants conferred and made a good faith effort to resolve their dispute over the \nsufficiency of the complaint, but were unable to do so. \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 49    Filed 03/15/18    Page 2 of 14\ntowards the school district that adopted the Student Safety Plan, which remains in effect to this \nday. \nBut plaintiffs2 have also sued the United States Department of Education and other \nfederal defendants, asserting that federal actions caused them injuries that this Court can redress.  \nThese allegations simply are not plausible: plaintiffs have not alleged any facts to support their \ntheory that the federal government compelled the Dallas School District to adopt its Student \nSafety Plan, nor that any relief against the federal defendants would prompt the school district to \nabandon it.  As the allegations in the complaint show, any injury that plaintiffs may have \nsuffered stems solely from the Dallas School District’s Student Safety Plan, and could only be \nredressed by relief against that school district.  The plaintiffs therefore lack standing to pursue \ntheir claims against the federal defendants.  For closely related reasons, plaintiffs have also failed \nto state any plausible claim against the federal defendants.  For these reasons, plaintiffs’ claims \nagainst the federal defendants must be dismissed. \nBACKGROUND \n  A.  Dallas School District and its Student Safety Plan \n  The Dallas School District adopted its Student Safety Plan in November 2015, allowing a \ntransgender high school student “the right to enter and use . . . locker rooms, restrooms, and \nshowers at District schools according to . . . perceived gender identity.”  Compl. ¶ 75.  The \nPrincipal of Dallas High School publicly explained this policy and, the plaintiffs allege, \n                                                            \n2 The plaintiffs are Parents Rights in Education, a nonprofit organization; Parents for Privacy, an \nassociation; Lindsay Golly, a former student at Dallas High School; Kris and Jon Golly, her \nparents and the parents of A.G., a future student at Dallas High School; and Melissa Gregory, the \nmother of T.F., a current student at Dallas High School.  Nicole Lillie is named as a plaintiff in \nthe caption, but the complaint contains no allegations about her.  Plaintiffs have agreed that all \nclaims by Lindsay Golly must be dismissed.  ECF No. 41 at 2. \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 49    Filed 03/15/18    Page 3 of 14\nthreatened to punish students who protested it.  Id. ¶¶ 87, 91–92.  The District defended the \npolicy at three separate school board meetings, from December 2015 through February 2016, \ninviting speakers that it said were “experts on gender identity issues, all of whom . . . exclusively \nsupported the Student Safety Plan.”  Id. ¶ 93.  The plaintiffs allege that the District “has, through \nvarious announcements to the students at Dallas High School and through board and community \nmeetings on gender identity . . . conveyed . . . the message that any objection to the Student \nSafety Plan . . . will be viewed by District administration as intolerance and bigotry.”  Id. ¶ 109.   \n  The plaintiffs allege that the Student Safety Plan violates students’ right to privacy, id. \n¶¶ 186–206, parents’ right to direct the education and upbringing of their children, id. ¶¶ 207–20, \nand both parents’ and students’ right to the free exercise of religion, id. ¶¶ 256–64.  They also \nallege that it violates Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, id. ¶¶ 228–47, and the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act, id. ¶¶ 248–55. \n  B.  Federal Guidance Documents and Previous Litigation \n  Plaintiffs challenge four U.S. Department of Education guidance documents discussing \ntransgender students, two of which were withdrawn before this suit was filed.  The earliest \ndocument, published in April 2014, was titled “Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual \nViolence.”  See Compl. ¶ 33 & Ex. H.  It was withdrawn in September 2017, for reasons \nunrelated to this case.3  The second document, “Questions and Answers on Title IX and Single-\nSex Elementary and Secondary Classes and Extracurricular Activities,” was published in \nDecember 2014.  See Compl. ¶ 33 & Ex. I.  The third document, the “Title IX Resource Guide,” \nwas published in April 2015.  See Compl. ¶ 33 & Ex. J.  None of these first three documents \n                                                            \n3 U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Office for Civil Rights, Dear Colleague Letter of September 22, 2017, \navailable at https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-title-ix-201709.pdf. \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 49    Filed 03/15/18    Page 4 of 14\ndiscusses sex-segregated facilities such as restrooms or locker rooms, which are the focus of the \nStudent Safety Plan adopted by the Dallas School District in November 2015, and the only \nsource of plaintiffs’ alleged harms. \nThe fourth guidance document challenged here is a Dear Colleague Letter jointly issued \nby the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice in May 2016, and jointly withdrawn by them \nby means of another Dear Colleague Letter in February 2017.  The May 2016 letter said that, \nunder Title IX, “A school may provide separate facilities on the basis of sex, but must allow \ntransgender students access to such facilities consistent with their gender identity.”  Ex. K at 3.  \nThe February 2017 letter noted that “[t]his interpretation has given rise to significant litigation \nregarding school restrooms and locker rooms,” and that “the Departments believe that, in this \ncontext, there must be due regard for the primary role of the States and local school districts in \nestablishing educational policy.”  The Departments also said that they would “not rely on the \nviews expressed within” the May 2016 letter.4  See Compl. ¶ 39. \n  The litigation to which the February 2017 letter referred included a number of suits \nmaking claims against the federal government essentially identical to the ones asserted here: that \nfederal actors had announced an interpretation of Title IX that was causing harm to plaintiffs and \ncould be challenged in federal court.  See Students & Parents for Privacy v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., \nNo. 16-cv-4945 (N.D. Ill. filed May 4, 2016); Texas v. United States, No. 7:16-cv-54 (S.D.

U.S. Dep’t of Educ., No. 16-cv-\n3015 (D. Minn. filed Sept. 7, 2016).   \nCourts decided preliminary injunction motions in some of these cases, with differing \nresults.  See Texas, 7:16-cv-54, ECF No. 58 (S.D. Tex. Aug. 21, 2016) (granting nationwide \npreliminary injunction); Highland, No. 2:16-cv-524, ECF No. 95 (S.D.

Oct. 18, 2016) (report and recommendation against preliminary injunction).   \nNo claims against federal defendants were litigated to the merits, and all such claims \nwere dismissed after the issuance of the February 2017 letter.  See Texas, 7:16-cv-54, ECF No. \n128 (S.D. Tex. Mar. 3, 2017) (voluntarily dismissing case and dissolving nationwide preliminary \ninjunction); Women’s Liberation Front, No. 16-cv-915, ECF No. 20 (D.N.M. Mar. 16, 2017) \n(voluntarily dismissing case); Privacy Matters, No. 16-cv-3015, ECF No. 83 (D. Minn. Apr. 13, \n2017) (voluntarily dismissing case); Highland, No. 2:16-cv-524, ECF No. 131 (S.D.

June 20, 2017) (voluntarily dismissing federal defendants). \nThis suit was filed in November 2017. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n  When a defendant brings a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, the plaintiff has the burden of \nestablishing subject matter jurisdiction.  See Rattlesnake Coal. v. EPA, 509 F.3d 1095, 1102 n.1 \n(9th Cir. 2007) (“Once challenged, the party asserting subject matter jurisdiction has the burden \nof proving its existence.”). “A Rule 12(b)(1) jurisdictional attack may be facial or factual.”  Safe \nAir for Everyone v. Meyer, 373 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir. 2004).  “A ‘facial’ attack accepts the \ntruth of the plaintiff’s allegations but asserts that they ‘are insufficient on their face to invoke \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 49    Filed 03/15/18    Page 6 of 14\nfederal jurisdiction.’”  Leite v. Crane Co., 749 F.3d 1117, 1121 (9th Cir. 2014) (quoting Safe Air, \n373 F.3d at 1039).  “The district court resolves a facial attack as it would a motion to dismiss \nunder Rule 12(b)(6): Accepting the plaintiff’s allegations as true and drawing all reasonable \ninferences in the plaintiff’s favor, the court determines whether the allegations are sufficient as a \nlegal matter to invoke the court’s jurisdiction.”  Id. (citing Pride v. Correa, 719 F.3d 1130, 1133 \n(9th Cir. 2013)). \n  To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must contain sufficient \nfactual matter that “state[s] a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim is plausible on its face when the factual allegations \nallow the court to infer the defendant’s liability based on the alleged conduct.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n556 U.S. 662, 663 (2009).  The factual allegations must present more than “the mere possibility \nof misconduct.”  Id. at 678.  While considering a motion to dismiss, the court must accept all \nallegations of material fact as true and construe those facts in the light most favorable to the non-\nmovant.  Burgert v. Lokelani Bernice Pauahi Bishop Trust, 200 F.3d 661, 663 (9th Cir. 2000). \nHowever, the court is “not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual \nallegation.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. \nARGUMENT \n  Article III of the Constitution limits federal courts to adjudicating “actual cases and \ncontroversies.”  Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 750 (1984), abrogated on other grounds by \nLexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 1377 (2014).  Federal courts \ntherefore have “neither the power to render advisory opinions nor to decide questions that cannot \naffect the rights of litigants in the case before them,” and must resolve only “real and substantive \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 49    Filed 03/15/18    Page 7 of 14\ncontrovers[ies] admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character.”  Preister \nv. Newkirk, 422 U.S. 395, 401 (1975). \nOne aspect of this case-or-controversy limitation is the requirement of standing.  To \nestablish standing, plaintiffs (1) must have suffered an injury-in-fact, i.e., a judicially cognizable \ninjury that is “concrete and particularized” and “actual or imminent, not conjectural or \nhypothetical;” (2) the injury must be “fairly … trace[able] to the challenged action of the \ndefendant;” and (3) “it must be likely, as opposed to speculative, that the injury will be redressed \nby a favorable decision.”  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992) (internal \nquotation omitted, alterations in original). \nPlaintiffs claim that they are injured by the Dallas School District’s policy regarding \naccess to sex-segregated facilities for a transgender student, and that these injuries are “a direct \nresult of” the federal defendants’ interpretation of Title IX in the challenged guidance documents \n“which,” they say, “in turn forms the justification for the Student Safety Plan” adopted by the \nDallas School District.  Compl. ¶ 48.  But their complaint does not plausibly allege that the \nschool district’s adoption of the Student Safety Plan was caused by the federal guidance \ndocuments challenged here, nor that any decision against the federal defendants would lead the \nschool district to withdraw the Student Safety Plan.  Because plaintiffs’ alleged injuries are not \nfairly traceable to the challenged federal actions, nor likely to be redressed by any relief the \nCourt could award against federal actors, plaintiffs lack standing to pursue their claims against \nthe federal defendants.  And those claims cannot survive review under Rule 12(b)(6).  All claims \nagainst the federal defendants must therefore be dismissed. \n \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 49    Filed 03/15/18    Page 8 of 14\nA.  The injuries alleged by plaintiffs are not fairly traceable to federal actions. \nAny injuries that plaintiffs may be suffering could be caused only by the Dallas School \nDistrict and its Student Safety Plan.  Four of the five claims against the federal defendants \ndiscuss only the Student Safety Plan, and do not mention any federal actions.  See Compl. \n¶¶ 202–06 (Student Safety Plan violates students’ right to privacy); id. ¶¶ 216–20 (Student \nSafety Plan violates parents’ right to direct the education and upbringing of their children); id. \n¶¶ 251–55 (Student Safety Plan violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act); id. ¶¶ 258–64 \n(Student Safety Plan violates both parents’ and students’ right to the free exercise of religion).  \nThe remaining claim, for violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, nonsensically suggests \nthat the interpretation of Title IX announced in the May 2016 letter was the root cause of the \nStudent Safety Plan adopted in November 2015.  Id. ¶¶ 141, 143. \nRead as a whole, plaintiffs’ complaint appears to assert that the federal government \nsomehow compelled the Dallas School District to adopt its Student Safety Plan, either by \ninvestigating an Illinois school district that had not implemented a similar policy, see id. ¶¶ 64–\n67, or by issuing the guidance documents discussed above.  Id. ¶ 40 (alleging that the school \ndistrict “adopted and implemented the . . . Student Safety Plan” in “response to the foregoing \nFederal Guidelines and enforcement”); id. ¶ 75 (“In response to the threat of [federal] \nenforcement action [the school district] developed and implemented the Student Safety \nPlan . . . .”). \nBut on the facts set out in their complaint, plaintiffs’ alleged injuries are not “fairly \ntraceable” to the challenged guidance documents.  The immediate source of those asserted \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 49    Filed 03/15/18    Page 9 of 14\ninjuries is the presence of a particular transgender student in certain sex-segregated facilities5—\nwhich can, in turn, be traced to the Student Safety Plan granting access to those facilities.  That \nPlan was adopted six months before one of the challenged guidance documents—the May 2016 \nletter—was issued, and well after the others (which do not discuss sex-segregated facilities) were \npublished.  It is not plausible to allege, as plaintiffs do here, that the adoption of the Student \nSafety Plan can be fairly traced either to guidance documents that do not discuss restrooms or \nlocker rooms, or to a document issued long after the Plan was adopted. \nNor do the investigations of other school districts support plaintiffs’ theory of standing.  \nBecause those investigations are not being (and could not be) challenged here, they are not the \n“challenged action of the defendant” to which any injury must be traced.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.  \nAnd in any event, it simply is not plausible that a letter of findings issued to an Illinois school \ndistrict on November 2, 2015, Compl. ¶ 65, prompted the adoption of the Student Safety Plan in \nDallas, Oregon less than two weeks later, see id. ¶ 75.  The complaint notes that a transgender \nstudent at Dallas High School requested permission to use certain sex-segregated facilities in \nSeptember 2015, id. ¶ 78, and the Student Safety Plan simply grants that student’s request.  The \nstudent’s request two months before, and not a letter of finding issued to a far-away school \ndistrict mere days before, was plainly the impetus for the Dallas School District’s adoption of its \nStudent Safety Plan. \n“[W]hen a plaintiff alleges that government action caused injury by influencing the \nconduct of third parties,” as plaintiffs allege that the federal defendants injured them by \ninfluencing the Dallas School District to adopt its Student Safety Plan, the Ninth Circuit has \n                                                            \n5 The injuries asserted by the students, parents, organization, and association that bring this case \nall stem from the presence of this transgender student in certain sex-segregated facilities in \nDallas High School.  The Secretary therefore analyzes their injuries together. \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 49    Filed 03/15/18    Page 10 of 14\n“held that ‘more particular facts are needed to show standing.’” Mendia v. Garcia, 768 F.3d \n1009, 1013 (9th Cir. 2014) (quoting Nat’l Audubon Soc’y v. Davis, 307 F.3d 835, 849 (9th Cir. \n2002)).  This is “because the third parties may well have engaged in their injury-inflicting actions \neven in the absence of the government’s challenged conduct.”  Id.  “To plausibly allege that the \ninjury was ‘not the result of the independent action of some third party,’” id. (quoting Bennett v. \nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 167 (1997) (emphasis in Mendia)), “the plaintiff must offer facts showing \nthat the government’s unlawful conduct ‘is at least a substantial factor motivating the third \nparties’ actions.’”  Id. (quoting Tozzi v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 271 F.3d 301, 308 \n(D.C. Cir. 2001)).  Plaintiffs must “make that showing without relying on ‘speculation’ or \n‘guesswork’ about the third parties’ motivations,” if they are to “adequately allege[] Article III \ncausation.”  Id. (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l, 568 U.S. 398, 413–14 (2013)). \n  But plaintiffs have offered nothing but speculation and guesswork about the motivations \nof the Dallas School District in adopting its Student Safety Plan.  They say that the challenged \nguidance documents or investigations in other school districts impelled the Dallas School District \nto take the action that caused their asserted harms, but they have offered no factual allegations to \nshow that this is so.  Any harms that plaintiffs are suffering here are the direct result of the \nStudent Safety Plan and, on the facts alleged, are not “fairly traceable” to any challenged federal \naction.  Monsanto Co. v. Geerston Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 149 (2010).  All claims against the \nfederal defendants must therefore be dismissed. \nB.  Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries could not be redressed by any relief against federal \nactors. \n \nFor similar reasons, plaintiffs’ asserted injuries would not be “redressable by a favorable \nruling” against the federal defendants.  Id.  Even if this Court were to vacate the challenged \nguidance documents, that remedy would not affect the Student Safety Plan, and so would not \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 49    Filed 03/15/18    Page 11 of 14\nredress plaintiffs’ alleged injuries.  As discussed above, the challenged policy was independently \nadopted by Dallas School District.  An order declaring the federal guidance documents invalid \nwould not force the District to alter its policy, as plaintiffs’ allegations demonstrate.  Two of the \nchallenged guidance documents, including the May 2016 letter (which contains the only \ndiscussion of sex-segregated facilities), were withdrawn before the complaint was filed.6  See \nCompl. ¶ 39.  As the plaintiffs observe, “[d]espite” the withdrawal of those documents, Dallas \nSchool District “has not changed its policies.”  Id. ¶ 75.  There is no reason to think that a ruling \nagainst the federal defendants would make it any likelier that the school district would change \nthe challenged Plan. \nTo the contrary, it is apparent from the allegations in the complaint that Dallas School \nDistrict adopted and maintains its Student Safety Plan not due to compulsion by the federal \ndefendants but because the school district regards the Plan as the best policy for its high school.  \nPlaintiffs allege that the Principal of Dallas High School threatened to punish students who \nprotested the Student Safety Plan, id. ¶¶ 87, 91–92; that the school district defended the policy at \nthree separate school board meetings, from December 2015 through February 2016, inviting \nspeakers that it said were “experts on gender identity issues, all of whom . . . exclusively \nsupported the Student Safety Plan,” id. ¶ 93; and that the District “has, through various \nannouncements to the students at Dallas High School and through board and community \nmeetings on gender identity . . . conveyed . . . the message that any objection to the Student \nSafety Plan . . . will be viewed by District administration as intolerance and bigotry.”  Id. ¶ 109.   \n                                                            \n6 If these two guidance documents had been in effect at the beginning of this litigation (which \nthey were not) any challenge against them would have been rendered moot by their withdrawal.  \nSee Nevada v. United States, 699 F.2d 486, 487 (9th Cir. 1983) (discussing “the general rule that \nwhen actions complained of have been completed or terminated, declaratory judgment and \ninjunctive actions are precluded by the doctrine of mootness”). \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 49    Filed 03/15/18    Page 12 of 14\nBased on these allegations, it is not likely that the school district would abandon the \nStudent Safety Plan merely because this Court declared federal guidance documents to be \ninvalid.  To the contrary, in moving to dismiss this case, the Dallas School District suggested that \nits Plan was an “inclusive polic[y],” and that plaintiffs’ preferred policy “would discriminate \nagainst some of the District’s students.”  ECF No. 31 at 1.  Those are not the words of a school \ndistrict being compelled to act against its better judgment. \nC.  Plaintiffs have not stated a claim against the federal defendants. \nEach of plaintiffs’ claims against the federal defendants derives from the proposition that \nthese defendants have promulgated and still maintain a “Rule” prescribing the way in which \ntransgender students must be allowed to access sex-segregated facilities in schools that accept \nfederal funds.  Plaintiffs allege that the federal defendants “created and promulgated this new \nlegislative rule . . . through a series of Federal Guidelines that were sent to school districts \nbetween April 2014 and May 2016.”  Compl. ¶ 33.  Plaintiffs identify four such guidance \ndocuments: “Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence,” published April 2014; \n“Questions and Answers on Title IX and Single-Sex Elementary and Secondary Classes and \nExtracurricular Activities,” published December 2014; “Title IX Resource Guide,” published \nApril 2015; and a Dear Colleague Letter issued May 2016.  See Compl. ¶ 33 & Exs. H–K.   \nThe first three guidance documents do not contain any discussion of access to sex-\nsegregated facilities by transgender students.  The May 2016 letter, which does discuss this \nsubject, was rescinded in February 2017, in a separate Dear Colleague Letter in which the U.S. \nDepartments of Education and Justice said that they would “not rely on the views expressed \nwithin” the May 2016 letter.  February 2017 Letter at 1; see Compl. ¶ 39.  Plaintiffs allege that \n“[n]otwithstanding” the February 2017 letter, the views contained within the May 2016 letter are \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 49    Filed 03/15/18    Page 13 of 14\nbeing treated by federal defendants as a “Rule [that] has not been formally repealed” but rather \n“has continuing legal force and effect binding” Dallas School District.  Compl. ¶ 39. \nThe complaint, however, is devoid of any factual allegation to support this legal \nconclusion.  Indeed, the complaint contains no allegations of any actions  by the federal \ndefendants after the February 2017 letter was issued, much less any actions that would cast doubt \non their clear statement “that the Department of Justice and the Department of Education are \nwithdrawing the statements of policy and guidance reflected in” the May 2016 letter.  February \n2017 Letter at 1.  The allegations in plaintiffs’ complaint therefore do not render it “plausible,” \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 570, that the “Rule” to which they object was operative at the time they \nfiled their complaint.  Because all of their claims against the federal defendants depend on the \nexistence of this Rule (which is speculative at best) plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged any \nclaim against the federal defendants.  Those claims must therefore be dismissed for failure to \nstate a claim for which relief can be granted. \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs are not suffering any harms that were caused by federal actions, nor any that \ncould be redressed by relief against federal actors.  They therefore lack standing to pursue their \nclaims against the federal defendants.  And they have not plausibly alleged those claims.  All \nclaims against the federal defendants must be dismissed. \n  Respectfully submitted,         \nCHAD A. READLER \n              Acting Assistant Attorney General \n \n              BILLY J.

Introduction\nThis case,brought onbehalfofvarious students andparents, challenges theDallas\nSchool District’s actions andpolicies, datingback to2015,1 ofallowingtransgenderstudents to\nusethebathroom andlockerrooms that matchtheirgenderidentity,andthe various Federal and\nStatepolicies orguidancethat support thoseactions. Put anotherway,Plaintiffs inthis case\nattacktheDallas School District for,insimplest terms, respectingandtreatingatransgenderboy\nlikeanyotherboy. Theyfurtherchallengethe District,StateandFederal Defendants’policies\nandwritten guidancethat support suchequal treatment oftransgenderstudents generally. As\npart ofthis challenge,Plaintiffs raiseawide arrayofclaims against thevarious defendants, but\nagainst theOregon Department ofEducation(“ODE”)and Oregon GovernorKate Brown\n(collectively,“StateDefendants”or“theState”),theyraisejust oneclaim: assertingthat State\nDefendants have “aided andabetted”inaviolationofOregonlaw,specificallytheState’s\nprohibitionondiscriminationinplaceofpublicaccommodation. SeeCompl.¶¶265-71.\nTheStatewholeheartedlysupports theDallas School District inrecognizingandtreating\ntransgenderstudents consistent withtheirgenderidentity,and consistent withprinciples of\nequality. Plaintiffs clearlyhaveadifferent viewthantheStateregardingwhat state(andindeed\nfederal)law requires inthis area. CompareCompl.,withCompl.Ex.M-1(OregonDepartment\nofEducationGuidancetoSchool Districts: CreatingaSafeandSupportive School Environment\nforTransgenderStudents). It is also clearthat plaintiffs disagree withtheStateregardingwhat\nconstitutes best practices forcreatinganeducational environment safeandfreefrom\ndiscriminationandharassment,andhowbest toensurethat everystudent – includingtransgender\nstudents –has equal access toeducational programs andactivities. These areimportant policy\nandlegal disagreements that should,inanappropriatevenue,beaddressed andresolved.

As far as factual allegations regardingthe\nState’s allegeddiscriminatoryactions, theComplaint points out that “Onorabout May5,2016\nODEissuedits ‘GuidancetoSchool Districts: CreatingaSafeandSupportiveSchool\nEnvironment forTransgenderStudents.’” Compl.¶24(hereinafter“ODETransgender\nGuidance”).\nTheODEtransgender guidance,a copyofwhichis attachedtothecomplaint,affirms the\nState’s policyandlegal positionthat “[o]ne’s genderidentityis aninnatecharacteristicofeach\nindividual’s personality” that must berespected.

Argument\nIntheirloneclaim against StateDefendants, Plaintiffs ask this Court todeclarethat the\nOregonDepartment ofEducationandtheOregon Governor actinginherofficial capacityhave\nviolatedstatelaw,andto potentiallyawardadditional injunctiverelief. This claim is barredby\ntheState’s Sovereign Immunity,sometimes referredtoas EleventhAmendment Immunity,2 and\ntheStateshouldbedismissedas adefendant.\nAs asovereigninour constitutional system,anunconsentingstateandits departments are\nabsolutelyimmunefrom suit infederal court,regardless ofthereliefsought. Pennhurst State\nSch. &Hosp. v.Halderman,465U.S.89,100(1984).3 TheOregon Department ofEducationis\n2 As theNinthCircuit has explained,“Courts have often‘referredtotheStates'immunityfrom\nsuit as “EleventhAmendment immunity.” Thephraseis convenient shorthandbut somethingof\namisnomer,forthesovereignimmunityoftheStates neitherderives from noris limitedbythe\nterms oftheEleventhAmendment.’” Stanley v.

Pennhurst,465U.S.at 101(internal quotationmarks andcitationomitted). The\nClaim against Governor Brownis thus barredas well.\nTheso-called “Exparte Young”exceptiondoes not saveplaintiff’s claim against\nGovernor Brown. The“ExparteYoung”exceptionis awell-recognized–but limited–\nexceptiontothis general rulebarringofficial capacitysuits against stateofficials. Id.at 102\n(citingExparteYoung,209U.S.123(1908)). Underthis exception,astate official maybesued\ninfederal court inherofficial capacityiftherelief sought is “prospectiveinjunctivereliefto\nprevent a continuingviolationoffederal law.” Greenv.Mansour,474 U.S.64,68(1985)\n(emphasis added). This exceptionis premisedonthepropositionthat federal court authorityto\nenjoin“continuingviolationoffederal law[is] necessarytovindicatethefederal interest in\nassuringthesupremacyofthat law.” Id. Here,however,theonlythingplaintiffs ask thefederal\ncourt todowithrespect toGovernor Brownis tofindandenjoinanalleged violationofstate\nlaw.

Conclusion\nAs theforegoingdemonstrates, thesingleclaim against theStateDefendants is barredby\ntheState’s sovereignimmunity, andfails as amatteroflaw.

Definitions \n  As a preliminary matter, the Court finds it necessary to explain its use of several relevant \nterms. In a recent decision, the Third Circuit aptly summarized the same set of terms the Court \nuses throughout this Opinion & Order. See Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., No. 17-3113, 2018 \nWL 3016864, at *1 (3d Cir. June 18, 2018). The Court adopts the following definitions from the \nThird Circuit: \n“Sex” is defined as the “anatomical and physiological processes \nthat lead to or denote male or female.” Typically, sex is determined \nat birth based on the appearance of external genitalia. \n \n“Gender” is a “broader societal construct” that encompasses how a \n“society defines what male or female is within a certain cultural \ncontext.” A person’s gender identity is their subjective, deep-core \nsense of self as being a particular gender. . . . “[C]isgender” refers \nto a person who identifies with the sex that person was determined \nto have at birth. The term “transgender” refers to a person whose \ngender  identity  does  not  align  with  the  sex  that  person  was \ndetermined  to  have  at  birth.  A  transgender  boy  is  therefore  a \nperson who has a lasting, persistent male gender identity, though \nthat  person’s  sex  was  determined  to  be  female  at  birth.  A \ntransgender girl is a person who has a lasting, persistent female \ngender identity though that person’s sex was determined to be male \nat birth. \n \n                                                           \n3 The facts recited below are taken from Plaintiffs’ complaint and exhibits attached thereto. The Court assumes that \nthe Complaint’s factual allegations are true unless they are contradicted by the Complaint’s exhibits. See Warren v. \nFox Family Worldwide, Inc., 328 F.3d 1136, 1139 (9th Cir. 2003) (“[W]e are not required to accept as true \nconclusory allegations which are contradicted by documents referred to in the complaint, and we do not necessarily \nassume the truth of legal conclusions merely because they are cast in the form of factual allegations.”) (internal \nquotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted). \nOPINION & ORDER - 6 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 7 of 56\nId. (citations omitted). \nII.  Dallas School District and the Student Safety Plan \nDallas High School is located in Dallas, Oregon in Polk County. Compl. ¶ 19. Student A \nwas a twelfth grade student at Dallas High School. Id. at ¶ 76. Student A was born and remains \nbiologically female. Id. at ¶ 77. Before September 2015, Student A used the girls’ restrooms, \nlocker rooms, and showers (collectively “facilities”). Id. at ¶ 77. In September 2015, Student A \npublicly identified as a boy and asked District to allow him4 to use the boys’ facilities. Id. at \n¶ 78–79.  \n  In November 2015, District responded to Student A’s request by implementing the \nStudent Safety Plan entitled “Transgender Student Access to Locker Room.” Compl. Ex. A, at 1. \nThe Plan permits Student A to use Dallas High School’s locker rooms, restrooms, and showers \nconsistent with his gender identity. Compl. ¶ 75, Ex. A, at 1. The preamble to the Plan states:  \nAll students have rights for attendance at public schools, and we \nhave to follow the laws which protect those students[’] rights. This \nsafety  plan  has  been  created  to  support  a  transgender  male \nexpressing the right to access the boy’s locker room at Dallas High \nSchool. Following are targeted areas of concern and the procedures \nor actions aimed to support all students in this transition. \n \nCompl. Ex. A, at 1. At that time, Student A had not expressed which bathroom he felt \ncomfortable using. Id. at ¶ 79. Accordingly, the Plan states that Student A “can use any of the \nbathrooms in the building to which he identifies sexually.” Compl. Ex. A, at 2. \n  Furthermore, the Plan, as referred to by the parties, also encompasses several previously \nestablished District policies. Compl. Exs. B–G. District’s nondiscrimination policy provides that \nDistrict “prohibits discrimination and harassment on any basis protected by law, including . . . an \n                                                           \n4 Following Ninth Circuit decisions involving transgender people, the Court uses the masculine rather than feminine \npronouns when referring to Student A. See Schwenk v. Hartford, 204 F.3d 1187, 1192 n.1 (9th Cir. 2000). In other \nwords, when referring to a transgender person, the Court uses the pronoun consistent with that person’s gender \nidentity. \nOPINION & ORDER - 7 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 8 of 56\nindividual[’]s perceived or actual . . . sex” or “sexual orientation.” Compl. Ex. B, at 1. Sexual \norientation under the policy “means an individual’s actual or perceived . . . gender identity, \nregardless of whether the individual’s gender identity, appearance, expression or behavior differs \nfrom that traditionally associated with the individual’s sex at birth.” Id. Likewise, District has a \npolicy entitled “Equal Education Opportunity” providing that “[e]very student of the district will \nbe given equal educational opportunities regardless of . . . sex” or “sexual orientation.” Compl. \nEx. C. The policy explains: \nFurther, no student will be excluded from participating in, denied \nthe  benefits  of,  or  subjected  to  discrimination  under  any \neducational  program  or  activity  conducted  by  the  district.  The \ndistrict will treat its students without discrimination on the basis of \nsex  as  this  pertains  to  course  offerings,  athletics,  counseling, \nemployment assistance and extracurricular activities.  \n \nId. \nIn accordance with the Plan, Student A used the boys’ locker rooms, showers, and \nrestrooms at Dallas High school. Compl. ¶ 79. Other male students, including Student Plaintiffs, \nhave used school facilities at the same time as Student A. Id. at ¶ 79. Specifically, Student A has \nused the boys’ locker room and showers and has changed clothes while male students were \npresent. Id. at ¶ 82. Plaintiffs allege that male students at Dallas High school experience \n“embarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, intimidation, fear, apprehension, and stress produced by \nusing the restroom with students of the opposite sex[.]”Id. at ¶ 83. The alleged risks posed to \nthose students persist despite the presence of privacy stalls in the bathrooms because “there are \nlarge gaps above and below the stall doors, and gaps along the sides of the doors” through which \n“another student could see through even inadvertently.” Id. Therefore, Plaintiffs maintain that \nStudent Plaintiffs “must risk exposing themselves to the opposite sex every time they use the \nrestroom.” Id. at ¶ 83. Consequently, Student Plaintiffs and other students use the restroom as \nOPINION & ORDER - 8 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 9 of 56\nlittle as possible and “risk tardiness by hurrying to distant facilities of the school, during short 5-\nminute passing periods, to try and find a restroom not likely to be used by a student of the \nopposite biological sex.” Id. at ¶ 85. \nStudent and Parent Plaintiffs expressed their concerns about the Plan to Dallas High \nSchool’s principal who informed them that all facilities may be used by any student regardless of \nbiological sex. Id. at ¶ 87. The principal also told Parent Plaintiffs that their students could use \nthe unisex staff lounge which has no shower. Id. at ¶ 91. Dallas School Board meetings were \nheld on December 14, 2015, January 19, 2016, and February 11, 2016. Id. at ¶ 93. At those \nmeetings, District supported the Plan over Plaintiffs’ objections and those of other parents and \nstudents. Id.5  \nII.  Federal Defendants’ Administrative Actions \n  Plaintiffs allege that Federal Defendants have exercised their authority to promulgate, \nadminister, and enforce a new legislative rule redefining “sex” within the meaning of Title IX to \ninclude gender identity and prohibiting school districts from providing sex-specific facilities. Id. \nat ¶¶ 26–30, 32–39, 49–73. Federal Defendants’ new legislative rule (“Rule”) as alleged in the \nComplaint is composed of a series of Federal Guidelines promulgated between April 2014 and \nMay 2016, including: \n-  USDOE, Office for Civil Rights, Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence \n(Apr. 2014). Compl. Ex. H [hereinafter “Q&A on Sexual Violence”]. \n \n                                                           \n5 Plaintiffs also challenge another action taken by District related to La Creole Middle School. Compl. ¶ 96. In \nFebruary 2017, District administered a “Needs Assessment” to La Creole Middle School students without prior \nnotice, knowledge, or consent of the students’ parents. Compl. Ex. P. The Needs Assessment asked students to \ndisclose information about problems or issues they were experiencing involving clothing, school supplies, family \nfood sufficiency, alcohol or drug abuse, suicide, self-image, sexual orientation and gender identity, unhealthy \nrelationships and other subjects of a personal or family nature. Compl. ¶ 96.

Ex. \nH at 12. That guidance was withdrawn in September 2017, before this lawsuit was filed. See U.S. \nDep’t of Educ., Office for Civil Rights, Dear Colleague Letter (Sept. 22, 2017), \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201702-title-ix.pdf.  \nSecond, in December 2014, USDOE published the Q&A on Single-Sex Classes, \nproviding that: \nAll students, including transgender students and students who do \nnot  conform  to  sex  stereotypes  are  protected  from  sex-based \ndiscrimination under Title IX. Under Title IX, a recipient generally \nmust  treat  transgender  students  consistent  with  their  gender \nidentity  in  all  aspects  of  planning,  implementation,  enrollment, \noperation, and evaluation of single-sex classes. \n \nCompl. Ex. I, at 30.  \n  Third, in April 2015, USDOE published the Title IX Resource Guide which reiterates \nthat Title IX’s prohibition of sex discrimination includes gender identity. Compl. Ex. J, at 5.  \nSpecifically, the prohibition extends to claims of discrimination based on gender identity or \nfailure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity. Id. at 5–6. “Similarly, \nthe actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity of the parties does not change a \nrecipient’s obligations.” Id. at 21.  \nOPINION & ORDER - 10 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 11 of 56\n  The fourth challenged document is the May 2016 Dear Colleague Letter jointly issued by \nthe USDOJ and USDOE. Compl. Ex. K. The May 2016 Dear Colleague Letter repeated that Title \nIX’s sex-discrimination prohibition “encompasses discrimination based on a student’s gender \nidentity, including discrimination based on a student’s transgender status.” Id. at 2. Federal \nDefendants characterized this letter as “significant guidance” that “does not add requirements to \napplicable law, but provides information and examples to inform recipients about how the \nDepartments evaluate whether covered entities are complying with their legal obligations.” Id. at \n2. Most importantly, this document provides specific guidance on transgender students’ access to \nsex-segregated activities and facilities: \n3.  Sex-Segregated Activities and Facilities \n \nTitle  IX's  implementing  regulations  permit  a  school  to \nprovide  sex-segregated  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  shower \nfacilities, housing, and athletic teams, as well as single-sex \nclasses  under  certain  circumstances.  When  a  school \nprovides  sex-segregated  activities  and  facilities, \ntransgender students must be allowed to participate in such \nactivities and access  such facilities consistent with  their \ngender identity. \n \nRestrooms and Locker Rooms. A school  may  provide \nseparate  facilities  on  the  basis  of  sex,  but  must  allow \ntransgender  students  access  to  such  facilities  consistent \nwith  their  gender  identity.  A  school  may  not  require \ntransgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their \ngender  identity  or  to  use  individual-user  facilities  when \nother students are not required to do so. A school may, \nhowever,  make  individual-user  options  available  to  all \nstudents who voluntarily seek additional privacy. \n \nAthletics. Title IX regulations permit a school to operate or \nsponsor sex-segregated athletics teams when selection for \nsuch teams is based upon competitive skill or when the \nactivity  involved  is  a  contact  sport.  A  school  may  not, \nhowever,  adopt  or  adhere  to  requirements  that  rely  on \noverly  broad  generalizations  or  stereotypes  about  the \ndifferences between transgender students and other students \nOPINION & ORDER - 11 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 12 of 56\nof the same sex (i.e., the same gender identity) or others’ \ndiscomfort  with  transgender  students.  Title  IX  does  not \nprohibit  age-appropriate,  tailored  requirements  based  on \nsound,  current,  and  research-based  medical  knowledge \nabout  the  impact  of  the  students’  participation  on  the \ncompetitive fairness or physical safety of the sport. \n \nId. at 4.  \n  On February 22, 2017, the USDOJ and USDOE published a second dear colleague letter \nwithdrawing the guidance provided in their May 2016 Dear Colleague Letter. See U.S. Dep’ts of \nEduc. & Justice, Dear Colleague Letter (Feb. 22, 2017), \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201702-title-ix.pdf [hereinafter \n“February 2017 Dear Colleague Letter”]. The February 2017 Dear Colleague Letter began: “The \npurpose of this guidance is to inform you that the Department of Justice and the Department of \nEducation are withdrawing the statements of policy and guidance reflected” in the May 2016 \nDear Colleague Letter. Id. The letter explained that prior guidance’s interpretation of “on the \nbasis of sex” in Title IX to include gender identity has “given rise to significant litigation \nregarding school restrooms and locker rooms.” Id.  \nThe February 2017 Dear Colleague Letter did not state that the prior guidance was \nunlawful, nor did Federal Defendants replace the prior guidance with new guidance. Rather, the \nletter stated that, in light of litigation on the issue producing differing results, “there must be due \nregard for the primary role of the States and local school districts in establishing education \npolicy.” Id. “In these circumstances, the [USDOE and USDOJ] have decided to withdraw and \nrescind the above-reference guidance documents in order to further and more completely \nconsider the legal issues involved. The Departments thus will not rely on the views expressed \nwithin them.” Id.; see also Compl. Ex. N (USDOE instructions to field offices stating that in \nlight of the February 2017 Dear Colleague Letter and other litigation developments, the USDOE \nOPINION & ORDER - 12 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 13 of 56\nshould not rely on the May 2016 Dear Colleague letter when analyzing Title IX discrimination \nclaims).  \nSTANDARDS \nOn a motion to dismiss, the court must review the sufficiency of the complaint. Scheuer \nv. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236 (1974). A complaint is construed in favor of the plaintiff, and its \nfactual allegations are taken as true. Daniels–Hall v. Nat’l Educ. Ass’n, 629 F.3d 992, 998 (9th \nCir. 2010). “[F]or a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss, the non-conclusory factual content, \nand reasonable inferences from that content, must be plausibly suggestive of a claim entitling the \nplaintiff to relief.” Moss v. United States Secret Serv., 572 F.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir. 2009) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual \ncontent that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the \nmisconduct alleged.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). “[O]nce a claim has been \nstated adequately, it may be supported by showing any set of facts consistent with the allegations \nin the complaint.” Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 563 (2007). The court, \nhowever, need “not assume the truth of legal conclusions merely because they are cast in the \nform of factual allegations.” Id. “[A] plaintiff’s obligation to provide the ‘grounds’ of his \n‘entitle[ment] to relief’ requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of \nthe elements of a cause of action will not do . . . .” Id. at 555. \nDISCUSSION \n  As outlined above, Plaintiffs allege eight claims for relief which the Court has grouped \ntogether as follows: (I) APA; (II) the right to privacy; (III) Title IX; (IV) Oregon state law; (V) \nparents’ rights to direct the education and upbringing of their children; and (VI) First \nAmendment and RFRA. The Court will discuss each topic in turn. \nOPINION & ORDER - 13 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 14 of 56\nI.  APA \n  Plaintiffs’ first claim for relief alleges that Federal Defendants violated by the APA \nthrough promulgating and enforcing “a new legislative rule that redefines the term ‘sex’ in Title \nIX and its accompanying regulations to mean, or at least include, ‘gender identity.’” Compl. \n¶ 137. They argue that the May 2016 Dear Colleague Letter demonstrates that Federal \nDefendants will investigate and enforce Title IX against school districts that do not permit \ntransgender students to use restrooms, locker rooms and showers consistent with their gender \nidentity. Id. at ¶¶ 140–41. Plaintiffs contend that Federal Defendants’ administrative actions are \nin excess of legal authority, arbitrary and capricious, contrary to the U.S. Constitution, and done \nwithout observance of required administrative procedures. Id. at ¶ 145 (citing 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A)–(D)).  \n  In response, Federal Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs’ APA claim on the ground \nthat Plaintiffs lack standing. Two of the four guidance documents that comprise the challenged \nRule were withdrawn before this lawsuit commenced. Federal Defendants claim that Plaintiffs \ncannot show that they suffered any injury as a result of the Rule or that Plaintiffs’ alleged \ninjuries would be redressed by the relief that they seek from Federal Defendants. The May 2016 \nDear Colleague Letter—the only guidance specifically addressing transgender students’ use of \nschool facilities—was expressly withdrawn by the February 2017 Dear Colleague Letter. Federal \nDefendants point to District’s Plan as the sole source of Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries. In other \nwords, withdrawal of Federal Defendants’ Rule would neither compel District to rescind its Plan \nnor require students at Dallas High School to use facilities matching their biological sex. \n  To have Article III standing, a plaintiff must show that, (1) it suffered an “injury in fact,” \n(2) arising out of the defendant’s conduct, and (3) “it must be ‘likely,’ as opposed to \nOPINION & ORDER - 14 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 15 of 56\n‘speculative,’ that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.” Lujan v. Defs. of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992) (citations omitted). \nA.  Injury \n  Plaintiffs allege that they have “suffered a legal wrong as a direct result of USDOE’s \nactions, because Plaintiffs’ constitutional and statutory rights were and continue to be violated by \nthe Student Safety Plan, which is the direct result of USDOE’s enforcement of its new rule.” \nCompl. ¶ 144. Federal Defendants do not challenge the injury requirement for standing. Instead, \nthey argue that the alleged injury is solely attributable to District’s Plan and that Plaintiffs are \nunable to establish either causation or redressability. As discussed below, however, the Court \nfinds that Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged their remaining claims based on District’s Plan. \nAccordingly, because those dismissed claims form the basis for Plaintiff’s alleged injury, \nPlaintiffs’ APA claim falls with them. The Court will nevertheless determine whether Plaintiffs \nhave satisfied the remaining elements of standing. \nB.  Causation \n  Assuming that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged an injury-in-fact, Federal Defendants \nargue that Plaintiffs’ injuries are not fairly traceable to the challenged administrative actions. \nFederal Defendants point out that four of the five claims that Plaintiffs allege against them do not \nmention any federal action. See Fed. Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss 8, ECF 49. Plaintiffs’ second, third, \nfifth, and sixth claims for relief only allege actions taken by District. Plaintiffs’ sole causal \nconnection lies in Federal Defendants’ alleged influence on District’s decision to enact and \nenforce the Plan. Particularly, Plaintiffs allege that Federal Defendants’ enforcement of Title IX \nagainst other school districts based on the Rule caused District to enact the Plan.  \nOPINION & ORDER - 15 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 16 of 56\n  Causation requires showing that an injury is “fairly traceable to the challenged action of \nthe defendant, and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the \ncourt.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 167 (1997). An indirect injury, however, “does not in \nitself preclude standing.” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 504 (1975). “Causation may be found \neven if there are multiple links in the chain connecting the defendant’s unlawful conduct to the \nplaintiff’s injury, and there’s no requirement that the defendant’s conduct comprise the last link \nin the chain.” Mendia v. Garcia, 768 F.3d 1009, 1012 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing Bennett, 520 U.S. at \n167). “[W]hat matters in not the ‘length of the chain of causation,’ but rather the ‘plausibility of \nthe links that comprise the chain[.]’” Nat’l Audubon Soc’y, Inc. v. Davis, 307 F.3d 835, 849 (9th \nCir. 2002) (quoting Autolog Corp. v. Regan, 731 F.2d 25, 31 (D.C. Cir. 1984)). \n  District’s Plan was enacted in November 2015. At that time, of the four challenged \nguidance documents comprising the Rule, the Q&A on Sexual Violence, the Q&A on Single-Sex \nActivities, and the Title IX Resource Guide were in effect. All three of those documents state \nthat USDOE interprets Title IX as prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender identity. \nNone of those documents, however, state that Title IX requires school districts to permit \ntransgender students to use school facilities consistent with their gender-identity. Only the May \n2016 Dear Colleague Letter—issued six months after the Plan was made effective—requires \nschool districts to take such action. Compl. Ex. K, at 4. Plaintiffs allege that Federal Defendants \n“have enforced the Rule through public investigations, findings, and threats to revoke millions of \ndollars in federal funding from several school districts because they provided sex-specific private \nfacilities.” Compl. ¶ 63. In particular, Plaintiffs point to USDOE’s actions against Township \nHigh School District 211 (“District 211”) in Palantine, Illinois. Id. at ¶ 64. There, in November \n2015, USDOE issued a letter stating that District 211 violated Title IX by not allowing a \nOPINION & ORDER - 16 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 17 of 56\ntransgender female to use the girls’ locker room. Id. at ¶¶ 65–66. District 211 and USDOE \nentered into an agreement allowing transgender student access to the disputed facilities. Compl. \n¶ 67, Ex. M. Likewise, the USDOJ filed a lawsuit in May 2016 against North Carolina based on \nthe University of North Carolina’s enforcement of sex-specific private facilities. Compl. ¶¶ 69–\n71. \n  In response to Federal Defendants’ actions, students, parents, and interest groups similar \nto Plaintiffs in this case, joined together and filed federal lawsuits asserting substantially similar \nclaims. See Fed. Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss 4–5 (collecting cases). Students and parents involved in \nthe District 211 case filed their own lawsuit alleging claims substantially identical to those \nasserted in this case. That particular case will be discussed in greater detail below. \n  In turn, Federal Defendants issued the February 2017 Dear Colleague Letter. The purpose \nof the letter was, in part, to inform the public that Federal Defendants were “withdrawing the \nstatements of policy and guidance reflected in” the May 2016 Dear Colleague Letter. U.S. Dep’ts \nof Educ. & Justice, Dear Colleague Letter (Feb. 22, 2017). The February 2017 Dear Colleague \nLetter states that its interpretation that “on the basis of sex” in Title IX “requires access to sex-\nsegregated facilities based on gender identity” has “given rise to significant litigation regarding \nschool restrooms and locker rooms.” Id. The letter continues by acknowledging then-existing \nconflicting judicial rulings on the issue among federal courts. Based on those circumstances, the \nletter states that Federal Defendants “have decided to withdraw and rescind the above-referenced \nguidance documents in order to further and more completely consider the legal issues involved. \nThe Departments thus will not rely on the views expressed within them.” Id. Furthermore, \nPlaintiffs attach to their complaint another letter from USDOE to its field offices dated June 6, \n2017. Compl. Ex. N. Similar to the February 2017 Dear Colleague Letter, this letter informs \nOPINION & ORDER - 17 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 18 of 56\nregional directors of USDOE’s Office for Civil Rights that they “may not rely on the policy set \nforth in the May 2016 Dear Colleague Letter.” Id. at 1. \n  In response to the February 2017 Dear Colleague Letter, several lawsuits challenging \nFederal Defendants’ Rule were voluntarily dismissed. See Fed. Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss 5 \n(collecting cases). In addition, the Supreme Court previously granted certiorari on the question of \nwhether courts should defer to the May 2016 Dear Colleague Letter. See G.G. ex rel. Grimm v. \nGloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., ___ U.S. ___, 137 S. Ct. 369 (2016) (mem.). Again, upon issuance of \nthe February 2017 Dear Colleague Letter, the Supreme Court vacated the Fourth Circuit’s \ndecision in that case and remanded for a determination of whether the issue had been mooted. \nGrimm, ___ U.S. ___, 137 S. Ct. 1239 (2017) (mem.). Upon remand, the district court \ndetermined that the transgender student plaintiff’s Title IX claim was not mooted and was \nsufficiently pled regardless of Federal Defendants’ administrative actions. Grimm v. Gloucester \nCty. Sch. Bd., 302 F. Supp. 3d 730, 748 (E.D. Va. 2018). \n  Based on the Complaint and its attached exhibits, Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged a \ncausal link between Federal Defendants’ challenged Rule and the alleged injury. Despite having \nfull knowledge of the events described above, Plaintiffs nevertheless filed this lawsuit on \nNovember 13, 2017, including allegations against Federal Defendants based on their rescinded \ninterpretation of Title IX. District’s Plan was enacted in November 2015, well before the May \n2016 Dear Colleague letter was issued. Similarly, most of Federal Defendants’ enforcement \nactions alleged in the complaint occurred after the Plan was enacted. Other than USDOE’s letter \nof a Title IX violation to District 211, the remaining enforcement allegations pertain to actions \ntaken after the Plan’s enactment. Therefore those enforcement actions cannot support Plaintiff’s \nalleged causal link.  \nOPINION & ORDER - 18 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 19 of 56\nAs to the District 211 action, USDOE issued its violation letter on November 2, 2015, \nand it entered into an agreement with District 211 on December 2, 2015. Compl. Exs. L & M. \nWhile it is possible that USDOE’s letter issued to District 211 influenced the District’s decision \nto enact the Plan that same month, that conclusion is merely speculative and fails to plausibly \nestablish causation. Plaintiffs “must offer facts showing that the government’s unlawful conduct \nis at least a substantial factor motivating the third parties’ actions” and they must “make that \nshowing without relying on ‘speculation’ or ‘guesswork’ about the third parties’ motivations.” \nMendia, 768 F.3d at 1013 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nThe sequence of events in this case shows that District’s Plan was enacted in response to \nStudent A’s accommodation request, not Federal Defendants’ actions. Compl. ¶ 78–82. Upon \nfirst receiving Student A’s request in September 2015, District initially provided an \naccommodation by allowing him to access single-use facilities. Id. at ¶¶ 78–79. District then \nformalized its response to Student A by issuing the Student Safety Plan in November 2015. \nCompl. ¶ 82. The Plan begins by stating that “[a]ll students have rights for attendance at public \nschools, and we have to follow the laws which protect those student rights.” Compl. Ex. A, at 1. \nNothing in the Plan states that District was motivated by external litigation or enforcement of \nTitle IX as a basis for its action. Rather, District lists elsewhere that its nondiscrimination \npolicies comply with several Oregon state laws as well as over a dozen federal laws, including \nTitle IX. See, e.g., Compl. Ex. B, at 2; Ex. D at 3. It would be purely speculative to conclude that \nFederal Defendants’ enforcement actions—as opposed to Student A’s request or the \nrequirements of many other state and federal laws—substantially motivated District to enact its \nPlan. There are no allegations based on District’s statements explaining why they enacted the \nPlan. Plaintiffs simply allege that Federal Defendants’ enforcement actions caused District to \nOPINION & ORDER - 19 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 20 of 56\nimplement the Plan. However, in light of the documents attached to the complaint, the Court is \nno longer required to accept that allegation as true. \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have not alleged that their purported \ninjuries are fairly traceable to Federal Defendants’ actions. Therefore, Plaintiffs have not \nsufficiently pleaded causation sufficient to establish Article III standing. \nC.  Redressability \n  Lastly, assuming Plaintiffs sufficiently alleged injury and causation, they must still \nestablish standing’s third requirement—redressability. Generally, a plaintiff must show that its \nrequested relief will redress its alleged injury. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. \n83, 103 (1998). \nWhen . . . a plaintiff’s asserted injury arises from the government’s \nallegedly unlawful regulation (or lack of regulation) of someone \nelse, much more is needed. In that circumstance, causation and \nredressability ordinarily hinge on the response of the regulated (or \nregulable) third party to the government action or inaction—and \nperhaps on the response of others as well. \n \nLujans, 504 U.S at 562. The concept of redressability “has been ingrained in our jurisprudence \nfrom the beginning,” the point of which is to determine “whether a plaintiff ‘personally would \nbenefit in a tangible way from the court’s intervention.’” Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 103 n.5 (quoting \nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 508 (1975)). The Supreme Court has found that there is no \nstanding for lack of redressability where “the injury to the plaintiff by the defendant was indirect \n(e.g., dependent on the action of a third party).” Id. at 125. \nIn this case, Plaintiffs seek relief including a Court order declaring the challenged \nguidance documents unlawful and directing Federal Defendants to remove those documents from \ntheir public websites. Compl. ¶ 147, p. 63. Plaintiffs also seek to enjoin Federal Defendants from \n“enforcing Title IX in a manner that requires District to give any students the right of entry to, \nOPINION & ORDER - 20 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 21 of 56\nand use of, the private facilities (including locker rooms, showers and restrooms) designated for \nstudents of the opposite sex.” Id. at ¶ 147, p. 63. \nPlaintiffs have not established that obtaining the relief they seek against Federal \nDefendants will redress their alleged injury. A favorable ruling for Plaintiff would result in the \nrescission of the Rule and would enjoin Federal Defendants from taking enforcement actions \nagainst District described above. This relief would not, however, redress Plaintiffs’ alleged \ninjury. District adopted its plan independent of any action by Federal Defendants and an order \ninvalidating the Rule would not result in the Plan’s withdrawal. In other words, District’s plan \nwould continue and Plaintiffs’ injury would persist notwithstanding granting Plaintiffs’ relief \nagainst Federal Defendants. Plaintiffs’ alleged legal wrongs based on their other claims would \nremain unaffected by a Court order invalidating the Rule and enjoining Federal Defendants. \nFurthermore, as discussed above, District cites to over two dozen state and federal laws \nas bases for its non-discrimination policy underlying the Student Safety Plan. See Compl. Ex. B. \nInvalidation of Rule as to Title IX would not affect District’s obligations under other state and \nfederal laws. In any event, Federal Defendants have unequivocally withdrawn the only guidance \non the issue of transgender student access to school facilities and they have forbidden reliance on \nthat guidance. See Feb. 2017 Dear Colleague Letter. The February 2017 Dear Colleague Letter \nstates that Federal Defendants believe “there must be due regard for the primary role of the \nStates and local school districts in establishing educational policy.” Id. In sum, District retains \nthe discretion to continue enforcing the Plan even if the Court granted Plaintiffs the relief they \nsought against Federal Defendants. Therefore, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that their \nrequested relief as to Federal Defendants will redress their alleged injury. \n// \nOPINION & ORDER - 21 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 22 of 56\nII.  The Right to Privacy \nNext, Plaintiffs allege that District and Federal Defendants violated Parent and Student \nPlaintiffs’ right to privacy guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. While there is no generalized \nright to privacy, the Supreme Court has recognized a privacy right against certain kinds of \ngovernmental intrusions under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Katz v. \nUnited States, 389 U.S. 347, 350 (1967); Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 152 (1973). “[O]nly \npersonal rights that can be deemed ‘fundamental’ or ‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,’ \nare included in this guarantee of personal privacy.” Roe, 410 U.S. at 152 (quoting Palko v. \nConnecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325 (1937)). The Due Process Clause “specially protects those \nfundamental rights and liberties which are, objectively, deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and \ntradition, and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, such that neither liberty nor justice would \nexist if they were sacrifices.” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721 (1997) (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted). The law further requires “a ‘careful description’ of the \nasserted fundamental liberty interest.” Id. Courts are, however, “reluctant to expand the concept \nof substantive due process because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered \narea are scarce and open-ended.” Collins v. City of Harker Heights, Tex., 503 U.S. 115, 125 \n(1992). \nA.  Fundamental Right \n  Plaintiffs formulate their privacy right as “a fundamental right to bodily privacy” which \nincludes “a right to privacy of one’s fully or partially unclothed body and the right to be free \nfrom State-compelled risk of intimate exposure of oneself to the opposite sex.” Compl. ¶188. \nReformulated elsewhere in the Complaint, Plaintiffs argue: \nThe ability to be clothed in the presence of the opposite biological \nsex, along with the freedom to use the restroom, locker room and \nOPINION & ORDER - 22 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 23 of 56\nshower away from the presence of the opposite biological sex, is \nfundamental to most people’s sense of self-respect and personal \ndignity,  including  plaintiffs’,  who  should  be  free  from  State-\ncompelled  risk  of  exposure  of  their  bodies,  or  their  intimate \nactivities. \n \nId. at ¶ 199.  \nDistrict and BRO argue that Plaintiffs’ asserted fundamental right is overbroad and \nunrecognized by any federal court. Under substantially similar circumstances, a district court \nconsidered a nearly identically-phrased fundamental right. See Students v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., \nNo. 16-CV-4945, 2016 WL 6134121, at *22 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 18, 2016) [hereinafter “Students & \nParents R&R”], report and recommendation adopted, U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 2017 WL 6629520 \n(N.D. Ill. Dec. 29, 2017) [hereinafter “Students & Parents”]. That court also considered a second \nrestatement of the right at issue: “does letting a biological male use the girls’ locker room and \nrestrooms, and so subjecting Girl Plaintiffs to the risk of compelled exposure of their bodies to \nthe opposite biological sex, violate Girl Plaintiffs’ constitutional right to privacy?” Students & \nParents R&R, 2016 WL 6134121, at *23. The district court found the latter formation more apt \nthan the one from the complaint; it then posited its own version of the issue: “do high school \nstudents have a constitutional right not to share restrooms or locker rooms with transgender \nstudents whose sex assigned at birth is different than theirs?” Id. The Court adopts the district \ncourt’s formation in Students & Parents, which is a more specific and complete statement of \nPlaintiffs’ asserted privacy right in this case.  \n  Equipped with this description of the asserted right, the Court must determine whether \nhigh school students have a fundamental right not to share restrooms or locker rooms with \ntransgender students. Defendants direct the Court to several cases similar to this one in which \ncourts have rejected Plaintiffs’ purported privacy interest in favor of transgender students’ access \nOPINION & ORDER - 23 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 24 of 56\nto school facilities. The following decisions are not binding upon this Court; however, in the \nabsence of binding authority from the Ninth Circuit, the Court relies on these opinions for their \npersuasiveness. Defendants primarily rely upon Students & Parents, 2017 WL 6629520. As \ndiscussed above, the court in Students & Parents concluded that high school students did not \nhave a fundamental right not to share school facilities with transgender students whose assigned \nsex is different than theirs. Students & Parents R&R, 2016 WL 6134121, at *23. In reaching that \nconclusion, the court considered the practical implications of transgender students’ access to \nfacilities, our Nation’s history of protecting and deferring to school administrators’ discretion, \nand contemporary notions of liberty and justice. Id. at *24–27.  \n  The court noted that no student was “compelled” by a state actor to use facilities with a \ntransgender student. Rather, District 211’s policy allowed transgender students to use facilities of \ntheir choice. The facilities included privacy stalls as well as other protections. Additionally, \nprivacy alternatives such as separate, single-user facilities were available. Students could also \nrequest the use of an alternate changing area within the locker rooms. The court found these \nprivacy protections significant and that they distinguished the case from those involving \ncompulsion and involuntary invasions of privacy. The court opined: \nGenerally speaking, the penumbral rights of privacy the Supreme \nCourt has recognized in other contexts protect certain aspects of a \nperson’s  private  space  and  decision-making  from  governmental \nintrusion. Even in the context of the right to privacy in one’s own \nbody, the cases deal with compelled intrusion into or with respect \nto a person’s intimate space or exposed body. No case recognizes a \nright to privacy that insulates a person from coming into contact \nwith someone who is different than they are, or who they fear will \nact in a way that causes them to be embarrassed or uncomfortable, \nwhen there are alternative means for both individuals to protect \nthemselves from such contact, embarrassment, or discomfort. \n \nId. at *24. Regarding the Nation’s history of deferring to schools, the court wrote: \nOPINION & ORDER - 24 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 25 of 56\nTherefore,  our  Nation’s  deeply  rooted  history  and  tradition  of \nprotecting school administrators’ discretion require that this Court \nnot unduly constrain schools from fulfilling their role as a principal \ninstrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing \nhim or her for later professional training, and in helping him or her \nto adjust normally to his or her environment.  \n \nId. (internal quotation marks, alterations, and citations omitted). The court also found that the \nplaintiffs’ asserted privacy right was inconsistent with contemporary notions of liberty and \njustice. Id. at *25. It was persuaded that transgender people do not live their lives in conformance \nwith their sex assigned at birth and the transgender students at issue in that case were treated by \nothers in a manner that was consistent with their gender identities. Additionally, the court \nreflected on the fact that, at that time, the U.S. military and militaries of other nations allowed \ntransgender personnel to serve fully and openly. Recognition and acceptance of transgender \npeople in various areas of society contradicted plaintiffs’ asserted right of high school students \nnot to share facilities with transgender students.  \n  Similarly, the Seventh Circuit granted a transgender boy’s request for a preliminary \ninjunction enjoining a school district from preventing him from using facilities consistent with \nhis gender identity. See Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d \n1034, 1038 (7th Cir. 2017), cert. dismissed, Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ. v. \nWhitaker ex rel. Whitaker, 138 S. Ct. 1260 (2018). The plaintiff in that case, a transgender boy \nnamed Ash, was forced by the school district to use either the girls’ restroom or a gender-neutral \nrestroom in the school’s main office. Id. at 1040. Ash had publicly transitioned and believed \nusing the girls’ restroom would undermine his transition. Id. He also feared that being the only \nstudent allowed to use the restroom in the main office would draw unwanted attention to his \ntransition and have a stigmatizing effect. Id. Lastly, he was concerned about being disciplined for \nattempting to use the girls’ restroom. Id. As a result, Ash drank less water and avoided using \nOPINION & ORDER - 25 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 26 of 56\nrestrooms during the school day even though it exacerbated his medical condition that made him \nmore susceptible to fainting and seizures. Id. at 1041. Ash ultimately used the boys’ restroom \nlater in high school and was punished for violating school policy. Id. at 1042. \n  When analyzing Ash’s assertion of irreparable harm, the Seventh Circuit found that \nAsh’s use of the boys’ restroom was integral to his transition and emotional well-being. Id. at \n1045. The court also found that “he was faced with the unenviable choice between using a \nbathroom that would further stigmatize him and cause him to miss class time, or to avoid use of \nthe bathroom altogether at the expense of his health.” Id. When considering Ash’s likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of his Equal Protection claim, the court found that the school’s policy \n“does nothing to protect the privacy rights of each individual student vis-à-vis students who \nshare similar anatomy and it ignores the practical reality of how Ash, as a transgender boy, uses \nthe bathroom: by entering a stall and closing the door.” Id. at 1052. \nThe court in that case elaborated: \nA transgender student’s presence in the restroom provides no more \nof a risk to other students’ privacy rights than the presence of an \noverly curious student of the same biological sex who decides to \nsneak glances at his or her classmates performing bodily functions. \nOr for that matter, any other student who uses the bathroom at the \nsame time. Common sense tells us that the communal restroom is a \nplace where individuals act in a discreet manner to protect their \nprivacy  and  those  who  have  true  privacy  concerns  are  able  to \nutilize a stall. \n \nId. Accordingly, the court found that Ash was likely to succeed on the merits of his Equal \nProtection claim. Lastly, the court found the balance of harms favored Ash and the school district \nhad not demonstrated that it will suffer any harm “[n]or have they demonstrated that Ash’s \npresence has actually caused an invasion of any other student’s privacy.” Id. at 1054.6 \n                                                           \n6 The Supreme Court granted certiorari on the dispositive issue in Whitaker. The relevant question presented asked: \n“Whether a school policy requiring boys and girls to use separate bathroom facilities that correspond to their \nOPINION & ORDER - 26 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 27 of 56\n  In further example, a Western District of Pennsylvania court granted transgender high \nschool students’ motion for a preliminary injunction enjoining the school from requiring them to \nuse only bathrooms matching their sex assigned at birth or single-user bathrooms. Evancho v. \nPine-Richland Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 3d 267, 272 (W.D. Pa. 2017). When analyzing the \nplaintiffs’ Equal Protection claim, that court considered whether other students’ right to privacy \nprovided a constitutionally sufficient basis supporting the school district’s policy. The court \nfound that the physical layout of the school’s facilities ensured adequate privacy. Id. at 290–91. \nThe court was persuaded that the bathroom stalls “afforded actual physical privacy from others \nviewing their external sex organs and excretory functions. Conversely, others in the restrooms \nare shielded from such views.” Id. at 291. \n  In another example, the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Doe v. Boyertown Area \nSchool District rejected a high school student’s challenge to a school rule allowing transgender \nstudents to use facilities consistent with students’ gender identities. 276 F. Supp. 3d 324 (E.D. \nPa. 2017), aff’d, 890 F.3d 1124 (3d Cir. 2018). The Third Circuit unanimously and emphatically \naffirmed the district court’s decision from the bench.7 The Doe court summarized the student \nplaintiffs’ asserted right to bodily privacy as follows:  \nAt  bottom,  the  plaintiffs  are  opposed  to  the  mere  presence  of \ntransgender  students  in  locker  rooms  or  bathrooms  with  them \nbecause they designate them as members of the opposite sex and \nnote that, inter alia, society has historically separated bathrooms \nand locker rooms on the basis of biological sex to preserve the \nprivacy of individuals from members of the opposite biological \nsex. \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nbiological sex is sex stereotyping that constitutes discrimination ‘based on sex’ in violation of Title IX.” Whitaker, \n858 F.3d 1034, petition for cert. filed, 2017 WL 3713066, at *1 (U.S. Aug. 27, 2017) (No. 17-301). The parties, \nhowever, voluntarily dismissed the case, leaving this Court without further guidance.  \n \n7 On June 18, 2018, the Third Circuit subsequently issued a formal written opinion stating: “Although we amplify \nthe District Court’s reasoning because of the interest in this issue, we affirm substantially for the reasons set forth in \nthe District Court’s opinion.” Doe, 2018 WL 3016864, at *1. \n \nOPINION & ORDER - 27 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 28 of 56\n \nId. at 330. In that case, a transgender boy changed clothes with the student plaintiffs in the boys’ \nlocker room and one plaintiff observed the transgender boy “wearing nothing but shorts and a \nbra.” Id. at 332. In response to that encounter and others like it, student boy plaintiffs felt \nashamed and embarrassed, changed quickly, and otherwise avoided encountering a transgender \nstudent in school facilities. Id. When analyzing the plaintiffs’ §1983 claim based on the \nfundamental right to privacy, the court wrote that plaintiffs believe “[t]he Constitution prohibits \nDefendants from placing students in situations where their bodies or private, intimate activities \nmay be exposed to the opposite sex or where the students will use privacy facilities with \nsomeone of the opposite sex.” Id. at 376–77. The Doe Court found that “[t]he plaintiffs have not \nidentified and this court has not located any court that has recognized a constitutional right of \nprivacy as broadly defined by the plaintiffs.” Id. at 383. The court noted that the plaintiffs’ right:  \nis so expansive that it would be a constitutional violation for a \nfemale to be in the presence of a male inside of a locker room or \nbathroom and vice versa, and it would be a violation of one’s \nconstitutional right of privacy to view a member of the opposite \nsex in a state of undress even if the viewing party was fully clothed \nat the time. There is no support for such a broad right of privacy \nthat has yet to be recognized. \n \nId. at 386. Indeed, the Third Circuit agreed, writing: “[W]e decline to recognize such an \nexpansive constitutional right to privacy—a right that would be violated by the presence of \nstudents who do not share the same birth sex. Moreover, no Court has ever done so.” Doe, 2018 \nWL 3016864, at *9. \nThe district court in Doe then engaged in an in-depth analysis of Students & Parents, \nultimately adopting the reasoning therein. Doe, 276 F. Supp. 3d at 385–86. The court concluded \nthat plaintiffs “have no constitutional right not to share restrooms and locker rooms with \ntransgender students whose sex assigned at birth is different from theirs.” Id. at 387. Similar to \nOPINION & ORDER - 28 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 29 of 56\nStudents & Parents, the court in Doe was persuaded that the case did not involve any compelled \nand involuntary exposure of genitals nor did it involve a strip search or other egregious privacy \ninfringement. The court concluded that the school’s policy was narrowly tailored to serve a \ncompelling government interest in not discriminating against transgender students. \n  Lastly, Defendants rely on a Southern District of Ohio decision denying a school \ndistrict’s motion for a preliminary injunction against USDOE. Bd. of Educ. of the Highland \nLocal Sch. Dist. v. United States Dep’t of Educ., 208 F. Supp. 3d 850, 854 (S.D. Ohio 2016). The \nplaintiff school district in that case sought to enjoin USDOE from requiring it to permit a \ntransgender girl to use the girls’ restroom. Id. The district attempted to justify excluding Jane, a \ntransgender girl student, by asserting the privacy rights of other students. Id. at 874. The court \nfound that there was “no evidence that Jane herself, if allowed to use the girls’ restroom, would \ninfringe upon the privacy rights of any other students.” Id.8 The district argued that the “students’ \n‘zone of privacy’ in the restroom starts at the door of the restroom, not merely at the stall door, \nand that, therefore, students’ privacy interests would be imperiled if Jane even enters the girls’ \nbathroom.” Id. at 875. The court found that there were no complaints of privacy violations and \nthe district’s “purported justification for its policy is ‘merely speculative’ and lacks any ‘factual \nunderpinning.’” Id. It concluded that the district “cannot show that its refusal to let Jane use the \ngirls’ restroom is substantially related to its interest in student privacy.” Id. at 867. \n  In contrast with Defendants’ authority, Plaintiffs present the Court with unpersuasive \nprecedent that fails to establish their purported privacy right. Plaintiffs argue that their asserted \nprivacy right finds its genesis in the Ninth Circuit’s decision in York v. Story, 324 F.2d 450, 455 \n(9th Cir. 1963). The Ninth Circuit explained: “We cannot conceive of a more basic subject of \n                                                           \n8 The Third Circuit in Doe affirmed the district court’s ruling “that even if a cisgender plaintiff had been viewed by a \ntransgender student, it would not have violated the cisgender student’s constitutional right to privacy.” 2018 WL \n3016864, at *4. \nOPINION & ORDER - 29 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 30 of 56\nprivacy than the naked body. The desire to shield one’s unclothed figured from the view of \nstrangers, and particularly strangers of the opposite sex, is impelled by elementary self-respect \nand personal dignity.” Id.; see also Sepulveda v. Ramirez, 967 F.2d 1413, 1415 (9th Cir. 1992) \n(stating that the “right to bodily privacy was established” in York). York involved a male police \nofficer taking unnecessary nude photographs of a female victim in provocative positions and \ncirculating them to other officers. 324 F.2d at 452. The Ninth Circuit reversed the trial court’s \ndecision to dismiss the plaintiff’s claim, holding that the complaint sufficiently alleged that the \nofficer’s acts “constitute an arbitrary intrusion upon the security of her privacy, as guaranteed to \nher by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Id. at 456. \nBased in part on York, Plaintiffs cite to several Ninth Circuit decisions acknowledging a \nright to bodily privacy. For example, in Byrd v. Maricopa County Sheriff’s Department, 629 F.3d \n1135 (9th Cir. 2011), the Ninth Circuit considered the constitutionality of a strip search in jail. A \nfemale cadet conducted a strip search of a male detainee in the presence of approximately three \ndozen cadets and detention officers as well as other male detainees. Id. at 1137. The cadet \nsearched over the detainee’s boxer shorts using her hands to search over his buttocks and \ngenitals. Id. The Ninth Circuit held that the cross-gender strip search, in the absence of an \nemergency, was a violation of the plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment right to be free from \nunreasonable searches. Id. at 1146–47.  \nSimilarly, in Caribbean Marine Services Co. v. Baldrige, 844 F.2d 668, 670 (9th Cir. \n1988), the Ninth Circuit considered whether a federal regulation requiring the presence of a \nfemale wildlife observer on a commercial fishing vessel violated the male crewmembers’ right to \nprivacy. Given the tight quarters of the fishing vessel, the plaintiff crew members alleged that the \nobserver may both see and be seen by crew members while undressing or performing bodily \nOPINION & ORDER - 30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 31 of 56\nfunctions. Id. at 672. The Ninth Circuit vacated the district court’s grant of a preliminary \ninjunction in the crew members’ favor. The court found, in relevant part, that the crew members’ \n“mere allegations of inconvenience” would not support a claim of “irreparable harm to their \nconstitutional rights.” Id. at 676. The court continued, however, that it would not reach the issue \nof whether “a female observer would infringe any constitutionally protected privacy interests” \nbecause the district court had not considered the plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits \nwhen it issued the preliminary injunction. Id. \nIn Supelveda v. Ramirez, the Ninth Circuit considered whether a male parole officer \nviolated a female parolee’s right to bodily privacy by entering the bathroom stall she occupied \nwhile she was partially clothed. 967 F.2d 1413, 1416 (9th Cir. 1992). The plaintiff parolee was \nrequired to produce a urine sample for a drug test and the male parole officer entered the stall \nwithout her consent. Id. at 1415. The plaintiff strongly objected, asking the officer to leave. In \nresponse, he said that she “did not have anything he had not seen before.” Id. The parole officer \n“remained in the stall while Supelveda finished urinating, cleaned herself, and dressed.” Id. The \nNinth Circuit found that, unlike other inmate cases involving obscured cross-sex observations \nfrom a distance, Supelveda experienced a “far more degrading” observation. Id. The Ninth \nCircuit rejected the parole officer’s claim for qualified immunity, concluding that the plaintiff \nhad asserted a clearly established right to bodily privacy. Id. \n  Each of the Ninth Circuit cases that Plaintiffs cite deal with alleged violations outside of \nthe school context. Further still, these cases involve very different circumstances than the facts of \nthis case. Plaintiffs’ Ninth Circuit authority involves a strip search that violated the Fourth \nAmendment, a female observer sharing ship quarters with male fishermen, a police officer taking \nunnecessary nude photos of a female crime victim, and a male parole officer entering a female \nOPINION & ORDER - 31 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 32 of 56\nparolee’s bathroom stall while she urinated. Simply put, each involved government-compelled \nexposure of the plaintiffs’ bodies to government actors of the opposite biological sex. At its core, \nnone of these cases support the proposition that high school students have a fundamental right \nnot to share restrooms and locker rooms with transgender students who have a different assigned \nsex than theirs. Indeed, Plaintiffs’ Ninth Circuit authority does not establish that the purported \nprivacy right is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. \n  Plaintiffs also rely on two out-of-circuit cases that the Court finds unpersuasive. The only \ncase Plaintiffs cite that discusses a privacy right in the school context is a Sixth Circuit decision \ninvolving a parent’s challenge to the dress code at his daughter’s middle school. Blau v. Fort \nThomas Pub. Sch. Dist., 401 F.3d 381, 385 (6th Cir. 2005). The court there framed the plaintiff’s \nasserted privacy right as the right to wear blue jeans, which it rejected. Id. at 393–94. Plaintiffs \npoint to the Blau court’s citation to an old Supreme Court case to support their position. \nSpecifically, in Union Pacific Railway Co. v. Botsford, 141 U.S. 250, 251 (1891), the Supreme \nCourt stated:  \nTo compel any one . . . to lay bare the body, or to submit to the \ntouch of a stranger, without lawful authority, is an indignity, an \nassault, and a trespass; and no order of process, commanding such \nan exposure or submission, was ever known to the common law in \nthe administration of justice between individuals. \n \nId. at 252. That case involved a defendant’s request in a tort action that the plaintiff submit to a \nsurgical examination to determine the extent of her injuries. Blau, 401 F.3d at 395. The Sixth \nCircuit in Blau concluded that the plaintiff’s reliance on Pacific Railway was misplaced and the \nquote was taken out of context. “Quite plainly, forcing someone to ‘lay bare the body’ to a \nsurgical procedure is not the same thing as forcing a middle-school student to wear certain types \nof clothes to school.” Id. at 395. Here too, the facts of Blau and Pacific Railway are \nOPINION & ORDER - 32 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 33 of 56\ndistinguishable and do not lend any support for Plaintiffs’ purported privacy right relating to the \npresence of transgender students in school facilities.  \n  The second out-of-circuit case Plaintiffs rely upon is a District of Maine decision \ninvolving a pretrial detainee’s lawsuit against a jail. Crosby v. Reynolds, 763 F. Supp. 666, 667 \n(D. Me. 1991). The plaintiff alleged that the jail unlawfully housed her with a transgender \nwoman who retained male genitalia. Id. Particularly, she alleged that she encountered the \ntransgender detainee while using the shower and restroom. The district court found that it was \nnot “called upon to decide whether a right to privacy would be clearly invaded if males and \nfemales generally were housed together.” Id. at 670 n.5. Instead, it concluded that the contours of \nthe right to privacy were not clear and the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. Id.  \n  Plaintiffs also argue that the language of Title IX and one of its implementing regulations \nsupport segregating school facilities based on biological sex. Particularly, 20 U.S.C. § 1686 \nstates that “nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit any educational institution \nreceiving funds under this Act, from maintaining separate living facilities for different sexes.” \nLikewise, a regulation states: “A recipient may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower \nfacilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities provided for students of one sex shall be \ncomparable to such facilities provided from students of the other sex.” 34 CFR § 106.33. As \nDistrict points out, however, the first statutory provision above is permissive, not mandatory. See \nDoe, 2018 WL 3016864, at *10. (“This exception is permissive—Title IX does not require that \nan institution provide separate privacy facilities for the sexes.”). This Court agrees that the \nregulation providing for equivalent facilities does not mandate sex-segregated facilities. Simply \nput, while Plaintiffs’ legal authorities support a school district’s decision to provide sex-\nOPINION & ORDER - 33 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 34 of 56\nsegregated facilities, those authorities do not “unequivocally uphold the right to bodily privacy” \nas Plaintiffs claim. See Pls.’ Resp. to District Mot to Dismiss 6.  \n  The Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently allege a fundamental right to \nprivacy cognizable under the Fourteenth Amendment. The cases that Plaintiffs rely on are \ninapposite and involve egregious state-compelled intrusions into one’s personal privacy. Put \nanother way, Plaintiffs draw heavily on prisoner and police cases distinguishable from the issue \npresented in this case. Those cases involved government officials viewing or touching the naked \nbodies of persons of the opposite sex against their will. Even under some of those circumstances, \ncourts have rejected the asserted privacy right.  \nThe Court is persuaded by Defendants’ authority and concludes that high school students \ndo not have a fundamental privacy right to not share school restrooms, lockers, and showers with \ntransgender students whose biological sex is different than theirs. The potential threat that a high \nschool student might see or be seen by someone of the opposite biological sex while either are \nundressing or performing bodily functions in a restroom, shower, or locker room does not give \nrise to a constitutional violation. See Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 657, 115 S. \nCt. 2386, 2393, 132 L. Ed. 2d 564 (1995) (recognizing that “[p]ublic school locker rooms . . . are \nnot notable for the privacy they afford” and legitimate expectations of privacy in such spaces are \nlessened); Doe, 2018 WL 3016864, at *8; Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1052–53; Students & Parents \nR&R, 2016 WL 6134121, at *24–27; Evancho, 237 F. Supp. 3d at 291. To hold otherwise would \nsweepingly expand the right to privacy beyond what any court has recognized. The Supreme \nCourt has repeatedly emphasized its reluctance to expand substantive due process rights such as \nthe right to privacy. It has stressed that the short list of liberty rights “protected by the Due \nProcess Clause includes the rights to marry, to have children, to direct the education and \nOPINION & ORDER - 34 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 35 of 56\nupbringing of one’s children, to marital privacy, to use contraception, to bodily integrity, and to \nabortion.” Gluckberg, 521 U.S. at 720. The right that Plaintiffs’ assert cannot be added to that \nlist. \nB.  Infringement of the Right \nEven assuming Plaintiffs’ asserted privacy right is fundamental, then the Court must \ndetermine whether District’s challenged conduct infringed the right and if so whether “the \ninfringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.” Reno v. Flores, \n507 U.S. 292, 301–02 (1993).  \nPlaintiffs allege that because Student A has been allowed to access school facilities, \n“biologically male and female students . . . have experienced, or may experience, \nembarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, fear, apprehension, stress, degradation, and loss of dignity \nbecause they will have to use locker rooms, showers and restrooms with a student of the opposite \nsex.” Compl. ¶ 43. Students are allegedly afraid of being seen by and sharing space with students \nof the opposite biological sex while undressing. Id. at ¶ 44. Particularly, Plaintiffs allege that \nstudents are afraid to attend to their personal needs, avoid using school facilities, have dropped \nPE classes, change as quickly as possible, or avoid restrooms altogether. Id. at ¶47. Further still, \nPlaintiffs allege that the facilities do not adequately ensure student privacy because the stalls are \nnot fully private as there are large gaps all around the stall doors that would allow other students \nto inadvertently see through. Id. at ¶ 83. Because of those gaps, students are at risk of exposing \nthemselves to the opposite sex when they use the restroom. Id. In sum, Plaintiffs allege that this \nrisk of intimate exposure to the opposite sex violates the students’ fundamental right to privacy. \nId. at ¶¶ 198–204. \nOPINION & ORDER - 35 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 36 of 56\n  In cases involving similar or stronger factual allegations, courts found that the student \nplaintiffs had failed to sufficiently allege that their schools had violated their right to privacy. In \nStudents & Parents, the district court considered allegations that student plaintiffs would suffer \nfear and anxiety given the risk of exposure to the opposite sex in school facilities. Plaintiffs in \nthis case, like the plaintiffs in Students & Parents, do not allege that any transgender student and \nany Student Plaintiff “ever saw an intimate part of the other’s body.” Students & Parents R&R, \n2016 WL 6134121, at *28. The court found that “[i]nside the stalls, there is no meaningful risk \nthat any part of a student’s unclothed body would be seen by another student. Therefore, these \nprotections almost entirely mitigate any potential risk of unwanted exposure by or to any Student \nPlaintiff.” Id. at *29.  \n  In Doe, the court considered greater evidence of possible infringement and found no \nconstitutional violation. As described above, a boy plaintiff in Doe saw a transgender boy in the \nlocker room wearing only shorts and a bra. Doe, 276 F. Supp. 3d at 382. In that case, a female \nstudent also entered a bathroom and saw a transgender girl while both were fully clothed. Id. \nAnother boy student testified that while he was in his underwear in the locker room, a \ntransgender boy was in close proximity to him. Id. The Doe court concluded: \nSince  this  matter  does  not  involve  any  forced  or  involuntary \nexposure of a student’s body to or by a transgender person, and the \nSchool District has instituted numerous privacy protections and \navailable  alternatives  for  uncomfortable  students  or  to  protect \nagainst involuntary exposure of a student’s partially clothed or \nunclothed body, the plaintiffs have not shown that the defendants \ninfringed upon their constitutional privacy rights. \n \nId. at 388–89; see also Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1054 (the Seventh Circuit held that the plaintiffs \nhad not demonstrated that presence of a transgender student in school facilities caused an \ninvasion of any other student’s privacy).  \nOPINION & ORDER - 36 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 37 of 56\nEven assuming that the presence of a transgender student in school facilities posed a risk \nof privacy infringement, which this Court finds it does not, the cases discussed above also found \nthat policies permitting transgender access were narrowly tailored to satisfy constitutional \nscrutiny. For example, in Doe, the Third Circuit recognized that cisgender plaintiffs may \nexperience a certain level of stress due to transgender students’ presence in school facilities, but \nthat stress was not “comparable to the plight of transgender students who are not allowed to use \nfacilities consistent with their gender identity.” 2018 WL 3016864, at *3. The Doe court found \nthat the school district “had a compelling state interest in protecting transgender students from \ndiscrimination.” Id. at *6. The plaintiffs in Doe and Plaintiffs in this case both argued that a \nschool policy allowing all students to use single-user accommodations or restrooms consistent \nwith their biological sex would be narrowly tailored. The Doe court rejected that argument, \nfinding that such a policy would violate the compelling interest identified above and brand \ntransgender students, inviting greater scrutiny from their peers. Id. at *8.  \n  In conclusion, based on the facts alleged in this case and the authority discussed above, \nPlaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment claim for a violation of the right to privacy must be dismissed. \nIII.  Title IX \n  Plaintiffs claim that District’s Plan violates Title IX’s prohibition of sex discrimination \nby creating a sexually harassing hostile environment. District responds that the Plan comports \nwith Title IX. BRO and State extend District’s argument and contend that Plaintiffs’ request that \nschool facilities to be segregated based on biological sex would itself violate Title IX. Title IX \nprovides: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education \nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. . . .” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). An \nOPINION & ORDER - 37 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 38 of 56\nimplementing regulation similarly provides: “A recipient may provide separate toilet, locker \nroom, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities provided for students of one \nsex shall be comparable to such facilities provided for students of the other sex.” 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.33. \nA.  Hostile Environment \n  Title IX hostile environment claims require that the school district: (1) had actual \nknowledge of; (2) and was deliberately indifferent to; (3) harassment because of sex that was; (4) \n“so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it can be said to deprive the victims of \naccess to the educational opportunities or benefits provided by the school.” Davis v. Monroe Cty. \nBd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 650 (1999). Defendants move to dismiss the Title IX claim on the \nbasis that Plaintiffs fail to establish the third and fourth hostile environment elements. First, \nPlaintiffs have not shown that the Plan targets or treats them any differently from other students \nwho attend Dallas High School. Second, Defendants argue that transgender students’ use of \nschool facilities is not severe, pervasive, or objectively offensive. \n  As to Defendants’ first argument, they explain that the Plan applies equally to all students \nand is not discriminatory on the basis of sex. The district court in Students & Parents agreed with \nthat position. There, the court found that the student plaintiffs “are not being targeted or singled \nout by District 211 on the basis of their sex, nor are they being treated any different than boys \nwho attend school within District 211.” Students & Parents R&R, 2016 WL 6134121, at *31. \nThe court elaborated that the bathroom policy applied to all restrooms: \nThat  means  cisgender  boys  use  the  boys’  restrooms  with \ntransgender boys just like cisgender girls use the girls’ restrooms \nwith transgender girls. District 211 also has made clear that it will \nallow transgender boys to use the boys’ locker rooms and will \nprovide the same privacy protections in the boys’ locker rooms as \nexist in the girls’ locker rooms, if requested. Therefore, the alleged \nOPINION & ORDER - 38 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 39 of 56\ndiscrimination and hostile environment that Girl Plaintiffs claim to \nexperience is not on the basis of their sex, and any discomfort Girl \nPlaintiffs  allege  they  feel  is  not  the  result  of  conduct  that  is \ndirected at them because they are female. All of Plaintiffs’ Title IX \nclaims suffer from this threshold problem. \n \nId. (internal citation omitted); see also Doe, 276 F. Supp. 3d at 394 (considered the same issue, \nagreeing with Students & Parents, and concluding that the plaintiffs failed to make the threshold \nshowing that they suffered discrimination on the basis of sex). \n  The Doe court also found that the school district’s “similar treatment of all students is \nfatal to the plaintiffs’ Title IX claim.” 276 F. Supp. 3d at 394. The court explained:  \nThe plaintiffs have failed to cite to any case holding that a plaintiff \ncan maintain a sexual harassing hostile environment claim when \nthe  allegedly  sexually  harassing  party  treats  all  individuals \nsimilarly and there is, as such, no evidence of gender/sex animus. \nSimply because the plaintiffs feel  a particular  way which they \nequate to their sex does not take away from the fact that the School \nDistrict’s practice is not targeting any group or individual because \nof their sex. Even if the court were to find that the practice is based \non sex, the plaintiffs ignore that Tile IX deals with ‘discrimination’ \nbased on sex and there can be no discrimination when everyone is \ntreated the same. \n \nId. \n  The Court is persuaded that District’s Plan does not discriminate on the basis of sex \nwithin the meaning of Title IX. Plaintiffs argue that the Plan does not treat everyone the same \nbecause students are experiencing apprehension about encountering someone of another sex in \nan intimate space. Plaintiffs do not, however, assert any legal support for the proposition that the \nPlan discriminates against on the basis of their sex. See Pls.’ Resp. to District’s Motion to \nDismiss 10–12. Nor do Plaintiffs attempt to overcome Students & Parents or Doe previously \ndiscussed. In this case, as in Students & Parents and Doe, District’s plan does not target any \nOPINION & ORDER - 39 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 40 of 56\nStudent Plaintiff because of their sex. In other words, Student Plaintiffs have not demonstrated \nthat they are being treated any differently from other students at Dallas High School.  \n  As outlined above, Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs have not alleged harassment that \nwas severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive such that it deprived Student Plaintiffs of \neducational opportunities. Defendants contend that conduct which rises to this level generally \nrequires instances of physical sexual contact or threatened physical sexual contact. The mere \npresence of a transgender student is insufficient to establish a hostile environment. Indeed, it is \ntelling that Plaintiffs’ complaint does not contain any allegation of harassment or misuse of \nschool facilities.  \nCourts have recognized that the presence of transgender people in an intimate setting \ndoes not, by itself, create a sexually harassing environment that is severe and pervasive. For \nexample, in Students & Parents, the court considered the same argument proffered by Plaintiffs \nin this case and concluded that “[g]eneralized statements of fear and humiliation are not enough \nto establish severe, pervasive or objectively offensive conduct.” 2016 WL 6134121, at *32. The \ntrial court found that “[t]he mere presence of a transgender student in a restroom or locker room \ndoes not rise to the level of conduct that has been found to be objectively offensive, and therefore \nhostile, in other cases.” Id. The court then explained that cases which found that the conduct was \nsevere and pervasive involved egregious and persistent acts of sexual violence and verbal \nharassment. Id. Additionally, the court in Students & Parents found that any risk of a hostile \nenvironment was sufficiently mitigated by privacy protections put in place at the school. Id. at \n*33–34. The court concluded that the plaintiffs failed to show that any students were denied \nequal educational opportunities or access to benefits. Id.  \nOPINION & ORDER - 40 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 41 of 56\n  Likewise, Doe followed Students & Parents, finding that the plaintiffs failed to show that \nthe school district’s practice was “so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it \nundermined and detracted from their educational experience.” 276 F. Supp. 3d at 396. As with \nTitle VII, the objective prong of this element requires looking at the totality of the circumstances \nwhich includes “the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically \nthreatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it so undermines and \ndetracts from the victims’ educational experience, that he or she is effectively denied equal \naccess to an institution’s resource and opportunities.” Id. at 396–97 (citation and alterations \nomitted). In that case, the district court found that the few instances in which transgender and \ncisgender students encountered each other in different stages of undress in school facilities was \ninsufficient to show that “plaintiffs were subjected to pervasive sexual harassment in regard to \ntheir actual interaction with transgender students in the privacy facilities[.]” Id. at 397.  \nThe court in Doe also rejected the plaintiffs’ fallback position that the mere presence of \ntransgender students in school facilities was severe and pervasive. The Doe court stated that \nplaintiffs failed to cite “any case stating that the mere possibility of future exposure to the alleged \nharassment can render a single instance of harassment pervasive.” Id. It concluded that plaintiffs \nfailed to establish that the mere presence of transgender students was severe and pervasive. \nAdditionally, the plaintiffs there had not established that the school district’s conduct was \nobjectively offensive “because a reasonable person would not find the practice of allowing \ntransgender students to use the locker rooms and bathrooms corresponding to their gender \nidentity to be hostile, threatening or humiliating.” Id. The court explained: \nThere is no evidence that these students have committed any lewd \nacts  in  the  locker  room  or  bathrooms  or  that  they  have  even \ninteracted with the plaintiffs in any way whatsoever. There is no \nevidence that the transgender students have harassed the plaintiffs \nOPINION & ORDER - 41 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 42 of 56\nor  any  other  student.  All  the  evidence  showed  was  that  the \ntransgender  students  were  in  the  facilities  for  their  intended \npurposes and they conducted themselves appropriately while in \nthose areas. \n \nId. at 401–02. \n  Similarly, in the Title VII employment context, the Eighth Circuit determined on \nsummary judgment that the presence of a transgender woman in the women’s faculty bathroom \ndid not create a sexually harassing environment. Cruzan v. Special Sch. Dist, No. 1, 294 F.3d \n981, 984 (8th Cir. 2002). The Cruzan court found that the plaintiff “failed to show the school \ndistrict’s policy allowing Davis to use the women’s faculty restroom created a working \nenvironment that rose to this level.” Id. The appellate court was further persuaded by the fact that \nthe plaintiff did not assert that the transgender woman “engaged in any inappropriate conduct \nother than merely being present in the women’s faculty restroom.” Id. Under the totality of the \ncircumstances, the court concluded that a reasonable person would not have found that \nenvironment hostile or abusive. Id. \n  In this case, Plaintiffs’ response to Defendants’ arguments and the line of cases discussed \nabove lacks merit. Without citing any authority, Plaintiffs argue the following: \nSeverity may vary with the students affected. Its pervasiveness \ncannot be doubted when [the Plan] applies to an entire campus and \nstudent body, and may later be applied to other schools as well. \nObjective offensiveness should also not be determined as a matter \nof law in a society where sex-segregated facilities in public and \nprivate venues are the norm.  \n \nPls.’ Resp. to District’s Motion to Dismiss 12. The Court is unpersuaded. Whether the alleged \nharassment is severe, pervasive, or objectively offensive requires showing that the victims were \neffectively denied equal access to educational resources and opportunities. Plaintiffs have not \nOPINION & ORDER - 42 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 43 of 56\nsatisfied that burden by simply alleging that District’s plan may be widely applied and sex-\nsegregated facilities are well-established. \n  In conclusion, Plaintiffs have not made out the necessary elements of their hostile \nenvironment Title IX claim. Plaintiffs have failed to cite to any case law supporting the \npropositions that District’s Plan discriminates because of sex, or that it creates a severe, \npervasive, and objectively offensive environment.  \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Requested Relief \nBRO and State further argue that Plaintiffs’ requested relief would violate Title IX. \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs’ request for a court order requiring transgender students to use single-user \nfacilities or facilities that match their biological sex is a form of sex discrimination under the \nstatute. The Ninth Circuit has recognized that discrimination against a transgender person \nbecause of their gender identity is discrimination because of sex. See Kastl v. Maricopa Cty. \nCmty. Coll. Dist., 325 F. App’x 492, 493 (9th Cir. 2009).9 In Kastl, a transgender woman \nbrought Title VII and Title IX claims against the community college where she worked as an \ninstructor. Id. Kastl challenged the defendant’s decision to ban her from using the women’s \nrestroom in response to a complaint that a man was using it. Id. Additionally, Kastl’s contract \nwas not renewed. Id. The Ninth Circuit stated that “gender stereotyping is direct evidence of \ndiscrimination prohibited by Title VII.” Id. (citing Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, \n251 (1989)). The court elaborated that “it is unlawful to discriminate against a transgender (or \nany other) person because he or she does not behave in accordance with an employer’s \nexpectation for men or women.” Id. The Ninth Circuit, nevertheless, upheld the district court’s \ndecision to grant summary judgment on her gender discrimination claim because she was unable \n                                                           \n9 Notably, Justice Gorsuch sat by designation on this case alongside Judges Fletcher and McKeown. \nOPINION & ORDER - 43 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 44 of 56\nto prove that the defendant’s actions were motivated by her gender. Id. at 494. Kastl’s Title IX \nclaim fell with her Title VII claim on the same ground. Id.  \nIn a recent decision coming out of the Southern District of California, a court relied on \nKastl to emphasize that “sex” under Title VII and Title IX encompasses both biological \ndifference and gender. Prescott v. Rady Children's Hosp.-San Diego, 265 F. Supp. 3d 1090, \n1098–99 (S.D. Cal. 2017). The court in Prescott recognized that “[o]ther Circuits have similarly \ninterpreted the sex discrimination provisions under Title IX and Title VII to protect transgender \nindividuals from discrimination.” Id. at 1098–99 (collecting cases). While these two cases may \ndemonstrate that the Ninth Circuit interprets the term sex” as used in Title IX to include gender \nidentity, neither case expressly supports the proposition that a policy requiring transgender \nstudents to use facilities that match their biological sex is sex discrimination. Indeed, in the \nFebruary 2017 Dear Colleague Letter, Federal Defendants maintain that discrimination against \ntransgender students is prohibited by Title IX, while at the same time they deferred to the \ndiscretion of school administrators on the issue of segregated facilities. The question remains, \nthen, whether preventing transgender students from using facilities consistent with their gender \nidentity constitutes discrimination because of sex. \n  Other circuits have provided more direct guidance on this issue. The Seventh Circuit in \nWhitaker unequivocally found that the relief which Plaintiffs in this case seek would violate Title \nIX. 858 F.3d at 1047–50. The court explained that “[b]y definition, a transgender individual does \nnot conform to the sex-based stereotypes of the sex that he or she was assigned at birth.” Id. at \n1048. Like the court in Prescott, the Whitaker court also noted that several circuits and district \ncourts have recognized that discrimination against someone because they are transgender is sex-\nstereotyping and discrimination for gender nonconformity. Id. at 1048–49 (collecting cases). \nOPINION & ORDER - 44 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 45 of 56\nA policy that requires an individual to use a bathroom that does not \nconform with his or her gender identity punishes that individual for \nhis or her gender non-conformance, which in turn violates Title IX. \nThe School District’s policy also subjects Ash, as a transgender \nstudent,  to  different  rules,  sanctions,  and  treatment  than  non-\ntransgender students, in violation of Title IX. \n \nId. at 1049–50. The Seventh Circuit further held that providing Ash with gender-neutral \nalternatives was insufficient because it increased the stigmatization he faced. Id. at 1050.  \n  Likewise, the Third Circuit in Doe relied on Whitaker to write that “barring transgender \nstudents from restrooms that align with their gender identity would itself pose a potential Title \nIX violation.” Doe, 2018 WL 3016864, at *10. The Third Circuit, however, did not provide a \ndefinitive ruling on that issue, instead relying on Whitaker to hold that the plaintiffs were not \nlikely to succeed on the merits of their Title IX claim. Id. at *13. The Third Circuit held that “a \ncourt may not issue an injunction that would subject the transgender students to different \nconditions than their cisgender peers are subjected to.” Id. at *14; see also Glenn v. Brumby, 663 \nF.3d 1312, 1316–17 (11th Cir. 2011) (recognizing that discrimination against a transgender \nperson because of their gender identity is discrimination because of sex); Smith v. City of Salem, \n378 F.3d 566, 573 (6th Cir. 2004) (holding that gender stereotyping is a form of sex \ndiscrimination under Title VII).  \n  Other district courts have reached similar conclusions. On remand from the Fourth \nCircuit, the district court in Grimm concluded that “discrimination on the basis of transgender \nstatus constitutes gender stereotyping because by definition, transgender persons do not conform \nto gender stereotypes.” Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., Civ. No. 4:15cv54, 18 (E.D. Va. May \n22, 2018) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (quoting M.A.B. v. Bd. Of Educ. Of \nTalbot Cty., 286 F. Supp. 3d 704, 714 (D. Md. Mar. 12, 2018)). When analyzing whether the \nTitle IX claim based on gender stereotyping was sufficiently pled, the Grimm court relied on \nOPINION & ORDER - 45 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 46 of 56\nWhitaker to conclude that a policy requiring transgender students to use bathrooms that do not \nconform with their gender identity is a violation of Title IX. Id. at 22 (citing Whitaker, 858 F.3d \nat 1049–50). The availability of gender-neutral alternatives is “insufficient to relieve the school \nboard of liability, ‘as it is the policy itself which violates [Title IX.]’” Id. (quoting Whitaker, 858 \nF.3d at 1040); see also M.A.B., 286 F. Supp. 3d at 716 (finding that a policy denying a \ntransgender boy from accessing the boys’ locker rooms because of his gender identity was sex \ndiscrimination under Title IX).  \n  The Court finds that the reasoning in Whitaker and cases following it is persuasive.  \nA court order directing District to require students to use only facilities that match their \nbiological sex or to use gender-neutral alternative facilities would violate Title IX. \nForcing transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity would \nundoubtedly harm those students and prevent them from equally accessing educational \nopportunities and resources. Such an injunction or District policy would punish transgender \nstudents for their gender nonconformity and constitute a form of sex-stereotyping. Whitaker, 858 \nF.3d at 1048–50. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ requested relief itself would violate \nTitle IX. \nIV.  Oregon State Law Claims \n  Plaintiffs allege that District’s Plan violates the Oregon law prohibiting discrimination in \neducation and public accommodation. See O.R.S. 659.850, 659A.403. District and BRO move to \ndismiss these claims. BRO further argues that the relief Plaintiffs seek violates Oregon anti-\ndiscrimination laws. \n// \n// \nOPINION & ORDER - 46 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 47 of 56\nA.  O.R.S. 659.850: Discrimination in Education \n  To make out a discrimination in education claim under Oregon law, Plaintiffs must show \nthat District’s action either: (1) “unreasonably differentiates treatment”; or (2) “is fair in form but \ndiscriminatory in operation . . . based on sex.” O.R.S. 659.850(1). The Oregon Court of Appeals \nhas interpreted “unreasonably differentiates treatment” to mean “disparate treatment \ndiscrimination—i.e., a policy or practice that affirmatively treats some persons less favorably \nthan other persons based on certain protected criteria, such as . . . sex[.]” Nakashima v. Or. Bd. of \nEduc., 344 Or. 497, 509, 185 P.3d 429, 437 (2008). In Nakashima, the appellate court recognized \nthat the second requirement above was taken directly from the Supreme Court’s decision in \nGriggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431 (1971), which embraced the disparate impact \ntheory of discrimination. Id. at 509–10, 185 P.3d at 437.  \n  In this case, there are no allegations that the Plan differentiates or is discriminatory in \noperation. As discussed above, the Plan does not single out or treat any Student Plaintiff \ndifferently from any other student on the basis of sex. See supra Part III. Further, Plaintiffs have \nnot demonstrated that their privacy right encompasses the right to use school facilities to the \nexclusion of transgender students. See supra Part II. Simply put, Plaintiffs have not carried their \nburden of sufficiently alleging either disparate treatment or discriminatory impact. Therefore, the \nCourt dismisses this claim. \nB.  O.R.S. 659A.403: Public Accommodation  \n  Under Oregon law all persons “are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, \nadvantages, facilities and privileges of any place of public accommodation, without any \ndistinction, discrimination or restriction on account of . . . sex” or “sexual orientation.” O.R.S. \n659A.403(1). The scope of this statute was expanded to include “sexual orientation” which \nOPINION & ORDER - 47 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 48 of 56\nmeans “an individual’s actual or perceived heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality or gender \nidentity, regardless of whether the individuals gender identity, appearance, expression or \nbehavior differs from that traditionally associated with the individual’s sex at birth.” O.R.S. \n174.100(7) (emphasis added).  \n  There are no allegations in the Complaint that implementation of District’s Plan denied \nstudents equal or full access to public accommodations based on sex. The opposite is true. The \nPlan ensures that all students have access to school facilities. See e.g., Doe, 2018 WL 3016864, \nat *7 (concluding that a similar policy “benefits all students by promoting acceptance”). \nPlaintiffs argue that the presence of transgender students in school facilities denies equal access \nto Student Plaintiffs who are ashamed or embarrassed to share such spaces with transgender \nstudents. Those feelings, however, do not equate to unlawful discrimination in public \naccommodation because the Plan itself does not deny students access to school facilities.  \nContrary to Plaintiffs’ position, the Oregon Court of Appeals has held that denying access \nto public accommodations because someone is transgender violates Oregon public \naccommodations law. See Blachana, LLC v. Or. Bureau of Labor & Indus., 273 Or. App. 806, \n808, 359 P.3d 574, 575 (2015), opinion adhered to as modified on reconsideration, 275 Or. App. \n46, 362 P.3d 1210 (2015). In Blachana, the court held that a club owner violated Oregon’s public \naccommodations law by banning a group of people, including transgender people, from \naccessing the club on Friday nights because it was allegedly bad for business. Id. The court \nfound that the club owner had discriminated because of the group members’ sexual orientation \nand gender identity. Id. at 808–810 n.3, 359 P.3d at 575 (citing ORS 659A.403 and OAR 839-\n005-0003(16)). \nOPINION & ORDER - 48 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 49 of 56\nPlaintiffs’ argument in response is a non sequitur. See Pls.’ Resp to District’s Mot. to \nDismiss 15–16; Pls.’ Resp. to BRO’s Mot. to Dismiss 9–10. Plaintiffs generally argue that what \n“would truly be equal treatment would be to allow any student to use single-use facilities on an \nequal basis[.]” Pls. Resp. to District’s Mot. to Dismiss 15. Plaintiffs argue that “other students \nshould have the same opportunity” as Student A and that their requests for accommodations not \nto share space with transgender students should be granted. Pls.’ Resp. to BRO’s Mot. to Dismiss \n10. Plaintiffs provide no legal support for their public accommodations claim nor do they rebut \nthe authority cited above. The Court’s analysis of Plaintiff’s arguments made in defense of their \nTitle IX claim applies with equal force here. See supra Part III. Accordingly, this claim has not \nbeen plausibly alleged and is dismissed. \nC.  Plaintiffs’ Requested Relief  \nMore broadly, BRO and State raise the issue of whether a policy requiring transgender \nstudents to use facilities consistent with their biological sex would violate Oregon law. See BRO \nMot. to Dismiss 18–19; Amicus Br. 9–10. \n Beyond the Blachana case discussed above, State—which includes ORDOE responsible \nfor administering and enforcing Oregon’s public education law— takes the litigation position \nthat treating transgender students differently by preventing them from using their desired \nfacilities would violate Oregon’s public accommodation law. ORDOE promulgated guidance for \nschool districts entitled: “Creating a Safe and Supportive School Environment for Transgender \nStudents.” Compl. Ex. M-1, at 1. That guidance provides: \nIt is recommended that school districts accept a student’s assertion \nof his/her/their own gender identity. A student who says she is a \ngirl and wishes to be regarded that way throughout the school day \nshould be respected and treated like any other girl. So too with a \nstudent who says he is a boy and wishes to be affirmed that way \nOPINION & ORDER - 49 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 50 of 56\nthroughout the school day. Such a student should be respected and \ntreated like any other boy. \n \nId. at 4. ORDOE’s guidance further recommends that “alternative accommodations, such as \nsingle ‘unisex’ bathroom or private changing space, should be made available to students who \nrequest them, but should not be forced upon students, or presented as the only option.” Id. at 10. \nAdditionally, the guidance recommended that transgender students be allowed to use facilities \nconsistent with the student’s gender identity. Id. at 11.  \nState contends that Oregon anti-discrimination law requires that transgender students be \nallowed to use facilities they desire. Oregon’s statutory scheme, case law, and administrative \nguidance discussed above support State’s position. Oregon law prohibits discrimination in public \neducation based on an individual’s gender identity. Plaintiffs seek a Court order directing District \nto treat transgender students differently based on their gender identity in violation of Oregon law. \nO.R.S. 659A.403(1); O.R.S. 174.100(7). A policy that segregates school facilities based on \nbiological sex and prevents transgender students from accessing facilities that align with their \ngender identity violates Oregon law.  \nV.  The Right to Direct the Education and Upbringing of One’s Children \n  Next, Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claim that District’s Plan violates Parent \nPlaintiffs’ fundamental right to direct the education and upbringing of their children. Plaintiffs \nallege that District violated their parental rights by exposing their children to members of the \nopposite biological sex in school facilities. \nFederal courts recognize the so-called Meyer-Pierce right of parents under the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923); Pierce \nv. Soc’y of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925). “The Supreme Court has held that the right of parents to \nmake decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children is a fundamental \nOPINION & ORDER - 50 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 51 of 56\nliberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.” Fields v. Palmdale Sch. Dist., 427 F.3d \n1197, 1204 (9th Cir. 2005) (citing Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 66 (2000)).  \nIn this case, Plaintiffs allege that their parental right includes “the duty to instill moral \nstandards and values in their children, and to direct their education and upbringing” which \n“encompasses the right to determine whether and when their minor children endure the risk of \nbeing exposed to members of the opposite sex in intimate, vulnerable settings like restrooms, \nlocker rooms and showers.” Compl. ¶ 210. Plaintiffs allege that they: \nhave a fundamental right to determine whether and when \ntheir children will have to risk being exposed to opposite \nsex nudity at  school, as  well as  a fundamental  right  to \ndetermine whether their children, while at school, will have \nto risk exposing their own undressed or partially unclothed \nbodies to members of the opposite sex. \n \nId. at ¶ 211. In Fields, the Ninth Circuit recognized that “the right of parents to make decisions \nconcerning the care, custody, and control of their children is not without limitations.” 427 F.3d at \n1204. Parents’ liberty interest does not reside “exclusively” in the parents “nor is it ‘beyond \nregulation [by the state] in the public interest.’” Id. (quoting Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. \n158, 166 (1944)). The Ninth Circuit elaborated that the Meyer-Pierce right does not allow \nparents to restrict the flow of information in public schools. Id. at 1206. “Schools cannot be \nexpected to accommodate the personal, moral or religious concerns of every parent. Such an \nobligation could not only contravene the educational mission of the public schools, but also \nwould be impossible to satisfy.” Id. \n  More importantly, the Fields court explained that parents are vested with the right to \nchoose where their children obtain an education. However, “once parents make the choice as to \nwhich school their children will attend, their fundamental right to control the education of their \nchildren is, at the least, substantially diminished.” Id. Parents are not vested with the power to \nOPINION & ORDER - 51 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 52 of 56\ndetermine how a school “will provide information to its students or what information it will \nprovide, in its classrooms or otherwise.” Id. (emphasis added). The Ninth Circuit then adopted \nthe Sixth Circuit’s position on this right: \nPerhaps the Sixth Circuit said it best when it explained, “While \nparents may have a fundamental right to decide whether to send \ntheir child to a public school, they do not have a fundamental right \ngenerally to direct how a public school teaches their child. Whether \nit is the school curriculum, the hours of the school day, school \ndiscipline, the timing and content of examinations, the individuals \nhired to teach at the school, the extracurricular activities offered at \nthe  school  or,  as  here,  a  dress  code,  these  issues  of  public \neducation are generally ‘committed to the control of state and local \nauthorities.’” \n \nId. (quoting Blau, 401 F.3d at 395–96). \n  In this case, Parent Plaintiffs seek to expand their right and exercise control over \nDistrict’s decisionmaking authority embodied in the Plan. It is within Parent Plaintiffs’ right to \nremove their children from Dallas High School if they disapprove of transgender student access \nto facilities. Once the parents have chosen to send their children to school, however, their liberty \ninterest in their children’s education is severely diminished. Plaintiffs cite no case standing for \nthe proposition that parents retain the right to prevent transgender students from sharing school \nfacilities with their children. As the Ninth Circuit explained in Fields, Parent Plaintiffs’ \nFourteenth Amendment liberty interest in the education and upbringing of their children “does \nnot extend beyond the threshold of the school door.” Id. at 1207. Accordingly, the Court \ndismisses this claim. \nVI.  Plaintiffs’ Religious Claims \n  Lastly, Plaintiffs allege that District’s Plan violates their First Amendment right to freely \nexercise their religion. Additionally, Plaintiffs claim that Federal Defendants’ administrative \nactions violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”). District and BRO move to \nOPINION & ORDER - 52 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 53 of 56\ndismiss the free exercise claim. By contrast, Federal Defendants generally move that Plaintiffs’ \nclaims be dismissed for lack standing. \nA.  First Amendment — Free Exercise \n  The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law respecting an \nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. . . .” U.S. Const., Amdt. 1 \n(emphasis added). The Supreme Court explained: \nThe  First  Amendment  obviously  excludes  all  governmental \nregulation of religious beliefs as such. The government may not \ncompel affirmation of religious belief, punish the expression of \nreligious  doctrines  it  believes  to  be  false,  impose  special \ndisabilities on the basis of religious views or religious status, or \nlend  its  power  to  one  or  the  other  side  in  controversies  over \nreligious authority or dogma. \n \nEmp’t Div. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 877 (1990) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \nOn the other hand, “neutral, generally applicable laws that incidentally burden the exercise of \nreligion usually do not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.” Holt v. Hobbs, \n135 S. Ct. 853, 860 (2015) (citing Smith, 494 U.S. at 878–82). Generally applicable neutral laws \n“need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even if the law has the incidental \neffect of burdening a particular religious practice.” Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. \nCity of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993). Such laws are permissible if they are rationally \nrelated to a legitimate government interest. Id. at 531. “A law failing to satisfy these \nrequirements must be justified by a compelling governmental interest and must be narrowly \ntailored to advance that interest.” Id. at 531–32.  \n  Plaintiffs’ religious allegations are succinct. They contend that the Plan is not generally \napplicable and that it burdens the free exercise rights of some Plaintiffs. Compl. ¶¶ 258–264. The \ncomplaint alleges that “[s]ome students and parent members of Parents for Privacy, including \nOPINION & ORDER - 53 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 54 of 56\nJon & Kris Golly and their children, are devout Christians whose faith requires that they preserve \ntheir modesty and not use the restroom, shower, or undress, in the presence of the opposite sex.” \nId. at ¶ 120. Likewise, the Complaint alleges that “[s]ome parent Plaintiffs, including Jon and \nKris Golly, object to the Student Safety Plan for religious reasons because of their sincerely-held \nreligious beliefs about modesty and other religious doctrines.” Id. at ¶ 216.  \n  Plaintiffs claim that the Plan is not generally applicable because it pertains specifically to \nStudent A. Plaintiffs misunderstand the law. Neutrality and general applicability are considered \nwith respect to religion. Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 532–33. A law is neutral and generally applicable if \nit does not “infringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation,” and if it \ndoes not “in a selective manner impose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief[.]” \nId. at at 533. Moreover, the Plan states in its opening paragraph that it is “aimed to support all \nstudents in this transition.” Compl. Ex. A. \n  In this case, the law is neutral and generally applicable with respect to religion. There are \nno allegations that District forced any Plaintiff to embrace a religious belief, nor does the Plan \npunish anyone for expressing their religious beliefs. In any event, Plaintiffs do not have standing \nto bring this claim. The Gollys do not have a child at Dallas High School and are therefore \nunaffected by the Plan. Plaintiffs’ generalized allegation that the unspecified religious beliefs of \nunidentified plaintiffs would be burdened lacks specificity, cannot sustain Plaintiffs’ First \nAmendment claim.10 \n// \n// \n                                                           \n10 Plaintiffs argue that strict scrutiny should apply because they have asserted a hybrid-rights claim combining free \nexercise with their other asserted rights, i.e. privacy and parental rights. See Miller v. Reed, 176 F.3d 1202, 1207 \n(9th Cir. 1999). However, given that the Court dismisses Plaintiffs’ parental rights claim, Plaintiffs’ assertion of a \nhybrid claim also fails. \nOPINION & ORDER - 54 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 55 of 56\nB.  RFRA \n  The Supreme Court recognizes that Congress enacted RFRA “in order to provide greater \nprotection for religious exercise than is available under the First Amendment.” Holt, 135 S. Ct. at \n860 (citing Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2761 (2014)). \nRFRA provides that “[g]overnment shall not substantially burden a \nperson’s exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule \nof general applicability,” unless the government “demonstrates that \napplication of the burden to the person—(1) is in furtherance of a \ncompelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive \nmeans of furthering that compelling governmental interest.”  \n \nId. at 860 (quoting 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb-1(a), (b)).  \n  Plaintiffs allege: \nMany  student  Plaintiffs  have  religious  convictions  that  they \npractice modesty. These students have the sincere religious belief \nthat they must not undress, or use the restroom, in the presence of \nthe opposite biological sex, and also that they must not be in the \npresence  of  the  opposite  biological  sex  while  the  opposite \nbiological sex is undressing or using the restroom.  \n \nCompl. ¶ 249. Plaintiffs also reassert Kris and Jon Golly’s religious beliefs in support of the \nRFRA claim. Id. at ¶ 250.  \n  This claim is alleged solely against Federal Defendants; however, it lacks any allegation \nrelating to their actions. The only causal connection Plaintiffs posit is that Federal Defendants’ \nadministrative actions caused District to enact the Plan. As discussed above when analyzing \nPlaintiffs’ APA claim, Plaintiffs have failed to allege the requisite causation to establish Article \nIII standing. See supra Part I. Plaintiffs’ lack of standing extends to all of its claims against \nFederal Defendants, as the sole and tenuous thread of causation fails to tie Federal Defendant’s \nRule to District’s Plan. Once more, assuming Federal Defendants contributed to the \npromulgation of the Plan, granting Plaintiffs the relief they seek under RFRA would not cause \nOPINION & ORDER - 55 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01813-HZ    Document 69    Filed 07/24/18    Page 56 of 56\nDistrict to withdraw its Plan—which is the sole source of injury alleged in their RFRA claim. \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs’ RFRA claim is dismissed.  \nCONCLUSION \n  District, Federal Defendants, and BRO’s motions to dismiss [30] [31] [49] are \nGRANTED. The Court finds that Plaintiffs cannot plausibly re-allege their claims and that any \namendment would be futile. For the reasons discussed above, the Court dismisses with prejudice \nall of Plaintiffs’ claims. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is DENIED \nas moot. \n    Dated this         day of ______________________, 2018.                                    \n \n                                                                           \nMARCO A.

BARR\nArgued and Submitted July 11, 2019\nPortland, Oregon\nFiled February 12, 2020\nBefore:  A. Wallace Tashima, Susan P. Graber,\nand John B. Owens, Circuit Judges.\nOpinion by Judge Tashima\nSUMMARY*\nCivil Rights\nThe panel affirmed the district court’s dismissal of an\naction alleging that an Oregon public school district violated\nTitle IX, as well as the constitutional rights of students and of\nparents, when it allowed transgender students to use school\nbathrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  showers  that  match  their\ngender identity rather than the biological sex they were\nassigned at birth.  \nThe Dallas School District No. 2 implemented a Student\nSafety Plan after a student who had been born and who\nremained  biologically female publicly identified as a boy,\nand asked school officials to allow him to use the boys’\nbathroom and locker room.  The Plan acknowledged the\nstudent as a “transgender male” and permitted him to use the\nboys’ locker room and bathroom facilities with his peers. \n* This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.  It has\nbeen prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 3 of 55\nPARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR 3\nThe Plan provided that the student could use any of the\nbathrooms in the building to which he identified sexually. \nThe Student Safety Plan also provided, among other things,\nthat all staff would receive training and instruction regarding\nTitle IX, and that teachers would teach about anti-bullying\nand harassment. \nThe panel held that there is no Fourteenth Amendment\nfundamental  privacy  right  to  avoid  all  risk  of  intimate\nexposure to or by a transgender person who was assigned the\nopposite biological sex at birth.  Thus, the panel held that\nplaintiffs failed to show that the contours of the privacy right\nprotected by the Fourteenth Amendment were so broad as to\nprotect against the School District’s implementation of the\nStudent Safety Plan.  This conclusion was supported by the\nfact that the Student Safety Plan provided alternative options\nand privacy protections to those who did not want to share\nfacilities  with  a  transgender  student,  even  though  those\nalternative options  admittedly  appeared  inferior  and  less\nconvenient.\nThe panel held that the Student Safety Plan sought to\navoid discrimination and ensure the safety and well-being of\ntransgender students; it did not violate Title IX.  Thus, the\npanel held that a policy that treats all students equally does\nnot discriminate based on sex in violation of Title IX, and that\nthe  normal  use  of  privacy  facilities  does  not  constitute\nactionable sexual harassment under Title IX just because a\nperson is transgender.  The panel stated that just because Title\nIX authorizes sex-segregated facilities does not mean that\nthey are required, let alone that they must be segregated based\nonly  on  biological  sex  and  cannot  accommodate gender\nidentity.  Nowhere does the statute explicitly state, or even\nsuggest, that schools may not allow transgender students to\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 4 of 55\n4 PARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR\nuse the facilities that are most consistent with their gender\nidentity.  \nThe panel held that the Fourteenth Amendment does not\nprovide  a  fundamental  parental  right  to  determine  the\nbathroom policies of the public schools to which parents may\nsend their children, either independent of the parental right to\ndirect  the  upbringing and education of their children or\nencompassed by it.  The panel stated that given that Supreme\nCourt  and  Ninth  Circuit  case  law  not  only  have  not\nrecognized  the  specific  rights  asserted  by  plaintiffs,  but\nfurther  foreclosed  recognizing  such  rights  as  being\nencompassed by the fundamental parental rights protected by\nthe  Fourteenth  Amendment’s  Due  Process  Clause,\namendment of this claim would be futile.\nThe panel held that the Student Safety Plan was rationally\nrelated to a legitimate state purpose and did not infringe\nplaintiffs’ First Amendment free exercise rights because it did\nnot target religious conduct.  The panel held that because the\nStudent  Safety  Plan  qualified  as  neutral  and  generally\napplicable, it was not subject to strict scrutiny.  The panel\nrejected plaintiffs’ argument that strict scrutiny was required\nbecause  plaintiffs  alleged  multiple  constitutional  claims\nconcerning fundamental rights.\nThe panel concluded that the district court did not err by\nfailing  to  allow  plaintiffs  leave  to  replead  because  the\nproblem with plaintiffs’ complaint was not the sufficiency of\ntheir  factual  allegations,  but  rather  that  plaintiffs’  legal\ntheories failed.  Amending the complaint would not change,\nfor example, the extent of the rights that are protected by the\nFourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.   As a result,\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 5 of 55\nPARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR 5\nthe panel affirmed the district court’s denial of leave to\namend.\nCOUNSEL\nJ.

Plaintiffs oppose the school district’s\npolicy, asserting that it violates Title IX, as well as the\nconstitutional  rights—including  the  right  to  privacy,  the\nparental right to direct the education and upbringing of one’s\nchildren, and the right to freely exercise one’s religion—of\nstudents and of parents of students in the school district. \nDefendants and many amici highlight the importance of the\npolicy  for  creating  a  safe,  non-discriminatory  school\nenvironment  for  transgender  students  that  avoids  the\ndetrimental physical and mental health effects that have been\nshown to result from transgender students’ exclusion from\nprivacy facilities that match their gender identities.\nIt is clear that this case touches on deeply personal issues\nabout  which  many  have  strong  feelings  and  beliefs. \nMoreover, adolescence and the bodily and mental changes it\nbrings can be difficult for students, making bodily exposure\nto  other  students  in  locker  rooms  a  potential  source  of\nanxiety—and this is particularly true for transgender students\nwho experience gender dysphoria.

At the outset, we\nnote that it is not our role to pass judgment on the school\ndistrict’s policy or on how the school district can best fulfill\nits duty as a public educational institution.  We are asked only\nto resolve whether the school district’s policy violates Title\nIX or Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.\nIn a thorough and well-reasoned opinion, the district court\ndismissed the federal causes of action against the school\ndistrict for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be\ngranted.1  Parents for Privacy v.

We agree with the\ndistrict court and hold that there is no Fourteenth Amendment\nfundamental  privacy  right  to  avoid  all  risk  of  intimate\nexposure to or by a transgender person who was assigned the\nopposite biological sex at birth.  We also hold that a policy\nthat treats all students equally does not discriminate based on\nsex in violation of Title IX, and that the normal use of privacy\nfacilities does not constitute actionable sexual harassment\nunder Title IX just because a person is transgender.  We hold\nfurther that the Fourteenth Amendment does not provide a\nfundamental parental right to determine the bathroom policies\nof  the  public  schools  to  which  parents  may  send  their\nchildren, either independent of the parental right to direct the\nupbringing and education of their children or encompassed by\nit.

The Student Safety Plan also listed several\n“Safe  Adults”  with  whom  Student  A  could  share  any\nconcerns.\nStudent  A  began  using  the  boys’  locker  room  and\nchanging clothes “while male students were present.”  This\ncaused several cisgender boys “embarrassment, humiliation,\nanxiety, intimidation, fear, apprehension, and stress,” because\nthey had to change clothes for their PE class and attend to\ntheir  needs  while  someone  who  had  been  assigned  the\nopposite sex at birth was present.4  Although privacy stalls\nwere available in the bathrooms, these were insufficient to\nalleviate the cisgender boys’ fear of exposing themselves to\nStudent  A,  because  the  stalls  had  gaps  through  which\n“partially unclothed bodies” could “inadvertently” be seen. \nAnd  an  available  single-user  bathroom  was  often\ninconvenient or was considered inferior because it lacked a\nshower.  As a consequence of their fear of exposure to\nStudent A, some cisgender boys began using the restroom as\nlittle as possible while at school, and others risked tardiness\n4 In the District, PE is a mandatory course for two or more years of\nschool, and students must change into and out of clothing appropriate for\nPE class at the beginning and end of each PE class.  Some of the cisgender\nboys who had PE during the same class period as Student A changed into\ntheir PE clothes as quickly as possible as a result of their anxiety that\nStudent A might see them in a partial state of undress.\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 12 of 55\n12 PARENTS FOR PRIVACY V.

Some\nparents in the District are concerned and anxious about the\nprospect of their children using locker rooms or bathrooms\ntogether  with  a  student  who  was  assigned  the  opposite\nbiological  sex  at  birth.    The  Student  Safety  Plan  also\ninterferes with some parents’ preferred moral and/or religious\nteaching of their children concerning modesty and nudity.  In\naddition, several cisgender girls suffered from stress and\nanxiety as a result of their fear that a transgender girl student\nwho remains biologically male would be allowed to use the\ngirls’ locker room and bathroom.  Girls had the option of\nchanging in the nurse’s office, but it was on the other side of\nthe school.\nStudents who opposed the Student Safety Plan attempted\nto circulate a petition opposing the policy, but the high school\nprincipal confiscated the petitions and ordered students to\ndiscontinue doing so or face disciplinary action. Despite the\nobjections raised by several parents and students, the District\ncontinued to allow Student A to use the bathroom and locker\nroom that matched the gender with which he identified.\nII.\nIn  November  2017,  Plaintiffs-Appellants  Parents  for\nPrivacy, Parents’ Rights in Education, and several individuals\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 13 of 55\nPARENTS FOR PRIVACY V.

The\ncomplaint alleges eight claims:\n5 The individual plaintiffs are or were students (“Student Plaintiffs”)\nor parents of students (“Parent Plaintiffs”) in the District.  Specifically,\nPlaintiff Lindsay Golly formerly attended Dallas High School during the\n2015–2016 school year while the Plan was in place.

Subsequently, some of those guidance documents were\nwithdrawn,  and  others  were  later  superseded  by  contrary  guidance\ndocuments.  Plaintiffs asserted that, notwithstanding the withdrawal of the\nrelevant guidance documents, the Federal Defendants, in part, caused the\nDistrict to adopt the Student Safety Plan, because the guidance “has not\nbeen formally repealed, and it has continuing legal force and effect [that\nis] binding” upon the Dallas School District.

It explained that\n“[t]o hold otherwise would sweepingly expand the right to\nprivacy  beyond  what  any  court  has  recognized,”  in\ncontravention of the Supreme Court’s reluctance to expand\nthe “short list” of liberty rights protected by the Due Process\nClause, including “the rights to marry, to have children, to\ndirect the education and upbringing of one’s children, to\nmarital privacy, to use contraception, to bodily integrity, and\nto abortion.”  Id. at 1099 (quoting Glucksberg, 521 U.S.\nat 720).  Thus, because “[t]he potential threat that a high\nschool student might see or be seen by someone of the\nopposite  biological  sex  while  either  are  undressing  or\nperforming bodily functions in a restroom, shower, or locker\nroom does not give rise to a constitutional violation,” the\ndistrict court concluded that Plaintiffs failed to state a claim\nfor violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  See id.\n10 For further support for the obvious distinction between Plaintiffs’\ncited cases and the circumstances presented in this case, the district court\npointed to several out-of-circuit cases similar to this one in which courts\nalso rejected Plaintiffs’ purported privacy interest, in favor of transgender\nstudents’ access to school facilities.  Parents for Privacy, 326 F. Supp. 3d\nat 1093–96; see, e.g., Doe ex rel. Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch.

BARR\nOn appeal, Plaintiffs make several ultimately unavailing\narguments about why the district court erred in dismissing\ntheir privacy rights claim under the Fourteenth Amendment. \nFirst, they argue that the Ninth Circuit in York, 324 F.2d\nat  455,  recognized  the  right  to  bodily  privacy  when  it\ncommented that “[t]he desire to shield one’s unclothed figure\nfrom views of strangers, and particularly strangers of the\nopposite sex, is impelled by elementary self-respect and\npersonal dignity.”  The problem with this argument is that\nYork addressed an egregious privacy violation by police and\nrecognized a much more specific and limited Due Process\nprivacy right than Plaintiffs claim here.  As noted, York\ninvolved a male police officer who coerced a female assault\nvictim to allow him to take unnecessary nude photographs of\nher, which he later distributed to other officers.  See id.\nat 452.  In discussing the plaintiff’s claim for violation of her\nfundamental  right  to  privacy  under  the  Fourteenth\nAmendment, we explained:\nWe  are  not  called  upon  to  decide  as  an\noriginal  proposition  whether  ‘privacy,’  as\nsuch, is comprehended within the ‘liberty’ of\nwhich one may not be deprived without due\nprocess of law, as used in the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  For it\nhas already been declared by the Supreme\nCourt  that  the  security  of  one’s  privacy\nagainst arbitrary intrusion by the police is\nbasic  to  a  free  society  and  is  therefore\n‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,’\nembraced within the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.\nId. at 454–55 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 23 of 55\nPARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR 23\nThus, York recognized an established right to be free from\narbitrary  police  intrusions  upon  one’s  privacy  under  the\nFourth Amendment.  See id. at 455 (“A search of one’s home\nhas been established to be an invasion of one’s privacy\nagainst intrusion by the police, which, if ‘unreasonable,’ is\narbitrary and therefore banned under the Fourth Amendment. \nWe do not see how it can be argued that the searching of\none’s home deprives him of privacy, but the photographing\nof one’s nude body, and the distribution of such photographs\nto strangers does not.” (footnote omitted)).  Thus, York did\nnot recognize a more general right to be free from alleged\nprivacy intrusions by other non-government persons, or a\nprivacy right to avoid any risk of being exposed briefly to\nopposite-sex  nudity  by  sharing  locker  facilities  with\ntransgender students in public schools.\nMoreover, the actions that the Ninth Circuit concluded\nmade the police’s intrusion in York so arbitrary as to rise to\nthe level of a violation of the plaintiff’s privacy right under\nthe Due Process Clause were far more invasive than the\ntransgender student’s actions alleged in this case.  In York, we\nexplained:\n[W]e [cannot] imagine a more arbitrary police\nintrusion upon the security of [a person’s]\nprivacy  than  for  a  male  police  officer  to\nunnecessarily photograph the nude body of a\nfemale citizen who has made complaint of an\nassault upon her, over her protest that the\nphotographs would show no injuries, and at a\ntime when a female police officer could have\nbeen, but was not, called in for this purpose,\nand to distribute those photographs to other\npersonnel of the police department despite the\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 24 of 55\n24 PARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR\nfact that such distribution of the photographs\ncould not  have aided in  apprehending the\nperson who perpetrated the assault.\nId.  Here, Plaintiffs do not allege that transgender students are\ntaking nude photographs of them or purposefully taking overt\nsteps to invade their privacy for no legitimate reason.  Thus,\nbeyond failing to support the broad privacy right claimed by\nPlaintiffs, York is also readily distinguishable on its facts.\nNext, Plaintiffs point to out-of-circuit cases to argue that\nthe Fourteenth Amendment protects a “privacy interest in [a\nperson’s] partially clothed body.”  See, e.g., Doe v. Luzerne\nCounty, 660 F.3d 169, 175–76 & 176 n.5 (3d Cir. 2011).  But\nbeyond the fact that those cases are not binding, none of them\ndirectly supports Plaintiffs’ argument that the Constitution\naffords a broad privacy right protecting against being exposed\nin even a partial state of undress to any person of the opposite\nsex,  whether  or  not  they  are  a  government  actor.    For\nexample,  Luzerne  County  involved  the  unconsented  and\nsurreptitious filming of a female deputy sheriff by male\nsuperior officers while she was completely undressed, and the\nsubsequent sharing of the video footage and still photos.  See\nid. at 171–73, 175–78.  The Third Circuit analyzed whether\nthe public disclosure of those files violated constitutional\n“protect[ions]  against  public  disclosure  [of]  .  .  .  highly\npersonal matters representing the most intimate aspects of\nhuman affairs,” id. at 176 (second alteration in original)\n(quoting Nunez v. Pachman, 578, F.3d 228, 232 (3d Cir.\n2009), noting that “a person’s right to avoid disclosure of\npersonal  matters  is  not  absolute,”  id.  at  178,  because\n“[d]isclosure may be required if the government interest in\ndisclosure outweighs the individual’s privacy interest,” id.\n(quoting Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge No. 5 v. City of\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 25 of 55\nPARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR 25\nPhiladelphia, 812 F.2d 105, 110 (3d Cir. 1987)).  Thus, both\nthe facts and the legal issue in Luzerne are distinguishable\nfrom the case at bench, because this case does not involve a\nprivacy  intrusion  by  government  officers  or  the  public\ndisclosure of photos or video footage.11\nFinally, Plaintiffs attempt to support their Fourteenth\nAmendment argument by pointing to cases suggesting that\nproviding separate restrooms for males and females is not\nillegal, cases discussing Fourth Amendment violations, and\ncases  addressing  whether  Title  VII  protects  against\ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender\nidentity.    Those  cases,  however,  are  inapposite;  none\nestablishes a Fourteenth Amendment right to privacy that\nprotects against any risk of bodily exposure to a transgender\nstudent in school facilities.\nIn sum, Plaintiffs fail to show that the contours of the\nprivacy right protected by the Fourteenth Amendment are so\n11 Other cases cited by Plaintiffs are similarly inapposite.  Poe v.\nLeonard, 282 F.3d 123 (2d Cir. 2002), also involved the surreptitious and\nunconsented filming of a female officer by a male law enforcement\nofficer.  See id. at 138.  The court concluded that the plaintiff had stated\na claim for a violation of her Fourteenth Amendment privacy rights\nbecause the officer’s behavior constituted “arbitrary government action”\nthat  “shock[ed]  the  conscience”  and  was  “without  any  reasonable\njustification in the service of a legitimate governmental objective.”  Id.\nat 139 (quoting County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 845–46\n(1998)).  Again, the instant case does not involve an arbitrary privacy\nintrusion by a law enforcement officer in the form of unconsented filming.\nSimilarly, Canedy v. Boardman, 16 F.3d 183 (7th Cir. 1994), is\ndistinguishable because it involved a non-emergency strip search of a\nmale inmate by two female deputies, even though other male officers were\nnearby and could have conducted the search.  See id. at 184–85.\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 26 of 55\n26 PARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR\nbroad as to protect against the District’s implementation of\nthe Student Safety Plan.12  This conclusion is supported by\nthe fact that the Student Safety Plan provides alternative\noptions and privacy protections to those who do not want to\nshare facilities with a transgender student, even though those\nalternative  options  admittedly  appear  inferior  and  less\nconvenient.  See Caribbean Marine Servs. Co. v. Baldrige,\n844 F.2d 668, 678 (9th Cir. 1998) (suggesting that in cases in\nwhich  privacy  interests  must  be  weighed  against\ngovernmental interests, inconvenience and slight discomfort\nthat results from attempting to accommodate both interests\nare not enough to establish a privacy violation).\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court’s dismissal with\nprejudice of Plaintiffs’ claim for violation of privacy under\nthe  Fourteenth  Amendment’s  Due  Process  Clause.    See\nAlbright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 271 (1994) (holding that the\nplaintiff’s § 1983 claim failed where the plaintiff failed to\nestablish that he was deprived of a substantive due process\nright secured by the Constitution).  Because this claim is\npremised on the violation of an asserted right that, as a matter\n12 As a result, Plaintiffs’ argument that the District placed an\nunconstitutional condition on their privacy rights by implementing the\nStudent Safety Plan also fails.  If the asserted right is not protected by the\nConstitution, then any conditions that the District allegedly placed on the\nasserted right cannot be constitutionally impermissible.  See Koontz v. St.\nJohns River Water Mgmt. Dist., 570 U.S. 595, 604 (2013) (“[T]he\nunconstitutional conditions doctrine . . . vindicates the Constitution’s\nenumerated rights by preventing the government from coercing people\ninto giving them up.”).\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 27 of 55\nPARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR 27\nof law, is not protected by the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due\nProcess Clause, amendment of this claim would be futile.13\nB.\nNext, Plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in\nfailing to recognize that the District’s policy violates Title IX\nby turning locker rooms, showers, and multi-user restrooms\ninto sexually harassing environments and by forcing students\nto forgo use of such facilities as the solution to harassment.\nTitle IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States\nshall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in,\nbe denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination\nunder any education program or activity receiving Federal\nfinancial assistance . . . .”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  Plaintiffs\nallege that the Student Safety Plan violates Title IX because\nit “produces unwelcome sexual harassment and create[s] a\nhostile environment on the basis of sex.”  They allege that the\nPlan “needlessly subjects Student Plaintiffs to the risk that\ntheir partially or fully unclothed bodies will be exposed to\nstudents of the opposite sex and that they will be exposed to\nopposite-sex  nudity,  causing  the  Student  Plaintiffs  to\nexperience embarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, intimidation,\nfear, apprehension, stress, degradation, and loss of dignity.” \n13 Because we agree with the district court that the right to privacy on\nwhich Plaintiffs’ claim is premised is not protected by the Constitution, we\ndo not reach the district court’s further conclusions that:  (1) even if the\nright asserted by Plaintiffs were protected by the Constitution, the\npresence of a transgender student in school facilities does not infringe that\nright,  see  Parents for Privacy,  326  F.  Supp.  3d  at  1100–01;  and\n(2) policies permitting transgender access further a compelling state\ninterest in protecting transgender students from discrimination and are\nnarrowly tailored to satisfy strict scrutiny.

BARR\nAccording to Plaintiffs, “[a]llowing people to use restrooms,\nlocker  rooms  or  showers  designated  for  the  opposite\nbiological  sex  violates  privacy  and  creates  a  sexually\nharassing  environment,”  in  part  because  “[e]xposure  to\nopposite-sex  nudity  creates  a  sexually  harassing  hostile\nenvironment.”    As  a  result  of  this  allegedly  harassing\nenvironment, “all Student  Plaintiffs find that school has\nbecome intimidating and stressful,” and some of them “are\navoiding the restroom” and “are not able to concentrate as\nwell in school.”\nStating a Title IX hostile environment claim requires\nalleging that the school district:  (1) had actual knowledge of;\n(2)  and  was  deliberately  indifferent  to;  (3)  harassment\nbecause of sex that was;  (4) “so severe, pervasive, and\nobjectively offensive that it can be said to deprive the victims\nof access to the educational opportunities or benefits provided\nby the school.”  Davis ex rel. laShonda D. v. Monroe Cty. Bd.\nof  Educ.,  526  U.S.  629,  650  (1999);  see  also  Reese  v.\nJefferson Sch. Dist. No. 14J, 208 F.3d 736, 738–39 (9th Cir.\n2000).  The district court ruled that Plaintiffs had failed to\nestablish the third and fourth elements and, on that basis,\ndismissed Plaintiffs’ Title IX hostile environment claim. \nParents for Privacy, 326 F. Supp. 3d at 1104.\nThe district court concluded that the alleged harassment\nwas not discrimination on the basis of sex within the meaning\nof Title IX, because the “District’s plan does not target any\nStudent Plaintiff because of their sex.”  Id. at 1102.  Rather,\nthe Student Safety Plan applies to all students regardless of\ntheir  sex,  and  therefore  “Student  Plaintiffs  have  not\ndemonstrated that they are being treated any differently from\nother students at Dallas High School.”\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 29 of 55\nPARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR 29\nIn addition, the district court held that Plaintiffs failed to\nshow “that the District’s Plan discriminates because of sex, or\nthat it creates a severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive\nenvironment.”  Id. at 1104.  The court explained that, in\ncontrast to cases involving “egregious and persistent acts of\nsexual  violence  and  verbal  harassment,”  “[c]ourts  have\nrecognized that the presence of transgender people in an\nintimate setting does not, by itself, create a sexually harassing\nenvironment that is severe or pervasive.”  Id. at 1102; see\nalso id. at 1102–04 (discussing cases).  Noting Plaintiffs’\nfailure to cite supporting authority, the district court rejected\nPlaintiffs’ arguments that harassment was pervasive because\nthe District’s Plan is “widely applied” and that the Plan is\nobjectively offensive because sex-segregated facilities are the\nwell-established norm.  Id. at 1103–04.\nAgain, we agree with the district court’s analysis and find\nPlaintiffs’ contrary arguments unpersuasive.  First, Plaintiffs\nargue broadly that Title IX “unequivocally uphold[s] the right\nto bodily privacy” and therefore requires that facilities be\nsegregated based on “biological” sex rather than “gender\nidentity.”  To support this argument, Plaintiffs point out that\nthe  statute  provides  that  it  should  not  be  construed  to\n“prohibit any educational institution . . . from maintaining\nseparate living facilities for the different sexes,”  20 U.S.C.\n§  1686,  and  that  Title  IX’s  implementing  regulations\nspecifically  authorize  providing  separate  but  comparable\n“toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of\nsex,” 34 C.F.R. § 106.33.  Plaintiffs further argue that Title\nIX’s  text  and  its  legislative  history  make  clear  that  the\npermitted basis on which such “separate” facilities may be\nsegregated—“sex”— refers to “biological sex” as assigned at\nbirth, and cannot encompass gender identity.\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 30 of 55\n30 PARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR\nBut  just  because  Title  IX  authorizes  sex-segregated\nfacilities does not mean that they are required, let alone that\nthey must be segregated based only on biological sex and\ncannot accommodate gender identity.  Nowhere does the\nstatute explicitly state, or even suggest, that schools may not\nallow transgender students to use the facilities that are most\nconsistent with their gender identity.  That is, Title IX does\nnot specifically make actionable a school’s decision not to\nprovide facilities segregated by “biological sex”; contrary to\nPlaintiffs’ suggestion, the statute does not create distinct\n“bodily privacy rights” that may be vindicated through suit. \nInstead,  Title  IX  provides  recourse  for  discriminatory\ntreatment “on the basis of sex.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  Thus,\neven if Plaintiffs  are correct that “Congress intended to\npreserve distinct privacy facilities based on biological sex”\nand that the District chose not to do so, that fact alone is\ninsufficient to state a legally cognizable claim under Title IX. \nRather, to show that the District violated Title IX, Plaintiffs\nmust establish that the District had actual knowledge of and\nwas deliberately indifferent to harassment because of sex that\nwas “so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it\ncan be said to deprive the victims of access to the educational\nopportunities or benefits provided by the school.”  Davis,\n526 U.S. at 650; see also Reese, 208 F.3d at 739.\nPlaintiffs focus on the third and fourth elements of a Title\nIX hostile environment claim, as did the district court, namely\nwhether there was harassment because of sex that was so\nsevere, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it deprived\nPlaintiffs  of  access  to  the  educational  opportunities  or\nbenefits provided by Dallas High School.  First, Plaintiffs\nassert that the Student Safety Plan created harassment on the\nbasis of sex “because the only way to achieve the policy’s\npurpose of opposite-sex affirmation is to select facilities\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 31 of 55\nPARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR 31\nbased on the sex (or gender identity) of users.”  But just\nbecause the Student Safety Plan implicitly addresses the\ntopics  of sex and gender by seeking to  accommodate a\ntransgender student’s gender identity, or because it segregates\nfacilities by gender identity, does not mean that the Plan\nharasses other students on the basis of their sex.  As the\ndistrict court explained, the Plan does not target students or\ndiscriminate against  them on the basis of their sex;  the\nStudent  Safety  Plan  treats  all  students—male  and\nfemale—the same.  See Parents for Privacy, 326 F. Supp. 3d\nat 1096–97.\nPlaintiffs respond that the district court’s conclusion that\nthere was no harassment based on sex because the Student\nSafety  Plan  affects  all  students  equally  is  “legally  and\nlogically indefensible.”  Plaintiffs argue that the fact that the\nStudent Safety Plan affects both sexes does not preclude a\nTitle IX violation, because the Plan actually harasses both\nsexes on the basis of their sex by allowing students assigned\nthe opposite sex at birth to enter privacy facilities.  But\nPlaintiffs cite no authority to support the notion that “equal\nharassment” against both sexes is cognizable under Title IX.\nTo the contrary, treating both male and female students\nthe same suggests an absence of gender/sex animus, while\nTitle IX is aimed at addressing discrimination based on sex or\ngender stereotypes.  Numerous courts have ruled that a Title\nIX sexual harassment hostile environment claim fails where\nthe alleged harassment is inflicted without regard to gender\nor sex, i.e., where there is no discrimination.  See Doe ex rel.\nDoe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 276 F. Supp. 3d 324,\n394–95 (E.D. Pa. 2017) (collecting cases), aff’d, 897 F.3d\n518 (3d Cir. 2018), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 2636 (2019).  We\nsee  no  reason  to  arrive  at  a  different  conclusion  here. \n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 32 of 55\n32 PARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR\nPlaintiffs’ argument that the alleged harassment was “based\non sex” because it involved opposite-sex nudity conflates the\nbasis  for  the  perceived  harm—a  distinction  between\nbiological sexes—with the basis for the alleged harassment,\nwhich, as discussed above, Plaintiffs have not shown was\ndiscriminatory or motivated by any gender animus.  In sum,\nthe  district  court  correctly  ruled  that  Plaintiffs  failed  to\nestablish the third element of their Title IX claim.  See\nParents for Privacy, 326 F. Supp. 3d at 1102.\nThe district court also correctly ruled that Plaintiffs failed\nto establish the fourth element of their Title IX claim.  See id.\nat 1104.  Plaintiffs argue that they satisfy the fourth element\nof  a  hostile  environment  claim  because  the  alleged\nharassment is both viewed subjectively as harassment by the\nvictims and is, objectively, sufficiently severe or pervasive\nthat a reasonable person would agree that it is harassment. \nHowever, even crediting Plaintiffs’ subjective perceptions,\nunder  the  totality  of  the  circumstances,  the  alleged\nharassment  is  not  so  severe,  pervasive,  and  objectively\noffensive to rise to the level of a Title IX violation.  Plaintiffs\ndo  not  allege  that  transgender  students  are  making\ninappropriate  comments,  threatening  them,  deliberately\nflaunting  nudity,    or  physically  touching  them.    Rather,\nPlaintiffs allegedly feel harassed by the mere presence of\ntransgender students in locker and bathroom facilities.  This\ncannot be enough.  The use of facilities for their intended\npurpose,  without  more,  does  not  constitute  an  act  of\nharassment simply because a person is transgender.  See\nCruzan v. Special Sch. Dist., # 1, 294 F.3d 981, 984 (8th Cir.\n2002) (per curiam) (concluding that a transgender woman’s\n“merely being present in the women’s . . . restroom” did not\nconstitute actionable sexual harassment of her female co-\nworkers); cf.

BARR 35\nwhether their children, while at school, will have to risk\nexposing their own undressed or partially unclothed bodies to\nmembers  of  the  opposite  sex”  in  “intimate,  vulnerable\nsettings like restrooms, locker rooms and showers.”  Parent\nPlaintiffs claim that the District’s implementation of the\nStudent Safety Plan violates these rights, and therefore the\nFourteenth Amendment, because Parent Plaintiffs “do not\nwant their minor children to endure the risk of being exposed\nto the opposite sex . . . nor do they want their minor children\nto  attend  to  their  personal,  private  bodily  needs  in  the\npresence of members of the opposite sex.”  They explain that\nthey  “desire  to  raise  their  children  with  a  respect  for\ntraditional modesty, which requires that one not undress or\nuse the restroom in the presence of the opposite sex,” and that\nsome parents also object to the Student Safety Plan because\nof “sincerely-held religious beliefs.”\nThe district court disposed of this claim on the ground\nthat  the  fundamental  parental  right  protected  by  the\nFourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause is narrower\nthan Plaintiffs assert.  See Parents for Privacy, 326 F. Supp.\n3d at 1108–09.  The district court reasoned that although\nParent Plaintiffs have the right to choose where their children\nobtain an education, meaning that they have a right to remove\ntheir children from Dallas High School if they disapprove of\ntransgender student access to facilities, binding Ninth Circuit\nauthority  makes  clear  that  “Parent  Plaintiffs’  Fourteenth\nAmendment liberty interest in the education and upbringing\nof their children ‘does not extend beyond the threshold of the\nschool  door.’”    Id.  at  1109  (quoting  Fields,  427  F.3d\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 36 of 55\n36 PARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR\nat 1207).15  The district court thus disagreed with Plaintiffs’\nunsupported proposition that parents “retain the right  to\nprevent transgender students from sharing school facilities\nwith their children.”  Id.\nOn appeal, Parent Plaintiffs argue that the district court\nerroneously limited their fundamental parental rights.  They\nchallenge in particular the district court’s conclusion that\ntheir parental rights do not “extend beyond the threshold of\nthe school door.”  Plaintiffs, relying on Troxel, 530 U.S. at \n65–66 (quoting Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166\n(1944)), note that “the custody, care, and nurture of the child\nreside  first  in  the  parents,  whose  primary  function  and\nfreedom include preparation for obligations the state can\nneither supply nor hinder.”  But other than affirming that\nparents have a long-recognized constitutional right to “make\ndecisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their\nchildren,” Troxel lends no concrete support to Plaintiffs’\nspecific argument in this case.  Id. at 66.  Troxel concerned a\nstate government’s interference with a mother’s decision\nabout the amount of visitation with her daughters’ paternal\ngrandparents that was in her daughters’ best interests; it did\nnot address the extent of parents’ rights to direct the policies\nof the public schools that their children attend.16  See id.\n15 Although it does not affect the application of Fields to this case or\nthe merits of Plaintiffs’ substantive argument, it is worth noting that we\ndeleted the phrase “do[] not extend beyond the threshold of the school\ndoor” from the Fields opinion upon denial of rehearing.  See Fields, 427\nF.3d at 1190–91.\n16 Similarly, Plaintiffs’ reliance on Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205\n(1972), in their reply brief is unavailing.  In that case, the Supreme Court\nheld that the state of Wisconsin could not compel Amish parents to send\ntheir children to formal high school up to the age of 16, because as applied\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 37 of 55\nPARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR 37\nat 67–73.  Moreover, we have previously explained that\nalthough the Supreme Court “recognized that parents’ liberty\ninterest in the custody, care, and nurture of their children\nresides  ‘first’  in  the  parents,  [it]  does  not  reside  there\nexclusively, nor is it ‘beyond regulation [by the state] in the\npublic interest.’”  Fields, 427 F.3d at 1204 (second alteration\nin original) (quoting Prince, 321 U.S. at 166).\nNext, Plaintiffs attempt to distinguish Fields, the Ninth\nCircuit case on which the district court relied, by pointing out\nthat the instant case is not about curriculum, but rather “about\nconduct  authorized  by  the  school  allowing  opposite-sex\nstudents into privacy facilities.”  Fields involved conduct\nauthorized by the school allowing a researcher to administer\na survey that included questions about sexual topics.  Fields,\n427 F.3d at 1200–01.  We held that although “[p]arents have\na right to inform their children when and as they wish on the\nsubject of sex,” they “have no constitutional right . . . to\nprevent a public school from providing its students with\nwhatever  information  it  wishes  to  provide,  sexual  or\notherwise, when and as the school determines that it  is\nappropriate to do so.”  Id. at 1206.  While the purported risk\nof Parent Plaintiffs’ children being exposed to the unclothed\nbodies of students who were assigned the opposite sex at birth\ndoes not involve the provision of information, as did Fields,\nto the Amish parents in that case, doing so violated the Free Exercise\nClause of the First Amendment, and also interfered with “the traditional\ninterest of parents with respect to the religious upbringing of their\nchildren.”  Id. at 214; see also id. at 232–36.  Yoder supports the district\ncourt’s recognition that parents have the right to remove their children\nfrom Dallas High School, but it does not support Plaintiffs’ assertion that\ntheir parental rights go beyond that decision and extend to a right to\nrequire a particular bathroom access policy for transgender students.\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 38 of 55\n38 PARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR\nit similarly involves students being exposed to things of\nwhich their parents disapprove.\nIn any case, in Fields we adopted the Sixth Circuit’s view\nthat parents not only lack a constitutional right to direct the\ncurriculum that is taught to their children, but that they also\nlack  constitutionally  protected  rights  to  direct  school\nadministration more generally.  See id. at 1206 (rejecting a\n“curriculum exception”).  Specifically, we endorsed the Sixth\nCircuit’s explanation that:\nWhile parents may have a fundamental right\nto decide whether to send their child to a\npublic school, they do not have a fundamental\nright generally to direct how a public school\nteaches their child.  Whether it is the school\ncurriculum,  the  hours  of  the  school  day,\nschool discipline, the timing and content of\nexaminations, the individuals hired to teach at\nthe  school,  the  extracurricular  activities\noffered at the school or . . . a dress code, these\nissues  of  public  education  are  generally\ncommitted to the control of state and local\nauthorities.\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Blau v. Fort\nThomas Pub. Sch. Dist., 401 F.3d 381, 395–96 (6th Cir.\n2005)).  This binding precedent thus directly supports the\ndistrict  court’s  conclusion  that  Parent  Plaintiffs  lack  a\nfundamental right to direct Dallas High School’s bathroom\nand locker room policy.\nPlaintiffs nonetheless argue that, contrary to Fields, the\nSupreme  Court  has  extended  parental  rights  into  the\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 39 of 55\nPARENTS FOR PRIVACY V.

Specifically, they argue that the Supreme Court\nhas ruled that students from Jehovah’s Witness families could\nnot  be  compelled  to  recite  the  Pledge  of  Allegiance  at\nschool.17  See W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S.\n624, 642 (1943).  But that Supreme Court decision rested on\nthe First Amendment;18 nowhere did the Supreme Court\nreference the fundamental rights of parents to direct their\nchildren’s upbringing.19  See Barnette, 319 U.S. at 639, 642. \nThus, Plaintiffs fail to cite any Supreme Court authority\n17 Plaintiffs cite Minersville School District v. Gobitis, 310 U.S. 586,\nfor this proposition, but Gobitis actually held the opposite—namely, that\nthe government could require students to salute the flag.  The Supreme\nCourt, however, overruled Gobitis three years later in West Virginia State\nBoard of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943).  Thus, we\nassume that Plaintiffs actually intended to cite Barnette, particularly\nbecause their Gobitis’ pincite of “642” appears in Barnette, but not in\nGobitis.\n18 Similarly, Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School\nDistrict, 393 U.S. 503 (1969), and Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479 (1960),\nboth of which Plaintiffs cite in their reply, also rested on the First\nAmendment and its protection of students’ and teachers’ freedoms of\nspeech and association.\n19 Moreover, unlike the instant case, Barnette involved “a compulsion\nof students to declare a belief.”  Barnette, 319 U.S. at 631.  The Student\nSafety Plan does not compel a declaration of support for any particular\nbelief.  And in Barnette, the Court also noted that the appellees’ asserted\nfreedom not to salute the flag “does not bring them into collision with\nrights asserted by any other individual.”  Id. at 630.  Here, in contrast,\nPlaintiffs’ asserted right not to be exposed to any risk of seeing in a state\nof undress (or being seen by) any person who was assigned the opposite\nsex at birth does “bring them into collision with rights asserted by . . .\nother[s],” namely the rights of transgender students to use the locker\nrooms that match their gender identity and to avoid being subject to\ndiscrimination based on gender stereotypes regarding the sex assigned to\nthem at birth.  See id.\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 40 of 55\n40 PARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR\nshowing that parents’ substantive due process rights under the\nFourteenth  Amendment  encompass  a  right  to  direct  the\ncurriculum, administration, or policies of public schools.\nFinally, perhaps recognizing the lack of supporting case\nlaw, Plaintiffs argue that the following items both “undercut[]\nthe district court’s unprincipled expansion of Fields” and\nsupport the constitutional parental rights that Plaintiffs assert: \n(1) that “no one would seriously suggest [that] parents lack\nany means to assure their students are free from physical\nassault, coercive threats[,]  or  criminal activity”; (2) that\n“federal law and Oregon law confer on parents the right to\ninspect  instructional  materials  upon  request”;  (3)  that\nCongress in 2002 “enacted a federal law that no student can\nbe required to take a survey concerning sexual behavior or\nattitudes unless the school provides parents with the survey\nbefore administering the survey to students and receives\nconsent to administer the survey”; and (4) that “many states,\nincluding Oregon, have in place laws regulating public school\neducation that require schools to allow parents to opt their\nchildren out of certain situations concerning sexual right [sic]\nand sex education.”  However, those assertions, even if true,\ndo  not  establish  that  the  Fourteenth  Amendment’s  Due\nProcess Clause protects the right asserted by Plaintiffs in this\ncase.  Although state and federal statutes may expand upon\nconstitutional protections by creating new statutory rights,\nstatutes  do  not  alter  the  protections  afforded  by  the\nConstitution itself.20\n20 Plaintiffs provide no citation suggesting that the statutes they cite\nwere enacted in order to enforce existing constitutional parental rights. \nRather, the opposite inference—that the statutes were enacted to create\nrights  specifically  because  the  Constitution  does  not  protect  such\nrights—may be the more reasonable one.  Cf. Holt v. Hobbs, 135 S. Ct.\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 41 of 55\nPARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR 41\nIn sum, Plaintiffs fail to cite any authority that supports\ntheir asserted fundamental Fourteenth Amendment parental\nright to “determine whether and when their children will have\nto risk being exposed to opposite sex nudity at school” and\n“whether their children, while at school, will have to risk\nexposing their own undressed or partially unclothed bodies to\nmembers  of  the  opposite  sex”  in  “intimate,  vulnerable\nsettings like restrooms, locker rooms and showers.”  In fact,\nFields makes clear that the fundamental right to control the\nupbringing  of  one’s  children  does  not  extend  so  far  as\nPlaintiffs’ hypothesize.  See Fields, 427 F.3d at 1206–07. \nPlaintiffs neither distinguish this precedent nor address the\npractical issue raised by Fields:  that accommodating the\ndifferent “personal, moral, or religious concerns of every\nparent” would be “impossible” for public schools, because\ndifferent parents would often likely, as in this case, prefer\nopposite and contradictory outcomes.  Id. at 1206.  As a\nresult,  Plaintiffs’  legal  theory  fails.    Considering  that\nSupreme Court and Ninth Circuit case law not only have not\nrecognized  the  specific  rights  asserted  by  Plaintiffs,  but\nfurther  forecloses  recognizing  such  rights  as  being\nencompassed by the fundamental parental rights protected by\nthe  Fourteenth  Amendment’s  Due  Process  Clause,\namendment of this claim would be futile.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s\ndismissal with prejudice of this claim.\n853, 859–60 (2015) (“Following our decision in Employment Division,\nDepartment of Human Resources of Oregon v.

Smith,\n494 U.S. 872 877 (1990), superseded by statute in other\ncontexts  as  stated  in  Holt,  135  S.  Ct.  at  859–60.    The\nSupreme Court has explained that the First Amendment \n“obviously excludes all ‘governmental regulation of religious\nbeliefs as such,’” meaning that “[t]he government may not\ncompel affirmation of religious belief, punish the expression\nof religious doctrines it believes to be false, impose special\ndisabilities on the basis of religious views or religious status,\nor lend its power to one or the other side in controversies over\nreligious  authority  or  dogma.”    Id.  (citations  omitted)\n(quoting Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 402 (1963)).  The\nSupreme Court has also suggested that the government would\ninterfere with the free exercise of religion impermissibly if it\nsought to ban the performance of or abstention from certain\nphysical acts, but “only when [those acts] are engaged in for\nreligious reasons, or only because of the religious belief that\nthey  display.”    Id.

Specifically, the complaint alleges that\nmany Student Plaintiffs and some Parent Plaintiffs “have the\nsincere religious belief” that children “must not undress, or\nuse the restroom, in the presence of a member of the opposite\nbiological sex, and also that they must not be in the presence\nof the opposite biological sex while the opposite biological\nsex  is  undressing  or  using  the  restroom.”    Because  the\nStudent Safety Plan permits transgender students who were\nassigned the opposite biological sex at birth into their locker\nrooms, the Plan “prevents Student Plaintiffs from practicing\nthe modesty that their faith requires of them, and it further\ninterferes  with  Parent  Plaintiffs  teaching  their  children\ntraditional modesty and insisting that their children practice\nmodesty, as their faith requires.”  Plaintiffs further assert that,\nas a result, “[c]omplying with the requirements of the Student\nSafety Plan . . . places a substantial burden on the Plaintiffs’\nexercise of religion by requiring Plaintiffs to choose between\nthe benefit of a free public education and violating their\nreligious beliefs.”\nThe district court dismissed this claim on the basis that\nthe Student Safety Plan was neutral and generally applicable\nwith  respect  to  religion,  noting  that  “neutral,  generally\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 44 of 55\n44 PARENTS FOR PRIVACY V.

The district court\nrejected Plaintiffs’ assertion that, because the Plan pertains\nspecifically to Student A, the Plan is not generally applicable. \nId.  The court, citing Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 532–33, explained\nthat “Plaintiffs misunderstand the law,” because neutrality\nand general applicability are “considered with respect to\nreligion” rather than with respect to the person or groups to\nwhich the law most directly pertains.

Because the District’s Plan did not\nforce any Plaintiff to embrace a religious belief and did not\npunish  anyone  for  expressing  their  religious  beliefs,  the\ndistrict court concluded that the Plan is “neutral and generally\napplicable with respect to religion,” and therefore did not\nviolate Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights.

Wiesman,\n794 F.3d 1064, 1076 (9th Cir. 2015) (ellipsis in original)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).  As the district court\ncorrectly explained, the two tests for whether a law is neutral\nand generally applicable focus on whether a law specifically\ntargets or singles out religion.  See Parents for Privacy,\n326 F. Supp. 3d at 1110; Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 532 (“[T]he\nprotections of the Free Exercise Clause pertain if the law at\nissue discriminates against some or all religious beliefs or\nregulates or prohibits conduct because it is undertaken for\nreligious reasons.”).\nFirst, “if the object of a law is to infringe upon or restrict\npractices because of their religious motivation, the law is not\nneutral.”    Selecky,  586  F.3d  at  1130  (emphasis  added)\n(quoting Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 533).  For example, “[a] law\nlacks  facial neutrality  if  it  refers  to  a  religious  practice\nwithout a secular meaning discernable from the language or\ncontext.”  Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 533.  Even if a law is facially\nneutral, it may nonetheless fail the neutrality test if “[t]he\nrecord . . . compels the conclusion that suppression of [a\nreligion  or  religious  practice]  was  the  object  of  the\nordinances.”  Id. at 534, 542.  Thus, in Lukumi, the Supreme\nCourt concluded that an animal ordinance that in its operation\neffectively banned only the ritual animal sacrifice performed\nby practitioners of the Santeria religion, was not neutral\nbecause it accomplished a “religious gerrymander,” i.e., an\nimpermissible attempt to target religious practices through\ncareful legislative drafting.  See id. at 535–37.\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 46 of 55\n46 PARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR\nHere, on the other hand, Plaintiffs’ complaint contains no\nallegation  suggesting  that  the  Student  Safety  Plan  was\nadopted  with  the  object  of  suppressing  the  exercise  of\nreligion.  To the contrary, Plaintiffs allege that the District\ndeveloped  and  implemented  the  Student  Safety  Plan  in\n“response to the threat of [federal] enforcement action” and\nin “response to Student A’s complaints for accommodation.” \nMoreover, the Student Safety Plan “make[s] no reference to\nany religious practice, conduct, belief, or motivation.”  See\nWiesman, 794 F.3d at 1076.  Instead, the Plan itself states that\nit was “created to support a transgender male expressing the\nright to access the boy’s locker room at Dallas High School.” \nPlaintiffs do not counter this evidence or point to anything in\nthe  record  suggesting  that  the  Student  Safety  Plan  was\nadopted with the specific purpose of infringing on Plaintiffs’\nreligious  practices  or  suppressing  Plaintiffs’  religion. \nAccordingly, the district court correctly concluded that the\nStudent Safety Plan is neutral for purposes of analyzing the\nfree exercise claim.\nSecond, the question of general applicability addresses\nwhether a law treats religious observers unequally.  See\nLukumi, 508 U.S. at 542.  For example, “inequality results\nwhen a legislature decides that the governmental interests it\nseeks to advance are worthy of being pursued only against\nconduct with a religious motivation.”  Id. at 542–43.  Thus,\n“[a]  law  is  not  generally  applicable  if  its  prohibitions\nsubstantially underinclude non-religiously motivated conduct\nthat might endanger the same governmental interest that the\nlaw is designed to protect.”  Wiesman, 794 F.3d at 1079\n(citing Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 542–46).  “In other words, if a\nlaw pursues the government’s interest ‘only against conduct\nmotivated by religious belief,’ but fails to include in its\nprohibitions  substantial,  comparable secular conduct that\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 47 of 55\nPARENTS FOR PRIVACY V.

For  example,  in  Lukumi,  the  Court\nconcluded that the challenged ordinances were not generally\napplicable because they “pursue[d] the city’s governmental\ninterests only against conduct motivated by religious belief”\nand  “fail[ed]  to  prohibit  nonreligious  conduct  that\nendanger[ed] these interests in a similar or greater degree\nthan Santeria sacrifice does.”  Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 543, 545;\nsee also Selecky, 586 F.3d at 1134.\nHere,  the  Student  Safety  Plan  is  not  underinclusive,\nbecause it does not require only religious students to share a\nlocker room with a transgender student who was assigned the\nopposite sex at birth, nor does the Plan require only religious\nteachers and staff to receive training or to teach about anti-\nbullying and harassment.  In other words, the Student Safety\nPlan affects all students and staff—it does not place demands\non  exclusively  religious  persons  or  conduct.    Plaintiffs’\nsingular  argument  that  the  Student  Safety  Plan  is\nunderinclusive because it was aimed at a particular student\nand does not allow every student to use the facilities of their\nchoosing regardless of biological sex or self-identified gender\nmisses the mark because it misunderstands the applicable test. \nUnderinclusiveness is determined with respect to the burdens\non  religious  and  non-religious  conduct  and  the  interests\nsought to be advanced by the policy.  That  the Student Safety\nPlan focuses on transgender students rather than allowing all\nstudents to claim a right to use whichever facility they wish\nregardless  of  gender  is  irrelevant  because  that  alleged\nunderinclusion is not related to the interests furthered by the\nplan, and Plaintiffs have not tied it to burdens on secular\nversus religious conduct.  The correct inquiry here is whether,\nin  seeking  to  create  a  safe,  non-discriminatory  school\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 48 of 55\n48 PARENTS FOR PRIVACY V.

Because Plaintiffs have not made any\nshowing that the Plan does so, the district court correctly\ndetermined that the Plan is generally applicable for purposes\nof the free exercise analysis.  See Parents for Privacy, 326 F.\nSupp. 3d at 1110.\nBecause the Student Safety Plan qualifies as neutral and\ngenerally applicable, it is not subject to strict scrutiny.  See\nSelecky,  586  F.3d  at  1129  (“[A]  neutral  law  of  general\napplicability will not be subject to strict scrutiny review.”);\nsee also Smith, 494 U.S. at 888 (“Precisely because we are a\ncosmopolitan nation made up of people of almost every\nconceivable religious preference, and precisely because we\nvalue and protect that religious divergence, we cannot afford\nthe luxury of deeming presumptively invalid, as applied to the\nreligious objector, every regulation of conduct that does not\nprotect an interest of the highest order.” (citation and internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\nPlaintiffs argue that strict scrutiny should nevertheless\napply because this suit concerns the alleged infringement of\nmultiple constitutional rights.  Relying on Smith, 494 U.S. at\n882,  they  argue  that  “[w]here,  as  here,  plaintiffs  allege\nmultiple  fundamental  rights  arising  under  the  First  and\nFourteenth Amendments (bodily privacy, parental rights and\nfree exercise rights), hybrid rights analysis requires strict\nscrutiny as well.”  The district court rejected this argument\nbecause  it  had  already  dismissed  Plaintiffs’  other\nconstitutional claims.  See Parents for Privacy, 326 F. Supp.\n3d at 1110 n.10.  For the following reasons, we agree with\nthe district court that Plaintiffs’ argument—that strict scrutiny\nis  required  simply  because  Plaintiffs  alleged  multiple\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 49 of 55\nPARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR 49\nconstitutional claims concerning fundamental rights—fails\nhere.\nThe extent to which the hybrid rights exception truly\nexists, and what standard applies to it, is unclear.  In Smith,\nthe Court noted that “[t]he only decisions in which we have\nheld that the First Amendment bars application of a neutral,\ngenerally applicable law to religiously motivated action have\ninvolved not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free\nExercise Clause  in  conjunction  with  other  constitutional\nprotections.”  Smith, 494 U.S. at 881.  However, Smith did\n“not present such a hybrid situation,” and thus the Court did\nnot further explain how a hybrid rights scenario should be\nscrutinized.  See id. at 882.  The Ninth Circuit subsequently\ndiscussed the nature of “hybrid rights” at length, and a three-\njudge  panel majority concluded that, “[i]n order to trigger\nstrict scrutiny, a hybrid-rights plaintiff must show a ‘fair\nprobability’—a ‘likelihood’—of success on the merits of his\ncompanion claim.”  Thomas v. Anchorage Equal Rights\nComm’n, 165 F.3d 692, 706 (9th Cir.), reh’g granted, opinion\nwithdrawn, 192 F.3d 1208 (9th Cir. 1999).  The dissent,\nhowever, noted that “there is real doubt whether the hybrid-\nrights exception even exists” because “the Supreme Court\nitself has never explicitly held that it exists.”  Id. at 722–23\n(Hawkins,  J.,  dissenting).    “[T]he  paragraph  in  Smith\npurporting to carve out a hybrid-rights exception is dicta,”\n“the Supreme Court in Smith did not announce a different test\nfor hybrid-rights cases,” and “[e]ven the cases which the\nSupreme Court cited as involving ‘hybrid rights’ did not\nexplicitly refer to or invoke strict scrutiny or a compelling\ngovernment interest test.”  Id. at 723–24.  In any case, that\nopinion discussing the appropriate hybrid rights test in our\nCircuit was withdrawn upon granting rehearing en banc, and\nthe en banc court did not address the hybrid rights issue.  See\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 50 of 55\n50 PARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR\nThomas v. Anchorage Equal Rights Comm’n, 220 F.3d 1134,\n1148 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (noting that “we postpone . . .\napplication  of  [Smith’s]  newly  developed  hybrid  rights\ndoctrine”) (O’Scannlain, J., concurring).\nMoreover, Miller v. Reed, the Ninth Circuit case that\nPlaintiffs cite as the basis for the hybrid rights exception in\nour Circuit, was decided after the panel opinion in Thomas\nwas issued, but before the three-judge opinion was withdrawn\nupon  granting  rehearing  en  banc.    See  Miller  v.  Reed,\n176 F.3d 1202 (9th Cir. 1999).  Thus, no weight can be given\nto Miller’s citation to the Thomas panel opinion for the\nsuggestion  that  the  hybrid  rights  exception  has  been\nestablished in our Circuit.  See id. at 1207 (“[W]e recently\nheld that, to assert a hybrid-rights claim, ‘a free exercise\nplaintiff must make out a “colorable claim” that a companion\nright has been violated—that is, a “fair probability” or a\n“likelihood,” but not a certitude, of success on the merits.’”\n(quoting Thomas, 165 F.3d at 703, 707)).  There is therefore\nno binding Ninth Circuit authority deciding the issue of\nwhether the hybrid rights exception exists and requires strict\nscrutiny.\nNonetheless, we need not resolve that question now,\nbecause even if a hybrid rights exception does exist, it would\nnot apply in this case.  For the reasons discussed in the\nThomas panel opinion, alleging multiple failing constitutional\nclaims that do not have a likelihood of success on the merits\ncannot be enough to invoke a hybrid rights exception and\nrequire strict scrutiny.  See Thomas, 165 F.3d at 703–07; cf.\nid. at 705 (“[A] plaintiff invoking Smith’s hybrid exception\nmust make out a ‘colorable claim’ that a companion right has\nbeen infringed.”); Miller, 176 F.3d at 1207–08 (collecting\ncases and noting that “[o]ther circuits have adopted . . .\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 51 of 55\nPARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR 51\npredicates for a hybrid-rights claim” that are “similar or more\nstringent” than the standard adopted in Thomas, and holding\nthat “a plaintiff does not allege a hybrid-rights claim entitled\nto strict scrutiny analysis merely by combining a free exercise\nclaim with an utterly meritless claim of the violation of\nanother alleged fundamental right or a claim of an alleged\nviolation of a non-fundamental or non-existent right”).  As\nexplained  earlier  in  this  opinion,  Plaintiffs  have  not\nestablished  colorable  companion  claims—they  have  not\nshown even a likelihood of success, which is why their claims\nwere all dismissed with prejudice.  Thus, even if the hybrid\nrights exception does exist, it would not apply to require strict\nscrutiny in this case.  Alternatively, if the hybrid rights\nexception does not actually exist, then, of course, it cannot\napply to this case to require strict scrutiny of Plaintiffs’\npurported  hybrid  claims.    Cf.  Leebaert  v.  Harrington,\n332 F.3d 134, 143 (2d Cir. 2003) (“Several circuits have\nstated  that  Smith  mandates  stricter  scrutiny  for  hybrid\nsituations than for a free exercise claim standing alone, but,\nas far as we are able to tell, no circuit has yet actually applied\nstrict scrutiny based on this theory.”); Catholic Charities of\nSacramento, Inc. v. Superior Court, 85 P.3d 67, 88 (Cal.\n2004) (explaining that a rule requiring only a “colorable” and\nnot an “ultimately meritorious” companion claim would not\nmake sense because it would allow the hybrid exception to\nswallow  the  Smith  rule,  and  noting  that  the  California\nSupreme Court was “aware of no decision in which a federal\ncourt has actually relied solely on the hybrid rights theory to\njustify applying strict scrutiny to a free exercise claim”).\nIn sum, whether the hybrid rights exception exists and\nrequires at least a colorable companion claim, or whether it\ndoes not really exist at all—an issue that we do not resolve\nhere—Plaintiffs’ argument that the hybrid rights exception\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 52 of 55\n52 PARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR\nrequires that we apply strict scrutiny to their free exercise\nclaim fails.  Because strict scrutiny does not apply, we also\nneed not address Plaintiffs’ arguments about narrow tailoring.\nInstead, we review the Plan for a rational basis, which\nmeans that the Plan must be upheld if it is rationally related\nto  a  legitimate  governmental  purpose.    See  Wiesman,\n794 F.3d at 1084; see also Selecky, 586 F.3d at 1127–28\n(“Under the governing standard, ‘a law that is neutral and of\ngeneral applicability need not be justified by a compelling\ngovernmental interest even if the law has the incidental effect\nof  burdening  a  particular  religious  practice.’”  (quoting\nLukumi, 508 U.S. at 531)).  “Plaintiffs ‘have the burden to\nnegate every conceivable basis which might support [the\nPlan].’”  Wiesman, 794 F.3d at 1084 (brackets omitted)\n(quoting  FCC v. Beach Commc’ns, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 315\n(1993)).  They fail to meet that burden, because they fail to\nnegate what the record makes clear:  the Student Safety Plan\nis rationally related to the legitimate purpose of protecting\nstudent safety and well-being, and eliminating discrimination\non the basis of sex and transgender status.  Cf. New York v.\nFerber, 458 U.S. 747, 756–57 (1982) (explaining that “a\nState’s  interest  in  ‘safeguarding  the  physical  and\npsychological  well-being  of  a  minor’  is  ‘compelling’”\n(quoting Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, 457 U.S.\n596, 607 (1982))); Goehring v. Brophy, 94 F.3d 1294, 1300\n(9th Cir. 1996) (holding that a university had a compelling\ninterest in the “health and well-being of its students”).21 \n21 In their arguments regarding the compelling governmental interest\nthat would be required if we were to apply strict scrutiny, Plaintiffs argue\nthat “[t]he relevant government interest . . . cannot be a general interest in\nprohibiting discrimination because that position has already been rejected\nby the Supreme Court in Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian &\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 53 of 55\nPARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR 53\nPlaintiffs’  argument  that  the  Supreme  Court  has  also\nrecognized  bodily  privacy  as  a  compelling  interest  is\nunavailing,  because  it  does  not  negate  the  fact  that  the\nStudent Safety Plan has a rational basis.  Thus, we conclude\nthat because the Student Safety Plan is neutral, generally\napplicable, and rationally related to a legitimate governmental\npurpose, the Plan does not impermissibly burden Plaintiffs’\nFirst  Amendment  free  exercise  rights.    See  Wiesman,\n794 F.3d at 1085.  And because Plaintiffs have not shown that\nany new factual allegations could alter these conclusions\nbased on settled precedent, amendment would be futile.\nBisexual Group of Boston, 515 U.S. 557, 573 (1995).”  But Hurley is\ninapposite because that was a free speech case; the Supreme Court’s\nsuggestion in Hurley that a broad statutory objective of forbidding\ndiscriminatory speech in public parades would be “fatal” because “[o]ur\ntradition of free speech commands that a speaker who takes to the street\ncorner to express his views in this way should be free from interference by\nthe State based on the content of what he says” is hardly surprising or\ncontroversial.  See id. at 578–79.  That statement in Hurley certainly does\nnot preclude the District here from asserting an interest in providing an\naccommodating and safe school environment for transgender students and\nassuring that they do not suffer the stigmatizing injury of discrimination\nby being denied access to multi-user bathrooms that match their gender\nidentity.  And in fact, the Supreme Court has recognized repeatedly that\nthe government has a compelling interest “of the highest order” in\n“eliminating discrimination and assuring its citizens equal access to\npublicly available goods and services.”  Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S.\n609, 624 (1984); see also id. at 623, 628 (noting that “acts of invidious\ndiscrimination in the distribution of publicly available goods, services, and\nother advantages cause unique evils that government has a compelling\ninterest to prevent,” and holding that “Minnesota’s compelling interest in\neradicating discrimination against its female citizens justifies the impact\nthat application of the statute to the Jaycees may have on the male\nmembers’ associational freedoms”). \n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 54 of 55\n54 PARENTS FOR PRIVACY V. BARR\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the dismissal with\nprejudice of Plaintiffs’ First Amendment free exercise claim.\nV.\nFinally, Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in\nfailing  to  allow  Plaintiffs  leave  to  replead.    Although\nPlaintiffs correctly point out that leave to amend should be\nliberally  granted  if  the  complaint  can  be  saved  by\namendment, Plaintiffs have not shown, either in their briefing\nor at oral argument, how they could amend their complaint to\nremedy the many legal deficiencies in their claims.  Instead,\nPlaintiffs simply argue that their complaint, as currently\nalleged, is sufficient to state their claims because their claims\n“were not conclusory; rather, they were extensive, well-\narticulated statements of fact that clearly pleaded claims for\nrelief” and “exceeded both the Twombly and Iqbal standards.”\nThe problem with Plaintiffs’ complaint, however, is not\nthe sufficiency of their factual allegations.  Rather, as we\nhave  explained  above,  Plaintiffs’  legal  theories  fail. \nAmending the complaint will not change, for example, the\nextent of the rights that are protected by the Fourteenth\nAmendment’s Due Process Clause.  As a result, we affirm the\ndistrict  court’s  denial  of  leave  to  amend.22    Further\n22 Because we affirm the dismissal with prejudice of Plaintiffs’\ncomplaint,  we  do  not  reach  the  district  court’s  determination  that\nPlaintiffs’ requested relief—a court order requiring transgender students\nto use single-user  facilities or facilities that match their biological\nsex—would itself violate Title IX because it “would punish transgender\nstudents  for  their  gender  nonconformity  and  constitute  a  form  of\n[impermissible] sex-stereotyping.”  Parents for Privacy, 326 F. Supp. 3d\nat 1106 (citing Whitaker ex rel. Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1048–50.\n\nCase: 18-35708, 02/12/2020, ID: 11594225, DktEntry: 99-1, Page 55 of 55\nPARENTS FOR PRIVACY V.

A policy that\nallows transgender students to use school bathroom and\nlocker facilities that match their self-identified gender in the\nsame manner that cisgender students utilize those facilities\ndoes not infringe Fourteenth Amendment privacy or parental\nrights or First Amendment free exercise rights, nor does it\ncreate actionable sex harassment under Title IX.\nAccordingly, Plaintiffs have failed to state a federal claim\nupon which relief can be granted.
