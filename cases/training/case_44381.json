    "summary": "<p>The case involves a challenge brought by cisgender students against their school&rsquo;s gender-affirming policies for transgender students.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 21, 2017 a cisgender student brought suit in the U.S. District Court Eastern District of Pennsylvania against Boyertown Area School District and several school officials in their official capacity. Represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, Plaintiff alleged that the School District&rsquo;s policy of allowing transgender students to use the facilities aligned with their gender-identity violated Plaintiff&rsquo;s Fourteenth Amendment right to bodily privacy, &nbsp;a violation of cisgender students&rsquo; privacy, in violation of the 14th Amendment&rsquo;s right to privacy and the Pennsylvania common law right of privacy. Plaintiff further alleged that the policy violated Title IX, as it allegedly violated privacy and created a &ldquo;sexually harassing hostile environment.&rdquo; Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as compensatory damages and fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Edward Smith.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 3, 2017 a transgender student and the Pennsylvania Youth Congress moved to intervene as defendants. They were represented by the ACLU. On May 24, 2017 the court granted the motion to intervene in part, allowing the Pennsylvania Youth Congress to intervene. On July 6, 2017 the court denied the transgender student&rsquo;s motion to intervene.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 18, 2017 plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding additional cisgender students as plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>On August 25, 2017 the court denied plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found that plaintiffs were not likely to succeed on the merits of their constitutional cause of action because plaintiffs had not identified any court which had recognized a constitutional right to be free from the risk of intimate exposure to the opposite sex, and even if they had, plaintiffs had provided no evidence that their protected privacy interest had been violated. Plaintiffs could not succeed on their Title IX cause of action because the school&rsquo;s policy treated everyone the same regardless of sex and because plaintiffs had not identified any conduct that was sufficient to constitute Title IX harassment. The court found that plaintiff&rsquo;s common law cause of action was unlikely to succeed because a reasonable person would not be offended by the presence of a transgender student in the bathroom or locker room with them. The court also found plaintiffs had failed to show irreparable harm, as the school district provides single-user changing facilities which are available to all students and displayed an overall willingness to work with students to ensure they are comfortable.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs appealed the preliminary injunction denial to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. On June 18, 2018 the Third Circuit affirmed the district court&rsquo;s opinion along the same reasons identified by the lower court.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 26, 2018 the Third Circuit granted a petition for rehearing and vacated their June 18th opinion, but did not grant a petition for rehearing en banc. The same day, the Third Circuit issued a new opinion, which still affirmed the district court&rsquo;s decision. Like the lower court, the Third Circuit found that &ldquo;the presence of transgender students in the locker and restrooms is no more offensive to constitutional or Pennsylvania-law privacy interests than the presence of the other students who are not transgender&rdquo; and that Title IX does not require an institution to provide separate privacy facilities for the sexes, plaintiffs had not presented evidence sufficient to bring a &ldquo;hostile environment harassment&rdquo; cause of action.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 10, 2018 plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court. The Court denied their petition on May 28, 2019.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 5, 2019 the district court denied plaintiffs&rsquo; motion to stay the case pending resolution of three Supreme Court cases - <em>Bostock v. Clayton County, Altitude Express v. Zarda</em> and <em>R.G. &amp; G.R. Harris Funeral Homes v. EEOC</em>. In denying the motion the court reasoned that it was unclear and unlikely that the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision would have any impact on the case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 19, 2019 the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal, which the court accepted.

    "summary_short": "On March 21, 2017 a cisgender student brought suit for declaratory and injunctive relief in the Federal Eastern District Court of Pennsylvania against Boyertown Area School District and several school officials in their official capacity. Plaintiff was represented by Alliance Defending Freedom. Plaintiff’s suit alleged that the School District’s policy allowing transgender students to use the facilities aligned with their gender-identity constituted a violation of cisgender students’ privacy, in violation of the 14th Amendment’s right to bodily privacy, the Pennsylvania common law right of privacy, and Title IX. The case was assigned to Judge Edward Smith. \r\n\r\nOn August 25, 2017 the court denied plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found that plaintiffs were not likely to succeed on the merits of their causes of action and could not show irreparable harm. Plaintiffs appealed the preliminary injunction denial to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. \r\n\r\nOn June 18, 2018 the Third Circuit affirmed the district court’s opinion along the same reasons identified by the lower court. On July 26, 2018 the third circuit granted a petition for rehearing, and thusly vacated their June 18th opinion but did not grant a petition for rehearing en banc. The same day, the Third Circuit issued a new opinion, which still affirmed the district court’s decision. On October 10, 2018 plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court. The Court denied their petition on May 28, 2019. \r\n\r\nOn September 5, 2019 the district court denied plaintiff’s motion to stay the case pending resolution of three Supreme Court cases - Bostock v. Clayton County, Altitude Express v. Zarda and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes v. EEOC. In denying the motion the court reasoned that it was unclear and unlikely that the Supreme Court’s decision would have any impact on the case. \r\n\r\nOn September 19, 2019 the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal, which the court accepted.",

This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants because they are \ndomiciled in Pennsylvania. \nPARTIES \nPlaintiff \n9.  Plaintiff and  his  Guardians  are  citizens  of the  United  States  and \nresidents of Pennsylvania. \n10.  Plaintiff Joel Doe is a minor boy.  He is a student who began his junior \nyear at Boyertown Area High School, a public high school in the Boyertown Area \nSchool District,  in August of 2016.  Because Joel Doe is a  minor,  this action is \n2 \n\nbrought on his behalf by and through his legal guardians. \nDefendant Boyertown Area School District \n11.  Boyertown  Area  School  District  (\"Boyertown  SD\"  or  \"District\")  is \norganized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. \n12.  The  District  includes  public  educational  institutions  that  provide \nstudents a kindergarten through 12th-grade education. \n13.  The District and its schools receive federal funds and so are subject to \nthe requirements of Title IX. \n14.  District schools include seven K-6 elementary schools, two 7-9 junior \nhigh schools, and one senior high school serving grades 10, 11 and 12. \n15.  Boyertown  SD  is  governed  by  the  Board  of  School  Directors  (the \n\"School Board\"), a  nine-member elected body that sets policy for the District and \ndelegates responsibility for the administration of the District to its Superintendent \nof Schools, who oversees a number of district-level administrators. \n16.  District  Defendant  is  responsible  for  the  enforcement  of  policies \nthrough its Superintendent, administrators, teachers, and other employees. \nDefendant Superintendent Dr. Richard Faidley \n17.  Defendant Faidley is the current Superintendent of Boyertown SD and \nis sued in his official capacity.  At all times relevant to the events described herein, \nSuperintendent Faidley acted within the scope of his employment as an employee, \n3 \n\nagent, and representative of the School Board.  In such capacity, he implemented a \nnew policy in which student(s) of one sex are permitted to enter and use restrooms, \nlocker  rooms  and shower facilities  designated for  members  of the  opposite  sex. \nUpon information and belief, he did so with the consent, knowledge, or ratification \nof the School Board; under the School Board's authority, control, and supervision; \nand with the actual or apparent authority of the School Board.  Upon information \nand belief, Superintendent Faidley has final policymaking authority for Boyertown \nSD in circumstances not otherwise provided for in the School District Bylaws and \nPolicies. \nDefendant Principal Dr. Brett Cooper \n18.  Defendant Cooper is the current Principal of Boyertown Area High \nSchool and is sued in his official capacity.  In such capacity, he implemented a new \npolicy in which student(s) of one sex are permitted to enter and use restrooms, \nlocker  rooms  and shower facilities  designated for  members  of the  opposite  sex. \nUpon information and belief, he did so with the consent, knowledge, or ratification \nof the School Board; under the School Board's authority, control, and supervision; \nand with the actual or apparent authority of the School Board.  Upon information \nand belief, Principal Cooper has final policymaking authority for Boyertown Area \nHigh School with respect to the day-to-day enforcement of the District's policies, \nincluding the newly adopted policy or practice permitting students of one sex to \n4 \n\nenter and use private facilities like restrooms, locker rooms and shower facilities \nwith members of the opposite sex. \nDefendant Assistant Principal Dr. E. Wayne Foley \n19.  Defendant Foley is the current Assistant Principal of Boyertown Area \nHigh School and is sued in his official capacity.  In such capacity, he implemented a \nnew policy in which student(s) of one sex are officially authorized to enter and use \nrestrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  shower  facilities  designated  for  members  of the \nopposite sex.  Upon information and belief, he did so with the consent, knowledge or \nratification of the School Board; under the School Board's authority, control,  and \nsupervision; and with the actual or apparent authority of the School Board.  Upon \ninformation and belief, Assistant Principal Foley has final policymaking authority \nfor Boyertown Area High School with respect to the day-to-day enforcement of the \nDistrict's  policies,  including  the  newly  adopted  policy  or  practice  permitting \nstudents of one sex to enter and use private facilities like restrooms, locker rooms \nand shower facilities with members of the opposite sex. \nINTRODUCTION \n20.  The  importance  of privacy has  long been considered central to  our \nwestern notions of freedom:  a  measure of personal isolation and personal control \nover the  conditions of privacy's abandonment is of the very essence of personal \nfreedom and dignity. \n5 \n\n21.  Defendants purposefully violated Plaintiffs privacy rights and further \nattempted to harass and coerce the minor Plaintiff into further privacy violations. \n22.  No  student  should be  forced  to  use  multi-user private  facilities  at \nschool,  like locker rooms  and restrooms,  with students of the opposite  sex.  No \nschool  district ought to  violate  its  students' constitutional and statutory rights, \nespecially when it means abandoning a common sense practice that long protected \nevery student's privacy and access to education. Yet the Defendants have taken \nprecisely these actions in this case. \n23.  The term \"sex\"  refers to one's biological/anatomical status as either \nmale or female. \n24.  Sex is fixed at conception, binary, objectively verifiable, and rooted in \nour human reproductive nature. \n25.  The Defendants secretly authorized a  student of the opposite sex to \nhave unrestricted access to enter and use boys' private facilities. \n26.  Upon information and belief, Defendants' policy is grounded in gender \nidentity theory,  which asserts that a  person's subjective perception of their own \n\"gender\"  should be  more  important in every conceivable  setting than sex,  one's \nbiological/anatomical status as either male or female. \n27.  Under  gender  identity  theory,  gender  is  subjectively  assumed,  not \nobjectively verifiable, exists on a continuum, and is sometimes fluid. \n6 \n\n28.  By adopting gender identity theory as the basis for regulating access to \nprivate facilities, Defendants are violating sex discrimination law by not protecting \nstudents based on sex but instead imposing an individual's subjective perception of \ntheir  gender  on  other  students  who  value  their  privacy  based  on  anatomical \ndifferences between the sexes. \n29.  This practice has had a severe and negative impact on Plaintiff. \n30.  Plaintiff has  experienced  embarrassment  and  humiliation,  both  m \nterms  of being viewed and v1ewmg  a  student of the  opposite  sex in a  state of \nundress  and because of the stigmatization and criticism he  received from  other \nstudents and adults, fueled by the administration's policy and actions. He also fears \nthe future embarrassment of meeting students of the opposite sex in the bathroom \nwhen simply relieving himself. He now avoids using the restroom during the school \nday because of the ongoing risk of having his privacy violated. \n31.  Because  of the  district's  policy  and  actions,  Plaintiff does  not  feel \nsecure in the locker rooms or restrooms that are properly set aside for the exclusive \nuse of boys to protect their privacy from exposure to members of the opposite sex. \n32.  The actions and policy violates Plaintiffs fundamental right to bodily \nprivacy, Title IX,  intrusion upon seclusion, as well as Pennsylvania law requiring \nseparate facilities at our public schools. \n33.  Plaintiff asks this Court to declare the Defendants' policy and actions \n7 \n\nunlawful, and order the other relief requested herein. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n34.  Joel Doe  is  a  student at Boyertown Area High School,  where he \nlS \nenrolled in a physical education (\"PE\") course. \n35.  PE  is  a  mandatory course  at the  District and  a  requirement to \nlS \ngraduate. \n36.  It is  mandatory  that  students  m  PE  class  change  into  clothing \nappropriate for PE class. \n37.  The PE locker rooms have signs which indicate they are either for girls \nor for boys. \n38.  Joel  Doe  has  always  used  the  boys'  locker  room  and  bathrooms \nbecause his sex is male. \n39.  Joel Doe had a reasonable expectation that he would have privacy in \nthe locker rooms and bathrooms in the school from viewing members of the opposite \nsex or from being viewed by members of the opposite sex. \n40.  On or about October 31, 2016, Joel Doe began changing in the locker \nroom for PE class, and when he was standing in his underwear about to put his gym \nclothes on, he suddenly realized there was a member of the opposite sex changing \nwith him in the locker room, who was at the time wearing nothing but shorts and a \nbra. \n8 \n\n41.  Joel  Doe  experienced  immediate  confusion,  embarrassment, \nhumiliation,  and loss  of dignity  upon finding  himself in this  circumstance  and \nquickly put his clothes on and left the locker room. \n42.  Joel Doe, along with various classmates, went to speak to the Assistant \nPrincipal, Dr. Foley, after gym class to let him know what had happened. \n43.  Joel Doe informed Dr. Foley that there was a girl in their locker room. \nDr.  Foley  indicated that the  legality was  up  in  the  air  but that students  who \nmentally identify themselves with the opposite sex could choose the locker room and \nbathroom to use, and physical sex did not matter. \n44.  Joel Doe asked whether there was anything that Dr. Foley could do to \nprotect him from this situation. \n45.  Dr. Foley responded that there was nothing he could do and he did not \nknow what the end result will be. \n46.  Dr. Foley told Joel Doe to \"tolerate\" it and make it as \"natural\" as he \npossibly can. \n47.  Prior to Joel Doe leaving, Dr. Foley repeated himself a second time as \nJoel Doe was leaving the office, telling him again to be as \"natural\" as possible. \n48.  The District intentionally and purposefully caused Joel Doe's privacy \nto be violated. \n49.  Boyertown School District did not inform Joel Doe or his Guardians, \n9 \n\nJohn Doe and Jane Doe, before this incident that they were permitting students of \none sex to enter locker rooms and bathrooms of students of the opposite sex. \n50.  Boyertown School District had not informed Joel Doe or his Guardians \nthat despite the words on locker room and restroom doors,  they would no longer \nprotect Joel Doe's expectation of privacy from viewing or being viewed by members \nof the  opposite  sex when he  is  present  in  multi-user private  facilities  such as \nbathrooms and locker rooms. \n51.  The  District's  directive  to  Joel Doe  was  that he  must change  with \nstudents of the opposite sex, and make it as natural as possible, and that anything \nless  would  be  intolerant  and  bullying  against  students  who  profess  a  gender \nidentity with the opposite sex. \n52.  After  Joel  Doe's  privacy  was  violated,  the  District's  actions \nmarginalized  and  shamed  Joel  Doe,  and  unlawfully  attempted  to  coerce  and \nintimidate Joel Doe into accepting continuing violations of his bodily privacy. \n53.  The anxiety, embarrassment, and stress he feels as a direct result of \nDefendants' practice and actions has caused him to refrain from using restrooms as \nmuch as possible,  stress about when and if he can use a  given restroom without \nrunning into persons of the opposite sex, and opting to hold his bladder rather than \nusing the school's restroom. This has caused an ever-present distraction throughout \nthe school day, including during class instructional time. \n10 \n\n54.  Failing  to  timely  void  urme  has  direct  and  adverse  physiological \neffects, and the Defendants' policy inhibits Joel Doe from timely voiding. \n55.  Joel Doe's Guardians made an appointment to speak with the assistant \nprincipal  shortly  thereafter,  and  met  with  Defendant  Dr.  Foley  on  or  about \nNovember 2, 2016. \n56.  Joel Doe's Guardians explained how Joel Doe's bodily privacy had been \nviolated by the District's actions and sought answers to ensure it did not happen \nagain.  It was then that Dr. Foley indicated that the school district is \"all-inclusive\" \nand that if Joel Doe had a problem changing or using restrooms with people of the \nopposite sex, he would get him permission to go to the nurse's office to change. \n57.  Joel Doe's Guardians subsequently met with Dr. Cooper, the principal \nof Boyertown High School to voice their concerns.  Dr. Cooper was condescending to \nJoel Doe's Guardians and stated that he would not do anything because Joel Doe \ncan simply change in the nurse's office from now on if he does not want to change \naround people of the opposite sex. \n58.  By mandating that Joel Doe use a nurse's office to change if he wants \nprivacy, Defendants have prevented him from using the facilities that, by state and \nfederal law, are provided for use solely by males and that are required to ensure \nthat students of one sex have their privacy protected from members of the opposite \nsex. \n11 \n\n59.  The District further marginalized, intimidated and shamed Joel Doe, \nby contacting the Principal at the Vo-Tech school,  Berks Career and Technology \nSchool - Oley Campus (BCTS),  where Joel Doe  also attended half of the day, to \ndisclose the fact that Joel Doe had gone to the Assistant Principal over the violation \nof his bodily privacy. \n60.  On or about November 2, 2016, just two days after the incident where \nPlaintiffs right to privacy was violated, the principal of BCTS, Mr. Jenkins, pulled \nJoel Doe out of class to have what Mr. Jenkins called a \"casual conversation\" about \nthe incident at Boyertown High School and stated \"he wanted to make sure none of \nthat negativity was going to happen at his school.\" \n61.  Joel  Doe  felt  harassed,  shamed,  and  bullied  by  Boyertown  School \nDistrict's publication to BCTS about the incident and his concerns. \n62.  Joel  Doe's  Guardians  scheduled  a  meeting  with  the  Defendant \nSuperintendent  Dr.  Faidley,  and  Dr.  Faidley  indicated  that  if  Joel  Doe  was \nuncomfortable changing with those of the opposite sex, or with using the nurse's \noffice,  then he could just withdraw from school and be home schooled, while still \nattending Vo-tech if he wished. \n63.  The District's actions have forced Joel Doe to stop changing for PE \nclass, which has resulted in disciplinary action and poor grades by only receiving \nhalf of the day's credit for participating in street clothes rather than gym clothes. \n12 \n\n64.  Joel Doe feels violated, humiliated, and embarrassed by the invasion of \nprivacy. \n65.  Because of the privacy violation,  as well as the District's subsequent \nactions, Joel Doe also experiences anxiety, stress, intimidation, fear, apprehension \nand loss of dignity. \n66.  These  daily  persistent  feelings  of  anxiety,  stress,  humiliation, \nembarrassment, apprehension, distress, and violation of privacy stay with Joel Doe \nand impact him throughout the day, distracting him from instructional time. \n67.  Plaintiff is  suffering  and  will  continue  to  suffer  irreparable  harm \nbecause of the Defendants' actions. \n68.  Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law. \nALLEGATIONS OF LAW \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION (ALL DEFENDANTS): \nVIOLATION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY \nIN VIOLATION OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT \nTO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \nu.s.c. \n42  § 1983 \n69.  Plaintiff realleges all matters set forth above  and incorporate them \nherein. \n70.  The  Fourteenth  Amendment  protects  citizens  against  violation  of \nfundamental rights by state actors. \n71.  Fundamental rights are liberty interests deeply rooted in the nation's \n13 \n\nhistory and tradition and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. \n72.  Joel  Doe  has  a  fundamental  right  to  bodily  privacy  that,  at  a \nmm1mum,  includes  protection from  intimate  exposure  of his  body  and intimate \nactivities to a person of the opposite sex. It also includes the corollary protection \nfrom intimate exposure to a female's body or intimate activities. \n73.  The fundamental right to bodily privacy as to persons of the opposite \nsex is deeply rooted in the nation's history and tradition and has been recognized as \nflowing from the United States Constitution as well as federal and state statutory \nand common law. See,  e.g.,  Doe v.  Luzerne County, 660 F.3d 169,  176 n.5 (3d Cir. \n2011) (holding that a person has a privacy interest in his or her \"partially clothed \nbody,\"  recognized  by  various  sister  circuits,  and  arising  out  of the  Fourteenth \nAmendment); Borse  v.  Piece  Goods  Shop,  Inc.,  963 F.2d 611,  621  (3d  Cir.  1992) \n(recognizing  that  the  collection  of urine  sample  may  constitute  an invasion  of \nprivacy if \"it involves the use of one's senses to oversee the private activities of \nanother\" since the performance in public of such activities are \"generally prohibited \nby law as well as social custom\" and failure to regard privacy \"could constitute a \nsubstantial and highly offensive intrusion upon seclusion\"). \n7 4.  The fundamental right to bodily privacy is also implicit in the concept \nof ordered liberty because  a  government that compels  its citizens to  disrobe  or \nattend to intimate activities in the presence of the opposite sex violates the core of \n14 \n\npersonal liberty,  and it  deprives  its  citizens  of the  full  benefits  afforded  to  its \ncitizens  when  it  conditions  those  benefits  on  surrendering  the  right  to  bodily \nprivacy. \n75.  Throughout its history, American law and society has had a  national \ncommitment to protecting citizens, and especially children, from suffering the risk \nof exposing their bodies, or their intimate activities, to the opposite sex. \n76.  Our understanding of personal privacy from persons of the opposite sex \nis so universal as to require the use of separate facilities on the basis of sex in all \nkinds of contexts. See Public School Code of 1949, 24 P.S. § 7-740 (requiring that \nfacilities \"shall be suitably constructed for,  and used separately by the sexes\"). See \nalso  43  P.S.  §  109  (requiring  application  of  industrial  sanitation  code  to  all \nemployers,  which  involves  separate  restrooms);  7  Pa.  Code  §  1.57  (requiring \nseparate facilities  for  meat packers);  7  Pa.  Code  §  78. 75  (separate restrooms  at \neating establishments); 7 Pa. Code § 82.9 (requiring separate facilities on the basis \nof sex for seasonal farm labor, \"distinctly marked 'for men' and 'for women' by signs \nprinted  in  English  and  in  the  native  languages  of  the  persons\"  using  those \nfacilities);  28  Pa.  Code  §  18.62  (requiring  \"separate  dressing facilities,  showers, \nlavatories, toilets and appurtenances for each sex\" at swimming pools); 25 Pa. Code \n§ 171.16 (requiring schools to follow the provisions of the Public Bathing Law (35 P. \nS. § §  672-680d) and 28 Pa. Code Chapter 18 (relating to swimming and bathing \n15 \n\nplaces);  28 Pa.  Code  §19.21  (requiring separate restrooms on the basis of sex at \ncamps);  28  Pa.  Code  §  205.38  (requiring  separate  restrooms  at long  term care \nfacilities);  31  Pa.  Code  §  41.121  (requiring  separate  facilities  for  each  sex  on \nrailroads); 31 Pa. Code § 41.122 (requiring separate bathrooms to be provided for \neach sex and clearly designated and forbidding any person to use or frequent a toilet \nroom assigned to the opposite sex);  31  Pa.  Code § 47.127 (same);  34 Pa.  Code  § \n403.28  (requiring restrooms for  each sex);  43  Pa.  Code  § 41.24 (designating the \nentrance of \"retiring rooms\" to be clearly marked by sex and preventing opposite sex \nentry); 43 Pa. Code § 41.31 (requiring separate toilet rooms \"for each sex\" which \nshall be clearly designated and that \"no person shall be permitted to use or frequent \na  toilet  room  assigned  to  the  opposite  sex\");  43  Pa.  Code  §  41.32  (requiring \npartitions separating toilet rooms on account of sex, which shall be \"soundproof'). \n77.  The importance of personal privacy is also recognized in the context of \ndiscrimination law,  and specifically in the situation that Plaintiff faces.  See,  e.g., \nLivingwell, Inc.  v.  Pennsylvania Human Relations Com., 606 A.2d 1287, 1290 (Pa. \nCommw. Ct. 1992) (citing City of Philadelphia v.  Pa.  Human Relations Com.,  300 \nA.2d 97 (Pa. Commw. Ct.  1973), and recognizing that employers may hire on the \nbasis of sex to vindicate \"a juvenile's 'privacy interest\"' that \"would be violated if \nrequired to ... disrobe and shower in front of a staff member of the opposite sex\"). \n\"[W]here there is a  distinctly private activity involving exposure of intimate body \n16 \n\nparts, there exists an implied bona fide public accommodation qualification which \nmay justify otherwise illegal sex discrimination. Otherwise ... such sex segregated \naccommodations such as bathrooms, showers and locker rooms, would have to be \nopen to the public.\" Id. at 1291. \n78.  \"The standard for recognizing a privacy interest as it relates to one's \nbody is not limited to protecting one where there is an exposure of an 'intimate \narea,' but such a right may also be recognized where one has a reasonable basis to \nbe  protected against  embarrassment  or  suffer  a  loss  of dignity  because  of the \nactivity taking place.\" Id. \"To hold otherwise would mean that separate changing \nrooms in factories, mines and construction sites where workers change from street \nclothes to work clothes and back and where 'intimate areas' are not exposed, would \nnot be permitted.\" Id. at 1293 n.6. \n79.  Personal privacy is also recognized in the context of criminal law. See, \ne.g., id. at 1289 (quoting 18 Pa.C.S. § 5901 to make the point that \"certain conduct . \n. . between genders is inappropriate. For example, it is a misdemeanor to commit \nopen lewdness because those who observe it 'would be affronted or alarmed.\"'). See \nalso  18 Pa.C.S.A.  §  7507.1  (regarding viewing or filming  a  person in a  state of \nundress without their consent in a place where a person \"would have a reasonable \nexpectation of privacy\"); 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3127 (regarding the exposure of genitalia in \ncircumstances where a  person should know that it \"is likely to offend,  affront or \n17 \n\nalarm\"). \n80.  Criminal protections are heightened for children. See,  e.g.,  § 3127(b) \n(increasing the severity of an indecent exposure charge based on age). \n81.  While  pornography  involving  only  adults  is  legal  and  cannot  be \nconstitutionally banned, it is illegal to possess, distribute, or even view images of \nnaked children. See 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 6312. \n82.  Nearly every state has a law criminalizing \"sexting,'' which is when a \nminor sends a naked picture of himself or herself via electronic means. See, e.g.,  18 \nPa.C.S.A. § 6321. \n83.  Because  of  our  national  commitment  to  protect  our  citizens,  and \nespecially children, from the risk of being exposed to the anatomy of the opposite \nsex, as well as the risk of being seen by the opposite sex while attending to private, \nintimate needs, sex-separated restrooms and locker rooms are ubiquitous in public \nplaces. \n84.  Using  public  restrooms  and locker  rooms  separated by  sex  are  an \nAmerican social and modesty norm. \n85.  Historically,  purposefully  entering  a  restroom  or  locker  room \ndesignated for the opposite biological sex has been considered wrongful, and even \ncriminal, behavior. \n86.  Freedom from the risk of compelled intimate exposure to the opposite \n18 \n\nsex, especially for minors, is deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition. \n87.  It is also implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. \n88.  The ability to disrobe absent the presence of the opposite sex,  along \nwith the freedom to use the restroom absent the presence of the opposite sex is \nfundamental to most people's sense of self-respect and personal dignity. \n89.  If the government were granted the far-reaching and extreme power to \ncompel its citizens to disrobe or risk being unclothed in the presence of the opposite \nsex, then little personal liberty involving our bodies would be left. \n90.  Because freedom from the risk of compelled exposure to the opposite \nbiological sex,  especially for minors,  is deeply rooted in this nation's history and \ntradition and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, it is a fundamental right. See \nWashington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721 (1997). \n91.  Specifically:  minors have a  fundamental right to be free  from  State \ncompelled risk of exposure of their bodies, or their intimate activities, such as occur \nwithin restrooms and locker rooms, to the opposite biological sex. \n92.  An  abridgement  of  fundamental  rights  is  presumptively \nunconstitutional and can only be justified if it survives strict scrutiny under which \nthe law must serve a compelling state interest by the most narrowly tailored means. \n93.  The Defendants' actions and practice violated Doe's fundamental right \nto privacy because it allowed a  biological female  into the boys' locker room  and \n19 \n\nsubjected Doe to undressing in front of someone of the opposite sex, who was herself \nalso in a state of undress. \n94.  Shocked and distressed, Doe met with Defendant Dr. Foley. \n95.  When Doe asked to be protected from the situation, Dr. Foley told him \nthat there was nothing he could do and that instead, he and his friends would have \nto share the boys' locker room with a person of the opposite sex. They were told to \ntolerate it and make it as natural as possible. \n96.  Even though after Jane Doe and John Doe got involved, Doe was told \nthat he could use the nurse's office to change for gym class, he was still required to \nenter the locker room in order to safely store his belongings. This would still subject \nDoe to viewing a person of the opposite sex in state of undress. \n97.  Moreover, the policy harms Doe because unless he surrenders his right \nto bodily privacy, he can no longer use the locker room designed for use by boys. \n98.  While the Public School Code of 1949 requires that facilities \"shall be \nsuitably  constructed  for,  and  used  separately  by,  the  sexes,\"  24  P.S.  §  7-740, \nDefendants' policy violates the requirement of separate facilities and denies Doe the \nright to use such a facility, instead conditioning the use of the \"boys\"' locker room on \nsurrendering Doe's right to bodily privacy from persons of the opposite sex. See also \n25 Pa. Code § 171.7 (requiring separate facilities \"for each sex\" in schools). Accord \n22 Pa.  Code  § 55.2 (same for private elementary schools);  22 Pa.  Code  § 57.2(a) \n20 \n\n(same  for  private  secondary  schools);  22  Pa.  Code  §  59.34(a)  (same  for  private \nspecial education schools). \n99.  Plaintiff and his Guardians on multiple occasions brought up the policy \nwith  the  Assistant  Principal,  the  Principal,  and  the  Superintendent,  but  their \nrequests for a change in the District's policy were denied. \n100.  Doe and his guardians were told that the school was no longer going to \ndiscuss this issue with them or any parents. \n101.  Doe ultimately decided to not change for gym class, which resulted in \nfailing each gym class. \n102.  The Defendants have  no compelling interest to justify this violation \nDoe's right to bodily privacy from persons of the opposite sex. \n103.  The violation of this right is particularly acute where, as here, his right \nwas first violated without any notice or consent in a  place traditionally--and by \nstate statute--reserved for persons of one biological sex. \n104.  The violation was ongoing because it compromises the most intimate \naspects of human affairs  and involves  a  setting traditionally (and by state law) \nreserved for persons of one biological sex. It effectively denies the appropriate use of \nthis setting in a  manner conveying sexual harassment and official bullying,  and \nwhich is otherwise inconsistent with deeply rooted notions of fundamental personal \ninterests in personal privacy from persons of the opposite biological sex. \n21 \n\n105.  Defendants failed to employ the least restrictive means of serving any \ninterest that they may later articulate. \n106.  Accordingly, the actions and practice fail strict scrutiny review and are \nunconstitutional. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully prays that the Court grant the relief set \nforth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION (ALL DEFENDANTS): \nVIOLATION OF TITLE IX \n107.  Plaintiff realleges  all matters set forth  above  and incorporate them \nherein. \n108.  Title IX provides that \"[n]o person in the United States shall, on the \nbasis of sex,  be excluded from  participation in,  be  denied the benefits of,  or be \nsubjected  to  discrimination  under  any  education  program  or  activity  receiving \nFederal financial assistance.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n109.  The School District is a federal funding recipient for purposes of Title \nIX. \n110.  Courts  have  given  Title  IX  broad  effect  m  order  to  combat  sex \ndiscrimination in the educational setting. \n111.  There is an implied right of action for a student to sue his school and \nschool officials under Title IX. \n112.  Defendants' authorizing people to use restrooms or locker rooms that \n22 \n\nare designated for the opposite biological sex violates privacy and creates a sexually \nharassing hostile environment. \n113.  Unconsented exposure to persons of the opposite-sex in various states \nof undress creates a sexually harassing hostile environment. \n114.  The policy of the school is to allow those who self-identify with the \nopposite  biological  sex  to  choose  to  use  locker  rooms  and  restrooms  that  are \ndesignated for the opposite biological sex. \n115.  Joel Doe  does  not object to students of the same  sex using private \nfacilities with him, no matter how they self-identify, and he has no expectation of \nprivacy from such students. \n116.  This  policy  needlessly  subjects  Doe  to  the  risk  that  his  partially \nunclothed body will be exposed to the opposite sex and that he will be exposed to a \npartially clothed person of the opposite-sex,  as actually occurred when the policy \nwas first implemented. \n117.  As a result, Doe experienced embarrassment, humiliation, frustration, \ndegradation, and loss of dignity. \n118.  Doe  has  been  marginalized  by  other  students  on  account  of  his \nobjection to the policy. \n119.  Doe is avoiding the restroom as a result of the fear and apprehension \nof embarrassment, humiliation, degradation, and loss of dignity he may experience \n23 \n\nin the restroom. \n120.  Doe  has  altogether  ceased  usmg  the  locker  room  because  of  the \nlegitimate fear that he will again be in a state of undress or exposed to an opposite \nsex student in a state of undress. \n121.  Doe cannot store his clothes in the locker room since that would again \nput him in the locker room where he may be exposed to an opposite sex student in a \nstate of undress. \n122.  Doe is now taking a failing grade every day he does not change. \n123.  The  policy  violates  Title  IX  because  it  intentionally  produces \nunwelcome sexual harassment and creates a hostile environment on the basis of sex \nand denies access to educational programs and benefits. \n124.  In order to make out a Title IX claim: (1) plaintiff must be subjected to \nsexual harassment; (2) the harassment must be severe, pervasive, and objectively \noffensive; (3) the school must be deliberately indifferent to the harassment; and (4) \nthe harassment must result in the denial of access. \n125.  Doe satisfies all elements. \n126.  First,  Doe  was subjected to harassment because the practice  allows \nbiological females  to  use the boys'  locker rooms  and restrooms,  which creates a \nharassing hostile environment specifically on the basis of the sex of the persons \ninvolved. \n24 \n\n127.  Differences in anatomy is the only reason for separate facilities. Were \nthere  no  differences  in anatomy,  there  would be  no  privacy interests justifying \nseparate facilities in the first place. \n128.  These  differences  do  not  disappear  when  biological  females  self \nidentify as males, and vice versa. \n129.  Neither state nor federal law obligates Defendants to provide multi \nuser private facilities based on what a student wears, whom the student is sexually \nattracted to,  how the  student presents or identifies him or herself,  or based on \nwhether a student identifies with their sex or with the opposite sex. \n130.  The anatomical differences between the sexes is the reason that Title \nIX and its implementing regulations allow for separate living facilities, restrooms, \nlocker rooms, and changing areas for each biological sex. \n131.  Title IX and its implementing regulations provide for separate living \nfacilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and changing areas for each biological sex based \non the recognition that permitting a person of one biological sex to enter and use the \nfacilities designated for the opposite sex would be sexually harassing. \n132.  The  policy,  which  opens  the  boys'  restrooms  and  locker  rooms  to \nbiological females, is harassment based on the boys' sex. \n133.  Doe experienced humiliation, degradation, and loss of dignity and fears \nthe same in the future as a result of the policy and practice. \n25 \n\n134.  It is  the  significant  and  real  anatomical  differences  between  the \nbiological sexes that creates the hostile environment, which is harassment. \n135.  Second, the harassment is severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive. \n136.  Letting biological females  use the boys' restrooms and locker rooms \nplaces the bodily privacy of both sexes at risk,  and so is sufficiently egregious to \nsatisfy the severity prong. \n137.  The harassment is ongoing and continuous, preventing Doe from using \nthe locker room and discouraging him from using the restrooms, thus satisfying the \npervasiveness prong. \n138.  The environment is one that a  reasonable person would find hostile \nand objectively offensive, and one that Doe in fact perceives to be so. \n139.  The objective unreasonableness is evident in the fact that we have long \nrecognized the right to a private setting, free from persons of the opposite sex, when \nin a state of undress or performing private functions. \n140.  This principle is recognized in numerous areas of the law,  as stated \nabove. \n141.  Third, school officials are not only on notice of the hostile environment, \nbut  it  is  the  Defendants'  policy  that  establishes  and  sustains  the  hostile \nenvironment. \n142.  Moreover,  Plaintiff  and  his  Guardians  repeatedly  notified  the \n26 \n\nindividual Defendants, who then told Plaintiff and his Guardians that this is what \nthe school will be doing as a matter of policy. \n143.  The Defendants have  authority to rescind their policy which would \nresolve the hostile environment created by that policy. \n144.  Despite  their  knowledge  that  their  practice  1s  creating  a  hostile \nenvironment based on sex, the Defendants have not remedied the situation. \n145.  Instead,  these  officials  have  advised  that,  if  Doe  perceives  the \nenvironment to be hostile, Doe should remove himself from it by using the nurse's \noffice. \n146.  Schools cannot escape liability for Title IX violations by requiring the \nvictim of harassment to remove himself from the hostile environment or otherwise \nsuggesting that he is responsible for the harassment he endures. \n147.  The  nurse's  office  \"accommodation\"  creates  a  separate  but unequal \nfacility that violates Title IX. \n148.  Fourth, Doe has been effectively denied the use of facilities that are to \nbe provided, pursuant to state and federal law, on account of his biological sex. \n149.  This has resulted in his inability to change and store his belongings in \nthe locker room, thus resulting in failing grades during each day of gym class. \n150.  Defendants' policy and actions violate Title IX by creating a  hostile \nenvironment on the basis of sex. \n27 \n\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully prays that the Court grant the relief set \nforth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION (ALL DEFENDANTS): \nINVASION OF PRIVACY -INTRUSION UPON SECLUSION \n151.  Plaintiff realleges  all matters set forth  above  and incorporate them \nherein. \n152.  Defendants purposely opened up the boys' locker room and restroom to \na biological female who identified as a male. \n153.  As a result, Doe found himself in only his underwear in the presence of \na biological female, who was wearing nothing above her waist other than a bra. \n154.  One's  partially  clothed  body  is  a  private  affair,  particularly  with \nregards to a member of the opposite sex. \n155.  Defendants'  practice,  therefore,  caused  Doe's  private  affairs  to  be \nintruded upon by being viewed by someone of the opposite sex and intruded upon \nhis privacy by forcing him to be at a place to see a partially clothed female body. \n156.  Laws and social custom have long protected our right to be free from \nundressing in the view of someone of the opposite sex and to be free from viewing \nsomeone of the opposite sex undressing. \n157.  In  particular,  laws  applicable  to  public  schools  require  separate \nfacilities on the basis of sex,  which has always been understood to mean on the \nbasis of biological/anatomical sex. \n28 \n\n158.  Defendants' practice failed to give due regard to Doe's privacy. \n159.  Therefore, the circumstances in which Doe found himself, particularly \nin a setting designed to be private with regards to persons of the opposite sex, would \nbe highly offensive to the ordinary reasonable person. \n160.  Doe lacks ongoing access to the boy's locker room and is discouraged in \nhis use of the boy's restroom as a result of this invasion of seclusion. \n161.  Additionally, Doe has been receiving failing grades in gym class due to \nthis invasion of seclusion. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully prays that the Court grant the relief set \nforth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiff prays for  judgment against the  Defendants,  jointly \nand/or severally, as follows: \nA.  A  declaration  that  the  Defendants'  actions  and  practice  violates \nPlaintiffs constitutional right to privacy. \nB.  A  declaration  that  Defendants'  actions  were  a  violation  of  the \nPennsylvania School Code of 1949. \nC.  A declaration that Defendants committed an unlawful intrusion upon \nPlaintiffs seclusion and bodily privacy rights. \nD.  A declaration that the Defendants' actions and practice impermissibly \n29 \n\nburdens Plaintiffs rights under Title IX to be free from discrimination on the basis \nof sex by creating a sexually harassing hostile environment. \nE.  A permanent injunction enjoining the District Defendants' policy and \nordering  the  District  Defendants  to  permit  only  females  to  enter  and  use  the \nDistrict's girls' private facilities,  including locker rooms  and restrooms,  and only \nmales  to  enter  and  use  the  boys'  private  facilities,  including  locker  rooms  and \nrestrooms. \nF.  An  award  of compensatory  damages  for  the  violation  of Plaintiffs \nconstitutional and statutory rights; \nG.  An order that this  Court  retain jurisdiction of this  matter for  the \npurpose of enforcing any Orders; \nH.  An award of Plaintiffs costs and expenses of this action, including a \nreasonable attorneys' fees award, in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 2412, 42 U.S.C § \n1988; \nI.  All other relief to which  Plaintiff may show  himself to be  entitled, \nincluding attorneys' fees and costs of court. \nDEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL \nPlaintiff demands a trial by jury on all counts and issues so triable. \nRespectfully submitted this 21st day of Marc  , \n30 \n\nCATHY R.

This case is about the intentional violation of students’ fundamental \nright to bodily privacy contrary to constitutional and statutory principles, including \nthe Fourteenth Amendment, Title IX, invasion of seclusion, and the Pennsylvania’s \nPublic School Code of 1949, which requires separate facilities on the basis of sex.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2.  This action arises under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 et seq. (the “Civil Rights Act”) \n\nto redress the deprivation of rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq. (“Title IX”), the Pennsylvania \nConstitution and common law, and the Public School Code of 1949. \n3.

This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants because they are \ndomiciled in Pennsylvania. \nPARTIES \nPlaintiffs \n9.  Plaintiffs and their family members are citizens of the United States \nand residents of Pennsylvania.  \n10.  Plaintiff Joel Doe is a minor boy.  He is a student who began his junior \nyear at Boyertown Area High School, a public high school in the Boyertown Area \n2 \n\nSchool District, in August of 2016.  Because Joel Doe is a minor, this action is brought \non his behalf by and through his legal guardians.    \n11.  Plaintiff Mary Smith is an 18 year old girl.  She is a student who began \nher junior year at Boyertown Area High School, a public high school in the Boyertown \nArea School District, in August of 2016.   \n12.  Plaintiff Jack Jones is a minor boy.  He is a student who began his junior \nyear at Boyertown Area High School, a public high school in the Boyertown Area \nSchool District, in August of 2016.  Because Jack Jones is a minor, this action is \nbrought on his behalf by and through his parents. \n13.  Plaintiff Macy Roe is an 18 year old girl.  She is a student who began \nher senior year at Boyertown Area High School, a public high school in the Boyertown \nArea School District, in August of 2016.   \nDefendant Boyertown Area School District  \n \n14.  Boyertown Area School District (“Boyertown Area SD” or “District”) is \norganized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  \n15.  The  District  includes  public  educational  institutions  that  provide \nstudents a kindergarten through 12th-grade education. \n16.  The District and its schools receive federal funds and so are subject to \nthe requirements of Title IX. \n17.  District schools include seven K-6 elementary schools, two 7-9 junior \nhigh schools, and one senior high school serving grades 10, 11 and 12. \n18.  The District is governed by the Board of School Directors (the “School \n3 \n\nBoard”), a nine-member elected body that sets policy for the District and delegates \nresponsibility for the administration of the District to its Superintendent of Schools, \nwho oversees a number of district-level administrators. \n19.  District Defendant is responsible for the enforcement of policies through \nits Superintendent, administrators, teachers, and other employees. \nDefendant Superintendent Dr. Richard Faidley \n20.  Defendant Faidley is the current Superintendent of the District and is \nsued in his official capacity.  At all times relevant to the events described herein, \nSuperintendent Faidley acted within the scope of his employment as an employee, \nagent, and representative of the School Board.  In such capacity, he implemented a \nnew policy in which students of one sex are permitted to enter and use restrooms, \nlocker rooms and shower facilities designated for members of the opposite sex.  Upon \ninformation and belief, he did so with the consent, knowledge, or ratification of the \nSchool Board; under the School Board’s authority, control, and supervision; and with \nthe actual or apparent authority of the School Board.  Upon information and belief, \nSuperintendent  Faidley  has  final  policymaking  authority  for  the  District  in \ncircumstances not otherwise provided for in the School District Bylaws and Policies. \nDefendant Principal Dr. Brett Cooper \n21.  Defendant Cooper is the current Principal of Boyertown Area High \nSchool and is sued in his official capacity.  In such capacity, he implemented a new \npolicy in which students of one sex are permitted to enter and use restrooms, locker \nrooms and shower facilities designated for members of the opposite sex.  Upon \n4 \n\ninformation and belief, he did so with the consent, knowledge, or ratification of the \nSchool Board; under the School Board’s authority, control, and supervision; and with \nthe actual or apparent authority of the School Board.  Upon information and belief, \nPrincipal Cooper has final policymaking authority for Boyertown Area High School \nwith respect to the day-to-day enforcement of the District’s policies, including the \nnewly adopted policy or practice permitting students of one sex to enter and use \nprivate facilities like restrooms, locker rooms and shower facilities with members of \nthe opposite sex. \nDefendant Assistant Principal Dr. E. Wayne Foley  \n22.  Defendant Foley is the current Assistant Principal of Boyertown Area \nHigh School and is sued in his official capacity.  In such capacity, he implemented a \nnew policy in which student(s) of one sex are officially authorized to enter and use \nrestrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities designated for members of the opposite \nsex.    Upon  information  and  belief,  he  did  so  with  the  consent,  knowledge  or \nratification of the School Board; under the School Board’s authority, control, and \nsupervision; and with the actual or apparent authority of the School Board.  Upon \ninformation and belief, Assistant Principal Foley has final policymaking authority for \nBoyertown Area High School with respect to the day-to-day enforcement of the \nDistrict’s policies, including the newly adopted policy or practice permitting students \nof one sex to enter and use private facilities like restrooms, locker rooms and shower \nfacilities with members of the opposite sex. \n \n5 \n\nINTRODUCTION \n \n23.  The  importance  of  privacy  has  long  been  considered  central  to  our \nwestern notions of freedom: a measure of personal isolation and personal control over \nthe conditions of privacy's abandonment is of the very essence of personal freedom \nand dignity. \n24.  Defendants purposefully violated Plaintiffs’ privacy rights and further \nattempted to harass and coerce the Plaintiffs into further privacy violations. \n25.  No student should be forced to use multi-user private facilities at school, \nlike locker rooms and restrooms, with students of the opposite sex.  No school district \nought to violate its students’ constitutional and statutory rights, especially when it \nmeans abandoning a common sense practice that long protected every student’s \nprivacy and access to education. Yet the Defendants have taken precisely these \nactions in this case.  \n26.  A woman’s right to bodily privacy does not spring into existence, or cease \nto exist, depending on what a man believes about the nature of his own internal sense \nof “gender identity.”  Her right to bodily privacy is hers and hers alone.   \n27.  A man’s right to bodily privacy does not spring into existence, or cease \nto exist, depending upon what a woman believes about the nature of her own internal \nsense of “gender identity.”  His right to bodily privacy is his and his alone. \n28.  The term “sex” refers to one’s biological/anatomical status as either male \nor female. \n29.  Sex is fixed at conception, binary, objectively verifiable, and rooted in \n6 \n\nour human reproductive nature. \n30.  The  Defendants,  without  parent  or  student  notification,  authorized \nmultiple students to have unrestricted access to enter and use the private facilities \nof the opposite sex.  \n31.  Upon information and belief, Defendants’ policy is grounded in gender \nidentity theory, which asserts that a person’s subjective perception of his or her own \n“gender” should prevail over one’s biological sex as either male or female.  \n32.  Under gender identity theory, gender is subjectively ascertained, not \nobjectively verifiable, exists on a continuum, and is sometimes fluid. \n33.  By adopting gender identity theory as the basis for regulating access to \nprivate facilities, Defendants are violating sex discrimination law by not protecting \nstudents based on sex but instead imposing an individual’s subjective perception of \ntheir  gender  on  other  students  who  value  their  privacy  based  on  anatomical \ndifferences between the sexes. \n34.  This practice has had a severe and negative impact on Plaintiffs. \n35.  Plaintiff  Joel  Doe  has  experienced  embarrassment  and  humiliation, \nboth in terms of being viewed and viewing a student of the opposite sex in a state of \nundress and because of the stigmatization and criticism he received from other \nstudents and adults, fueled by the administration's policy and actions. He feels stress, \nintimidation, apprehension and distress throughout his day knowing that to obtain \nan  education  he  must  attend  to  his  most  personal  needs  in  private  facilities \nunprotected from the entrance, presence, or exposure of a female.  He also fears the \n7 \n\nfuture embarrassment of meeting students of the opposite sex in the locker room \nwhile changing or while using the bathroom.  He now avoids using these spaces \nbecause of the ongoing risk of having his privacy violated. \n36.  Plaintiff Jack Jones has experienced embarrassment and humiliation, \nsince being viewed by a student of the opposite sex in a state of undress, fueled by the \nadministration's policy and actions. He feels stress, intimidation, apprehension and \ndistress throughout his day knowing that to obtain an education he must attend to \nhis most personal needs in private facilities unprotected from the entrance, presence, \nor exposure of a female.  He also fears the future embarrassment of meeting students \nof the opposite sex in the locker room while changing or while using the bathroom. \nHe now avoids using these spaces because of the ongoing risk of having his privacy \nviolated. \n37.  Mary Smith has experienced embarrassment and humiliation, since \nviewing  a  student  of  the  opposite  sex  in  the  female  restrooms,  fueled  by  the \nadministration's policy and actions. She feels stress, intimidation, apprehension and \ndistress throughout her day knowing that to obtain an education she must attend to \nher most personal needs in private facilities unprotected from the entrance, presence, \nor exposure of a male.  She also fears the future embarrassment of meeting students \nof the opposite sex in the locker room while changing or while using the bathroom. \nShe now avoids using these spaces because of the ongoing risk of having her privacy \nviolated. \n38.  Macy Roe experiences anxiety, stress, intimidation, apprehension and \n8 \n\ndistress throughout her day knowing that to obtain an education she must attend to \nher most personal needs in private facilities unprotected from the entrance, presence, \nor exposure of a male. She fears the future embarrassment of meeting students of the \nopposite sex in the locker room while changing or while using the bathroom. She now \navoids using these spaces because of the ongoing risk of having her privacy violated. \n39.  Because of the district’s policy and actions, Plaintiffs do not feel secure \nin the locker rooms or restrooms that are properly set aside for the exclusive use of \nmembers of one sex to protect their privacy from exposure to members of the opposite \nsex.  \n40.  Joel  Doe,  Mary  Smith,  Jack  Jones,  and  Macy  Roe  do  not  object  to \nstudents of the same sex using private facilities with them, and welcomes them no \nmatter how they self-identify their gender, and they have no expectation of privacy \nfrom such students. \n41.  Defendants’ policy and actions violate Plaintiffs’ fundamental right to \nbodily  privacy,  Title  IX,  intrusion  upon  seclusion,  as  well  as  Pennsylvania  law \nrequiring separate facilities at our public schools.  \n42.  Plaintiffs ask this Court to declare the Defendants’ policy and actions \nunlawful and order the other relief requested herein.  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff – Joel Doe \n43.  Joel Doe is a student at Boyertown Area High School, where he is \nenrolled in a physical education (“PE”) course. \n9 \n\n44.  PE  is  a  mandatory  course  at  the  District  and  is  a  requirement  to \ngraduate. \n45.  It  is  mandatory  that  students  in  PE  class  change  into  clothing \nappropriate for PE class. \n46.  The PE locker rooms have signs which indicate they are either for girls \nor for boys. \n47.   Joel Doe has always used the boys’ locker room and bathrooms because \nhis sex is male. \n48.  Joel Doe has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the locker rooms and \nbathrooms in the school from viewing members of the opposite sex or from being \nviewed by members of the opposite sex. \n49.  Joel Doe absolutely does not object to students of the same sex using \nprivate facilities with him regardless of how they may subjectively self-identify their \ngender, and he has no expectation of privacy from members of the same sex.  \n50.  On or about October 31, 2016, Joel Doe began changing in the locker \nroom for PE class, and when he was standing in his underwear about to put his gym \nclothes on, he suddenly realized there was a member of the opposite sex changing \nwith him in the locker room, who was at the time wearing nothing but shorts and a \nbra. \n51.  Joel  Doe  experienced  immediate  confusion,  embarrassment, \nhumiliation, and loss of dignity upon finding himself in this circumstance and quickly \nput his clothes on and left the locker room. \n10 \n\n52.  Joel Doe, along with various classmates, went to speak to the Assistant \nPrincipal, Dr. Foley, after gym class to let him know what had happened. \n53.  Joel Doe informed Dr. Foley that there was a girl in their locker room.  \nDr. Foley indicated that the legality of the practice was up in the air but that students \nwho “mentally” identify with the opposite sex could choose the locker room and \nbathroom to use, and physical sex did not matter.   \n54.  Joel Doe asked whether there was anything that Dr. Foley could do to \nprotect him from this situation.   \n55.  Dr. Foley responded that there was nothing he could do and he did not \nknow what the end result will be.   \n56.  Dr. Foley told Joel Doe to “tolerate” it and make it as “natural” as he \npossibly can.   \n57.  Prior to Joel Doe leaving, Dr. Foley repeated himself a second time as \nJoel Doe was leaving the office, telling him again to be as “natural” as possible. \n58.  The District intentionally and purposefully caused Joel Doe’s privacy to \nbe violated.  \n59.  The District did not inform Joel Doe or his Guardians, John Doe and \nJane Doe, before this incident that they were permitting students of one sex to enter \nlocker rooms and bathrooms of students of the opposite sex.  \n60.  The District had not informed Joel Doe or his Guardians that despite \nthe signs on locker room and restroom doors designating boys’ use, they would no \nlonger protect Joel Doe’s expectation of privacy from viewing or being viewed by \n11 \n\nmembers of the opposite sex when he is present in multi-user private facilities such \nas bathrooms and locker rooms. \n61.  The  District’s  directive  to  Joel  Doe  was  that  he  must  change  with \nstudents of the opposite sex and make it as natural as possible and that anything less \nwould be intolerant and bullying against students who profess a gender identity with \nthe opposite sex. \n62.  After Joel Doe’s privacy was violated, the District’s actions marginalized \nand shamed Joel Doe, and unlawfully attempted to coerce and intimidate Joel Doe \ninto accepting continuing violations of his bodily privacy. \n63.  The anxiety, embarrassment, and stress he feels as a direct result of \nDefendants’ practice and actions has caused him to refrain from using restrooms as \nmuch as possible, stress about when and if he can use a given restroom without \nrunning into persons of the opposite sex, and opting to hold his bladder rather than \nusing the school’s restroom. This has caused an ever-present distraction throughout \nthe school day, including during class instructional time. \n64.  Failing to timely void urine has direct and adverse physiological effects, \nand the Defendants’ policy inhibits Joel Doe from timely voiding. \n65.  Joel Doe’s guardians made an appointment to speak with the assistant \nprincipal shortly thereafter, and met with Defendant Dr. Foley on or about November \n2, 2016. \n66.  Joel Doe’s guardians explained how Joel Doe’s bodily privacy had been \nviolated by the District’s actions and sought answers to ensure it did not happen \n12 \n\nagain.  It was then that Dr. Foley indicated that the school district is “all-inclusive” \nand that if Joel Doe had a problem changing or using restrooms with people of the \nopposite sex, he would get him permission to go to the nurse’s office to change. \n67.  Joel Doe’s guardians subsequently met with Dr. Cooper, the principal of \nBoyertown Area High School to voice their concerns.  Dr. Cooper was condescending \nto Joel Doe’s guardians and stated that he would not do anything because Joel Doe \ncan simply change in the nurse’s office from now on if he does not want to change \naround people of the opposite sex. \n68.  By mandating that Joel Doe use a nurse’s office to change if he wants \nprivacy, Defendants have prevented him from using the facilities that, by state and \nfederal law, are provided for use solely by males and that are required to ensure that \nstudents of one sex have their privacy protected from members of the opposite sex. \n69.  The District further marginalized, intimidated and shamed Joel Doe, by \ncontacting the principal at the Vo-Tech school, Berks Career and Technology School \n– Oley Campus (BCTS), where Joel Doe also attended half of the day, to disclose the \nfact that Joel Doe had gone to the Assistant Principal over the violation of his bodily \nprivacy. \n70.  On or about November 2, 2016, just two days after the incident where \nPlaintiff’s right to privacy was violated, the principal of BCTS, Mr. Jenkins, pulled \nJoel Doe out of class to have what Mr. Jenkins called a “casual conversation” about \nthe incident at Boyertown Area High School and stated “he wanted to make sure none \nof that negativity was going to happen at his school.” \n13 \n\n71.  Joel Doe felt harassed, shamed, and bullied by the District’s publication \nto BCTS about the incident and his concerns.  \n72.  Joel  Doe’s  guardians  scheduled  a  meeting  with  the  Defendant \nSuperintendent  Dr.  Faidley,  and  Dr.  Faidley  indicated  that  if  Joel  Doe  was \nuncomfortable changing with those of the opposite sex, or with using the nurse’s \noffice, then he could just withdraw from school and be home schooled, while still \nattending Vo-tech if he wished. \n73.   The District’s actions have forced Joel Doe to stop changing for PE class, \nwhich has resulted in disciplinary action and poor grades by only receiving half of the \nday’s credit for participating in street clothes rather than gym clothes. \n74.  Joel Doe feels violated, humiliated, and embarrassed by the invasion of \nprivacy. \n75.  Because of the privacy violation, as well as the District's subsequent \nactions, Joel Doe also experiences anxiety, stress, intimidation, fear, apprehension \nand loss of dignity. \n76.  These  daily  persistent  feelings  of  anxiety,  stress,  humiliation, \nembarrassment, apprehension, distress, and violation of privacy stay with Joel Doe \nand impact him throughout the day, distracting him from instructional time. \n77.  Joel  Doe  is  suffering  and  will  continue  to  suffer  irreparable  harm \nbecause of the Defendants’ actions. \n78.  Joel Doe has no adequate remedy at law. \nPlaintiff – Jack Jones \n14 \n\n79.  Jack Jones is a student at Boyertown Area High School, where he is \nenrolled in a physical education (“PE”) and Health course. \n80.  PE  is  a  mandatory  course  at  the  District  and  is  a  requirement  to \ngraduate. \n81.  It  is  mandatory  that  students  in  PE  class  change  into  clothing \nappropriate for PE class. \n82.  The PE locker rooms have signs which indicate they are either for girls \nor for boys. \n83.   Jack  Jones  has  always  used  the  boys’  locker  room  and  bathrooms \nbecause his sex is male. \n84.  Jack Jones has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the locker rooms \nand bathrooms in the school from viewing members of the opposite sex or from being \nviewed by members of the opposite sex. \n85.  Jack Jones absolutely does not object to students of the same sex using \nprivate facilities with him regardless of how they may subjectively self-identify their \ngender, and he has no expectation of privacy from members of the same sex. \n86.  On  or  about  the  first  week  of  November,  2016,  Jack  Jones  began \nchanging in the locker room for PE class, and when he was standing in his underwear \nabout  to  put  his  gym  clothes  on,  he  saw  classmates  gesturing  and  looking  at \nsomething behind him.  When he turned, he saw a member of the opposite sex in the \nlocker room with him, while he was in his underwear. \n87.  Jack  Jones  experienced  immediate  confusion,  embarrassment, \n15 \n\nhumiliation, and loss of dignity upon finding himself in this circumstance and quickly \nput his clothes on and left the locker room. \n88.  The District had not informed Jack Jones or his parents that despite the \nsigns on locker room and restroom doors designating boys’ use, they would no longer \nprotect Jack Jones’ expectation of privacy from viewing or being viewed by members \nof  the  opposite  sex  when  he  is  present  in  multi-user  private  facilities  such  as \nbathrooms and locker rooms. \n89.  Jack Jones informed his parents of how his privacy was violated, and \nJane Jones called and spoke to Dr. Cooper, relaying the violation of privacy that \noccurred to her son and asking for such infractions to stop.   \n90.  Dr. Cooper told Jane Jones that as far as the law is concerned, he has to \npermit girls that identify as boys to use private facilities with her son.  Dr. Cooper \ndid not offer any single-user facility for Jack Jones to use as an alternative.  \n91.  Jack Jones feels violated, humiliated, and embarrassed by the invasion \nof privacy. \n92.  Because of the privacy violation as well as the District's subsequent \nactions, Jack Jones also experiences anxiety, stress, intimidation, fear, apprehension \nand loss of dignity. \n93.  The anxiety, embarrassment, and stress he feels as a direct result of \nDefendants’ policy and actions has caused him to refrain from using restrooms as \nmuch as possible, stress about when and if he can use a given restroom without \nrunning into persons of the opposite sex, and opting to hold his bladder rather than \n16 \n\nusing the school’s restroom. This has caused an ever-present distraction throughout \nthe school day, including during class instructional time. \n94.  Failing to timely void urine has direct and adverse physiological effects, \nand the Defendants’ policy inhibits Jack Jones from timely voiding. \n95.  These  daily  persistent  feelings  of  anxiety,  stress,  humiliation, \nembarrassment, apprehension, distress, and violation of privacy stay with Jack Jones \nand impact him throughout the day, distracting him from instructional time. \n96.  Jack Jones is suffering and will continue to suffer irreparable harm \nbecause of the Defendants’ actions. \n97.  Jack Jones has no adequate remedy at law. \nPlaintiff – Mary Smith \n98.  Mary Smith is a student at Boyertown Area High School. \n99.  In March, 2017, Mary Smith entered a girls’ bathroom in the High \nSchool, and saw a male student washing hands in the sink. \n100.  The bathrooms have signs which indicate they are either for girls or for \nboys. \n101.  Mary Smith has always used the girls’ locker room and bathrooms \nbecause her sex is female. \n102.  Mary Smith has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the locker rooms \nand bathrooms in the school from viewing members of the opposite sex or from being \nviewed by members of the opposite sex. \n103.  Mary Smith absolutely does not object to students of the same sex using \n17 \n\nprivate facilities with her regardless of how they may subjectively self-identify their \ngender, and she has no expectation of privacy from members of the same sex.  \n104.  Mary  Smith  experienced  immediate  shock,  confusion  and \nembarrassment, and went to report the incident to the school office. \n105.  Mary Smith was told she’d have to come back later to talk with a \nprincipal. \n106.  Mary Smith used another restroom near the office after ensuring nobody \nelse was in it, because it was an emergency. \n107.  When Mary Smith returned to the office, she reported the incident to \nDr. Foley.  It was then that Mary Smith learned for the first time that the school was \nnow permitting members of the opposite sex to use the girls’ bathrooms. \n108.  Dr. Foley told her that even though the student’s sex is male, the student \ncould now use restrooms or locker rooms with her since he identifies as a girl. \n109.  Mary Smith told Dr. Foley that she had never heard this was happening \nand  inquired  whether  the  School  ever  told  her  parents  about  this.    Dr.  Foley \nresponded that they had not told parents about this but he believed the school might \nbe working on that. \n110.  Dr. Foley did not offer her any other options for her to use restrooms or \nlocker rooms outside the presence of male students, whether the nurse's office or \notherwise. \n111.  The District had not informed Mary Smith or her parents that despite \nthe signs on locker room and restroom doors designating girls’ use, they would no \n18 \n\nlonger protect Mary Smith’s expectation of privacy from viewing or being viewed by \nmembers of the opposite sex when she is present in multi-user private facilities such \nas bathrooms and locker rooms. \n112.  Mary Smith feels violated, humiliated, and embarrassed by the invasion \nof her privacy. \n113.  The anxiety, embarrassment, and stress she feels as a direct result of \nDefendants’ practice and actions has caused her to refrain from using restrooms as \nmuch as possible, stress about when and if she can use a given restroom without \nrunning into persons of the opposite sex, and opting to hold her bladder rather than \nusing the school’s restroom. This has caused an ever-present distraction throughout \nthe school day, including during class instructional time. \n114.  Failing to timely void urine has direct and adverse physiological effects, \nand the Defendants’ policy inhibits Mary Smith from timely voiding. \n115.  These  daily  persistent  feelings  of  anxiety,  stress,  humiliation, \nembarrassment, apprehension, distress, and violation of privacy stay with Mary \nSmith and impact her throughout the day, distracting her from instructional time. \nMary Smith is suffering and will continue to suffer irreparable harm because of the \nDefendants’ actions. \n116.  Mary Smith takes PE, and is required to take PE next year.  She does \nnot currently have persons of the opposite sex in her locker room, but has persistent \nfeelings of anxiety, stress, apprehension and distress that a person of the opposite sex \nmight enter the locker room when she is using it.  \n19 \n\n117.  As a result of the stress and anxiety caused by Defendant’s actions and \nthe new policy, she has determined that she will not return to the Boyertown Area \nSchool District for her senior year. \n118.  Mary Smith would continue going to school at Boyertown Area High \nSchool were it not for the District’s actions infringing on her right to use girls’ \nrestrooms and girls’ locker rooms outside of the presence of members of the opposite \nsex. \n119.  Mary Smith has no adequate remedy at law. \nPlaintiff – Macy Roe \n120.  Macy Roe is a student at Boyertown Area High School. \n121.  The bathrooms have signs which indicate they are either for girls or for \nboys. \n122.  Macy Roe has always used the girls’ locker room and bathrooms because \nher sex is female. \n123.  Macy Roe has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the locker rooms \nand bathrooms in the school from viewing members of the opposite sex or from being \nviewed by members of the opposite sex. \n124.  Macy Roe absolutely does not object to students of the same sex using \nprivate facilities with her regardless of how they may subjectively self-identify their \ngender, and she has no expectation of privacy from members of the same sex. \n125.  The District had not informed Macy Roe that despite the signs on locker \nroom and restroom doors designating girls’ use, they would no longer protect Macy \n20 \n\nRoe’s expectation of privacy from viewing or being viewed by members of the opposite \nsex when she is present in multi-user private facilities such as bathrooms and locker \nrooms. \n126.  The anxiety and stress she feels as a direct result of Defendants’ practice \nand actions has caused her to refrain from using restrooms as much as possible, stress \nabout when and if she can use a given restroom without running into persons of the \nopposite sex, and opting to hold her bladder rather than using the school’s restroom. \nThis has caused an ever-present distraction throughout the school day, including \nduring class instructional time. \n127.  Failing to timely void urine has direct and adverse physiological effects, \nand the Defendants’ policy inhibits Macy Roe from timely voiding. \n128.  These  daily  persistent  feelings  of  anxiety,  stress,  humiliation, \nembarrassment, apprehension, distress, and violation of privacy stay with Macy Roe \nand impact her throughout the day, distracting her from instructional time. \n129.  Macy Roe is suffering and will continue to suffer irreparable harm \nbecause of the Defendants’ actions. \nALLEGATIONS OF LAW \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION (ALL DEFENDANTS): \nVIOLATION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY  \nIN VIOLATION OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT  \nTO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n130.   Plaintiffs reallege all matters set forth above and incorporate them \nherein. \n21 \n\n131.  The  Fourteenth  Amendment  protects  citizens  against  violation  of \nfundamental rights by state actors. \n132.  Fundamental rights are liberty interests deeply rooted in the nation’s \nhistory and tradition and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.  \n133.  Plaintiffs  have  a  fundamental  right  to  bodily  privacy  that,  at  a \nminimum, includes an expectation of privacy in bathrooms and locker rooms from the \npresence of members of the opposite sex, protection from intimate exposure of their \nbodies and intimate activities to a person of the opposite sex, and includes the \ncorollary protection from intimate exposure by a person of the opposite sex.  \n134.   A woman’s right to bodily privacy does not spring into existence, or \ncease to exist, depending on what a man believes about the nature of his own internal \nsense of “gender identity.”  Her right to bodily privacy is hers and hers alone.   \n135.  A man’s right to bodily privacy does not spring into existence, or cease \nto exist, depending upon what a woman believes about the nature of her own internal \nsense of “gender identity.”  His right to bodily privacy is his and his alone. \n136.  The fundamental right to bodily privacy as to persons of the opposite sex \nis deeply rooted in the nation’s history and tradition and has been recognized as \nflowing from the United States Constitution as well as federal and state statutory \nand common law. See, e.g., Doe v. Luzerne County, 660 F.3d 169, 176 n.5 (3d Cir. \n2011) (holding that a person has a privacy interest in his or her “partially clothed \nbody,”  recognized  by  various  sister  circuits,  and  arising  out  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment); Borse v. Piece Goods Shop, Inc., 963 F.2d 611, 621 (3d Cir. 1992) \n22 \n\n(recognizing that the collection of urine samples may constitute an invasion of privacy \nif “it involves the use of one's senses to oversee the private activities of another” since \nthe performance in public of such activities are “generally prohibited by law as well \nas social custom” and failure to regard privacy “could constitute a substantial and \nhighly offensive intrusion upon seclusion”).  \n137.  The fundamental right to bodily privacy is also implicit in the concept of \nordered liberty because a government that compels its citizens to disrobe or attend to \nintimate activities in the presence of the opposite sex violates the core of personal \nliberty, and it deprives its citizens of the full benefits afforded to its citizens when it \nconditions those benefits on surrendering the right to bodily privacy.  \n138.  Throughout its history, American law and society has had a national \ncommitment to protecting citizens, and especially children, from suffering the risk of \nexposing their bodies, or their intimate activities, to the opposite sex. \n139.  Our understanding of personal privacy from persons of the opposite sex \nis so universal as to require the use of separate facilities on the basis of sex in all \nkinds of contexts. See Public School Code of 1949, 24 P.S. § 7-740 (requiring that \nfacilities “shall be suitably constructed for, and used separately by the sexes”). See \nalso 43 P.S. § 109 (requiring application of industrial sanitation code to all employers, \nwhich involves separate restrooms); 7 Pa. Code § 1.57 (requiring separate facilities \nfor meat packers); 7 Pa. Code § 78.75 (separate restrooms at eating establishments); \n7 Pa. Code § 82.9 (requiring separate facilities on the basis of sex for seasonal farm \nlabor, “distinctly marked ‘for men’ and ‘for women’ by signs printed in English and in \n23 \n\nthe native languages of the persons” using those facilities); 28 Pa. Code § 18.62 \n(requiring  “separate  dressing  facilities,  showers,  lavatories,  toilets  and \nappurtenances for each sex” at swimming pools); 25 Pa. Code § 171.16 (requiring \nschools to follow the provisions of the Public Bathing Law (35 P. S. § §  672—680d) \nand 28 Pa. Code Chapter 18 (relating to swimming and bathing places); 28 Pa. Code \n§19.21 (requiring separate restrooms on the basis of sex at camps); 28 Pa. Code § \n205.38 (requiring separate restrooms at long term care facilities); 31 Pa. Code § \n41.121 (requiring separate facilities for each sex on railroads); 31 Pa. Code § 41.122 \n(requiring separate bathrooms to be provided for each sex and clearly designated and \nforbidding any person to use or frequent a toilet room assigned to the opposite sex); \n31 Pa. Code § 47.127 (same); 34 Pa. Code § 403.28 (requiring restrooms for each sex); \n43 Pa. Code § 41.24 (designating the entrance of “retiring rooms” to be clearly marked \nby sex and preventing opposite sex entry); 43 Pa. Code § 41.31 (requiring separate \ntoilet rooms “for each sex” which shall be clearly designated and that “no person shall \nbe permitted to use or frequent a toilet room assigned to the opposite sex”); 43 Pa. \nCode § 41.32 (requiring partitions separating toilet rooms on account of sex, which \nshall be “soundproof”). \n140.  The importance of personal privacy is also recognized in the context of \ndiscrimination law, and specifically in the situation that Plaintiffs face. See, e.g., \nLivingwell, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Human Relations Com., 606 A.2d 1287, 1290 (Pa. \nCommw. Ct. 1992) (citing City of Philadelphia v. Pa. Human Relations Com., 300 \nA.2d 97 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1973), and recognizing that employers may hire on the basis \n24 \n\nof sex to vindicate “a juvenile's ‘privacy interest’” that “would be violated if required \nto . . . disrobe and shower in front of a staff member of the opposite sex”). “[W]here \nthere is a distinctly private activity involving exposure of intimate body parts, there \nexists an implied bona fide public accommodation qualification which may justify \notherwise  illegal  sex  discrimination.  Otherwise  .  .  .  such  sex  segregated \naccommodations such as bathrooms, showers and locker rooms, would have to be open \nto the public.” Id. at 1291.  \n141.  “The standard for recognizing a privacy interest as it relates to one's \nbody is not limited to protecting one where there is an exposure of an ‘intimate area,’ \nbut such a right may also be recognized where one has a reasonable basis to be \nprotected against embarrassment or suffer a loss of dignity because of the activity \ntaking place.” Id. “To hold otherwise would mean that separate changing rooms in \nfactories, mines and construction sites where workers change from street clothes to \nwork clothes and back and where ‘intimate areas’ are not exposed, would not be \npermitted.” Id. at 1293 n.6. \n142.  Personal privacy is also recognized in the context of criminal law. See, \ne.g., id. at 1289 (quoting 18 Pa.C.S. § 5901 to make the point that “certain conduct . . \n. between genders is inappropriate. For example, it is a misdemeanor to commit open \nlewdness because those who observe it ‘would be affronted or alarmed.’”). See also 18 \nPa.C.S.A. § 7507.1 (regarding viewing or filming a person in a state of undress \nwithout their consent in a place where a person “would have a reasonable expectation \nof privacy”); 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3127 (regarding the exposure of genitalia in circumstances \n25 \n\nwhere a person should know that it “is likely to offend, affront or alarm”). \n143.  Criminal protections are heightened for children. See, e.g., § 3127(b) \n(increasing the severity of an indecent exposure charge based on age). \n144.  While  pornography  involving  only  adults  is  legal  and  cannot  be \nconstitutionally banned, it is illegal to possess, distribute, or even view images of \nnaked children. See 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 6312. \n145.  Nearly every state has a law criminalizing “sexting,” which is when a \nminor sends a naked picture of himself or herself via electronic means. See, e.g., 18 \nPa.C.S.A. § 6321. \n146.  Because  of  our  national  commitment  to  protect  our  citizens,  and \nespecially children, from the risk of being exposed to the anatomy of the opposite sex, \nas well as the risk of being seen by the opposite sex while attending to private, \nintimate needs, sex-separated restrooms and locker rooms are ubiquitous in public \nplaces. \n147.  Using  public  restrooms  and  locker  rooms  separated  by  sex  are  an \nAmerican social and modesty norm. \n148.  Historically, purposefully entering a restroom or locker room designated \nfor the opposite biological sex has been considered wrongful, and even criminal, \nbehavior. \n149.  Freedom from the risk of compelled intimate exposure to the opposite \nsex, especially for minors, is deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition. \n150.  It is also implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. \n26 \n\n151.  The ability to disrobe absent the presence of the opposite sex, along with \nthe  freedom  to  use  the  restroom  absent  the  presence  of  the  opposite  sex  is \nfundamental to most people’s sense of self-respect and personal dignity. \n152.  If the government were granted the far-reaching and extreme power to \ncompel its citizens to disrobe or risk being unclothed in the presence of the opposite \nsex, then little personal liberty involving our bodies would be left. \n153.  Because freedom from the risk of compelled exposure to the opposite \nbiological sex, especially for minors, is deeply rooted in this nation’s history and \ntradition and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, it is a fundamental right. See \nWashington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721 (1997). \n154.  Specifically: minors have a fundamental right to be free from State \ncompelled risk of exposure of their bodies, or their intimate activities, such as occur \nwithin restrooms and locker rooms, to the opposite anatomical/biological sex. \n155.  An  abridgement  of  fundamental  rights  is  presumptively \nunconstitutional and can only be justified if it survives strict scrutiny under which \nthe law must serve a compelling state interest by the most narrowly tailored means. \n156.  The  Defendants’  actions  and  practice  violated  Doe’s  and  Jones’ \nfundamental right to privacy because it allowed a biological female into the boys’ \nlocker room and bathrooms and subjected Doe and Jones to finding themselves in \ntheir underwear in front of someone of the opposite sex. And in Doe’s case the person \nof the opposite sex was herself also in a state of undress. \n157.  Shocked and distressed, Doe met with Defendant Dr. Foley. \n27 \n\n158.  When Doe asked to be protected from the situation, Dr. Foley told him \nthat there was nothing he could do and that instead, he and his friends would have \nto share the boys’ locker room with a person of the opposite sex. They were told to \ntolerate it and make it as natural as possible. \n159.  Even though after Jane Doe and John Doe got involved, Doe was told \nthat he could use the nurse’s office to change for gym class, he was still required to \nenter the locker room in order to safely store his belongings. This would still subject \nDoe to viewing a person of the opposite sex in state of undress. \n160.  Moreover, the policy harms Doe because unless he surrenders his right \nto bodily privacy, he can no longer use the locker room or restrooms designed for use \nby boys. \n161.  While the Public School Code of 1949 requires that facilities “shall be \nsuitably  constructed  for,  and  used  separately  by,  the  sexes,”  24  P.S.  §  7-740, \nDefendants’ policy violates the requirement of separate facilities and denies Doe the \nright to use such a facility, instead conditioning the use of the “boys’” locker room on \nsurrendering Doe’s right to bodily privacy from persons of the opposite sex. See also \n25 Pa. Code § 171.7 (requiring separate facilities “for each sex” in schools). Accord 22 \nPa. Code § 55.2 (same for private elementary schools); 22 Pa. Code § 57.2(a) (same for \nprivate secondary schools); 22 Pa. Code § 59.34(a) (same for private special education \nschools). \n162.  Doe and his guardians on multiple occasions brought up the policy with \nthe Assistant Principal, the Principal, and the Superintendent, but their requests for \n28 \n\na change in the District’s policy were denied. \n163.  Doe and his guardians were told that the school was no longer going to \ndiscuss this issue with them or any parents.  \n164.  Doe ultimately decided to not change for gym class, which resulted in \nfailing each gym class. \n165.   As for Jack Jones, even though his mother, Jane Jones got involved, \nthey were not told that there were any other options than changing in the same locker \nroom than a biological female. \n166.  Based on Defendants’ policy, Doe, Jones, Smith, and Roe all risk the \nsame violations in the future. \n167.  The policy harms Doe, and Jones, because unless they surrender their \nright to bodily privacy, they can no longer use the locker room or restrooms designed \nfor use by boys. \n168.  The policy harms Smith and Roe, because unless they surrender their \nright to bodily privacy, they can no longer use the locker room or restrooms designed \nfor use by girls. \n169.  All Plaintiffs risk the violation of their personal privacy by persons of \nthe opposite sex in the restroom. While bathroom toilets do have stalls, their doors \nlike most bathroom stall doors have gaps at joints and gaps from the floor that \nundermine personal privacy when in a state of undress and in the presence of persons \nof the opposite biological sex. But even if stalls were completely enclosed from floor \nto ceiling with no gaps, the privacy rights of students begin at the door of the \n29 \n\nrestrooms or locker rooms, not at the door of a stall. \n170.  The Defendants have no compelling interest to justify this violation of \nPlaintiffs’ right to bodily privacy from persons of the opposite sex.  \n171.  The violation of this right is particularly acute where, as here, Plaintiffs’ \nrights were first violated without any notice or consent in a place traditionally--and \nby state statute--reserved for persons of one biological sex. \n172.  The violation was ongoing because it compromises the most intimate \naspects of human affairs and involves a setting traditionally (and by state law) \nreserved for persons of one biological sex. It effectively denies the appropriate use of \nthis setting in a manner conveying sexual harassment and official bullying, and \nwhich is otherwise inconsistent with deeply rooted notions of fundamental personal \ninterests in personal privacy from persons of the opposite biological sex. \n173.  Defendants failed to employ the least restrictive means of serving any \ninterest that they may later articulate. \n174.  Accordingly, the actions and practice fail strict scrutiny review and are \nunconstitutional.  \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the relief set \nforth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION (ALL DEFENDANTS): \nVIOLATION OF TITLE IX \n \n175.  Plaintiffs reallege all matters set forth above and incorporate them \nherein. \n30 \n\n176.  Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the \nbasis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected  to  discrimination  under  any  education  program  or  activity  receiving \nFederal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n177.  The School District is a federal funding recipient for purposes of Title \nIX. \n178.  Courts  have  given  Title  IX  broad  effect  in  order  to  combat  sex \ndiscrimination in the educational setting. \n179.  There is an implied right of action for a student to sue his school and \nschool officials under Title IX. \n180.  Defendants’ authorizing people to use restrooms or locker rooms that \nare designated for the opposite biological sex violates privacy and creates a sexually \nharassing hostile environment. \n181.  Unconsented exposure to persons of the opposite sex in bathrooms and \nlocker rooms, which exist to permit people to enter various states of undress without \nmembers  of  the  opposite  sex  present,  creates  a  sexually  harassing  hostile \nenvironment. \n182.  The policy of the school is to allow those who self-identify with the \nopposite  biological  sex  to  choose  to  use  locker  rooms  and  restrooms  that  are \ndesignated for the opposite biological sex. \n183.  Plaintiffs do not object to students of the same sex using private facilities \nwith them, and welcome them no matter how they self-identify, and they have no \n31 \n\nexpectation of privacy from such students. \n184.  This policy needlessly subjects Plaintiffs to the risk that their partially \nunclothed body will be exposed to the opposite sex and that they will be exposed to a \npartially clothed person of the opposite-sex. Doe and Jones were both in a state of \nundress in the presence of someone of the opposite sex, and in Doe’s case, the female \nwas also in a state of undress. \n185.  As  a  result,  Doe  and  Jones  both  experienced  embarrassment, \nhumiliation, frustration, degradation, and loss of dignity. \n186.  As a result, Smith experienced embarrassment and anxiety as a result \nof finding a male in her bathroom. \n187.  Doe has been marginalized by other students on account of his objection \nto the policy. \n188.  Plaintiffs  are  avoiding  the  restroom  as  a  result  of  the  fear  and \napprehension of embarrassment, humiliation, degradation, and loss of dignity they \nmay experience in the restroom. \n189.  Doe  has  altogether  ceased  using  the  locker  room  because  of  the \nlegitimate fear that he will again be in a state of undress or exposed to an opposite \nsex student in a state of undress. \n190.  Doe cannot store his clothes in the locker room since that would again \nput him in the locker room where he may be exposed to an opposite sex student in a \nstate of undress. \n191.  Doe is now taking a failing grade every day he does not change. \n32 \n\n192.  The policy violates Title IX because it intentionally produces unwelcome \nsexual harassment and creates a hostile environment on the basis of sex and denies \naccess to educational programs and benefits. \n193.  In order to make out a Title IX claim: (1) plaintiff must be subjected to \nsexual harassment; (2) the harassment must be severe, pervasive, and objectively \noffensive; (3) the school must be deliberately indifferent to the harassment; and (4) \nthe harassment must result in the denial of access. \n194.  Plaintiffs satisfy all elements. \n195.  First, Plaintiffs are subjected to harassment because the practice allows \nbiological females to use the boys’ locker rooms and restrooms, which creates a \nharassing hostile environment specifically on the basis of the sex of the persons \ninvolved. \n196.  Differences in reproductive anatomy are the only reason for separate \nfacilities. Were there no differences in anatomy, there would be no privacy interests \njustifying separate facilities in the first place. \n197.  These differences do not disappear when biological females self-identify \nas males, and vice versa. \n198.  Neither state nor federal law obligate Defendants to provide multi-user \nprivate facilities based on what a student wears, whom the student is sexually \nattracted to, how the student presents or identifies him or herself, or based on \nwhether a student identifies with their sex or with the opposite sex. \n199.  The anatomical differences between the sexes is the reason that Title IX \n33 \n\nand its implementing regulations allow for separate living facilities, restrooms, locker \nrooms, and changing areas for each biological sex. \n200.  Title IX and its implementing regulations provide for separate living \nfacilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and changing areas for each biological sex based \non the recognition that permitting a person of one biological sex to enter and use the \nfacilities designated for the opposite sex would be sexually harassing.   \n201.  The  policy,  which  opens  the  boys’  restrooms  and  locker  rooms  to \nbiological females, is harassment based on the boys’ sex. \n202.  The  policy,  which  opens  the  girls’  restrooms  and  locker  rooms  to \nbiological males, is harassment based on the girls’ sex. \n203.  Doe, Jones, and Smith experienced humiliation, degradation, and loss of \ndignity and fear the same in the future as a result of the policy and practice. \n204.  Roe  experiences  persistent  feelings  of  anxiety,  stress,  humiliation, \nembarrassment, apprehension, and distress which stay with her and impact her \nthroughout the day. \n205.  The school’s removal of privacy based on significant and real anatomical \ndifferences between the biological sexes creates the hostile environment, which is \nharassment. \n206.  Second, the harassment is severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive. \n207.  Letting biological females use the boys’ restrooms and locker rooms \nplaces the bodily privacy of both sexes at risk, and so is sufficiently egregious to \nsatisfy the severity prong. \n34 \n\n208.  The harassment is ongoing and continuous, preventing Doe from using \nthe locker room and discouraging him from using the restrooms without giving up his \nright to privacy, thus satisfying the pervasiveness prong. \n209.  The environment is one that a reasonable person would find hostile and \nobjectively offensive, and one that Doe, Jones, Smith, and Roe in fact perceive to be \nso. \n210.  The objective unreasonableness is evident in the fact that we have long \nrecognized the right to a private setting, free from persons of the opposite sex in \nrestrooms  and  locker  rooms,  where  we  often  enter  into  a  state  of  undress  or \nperformance of private functions.  \n211.  This principle is recognized in numerous areas of the law, as stated \nabove. \n212.  Third, school officials are not only on notice of the hostile environment, \nbut it is the Defendants’ policy that establishes and sustains the hostile environment. \n213.  Moreover, Doe and his Guardians repeatedly notified the individual \nDefendants, who then told Doe and his Guardians that this is what the school will be \ndoing as a matter of policy. \n214.  The Defendants have authority to rescind their policy which would \nresolve the hostile environment created by that policy. \n215.  Despite  their  knowledge  that  their  practice  is  creating  a  hostile \nenvironment based on sex, the Defendants have not remedied the situation. \n216.  Instead, these officials initially advised that Doe should tolerate the \n35 \n\nviolation of his privacy and told him twice, to act as natural as possible.  \n217.  Subsequently,  these  officials  advised  that  if  Doe  perceives  the \nenvironment to be hostile, he should remove himself from it by using the nurse’s \noffice. \n218.  Schools cannot escape liability for Title IX violations by requiring the \nvictim  of  harassment  to  remove  themselves  from  the  hostile  environment  or \notherwise suggesting that they are responsible for the harassment they endure.   \n219.  Fourth, Plaintiffs have been effectively denied the use of facilities that \nare to be provided, pursuant to state and federal law, on account of their biological \nsex. \n220.  This  has  also  resulted  in  Doe’s  inability  to  change  and  store  his \nbelongings in the locker room, thus resulting in failing grades during each day of gym \nclass. \n221.  Defendants’ policy and actions violate Title IX by creating a hostile \nenvironment on the basis of sex. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the relief set \nforth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION (DOE AND JONES V. ALL DEFENDANTS): \nINVASION OF PRIVACY - INTRUSION UPON SECLUSION \n \n222.  Plaintiffs reallege all matters set forth above and incorporate them \nherein.   \n223.  Defendants purposely opened up the boys’ locker room and restroom to \n36 \n\nbiological females who identify with the opposite sex; and opened up the girls’ locker \nroom and restroom to biological males who identify with the opposite sex. \n224.  As a result, Doe found himself in only his underwear in the presence of \na biological female, who was wearing nothing above her waist other than a bra. \n225.  As a result, Jones, found himself in only his underwear in the presence \nof a biological female. \n226.  As a result, Smith found herself in a bathroom, alone with a biological \nmale. \n227.  One’s partially clothed body is a private affair, particularly with regards \nto a member of the opposite sex. \n228.  However, even where one does not remove clothing in these bathrooms \nor locker rooms, it is sufficient under the law that the seclusion of the bathroom or \nlocker room, a private area, was intruded upon. \n229.  Defendants’ policy, therefore, caused Doe’s private affairs to be intruded \nupon by being viewed by someone of the opposite sex in his underwear and intruded \nupon his privacy by forcing him to be at a place to see a partially clothed female body. \n230.  Defendants’ policy caused Jones’ private affairs to be intruded upon by \nbeing viewed by someone of the opposite sex in his underwear. \n231.  Laws and social custom have long protected our right to privacy from \nmembers of the opposite sex in these areas to ensure freedom  from undressing in the \nview of someone of the opposite sex and to freedom from viewing someone of the \nopposite sex undressing. \n37 \n\n232.  In particular, laws applicable to public schools require separate facilities \non the basis of sex, which has always been understood to mean on the basis of \nbiological/anatomical sex.  \n233.  Defendants’  practice  failed  to  give  due  regard  to  Doe’s  and  Jones’ \nprivacy. \n234.  Therefore, the circumstances in which Doe and Jones found themselves, \nparticularly in a setting designed to be private with regards to persons of the opposite \nsex, would be highly offensive to the ordinary reasonable person. \n235.  Plaintiffs lack ongoing access to the locker rooms and bathrooms of their \nsex and are discouraged in their use of the restroom of their sex as a result of this \ninvasion of seclusion. \n236.  Additionally, Doe, currently in P.E. class, has been receiving failing \ngrades in gym class due to this invasion of seclusion. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the relief set \nforth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  pray  for  judgment  against  the  Defendants,  jointly \nand/or severally, as follows: \nA.  A declaration that the Defendants’ policy and actions violate Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional right to privacy. \nB.  A declaration that Defendants’ policy and actions were a violation of the \nPennsylvania School Code of 1949. \n38 \n\n\n\nJACOB KRATT, PA 316920  JEREMY L.

August 25, 2017 \n  The  current  issue  before  the  court  –  whether  the  court  should  issue  a  preliminary \ninjunction prohibiting a school district from maintaining its practice that started in the 2016-17 \nschool year of allowing transgender students to use the bathrooms and locker rooms of the sex to \nwhich they identify – involves intricate and genuine issues relating to, inter alia, the personal \nprivacy of  high school students, a school district’s discretion and judgment relating to the \nconduct of students in its schools, the meaning of the word “sex” in Title IX, and the rights of all \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 2 of 142\nstudents to complete access to educational opportunities, programs, and activities available at \nschool.  The general issue of transgender persons’ access to privacy facilities such as bathrooms \nhas recently received nationwide attention, and the issue of transgender students’ access to \neducational  institutions’  bathrooms  and  locker  rooms  aligning  to  their  gender  identity  has \nspurred  litigation  with  unsurprisingly  inconsistent  results.    With  regard  to  cases  involving \ntransgender students, they have generally centered on whether precluding transgender students \nfrom using facilities consistent with their gender identity violates those students’ rights under the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or Title IX.  And as to Title IX, which \ngenerally precludes public schools receiving federal financial assistance from discriminating “on \nthe basis of sex,” this has resulted in a debate as to whether “sex” refers to biological sex (which \nthe plaintiffs in this case define as a person’s classification as male or female at birth based on \nthe presence of external and internal reproductive organs) or a broader and arguably more \ncontemporary definition of sex that could include sex stereotyping or gender identity. \n  Here,  the  court  is  presented  with  four  students,  three  who  will  be  seniors  for  the \nupcoming  2017-18  school  year  and  one  student  who  recently  graduated,  claiming  that  the \ndefendant school district’s practice of allowing transgender students (who the plaintiffs choose to \nidentify  as  “members  of  the  opposite  sex”  rather  than  as  transgender  students)  to  access \nbathrooms and locker rooms consistent with their gender identity violates (1) their constitutional \nright  to  privacy  under  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  (2)  their  right  of  access  to  educational \nopportunities, programs, benefits, and activities under Title IX because they are subject to a \nhostile  environment,  and  (3)  their  Pennsylvania  common  law  right  of  privacy  preventing \nintrusion upon their seclusion while using bathrooms and locker rooms.  The plaintiffs not only \nraise concerns with being in privacy facilities with transgender students regardless of whether the \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 3 of 142\ntransgender students actually view them in a state of partial undress, but they raise concerns with \nthe possibility of viewing a transgender person in a state of undress or having a transgender \nperson present to hear  them while they  are  attending to their personal needs while in the \nbathroom.  At bottom, the plaintiffs are opposed to the mere presence of transgender students in \nlocker rooms or bathrooms with them because they designate them as members of the opposite \nsex and note that, inter alia, society has historically separated bathrooms and locker rooms on \nthe basis of biological sex to preserve the privacy of individuals from members of the opposite \nbiological sex. \nThe plaintiffs now seek a preliminary injunction which would require the school district \nto cease its practice and return to the prior practice of requiring all students to only use the \nprivacy facilities corresponding to their biological sex.  The plaintiffs have a heavy burden here \nbecause they are not seeking to preserve the status quo that has existed since the start of the \n2016-17 school year and instead are seeking to have the school district cease its current practice. \nThe court has thoroughly reviewed all evidence in the record and has considered the \nparties’ well-articulated arguments in support of their respective positions.  After reviewing the \nentire record, the court finds that the plaintiffs are not entitled to preliminary injunctive relief \nbecause they have not shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits on any of their causes \nof action and they have failed to show irreparable harm.  Accordingly, the court will deny the \nplaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. \nI.    SUBJECT-MATTER JURISDICTION \n  The court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343, \nand 1367.1 \n                                                 \n1 In the amended complaint, the plaintiffs reference 28 U.S.C. § 1361, the federal Mandamus Act, as a possible basis \nfor subject-matter jurisdiction over this action against a school district and three school district administrators.  It \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 4 of 142\nII.  VENUE \n  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2).2 \nIII.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n  The initial plaintiff in this matter, Joel Doe, a minor, by and through his guardians, John \nDoe and Jane Doe, commenced this action on March 21, 2017, by filing (1) a complaint against \nthe defendants, Boyertown Area School District (the “School District”), Dr. Richard Faidley, in \nhis official capacity, Dr. Brett Cooper, in his official capacity, and Dr. E. Wayne Foley, in his \nofficial capacity, and (2) a motion to proceed pseudonymously.  Doc. Nos. 1-4.  On April 3, \n2017, Aidan DeStefano, who was then a senior at the Boyertown Area Senior High School, and \nthe Pennsylvania Youth Congress Foundation (“PYC”), a youth-led, statewide LGBTQ advocacy \norganization, filed a motion to intervene in this litigation.  Doc. No. 7. \n  On April 18, 2017, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint in which three new plaintiffs \nwere added to this litigation: (1) Mary Smith, (2) Jack Jones, a minor, by and through his \nparents, John Jones and Jane Jones, and (3) Macy Roe.  Doc. No. 8.  In the amended complaint, \nthe  plaintiffs  generally  complain  that  the  defendants’  policy  and  practice  of  permitting \ntransgender individuals (who are identified as members of the “opposite sex” instead of being \nidentified as “transgender”) to use restrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities designated for \nthe biological sex to which they identify violates the plaintiffs’ “fundamental right to bodily \nprivacy contrary to constitutional and statutory principles, including the Fourteenth Amendment, \nTitle IX, invasion of seclusion [under Pennsylvania state law], and Pennsylvania’s Public School \n                                                                                                                                                             \ndoes not appear that the court has jurisdiction under section 1361 because “by its terms, [section 1361] applies only \nto writs issued against an ‘officer or employee of the United States.’”  Weaver v. Wilcox, 650 F.2d 22, 25 (3d Cir. \n1981) (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1361).  It does not appear that any defendant is an officer or employee of the United \nStates. \n2 Again, the plaintiffs reference 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) as a basis for venue, but that subsection only pertains to \n“[a]ctions where [a] defendant is officer or employee of the United States[.]” 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e).  As previously \nindicated, it does not appear that the plaintiffs include a claim against an officer or employee of the United States. \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 5 of 142\nCode of 1949, which requires separate facilities on the basis of sex.”3  Amended Compl. at ¶¶ 1, \n2, 20, 41.  For relief, the plaintiffs seek, inter alia, (1) declarations that the defendants’ policy \nand actions (a) violate their constitutional right to privacy, (b) violate the Pennsylvania School \nCode of 1949, (c) constitute an unlawful intrusion upon Joel Doe and Jack Jones’s seclusion and \nbodily privacy rights, and (d) impermissibly burden their rights under Title IX to be free from \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex by creating a sexually harassing hostile environment, (2) an \ninjunction “enjoining the District’s policy and ordering the District to permit only females to \nenter and use the multi-user girls’ private facilities, including locker rooms and restrooms, and \nonly males to enter and use the multi-user boys’ private facilities, including locker rooms and \nrestrooms,” (3) compensatory damages, and (4) costs and attorney’s fees.  Id. at 38-39. \n  With regard to the specific factual allegations pertaining to each plaintiff, Joel Doe \nalleges that he was a junior at the Boyertown Area Senior High School on or about October 31, \n2016, and was changing in the boys’ locker room for his mandatory physical education course.  \nId. at ¶¶ 10, 43, 50.  While standing in his underwear and about to put on his gym clothes, he \nobserved a “member of the opposite sex changing with him in the locker room.”  Id. at ¶ 50.  \nThis “member of the opposite sex” was “wearing nothing but shorts and a bra.”  Id. \n  Due  to  Joel  Doe’s  “immediate  confusion,  embarrassment,  humiliation,  and  loss  of \ndignity,” he “quickly put his clothes on and left the locker room.”  Id. at ¶ 51.  Joel Doe, along \nwith other classmates, then went to Dr. Foley, the assistant principal of the Boyertown Area \n                                                 \n3 The plaintiffs bring their Fourteenth Amendment claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Amended Compl. at ¶ 2.  \nAdditionally, although the plaintiffs claim that the defendants’ actions violate the Pennsylvania Public School Code \nof 1949, there is no specific cause of action for this violation in the amended complaint and it is unclear whether the \nPublic School Code provides for a private right of action.  See Issa v. School Dist. of Lancaster, 847 F.3d 121,141 \n(3d Cir. 2017) (indicating that there is no express cause of action under the Public School Code, but leaving issue \nunresolved as to whether there is an implied right of action).  Instead, the amended complaint asserts only causes of \naction for violations of the Fourteenth Amendment, Title IX, and Pennsylvania’s common law tort of intrusion upon \nseclusion.  See generally Amended Compl. at 21-39.  The court notes that the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief that \nthe defendants’ actions violated the School Code.  See id. at 38. \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 6 of 142\nSenior High School, to let him know what happened.  Id. at ¶¶ 22, 52.  When Joel Doe informed \nDr. Foley that there had been a girl in the locker room, Dr. Foley indicated that although the \nlegality of this was up in the air, students who mentally identified themselves with the opposite \nsex could choose the locker room and bathroom to use because their physical sex did not matter.  \nId. at ¶ 53.  Dr. Foley also told Joel Doe that there was nothing he could do to protect him from \nthis situation and that he needed to “‘tolerate’ it and make it as ‘natural’ as he possibly [could].”  \nId. at ¶¶ 54-56. \nThe plaintiffs assert that this action “marginalized and shamed Joel Doe, and unlawfully \nattempted to coerce and intimidate [him] into accepting continuing violations of his bodily \nprivacy.”  Id. at ¶ 62.  They further assert that the School District’s “directive to Joel Doe was \nthat he must change with students of the opposite sex and make it as natural as possible and that \nanything less would be intolerant and bullying against students who profess a gender identity \nwith the opposite sex.”  Id. at ¶ 61. \n  Because the School District’s policy of allowing persons of the opposite sex to use the \nboys’ facilities causes him anxiety, embarrassment, and stress, Joel Doe has opted to hold his \nbladder and refrain from using restrooms as much about possible and, to the extent that he needs \nto use the restroom, he stresses about whether he could use a restroom without running into \npersons of the opposite sex.  Id. at ¶ 63.  Thus, the defendants’ policy inhibits him from timely \nvoiding, which has “direct and adverse physiological effects.”  Id. at ¶ 64. \n  Joel Doe’s parents, John and Jane Doe, separately met with Dr. Foley, Dr. Cooper, and \nDr. Faidley to discuss this issue.4  See id. at ¶¶ 65-72.  They met with Dr. Foley on or about \n                                                 \n4 The plaintiffs also allege that Joel Doe was a student for half of the day at the Berks Career and Technology \nSchool – Oley Campus (“BCTS”).  Amended Compl. at ¶ 69.  The plaintiffs allege that the School District \n“marginalized, intimidated, and shamed Joel Doe” by contacting the principal at BCTS to disclose Joel Doe’s \nmeeting with Dr. Foley over the locker room incident.  Id.  The BCTS principal then pulled Joel Doe out of class to \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 7 of 142\nNovember 2, 2016, and, during this meeting, Dr. Foley informed them that the School District \nwas “‘all-inclusive’” and that if Joel Doe had an issue with the policy, Dr. Foley would get him \npermission to use the nurse’s office to change.  Id. at ¶ 66.  Mr. and Mrs. Doe then met with Dr. \nCooper, the principal of Boyertown Area Senior High School, and Dr. Cooper told them that he \nwould not do anything since Joel Doe could change in the nurse’s office if he did not want to \nchange around people of the opposite sex.  Id. at ¶ 67.  Ultimately, they met with Dr. Faidley, \nwho informed them that if Joel Doe was uncomfortable changing under the new policy or with \nusing  the  nurse’s  office,  he  could  withdraw  from  school  to  be  home  schooled  while  still \nattending BCTS if he wanted.  Id. at ¶ 72. \n  As for Jack Jones, he was also a junior at the Boyertown Area Senior High School for the \n2016-17 school year.  Id. at ¶ 12.  During the first week of November 2016, he was changing in \nthe  locker  room  for  his  physical  education  class  and  was  in  his  underwear  when  he  saw \nclassmates gesturing and looking at something behind them.  Id. at ¶ 86.  Upon turning, he saw a \nmember of the opposite sex in the locker room with him.  Id.  He then “experienced immediate \nconfusion, embarrassment, humiliation, and loss of dignity,” and put on his clothes and exited \nthe locker room.  Id. at ¶ 87. \n  Jack Jones informed his parents about the incident and his mother, Jane Jones, contacted \nand spoke to Dr. Cooper.  Id. at ¶ 89.  Jane Jones informed Dr. Cooper about the privacy \nviolation and asked “for such infractions to stop.”  Id.  Dr. Cooper informed her that the law \nrequired him to permit girls identifying as boys to use the private facilities with her son.  Id. at ¶ \n90.  He did not offer any single-user facility for Jack Jones to use as an alternative.  Id. \n                                                                                                                                                             \nhave a conversation with him.  Id. at ¶ 70.  During this conversation, the BCTS principal told Joel Doe that “‘he \nwanted to make sure none of that negativity was going to happen at his school.’” Id. \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 8 of 142\n  Similar  to  Joel  Doe,  Jack  Jones  feels  violated,  humiliated,  and  embarrassed  by  the \ninvasion of privacy.  Id. at ¶ 91.  He also opts to hold his bladder, refrains from using the \nrestrooms as much as possible, and stresses about whether he can use a restroom without running \ninto members of the opposite sex.  Id. at ¶ 93.  This causes him an “ever-present distraction \nthroughout the day, including during class instructional time.”  Id. at ¶ 94. \n  Concerning Mary Smith, she was a junior at the Boyertown Area Senior High School for \nthe 2016-17 school year.  Id. at ¶ 11.  In March 2017, she entered a girls’ bathroom at the high \nschool and saw a male student washing his hands in the sink.  Id. at ¶ 99.  After immediately \nexperiencing shock, confusion, and embarrassment, she went to report the incident to the school \noffice.  Id. at ¶ 104.  She eventually was able to report the incident to Dr. Foley, and during her \nconversation with him she learned for the first time that the school was permitting members of \nthe opposite sex to use the girls’ bathrooms.  Id. at ¶¶ 105-07.  Dr. Foley stated that even though \nthe student’s sex is male, the student could use the girls’ restrooms and locker rooms because the \nstudent identified as a girl.  Id. at ¶ 108.  Dr. Foley also indicated that they had not told parents \nabout this policy, but he noted that they might be working on that.  Id. at ¶ 109.  Dr. Foley did \nnot offer Mary Smith the option to use restrooms or locker rooms outside the presence of male \nstudents, such as the nurse’s office.  Id. at ¶ 110. \n  As  with  the  Joel  Doe and  Jack Jones,  Mary  Smith  “feels  violated,  humiliated,  and \nembarrassed by the invasion of her privacy.”  Id. at ¶ 112.  She also opts to hold her bladder, \nrefrains from using the restrooms as much as possible, and stresses about whether she can use a \nrestroom without running into members of the opposite sex.  Id. at ¶ 113.  This causes her an \n“ever-present distraction throughout the day, including during class instructional time.”  Id.  She \nhas also alleged that due to the stress and anxiety caused by the new policy and the defendants’ \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 9 of 142\nactions, she is not returning to the School District for her senior year.  Id. at ¶ 117.  She would \nhave returned for her senior year if the School District’s policy was not in place.  Id. at ¶ 118. \n  Regarding the final plaintiff, Macy Roe, she is an 18-year-old girl who was a senior at the \nBoyertown Area Senior High School for the 2016-17 school year.  Id. at ¶ 13.  It does not appear \nfrom the amended complaint that Macy Roe had any direct interaction with a member of the \nopposite biological sex in a locker room or restroom; yet, due to the defendants’ policy and \npractice, she opts to hold her bladder, refrains from using the restrooms as much as possible, and \nstresses about whether she can use a restroom without running into members of the opposite sex.  \nId. at ¶ 126.  She is also constantly distracted during the school day due to the aforementioned \nconcerns, and asserts that the policy inhibits her from timely voiding.  Id. at ¶ 127. \n  The  plaintiffs  filed  an  amended  motion  to  proceed  pseudonymously  along  with  the \namended complaint on April 18, 2017.  Doc. No. 9.  The plaintiffs then filed the instant motion \nfor a preliminary injunction on May 17, 2017.  Doc. No. 16.  The court had a telephone \nconference to discuss the amended motion to proceed pseudonymously, the motion to intervene, \nand scheduling for the motion for a preliminary injunction on May 19, 2017.  On May 24, 2017, \nthe court entered an order which, inter alia, (1) granted the motion to intervene without objection \ninsofar as PYC sought to intervene, (2) provided the parties with additional time to submit briefs \non the motion to intervene by Aidan DeStefano insofar as the plaintiffs opposed his motion to \nintervene, (3) granted the amended motion to proceed pseudonymously without objection, (4) \nprovided the parties with deadlines for filing submissions relating to the motion for a preliminary \ninjunction, and (5) directed the parties to immediately commence with discovery related to the \nmotion for a preliminary injunction.

On the \nsame date, PYC and Aidan DeStefano filed a supplemental memorandum in support of Aidan \nDeStefano’s motion to intervene.  Doc. No. 31.  The plaintiffs then filed a brief in opposition to \nAidan DeStefano’s motion to intervene on June 2, 2017.  Doc. No. 32. \n  The defendants and PYC separately filed memoranda of law in opposition to the motion \nfor a preliminary injunction on June 9, 2017.  Doc. Nos. 33, 34.  The plaintiffs then filed a reply \nbrief in support of the motion for a preliminary injunction on June 16, 2017.  Doc. No. 36. \n  On July 13, 2017, the plaintiffs filed a motion to present the testimony of Joel Doe and \nMary Smith in camera during the evidentiary hearing on July 17, 2017.5  Doc. No. 45.  The \nparties then separately filed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law on July 14, 2017.  \nDoc. Nos. 46-48.  PYC filed a response to the plaintiffs’ motion to present testimony in camera \non July 15, 2017.6  Doc.

On \nJuly 31, 2017, the court heard the continued testimony of Dr. Leibowitz (via videoconferencing) \nand  also  heard  live  testimony  from  Dr.  Cooper.    Throughout  the  proceedings,  the  parties \nadditionally provided the court with, inter alia, numerous exhibits, deposition transcripts of all \nfour plaintiffs (including trial depositions of Macy Roe and Jack Jones) and other witnesses \nincluding Dr. Foley, Dr. Cooper, Dr. Faidley, and Dr. Leibowitz. \n                                                 \n5 Although omitted from the main text of the procedural history in this matter, the defendants filed a motion to \ndismiss the amended complaint and supporting memorandum of law on June 16, 2017.  Doc. Nos. 38, 39.  The \nplaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion on June 30, 2017, and the defendants filed a reply brief in \nsupport of their motion on July 7, 2017.  Doc. No. 41, 43. \n6 The court resolved this motion by clearing the courtroom and providing members of the public, including members \nof the press, with the opportunity to hear the testimony (except where necessary to protect the plaintiffs’ anonymity) \nin the undersigned’s chambers as the court’s audio system allows for court proceedings to be heard in chambers. \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 11 of 142\n  The parties separately filed supplemental findings of fact and conclusions of law on \nAugust 10, 2017.

Dr. Cooper meets regularly with the BASH Assistant Principals.  Cooper Dep. at \n24. \n14.  Prior to the 2016-17 school year, BASH students were to use the locker room or \nbathroom aligning with their biological sex.  7-31-17 Tr. at 131; Faidley Dep. at 34, 40. \n15.  BASH students were previously separated on the basis of their biological sex in \npart to protect their personal privacy and safety from members of the opposite sex while using \nbathrooms and locker rooms.  7-31-17 Tr. at 131, 132; Cooper Dep. at 35; Foley Dep. at 23, 24, \n26, 53-54. \n16.  Under this practice, BASH administration would have disciplined and, in fact, \ndisciplined, any students if they entered the opposite biological sex’s bathroom or locker room.  \nFoley Dep. at 24, 25; 7-31-17 Tr. at 112; Cooper Dep. at 31. \n17.  In the 2014-15 school year, a school counselor communicated to Dr. Cooper that \nAidan  DeStefano  (“DeStefano”),  a  tenth  grade  student  and  biological  female  who  was \nidentifying as a male, i.e. a transgender male, was uncomfortable using the girls’ bathrooms at \nBASH.  Cooper Dep. at 75-78; see also Faidley Dep. at 25, 26, 27. \n18.  Dr. Cooper discussed this request, and the possibility of DeStefano using the \nsingle-user facility in the nurse’s office, with Assistant Superintendent Scoboria.  7-31-17 Tr. at \n109. \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 15 of 142\n19.  The School District allowed DeStefano to use a private, single-user facility in the \nnurse’s office for restroom and changing purposes.  Cooper Dep. at 79; Faidley Dep. at 28; \nTranscript of Evidentiary Hr’g on July 17, 2017 (“7-17-17 Tr.”) at 216, 217. \n20.  On May 13, 2016, the United States Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, \nand  the  United  States  Department  of  Education,  Office  for  Civil  Rights,  issued  a  “Dear \nColleague  Letter  on  Transgender  Students”  (the  “May  2016  Dear  Colleague  Letter”).  \nDefendants’ Mem. in Opp. to the Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at Ex. 2, Doc. No. 34-2. \n21.  The May 2016 Dear Colleague Letter stated, inter alia, that Title IX’s prohibition \nof “sex discrimination in educational programs and activities operated by recipients of Federal \nfinancial  assistance  .  .  .  encompasses  discrimination  based  on  a  student’s  gender  identity \nincluding discrimination based on a student’s transgender status.”  May 2016 Dear Colleague \nLetter at 1. \n22.  The May 2016 Dear Colleague Letter indicated, inter alia, that the Department of \nJustice and Department of Education “have determined that this letter is significant guidance.”  \nMay 2016 Dear Colleague Letter at 1 (emphasis in original; footnote omitted). \n23.  The May 2016 Dear Colleague Letter stated, inter alia, as follows: \nThe Departments treat a student’s gender identity as the student’s sex for purposes \nof Title IX and its implementing regulations.  This means that a school must not \ntreat a transgender student differently from the way it treats other students of the \nsame gender identity.  The Departments’ interpretation is consistent with courts’ \nand other agencies’ interpretations of Federal laws prohibiting sex discrimination. \n \nThe Departments interpret Title IX to require that when a student or the student’s \nparent or guardian, as  appropriate, notifies the school administration that the \nstudent will assert a gender identity that differs from previous representations or \nrecords, the school will begin treating the student consistent with the student’s \ngender  identity.    Under  Title  IX,  there  is  no  medical  diagnosis  or  treatment \nrequirement that students must meet as a prerequisite to being treated consistent \nwith their gender identity.  Because transgender students often are unable to \nobtain identification documents that reflect their gender identity (e.g., due to \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 16 of 142\nrestrictions imposed by state or local law in their place of birth or residence), \nrequiring students to produce such identification documents in order to treat them \nconsistent with their gender identity may violate Title IX when doing so has the \npractical effect of limiting or denying students equal access to an educational \nprogram or activity. \n \nA school’s Title IX obligation to ensure nondiscrimination on the basis of sex \nrequires  schools  to  provide  transgender  students  equal  access  to  educational \nprograms and activities even in circumstances in which other students, parents, or \ncommunity members raise objections or concerns.  As is consistently recognized \nin civil rights cases, the desire to accommodate others’ discomfort cannot justify a \npolicy that singles out and disadvantages a particular class of students. \n \nMay 2016 Dear Colleague Letter at 2 (footnotes omitted). \n \n24.  With regard to “Sex-Segregated Activities and Facilities,” the May 2016 Dear \nColleague Letter stated in pertinent part as follows: \nTitle IX’s implementing regulations permit a school to provide sex-segregated \nrestrooms, locker rooms, shower facilities, housing, and athletic teams, as well as \nsingle-sex classes under certain circumstances.  When a school provides sex-\nsegregated  activities  and  facilities,  transgender  students  must  be  allowed  to \nparticipate in such activities and access such facilities consistent with their gender \nidentity. \n \n[] Restrooms and Locker Rooms.  A school may provide separate facilities on \nthe basis of sex, but must allow transgender students access to such facilities \nconsistent with their  gender identity.  A school may  not require transgender \nstudents  to  use  facilities  inconsistent  with  their  gender  identity  or  to  use \nindividual-user facilities when other students are not required to do so.  A school \nmay,  however,  make  individual-user  options  available  to  all  students  who \nvoluntarily seek additional privacy. \n \nMay 2016 Dear Colleague Letter at 3 (footnotes omitted). \n \n25.  The School District’s receipt and awareness of the May 2016 Dear Colleague \nLetter prompted its administration, through consultation with the School District’s solicitor, to \nfirst discuss the use of the locker rooms and bathrooms by transgender students.  Faidley Dep. at \n24, 25; Foley Dep. at 18, 19, 20.9 \n                                                 \n9 Dr. Faidley referred to the May 2016 Dear Colleague Letter as an “Executive Order.” Faidley Dep. at 24, 25. \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 17 of 142\n26.  The School District’s administration, in conjunction with consultation with the \nsolicitor, treated the May 2016 Dear Colleague Letter as the “law of the land” and decided to \nfollow it.  Faidley Dep. at 41; Foley Dep. at 21. \n27.  The School District understood the direction by the Departments of Justice and \nEducation required it to permit transgender students to use the restrooms and locker rooms \naligned with their gender identity.  7-31-17 Tr. at 109; Faidley Dep. at 24-25. \n28.  Based on the May 2016 Dear Colleague Letter and consultation with the School \nDistrict’s solicitor, since the beginning of the 2016-17 school year, the School District has, upon \nrequest, permitted transgender students to use restrooms and locker rooms aligned with their \ngender identity on a case-by-case basis.  7-31-17 Tr. at 108-10; Faidley Dep. at 23, 24, 25, 34, \n83; Cooper Dep. at 84; Plaintiffs’ Ex. P-49, Boyertown Area Sch. Dist. Frequently  Asked \nQuestions About Issues Regarding Doe vs. BASD (“BASD FAQ”). \n29.  The  School  District  employs  a  case-by-case  approach  because  “[t]here  are \ndifferent contexts.  Some students are at the beginning stages, some students are at the stage \nwhere they’re going through surgical procedures. . . . Some students . . . want to use the locker \nroom and restroom facilities of their gender identity.  Some students would prefer to use a \nprivate environment.”  Faidley Dep. at 83-84. \n30.  The  School  District’s  practice  concerning  transgender  students  and  its \nimplementation and the criteria the School District uses in reaching a decision have not been \nreduced to writing.  Faidley Dep. at 24; 7-31-17 Tr. at 138. \n31.  Prior  to  the  2016-17  school  year,  Dr.  Cooper  was  unaware  of  any  BASH \ntransgender student requesting to use a locker room or restroom consistent with their gender \nidentity rather than their biological sex.  7-31-17 Tr. at 108, 109. \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 18 of 142\n32.  At the start of the 2016-17 school year, DeStefano requested to cease using the \nsingle-user facility at the nurse’s office and start using the boys’ multi-user privacy facilities.  \nCooper Dep. at 80. \n33.  Upon  receiving  this  request,  Dr.  Cooper  consulted  with  DeStefano’s  school \ncounselor and Assistant Superintendent Scoboria.  Cooper Dep. at 80, 81.  Additionally, the \nSchool  District’s  administration,  including  Dr.  Faidley,  and  the  School  District’s  solicitor, \ndiscussed the request.  Faidley Dep. at 29, 30, 31. \n34.  After discussions between the School District’s central administration, including \nDr. Faidley and Assistant Superintendent Scoboria, and the solicitor, Assistant Superintendent \nScoboria informed Dr. Cooper that in light of the May 2016 Dear Colleague Letter, BASH \nshould allow students who identify with the opposite sex to use the privacy facilities of the \ngender in which they identify if that makes them more comfortable.  Faidley Dep. at 31; Cooper \nDep. at 107, 108. \n35.  The School District approved DeStefano’s request to use the boys’ multi-user \nprivacy facilities.  Cooper Dep. at 88-89. \n36.  Dr. Cooper communicated the decision allowing  DeStefano to use the boys’ \nprivacy facilities to his administrative team.  Cooper Dep. at 109, 110. \n37.  During the 2016-17 school year, the School District, through Dr. Cooper, granted \npermission to another transgender male (Student A) permission to use the boys’ restrooms and \nlocker rooms, and one transgender female (Student B) to use the girls’ restrooms because those \nfacilities were aligned with their gender identity.  Cooper Dep. at 86-93. \n38.  During the 2016-17 school year, three other transgender male students (Students \nFF, GG, and HH) requested permission and received permission to use different first names \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 19 of 142\naligned with their gender identity, and to be addressed by male pronouns.10  Cooper Dep. at 94-\n103. \n39.  Thus, during the 2016-17 school year, BASH had six students who acknowledged \nidentifying with the opposite biological sex.  Foley Dep. at 21; Cooper Dep. at 86-103. \n40.  Dr. Cooper expects three of the six students to return to BASH for the 2017-18 \nschool year.  7-31-17 Tr. at 111.  The other three students have graduated from BASH.  Id. \n41.  Before the School District grants permission to a transgender student to use the \nrestrooms and/or locker rooms consistent with the student’s gender identity, the student has \ndiscussed the student’s situation and desire with the student’s school guidance counselor, the \ncounselor has discussed this issue with the grade-level assistant principal, and the counselor and \nthe grade-level assistant principal have conferred with Dr. Cooper.  Foley Dep. at 55, 56; School \nDist.’s Interrogs. Resps. at p. 6; 7-31-17 Tr. at 144; Cooper Dep. at 83; Faidley Dep. at 23, 24.  \nThus, the decision to grant a request by a transgender student to use the privacy facilities \nconsistent with the student’s gender identity is “not just a spur of the moment thing,” and is not \n“automatic” upon receiving the request.  Cooper Dep. at 83; 7-31-17 Tr. at 144, 148. \n42.  The School District attempts to make every BASH student, including transgender \nstudents, comfortable.  7-31-17 Tr. at 138, 139; see also Faidley Dep. at 63 (indicating that the \nSchool District’s practice is “that any student, regardless of whether they’re transgender or \ncisgender, would work with the Administration to provide . . . them an area where they could \nfeel comfortable.”  Faidley Dep. at 63. \n                                                 \n10 During his deposition, Dr. Cooper did not recall whether these three students requested to use the locker room or \nrestrooms corresponding to their gender identity.  See Cooper Dep. at 94-103.  During the evidentiary hearing, Dr. \nCooper stated that these students requested to use privacy facilities consistent with their gender identity.  7-31-17 Tr. \nat 109-11.  In the School District defendants’ responses to the plaintiffs’ first set of interrogatories, they did not \nindicate that they gave permission to Students FF, GG, and HH to use the bathrooms and locker room of the gender \nin which they identify.  See Plaintiffs’ Ex. P-41, Objs. and Resps. to Pls.’ First Set of Interrogs. to Defs. (“School \nDist.’s Interrogs. Resps.”) at pp. 5-6.  Based on this additional evidence, the court has not found that Students FF, \nGG, and HH received permission to use the boys’ locker room and bathrooms during the 2016-17 school year. \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 20 of 142\n43.  A student does not need to dress or groom in a particular manner consistent with \nthe stereotypes of a particular sex for the School District to permit that student to use a particular \nprivacy facility.  7-31-17 Tr. at 139; Faidley Dep. at 80, 81.  The student also does not need to \nchange the student’s name, have surgery, or receive hormone treatments.  7-31-17 Tr. at 138, \n139, 140; Cooper Dep. at 115. \n44.  When deciding whether to allow a student identifying with the opposite sex to use \nprivacy facilities consistent with the student’s gender identity, the School District is primarily \nconcerned with what makes the requesting student comfortable.  Cooper Dep. at 114-15. \n45.  None of the School District administrators are able to determine whether a student \nis gender nonconforming or gender dysphoric, and they cannot determine a student’s gender \nidentity.  7-31-17 Tr. at 130.  Instead, they rely on the reporting by the student.  7-31-17 Tr. at \n131. \n46.  To date, the School District has not turned down a request by a transgender \nstudent to use a privacy facility corresponding to the student’s gender identity.  7-31-17 Tr. at \n140. \n47.  The School District did not initially inform parents or students of the decision to \nchange the existing practice and permit transgender students at BASH to use facilities of the \ngender corresponding to their gender identity.  7-31-17 Tr. at 134; Faidley Dep. at 46, 47; Foley \nDep. at 30; Cooper Dep. at 29. \n48.  The School District’s decision to change the existing practice to allow transgender \nstudents, if requested, to go into the locker room or bathroom facility corresponding to their \ngender identity was not made in conjunction with the School Board.  Faidley Dep. at 38, 43, 44. \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 21 of 142\n49.  Prior to changing the practice at the School District with respect to transgender \nstudents’ use of privacy facilities, the School District had not received complaints from students \nabout sharing privacy facilities with persons of the same biological sex who identify with the \nopposite sex.  7-31-17 Tr. at 136; Faidley Dep. at 54; Foley Dep. at 28, 29.  Thus, complaints \nfrom students were not part of the basis for the School District changing its practice.  7-31-17 Tr. \nat 136. \n50.  Dr. Cooper is unaware of any instance where a transgender male student went into \nthe boys’ bathroom or locker room without first obtaining permission from Dr. Cooper.  Cooper \nDep. at 97, 98. \n51.  Students  who  have  not  requested  and  received  permission  from  the  School \nDistrict to use restrooms aligned with their gender identity are not allowed to use the restrooms \nor locker rooms of the opposite biological sex.  7-31-17 Tr. at 112; Foley Dep. at 37.  If a student \nwas to enter an opposite-sex restroom without permission and the administration was able to \nidentify the offending student, the offending student would face consequences for doing so.  7-\n31-17 Tr. at 112, 131, 132.  On five to ten occasions during Dr. Cooper’s tenure, BASH students \nhave wrongfully entered the opposing biological sex’s locker room.  Id. at 112. \n52.  Dr. Cooper is unaware of any BASH student who has requested to use a privacy \nfacility corresponding to the student’s gender identity who was not already using an initial or a \nname that is aligned with the student’s gender identity.  7-31-17 Tr. at 144. \n53.  Dr. Cooper is unaware of any transgender male student who has asked to use the \nboys’ facilities who grooms and dresses like a stereotypical girl; similarly, he is unaware of any \ntransgender female student who has asked to use the girls’ facilities who grooms and dresses like \na stereotypical boy.  7-31-17 Tr. at 144, 145. \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 22 of 142\n54.  Dr. Cooper is unaware of any transgender student at BASH who did not at first \navoid using the facilities corresponding with the student’s biological sex and then used the \nsingle-user facilities, before requesting to use the facilities corresponding with the student’s \ngender identity.  7-31-17 Tr. at 145. \n55.  Simply because a BASH student has requested and obtained a name change to \ncorrespond with the gender identity of the student does not mean that this student is precluded \nfrom using the facility consistent with the student’s biological sex.  7-31-17 Tr. at 142, 143. \n56.  If a BASH student changes for gym (or “physical education”) class, the student is \nexpected to store belongings in a gym locker or in their hall locker (depending on the proximity \nof the student’s hall locker to the gymnasium).  Cooper Dep. at 43.  In general, students are \npermitted to bring their personal belongings into the gymnasium during class, but only if they are \nnot changing for class.  Cooper Dep. at 43. \n57.  BASH students are not assigned lockers in the locker room and, to the extent that \nthe student desires to secure belongings in the locker room, the student must bring in a lock to \nsecure it.  Cooper Dep. at 43. \n58.  BASH has undergone significant renovations over the past one to two years.  \nCooper Dep. at 35-38, 41-42; Faidley Dep. at 18, 19, 21. \n59.  The renovations to the existing locker rooms started in May 2016 and concluded \nat the end of October 2016.  Cooper Dep. at 41-42; Faidley Dep. at 18, 19, 21.  Both locker \nrooms received similar renovations.  Faidley Dep. at 20. \n60.  During the locker room renovation period, BASH students were not required to \ndress for gym class.  Cooper Dep. at 42. \n22 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 23 of 142\n61.  During the renovations, the showers in the locker rooms were changed from \n“gang showers” to single-user showers which have curtains for privacy.  7-31-17 Tr. at 125-26; \nCooper Dep. at 44; Faidley Dep. at 18.  Each locker room now contains four shower stalls.  7-31-\n17 Tr. at 126. \n62.  The School District changed the shower areas of the locker rooms to individual \nshower stalls in part to provide for more privacy for BASH students and to allow the School \nDistrict to allocate space elsewhere as the BASH shower rooms were infrequently used for \nshowering and, as such, space was better used elsewhere.  Cooper Dep. at 44, 45; Faidley Dep. at \n20, 22. \n63.  Very few, if any, BASH students, take showers after gym class.  Faidley Dep. at \n19; June 28, 2017 Dep. of Joel Doe (“Joel Doe Dep.”) at 73; June 28, 2017 Dep. of Mary Smith \n(“Mary Smith Dep.”) at 37-38; 7-17-17 Tr. at 58; June 29, 2017 Dep. of Jack Jones (“Jack Jones \nDep.”) at 35, 47, 142; June 29, 2017 Dep. of Macy Roe (“Macy Roe Dep.”) at 39, 40, 44. \n64.  The renovations included moving the lockers in the locker room to the outside \nwalls and creating a large open space in the common area of the locker rooms.  Cooper Dep. at \n38-39; Pls.’ Exs. P1-P5, P-55; 7-17-17 Tr. at 87-88. \n65.  In addition to the lockers around the perimeter of the common room of the locker \nroom, there is a support wall with a row of approximately 24 lockers the lies in the middle of the \ncommon area of the boys’ locker room.  Pls.’ Exs. P-1, P-2, P-4, P-55. \n66.  The renovations included the addition of several bathrooms – multi-user and \nsingle-user – for both students and staff.  7-31-17 Tr. at 118-22; Defs.’ Exs. D-53, D-54. \n23 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 24 of 142\n67.  All of the multi-user bathrooms at BASH have individual toilet stalls, each with a \nlocking door for privacy.  7-31-17 Tr. at 118-19; Faidley Dep at. 16, 17; Joel Doe Dep. at 114; \nMary Smith Dep. at 47-48. \n68.  There are approximately six to eight multi-user bathrooms for male students at \nBASH, and there is a similar number for female students.  Faidley Dep. at 16. \n69.  The boys’ and girls’ locker rooms at BASH have individual bathroom stalls and \nshower stalls with curtains.  Cooper Dep. at 40; Mary Smith Dep. at 48. \n70.  The individual toilet stalls in the boys’ locker room have doors on them with \nfunctioning locks.  Joel Doe Dep. at 202, 203. \n71.  The multi-user bathrooms are marked with signs using the universal symbols for \nmen and women and/or the words “boys” or “girls.”  Cooper Dep. at 60, 69, 70, 71; see also \nFaidley Dep. at 14-15 (indicating that the BASH bathrooms have signs identifying the sex of the \nstudents permitted to use them). \n72.  Dr. Cooper agreed that toilet stalls, urinal dividers, and shower stalls provide \nsome privacy from persons of the opposite sex.11  7-31-17 Tr. at 132; Cooper Dep. at 123, 124. \n73.  The renovations included placing toilet dividers between urinals and toilet stalls \nin the new facilities.  Cooper Dep. at 39-40.  To the extent that the urinals in the existing boys’ \nrooms did not have dividers, the renovations did not add dividers.  Id. at 45, 46.  For the new \nboys’ multi-user bathrooms, there are individual stalls and the urinals in these bathrooms have \ndividers between them.  Id. at 68, 69. \n                                                 \n11 The plaintiffs’ sought a finding of fact that the School District agreed that these items would “provide some added \npersonal privacy from members of the same sex.”  Plaintiffs’ Supp. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at ¶ \n149 (emphasis added), Doc. No. 57.  The only testimony about those items providing privacy protection from the \nsame sex pertained to toilet stalls.  See 7-31-17 Tr. at 132.  Nonetheless, it is obvious that toilet stalls, urinal \ndividers, and shower stalls would provide some level of privacy from anyone regardless of their sex. \n24 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 25 of 142\n74.  Although  prior  to  the  2016-17  school  year  only  grades  ten  through  twelve \nattended school at BASH, after the renovations, BASH will include ninth through twelfth grades \nin 2017-18.  7-31-17 Tr. at 107. \n75.  For  the  upcoming  2017-18  school  year,  there  are  eight  potential  single-user \nbathrooms available for use by BASH students.  7-31-17 Tr. at 119, 120, 121, 122 & Defs.’ Exs. \nD-53, D-54. \n76.  Approximately three or four of those eight single-user facilities are available \ndepending on the business of the student at the time; for example, there is a single-user bathroom \nat the attendance office that would be available for anyone with business at the attendance office.  \n7-31-17 Tr. at 119, 121, 122 & Defs.’ Ex. D-54. \n77.  For the upcoming 2017-18 school year, there are two locker rooms (one for boys, \none for girls) available for the BASH students’ physical education classes.  7-31-17 Tr. at 122, \n123; Defs.’ Ex. D-54; Cooper Dep. at 39, 40.  Each locker room contains a team room, and a \nstudent could potentially change their clothes in the team rooms without being viewed by other \nstudents.  7-31-17 Tr. at 123.  The team rooms contain lockers for students to potentially store \ntheir belongings.  Id. \n78.  BASH has two additional locker rooms, which also contain team rooms.  7-31-17 \nTr. at 124; Defs.’ Ex.

Although \nsomewhat unclear, it appeared that Dr. Cooper testified during his deposition that the team rooms were unavailable \nto BASH students during the school day.  Cooper Dep. at 72-75.  Regardless, after reviewing the totality of Dr. \nCooper’s testimony and after considering the totality of Dr. Faidley’s deposition testimony, the court finds that the \nSchool District is endeavoring to reasonably accommodate any uncomfortable student at BASH and it appears that \nuncomfortable students will be able to use the team rooms.  7-31-17 Tr. at 125, 141-42.

For  BASH  students  who  do  not  want  to  change  in  a  locker  room  with  a \ntransgender student, the School District is committed to making facilities available for that \nstudent to change outside of the presence of the transgender student.  7-31-17 Tr. at 149. \n87.

On February 22, 2017, the United States Department of Justice, Civil Rights \nDivision, and the United States Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, issued a Dear \nColleague Letter in which they withdrew the guidance provided in (1) a letter from Emily Prince \nto James A. Ferg-Cadima, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy, Office for Civil Rights \nat the Department of Education dated January 7, 2015, and (2) the May 2016 Dear Colleague \nLetter (the “February 2017 Dear Colleague Letter”).

In the February 2017 Dear Colleague Letter, the Departments explained that the \naforementioned guidance documents “do not . . . contain extensive legal analysis or explain how \nthe position is consistent with the express language of Title IX, nor did they undergo any public \nprocess.”  Feb. 22, 2017 Dear Colleague Letter. \n100.  In the February 2017 Dear Colleague Letter, the Departments further explained \nthat \n[t]his  interpretation  has  given  rise  to  significant  litigation  regarding  school \nrestrooms and locker rooms.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit \nconcluded that the term “sex” in the regulations is ambiguous and deferred to \nwhat  the  court  characterized  as  the  “novel”  interpretation  advanced  in  the \nguidance.  By contrast, a federal district court in Texas held that the term “sex” \nunambiguously refers to biological sex and that, in any event, the guidance was \n“legislative and substantive” and thus formal rulemaking should have occurred \nprior to the adoption of any such policy.  In August of 2016, the Texas court \npreliminary  enjoined  enforcement  of  the  interpretation,  and  that  nationwide \ninjunction has not been overturned. \n \nIn addition, the Departments believe that, in this context, there must be due regard \nfor  the  primary  role  of  the  States  and  local  school  districts  in  establishing \neducational policy. \n29 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 30 of 142\n \nFeb. 22, 2017 Dear Colleague Letter. \n \n101.

Dr. Cooper again offered the \nalternative changing arrangements for Joel Doe.21  7-31-17 Tr. at 115. \n142.  John  and  Jane  Doe  later  met  with  Dr.  Faidley  and  Assistant  Superintendent \nScoboria to discuss the locker room issue.  Jane Doe Dep. at 17, 23, 27; John Doe Dep. at 18, 19; \nFaidley Dep. at 85.  During this conversation, Dr. Faidley asked the Does if the administration \nhad offered alternative arrangements for Joel Doe.  Faidley Dep. at 86.  The Does said that the \nadministration had made such an offer, but the Does did not find the offer acceptable.22  Faidley \nDep. at 86.  Dr. Foley indicated that he was not going to remove the transgender student from the \nlocker room.23  Faidley Dep. at 86. \n143.  Joel Doe knew from his parents that he could use a single-user bathroom as an \nalternative arrangement.  7-17-17 Tr. at 119. \n144.  If Joel Doe used a single-user bathroom to change for gym, he acknowledged that \nhe could have used his school locker in the hallway to store his belongings.  7-17-17 Tr. at 119. \n145.  Although Joel Doe continued to participate in gym, a required course at BASH, \nhe did not use the boys’ locker room at BASH to change clothes after October 31, 2016.  7-17-17 \nTr. at 110-11, 112; Joel Doe Dep. at 24.  He stated that he no longer changed in the locker room \nbecause a “girl,” Student A, was in there.  7-17-17 Tr. at 112. \n                                                 \n21 Jane Doe claims that Dr. Cooper did not resolve her continuous concern that Joel Doe did not have a place to store \nhis belongings if he used the alternative arrangements to change for gym class.  Jane Doe Tr. at 22.  She also \ntestified that the gym teacher told Joel Doe that he had to use the locker room to store his belongings.  Jane Doe Tr. \nat 22. \n22 While somewhat unclear, it appears that the Does are claiming that the alternative arrangements were \nunacceptable due to uncertainty as to how Joel Doe would secure his belongings and Joel Doe’s concerns about \nbeing separated from the other boys and that other boys would wonder why he was changing there.  Jane Doe Dep. \nat 24. \n23 Jane and John Doe assert that Dr. Faidley told them that if they were really unhappy, the School District had a \ncyber-school that Joel Doe could use and still attend BCTC.  Jane Doe Dep. at 25-26; John Doe Dep. at 19.  Dr. \nFaidley denied making such a statement to the Does.

Because Joel Doe did not change clothes for gym class as required, he only \nreceived partial credit for the class.24  7-17-17 Tr. at 111. \n147.  Prior to October 31, 2016, Joel Doe used BASH restrooms approximately once \nper day.  7-17-17 Tr. at 112-13.  Subsequent to October 31, 2016, Joel Doe used the bathrooms \napproximately two to three times per week.  7-17-17 Tr. at 113. \n148.  Joel Doe does not feel comfortable use the multi-user boys’ restrooms because \nfemales can use the restrooms.  7-17-17 Tr. at 115. \n149.  Joel Doe acknowledges that he could have used the single-user bathroom in the \nnurse’s office.  7-17-17 Tr. at 113. \n150.  If Joel Doe had to use a bathroom after October 31, 2016, he would generally use \na single-user facility, but if it was an emergency, he would use the boys’ multi-user restroom \nlocated in the “700s” hallway because this bathroom was closest to his last period class.  7-17-17 \nTr. at 113-14, 121, 123; Pls.’ Ex. P-30; Joel Doe Dep. at 18-19.  He usually waited until the last \nperiod to use the bathroom to the extent he was “holding it in all day.” 7-17-17 Tr. at 123-24. \n151.  The 700s hallway multi-user boys’ bathroom contains four urinals and one or two \nbathroom stalls.  Pls.’ Ex. P-30.  If Joel Doe was using one of the stalls, he is tall enough to look \nover the stall’s walls to make eye contact with a student standing at one of the urinals.25  7-17-17 \nTr. at 114. \n152.  Joel Doe indicated that when he uses the boys’ bathrooms at BASH, he feels \nuncomfortable.  7-17-17 Tr. at 115. \n                                                 \n24 Dr. Foley explained that “[e]ven without changing into gym clothes, [Joel] Doe could receive 90% of a day’s \npossible gym grade by participating in class while wearing sneakers.”  Foley Decl. at ¶ 10.  “Similarly, [Joel] Doe \ncould receive 75% of a day’s possible gym grade by participating without changing into gym clothes and not \nwearing sneakers.”  Id. at ¶ 11.  Dr. Foley further indicated that “[s]ince October 31, 2016, [Joel] Doe has sometimes \nchosen not to participate in gym class at all.  However, he received a passing grade overall for the combined health \nand physical education course for the year.”  Id. at ¶ 12. \n25 Joel Doe acknowledged that other boys’ bathrooms at BASH contained higher partitions in the stalls.  7-17-17 Tr. \nat 122. \n38 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 39 of 142\n153.  Joel Doe has  never seen any student that he  would call a “girl” in  a boys’ \nbathroom.  Joel Doe Dep. at 74. \n154.  Joel Doe acknowledges that when he used a single-user bathroom, his privacy \nwas protected.  7-17-17 Tr. at 121-22. \n155.  Joel Doe does not find that the School District allowing him to use a single-user \nfacility is acceptable because he believes that he has the right to use the boys’ bathrooms and \nmaintain his privacy there from individuals of the opposite biological sex.  7-17-17 Tr. at 115. \n156.  Joel Doe was unaware of a biological girl ever using the boys’ locker room other \nthan Student A on October 31, 2016.26  Joel Doe Dep. at 74. \n157.  Joel Doe believes that someone who is born a male is always male and that \nsomeone  who is born a female is always female, regardless of any sex-change surgery or \nhormone replacement surgery.  Joel Doe Dep. at 87-88, 157-58, 168.  He bases his assessment on \nwhether someone is male or female based on how they were born and the reproductive organs \nthat the person has.  Joel Doe Dep. at 158-59, 168, 173, 221-22. \n158.  Joel Doe would be satisfied if only individuals listed as male on their original \nbirth certificates could use the boys’ facilities.  Joel Doe Dep. at 229-30.  He maintains this \nposition and would not object to an individual listed as male on the individual’s birth certificate \nbeing in the locker room or bathroom with him even if this individual had his penis surgically \nremoved and a vagina constructed.  Joel Doe Dep. at 85-88, 220-21, 229-230. \n159.  Joe Doe is unopposed to sharing the boys’ locker room with a student who has \nbreasts and if a transgender girl underwent hormone therapy that caused her to develop breasts, \n                                                 \n26 Dr. Foley indicated that “[a]t some point during the 2016-2017 school year, Student A’s schedule was changed, \nremoving him from the physical education class shared with Joel Doe and Jack Jones.  There is no other known \ntransgender student in that physical education class.” Foley Decl. at ¶ 9.  \n39 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 40 of 142\nhe would not object to the transgender girl using the boys’ locker room.  Joel Doe Dep. at 233, \n234, 235. \n160.  Joel Doe does not recognize a transgender boy as male because the transgender \nboy was born female.  Joel Doe Dep. at 86. \n161.  Joel Doe acknowledges that he cannot tell if someone is biologically a male or if \nthe person is transgender simply by their appearance.  Joel Doe Dep. at 161, 233. \n162.  Joel Doe is unopposed to sharing a bathroom with a transgender female student.  \n7-17-17 Tr. at 116.  Joel Doe is unopposed to sharing a bathroom with a boy who dresses like a \nstereotypical girl.  7-17-17 Tr. at 115.  \n163.  Joel Doe has never filed an internal complaint with the School District pursuant to \nits sexual harassment policy.  Joel Doe Dep. at 41. \n164.  Joel Doe has not seen any doctor, psychologist, psychiatrist, or therapist since \nencountering Student A in the locker room on October 31, 2016.  Joel Doe Dep. at 111. \n165.  Joel Doe has not received any medical care for any anxiety, embarrassment, or \nstress.  Joel Doe Dep. at 197. \n166.  Joel  Doe  claims  that  he  filed  this  lawsuit  because  a  girl  viewed  him  in  his \nunderwear in the boys’ locker room and when he went to the School District administration for \nhelp they told him that he had to tolerate it and make it as natural as possible.27  7-17-17 Tr. at \n85. \n                                                 \n27 There is, at best, an inconsistent record regarding precisely what happened with Student A in the locker room on \nOctober 31, 2016.  The majority of the evidence provided by Joel Doe though his allegations in the amended \ncomplaint, his responses to the defendants’ interrogatories, his deposition testimony, and his evidentiary hearing \ntestimony was simply that he saw Student A in the locker room with him.  See, e.g., Amended Compl. at ¶ 50 \n(alleging that “[Joel Doe] was standing in his underwear about to put his gym clothes on, [when] he suddenly \nrealized there was a member of the opposite sex[, Student A] changing with him in the locker room;” Amended \nCompl. at ¶ 53 (alleging that when Joel Doe went to see Dr. Foley, he “informed Dr. Foley that there was a girl in \nthe [boys’] locker room”); Joel Doe Dep. at 20, 22-24 (describing incident on October 31, 2016 as involving him \nseeing Student A in the locker room); Joel Doe Dep. at 27 (describing when he was getting the group of boys \n40 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 41 of 142\n167.  Joel Doe’s decision about whether he will return to BASH for his senior year \ndepends on how the court resolves the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.  7-17-17 \nTr. at 84-85. \n168.  Joel Doe is requesting that the court issue a preliminary injunction so he can \ncontinue to use the locker rooms and restrooms provided to males.  7-17-17 Tr. at 116. \nC.  Plaintiff Jack Jones and his Parents, John Jones and Jane Jones \n169.  Jack Jones is, as of July 11, 2017, at 17-year-old boy who is going into his senior \nyear of high school for the 2017-18 school year.  July 11, 2017 Trial Dep. of Jack Jones (“Jack \nJones Trial Dep.”) at 4; Jack Jones Dep. at 14. \n170.  Jack Jones was a junior student at BASH for the 2016-17 school year, and he \nintends to complete high school at BASH.  Jack Jones Trial Dep. at 4; Jack Jones Dep. at 14, \n127. \n171.  During the first week of November 2016, Jack Jones was in the boys’ locker room \nat BASH and was changing after gym class.  Jack Jones Trial Dep. at 17, 18, 22; Jack Jones Dep. \nat 16, 23, 135, 155-56.  After being in the locker room for approximately a minute-and-a-half to \ntwo minutes, another student, Student CC, who was standing to his right, tapped him on the \nshoulder and gestured at him to look behind him.  Jack Jones Trial Dep. at 17-18, 28; Jack Jones \nDep. at 16, 17, 20-21, 135-36.  Jack Jones turned and saw Student A, a student who he identified \nas a “girl,” who was wearing a short gray top and short shorts.28  Jack Jones Dep. at 23; Pls.’ Ex. \n                                                                                                                                                             \ntogether to see Dr. Foley because he “wanted to know why there was a girl in the locker room, how she got there”); \n7-17-17 Tr. at 88-89 (indicating that he turned around and saw Student A standing there).  Even in the plaintiffs’ \nproposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, they describe what happened to Joel Doe and not ask the court to \nspecifically find that Student A saw Joel Doe in his underwear.  See Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Findings of Fact and \nConclusions of Law at ¶¶ 26-28. \n  On the other hand, Joel Doe claimed that he filed this lawsuit because Student A saw him in his underwear, \nand the plaintiffs ask the court to enter a conclusion of law that Joel Doe’s experience of being viewed in his \nunderwear by Student A would be highly offensive to a reasonable person. \n28 Jack Jones also indicated that Student A was wearing a sports bra.

Student A was standing to the \nleft of him and staring into Student A’s locker.  Jack Jones Dep. at 21, 22. \n172.  Jack Jones did not know Student A’s name, and Student A was not in his gym \nclass.  Jack Jones Dep. at 17-18, 29. \n173.  At the time that Jack Jones saw Student A, he (Jack Jones) was wearing a shirt \nand he was in his underwear.  Jack Jones Trial Dep. at 18, 22; Jack Jones Dep. at 16, 23, 135. \n174.  Upon seeing Student A, Jack Jones, who was at the middle row of lockers in the \nlocker room, moved two or three feet away to an area of the locker room where he believed he \nwas most hidden from Student A.  Jack Jones Trial Dep. at 18, 19; Jack Jones Dep. at 23, 25, 27-\n28.  Jack Jones then quickly put on his shorts, and then he saw Student A walk past him and out \nof the locker room.  Jack Jones Trial Dep. at 18; Jack Jones Dep. at 23. \n175.  Jack Jones claims that when he saw Student A he was shocked and somewhat \nhumiliated because he quickly moved upon seeing Student A.  Jack Jones Trial Dep. at 19.  Jack \nJones claims that he was also ashamed and embarrassed because he was the one who moved and \nbecause he believes that his privacy was violated.  Jack Jones Trial Dep. at 19-20; Jack Jones \nDep. at 30. \n176.  Jack Jones did not see Student A’s breasts or genitalia.  Jack Jones Dep. at 39. \n177.  As Student A was moving to exit the locker room, Jack Jones overheard a boy \nyell, “if you don’t have a dick, get the fuck out,” and he heard boys laughing.  Jack Jones Trial \nDep. at 20, 30. \n178.  Jack Jones also heard another boy yell, “if you have a dick, raise your hand,” \nwhich caused a bunch of boys to raise their hands.

Jack Jones left the locker room and texted his parents that he saw a “girl” in the \nlocker room and shared with them what he heard the other boys saying in there.  Jack Jones Trial \nDep. at 21-22, 31. \n180.  Prior to this incident, Jack Jones had already shared with his parents that another \nstudent, Student E, who had joined Joel Doe when the group of boys met with Dr. Foley on \nOctober 31, 2016, told him that there was a girl who identifies as a boy in the locker room and \nsome guys went to the office to complain about it.

Jack \nJones Dep. at 135. \n181.  Jack Jones’ initial text to his parents stated: “Someone yelled if you don’t have a \nd***, get the f*** out lol.” Jack Jones Trial Dep. at 31; Intervenor’s Ex.

Jack Jones’s father, John Jones, responded to his son’s text by saying, “Wow.”  \nJack Jones Trial Dep. at 32, 33; Intervenor’s Ex. 1; John Jones Dep. at 10. \n184.  In the same text message conversation, Jack Jones told his parents that “[t]he \nwhole thing is screwed up” and “[s]he doesn’t even look like a guy.  She has short purple hair \nbut was in short shorts and had breasts but was probably in [sic] sports bra.”  Jack Jones Trial \nDep. at 33; Intervenor’s Ex. I-1. \n                                                 \n29 With regard to her response, Jane Jones stated that although she did not agree with the way the boys said it, she \n“liked that they were opposing what was going on” and that they “don’t have to accept this.”  Jane Jones Dep. at 15. \n43 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 44 of 142\n185.  Jack Jones did not tell Jane Jones that Student A was looking at him.  Jane Jones \nDep. at 13. \n186.  Jack Jones only saw Student A in the locker room on this one occasion.  Jack \nJones Dep. at 18, 140-41. \n187.  Jack Jones never saw Student A in a boys’ bathroom.  Jack Jones Dep. at 42. \n188.  Although Jack Jones had gym class every day for the first semester of the school \nyear, he did not have gym in the second half because he had health class instead.  Jack Jones \nDep. at 16-17. \n189.  According to Jack Jones, BASH students were required to change their clothes for \ngym class and, if they did not change into appropriate clothes, they would lose points.  Jack \nJones Trial Dep. at 23, 120-21.  Jack Jones believes that if a student does not pass gym, the \nstudent cannot graduate.  Jack Jones Trial Dep. at 23. \n190.  When Jack Jones had gym class after the incident, he continued to use the locker \nroom to change even though he changed his usual route through the locker room so he could \nexplore the entire locker room (including the shower area) to see whether a “girl” was in there \ntoo.  Jack Jones Trial Dep. at 22-23, 29; Jack Jones Dep. at 32-34, 140.  After conducting his \nsurvey of the locker room, Jack Jones would quickly change and exit the locker room.  Jack \nJones Trial Dep. at 23; Jack Jones Dep. at 140. \n191.  Jack Jones did not feel that he was unable to use the boys’ locker room to change \nafter seeing Student A in there on one occasion.  Jack Jones Trial Dep. at 23, 29, 119. \n192.  Jack Jones never used the shower area of the locker room, which he knew had \nindividual stalls and shower curtains, to change, and that was regardless of whether he saw \n44 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 45 of 142\nStudent A or another person he believed was a “girl,” in the locker room with him.  Jack Jones \nDep. at 35, 142. \n193.  Subsequent to seeing Student A in the locker room, Jack Jones still used the boys’ \nbathrooms, but only if he absolutely had to do so.  Jack Jones Trial Dep. at 23.  He tried to hold \nhis bladder as much as possible and he used the restroom approximately once per week.  Jack \nJones Trial Dep. at 23, 24; Jack Jones Dep. at 42-43.  Prior to seeing Student A in the locker \nroom, he used the restrooms approximately once per day.  Jack Jones Trial Dep. at 23, 24; Jack \nJones Dep. at 42. \n194.  When Jack Jones would use the boys’ bathrooms at school after seeing Student A, \nhe would go into the toilet stall and lock the door because he did not want anyone in the \nbathroom to see him.  Jack Jones Dep. at 153-54. \n195.  Jack Jones claims that he was distracted by holding in his bladder all day.  Jack \nJones Trial Dep. at 24.  He did not get sick or need medical attention as a result of not using the \nbathrooms as much as he had previously.  Jack Jones Dep. at 43. \n196.  Jack Jones obtained “good” grades in school (A’s and B’s) during his sophomore \nand junior years at BASH.  Jack Jones Dep. at 14, 130. \n197.  If Jack Jones had a single-user bathroom at BASH available to him, it would \nprotect his privacy, but still would not satisfy his concerns because he believes he should be able \nto go into “the male bathroom and male locker room and have [his] privacy protected from \ngirls.”  Jack Jones Trial Dep. at 25, 43. \n198.  Jack Jones was unaware of the availability of single-user bathrooms, including \none not far from the gym, as being available to students, and he did not ask about potentially \nusing them.  Jack Jones Dep. at 43-44, 45, 119. \n45 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 46 of 142\n199.  Jack Jones is aware that there is a bathroom in the nurse’s office, but he believed \nhe could only use it in an emergency.  Jack Jones Dep. at 44. \n200.  Jack Jones does not shower at BASH and has never seen a boy shower there.  \nJack Jones Dep. at 47. \n201.  Jack Jones acknowledged that he could have changed his clothes in an individual \ntoilet stall, but he never used the toilet stalls to change for gym class.  Jack Jones Trial Dep. at 9; \nJack Jones Dep. at 90.  Jack Jones noted that each stall has a door that can be closed and locked.  \nJack Jones Dep. at 33.  He observed that there are cracks in the door and a person can see above \nand below the door.  Jack Jones Dep. at 33.  He has never observed someone peeking through the \ncracks.  Jack Jones Dep. at 33-34. \n202.  Jack  Jones  has  not  viewed  other  boys’  private  areas  in  the  locker  room  or \nbathroom other when he saw boys’ buttocks when the boys were “mooning” other boys.  Jack \nJones Trial Dep. at 9-10; Jack Jones Dep. at 87, 88, 89, 154. \n203.  Jack Jones is unopposed to sharing a locker room with a homosexual boy or a \nbiological boy who dresses like a stereotypical girl.  Jack Jones Trial Dep. at 25-26, 47. \n204.  Through this litigation, Jack Jones wants policies put in place so that he can go \ninto the male locker room and bathroom and not get viewed by members of the opposite sex.  \nJack Jones Trial Dep. at 26. \n205.  Jack Jones defines a male as someone having internal and external reproductive \nsystems  that  are  consistent  with  males.    Jack  Jones  Trial  Dep.  at  35-36.    At  bottom,  the \nindividual must be designated as male at birth and it does matter if that individual has different \nanatomy than he has.  Jack Jones Trial Dep. at 36, 40. \n46 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 47 of 142\n206.  Jack Jones  acknowledges  that  he  could  not  determine  whether  someone  was \ndesignated as male at birth simply by the person’s appearance now.  Jack Jones Trial Dep. at 40-\n42; Jack Jones Dep. at 85, 144-45. \n207.  Jack Jones acknowledged that there could be situations in which a transgender \nmale student uses a restroom or locker room, but he would not know it because he would have \nno way to verify the person’s biological sex.  Jack Jones Dep. at 79-80. \n208.  Jack Jones is unopposed to a transgender girl, even if the transgender girl had \nmodifications to look more like a stereotypical girl, using the boys’ locker room.  Jack Jones \nTrial Dep. at 45. \n209.  Jack Jones is unopposed to students with penises using the girls’ locker room if \nthose students were designated as females at birth; similarly, if a transgender boy had surgery to \nconstruct a penis, Jack Jones believes that transgender boy should use the girls’ locker room.  \nJack Jones Trial Dep. at 36-37, 39-40, 45-46, 50. \n210.  When Jack Jones changes in the locker room, he did so in a more secluded part of \nthe locker room because he did not want the other boys in the locker room to see him undressed.  \nJack Jones Trial Dep. at 56. \n211.  Jack Jones considers transgender males to be of the opposite sex from him.  Jack \nJones Dep. at 58-59. \n212.  Jane Jones discussed her concerns about the School District’s practice and Jack \nJones having been in the locker room with Student A with Dr. Cooper.  Jane Jones Dep. at 19-21, \n23-24.  During this conversation, Jane Jones did not ask Dr. Cooper whether there were available \nalternatives for Jack Jones to use when changing for gym.

John and Jane Jones have no objection to Jack Jones sharing a locker room with \nstudents who have different anatomy from him, as long as the students were designated as male \nat birth.  John Jones Dep. at 19, 20-21; Jane Jones Dep. at 33-34.  This would include Jack \nJones’s possible exposure to breasts or a vagina, as long as the person with the breasts and/or \nvagina is a male.  John Jones Dep. at 19, 20. \n214.  Jane Jones would not oppose Jack Jones sharing the boys’ locker room with a \ntransgender girl with breasts and a vagina, as long as the transgender girl was assigned male at \nbirth.  Jane Jones Dep. at 15-16, 33. \n215.  To  Jane  Jones,  allowing  Jack  Jones  to  use  a  single-user  facility  would  not \nalleviate her privacy concerns for him because she believes he has “the right to go to the \nbathroom in the bathroom and locker room he chooses with people of the same sex.”  Jane Jones \nDep. at 40. \n216.  John Jones acknowledges that Jack Jones’s ability to use a single-user restroom at \nBASH would protect his privacy, but he believes that Jack Jones should have privacy when he is \nusing a multi-user bathroom.  John Jones Dep. at 22, 23. \n217.  John Jones would not oppose his daughter sharing the girls’ locker room with a \ntransgender boy who has a penis, as long as the student was assigned female at birth.  John Jones \nDep. at 20-21. \n218.  Jack Jones acknowledges that he could have changed his clothes in the locker \nroom by using a shower stall with the curtain drawn or a bathroom stall with the door closed, but \nthis would not have satisfied his privacy concerns because he would still have to walk through \nthe common area to get to these locations and he might have to walk past members of the \nopposite biological sex while doing so.

So even if the “girl” did not see him undress, he might still see her undressing when he does \nnot want to do so.  Jack Jones Dep. at 152. \n219.  Jack Jones has not filed a complaint pursuant to the School District’s unlawful \nharassment policy.  Jack Jones Trial Dep. at 51, 52. \n220.  Jack  Jones has  never discussed any concerns  about transgender students and \nissues associated with transgender students’ use of locker rooms or bathrooms with any of the \nindividual defendants.  Jack Jones Dep. at 62-63. \n221.  Jack Jones is unaware of any student who pretended to be transgender simply to \nget access to a locker room or bathroom, and is unaware of any student acting as a Peeping Tom \nin a locker room or restroom.  Jack Jones Dep. at 86, 95-96. \n222.  Despite being uncomfortable in the locker room, Jack Jones has not visited a \ncounselor, doctor, psychologist, or psychiatrist, to seek medical attention or get treatment.  Jack \nJones Dep. at 41-42, 124, 125. \n223.  Other than the one incident with Student A in the locker room, Jack Jones is \nunaware of any fights or disturbances resulting from the School District’s practice concerning \ntransgender students.  Jack Jones Dep. at 96-97. \n224.  As far as Jack Jones is aware, the other boys in his gym class continued to use the \nlocker room as they normally did after the first week of November 2016.  Jack Jones Dep. at \n158.  Jack Jones does not know of any other boy that avoided using the boys’ restroom because \nof the possibility that a transgender student might be in there.  Jack Jones Dep. at 158. \n225.  Jack Jones admitted that some beachwear is more revealing than underwear, but \nthat has not stopped him from going to beaches or pools.

Jack  Jones  claims  that  he  is  suffering  irreparable  harm  insofar  as  “it’s \nembarrassing to be the guy who has to go and say that there was a girl in the locker room.  Most \nof the guys try to play it off like, oh, I don’t care.  Like that’s cool.  But to be the guy who has to \nstand up and say that’s wrong.”  Jack Jones Dep. at 125, 129. \nD.  Plaintiff Mary Smith \n227.  Mary Smith, as of July 17, 2017, is an 18-year-old female who is going into her \nsenior year of high school for the 2017-18 school year.  7-17-17 Tr. at 31, 32; Mary Smith Dep. \nat 14, 15, 16. \n228.  Mary Smith was a junior student at BASH for the 2016-17 school year.  7-17-17 \nTr. at 31, 32; Mary Smith Dep. at 14, 15. \n229.  It is unclear whether Mary Smith is returning to BASH for her senior year.30 \n230.  As  part  of  her  participation  in  a  fall  sport  at  BASH,  Mary  Smith  would \noccasionally change into her uniform using the multi-user girls’ bathroom located near the large \ngroup instruction (“LGI”) room in the 700s hallway (the “700s Bathroom”).  7-17-17 Tr. at 35, \n37, 38, 39; Pls.’ Ex. P-33, P-34, P-58, P-59; Mary Smith Dep. at 53, 54. \n231.  Other girls at BASH change in the 700s Bathroom, and Mary Smith has been in \nthat bathroom with three to five girls changing for sports at once.  7-17-17 Tr. at 35; Mary Smith \nDep. at 53, 54, 56, 57, 58. \n232.  When Mary Smith changed for her sport, she generally changed in the common \narea and not in one of the stalls.  7-17-17 Tr. at 41.  If she was menstruating, she would change \n                                                 \n30 The plaintiffs have provided conflicting evidence as to Mary Smith’s intentions for the 2017-18 school year.  At \nher deposition, Mary Smith testified that she would be attending a Pennsylvania Virtual Charter School for her \nsenior year.  Mary Smith Dep. at 126, 127.  During the evidentiary hearing on July 17, 2017, she testified that she \nhad not decided whether she was returning to BASH and would base her decision on the outcome of the motion for a \npreliminary injunction.  7-17-17 Tr. at 32.  In the amended complaint, the plaintiffs allege that because of the School \nDistrict’s practice, Mary Smith will not return to BASH for her senior year.  Amended Compl. at ¶ 117.  In her \nresponses to the defendants’ first set of interrogatories, Mary Smith indicated that she had not decided what she was \ndoing yet.  Pls.’ Ex. P-47, Pl. Mary Smith’s Resp. to Defs.’ First Set of Interrogs. at 2. \n50 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 51 of 142\nin one of the five toilet stalls for privacy.  Id.  She generally would not change in the stalls \nbecause she thought they were “tiny” and “disgusting.”31  Id. at 41, 42.  When she changed, \nMary Smith would generally take off her top and put on a sports bra because she usually was not \nwearing one during the day.  Id. at 39.  If she was menstruating, Mary Smith would change her \nunderwear and put on a skirt.  Id. \n233.  While changing in the 700s Bathroom, Mary Smith has observed other girls in \ntheir bras and has observed girls’ bare chests and their bare buttocks.  7-17-17 Tr. at 39, 40. \n234.  On March 22, 2017, Mary Smith went to use the 700s Bathroom and, as she was \nin the entryway, she looked in the mirror and saw the reflection of a then-unknown male student, \nStudent B, washing hands at the sink.32  7-17-17 Tr. at 43, 44; Mary Smith Dep. at 17, 18, 19; \nPls.’ Ex. P-62.  At this time, both Mary Smith and Student B were fully clothed.  7-17-17 Tr. at \n64, 65; Mary Smith Dep. at 77-78.  Mary Smith does not recall what Student B was wearing, and \nshe did not observe Student B doing anything other than washing hands.  Mary Smith Dep. at 24, \n25. \n235.  Prior to March 22, 2017, Mary Smith had not observed any biological male \nstudents in the girls’ bathrooms.  7-17-17 Tr. at 43, 64, 65. \n236.  Mary Smith does not recall whether she and Student B saw each other.  Mary \nSmith Dep. at 105. \n                                                 \n31 During her deposition, Mary Smith testified that she knew of no reason why students could not go into the \nindividual toilet stalls to change instead of changing in the common area.  Mary Smith Dep. at 58. \n32 During her evidentiary hearing testimony, Mary Smith stated that she was in the entryway when she saw this \nstudent, but during her deposition she testified that she had entered the common area of the bathroom.  7-17-17 Tr. \nat 43, 44; Mary Smith Dep. at 18.  Also, although Mary Smith was unable to identify the student, it appears that the \nSchool District investigated the incident (which appears to have included a review of video from cameras) and later \nidentified this student as Student B.  Pls.’ Ex. P-62.  Student B is the same individual referenced as Student M \nduring Mary Smith’s deposition.  The video also confirmed that Mary Smith hurriedly exited the bathroom and went \nthe LGI room.  Pls.’ Ex. P-62. \n51 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 52 of 142\n237.  Upon seeing Student B in the bathroom, Mary Smith immediately ran away and \nwent to the LGI room.  7-17-17 Tr. at 44; Mary Smith Dep. at 19, 20; Pls.’ Ex. P-62.  She then \ntold the LGI “administrat[or]” or aide that she saw a male in the bathroom and, shortly thereafter, \nthis individual escorted her to the office.  7-17-17 Tr. at 44, 45; Mary Smith Dep. at 20; Pls.’ Ex. \nP-62. \n238.  While  Mary  Smith  was  telling  the  LGI  instructor  about  the  person  in  the \nbathroom, another male student came into the LGI room and stated that he saw a male leaving \nthe girls’ bathroom, which confirmed the story for the LGI instructor.  7-17-17 Tr. at 45. \n239.  While at the office, Mary Smith spoke to an individual at the front desk, who told \nher that Dr. Foley was in a meeting but would get back to her.  Mary Smith Dep. at 21. \n240.  Mary  Smith  reported  the  incident  in  the  bathroom  and  the  School  District \ninvestigated it.  7-17-17 Tr. at 47, 48; Pls.’ Ex. P-62. \n241.  Mary Smith believes that Student B is a boy because she had gone to school with \nStudent B for two years, although she acknowledges that she does not know if Student B is \nactually a biological boy.  Mary Smith Dep. at 23. \n242.  As a result of seeing Student B in the bathroom, Mary Smith indicated that she \nwas  humiliated  and  embarrassed  and,  since  then,  she  has  been  uncomfortable  using  the \nbathrooms at BASH.  Mary Smith Dep. at 132. \n243.  On March 23, 2017, Mary Smith met with Dr. Foley and told him what happened \nto her the previous day in the 700s Bathroom.33  7-17-17 Tr. at 48, 49, 59; Mary Smith Dep. at \n16, 17, 28. \n                                                 \n33 During Mary Smith’s deposition, defense counsel (without being corrected by Mary Smith) referred to March \n23rd and March 24th as the date Mary Smith spoke to Dr. Foley.  See Mary Smith Dep. at 16, 27.  As the more \npersuasive evidence shows that this conversation occurred on March 23, 2017, the court has used this date as the \ndate of the meeting.  In addition, the court notes that defense counsel (again without being corrected by Mary Smith) \n52 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 53 of 142\n244.  Dr. Foley told Mary Smith that the School District had a “policy at BASH that \nanyone who identifies as the opposite sex are allowed to use the bathrooms that they identify \nwith.”  7-17-17 Tr. at 49; see also Mary Smith Dep. at 16. \n245.  This  was  the  first  time  that  Mary  Smith  heard  that  the  School  District  was \npermitting members of the opposite biological sex, or boys who identify as girls, to use the girls’ \nbathrooms and locker rooms at BASH.  7-17-17 Tr. at 59; Mary Smith Dep. at 16. \n246.  When Mary Smith informed Dr. Foley that she had never heard about this and \nasked whether the school had told parents about it, Dr. Foley stated that they had not, but \nbelieved that the school was in the process of communicating it to the public.  7-17-17 Tr. at 49; \nMary Smith Dep. at 16, 29, 30. \n247.  Mary Smith indicated that Dr. Foley did not mention the option of her using \nrestrooms or locker  rooms outside of the presence of male students, such as a single-user \nrestroom in the nurse’s office.  7-17-17 Tr. at 49. \n248.  Dr. Foley did not follow-up with Mary Smith after this conversation.  7-17-17 Tr. \nat 49. \n249.  Mary Smith has never discussed the general issue of transgender students using \nthe facilities corresponding to their gender identity with Dr. Faidley or Dr. Cooper.  Mary Smith \nDep. at 74, 75. \n250.  Other than on March 22, 2017, Mary Smith is unaware of any other instance when \nshe was in a bathroom with a boy identifying as a girl.  7-17-17 Tr. at 49, 50; Mary Smith Dep. \nat 30. \n                                                                                                                                                             \nalso referred to March 21, 2017, as the date of the incident in the 700s Bathroom.  See, e.g., Mary Smith Dep. at 76.  \nSince it appears that the more persuasive evidence shows that this incident occurred on March 22, 2017, the court \nhas used this date as the date Mary Smith saw Student B in the bathroom.  See Pl. Mary Smith’s Response to Defs.’ \nFirst Set of Interrog. at 2.  Either way, the precise date of this meeting is of limited relevance in addressing the \nmerits of the instant motion. \n53 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 54 of 142\n251.  Mary Smith does not oppose homosexuals using the bathroom or locker room \nwith her.  7-17-17 Tr. at 60; Mary Smith Dep. at 43. \n252.  Mary Smith is familiar with DeStefano and would not have opposed DeStefano, a \ntransgender male, from using the girls’ locker rooms or bathrooms.  7-17-17 Tr. at 60. \n253.  Mary Smith is opposed to having boys who identify as girls in the bathroom with \nher because it makes her feel uncomfortable.  7-17-17 Tr. at 50. \n254.  Prior  to  March  22,  2017,  Mary  Smith  would  use  the  BASH  bathrooms \napproximately three or four times per day.  7-17-17 Tr. at 50; Mary Smith Dep. at 106, 107.  \nAfter March 22, 2017, Mary Smith’s bathroom usage “significantly declined” and she avoided \nusing the main bathrooms.  7-17-17 Tr. at 50.  She would use the bathrooms two to four times \nper week.  Id. at 50, 51; Mary Smith Dep. at 108.  Mary Smith changed her bathroom usage \nbecause she felt that she needed to protect herself more.  Id. at 51. \n255.  If Mary Smith used the bathroom, she would use a two-stall girls’ bathroom near \nthe nurse’s office.  7-17-17 Tr. at 73, 74. \n256.  During the second half of the 2016-17 school year, Mary Smith had gym class \nand would use the gym locker room to change every day.  7-17-17 Tr. at 51; Mary Smith Dep. at \n39, 40. \n257.  When Mary Smith changed for gym class, there were approximately 30-40 girls \nin the locker room with her.  7-17-17 Tr. at 55.  Typically, she would change for gym by \nremoving her school clothes and putting on shorts and a t-shirt.  Mary Smith Dep. at 42.  This \ncould have included changing her shirt, bra, pants, or underwear if she needed to do so.  7-17-17 \nTr. at 56; Mary Smith Dep. at 42. \n54 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 55 of 142\n258.  On about three occasions, Mary Smith claims that she was completely undressed \nwhile in the locker room.  Mary Smith Dep. at 40, 41. \n259.  While in the locker room, Mary Smith would see other girls changing and would \nsee their bare buttocks and bare chests.  7-17-17 Tr. at 56, 57.  She has also viewed about five \nother girls’ genitalia in the locker room.  Mary Smith Dep. at 141, 142.  Mary Smith stated that \nshe had not observed any other girls’ genitalia in the girls’ bathrooms.  Id. at 140. \n260.  Although the locker room had three bathroom stalls, Mary Smith did not change \nin there because of the “tight fit,” there were girls constantly going in and out of the stalls, and \nthe stalls were “disgusting.”  7-17-17 Tr. at 51; Pls.’ Ex. P-56. \n261.  Mary Smith has never seen a girl using the showers in the girls’ locker room, and \nshe has never showered after gym class.  7-17-17 Tr. at 58; Mary Smith Dep. at 37-38. \n262.  Mary  Smith  has  used  a  shower  stall  to  change  her  clothes  when  she  was \nmenstruating because it allowed her more privacy to change her menstruation-related products.  \n7-17-17 Tr. at 58.  Nonetheless, she has been in the shower stall when other girls have opened \nthe curtain to see if the shower stall was occupied.  Id. \n263.  Even  if  the  School  District  offered  Mary  Smith  the  use  of  the  single-user \nbathrooms  at  BASH,  this  would  not  resolve  her  privacy  concerns  because  she  “should  be \nallowed to use any bathroom that has the sign that a female can, a girl.”34  7-17-17 Tr. at 61.  She \nbelieves that she “shouldn’t have to go to different bathrooms.  [She] should be able to use the \nones . . . that say girls and know that there are only girls in there.” Id. \n                                                 \n34 Mary Smith provided conflicting testimony as to whether she knew about the single-user bathrooms at BASH \nbeing available to her.  Compare 7-17-17 Tr. at 60 (stating that she was unaware that there were single-user \nbathrooms available at BASH during the 2016-17 school year), with Mary Smith Dep. at 46 (stating that she was \naware of the single-user bathrooms and she believed she could use those bathrooms).  In addition, Mary Smith stated \nduring her deposition that she understood that the School District would allow her to use the private bathrooms at \nBASH because of her privacy concerns.

During the 2016-17 school year, Mary Smith used the single-user bathroom at the \nnurse’s office to relieve herself and obtain items to assist with her menstruation issues.  7-17-17 \nTr. at 71; Mary Smith Dep. at 111.  When she used the nurse’s office bathroom to change \nmenstruation-related products, the door was thick enough that she believed that others could not \nhear what she was doing in the room.  7-17-17 Tr. at 73. \n265.  Mary Smith does not believe that the stalls in the multi-user bathrooms provide \nher with her desired privacy because (1) they only provide protection from the same sex, (2) she \nhas to take care of her menstruation issues by opening pads or tampons so people could hear her \nopening those items, (3) her underwear and pants are on the floor when she is changing (which \ncould especially be an issue during a menstruation cycle), and (4) there are gaps in the sides of \nthe stalls where you can make eye contact with other people.  7-17-17 Tr. at 61, 72. \n266.  Mary Smith wants the court to allow only girls, or individuals of the same sex as \nher, to be in the bathrooms and locker rooms.  7-17-17 Tr. at 62, 67.  She defines someone as \nhaving the same sex as her based on “[w]hether they were born male or female, if they have a \nvagina or a penis, [and] if they are able to reproduce as a female.” Id. at 67, 68. \n267.  Mary Smith is opposed to a biological boy, who gets hormone therapy and/or \nsurgery on the genitalia to look more like a girl, from using the girls’ room.  Mary Smith Dep. at \n65-66.   \n268.  Mary Smith does not know whether she has seen a transgender girl in the locker \nroom.  7-17-17 Tr. at 65; Mary Smith Dep. at 31. \n269.  Mary Smith is opposed to transgender girls using the bathrooms.  Mary Smith \nDep. at 64. \n56 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 57 of 142\n270.  Mary Smith could not identify someone as transgender simply by the persons’ \nappearance.  7-17-17 Tr. at 76. \n271.  Mary Smith’s grades at BASH have been “good,” and they remained about the \nsame this past year as they had over time.  Mary Smith Dep. at 73. \n272.  Since  March  21,  2017,  Mary  Smith  has  not  been  treated  by  any  doctors, \npsychiatrists, guidance counselors, or psychologists.  Mary Smith Dep. at 73, 74.  She has not \nreceived  any  treatment  from  a  healthcare  professional  relating  to  the  embarrassment  and \nhumiliation she suffered on March 22, 2017.  Id. at 104-05. \n273.  Mary Smith could not identify any student who pretends to be transgender so they \ncan use the other sex’s bathrooms or act as a Peeping Tom.  Mary Smith Dep. at 80. \n274.  Other than her experience in the bathroom on March 22, 2017, Mary Smith could \nnot identify any threat, disturbance, or other disruption of school activities caused by transgender \nstudents using bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond to their gender identity.  Mary Smith \nDep. at 87, 88. \n275.  Mary Smith would like the court in this case to “accommodate everyone,” but she \ndoes not know how that can be achieved.  Mary Smith Dep. at 45-46. \n276.  Mary Smith seeks to have the court prohibit a transgender girl from the girls’ \nbathroom regardless of what is indicated on the student’s birth certificate, how the teachers and \nother students treat the person, and how the person is dressed.  Mary Smith Dep. at 65-66.  She \nwants the court to “allow only girls to be in the bathrooms and the locker rooms.”  7-17-17 Tr. at \n62. \n277.

Macy Roe Dep. at 10. \n280.  While at BASH, Macy Roe obtained A’s and B’s for her grades, had a 3.9 grade \npoint average upon graduation, and was ranked in the top 100 students in her class year.  Macy \nRoe Trial Dep. at 5, 6; Macy Roe Dep. at 59. \n281.  Macy Roe “enjoyed” attending school at BASH until learning from Jack Jones \nthat he was in his underwear when he saw a girl getting dressed in the boys’ locker room.  Macy \nRoe Trial Dep. at 9, 20; Macy Roe Dep. at 59. \n282.  Once she heard this from Jack Jones, she stopped using the girls’ bathrooms as \nmuch as possible.  Macy Roe Trial Dep. at 10.  She did not completely stop using the bathrooms; \ninstead, she would use them perhaps once a day when she previously used them two or three \ntimes per day.  Macy Roe Trial Dep. at 10; Macy Roe Dep. at 144. \n283.  Macy Roe would use the bathroom to relieve herself and tend to her period.  \nMacy Roe Trial Dep. at 11. \n284.  Macy Roe indicated that she felt that it was “terrifying that a boy could walk in” \nduring a time that she was opening a pad or a tampon.  Macy Roe Trial Dep. at 11.  She was \nparticularly concerned because she was aware of a boy who started to wear stereotypical girls’ \nclothing and asked for a name change.  Id. at 10.  She was afraid that this student would come \ninto the bathroom when she was in there.  Id. \n58 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 59 of 142\n285.  No matter when she would use the bathroom, Macy Roe would go into one of the \ntoilet stalls and lock the door because she would be uncomfortable using the toilet in front of \nanyone, boys or girls.  Macy Roe Dep. at 139, 140. \n286.  If she had to use the bathroom during the day, Macy Roe would have been less \nanxious to use the bathroom in the nurse’s office or somewhere else private.  Macy Roe Dep. at \n145. \n287.  Macy Roe had observed girls changing their shirts (so they would show their \nbras) or their pants (so they would show their underwear) in the girls’ multi-user bathrooms.  \nMacy Roe Trial Dep. at 12; Macy Roe Dep. at 49, 50, 51.  During times when Macy Roe \nobserved students changing, she did not observe anyone’s intimate parts, just their underwear.  \nMacy Roe Dep. at 51. \n288.  Macy Roe has never changed in the common area of the girls’ bathrooms.  Macy \nRoe Dep. at 51. \n289.  Although Macy Roe changed for gym during the first month the locker room was \nreopened, she stopped doing so for a reason unrelated to the litigation.  Macy Roe Trial Dep. at \n13, 19, 20.  When she changed, she would change the shirt she was wearing to a gym shirt or \nchange her pants to shorts.  Macy Roe Trial Dep. at 14; Macy Roe Dep. at 39.  There could have \nbeen anywhere from 30 to 60 girls in the locker room when Macy Roe changed.  Macy Roe Trial \nDep. at 13.  She observed other girls changing their bras to sport bras or changing their regular \nunderwear to thongs if the girls wanted to wear leggings.  Id. at 14.  Practically each time that \nMacy Roe changed in the locker room, she would see other students’ chests or genitalia if those \nstudents changed their bras or underwear.  Macy Roe Dep. at 65. \n59 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 60 of 142\n290.  Macy Roe never took a shower after gym and never saw another student taking a \nshower.  Macy Roe Dep. at 39, 40, 44. \n291.  Macy Roe does not know whether any transgender student showers at BASH.  \nMacy Roe Dep. at 44. \n292.  Macy Roe is unaware of ever seeing a transgender student in the girls’ locker \nroom.  Macy Roe Dep. at 20, 39, 49. \n293.  Macy Roe is unaware of a transgender girl using the bathroom while she was in \nthere.  Macy Roe Trial Dep. at 14-15, 18; Macy Roe Dep. at 20, 31. \n294.  Macy Roe cannot tell if someone is male or female, which she believes is based \non their internal and external reproductive systems at birth, simply by looking at the person’s \nappearance.  Macy Roe Trial Dep. at 18; Macy Roe Dep. at 73, 46, 145. \n295.  Macy Roe was unaware of the single-user bathrooms at BASH being available to \nher last year.  Macy Roe Trial Dep. at 15; Macy Roe Dep. at 48.  Macy Roe acknowledged that a \nsingle-user facility would have protected her privacy when using the restroom or changing.  \nMacy Roe Trial Dep. at 19.  Nonetheless, even if the single-user bathrooms had been available to \nher, it would not have resolved her privacy concerns at BASH because she should “be able to use \nthe bathroom of [her] sex without the opposite sex coming in.” Id. at 15, 19; Macy Roe Dep. at \n48 (“I should be able to use the bathroom of my sex without my privacy being violated.”). \n296.  Macy Roe noted that in the open space of the locker room, “there wasn’t a lot of \nprivacy. . . . You could see everyone.”  Macy Roe Trial Dep. at 13. \n297.  Macy Roe was unable to identify any time that her privacy was actually violated \nwhile at BASH.  Macy Roe Dep. at 49, 105, 106. \n60 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 61 of 142\n298.  Macy Roe indicated that the bathroom stalls at BASH would not give her the \nprivacy she needed because she could “still be heard going to the bathroom or attending [her] \nperiod, and there are large gaps in the stalls that [she has] made eye contact through before.” \nMacy Roe Trial Dep. at 15; see also Macy Roe Dep. at 98, 99 (indicating that in the bathroom \nstalls that she used, the gaps are large enough to make eye contact with another student). \n299.  Macy Roe has never seen anyone purposefully try to look through the gaps in the \nstall doors.  Macy Roe Dep. at 105. \n300.  Macy Roe does not object to homosexual students using the girls’ locker rooms, \neven if those students were sexually attracted to her, since they would have the same sex as her.  \nMacy Roe Dep. at 45. \n301.  Macy Roe does not object to sharing a restroom or locker room with a student \nwho has a different anatomy than her if, in her opinion, that student was “born female.”  Macy \nRoe Trial Dep. at 17-18. \n302.  Macy Roe would not object to sharing a locker room with a transgender boy who \nhad surgery to construct a penis.  Macy Roe Trial Dep. at 17-18. \n303.  Macy Roe did not file an internal complaint about the School District’s practice, \nand she did not speak to Dr. Cooper, Dr. Faidley, or Dr. Foley about it.  Macy Roe Dep. at 52, \n53. \n304.  Although she alleges and asserts having suffered anxiety, stress, humiliation, \nembarrassment, apprehension, and distress, Macy Roe has not received any medical attention, \ncounseling, or therapy since learning about the School District’s practice.  Macy Roe Dep. at 60, \n101, 102, 103, 104.  She has also not spoken to her guidance counselor, other administrators, or \nany  teachers  about  transgender  issues  at  BASH  or  about  any  anxiety  or  stress  she  was \n61 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 62 of 142\nexperiencing at the time.  Macy Roe Dep. at. 60, 61, 102.  The stress or anxiety did not affect her \ngrades.  Macy Roe Dep. at 102. \n305.  Macy Roe does not know any student who has pretended to be transgender just to \nuse the locker room or bathroom contrary to their gender at birth or to be a Peeping Tom.  Macy \nRoe Dep. at 63, 64, 71. \n306.  Macy Roe believes that the use of bathrooms and locker rooms by transgender \nstudents disrupted her school activities because she held in her bladder all day until she really \nneeded to use the bathroom.  Macy Roe Dep. at 72.  She did this because she was in fear of \nencountering transgender students (whom she describes as students of the opposite sex).  Macy \nRoe Dep. at 72. \n307.  Macy Roe did not suffer from any bladder infections or other medical conditions \ndue to having to refrain from using the bathrooms until she absolutely had to do so.  Macy Roe \nDep. at 102. \n308.  Macy  Roe  claims  that  she  suffered  and  continues  to  suffer  irreparable  harm \nbecause “every time [she] went to the bathroom [she] had to look around.  And now it’s just \nbecome a habit to have to look around.  And while I’m in the stall it’s uncomfortable because \nyou don’t know who’s in there.”  Macy Roe Dep. at 104. \n309.  Macy Roe is unaware of physical altercations or kids walking out of class because \nof the transgender practice at BASH.  Macy Roe Dep. at 75. \n310.  If Macy Roe entered a public bathroom (outside of school) and noticed someone \nthat looked like a male, she would leave the restroom.  Macy Roe Dep. at 143.  She would base \nthis decision on whether the person was wearing stereotypical male clothing or had facial hair.  \nMacy Roe Dep. at 143. \n62 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 63 of 142\n311.  Macy Roe indicated that swimwear is sometimes more revealing that underwear; \nnonetheless, it does not bother her for men and boys to see her in a swimsuit or bikini at a public \npool or beach.  Macy Roe Dep. at 42. \nF.  Dr. Scott Leibowitz \n312.  Dr. Scott Leibowitz received his undergraduate degree from Cornell University \nand his Doctor of Medicine degree from Sackler School of Medicine.  7-17-17 Tr. at 133; \nIntervenor’s Ex. I-6.  He completed his general adult psychiatry residency training at Albert \nEinstein College of Medicine, stayed for an extra year there to be chief resident, and then moved \nto complete his child and adolescent psychiatry fellowship at Harvard Medical School.  7-17-17 \nTr. at 133; Intervenor’s Ex. I-6. \n313.  During his fellowship at Harvard Medical School, Dr. Leibowitz received training \nfrom a psychologist who was part of the first gender identity multidisciplinary clinic in the \nUnited States.  7-17-17 Tr. at 133-34; 7-31-17 Tr. at 8, 9, 10.  This particular psychologist, along \nwith Dr. Leibowitz, had, at different points in time, received training from the Dutch Clinic in \nthe Netherlands, which is “widely known in the world as the most leading research and clinical \ngender identity program.”  7-17-17 Tr. at 134. \n314.  This first gender identity multidisciplinary clinic in the United States focusing on \nadolescents is about ten years old, and eight of the top ten children’s hospitals as ranked by U.S. \nNews and World Report now have clinics similar to it.  7-31-17 Tr. at 9. \n315.  Dr. Leibowitz is currently licensed to practice medicine in Ohio.35 7-17-17 Tr. at \n185 & Intervenor’s Ex. I-6. \n                                                 \n35 Dr. Leibowitz also believed that he was still licensed to practice medicine in Illinois; yet, he noted that his \n“license expires any day.” 7-17-17 Tr. at 185. \n63 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 64 of 142\n316.  Dr.  Leibowitz  is  currently  the  medical  director  for  the  behavioral  health \ncomponent of the THRIVE gender and sex development program at Nationwide Children’s \nHospital in Columbus, Ohio, which is affiliated with Ohio State University.  7-17-17 Tr. at 134.  \nIn this position, he treats young people with gender identity issues.  Id. at 134-35. \n317.  Since November 2016, approximately 55% of Dr. Leibowitz’s time is spent in \nclinical practice.  7-17-17 Tr. at 187; 7-31-17 Tr. at 28. \n318.  Dr. Leibowitz is also an associate clinical professor at Ohio State.36  7-17-17 Tr. \nat 136. \n319.  Dr. Leibowitz has significant experience devoted to youth with gender issues.  7-\n17-17 Tr. at 135, 136.  This experience includes directly treating approximately 300 youth and, \nthrough  his  indirect  involvement  as  part  of  the  multidisciplinary  team  consisting  of \nendocrinologists, pediatric psychologists, social workers, and adolescent medical physicians, \nhundreds of additional youth.  Id. at 136.  This experience also includes an under-estimation of \nhaving spent a minimum of 4,000 hours over the past almost nine years directly addressing, face-\nto-face, gender identity issues with youth.  7-31-17 Tr. at 29, 30. \n320.  Dr.  Leibowitz  has  authored  numerous  publications  on  the  subject  of  gender \nidentity issues in children and adolescents, with approximately 40%-50% of those publications \nhaving been subject to peer review.  7-17-17 Tr. at 136, 137 & Intervenor’s Ex. I-6. \n321.  Dr.  Leibowitz  is  a  member  of  numerous  professional  associations  including, \namong others (1) the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, in which he serves \nas the co-chairman of the Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Issues Committee, and (2) the \n                                                 \n36 Dr. Leibowitz had other faculty appointments and, since none of those appointments were at institutions that \nprovide clinicians with a tenure-track option, he has not served as a tenured full professor or a tenured associate \nprofessor at those institutions because he was a clinician and not a researcher.  7-17-17 Tr. at 197, 202-03. \n64 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 65 of 142\nWorld Professional Association of Transgender Health (“WPATH”), which serves individuals \nwith gender identity concerns or professionals who treat those concerns.  7-17-17 Tr. at 138. \n322.  The term “transgender” is an “identity term that people use” where individuals \nwhose sex assigned at birth is not congruent with their gender identity.  7-17-17 Tr. at 143.  An \nindividual’s  “gender  identity”  is  “one’s  subjective,  deep-core  conviction  sense  of  self  as  a \nparticular gender.  In most situations, male or female, but maybe [sic] some aspect of both, or in \nbetween.”  Id. at 143.  It is also described as “one’s personal sense of self as a particular gender, \nwhether that be male or female, in most cases, or a combination thereof in select individuals.”  7-\n31-17 Tr. at 5-6. \n323.  Transgender refers to a person’s self-assertion of their identity.  7-31-17 Tr. at 85, \n97. \n324.  Typically, sex is assigned at birth when doctors examine a baby after birth and, \nbased on the presence of a penis or a vagina, assign a sex of male if the baby has a penis or \nfemale if the baby has a vagina.  7-17-17 Tr. at 143. \n325.  Dr. Leibowitz would define “sex” “in a medical sense as being the anatomical and \nphysiological processes that lead to or denote male and female, typically.” 7-31-17 Tr. at 6. \n326.  Dr. Leibowitz would define “gender” as “a broader societal construct that really \nencompasses gender rule, which is [how] society defines what male or female is within a certain \ncultural context[, and] [i]t also encompasses gender identity.” 7-31-17 Tr. at 6. \n327.  There are 1.4 million American adults identifying as transgender, which is 0.6% \nof the adult population.  7-17-17 Tr. at 143-44.  Dr. Leibowitz does not have the precise number, \nbut he believes that it is possible that there are more children who identify as transgender.  Id. at \n144. \n65 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 66 of 142\n328.  A transgender boy is a person who has a lasting, persistent male gender identity \nbut was assigned the sex female at birth.   Intervenor’s Ex. I-13, Expert Decl. of Scott F. \nLeibowitz, M.D. (“Leibowitz Decl.”) at ¶ 5.  A transgender girl is a person who has a lasting, \npersistent female gender identity but was assigned the sex male at birth.  Id. \n329.  “Cisgender” is a term used to refer to someone that is not transgender.  7-17-17 \nTr. at 161. \n330.  According to Dr. Leibowitz, the term “transsexual” is “a term that had previously \nbeen used to indicate individuals who had gone through the complete transition.  So those who \nhave gone through what some call sex reassignment surgery[.]” 7-31-17 Tr. at 81.  Dr. Leibowitz \nfurther explained that “from the term transsexual, the [term] transgender has evolved to indicate \nlargely the larger overwhelming group of people, whether they’ve pursued some degree of \ntransition or not, socially, medically, or surgically, and is more acceptable because people can’t \nafford the surgeries.”  Id. \n331.  Dr. Leibowitz noted that “gender fluid” is not a clinical term, but it “describes \nkind of feeling a certain gender at a certain moment in time, and then switching, and then \nswitching, perhaps, back.” 7-17-17 Tr. at 169.  It is a “temporal relationship with gender.” Id. \n332.  Gender dysphoria is “both a clinical phenomen[on]” and a reference to “clinical \ndistress that one experiences when their birth-assigned sex and their gender identity are at odds \nwith one another, with the stipulation that there are no perceived cultural advantages to the \ngender identity that one experiences.”  7-17-17 Tr. at 144-45.  This distress must last at least six \nmonths.  Id. at 145. \n333.  Gender dysphoria was added to the DSM-V when it was released four years ago.  \n7-17-17 Tr. at 144, 145; 7-31-17 Tr. at 11.  Within the DSM-V, the clinical classification \n66 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 67 of 142\nchanged from “gender identity disorder” to gender dysphoria.  7-17-17 Tr. at 145; 7-31-17 Tr. at \n11.  This change occurred in part because (1) by changing the terminology, it pertained more to \nthe clinical experience and distress experienced by some individuals identifying as transgender, \nand (2) the prior terminology “didn’t accurately capture individuals who experienced gender \ndysphoria, the insistence of being another gender[, and i]t was more capturing kids who were \ngender nonconforming.” 7-17-17 Tr. at 145, 146; 7-31-17 Tr. at 11. \n334.  There is a “variability of time in which it can take . . . to appropriately diagnose \nwhether someone meets the criteria for gender dysphoria,” and this could on occasion, take about \nhalf of a year to determine that a person did not have gender dysphoria and even more time to \ndetermine if the person had gender dysphoria.  7-31-17 Tr. at 52, 53; see also Pls.’ Ex. P-65, July \n7, 2017 Deposition of Scott Leibowitz, M.D. (“Leibowitz Dep.”) at 41-42. \n335.  Dr. Leibowitz indicated that the newer, better “psychometric instruments” he uses \nto diagnose gender dysphoria are in the process of, but have not yet been, scientifically validated \nas “we’re in a field in evolution.”  7-31-17 Tr. at 46. \n336.  Someone who is gender dysphoric may ultimately identify with a non-binary \ngender.  7-31-17 Tr. at 57.  Someone who is “gender non-binary” is “an individual whose gender \ndoes not fall into the dichotomous male/female categories” and “identif[ies] somewhere in the \nmiddle.” 7-17-17 Tr. at 170.  Of those individuals identifying as “gender non-binary” whom Dr. \nLeibowitz has treated, these patients generally do not discuss with him a desire to use a specific \nbathroom.  Id. at 171, 172. \n337.  “Gender nonconforming” is a broader term that refers to a person whose gender \nexpression is different from what is traditionally associated with their sex assigned at birth; for \nexample,  a  girl  may  be  said  to  be  gender  nonconforming  when  she  rejects  the  clothes  or \n67 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 68 of 142\nbehaviors that our society associates with young females, but that does not mean that she will, or \nwill  not,  identify  herself  with  something  other  than  female.    7-31-17  Tr.  at  82.    Gender \nnonconformity is not a diagnosis.  Id. at 84. \n338.  Being transgender is not a medical or psychiatric condition, but many people who \nare transgender experience a clinically significant level of distress because of the incongruence \nbetween their gender identity and their sex assigned at birth.  7-31-17 Tr. at 148.  Also, all \ntransgender people do not have gender dysphoria because the incongruence they experience is \ninsufficient for them to feel distressed in a manner that leads them to seek reassignment of their \ngender or to transition their genders.  7-17-17 Tr. at 147, 148; 7-31-17 Tr. at 96, 97. \n339.  Dr. Leibowitz indicated that the issue of whether transgender is a mental illness or \nmental condition is “a big debate that many scholars have spent hours and papers writing about.”  \n7-31-17 Tr. at 85. \n340.  There are accepted standards in the medical and mental health fields for treating \ngender  dysphoria  in  adolescents,  with  these  standards  being  documented  in  the  Endocrine \nSociety Guidelines and in the WPATH Standards of Care (currently in its seventh edition).  7-17-\n17 Tr. at 150, 151, 198; Intervenor’s Ex. I-19, WPATH Standards of Care.  Dr. Leibowitz \nfollows those standards when treating patients at his clinic.  7-31-17 Tr. at 61-62. \n341.  With regard to the WPATH Standards of Care, both the American Academy of \nChild  and  Adolescents  in  Psychiatry  and  the  American  Psychological  Association  have \nguidelines and practice parameters that cite to and adhere to the WPATH Standards of Care.  7-\n17-17 Tr. at 152.  Many major medical or mental health professional organizations, including the \nAmerican Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, and the American \n68 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 69 of 142\nPsychiatric Association, accept the WPATH Standards of Care as the appropriate protocols.  7-\n31-17 Tr. at 63. \n342.  The WPATH Standards of Care are widely used and accepted in the field by \nclinicians dealing with youth with gender identity issues.  7-17-17 Tr. at 151. \n343.  The  risk  of  not  treating  a  “gender  dysphoric  adolescent  has  significant  and \nsubstantially higher psychiatric outcomes, poor psychiatric outcomes,” which include suicide, \nself-injury, suicidal ideation, and suicidal behavior.  7-17-17 Tr. at 158. \n344.  “Transgender  youth  are  at  [a]  much  higher  risk  for  suicidal  behavior  when \ncompared to youth who are not transgender.”  Leibowitz Decl. at ¶ 25.  “Peer reviewed research \ndemonstrates that as many as 45% of gender dysphoric adolescents have had thoughts of suicide \ncompared to 17% in this age group in 2015.”  Id.; see also 7-31-17 Tr. at 77 (explaining studies). \n345.  “Numerous data from gender clinic referred samples indicate that co-occurring \npsychiatric diagnoses occur in much higher rates in youths with gender dysphoria, such as \ndepression, anxiety, self-injurious behavior, and suicidal ideation.”  Leibowitz Decl. at ¶ 25. \n346.  Dr. Leibowitz acknowledged that “[i]t is impossible to know the rate of suicide \nfor transgender people” in part because it is impossible to know the number of transgender \npeople in the population since “transgender people are largely a hidden population.”  7-31-17 Tr. \nat 45. \n347.  “The goal of treatment in gender dysphoria in adolescents is to help one not \nexperience that internal sense of chaos that they live day-to-day, being and feeling as though they \nwere born with a sex assigned at birth that differs from their core sense of self, that deep \nconviction of who they are.” 7-17-17 Tr. at 159. \n69 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 70 of 142\n348.  It is unethical to treat gender dysphoria by attempting to align an adolescent’s \ngender identity with the adolescent’s sex assigned at birth.  7-17-17 Tr. at 159, 160; 7-31-17 Tr. \nat 78-79 & Intervenor’s Ex. I-19 at p. 16 (“Treatment aimed at trying to change a person’s \ngender identity and expression to become more congruent with sex assigned at birth has been \nattempted in the past without success . . ., particularly in the long term.  Such treatment is no \nlonger considered ethical.” (citations omitted)).  The “consensus among different disciplines \nsuggests that it is harmful to try to change someone’s gender identity, gender expression, and/or \nsexual orientation for that matter.”  7-17-17 Tr. at 160. \n349.  Among  the  accepted  clinical  interventions  to  treat  adolescents  with  gender \ndysphoria include, independently or in combination:  social transition, pubertal suppression, \nhormone therapy, and, in some cases, surgery.  Leibowitz Decl. at ¶ 13; 7-17-17 Tr. at 152-59; 7-\n31-17 Tr. at 46, 47, 48, 65, 66; Intervenor’s Ex. I-19 at pp. 15-16, 18-21.  The WPATH \nStandards of Care require parental consent before beginning hormone therapy or other physical \ninterventions when treating adolescents who are under 18 years of age.  7-31-17 Tr. at 67. \n350.  Adolescents treated with puberty suppressing drugs do not go through puberty of \ntheir assigned sex at birth; as examples, (1) an adolescent who was assigned female at birth will \nnot develop breasts or widening of the hips, and (2) an adolescent who was assigned male at \nbirth will not develop an Adam’s apple, facial hair, chest hair, broadening of the shoulders, \nincrease in muscle mass, squaring of the jaw, or a deepening of the voice.  Leibowitz Decl. at ¶ \n27. \n351.  Hormone therapy – providing testosterone for transgender boys and estrogen for \ntransgender girls – produces secondary sex characteristics that match one’s gender identity.  7-\n17-17 Tr. at 155, 156; Leibowitz Decl. at ¶ 28.  “Transgender females receiving estrogen will \n70 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 71 of 142\ndevelop breasts and the muscle mass and fat distribution typical of females.  Transgender males \nreceiving testosterone will develop facial and body hair, a deeper voice, and muscle mass typical \nof males.”  Leibowitz Decl. at ¶ 28. \n352.  A transgender boy who has been treated with puberty blockers and testosterone \ntreatment could be virtually indistinguishable when clothed from a cisgender boy.  7-17-17 Tr. at \n161, 162; 7-31-17 Tr. at 65, 66, 67; see also Leibowitz Decl. at ¶ 27.  Similarly, a transgender \ngirl  who  has  been  treated  with  puberty  blockers  and  hormone  therapy  could  be  virtually \nindistinguishable  when  clothed  from  a  cisgender  girl.    7-17-17  Tr.  at  161,  162;  see  also \nLeibowitz Decl. at ¶ 27.  Nonetheless, “[a]s a result of the [different types of available] medical \ntreatments  .  .  .  for  gender  dysphoria  in  adolescents,  transgender  adolescent  males  will  not \nnecessarily align physically with cisgender girls, and transgender adolescent females will not \nnecessarily align physically with cisgender males.  Leibowitz Decl. at ¶ 29. \n353.  For  transgender  boys,  another  clinical  intervention  that  may  be  used  in \nadolescents is “top surgery,” i.e. a mastectomy to remove the breast tissue and create a male \nchest.  7-17-17 Tr. at 159. \n354.  Very few persons in any high school have undergone surgery of their reproductive \nanatomy.  7-31-17 Tr. at 86. \n355.  Determining the proper intervention for a particular adolescent is a case-by-case \ndetermination  resulting  from  a  collaborative  process  and  considering  the  advantages  and \ndisadvantages of a particular intervention.  7-31-17 Tr. at 46-47. \n356.  Social transition refers to the process of living in accordance with one’s gender \nidentity, such as where a transgender girl might adopt a name traditionally associated with girls, \nuse feminine pronouns, grow her hair, or change the pitch of her voice.  Leibowitz Decl. at ¶ 14; \n71 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 72 of 142\n7-17-17 Tr. at 153-54.  Social transition could also involve using single-sex facilities, like \nrestrooms or locker rooms, consistent with one’s gender identity.  7-17-17 Tr. at 154, 162; 7-31-\n17 Tr. at 50. \n357.  Social transitioning is in part a diagnostic tool and a remedial tool to determine \nwhether  and  to  what  extent  living  in  the  affirmed  gender  improves  the  psychological  and \nemotional functioning of the individual.  7-31-17 Tr. at 52.  Thus, social transitioning can be \nused to diagnose whether an individual has gender dysphoria.  7-31-17 Tr. at 47, 48, 50, 56. \n358.  Social transitioning can occur in increments, such as where the adolescent starts \nliving in the affirmed gender at home or on vacation.  7-31-17 Tr. at 47.  After the incremental \nsocial transition, Dr. Leibowitz would confer with the patient again to see whether the transition \nhelped alleviate the patient’s distress.  Id. at 48.  In other words, “in certain situations, that type \nof intervention could lead one to feeling better about oneself and more willing and more able to \npursue this further.  And in other situations, it would lead that person to feeling, you know, \nperhaps this is something that I am purely just not ready for.”  Id. \n359.  Dr. Leibowitz explained that when determining whether social transitioning is an \nappropriate treatment for a particular individual, it is not his “role as a clinician to determine a \npreset course for a specific individual.”  7-17-17 Tr. at 154.  He acknowledged that there is \n“limited evidence” on this issue and, as such, “we want to be cautious in how we approach these \nissues.”37  Id.  Thus, he does not dictate when a patient should do something; instead, “there’s a \ncareful risk-benefit analysis that happens step-by-step, and sometimes it even starts with just a \nsimple change in a home environment, in the privacy of their home.”  Id. at 154, 155. \n                                                 \n37 Regarding the “limited evidence,” Dr. Leibowitz explained that although there was limited “level one evidence,” \nsuch as a randomized control study with a placebo, but there is “actually plenty of level two evidence.”  7-31-17 Tr. \nat 54.  Dr. Leibowitz notes that there are “plenty of aspects of emotional health and psychological health,” which do \nnot have level one evidence such as randomized control studies and yet have courses of treatment that are generally \naccepted in the field of psychiatry.  Id. at 67, 68. \n72 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 73 of 142\n360.  With regard to social transition involving using sex-segregated spaces, such as a \nbathroom or locker room, consistent with one’s gender identity, and the significance of it, Dr. \nLeibowitz explained that for “an individual where their gender identity and their sex anatomy are \nincongruent, particularly, of course, those who meet criteria for gender dysphoria, it chips away \nand  it  erodes  at  your  psychological  wellbeing  and  your  wholeness.”    7-17-17  Tr.  at  163.  \nAdditionally, if an adolescent with gender dysphoria is prohibited from using facilities matching \nthe adolescent’s gender identity, “it sends a message to them that what they’re [sic] experience \nis, who they are is not . . . valid.  It’s not an identity that is appreciated.  It is society reducing \nthem to their genital[s].” Id. at 164; see 7-31-17 Tr. at 72 (“[W]hen someone forces or society \nforces an individual to use a restroom based on the sex that they were assigned at birth, operative \nword being ‘forced,’ that can erode their psychological wellbeing and it can reduce them to the \npresence of a genital.”). \n361.  If an adolescent is barred from a sex-segregated facility matching their gender \nidentity the barred adolescent will more frequently refrain from urinating; in addition, “certain \ndata suggests that there are much higher rates of not going to school, leaving school, cutting \nclass, leaving the school to find a bathroom . . . that they feel comfortable using where nobody \nknows them.”  7-17-17 Tr. at 164; see also id. at 177-78; 7-31-17 Tr. at 71, 72; Leibowitz Decl. \nat ¶ 22.  Thus, “educational effect, self-esteem and depression are, perhaps, not a direct effect, \nbut all part of the general gestalt of not being able to use any type of facility that’s consistent \nwith your deep conviction and sense of self as to who you are.” 7-17-17 Tr. at 164-65; see also \nLeibowitz Decl. at ¶ 20 (explaining that forbidding adolescents from using restrooms and other \nsex-segregated facilities consistent with their gender identity “often negatively impacts their self-\n73 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 74 of 142\nesteem and self-worth, ability to trust others, and willingness to go out into the world, during a \ncritical aspect of development”).  Additionally, \nthese youth are hampered in their ability to access opportunities traditionally \nassociated with growing up and maturing into an adult, such as getting a job or \nexploring  educational  enrichment  opportunities.    The  loss  of  these  activities \nduring  an  important  developmental  stage  of  youth  can  have  long  term \nconsequences on an individual’s financial and employment prospects later in life, \nwhich can lead to many other psychiatric concerns. \n \nLeibowitz Decl. at ¶ 22. \n362.  Dr.  Leibowitz  acknowledged  that  he  could  not  state  that  an  adolescent  will \n“automatically” have a particular type of distress if forced to use facilities not aligning with the \nadolescent’s gender identity; yet, he indicated that “it can exacerbate psychiatric illness.  And \nthere is plenty of level two evidence, cohort studies, prospective studies that demonstrate that \nharm.”  7-31-17 Tr. at 72, 73. \n363.  When adolescents with gender dysphoria are able to use the restrooms and locker \nrooms  corresponding  to  their  gender  identity  it  can  have  a  positive  effect  on  their  mental \nwellbeing.  7-31-17 Tr. at 70.  In this regard, the burden of being unable to use the facility \nconsistent with their gender identity is lifted.  Id.  Also, these adolescents “feel this sense of \nrelief, this sense of emotional alignment, [and] this sense of happiness.” Id. at 71; see also \nIntervenor’s  Ex.  I-14,  Decl.  of  Aidan  DeStefano  in  Supp.  of  Mot.  for  Leave  to  Intervene \n(“DeStefano Decl.”) at ¶ 11 (indicating that being able to use the male facilities at BASH “feels \nso good – I am finally ‘one of the guys’, something I have waited for my whole life”); id. at ¶ 12 \n(“Being able to be my true self is more important than I can describe.  I am on track to make the \nHonor Roll for the third marking period in a row, something I have never done before because I \nwas too distracted and stressed.”). \n74 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 75 of 142\n364.  Forcing  transgender  youth  to  use  a  “separate  single-user  restroom  could \nundermine the benefits of their social gender transition by sending the message that they are not \nreally who they identify as.”  Leibowitz Decl. at ¶ 23.  It is also “stigmatizing for the individuals \nrequired to use them by reinforcing a sense of ‘otherness.’”  Id. \n365.  Most of the young people treated by Dr. Leibowitz have chosen to use a single \nstall or single-user restroom or facility.  7-17-17 Tr. at 172.  Dr. Leibowitz indicated that in his \nexperience, transgender youth are choosing to use private facilities rather than group settings \n“because they have not yet beg[u]n to feel comfortable living fully . . . in the gender role of their \ngender  identity.”  7-31-17  Tr.  at  51.    To  the  extent  that  transgender  students  would  feel \nuncomfortable changing in a group setting, such as in a sex-segregated facility, Dr. Leibowitz \nfinds it reasonable that the patient would choose a separate, private facility to be comfortable.  7-\n31-17 Tr. at 58. \n366.  Transgender youth who meet the clinical criteria for gender dysphoria are far \nmore likely to want to conceal their physical anatomy and are typically extremely hypervigilant \nwithin sex-segregated situations.  Leibowitz Decl. at ¶ 21; 7-17-17 Tr. at 180, 181.  Also, “[o]ne \nof the criteria of the diagnostic classification Gender Dysphoria in Adolescence and Adulthood is \na desire to be perceived as another gender and a rejection of aspects of their body that connote \ntheir assigned sex at birth.”  Leibowitz Decl. at ¶ 21. \n367.  Transgender  patients  are  also  particularly  modest  about  exposing  themselves \nwhile using privacy facilities.  7-31-17 Tr. at 58. \n368.  A  number  of  professional  organizations,  which  include,  among  others,  the \nAmerican  Medical  Association,  the  American  Psychological  Association,  the  American \nPsychiatric Association, the National Association for Social Work, and the American Academy \n75 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 76 of 142\nof  Child  and  Adolescent  Psychiatry,  have  taken  the  position  that  individuals  with  gender \ndysphoria should not be forced to use a restroom that is not in accordance with their gender \nidentity.  7-17-17 Tr. at 165; Leibowitz Decl. at ¶ 26. \n369.  As a clinician, Dr. Leibowitz does not decide which bathroom a person should \nuse, or decide a person’s gender; instead, “[i]t’s up to me to determine whether [the person] \nmeet[s] criteria for gender dysphoria.”  7-17-17 Tr. at 171. \n370.  Some of Dr. Leibowitz’s patients have received permission from schools to use \nfacilities consistent with their gender identity and some have not.  7-17-17 Tr. at 166, 167.  Dr. \nLeibowitz  believes  that  the  reason  that  schools  have  not  allowed  students  to  use  facilities \nconsistent with their gender identity is a “lack of education” insofar as “[s]ociety has not caught \nup” with the medical community and he does not “believe that there is a pervasive, prevailing \ncomfort with individuals who differ in terms of their gender identity and their sex anatomy.”  7-\n17-17 Tr. at 168. \n371.  Although Dr. Leibowitz has not conducted or published any 30-year, 10-year, or \n5-year follow-up studies on his patients who went through gender affirmation using his treatment \nmethods, he noted that he is not obligated to conduct research on patients when providing \nclinical care.  7-17-17 Tr. at 197.  Dr. Leibowitz also pointed out that his treatment and therapies \nare Standard of Care recommended therapies.  Id. at 198. \n372.  Dr. Leibowitz believes that transgender students “need to have accommodations \nprovided to them that don’t discriminate against them and exacerbate the very harm that we in \nclinical practice are trying to address.” 7-31-17 Tr. at 91. \n373.  Dr. Leibowitz indicated that there have not been any results from the first-of-its-\nkind (in the United States) study by the United States National Institutes of Health, which was \n76 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 77 of 142\nstudying adolescents and the safety of the medical treatments offered for gender dysphoric \npatients.38  7-31-17 Tr. at 18-19. \n374.  Dr. Leibowitz could not provide statistical information about the probability that \nhis gender dysphoric patients might eventually be harmed by him following the Standards of \nCare when treating them.  7-31-17 Tr. at 32-34.  Dr. Leibowitz indicted that he could not \nquantify the risks of harm, but noted that the WPATH Standards of Care discuss the levels of \npotential risk that one may encounter with certain interventions.  Id. at 33. \n375.  When Dr. Leibowitz is treating a patient, he is only advocating for and medically \ntreating that patient and is not considering the reaction of others to the treatment (unless a \nTarasoff obligation arises).  7-31-17 Tr. at 59-60. \n376.  Dr. Leibowitz believes it would be unethical (because it is unethical to drive \ntoward  affirmation  of  sex)  to  conduct  a  randomized  controlled  study  to  compare  social \nreinforcement through access to sex-segregated facilities versus not allowing access.  Leibowitz \nDep. at 83-84.  In addition, no such study exists.  Id. \n377.  Dr. Leibowitz stated that he was untrained to make school policy decisions about \nhow a school is supposed to know whether an individual is gender nonconforming or gender \ndysphoric.  7-31-17 Tr. at 92. \n378.  In  Dr.  Leibowitz’s  opinion,  society  needs  to  have  private  facilities  “for  all \nindividuals who are uncomfortable with all bodies,” in other words, “schools should provide . . . \na private bathroom for kids, non-transgender or transgender, to use should differing body types \nevoke or elicit discomfort.”39  7-31-17 Tr. at 93, 94. \n                                                 \n38 Dr. Leibowitz noted that there was a European study as well, and results have come in from that study.  7-31-17 \nTr. at 18, 19. \n39 Dr. Leibowitz briefly discussed adolescents’ exposure to different sex nudity, and indicated that anyone can be \nuncomfortable with nudity including, for example, a boy being uncomfortable with another boy’s nudity.  7-17-17 \n77 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 78 of 142\n379.  Dr. Leibowitz acknowledged that the issue before the court was “complex,” and \nthe medical field dealing with gender identity issues is “a field in evolution.”  7-31-17 Tr. at 94. \n380.  Dr. Leibowitz is qualified as an expert in gender dysphoria and gender identity \nissues in children and adolescents and the court accepted him as an expert in those areas.40  7-31-\n17 Tr. at 103.  Dr. Leibowitz’s testimony was reliable and relevant.41 \nG.  Aidan DeStefano \n381.  DeStefano is, as of July 17, 2017, an 18-year-old transgender male who graduated \nfrom BASH after the 2016-17 school year.  7-17-17 Tr. at 211, 212, 213, 237.  DeStefano always \nattended school in the School District.  Id. at 212. \n382.  Despite being designated as female at birth, DeStefano has always identified as \nmale.  7-17-17 Tr. at 213. \n                                                                                                                                                             \nTr. at 178, 179.  In addition, he believes that if a treated transgender boy, with a beard, a deep voice, and a changed \nmusculature was placed into a girls’ locker room and exposed some nudity to the cisgender girls, this could be \ndiscomforting to them too.  Id. at 179.  Since the discomfort could “happen for anybody anywhere,” Dr. Leibowitz \nbelieves that “this is . . . not about a matter of discomfort with the nudity and more about forcing an individual to be \nsomewhere . . . that’s just incongruent with their deep conviction of who they are, and not about giving people the \nchoice should they feel uncomfortable with nudity in general.”  7-17-17 Tr. at 180. \n40 The court overruled the plaintiffs’ objection to the court accepting Dr. Leibowitz as an expert. \n41 Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence requires that (1) an expert witness is qualified, (2) the testimony is \nreliable, and (3) the testimony assist the fact-finder.  Fed. R. Evid. 702.  The court acts as a gatekeeper to determine \nwhether the proffered evidence satisfies Rule 702.  Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993).  As \nillustrated by Dr. Leibowitz’ extensive education and experience in the field dealing with gender dysphoria and \ngender identity issues with youth, he is well qualified to provide expert testimony in this case. \n  Dr. Leibowitz’s testimony is reliable because he follows the WPATH Standards of Care, which are \naccepted treatment protocols and recognized by major medical organizations such as the American Medical \nAssociation and the American Psychological Association.  See De’lonta v. Johnson, 708 F.3d 520, 522-23 (4th Cir. \n2013) (“The Standards of Care, published by [WPATH], are the generally accepted protocols for the treatment of \n[gender identity disorder].”).  Although the plaintiffs objected to Dr. Leibowitz’s testimony because, inter alia, the \nscientific support for the discussed treatment for gender dysphoria was not yet subjected to randomized, controlled \ntrials, the court found Dr. Leibowitz’s testimony that he followed the Standards of Care credible and persuasive as to \nthe reliability of his testimony.  Additionally, Dr. Leibowitz noted an inability due to ethical considerations to \nplacebo-control studies in certain areas.  Despite those types of studies being unavailable, his testimony was still \nreliable.  See, e.g., In re Tylenol (Acetaminophen) Mktg. Sales Practices & Prod. Liab. Litig., 198 F. Supp. 3d 446, \n454-58 (E.D. Pa. 2016).  Dr. Leibowitz appeared to be well-versed on the studies and research that was available \nand spoke extensively about his significant experience dealing with patients. \n  As for the final requirement for admissibility, Dr. Leibowitz’s testimony was relevant to provide \nbackground on gender identity issues and the types of treatments patients may receive for gender dysphoria and \nother gender identity issues. \n78 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 79 of 142\n383.  DeStefano dresses like a male, has a deep voice like a stereotypical male, and \nstyles his hair like a male.42  7-17-17 Tr. at 234 & Intervenor’s Ex. I-4. \n384.  At his recent graduation, DeStefano wore a black gown like the other male BASH \nstudents.  7-17-17 Tr. at 234. \n385.  DeStefano started identifying as male while attending junior high school in the \nSchool District.  7-17-17 Tr. at 213. \n386.  DeStefano attempted to use the girls’ bathroom in seventh grade and the reaction \nthat he received from the girls “wasn’t good.”  7-17-17 Tr. at 213.  The girls told DeStefano \nnever to return to the bathroom because they thought he was a male.  Id. \n387.  From seventh through ninth grade at the junior high school, DeStefano used the \nnurse’s bathroom because that was where he felt he could go.  7-17-17 Tr. at 213-14, 225. \n388.  DeStefano played on the girls’ basketball and track and field teams during junior \nhigh and changed in the girls’ locker room when preparing for games and practices.  7-17-17 Tr. \nat 214, 215. \n389.  When DeStefano started at BASH for tenth grade, he again initially attempted to \nuse the girls’ bathroom just to see what it was like.  7-17-17 Tr. at 216.  The girls’ reaction to \nDeStefano “was beyond what [he] expected.  It was worse.  [He] got yelled at by literally \neveryone that was in there.” Id.  They told him not to come back.  Id.  The girls also “stared at \n[him], because [he] did not look like the girls in that bathroom.”  DeStefano Decl. at ¶ 4. \n390.  Although DeStefano wanted to use the boys’ bathroom, he was concerned for his \nsafety.  7-17-17 Tr. at 216.  After speaking to his counselor, they decided that DeStefano would \nagain use the nurse’s office to use the bathroom.  Id. at 216, 217.  He used the nurse’s bathroom \n                                                 \n42 As the court observed DeStefano testify, the court can confirm that he appears like a stereotypical male. \n79 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 80 of 142\nfor tenth and eleventh grades.  Id. at 218, 219.  That was where he “was the most comfortable.”  \nId. at 219. \n391.  DeStefano  was  “fine”  using  the  nurse’  bathroom  because  he  had  used  it \nthroughout junior high school.  7-17-17 Tr. at 216. \n392.  In 2015, DeStefano started hormone replacement therapy and started testosterone.  \n7-17-17 Tr. at 217. \n393.  In May 2016, DeStefano legally changed his first name to Aidan.  7-17-17 Tr. at \n217. \n394.  In tenth grade at BASH, DeStefano played on the girls’ cross-country and track \nand field teams.  7-17-17 Tr. at 218.  During his senior year at BASH, DeStefano ran as a \nmember of the boys’ cross-country team.  Id. at 218, 221. \n395.  DeStefano  decided  not  to  participate  in  girls’  sports  after  beginning  to  take \nhormones.  7-17-17 Tr. at 245. \n396.  DeStefano was named to BASH’s homecoming court as a male member, and was \nalmost named homecoming king.  7-17-17 Tr. at 222, 223, 224. \n397.  During  his  senior  year,  DeStefano’s  counselor  stated  that  he  could  use  the \nbathroom and locker room corresponding to his gender identity, i.e. the boys’ bathroom and \nlocker room.  7-17-17 Tr. at 219, 220. \n398.  DeStefano “loved hearing” that he was allowed to use the boys’ facilities as a \nsenior.  7-17-17 Tr. at 229, 246.  He could not put into words how it felt to be able to go into the \nbathroom “[he was] supposed to go into.”  Id. at 229.  He was “speechless.”  Id. at 243, 246. \n399.  During the beginning of the school year when the locker room was still under \nconstruction, DeStefano took it upon himself to check with his peers to see if they were ok with \n80 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 81 of 142\nhim using the facilities because he did not want to create a problem.  7-17-17 Tr. at 219, 220, \n225.  He did not receive any opposition, so he used the male facilities.  Id. at 220. \n400.  If DeStefano had received opposition to using the boys’ facilities, he “probably \nwould have just changed in the nurse’s bathroom” to avoid a confrontation.  7-17-17 Tr. at 220. \n401.  When DeStefano changed for gym class, he would take off all clothes except for \nhis boxers.  7-17-17 Tr. at 227. \n402.  Regarding his experience in the boys’ locker room and bathrooms, DeStefano \nindicated that he has “no trouble in the bathrooms or locker room.  Sometimes someone stares, \nbut usually I am treated just like all of the other guys.  No one harasses me or questions me.  The \nsupport from the students is really amazing.”  DeStefano Decl. at ¶ 13. \n403.  Although DeStefano had permission to use the boys’ bathroom, he still used the \nnurse’s bathroom “quite frequently.”  7-17-17 Tr. at 224. \n404.  DeStefano  went  on  the  senior  trip  to  Disney  World  during  which  he  stayed \novernight with his cousin, who is a female.  7-17-17 Tr. at 226, 227.  There was some discussion \nabout DeStefano staying with other girls, but in the end the girls’ parents would not consent to \nthose overnight accommodations.  Id. at 226, 227, 230, 231. \n405.  Although he would have liked to room with boys, he accepted staying with a girl \nbecause those were the school rules.  7-17-17 Tr. at 231. \n406.  DeStefano has never been questioned when he used the men’s room in public and \nhad used the men’s room in the courthouse on the date of his testimony in this case.  7-17-17 Tr. \nat 234, 235. \n407.  Throughout his life, DeStefano has not experienced any bullying, questioning, or \nphysical altercations, and he “didn’t get discriminated” against.  7-17-17 Tr. at 237, 241, 242. \n81 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 82 of 142\n408.  If the School District had ceased allowing him to use the boys’ facilities while at \nBASH, it would have been “disheartening” to him.  7-17-17 Tr. at 229. \n409.  When indicating what advice he would give other transgender students at BASH, \nDeStefano referenced his success with making sure that the people in the locker room accepted \nhim  before  he  went  in,  and  then,  if  the  others  did  not  like  it,  he  recommended  that  the \ntransgender students (1) use the nurse’s office, (2) change in a stall, or (3) wear gym clothes \nunder school clothes.  7-17-17 Tr. at 244-245. \n410.  DeStefano  “see[s]  both  sides”  of  the  issue  at  BASH.    7-17-17  Tr.  at  243.  \nDeStefano  heard  from  some  students  saying  that  they  were  uncomfortable  before  with  a \ntransgender dressing in the locker room, but upon hearing this, he told them to “maybe change \ninto [sic] a stall.”  Id. at 243. \nH.

Standard – Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n  “A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.”  Winter \nv. Natural Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008); see Kos Pharm., Inc. v. Andrx Corp., 369 \nF.3d 700, 708 (3d Cir. 2004) (“Preliminary injunctive relief is an extraordinary remedy and \nshould  be  granted  only  in  limited  circumstances.”  (citation  and  internal  quotation  marks \nomitted)).  A district court should not grant a motion for preliminary injunctive relief unless the \nmoving party shows “(1) a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that [the moving party] will \nsuffer irreparable harm if the injunction is denied; (3) that granting preliminary relief will not \nresult in even greater harm to the nonmoving party; and (4) that the public interest favors such \nrelief.”  Kos Pharm., Inc. 369 F.3d at 708 (citing Allegheny Energy, Inc. v. DQE, Inc., 171 F.3d \n153, 158 (3d Cir. 1999)).  Additionally, to obtain a preliminary injunction, the moving party \nmust establish its entitlement to such relief by clear evidence on the merits of its claim.  See \nWinter, 555 U.S. at 22 (explaining that “a preliminary injunction . . . is . . . an extraordinary \nremedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such \nrelief”). \n \n83 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 84 of 142\nRegarding the application of the four factors referenced above, \na movant for preliminary equitable relief must meet the threshold for the first two \n“most critical” factors: it must demonstrate that it can win on the merits (which \nrequires a showing significantly better than negligible but not necessarily more \nlikely than not) and that it is more likely than not to suffer irreparable harm in the \nabsence of preliminary relief.  If these gateway factors are met, a court then \nconsiders the remaining two factors and determines in its sound discretion if all \nfour factors, taken together, balance in favor of granting the requested preliminary \nrelief.    In  assessing  these  factors,  Judge  Easterbrook’s  observation  bears \nrepeating: “How strong a claim on the merits is enough depends on the balance of \nthe harms: the more net harm an injunction can prevent, the weaker the plaintiff’s \nclaim  on  the  merits  can  be  while  still  supporting  some  preliminary  relief.  \n[Hoosier Energy Rural Elec. Corp., Inc. v. John Hancock Life Ins. Co., 582 F.3d \n721, 725 (7th Cir. 2009) (Easterbrook, C.J.).] \n \nReilly v. City of Harrisburg, 858 F.3d 173, 179 (3d Cir. 2017) (internal footnotes omitted).43  \nAlso, a party’s failure to demonstrate a likelihood of success in the litigation or an irreparable \ninjury  “must  necessarily  result  in  the  denial  of  a  preliminary  injunction.”    In  re  Arthur \nTreacher’s Franchisee Litig., 689 F.2d 1137, 1143 (3d Cir. 1982).  Nonetheless, and as indicated \nabove, “there may be circumstances when the plaintiff satisfies the first two factors, but the \n                                                 \n43 Both the defendants and PYC cite to Nutrasweet Co. v. Vit-Mar Enterprises, Inc., 176 F.3d 151 (3d Cir. 1999) for \nthe proposition that “the [movant’s] failure to establish any element in its favor renders a preliminary injunction \ninappropriate.” See Intervenor-Def. Pa. Youth Cong. Found.’s Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law \n(“PYC’s Findings and Conclusions”) at p. 18, ¶ 96 (quoting Nutrasweet), Doc. No. 58; Defendants’ Second Set of \nProposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Regarding Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (“Defs.’ Findings and \nConclusions”) at p. 24 (quoting Nutrasweet), Doc. No. 59.  In Reilly, the Third Circuit noted that starting in \nOpticians Ass’n of America v. Independent Opticians of America, 920 F.2d 187, 191-92 (3d Cir. 1990), various \nThird Circuit panels “held that a district court ‘must consider four factors’ and that ‘[o]nly if the movant produces \nevidence sufficient to convince the trial judge that all four factors favor preliminary relief should the injunction \nissue.’” 858 F.3d at 177 (quoting Opticians Ass’n of Am., 920 F.2d at 191-92).  The court pointed out that the \nOpticians Ass’n of America line of cases conflicted with the other decisions, going back to a decision in Delaware \nRiver Port Authority v. Transamerican Trailer Transport, Inc., 501 F.2d 917, 919-20 (3d Cir. 1974), which called \nfor a balancing of the four factors.  Id.  The court then explained that “the conflicting line of cases and \ncorresponding confusion in our Court appear to be the product of compounded subtle misinterpretations of our \nlongstanding jurisprudence.”  Id. \n  The court went on to explain that Third Circuit panels are required to follow prior precedential decisions \nunless the court en banc does not do so, and that no en banc court overruled Transamerican Trailer.  Id.  Thus, all \nsubsequent Third Circuit panels should have followed the balancing of the four factors approach enunciated in \nTransamerican Trailer.  Id.  In addition, the court explained that the Supreme Court’s decision in Winter “did not \noverrule our balancing-of-the-factors standard” and, instead, supported this standard upon a more in depth review of \nthe Court’s reasoning in that case.  Id. \n  For purposes of this opinion, the court follows the standard set forth in Reilly as it appears to be the proper \nrecitation of the standard for parties to satisfy before the court may issue preliminary injunctive relief. \n84 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 85 of 142\nbalance  of  the  equities  and/or  the  public  interest  militate  against  granting  a  preliminary \ninjunction.”  Fres-co Sys.

New Castle Cty., 40 F.3d \n645, 647 (3d Cir. 1994); see also University of Tex. v.

Thus,  “[a]  party  seeking  a  mandatory \npreliminary  injunction  that  will  alter  the  status  quo  bears  a  particularly  heavy  burden  in \ndemonstrating its necessity.” Acierno, 40 F.3d at 647 (citation omitted). \nB.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n1.  Plaintiffs’ Section 1983 Constitutional Privacy Claims \na.  Summary of the Parties’ Arguments \n  The plaintiffs contend that the defendants’ practice of allowing transgender students to \nuse  the  locker  rooms  and  bathrooms  corresponding  to  their  gender  identities  violates  the \nplaintiffs’ “fundamental right to bodily privacy from persons of the opposite sex” under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  See Memorandum of Law in Supp. of \nPls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (“Pls.’ Mem.”) at 10, 11 & n.6, Doc. No. 16-1.  The practice violates \ntheir right to bodily privacy because it departs from “our universal tradition,” which separates \nprivacy facilities such as locker rooms and rest rooms based on biological sex rather than on an \nindividual’s “subjective perception” of their own gender.44  Id. at 10.  They believe that “[t]he \n                                                 \n44 The plaintiffs contend that “[a] policy that separates our privacy facilities on the basis of gender identity rather \nthan sex also suffers from absolute unworkability.”  Pls.’ Mem. at 10 n.5; see also Reply Br. in Supp. of Pls.’ Mot. \nfor Prelim. Inj. (“Pls.’ Reply”) at 4; Plaintiffs’ Suppl. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (“Pls.’ Findings and \nConclusions”) at ECF p. 27, ¶ 146.  In support of this assertion, the plaintiffs refer to the spectrum of possible \n85 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 86 of 142\nConstitution prohibits Defendants from placing  students in situations where their bodies or \nprivate, intimate activities may be exposed to the opposite sex or where the students will use \nprivacy facilities with someone of the opposite sex.”  Id. at 13. \n  With regard to their assertion that they have identified a fundamental right at issue in this \ncase, the plaintiffs indicate that the right to bodily privacy from members of the opposite sex is \n“‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition’ and ‘implicit in the concept of ordered \nliberty,’ such that ‘neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed.’” Id. (quoting \nWashington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721 (1997)).45  They note that various Pennsylvania \n                                                                                                                                                             \ngender identities, such as genderqueer or third gender, that fall outside of individuals identifying with the binary \nconstructs of “male” and “female.”  Id.  While it appears to be undeniable that sex-segregated privacy facilities such \nas restrooms and bathrooms appear to be incompatible with being able to accommodate the entire spectrum of \npossible gender identities (particularly for an individual that does not identify with either sex/gender), it is not as if \ndividing privacy facilities based on biological sex covers the entire spectrum of biological sex assignments.  See, \ne.g., Jennifer Rellis, “Please Write ‘E’ in This Box” Toward Self-Identification and Recognition of a Third Gender: \nApproaches in the United States and India, 14 Mich. J. Gender & L. 223, 223 (2008) (explaining that “[o]ne to four \npercent of the world population is intersexed, not fully male or female.” (citation omitted)).  Thus, one could argue \nthat separating privacy facilities based on biological sex (which the plaintiffs define by a person’s internal and \nexternal reproductive organs) is “absolute[ly] unworkabl[e]” as well.  As such, certain groups of individuals could \nbe excluded under either method of designating the use of restrooms, locker rooms, and other privacy facilities.  For \nthose individuals “for whom there is no safe, accessible restroom in public places,” some commentators have \nsuggested replacing sex-segregated public restrooms with “all-gender, multi-user facilities that protect the privacy \nand safety concerns of all patrons, while discriminating against no one.” Terry S. Kogan, Public Restrooms and the \nDistorting of Transgender Identity, 95 N.C. L. Rev. 1205, 1205 (2017); see also Alanna M. Jereb, The Bathroom \nRight for Transgender Students and How the Entire LGBT Community Can Align to Guarantee This, 7 Wake Forest \nJ.L. & Pol'y 585, 606 (2017) (discussing two possible solutions to transgender students’ bathroom issue, including \nthe provision of unisex bathrooms) \n  Regardless, the court is not faced with having to determine the wisdom of the School District’s practice or \nwhether it is unworkable in this case.  The facts of this case do not involve any of the potential scenarios \ncontemplated by the plaintiffs as there is no evidence that any student at BASH who has received permission to use \na facility corresponding to the student’s gender identity falls into these other gender identities and, as the defendants \nhave indicated that they do not necessarily have a plan in place for dealing with requests from students other than \nstudents identifying with the binary gender/sexes of male and female, it is unclear how the “workability” of the \nSchool District’s practice as to students outside of the binary genders/sexes of male and female affect the plaintiffs \nin this case. \n45 Interestingly, while the plaintiffs only mention it by name once in their supporting memorandum of law and fail to \nmention it at all in their supplemental proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, it is apparent that the \nplaintiffs are asserting their privacy right under substantive due process principles.  The court reaches this \nconclusion based upon (1) the plaintiffs’ assertion that the defendants violated a “fundamental right,” (2) the \nplaintiffs’ citation to Glucksberg, which discussed, inter alia, how the Supreme Court identified “fundamental \nrights” as part of the substantive due process analysis, and (3) the plaintiffs’ reference to the need to apply strict \nscrutiny to the defendants’ practice and the plaintiffs’ reference to the standard for substantive due process set forth \nin Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 301-02 (1993), see Pls.’ Mem. at 23. \n86 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 87 of 142\nlaws, including the Pennsylvania’s Public School Code of 1949 “require[s] the use of separate \nfacilities on the basis of sex in a myriad of contexts.”  Id. at 14 & n.7 (citing various sections of \nthe Pennsylvania Code).  They also point out that even nationally, various courts recognize that \nsex-segregated facilities historically accommodate privacy needs from the opposite sex.  Id. at \n14-15 (citing cases).  Further, when it comes to students, the plaintiffs argue that the government \ncannot force minors to “endure the risk of intimate exposure to the opposite sex.”  Id. at 16.   \nMoreover, they point out that the law protects against conduct involving violations of privacy \nfrom the opposite sex and exposure to another person’s unclothed body, and this includes, inter \nalia, (1) civil lawsuits against Peeping Toms, (2) criminalizing (a) open lewdness, (b) viewing or \nfilming another person in a state of undress when that person had a reasonable expectation of \nprivacy, (c) indecent exposure, and (d) minors “sexting,” i.e. when a minor sends a naked picture \nof himself or herself via electronic means.  Id. (citing cases and statutes). \n  Regarding the defendants’ violation(s) of the plaintiffs’ fundamental rights, the plaintiffs \ncontend that the defendants’ practice of allowing transgender students (again, classified by the \nplaintiffs as “persons of the opposite sex”) to use the bathrooms and locker rooms corresponding \nto their gender identity violates their privacy.  Id. at 18.  They assert that the defendants’ practice \nviolates their privacy even if intimate areas of their bodies are not exposed as even their (in \nparticular, the girls’) “modesty” is protected from intrusion.  Id. at 18-20 (citing Livingwell \n(North) Inc. v. Pennsylvania Human Relations Comm’n, 606 A.2d 1287 (Pa. Commw. 1992)).  \n                                                                                                                                                             \n  Also, while the Third Circuit has focused on the Fourteenth Amendment when discussing the right to \nprivacy outside of the search and seizure context, the court has not always explicitly correlated that right with the \nFourteenth Amendment right to substantive due process.  Nonetheless, it appears that to the extent that the Third \nCircuit has recognized this right, the court has characterized it as the “Fourteenth Amendment’s substantive due \nprocess right to privacy.”  See Doe v. Delie, 257 F.3d 309, 323 (3d Cir. 2001) (“[W]e hold today that prison inmates \nretain a Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process right to privacy in their medical information.”); see also \nNunez v. Pachman, 578 F.3d 228, 231 n.7 (3d Cir. 2009) (“The Supreme Court has recognized that notions of \nsubstantive due process contained within the Fourteenth Amendment safeguard individuals from unwarranted \ngovernmental intrusions into their personal lives.  This right to privacy actually encompasses two distinct interests[, \nincluding] . . . the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters[.]”). \n87 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 88 of 142\nFurthermore, the plaintiffs assert that even though they are the only plaintiffs in this lawsuit, all \nBASH students’ “rights are violated by this policy that tramples students’ dignity interest, strips \naway modesty and privacy, and leaves them humiliated and vulnerable in privacy facilities.” Id. \nat 23. \n  The plaintiffs further assert that self-identity with the opposite sex does not alter the \nanalysis and a number of courts have rejected claims that allowing transgender individuals into \nthe bathroom or locker room of the gender in which the individual identifies violates the other \nstudents’ privacy to use the restroom.  Id. at 23-25 (citing cases).  Finally, the plaintiffs argue \nthat the defendants’ practice does not pass strict scrutiny insofar as there is no compelling \ninterest which could “justif[y] obligating students to accept members of the opposite sex into \nlocker rooms, showers, and restrooms that are properly reserved to the use of one sex under \nfederal and state law.”  Id. at 25-26.  In fact, the defendants’ interest is to maintain sex-\nsegregated spaces because Pennsylvania law, including the School Code, requires as such.  Id. at \n26.  Even if there was a compelling interest, the defendants’ practice is not the least restrictive \nmeans to accomplish that interest because the defendants could permit those uncomfortable with \nusing a multi-user facility with others of the same sex to use a single-user facility.  Id. at 26-27. \n  In contending that the plaintiffs have failed to establish a likelihood of success on the \nmerits on their section 1983 invasion of privacy claim, the defendants do not devote a significant \nportion of their submissions to attacking the plaintiffs’ assertion of the right allegedly infringed \nin this case.  To the extent that there are objections to the characterization of the right at issue, \nthe School District asserts that \n[n]o case recognizes a right to privacy such as the one Plaintiffs assert here that \ninsulates a person from ever coming into any contact at all with someone who is \ndifferent than they are, or who they fear will act in a way that causes them to be \nembarrassed or uncomfortable, when there are alternative means – in this case, \n88 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 89 of 142\nsingle-user bathrooms – for both individuals to protect themselves from such \ncontact, embarrassment or discomfort. \n \nDefendants’ Mem. in Opp. to the Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (“Defs.’ Mem.”) at 8-9, Doc. No. 34.  In \naddition,  the  defendants  argue  that  the  plaintiffs’  claims  do  not  fit  into  the  categories  of \nfundamental rights previously recognized by the courts, such as marriage, family, procreation, \nand the right to bodily integrity, and are not sufficiently fundamental to qualify as a new \nfundamental right.  Id. at 9. \n  The defendants also assert that the plaintiffs cannot show a likelihood of success on the \nmerits of their section 1983 claim because there is no government compulsion in this case.  Id. at \n8; see also Defs.’ Findings and Conclusions at 27-28, ¶ 7 (“Plaintiffs . . . are not required by a \nstate actor – in this case the School District – to use restrooms or locker rooms with any \ntransgender student.”).  The defendants note that no students – transgender or cisgender – are \nrequired to use a bathroom or locker room as there are (1) individual toilet stalls (with doors and \nlocks) and individual shower stalls (with curtains) for use in the locker rooms, (2) individual \ntoilet stalls (with doors and locks) in the multi-user bathrooms, (3) single-user facilities (at least \nfive that students can use generally and three more than are available depending on the student’s \nbusiness at the time) available for students who do not want to use the multi-user bathrooms and \nthe toilet stalls therein or the common area of the locker room and the individual toilet and \nshower stalls therein, and (4) team rooms that Dr. Cooper has indicated that the School District is \nwilling to allow students to use.  Id. \n  For their final arguments relating to the plaintiffs’ constitutional invasion of privacy \nclaim, the defendants generally assert that the plaintiffs’ privacy rights must be balanced with the \nSchool District’s need “to preserve the discretion of schools to craft individualized approaches to \ndifficult issues that are appropriate for their respective communities.”  Id. at 30-31, ¶ 10.  The \n89 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 90 of 142\ndefendants seek to have the court not constrain them from fulfilling their duties to serving as “a \nprincipal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values,” which is deeply rooted in this \nnation’s history and tradition.  Id. (quoting Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, \n287 (1988) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).  The defendants also contend that \npublic policy supports their practice as “[c]ontemporary notions of liberty and justice,” which \nsupport  transgender  students  using  restrooms  and  locker  rooms  aligned  with  their  gender \nidentities, “are inconsistent with the exceedingly broad right to privacy asserted by Plaintiffs.”  \nId. at 33, ¶ 15. \n  As for PYC, it contends that the plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on their constitutional \ninvasion of privacy claims because the School District has not actually invaded their privacy \ninsofar as the School District does not compel them to use the common restrooms and locker \nrooms.  Intervenor-Def. Pa. Youth Congress Found.’s Resp. in Opp. to Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj. \n(“PYC’s Mem.”) at 4, Doc. No. 33.  In addition, PYC notes that (1) the “mere presence” of \ntransgender students in the opposite biological sex’s facilities does not constitute an invasion of \nany student’s constitutional right to privacy, and (2) the plaintiffs cite to no case supporting the \nproposition that there is an invasion of their privacy through their viewing other students in a \nstate of undress.  Id. at 5.  Further, even if the defendants’ practice intruded on the plaintiffs’ \n(and  other  BASH  students’)  constitutional  right  to  privacy,  PYC  contends  that  the  School \nDistrict has a legitimate interest in permitting transgender students to use facilities matching their \ngender identity to ensure that they can “fully participate in school life without being singled out \nfor unequal treatment and stigma.”  Id. at 8-9. \n \n \n90 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 91 of 142\nb.  Analysis \n  In  addressing  whether  the  plaintiffs  are  likely  to  succeed  on  the  merits  of  their \nconstitutional invasion of privacy claim, the court must first address whether the plaintiffs are \nasserting a fundamental right as they claim and the precise contours of that right.  To analyze \nwhether the plaintiffs are asserting such a fundamental right and the contours of the right as \ndefined by the facts of this case, the court is guided by the Third Circuit’s decision in Doe v. \nLuzerne County, 660 F.3d 169 (2011).46  In Doe, the Third Circuit described the law applicable \nto claims about purported violations of a constitutional right to privacy under the Fourteenth \nAmendment as follows: \n“The United States Constitution does not mention an explicit right to \nprivacy and the United States Supreme Court has never proclaimed that such a \ngeneralized right exists.” C.N. v. Ridgewood Bd. of Educ., 430 F.3d 159, 178 (3d \nCir. 2005). But see Sterling v. Borough of Minersville, 232 F.3d 190, 193 (3d Cir. \n2000)  (stating  that  the  Supreme  Court  “acknowledged  the  individual’s \nconstitutional right to privacy” in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. \n                                                 \n46 In relying on Doe, the court recognizes that the facts underlying the purported constitutional violation in that case \nare not remotely analogous to the facts in this case.  Doe involved a female police officer plaintiff who was \nsubjected to a flea infestation after entering a disarrayed and unsanitary residence while serving a bench warrant.  \n660 F.3d at 171.  During the flea decontamination process, Doe went to a hospital decontamination area and \nshowered using chemical shampoo.  Id. at 172.  After completing her shower, Doe found that the decontamination \narea lacked towels and the only item that she could use to cover her naked body was “a roll of thin paper of the type \nthat typically covers a doctor’s examination table.”  Id.  Doe claimed that this paper was semi-transparent or at least \nbecame semi-transparent when she covered her wet body with it.  Id. \n  At the request of another female police officer who was assisting her with the decontamination, Doe \ncovered her private areas with the paper and this other officer entered the room, closed the door behind her, and \nbegan inspecting Doe for any remaining fleas.  Id. at 173.  While Doe’s back was facing the door to the room, and \nwith Doe having “most of her back, shoulders and legs . . . completely exposed . . . [with] the thin paper, which \ncould have been semi-transparent, . . . wrapped around her buttocks and breasts[,]” two male police officers opened \nthe door approximately a foot and observed Doe.  Id.  One of the male officers had a video camera and was \nrecording Doe.  Id.  After a comment by one of the male officers, Doe turned her head toward the sound and noticed \nthe male officers.  Id.  Without turning around, Doe yelled at the male officers to leave the room.  Id.  The parties \ndisputed how much of Doe’s body the two male officers observed in the decontamination area.  Id. \n  To make matters worse, the male officer who was filming Doe – he had also filmed portions of Doe’s \nentire ordeal from the reporting of the contamination at the residence to Doe entering the hospital, purportedly for \n“training purposes” – uploaded pictures and video of Doe (and another officer that had also entered the residence \nwith Doe) onto his work computer and apparently stored some of the pictures and video on a public computer folder \naccessible to anyone on the county network.  Id. at 173-74.  This same male officer shared photos and videos of the \nincident with other members of the police department, although it was unknown who saw them and exactly what \nthey saw.  Id.  Nonetheless, apparently the files saved on the public computer contained a photo of Doe’s bare back \nand a photo of Doe’s bare back and bare shoulders, with both photos showing “the outline of Doe’s buttocks—\ncovered only by thin, wet hospital paper.”  Id. at 174. \n91 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 92 of 142\n1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965)). The Supreme Court, however, has found certain \nconstitutional “zones of privacy.” C.N., 430 F.3d at 178 (citing Roe v. Wade, 410 \nU.S. 113, 152–53, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973)). From these zones of \nprivacy,  we  have  articulated  two  types  of  privacy  interests  rooted  in  the \nFourteenth  Amendment.  Nunez  v.  Pachman,  578  F.3d  228,  231  n.7  (3d  Cir. \n2009); see also Malleus v. George, 641 F.3d 560, 564 (3d Cir. 2011); C.N., 430 \nF.3d at 178. The first  privacy interest is the “individual interest in avoiding \ndisclosure of personal matters,” and the second is the “interest in independence in \nmaking certain kinds of important decisions.” C.N., 430 F.3d at 178; see also \nMalleus, 641 F.3d at 564; Hedges v. Musco, 204 F.3d 109, 121 (3d Cir. 2000). \nThe first privacy interest is at issue in this matter. \n \n“‘The  right not to  have intimate facts concerning one’s life disclosed \nwithout one’s consent’ is ‘a venerable [right] whose constitutional significance we \nhave recognized in the past.’” C.N., 430 F.3d at 179 (quoting Bartnicki v. Vopper, \n200 F.3d 109, 122 (3d Cir. 1999)). Justice Brandeis, in dissent, famously referred \nto this as “the right to be let alone.” Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 478, \n48 S.Ct. 564, 72 L.Ed. 944 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). \n \nThe  touchstone  of  constitutional  privacy  protection  is  whether  the \ninformation  at  issue  is  “within  an  individual’s  reasonable  expectations  of \nconfidentiality.”  Malleus,  641  F.3d  at  564;  see  also  C.N.,  430  F.3d  at  179; \nFraternal Order of Police, Lodge No. 5 v. City of Phila., 812 F.2d 105, 112 (3d \nCir.1987)  (“Fraternal  Order  of  Police”).  The  more  intimate  or  personal  the \ninformation,  the  more  reasonable  the  expectation  is  that  it  will  remain \nconfidential. Fraternal Order of Police, 812 F.2d at 112–13 (citing United States \nv. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 638 F.2d 570, 577 & n. 5 (3d Cir. 1980)); see \nalso  Malleus,  641  F.3d  at  564;  C.N.,  430  F.3d  at  179.  Indeed,  the  “federal \nconstitution ... protects against public disclosure [of] only highly personal matters \nrepresenting the most intimate aspects of human affairs,” thereby shielding from \npublic scrutiny “only that information which involves deeply rooted notions of \nfundamental personal interests derived from the Constitution.” Nunez, 578 F.3d at \n232 (emphasis omitted) (citation and quotation marks omitted). \n \nWe have found the following types of information to be protected: a \nprivate  employee’s  medical  information  that  was  sought  by  the  government; \nmedical, financial and behavioral information relevant to a police investigator; a \npublic employee’s prescription record; a minor student’s pregnancy status; sexual \norientation; and an inmate’s HIV-positive status. Malleus, 641 F.3d at 565 (citing \ncases and explaining that information encompassed by the constitutional right to \nprivacy may be separated into categories reflecting sexual, medical and some \nfinancial information). \n \n660 F.3d at 175-76. \n92 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 93 of 142\n  The Third Circuit went on to conclude that “Doe had a reasonable expectation of privacy \nwhile in the [d]econtamination [a]rea, particularly while in the presence of members of the \nopposite sex.”  Id. at 177 (alteration to original).  In reaching this conclusion, the court also \npointed out that “[p]rivacy claims under the Fourteenth Amendment necessarily require fact-\nintensive  and  context-specific  analyses,  and  unfortunately,  bright  lines  generally  cannot  be \ndrawn.”  Id. at 176.  The court further explained that \n[t]he difficulty in drawing a bright line is evident as we are not aware of any court \nof appeals that has adopted either a requirement that certain anatomical areas of \none’s body, such as genitalia, must have been exposed for that person to maintain \na privacy claim under the Fourteenth Amendment or a rule that a nonconsensual \nexposure of certain anatomical areas constitutes a per se violation. \n \nId.  The court also “refuse[d] to draw bright lines based on anatomical parts or regions,” and \nexplained that courts must “analyze the specific circumstances under which the alleged violation \noccurred.”  Id. at 176-77. \n  The plaintiffs cite to Doe for the proposition that “[o]ne has a ‘constitutionally protected \nprivacy interest in his or her partially clothed body,’” see Pls.’ Mem. at 11 (quoting Doe, 660 \nF.3d at 175-76), and it appears that the other parties do not dispute that Doe recognized that \nparticular constitutional privacy interest.47  If this right is the end of the inquiry, there is no \nlikelihood of the plaintiffs prevailing in this case. \n                                                 \n47 While the Third Circuit in Doe indicated that “[a]lthough the issue of whether one may have a constitutionally \nprotected privacy interest in his or her partially clothed body is a matter of first impression in this circuit, other \ncircuits—including the Second, Sixth and Ninth Circuits—have held that such a right exists,” the court did not \nexplicitly state that such a privacy right existed.  Id. at 176.  Nonetheless, in finding that Doe, who was partially \nclothed at the time of the purported initial violation, had a reasonable expectation of privacy while she was in the \ndecontamination area, the court seemingly had to find that this privacy interest existed although it is apparent that \nthe precise contours of that right are case determinative insofar as the Third Circuit remanded the case to the district \ncourt because of factual issues concerning the parts of Doe’s body that the male officers actually viewed.  In this \nregard, the Third Circuit found that there existed disputed issues of fact “as to which of Doe’s body parts were \nexposed to members of the opposite sex and/or filmed while she was in the [d]econtamination [a]rea” insofar as “the \nissues of whether Doe’s breasts or buttocks were exposed would affect the outcome of the suit.”  Id. at 177-78. \n93 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 94 of 142\n  In  this  regard,  the  plaintiffs  have  yet  to  prove  that  the  defendants  violated  their \nconstitutionally protected privacy interest in their partially clothed bodies.48  Mary Smith entered \na bathroom and saw Student B while both students were fully clothed.  As such, Mary Smith’s \nconstitutionally protected privacy interest in her partially clothed body was not violated. \n  Regarding Joel Doe, he was in his underwear and a t-shirt when he saw Student A.  As \nexplained in the findings of fact, there is conflicting evidence as to whether Student A saw Joel \nDoe in his underwear.  There surely is not enough credible evidence that the court would \nconclude that Joel Doe was likely to prove that Student A saw him in his underwear. \n  Finally, Jack Jones testified that he was in his underwear and initially had his back turned \nto Student A.  When he turned around, Student A was staring into Student A’s locker and Jack \nJones quickly moved away so Student A could not see him.  While it appears that Student A was \nin close proximity to Jack Jones, the court cannot infer that Student A saw Jack Jones in his \nunderwear and would not find that Jack Jones would be likely to succeed on such a claim if \npresented to a jury based solely on the evidence currently before the court.  The court also notes \nthat Jane Jones testified that when Jack Jones reported the incident to her, he did not tell her that \nStudent A saw him in his underwear.  Therefore, while it is unclear whether Joel Doe and Jack \nJones are claiming that Student A saw them in their underwear because they inconsistently assert \nthis point (which would seem to be extremely important to their claim), to the extent they are \nasserting as such, the court finds that they are not likely to succeed on any claim that involves \nthem being wrongfully viewed while in a state of partial undress because of the conflicting \nevidence in the record.49 \n                                                 \n48 Macy Roe testified that, as far as she knew, she never encountered a transgender student while in a locker room or \nbathroom at BASH. \n49 Yet another example of this inconsistency is illustrated by the plaintiffs’ statement in their reply brief that the \ndefendants and PYC “conveniently ignore the fact that both Joel Doe and Jack Jones were already caught in the \n94 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 95 of 142\n  Nonetheless, it is evident by the plaintiffs’ description of the fundamental right in this \ncase – the fundamental right to bodily privacy from members of the opposite sex – that the \nplaintiffs are seeking to include additional conduct as violating their right to privacy.  It appears \nthat these additional forms of conduct include (1) males being able to hear females when females \nare opening products to deal with menstruation issues or using the restrooms, (2) males being \naround females with the opportunity to view females where they could discern that the girls are \nhaving menstruation issues, (3) members of the opposite sex being in locker rooms or bathrooms \nwith each other regardless of anyone being in a state of undress, and (4) having to view a \ntransgender person in a state of undress since that student is actually a member of the opposite \nsex. \n  Generally, a fundamental right is “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” \nand “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,” such that “neither liberty nor justice would exist \nif they were sacrificed.”  Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721 (1997).  The Supreme \nCourt has “‘always been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process because \nguideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this uncharted area are scarce and open-ended’” \nand because doing so “place[s] the matter outside the arena of public debate and legislative \naction.” Id. at 720 (quoting Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 125 (1992)).  Thus, “[t]he \ndoctrine of judicial self-restraint requires [courts] to exercise the utmost care whenever [they] are \nasked to break new ground in this field.” Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 302 (1993). \n  The plaintiffs have not identified  and this court has not located any  court that has \nrecognized a constitutional right of privacy as broadly defined by the plaintiffs.  The only court \nthat seemingly has addressed a similar if not identical constitutional privacy claim was the \n                                                                                                                                                             \nobjectively offensive and embarrassing circumstance of standing in their underwear when a classmate of the \nopposite sex was with them.” Reply Br. in Supp. of Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim.

United States Dep’t of Education, No. 16-cv-4945, 2016 WL 6134121 (Oct. 18, 2016) \n(hereinafter referred to as “Students”).  In Students, United States Magistrate Judge Jeffrey T. \nGilbert issued a report and recommendation which recommended denying the plaintiffs’ motion \nfor a preliminary injunction.  The plaintiffs in that case had sued, among others, the Department \nof Education and school directors of a school district.  2016 WL 6134121 at *1.  In the action, \nthe  plaintiffs  sought  a  preliminary  injunction  that  would  have  ceased  the  school  directors’ \nexisting policies that allowed transgender students to use locker rooms and restrooms on the \nbasis of their gender identity and required the school district to segregate restrooms and locker \nrooms on the basis of the students’ biological sex.  Id.  Thus, on its face, the plaintiffs in Students \nwere seeking the same relief as the plaintiffs in this case.50 \n  One of the plaintiffs’ claims in Students was that the school directors’ policy (there were \nwritten policies with respect to bathrooms and locker rooms) violated their constitutional rights \n“‘to privacy in one’s fully or partially unclothed body’” and “‘to be free from State-compelled \nrisk of intimate exposure to oneself to the opposite sex.’”  Id. at *22 (citation omitted).  The \ncourt determined that the plaintiffs had too broadly defined the right at issue in the case because \nit was not tied to the facts of the case and there is no generalized constitutional right to privacy \n“in the substantive due process context.”  Id. at *21-22 (citations omitted).  The court then \nrephrased the right at issue and the question for the court to resolve as: “do high school students \nhave a constitutional right not to share restrooms or locker rooms with transgender students \nwhose sex assigned at birth is different than theirs?” Id. at *23. \n                                                 \n50 The plaintiffs in Students were also represented by multiple counsel, including attorneys from Alliance Defending \nFreedom, which is also one of the legal groups representing the plaintiffs in the instant case. \n96 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 97 of 142\n  The court concluded that the plaintiff high school students did not have a constitutional \nright not to share restrooms or locker rooms with transgender students whose sex assigned at \nbirth is different than theirs.  Id.  In reaching this conclusion, Magistrate Judge Gilbert explained \nthat the court did not have to limit the definition of “sex” to an individual’s sex at birth as the \nSeventh Circuit Court of Appeals had in the Title VII context in Ulane v. Eastern Airlines, Inc., \n742 F.2d 1081, 1084 (1984), and could address gender identity without being limited to having \nto frame the issue by the students’ sex assigned at birth.  Id.  The court also pointed out that the \nschool directors’ policies did not require the plaintiffs to use locker rooms or bathrooms with \ntransgender  students  because  (1)  they  could  use  the  private  stalls  and  protections  in  the \nbathrooms and locker rooms and, (2) if those protections did not provide sufficient comfort for a \nparticular student, the uncomfortable student could use an alternative facility to ensure the \nstudent’s privacy needs.  Id.  This lack of compulsion by the school district distinguished the \nschool directors’ policies from the cases referenced by the plaintiffs.51  Id. \n  The  court  also  pointed  out  that  “[i]n  assessing  the  nature  and  scope  of  Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional rights, and whether those rights have been infringed, the Court also must consider \nthe need to preserve the discretion of schools to craft individualized approaches to difficult issues \nthat  are  appropriate  for  their  respective  communities.”    Id.  at  *24.    In  addition,  the  court \nindicated that students have less constitutional privacy rights in public schools than they would \nelsewhere.  Id. at *25. \n  The  court  further  explained  that  “[c]ontemporary  notions  of  liberty  and  justice  are \ninconsistent with the existence of the right to privacy asserted by Plaintiffs and properly framed \nby this Court” insofar as transgender students do not “live [their] lives in conformance with \n[their] sex assigned at birth.”  Id.  The intervenors, three transgender students who attended \n                                                 \n51 The plaintiffs refer to many of the same cases here. \n97 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 98 of 142\nschool  in  the  school  district,  provided  declarations  showing  how  they  lived  their  lives  in \naccordance  with  their  gender  identity  and  were  consistently  recognized  as  such  by  the \ncommunity.  Id. \n  As a final reason for concluding that the high school students lacked the constitutional \nright at issue, the court pointed out that the school directors’ policy did not and would not (as \nfeared by the plaintiffs) allow all cisgender students to go into the locker room of the opposite \nsex; instead, it allows students to use the facilities consistent with their gender identity.  Id. at \n*26.  In addition, the school district had an agreement with one of the students, a transgender \nfemale, to use the girls’ locker rooms.  Id.  The court further noted that speculation as to \ncisgender students possibly seeking to gain entrance to the opposing sex’s bathroom and locker \nroom was not a reason to invalidate the school directors’ policy.  Id. \n  The court went on to conclude that even if the court accepted the broad constitutional \nprivacy rights asserted by the plaintiffs, the school directors did not substantially or directly \ninfringe upon the plaintiffs’ rights because, inter alia, (1) none of the cases cited by the plaintiffs \nwere applicable or “st[ood] for the proposition that the risk of bodily exposure to a transgender \nstudent in a high school restroom or locker room, particularly given the privacy protections put \nin place by [the school directors] infringes upon a fundamental right and thereby violates the \nConstitution[;]” (2) the plaintiffs’ cited cases involving the Fourth Amendment were inapplicable \nbecause the Fourth Amendment requires the government to show reasonableness before invading \na person’s privacy via a search and seizure and “substantive due process does not impose a \nsimilar restriction[;]” (3) the case did not involve the “extreme invasions of privacy that the \ncourts confronted in the cases cited by Plaintiffs;” and (4) the case did not involve the “type of \nforced invasion of privacy that animated the cases cited by Plaintiffs.”  Id. at *27-29. \n98 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 99 of 142\n  This court recognizes that Students is not binding authority and, as of this moment, is a \nreport and recommendation that has not been adopted by the referring District Court Judge.52  \nNevertheless, portions of the court’s opinion are persuasive in addressing the issues presented in \nthis case despite various subtle differences in the factual record. \n  In the first instance, as in Students, the plaintiffs here have argued for the recognition of a \nvery broad constitutional privacy right that has never been recognized by another court even \nthough courts have recognized that sex-segregated bathrooms provide for privacy protection \nfrom the opposite sex.  In fact, if such a broad right was to exist, the Third Circuit in Doe would \nnot have had to limit the right to one’s partially clothed body, because the plaintiff would have \nhad a general right to bodily privacy from the opposite sex.  There would have been no need to \nremand the case to the district court to resolve the issue of whether the defendants actually \nviolated the plaintiff’s right to privacy (as the court did not conclude that a violation occurred) \nbecause the male officers would have violated her right to privacy merely by entering the \ndecontamination  room  while  she  was  in  there  once  the  court  determined  that  Doe  had  a \nreasonable expectation of privacy in the room.  The plaintiffs’ proposed right is so expansive that \nit would be a constitutional violation for a female to be in the presence of a male inside of a \nlocker room or bathroom and vice versa, and it would be a violation of one’s constitutional right \nof privacy to view a member of the opposite sex in a state of undress even if the viewing party \nwas fully clothed at the time.  There is no support for such a broad right of privacy that has yet to \nbe recognized. \n                                                 \n52 Students also involved claims against the Department of Education based on the guidance provided in the May \n2016 Dear Colleague Letter.  Counsel represented to this court during oral argument that the rescission of that \nguidance by the current administration has caused delays in the disposition of objections to the report and \nrecommendation.  In addition, the plaintiffs have pointed out that the Department of Education, Office for Civil \nRights withdrew from the matter and terminated its enforcement efforts.  See Pls.’ Reply at 3, n.4. \n99 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 100 of 142\n  The plaintiffs have also not demonstrated that such an expansive right of privacy is \n“deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” and “implicit in the concept of ordered \nliberty.” Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 721.  Even if this right was limited to a right to bodily privacy \nfrom the opposite sex in bathrooms and locker rooms, or even if the right was limited to a \nstudent’s right of bodily privacy from the opposite sex in bathrooms and locker rooms at schools, \nthese rights are not such that “neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed.” Id.  \nDespite these possible limitations to the broad right asserted by the plaintiffs, these are not the \ncontours of the underlying right in this case because this case does not merely involve members \nof the opposite sex.  See Leamer v. Fauver, 288 F.3d 532, 546 (3d Cir. 2002) (indicating that the \nfirst  step  of  any  substantive  due  process  analysis  is  to  “define  the  ‘exact  contours  of  the \nunderlying right said to have been violated’” (quoting County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. \n833, 842 n.5 (1998)).  Instead, although the plaintiffs refuse to refer to them as such, this case \ninvolves transgender students and whether it violates cisgender students’ right to privacy for \ntransgender students to be in the locker room or bathroom that does not correspond to the \ntransgender student’s biological sex at birth. \n  As in Students, the School District’s practice here does not allow cisgender boys to go \ninto  the  girls’  bathrooms  and  locker  rooms  or  allow  cisgender  girls  to  go  into  the  boys’ \nbathrooms and locker rooms.53  Instead, the School District permits students who indicate that \nthey identify with a gender different than the sex assigned to them at birth to use the bathrooms \nand locker rooms which correspond to their gender identity.  Despite the plaintiffs’ concerns \n                                                 \n53 The parties entered into a stipulation in which two male students at BASH reported that two purportedly female \nstudents entered the boys’ bathroom (it was unclear if there was more than one instance).  Even though two female \nstudents entered the boys’ bathroom, these acts do not mean that the School District’s practice regarding use of the \nrestrooms and requiring permission before gaining access to a restroom corresponding to the student’s gender \nidentity extends to all cisgender students.  As Dr. Cooper testified, there were five to ten reported incidents with \nstudents improperly entering into bathrooms of the opposite sex before the new practice started so it is not as if this \nnew practice opened the door to numerous students wrongfully going into restrooms or locker rooms. \n100 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 101 of 142\nabout gender fluidity, gender nonconformity, or other gender identity issues that fall along the \nspectrum described by Dr. Leibowitz and referenced in the WPATH Standards of Care, there is \nno evidence in the record that any of the students that have requested and received permission \nfrom the School District have done anything other than live in a manner consistent with their \ngender identity.  In this regard, Dr. Cooper indicated that all of the transgender students that have \nreceived  permission  to  use  the  bathrooms  and  locker  rooms  corresponding  to  their  gender \nidentity have requested to have the School District refer to them as an initial or another name \nrather than their given name, and have asked to be referred to by the pronouns corresponding to \ntheir gender identity instead of their sex assigned at birth.  There is also no evidence that these \nstudents do not also outwardly portray themselves in accordance with their gender identity or are \nnot known by the community in the same regard.  Furthermore, once the transgender students \nhave received permission to go into the locker rooms and bathrooms consistent with their gender \nidentity, the School District has prohibited them from going into the bathroom corresponding \nwith their birth sex. \n  This court agrees with Students that high school students such as the plaintiffs here (or at \nleast the plaintiffs when they commenced this litigation, as Macy Roe has already graduated \nfrom  BASH)  have  no  constitutional  right  not  to  share  restrooms  and  locker  rooms  with \ntransgender students whose sex assigned at birth is different from theirs.  Also, as the defendants \nnote, there is no requirement at BASH that the plaintiffs (or any student for that matter) get \nchanged in the locker room for gym class (although they do have to change depending on the \ngym activity and if they desire to try to obtain as high of a grade as possible) or use the multi-\nuser restrooms.  Thus, no cisgender student is compelled to use a restroom with a transgender \nstudent.  If cisgender students decide to use the locker rooms, there are privacy stalls in the \n101 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 102 of 142\nshower area with curtains and toilet stalls with doors and locks for students use if the student \ndesires to not be viewed by a transgender student while changing.  If cisgender students are \nuncomfortable  even  viewing  a  transgender  student  while  they  are  changing  for  gym,  the \ncisgender students could use the team room in the locker room that does not require them to go \nthrough the common area of the locker room, or the cisgender students could use a single-user \nfacility to change.  Similarly, any cisgender student concerned with running into a transgender \nstudent in a bathroom and who does not think that urinal dividers or toilet stalls provide the \nrequisite protection of their privacy can access one of the single-user facilities.  At bottom, no \nstudent at BASH is compelled to use a privacy facility in which he or she feels uncomfortable. \n  When discussing the need for students to be protected from exposure to the members of \nthe opposite sex, the plaintiffs cite to numerous cases that simply have no application here.  For \nexample, the plaintiffs cite to Fortner v. Thomas, 983 F. 2d 1024, 1030 (11th Cir. 1993) for the \nproposition that “[m]ost people have ‘a special sense of privacy in their genitals, and involuntary \nexposure of them in the presence of other people of the other sex may be especially demeaning \nand humiliating.”  Pls.’ Findings and Conclusions at ECF p. 34, ¶ 11.  Fortner involves male \ninmates complaining about female correctional officers being assigned to locations that allow \nthem to view inmates in the showers and on the toilet.  983 F.2d at 1026.  Although unclear, the \nreference to the term “involuntary” appears to indicate that the inmates lacked the ability to \nprevent the female guards from seeing them naked.  As already indicated, there is no requirement \nat BASH that would compel a student to involuntarily expose himself or herself to another \nstudent.  The facilities there can address all students’ privacy needs. \n  Another example of citing to seemingly inapplicable cases is the plaintiffs’ references to \ncases involving strip searches of students by members of the opposite sex, which is significantly \n102 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 103 of 142\nmore egregious than merely being in the presence of a transgender student.  See Pls.’ Findings \nand Conclusions at 35 & ¶¶ 12-14, 38 & ¶ 27 (citing Cornfield v. Consolidated High Sch. Dist. \nNo. 230, 991 F.2d 1316 (7th Cir. 1993) (involving female teacher aide’s strip search of male \nstudent); Safford Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. Redding, 557 U.S. 364 (2009) (involving strip search \nof 13-year-old female student’s bra and underpants); Beard v. Whitmore Lake Sch. Dist., 402 \nF.3d 598 (6th Cir. 2005) (involving strip searches of high school students)).54  A further example \nis cases involving bona fide occupational qualifications that would preclude individuals from one \nsex from being in an area that would violate the opposite sex’s privacy interests.  Although these \ncases reference having sex-segregated areas to accommodate privacy needs, none of the cases \naddress whether the privacy interest mentioned is a constitutional right of privacy.  See, e.g., \nPls.’ Findings and Conclusions at ECF p. 38, ¶ 26 (citing St. John’s Home for Children v. West \nVa. Human Rights Comm’n, 375 S.E.2d 769, 771 (Vir. 1998) (referencing bona fide occupational \nqualification for female child care worker in a “school for disturbed adolescent[]” boys)). \n  Two other points bear mentioning.  First, even if the right articulated by the plaintiff \ncould be extended to support the existence of a constitutional right of bodily privacy from \nmembers of the opposite sex, the plaintiffs have not identified any basis for that right extending \nto a prohibition of seeing a member of the opposite sex in a state of undress such as Joel Doe and \nJack Jones experienced with Student A in October and November 2016.  To recognize, for \nexample, that a male’s constitutional privacy rights are violated by merely viewing a female in a \n                                                 \n54 The plaintiffs cite to Redding for two propositions: (1) that “adolescent vulnerability intensifies the . . . \nintrusiveness of the exposure,” and (2) “[f]orcing minors to risk exposing their bodies to the opposite sex is an \n‘embarrassing, frightening, and humiliating’ experience.”  Pls.’ Mem. at 13 (quoting Redding, 557 U.S. at 375); Pls.’ \nFindings and Conclusions at ¶¶ 13-14 (same).  As for this second proposition, the plaintiffs’ have mischaracterized \nRedding because the “opposite sex” was not involved in the strip search.  Instead, the facts show that the school \nemployees conducting the search of the 13-year-old girl student were an administrative assistant named “Helen \nRomero” and the school nurse named “Peggy Schwallier.”  While one’s name is not automatically determinative of \none’s gender or sex (as the instant case makes clear), it appears that female school employees conducted the search \nof the female student. \n103 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 104 of 142\nlocker room or even by seeing a female in a state of undress in a locker room, would extend \nconstitutional privacy rights beyond acceptable bounds.  Second, the plaintiffs reference a right \nto privacy by cisgender girls to not have transgender girls hear them when they are in the \nrestroom (particularly when they are tending to menstruation issues).  The plaintiffs cite to Borse \nv. Piece Goods Shop, Inc., 963 F.2d 611 (3d Cir. 1992) in support of the proposition that an \nindividual’s  use  of  their  senses  (which  would  presumably  include  hearing)  to  invade  the \nseclusion of another is a privacy violation.  Pls.’ Findings and Conclusions at 34, ¶ 11.  The \nBorse  case  discussed  this  type  of  intrusion  with  respect  to  a  common  law  intrusion  upon \nseclusion tort claim and did not discuss it as if it was a constitutional invasion of privacy claim.  \nFurther, to the extent that it would even reach the status of a fundamental right of privacy, there \nis no indication that this would be extended to being heard by a member of the opposite sex \nwhen the student is in an area such as a locker room or multi-user bathroom where there is a \nlimited amount of auditory privacy from anyone. \n  Since this matter does not involve any forced or involuntary exposure of a student’s body \nto  or  by  a  transgender  person,  and  the  School  District  has  instituted  numerous  privacy \nprotections  and  available  alternatives  for  uncomfortable  students  or  to  protect  against  the \ninvoluntary exposure of a student’s partially clothed or unclothed body, the plaintiffs have not \nshown that the defendants infringed upon their constitutional privacy rights.  As a final issue, \nPYC and the plaintiffs disagree over the level of scrutiny to apply to the defendants’ practice \nregarding  transgender  students’  use  of  the  bathrooms  and  locker  rooms  at  BASH.55    The \nplaintiffs  argue  that  the  practice  is  subject  to  strict  scrutiny  insofar  as  it  infringes  upon  a \nfundamental constitutional right.  Pls.’ Mem. at 25-26.  PYC contends that strict scrutiny does \nnot apply because the Third Circuit in Doe indicated that “‘[a] person’s right to avoid disclosure \n                                                 \n55 As far as the court can tell, the defendants do not address this issue. \n104 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 105 of 142\nof personal matters is not absolute,’ and ‘[d]isclosure may be required if the government interest \nin disclosure outweighs the individual’s privacy interest.’” PYC’s Mem. at 8 n.4 (quoting Doe v. \nLuzerne Cty., 660 F.3d 169, 178 (3d Cir. 2011)). \n  As already discussed, the Third Circuit in Doe was analyzing a matter in which the \nplaintiff was raising a claim that her constitutional right to privacy was violated when the two \nmale police officers entered the decontamination room and saw her in a state of undress.  But, \nthe case also involved the one male officer filming her, showing pictures and videos of her to \nother employees, and saving photos and videos to the office computer server.  When the Third \nCircuit discussed the seven-factor “flexible balancing test” used to see if the government’s \ninterest in disclosure outweighed the individual’s privacy interest, it appears that the Third \nCircuit was examining only the alleged invasion of privacy with respect to the photos and videos \nand not the invasion for the male officers viewing the plaintiff in the decontamination room.  \nFurther, the language of the balancing test does not seem to be applicable to a constitutional right \nof privacy claim like the one presented here, and applying the test to the plaintiffs’ privacy \nclaims here appears to be nonsensical.  Instead, the balancing test appears to be concerned with \ncompelling disclosure of private information contained or sought to be included in records as the \ntest repeatedly references “record[s].”  See Doe, 660 F.3d at 178 (conducting balancing test and \nevaluating the “type of records at issue [which] include photographs of Doe while she is partially \ndressed and an edited video of Doe that may include images of, among other things, Doe’s \nexposed breasts and/or buttocks”).56  Thus, it would not appear that this flexible balancing test is \n                                                 \n56 The flexible balancing test requires a court to consider the following factors: \n \n[1] the type of record requested, [2] the information it does or might contain, [3] the potential for \nharm  in  any  subsequent  nonconsensual  disclosure,  [4]  the  injury  from  disclosure  to  the \nrelationship  in  which  the  record  was  generated,  [5]  the  adequacy  of  safeguards  to  prevent \nunauthorized disclosure, [6] the degree of need for access, and [7] whether there is an express \n105 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 106 of 142\nappropriate  to  examine  the  constitutionality  of  the  School  District’s  practice  because  the \ndisclosure of private information in a record is not at issue here. \n  As such, the court must determine, to the extent that the defendants’ practice infringes \nupon the plaintiffs’ privacy rights regarding the involuntary exposure of the intimate parts of the \nbody (or even the possible disclosure of their partially clothed bodies), whether the infringement \nis narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.  Reno, 507 U.S. at 302.  The court finds \nthat it is.  More specifically, the defendants have a compelling state interest not to discriminate \nagainst transgender students.  Even with the revocation of the guidance that initiated the School \nDistrict  to  change  its  practice  for  the  2016-17  school  year,  there  have  been  recent  cases \ndetermining that School Districts have violated the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX by \nprecluding transgender students from using the restrooms.  See, e.g., Whitaker by Whitaker v. \nKenosha Unified School Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034 (7th Cir. 2017) (Title IX) and \nEvancho v. Pine-Richland School District, No. CIV. A. 2:16-1537, 2017 WL 770619 (W.D. Pa. \nFeb. 27, 2017) (Equal Protection Clause).  While there have been other cases deciding to the \ncontrary, see, e.g., Johnston v. University of Pittsburgh of Commonwealth System of Higher \nEducation, 97 F. Supp. 3d 657, 678 (W.D. Pa. 2015) (determining transgender university student \nfailed to state claim that university discriminated against him in violation of Title IX and the \nEqual Protection Clause when it refused to allow him to use sex-segregated bathrooms and \n                                                                                                                                                             \nstatutory mandate, articulated public policy, or other recognizable public interest militating toward \naccess. \n \nDoe, 660 F.3d at 178 (citations omitted).  In addition, all of the cases the Third Circuit cites to concerning the \nflexible balancing test involve disclosure of documents.  See C.N. v. Ridgewood Bd. of Educ., 430 F.3d 159 (3d Cir. \n2005) (involving school district administering a survey about the personal lives of students in seventh through \ntwelfth grade, which included, inter alia, the students’ drug and alcohol use, sexual activity, and attempts at \nsuicide); Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge No. 5 v. City of Philadelphia, 812 F.2d 104 (3d Cir. 1987) (involving \nchallenge to questionnaire Philadelphia Police Department used to select applicants for its special investigations unit \nbecause questionnaire sought information about, inter alia, applicants’ gambling habits, alcohol consumption, and \nfamily’s financial status); United States v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 638 F.2d 570 (3d Cir. 1980) (involving a \nsubpoena directing an employer to produce medical records of employees that had been working in a hazardous \narea). \n106 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 107 of 142\nlocker rooms designated for men), this does not mean that the School District does not have a \ncompelling state interest in not discriminating against transgender students with regard to the use \nof privacy facilities at BASH. \n  As for whether the practice is narrowly tailored, the School District’s practice is narrowly \ntailored because the School District, inter alia, (1) does not coerce students to use the multi-user \nbathrooms and locker rooms, (2) requires students seeking to use the facilities corresponding to \ntheir gender identity to first consult with the counselor and administration and receive permission \nbefore gaining access, (3) provides privacy protections in the nature of areas in the locker rooms \nand bathrooms where students can go if those students are uncomfortable seeing or being seen by \ntransgender  students,  and  (4)  provides  alternative  single-user  facilities  that  would  provide \nuncomfortable students with complete privacy and security for changing or taking care of bodily \nneeds.  The School District has attempted to provide transgender students with the opportunity to \nlive their lives in a manner consistent with their gender identity, while attempting to minimize as \nmuch as possible any discomfort felt by other students by offering various forms of privacy \nprotection  and  alternative  arrangements  for  their  use  if  they  feel  uncomfortable  or  need \nadditional privacy. \n  Accordingly, the court finds that the plaintiffs have failed to establish that they are likely \nto  succeed  on  the  merits  of  their  section  1983  action  for  invasion  of  privacy  against  the \ndefendants. \n2.  Title IX \n \na.  Summary of the Parties’ Arguments \nFor their second claim, the plaintiffs contend that the defendants’ practice of allowing \ntransgender students to use the privacy facilities corresponding to their gender identity violates \n107 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 108 of 142\nTitle IX “by no longer having locker rooms, showers, and restroom [sic] separated on the basis \nof sex, because allowing biological girls into boys’ facilities and biological boys into girls’ \nfacilities creates a hostile environment on the basis of sex.”  Pls.’ Mem. at 27.  They argue that \nTitle IX, as illustrated by the February 2017 Dear Colleague Letter, pertains to discrimination by \n“sex,” “a term we have long understood to refer to our biological sex and reproductive nature.”  \nId. at 28.  Thus, Title IX preserves distinct privacy facilities on the basis of sex and not on \ntheories of gender identity.  Id. at 27-30. \n  With regard to hostile environment sexual harassment, the plaintiffs assert that simply by \nallowing  transgender  students  into  the  locker  rooms  of  the  opposite  biological  sex,  the \ndefendants have created a hostile environment for the cisgender students.  Id. at 30.  They point \nout that the EEOC Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment shows that the \nEEOC believes that “‘displays of “girlie” pictures [] and other offensive conduct can constitute a \nhostile work environment even if many people deem it to be harmless or insignificant.’” Id. \n(citing  https://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/currentissues.html).    They  argue  that  if  the  EEOC \nwould  find  a  pin-up  girl  to  be  sufficient  to  establish  sexual  harassment,  then  placing  a \ntransgender boy (who they again describe as a female) in the male locker room is as much or \nmore significantly offensive.  Id.  The plaintiffs also point out that a number of cases have found \nthat the intrusion upon a locker room by a member of the opposite sex constitutes sexual \nharassment and a hostile environment.  Id. at 31-32 (citing cases).   \n  The plaintiffs further assert that the harassment is based on sex.  The School District’s \npolicy causes the harassment because the School District allows students to use the privacy \nfacility of the opposite biological sex.57  The plaintiffs also note that the female plaintiffs have an \n                                                 \n57 The plaintiffs claim that Dr. Foley “seemed to understand the shocking nature of what he was asking Joel Doe and \nthe other students visiting him to do when he told them to make using the locker room with a biological girl wearing \n108 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 109 of 142\nadditional issue because of having to deal with menstruation issues, and “[a]ttending to these \nneeds with males present is humiliating.”  Id. at 34.  The plaintiffs also point out that the School \nDistrict’s policy puts the female plaintiffs at risk since females are more likely to be victims of \nsexual assault and (1) males can now enter the female privacy facilities with lewd intentions but \nunder the guise that they are identifying as female, (2) the female plaintiffs cannot question the \npresence of a biological male in their restrooms and locker rooms now, and (3) there is no \nmethod of excluding males with lewd intentions “until after the damage is done.” Id.  All of this \ncauses the plaintiffs to feel “vulnerable and violated” because of their sex.  Id. \n  Finally,  the  plaintiffs  argue  that  the  harassment  at  issue  is  severe,  pervasive,  and \nobjectively offensive.  Id. at 35.  The plaintiffs assert that the evidence shows that they satisfy the \n“subjective” first prong of a hostile environment claim because they suffer humiliation, fear, \nanxiety, stress, and dignity loss with the current School District policy, and they fear being faced \nwith similar situations in the future.  Id.  As for the objective prong, the plaintiffs contend as \nfollows:  (1) the situation is “severe” because they recognize that to use the multi-user rooms at \nBASH they must be prepared to see or have members of the opposite sex enter the room; (2) the \nplaintiffs’ situation is pervasive because the practice sanctions the harassing activity and it is \nongoing; (3) the School District’s practice is humiliating and threatening because they either \nneed to give up the right to use facilities designed for them or face the possibility of being \nconfronted with someone of the opposite sex in that facility; and (4) the practice undermines \ntheir educational experience because it effectively denies them access to the multi-user facilities \n                                                                                                                                                             \na bra as natural as possible.”  Pls.’ Mem. at 33.  While Dr. Foley’s discussion with Joel Doe and the other male \nstudents was somewhat puzzling, especially insofar as he stated that he was investigating whether Student A could \nbe in the locker room when he was already aware of the School District’s policy that would have allowed Student A \nin the locker room, there is no indication that he found Student A being in the locker room to be “shocking.”  \nInstead, a fairer interpretation of what happened was that Dr. Foley understood that this practice was new and not \nsomething that the boys had experienced in the past.  He was encouraging them to adjust to having Student A in the \nlocker room with them, in part for Student A’s wellbeing.  Obviously, Joel Doe did not feel comfortable with \nStudent A being in the locker room with him. \n109 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 110 of 142\nunless they want to be in a harassing environment.  Pls.’ Findings and Conclusions at pp. 47-48, \n¶¶ 74-76, 79.  They further contend that the defendants have been deliberately indifferent to the \nsexual harassment through the use of the unlawful practice.  Id. at p. 48, ¶ 80.  \n  In response to the plaintiffs’ arguments, the defendants contend that the plaintiffs have \nfailed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of their Title IX claim because (1) they \nhave failed to show that the harassment was on the basis of sex insofar as the School District’s \npolicy applies to both the boys’ and girls’ privacy facilities and Title IX does not define the term \n“sex” or mandate how a school district is supposed to determine who is male and female \nregarding sex-segregated facilities, (2) they have failed to show that the defendants’ purportedly \nharassing conduct is pervasive insofar as one plaintiff did not testify about any instance where \nshe encountered a transgender student in a privacy facility and the other three plaintiffs each \ntestified to only one such instance, and (3) they have failed to satisfy the subjective prong of a \nhostile environment claim because they have only referenced generalized fear and humiliation    \nDefs.’ Mem. at 15-17.  The defendants also assert that the risk of humiliation or harassment is \nminimized for future instances because of the privacy protections in place and the alternative \nfacilities available to all students at BASH.  Id. at 17. \n  The defendants further claim that the mere presence of transgender students in restrooms \nand locker rooms is not severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive.  Id.  In this regard, the \ndefendants contend that Title IX does not prohibit the sharing of restroom facilities; instead, it \nmerely states that they can create single-sex locker rooms and bathrooms for males and females \nso long as the facilities are comparable.  Id. (citing 34 C.F.R. § 106.33).  As long as the School \nDistrict provides privacy protection for all students, the defendants believe that they cannot \nviolate Title IX.  Id. at 17-18. \n110 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 111 of 142\n  PYC asserts arguments similar to the defendants in support of their overall contention \nthat the plaintiffs have failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits of their Title IX \nclaim.  PYC argues that the plaintiffs have failed to establish that the transgender students’ use of \nthe shared privacy facilities is severe, pervasive, or objectively offensive.  PYC points to the \ndecision in Students in support of the proposition that the mere presence of transgender students \nin a locker room or bathroom corresponding to their gender identity “‘does not rise to the level of \nconduct that has been found to be objectively offensive, and therefore hostile, in other cases.’” \nPYC Mem. at 11 (quoting Students, 2016 WL 6134121, at *32, and other cases).  PYC also \nasserts that the plaintiffs mischaracterize the cases they cite in support of the proposition that the \nmere presence of a person of the opposite sex (PYC objects to the plaintiffs’ characterization of \ntransgender students as members of the opposite sex) constitutes a hostile environment under \nTitle IX.  Id. at 12-13 (discussing cases cited by plaintiffs). \n  PYC goes on to argue that even if the plaintiffs were to persuade the court that the \npresence of a transgender student in a locker room or bathroom, without more, is objectively \noffensive, the plaintiffs’ claim still lacks a likelihood of success on the merits because they have \nnot shown that they were targeted on the basis of sex.  Id. at 13-14.  More specifically, the \nSchool District’s policy targets all students, so the discomfort Joel Doe or Jack Jones feels is not \nbecause of their male sex and the discomfort Mary Smith or Macy Roe feels is not because of \ntheir female sex.  Id. \n  As its final  point, PYC points to Whitaker by  Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified School \nDistrict No. 1 Board of Education, 858 F.3d 1034 (7th Cir. 2017) in support of its claim that the \nplaintiffs’ argument would “turn[] Title IX on its head.” Id. at 14.  PYC notes that the Seventh \nCircuit  in  Whitaker  “joined  every  other  federal  appellate  court  that  has  considered  sex \n111 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 112 of 142\ndiscrimination claims brought by transgender people after Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 \nU.S. 228 (1989), to affirm that laws prohibiting sex discrimination do not exclude transgender \npeople from their protections.”  Id.  Moreover, Whitaker determined that a public school’s policy \nrequiring individuals to use bathrooms that do not confirm the individual’s gender identity \ndiscriminates against the individual because of the individual’s gender non-conformity, which \nviolates Title IX.  Id. (citing Whitaker). \nb.  Analysis \n  Title IX provides in pertinent part that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the \nbasis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to \ndiscrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance[.]” \n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).58  “[A] public school student may bring suit against a school under Title IX \nfor so-called ‘hostile environment’ harassment.”59 Saxe v. State Coll. Area Sch. Dist., 240 F.3d \n200, 205 (3d Cir. 2001) (citing Davis v. Monroe Cty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629 (1999); \nFranklin v. Gwinnett Cty. Pub. Sch., 503 U.S. 60, 74-75 (1992)).  To prevail in a Title IX sexual \nharassment claim, \na plaintiff must establish sexual harassment of students that is so \nsevere,  pervasive,  and  objectively  offensive,  and  that  so \nundermines and detracts from the victims’ educational experience, \nthat the victim students are effectively denied equal access to an \ninstitution’s resources and opportunities. \n                                                 \n58 This matter involves an “education program or activity” under § 1681(a).  See 20 U.S.C § 1687 (stating that “the \nterm ‘program or activity’ and ‘program’ mean all of the operations of-- . . . (2) . . . (B) a local educational agency . . \n., system of vocational education, or other school system” (emphasis added)); see also Evancho v. Pine-Richland \nSch. Dist., No. CIV. A. 2:16-1537, 2017 WL 770619, at *18 (W.D. Pa. Feb. 27, 2017) (“No party appears to contest \nthat Title IX applies to the [school district] and its decisions about its educational programs. . . . As other courts have \nconcluded, the use by students of school restrooms is part and parcel of the provision of educational services \ncovered by Title IX, and neither party takes issue with that.” (citation omitted)).  In addition, it appears at this stage \nthat the plaintiffs will be able to show that the School District receives “Federal financial assistance.” \n59 The Third Circuit has explained that although Title IX claims against schools were originally limited to “cases \ninvolving harassment of a student by a teacher or other agent of the school,” “[t]he Supreme Court has extended an \nanalogous cause of action to students [for student-on-student sexual harassment] under Title IX.”  Saxe, 240 F.3d at \n205 (citation omitted). \n112 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 113 of 142\n \n[Davis, 526 U.S. at 651], 119 S.Ct. 1661.  This determination “‘depends on a \nconstellation  of  surrounding  circumstances,  expectations,  and  relationships,’ \nincluding, but not limited to, the ages of the harasser and the victim, and the \nnumber of individuals involved.” Id. (quoting Oncale [v. Sundowner Offshore \nServs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 82 (1998)).]  The Court stressed that “[d]amages are not \navailable for simple acts of teasing and name-calling among school children, even \nwhere these comments target differences in gender.” Id. at 652, 119 S.Ct. 1661.  \nRather, private damages actions against the school are limited to cases in which \nthe school “acts with deliberate indifference to known acts of harassment,” and \nthose acts have “a systemic effect on educational programs and activities.” Id. at \n633, 653, 119 S.Ct. 1661. \n \nId. at 205-06 (third alteration in original) (footnote omitted). \n  Although there have been a number of cases brought by transgender students claiming \nthat school districts violate Title IX by maintaining separate privacy facilities based on biological \nsex and refusing to permit the transgender students to use the privacy facility corresponding to \nthe student’s gender identity, Students is the only case similar to the instant case where cisgender \nstudents (and their parents) have sued a school district based in part on a Title IX sexual \nharassment hostile environment claim.  In Students, Magistrate Judge Gilbert determined that the \nplaintiffs did not have a likelihood of success on the merits with respect to their Title IX sexual \nharassment hostile environment claim.  2016 WL 6134121, at *30-36.  The court again finds \npersuasive much of the rationale set forth by Magistrate Judge Gilbert in determining that the \nplaintiffs did not establish a likelihood of success on the merits of their Title IX claim. \n  In the first instance, as in Students, this court finds that the plaintiffs have failed to \ndemonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits because they have not met the “threshold \nquestion,” i.e. that they have suffered discrimination “on the basis of sex.”  Id. at *31; see 20 \nU.S.C. § 1681(a).  As noted by the defendants and PYC, the School District treats all students at \nschool similarly.  Under the current practice, the plaintiffs (and the other students at BASH) are \nnot targeted on the basis of their sex because the School District treats both male and female \n113 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 114 of 142\nstudents similarly.  The practice applies to both the boys’ and girls’ locker rooms and bathrooms, \nmeaning that cisgender boys potentially may use the boys’ locker room and bathrooms with \ntransgender boys and cisgender girls potentially may use the girls’ locker room and bathrooms \nwith transgender girls.  In addition, with regard to the transgender students, both transgender \nboys and transgender girls are treated similarly insofar as they, upon receiving permission from \nthe School District, may use the locker rooms and bathrooms corresponding with their gender \nidentity.  Moreover, the School District is not discriminating against students regarding the use \nof alternative facilities if students are uncomfortable with the current practice insofar as those \nfacilities are open to all students who may be uncomfortable using the locker rooms or multi-user \nfacilities at BASH. The School District’s similar treatment of all students is fatal to the plaintiffs’ \nTitle IX claim.  See Moeck v. Pleasant Valley Sch. Dist., 179 F. Supp. 3d 442, 448 (M.D. Pa. \n2016)  (concluding  that  plaintiff  failed  to  support  sexual  harassment  hostile  educational \nenvironment action where even though “the  actions of the coaching staff were vulgar and \ninappropriate,” “[t]he record establishes that the coaching staff were not discriminatory—they \n‘harassed’ everyone on the team, male and female.  They did not harass because of sex but \nrather, harassed everyone regardless of their sex. . . . The coaches treated [the plaintiff] like \neveryone else, poorly and immaturely”); see also Pasqua v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 101 F.3d \n514, 517 (7th Cir. 1996) (“Harassment that is inflicted without regard to gender, that is, where \nmales and females in the same setting do not receive disparate treatment, is not actionable \nbecause the harassment is not based on sex.”); Henson v. City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 904 \n(11th Cir. 1982) (explaining that in the Title VII context that “there may be cases in which a \nsupervisor makes sexual overtures of both sexes or where the conduct complained of is equally \noffensive to male and female workers.  In such cases, sexual harassment would not be based on \n114 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 115 of 142\nsex because men and women are accorded like treatment . . . [and] the plaintiff would have no \nremedy under Title VII”); Connell v. Principi, No. CIV. A. 04-1356, 2007 WL 3274185, at *11-\n15 (W.D. Pa. Nov. 5, 2007) (concluding that plaintiff employee could not maintain sexual \nharassment  hostile  work  environment  claim  because  “the  record  evidence  shows  that  [the \nallegedly harassing supervisor’s] offensive and harassing conduct was either directed at both \nmen and women or lacked the necessary gender based discriminatory animus”).60 \n  The plaintiffs have failed to cite to any case holding that a plaintiff can maintain a sexual \nharassment hostile environment claim when the allegedly sexually harassing party treats all \nindividuals similarly and there is, as such, no evidence of gender/sex animus.  Simply because \nthe plaintiffs feel a particular way which they equate to their sex does not take away from the \nfact that the School District’s practice is not targeting any group or individual because of their \nsex.  Even if the court were to find that that the practice is based on sex, the plaintiffs ignore that \nTitle IX deals with “discrimination” based on sex and there can be no discrimination when \neveryone is treated the same.61 \n                                                 \n60 The cases addressing claims brought under Title VII are strongly persuasive insofar as the Third Circuit has noted \nthat Title IX sexual harassment hostile environment claims are “analogous” to similar claims under Title VII.  See \nSaxe, 240 F.3d at 205 (describing Title VII hostile environment sexual harassment claim and explaining that “[t]he \nSupreme Court has extended an analogous cause of action to students under Title IX”). \n61 The court is compelled to address a few of the plaintiffs’ additional arguments in support of the belief that the \ndefendants discriminated on the basis of sex insofar as these arguments are somewhat overstated.  These statements \nare (1) the female plaintiffs are concerned about males entering the girls’ privacy facilities for lewd purposes, (2) the \nfemale plaintiffs cannot even question the presence of a biological male in their locker room, and (3) there are no \nmethods for excluding males who have lewd intentions until after the damage is done.  Pls.’ Mem. at 34.  The court \naddresses this latter point first.  Even in sex-segregated restrooms, the School District does not have a method of \nexcluding males who have lewd intentions until after the damage is done.  There is no evidence in the record that a \npolice officer or gatekeeper is patrolling the students’ privacy facilities and even if teachers or other school \nemployees are near these areas, there is simply nothing stopping someone with truly lewd intentions from entering \nthe privacy facilities.  The School District’s pre-2016-17 practice regarding the restrooms and locker rooms was \ndependent on the students following the rules and, if they did not, the School District using its surveillance systems \nand other tools of investigation to catch the perpetrators of any rule violations (all of which occur after the \nviolation).  At bottom, there is nothing to physically stop an individual with bad intentions no matter how the School \nDistrict assigns bathroom and locker room usage. \n  Secondly, as for a purported inability of a female student to question the presence of a “male” student in the \nlocker room or bathroom, all of the plaintiffs testified that they had no basis of knowing whether someone was \ndesignated a male or female at birth simply by looking at them.  Their knowledge about the purported biological sex \n115 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 116 of 142\n  Presuming the plaintiffs were able to maintain this claim because they could show that \nthe School District discriminated against them on the basis of their sex, the plaintiffs have still \nfailed to show a likelihood of success on the merits of their Title IX claim because they have not \nshown that they can establish the elements of a hostile environment claim.  In the first instance, \nwhile the court has some doubts as to the level and reasonableness of the humiliation, fear, \nanxiety, stress, and dignity loss caused by the School District’s practice, the court will presume \nfor purposes of this opinion that the plaintiffs have shown that they subjectively viewed the \nSchool District’s practice as harassment.62  The plaintiffs have nonetheless failed to show that \nthey are likely to demonstrate that the School District’s practice is so severe, pervasive, and \nobjectively offensive that it undermined and detracted from their educational experience. \n                                                                                                                                                             \nof Students A and B were based on having known the students for a period of time and their belief that the student \nwas a girl or boy based on that prior knowledge but without any particular knowledge of the transgender student’s \nanatomy.  In addition, and as an example, Mary Smith will accept someone that looks like a stereotypical boy in the \nlocker room or bathroom with her as long as that person has a female external and internal reproductive system.  The \ncourt finds it more than reasonable to infer from her testimony that if she saw someone that she perceived to be a \nboy (but who was assigned female at birth), Mary Smith would have reacted the same way when she fled the 700s \nbathroom upon seeing Student B. Regardless, there is nothing in the record supporting the plaintiffs’ statement that \nMary Smith (or any other student at BASH) would not be able to go to school administration to report the presence \nof someone they perceive to be of the opposite biological sex as it is still the School District’s policy that only \nstudents who receive permission to use the locker room and/or bathroom corresponding to their gender identity are \npermitted in those areas. \n  As the final point, the plaintiffs use the fear of sexual assault as a basis to justify the continued separation \nof privacy facilities on the basis of biological sex and they cite to statistics by the Centers for Disease Control \nshowing that nearly 12% of high school girls reported having been sexually assaulted.  Pls.’ Mem. at 34 (citing \nCenters for Disease Control, Sexual Violence: Facts at a Glance (2012), \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/sv-datasheet-a.pdf).  While is it highly alarming and troubling to know \nthat such a high percentage of high school female students have reported being the victim of sexual assault, \nconsidering that the percentage does not reflect those students who do not report being assaulted, the plaintiffs \nprovide no statistics as to how many of those sexual assaults have occurred in a locker room or bathroom at a school \nor how many of those sexual assaults have occurred in locker rooms and bathrooms in public places or schools that \nhave decided to permit bathroom and locker room usage on the basis of gender identity.  There is no evidence of any \nsuch horrendous misconduct occurring at BASH since the School District changed the policy there and the fear of \nharm is purely speculative. \n62 The facts of this case differ from Students because the court there noted that “[n]owhere . . . do Plaintiffs allege \nthat they ever have seen Student A undressed or that Student A has seen any Girl Plaintiff undressed or that Student \nA has seen any Girl Plaintiff undressed if that Student Plaintiff wanted not to be seen in that state.”  2016 WL \n6134141 at *31.  Here, both Joel Doe and Jack Jones claim that they saw Student A in a bra (which appears to have \nbeen a sports bra) and, at the time, they were both in their underwear.  While there is conflicting information about \nwhether Student A saw the male plaintiffs in their underwear, the evidence in this matter seemingly goes beyond \n“[g]eneralized statements of fear and humiliation.”  Id. at *32 (citing cases in support of proposition that “[g]eneral \nallegations have been held to be insufficient to establish a Title IX violation”). \n116 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 117 of 142\n  The “objective prong” of the hostile environment inquiry “must be evaluated by looking \nat  the  totality  of  the  circumstances[]  [which]  .  .  .  may  include  .  .  .  the  frequency  of  the \ndiscriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere \noffensive utterance; and whether it [so undermines and detracts from the victims’ educational \nexperience, that [he or she is] effectively denied equal access to an institution’s resources and \nopportunities].”  Saxe, 240 F.3d at 205 (citations omitted and internal quotation marks omitted) \n(alterations to original).  Regarding the frequency of the allegedly discriminatory conduct in this \ncase, each plaintiff testified as to a single instance in which they viewed a transgender student in \na locker room or bathroom.  Mary Smith saw Student B in the 700s bathroom common area \nwhile both of them were clothed and it is unclear if Student B even saw Mary Smith before she \nexited the bathroom.  Joel Doe and Jack Jones saw Student A in the locker room while they were \nin their underwear and while she was in shorts and a sports bra.  To the best of her knowledge, \nMacy Roe never saw any transgender student in a bathroom or locker room before she graduated.  \nBased on their testimony, none of these plaintiffs were subjected to pervasive sexual harassment \nin regard to their actual interaction with transgender students in the privacy facilities at BASH. \n  Nonetheless,  the  plaintiffs  point  to  the  impact  of  the  School  District’s  practice  as \nestablishing pervasive conduct because the practice permits transgender students who receive \npermission from the School District to use the privacy facilities corresponding to their gender \nidentity.  As a result of this practice Joel Doe has ceased using the locker room to change for \ngym class, has ceased changing for gym class, and uses the restrooms less frequently than he had \npreviously.  It does not appear that the other three plaintiffs have changed their usage of the \nlocker room (except to the extent that Jack Jones indicated that he would conduct locker-room-\nwide searches for “girls” each time that he would change for gym class), but they all testified that \n117 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 118 of 142\ntheir bathroom usage significantly diminished and, when they did use the multi-user bathrooms, \nthey were uncomfortable and concerned about the potential presence of a transgender student.  \nThe plaintiffs have not cited to any case stating that the mere possibility of future exposure to the \nalleged harassment can render a single instance of harassment pervasive. \n  To the extent that the court could find that the School District’s practice constituted \npervasive harassment of the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs have still failed to show that it is likely that \nsuch harassment was severe or objectively offensive.63  Essentially, the plaintiffs’ position is that \nthe presence of “members of the opposite sex,” meaning transgender students, creates a hostile \nenvironment for the plaintiffs and other cisgender students at BASH.  Although the plaintiffs cite \na number of cases to support their position that having members of the opposite sex in a privacy \nfacility creates a hostile environment, none of the cited cases are applicable here.  The first case \ncited by the plaintiffs is Lewis v. Triborough Bridge & Tunnel Authority, 31 F. App’x 746 (2d \nCir.  2002),  an  unpublished  Second  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals  decision,  because  the  court \npurportedly held that an employer created a hostile work environment when it allowed a third-\nparty cleaning company to have its male employees inside of the locker room while the female \nemployee plaintiffs were undressed.  Pls.’ Mem. at 31.  Lewis is easily distinguishable from the \nfacts of this case insofar as (1) the female plaintiffs complained to their employer for two years \n                                                 \n63 The parties debate whether the plaintiffs have to establish whether the harassment is “severe and pervasive” or \n“severe or pervasive.”  Compare Pls.’ Mem. at 36 (“Conduct need not be both severe and pervasive.” (emphasis in \noriginal)), with PYC Mem. at 11 n.6 (“In the Title IX context . . . student-on-student sexual harassment can be \nactionable only if it is severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive.” (emphasis in original)).  PYC is correct that \nwhen the Third Circuit set forth the elements of a hostile environment claim, the court did not use the disjunctive \n“or” when referencing the requirements that the conduct be severe and pervasive.  See Saxe, 240 F.3d at 205 (stating \nthat the harassment must be “so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive”).  Interestingly, while the plain \nlanguage used in Saxe appears to contemplate a plaintiff needing to show that the harassment was severe and \npervasive, the Third Circuit has also used the disjunctive when referencing this standard.  See DeJohn v. Temple \nUniv., 537 F.3d 301, 320 (3d Cir. 2008) (“[U]nless harassment is qualified with a standard akin to a severe or \npervasive requirement, a harassment policy may suppress core protected speech.” (emphasis added)).  Also, in the \nTitle VII context, a plaintiff can establish a hostile work environment by showing harassing behavior “sufficiently \nsevere or pervasive to alter the conditions of [the plaintiff’s] employment.” Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 \nU.S. 57, 67 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Here, the court need not resolve this issue because, as \nexplained herein, the practice was not objectively offensive. \n118 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 119 of 142\nabout the sexual harassment by the male cleaners, and (2) they alleged that the male cleaners \n“engaged in a variety of specific acts of sexual harassment, including entering the  . . . women’s \nlocker room when female employees were undressed.”  31 F. App’x at 747.  Further, the “variety \nof  specific  acts  of  sexual  harassment”  not  mentioned  in  the Second Circuit’s opinion also \nincluded allegations from one of the female plaintiffs that the male cleaners were “leering at her \nand would crowd the entrance to the locker room, forcing her to ‘run the gauntlet’ and brush up \nagainst them.” Lewis v. Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Auth., 77 F. Supp. 2d 376, 377 (S.D.N.Y. \n1999).  Additionally, the general manager of the plaintiffs’ employer, during an inspection of the \nwomen’s  locker  room,  also  referred  to  other  female  employees  as  “cunts”  and  “fucking \ncrybabies” and reportedly stated “‘[b]oss man don’t want no women with tiny hinnies [sic] on \nthis job.’” Id. at 378 (alteration and mistakes in original).   This conduct is not similar to the facts \nin this case. \n  The second case cited is Schonauer v. DCR Entertainment, Inc., 905 P.2d 392 (Wash. Ct. \nApp. 1995), which the plaintiffs reference to support the proposition that a hostile environment is \ncreated when a male employer at a nude dance club entered a dressing room while a female \nwaitress was clothed and in a dressing room and restroom.  Pls.’ Mem. at 31.  Once again, the \nplaintiffs focus on one aspect of the case and ignore the totality of the plaintiff’s evidence as to \nthe  purported  hostile  environment.    In  Schonauer,  the  plaintiff  alleged  that  (1)  during  the \napproximately one month that she worked at the topless nightclub, a manager regularly and \nalmost daily entered the women’s bathroom/locker/dressing room area, even on one occasion \nwhen  the  plaintiff  was  inside  of  a  restroom  stall,  and  this  conduct  made  her  “extremely \nuncomfortable;”  (2)  she  refused  to  participate  in  the  club’s  nude  waitress  contest;  (3)  in \npreparation for the contest, the manager told the plaintiff to fill out a card that asked about \n119 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 120 of 142\nvarious sexual information that would have been broadcast to the audience during the contest; (4) \nwhile attempting to persuade the plaintiff to enter the contest, the manager placed his arm around \nher and told her that he needed her to enter the contest; and (5) the manager and another male \nemployee at the club tried to get the plaintiff to enter the contest (even telling her that she had to \nenter it) on three occasions before eventually firing her in part because she did not enter the \ncontest.  905 P.2d at 813-15.  The court concluded that the plaintiff set forth enough facts to \nestablish a claim for a hostile work environment insofar as, inter alia, (1) she was hired as a \nwaitress and not as a dancer, (2) she wanted to be a waitress and not a dancer and informed her \nemployer and management as such, and (3) the manager and the other employee “pressured her, \nrepeatedly and intentionally, to provide fantasized sexual information and to dance on stage in \nsexually provocative ways.  Id. at 822.  Regarding the manager’s intrusions into the dressing \nroom and bathroom, the court stated that “the hostile and offensive nature of th[e] environment \n[at the club] was arguably intensified by [the manager’s] intrusions into the women’s dressing \nroom and bathroom.”  Id.  Thus, the allegations of sexual harassment went well beyond the \nmanager’s presence in the dressing room and bathroom. \n  The third case cited is Washington v. White, 231 F. Supp. 2d 71 (D.D.C. 2002), for the \nproposition that individuals of the opposite sex entering a locker room can create a hostile work \nenvironment.  Pls.’ Mem. at 31-32.  The plaintiff in White alleged that he was a custodial worker \nat the Walter Reed Army Medical Center and would go into a men’s locker room to remove his \nuniform and change into his street clothes at the conclusion of his shift.  231 F. Supp. 2d at 73.  \nThe plaintiff alleged that a female supervisor (it is unclear if she was the plaintiff’s supervisor), \nin violation of the employer’s written policy, entered the men’s locker room on five to ten \noccasions without knocking.  Id. at 73, 74.  On one occasion when she came in, the plaintiff was \n120 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 121 of 142\ntaking off his shirt.  Id. at 73.  After the plaintiff complained to his supervisor and another \nmember of management and filed a written complaint, the female supervisor “entered the locker \nroom, went over to plaintiff, and (without asking) reached in and took a pen out of his shirt \npocket.”  Id.  The plaintiff again complained and the female supervisor received a written \nwarning.  Id.  Apparently, the female supervisor was undeterred as she “‘returned to the locker \nroom and stood over [plaintiff] saying “I’m back.  What are you going to do about it?’” Id. \n(citation omitted). \n  The  plaintiff  claimed  that  the  female  supervisor’s  conduct  caused  him  to  become \n“embarrassed and uncomfortable” and, as a result, he would change in bathrooms and vacant \nareas on other floors.  Id. at 73.  The court found that the plaintiff had set forth sufficient \nevidence “to establish that [the female supervisor’s] conduct turned his work place into a hostile \nwork environment and the court could not grant summary judgment in favor of the defendant.  \nId. at 80-81.  Again, there are no allegations of improper conduct by the transgender students \nwhile in the locker room or bathroom.  As such, White is inapplicable. \n  The fourth case cited is People v. Grunau, No. H015871, 2009 WL 5149857 (Cal. Ct. \nApp. Dec. 29, 2009), for the proposition that girls should expect privacy in a girls’ locker room \nand that a biological male staring at a girl in a locker room would shock or disturb the viewed-\nupon girl.  Pls.’ Mem. at 32.  This matter involved a criminal defendant charged with loitering on \nschool grounds and violating a California law prohibiting individuals from annoying a child \nunder 18.  Grunau, 2009 WL 51498457 at *1.  The victim, a 14-year-old girl who was wearing \nher swimsuit after swimming practice, was showering in the girls’ locker room when she saw the \ndefendant standing in the exit doorway.  Id.  The defendant “made eye contact with [the victim], \nstared for about five seconds, closed the door, and left.”  Id. \n121 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 122 of 142\n  On appeal from the jury’s verdict convicting the defendant, the defendant claimed that \n“briefly viewing a teenager showering in a full swim suit is not conduct which would cause the \naverage person to be unhesitatingly irritated or offended, and [sic] essential element of the \ncrime.” Id. at *3 (mistake in original).  In concluding that the evidence was sufficient to convict \nthe defendant, the California appellate court explained: \nHere, defendant blithely ignores an important fact: where his conduct took place. \n[The victim] was not simply rinsing off under an outdoor shower at a public pool.  \nShe was on a high school campus, out of general public view, and inside a girls’ \nlocker room, a place that by definition is to be used exclusively by girls and where \nmales are not allowed.  Unquestionably, a girls[’] locker room is a place where a \nnormal female should, and would, reasonably expect privacy, especially when she \nis  performing  quintessentially  personal  activities  like  undressing,  changing \nclothes, and bathing.  Under the circumstances, jurors reasonably could find that a \nnormal female who was showering in a girls[’] locker room would unhesitatingly \nbe shocked, irritated, and disturbed to see a man gazing at her, no matter how \nbriefly he did so. \n \nId. (alterations to original). \n  Grunau is also inapplicable because even though the court discussed that girls would \nexpect privacy in a girls’ locker room, Grunau involved an adult man who was actually leering \nat a 14-year-old girl while she was in a locker room.64  It is inconceivable how this case sheds \nlight on a transgender student being present in the locker room, especially here where there are \nno allegations of any transgender student at BASH staring at another student (and, the court \nwould be remiss if it was not pointed out that the defendant in Grunau had been convicted of \nprior sex offenses) or doing anything remotely improper.  Instead, the only testimony relating to \nthe transgender students is that they were in either the locker room or the bathroom with the \nplaintiffs. \n                                                 \n64 To reinforce a point made earlier in this opinion, apparently the sex-segregated bathrooms and locker rooms were \nunable to prevent the defendant from entering them in the first place. \n122 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 123 of 142\n  The final case referenced by the plaintiffs is Norwood v. Dale Maintenance System, Inc., \n590 F. Supp. 1410 (N.D. Ill. 1984) because it supposedly supports their position that a hostile \nenvironment is created by simply allowing a member of the opposite sex into a restroom.  Pls.’ \nMem. at 32.  Norwood is clearly inapplicable here.65  In this regard, Norwood involved a female \nemployee’s complaint that her employer violated Title VII when it refused to hire her to work as \na day shift washroom attendant in a men’s washroom.  590 F. Supp. at 1412-14.  The employer \nclaimed  that  it  could  base  the  decision  on  sex  because  it  was  a  bona  fide  occupational \nqualification.  Id. at 1415.  The court concluded that since the employer produced sufficient \nevidence that the occupants of the building in which the washroom was located “would object to \na member of the opposite sex entering their washrooms during the day to perform cleaning \nduties, and that if such a procedure were instituted the procedure would have a detrimental effect \non the building.”  Id. at 1417.  Thus, the court concluded “that the intrusion on personal privacy \nwhich would occur if opposite sex attendants were allowed access into the washrooms while in \nuse is sufficiently substantial so as to constitute a factual basis for defendants[’] sex-based \npolicy.”  Id. \n  Norwood does not involve a claim for hostile environment under Title IX.  While it, and \nother cases throughout the United States have found bona fide occupational qualifications on the \n                                                 \n65 The court notes that two of the plaintiffs’ four citations to Norwood are actually not to statements by the court; \ninstead, the court was summarizing the testimony of the employer’s expert witness.  Compare Pls.’ Mem. at 32 \n(citing to Norwood, 590 F. Supp. at 1417), with Norwood, 590 F. Supp. at 1417 (explaining testimony of employer’s \nexpert in which he concluded that having opposite sex members in the washrooms “would cause embarrassment and \nincreased stress in both male and female washroom users” and “the invasion of privacy that would be created by an \nopposite sex procedure would be extreme”).  Similarly, the plaintiffs’ reference page 1418 of the Norwood decision \nbecause the court supposedly “not[ed] that many [individuals in the building] search for another restroom if an \nopposite-sex person is present.”  Yet, that portion of the court’s opinion actually dealt with whether the employer \nclosing the washrooms while opposite-sex employees serviced them was a reasonable alternative that would have \nallowed the employer to hire the plaintiff to work in the men’s washroom.  590 F. Supp. at 1418.  In discussing this \nalternative, the court noted that it was not feasible because during the closures “tenants would be forced to conduct \nan inconvenient, time consuming and sometimes difficult search for a washroom when the need to use a washroom \nmay be acute.”  Id.  Thus, to the extent that the tenants would be searching for a different washroom, they were \ndoing so because the washroom was closed.  Id. \n123 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 124 of 142\nbasis of sex permissible in certain circumstances, including those when privacy is an issue, they \ndo not support a conclusion that the presence of transgender students in the BASH locker rooms \nand bathrooms is, in itself, a hostile environment under Title IX.66 \n  The plaintiffs have not referenced and the court has not found any case determining that \nthe mere presence of transgender students in a high school locker room or bathroom, the viewing \nof a transgender student in a state of partial undress in a high school locker room or bathroom, or \na transgender student viewing a cisgender student (which does not appear to have not happened \nin  this  case)  in  a  high  school  locker  rooms  or  bathroom  constitutes severe,  pervasive  and \nobjectively offensive conduct that would state a cause of action under Title IX.  In addition, the \ncourt does not find that the plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to prove that the School \nDistrict’s  conduct  is  objectively  offensive  because  a  reasonable  person  would  not  find  the \npractice of allowing transgender students to use the locker rooms and bathrooms corresponding \nto their gender identity to be hostile, threatening, or humiliating.  There is no evidence that these \nstudents have committed any lewd acts in the locker room or bathrooms or that they have even \ninteracted with the plaintiffs in any way whatsoever.  There is no evidence that the transgender \nstudents have harassed the plaintiffs or any other student.  All the evidence showed was that the \n                                                 \n66 The plaintiffs also briefly mention two other cases in support of their argument that they were subjected to severe \nharassment that warrant brief mention, namely New Jersey Division of Youth & Family Services v. M.R., FN-04-\n344-12, 2014 WL 1977014 (N.J. Super. App. May 16, 2014) and City of Phila. v. Pennsylvania Human Relations \nCommission, 300 A.2d 97 (Pa. Commw. 1973).  The plaintiffs claim that these cases support a finding that their \nexposure to transgender students in locker rooms and bathrooms “violates students’ privacy rights and places them \nat risk of ‘permanent emotional impairment.’”  Neither case is “remotely similar” to this case.  See Students, 2016 \nWL 6134121, at *33.  More specifically, the Commonwealth Court in City of Philadelphia concluded – in another \nbona fide occupational qualification case – that “[t]o subject a girl [between the ages of seven to sixteen] to a \nthorough search of her body by a male [adult] supervisor could cause not only a temporary traumatic condition, but \nalso permanent irreparable harm to her psyche.  [In addition,] [t]o have a woman supervisor observe daily showers \nof the boys at a time in life when sex is a mysterious and often troubling force is to risk a permanent emotional \nimpairment under the guise of equality.” City of Phila., 300 A.2d at 102-03.  In M.R., the court was faced with a \nfinding of abuse and neglect by a mother with respect to her fourteen-year-old daughter.  2014 WL 1977014 at *1.  \nThe abuse came to light after the girl’s father was investigated for sexually abusing his fifteen-year-old niece.  Id.  \nAs part of the investigation, the daughter reported her father having recently showered her (and in fact, he had \nregularly taken showers with all of the children (boys and girls) since the children were young).  Id. \n  It is apparent from even a cursory review of these cases that they have no application here. \n124 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 125 of 142\ntransgender  students  were  in  the  facilities  for  their  intended  purposes  and  they  conducted \nthemselves appropriately while in those areas. \nThe plaintiffs are clearly opposed to having themselves viewed by a transgender student \nin a state of undress or potentially viewing a transgender student in a state of undress.  They are \napparently opposed to the transgender student being in the locker room even if no one is getting \ndressed or undressed.  They are opposed to transgender girls being in the girls’ bathroom and \nlocker room to the extent that female students are tending to menstruation-related issues and do \nnot want those issues known to boys, even boys identifying as girls.  As in Students, there are \nnumerous privacy protections for students at the school that significantly reduce or eliminate any \npotential issues.  2016 WL 6134121, at *33-35 (discussing privacy protections and alternatives). \n  As explained above, the School District has four shower stalls in each of the locker rooms \nthat have curtains.  While it is possible that a student could attempt to open those privacy \ncurtains as happened with Mary Smith, it is purely speculation that a transgender student is going \nto do so.  Other than that speculative possibility, there is no indication that the privacy curtains \ndo not provide the requisite privacy while in the locker room.  In addition, the School District \nprovided sufficient evidence to show that they are committed to providing all students with as \ncomfortable of an environment as possible while at BASH and Dr. Cooper indicated that the \nlocker rooms have team rooms that could be used by requesting students to change for this \nupcoming year. \n  With regard to the restrooms, the restrooms have stalls with locking doors that provide \nprivacy even in the boys’ bathrooms to the extent that those bathrooms lack dividers between \nurinals.  The plaintiffs focus on some of the partitions not being high enough or low enough to \nprovide for complete protection while in there.  Despite the gaps, there is no indication that \n125 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 126 of 142\nindividuals while in the stalls cannot ensure that their privacy is maintained while inside of the \nstalls.  Nonetheless, even with gaps along the edges of the doors and the gaps above and below \nthe partitions, the plaintiffs have not shown that there is anything objectively offensive about the \nplaintiffs having to use the bathrooms with a transgender student, even to the extent that it is \nremotely possible that a transgender girl could potentially overhear a female student tending to \nmenstruation issues while in the locker room.  Further, once again, as with any student’s use of \nthe locker rooms or bathrooms at BASH, if the student is uncomfortable, the students can use a \nsingle-user facility to change or use the restroom and obtain the desired privacy there.67 \n  Accordingly,  for  all  of  the  above  reasons,  the  plaintiffs  have  failed  to  establish  a \nlikelihood of success on their Title IX sexual harassment hostile environment claim.68 \n \n \n                                                 \n67 The court notes that the plaintiffs contend that the defendants cannot “escape liability by requiring victims to \nremove themselves from the environment.”  Pls.’ Mem. at 38.  The plaintiffs cite to Seiwert v. Spencer-Own \nCommunity School Corp., 497 F. Supp. 2d 942, 954 (S.D. Ind. 2007) in support of this statement.  In Seiwert, the \ncourt determined that a jury could conclude that a school district’s actions in response to pervasive and serious \nbullying from other students was clearly unreasonable when (1) the school district did not even discipline one of the \nstudents even though that student had twice threatened to kill the bullied student, (2) the school district minimized \nthe threats when discussing them with the bullied student, (3) the school district took action, but only in the nature of \nmoving the bullied student to another classroom instead of dealing with the bullying itself, and (4) the school district \ndisciplined both the bullied student and the bully when the bully decided to physically assault the bullied student.  \n497 F. Supp. 2d at 954. \n  The Seiwert court did not determine that it was improper under Title IX, in itself, to try to remove the \nbullied student from class with the bully.  Instead, the court noted that the school district took virtually no action to \neliminate the bullying and it was apparent that simply moving the bullied student to another classroom was \ninsufficient to resolve the bullying.  Here, we are dealing with students’ use of locker rooms and bathrooms.  \nProviding the students with alternative places to get changed and use the restrooms should they be uncomfortable in \nthe current arrangements (which may or may not actually involve a transgender student) is not even remotely \ncomparable to the bullying situation in Seiwert and the school district’s undeniably unreasonable response to the \nbullying in that case, which included removing the bullied student from the classroom. \n68 Because of the court’s resolution of the other elements to a hostile environment claim, the court has not addressed \nwhether the plaintiffs were denied the benefits of any educational opportunity, class, or program as required by Title \nIX because the plaintiffs have not shown any actionable harassment.  Nonetheless, from a grades perspective, only \nJoel Doe has identified that he was negatively affected insofar as his gym class grade dropped when he declined to \ndress for gym class.  It is unclear whether the plaintiffs’ decision not to use the multi-user bathrooms as much (or at \nall) when they all indicated that they could still access bathrooms at BASH if they needed to do so (and that they did \naccess the bathrooms albeit less often) would constitute a denial of an educational program or activity under Title \nIX. \n126 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 127 of 142\n3.  Pennsylvania Tort of Invasion of Privacy – Intrusion Upon Seclusion \na.  The Parties’ Arguments \nFor their final cause of action, the plaintiffs contend that the defendants have violated \nPennsylvania’s common law by intruding upon their seclusion.  Pls.’ Mem. at 39-43.  More \nspecifically, the plaintiffs argue that by virtue of the School District’s policy the defendants are \nintruding upon their seclusion, such as when Joel Doe and Jack Jones used the bathrooms and \nlocker rooms, by allowing members of the opposite sex to enter into the bathrooms and locker \nrooms corresponding to their gender.  Id. at 40.  In addition to the physical intrusion, the \nplaintiffs claim that there is a visual intrusion insofar as Student A viewed Joel Doe and Jack \nJones in their underwear, and this risk will continue as long as the current practice remains.  Id. \nat 40-41.  Further, even hearing urination or the female plaintiffs (or other female students) \ntending to menstruation issues and the sounds commonly associated with that (such as the \nopening of wrapping for pads and tampons) is a violation of that privacy and an intrusion into the \nplaintiffs’ seclusion.  Id. at 42. \n  The plaintiffs point out again that society has long recognized the need for separate \nfacilities  for  the  biological  sexes  and  this  need  for  minors  in  school  is  reflected  in  the \nPennsylvania School Code’s requirement that there be separate facilities for boys and girls.  Id. \nat 41-42. They argue that the School Code’s requirement, in itself, shows that the Pennsylvania \nGeneral Assembly recognizes the need to have privacy from the opposite sex.  Id. \n  The defendants argue that the plaintiffs are unlikely to prevail on their common law \ninvasion  of  privacy  claim  against  them  because  they  are  entitled  to  immunity  under  the \nPennsylvania Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa. C.S. § 8541.  Defs.’ Mem. at 22.  \nThey point out that their actions do not fall into any of the eight categories of negligence that \n127 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 128 of 142\nconstitute an exception to immunity, and the plaintiffs have not alleged that they engaged in a \ncrime, actual fraud, or willful misconduct.  Id. at 23.  Even if the court was to determine that the \ndefendants are not entitled to immunity, they assert that the plaintiffs have still failed to show a \nlikelihood of success on the merits because the defendants did not personally intrude upon the \nplaintiffs’ seclusion.  Id. at 23-24.  Thus, the only possible claim is that the defendants are \nindirectly intruding upon their seclusion by allowing transgender students into restrooms and \nlocker rooms consistent with their gender identity and there is no basis for finding them liable \nunder  such  a  theory.    Id.  at  24.    Finally,  the  defendants  contend  that  any  intrusion  was \ninsubstantial and would not have been highly offensive to an ordinary reasonable person because \nthe  overwhelming  majority  of  cisgender  students  have  shared  school  locker  rooms  and \nbathrooms with transgender students since the beginning of the 2016-17 school year without \nincident.  Id. \n  As for PYC, it focuses on the lack of intrusion and offensive conduct by merely having \ntransgender students in locker rooms and bathrooms with the plaintiffs and other cisgender \nstudents.  PYC’s Mem. at 9.  Instead of there being an “intrusion,” the facts merely show that \nindividual students, including transgender students, are using the communal facilities in the \nBASH locker rooms and restrooms.  Id. at 10.  To the extent that the plaintiffs seek additional \nprivacy, there are individual toilet and shower stalls in the locker room and toilet stalls in the \nmulti-user bathrooms.  Id. \n  PYC also argues that even if the presence of transgender students in the shared facilities \ncould constitute a privacy intrusion, the intrusion is not substantial because other people are \nalways in communal facilities.  Id.  The fact that there are additional students in these areas is not \n128 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 129 of 142\nsubstantial. Id.  Moreover, there is no evidence of a transgender student behaving improperly in \nthose communal areas.  Id. \nb.  Analysis \n  With the common law tort of invasion of privacy, intrusion upon seclusion, Pennsylvania \nfollows section 652B of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which defines this tort as follows: \n“One who intentionally intrudes, physically or otherwise, upon the solitude or seclusion of \nanother or his private affairs or concerns, is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his \nprivacy, if the intrusion would be highly offensive to a reasonable person.”  Harris by Harris v. \nEaston Pub. Co., 483 A.2d 1377, 1383 (Pa. Super. 1984) (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § \n652B).  This invasion can occur “(1) by physical intrusion into a place where the plaintiff has \nsecluded himself, (2) by the use of the defendant’s senses to oversee or overhear the plaintiff’s \nprivate affairs, or (3) some other form of investigation or examination into the plaintiff’s private \nconcerns.”  Id. (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 652B, cmt. b).  This “cause of action also \nrequires that the plaintiff has a reasonable expectation of privacy.” Kline v. Security Guards, \nInc., 386 F.3d 246, 260 (3d Cir. 2004).  In addition, the intrusion must “cause mental suffering, \nshame, or humiliation to a person of ordinary sensibilities.”  Harris by Harris, 483 A.2d at 1384-\n85 (citation omitted). \n  The court will first address the defendants’ claim that this tort action is barred against \nthem under the Pennsylvania Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa. C.S. §§ 8541-8564 \n(“PSTCA”).  Although the defendants have included this claim in their memorandum of law in \nresponse to the motion for a preliminary injunction and a motion to dismiss that they have filed \nin this case, they did not reference this argument in their most recent filing of their proposed \nfindings of fact and conclusions of law.  To the extent that the defendants are still asserting this \n129 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 130 of 142\nclaim with respect to this motion, the court notes that the PSTCA provides that “[e]xcept as \notherwise provided in this subchapter, no local agency shall be liable for any damages on \naccount of any injury to a person or property caused by any act of the local agency or an \nemployee thereof or any other person.”69 42 Pa. C.S. § 8541 (emphasis added).  Here, however, \nas the court is dealing with a claim for injunctive relief, the PSTCA would not apply to the \nplaintiffs’ claims.  See E-Z Parks, Inc. v. Larson, 498 A.2d 1364, 1369 (Pa. Commw. 1985) \n(“Since governmental immunity under Section 8541 of the Judicial Code extends only to liability \nfor damages, Petitioner must be permitted to pursue his claim against the [Philadelphia Parking \nAuthority] for injunctive relief.”). \n  This particular cause of action, by its very nature, raises a concern that the defendants \nraise in passing, but without citing to any legal support.  Out of the three different ways that a \ndefendant could intrude upon the seclusion of another person as described in section 652B of the \nRestatement, only the first two situations are potentially applicable here.  Therefore, the plaintiffs \ncould only show a likelihood of success on the merits if the defendants (1) physically intruded \ninto a place where the plaintiffs secluded themselves, or (2) used their senses to oversee or \noverhear the plaintiffs’ private affairs. \n  The plaintiffs’ claim is premised on the defendants’ practice of allowing transgender \nstudents to use the privacy facilities corresponding to their gender.  The plaintiffs do not allege \nand have introduced no evidence that any of the individual defendants or any employees or \nagents of the School District ever personally invaded their privacy insofar as there are no \nallegations or evidence that any School District employees or agents were in the locker rooms or \n                                                 \n69 The School District would appear to fall with the definition of a “local agency” under the PSTCA and would be \nentitled to governmental immunity unless the particular claim fell within one of the exceptions to governmental \nimmunity contained in the Act.  See Wells v. Harrisburg Area Sch. Dist., 884 A.2d 946, 847 (Pa. Commw. 2005) \n(“We note that local government agencies, such as school districts, are generally immune from tort liability under \nthe . . . Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act[.]”).  \n130 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 131 of 142\nbathrooms with the plaintiffs.  The individuals that purportedly invaded the seclusion of the \nplaintiffs were the transgender students, Students A and B. \n  The defendants briefly assert that they cannot be liable for this common law invasion of \nprivacy claim because they did not actually commit the tort.  Defs.’ Mem. at 23-24.  The \ndefendants do not actually cite a case in support of this argument and do not even discuss the \nplaintiffs’ state law cause of action at all in their supplemental proposed findings of fact and \nconclusions of law.  On the other hand, the plaintiffs do not cite to a case in which any court \nrecognized a cause of action against a governmental entity for an intentional tort when third \nparties (and not agents or employees of the governmental entity) are the ones that commit the \nintentional  tort.    The  court  has  not  located  such  a  case  in  the  Third  Circuit  or  in  the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania.70  The uncertainty as to whether the plaintiffs have a viable \ncause of action under Pennsylvania law for this type of invasion of privacy would alone serve as \na basis for the court to find that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success \n                                                 \n70 The closest case that the court located that was potentially similar to the facts and claim here was a decision by the \nSupreme Court of Alabama in Carter v. Innisfree Hotel, Inc., 661 So. 2d 1174 (1995).  In Carter, the plaintiffs, a \nhusband and wife, were staying in a hotel room when they heard knocking and scratching sounds that “appeared to \nemanate from behind a wall near the bathroom; the wall was covered by a mirror.”  661 So. 2d at 1177.  The \nplaintiffs presumed that the sound was coming from the adjacent room and they proceeded to go about their \nactivities in the hotel room that afternoon, which included having sexual intercourse.  Id.  Later that evening, the \nplaintiffs found a hole in a wall that appeared to allow someone to spy on them through a mirror that was in the \nroom.  Id.  There was no identification of the individual that possibly spied on the plaintiffs. \n  The plaintiffs sued the company that managed the hotel for, inter alia, the invasion of their privacy.  Id. at \n1178.  The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the management company, and the plaintiffs appealed.  \nId. \n  In reversing the trial court, the Supreme Court of Alabama determined that there was an issue of fact \nwhether an agent of the management company spied on the plaintiffs.  Id. at 1178-79.  The Court also concluded that \n“[t]here can be no doubt that the possible intrusion of foreign eyes into the private seclusion of a customer’s hotel \nroom is an invasion of that customer’s privacy[.]” Id. at 1179.  Most important to the instant case, however, the \nCourt further determined that \n \n[e]ven if it is proven that a third party, someone other than an agent of [the management \ncompany], caused the holes and scratches, [the management company] may be held liable for the \ninvasion of the [plaintiffs’] privacy.  It had an affirmative duty, stemming from a guest’s rights of \nprivacy and peaceful possession not to allow unregistered and unauthorized third parties to gain \naccess to the rooms of its guests. \n \nId. \n   \n131 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 132 of 142\non the merits.  Nonetheless, for sake of completeness the court will presume that such a cause of \naction exists and now determine whether the plaintiffs have established a likelihood of success \non this claim. \n  The court does not deny that an individual seeks seclusion in a bathroom toilet stall from \nbeing viewed by other people outside of the stall.  The cases cited by the plaintiff, Koeppel v. \nSpeirs, No. CIV. A. 08-1927, 2010 WL 200417 (Iowa Ct. App. Jan. 22, 2010) and Kohler v. City \nof  Wapakoneta,  381  F.  Supp.  2d  692  (N.D. Ohio),  in  support  of  their  contention  that  the \ntransgender students invaded their privacy when they were in the common areas of the bathroom \nand locker room, involve alleged invasions of privacy in bathroom stalls.  See Kohler, 381 F. \nSupp. 2d at 697 (indicating plaintiff female police officer’s allegation that she discovered a \nrunning tape recorder behind a trash can in a toilet stall in the police department’s women’s \nroom, which was left there by the chief of police); Koeppel, 2010 WL 200417, at *1 (explaining \nthat the plaintiff discovered a digital surveillance camera hidden inside the “small (4’ x 7’) \nbathroom”).  Here, there are no allegations and the plaintiffs presented no evidence that any \ntransgender student invaded their seclusion while they were in a bathroom stall.  And similarly, \nalthough the plaintiffs indicate that viewing a person while in a bathroom would be “considered \n‘highly offensive’ by any reasonable person,” see Pls.’ Mem. at 40-41 (quoting Koeppel, 2010 \nWL 200417 at *3), the case cited involved an intrusion into a single bathroom stall and not the \npresence of someone in the common area of a multi-user facility. \n  The plaintiffs claim that \n[t]he objective offensiveness to the reasonable person [by having a member of the \nopposite sex, i.e. a transgender person, in the bathroom or locker room with them] \nis evident in the fact that we have long recognized the right to a private setting, \nfree from persons of the opposite sex in restrooms and locker rooms, which are \nonly made necessary since we often enter into a state of undress or perform \n132 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 133 of 142\nprivate functions therein, which require a buffer from members of the opposite \nsex that we do not require from members of the same sex. \n \nPls.’ Mem. at 41.  As indicated earlier, the plaintiffs then point to the School Code’s requirement \nof separate facilities for the sexes as Pennsylvania’s recognition of the need for privacy from the \nopposite sex in facilities.  Pls.’ Mem. at 41 (citing 24 P.S. § 7-740).71 \n  The plaintiffs do not argue that by entering the multi-user bathrooms and the locker \nrooms at BASH that they attempted to seclude themselves from all students at BASH, nor could \nthey insofar as those areas are shared common areas with other students.   As for locker rooms \ngenerally, “[p]ublic school locker rooms . . . are not notable for the privacy they afford.”  \nVernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 657 (1995).  Nonetheless, they believe that it is \nobjectively reasonable to have their activities secluded from observation by members of the \nopposite sex when in the common areas of the locker rooms and bathrooms.  See Pls.’ Findings \nand Conclusions at ECF p. 50 ¶ 92 (citing Kohler, 318 F. Supp. 2d at 704). \n  As indicated earlier in this opinion, the court does not find that it is more likely than not \n(or even just likely) that Student A viewed either Jack Jones or Joel Doe while they were in their \nunderwear based on the evidence currently before the court because both plaintiffs have made \nconflicting statements and it appears that the weight of evidence at this early stage shows that \nthey saw Student A and reacted only to seeing Student A on one occasion (each).  Regardless, \nthe  court  does  not  find  that  a  reasonable  person  would  be  offended  by  the  presence  of  a \ntransgender student in the bathroom or locker room with them, despite the possibility that the \ntransgender student could possibly be in a state of undress more significant than Student A was \nin this case when the male plaintiffs saw him.  In addition, the mere presence of a transgender \n                                                 \n71 While the plaintiffs referred to this section of the School Code as applying to privacy facilities generally, the \nlanguage of this section applies only to “water-closets or out-houses,” which are what we think of as bathrooms.  \nThere is a question as to whether this section would apply to a locker room, but if the locker room contains \nbathrooms, one could argue that this section of the code could apply. \n133 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 134 of 142\nstudent in the common area of the girls’ bathroom washing hands, as experienced by Mary \nSmith, is also not objectively offensive to a reasonable person.  Moreover, the fact that the Public \nSchool Code calls for sex-segregated water-closets and out-houses does not necessitate a finding \nthat the presence of the transgender student is objectively offensive to a reasonable person \nbecause it is not determinative as to whether a reasonable person would object to the presence of \na transgender student in the locker room or bathroom.  Furthermore, even though Joel Doe, Mary \nSmith, and Jack Jones stated that their sole experiences with transgender students at BASH \ncaused them embarrassment and humiliation, it is definitely not clear that the conduct they \nexperienced or could experience at BASH in the future, especially considering the privacy \nprotections  and  alternative arrangements available at BASH, would cause mental suffering, \nshame, or humiliation to a person of ordinary sensibilities.  Accordingly, even if the plaintiffs \ncould maintain this type of invasion of privacy claim against the defendants, even though they \ndid not personally invade their seclusion while in any bathroom or locker room, the court does \nnot find that they have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits. \nC.

The Parties’ Arguments \n  With respect to irreparable harm, the plaintiffs assert that the School District’s practice \n“has stolen their right to privacy, is altering the conditions of their education by subjecting them \nto sexual harassment, and constitutes an invasion of seclusion.”  Pls.’ Mem. at 43.  They argue \nthat the court should presume irreparable harm since they are able to show a violation of their \nconstitutional right to privacy.  Pls.’ Findings and Conclusions at ECF p. 53, ¶ 108 (citations \nomitted); Pls.’ Mem. at 43 (citations omitted).  As for their Title IX and intrusion upon seclusion \nclaims, the plaintiffs claim that they will suffer irreparable harm because the sexual harassment \n134 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 135 of 142\nand the violations of their privacy are not compensable through money damages.  Pls.’ Findings \nand Conclusions at ECF p. 54, ¶¶ 111, 112. \n  The defendants contend that the plaintiffs’ purported harm, namely the exposure of their \nbodies and intimate activities to members of the opposite sex and the viewing of members of the \nopposite sex in areas where they expect privacy (from members of the opposite sex), is not \nirreparable because they have the opportunity to use single-user restroom and changing facilities \nif they are uncomfortable.  Defs.’ Mem. at 25; Defs.’ Findings and Conclusions at 42.  PYC \nraises a similar argument:  The plaintiffs will not suffer irreparable harm because the School \nDistrict does not require them to use the common rooms of the bathrooms or the locker rooms \nand can use the single-user facilities.  PYC’s Findings and Conclusions at 19, ¶ 101.  PYC points \nout that the plaintiffs can “avoid all of the claimed harm if this Court denies their request for \npreliminary injunctive relief while the case runs its course.” Id.  PYC also encourages the court \nto follow the reasoning in Students, which rejected a similar request for injunctive relief and \nfound that the plaintiffs had failed to show irreparable harm.  Id. at 19, ¶ 102 (citing Students, \n2016 WL 6134121, at *37, *38).   PYC also notes that the court should consider the delay in \nfiling the complaint and motion for a preliminary injunction, considering that Joel Doe knew \nabout the practice on October 31, 2016, his parents learned of the practice shortly thereafter, and \nyet he did not file a complaint in this case until March 31, 2017, and did not file the motion for a \npreliminary injunction until May 17, 2017.  Id. at 20, ¶ 103. \n2.  Analysis \n  Concerning a showing of irreparable harm, “the plaintiff must demonstrate potential harm \nwhich cannot be redressed by a legal or equitable remedy following a trial.  The preliminary \ninjunction must be the only way of protecting the plaintiff from harm.”  Instant Air Freight Co. \n135 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 136 of 142\nv. C.F. Air Freight, Inc., 882 F.2d 797, 801 (3d Cir. 1989).  Thus, to support the issuance of a \npreliminary injunction, a plaintiff must demonstrate a “clear showing of immediate irreparable \ninjury . . . or a presently existing actual threat; (an injunction) may not be used simply to \neliminate a possibility of a remote future injury, or a future invasion of rights, be those rights \nprotected by statute or by the common law.” Continental Grp., Inc. v. Amoco Chems. Corp., 614 \nF.2d 351, 359 (3d Cir. 1980) (internal citations and quotations omitted).  The “risk of irreparable \nharm [also] must not be speculative.”  Adams v. Freedom Forge Corp., 204 F.3d 475, 488 (3d \nCir. 2000) (citation omitted).  Further, if the threatened harm is compensable with money \ndamages, a movant seeking preliminary injunctive relief has not demonstrated irreparable harm \nand the court should not issue a preliminary injunction.  See Frank’s GMC Truck Ctr., Inc. v. \nG.M.C., 847 F.2d 100, 102-03 (3d Cir. 1998) (“The availability of adequate monetary damages \nbelies a claim of irreparable injury.”); Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 90 (1974) (“The \npossibility that adequate compensatory or other corrective relief might be available at a later \ndate, in the ordinary course of litigation, weighs heavily against a claim of irreparable harm.”); \nA.O.  Smith  Corp.  v.  F.T.C.,  530  F.2d  515,  525  (3d  Cir.  1976)  (explaining  that  the  word \nirreparable connotes “‘that which cannot be repaired, retrieved, put down again, atoned for . . ..’” \n(quoting Gause v. Perkins, 3 Jones Eq. 177, 69 Am.Dec. 728 (1857)).  Additionally, a “‘delay in \nseeking enforcement of those rights . . . tends to indicate at least a reduced need for such drastic, \nspeedy action.’” Lanin v. Borough of Tenafly, 515 F. App’x 114, 118 (3d Cir. 2013) (quoting \nCitibank, N.A. v. Citytrust, 756 F.2d 273, 275 (2d Cir. 1985)); see FMC Corp. v. Control \nSolutions, Inc., 369 F. Supp. 2d 539, 582 (E.D. Pa. 2005) (“An unreasonable delay in seeking an \ninjunction negates the presumption of irreparable harm.”). \n136 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 137 of 142\n  The court has already determined that the plaintiffs’ have not shown a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits on any of their claims, so to the extent that they argue that the court should \npresume irreparable harm because of the existence of a constitutional invasion of privacy or a \nTitle IX violation, this court need not consider this argument.  Regarding PYC’s argument about \nthe plaintiffs’ delay in filing this action and in seeking preliminary injunctive relief, as far as the \ncourt can tell the plaintiffs have not addressed  the timing of the filing of this action or the timing \nof filing the instant motion for a preliminary injunction in their submissions.  PYC did not raise \nthis argument until submitting its supplemental proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law \non the day before the argument on August 11, 2017. \nAlthough Joel Doe and his parents knew about the practice no later than the first couple \nof days in November 2016, Jane and John Doe testified during their depositions about their \nattempts to resolve their concerns by talking to Dr. Faidley in December 2016 and Jane Doe’s \nconversations with a School Board member.  While unclear as to when Joel Doe sought counsel \nfor assistance in this matter, it appears that Joel Doe had attempted to resolve this matter with the \nSchool District outside of court and prior to filing suit, which is why Dr. Faidley referenced the \nSchool Board’s vote to not accept the plaintiffs’ demands and to keep the current practice in \nplace.72  The School Board’s vote occurred on March 28, 2017, and Joel Doe and his parents \nfiled the complaint three days later.  The additional plaintiffs then joined the litigation on April \n18, 2017.  The parties did not file the motion seeking a preliminary injunction until May 17, \n2017. Considering that the plaintiffs are asserting that the defendants’ practice violated their \nconstitutional right to privacy, their access to educational opportunities under Title IX, and their \nright to seclusion, this one-month delay might, in itself, weigh against a finding of irreparable \n                                                 \n72 It is unclear if any of the other plaintiffs, who were not parties to the suit when originally filed, were part of any \nsettlement negotiations. \n137 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 138 of 142\nharm.  Nonetheless, it is completely understandable why the plaintiffs did not file this action \nuntil efforts to resolve the issue with the School District failed and the plaintiffs did not file the \ninstant motion until a month later.  Thus, it would be unreasonable under the circumstances for \nthe court to find that the plaintiffs were not promptly pursuing their claims so as to weigh against \na finding of irreparable harm.73 \n  On a practical level, the court finds that the privacy protections that are in place at BASH, \nwhich include the bathroom stalls and shower stalls in the locker rooms, the bathroom stalls in \nthe multi-user bathrooms, the availability of a number of single-user bathrooms (a few of which \nwill have lockers for storing items), the availability of students to store personal items in their \nlocker or leave those items with the gym teacher, and the availability of the team rooms in the \nlocker rooms (which would not involve students passing through the common area of the locker \nroom), and the overall willingness of the defendants to work with the students and their families \nto assure that the students are comfortable at BASH, mitigates against a finding of irreparable \nharm.  At this point in the litigation, the court is concerned with the privacy protections available \nat BASH for the upcoming school year and not whatever past protections were available to \nstudents and whether the students knew about all of the available options or were advised of \nthem by the School District for the last completed school year.74  The privacy protections \navailable to students in 2017-18 are more than suitable to address any privacy concerns relating \nto the presence of transgender students in the locker rooms and bathrooms at BASH. \n                                                 \n73 Although PYC encourages the court to follow the Students court on this issue, Students involved a delay of a \nminimum of seven months before the plaintiffs in that case filed a lawsuit and there is no discussion from the court \nas to what the plaintiffs were doing between notice of the policy and the filing of the action insofar as whether they \nwere actively pursuing avenues for relief outside of court.  See Students, 2016 WL 6134121 at *39. \n74 It does not appear that Jack Jones, Mary Smith, or Macy Roe inquired about alternative accommodations with the \ndefendants.  Macy Roe never even discussed any concerns with the defendants, and it is unclear that Mary Smith \ndiscussed the practice with the defendants other than reporting having seen Student B in the girls’ bathroom. \n138 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 139 of 142\n  The  court  recognizes  that  during  oral  argument  and  as  noted  elsewhere  in  their \nsubmissions, the plaintiffs argue that the court cannot refuse to find irreparable harm based on \nthese  alternative  arrangements  because  the  “[g]overnment  may  not  condition  a  benefit  on \nsomeone waiving a constitutional right.”  Pls.’ Findings and Conclusions at ECF p. 42, ¶ 44 \n(citing Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Mgmt. Dist., 133 S.Ct. 2586 (2013)); see also id. at ECF \np. 41, ¶¶ 42, 43.  This is “known as the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, [which] vindicates \nthe Constitution’s enumerated rights by preventing the government from coercing people into \ngiving them up.”  Koontz, 133 S.Ct. at 2594.  This argument misses the mark. \n  There is no evidence that the School District is coercing the students to give up their \nconstitutional  right  to  privacy  by  providing  them  with  additional  facilities  if  they  are \nuncomfortable  in  the  locker  room  for  any  reason,  including  because  of  the  presence  of \ntransgender students.  The School District is also not denying any benefit to the plaintiffs \nbecause they are exercising a constitutional right.  They may still use the locker rooms and multi-\nuser bathrooms at BASH without limitation.  In addition, the plaintiffs (at least the three that \ncould be returning to BASH this year) may use the single-user facilities at BASH (to the extent \nthere was an uncertainty about availability for use during the 2016-17 school year). This also is \nnot  a  particular  benefit  conferred  upon  them  because  all  students  can  use  the  single-user \nfacilities,  including  the  nurse’s  office  with  permission  from  the  nurse.    The  only  possible \n“benefit” being conferred is the use of the team rooms, but again, as with everything else, Dr. \nCooper indicated that the use of the team rooms would be available to any student at BASH.  \nThere is no evidence supporting a conclusion that the School District is denying a benefit to the \nplaintiffs because they are attempting to exercise a constitutional right, and there is no evidence \nthat the School District is attempting to coerce the plaintiffs into giving up such a right.  As such, \n139 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 140 of 142\nthis argument lacks merit and the privacy protections available at BASH fully mitigate against \nany harm the plaintiffs could suffer here. \n  On the Title IX claim, only Joel Doe indicated that his grades suffered last year because \nof the defendants’ practice insofar as he refused to dress for gym class because he believed that \nhe did not have a suitable place to secure his belongings and he lost points toward his grade \n(although he did not fail the course).75  This concern appears to be resolved for the upcoming \nschool year because at least a few of the single-user facilities, including the one in the nurse’s \noffice and the one near the gym, will have a locker for students to secure belongings and the \ndefendants have indicated that Joel Doe can store his belongings in his hall locker or with the \ngym teacher if he decides to change in a single-user facility without a locker.  Additionally, the \nplaintiffs know there are numerous alternatives for them to use the bathroom, so they should not \nhave to refrain from using the restroom to the extent that they did so in 2016-17 without seeking \nout possibly available alternatives. \n  Accordingly, the court finds that the plaintiffs have not established that they would be \nirreparably harmed.76 \n                                                 \n75 In Students, the court noted the following with respect to irreparable harm showings in Title IX cases: \n \n“[L]ack  of  access  to  classes  and  related  programs,  services,  and  activities  can  constitute \nirreparable injury for purposes of a preliminary injunction.”  P.P. v. Compton Unified Sch. Dist., \n135 F. Supp. 3d 1126, 1148 (C.D. Cal. 2015).  Even when access is denied, though, movants may \nbe required to show more to establish irreparable harm.  Sellers v. Univ. of Rio Grande, 838 F. \nSupp. 2d 677, 687 (S.D. Ohio 2012) (noting that there is “some authority for the proposition that \nan interruption in an educational program is not, in itself, an irreparable injury” and also “contrary \ncase law” that finds irreparable harm “especially when the denial of an educational opportunity is \ncoupled with other types of harm”). \n \n2016 WL 6134121 at *37. \n76 There is also an undercurrent of speculation that permeates this litigation.  While BASH could have additional \ntransgender students seek and receive approval to use the privacy facilities corresponding to their gender identity for \nthe upcoming school year, the evidence in the record is that the School District is aware of three transgender \nstudents, including Student A, who are returning to BASH for 2017-18, with at least Student A having already \nreceived permission to use the boys’ bathrooms and locker room.  Nonetheless, it is unclear whether Student A will \neven have gym class with Jack Jones or Joel Doe, or whether a transgender female student will have gym class with \nMary Smith (if she is even returning to BASH for her senior year).  If there is not a transgender student in gym with \n140 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 141 of 142\nD.  Balance of Harm/Whether Non-Moving Party Will Suffer Greater Harm \n  Because the court has determined that the plaintiffs have failed to establish a likelihood \nof success on the merits or irreparable harm, the court need not address the final two factors \nbecause the plaintiffs’ failure “must necessarily result in the denial of a preliminary injunction.”  \nIn re Arthur Treacher’s Franchisee Litig., 689 F.2d 1137, 1143 (3d Cir. 1982). As such, the \ncourt will not analyze whether granting a preliminary injunction here would cause greater harm \nto a non-moving party or whether the injunction would be in the public interest.77 \nVI.  CONCLUSION \n  The plaintiffs here are required to clearly show that they are entitled to the extraordinary \nremedy of a preliminary injunction.  In addition, they have a particularly heavy burden because \nthey are seeking to change the status quo insofar as the practice in place at BASH over the past \nyear has been to allow transgender students to use the restrooms and locker rooms consistent \nwith their gender identity.  With regard to their section 1983 invasion of privacy claim brought \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment, their sexual harassment hostile environment claim under Title \nIX, and their state law invasion of privacy claim, at this early juncture and upon the current \n                                                                                                                                                             \nthem, there is no potential issue.  To the extent that Jack Jones and Joel Doe used the multi-user bathrooms at \nBASH, there was no testimony that they interacted with a transgender male in the bathroom and it is possible that \nthey will go the entirety of 2017-18 without doing so as well. \n77 The court recognizes that in balancing the harms, the court must examine “the potential injury to the plaintiff if an \ninjunction does not issue versus the potential injury to the defendant if the injunction is issued.” Novartis Consumer \nHealth, Inc. v. Johnson & Johnson—Merck Consumer Pharm. Co., 290 F.3d 578, 596 (3d Cir. 2002).  As the \nplaintiffs have failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of those claims, the court notes that the \nbalance of the harms would have favored the defendants because the effect of changing the current practice on the \ntransgender students would be that they will be forced to use the bathroom of their birth sex, of which they do not \nidentify, or end up being one of the limited number of students using the single-user facilities.  Dr. Leibowitz \ncredibly testified as to the negative effect on the transgender students if they are unable to use the facilities \ncorresponding with their gender.  As an additional note, and as mentioned by the School District, a preliminary \ninjunction ceasing the current practice could presumably lead to litigation brought by the transgender students for a \nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause or Title IX in light of the Evancho and Whitaker decisions.  There is also \nprecedent in this district that gender dysphoria can be a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act, and \nthere could be an issue with providing the requisite reasonable accommodations or the School District could be in \nviolation of the Act.  See Defs.’ Mem. at 44 (citing Blatt v. Cabela’s Retail, Inc., No. CIV. A. 14-4822, 2017 WL \n2178123, at *4 (E.D. Pa. May 18, 2017). \n141 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 68   Filed 08/25/17   Page 142 of 142\nrecord, the plaintiffs have not clearly shown that they are entitled to relief.  In particular, they \nhave not demonstrated that they are likely to succeed on the merits of these claims.  Additionally, \nthe plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they are likely to suffer irreparable injury if the court \ndoes not issue a preliminary injunction.  Since the plaintiffs failed to satisfy either of these \n“gateway” factors, the court need not balance the parties’ respective harms or consider whether a \npreliminary injunction is in the public interest.  Accordingly, the court will deny the motion for a \npreliminary injunction. \n  A separate order follows. \nBY THE COURT: \n \n \n \n/s/ Edward G. Smith         \nEDWARD G. SMITH, J. \n \n142 \n ",

Ct. 1599 (2019), Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda, \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 89   Filed 09/05/19   Page 2 of 4\ncert. granted, 139 S. Ct. 1599 (2019), and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes v. EEOC, cert. \ngranted, 139 S. Ct. 1599 (2019).2 \n  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT the court will hold a telephone conference on \nThursday, September 19, 2019, at 3:30 p.m. to discuss the schedule for this matter moving \nforward. Counsel for the plaintiffs shall initiate the call by contacting the undersigned’s civil \ndeputy clerk at (610) 333-1833 once all counsel are present on the call. \nBY THE COURT: \n \n \n \n              /s/ Edward G. Smith___ \n              EDWARD G. SMITH, J. \n \n \n                                                 \n1 The plaintiffs indicate that two additional plaintiffs were added to this lawsuit, but this court has not received \nnotice of these additional plaintiffs. Until the court receives more information about this change, the court will not \nchange the caption. \n2 Regarding motions to stay judicial proceedings, \n \nthe power to stay proceedings in incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the \ndisposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and \nfor litigants. How this can best be done calls for the exercise of judgment, which must weigh \ncompeting interests and maintain an even balance. True, the suppliant for a stay must make out a \nclear case of hardship or inequity in being required to go forward, if there is even a fair possibility \nthat  the  stay  for  which  he  prays  will  work  damage  to  some  one  [sic]  else.  Only  in  rare \ncircumstances will a litigant in one cause be compelled to stand aside while a litigant in another \nsettles the rule of law that will define the rights of each. \n \nLandis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254–55 (1936) (internal citations omitted). In addition, “[t]he proponent of a \nstay bears the burden of establishing its need.” Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 708 (1997). Further, “[w]hen \ndeciding a motion to stay proceedings pending the resolution of another action in federal court, courts have \nconsidered three factors: (1) the promotion of judicial economy; (2) the balance of harm to the parties; and (3) the \nduration of the requested stay.” Cirulli v. Bausch & Lomb, Inc., Civ. A. No. 08-4579, 2009 WL 545572, at *2 (E.D. \nPa. Mar. 4, 2009) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \n  The court will first reference the parties’ positions before analyzing the request for a stay. The plaintiffs \nrequest that the court stay this action pending the United States Supreme Court’s decisions in Bostock v. Clayton \nCounty, S. Ct. No. 17-1618, Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda, S. Ct. No. 17-1623, and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral \nHomes v. EEOC, S. Ct. No. 18-107 (collectively, the “Pending Cases”). Pls.’ Mot. to Stay Proceedings Pending \nResolution of Appeal in Bostock v. Clayton Cty., Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda, and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral \nHomes v. EEOC at 2, Doc. No. 85. In support of their request, the plaintiffs argue that the Court’s decision in the \nPending Cases “will answer, or give clarity to, the central legal issues before this [c]ourt.” Pl.’s Br. in Supp. of Mot. \nto Stay Proceedings Pending Resolution of Appeal in Bostock v. Clayton Cty., Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda, and \nR.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes v. EEOC at 4, Doc. No. 85-1. \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 89   Filed 09/05/19   Page 3 of 4\n                                                                                                                                                             \nIn this regard, they assert that \n \n[t]he constitutional right to bodily privacy claim turns on the meaning of “sex” because the right to \nbodily privacy is most pronounced with respect to the opposite sex . . .[, and w]ith the Title IX \nclaim, the Third Circuit’s functional understanding of the meaning of sex colored its analysis on \nwhat is a “hostile environment.” \n \nId. (internal citation omitted). They also claim that “[s]hould the Supreme Court interpret ‘sex’ to mean biological \nsex, and nothing more, the premise upon which the Third Circuit’s opinion rests is substantially changed.” Id. at 7. \n  In addition to the above, the plaintiffs point out that R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Home will clarify whether \nsex stereotypes are protected under Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989), and a Supreme Court \nholding that Price Waterhouse does not provide this protection will “substantially weaken” BASD’s case. Id. The \nplaintiffs also claim that PYCF’s “theory is similarly grounded in the sex-stereotyping theory that directly emerges \nfrom misreading Price Waterhouse.” Id. Thus, the plaintiffs assert that “whether Price Waterhouse created a new \nprotected class for gender nonconformance/transgender status outside the text of Title VII is at the bedrock of this \ncase.” Id. at 8. \n  Regarding their violation of bodily privacy claim, the plaintiffs believe that the Supreme Court will clarify \nthe meaning of “sex” when the Court decides the Pending Cases. Id. at 9–10. In particular, the plaintiffs note that a \ndecision that “sex” exclusively means biological sex will “call into question the Third Circuit’s analysis in this \ncase.” Id. at 10. As for Title IX, the plaintiffs indicate that even though the Pending Cases are Title VII cases, Title \nVII cases are instructive in Title IX hostile environment harassment cases. Id. at 11. The plaintiffs argue that the \nThird Circuit reached its conclusion about their Title IX claim by “essentially replacing sex with gender identity,” \nand if the Supreme Court “determine[s] that sex does not mean gender identity, the premise upon which the [Third \nCircuit] based its opinion would necessarily change.” Id. at 12–13. \n  For their final points, the plaintiffs argue that judicial economy supports staying this matter because the \nparties will have to engage in another round of discovery, motions for summary judgment, and a trial while \noperating in “the same confused legal context which led the Supreme Court to take not one or two cases, but three \nthat bear on the meaning of sex and will directly clarify Price Waterhouse’s stereotyping language.” Id. at 13. \nFurther, the plaintiffs believe that neither BASD nor PYCF are prejudiced by this matter because the policy they are \ndefending in this action would remain in place for the duration of the stay. Id. at 13–14. \n  In its opposition to the plaintiffs’ motion, BASD argues that a stay would not promote judicial economy \nbecause, inter alia, (1) the plaintiffs ignore that this court analyzed their invasion of privacy and Title IX claims \nusing their definition of sex as referring to one’s gender assigned at birth, (2) the court determined that the plaintiffs \nfailed to show that the defendants violated a constitutionally protected privacy interest in their partially clothed \nbodies and, as such, the definition of “sex” is immaterial, and (3) the court concluded that even if BASD’s policy \nviolated the plaintiffs’ right to privacy, the policy is permissible because it was narrowly tailored to serve a \ncompelling state interest. Defs.’ Resp. in Opp. to Pls.’ Mot. to Stay Proceedings at 3–5, Doc. No. 86. BASD also \ncontends that the plaintiffs have failed to explain how the Third Circuit’s decision related to the definition of “sex” \nin Title IX when the Third Circuit “specifically noted that it would view harassment by transgender and cisgender \nstudents  in  the  same  manner,”  id.  at  6  (citation  omitted),  and  explained  that  the  plaintiffs  failed  to  show \ndiscrimination when the policy was sex-neutral. Id. at 6–7 (citation omitted). BASD further points out that the \ndefinition of “sex” did not play a role in this court’s decision on the Title IX claim as this court also found the sex-\nneutral aspect of the policy to be “fatal” to any discrimination claim. Id. (citation omitted). BASD also notes that the \nplaintiffs never showed that they were excluded from or denied the benefits of any BASD education program on the \nbasis of sex. Id. at 7. \n  Concerning the remaining factors for the court’s consideration when deciding whether to stay a matter, \nBASD acknowledges that a stay would not prejudice it or transgender students insofar as the current policy would \nremain in effect. Id. at 8. In addition, none of the plaintiffs would be prejudiced because they can still use the \nalternate restrooms and locker rooms offered by BASD. Id. Yet, to the extent that the court would not find the \nbalance of harms to be neutral, BASD contends that there is some prejudice to it because it is seeking finality in this \nmatter and a stay only further prolongs the ultimate decision in this case. Id. \n  BASD also argues that even if the Supreme Court’s decisions would affect the decision in this case, there is \nno reason to preclude the parties from conducting discovery until the Supreme Court decides the Pending Cases. Id. \nat 9. BASD explains that since the court will decide the Pending Cases in less than a year, “there is no reason that \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01249-EGS   Document 89   Filed 09/05/19   Page 4 of 4\n                                                                                                                                                             \nthe parties in this case could not complete the necessary factual discovery to prepare for dispositive motions in the \nmeantime.” Id. \n  As for PYCF, it contends that judicial economy will not be served by waiting for the decision in R.G. & \nG.R. Harris Funeral Homes because the decision will not affect the ultimate outcome in this case. Br. of Intervenor-\nDef. Pa. Youth Congress Found. in Opp. to Pl.’s Mot. to Stay Proceedings at 4, Doc. No. 87. PYCF first points out \nthat the Third Circuit has already determined that this case presented a “very different issue” than whether Title IX \nprohibits discrimination against people because they are transgender. Id. at 5 (citation and internal question marks \nomitted). As such, the Third Circuit did not decide “whether Title IX’s prohibition against discrimination because of \nsex bars schools from discriminating against students because they are transgender.” Id. (citation omitted). In \naddition, PYCF indicates that the Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs’ petition for a writ of certiorari after granting \nthe petition in R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, and if the Court thought “that its decision in Harris Funeral \nHomes would alter the outcome here, it would have held Plaintiffs’ petition pending disposition of Harris Funeral \nHomes.” Id. at 5–6. \n  PYCF next argues that there is no guarantee that the Supreme Court will decide the meaning of “sex” or the \nlawfulness of sex-specific policies in R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes. Id. at 6. PYCF notes that the Court did \nnot grant certiorari on the question sought by the petitioner, i.e. “whether the word ‘sex’ . . . meant ‘gender identity’ \nand ‘included’ transgender status’ when Congress enacted Title VII in 1964.” Id. (first alteration omitted) (citation \nomitted). Instead, the Court framed the question as “[w]hether Title VII prohibits discrimination against transgender \npeople based on . . . their status as transgender . . . .” Id. (citation omitted). PYCF believes that resolution of this \nlatter question does not require the Court to decide what “sex” means in Title VII. Id. Additionally, PYCF argues \nthat the Court “is unlikely to resolve the lawfulness of sex-specific policies, such as dress codes and restrooms, or \nhow such rules apply to people who are transgender,” as the Court will only address whether Title VII prohibits \ndiscrimination against transgender people based on a sex-stereotyping theory under Price Waterhouse. Id. at 7. \n  For their final arguments that judicial economy does not favor a stay here, PYCF points out that this court’s \nresolution of the plaintiffs’ claims did not turn on the definition of “sex.” Id. at 7–8. In addition, PYCF notes that \nthis court has already spent significant resources moving this matter towards its ultimate resolution. Id. at 8. As for \nthe other factors in deciding whether to stay this case, PYCF argues that the length of the stay—possibly up to one \nyear—weighs against a stay and other courts have declined to stay matters where the requests were of similar \ndurations. Id. (citations omitted). Also, PYCF asserts that “[t]ransgenders at the high school should not have to wait \nan additional year before this litigation proceeds—a year in which a cloud of uncertainty hangs over their ability to \nlive openly and fully at school.” Id. \n  After reviewing the parties’ arguments, the plaintiffs have not met their burden to show that a stay is \nwarranted in this matter. While the court is appreciative of all parties’ desire to responsibly allocate resources, the \ncourt does not find that judicial economy favors a stay. It is unclear (and seemingly unlikely) that the Supreme \nCourt’s decisions in the Pending Cases will have any impact on this case. The court cannot discern how the Pending \nCases will impact the plaintiffs’ constitutional right to privacy claim. In addition, the Pending Cases do not appear to \naffect the Title IX claim, especially as, inter alia, this court and the Third Circuit determined that BASD policy \ncould not give rise to a Title IX claim because it targeted both sexes equally. The court also disagrees with the \nplaintiffs’ assertion that a Supreme Court decision that “sex” means sex at one’s birth would substantially change \nthe Third Circuit’s decision. For example, while the Third Circuit mentioned BASD’s contention that “barring \ntransgender students from using privacy facilities that align with their gender identity would, itself, constitute \ndiscrimination under a sex-stereotyping theory in violation of Title IX,” the Third Circuit did “not decide that very \ndifferent issue” as part of the appeal. Doe by and through Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 897 F.3d 518, 536 (3d \nCir. 2018) (footnotes omitted). Finally, decisions in the Pending Cases would appear to have no impact on the \nplaintiffs’ state-law tort claim. \n  Furthermore, the plaintiffs have not established that they will suffer any sort of hardship or inequity in \nhaving this matter move forward in discovery during the period that the Supreme Court will consider the three cases. \nFinally, while the plaintiffs’ counsel has kindly notified the court that the Supreme Court will hear oral argument on \nthe Pending Cases on October 8, 2019, there appears to be a distinct likelihood (as seemingly recognized by all \nparties) that any stay could last until June and that simply is too long of a period considering the distinct possibility \nthat the Court’s decisions will not impact any of the issues in this case. Accordingly, the motion for a stay is denied. \n4 \n ",

The plaintiffs—a group of high school students who \nidentify as being the same sex they were determined to have at \nbirth  (cisgender)—believe  the  policy  violated  their \nconstitutional rights of bodily privacy, as well as Title IX, and \nPennsylvania tort law. As we shall explain, we conclude that, \nunder  the  circumstances  here,  the  presence  of  transgender \nstudents in the locker and restrooms is no more offensive to \nconstitutional or Pennsylvania-law privacy interests than the \npresence of the other students who are not transgender. Nor \ndoes their presence infringe on the plaintiffs’ rights under Title \nIX. \n \nIn  an  exceedingly  thorough,  thoughtful,  and  well-\nreasoned  opinion,  the  District  Court  denied  the  requested \ninjunction based upon its conclusion that the plaintiffs had not \nshown that they are likely to succeed on the merits and because \nthey had not shown that they will be irreparably harmed absent \nthe  injunction.  Although  we  amplify  the  District  Court’s \nreasoning  because  of  the  interest  in  this  issue,  we  affirm \n6 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112992040     Page: 7      Date Filed: 07/26/2018\nsubstantially for the reasons set forth in the District Court’s \nopinion.  \n \nI.  BACKGROUND \nA.  The Setting. \n \nBecause such seemingly familiar terms as “sex” and \n“gender” can be misleading in the context of the issues raised \nby this litigation, we will begin by explaining and defining \nrelevant terms. Our explanation is based on the District Court \ntestimony  of  Dr.  Scott  Leibowitz,  an  expert  in  gender \ndysphoria  and  gender-identity  issues  in  children  and \nadolescents,  and  the  findings  that  the  District  Court  made \nbased upon that expert’s testimony. \n \n“Sex” is defined as the “anatomical and physiological \nprocesses that lead to or denote male or female.”1 Typically, \nsex is determined at birth based on the appearance of external \ngenitalia.2  \n \n“Gender”  is  a  “broader  societal  construct”  that \nencompasses how a “society defines what male or female is \nwithin a certain cultural context.”3A person’s gender identity \nis their subjective, deep-core sense of self as being a particular \ngender.4 As suggested by  the parenthetical  in our opening \nparagraph, “cisgender” refers to a person who identifies with \nthe sex that person was determined to have at birth.5 The term \n                                              \n1 App. 500. \n2 App. 375.  \n3 App. 500. \n4 App. 375. \n5 App. 393, 550. \n7 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112992040     Page: 8      Date Filed: 07/26/2018\n“transgender” refers to a person whose gender identity does not \nalign with the sex that person was determined to have at birth.6 \nA transgender boy is therefore a person who has a lasting, \npersistent male gender identity, though that person’s sex was \ndetermined to be female at birth.7 A transgender girl is a person \nwho has a lasting, persistent female gender identity though that \nperson’s sex was determined to be male at birth.8  \n \nApproximately 1.4 million adults—or 0.6 percent of the \nadult  population  of  the  United  States—identify  as \ntransgender.9 Transgender individuals may experience “gender \ndysphoria,”  which  is  characterized  by  significant  and \nsubstantial distress as a result of their birth-determined sex \nbeing  different  from  their  gender  identity.10 Treatment  for \nchildren and adolescents who experience gender dysphoria \nincludes social gender transition and physical interventions \nsuch as puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and sometimes \nsurgery.11  \n \n“Social  gender  transition”  refers  to  steps  that \ntransgender individuals take to present themselves as being the \ngender  they  most  strongly  identify  with. 12 This  typically \nincludes adopting a different name that is consistent with that \ngender  and  using  the  corresponding  pronoun  set,  wearing \nclothing and hairstyles typically associated with their gender \n                                              \n6 App. 375. \n7 App. 2107. \n8 App. 2107. \n9 App. 376. \n10 App. 376-77, 379. \n11 App. 2110. \n12 App. 2110. \n8 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112992040     Page: 9      Date Filed: 07/26/2018\nidentity rather than the sex they were determined to have at \nbirth, and using sex-segregated spaces and engaging in sex-\nsegregated activities that correspond to their gender identity \nrather  than  their  birth-determined  sex. 13  For  transgender \nindividuals, an important part of social gender transition is \nhaving  others  perceive  them  as  being  the  gender  the \ntransgender individual most strongly identifies with.14 Social \ngender transition can help alleviate gender dysphoria and is a \nuseful and important tool for clinicians to ascertain whether \nliving in the affirmed gender improves the psychological and \nemotional function of the individual.15  \n \nPolicies  that  exclude  transgender  individuals  from \nprivacy facilities that are consistent with their gender identities \n“have detrimental effects on the physical and mental health, \nsafety, and  well-being of transgender  individuals.”16 These \nexclusionary  policies  exacerbate  the  risk  of  “anxiety  and \ndepression,  low  self-esteem,  engaging  in  self-injurious \nbehaviors, suicide, substance use, homelessness, and eating \ndisorders  among  other  adverse  outcomes.” 17  The  risk  of \nsuccumbing  to  these  conditions  is  already  very  high  in \nindividuals  who  are  transgender.    In  a  survey  of  27,000 \ntransgender individuals, 40% reported a suicide attempt (a rate \n                                              \n13 App. 2110. \n14 App. 2110. \n15 App. 2111. \n16 Br. for Amici Curiae American Academy of Pediatrics, \nAmerican Medical Association, et al., 17.  \n17 Id. at 18 (quoting Am.

In initiating this policy, BASH adopted a \nvery careful process that included student-specific analysis. \nPermission was granted on a case-by-case basis.28  \n \n The  District  required  the  student  claiming  to  be \ntransgender to meet with counselors who were trained and \nlicensed  to  address  these  issues  and  the  counselors  often \nconsulted with additional counselors, principals, and school \nadministrators.29 Once a transgender student was approved to \nuse the bathroom or locker room that aligned with his or her \ngender identity, the student was required to use only those \n                                              \n24 App. 395. \n25 App. 396.  \n26 App. 397.   \n27 App. 625.   \n28 App. 604.  \n29 App. 638, 923–25.   \n12 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112992040     Page: 13      Date Filed: 07/26/2018\nfacilities.  The  student  could  no  longer  use  the  facilities \ncorresponding to that student’s sex at birth.30 \n \nBASH has several multi-user bathrooms.31 Each has \nindividual toilet stalls.32 Additionally, BASH has between four \nand  eight  single-user  restrooms  that  are  available  to  all \nstudents,  depending  on  the  time  of  day. 33 Four  of  these \nrestrooms are always available for student use.34 \n \nThe locker rooms at BASH consist of common areas, \nprivate “team rooms,” and shower facilities.35 Over the past \n(approximately) two years, BASH has renovated its locker \nrooms.

The Litigation. \n \nFour plaintiffs—proceeding pseudonymously under the \nnames Joel Doe, Jack Jones, Mary Smith, and Macy Roe—\nsued the District after it changed its bathroom and locker room \npolicy to the policy we have described above.39 Their claims \nwere based on encounters between some of the plaintiffs and \ntransgender students in locker rooms or multi-user bathrooms. \nThe plaintiffs sought to enjoin BASH’s policy of permitting \ntransgender students to use the bathrooms and locker rooms \nthat  aligned  with  their  gender  identities.  They  sought  a \npreliminary injunction on three grounds. First, the plaintiffs \nalleged  that  the  School  District’s  policy  violated  their \nconstitutional right to bodily privacy. Next, they claimed that \nthe School District’s policy violated Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972 (Title IX).40 Finally, they alleged that the \npolicy was contrary to Pennsylvania tort law. After discovery \nand evidentiary hearings, the District Court filed the extensive \nand well-reasoned opinion we have already referred  to, in \nwhich it explained that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated that \nthey were likely to succeed on the merits of any of their claims \nand that plaintiffs had not shown that they would be irreparably \nharmed absent an injunction.  \n \n                                              \n39  The plaintiffs included parents and guardians of some of \nthe anonymous students. The District Court provided a \ndetailed recitation of the factual background of this suit, \nincluding the particular conduct each plaintiff alleges as the \nbasis for the alleged violation of a privacy interest. See Doe v. \nBoyertown Area Sch. Dist., 276 F. Supp. 3d 324, 335–64 \n(E.D. Pa. 2017).   \n40 86 Stat. 373, as amended 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et. seq. \n14 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112992040     Page: 15      Date Filed: 07/26/2018\nFor reasons the court identified, it concluded that even \nif  the  School  District’s  policy  implicated  the  plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional  right  to  privacy,  the  state  had  a  compelling \ninterest in not discriminating against transgender students. The \ncourt also determined that the School District’s policy was \nnarrowly  tailored  to  serve  that  interest.  Accordingly,  the \nDistrict Court ruled that even if a cisgender plaintiff had been \nviewed by a transgender student, it would not have violated the \ncisgender student’s constitutional right to privacy. We agree. \n \nThe District Court rejected the plaintiffs’ Title IX claim \nfor two reasons. First, it found that the School District’s policy \ndid not discriminate on the basis of sex, because it applied \nequally to all students—cisgender male and cisgender female, \nas well as transgender male and transgender female students—\nalike. The court also  concluded that the plaintiffs had not \nidentified  any  conduct  that  was  sufficiently  serious  to \nconstitute  Title  IX  harassment.  The  mere  presence  of  a \ntransgender student in a locker room should not be objectively \noffensive to a reasonable person given the safeguards of the \nschool’s policy. \n \nFor essentially the reasons described above, the District \nCourt  also  declined  to  issue  an  injunction  based  on  the \nPennsylvania tort of intrusion upon seclusion. It found that \nthere was insufficient evidence in the record to demonstrate \nthat  a  transgender  student  ever  viewed  a  partially  clothed \nplaintiff, and that the presence of a transgender student would \nnot be highly offensive to a reasonable person.  \n \nThe  District  Court  rejected  the  plaintiffs’  theory  of \nirreparable harm that posited that the plaintiffs were being \nforced to give up a constitutional right to use segregated locker \n15 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112992040     Page: 16      Date Filed: 07/26/2018\nrooms  and  bathrooms.  It  noted  that  the  School  District \npermitted the students to use the locker room facilities “without \nlimitation.”41 Any student who was uncomfortable being in a \nstate of undress or going to the bathroom with transgender \nstudents could use the single-user bathrooms or team rooms \nthat BASH has made available.  \n \nHaving found that the plaintiffs had no likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits and did not face irreparable harm, the \nDistrict Court entered an order on August 25, 2017 denying the \ninjunction. This appeal followed.42 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                              \n41 Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 276 F. Supp. 3d at 410. \n42 Numerous amici filed briefs on behalf of the appellees, and \none group filed a brief on behalf of the appellants. At the \nconclusion of briefing we heard argument. Recognizing the \ntime-sensitive nature of this appeal and the concerns of all of \nthe parents and students in the School District, as well as the \nDistrict itself, we adjourned to conference to determine if a \nruling could be made from the bench. After conferencing, the \npanel voted to unanimously affirm the ruling of the District \nCourt. We announced that decision and entered an \naccompanying order. We now supplement that order with this \nopinion.  \n16 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112992040     Page: 17      Date Filed: 07/26/2018\nII. DISCUSSION43 \n \nPreliminary  injunctive  relief  is  an  “extraordinary \nremedy.”44 It may be granted only when the moving party \nshows “(1) a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that [the \nmovant] will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is denied; \n(3)  that  granting  preliminary  relief  will  not  result  in  even \ngreater harm to the nonmoving party; and (4) that the public \ninterest  favors  such  relief.”45 The  movants  must  establish \nentitlement to relief by clear evidence.46 We review the denial \nof a preliminary injunction for “an abuse of discretion, an error \nof law, or a clear mistake in the consideration of proof.”47 We \nexercise plenary review of the lower court’s conclusions of law \nbut review its findings of fact for clear error.48 \n \nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n \n  The  District  Court  correctly  concluded  that  the \nappellants were not entitled to an injunction because none of \ntheir claims are likely to succeed on the merits. \n \n1.  The  District  Court \ncorrectly concluded that \n                                              \n43 The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331 and 1343.

They assert that the District \nCourt (1) failed to recognize the “contours” of the right to \nprivacy;  (2)  failed  to  recognize  that  a  policy  opening  up \nfacilities to persons of the opposite sex necessarily violates that \nright;  (3)  erroneously  concluded  that  the  School  District’s \npolicy  advanced  a  compelling  interest;  and  (4)  incorrectly \nfound  that  the  policy  was  narrowly  tailored  to  serve  that \ninterest. We reject each of these arguments in turn. \n \nThe appellants’ challenge to the School District’s policy \nwas brought as a civil rights claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § \n1983. Section 1983 claims can succeed only if the underlying \nact—here, the alleged exposure of the  appellants’ partially \nclothed bodies to transgender students whose birth-determined \nsex  differed  from  the  appellants—violated  a  constitutional \nright.49 When a plaintiff’s § 1983  claim is premised  on a \nviolation of the constitutional right to privacy, it will succeed \n                                              \n49 Doe v.

Neither is persuasive. \n \nFirst, the appellants claim that their right to privacy was \nviolated because the policy permitted them to be viewed by \nmembers  of  the  opposite  sex  while  partially  clothed. 54 \nRegardless of the degree of the appellants’ undress at the time \nof the encounters, the District Court correctly found that this \nwould not give rise to a constitutional violation because the \nSchool  District’s  policy  served  a  compelling  interest—\npreventing discrimination against transgender students—and \nwas narrowly tailored to that interest.  \n                                              \nelementary self-respect and personal dignity.”). The District \nCourt noted that Doe v. Luzerne County did not explicitly \nhold there was a constitutional right to privacy in an \nindividual’s unclothed or partially clothed body. However, by \nconcluding that Doe had a reasonable expectation of privacy \nand remanding the case to determine the exact contours of \nthat right, we implicitly recognized that such a privacy right \nexists. The District Court assumed the existence of the right, \nand the parties seemingly agreed that the right exists. If there \nwere any doubt after Doe v. Luzerne County that the \nconstitution recognizes a right to privacy in a person’s \nunclothed or partially clothed body, we hold today that such a \nright exists.  \n54 See Br. for Appellants, 18 (“The privacy interest is vitiated \nwhen a member of one sex is viewed by a member of the \nopposite sex.” (citation omitted)). \n20 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112992040     Page: 21      Date Filed: 07/26/2018\n \nThe constitutional right to privacy is not absolute.55  It \nmust be weighed against important competing governmental \ninterests. 56  Only  unjustified  invasions  of  privacy  by  the \ngovernment are actionable in a § 1983 claim.57 That is, the \nconstitution  forbids  governmental  infringement  on  certain \nfundamental interests unless that infringement is sufficiently \ntailored  to serve a compelling state interest.58 The District \n                                              \n55 Doe v.

Moreover, as we have mentioned, those cisgender \nstudents  who  feel  that  they  must  try  to  limit  trips  to  the \nrestroom to avoid contact with transgender students can use the \nsingle-user bathrooms in the school.  \n \nAssuming the policy is subject to strict scrutiny, it must \nadvance a compelling state interest and the means of achieving \nthat interest  must be  “specifically  and narrowly framed  to \naccomplish  that  purpose.”70 Having  correctly  identified  a \ncompelling state interest, the District Court correctly held that \nthe  School  District’s  policy  was  narrowly  tailored.

To \nthe extent that the appellants are expressing discomfort being \naround students whom they define as different from \nthemselves, that discomfort does not implicate a privacy \ninterest, even when viewed through the lens of strict scrutiny.   \n \n70 Grutter, 539 U.S. at 333 (quoting Shaw v.

Any  student  who  is \nuncomfortable changing around their peers in private spaces, \nwhether transgender or cisgender, may change in a bathroom \nstall, single-user bathroom, or the private team rooms.73 The \nappellants  seemingly  admit  that  these  accommodations \n“resolve all privacy concerns.”74 Yet they insist that the policy \nshould be changed to require that transgender students use \nindividual bathrooms if they do not wish to use the communal \nfacilities that align with their birth-determined sex. Not only \nwould forcing transgender students to use single-user facilities \nor  those  that  correspond  to  their  birth  sex  not  serve  the \ncompelling interest that the School District has identified here, \nit would significantly undermine it.75 As the Court of Appeals \nfor  the  Seventh  Circuit  has  recognized,  a  school  district’s \npolicy that required a transgender student to use single-user \n                                              \n72 Id. \n73 App. 618–19.  \n74 Br. for Appellants, 32. \n75 See Br. for Amici Curiae American Academy of Pediatrics \net al., 17–18.

The challenged policy is \nnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. \nThere is no constitutional violation. \n \nThe appellants also urge us to recognize constitutional \nprivacy protections for alleged violations that resulted from \nconduct other than being viewed by transgender students in a \nlocker room or bathroom. They assert that “government actors \ncannot force minors to endure the risk of unconsented intimate \nexposure to the opposite sex as a condition for using the very \nfacilities set aside to protect their privacy.”77 They claim that \ntheir constitutional privacy rights were  violated “when the \n                                              \n76 Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1045. \n77 Br. for Appellants, 18 (emphasis added).  \n27 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112992040     Page: 28      Date Filed: 07/26/2018\nsexes intermingle[d]” in the bathrooms and locker rooms.78 \nThey also argue that the female appellants’ privacy rights are \nviolated if they are forced to attend to their menstrual hygiene \nin a facility where members of the opposite sex may potentially \nbe  present. 79  In  other  words,  they  contend  that  their \nconstitutional right to privacy is necessarily violated because \nthey are forced to share bathrooms and locker rooms with \ntransgender students whose gender identities correspond with \nthe sex-segregated space, but do not do not align with their \nbirth sex.  \n \nWe reject the premise of this argument because BASH’s \npolicy does not force any cisgender student to disrobe in the \npresence of any student—cisgender or transgender. BASH has \nprovided  facilities  for  any  student  who  does  not  feel \ncomfortable being in the confines of a communal restroom or \nlocker room. BASH has installed privacy stalls and set some \nbathrooms aside as single-user facilities so that any student \nwho is uneasy undressing or using a restroom in the presence \nof others can take steps to avoid contact. BASH’s policy does \nnot compel a privacy violation for any student. \n \n In any event, we decline to recognize such an expansive \nconstitutional right to privacy—a right that would be violated \nby the presence of students who do not share the same birth \nsex. Moreover, no court has ever done so. As counsel for the \nSchool District noted during oral argument, the appellants are \nclaiming a very broad right of personal privacy in a space that \n                                              \n78 Id. at 27. \n79 Id. at 26. We note that the appellants do not allege that the \nfemale plaintiffs ever actually tended to their periods in the \npresence of a transgender female student. \n28 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112992040     Page: 29      Date Filed: 07/26/2018\nis,  by  definition  and  common  usage,  just  not  that  private. \nSchool locker rooms and restrooms are spaces where it is not \nonly common to encounter others in various stages of undress, \nit is expected. The facilities exist so that students can attend to \ntheir personal biological and hygienic needs and change their \nclothing. As the Supreme Court has stated, “[p]ublic school \nlocker rooms . . . are not notable for the privacy they afford.”80  \n \nThus,  we  are  unpersuaded  to  the  extent  that  the \nappellants’ asserted privacy interest requires protection from \nthe risk of encountering students in a bathroom or locker room \nwhom appellants identify as being members of the opposite \nsex. As the Seventh Circuit noted in Whitaker “[a] transgender \nstudent’s presence in the restroom provides no more of a risk \nto other students’ privacy rights than the presence of an overly \ncurious student of the same biological sex who decides to \nsneak glances at his or her classmates performing their bodily \nfunctions.”81  \n \nNone  of  the  cases  cited  by  the  appellants  is  to  the \ncontrary. 82 For example, in their brief and at argument, they \nplaced  substantial  reliance  on  Faulkner  v.  Jones83 for  the \nproposition  that  “society  [has]  undisputed[ly]  approv[ed] \nseparate  public  restrooms  for  men  and  women  based  on \nprivacy concerns. The need for privacy justifies separation . . . \n.”84 But that case did not recognize a constitutional mandate \n                                              \n80 Veronia Sch. Dist. 47J v.

Although  it  acknowledged  that  privacy \nconcerns may justify separate facilities for men and women in \ncertain circumstances,85 it did not hold that the Constitution \ncompels separate bathroom facilities. Moreover, as we have \nexplained and as the District Court more thoroughly described, \nBASH has carefully crafted a policy that attempts to address \nthe concerns that some cisgender students may have. To its \ncredit, it has done so in a way that recognizes those concerns \nas well as the needs, humanity, and decency of transgender \nstudents.  \n \nThe  appellants’  reliance  on  Chaney  v.  Plainfield \nHealthcare Center86  is similarly unconvincing. That was an \nappeal from a Title VII suit brought against a nursing home \nafter  a  Black  nursing  assistant  was  fired  for  protesting  a \npatient’s demand that he receive care only from White nursing \naids.87 The court distinguished medical care based on race from \nmedical care based on sex, noting that just as “the law tolerates \nsame-sex  restrooms  or  same-sex  dressing  rooms  .  .  .  to \naccommodate privacy needs, Title VII allows an employer to \nrespect a preference for same-sex health providers, but not \nsame-race providers.”88 Like Faulkner, Chaney held that the \n                                              \n85 Faulkner, 10 F.3d at 232 (“In the end, distinctions in any \nseparate facilities provided for males and females may be \nbased on real differences between the sexes, both in quality \nand quantity, so long as the distinctions are not based on \nstereotyped or generalized perceptions of differences.”). \n86 612 F.3d 908, 913 (7th Cir. 2010). \n87 Chaney, 612 F.3d at 910–12. \n88 Id. at 913. \n30 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112992040     Page: 31      Date Filed: 07/26/2018\nConstitution tolerates single-sex accommodations. It did not \nhold that the constitution demands it. \n \nEqually  unpersuasive  is  the  appellants’  reliance  on \ncases discussing far more intrusive invasions of privacy than \nallowed by BASH’s policy. Cases about strip searches89 and a \ncriminal conviction for voyeurism after a person repeatedly \nlooked at women in the stalls of public restrooms90 are wholly \nunhelpful to our analysis. Those cases involve inappropriate \nconduct as well as conduct that intruded into far more “intimate \naspects of human affairs” than here.91 There is simply nothing \ninappropriate about transgender students using the restrooms \nor locker rooms that correspond to their gender identity under \nthe  policy  BASH  has  initiated,  and  we  reject  appellants’ \nattempt to argue that there is. Appellants do not contend that \ntransgender Students A or B did anything remotely out of the \nordinary while using BASH’s facilities. Indeed, the appellants’ \nprivacy complaint is not with transgender students’ conduct, \nbut with their mere presence. We have already explained that \nthe presence of transgender students in these spaces does not \noffend the constitutional right of privacy any more than the \npresence of cisgender students in those spaces.  \n \nIn an argument that completely misses (or deliberately \nignores) the reason for the disputed policy or the circumstances \nit addresses, the appellants insist that it is improper to consider \na student’s transgender status when conducting this privacy \n                                              \n89 Canedy v.

Constitutional right to privacy cases “necessarily \nrequire fact-intensive and context-specific analyses.”93 Bright \nline rules cannot be drawn.94 Put simply—the facts of a given \ncase  are  critically  important  when  assessing  whether  a \nconstitutional  right  to  privacy  has  been  violated.  A  case \ninvolving transgender students using facilities aligned with \ntheir gender identities after seeking and receiving approval \nfrom trained school counselors and administrators implicates \ndifferent privacy concerns than, for example, a case involving \nan  adult  stranger  sneaking  into  a  locker  room  to  watch  a \nfourteen year-old girl shower. The latter scenario—taken from \na case the appellants rely upon95— is simply not analogous to \nthe circumstances here.     \n \n2.  The  District  Court \ncorrectly concluded that \nthe appellants’ Title IX \nclaim  was  unlikely  to \nsucceed on the merits.  \n \nThe  District  Court  rejected  the  appellants’  Title  IX \nclaim because the School District’s policy treated all students \nequally and therefore did not discriminate on the basis of sex, \nand because the appellants had failed to meet the elements of a \n“hostile environment harassment” claim. We again agree. We \nalso  agree  with  the  School  District’s  position  that  barring \n                                              \n92 Br. for Appellants, 10–12.  \n93 Doe v.

An institution \n“may  provide  separate  toilet,  locker  room,  and  shower \nfacilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities provided for \nstudents  of  one  sex  shall  be  comparable  to  such  facilities \nprovided for students of the other sex.”97 This exception is \npermissive—Title  IX  does  not  require  that  an  institution \nprovide separate privacy facilities for the sexes.  \n \nTitle IX also supports a cause of action for “hostile \nenvironment harassment.”98 To recover on such a claim, a \nplaintiff must establish sexual harassment that is so severe, \npervasive, or objectively offensive and that “so undermines \nand detracts from the victims’ educational experience that [he \nor she] is effectively denied equal access to an institution’s \nresources and opportunities.”99 To support a claim of hostile \n                                              \n96 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n97 34 C.F.R. § 106.33. \n98 DeJohn v.

Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, \n81 (1998) (holding, in the Title VII context, that a plaintiff \n“must always prove that the conduct at issue . . . constituted \ndiscrimination because of . . . sex.” (internal quotations \nomitted)).  \n101 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. \n102 Saxe v. State College Area Sch. Dist., 240 F.3d 200, 205 \n(3d Cir. 2001).  \n103 Id. Courts have frequently looked to Title VII authority for \nguidance with Title IX cases. See, e.g., Olmstead v. L.C. ex \nrel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 616 n.1 (1999) (“This Court has \n34 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112992040     Page: 35      Date Filed: 07/26/2018\n \nTitle VII prohibits employers from discriminating based \non sex.104 In Oncale, the Supreme Court considered whether \nTitle VII prohibited “discrimination because of sex” when the \nharasser and the harassed employee were the same sex.105 In \nconcluding that Title VII could support such a claim, the Court \nheld that Title VII is concerned  only  with “discrimination \nbecause of sex.”106 It noted that the Court had never held that \n“workplace harassment, even harassment between men and \nwomen, is automatically discrimination because of sex merely \nbecause  the  words  used  have  sexual  content  or \nconnotations.”107 Rather, “the critical issue . . . is whether \nmembers of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or \nconditions of employment to which members of the other sex \nare not exposed.”108 The plaintiffs in a Title VII action must \ntherefore  always  “prove  that  the  conduct  at  issue  was  not \nmerely tinged with offensive sexual connotations, but actually \nconstituted  discrimination  because  of  sex.” 109  The  same \nrequirement holds true for Title IX claims. \n \nThe appellants have not provided any authority—either \nin the District Court or on appeal—to suggest that a sex-neutral \n                                              \nalso looked to its Title VII interpretations of discrimination in \nilluminating Title IX.” (collecting cases)). \n104 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2. \n105 Oncale, 523 U.S. at 76. \n106 Id. at 80. \n107 Id. \n108 Id. (quoting Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 25 \n(1993) (Ginsburg, J., concurring)).  \n109 Id. at 81 (internal alterations, emphasis, and quotation \nmarks omitted). \n35 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112992040     Page: 36      Date Filed: 07/26/2018\npolicy can give rise to a Title IX claim. Instead, they simply \nhypothesize that “harassment” that targets both sexes equally \nwould  violate Title IX; that is simply  not the law.110 The \ntouchstone of both Title VII and Title IX claims is disparate \ntreatment based on sex.111 The School District’s policy allows \nall students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that align with \ntheir gender identity. It does not discriminate based on sex, and \ntherefore does not offend Title IX.  \n \nThe  District  Court  also  correctly  found  that  the \nappellants had not met their burden of establishing that the \nmere presence of transgender students in bathrooms and locker \nrooms constitutes sexual harassment so severe, pervasive, or \nobjectively offensive and “that so undermines and detracts \nfrom the victims’ educational experience that [the plaintiff] is \neffectively denied equal access to an institution’s resources and \nopportunities.”112 That  is  particularly  true  given  the  many \n                                              \n110 See Pasqual v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 101 F.3d 514, 517 (7th \nCir. 1996) (“Harassment that is inflicted without regard to \ngender, that is, where males and females in the same setting \ndo not receive disparate treatment, is not actionable because \nthe harassment is not based on sex.”); Henson v. City of \nDundee, 682 F.2d 897, 904 (11th Cir. 1982) (“[T]here may be \ncases in which a supervisor makes sexual overtures of both \nsexes or where the conduct complained of is equally offensive \nto male and female workers. In such cases, [the] harassment \nwould not be based on sex because men and women are \naccorded like treatment . . . and the plaintiff would have no \nremedy under Title VII.”). \n111 Oncale, 523 U.S. at 80. \n112 DeJohn, 537 F.3d at 316 n.14 (citations omitted). \n36 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112992040     Page: 37      Date Filed: 07/26/2018\nsafeguards  the  School  District  put  in  place  as  part  of  the \nchallenged policy. \n \nRather  than  relying  on  relevant  legal  authority  to \nestablish that the mere presence of a transgender student in a \nlocker room or bathroom rises to the level of harassment, the \nappellants again cite inapposite cases that involve egregious \nharassment. That is not surprising since we have found no \nauthority that supports the appellants’ claims. Two cases that \nthe  appellants  attempt  to  analogize  to  their  situation  are \nparticularly illustrative of the weakness of their position—\nLewis  v.  Triborough  Bridge  and  Tunnel  Authority113 and \nSchonauer  v.  DCR  Entertainment  Inc. 114  Lewis  involved \nharassment that is worlds apart from anything in the present \nrecord. There, cisgender men not only entered a locker room \nwhile  cisgender  female  employees  were  changing,  they \n“leer[ed]” at them, “crowd[ed] the entrance to the locker room, \nforcing [them] to ‘run the gauntlet[,]’ and brush[ed] up against \nthem.”115 When a supervisor was informed, he referred to the \nfemale employees as “cunts” and “the biggest bunch of fucking \ncrybabies.” 116  Any  comparison  to  the  circumstances  the \nappellants face here is patently frivolous. \n \nSchonauer is also distinguishable. There, the plaintiff \nwas employed as a beverage server at a topless nightclub and \nalleged that she had been harassed by a manager.117  In addition \nto  entering  the  women’s  changing  facility,  the  manager \n                                              \n113 77 F. Supp. 2d 376, 377–78 (S.D.N.Y. 1999). \n114 905 P.2d 392, 396–97, 400–01 (Wash. Ct. App. 1995). \n115 77 F. Supp. 2d at 377. \n116 Id. at 378. \n117 Schonauer, 905 P.2d at 396. \n37 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112992040     Page: 38      Date Filed: 07/26/2018\nrepeatedly  encouraged  the  plaintiff  to  enter  nude  dance \ncontests,  asked  questions  about  her  sexual  fantasies,  and \nprobed her sexual history.118 When the plaintiff resisted these \nadvances, she was fired.119 The Washington Court of Appeals \nfound that this behavior could constitute harassment not simply \nbecause the manager entered the changing facility, but because \nhe  pressed  the  plaintiff  to  “provide  sexually  explicit \ninformation and to dance on stage in a sexually provocative \nway.”120  \n   \nThe District Court no doubt realized that the appellants’ \nattempt to seize upon Lewis and Schonauer demonstrated the \nweakness of their arguments.  Here, there are no allegations of \nharassment, let alone any that are even remotely as “severe, \npervasive, [or] objectively offensive.”121  Still, the appellants \nunconvincingly try to equate mere presence in a space with \nharassing activity.   \n \nThis case is far more analogous to Cruzan v. Special \nSchool Dist., No. 1,122 a Title VII case from the Court of \nAppeals for the Eighth Circuit. Cruzan held that a transgender \nindividual in a bathroom did not create a hostile environment \nbecause there was no evidence that the individual “engaged in \nany inappropriate conduct other than merely being present in \nthe  women’s  faculty  restroom.” 123 That  is,  a  transgender \n                                              \n118 Id. at 396–97.  \n119 Id. at 397. \n120 Id. at 400. \n121 DeJohn, 537 F.3d at 316 n.14; Castleberry, 863 F.3d at \n264. \n122 294 F.3d 981, 984 (8th Cir. 2002). \n123 Id.  \n38 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112992040     Page: 39      Date Filed: 07/26/2018\nperson in a restroom did not create an environment that was \n“permeated  with  discriminatory  intimidation,  ridicule,  and \ninsult” as required to sustain a harassment claim under Title \nVII.124 We agree with the Eight Circuit’s conclusion. As we \nhave  emphasized,  the  appellants’  real  objection  is  to  the \npresence of transgender students, not to any “environment” \ntheir presence creates. Indeed, the allegations here include an \nassertion that a cisgender student was harassed merely by a \ntransgender student washing that student’s own hands in a \nbathroom or changing in a locker room. That is not the type of \nconduct that supports a Title IX hostile environment claim.125 \nThe District Court recognized this and correctly ruled that this \nclaim was unlikely to succeed. \n \nThe School District, on the other hand, contends that \nbarring transgender students from using privacy facilities that \nalign  with  their  gender  identity  would,  itself,  constitute \ndiscrimination under a sex-stereotyping theory in violation of \nTitle IX.126 We need not decide that very different issue here. \nWe note only that in 2017, the Seventh Circuit held that a \nschool  district’s  policy  of  prohibiting  transgender  students \nfrom using bathrooms and locker rooms consistent with their \ngender  identity  violated  Title  IX  because  it  discriminated \nagainst transgender students by subjecting them to “different \nrules,  sanctions,  and  treatment  than  non-transgender \n                                              \n124 Id. (citation omitted). \n125 This is not to say that the transgender students could not \nengage in conduct that would rise to the level of harassment. \nIt would be the same conduct required for cisgender students \nto harass someone. \n126 Br. for Appellees, 38–40.  \n39 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112992040     Page: 40      Date Filed: 07/26/2018\nstudents.”127 The injunction that the plaintiffs have requested \nhere would essentially replicate the policy used by the school \ndistrict in Whitaker by Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified School \nDistrict.  Hence,  BASH  can  hardly  be  faulted  for  being \nproactive in adopting a policy that avoids the issues that may \notherwise have occurred under Title IX. \n \nWe  therefore  hold  that  the  District  Court  correctly \ndeclined to issue an injunction based on the appellants’ Title \nIX claim.  \n3.  The  District  Court \ncorrectly concluded that \nthe appellants’ state law \ntort claim was unlikely \nto succeed on the merits.  \n \n  Finally, the appellants contend that the District Court \nerred in denying the injunction as to their Pennsylvania-law \ntort  claim  for  intrusion  upon  seclusion.  Pennsylvania  has \nadopted  the  Second  Restatement  of  Torts’  definition  of \nintrusion upon seclusion: \n \nOne  who  intentionally  intrudes, \nphysically or otherwise, upon the \nsolitude or seclusion of another or \nhis private affairs or concerns, is \nsubject to the other for invasion of \nhis privacy, if the intrusion would \n                                              \n127 Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1050. \n40 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112992040     Page: 41      Date Filed: 07/26/2018\nbe highly offensive to a reasonable \nperson.128 \n  \nIn denying this claim, the District Court concluded that the \nmere presence of a transgender individual in a bathroom or \nlocker room is not the type of conduct that would be highly \noffensive to a reasonable person. As we have noted, students \nin a locker room expect to see other students in varying stages \nof undress, and they expect that other students will see them in \nvarying stages of undress. We will affirm the District Court’s \nrejection of the appellants’ tort claim.  \n \nB.  Irreparable Harm \n \nIn addition to finding that the appellants were unlikely \nto succeed on the merits of their claims, the District Court \ndenied injunctive relief because they had not demonstrated that \nthe failure to issue an injunction would result in irreparable \nharm. The District Court found that: \nOn a practical level . . . the privacy \nprotections  that  are  in  place  at \nBASH,  which  include  the \nbathroom stalls and shower stalls \nin the locker rooms, the bathroom \nstalls in the multi-user bathrooms, \nthe  availability  of  a  number  of \nsingle-user  bathrooms  (a  few  of \nwhich will have lockers for storing \nitems), the [ability] of students to \n                                              \n128 Tagouma v. Investigative Consultant Servs, Inc., 4 A.3d \n170, 174 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2010) (quoting Restatement (Second) \nof Torts § 652B (1965)). \n41 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112992040     Page: 42      Date Filed: 07/26/2018\nstore personal items in their locker \nor leave those items with the gym \nteacher, and the availability of the \nteam rooms in the  locker  rooms \n(which would not involve students \npassing through the common area \nof the locker room), and the overall \nwillingness  of  the  [appellees]  to \nwork with the students and their \nfamilies to assure that the students \nare  comfortable  at  BASH, \nmitigates  against  a  finding  of \nirreparable harm. . . . The privacy \nprotections available to students in \n2017-18 are more than suitable to \naddress  any  privacy  concerns \nrelating  to  the  presence  of \ntransgender students in the locker \nrooms and bathrooms at BASH.129  \n \n  We  agree  that  the  appellants  did  not  demonstrate \nirreparable harm would result from denying an injunction. The \nSchool District has provided adequate privacy facilities for the \nappellants to use during this litigation. Even if the appellants \ncould otherwise succeed on one or more of their claims (and, \nas explained above, we do not suggest that they can), the \nsingle-user facilities ensure that no appellant faces irreparable \nharm in the meantime.  \n                                              \n129 Doe v.

CONCLUSION \n \nThe Boyertown Area School District has adopted a very \nthoughtful and carefully tailored policy in an attempt to address \nsome very real issues while faithfully discharging its obligation \nto  maintain  a  safe  and  respectful  environment  in  which \neveryone can both learn and thrive.   \n \nThe  District  Court  correctly  concluded  that  the \nappellants’ attempt to enjoin that policy based on an alleged \nviolation of their privacy rights and their rights under Title IX \nand Pennsylvania tort law is not likely to succeed on the merits. \nThe District Court was also correct in deciding that denying the \ninjunction would not irreparably harm the appellants. For the \nreasons set forth above and in the well-reasoned District Court \nopinion,  we  will  affirm  the  District  Court’s  denial  of  the \nrequested preliminary injunction.  \n43 \n ",

The plaintiffs—a group of high school students who \nidentify as being the same sex they were determined to have at \nbirth  (cisgender)  —believe  the  policy  violated  their \nconstitutional rights of bodily privacy, as well as Title IX, and \nPennsylvania tort law. As we shall explain, we conclude that, \nunder  the  circumstances  here,  the  presence  of  transgender \nstudents in the locker and restrooms is no more offensive to \nconstitutional or Pennsylvania-law privacy interests than the \n3 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112959135     Page: 4      Date Filed: 06/18/2018\npresence of the other students who are not transgender. Nor \ndoes their presence infringe on the plaintiffs’ rights under Title  \nIX. \n \nIn  an  exceedingly  thorough,  thoughtful,  and  well-\nreasoned  opinion,  the  District  Court  denied  the  requested \ninjunction based upon its conclusion that the plaintiffs had not \nshown that they are likely to succeed on the merits and because \nthey had not shown that they will be irreparably harmed absent \nthe  injunction.  Although  we  amplify  the  District  Court’s \nreasoning  because  of  the  interest  in  this  issue,  we  affirm \nsubstantially for the reasons set forth in the District Court’s \nopinion.  \n \nI.  BACKGROUND \nA.  The Setting. \n \nBecause such seemingly familiar terms as “sex” and \n“gender” can be misleading in the context of the issues raised \nby this litigation, we will begin by explaining and defining \nrelevant terms. Our explanation is based on the District Court \ntestimony  of  Dr.  Scott  Leibowitz,  an  expert  in  gender \ndysphoria  and  gender-identity  issues  in  children  and \nadolescents,  and  the  findings  that  the  District  Court  made \nbased upon that expert’s testimony. \n \n“Sex” is defined as the “anatomical and physiological \nprocesses that lead to or denote male or female.”1 Typically, \nsex is determined at birth based on the appearance of external \ngenitalia.2  \n \n“Gender”  is  a  “broader  societal  construct”  that \nencompasses how a “society defines what male or female is \nwithin a certain cultural context.”3A person’s gender identity \nis their subjective, deep-core sense of self as being a particular \ngender.4 As  suggested  by  the  parenthetical  in  our opening \nparagraph, “cisgender” refers to a person who identifies with \n                                              \n1 App. 500. \n2 App. 375.  \n3 App. 500. \n4 App. 375. \n4 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112959135     Page: 5      Date Filed: 06/18/2018\nthe sex that person was determined to have at birth.5 The term \n“transgender” refers to a person whose gender identity does not \nalign with the sex that person was determined to have at birth.6 \nA transgender boy is therefore a person who has a lasting, \npersistent male gender identity, though that person’s sex was \ndetermined to be female at birth.7 A transgender girl is a person \nwho has a lasting, persistent female gender identity though that \nperson’s sex was determined to be male at birth.8  \n \nApproximately 1.4 million adults—or 0.6 percent of the \nadult  population  of  the  United  States—identify  as \ntransgender. 9  Transgender  individuals  may  experience \n“gender dysphoria,” which is characterized by significant and \nsubstantial distress as a result of their birth-determined sex \nbeing  different  from  their  gender  identity.10 Treatment  for \nchildren  and  adolescents  who  experience  gender  dysphoria \nincludes social gender transition and physical interventions \nsuch as puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and sometimes \nsurgery.11  \n \n“Social  gender  transition”  refers  to  steps  that \ntransgender individuals take to present themselves as being the \ngender  they  most  strongly  identify  with. 12 This  typically \nincludes adopting a different name that is consistent with that \ngender  and  using  the  corresponding  pronoun  set,  wearing \nclothing and hairstyles typically associated with their gender \nidentity rather than the sex they were determined to have at \nbirth, and using sex-segregated spaces and engaging in sex-\nsegregated activities that correspond to their gender identity \nrather  than  their  birth-determined  sex. 13  For  transgender \nindividuals, an important part of social gender transition is \nhaving  others  perceive  them  as  being  the  gender  the \n                                              \n5 App. 393, 550. \n6 App. 375. \n7 App. 2107. \n8 App. 2107. \n9 App. 376. \n10 App. 376-77, 379. \n11 App. 2110. \n12 App. 2110. \n13 App. 2110. \n5 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112959135     Page: 6      Date Filed: 06/18/2018\ntransgender individual most strongly identifies with.14 Social \ngender transition can help alleviate gender dysphoria and is a \nuseful and important tool for clinicians to ascertain whether \nliving in the affirmed gender improves the psychological and \nemotional function of the individual.15  \n \nPolicies  that  exclude  transgender  individuals  from \nprivacy facilities that are consistent with their gender identities \n“have detrimental effects on the physical and mental health, \nsafety,  and  well-being  of  transgender  individuals.”16 These \nexclusionary  policies  exacerbate  the  risk  of  “anxiety  and \ndepression,  low  self-esteem,  engaging  in  self-injurious \nbehaviors, suicide, substance use, homelessness, and eating \ndisorders  among  other  adverse  outcomes.” 17  The  risk  of \nsuccumbing  to  these  conditions  is  already  very  high  in \nindividuals  who  are  transgender.    In  a  survey  of  27,000 \ntransgender individuals, 40% reported a suicide attempt (a rate \nnine times higher than the general population).18 Yet, when \ntransgender students are addressed with gender appropriate \npronouns and permitted to use facilities that conform to their \ngender  identity,  those  students  “reflect  the  same,  healthy \npsychological profile as their peers.”19 \n \nForcing transgender students to use bathrooms or locker \nrooms that do not match their gender identity is particularly \nharmful. It causes “severe psychological distress often leading \n                                              \n14 App. 2110. \n15 App. 2111. \n16 Br. for Amici Curiae American Academy of Pediatrics, \nAmerican Medical Association, et al., 17.  \n17 Id. at 18 (quoting Am.

In initiating this policy, BASH adopted a \nvery careful process that included student-specific analysis. \nPermission was granted on a case-by-case basis.28  \n \n The  District  required  the  student  claiming  to  be \ntransgender to meet with counselors who were trained and \nlicensed  to  address  these  issues  and  the  counselors  often \nconsulted with additional counselors, principals, and school \nadministrators.29 Once a transgender student was approved to \nuse the bathroom or locker room that aligned with his or her \ngender identity, the student was required to use only those \nfacilities.  The  student  could  no  longer  use  the  facilities \ncorresponding to that student’s sex at birth.30 \n \nBASH has several multi-user bathrooms.31 Each has \nindividual toilet stalls.32 Additionally, BASH has between four \nand  eight  single-user  restrooms  that  are  available  to  all \n                                              \n24 App. 395. \n25 App. 396.  \n26 App. 397.   \n27 App. 625.   \n28 App. 604.  \n29 App. 638, 923–25.   \n30 App. 931–32. \n31 App. 612. \n32 App. 612–13.  \n8 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112959135     Page: 9      Date Filed: 06/18/2018\nstudents,  depending  on  the  time  of  day. 33 Four  of  these \nrestrooms are always available for student use.34 \n \nThe locker rooms at BASH consist of common areas, \nprivate “team rooms,” and shower facilities.35 Over the past \n(approximately) two  years, BASH has renovated its locker \nrooms. The “gang showers” were replaced with single-user \nshowers which have privacy curtains.36 BASH does not require \na student to change in the locker room prior to gym class, \nalthough the student must change into gym clothes.37 A student \nwho is uncomfortable changing in the locker room can change \nprivately in one of the single-user facilities, the private shower \nstalls, or team rooms.38 \n \nB. The Litigation. \n \nFour plaintiffs—proceeding pseudonymously under the \nnames Joel Doe, Jack Jones, Mary Smith, and Macy Roe—\nsued the District after it changed its bathroom and locker room \npolicy to the policy we have described above.39 Their claims \nwere based on encounters between some of the plaintiffs and \ntransgender students in locker rooms or multi-user bathrooms. \nThe plaintiffs sought to enjoin BASH’s policy of permitting \ntransgender students to use the bathrooms and locker rooms \nthat  aligned  with  their  gender  identities.  They  sought  a \npreliminary injunction on three grounds. First, the plaintiffs \nalleged  that  the  School  District’s  policy  violated  their \nconstitutional right to bodily privacy. Next, they claimed that \nthe School District’s policy violated Title IX of the Education \n                                              \n33 App. 613. \n34 App. 616. \n35 App. 617–19.  \n36 App. 619–20.  \n37 App. 618–19  \n38 App. 618–19.   \n39  The plaintiffs included parents and guardians of some of \nthe anonymous students. The District Court provided a \ndetailed recitation of the factual background of this suit, \nincluding the particular conduct each plaintiff alleges as the \nbasis for the alleged violation of a privacy interest. See Doe v. \nBoyertown Area Sch. Dist., 276 F. Supp. 3d 324, 335–64 \n(E.D. Pa. 2017).   \n9 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112959135     Page: 10      Date Filed: 06/18/2018\nAmendments of 1972 (Title IX).40 Finally, they alleged that the \npolicy was contrary to Pennsylvania tort law. After discovery \nand evidentiary hearings, the District Court filed the extensive \nand well-reasoned  opinion  we  have already  referred  to,  in \nwhich it explained that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated that \nthey were likely to succeed on the merits of any of their claims \nand that plaintiffs had not shown that they would be irreparably \nharmed absent an injunction.  \n \nFor reasons the court identified, it concluded that even \nif  the  School  District’s  policy  implicated  the  plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional  right  to  privacy,  the  state  had  a  compelling \ninterest in not discriminating against transgender students. The \ncourt also determined that the School District’s policy was \nnarrowly  tailored  to  serve  that  interest.  Accordingly,  the \nDistrict Court ruled that even if a cisgender plaintiff had been \nviewed by a transgender student, it would not have violated the \ncisgender student’s constitutional right to privacy. We agree. \n \nThe District Court rejected the plaintiffs’ Title IX claim \nfor two reasons. First, it found that the School District’s policy \ndid not discriminate on the basis of sex, because it applied \nequally to all students—cisgender male and cisgender female, \nas well as transgender male and transgender female students—\nalike.  The  court  also  concluded that  the plaintiffs  had  not \nidentified  any  conduct  that  was  sufficiently  serious  to \nconstitute  Title  IX  harassment.  The  mere  presence  of  a \ntransgender student in a locker room should not be objectively \noffensive to a reasonable person given the safeguards of the \nschool’s policy. \n \nFor essentially the reasons described above, the District \nCourt  also  declined  to  issue  an  injunction  based  on  the \nPennsylvania tort of intrusion upon seclusion. It found that \nthere was insufficient evidence in the record to demonstrate \nthat  a  transgender  student  ever  viewed  a  partially  clothed \nplaintiff, and that the presence of a transgender student would \nnot be highly offensive to a reasonable person.  \n \nThe  District  Court  rejected  the  plaintiffs’  theory  of \nirreparable harm that posited that the plaintiffs were being \n                                              \n40 86 Stat. 373, as amended 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et. seq. \n10 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112959135     Page: 11      Date Filed: 06/18/2018\nforced to give up a constitutional right to use segregated locker \nrooms  and  bathrooms.  It  noted  that  the  School  District \npermitted the students to use the locker room facilities “without \nlimitation.”41 Any student who was uncomfortable being in a \nstate of undress or going to the bathroom with transgender \nstudents could use the single-user bathrooms or team rooms \nthat BASH has made available.  \n \nHaving found that the plaintiffs had no likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits and did not face irreparable harm, the \nDistrict Court entered an order on August 25, 2017 denying the \ninjunction. This appeal followed.42 \n \nII. DISCUSSION43 \n \nPreliminary  injunctive  relief  is  an  “extraordinary \nremedy.”44 It may be granted only when the moving party \nshows “(1) a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that [the \nmovant] will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is denied; \n(3)  that  granting  preliminary  relief  will  not  result  in  even \ngreater harm to the nonmoving party; and (4) that the public \ninterest  favors  such  relief.”45 The  movants  must  establish \nentitlement to relief by clear evidence.46 We review the denial \n                                              \n41 Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 276 F. Supp. 3d at 410. \n42 Numerous amici filed briefs on behalf of the appellees, and \none group filed a brief on behalf of the appellants. At the \nconclusion of briefing we heard argument. Recognizing the \ntime-sensitive nature of this appeal and the concerns of all of \nthe parents and students in the School District, as well as the \nDistrict itself, we adjourned to conference to determine if a \nruling could be made from the bench. After conferencing, the \npanel voted to unanimously to affirm the ruling of the District \nCourt. We announced that decision and entered an \naccompanying order. We now supplement that order with this \nopinion.  \n43 The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331 and 1343. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1292(a)(1). \n44 Kos Pharm., Inc. v. Andrx Corp., 369 F.3d 700, 708 (3d \nCir. 2004).  \n45 Id. \n46 Winter v. Natural Res. Def.

Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n \n  The  District  Court  correctly  concluded  that  the \nappellants were not entitled to an injunction because none of \ntheir claims are likely to succeed on the merits. \n \nThe District Court correctly \nconcluded  that  the \nappellants’  constitutional \nright to privacy claim was \nunlikely to succeed on the \nmerits. \n \nThe  appellants  contend  that  the  District  Court \nerroneously concluded they were unlikely to succeed on their \nclaim  that  the  School  District’s  policy  violated  their \nconstitutional right to privacy. They assert that the District \nCourt (1) failed to recognize the “contours” of the right to \nprivacy;  (2)  failed  to  recognize  that  a  policy  opening  up \nfacilities to persons of the opposite sex necessarily violates that \nright;  (3)  erroneously  concluded  that  the  School  District’s \npolicy  advanced  a  compelling  interest;  and  (4)  incorrectly \nfound  that  the  policy  was  narrowly  tailored  to  serve  that \ninterest. We reject each of these arguments in turn. \n \nThe appellants’ challenge to the School District’s policy \nwas brought as a civil rights claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § \n1983. Section 1983 claims can succeed only if the underlying \nact—here, the  alleged exposure of the appellants’ partially \nclothed bodies to transgender students whose birth-determined \nsex  differed  from  the  appellants—violated  a  constitutional \nright.49 When  a  plaintiff’s  §  1983  claim  is  premised  on  a \n                                              \n47 Kos Pharm., 369 F.3d at 708 (citation omitted). \n48 Id.

SEPTA, 72 F.3d 1133, 1137 (3d Cir. 1995) (“A § \n1983 action cannot be maintained unless the underlying act \nviolates a plaintiff’s [c]onstitutional rights.”).  \n12 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112959135     Page: 13      Date Filed: 06/18/2018\nviolation of the constitutional right to privacy, it will succeed \nonly  if  it  is  “limited  to  those  rights  of  privacy  which  are \nfundamental or implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.”50  \n \nThe touchstone of constitutional privacy protection is \nwhether the information at issue is “within an individual’s \nreasonable  expectations  of  confidentiality.”51 The  Supreme \nCourt has acknowledged two types of constitutional privacy \ninterests  rooted  in  the  Fourteenth  Amendment—“the \nindividual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters” \nand the “interest in independence in making certain kinds of \nimportant decisions.” 52 Based on the first principal described \nabove,  we  have  held  that  a  person  has  a  constitutionally \nprotected privacy interest in his or her partially clothed body.53  \n                                              \n50 Id.

School Bd., 516 F.3d \n489, 494, 498 (6th Cir. 2008) (finding a violation of the \nFourth Amendment right to privacy when a school surveilled \npartially clothed middle school students in their locker room, \nand further noting that this is the “same privacy right . . . \nlocated in the Due Process clause”); Poe v. Leonard, 282 F.3d \n123, 136 (2d Cir. 2002) (“[T]here is a right to privacy in \none’s unclothed or partially clothed body.”); York v. Story, \n324 F.2d 450, 455 (9th Cir. 1963) (“We cannot conceive of a \nmore basic subject of privacy than the naked body. The desire \nto shield one’s unclothed [figure] from view of strangers, and \nparticularly strangers of the opposite sex, is impelled by \nelementary self-respect and personal dignity.”). The District \nCourt noted that Doe v. Luzerne County did not explicitly \nhold there was a constitutional right to privacy in an \nindividual’s unclothed or partially clothed body. However, by \nconcluding that Doe had a reasonable expectation of privacy \nand remanding the case to determine the exact contours of \nthat right, we implicitly recognized that such a privacy right \nexists. The District Court assumed the existence of the right, \nand the parties seemingly agreed that the right exists. If there \n13 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112959135     Page: 14      Date Filed: 06/18/2018\nThe appellants advance two main arguments in support \nof their contention that their right to privacy was violated by \nthe School District’s policy of permitting transgender students \nto use bathrooms and locker rooms that aligned with their \ngender identities. Neither is persuasive. \n \nFirst, the appellants claim that their right to privacy was \nviolated because the policy permitted them to be viewed by \nmembers  of  the  opposite  sex  while  partially  clothed. 54 \nRegardless of the degree of the appellants’ undress at the time \nof the encounters, the District Court correctly found that this \nwould not give rise to a constitutional violation because the \nSchool  District’s  policy  served  a  compelling  interest—\npreventing discrimination against transgender students—and \nwas narrowly tailored to that interest.  \n \nThe constitutional right to privacy is not absolute.55  It \nmust be weighed against important competing governmental \ninterests. 56  Only  unjustified  invasions  of  privacy  by  the \ngovernment are actionable in a § 1983 claim.57 That is, the \nconstitution  forbids  governmental  infringement  on  certain \nfundamental interests unless that infringement is sufficiently \n                                              \nwere any doubt after Doe v. Luzerne County that the \nconstitution recognizes a right to privacy in a person’s \nunclothed or partially clothed body, we hold today that such a \nright exists.  \n54 See Br. for Appellants, 18 (“The privacy interest is vitiated \nwhen a member of one sex is viewed by a member of the \nopposite sex.” (citation omitted)). \n55 Doe v.

SEPTA, 72 F.3d at 1138 (citing Whalen v. Roe, \n429 U.S. 589, 602 (1977)); see also Olmstead v.

There can be “no denying \nthat transgender individuals face discrimination, harassment, \nand violence because of their gender identity.”60 The risk of \nexperiencing substantial clinical distress as a result of gender \ndysphoria  is  particularly  high  among  children  and  may \nintensify during puberty.61 The Supreme Court has regularly \nheld that the state has a compelling interest in protecting the \nphysical and psychological well-being of minors.62 We have \n                                              \n58 Reno v.

The \nappellants contend that “a much more tailored solution is to \nprovide single-user accommodations.”71 They reason that “all \nstudents would be allowed to access the individual facilities, \n[so]  no  stigma  would  attach  to  the  professed  transgender \nstudents’  using  them,  and  preserving  the  sex-specific \ncommunal facilities to single-sex use would resolve all privacy \nconcerns.”72  \n \nThis  argument  is  not  only  unpersuasive,  it  fails  to \ncomprehend the depths of the problems the School District’s \npolicy was trying to remedy or the steps taken to address them. \nThe  School  District  already  provides  single-user \naccommodations  for  all  students.  Any  student  who  is \nuncomfortable changing around their peers in private spaces, \nwhether transgender or cisgender, may change in a bathroom \nstall, single-user bathroom, or the private team rooms.73 The \nappellants  seemingly  admit  that  these  accommodations \n“resolve all privacy concerns.”74 Yet they insist that the policy \nshould be changed to require that transgender students use \nindividual bathrooms if they do not wish to use the communal \nfacilities that align with their birth-determined sex. Not only \nwould forcing transgender students to use single-user facilities \nor  those  that  correspond  to  their  birth  sex  not  serve  the \ncompelling interest that the School District has identified here, \nit would significantly undermine it.75 As the Court of Appeals \n                                              \n70 Grutter, 539 U.S. at 333 (quoting Shaw v.

The challenged policy is \nnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. \nThere is no constitutional violation. \n \nThe appellants also urge us to recognize constitutional \nprivacy protections for alleged violations that resulted from \nconduct other than being viewed by transgender students in a \nlocker room or bathroom. They assert that “government actors \ncannot force minors to endure the risk of unconsented intimate \nexposure to the opposite sex as a condition for using the very \nfacilities set aside to protect their privacy.”77 They claim that \ntheir  constitutional  privacy  rights were  violated  “when the \nsexes intermingle[d]” in the bathrooms and locker rooms.78 \nThey also argue that the female appellants’ privacy rights are \nviolated if they are forced to attend to their menstrual hygiene \nin a facility where members of the opposite sex may potentially \n                                              \nfacilities sends a stigmatizing message that can have a lasting \nand damaging impact on the health and well-being of the \nyoung person.”). \n76 Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1045. \n77 Br. for Appellants, 18 (emphasis added).  \n78 Id. at 27. \n19 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112959135     Page: 20      Date Filed: 06/18/2018\nbe  present. 79  In  other  words,  they  contend  that  their \nconstitutional right to privacy is necessarily violated because \nthey are forced to share bathrooms and locker rooms with \ntransgender students whose gender identities correspond with \nthe sex-segregated space, but do not do not align with their \nbirth sex.  \n \nWe reject the premise of this argument because BASH’s \npolicy does not force any cisgender student to disrobe in the \npresence of any student—cisgender or transgender. BASH has \nprovided  facilities  for  any  student  who  does  not  feel \ncomfortable being in the confines of a communal restroom or \nlocker room. BASH has installed privacy stalls and set some \nbathrooms aside as single-user facilities so that any student \nwho is uneasy undressing or using a restroom in the presence \nof others can take steps to avoid contact. BASH’s policy does \nnot compel a privacy violation for any student. \n \n In any event, we decline to recognize such an expansive \nconstitutional right to privacy—a right that would be violated \nby the presence of students who do not share the same birth \nsex. Moreover, no court has ever done so. As counsel for the \nSchool District noted during oral argument, the appellants are \nclaiming a very broad right of personal privacy in a space that \nis,  by  definition  and  common  usage,  just  not  that  private. \nSchool locker rooms and restrooms are spaces where it is not \nonly common to encounter others in various stages of undress, \nit is expected. The facilities exist so that students can attend to \ntheir personal biological and hygienic needs and change their \nclothing. As the Supreme Court has stated, “[p]ublic school \nlocker rooms . . . are not notable for the privacy they afford.”80  \n \nThus,  we  are  unpersuaded  to  the  extent  that  the \nappellants’ asserted privacy interest requires protection from \nthe risk of encountering students in a bathroom or locker room \nwhom appellants identify as being members of the opposite \nsex. As the Seventh Circuit noted in Whitaker “[a] transgender \nstudent’s presence in the restroom provides no more of a risk \n                                              \n79 Id. at 26.

Jones83 for  the \nproposition  that  “society  [has]  undisputed[ly]  approv[ed] \nseparate  public  restrooms  for  men  and  women  based  on \nprivacy concerns. The need for privacy justifies separation . . . \n.”84 But that case did not recognize a constitutional mandate \nthat bathrooms and locker rooms must be segregated by birth-\ndetermined  sex.  Although  it  acknowledged  that  privacy \nconcerns may justify separate facilities for men and women in \ncertain circumstances,85 it did not hold that the Constitution \ncompels separate bathroom facilities. Moreover, as we have \nexplained and as the District Court more thoroughly described, \nBASH has carefully crafted a policy that attempts to address \nthe concerns that some cisgender students may have. To its \ncredit, it has done so in a way that recognizes those concerns \nas well as the needs, humanity, and decency of transgender \nstudents.  \n \nThe  appellants’  reliance  on  Chaney  v.  Plainfield \nHealthcare Center86  is similarly unconvincing. That was an \nappeal from a Title VII suit brought against a nursing home \nafter  a  Black  nursing  assistant  was  fired  for  protesting  a \npatient’s demand that he receive care only from White nursing \naids.87 The court distinguished medical care based on race \n                                              \n81 Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1052. \n82 Br. for Appellee, 15–31.  \n83 10 F.3d 226 (4th Cir. 1993). \n84 Br. for Appellants, 17 (alterations added) (quoting \nFaulkner, 10 F.3d at 232). \n85 Faulkner, 10 F.3d at 232 (“In the end, distinctions in any \nseparate facilities provided for males and females may be \nbased on real differences between the sexes, both in quality \nand quantity, so long as the distinctions are not based on \nstereotyped or generalized perceptions of differences.”). \n86 612 F.3d 908, 913 (7th Cir. 2010). \n87 Chaney, 612 F.3d at 910–12. \n21 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112959135     Page: 22      Date Filed: 06/18/2018\nfrom medical care based on sex, noting that just as “the law \ntolerates same-sex restrooms or same-sex dressing rooms . . . \nto accommodate privacy needs, Title VII allows an employer \nto respect a preference for same-sex health providers, but not \nsame-race providers.”88 Like Faulkner, Chaney held that the \nConstitution tolerates single-sex accommodations. It did not \nhold that the constitution demands it. \n \nEqually  unpersuasive  is  the  appellants’  reliance  on \ncases discussing far more intrusive invasions of privacy than \nallowed by BASH’s policy. Cases about strip searches89 and a \ncriminal conviction for voyeurism after a person repeatedly \nlooked at women in the stalls of public restrooms90 are wholly \nunhelpful to our analysis. Those cases involve inappropriate \nconduct as well as conduct that intruded into far more “intimate \naspects of human affairs” than here.91 There is simply nothing \ninappropriate about transgender students using the restrooms \nor locker rooms that correspond to their gender identity under \nthe  policy  BASH  has  initiated,  and  we  reject  appellants’ \nattempt to argue that there is. Appellants do not contend that \ntransgender Students A or B did anything remotely out of the \nordinary while using BASH’s facilities. Indeed, the appellants’ \nprivacy complaint is not with transgender students’ conduct, \nbut with their mere presence. We have already explained that \nthe presence of transgender students in these spaces does not \noffend the constitutional right of privacy any more than the \npresence of cisgender students in those spaces.  \n \nIn an argument that completely misses (or deliberately \nignores) the reason for the disputed policy or the circumstances \nit addresses, the appellants insist that it is improper to consider \na student’s transgender status when conducting this privacy \nanalysis and that we must only look at the student’s anatomy.92 \nWe disagree.

A  case \ninvolving transgender students using facilities aligned with \ntheir gender identities after seeking and receiving approval \nfrom trained school counselors and administrators implicates \ndifferent privacy concerns than, for example, a case involving \nan  adult  stranger  sneaking  into  a  locker  room  to  watch  a \nfourteen year-old girl shower. The latter scenario—taken from \na case the appellants rely upon95— is simply not analogous to \nthe circumstances here.     \n1.  The  District  Court \ncorrectly concluded that \nthe appellants’ Title IX \nclaim  was  unlikely  to \nsucceed on the merits.  \n \nThe  District  Court  rejected  the  appellants’  Title  IX \nclaim because the School District’s policy treated all students \nequally and therefore did not discriminate on the basis of sex, \nand because the appellants had failed to meet the elements of a \n“hostile environment harassment” claim. We again agree. We \nalso  agree  with  the  School  District’s  position  that  barring \ntransgender  students  from  restrooms  that  align  with  their \ngender identity would itself pose a potential Title IX violation.  \n \nTitle IX prohibits discrimination based on sex in all \neducational  programs  that  receive  funds  from  the  federal \ngovernment.96 However, discrimination with regard to privacy \nfacilities is exempt from that blanket prohibition. An institution \n“may  provide  separate  toilet,  locker  room,  and  shower \nfacilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities provided for \nstudents  of  one  sex  shall  be  comparable  to  such  facilities \nprovided for students of the other sex.”97 This exception is \n                                              \n93 Doe v.

Much of the confusion \nstems from the fact that the Supreme Court has used both the \nconjunctive and the disjunctive to describe the plaintiff’s \nburden. Compare Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v.

In \nCastleberry, we concluded that the “correct standard is severe \nor pervasive. Castleberry, 863 F.3d at 264.  Accordingly, we \nwill proceed using the disjunctive inquiry here. \n100 Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, \n81 (1998) (holding, in the Title VII context, that a plaintiff \n“must always prove that the conduct at issue . . . constituted \ndiscrimination because of . . . sex.” (internal quotations \nomitted)).  \n24 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112959135     Page: 25      Date Filed: 06/18/2018\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”).101 The Supreme \nCourt has “extended an analogous cause of action to students \nunder Title IX.”102 Title VII cases are therefore instructive.103  \n \nTitle VII prohibits employers from discriminating based \non sex.104 In Oncale, the Supreme Court considered whether \nTitle VII prohibited “discrimination because of sex” when the \nharasser and the harassed employee were the same sex.105 In \nconcluding that Title VII could support such a claim, the Court \nheld  that Title  VII  is  concerned  only  with  “discrimination \nbecause of sex.”106 It noted that the Court had never held that \n“workplace harassment, even harassment between men and \nwomen, is automatically discrimination because of sex merely \nbecause  the  words  used  have  sexual  content  or \nconnotations.”107 Rather, “the critical issue . . . is whether \nmembers of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or \nconditions of employment to which members of the other sex \nare not exposed.”108 The plaintiffs in a Title VII action must \ntherefore  always  “prove  that  the  conduct  at  issue  was  not \nmerely tinged with offensive sexual connotations, but actually \nconstituted  discrimination  because  of  sex.” 109  The  same \nrequirement holds true for Title IX claims. \n \nThe appellants have not provided any authority—either \nin the District Court or on appeal—to suggest that a sex-neutral \npolicy can give rise to a Title IX claim.

(quoting Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 25 \n(1993) (Ginsburg, J., concurring)).  \n109 Id. at 81 (internal alterations, emphasis, and quotation \nmarks omitted). \n25 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112959135     Page: 26      Date Filed: 06/18/2018\nhypothesize that “harassment” that targets both sexes equally \nwould  violate  Title  IX;  that  is  simply  not  the  law.110 The \ntouchstone of both Title VII and Title IX claims is disparate \ntreatment based on sex.111 The School District’s policy allows \nall students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that align with \ntheir gender identity. It does not discriminate based on sex, and \ntherefore does not offend Title IX.  \n \nThe  District  Court  also  correctly  found  that  the \nappellants had not met their burden of establishing that the \nmere presence of transgender students in bathrooms and locker \nrooms constitutes sexual harassment so severe, pervasive, or \nobjectively offensive and “that so undermines and detracts \nfrom the victims’ educational experience that [the plaintiff] is \neffectively denied equal access to an institution’s resources and \nopportunities.”112 That  is  particularly  true  given  the  many \nsafeguards  the  School  District  put  in  place  as  part  of  the \nchallenged policy. \n \nRather  than  relying  on  relevant  legal  authority  to \nestablish that the mere presence of a transgender student in a \nlocker room or bathroom rises to the level of harassment, the \nappellants again cite inapposite cases that involve egregious \nharassment. That is not surprising since we have found no \nauthority that supports the appellants’ claims. Two cases that \nthe  appellants  attempt  to  analogize  to  their  situation  are \nparticularly illustrative of the weakness of their position—\n                                              \n110 See Pasqual v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 101 F.3d 514, 517 (7th \nCir. 1996) (“Harassment that is inflicted without regard to \ngender, that is, where males and females in the same setting \ndo not receive disparate treatment, is not actionable because \nthe harassment is not based on sex.”); Henson v. City of \nDundee, 682 F.2d 897, 904 (11th Cir. 1982) (“[T]here may be \ncases in which a supervisor makes sexual overtures of both \nsexes or where the conduct complained of is equally offensive \nto male and female workers. In such cases, [the] harassment \nwould not be based on sex because men and women are \naccorded like treatment . . . and the plaintiff would have no \nremedy under Title VII.”). \n111 Oncale, 523 U.S. at 80. \n112 DeJohn, 537 F.3d at 316 n.14 (citations omitted). \n26 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112959135     Page: 27      Date Filed: 06/18/2018\nLewis  v.  Triborough  Bridge  and  Tunnel  Authority 113 and \nSchonauer  v.  DCR  Entertainment  Inc. 114  Lewis  involved \nharassment that is worlds apart from anything in the present \nrecord. There, cisgender men not only entered a locker room \nwhile  cisgender  female  employees  were  changing,  they \n“leer[ed]” at them, “crowd[ed] the entrance to the locker room, \nforcing [them] to ‘run the gauntlet[,]’ and brush[ed] up against \nthem.”115 When a supervisor was informed, he referred to the \nfemale employees as “cunts” and “the biggest bunch of fucking \ncrybabies.” 116  Any  comparison  to  the  circumstances  the \nappellants face here is patently frivolous. \n \nSchonauer is also distinguishable. There, the plaintiff \nwas employed as a beverage server at a topless nightclub and \nalleged that she had been harassed by a manager.117  In addition \nto  entering  the  women’s  changing  facility,  the  manager \nrepeatedly  encouraged  the  plaintiff  to  enter  nude  dance \ncontests,  asked  questions  about  her  sexual  fantasies,  and \nprobed her sexual history.118 When the plaintiff resisted these \nadvances, she was fired.119 The Washington Court of Appeals \nfound that this behavior could constitute harassment not simply \nbecause the manager entered the changing facility, but because \nhe  pressed  the  plaintiff  to  “provide  sexually  explicit \ninformation and to dance on stage in a sexually provocative \nway.”120  \n   \nThe District Court no doubt realized that the appellants’ \nattempt to seize upon Lewis and Schonauer demonstrated the \nweakness of their arguments.  Here, there are no allegations of \nharassment, let alone any that are even remotely as “severe, \npervasive, [or] objectively offensive.”121  Still, the appellants \n                                              \n113 77 F. Supp. 2d 376, 377–78 (S.D.N.Y. 1999). \n114 905 P.2d 392, 396–97, 400–01 (Wash. Ct. App. 1995). \n115 77 F.

Special \nSchool Dist., No. 1,122 a Title VII case from  the Court of \nAppeals for the Eighth Circuit. Cruzan held that a transgender \nindividual in a bathroom did not create a hostile environment \nbecause there was no evidence that the individual “engaged in \nany inappropriate conduct other than merely being present in \nthe  women’s  faculty  restroom.” 123 That  is,  a  transgender \nperson in a restroom did not create an environment that was \n“permeated  with  discriminatory  intimidation,  ridicule,  and \ninsult” as required to sustain a harassment claim under Title \nVII.124 We agree with the Eight Circuit’s conclusion. As we \nhave  emphasized,  the  appellants’  real  objection  is  to  the \npresence of transgender students, not to any “environment” \ntheir presence creates. Indeed, the allegations here include an \nassertion that a cisgender student was harassed merely by a \ntransgender student washing that student’s own hands in a \nbathroom or changing in a locker room. That is not the type of \nconduct that supports a Title IX hostile environment claim.125 \nThe District Court recognized this and correctly ruled that this \nclaim was unlikely to succeed. \n \nThe School District, on the other hand, contends that \nbarring transgender students from using privacy facilities that \nalign  with  their  gender  identity  would,  itself,  constitute \ndiscrimination under a sex-stereotyping theory in violation of \nTitle IX.126 We need not decide that very different issue here. \nWe note only that the School District’s argument finds support \nin the very persuasive opinion from the Seventh Circuit in \nWhitaker, and the analysis there supports the District Court’s \nconclusion that appellants were not likely to succeed on the \nmerits of their Title IX claim. \n                                              \n122 294 F.3d 981, 984 (8th Cir. 2002). \n123 Id.  \n124 Id. (citation omitted). \n125 This is not to say that the transgender students could not \nengage in conduct that would rise to the level of harassment. \nIt would be the same conduct required for cisgender students \nto harass someone. \n126 Br. for Appellees, 38–40.  \n28 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112959135     Page: 29      Date Filed: 06/18/2018\nIn  Whitaker,  a  transgender  boy  sued  the  Kenosha \nUnified School District for prohibiting him from using the \nboys’  bathrooms  and  locker  room. 127  He  alleged  that \nKenosha’s  policy  violated  Title  IX  and  denied  him  equal \nprotection.128 The District Court agreed and the school district \nappealed.129 The Court  of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit \naffirmed, finding that Kenosha’s policy constituted sex-based \ndiscrimination. \n \nSpecifically,  Whitaker  held  that  Kenosha’s  policy \nviolated Title IX because it discriminated against transgender \npeople based on their failure to conform to sex stereotypes.130 \n“By definition, a transgender individual does not conform to \nthe sex-based stereotypes of the sex that he or she was assigned \nat  birth.” 131  Accordingly,  Kenosha’s  policy  subjected \nWhitaker,  “as  a  transgender  student,  to  different  rules, \nsanctions,  and  treatment  than  non-transgender  students,  in \nviolation of Title IX.”132 The court also dismissed Kenosha’s \nargument  that  gender-neutral  bathroom  alternatives  were \nsufficient because such a policy would itself violate the Act.133 \n \nWhitaker explained that the Supreme Court has adopted \nan expansive view of “sex” under Title VII.134 Rather than \nlimit the definition of sex to one’s anatomy, a plurality of the \nSupreme  Court  held  in  Price  Waterhouse  that  Title  VII \n“intended to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment \nof men and women resulting from sex stereotypes.”135 The \nSupreme Court reiterated Title VII’s broad view of “sex” in \nOncale, wherein Justice Scalia wrote that “statutory provisions \noften  go  beyond  the  principal  evil  to  cover  reasonably \ncomparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws \nrather than the principal concern of our legislators by which we \n                                              \n127 Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1042. \n128 Id. \n129 Id. at 1042–43.  \n130 Id. at 1048–49.  \n131 Id. at 1048. \n132 Id. at 1049–50.  \n133 Id. at 1049–50 \n134 Id. at 1048. \n135 Id. at 1047–48 (quoting Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 \nU.S. 228, 251 (1989) (plurality)). \n29 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112959135     Page: 30      Date Filed: 06/18/2018\nare  governed.” 136  Whitaker  noted  that,  following  Price \nWaterhouse, many courts (including the Third Circuit) have \nrecognized a cause of action under Title VII when an employee \nfaces  discrimination  for  failing  to  conform  to  sex \nstereotypes.137 \n \nThe injunction that the appellants have requested here \nwould  essentially  have  replicated  the  Kenosha policy. The \nBoyertown Area School District can hardly be faulted for being \nproactive in adopting a policy that avoids the issues that would \nhave  otherwise  arisen  under  Title  IX.  Contrary  to  the \nappellants’ assertions, “sex” has not been narrowly limited to \na person’s anatomy under Title VII—nor by analogy is it so \nlimited under Title IX.   \n \nThis conclusion is a natural extension of our decision in \nProwel v. Wise Business Forms, Inc, where we recognized that \na  plaintiff  can  state  a  claim  under  Title  VII  for  sexual \ndiscrimination based on gender stereotyping.138 While Prowel \ndid not involve a transgender person, we did consider whether \na man who did not adhere to male gender stereotypes could \nstate a claim for sex discrimination under Title VII.139 Relying \non Price Waterhouse, we held that Title VII’s prohibition on \ndiscrimination “because of sex” also prohibited discriminating \nagainst someone who did not conform to gender stereotypes.140  \n \nTitle  IX  prohibits  discrimination  against  transgender \nstudents  in  school  facilities  just  as  Title  VII  prohibited \ndiscrimination against Prowel in the workplace. Therefore a \ncourt  may  not  issue  an  injunction  that  would  subject  the \n                                              \n136 Id. at 1048 (quoting Oncale, 523 U.S. at 79). \n137 Id.

In addition \nto the Seventh Circuit’s decision in Whitaker, the Courts of \nAppeals for the Eleventh and Sixth Circuits have concluded \nthat discriminating against transgender individuals constitutes \nsex discrimination.141 Similarly, the First Circuit has relied on \nTitle VII in holding that a person may state a claim under the \nEqual Credit Opportunity Act, which prohibits discrimination \n“with respect to  . . . sex[,]” if that person does not conform to \nsex stereotypes.142 The Ninth Circuit has also looked to Title \nVII and held that a transgender female inmate who did not \nconform  to  sex  stereotypes  could  state  a  claim  under  the \nGender Motivated Violence Act.143  \n \nWe  therefore  hold  that  the  District  Court  correctly \ndeclined to issue an injunction based on the appellants’ Title \nIX claim.  \n                                              \n141 Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1316–17 (11th Cir. \n2011) (holding that a “person is defined as transgender \nprecisely because of the perception that his or her behavior \ntransgresses gender stereotypes . . . . Accordingly, \ndiscrimination against a transgender individual because of her \ngender-nonconformity is sex discrimination”); Smith v. City \nof Salem, 378 F.3d 566, 573 (6th Cir. 2004) (holding that sex \ndiscrimination under Title VII “encompasses both the \nbiological differences between men and women, and gender \ndiscrimination, that is, discrimination based on a failure to \nconform to stereotypical gender norms”). \n142 Rosa v. Park West Bank & Tr. Co., 214 F.3d 213, 215–16 \n(1st Cir. 2000) (holding that the plaintiff, a birth-assigned \nmale whose “attire did not accord with his male gender,” \ncould state a claim if a banker did not give him a loan). \n143 Schwenk v. Hartford, 204 F.3d 1187, 1200, 1202 (9th Cir. \n2000) (“Congress intended proof of gender motivation under \nthe GMVA to proceed in the same way that proof of \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex or race is shown under Title \nVII . . . . ‘[S]ex’ under Title VII encompasses both sex—that \nis, the biological difference between men and women—and \ngender.”). \n31 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112959135     Page: 32      Date Filed: 06/18/2018\n2.  The  District  Court \ncorrectly concluded that \nthe appellants’ state law \ntort claim was unlikely \nto succeed on the merits.  \n \n  Finally, the appellants contend that the District Court \nerred in denying the injunction as to their Pennsylvania-law \ntort  claim  for  intrusion  upon  seclusion.  Pennsylvania  has \nadopted  the  Second  Restatement  of  Torts’  definition  of \nintrusion upon seclusion: \n \nOne  who  intentionally  intrudes, \nphysically or otherwise, upon the \nsolitude or seclusion of another or \nhis private affairs or concerns, is \nsubject to the other for invasion of \nhis privacy, if the intrusion would \nbe highly offensive to a reasonable \nperson.144 \n  \nIn denying this claim, the District Court concluded that the \nmere presence of a transgender individual in a bathroom or \nlocker room is not the type of conduct that would be highly \noffensive to a reasonable person. As we have noted, students \nin a locker room expect to see other students in varying stages \nof undress, and they expect that other students will see them in \nvarying stages of undress. We will affirm the District Court’s \nrejection of the appellants’ tort claim.  \n \nB.  Irreparable Harm \n \nIn addition to finding that the appellants were unlikely \nto succeed on the merits of their claims, the District Court \ndenied injunctive relief because they had not demonstrated that \nthe failure to issue an injunction would result in irreparable \nharm. The District Court found that: \n \n                                              \n144 Tagouma v. Investigative Consultant Servs, Inc., 4 A.3d \n170, 174 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2010) (quoting Restatement (Second) \nof Torts § 652B (1965)). \n32 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112959135     Page: 33      Date Filed: 06/18/2018\nOn a practical level . . . the privacy \nprotections  that  are  in  place  at \nBASH,  which  include  the \nbathroom stalls and shower stalls \nin the locker rooms, the bathroom \nstalls in the multi-user bathrooms, \nthe  availability  of  a  number  of \nsingle-user  bathrooms  (a  few  of \nwhich will have lockers for storing \nitems), the [ability] of students to \nstore personal items in their locker \nor leave those items with the gym \nteacher, and the availability of the \nteam  rooms  in  the  locker  rooms \n(which would not involve students \npassing through the common area \nof the locker room), and the overall \nwillingness  of  the  [appellees]  to \nwork with the students and their \nfamilies to assure that the students \nare  comfortable  at  BASH, \nmitigates  against  a  finding  of \nirreparable harm. . . . The privacy \nprotections available to students in \n2017-18 are more than suitable to \naddress  any  privacy  concerns \nrelating  to  the  presence  of \ntransgender students in the locker \nrooms and bathrooms at BASH.145  \n \n  We  agree  that  the  appellants  did  not  demonstrate \nirreparable harm would result from denying an injunction. The \nSchool District has provided adequate privacy facilities for the \nappellants to use during this litigation. Even if the appellants \ncould otherwise succeed on one or more of their claims (and, \nas explained above,  we do not suggest that they can), the \nsingle-user facilities ensure that no appellant faces irreparable \nharm in the meantime.  \n                                              \n145 Doe v.

CONCLUSION \n \nThe Boyertown Area School District has adopted a very \nthoughtful and carefully tailored policy in an attempt to address \nsome very real issues while faithfully discharging its obligation \nto  maintain  a  safe  and  respectful  environment  in  which \neveryone can both learn and thrive.   \n \nThe  District  Court  correctly  concluded  that  the \nappellants’ attempt to enjoin that policy based on an alleged \nviolation of their privacy rights and their rights under Title IX \nand Pennsylvania tort law is not likely to succeed on the merits. \nThe District Court was also correct in deciding that denying the \ninjunction would not irreparably harm the appellants. For the \nreasons set forth above and in the well-reasoned District Court \nopinion,  we  will  affirm  the  District  Court’s  denial  of  the \nrequested preliminary injunction.  \n34 \n ",

The judges who issued the Court’s decision have voted to grant panel rehearing.  \nAccordingly, the opinion entered June 18, 2018 is hereby VACATED and a revised \nopinion will be entered.

Those same facts also can support the legal conclusion \nthat the policy Boyertown eventually decided upon is sufficient \nto  withstand  the  Appellants’  request  for  a  preliminary \ninjunction.  Thus, my purpose in writing now is not to take \nissue with the panel’s ultimate denial of injunctive relief.  It is \nrather to note my disagreement with the panel’s suggestion that \nit would have been a violation of federal law for the school \ndistrict to adopt a policy requiring transgender students to \neither use a single-user bathroom or facilities corresponding to \ntheir biological sex.1  Accordingly, I dissent from the Court’s \ndenial of the Appellants’ petition for rehearing en banc. \n \n  The revised panel opinion rightly acknowledges that a \nschool  policy  addressing  transgender  students’  use  of \nbathrooms and locker rooms is a matter of high importance to \nBoyertown and its students.  Given that public importance and \nthe obvious sensitivity of the issues involved, one would have \nthought that the opinion would address only the facts at issue \nand then only to the extent necessary.  But the panel went \nbeyond  what  was  necessary  when  it  chose  to  address \nBoyertown’s tangential argument that the school district would \nhave run afoul of Title IX had it implemented a policy that \nconfined transgender students to use of bathrooms and locker \nrooms designated for their biological sex.  The revised panel \nopinion  claims  that  “requiring  transgender  students  to  use \nsingle user or birth-sex-aligned facilities is its own form of \ndiscrimination.”  Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., No. 17-\n3113, slip op. at 19 (3d Cir. July 26, 2018).  In approving \n                                                            \n1 As an aside, I also note my discomfort with the tone \nof the opinion at certain points, which, despite the panel \nmembers’ assurance that they do not intend to minimize the \nconcerns of the Appellants regarding privacy in dealing with \nhygiene and bodily functions, seems very much to minimize \nthose concerns and treat them as a thin cover for bigotry. \n1 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112991928     Page: 4      Date Filed: 07/26/2018\nBoyertown’s decision to permit transgender students to use the \nbathrooms  and  locker  rooms  of  their  choice,  the  revised \nopinion implies that the school district would have been legally \nmistaken to do otherwise, saying Boyertown “can hardly be \nfaulted for … adopting a policy that avoids the issues that may \notherwise have occurred under Title IX.”  Id. at 29. \n \n  That suggestion is unnecessary and is certainly open to \ndebate.2  True, the revised opinion is not as far out on a limb as \nthe originally published opinion was.   The idea that Boyertown \ncould not have designed a constitutionally acceptable policy \nthat required transgender students to use single-user bathrooms \nand  locker  room  facilities  or  ones  corresponding  to  their \nbiological sex was more explicit in that earlier opinion.  See \nDoe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 893 F.3d 179, 199 (3d Cir. \n2018) (“Title IX prohibits discrimination against transgender \nstudents in school facilities ….  Therefore a court may not issue \nan injunction that would subject the transgender students to \ndifferent conditions than their cisgender peers are subjected \n                                                            \n2  Underlying that debate is the substantial controversy \nover how to interpret the meaning of the word “sex” in Title \nIX, namely, whether Title IX’s use of the term denotes only \nbiological sex or if it also encompasses concepts of gender \nidentity.  In assuming the latter, the revised opinion ignores \nthe clear-statement rule, which limits liability for legislation \nenacted pursuant to the Spending Clause such as Title IX.  \nSee Davis v. Monroe Cty. Bd. of Ed., 526 U.S. 629, 640 \n(1999) (treating Title IX as Spending Clause legislation); \nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 \n(1981) (adopting clear-statement rule for Spending Clause \nlegislation).  That rule requires “Congress [to] speak with a \nclear voice” and “unambiguously” put state funding recipients \non notice of the conditions of federal funds.  Pennhurst, 451 \nU.S. at 17.  Nowhere does Title IX unambiguously specify \nliability for failure to open locker rooms and bathrooms to \ntransgender students of the opposite sex.  I am not \nencouraging the panel to go deeper into dicta by addressing \nthe clear-statement rule.  I am simply pointing out that one of \nthe problems with sweeping statements of the sort that still \ncharacterize the revised opinion is that they sidestep nuanced \nanalysis that would necessarily be undertaken if a properly \npresented issue were under consideration. \n2 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112991928     Page: 5      Date Filed: 07/26/2018\nto.”), vacated by order of July 26, 2018.  Nevertheless, even \nthe  revised  opinion  appears  to  communicate  the  same \nunwarranted  and  unsupported  implication.    Although  I \nappreciate the panel’s thoughtful effort to cure the overreach \nin its now-vacated opinion, it still wrongly suggests that our \nCourt has reached decisions that it has not. \n \n  There  is  a  good  reason  why  we  avoid  wading  into \nfraught waters without needing to and without careful legal \nanalysis supporting the conclusions we reach.  Dicta are often \ndangerous.  Because they are unmoored from any concrete set \nof facts and are frequently the product of judicial musing rather \nthan  adversarial  presentations  from  parties  with  a  vested \ninterest in exploring issues in detail, dicta can be ill-informed.  \nAll too often, they can short-circuit the legal process and end \nup substituting mere assertion for reason.  As has been wisely \nobserved,  “[t]he  problem  is  that  dicta  no  longer  have  the \ninsignificance  they  deserve.    They  are  no  longer  ignored.  \nJudges do more than put faith in them; they are often treated as \nbinding law. The distinction between dictum and holding is \nmore  and  more  frequently  disregarded.”    Pierre  N.  Leval, \nJudging Under the Constitution: Dicta about Dicta, 81 N.Y.U. \nL. Rev. 1249, 1250 (2006). \n \nReasonable people can and will disagree about the most \nappropriate  way  to  address  transgender  students’  desire  to \nselect which bathroom or locker room facilities to use.  It is a \nproblem without a perfect solution, and we have not even \nbegun to analyze those competing interests except for in this \none  specific  fact  circumstance  presented  for  preliminary \ninjunctive relief.  Despite that, the panel’s dicta in the revised \nopinion  continue  to  imply  otherwise,  and  so  are  likely  to \nhandicap  efforts  by  local  school  districts  throughout  this \nCircuit to thoughtfully address how to best handle the issue in \ntheir own communities.  The law does not mandate only one \noutcome, as the panel opinion suggests.3   \n                                                            \n3  The revised panel opinion still relies on the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit’s recent \nopinion in Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified School District No. 1 \nBoard of Education, 858 F.3d 1034 (7th Cir. 2017).  The \ncourt in Whitaker affirmed a lower court’s order granting the \nplaintiff, a biological girl, an injunction permitting use of the \n3 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112991928     Page: 6      Date Filed: 07/26/2018\n \nIt is the province of elected officials, including those on \nlocal school boards, to weigh competing interests and debate \nthe wisdom of policy choices.  It is our role to assess whether \na specific policy choice, as understood in a specific factual \ncontext, violates the Constitution or other federal law.  That is \nas far as we should go. \n   \nIn short, because “both the adversary system and the \npremise that courts have less authority to prescribe general-\n                                                            \nboys’ bathrooms at school.  Id. at 1039.  Employing a sex-\nstereotyping theory of discrimination, the court reasoned that \nthe student had demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of \nsuccess on a Title IX claim that the school district had \ndiscriminated on the basis of sex by prohibiting use of the \nboys’ bathrooms.  Id.  The sex-stereotyping theory, also \nknown as gender-stereotyping, derives from Price \nWaterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989).  We have \naccepted that theory and permit plaintiffs to sue for sex \ndiscrimination on the basis of “noncompliance with gender \nstereotypes.”  Prowel v. Wise Business Forms, Inc., 579 F.3d \n285, 290 (3d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted).  According to \nWhitaker, “[a] policy that requires an individual to use a \nbathroom that does not conform with his or her gender \nidentity punishes that individual for his or her gender non-\nconformance[.]”  858 F.3d at 1049.  Whitaker is alone among \nthe courts of appeals, however, in concluding that a policy \nrequiring employees or students to utilize bathroom facilities \ncorresponding to their biological sex is tantamount to sex-\nstereotyping discrimination.  Indeed, the issue has been \nviewed very differently by the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Tenth Circuit.  That court has stated in a Title VII case \nthat “prohibition on sex discrimination, however, does not \nextend so far” as to require a government entity to permit a \ntranssexual person to use the bathroom designated for use by \npersons of the opposite biological sex.  Etsitty v. Utah Transit \nAuth., 502 F.3d 1215, 1224 (10th Cir. 2007).  And Title IX’s \nimplementing regulations expressly permit schools to \n“separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the \nbasis of sex.”  34 C.F.R. § 106.33.  To say or imply that there \nis only one legally defensible policy decision that a school \ndistrict can reach is not only unsupported; it is unsupportable. \n4 \n \n\nCase: 17-3113     Document: 003112991928     Page: 7      Date Filed: 07/26/2018\npurpose  rules  than  do  legislatures  are  so  firmly  rooted  in \nAmerican legal practice as to rank as axiomatic[,]” Michael C. \nDorf, Dicta and Article III, 142 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1997, 2003 \n(1994)  (footnote  omitted),  it  is  equally  axiomatic  that  we \nshould  confine  ourselves  to  resolving  the  specific  matters \nbefore us, not some bigger issue we might like to address.  I \ntherefore vote for rehearing en banc to vacate the panel opinion \nand give our full Court the opportunity to consider the case and \narticulate an appropriately limited rationale for our result. \n5 \n ",
