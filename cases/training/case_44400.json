    "summary": "<p>This case involves an imprisoned person's duty to exhaust grievance processes under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA). A six-month pregnant incarcerated woman was assaulted by a prison deputy, causing a miscarriage and other severe abdominal complications. Afterwards, she sought to hold the assaulter accountable and filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 4, 2020, the plaintiff filed a complaint with private counsel in the Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiff brought this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 under the Fourteenth Amendment for excessive force in violation of the due process and equal protection clause, the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable seizures, and the excessive force and deliberate indifference in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The plaintiff also sought a claim of gross negligence. The defendants were Wayne County and a sergeant at the Wayne County Jail. The case was assigned to District Judge Arthur J. Tarnow.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on September 30, 2020 for failure to comply with PLRA. They argued that the plaintiff did not properly exhaust her administrative remedies with the Wayne County Jail pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act before filing the lawsuit. Wayne County Jail requires an inmate to file a written grievance on unsatisfactory conduct within ten days of the incident, but the defendants argued the plaintiff never filed a written grievance.</p>\r\n<p>On March 28, 2022, the court granted the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss, agreeing with the defendants that the plaintiff did not exhaust her administrative remedies. While the plaintiff had argued she could not comply with the grievance process because of her mental health issues, the court found there was no mental capacity exception to PLRA in this case.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration on April 25, 2022, but this was denied on May 5, 2022. The case was also reassigned to District Judge Victoria A. Roberts because of the death of Judge Tarnow.</p>\r\n<p>On May 31, 2022, the plaintiff appealed the dismissal to the 6th Circuit (Case No. 22-1485). The appeal was led by the Roderick &amp; Solange MacArthur Justice Center. On July 18, 2022, the Circuit court reversed the judgement of the district court and remanded for further proceedings after finding that the district court erred in granting the motion to dismiss on failure-to-exhaust grounds. The court further explained this was because the defendants failed to establish the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the Jail&rsquo;s staff stopped the plaintiff&rsquo;s attempts to exhaust her administrative remedies.</p>\r\n<p>On September 5, 2023, the defendants filed another motion to dismiss and a motion for an evidentiary hearing. In the motion, the defendants argued that the alleged violations of the Eighth Amendment could not apply to a pretrial detainee. Additionally, defendants argued that because Wayne County cannot be held liable for the actions of its employees under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, the Fourteenth Amendment claim should fial. The defendants also argued that governmental immunity barred any Michigan state law claims asserted against Wayne County. Finally, they argued that the plaintiffs described intentional, not negligent, conduct by the sergeant making the gross negligence claim invalid.</p>\r\n<p>The request for an evidentiary hearing was denied on July 13, 2024, because the court found that the defendants failed to refute the evidence regarding the plaintiff&rsquo;s mental incapacity to comply with the available administrative remedies.</p>\r\n<p>On July 23, 2024, the district court granted the defendants&rsquo; motion for partial dismissal of the plaintiff&rsquo;s complaint and instructed the plaintiff to file a motion for leave to amend her complaint. The court found the plaintiff&rsquo;s claims under the Eighth Amendment failed as a matter of law, her state law gross negligence claim failed against Wayne County because it was protected by governmental immunity, and the factual allegations in the complaint supported a state-law intentional tort claim against the defendant rather than the gross negligence claim. The defendants filed a motion for reconsideration, but this was denied by the court on February 24, 2025. The court found the plaintiff&rsquo;s impaired cognitive function due to mental illness rendered her incapable of understanding and complying with the prison&rsquo;s exhaustion requirements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In light of the partial dismissal, the plaintiff requested leave to amend her complaint on August 5, 2024, which was granted on February 24, 2025.</p>\r\n<p>As of February 2025, this case is ongoing.</p>",

[Plaintiff] alleges \nthat when she asked Watt this question, Watt grabbed her right hand, bent it back, \nand dragged her back to her cell by her finders and hair, and kicked her in the \nstomach.โ Coopwood v. Wayne County, No. 20-12092, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n57026, *2 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 28, 2022) (unpublished). Defendants dispute that this \nalleged incident ever occurred or that she ever reported this incident either verbally \nor in writing to any Wayne County Jail staff.  โOn September 17, 2018, the Wayne \nCounty Circuit Court found [Plaintiff] guilty of second-degree murder.  [Plaintiff] is \ncurrently serving an 18-year sentence at the Womenโs Huron Valley Correctional \nFacility.โ  Id.  \nPlaintiff asserts five legal claims against Defendants: (1) Counts I and II \n(Fourteenth Amendment under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983; (2) Counts III and IV (Eighth \nAmendment under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983); and Count V (State Law Gross Negligence).  \nAs explained more fully below, Counts III and IV fail to state a claim against the \nWayne County Defendants because the Eighth Amendment does not apply to the \nPage 7 of 16 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-LVP-DRG   ECF No. 36, PageID.428   Filed 09/05/23   Page 8 of 16\nfacts of this case, Counts I and II fail to state a municipal liability claim under 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1983 against Wayne County because Plaintiff fails to allege any plausible \n, and Count V fails to state a claim against the Wayne county Defendants.  \nARGUMENT \n \nA.  Counts III and IV: Because Counts III and IV are Premised on Violations \nof the Eighth Amendment, They Fail as a Matter of Law Against Wayne \nCounty and Deputy Watts Because She Was a Pretrial Detainee During \nAugust 2017.  \n \n  Because Plaintiff was a pretrial detainee in the Wayne County Jail at all times \nrelevant to the claims in the Complaint, the Eighth Amendment claims in Counts II \nand III fail as a matter of law.  During August 2017, Plaintiff was being held in the \nWayne County Jail pending a criminal trial that ultimately occurred during August \nand September of 2018.  See People v. Coopwood, No. 346241, 2019 Mich. App. \nLEXIS  8274  (Mich.  Ct.  App.  Dec.  26,  2019)  (unpublished);  (ECF  No.  20-2, \nJudgment of Sentence). The Sixth Circuit has held that the Fourteenth Amendment \napplies  to  excessive  force  claims  asserted by  pretrial detainees  and the  Eighth \nAmendment applies to convicted prisoners serving sentences.  See Mercer v. Athens \nCounty, No. 22-3904, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 16453, *10 (6th Cir. June 29, 2023) \n(unpublished) (summarizing the legal distinctions between Fourteenth and Eighth \nAmendment claims asserted under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983).   \nPage 8 of 16 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-LVP-DRG   ECF No. 36, PageID.429   Filed 09/05/23   Page 9 of 16\n  Because the Eighth Amendment does not apply to Plaintiff and because she \nhas already plead Fourteenth Amendment claims in Counts I and II, Counts III and \nIV fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted against Defendants.    \nB.  Counts I and II: The Complaint Fails to State Any Plausible Municipal \nLiability Claim Against Wayne County Under Any Theory Recognized \nBy the Sixth Circuit.  \n \nTo  the  extent  that  Plaintiff  alleges  a  Fourteenth  Amendment  municipal \nliability claim against Wayne County, the Complaint fails to present any plausible \nallegations to establish the factual basis for such a claim under any of the four \ntheories of liability recognized by the Sixth Circuit.  \nIt is well-established that a municipality may not be held vicariously liable for \nthe actions of its employees under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  See Connick v. Thompson, 563 \nU.S. 51, 60, 131 (2011).  Instead, a municipality may only be liable under ยง 1983 \nwhen its policy or custom causes the injury, regardless of the form of relief sought \nby the plaintiff.  See Los Angeles County v. Humphries, 562 U.S. 29, 39 (2010) \n(citation omitted).  The policy or custom must be the โmoving forceโ behind the \nconstitutional injury, and a plaintiff must identify the policy, connect the policy to \nthe governmental entity, and show that the particular injury was incurred because of \nthe execution of that policy.  See Turner v. City of Taylor, 412 F.3d 629, 639 (6th \nCir. 2005).  Municipal liability claims require an underlying constitutional violation \nby an employee or agent.  See Wilson v. Morgan, 477 F.3d 326, 340 (6th Cir. 2007).  \nPage 9 of 16 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-LVP-DRG   ECF No. 36, PageID.430   Filed 09/05/23   Page 10 of 16\nThe Sixth Circuit recognizes four general theories of municipal liability: โ(1) the \nexistence of an illegal official policy or legislative enactment; (2) that an official \nwith final decision-making authority ratified illegal actions; (3) the existence of a \npolicy of inadequate training or supervision; or (4) the existence of a custom of \ntolerance or acquiescence of federal rights violations.โ  Burgess v. Fischer, 735 F.3d \n462, 478 (6th Cir. 2013) (citation omitted).  For theories (3) and (4), a plaintiff must \nprovide plausible allegations supporting, and ultimately establish: โ(1) the existence \nof a clear and persistent pattern of violating federal rights . . . ; (2) notice or \nconstructive notice on the part of defendants; (3) the defendantsโ tacit approval of \nthe unconstitutional conduct, such that their deliberate indifference in failing to act \ncan be said to amount to an official policy of inaction; and (4) that the defendantsโ \ncustom  was  the  โmoving  force,โ  or  direct  causal  link  for  the  constitutional \ndeprivation.โ  See Powers v. Hamilton County Public Defenders Commโn, 501 F.3d \n592, 607 (6th Cir. 2007) (citation omitted); see Bickerstaff v. Lucarelli, 830 F.3d \n388, 402 (6th Cir. 2016) (requiring that a plaintiff plead the existence of prior \nincidents if pursuing an โinactionโ theory of liability). \nHere,  the  Complaint  is  devoid  of  any  plausible  allegations  to  support  a \nmunicipal liability claim under any of the four recognized theories of municipal \nliability.  She does allege that Wayne county had facially-unconstitutional policies, \nthat  a  โfinal  decisionmakerโ  at  the  Wayne  County  Sheriffโs  Office  had  actual \nPage 10 of 16 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-LVP-DRG   ECF No. 36, PageID.431   Filed 09/05/23   Page 11 of 16\nknowledge of unconstitutional conduct by Deputy Watts and then โratifiedโ it; that \na well-known lack of training or supervision was the actual cause of the violation; \nor that the Jail had a โcustom of toleranceโ of unnecessary and gratuitous physical \nviolence against female inmates.  The Sixth Circuit has recognized that a Complaint \nmust contain sufficient and plausible factual allegations for a municipal liability \nclaim to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  See, e.g., Annette v. Bradley, \nNo.  20-5657,  2020  U.S.  App.  LEXIS  39906,  *2-3  (6th  Cir.  Dec.  18,  2020) \n(unpublished) (affirming the dismissal of municipal liability claims for failure to \nprovide plausible allegations); Mays v. Daviess County, No. 21-5860, 2022 U.S. \nApp. LEXIS 6570, *4 (6th Cir. Mar. 14, 2022) (unpublished) (โMaysโs complaint \nalleged nothing suggesting that such a policy or custom caused Wyatt to injure him, \nso the district court properly dismissed the claims against the countyโ); Brown v. \nCuyahoga County, 517 F. Appโx 431, 436 (6th Cir. 2013) (unpublished) (affirming \nthe dismissal of a municipal liability claim because of a lack of sufficient and \nplausible allegations).  \nBecause the Complaint fails to provide any plausible allegations establishing \nthe existence of a municipal liability claim, Counts I and II fail as a matter of law \nagainst Wayne County.  \n \n \nPage 11 of 16 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-LVP-DRG   ECF No. 36, PageID.432   Filed 09/05/23   Page 12 of 16\nC.  Governmental Immunity Bars Any Michigan State Law Claim Asserted \nDirectly Against Wayne County.  \n \nCount V fails to state a claim against Wayne County because Michiganโs \ndoctrine  of  government  immunity  generally  bars  all  tort  claims  against  local \ngovernments as long as the incident occurred within the exercise or discharge of a \ngovernmental function.  See Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 691.1407(1) (โ[A] governmental \nagency is immune from tort liability if the governmental agency is engaged in the \nexercise or discharge of a governmental functionโ).  โTo overcome governmental \nimmunity for tort liability, then, plaintiffs . . . must either (1) plead a tort that falls \nwithin one of the GTLAโs stated exceptions, or (2) demonstrate that the alleged tort \noccurred outside the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.โ  Genesee \nCounty Drain Commโr v. Genesee County, 869 N.W.2d 635, 642 (Mich. Ct. App. \n2015)  (citation  omitted).    None  of  the  statutory  exceptions  to  governmental \nimmunity โ the highway exception, the motor vehicle exception, the public building \nexception the governmental hospital exception, the proprietary function exception, \nor the sewage system event exceptionโ applies in this case.  In re Bradley, 835 \nN.W.2d 545, 551 n. 21 (Mich. 2013) (listing the exceptions).   \nโIn  determining  whether  a  particular  activity  constitutes  a  governmental \nfunction, the focus is on the precise activity giving rise to plaintiff's claim rather than \non the entity's overall or principal operation. Nonetheless, to use anything other than \nthe general  activity standard  would  all  but  subvert  the  broad governmental \nPage 12 of 16 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-LVP-DRG   ECF No. 36, PageID.433   Filed 09/05/23   Page 13 of 16\nimmunity intended by the Legislature because it would be difficult to characterize \nany tortious act that is a governmental function.โ Margaris v. Genesee County, 919 \nN.W.2d 659, 668 (Mich. Ct. App. 2018) (citations and quotation marks omitted). \nโGovernmental immunity is differentiated from the immunity given to individuals \nin that the immunity granted by the GTLA to a governmental entity is based upon \nthe general nature of the activity of its employees, rather than the specific conduct \nof its employees.โ  Id. (citations omitted).  Michigan courts have long recognized \nthat โthe operation and maintenance of a jail is a governmental functionโ for the \npurposes of governmental immunity.  See, e.g., Wojtasinski v. Saginaw, 254 N.W.2d \n71, 72 (Mich. Ct. App. 1977) (citation omitted); Roberts v. City of Troy, 429 N.W.2d \n206, 210 (Mich. Ct. App. 1988) (โThe operation of a jail or detention facility is a \ngovernmental function, for which a [county] is generally immuneโ).   \nHere, because Count V alleges a tort claim but does not allege or provide any \nplausible  allegations  that  Wayne  County  was  not  engaged  in  the  exercise  or \ndischarge of a governmental function when this tort occurred.   Courts have held that \ngovernmental immunity bars tort claims involving allegations of assault and battery \nagainst the municipality.   See, e.g., Leftwich v. Driscoll, No. 20-10881, 2022 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 99945, *16 (E.D. Mich. June 3, 2022) (unpublished) (holding that \ngovernmental immunity barred tort claims against a municipality where the claims \nwere premised on excessive forced used by police officers);  Burnett v. City of \nPage 13 of 16 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-LVP-DRG   ECF No. 36, PageID.434   Filed 09/05/23   Page 14 of 16\nHighland Park, No. 09-14238, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124795, *22 (E.D. Mich. Oct. \n28, 2011) (unpublished) (โStevenson was employed at the police station and her \nduties  on  the  day  of  the  incident  included  monitoring  and  supervising  pretrial \ndetainees.  This  function  is  clearly  a  governmental  activity,  and  the  City  has \nimmunity for Burnett's state law claim of assault and batteryโ).  \n  Because governmental immunity bars the Michigan state law claims of gross \nnegligence, Count V fails to state a claim against Wayne County.  \nD.  Count V Fails to State of a Claim of โGross Negligenceโ Against Deputy \nWatts.    \n \n  Count V as lodged against Deputy Watts claim that she took the intentional \nactions of dragging Plaintiff by the hair and kicking her in the stomach.  (Compl. ยถยถ \n63-64).  As recognized by the Court based on binding Sixth Circuit precedent, \nโMichigan courts prohibit plaintiffs from transforming claims involving elements of \nintentional torts into claims of gross negligence.  In Wells, the Sixth Circuit held that \na plaintiffโs gross negligence claim against a police officer is barred because it arose \nfrom the same intentional acts as the plaintiffโs assault and battery claim.โ  Leftwich, \n2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99945, at *14-15 (citing Wells v. City of Dearborn Heights, \n538 F. Appโx 631, 641-42 (6th Cir. 2013) (unpublished)). โMichigan courts have \nrepeatedly rejected attempts to transform claims involving elements of intentional \ntorts into claims of gross negligence.โ Wells, 538 F. Appโx at 642 (6th Cir. 2013) \n(quoting VanVorous v. Burmeister, 687 N.W.2d 132, 143 (Mich. Ct.

Addis, No. 21-1454, 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS \n9901, *16 (6th Cir. Apr. 11, 2022) (unpublished) (โReynolds also asserts a claim of \ngross negligence against Addis. But under Michigan law, gross negligence is not an \nindependent cause of action when the underlying claim is an intentional shooting of \na suspect by an officerโ) (citations and quotation marks omitted).  \n  Because Count V is premised upon alleged intentional conduct of assaulting \nand dragging Plaintiff, and not grossly negligent conduct, Michigan law requires the \ndismissal of the gross negligence claims against Deputy Watts.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPage 15 of 16 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-LVP-DRG   ECF No. 36, PageID.436   Filed 09/05/23   Page 16 of 16\nCONCLUSION \n \n  For the foregoing reasons, Defendants Wayne County and Deputy Watts \nrespectfully requests that the Court grant its Motion to Dismiss as to: \n(1)  Counts III and IV against both Defendants \n(2)  Counts I and II against Defendant Wayne County; and  \n(3)  Count V against both Defendants.   \n \n              Respectfully submitted, \n \nBy: Anthony Monticciolo (76013) \nAssistant Corporation Counsel \nJames W.

WATT (โWattโ) \n(collectively โDefendantsโ), states as follows: \nPARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n1.  Plaintiff asserts that the statutory or other basis for the exercise of jurisdiction in this \nUnited States Federal District Court is based upon a federal question asserted under 42 U.S.C. \n1983 as to violations of Plaintiff rights under the U. S. Constitution and laws, including those \nunder the Eighth Amendment, as well as supplemental jurisdiction for Plaintiffโs State claims \nasserted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1367(a); all of which Plaintiff requests to be tried and heard \nbefore a jury. \n  1 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-AJT-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 08/04/20    PageID.2    Page 2 of 10\n2.  At all relevant times mentioned in this Complaint, Plaintiff was a resident of Wayne \nCounty, Michigan, at the Wayne County Jail awaiting proceedings for a criminal charge. \n3.  At all times mentioned herein, the County of Wayne was and is a public entity and/or \nmunicipality (hereinafter โCountyโ). \n4.  At all times mentioned herein, Defendant Sgt. Watt was an officer, agent, and employee \nof Wayne County, and was a sergeant or deputy at the Wayne County Jail, operating in her \nindividual and official capacity. Plaintiff is unaware of Defendant Wattโs first name but will \namend the complaint once this is discovered.  \n5.  Plaintiff recalls Watt being a tall, African American woman around the age of 50, with \nshort hair, and a slender build.   \n6.  Watt was wearing heavy black boots, presumptively issued or accepted by her employer, \nat all relevant times herein. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n \n7.  On or about August 13, 2017, Ms. Coopwood was remanded to Wayne County Jail, she \nwas six (6) months pregnant, suffered from a history of serious mental health impairment, her \nconditions of which were known by the Defendants.   \n8.  During the incidents described herein, Plaintiffโs status was nothing more than a pre-trial \ndetainee. \n9.  Ms. Coopwood was housed in a smaller unit at the jail for reasons relative to her mental \nhealth and pregnancy statuses. \n10. On August 17, 2017, at roughly 1:30 pm, Defendant Watt made her rounds and had no \nsubstantial contact with Ms. Coopwood; all inmates of the jail were on lockdown in their cells.   \n  2 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-AJT-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 08/04/20    PageID.3    Page 3 of 10\n11. At or around 2:30 pm, Ms. Coopwood, walked to the desk where Sgt. Watt was located, \nand requested to make a phone call to her sister to let her know that she was doing โokayโ. \n12. Ms. Coopwood tapped on the guards window with the knuckle on her index finger, Watt \nreplied; โBitch, if I want to help youโฆI would be in the middleโฆIโm doing something. Go \nlockdown.โ \n13. Ms. Coopwood replied, โare you going to help me?โ  \n14. Defendant Watt hung up her phone, walked around the guard station to where Plaintiff \nwas located, grabbed her right hand, bent it back, and dragged her back to her cell by both the \nfingers and hair. \n15. Ofc. Alan and Nurse Crenshaw heard Plaintiff screaming in pain. \n16. Watt led Plaintiff back to her cell in the same violent fashion, kicked Ms. Coopwood in \nthe stomach extremely hard with her heavy black boot and promptly returned to her guard desk.  \n17. Ofc. Alan said to Watt that she did not have to do that. \n18. Nurse Crenshaw left and returned about an hour later with Tylenol. \n19. Plaintiff was in severe pain after being kicked and dragged by Watt; cramping on the \nright side, with a bloody discharge from her vagina. \n20. Plaintiff remained in thriving pain for the rest of the day but was not treated by a \nphysician. \n21. Plaintiff continued to complain of said pain and her bloody discharge, neither of which \nabated for days thereafter.   \n22. Finally, after Ms. Coopwoodโs condition did not improve she was taken to Hutzel \nHospital on or about August 19, 2017.  \n  3 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-AJT-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 08/04/20    PageID.4    Page 4 of 10\n23. At Hutzel, it was discovered that the Plaintiffโs unborn fetus, she had affectionately \nnamed โDaytonโ was in critical condition.  \n24. Plaintiff stayed at Hutzel for another day or two, but remained in pain thereafter for the \nnext month, whereby she continued to have  blood discharge from her vagina. \n25. After multiple other visits to Hutzel, it was determined that the pregnancy had to be \nterminated, and therefore, Ms. Coopwood lost her child Dayton. \n26. Accordingly, as a result of the excessive force and gross negligence of Sgt. Watt and the \nWayne County Jail, Ms. Coopwood lost her baby Dayton. \n27. Ms. Coopwood brings the instant lawsuit to enforce her constitutional rights and \nequitable remedies for the egregious and unconstitutional actions of Defendants Watt and the \nWayne County Jail. \nCAUSE OF ACTION ONE \nViolation Of Civil Rights Under 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983 \n(EXCESSIVE FORCE IN VIOLATION OF THE \n FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT'S DUE PROCESS AND EQUAL PROTECTION \nCLAUSE) \n \n28. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 27, \ninclusive, as though set forth in full herein. \n29. Sgt. Watt used excessive force against Plaintiff, in violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clause. \n30. Sgt. Wattโs use of that force was objectively unreasonable. \n31. Sgt. Watt was an employee or official for the County of Wayne, at the Wayne County Jail \nacting in her capacity as a jail guard, when the incident against Plaintiff occurred. \n  4 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-AJT-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 08/04/20    PageID.5    Page 5 of 10\n32. Sgt. Watt was acting under color of state and federal law in her capacity as a jail guard \nfor the County when she used excessive force against Plaintiff. \n33. Sgt. Watt and Wayne County deprived Plaintiff of a right secured by the constitution of \nMichigan and the United States, when Sgt. Watt used excessive force against her, namely, \nPlaintiffโs rights of due process and equal protection under the 14  Amendment were violated. \nth\n34. Defendants used excessive force against Plaintiff when she was a pretrial detainee. \n35. The excessive force used by Defendants in violation of Plaintiffโs constitutional rights \noccurred when Sgt. Watt grabbed Plaintiffโs hand, bent her fingers back, dragged her by her \nfingers and hair, and kicked plaintiff hard in her belly while she was pregnant. \n36. Ms. Coopwood posed absolutely no threat or danger to Sgt. Watt, and her actions were \nnot rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective or her actions were excessive in \nrelation to that purpose. \n37. Sgt. Wattโs use of force was unreasonable under the circumstances. \n38. Further, as a pretrial detainee, this excessive force used, amounted to a punishment \nagainst Ms. Coopwood, which the Due Process Clause protects. Sgt. Wattโs force was as a result \nof her agitation for having being disturbed, not for any other purpose whatsoever. \n39. The actions taken against Ms. Coopwood by Watt, were not rationally related to a \nlegitimate nonpunitive governmental purpose and the actions were excessive in relation to that \npurpose.  \n40. As a result of Wattโs decision to employ unreasonable and unnecessary violence against \nthe Plaintiff, Ms. Coopwood lost her unborn child. \n41. As a direct result of these Defendantsโ violations, and in accordance with 42 U.S.C. \nยง1983, Plaintiffโs civil rights have been violated in that she has suffered an incalculable loss of \n  5 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-AJT-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 08/04/20    PageID.6    Page 6 of 10\nher unborn baby, and the love and affection that comes from that blessed relationship and a \nlifetime worth of memories and support that were destroyed as a result of the Defendantsโ \nindefensible actions. \n42. In addition to the loss of her baby, Plaintiff physically suffered excruciating pain of \nwhich she was forced to endure for months, along with frequent bloody vaginal discharge, \nextreme mental anguish, anxiety emotional distress, depression, anxiety, and PTSD. \n43. Plaintiff is entitled to attorneyโs fees, costs and expenses in this matter, as authorized by \n42 U.S.C. ยง1988 in an amount not yet ascertained, all of which shall be shown according to \nproof at trial. \n44. Defendantsโ wrongful conduct as herein alleged was done with reckless disregard for the \nrights of the Plaintiff, and as a result of such conduct, Plaintiff is therefore entitled to recover \npunitive and exemplary damages from said Defendantsโ wrongful acts for the purposes of \npunishing said Defendants and to deter others from such conduct \nin the future. \nCAUSE OF ACTION TWO \nViolation Of Civil Rights Under 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983 \n(EXCESSIVE FORCE IN VIOLATION OF THE \n FOURTH AMENDMENT AGAINST UNREASONABLE SEIZURES) \n \n45. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 44, \ninclusive, as though set forth in full herein. \n46. As demonstrated above, Sgt. Watt used excessive force when she seized Ms. Coopwood \nin violation of the Fourth Amendment. \n47. Sgt. Wattโs use of such force to effectuate the seizure and kicking of Ms. Coopwood was \nobjectively unreasonable. \n  6 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-AJT-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 08/04/20    PageID.7    Page 7 of 10\n48. Ms. Coopwood posed no immediate threat to Sgt. Watt or to the safety of any officers or \nothers and was not resisting arrest or seizure or attempting to evade seizure or arrest by flight. \n \nCAUSE OF ACTION THREE \nViolation Of Civil Rights Under 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983 \n(EXCESSIVE FORCE IN VIOLATION OF THE \n EIGHTTH AMENDMENT AGAINST) \n \n49. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 48, \ninclusive, as though set forth in full herein. \n50. The use of force by Defendants was excessive and violated Plaintiffโs Eighth Amendment \nrights when said force was not applied in an effort to maintain or restore discipline, but rather to \nonly cause harm. \n51. Sgt. Watt used excessive force in her physical contact with Plaintiff that was meant to \ninjure Plaintiff and not for any other legal purpose. \n52. The foregoing actions, taken by the defendants were in gross and wanton violation of \nPlaintiffโs constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment, including her rights against cruel \nand unusual punishment.  \n \nCAUSE OF ACTION FOUR \nViolation Of Civil Rights Under 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983 \n(DELIBERATE INDIFFERENCE IN VIOLATION OF THE \n EIGHTTH AMENDMENT AGAINST) \n \n53. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 52, \ninclusive, as though set forth in full herein. \n  7 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-AJT-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 08/04/20    PageID.8    Page 8 of 10\n54. Jail officials, and their staff, were deliberately indifferent to Plaintiffโs medical conditions \nfollowing the excessive force from Sgt. Watt in violation of the Eighth Amendment and 42 USC \n1983.  \n55. Jail officials knew about Plaintiffโs pregnancy, and the pain and bloody discharge from \nher vagina following the assault from Defendant Watt, and failed to provide medical exams, \nsustainable relief, or immediate medical attention. \n56. Plaintiff had serious medical need for her pregnancy. \n57. Said medical conditions mandated immediate treatment that was so obvious, even a lay \nperson would easily recognize the necessity for a doctorโs prompt attention. Instead, Defendants \nwaited days until they took Plaintiff to the hospital where her unborn child Dayton was already \nin critical condition.  \n58. Defendants had a sufficiently culpable state of mind with respect to Plaintiffโs medical \ncondition, given that they failed to take her within a reasonable period of time to either the \ninfirmary, or hospital for several days, despite her constant pleas, and evident need for competent \nmedical attention. \n59. As such, the risk of harm to Plaintiff and her unborn child was obvious; and the average \nperson would easily recognizeโwhether from observing the Plaintiff or being told of her \nsymptomsโthat the plaintiffโs condition needed proper and immediate treatment. \n60. The foregoing actions, taken by the defendants against Defendants were in gross and \nwanton violation of Plaintiffโs constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment, including her \nrights against cruel and unusual punishment.  \n \nCAUSE OF ACTION FIVE \nGROSS NEGLIGENCE \n  8 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-AJT-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 08/04/20    PageID.9    Page 9 of 10\n61. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 60, \ninclusive, as though set forth in full herein. \n62. Defendants had a duty towards Plaintiff while she was incarcerated. \n63. Defendants breached this duty and showed gross negligence when Sgt. Watt dragged \nPlaintiff by her hand and hair.   and kicked her extremely hard in the belly. \n64. Defendants further breached this duty and showed gross negligence when Sgt. Watt \nkicked Ms. Coopwood extremely hard in the belly \n65. Defendants conduct was so reckless as to demonstrate a substantial lack of concern for \nwhether an injury would result to Plaintiff or her unborn child. \n66. Defendants breach of the standard of care was the proximate cause of Plaintiffโs injuries \nand led to the termination of her pregnancy.  \n67. Plaintiff suffered damages and injuries as a result of the Defendantsโ gross negligence. \n \nPRAYER \n  WHEREFORE Plaintiff respectfully requests damages in excess of $1,000,000.00, \ninterest costs, and attorney fees, and for any further relief the court deems just and appropriate. \nPlaintiff further prays for all relief she is entitled to under 42 U.S.C. ยง1983 and 42 U.S.C. ยง1988, \nincluding, attorneyโs fees, costs and expenses and to recover punitive and exemplary damages \nfrom said Defendantsโ wrongful acts for the purposes of punishing said Defendants and to deter \nothers from such conduct in the future in an amount to be determined at trial. \nJURY DEMAND \n  Plaintiff requests a trial by jury on all issues so triable. \n              Respectfully submitted, \n                  THE LANDAU GROUP \n  9 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-AJT-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 08/04/20    PageID.10    Page 10 of 10\n \nBy:  \n  /s/ Kevin A.

Case No. 20-12092  \n                     Honorable Victoria A. Roberts  \nCOUNTY OF WAYNE ET AL.,  \n  \n   Defendants.  \n______________________________/  \n  \nORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTSโ MOTION TO DISMISS [ECF 5] \n  \nI.  Introduction \nJaquetta Coopwood (โCoopwoodโ) filed a civil rights action against \ndefendants โ the County of Wayne (โWayne Countyโ) and Sgt. Deputy Jonith \nWatts (โWattsโ) โ alleging official misconduct.  Coopwood says Watt used \nexcessive force on her and injured her.  She also says Wayne County failed \nto properly treat her injuries.  At the time of the alleged excessive force, \nCoopwood was pregnant.  Coopwood alleges that her injuries caused her to \nmiscarry.  \nIn their motion to dismiss, defendants contend that Coopwood failed \nto exhaust administrative remedies.   \nThe Court GRANTS defendantsโ motion to dismiss.   \n1  \n  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-VAR-DRG   ECF No. 22, PageID.342   Filed 03/28/22   Page 2 of 14\n \nII. Background  \nOn August 13, 2017, Wayne County took Coopwood into custody for \nsecond-degree murder and placed her at the Wayne County jail.  She was \napproximately six months pregnant then.  On September 17, 2018, the \nWayne  County  Circuit  Court  found  Coopwood  guilty  of  second-degree \nmurder.  Coopwood is serving an 18-year sentence at the Womenโs Huron \nValley Correctional Facility. \nCoopwood alleges that on August 17, 2017, while she was a pre-trial \ndetainee at the Wayne County jail, she walked to the deputy desk in her unit \nand asked Deputy Watt if she could use the phone to contact her sister.  \nCoopwood alleges that when she asked Watt this question, Watt grabbed \nher right hand, bent it back, and dragged her back to her cell by her fingers \nand hair, and kicked her in the stomach.  Coopwood alleges that other \nWayne County jail officials witnessed this alleged assault. \nCoopwood  complained  to  jail  officials  for  a  couple  days  about  a \nthrobbing pain she experienced from their alleged assault.  In particular, \nCoopwood experienced bloody discharge from her vagina.  Coopwoodโs \ncondition did not improve, and she was taken to Hutzel Hospital in Detroit \naround  August  19,  2017.    While  at  Hutzel,  doctors  discovered  that \n2  \n  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-VAR-DRG   ECF No. 22, PageID.343   Filed 03/28/22   Page 3 of 14\n \nCoopwoodโs unborn fetus was in critical condition.  Coopwood remained in \nthe hospital for a day or two before being discharged.  After subsequent \nvisits  to  the  hospital,  it  was  determined  that  her  pregnancy  had  to  be \nterminated. \nIII. Legal Standard \nDefendants  do  not  categorize  their  motion  to  dismiss  as  either  a \n12(b)(6) or a summary judgment motion.   \nโThe  federal  rules  require  that  if,  in  a  12(b)(6)  motion  to  dismiss, \nโmatters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the \ncourt, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule \n56.โ  Wysocki v. International Business Machine Corp., 607 F.3d 1102, 1104 \n(6th Cir. 2010); see also FED. R. CIV. P. 12(d).  โThe summary judgment \nmotion is especially well suited to pretrial adjudication of an exhaustion \ndefense, because proof of lack of exhaustion generally requires resort to \nmatters outside the pleadings, such as affidavits or documentary evidence.โ  \nAnderson v. Jutzy, 175 F.Supp.3d 781, 787 (E.D. Mich. 2016). \nDefendantsโ motion to dismiss contains an affidavit from a jail official, \nand  the  Wayne  County  Jail  Operationโs  Manual.    Both  exhibits  are \nintroduced to show that Coopwood did not exhaust available administrative \n3  \n  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-VAR-DRG   ECF No. 22, PageID.344   Filed 03/28/22   Page 4 of 14\n \nremedies.  Consequently, the Court construes defendantsโ motion to dismiss \nas one for summary judgment. \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a), โ[t]he Court shall grant \nsummary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as \nto any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of \nlaw.โ  The movant bears the initial burden to inform the Court of the basis \nfor  her  motion  and  must  identify  particular  portions  of  the  record  that \ndemonstrate the absence of a genuine dispute as to any material fact. \nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  If the movant satisfies \nher burden, the non-moving party must set forth specific facts showing a \ngenuine issue for trial. Id. at 324.  A genuine issue of material fact exists โif \nthe evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the \nnonmoving  party.โ  Anderson  v.  Liberty  Lobby,  Inc.,  477  U.S.  242,  248 \n(1986).  Unsupported, conclusory statements are insufficient to establish a \nfactual dispute to defeat summary judgment, as is the mere existence of a \nscintilla of evidence in support of the non-movantโs position; the evidence \nmust be such that a reasonable jury could find in its favor. Alexander v. \nCareSource, 576 F.3d 551, 560 (6th Cir. 2009); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, \nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 252 (1986). \n4  \n  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-VAR-DRG   ECF No. 22, PageID.345   Filed 03/28/22   Page 5 of 14\n \nIn deciding a summary judgment motion, the Court โviews the factual \nevidence and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving \nparty.โ McLean v. 988011 Ontario, Ltd., 224 F.3d 797, 800 (6th Cir. 2000). \nThe Court only needs to consider the cited materials, but it may consider \nother evidence in the record. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3).  The Courtโs function \nat the summary judgment stage โis not to weigh the evidence and determine \nthe truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for \ntrial.โ Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 249. \nIV.  Analysis  \nUnder the Prison Litigation Reform Act (โPLRAโ), a prisoner cannot \nbring  an  action  challenging  prison  conditions  unless  she  exhausts \nadministrative  remedies.  42  USC  ยง  1997e(a).  โThis  requirement  is  not \njurisdictional;  rather,  exhaustion  is  an  affirmative  defense  that  must  be \npleaded and proved by the defendants.โ Mattox v. Edelman, 851 F.3d 583, \n590 (6th Cir. 2017).  Claims of excessive force must be exhausted.  Freeman \nv. Francis, 196 F.3d 641, 643 (6th Cir. 1999).   \nโThere is no question that exhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA \nand that unexhausted claims cannot be brought into court.โ  Jones v. Bock, \n549 U.S. 199, 211 (2007).  Generally, inmates must exhaust through their \n5  \n  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-VAR-DRG   ECF No. 22, PageID.346   Filed 03/28/22   Page 6 of 14\n \nprisonโs  comprehensive  grievance  process.   The  prisonโs  process \ndetermines when and if a prisoner has properly exhausted her claim.  Id. at \n218.  \nThe Wayne County jail grievance process is that inmates must file a \ngrievance:  (1)  for  alleged  violations  of  civil  rights  or  statutory  laws;  (2) \nalleged violations of the Sheriffโs Office policy; (3) to appeal a disciplinary \ndecision, and (4) for alleged unsafe and unsanitary living conditions.

The Wayne County \npolicy  defines  a  grievance  as  โ[a]  written  complaint  filed  by  an  inmate \nconcerning personal health and safety or the operation and services of the \nfacility.โ  Id.  If an inmate is unable to resolve her complaint through informal \ncontact with staff, she must obtain an โInmate Grievance Form,โ and submit \nthe form within 10-days from the date of the alleged incident of complaint.  \nThe inmate must sign the grievance form and give it to a staff person.  \nInmates  are  provided  with  this  grievance  procedure  during  their  intake \nprocess.  It is undisputed that Coopwood was provided with the details of \nthe grievance procedure during intake. \nA. Exhaustion for Complaint of Excessive Force \n6  \n  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-VAR-DRG   ECF No. 22, PageID.347   Filed 03/28/22   Page 7 of 14\n \nCoopwood argues that โit is clear that [she] filed her grievance related \nto the incident with Sgt. Watt and her need for medical care immediately \nafter the incident happened.  Her medical condition did not improve so she \ncontinued to complain, and was taken to the hospital a few days later where \nshe received medical treatmentโฆโ  [ECF No. 16; PageID. 106].   \nCoopwood erroneously argues that her oral complaints to jail staff \nabout  her  pain  from  the  alleged  assault  constitute  a  grievance.    Oral \ncomplaints are not a grievance as defined in the Wayne County jail manual.  \nWayne Countyโs grievance procedure requires the inmate to file a written \ngrievance and submit it to a staff member.   \nCoopwood also argues that she filed another grievance when her \nsister asked the Wayne County jail how Coopwood lost her unborn child.  \nCoopwood says, โthere is little doubt that Plaintiff and her sister substantially \ncomplied with the grievance procedures of the jail.โ  [ECF No. 16; PageID. \n107].    Again,  Coopwood  erroneously  asserts  that  oral  complaints  and \ninquiries  satisfy  the  Wayne  County  jail  grievance  procedure.    But  the \ngrievance process makes no mention of third-party inquiries as an approach \nto satisfy an inmateโs exhaustion requirement. \n7  \n  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-VAR-DRG   ECF No. 22, PageID.348   Filed 03/28/22   Page 8 of 14\n \nDefendants bear the initial burden of production and persuasion on the \nissue of exhaustion.  Surles v. Andison, 678 F.3d 452, 458 (6th Cir. 2012) \n(โA PLRA defendant bears the burden of proving that a PLRA plaintiff has \nnot exhausted his administrative remedies.โ).  \nDefendants  claim  there  is  no  record  of  Coopwood  filing  a  written \ngrievance in accordance with the jail grievance process.  In support of their \nclaim, defendants submitted a signed affidavit from the Director of Internal \nCompliance for the Wayne County Sheriffโs Office stating that the Wayne \nCounty  jail  has  no  record  of  a  Coopwood  grievance  regarding  alleged \nassaultive behavior by Sgt. Watt.  The absence of such a record is consistent \nwith Coopwoodโs argument, since she does not claim that she ever filed a \nwritten grievance.  Instead, Coopwood relies on her oral complaints to the \nofficers as a grievance.  \nโAn inmate exhausts a claim by taking advantage of each step the \nprison holds out for resolving the claim internally and by following the โcritical \nprocedural rulesโ of the prison's grievance process to permit prison officials \nto review and, if necessary, correct the grievance โon the meritsโ in the first \ninstance.โ  Reed-Bey v. Pramstaller, 603 F.3d 322, 324 (6th Cir. 2010) (citing \nWoodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 95 (2006). \n8  \n  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-VAR-DRG   ECF No. 22, PageID.349   Filed 03/28/22   Page 9 of 14\n \nCoopwood did not do this.  Oral complaints and inquiries do not equate \nto a grievance for purposes of exhaustion.  It would be difficult for prison \nsystems to confirm and investigate all oral complaints if they were construed \nas grievances.   \nThe  Court  finds  that  Coopwood  failed  to  exhaust  administrative \nremedies. \nB. Mental Capacity Exception to the Exhaustion Requirement \nThe PLRA requires a prisoner to exhaust administrative remedies that \nare available to her.  42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(a).   \nThe  Court  entered  an  order  requesting  that  the  parties  file \nsupplemental briefs addressing whether the Wayne County jail grievance \nprocess was โavailableโ to Coopwood given her alleged history of mental \nhealth  impairments.    In  Coopwoodโs  response  to  defendantsโ  motion  to \ndismiss she states that she has been diagnosed with bipolar schizophrenia, \nand prescribed a variety of medications and therapeutic interventions to treat \nor alleviate mental health issues. \nPlaintiff  relies  on  Braswell  v.  Corrections  Corp.  of  America,  419 \nF.Appx. 622 (6th Cir. 2011) which held that a prisonerโs mental impairments \nmay  render  administrative  remedies  unavailable  to  the  prisoner, \n9  \n  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-VAR-DRG   ECF No. 22, PageID.350   Filed 03/28/22   Page 10 of 14\n \nconsequently excusing the prisoner from the grievance process.  Id. at 625-\n26. \nCoopwood argues that the grievance process was not available to her \nbecause: (1) she had a history of serious psychiatric conditions, including \nbipolar schizophrenia; (2) Coopwood submitted an affidavit and testified that \nshe was taken off her medications because of her pregnancy, which greatly \naffected her mental health and ability to understand or process information; \n(3) she was housed in the psychiatric unit of the Wayne County jail during \nher incarceration; and (4) she was taken to DMC Hospital for several days \nfollowing the alleged assault.  Although Coopwoodโs supplemental briefing \nis contrary to Coopwoodโs position in her complaint and responsive briefing \nthat  she  properly  filed  a  grievance,  the  Court  considers  whether  the \ngrievance process was unavailable to Coopwood because of her mental \nhealth issues.  \nDefendantsโ  supplemental  brief  contends  that  the  PLRA  does  not \ncontain a mental capacity exception.  In support of this position, defendants \ncite to Williams v. White, 724 Fed.Appx. 380 (6th Cir. 2018).  Williams held \nโthere is no mental-capacity exception to the PLRA.โ  Id. at 383.   \n10  \n  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-VAR-DRG   ECF No. 22, PageID.351   Filed 03/28/22   Page 11 of 14\n \nIn Williams, the prisoner brought a 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 action seeking \ndamages for his time in solitary confinement without first filing a grievance.  \nId. 382.  The district court dismissed his ยง 1983 action because he failed to \nexhaust available administrative remedies.  The prisoner argued that the \ngrievance process was unavailable to him due to his mental impairments.  \nThe Sixth Circuit concluded that โadministrative remedies are not โavailableโ \nin a practical sense if the remedial process is โso opaqueโ that โno ordinary \nprisoner can make sense of itโโ.  Id. at 383 (citing Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. \n632, 644 (2016)).  However, if ordinary prisoners can make sense of the \nremedial  process,  it  is  available  notwithstanding  a  prisonerโs  mental \ncapacity.  Id. \nAlthough it does appear that in Braswell the Sixth Circuit held that a \nprisonerโs mental capacity may raise a genuine dispute as to whether the \ngrievance process was available to that prisoner, the plain language in \nWilliams seems to overturn that earlier decision.  Braswell, a 2011 decision, \npredated  the  Supreme  Courtโs  Ross  v.  Blake  decision  in  2016.    Ross \nexpressly precluded โa โspecial circumstancesโ exception to [PLRAโs] rule of \nexhaustion.โ  Ross, 578 U.S. at 641.  The rationale for this preclusion is that \ncourts could โlook to all the particulars of a case to decide whether to excuse \n11  \n  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-VAR-DRG   ECF No. 22, PageID.352   Filed 03/28/22   Page 12 of 14\n \na failure to exhaust available remedies.โ  Id.  Williams, a 2018 case, relies \non Rossโs prohibition against carving out special exceptions to the PLRA.   \nWilliams seems most logical.  Some cognitive impairments are more \nsevere  than  others.    In  fact,  the  Court  does  believe  there  are  certain \nimpairments  that  would  render  a  prisoner  incapable  of  understanding  a \nprison grievance process.  On the other end of the spectrum, an overarching \nmental  capacity  exception  would  permit  a  prisoner  with  the  slightest \nimpairment to bypass the grievance process in its entirety and immediately \nseek relief from the federal judiciary.  The Court finds it difficult to draw the \nline between those impairments that would give rise to an exception from \nthe exhaustion requirement and those impairments that do not rise to that \nlevel.   \nThe Court agrees with defendants.  Williams supersedes Braswell.  \nCoopwood fails to address Williams in her supplemental briefing. \nCoopwoodโs alleged mental defects did not render the Wayne County \njailโs grievance process โunavailableโ to her.  Moreover, Coopwood does not \nclaim that the exhaustion process is so opaque that no ordinary prisoner can \nmake sense of it.  The Court interprets the Wayne County jailโs exhaustion \nprocess to be understandable to the ordinary prisoner.  \n12  \n  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-VAR-DRG   ECF No. 22, PageID.353   Filed 03/28/22   Page 13 of 14\n \nCoopwoodโs  final  argument  as  to  why  the  grievance  process  was \nunavailable to her is that she was taken to DMC Hospital for several days \nfollowing  the  assault.    She  suggests  she  was  not  able  to  file  a  written \ngrievance  within  ten  days  of  the  alleged  assault  because  she  was \nhospitalized.   \nCoopwood was at the DMC Hospital for two days during the grievance \nfiling period.  Even after the 10-day period lapsed, Coopwood never filed a \ngrievance.  The Court believes that if Coopwood did file a grievance at some \npoint and there was an issue as to the timeliness of the filing, the Court \nwould then need to consider whether her absence from the jail necessitated \nan extension to file a grievance.  That is not the case here.  From August \n17, 2017, when the alleged assault occurred, to October 5, 2018, when the \nWayne  County  Court  sentenced  Coopwood,  there  is  no  indication  that \nCoopwood filed a grievance.  She had over a year to reduce her allegations \nto  writing  and  failed  to  do  so.    Additionally,  there  is  no  mention  in \nCoopwoodโs pleadings or supplemental briefing that she sought assistance \nduring this period to file a grievance. \n13  \n  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-VAR-DRG   ECF No. 22, PageID.354   Filed 03/28/22   Page 14 of 14\n \nV. Conclusion  \nCoopwood  failed  to  exhaust  available  administrative  remedies  in \naccordance with the Wayne County jail grievance process.  She is precluded \nfrom bringing a federal claim.  42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(a).  The Sixth Circuit does \nnot recognize a mental capacity exception that would render the process \nunavailable to her. \nConstruing  defendantsโ  motion  to  dismiss  as    one  for  summary \njudgment, the Court finds there are no genuine issues of material fact. \nThe Court GRANTS defendantsโ judgment as a matter of law. \nIT IS ORDERED.   \n \n              s/ Victoria A.

Watt. (D.E. #1). Her allegations are that on August 17, 2017, while \nshe was pregnant and housed at the Wayne County Jail Division 1, awaiting trial, a \nWayne County Sgt. Watt kicked her in her stomach, dragged her to her cell, and \nthis force allegedly caused inmate Coopwood to sometime later miscarry the fetus. \n(D.E.  #1).    There  are  no  incident  reports  evidencing  this  incident,  nor  any \ngrievance filed by Plaintiff Coopwood alleging mistreatment by Sgt. Watt or any \nother Wayne County Jail employee.  \nAs explained below, because Plaintiff was incarcerated when she filed this \nlawsuit, the Prison Litigation Reform Act (the โPLRAโ) required her to exhaust \nfully  her  administrative  remedies  with  the  Wayne  County  Jail  before  filing  a \nfederal civil rights lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. Plaintiff did not fully exhaust \nher administrative remedies and remains in custody at the Huron Valley Womenโs \nCorrectional  Facility  at  time  of  the  filing  of  this  motion.  (Ex.  4-Offender \nTracking System โOTISโ printout).   \n \n \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-VAR-DRG   ECF No. 5, PageID.23   Filed 09/30/20   Page 7 of 10\nARGUMENT \n \nPLAINTIFFโS  COMPLAINT  MUST  BE  DISMISSED  WITHOUT \nPREJUDICE UNDER THE PRISONER LITIGATION REFORM ACT, AS \nSHE FAILED TO EXHAUST HER ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES WITH \nTHE WAYNE COUNTY JAIL \n \n  Under  the  PLRA,  prisoners  are  required  to  exhaust  their  internal \nadministrative remedies with a facility before filing a civil rights lawsuit in federal \ncourt under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  42 U.S.C. ยง 1997(e); see Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. \n516, 532 (2002).  This includes meeting all deadlines and applicable procedural \nrules.  Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 90-91 (2006).  โThere is no question that \nexhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA and that unexhausted claims cannot be \nbrought in court.โ  Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 212 (2007) (citation omitted).  \nThis requirement includes pursuing all required internal appeals of any unfavorable \nresolutions.  See, e.g., Freeman v. Francis, 196 F.3d 641, 645 (6th Cir. 1999).  โA \nplaintiffโs failure to exhaust cannot be excused by his ignorance of the law or the \ngrievance policy.โ  Napier v. Laurel County, 636 F.3d 218, 221 n. 2 (6th Cir. \n2011); Barassi v. Lewis, No. 18-6255, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 18297, *3-4 (6th \nCir. June 18, 2019) (unpublished) (same).  \nA.  The Applicable Wayne County Jail Grievance Policy. (Ex. 1) \nAt all relevant times, the Wayne County Jail has maintained official policies \nregarding  the  provision,  processing,  and  investigation  of  inmate  grievances.  \n(Exhibit  1,  Director  Crawford  Decl.).  At  the  time  of  intake,  all  inmates  are \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-VAR-DRG   ECF No. 5, PageID.24   Filed 09/30/20   Page 8 of 10\nprovided  a  copy  of  the  โInmate  Handbookโ  which  describes  the  mandatory \ngrievance process.  (Id.; Ex 3-A-Inmate Handbook Excerpt). In sum, an inmate \nmust file a grievance on any unsatisfactory condition of confinement within ten \n(10)  days  of  the  incident  complained  of.  (Id.).  To  exhaust  a  claim  fully,  if \nunsatisfied with the response and/or resolution to the issue, the inmate must appeal \nthe decision.(Id.). Copies of the Inmate Handbook were distributed upon Plaintiffsโ \nentry into the Wayne County Jail and she acknowledged receipt of same.   \nB.  Jaquetta Coopwood Did Not Exhaust Her Administrative Remedies.  \n \nOn August 16, 2017, Jaquetta Coopwood was held in the Wayne County Jail \npending a bench trial on the charges of Homicide โ Murder-Second Degree. (Ex.2-\nCriminal  Docket  Case  No:  17-010699-01-FCC).    She  was  committed  to  the \ncustody of the Wayne County Jail pending trial. (Ex. 5-Booking Card).   \nOn September 17, 2018, she was found guilty by a Bench Trial of violation \nof Mich. Comp. Laws 750.317. (Id.). She was sentenced to prison on October 5, \n2018, and transferred to the custody of the Michigan Department of Corrections on \nOctober  10,  2018,  where  she  is  currently  being  held  in  the  Huron  Valley \nCorrectional  Facility.  (Id.;  Ex.  4,  Offender  Tracking  Information  Status \nReport).  \n  Plaintiff Coopwood filed no grievances while in the Wayne County Jail in \n2017 or 2018. (See Ex. 1, Director Crawford Declaration). She is currently still \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-12092-VAR-DRG   ECF No. 5, PageID.25   Filed 09/30/20   Page 9 of 10\nincarcerated with the Michigan Department of Corrections. Therefore, her failure \nto file a grievance with the Wayne County jail is governed solely by the PLRA and \nthis  action  must  be  dismissed  without  prejudice  for  failing  to  follow  the \nadministrative remedies available to her at the Wayne County jail.   \nFurthermore, no unfairness results to Coopwood in applying such a rule, \nbecause once she is released, she is permitted to file a lawsuit for money damages \non any subject free and clear of any prior PLRA constraints. See Cox v. Mayer, 332 \nF.3d 422, 424-27 (6th Cir. 2003).  However, when a prisoner fails to comply with \nthe PLRA while incarcerated, then later is released during the pendency of the \nlawsuit, the proper course is to dismiss the prior case without prejudice to permit \nthe individual to re-file the lawsuit if he or she wishes.
