    "summary": "<p>This case is about the Oneida County Board of Elections not processing timely-filed voter registration applications before the 2020 election. New York&rsquo;s voter registration deadline for the 2020 election was October 9, 2020. However, the Oneida County Board of Elections stopped processing online voter registrations&mdash;including those submitted and received electronically from the DMV&mdash;beginning on September 25, 2020. As a result, the Board failed to add approximately 2,418 applicants who registered at the DMV to the official list of eligible voters for the 2020 election. After the election, the Board rejected nearly 1,800 provisional ballots without reviewing or otherwise canvasing them. The Board did not disclose its failure to process the timely filed DMV applications until January 6, 2021.</p>\r\n<p>On July 12, 2021, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York. The DOJ sued the Oneida County Board of Elections under Section 8 of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA), 52 U.S.C. &sect; 20507, and Section 302 of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA), 52 U.S.C. &sect; 21082. The DOJ sought an order 1) declaring that the Board had violated Section 8 of the NVRA and Section 302 of the HAVA; 2) permanently enjoining the Board from failing to process voter registration applications or failing to notify voter applicants as to the disposition of their registration applications; 3) permanently enjoining the Board to promptly verify all provisional ballots; and 4) directing the Board to submit a remedial plan to ensure future compliance with the NVRA and HAVA. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Mae A. D'Agostino.</p>\r\n<p>On July 13, 2021, the parties agreed to the entry of a consent decree. The consent decree provided all the relief sought by the DOJ and detailed the requirements for the Board&rsquo;s remedial plan. On January 17, 2025, following the 2024 election, the Board provided a compliance report to the DOJ. On March 19, 2025, the DOJ informed the Board that it had demonstrated compliance with the consent decree. On March 31, 2025, both parties stipulated that it was appropriate to terminate the consent decree, which the court approved.</p>",

The Attorney General files this action for declaratory and injunctive relief to\nenforce Section 8 of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (“NVRA”), 52 U.S.C. § 20507, \nand Section 302 of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (“HAVA”), 52 U.S.C. § 21082. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2. Jurisdiction is vested in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1345, and 2201,\nand 52 U.S.C. §§ 20510(a) and 21111. \n3. Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 112(a) and 1391(b).\nPARTIES \n4. Plaintiff United States of America seeks declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant\nto Section 11 of the NVRA, 52 U.S.C. § 20510(a), and Section 401 of HAVA, 52 U.S.C. \n§205111, which authorize the Attorney General to bring suit to enforce those federal statutes.\n5. Defendant Oneida County Board of Elections (“Oneida BOE”) is a state-created\nbipartisan two-member commission appointed by the legislative body of Oneida County, New \nYork.  The Oneida BOE is responsible, inter alia, for voter registration—including accepting and \n\nCase 6:21-cv-00793-MAD-ATB   Document 1   Filed 07/12/21   Page 2 of 9\nprocessing applications and determining the eligibility of applicants to vote—for United States \ncitizens residing in Oneida County, New York; for supervising the conduct of elections in that \ncounty; and for canvassing all ballots cast in the election, including provisional ballots, and \nreporting election returns in that county.  \n  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nThe Federal General Election in \nNew York’s 22nd Congressional District \n6.  On November 3, 2020, election jurisdictions across the United States of America, \nincluding in the 22nd congressional district of New York, conducted a general election in which \ncandidates for President of the United States and the Congress of the United States were on the \nballot.  \n7.  New York’s 22nd congressional district encompasses all of Oneida County, New \nYork, within the election jurisdiction of Defendant Oneida BOE.  \nState Court Litigation \n8.  On November 4, 2020, Claudia Tenney, a candidate for United States \nRepresentative in New York’s 22nd congressional district, initiated an election challenge against \nnumerous defendants, including the Oneida BOE and other county boards of elections, in the \nOswego County Supreme Court to preserve her right to judicial review relating to several \ndisputed ballots cast or attempted to be cast in the election.  The incumbent candidate, Anthony \nBrindisi, crossclaimed for similar relief.  Tenney v. Oswego Cnty. Bd. of Elec., No. EFC-2020-\n1376 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.) (Hon. Scott J. DelConte). \n9.  The court heard 11 days of testimony from 19 witnesses and reviewed a vast \nevidentiary record.  Tenney v. Oswego Cnty. Bd. of Elec., No. EFC-2020-1376, 2021 WL \n454409, at *2 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Feb. 5, 2021).  It found that the defendant county boards of \nPage 2 of 9 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-00793-MAD-ATB   Document 1   Filed 07/12/21   Page 3 of 9\nelections, including the Oneida BOE, had committed numerous state election law violations \nregarding the processing of voter registrations and the review and canvassing of ballots.  Tenney \nv. Oswego Cnty. Bd. of Elec., 136 N.Y.S.3d 853, 861 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2020) \nFacts Relevant to the NVRA and HAVA \n10.  New York’s voter registration deadline is 25 days before the ensuing election.  \nN.Y. Elec. Law § 5-201(3).  For the November 3, 2020, federal general election, that deadline \nwas October 9, 2020. \n11.  County boards of elections must review and process each voter application form \nupon its receipt.  Id. § 5-201(8).   \n12.  A qualified individual is “registered” to vote as soon as her completed voter \nregistration application is received by the appropriate county board of elections.  Id. § 5-210(3). \n13.  All registered voters must be entered into New York’s statewide voter registration \ndatabase, known as “NYSVoter.”  Id. § 5-614.   \n14.  The Oneida BOE ceased processing online voter registration applications—\nincluding those submitted at and received electronically from Department of Motor Vehicle \n(“DMV”) offices—beginning on September 25, 2020, 15 days before the October 9, 2020, \nstatutory deadline. \n15.  Between September 25, 2020 and October 9, 2020, the Oneida BOE received by \nelectronic means approximately 2,418 voter registration applications completed by Oneida \nCounty residents attempting to register to vote at offices of the DMV.   \n16.  Defendant Oneida BOE failed to review or otherwise process those approximately \n2,418 timely submitted voter registration applications.   \n17.  As a result of that failure, the Oneida BOE failed to add the names of those DMV \nPage 3 of 9 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-00793-MAD-ATB   Document 1   Filed 07/12/21   Page 4 of 9\napplicants qualified to register to vote to the official list of eligible voters for the November 3, \n2020, general election.  \n18.  On information and belief, Defendant Oneida BOE failed to notify the \napproximately 2,418 DMV voter registration applicants as to the disposition of their voter \nregistration application in time for the November 3, 2020, general election. \n19.  The Oneida BOE did not publicly disclose its failure to process the 2,418 timely \nsubmitted DMV applications until January 6, 2021, over two months after election day.  \n20.  At least 68 qualified and eligible voters from among the 2,418 DMV applicants \nattempted to vote in the November 3, 2020, general election, but were notified by polling \nofficials that they were not registered.  Poll officials required those voters to cast provisional \nballots (known in New York as “affidavit ballots”) instead of regular ballots.   \n21.  The Oneida BOE subsequently rejected those approximately 68 provisional \nballots cast by DMV registrants on the ground that those registrants were “not registered.”   \n22.  The Oneida BOE rejected those 68 provisional ballots cast by DMV registrants \nwithout first reviewing the unprocessed registration records in its possession. \n23.  It is unknown how many additional qualified and eligible voters among the \napproximately 2,418 DMV registrants may have appeared to vote in the November 3, 2020, \ngeneral election, but left the polling place without completing an affidavit ballot after being \ninformed that they were not registered to vote. \n24.  Following the November 3, 2020 federal general election, Defendant Oneida BOE \nadministratively rejected approximately 1,797 provisional ballots cast in Oneida County without \nreviewing or otherwise canvassing them. \nPage 4 of 9 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-00793-MAD-ATB   Document 1   Filed 07/12/21   Page 5 of 9\n25.  At least 700 of those 1,797 rejected provisional ballots were cast by voters listed \nin NYSVoter as being duly registered and entitled to vote under state law.   \n26.  In the state court proceeding, the court ordered the Oneida BOE to review its \nrecords and recanvass all affidavit ballots submitted in the November 3, 2020, federal general \nelection to ensure that every validly cast vote was counted.  Tenney v. Oswego Cty. Bd. of \nElections, No. EFC-2020-1376, 2021 WL 234253, at *8 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Jan. 20, 2021).  But for \nthe state court’s efforts, hundreds of affidavit ballots submitted by qualified and eligible voters in \nNew York’s 22nd congressional district would have gone uncanvassed and uncounted in the \nNovember 3, 2020 federal general election.   \nApplicable Federal Law: The NVRA  \n27.  Congress enacted the NVRA to “(1) to establish procedures that will increase the \nnumber of citizens who register to vote in elections for Federal office; (2) to … enhance[] the \nparticipation of eligible citizens as voters in elections for Federal office; (3) to protect the \nintegrity of the electoral process; and (4) to ensure that accurate and current voter registration \nrolls are maintained.”  52 U.S.C. § 20501(b).  \n28.  Section 5 of the NVRA requires states such as New York to offer and accept voter \nregistration applications in connection with certain driver’s license and identity card transactions \nthrough motor vehicle offices such as the New York DMV.  Id. § 20503; see N.Y. Elec. Law § 5-\n210. \n29.  Section 8(a)(1) of the NVRA mandates that all eligible applicants must be \nregistered to vote in time for an upcoming federal election if their valid voter registration \napplications are postmarked, submitted to an authorized voter registration agency (such as a \nDMV office), or otherwise received by an appropriate election official 30 days (or such lesser \nPage 5 of 9 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-00793-MAD-ATB   Document 1   Filed 07/12/21   Page 6 of 9\nperiod allowed by state law) before the election.  52 U.S.C. § 20507(a)(1); see N.Y. Elec. Law \n§ 5-201(3) (establishing that voter registration deadline is 25 days before the ensuing election). \n30.  In New York, therefore, the NVRA required that all eligible citizens submitting \nvalid voter registration forms through DMV offices as of October 9, 2020—the 25th day before \nthe November 3, 2020 federal general election—must be added to the official list of registered \nvoters entitled to vote in that election.  \n31.  Section 8(a)(2) of the NVRA requires states to notify all applicants of the \ndisposition of their voter registration application.  52 U.S.C. § 20507(a)(2). \nApplicable Federal Law: HAVA \n32.  Congress enacted HAVA in part to establish certain administration requirements \nrelating to federal elections.  As relevant here, Section 302 of HAVA requires states to adhere to \ncertain requirements related to provisional voting.  \n33.  In particular, if an individual declares that she is a registered voter in the \njurisdiction and eligible to vote in an election for federal office, but the individual does not \nappear on the official list of eligible voters for that polling place, or an election official asserts \nthe individual is not eligible to vote, a polling official must inform the individual that she may \ncast a provisional ballot and must permit the individual to cast a provisional ballot after the \nindividual affirms in writing that she is eligible and registered to vote in the jurisdiction.  52 \nU.S.C. § 21082(a)(1)–(2).   \n34.  The polling official “shall” then transmit the provisional ballot and affirmation to \nan appropriate election official for “prompt verification,” and if that official determines that the \nindividual is eligible under state law to vote, the provisional ballot “shall” be counted in that \nelection in accordance with state law.  Id. § 21082(a)(3)–(4).  \nPage 6 of 9 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-00793-MAD-ATB   Document 1   Filed 07/12/21   Page 7 of 9\nCOUNT I: \nSECTION 8 OF THE NATIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION ACT, 52 U.S.C. § 20507 \nFailure to Process Timely Submitted Voter Registration Applications \n35.  The Oneida BOE’s failure to process or otherwise review all timely-filed voter \nregistration applications, and the subsequent failure to add the names of all eligible applicants to \nthe list of eligible voters for the November 3, 2020 federal general election, violates Section \n8(a)(1) of the NVRA, 52 U.S.C. § 20507(a)(1).   \n36.  The Oneida BOE’s failure to ensure that all persons submitting voter registration \napplications in Oneida County received timely notice of the disposition of their applications \nviolates Section 8(a)(2) of the NVRA, 52 U.S.C. § 20507(a)(2).  \n37.  The United States is entitled to declaratory, injunctive, and other appropriate \nrelief to remedy those violations and ensure the Oneida BOE’s future compliance with the \nNVRA.   \nCOUNT II: \nFAILURE TO VERIFY AND COUNT \nPROVISIONAL BALLOTS PURSUANT TO HAVA \n38.  The Oneida BOE’s failure to a) promptly verify approximately 1,797 provisional \nballots cast in the November 3, 2020, federal general election, and b) count those votes \ndetermined to be cast by duly registered voters, violated Section 302(a) of HAVA.  \n39.  The United States is entitled to declaratory, injunctive, and other appropriate \nrelief to remedy those violations and ensure the Oneida BOE’s future compliance with HAVA.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the United States prays that the Court enter an ORDER:  \n(1)  Declaring that Defendant has violated Section 8 of the NVRA; \nPage 7 of 9 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-00793-MAD-ATB   Document 1   Filed 07/12/21   Page 8 of 9\n(2)  Declaring that Defendant has violated Section 302 of HAVA;  \n(3)  Permanently enjoining Defendant, its agents and successors in office, and \nall persons acting in concert with it, from failing to a) process voter registration applications \ntimely submitted prior to the close of registration, b) include all eligible and qualified registrants \nin appropriate voter registration databases prior to any primary, general, or special election for \nfederal office, and c) notify all voter registration applicants as to the disposition of their voter \nregistration applications in advance of the applicable primary, general, or special election for \nfederal office; \n(4)  Permanently enjoining Defendant to verify promptly all provisional ballots \nsubmitted in connection with any primary, general, or special election for federal office and to \ncount all such ballots submitted by qualified and eligible voters.   \n(5)  Directing Defendant, in consultation with counsel for the United States, \nwithin 90 days of the entry of the Court’s order, to submit a final remedial plan, to ensure future \ncompliance with Section 8(a) of the NVRA and Section 303(a) of HAVA; and  \n(6)  Providing any such additional relief as the interests of justice may require, \ntogether with the costs and disbursement in maintaining this action.  \nPage 8 of 9 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-00793-MAD-ATB   Document 1   Filed 07/12/21   Page 9 of 9\nDated: July 12, 2021.   \n     \n  Respectfully submitted, \n       \nANTOINETTE T.
