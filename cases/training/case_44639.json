Case No. 21-4089-EFM-ADM \n     \nUNIFIED GOVERNMENT OF WYANDOTTE \nCOUNTY, KANSAS,  et al.,  \n     \n  Defendants. \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION \nThis  lawsuit  arises  out  of  pro  se  plaintiff  Celisha  Towersโ  (โTowersโ)  unsuccessful \ncandidacy for Wyandotte County Sheriff.  The named defendants include the Unified Government \nof Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas (the โUnified Governmentโ); Wyandotte County \nElection Commissioner Michael Abbott; and a number of individuals, including the current \nWyandotte County Sheriff Daniel Soptic, previous Wyandotte County Sheriff Don Ash, Kansas \nSecretary of State Scott Schwab, members of the Wyandotte County Board of Canvassers, and \nindividuals who appear to be Wyandotte County employees or officials.1  (ECF 11-1.)  The court \npreviously granted Towers leave to proceed in forma pauperis (โIFPโ).  (ECF 8.)  As discussed in \nfurther detail below, the court now recommends that the district judge dismiss plaintiffโs amended \ncomplaint without prejudice.  \nI.  THE  COURT  RECOMMENDS  THAT  THE  DISTRICT  JUDGE  DISMISS \nTOWERSโ CLAIMS WITHOUT PREJUDICE. \nWhen a plaintiff proceeds IFP, the court may screen the complaint under 28 U.S.C. ยง \n1915(e)(2)(B).  The court may dismiss the complaint if it determines that the action โ(i) is frivolous \n \n1 Towers names the individual defendants in their individual and official capacities.   \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM   Document 12   Filed 03/09/22   Page 2 of 15\nor malicious; (ii) fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted; or (iii) seeks monetary relief \nagainst a defendant who is immune from such relief.โ  28 U.S.C. ยง 1915(e)(2)(B).  The purpose of \nยง 1915(e)(2) is to โdiscourage the filing of, and waste of judicial and private resources upon, \nbaseless lawsuits that paying litigants generally do not initiate.โ  Buchheit v. Green, 705 F.3d 1157, \n1161 (10th Cir. 2012). \nIn addition, โ[i]f the court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, \nthe court must dismiss the action.โ  FED. R. CIV. P. 12(h)(3).  โ[F]ederal courts are courts of limited \nsubject-matter jurisdiction,โ and they โmay only hear cases when empowered to do so by the \nConstitution and by act of Congress.โ  Gad v. Kan. State Univ., 787 F.3d 1032, 1035 (10th Cir. \n2015) (quotation omitted).  The power to hear a case โcan never be forfeited or waived,โ and \ntherefore the court always has an independent obligation to determine whether subject-matter \njurisdiction exists.  Id. (quotation omitted); see also Basso v. Utah Power & Light Co., 495 F.2d \n906, 909 (10th Cir. 1974) (โIf the parties do not raise the question of lack of jurisdiction, it is the \nduty of the federal court to determine the matter sua sponte.โ). \nA.  Legal Standard  \nDismissal under ยง 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is governed by the same standard that applies to \nmotions to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  Kay v. Bemis, 500 F.3d \n1214, 1217 (10th Cir. 2007).  To withstand dismissal, โa complaint must contain sufficient factual \nmatter, accepted as true, to โstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.โโ  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  โA \nclaim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw \nthe reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.โ  Id.  โThreadbare \nrecitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements,โ are not \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM   Document 12   Filed 03/09/22   Page 3 of 15\nsufficient to state a claim for relief.  Id.  Dismissal of a pro se plaintiffโs complaint for failure to \nstate a claim is โproper only where it is obvious that the plaintiff cannot prevail on the facts . . . \nalleged and it would be futile to give [plaintiff] an opportunity to amend.โ  Curley v. Perry, 246 \nF.3d 1278, 1281 (10th Cir. 2001).  The court must โaccept the facts alleged in the complaint as \ntrue and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.โ  Mayfield v. Bethards, 826 F.3d \n1252, 1255 (10th Cir. 2016). \nSimilarly,  to  determine  whether  a  plaintiff  has  adequately  alleged  subject-matter \njurisdiction, the court looks to the face of the complaint.  Penteco Corp. v. Union Gas Sys., Inc., \n929 F.2d 1519, 1521 (10th Cir. 1991).  The court accepts โthe well-pleaded factual allegations as \ntrue, . . . but ignor[es] conclusory allegations of jurisdiction.โ  Kucera v. CIA, 347 F. Supp. 3d 653, \n659 (D.N.M. 2018) (citing United States v. Rodriguez-Aguirre, 264 F.3d 1195, 1203 (10th Cir. \n2001), and Groundhog v. Keeler, 442 F.2d 674, 677 (10th Cir. 1971)), affโd, 754 F. Appโx 735 \n(10th Cir. 2018).  โThe party seeking the exercise of jurisdiction in his favor โmust allege in his \npleading the facts essential to show jurisdiction.โโ  Penteco, 929 F.2d at 1521 (quoting McNutt v. \nGen. Motors Acceptance Corp., 298 U.S. 178, 189 (1936)). \nBecause Towers is proceeding pro se, the court construes her pleadings liberally and holds \nthem โto a less stringent standard than those drafted by attorneys.โ  Johnson v. Johnson, 466 F.3d \n1213, 1214 (10th Cir. 2006).  In doing so, the court does not โassume the role of advocate for the \npro se litigant.โ  Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir. 1991).  The plaintiff still bears \nโthe burden of alleging sufficient facts on which a recognized legal claim could be based.โ  Id.      \nB.  Analysis \nTowers ran for Wyandotte County Sheriff in 2021.  Her amended complaint alleges that \nshe โreceived the majority of the votes in the Sheriff race over Caucasian male candidate Daniel \nSopticโ during the general election held on November 2, 2021.  (ECF 11-1, at 6.)  Towers contends \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM   Document 12   Filed 03/09/22   Page 4 of 15\nthat Wyandotte County Election Commissioner Michael Abbott, acting under color of state law, \nโillegally rejected valid eligible ballotsโ that were cast by African-American and women voters in \nfavor of her and two other candidates, African Americans Melvin Williams and Gwendolyn Bass.  \n(Id. at 6-7.)  Towers states that Abbott โpurposely report[ed] fraudulent numbersโ that prevented \nher and the other candidates from obtaining their elected seats over Caucasian opponents, and that \nAbbott, the Wyandotte County Board of Canvassers, the County Administrator, election workers, \nthe Kansas Secretary of State, and Wyandotte County attorneys โrefused to issue Certificate of \nElections to African American Candidates who received the majority of the votes.โ  (Id. at 6.) \nTowers alleges that Abbott and his staff, employed by the Unified Government, violated \nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  She also brings claims under 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1983 in which she contends that Abbott and his staff deprived women voters of rights \nunder the Nineteenth Amendment and deprived her and other African-American candidates of \nrights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  She asks the court to \norder an inspection of the voting machines, a manual ballot recount, and an update of voting \nrecords on turnout and ballots cast.  She further asks the court to revoke the certificate establishing \nthe validity of the election results in favor of Sheriff Soptic and any other candidate who did not \nwin a majority of votes.  In the alternative, she asks the court to order a run-off election supervised \nby the Department of Justice.  Towers also seeks sheriff salary back pay from December 13, 2021, \nat least $25,000,000 in punitive damages, and attorneysโ fees.  \nIn November 2021, before filing this lawsuit, Towers initiated an action in Wyandotte \nCounty District Courtโ Towers v. Soptic et al.โto contest her loss in the general election pursuant \nto KAN. STAT. ANN. ยง 25-1434, et seq.2  On December 1, Towers attempted to remove the case to \n \n2 See ECF 1-1 in Case No. 21-2564-HLT-TJJ. \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM   Document 12   Filed 03/09/22   Page 5 of 15\nfederal court,3 but the presiding district judge remanded that case the following day because a \nplaintiff is not allowed to remove a case to federal court.4  Towers then filed the current lawsuit \napproximately one week later.  (ECF 1.)  \n1.  Towersโ claims on her own behalf are subject to dismissal. \nThe court first addresses the claims that it appears Towers is bringing on her own behalf.     \na.  Voting Rights Act  \nA litigant must have standing to bring claims in federal court.  See Kowalski v. Tesmer, \n543 U.S. 125, 128 (2004) (โThe doctrine of standing asks whether a litigant is entitled to have a \nfederal court resolve [her] grievance.โ).  The inquiry into standing โinvolves โboth constitutional \nlimitations on federal-court jurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise.โโ  Id. (quoting \nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975)).  To establish standing under Article III of the \nConstitution, a plaintiff must show that she โ(1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable \nto the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable \njudicial decision.โ  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016) (citing Lujan v. Defs. of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992)), as revised (May 24, 2016).     \nTowers does not have constitutional standing to bring a Voting Rights Act claim.  Under \nthe Voting Rights Act, โ[n]o person acting under color of law shall fail or refuse to permit any \nperson to vote who is entitled to vote . . . or is otherwise qualified to vote, or willfully fail or refuse \nto tabulate, count, and report such personโs vote.โ  52 U.S.C. ยง 10307(a).  The Attorney General \nor an โaggrieved personโ may institute a proceeding to enforce voting rights.  See 52 U.S.C. ยง \n10302; Roberts v. Wamser, 883 F.2d 617, 621 (8th Cir. 1989) (โCongress amended the Voting \nRights Act in 1975 to reflect the standing of โaggrieved personsโ to enforce their right to vote.โ).  \n \n3 See ECF 1 in Case No. 21-2564-HLT-TJJ.  \n4 See ECF 3 in Case No. 21-2564-HLT-TJJ. \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM   Document 12   Filed 03/09/22   Page 6 of 15\nโ[A]n unsuccessful candidate attempting to challenge election results does not have standing under \nthe Voting Rights Actโ because the asserted injury is not the denial of voting rights.  Roberts, 883 \nF.2d at 621.  โThe purpose of the Voting Rights Act is to protect minority voters, not to give \nunsuccessful candidates for state or local office a federal forum in which to challenge elections.โ  \nId. \nHere, Towers is an unsuccessful candidate seeking to challenge the November 2021 \nWyandotte County election results.  She contends that Abbott โdenied and rejected over 15,000 \nvalid and eligible valid casts by the majority of African American voters in Wyandotte Countyโ \n(ECF 11-1, at 8), but she does not allege that Abbott or any other defendant refused to tabulate, \ncount, or report her own vote.  Because it does not appear from the face of the complaint that \nTowers is an โaggrieved personโ under the Voting Rights Act, she lacks standing and fails to state \na claim under that statute.  See Roberts, 883 F.2d at 621; see also White-Battle v. Democratic Party \nof Va., 323 F. Supp. 2d 696, 702 (E.D. Va. 2004) (โIt is well-settled that unsuccessful candidates \nlack standing to sue under the Voting Rights Act of 1965.โ), affโd 134 F. Appโx 641 (4th Cir. \n2005); McGee v. City of Warrensville Heights, 16 F. Supp. 2d 837, 845 (N.D. Ohio 1998) (โAn \nunsuccessful candidate attempting to challenge election results does not have standing to sue under \nthe Voting Rights Act.โ); Oh v. Philadelphia Cty. Bd. Of Elections, No. CIV.A.08-0081, 2008 WL \n4787583, at *7 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 31, 2008) (dismissing unsuccessful candidateโs Voting Rights Act \nlawsuit for lack of standing). \nb.  Civil Rights Act \nTowers appears to be bringing a Civil Rights Act claim under Title I, which relates to \nvoting.  (See ECF 11-1, at 6 (stating federal question jurisdiction is founded on, inter alia, \nโViolation of The Civil Rights Act of 1964โ and โViolation of Civil Rights: Votingโ).)  Title I \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM   Document 12   Filed 03/09/22   Page 7 of 15\nprovides that United States citizens โwho are otherwise qualified by law to vote at any election . . \n. shall be entitled and allowed to vote at all such elections, without distinction of race, color, or \nprevious condition of servitude.โ  52 U.S.C. ยง 10101(a)(1).  The statute specifically prohibits \npersons acting under color of state law from (1) applying โany standard, practice, or procedure \ndifferent from the standards, practices, or procedures applied . . . to other individuals within the \nsame countyโ in determining whether an individual is a qualified voter; (2) denying an individual \nthe right to vote because of an immaterial โerror or omission on any record or paper relating to any \napplication, registration, or other act requisite to votingโ; and (3) generally requiring literacy tests \nas a qualification for voting.  Id. ยง 10101(a)(2).  The Tenth Circuit has not decided whether a \nprivate right of action exists to enforce Title I.  See Reyes v. Oliver, 345 F. Appโx 329, 331 n.4 \n(10th Cir. 2009) (discussing 42 U.S.C. ยง 1971, where Title 1 was previously codified, and \ndeclining to reach the question); see also Good v. Roy, 459 F. Supp. 403, 406 (D. Kan. 1978) \n(โ[W]e believe that the unambiguous language of Section 1971 will not permit us to imply a private \nright of action.โ). \nBut even if the court were to assume that a private right of action exists, Towers fails to \nstate any claim for relief under ยง 10101.  She does not allege that she is a qualified voter who was \nprevented from voting in the November 2021 election on account of her race.  She also does not \nallege that she was subjected to different standards than others or required to take a literacy test to \nbecome a qualified voter, or that she was denied the right to vote because of an immaterial \npaperwork error or omission.  Thus, this claim should also be dismissed.  See Reyes, 345 F. Appโx \nat 331 (affirming dismissal of complaint where the pro se plaintiff did not allege that he was a \nqualified voter or that the defendant acted based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude). \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM   Document 12   Filed 03/09/22   Page 8 of 15\nThe court notes also that individuals generally cannot be held personally liable under the \nCivil Rights Act.  See, e.g., Haynes v. Williams, 88 F.3d 898, 901 (10th Cir. 1996) (finding personal \ncapacity lawsuits against individuals under Title VII inappropriate); Silva v. St. Anne Cath. Sch., \n595 F. Supp. 2d 1171, 1179 (D. Kan. 2009) (โThe law is clear that individuals are not subject to \nliability under Title VI in their individual capacities.โ).  So, to the extent that Towers seeks to hold \nindividual defendants personally liable for alleged violations of Title I, her claims should also be \ndismissed on this basis.  See, e.g., Greene v. Sampson, No. 18-CV-06103 (PMH), 2021 WL \n355477, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 2, 2021) (noting that it was unclear which Title the plaintiff intended \nto  proceed  under  but  dismissing  claims  against  individuals  because  โindividual  liability  is \ngenerally precluded under the Civil Rights Actโ). \nc.  Nineteenth Amendment \nThe Nineteenth Amendment states that โ[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote \nshall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.โ  U.S. \nCONST. amend. XIX.  To state a ยง 1983 claim for deprivation of rights under this amendment, โa \nplaintiff must allege that his or her right to vote has been abridged on the basis of sexโ by a person \nacting under color of state law.  Seale v. Madison Cty., 929 F. Supp. 2d 51, 71 (N.D.N.Y. 2013); \nsee also 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  For the same reasons as discussed above, Towers fails to state a \nNineteenth Amendment claim.  Although Towers contends that Abbott refused to count votes cast \nby unnamed Wyandotte County women, she does not allege that her own vote was not counted, or \nthat her voting rights were otherwise abridged on account of her sex.  So this claim should also be \ndismissed. \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM   Document 12   Filed 03/09/22   Page 9 of 15\nd.  Fourteenth Amendment \nThe Fourteenth Amendment guarantees that โ[n]o State shall . . . deny to any person within \nits jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.โ  U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, ยง 1.  The Equal \nProtection Clause โis essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated \nalike.โ  Requena v. Roberts, 893 F.3d 1195, 1210 (10th Cir. 2018) (quoting City of Cleburne v. \nCleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985)).  To state a ยง 1983 equal protection claim, a \nplaintiff must allege that the state actor defendant treated her differently than similarly situated \nindividuals, i.e. individuals who โare alike โin all relevant respects.โโ  Id. (quoting Coal. for Equal \nRights, Inc. v. Ritter, 517 F.3d 1195, 1199 (10th Cir. 2008).  โMoreover, to state a race-based equal \nprotection claim, โ[a] plaintiff must sufficiently allege that defendants were motivated by racial \nanimus.โโ  Id. (quoting Phelps v. Wichita EagleโBeacon, 886 F.2d 1262, 1269 (10th Cir. 1989)). \nHere, Towers alleges that Abbott, acting under color of state law, purposely rejected ballots \ncast by African-American voters for Towers and other African-American candidates.  She further \nalleges that Abbottโs actions denied โAfrican American Candidates the right to be elected to office \nfor the elected position in which they rightfully obtained the majority of the votes cast over \nCaucasian candidates.โ  (ECF 11-1, at 7.)  But Towers does not allege any facts to support what is \nessentially conclusory allegations to the effect that Abbott acted out of racial animus.  Towers has \ntherefore failed to state an equal protection claim against Abbott.  \nTowers also does not state a claim against any of the other defendants.  In addition to \nAbbott, Towersโ amended complaint names as defendants Sheriff Soptic, eight Wyandotte County \nCommissioners, one Assistant County Commissioner, five individuals who appear to be employed \nby the County in election-related capacities, another individual employed by the County in an \nunspecified capacity, three County attorneys, now-retired Sheriff Ash, and Secretary of State \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM   Document 12   Filed 03/09/22   Page 10 of 15\nSchwab.  But Towers does not make any specific allegations as to any individual defendant, save \nAbbott.  โIndividual liability under ยง 1983 must be based on personal involvement in the alleged \nconstitutional violation.โ  Wilson v. Montano, 715 F.3d 847, 854 (10th Cir. 2013).  Because Towers \ndoes not specify what actions any of these individuals took that allegedly deprived her of equal \nprotection, her claims against them should be dismissed.   \nTowers also names the Unified Government as a defendant.  A municipality can be liable \nunder ยง 1983 only when the entityโs โpolicy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those \nwhose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the [constitutional] \ninjury.โ  Monell v. Depโt of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978).  โA plaintiff suing a municipality \nunder Section 1983 for the acts of one of its employees must prove: (1) that a municipal employee \ncommitted a constitutional violation; and (2) that a municipal policy or custom was the moving \nforce behind the constitutional deprivation.โ  Cavanaugh v. Woods Cross City, 625 F.3d 661, 667 \n(10th Cir. 2010).  A municipal policy or custom may be  \n(1) a formal regulation or policy statement; (2) an informal custom \namoun[ting] to a widespread practice that, although not authorized \nby written law or express municipal policy, is so permanent and well \nsettled as to constitute a custom or usage with the force of law; (3) \nthe decisions of employees with final policymaking authority; (4) \nthe ratification by such final policymakers of the decisionsโand the \nbasis for themโof subordinates to whom authority was delegated \nsubject to these policymakersโ review and approval; or (5) the \nfailure to adequately train or supervise employees, so long as that \nfailure results from deliberate indifference to the injuries that may \nbe caused.   \nBryson v. City of Okla. City, 627 F.3d 784, 788 (10th Cir. 2010) (alteration in original) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). \nTowers does not allege a failure to train, or the existence of any formal policy or informal \ncustom.  Nor does she allege that Abbott was a final policymaker or that his actions were ratified \nby a final policymaker.  But even if Towers had alleged these latter two scenarios, โ[a] municipality \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM   Document 12   Filed 03/09/22   Page 11 of 15\nmay not be held liable where there was no underlying constitutional violation by any of its \nofficers.โ  Hinton v. City of Elwood, Kan., 997 F.2d 774, 782 (10th Cir. 1993).  And, as discussed \nabove, Towers has not sufficiently alleged an equal protection claim against Abbott.  Thus, any \nclaim against the Unified Government should also be dismissed. \n2.  Towersโ claims on behalf of third-party voters \nThe court next addresses the claims Towers appears to be bringing on behalf of 15,000 \nAfrican-American and women voters in Wyandotte County.   \na.  Towers lacks standing to bring claims on behalf of third-party \nvoters. \nAs discussed above, a litigant must have standing to bring claims in federal court.  See \nKowalski, 543 U.S. at 128 (โThe doctrine of standing asks whether a litigant is entitled to have a \nfederal court resolve [her] grievance.โ).  The standing inquiry โinvolves โboth constitutional \nlimitations on federal-court jurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise.โโ  Id. (quoting \nWarth, 422 U.S. at 498).  Prudential standing is concerned with โthe properโand properly \nlimitedโrole of the courts in a democratic society.โ  Hill v. Warsewa, 947 F.3d 1305, 1309 (10th \nCir. 2020) (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 162 (1997)).  The court may proceed to analyze \nprudential standing โwithout [first] addressing other jurisdictional issues,โ such as constitutional \nstanding.  Id. at 1308. \nHere, Towers alleges that Abbott and his staff refused to count the ballots of 15,000 \nWyandotte County voters and, in doing so, interfered with their constitutional and statutory rights.  \nBut the prudential standing doctrine requires that a โplaintiff generally must assert [her] own legal \nrights and interests, and cannot rest [her] claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third \nparties.โ  The Wilderness Soc. v. Kane Cty., Utah, 632 F.3d 1162, 1168 (10th Cir. 2011) (quoting \nWarth, 422 U.S. at 499).  As discussed in further detail above, although Towers alleges that \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM   Document 12   Filed 03/09/22   Page 12 of 15\nAbbottโs actions prevented her from winning the November 2021 election, she does not allege that \nher own voting-related rights were violatedโonly those of third parties.     \nThird-party standing, an exception to the general rule, is allowed in some cases.  A plaintiff \nwho has satisfied the requirements of constitutional standing may assert the rights of others where \n(1) the plaintiff has a close relationship with the person possessing the right, and (2) the person \npossessing the right is hindered in the ability to protect it.  Kowalski, 543 U.S. at 128-30; Aid for \nWomen v. Foulston, 441 F.3d 1101, 1112 (10th Cir. 2006).  Even if the court were to assume that \nTowers  has  constitutional  standing,  her  amended  complaint  does  not  contain  any  factual \nallegations from which the court could infer that she somehow has a special relationship with the \nreferenced unnamed 15,000 Wyandotte County voters.  Further, plaintiff has not alleged any facts \nfrom which it could be inferred that the unnamed voters were unable to assert their own rights.  \nThus, Towers has not established that she has standing to bring claims on behalf of the 15,000 \nWyandotte County voters whose ballots Abbott allegedly rejected.  See, e.g., Somers v. S.C. State \nElection Commโn, 871 F. Supp. 2d 490, 498 (D.S.C. 2012) (determining that a candidate lacked \nstanding to bring claims on behalf of overseas voters, where the candidate did not allege any close \nrelationship with the voters or show they were unable to assert their own rights); see also Stiles v. \nBlunt, 912 F.2d 260, 265 (8th Cir. 1990) (โ[W]e are unpersuaded that [the candidate] appellant has \nstanding to raise the votersโ claims.โ); cf. Fleming v. Gutierrez, No. 13-CV-222 WJ/RHS, 2014 \nWL 11398558, at *4 (D.N.M. Oct. 7, 2014) (determining candidates had standing as both \ncandidates and voters, where the complaint alleged the candidates were registered voters in the \njurisdiction).   \nb.  Towers fails to state a claim as to most of named defendants.  \nEven if Towers could properly assert claims on behalf of the 15,000 Wyandotte County \nvoters, she has failed to state any claim against the vast majority of the named defendants.  Under \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM   Document 12   Filed 03/09/22   Page 13 of 15\nRule 8(a), a complaint must contain โ(1) a short and plain statement of the grounds for the courtโs \njurisdiction . . . ; (2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to \nrelief; and (3) a demand for the relief sought.โ  These pleading standards are designed to give a \nโdefendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.โ  Erickson v. \nPardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007) (alteration in original) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, \n550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)).  To comply with Rule 8(a), a plaintiffโs complaint โmust explain what \neach defendant did to him or her; when the defendant did it; how the defendantโs action harmed \nhim or her; and, what specific legal right the plaintiff believes the defendant violated.โ  Nasious v. \nTwo Unknown B.I.C.E. Agents, 492 F.3d 1158, 1163 (10th Cir. 2007).   \nAs mentioned above, Towers does not make any specific allegations as to any individual \ndefendant except Abbott.5  It is therefore unclear what actions Towers believes each defendant has \ntaken, when those actions occurred, how those actions harmed her or the unnamed voters, and what \nparticular rights Towers believes each defendant violated.  Other than Abbott, the individual \ndefendants do not have fair notice of the specific claims that Towers asserts against them on behalf \nof the unnamed voters.  Because Towers has not met Rule 8(a)โs requirements and clearly fails to \nstate any claim whatsoever against Sheriff Soptic, the County Commissioners and Assistant \n \n5 Towersโ Nineteenth Amendment claim also accuses Secretary Schwab, named in his official \nand individual capacity, of refusing to count women votersโ ballots.  (ECF 11-1, at 7.)  But it is \nnot clear how the Kansas Secretary of State would be involved in counting Wyandotte County \ngeneral election ballots.  Further, Secretary Schwab is likely entitled to sovereign and/or qualified \nimmunity.  See, e.g., Clark v. Schwab, 416 F. Supp. 3d 1260, 1277 (D. Kan. 2019) (finding \nSecretary Schwab was entitled to sovereign immunity in an official capacity lawsuit challenging \nKansas electioneering statutes).  \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM   Document 12   Filed 03/09/22   Page 14 of 15\nCounty Commissioner, the six County employees and three County attorneys, former Sheriff Ash, \nand Secretary Schwab, these defendants should be dismissed.6  \n3.  It is unclear whether this court should exercise jurisdiction here, given \nthe concurrent state proceeding.  \nTowers has initiated an election contest under state law.7  Principles of equity, comity, and \nfederalism underlie a โlongstanding public policy against federal court interference with state court \nproceedings.โ  Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 43-45 (1971).  This policy requires a federal court \nto abstain from hearing a case when failing to do so would disturb an ongoing state proceeding.  \nSee id. at 45; see also Stein v. Cortes, 223 F. Supp. 3d 423, 435 (E.D. Pa. 2016).  Some courts have \nfound abstention under Younger or other doctrines appropriate where an unsuccessful candidate \ninstitutes a ยง 1983 action in federal court challenging election results after initiating an election \ncontest in state court.  See, e.g., Stein, 223 F. Supp. 3d at 434-36 (abstaining under Younger and \nRooker-Feldman, where unsuccessful candidate alleged equal protection, substantive due process, \nand First Amendment violations in federal court in connection with the 2016 presidential election, \nafter filing in state court to contest the election under state law).  The record in this case is not fully \ndeveloped on this point, so the court cannot at this time conclude whether abstention is appropriate.  \nHowever, this may be an additional impediment if Towers chooses to file a new federal lawsuit.                     \nII.

Plaintiff objects to \nthe Biased Judge report and recommendation that has no proper legal precedent in support for \ngrounds of dismissal which is why she is trying to get a dismissal without prejudice, and Plaintiff \ntherefore asks the Court to deny the report and recommendation and deny any dismissals of \nclaims and remove the Judge from the case and provide time for Plaintiff to  Amend Complaint. \nThe Magistrate Judge screening for Merit is an attempt used as a tool to obstruct due process is \nthe major issue when she failed to follow stare decisis, and clearly state to the Pro Se plaintiff \nthat she is afforded an opportunity to Amend Complaint with a deadline added. Instead, the \nJudge concluded in a vague response in attempt to advocate for Defendants in a biased manner \nattempting as a last resort to get a dismissal on all claims with an outdated precedent that is in \nfavor of the Plaintiff to proceed by filing an Amended Complaint with initial Summons to follow \ntimely. \nPLAINTIFF OBJECTS TO MAGISTRATE DISTRICT COURT JUDGE ATTEMPT TO \nDISMISS PLAINTIFF CLAIMS. JUDGE IS OBLIGATED TO GIVE PLAINTIFF TIME \nTO AMEND COMPLAINT IF SUCH ERROR DOES EXIST FOR PRO SE PLAINTIFF \nDUE TO ESTABLISHED SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION AND STARE DECISIS. \nPro Se Plaintiff is proceeding to have IFP status removed in motion and affidavit, with \nNotice oflmprovement of Financial Situation, and a copy of money order and/or copy of payment \nready to be filed or filed at time objection is submitted. The Judge states that when a Plaintiff \n31 \na  C \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM     Document 14     Filed 03/22/22     Page 4 of 14\nproceeds in IFP status, the court may screen the complaint under 28 U.S. C. ยง 1915 (e) (2)(B). The \nJudge also states that the Court may dismiss the complaint if it determines that the action \"(i) is \nfrivolous or malicious; (ii) fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted; or (iii) seeks \nmonetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief.\" 28 U.S.C. ยง 1915 (e)(2)(B). It \nis further stated that the purpose ofยง 1915 (e)(2) is to \"discourage the filing of, and waste ofj udicial \nand private resources upon, baseless lawsuit that paying litigants generally do not initiate.\" Buchheit \nv. Green, 705 F. 3d 1157, 1161 (10th Cir. 2012). The law in this Circuit is clear that \"[o]rdinarily, a \nparty must be given ... opportunity to amend before the district comi dismisses the complaint.\" \nCorsello v. Lincare, Inc., 428 F.3d 1008, 1014 (11th Cir. 2005). In addition, Federal Civil Procedure \n15 (a) AMENDMENTS BEFORE TRIAL.(l)Amending as a Matter ofC  ourse. A party may amend \nits pleading ...( B) if the pleading is one to which a responsive pleading is required ... \nHere, Plaintiff is familiar with the United States District Court for the District of Kansas \nproceeding as a Pro Se plaintiff in IFP status and has a history of being successful when she filed \nsuit in the past and settled her own case while in Law School against some of the same Defendants \nwhere injury was determined by U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for \nDiscrimination and Wrongful Termination with \"Right to Suit\" letter issued to Plaintiff. See,  Case \nNo. 17-2615-JAR-TJJ. It can be determined that the plaintiff history speaks for itself that not only \nhas she been injured by defendants but also in past election in which plaintiff decided not to pursue \nclaims of action due to one lawsuit already on file, and that the only time the plaintiff brings a claim \nfor relief is when she has been injured to the point of irreparability. The Plaintiff claims are not \nbaseless, malicious or frivolous and with certainty that presenting evidence before a Jury with \npossible Joinder of claims by Third Parties in the District Court; all claims made against defendants \nby Plaintiff and possible Third-Party Joinder claims involved will be found guilty. Plaintiff may or \n41 \nPa g \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM     Document 14     Filed 03/22/22     Page 5 of 14\nmay not remain Pro Se throughout her entire case. In addition, Plaintiff seeks to proceed removing \nthe IFP status due to a significant change in the Plaintiffs financial situation. As stated, paying \nlitigants do not bring baseless lawsuits and can proceed \"sua sponte.\" The Court may try to argue on \nwhether the Pro Se plaintiff acted in good faith when she submitted her motion and affidavit to \nproceed in IFP status. However, Plaintiff did act in good faith and will attach evidence and \ndocumentation to dissolve the possible argument in separate motion and affidavit mailed to be \nremoved from IFP status. A motion and Affidavit with more evidence will support Plaintiff \nrequesting to be removed from IFP status for further proceedings. Plaintiff also inserts that she will \nlike time to Amend any deficiencies that may be present in her Complaint. \nFurthermore, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1915 (e )(a) is being used by the bias Magistrate Judge in which \nshe is proceeding with the presumptions that being poor and lacking legal representation equals to a \nplaintiff not deserving due process. Due process is denied if a litigant is denied an opportunity to be \nheard in the comi of law. The bias Judge attempt to utilize the merit screening is being utilized as her \nopportunity to operate as a gatekeeper to known corruption in my case and third parties. The Judge \ncontinues to slander plaintiff and attempt to use a form of manipulation by attempting to deny the \nplaintiff the right to present evidence to a Jmy. The Judge writing and declaring merit screening but \nin the mist is asserting as an advocate for the defendants with outdated judicial authority with an \nattempt to appear compliant with stare decisis is a form of corruption and an abuse of power by the \nMagistrate Judge Angel Mitchell against the Pro Se Plaintiff. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12 (b )(6 ), all factual allegations of the plaintiff are to be believed, and the claims must \nnot be dismissed unless it appears that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts pursuant to her \nallegations which would entitle plaintiff to relief.  At no time have the Judge mentioned that she \nbelieves the plaintiff claims are frivolous or incapable of not being able to prove. In the Magistrate \nSI \nPage \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM     Document 14     Filed 03/22/22     Page 6 of 14\nJudge report and recommendation, at no time were the factual allegations believed by the plaintiff, \nand the Judge prematurely  in a oblivious way continued to conclude that the Plaintiff was \n\"unsuccessful\" in her efforts running for sheriff of Wyandotte County, in which an open Election \nContest is still on the table at the Supreme Court level in which the Bias Chief Judge Robert Bums \nviolated stare decisis, Due Process and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure several times operating as a \nGate Keeper for the Defendants on the State Court level with separate charges. The Judge utilizing \nfailure to state a claim defense without offering the plaintiff the opportunity to clearly Amend \nComplaint according to precedent shows that the Judge is incapable of being non-bias, and will \ncontinue to try and manipulate paperwork, timelines, and rights afforded to the Pro Se plaintiff. By \nno examination of any record have the Judge preserved a fair record or recommendation and \nattempts to help defendants avoid responsibility in the Federal crimes they have committed not only \nagainst the Plaintiff, but also towards thousands of tax paying citizens in Wyandotte County who \ndecided by ballot that Celisha Towers an African American woman was the most qualified, \neducated, experienced Candidate who they wanted to become their Sheriff of Wyandotte County. \nThe defendants careless decision to act criminally by overthrowing democracy by wrongfully \nallowing Daniel Soptic to be sworn in as Sheriff against taxpayers will has caused 4 deaths at the \nWyandotte County Jail due to negligence according to video evidence and I death in patrol during a \nwreck off of 90th and Parallel Pkwy in which the Deputy who was in a Hot Pursuit without her lights \nilluminated or sirens sounding killing an innocent civilian in a car crash according to video evidence \nwhich was all falsely report as no foul play. The same criminal behavior by the defendants in the \n2017 Election by illegally Certifying Don Ash as Sheriff when the plaintiff received the majority of \nthe vote caused two Deputies to be shot and killed with poor policies that still has not been updated. \nOver 40 Deputies have quit the job under Daniel Soptic due to a hostile work environment. Daniel \nIP \n6  g e \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM     Document 14     Filed 03/22/22     Page 7 of 14\nSoptics' illegal Certification of election by the Defendants has caused injury not only to the plaintiff \nbut also to third parties where a loss of several lives could have been preserved and exposes his \nfailure as a Sheriff in a short amount of time and puts innocents lives in continued imminent danger. \nTHE COURT HAS SUBJECT-MATTER JURISDICTION OVER PLAINTIFF CLAIMS. \nThe district court has original subject matter jurisdiction over actions involving \"federal questions,\" \nthose civil actions arising under the federal Constitution, federal law or treaties of the United States. \nSee 28 U.S.C. 1331. As the Judge quoted, \"federal courts are courts of limited subject matter \njurisdiction,\" and may only hear cases when empowered to do so by the Constitution and by the act \nof the Congress.\" Gad v. Kan. State Univ., 787 F .3d 1032, 1035 (10th Cir. 2015) (quotation \nomitted). The power to hear a case \"can never be forfeited or waived ..., \" Id ( quotation omitted); see \nalso Baso v. Utah Power & Light Co., 495 F .2d 906, 909 (10th Cir. 1974) (\"If the parties do not raise \nthe question of lack of jurisdiction, it is the duty of the federal court to determine the matter sua \nsponte.\"). \nHere, the plaintiff brought only federal claims to the United States District Court for the District \nof Kansas claiming that her and third parties Civil Rights (Voting Rights), 14th Amendment and \nNineteenth Amendment Rights, have been violated. The plaintiff claims raise federal question and \narise under the federal Constitution of the United States, and can never be denied. These claims are \nseparate claims from any case the plaintiff has on file, and can not be removed to the state court at \nany time by the defendants, because the plaintiff strategically insured that state claims weren't \npresent. The plaintiff does not lack jurisdiction, so it is the federal courts duty to allow the plaintiff \nfactual allegations be believed and proceed sua sponte with an opportunity to freely Amend \nComplaint according to Federal Rule Civil Procedure. \nPRO SE PLAINTIFF OBJECTS TO THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE LEGAL STANDARD \nUSED IN REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION AND OBJECTS TO DISMISSAL ON \n71Pagc \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM     Document 14     Filed 03/22/22     Page 8 of 14\nQUALIFIED IMMUNITY ON ALL DEFENDANTS. \nThe Magistrate Judge cited that Dismissal under ยง1915(e )(2)(B)(ii) is governed by the same \nstandard that applies to motions to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b )(6). Kay \nv. Bemis, 500 F .3d 1214, 1217 (10th Cir. 2007).\" \nHere the District court allowed Kay to amend complaint. Furthermore, plaintiff has \nmotion and affidavit to follow to be removed from IFP status due to improvement in financial status. \nIn addition, the plaintiff asks for time to Amend Complaint. [W]e must accept the allegations of the \ncomplaint as true and construe those allegations and any reasonable inferences that might be drawn \nfrom them, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\" Gaines, 292 F.3d at 1224. \"[w]e look for \nplausibility in th[e] complaint.\" Alvarado v. KOB-TV, L.L.C., No. 06-2001, 493 F.3d 1210, 1215 \n(10th Cir.2007). In particular, we \"look to the specific allegations in the complaint to determine \nwhether they plausibly support a legal claim for relief.\" Id. at 1215 n. 2. Rather than adjudging \nwhether a claim is \"improbable,\" \"[f]actual allegations [in a complaint] must be enough to raise a \nright to relief above the speculative level.\" Bell Atl. Corp., _U.S._, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 \nL.Ed.2d 929 (2007). \nThe Judge proceeds to cite to withstand a dismissal, \"a complaint must contain sufficient \nfactual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its ace.\"' Ashcroft v. \nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,570 (2007)). \nHere, the district court moved for dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12 \n(b)(6).However, when the court granted the motion, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Second Circuit \noverturned the dismissal. Further the lower Court denied dismissal due to Officials in this case were \nnot qualified for immunity at the time of official status in which the Judge is trying to argue for the \nDefendants on the plaintiffCelisha Towers case. This case is in favor of the plaintiff and a dismissal \n81 Pa g \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM     Document 14     Filed 03/22/22     Page 9 of 14\nis not the proper action to take, not are the Officials who committed crimes against the plaintiff are \nimmune from lawsuit in their official and individual capacity. The plaintiff inse1is again that she \nwould like time to Amend her Complaint. \nThe Judge continues to cite, . \"Threadbare recitals of elements of cause of action, \nsupp01ied by mere conclus01y statements,\" are not sufficient to state a claim for relief. Id \nDismissal of a pro se plaintiffs complaint for failure to state a claim is \"proper only where it is \nobvious that the plaintiff cannot prevail on the facts ...a lleged and it would be futile to give \n[plaintiffJ an opportunity to amend.\" Curley v. Perry, 246 F .3d 1252, 1255 (10th Circ. 2001). \nUnfortunately for the defendants, here the Magistrate Judge is the only one according to \ndocuments submitted attempting to create a cause of action by making conclusory statements \nthat will not prevail on trial which is why she is attempting to get a dismissal without prejudice \nadvocating for the defendants. Even putting the plaintiff through a merit screening, it is clear that \nthe plaintiff passed the screening and should receive an order to proceed and opportunity to \nfreely Amend complaint because a summons will timely follow. In addition, in Curley v Perry an \ninmate filed suit pro se in IFP status, and when the District Court dismissed the complaint for \nfailing to state a claim, the Tenth Circuit granted a Motion for leave to proceed in IFP status on \nConstitutionality, and the United States filed a motion to intervene to defend the \nConstitutionality of the Congressional Act on behalf of the pro se plaintiff. Therefore, the case \ncited is in favor of the plaintiff, and that a dismissal violates established precedent. Plaintiff \nobjects to any dismissal of any claims and requests leave to proceed and freely amend complaint \nuntil summons is timely served and defendants respond. \nFurthermore, Judge cites, [t]he court must \"accept the facts alleged in the complaint as \ntrue and view them in light most favorable to the plaintiff.\" Mayfield v. Bethards, 826 F .3d \n91 \np \nC'1   f0J  ,V , \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM     Document 14     Filed 03/22/22     Page 10 of 14\n1252, 1255 (10th Cir. 2016). \" ... to determine whether a plaintiff has adequately alleged subject \nmatter jurisdiction, the court looks to the face of the complaint. Penteco Corp. v.  Union Gas Sys., \nInc., 929 F .2d 1519, 1521 (10th Cir. 1991). \nIn Mayfield v. Bethards, he proceeded prose and claimed violations of his 4th \nAmendment rights and 14th Amendment Rights. The Deputy claimed qualified immunity defense \nand moved to dismiss for Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12 (b) (6) for failure to state a claim \nand the District Court denied the motion. For these reasons plaintiff objects to any defendant \nbeing dismissed from claims on the defense of qualified immunity. The Secretary of State and \nAttorney General and other Defendants named and to be named received a timely Administrative \nComplaint from the plaintiff on claims prior to the State Canvass taking place and all individuals \nwere negligent in investigating the falsified documents in which they signed off on. The plaintiff \nbrings claims against defendants in their official capacity and individual capacity, so the defense \nis irrelevant in this matter before the court.  In addition, in Penteco Corp. v. Union Gas Sys., Inc., \nthe court purported to find that the Plaintiff established Jurisdiction and proceeded. The plaintiff \ncontinues to assert she is asking for all dismissals to be denied, a change ofj udge and order to \nproceed, so plaintiff can freely amend her complaint until Summons is timely filed. \nPLAINTIFF CLAIMS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO DISMISSAL ACCORDING TO STA  RE \nDECISIS AND JUDGE HAS TO ALLOW FOR OPPORTUNITY TO AMEND. \nTo withstand dismissal, \" a complaint must contain sufficient factual material, accepted \nas true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 \nU.S. 544, 570 (2007)). Here, plaintiff has presented factual allegations, and are to be believed \nand considered true. If there is any deficiencies in the plaintiffs complaint an opportunity to \namend had to presented. Furthe1more, plaintiff has established subject-matter jurisdiction, went \nlOIPagc \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM     Document 14     Filed 03/22/22     Page 11 of 14\nthrough an IFP screening process, and the court has no grounds for dismissal . A claim is \nplausible on its face \"when the ple[d ] factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Id (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. \nat 556). \"The plausibility standard is not akin to a 'probability requirement,' but it asks for more \nthan a sheer possibility that a defendant acted unlawfully.\" Id. \nPLAINTIFF OBJECTS TO JUDGE CIVIL RIGHTS RECOMMENDATION \nWith respect to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 plaintiff clearly identifies Title I of the \nVoting Rights Act seeking relief.  The Judge cites, [t]itle provided that United States citizens \" \nwho are otherwise qualified by law to vote at any election ... shall be entitled and allowed to \nvote at all such elections, without distinction of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" \n52 U.S.C. ยง 10101(a)(l). The statute specifically prohibits persons acting under the color of state \nlaw from (1) applying \"any standard, practice, or procedure different from the standards, \npractices, or procedures applied ... to other individuals within the same county\" in determining \nwhether an individual is a qualified voter; (2) denying an individual the right to vote because  of \nimmaterial\" error or omission on any record ...\" ; ... /dยง1010l(a)(2). The magistrate Judge \ncites  Reyes v. Oliver, 345 F, App'x 329,331 n.4 (10th Cir. 2009) in discussing the unambiguous \nlanguage of private action and further states that a dismissal of complaint where a pro se plaintiff \ndid not allege that he was a qualified voter or that the defendant acted based on race, color, or \nprevious condition of servitude). Unfortunately for the Judge, she left of that she is using a \nconvicted felony case on whether the plaintiff was qualified to vote. Furthermore, the  Court \npermitted the pro se plaintiff opportunity to Amend his complaint to make additional allegations \nand when he failed to do so, action was dismissed.  Therefore, the Judge still has no grounds for \ndismissal, and an order to proceed where the plaintiff is free to Amend her complaint should be \nlllPc1gc \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM     Document 14     Filed 03/22/22     Page 12 of 14\nordered. Court precedent is in favor of plaintiff. The plaintiff is very clear on bringing claims \nagainst the defendants in their official capacity and individual capacity ....[ A]n individual \nqualifies as an \"employer\" under Title VII  [s olely for purposes of imputing liability to true \nemployer] if he or she serves in a supervisory position and exercises significant control over \nplaintiff's hiring, firing, and conditions of employment.  In such a situation, the individual \noperates as the alter ego of the employer, and the employer is liable for the unlawful employment \npractices of the individual without regard to whether the employer knew of the individual's \nconduct. Id 1125 (citations and quotations omitted). \nHere, no defendant is immune from individual responsibility with they acting under the \ncolor of law by not only rejecting the plaintiff eligible valid ballot, but in addition over 15,000 \neligible and valid ballot casts by black, Hispanic, Caucasian, Asian,  and woman voters, and \nsubmitted an error and omission of record  and falsely certifying Daniel Soptic and other \nCandidates with a certificate of election. The plaintiff believes this is the Judges attempt to free \nthe defendants in their individual compacity and charge the taxpayers for the criminal behavior \nof the claims committed by the defendants. All the cases cited continue to order the Judge to \nallow time to Amend Complaint. \nPLAINTIFF IS AN AGGREIVED PARTY AND ABLE TO BRING CLAIMS ON \nBEHALF OF TIDRD PARTIES. \nThird-party standing, an exception to the general rule, is allowed in. .. cases. A plaintiff \nwho has satisfied the requirements of constitutional standing may assert the rights of others \nwhere (1) the plaintiff has a close relationship with the person possessing the right, and (2)the \nperson possessing the right is hindered in the ability to protect it. Kowalski, 543 U.S. at 128-30; \nAid for Women v Foulston, 441 F. 3d 1101, 1112 (10th Cir. 2006). Third- Party actions are \n121 p \ncl  C \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM     Document 14     Filed 03/22/22     Page 13 of 14\npermitted when it prevented a plaintiff from entering in a contractual relationship. The Sheriff \nseat is considered a four year contractual term when you receive the majority of the vote. When \nthe defendents prevented that relationship after rejecting the plaintiff's valid and eligible ballot \nalong with over 15,000 minority voters, and falsifying documents to certify Daniel Soptic as \nsheriff, the defendants prevented the plaintiff from a contractual relationship when they elected \nher as sheriff. Therefore, if any deficiencies exist in plaintiffs complaint, plaintiff is allowed to \namend and present claims on behalf of the third-parties. The plaintiff has a ve1y close \nrelationship with over 15,000 voter who choose her for Sheriff to protect and serve them. \nCONCLUSION \nOperating underยง 1915(d) is improper even if legal basis underlying the claim ultimately proves \nincorrect. Mckinney v. Oklahoma, 925 F 2d 363. 365 (10th Cir. 1991). The Judge attempts to \nproceed under a standard ofยง 1915(d ) which gives the district court the unusual power to pierce \nthe veil of complaints factual allegations and attempts to dismiss those claims. The Judge \nstatements have been very bias conclusory, and she has operated in a manner advocating for the \ndefendants to help them try and avoid responsibility for there federal violations of the law. The \nplaintiff has established subject matter Jurisdiction, past the merit screening. Meanwhile the \nJudge was very contradictory in her report as an advocate for the defendants with precedent that \nwas is in favor of the plaintiff being able to proceed and amend complaint. All of the cases the \nJudge cited did not have an open election contest in the supreme court. In every case that the \nJudge cited the plaintiff was able to proceed, opportunity to amend complaint or the defendant's \nmotion to dismiss claims were reversed or denied. It is ve1y clear that the plaintiff has \nestablished subject matter jurisdiction, and that the plaintiff cannot be blocked on claims because \nthe defendants fear of prosecution. The Judge advocating for the defendants alone and asking for \n131Pagc \n\nCase 5:21-cv-04089-EFM-ADM     Document 14     Filed 03/22/22     Page 14 of 14\nqualified immunity shows that the plaintiff claims are not conclusory and are factual allegations \nthat are believed to be true, and therefore able to proceed. The plaintiff requests order to proceed \nand time to freely Amend Complaint. Defendants cannot remove Federal claims and enjoin them \nwith state claims unless there was a state claim present in this separate lawsuit proceeding of \nclaims and there is not. All allegations must be believed as true by the plaintiff and cannot be \nblocked. Federal Comis will not enjoin pending state criminal prosecutions except under \nextraordinary circumstances where the danger or in-eparable loss is both great and immediate in \nthat there is a threat to the plaintiff's federally protected rights that cannot be eliminated ...P p \n401 U.S. 43-54. \nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \nI hereby ce1iify that the foregoing copy of the document was served via email and mailed via \nelectronic mail.
